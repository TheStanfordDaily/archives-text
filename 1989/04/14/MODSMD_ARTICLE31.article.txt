# French kissing at Stanford: If the price is right...
## 
### Mark Smoyer Senior staff writer 
In Terry Southern's seminal
1960 satire, "The Magic Chris
tian," the main character, Grand
Guy Grand, devotes his immense
wealth to "making it hot for
people" and conducts a variety of
hilariously warped experiments on
the basis that everyone "has their
price."
The Bug recently embarked on
a related venture which unfortun
ately he is too poor to fully im
plement. A picture in Monday's
Daily of Judge Robert Bork,
Reagan's first choice for the va
cant Supreme Court seat last
year, inspired this lunchtime
question: "Would you French kiss
Robert Bork for $350?"
The varied and vehement reac
tion among the group first ad
dressed with this question led the
Bug to believe that some sort of
psychological conclusions could be
drawn from a person's willingness
to suck face with the famous for
a cash reward. So the Bug ex
panded the field and polled
(nobody was hurt too badly) 50
Stanford students.
The survey was conducted in
earnest (it really was) and ques
tioning proceeded something like
this: For five or 10 seconds, no
strings attached, no future contact
necessary, and assuming he or she
was willing, would you French
kiss Robert Bork for $350? How
about Gretchen Elizabeth Carlson
(Miss America)? David Lee Roth?
We're talking 350 bucks cash ...

Barbara Bush?
The results are printed some
where in this paper in the first
Bug Me bar graph of the academic
year. Remember, as you acquaint
yourself with our user-friendly
visual aid, exactly what we're
talking about. We're talking about
the fact that almost half of 27
men said they'd go tongue-to
tongue with Robert Bork.
Of course, this is for 350 clams,
so why not?
The ramifications of one's re
sponse to any of these hypothet
ical tonguings run deep. In saying
no to Bork, many cited political
differences, others had trouble
with the beard, some said he was

just too ugly and old. But, hell,
I've had to take many a little kiss
on the cheek from very old, rather
ugly, and quite conservative great
aunts, despite their substantial —
if stringy — facial hair. And that
was for free.
Sure it's disgusting to really
imagine exchanging saliva with
the First Lady, but then again
350 bucks isn't just a drop in the
pail. Think about who you have
and who you will slobber with,
perhaps at the cost of the drinks
which led you to compromise your
usually high standards. I mean
it's a great hourly rate!
David Lee "I reached back be
tween my legs and eased the seat
back" Roth, scared some off be
cause of the herpes factor, but
won others over thanks to his
flexibility and somewhat
androgynous character. The Bug
offered some a package deal: Roth,
Sammy Hagar and Laura
Branigan for $1,100; few accepted.
For some reason, a good num
ber of the gals who would French
Mrs. Bush said no thanks to Ms.
Carlson, citing reasons like, "No,
I don't like what she stands for."
Do you really know what she
stands for? For God's sake, prin
ciples officially went out of style
in 1972. Get with it! We're talking
cold, hard cash!
Dear Bug,
I was recently eating M&Ms
and noticed I was eating a lot
more brown ones than green ones.
Is there a specific ratio that Mars
candies uses for all. their bags or

is it just haphazard ?

Well, coincidences of coin
cidences, the Bug just happened
to be flipping through the April
issue of Playboy when he came
across (oops! excuse me) a little
column (there's a joke there too,
I think) of interesting statistics
which had nothing to do with the
measurements of the Girls of the
Big East.
Some of them had to do with
M&Ms and remembering that he
had received your question, the
Bug jotted down the following in
formation:
There are about 100 million
M&Ms produced per year. The
average bag of plain M&Ms con
sists of the following color distri
bution: 30 percent brown; 20 per
cent red and yellow; 10 percent
orange, tan and green. Peanut
M&Ms: 30 percent brown; 20 per
cent red, yellow and green; 10 per
cent orange; 0 percent tan.
Incidentally, among the other
statistics were weekly allowance
averages of American kids: $3.36
in first grade, $6.90 in eighth and
$12.61 in 12th.
I don't know about you, but I
don't think I got any allowance
from my cheap parents after
seventh grade, and if I did, it sure
wasn't anywhere even near $3.36.
It was a big day for me when my
mom went ahead and gave me a
whole twin-pack of generic cup
cakes with my lunch ("Save the
bag, please."), instead of cutting
the package in half.

Dear Bug,
I was recently eating M&Ms
and noticed I was eating a lot
more brown ones than green ones.
Is there a specific ratio that Mars
candies uses for all. their bags or

is it just haphazard ?

Well, coincidences of coin
cidences, the Bug just happened
to be flipping through the April
issue of Playboy when he came
across (oops! excuse me) a little
column (there's a joke there too,
I think) of interesting statistics
which had nothing to do with the
measurements of the Girls of the
Big East.
Some of them had to do with
M&Ms and remembering that he
had received your question, the
Bug jotted down the following in
formation:
There are about 100 million
M&Ms produced per year. The
average bag of plain M&Ms con
sists of the following color distri
bution: 30 percent brown; 20 per
cent red and yellow; 10 percent
orange, tan and green. Peanut
M&Ms: 30 percent brown; 20 per
cent red, yellow and green; 10 per
cent orange; 0 percent tan.
Incidentally, among the other
statistics were weekly allowance
averages of American kids: $3.36
in first grade, $6.90 in eighth and
$12.61 in 12th.
I don't know about you, but I
don't think I got any allowance
from my cheap parents after
seventh grade, and if I did, it sure
wasn't anywhere even near $3.36.
It was a big day for me when my
mom went ahead and gave me a
whole twin-pack of generic cup
cakes with my lunch ("Save the
bag, please."), instead of cutting
the package in half.

An Informal survey by the Bug reveals just who Stanford students
would smootch for 350 smackers (paid in good cold cash). Twenty*
three women and 27 men participated in the survey, which probed
students as to their willingness to French kiss the above celebrities
for five to 10 seconds, with no strings attatched and no future
contact. All above figures indicate the percentages of those willing
to "suck face."
In Terry Southern's seminal
1960 satire, "The Magic Chris
tian," the main character, Grand
Guy Grand, devotes his immense
wealth to "making it hot for
people" and conducts a variety of
hilariously warped experiments on
the basis that everyone "has their
price."
The Bug recently embarked on
a related venture which unfortun
ately he is too poor to fully im
plement. A picture in Monday's
Daily of Judge Robert Bork,
Reagan's first choice for the va
cant Supreme Court seat last
year, inspired this lunchtime
question: "Would you French kiss
Robert Bork for $350?"
The varied and vehement reac
tion among the group first ad
dressed with this question led the
Bug to believe that some sort of
psychological conclusions could be
drawn from a person's willingness
to suck face with the famous for
a cash reward. So the Bug ex
panded the field and polled
(nobody was hurt too badly) 50
Stanford students.
The survey was conducted in
earnest (it really was) and ques
tioning proceeded something like
this: For five or 10 seconds, no
strings attached, no future contact
necessary, and assuming he or she
was willing, would you French
kiss Robert Bork for $350? How
about Gretchen Elizabeth Carlson
(Miss America)? David Lee Roth?
We're talking 350 bucks cash ...

Barbara Bush?
The results are printed some
where in this paper in the first
Bug Me bar graph of the academic
year. Remember, as you acquaint
yourself with our user-friendly
visual aid, exactly what we're
talking about. We're talking about
the fact that almost half of 27
men said they'd go tongue-to
tongue with Robert Bork.
Of course, this is for 350 clams,
so why not?
The ramifications of one's re
sponse to any of these hypothet
ical tonguings run deep. In saying
no to Bork, many cited political
differences, others had trouble
with the beard, some said he was

just too ugly and old. But, hell,
I've had to take many a little kiss
on the cheek from very old, rather
ugly, and quite conservative great
aunts, despite their substantial —
if stringy — facial hair. And that
was for free.
Sure it's disgusting to really
imagine exchanging saliva with
the First Lady, but then again
350 bucks isn't just a drop in the
pail. Think about who you have
and who you will slobber with,
perhaps at the cost of the drinks
which led you to compromise your
usually high standards. I mean
it's a great hourly rate!
