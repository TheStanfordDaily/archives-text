## Blackman brothers keeping it all in the family 
### John Kirks Staff writer 
If you were to thank one family
for its contributions to the Stan
ford men's volleyball program,
which would you choose? Well, the
answer is really quite obvious.
The Blackman family, from
Santa Monica, Calif., is the hands
down choice. The evidence: One
third of the current Cardinal
starting lineup consists of Black
mans — Parker is a junior setter
and Duncan is a freshman outside
hitter.
And, in light of the huge con
tributions both have made in the
Cardinal's drive to achieve its No.
2 national ranking, one has to
wonder in what state the Stanford
team would be had the two
decided not to come to the Farm.
The Blackman brothers, sons
of Pete and Bonni Blackman,
grew up on the beach in Santa
Monica, and have thus always
been exposed to volleyball. Pete,
who played college basketball un
der John Wooden at UCLA, never
pressured his sons to follow in
his basketball footsteps.
In fact, Parker and Duncan's
father played a key organizational
role — sponsoring and supporting
Santa Monica-area volleyball
teams — without which the Black
mans may never have wound up
playing college volleyball.
It's rare enough when brothers
both make it in big time athletics
and even more impressive when
one considers that Parker was
adopted — thus, there was no
guarantee that he would have
even a semblance of his father's
athleticism.
Parker and Duncan both atten
ded Loyola High School, a peren
nial powerhouse in Southern

California. During Parker's junior
and senior years, the team won
the CIF 3A title both times, with
Parker splitting the job of setting
in the team's two-setter offense.
Duncan was called up to the
varsity squad for the second of
those state titles, but, as Duncan
noted, "I played in short spurts
. . . never while Parker was on
the floor."
After Parker left, Duncan was
happy to carry on the Blackman
tradition at the school. In his
junior year, Loyola once again
repeated as CIF titlist. Before

Duncan's senior year, however,
his high school was bumped up
to the 4A division.
Duncan, as team captain and
starting middle blocker, helped
his mates respond to the chal
lenge. Fighting in the trenches
along with current Stanford team
mate Chris Wrede, who set for
the squad, Duncan led the team
to the 4A title.
The younger Blackman's most
impressive accolade coming out of
school, though, would have to be

his ranking as the No. 1 recruit
in the nation, bestowed upon him
in Volleyball Monthly's Fab 50
issue.
However, Duncan just missed
out on another honor: the
statewide balloting for Most Valu
able Player. Another Stanford
athlete by the name of Adam
Keefe took that individual honor.
While younger brother Duncan
was doing battle in Southern Cal
ifornia high school volleyball,
Parker was making a name for
himself at Stanford. In Parker's
freshman season, senior setter
Steve Madory took the fledgling
Blackman under his wing, and
Parker learned quickly.
"We ended up splitting time —
it was about half and half — but
after the first match I started
every [time]," Parker explained.
"Looking back, Steve could have
handled it much worse. But he
was just great.
"He really helped me make the
transition to college volleyball;
without his help, things could
have been much more difficult,"
he said. "He was just such a classy
guy, and I try to follow the ex
ample he set for me by helping
the freshmen whenever I can.
"I did a pretty good job of ad-

justing and did about as much as
I could have expected from myself.
After hitting a lot in high school,
I had to adjust to having nothing
to do with terminating a rally.
That part of the game was out of
my hands, which got to be frus
trating at times.
"But I was able to concentrate
on my setting, which was very
inconsistent that first year,"
Parker said.
Parker apparently improved
steadily, though, throughout his
first year as well as throughout
last year's trial in patience — the
team was 5-13 in Western Inter
collegiate Volleyball Association
play.
For Parker, setting was no
doubt a thankless job. But, he
endured it happily and, certainly
this year, all that effort has paid
off.
After discussing his own tran
sition to collegiate play, Parker
commented on his younger broth
er's successful step up: "I'm not
surprised at all. People look at
Duncan and wonder how such a
skinny guy can be competitive at
this level. But what Duncan lacks
in size he makes up for in quick
ness and technique."
Luckily, the freshman has ad
justed well because he has been
forced to shoulder a huge load in
the Cardinal game plan. Duncan
is the number three hitter on the
team and he is expected to at least

keep pace with the two hitters in
front of him, who happen to be
All-Americans.
In addition, he teams with
senior captain Scott Fortune in
handling the passing duties, a job
that demands as much mental en
durance as it does physical tech
nique. The freshman Blackman
has handled that particular men
tal battle with exceptional ease.
Parker, meanwhile, is without
a doubt one of the principal con
tributors to the Cardinal upsurge.
Duncan explained one of his older
brother's roles: "He fires the team
up. He's a real leader out there,
and if somebody's not playing
well, Parker is the first to get on
them.
"He's a little harder on me; if
he said some of the things to the
other guys that he says to me, he
wouldn't get away with it."
But Parker does more than just
lead. Most recently, the junior's
setting efforts vaulted his troops
to an astounding .506 hitting per
centage against a pumped-up USC
Trojan squad. The opponents were
tough, and so were the playing
conditions.
The ball was frequently wet due
to all the players' perspiration,
but Parker rose above the adverse
conditions in what may have been
his best performance of the year.
And, coming down to the league
play, there is no better time for
Stanford's setter to peak.

Looking to the future, with
Scott Fortune's departure, Dun
can will no doubt move into the
number two hitting slot in his
sophomore season, with Dan
Hanan leading the way as the
number one hitter. So, the Black
man to Blackman connection will
be an even more vital element in
the Cardinal attack.
But the Blackmans are not
looking to next year. Their gaze,
of late, tends to drift mysteriously
southward. Whether or not that
has any correlation with a poten
tial national championship for
them and their Stanford mates,
one would not venture to guess
(but the Final Four will be held
in Los Angeles).
If the Cardinal is to rise up and
take the title from the UCLA
Bruins, the Hawaii Rainbow War
riors and defending champion
USC, Duncan and Parker Black
man, as well as the rest of the
Cardinal, will have to be in fine
form.
The whole team can take a huge
step toward that goal tonight and
tomorrow night, as the Cardinal
hosts its two principal nemeses:
UCLA and Long Beach State. A
two-match sweep would put the
Cardinal in the WlVA's driver's
seat.
But, if the Cardinal should steal
an NCAA Championship, Pete
and Bonni Blackman couldn't be
any happier.
