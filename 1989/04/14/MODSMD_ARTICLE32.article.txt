## Blackman brothers keeping it all in the family 
### John Kirks Staff writer 
If you were to thank one family
for its contributions to the Stan
ford men's volleyball program,
which would you choose? Well, the
answer is really quite obvious.
The Blackman family, from
Santa Monica, Calif., is the hands
down choice. The evidence: One
third of the current Cardinal
starting lineup consists of Black
mans — Parker is a junior setter
and Duncan is a freshman outside
hitter.
And, in light of the huge con
tributions both have made in the
Cardinal's drive to achieve its No.
2 national ranking, one has to
wonder in what state the Stanford
team would be had the two
decided not to come to the Farm.
The Blackman brothers, sons
of Pete and Bonni Blackman,
grew up on the beach in Santa
Monica, and have thus always
been exposed to volleyball. Pete,
who played college basketball un
der John Wooden at UCLA, never
pressured his sons to follow in
his basketball footsteps.
In fact, Parker and Duncan's
father played a key organizational
role — sponsoring and supporting
Santa Monica-area volleyball
teams — without which the Black
mans may never have wound up
playing college volleyball.
It's rare enough when brothers
both make it in big time athletics
and even more impressive when
one considers that Parker was
adopted — thus, there was no
guarantee that he would have
even a semblance of his father's
athleticism.
Parker and Duncan both atten
ded Loyola High School, a peren
nial powerhouse in Southern

California. During Parker's junior
and senior years, the team won
the CIF 3A title both times, with
Parker splitting the job of setting
in the team's two-setter offense.
Duncan was called up to the
varsity squad for the second of
those state titles, but, as Duncan
noted, "I played in short spurts
. . . never while Parker was on
the floor."
After Parker left, Duncan was
happy to carry on the Blackman
tradition at the school. In his
junior year, Loyola once again
repeated as CIF titlist. Before

Duncan's senior year, however,
his high school was bumped up
to the 4A division.
Duncan, as team captain and
starting middle blocker, helped
his mates respond to the chal
lenge. Fighting in the trenches
along with current Stanford team
mate Chris Wrede, who set for
the squad, Duncan led the team
to the 4A title.
The younger Blackman's most
impressive accolade coming out of
school, though, would have to be


Lester Baskin — Dally rue
With the departure of Scott Fortune at year's end, freshman Duncan Blackman will move Into the
number two hitting slot.
