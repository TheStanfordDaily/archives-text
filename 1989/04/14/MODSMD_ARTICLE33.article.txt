# Long Beach State, UCLA at Stanford
## 
### 
TONIGHT, TOMORROW— 7:30 p.m. tipoffs for each.
RECORDS — Stanford (18-4, 13-2 in Western Intercollegiate Volleyball
Association play, No. 2 in the Tachikara men's volleyball poll), Long
Beach State (12-6, 22-7), UCLA (15-2, 25-4, No. 1 in the nation).
INJURIES - None.
WHO'S HOT — Everybody concerned is on fire UCLA's No. 1 national
ranking speaks for itself. Stanford is coming off possibly its most con
vincing win of the year, a three-game sweep of defending national
champion USC. Long Beach State is the recent toast of the WIVA, having
beaten both the Cardinal and the Bruins.
49ER UPDATE — Robert Kutsch and Mark Kerins. who both patrol the
court for Long Beach State, are both among the WIVA leaders in their
respective categories. Kutsch is fifth in the league in hitting percentage,
while Kerins is fourth in kill average and third in ace average
CARDINAL UPDATE - Dan Hanan~ continues to lead the league in kill
average and dig average, and he is among the top five in hitting and
blocking. Scott Fortune is second in the league in kill average
BRUIN UPDATE — Trevor Schirman and Mike Whitcomb are the big guns
for the Bruins: They hold the one-two positions in hitting percentage in
the league. The two are both middle blockers, however, and rarely does
Bruin coach Al Scates throw both at an opposing defense simultaneously.
Anthony Curci is fourth in the league in dig average.
KEYS TO VICTORY — As a team, the Cardinal must put forth the type of
complete effort that it showed against the Trojans. In addition, the squad
must be able to combat the emotional rollercoaster it will no doubt face.
Emotion will come into play on Friday night, as the Cardinal tries to
avenge its late-March loss at the hands of the 49ers. The team must
then come down and rebound to even greater heights to do battle with
the Bruins on Saturday Individually for Stanford, the key has to be
Fortune The bottom line is that, when Fortune is on, the Cardinal is
virtually unstoppable. And, unstoppable is exactly what Stanford must
be to sweep these two matches.
