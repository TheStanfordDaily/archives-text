# Men tumblers fall from high bar, NCAA tourney
## 
### Mark Smoyer Senior staff writer 
Stanford's downfall Came
suddenly last night at the
NCAA Gymnastics Champion
ships in Lincoln, Nebraska.
After scoring a season high
on the parallel bars, the Car
dinal moved optimistically to
the high bar, only to experience
a complete collapse. Ranked at
No. 5 prior to the meet, Stan
ford turned in its worst team
score of the season on one of
its best events to dash any hope
of qualifying for tonight's team
finals.
With a final score of 279.25,
the Cardinal ends the season
as the nation's sixth best team.
The season, though, is not over
for at least three Cardinal gym
nasts. Junior Conrad
Voorsanger, senior Scott Schaf
fer, freshman Tim Ryan and
perhaps sophomore Tim Wang
will ail compete tomorrow in
the individual finals.

Stanford's disappointing
showing was not the only
surprise of last night's compe
tition. Pre-meet rankings had
little to do with the final stand
ings, as only No. 3 Illinois man
aged to qualify for this eve
ning's three-way championship
meet. The Illini came in third
with 282.95 points, behind host
No. 7 Nebraska (283.60) and
No. 6 Minnesota (283.35).
Coming into the meet, Houston
Baptist was ranked at No. 1,
yet it finished fifth last night.
The Cardinal performances
on the two events before and
the three events after the high
bar were very solid. Head
Coach Sadao Hamada believes
his team's bizarre inability to
turn in even a mediocre score
on the high bar might have
been the result of overcon
fidence on the part of the gym
nasts after scoring so well on
the parallel bars.
The NCAA Individual Ail-
Around Championship will be
decided Saturday afternoon at the
compulsory finals. Despite an
8.85 high bar performance,
Voorsanger totaled a superb 56.65
six-event score and will enter the
compulsories in ninth place over
all.
Individual event finals take
place tomorrow evening and will

nasts a chance to salvage some
thing positive from the meet.
Vying for Ail-American honors
will be Voorsanger (parallel bars
and floor), Schaffer (parallel bars
and vault), and Ryan (parallel
bars). Wang is an alternate for
the pommel horse finals.
