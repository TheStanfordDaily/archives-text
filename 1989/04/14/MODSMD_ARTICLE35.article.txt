# Slumping batsmen face Trojans in L.A.

"Just win, baby."
While Los Angeles Raiders
owner A 1 Davis and Stanford
baseball Coach Mark Marquess
couldn't be more opposite, you can
bet that the Cardinal helmsman
will paraphrase Davis' famous
words to his team before they take
on USC tonight.
Although the tools of a baseball
player are his arms and legs, the
fitness of his mind determines
how well he will be able to use
those tools. When the team loses
a few games in a row, it starts
pressing even harder for a win
and as a result, performs even
worse.
The best medicine for what ails
the 17-22 Cardinal right now is
a win. The team comes into the
three-game USC series this week
end with a four-game losing
streak and needs to stop the
hemorrhaging right now.
In order to win the series, the
pitching staff will have to stop
giving up double-digit runs to the
opposing team. At the beginning
of the year, the Cardinal's

strength was "skill on the hill,"
with sophomore phenoms Mike
Mussina and Stan Spencer, who
combined for a record of 16-6 last
season, leading the way.
But as it stands now, Mussina
is injured and Spencer is not
having a career year. At times,
Spencer has pitched very well and
been the victim of a lack of sup
port, while on other occasions he
has given up too many runs for
the Cardinal bats to make up. As
a result, Spencer's record now
stands at 2-6 and he sports an
ERA of 5.60.
Brian Keyser has been asked to
fill the void left by Mussina's ab
sence. Keyser has pitched well at
times, but has also been hit hard.
When his curveball is on the
mark, it is unhittable. When he
hangs it, however, opposing hit
ters have a feast.
Stanford's third starter is de
termined by the first two games.
If Marquess does not need to use
his ace, Steve Chitren, in relief,
he starts him in the third game.
Every time he has been called
upon to start, Chitren has come
through. In the two games he has
started, he has pitched through

the eighth and delivered a win.
If Chitren is used in the first
two games, freshman Steve Wor
rell will get the call in the third.
Monday, against Arizona State,
Worrell did a fine job holding the
explosive Sun Devil offense down
in his five innings of work.

Psychologically, a win in Fri
day's game would give the Cardi
nal a lift that will carry into the
rest of the series. Marquess will
pull out all the stops to get a win
in that first game, even if it means
using Chitren. After all, he just
wants to win, babv.
