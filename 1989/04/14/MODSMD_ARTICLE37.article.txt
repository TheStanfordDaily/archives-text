# Undefeated women's tennis heads for fourth NCAA title
## 
### Mark Rogowsky Editorial staff 
Tomorrow marks a very important an
niversary in collegiate women's tennis: it
marks the one-year anniversary of the last
time anyone beat the Stanford Cardinal in
a dual meet.
That loss, at the hands of the UCLA
Bruins, has already been avenged twice this
season by the 21-0, No. 1-ranked Stanford
team.
As things currently stand, it seems highly
unlikely any of Stanford's remaining op
ponents will duplicate UCLA's feat of 12
months ago. As a matter of fact, the biggest
intrigue for the Cardinal may very well be
determining who is healthy enough to play
in the NCAAs at Gainesville, Fla. next
month.
Recently, sophomore Tami Whitlinger,
the nation's top player; senior Eleni Ros
sides, who has been plagued by physical
problems throughout her Stanford career;
captain Cindy Buchsbaum; and freshman
Kylie Johnson have all been bitten by the
iryury bug.
The good news for Stanford, though, is
they are all on a physical upswing. If every
one is 100 percent, Coach Frank Brennan
may have a tough time determining his
lineup for the championship tournament.
But, even if Brennan threw all the the
names in a hat and picked the lineup at
random, he'd hardly seem capable of com
ing up with a bad one.
Consider these statistics:
Tami Whitlinger is 16-1 at No. 1 singles.
Any pressures of trying to complete an
undefeated season were lifted Wednesday
in a defeat at the hands of California's
Karen Shin. Whitlinger has to be consid

ered a favorite to win the singles title in
Gainesville.
Sandra Birch has been quietly superb
behind Whitlinger in the lineup. Birch is
12-3 (one of those losses coming at No. 1)
and seems certain to repeat as an Ail-
American.
Lisa Green is 17-2 at No. 3. Earlier, she
may have appeared slightly disinterested
as she faced lesser opponents. Lately, the
two-time NCAA singles semifinalist has
been all business, vanquishing her last four
opponents in straight sets.
Next in the order is superfrosh Debbie
Graham. A six-footer out of Fountain Val
ley, Calif., Graham is the Cardinal's lone
undefeated starter. She has dropped a total
of three sets all season in compiling her
perfect 21-0 mark.
If, for some reason, Graham had to move
up in the lineup, she seems more than
ready. Like Green, Graham may have been
distracted by outclassed opponents in the
early going. Now, she's simply unbeatable.
Teri Whitlinger, who like her sister has
lost only one match all season, has 18 wins
in dual-meet play. She is playing better

now than she did last year — and
she was playing No. 3 at the time.
Two notches lower in the lineup,
Whitlinger is tough to beat.
Johnson (the "other" freshman,
if you will) has held down the No.
6 spot all year. Her record is 16-1
with the one loss coming while
she was less than healthy.
Despite her sensational play,
though, Johnson may be the odd
one at NCAAs. The reason is the
increasingly likely return of Ros
sides to singles action. With her
body finally able to play, Rossides
probably senses a need to get in
some dual matches if she hopes
to play in the individual singles
championships.
There is a chance she'll rejoin
the lineup this weekend, which is
nothing but bad news for the rest
of the teams in the nation. The
Cardinal machine is poised for a
run at an unprecedented fourth
straight national championship.
Anyone preparing to stand in
the way, please do so now.
Anyone?
