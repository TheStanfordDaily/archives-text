# Free speech issues spark student interest in SCLC posts

### Goodwin Liu Senior staff writer 
Before this year, the Student Conduct
Legislative Council barely raised an
eyebrow in the University community.
The council was essentially an inert body,
rarely convening and issuing legislation
even less often. Serving a term on the
council was a trivial endeavor.
This year, however, getting elected to
the 12-member council will be more than
a ho-hum achievement. Nine candidates,
four more than in last spring's election,
are running for three spots on a council

whose importance has grown over the
past year.
One salient issue — the relationship
between diversity on campus and freedom
of expression — has directed the attention
of University administrators, faculty and
students toward the council.
Last month, the council raised more
than a few eyebrows when it proposed
an interpretation of the Fundamental
Standard which would have limited free
expression on campus.
Students, lawyers, constitutional law
professors and University President
Donald Kennedy all took the time to re
spond to the council, convincing it that

the proposal jeopardized First Amend
ment principles. The council is now recon
sidering the original proposal.
The issue "has brought the council out
into the Stanford eye," said SCLC can
didate Tino Pena, a junior in biological
sciences. "What it governs and its power
are important to the University."
Along with Pena, many other candi
dates admit they had never heard of the
SCLC before this year. Mike Laris, a
sophomore in political science, said, "The
only reason I had heard of the SCLC
was the free speech issue — seeing how
much power this little tiny council has."
Of the nine candidates, three — Laris.

senior Perry Friedman and junior Ric
Simmons — are from the newly-formed
Committee for First Amendment Rights,
which expressed concern last month that
the council's original proposal would
restrain students from exercising their
rights to free speech.
The committee successfully petitioned
the Faculty Senate to discuss interpreta
tions of the Standard to ensure that any
proposal is scrutinized before it is
enacted.
Other free speech defenders include
Pena and senior Leonard Adler Vvhose
only campaign pitch is "Free Speech.
Nothing More. Nothing Less."

Sophomore Jason Yotopoulos, also a
candidate, said he thinks a University
policy restricting free speech would be
appropriate even if it violated present in
terpretations of the First Amendment.
In addition, junior Canetta Ivy, the
ex-officio council member from the Coun
cil of Presidents, is seeking another term.
In February, she defended the council's
original proposal to restrict certain forms
of expression.
Created in 1968, the council is charged
with "promulgating regulations govern
ing student conduct and establishing dis-
