# Seeing double
## Men's tennis continues the search for a trio of consistent duos 
### Cameron Macky Senior staff writer 
Stanford tennis fans will be
seeing a little something new dur
ing the Cardinal's matches this
weekend. Sort of.
After a brutal road trip that
saw Stanford drop a pair of
matches to UCLA and USC before
holding on to defeat No. 2 Cali
fornia Tuesday, the Cardinal is
more than happy to be headed
into a six-match homestand, start
ing today against Arizona State.
With the win in Berkeley this
week, Stanford appears to have
turned itself around. Stanford As
st. Coach John Whitlinger called
it"the start of a new season."
It may in fact be a new season
for the Cardinal, but one part of
the old season seems to have re
mained constant: an unsettled
doubles lineup. And thus the
"new" Cardinal, just like the old
Cardinal, still isn't exactly sure
how its doubles lineup will stack
up when the NCAA tournament
rolls around.
For that matter, the team and
coaches don't really know for sure
what the lineup will be tomorrow.
Today, however, the doubles are
set. At No. 1, in fact, the Cardinal
may be set for the rest of the
season. Jeff Tarango and Alex
O'Brien, who first played together
two weeks ago at Arizona, have
yet to lose this season. This is a
pair on a roll, fresh off a 6-4, 7-6
win over Cal's Woody Hunt and
Ted Scherman, the top-ranked
duo in the country.
"I think we've found our No.
1 doubles team," Whitlinger said
after the California match. That's
a good sign, because the Cardinal
is still looking for its other two
teams. Stanford almost blew a 4-2
lead Tuesday when its second and
third doubles teams were quickly
trounced (the Cardinal also
defeated Arizona State 5-4 in
Tempe after holding a 4-2 lead),
and USC defeated the Cardinal

last week on the strength of come
from-behind wins at Nos. 2 and 3.
Dan Turbow and Jeff Cathrall
had been playing the No. 2 slot
until Tuesday, when Martin
Blackman took Turbow's place.
Blackman was Tarango's partner
before contracting chicken pox,
and if Tarango and O'Brien con
tinue to flourish, it looks like
Blackman won't be back at No.
1 for awhile.
Blackman and Cathrall got
worked on Tuesday, 6-4, 6-4, but
that's to be expected, considering
it was their first time playing to
gether in a dual match this year.
The two will play at No. 2 today.
As for Turbow, he'll be at No.
3 with Barry Richards today,
which will mark their first time
playing together. Turbow didn't
play at all on Tuesday, instead
watching Richards and Eric Peus
fall 6-2, 6-3.
With all the shifting, Peus is
