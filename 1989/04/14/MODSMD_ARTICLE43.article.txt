# Spikers sights set on national crown
## 
### 
Just a little reminder, a
not-so-subtle warning: the
Stanford men's volleyball
team closes up shop this week
end. After playing Long Beach
State tonight and UCLA to
morrow, Maples Pavilion will
be devoid of spikers for the rest
of the season.

Translation: get your pos
terior out to Maples, or miss
the best volleyball action to hit
the Farm this year. The Hawaii
upset was riveting, the USC
rout entertaining, the Santa
Barbara shellacking exciting;
but this weekend's double
header promises to be even
more dramatic.
Consider: Stanford faces one
of only two teams to beat it,
followed immediately by a clas
sic No. 1-visits-No. 2 clash 24
hours later. A grudge match
and a title match all in one
weekend.
First up for the second
ranked Cardinal is Long Beach,
the only team to consistently
thwart the Cardinal on the
road. Since I've been at Stan
ford (four years) — and maybe
even longer than that — the
49ers always have always
beaten Stanford in Long Beach.
Always.
It never seems to matter that
the Cardinal has a higher

ranking or a better group of
players. Somehow, down in
Southern California, Stanford
always finds its advantage
neutralized.
With a stronger team than
ever, it seemed that this might
be the year Stanford would fi
nally break the jinx.
Nope. Long Beach won in
four.
It's revenge time. The 49ers
are leaving the comfort of their
cozy gym and entering the cold
confines of Maples, where the
host has dropped just one
match this year, the opener to
then-top-ranked Hawaii.
Translation: Long Beach is
in for an awful evening.
A Stanford win is hardly
guaranteed. After upsetting the
Bruins this week, the Niners
will enter the match with un
paralled confidence and the
knowledge that they have
beaten the top two teams in
the country.
But the Cardinal will have
even more motivation. It's
"now or never" time for Fred
Sturm's troops, a fact which
should translate into an in
spired match. Long Beach
won't be a pushover, but is a
containable threat if Dan
Hanan, Scott Fortune and Co.
play a steady match.
That leaves the Bruins,
Stanford's chief rival
this season. The two
squads have see-sawed between
the top- and runner-up posi
tions in the rankings for the
past six weeks, with neither
emerging as a clear cut favor
ite.
If you ask Sturm, he would
probably cite his alma mater
