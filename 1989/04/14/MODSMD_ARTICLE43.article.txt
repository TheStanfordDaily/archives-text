# Spikers sights set on national crown
## 
### 
Just a little reminder, a
not-so-subtle warning: the
Stanford men's volleyball
team closes up shop this week
end. After playing Long Beach
State tonight and UCLA to
morrow, Maples Pavilion will
be devoid of spikers for the rest
of the season.

Translation: get your pos
terior out to Maples, or miss
the best volleyball action to hit
the Farm this year. The Hawaii
upset was riveting, the USC
rout entertaining, the Santa
Barbara shellacking exciting;
but this weekend's double
header promises to be even
more dramatic.
Consider: Stanford faces one
of only two teams to beat it,
followed immediately by a clas
sic No. 1-visits-No. 2 clash 24
hours later. A grudge match
and a title match all in one
weekend.
First up for the second
ranked Cardinal is Long Beach,
the only team to consistently
thwart the Cardinal on the
road. Since I've been at Stan
ford (four years) — and maybe
even longer than that — the
49ers always have always
beaten Stanford in Long Beach.
Always.
It never seems to matter that
the Cardinal has a higher

ranking or a better group of
players. Somehow, down in
Southern California, Stanford
always finds its advantage
neutralized.
With a stronger team than
ever, it seemed that this might
be the year Stanford would fi
nally break the jinx.
Nope. Long Beach won in
four.
It's revenge time. The 49ers
are leaving the comfort of their
cozy gym and entering the cold
confines of Maples, where the
host has dropped just one
match this year, the opener to
then-top-ranked Hawaii.
Translation: Long Beach is
in for an awful evening.
A Stanford win is hardly
guaranteed. After upsetting the
Bruins this week, the Niners
will enter the match with un
paralled confidence and the
knowledge that they have
beaten the top two teams in
the country.
But the Cardinal will have
even more motivation. It's
"now or never" time for Fred
Sturm's troops, a fact which
should translate into an in
spired match. Long Beach
won't be a pushover, but is a
containable threat if Dan
Hanan, Scott Fortune and Co.
play a steady match.
That leaves the Bruins,
Stanford's chief rival
this season. The two
squads have see-sawed between
the top- and runner-up posi
tions in the rankings for the
past six weeks, with neither
emerging as a clear cut favor
ite.
If you ask Sturm, he would
probably cite his alma mater


EVAN TUCHINSKY
as the favorite. Under A 1 Scates,
the godfather of volleyball
coaches, the Bruins win the na
tional title as regularly as the
Stanford women's tennis team.
Being on top is the status quo for
UCLA.
The Cardinal, by contrast, is
the new kid on top-ranked row.
A top-five program for years, the
team had never before this season
cracked into the echelon of title
contenders. These one-versus-two
contests are definitely a different,
unanticipated experience.
Advantage: UCLA.
Well, not really. At home, at
least, Stanford has a better than
average chance of pulling off an
upset.
It will not really be much of an
upset, however. The Long Beach
loss puts the Bruins on equal
footing with the Cardinal, tied
atop the Western Intercollegiate
Volleyball Association with two
losses apiece.
It also moves UCLA back into

Stanford's range, the range of the
defeatable. Hardly a monolith, the
visitor may well be the loser on
Saturday.
Neither of the two squads has
shined consistently of late. Stan
ford swept the Trojans last week
end — a great feat and a team
first — as well as UC-San Diego,
but the previous few weeks were
shaky at best.
Down in So Cal, the Cardinal
was abysmal and disappointing,
losing to Long Beach and taking
extra games to squeak past San
Diego State and winless UC-
Irvine. There is obviously some
thing askew when Irvine takes the
No. 1 team to five games.
The Bruins have also struggled
recently, even without the afore
mentioned defeat. USC took
UCLA to four tight games over
the weekend, and other, weaker
teams have done similarly. This
season at least, the Bruin steam
roller needs a lube and oil change
to become a true juggernaut.
The difference between No.
1 and No. 2, then, is almost
indiscernable. Both teams
win convincingly and often, but

both have their moments of abject
floundering.
It's hard to really slot one as
a favorite on any criterion but
home court advantage. With Stan
ford at home, that would give the
edge to the Cardinal.
But Stanford has one other fea
ture that UCLA may well not have
an answer for: Hanan.
Dan The Man is still ranked in
every single statistical category
the NCAA keeps. Every single
silly category has the name
Hanan somewhere in the top 15
listings.
In non-numerical talk, this
means that Hanan is the best all
around player in the country.
Match after match, he rips oppo
nents apart offensively without
relenting on defense.
With the all-around excellence
of Hanan on the Cardinal's side
of the court, Stanford may well
dictate the difference between No.
1 and No. 2.
Advantage: Stanford.
Translation: Make it out to
Maples.
