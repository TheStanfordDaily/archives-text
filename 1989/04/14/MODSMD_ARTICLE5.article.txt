# Trading pompons for protests
## Trustee Diane Geocaris: a history of 'rabble-rousing' 
### Brad Hayward Senior staff writer 
Editor's note: This is the last in
a series profiling members of
Stanford's Board of Trustees.

Diane Fields Geocaris came to
Stanford because she wanted to
be a Dollie.
By the time she graduated, she
had staged Vietnam War protests,
been threatened with expulsion by
the University President and been
accepted to Stanford Law School.
Today she's on the Board of
Trustees and is the only minority
partner in a Chicago law firm of
over 200 attorneys.
At 38, Geocaris has already had
a tremendously diverse life and is
ready to share a few things she's
learned, especially in the areas of
social action, and race relations.
Originally from Denver,
Geocaris grew up "undeprived, in
a black middle class family" and
attended an "ideally, racially and
economically integrated" high
school.
Though she admitted that the
opportunity to be a Dollie was a

prime motivation in her decision
to attend to Stanford, other fac
tors played a role. She also wanted
to follow in the footsteps of an
older friend who was the first in
her community "to go away and
do well." The friend went to Stan
ford.
So, the fall of 1968 found her
in the girls' wing of Branner Hall.
She spent her freshman year as
"a Dollie groupie" and finally be

came a Dollie the first two quar
ters of her sophomore year.
She went to Stanford's Florence
campus during spring quarter of
that year, just as student demon
strations and violent protests over
Vietnam were bringing the Palo
Alto campus to a standstill.
After Geocaris and her fellow
Florence students marched on the
American consulate to protest the
war, her interest in political ac
tivity increased. She came back
and served in the ASSU Senate
her junior year and was elected
to the Council of Presidents her
senior year.
The COP continued staging
demonstrations and sit-ins, and
Geocaris was in on all of it. In
the spring of 1972, she and her
co-presidents organized a demon
stration that got taken over by
some students who were much
more radical than the organizers.
"It really got out of hand,"
Geocaris said. Many students were
arrested, and University Presi
dent Richard Lyman threatened
to expel the members of the COP.
