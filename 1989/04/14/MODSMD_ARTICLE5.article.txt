# Trading pompons for protests
## Trustee Diane Geocaris: a history of 'rabble-rousing' 
### Brad Hayward Senior staff writer 
Editor's note: This is the last in
a series profiling members of
Stanford's Board of Trustees.

Diane Fields Geocaris came to
Stanford because she wanted to
be a Dollie.
By the time she graduated, she
had staged Vietnam War protests,
been threatened with expulsion by
the University President and been
accepted to Stanford Law School.
Today she's on the Board of
Trustees and is the only minority
partner in a Chicago law firm of
over 200 attorneys.
At 38, Geocaris has already had
a tremendously diverse life and is
ready to share a few things she's
learned, especially in the areas of
social action, and race relations.
Originally from Denver,
Geocaris grew up "undeprived, in
a black middle class family" and
attended an "ideally, racially and
economically integrated" high
school.
Though she admitted that the
opportunity to be a Dollie was a

prime motivation in her decision
to attend to Stanford, other fac
tors played a role. She also wanted
to follow in the footsteps of an
older friend who was the first in
her community "to go away and
do well." The friend went to Stan
ford.
So, the fall of 1968 found her
in the girls' wing of Branner Hall.
She spent her freshman year as
"a Dollie groupie" and finally be

came a Dollie the first two quar
ters of her sophomore year.
She went to Stanford's Florence
campus during spring quarter of
that year, just as student demon
strations and violent protests over
Vietnam were bringing the Palo
Alto campus to a standstill.
After Geocaris and her fellow
Florence students marched on the
American consulate to protest the
war, her interest in political ac
tivity increased. She came back
and served in the ASSU Senate
her junior year and was elected
to the Council of Presidents her
senior year.
The COP continued staging
demonstrations and sit-ins, and
Geocaris was in on all of it. In
the spring of 1972, she and her
co-presidents organized a demon
stration that got taken over by
some students who were much
more radical than the organizers.
"It really got out of hand,"
Geocaris said. Many students were
arrested, and University Presi
dent Richard Lyman threatened
to expel the members of the COP.

It didn't happen, and Geocaris en
tered Stanford Law School the
next year.
After graduating she worked in
San Diego and Washington, D C.
before moving to Chicago. She
was made a partner at Rudnick
and Wolfe in 1983. Her husband,
whom she met at Stanford Law,
is a lawyer in another Chicago
firm.
Geocaris said Stanford students
haven't changed that much in
terms of either race relations or
social conscience since her own
undergraduate days.
"The upper echelons of admin
istration have a long way to go,
but the student body is diverse,"
Geocaris said. "It's the pluralism
... it's, 'do you respect me and
do I respect you?'
"Why hasn't it happened? We're
kids — you ask kids from some
place where they've never had any
experience with people of different
backgrounds to come here and
open their arms, to come together

and forget about their differences.
It's something we can't ignore."
Geocaris said she looks back at
her tumultuous college days and
keeps in mind it was all a learning
experience. "You hope you didn't
hurt anybody too much, you hope
the guy you growled at because
he was white will forget about it,
you hope you can do better when
you're an adult," she said.
On the board, to which she was
elected four years ago, she is "a
rabble rouser. I still vote no, I
think we should get out of South
Africa, I don't want more 'parking
structures.' I carry a lot of bag
gage from the anti-war protests,
from the COP, from being a black
woman, that is hard for a lot of
my colleagues to get past."
Looking back, Geocaris said, she
wishes she had taken "a harder
way — a less materialistic, less
established professional way."
"I have no intention of being a
lawyer 10 years from now," she
said. "I'd be really happy being a
professor in some nice university.
Or I could write trashy novels .. .
I've been studying the genre."
