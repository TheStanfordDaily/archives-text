After a year of construction,
Mall has returned to its
original state, except for a small
grassy area where a solitary
bronze plaque marks the site of
George Segal's controversial and
provocative sculpture, "Gay Lib
eration."
The statue, however, is nowhere
to be found.
It was taken down after being
spray-painted in August, 1987 by

an unknown assailant. Since then
it has been stored in the basement
of the Stanford Museum.
Segal's work, a symbol for the
gay and lesbian movement, has
been a frequent target for van
dalism since its unveiling on Feb
ruary 22, 1984.
Members of the Gay and les
bian Alliance at Stanford would
like to see "Gay Liberation" re
turned to its home by May 7, the
start of their annual GALA week
