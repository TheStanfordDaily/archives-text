# 'Gay Liberation' statue awaits return to site
## 
### Nathanael Cousins Staff writer 
After a year of construction,
Mall has returned to its
original state, except for a small
grassy area where a solitary
bronze plaque marks the site of
George Segal's controversial and
provocative sculpture, "Gay Lib
eration."
The statue, however, is nowhere
to be found.
It was taken down after being
spray-painted in August, 1987 by

an unknown assailant. Since then
it has been stored in the basement
of the Stanford Museum.
Segal's work, a symbol for the
gay and lesbian movement, has
been a frequent target for van
dalism since its unveiling on Feb
ruary 22, 1984.
Members of the Gay and les
bian Alliance at Stanford would
like to see "Gay Liberation" re
turned to its home by May 7, the
start of their annual GALA week
activities. Last year at the begin
ning of the GALA week, 200 pro
testers gathered at the site to
bring attention to the missing
sculpture.
"If the sculpture were returned
by May 7 we would be very
pleased," said Andrew Gans, a
graduate student in GLAS. "We
would like to avoid another
protest."
Although he would not say
whether "Gay Liberation" had
been cleaned yet, Frank Kommer,
who is in charge of renovating the
statue for the Stanford Museum,
said the return of the sculpture
would occur when the mall project
was completed. He would not es
timate when the sculpture would
be back in place.
"I trust the University is treat
ing the sculpture with due re
spect," said Barb Voss, a former
GLAS member who was involved
With trying to return "Gay Lib
eration" last spring. "My impres
sion is that the University and

Art Department are very con
cerned with getting the sculpture
back in place and in time.
"I certainly am excited that it
will be coming back," Voss said.
The $4.7 million dollar Lomita
Mall project, undertaken to install
new utility lines for a proposed
science and engineering center,
was supposed to be completed in
October. University Facilities
Project Manager John Kennedy
told The Daily last week that the
mall project would be completed
in two to three weeks. The con
tractor, Pacific Underground
Construction, has been beset by
delays ranging from a destroyed
delivery truck to a shortage of
needed piping.
"Gay Liberation" was commis
sioned in 1979 for $150,000 by
the Mildred Andrews Fund and
ended up at Stanford after nu
merous cities refused it. It is a
life-size bronze sculpture with
four all-white figures frozen in
mid-motion.
Two men are standing with one
man resting his arm on the
other's shoulder. Two women sit
on a bench nearby, one lightly
touching the other's knee. Artist

George Segal intended the work
to "stress our common human
ity" • , . ,
Despite some alumni and com
munity opposition, the sculpture
was unanimously approved by the
University Panel on Outdoor Art,
the Committee of Land and Build
ing Development and University
President Donald Kennedy.
Within a month of its placement
in Lomita Mall, "Gay Liberation"
was smashed over 40 times by a
ball peen hammer, resulting in
national media coverage and the
temporary removal of the sculp
ture.
Members of the gay and lesbian
community charged that the van
dalism was an act of homophobia
— fear of homosexuals — and that
the shattered sculpture was a
symbol for their community.
"Gay Liberation" was recast
and returned to Lomita Mall on
June 8, 1984. Since then it has
been assailed by a variety of mud,
food and red paint. It was taken
down in August, 1987 after some
one sprayed "AIDS" on one of the
male figures.
