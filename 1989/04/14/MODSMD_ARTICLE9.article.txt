# Nailing down the Coffin slate
## 
### Jonathan Eisenberg Staff writer 
Editor's note: This is the third
in a three-part series of inter
views with the slates running
for Council of Presidents.

The Chaparral's Hammer and
Coffin Slate promises "a
hedonistic orgy of fun" for the
entire student body if elected as
the ASSU's Council of Presi
dents.
The Hammer and Coffin
Slate, consisting of sophomores
Michael Schreiber and Amy Gil
let, freshman Dan Michaeloff
and senior Helen Chang, asserts

that the other slates running
for COP are merely vying for
second place because neither the
Slate of the Times nor the Stu
dents' Choice have any way of
competing against the Chapar
ral's slate or attacking its phi
losophy of "fun for everyone."
Gillet criticized the verbosity
of the other slates' positions and
said, "Our platform is so clear
and so simple ... I think we
proved in the debate (Wednes
day in Florence Moore Hall) . ..
that Itbe other slates] can't
reduce their platform to some
thing as simple and comprehen
sible as ours."
Nevertheless, the Hammer

and Coffin Slate offers a group
of proposals to improve student
life, including:
• an "E-ticket Disney ride" in
White Plaza;
• a Really Beat the Bookstore
campaign to undersell the book
store by as much as 50 percent;
• the end of sending report
cards by mail;
• an Adopt-a-Cat program in
which freshmen would care for
stray cats for one week; and
• a Mandate for Change — to
increase the hiring of funny fac
ulty, establish a funny person
theme house and make a wit
