# Nailing down the Coffin slate
## 
### Jonathan Eisenberg Staff writer 
Editor's note: This is the third
in a three-part series of inter
views with the slates running
for Council of Presidents.

The Chaparral's Hammer and
Coffin Slate promises "a
hedonistic orgy of fun" for the
entire student body if elected as
the ASSU's Council of Presi
dents.
The Hammer and Coffin
Slate, consisting of sophomores
Michael Schreiber and Amy Gil
let, freshman Dan Michaeloff
and senior Helen Chang, asserts

that the other slates running
for COP are merely vying for
second place because neither the
Slate of the Times nor the Stu
dents' Choice have any way of
competing against the Chapar
ral's slate or attacking its phi
losophy of "fun for everyone."
Gillet criticized the verbosity
of the other slates' positions and
said, "Our platform is so clear
and so simple ... I think we
proved in the debate (Wednes
day in Florence Moore Hall) . ..
that Itbe other slates] can't
reduce their platform to some
thing as simple and comprehen
sible as ours."
Nevertheless, the Hammer

and Coffin Slate offers a group
of proposals to improve student
life, including:
• an "E-ticket Disney ride" in
White Plaza;
• a Really Beat the Bookstore
campaign to undersell the book
store by as much as 50 percent;
• the end of sending report
cards by mail;
• an Adopt-a-Cat program in
which freshmen would care for
stray cats for one week; and
• a Mandate for Change — to
increase the hiring of funny fac
ulty, establish a funny person
theme house and make a wit

quota for undergraduate admis
sions.
The members of the Hammer
and Coffin Slate promise to
donate their salaries from the
ASSU — a total of $18,000 — to
buy the "Tilt the World" ride from
Disneyland in an effort to attract
President George Bush to speak
on campus.
However, Schreiber noted that,
except for the Disney ride,
"[These proposals are] just
propaganda that we're throwing
out . . . empty, hollow campaign
promises."

The Hammer and Coffin Slate
also addressed the issue of cul
tural pluralism at Stanford by
noting the campus is already a
multicultural society. "We're uni
fying with the concept of fun,"
explained Gillet.
In reference to the Slate of the
Times' "vision for a multicultural
community," Schreiber added,
"The fact that we don't have a
'vision' just means that we don't
eat mushrooms."
The members of the Hammer
and Coffin Slate feel that they
are best qualified to serve as COP
because they each have a lifetime
of experience at having fun as well
as the 90-year tradition of the
Chaparral behind them.

Schreiber also noted, "We have
an utter lack of idealism. . . .
(We're not) an elitist group of
people who are just interested in
high moral issues."
To describe the Hammer and
Coffin Slate's philosophy of gov
ernment in office, Michaeloff cited
the old adage: government which
governs least governs best.
Schreiber emphasized the Ham
mer and Coffin Slate's frugality
by stating that so far they have
only spent $20 on the campaign,
$230 below the allowable limit.
When asked for a final state
ment, Schreiber answered, "Even
if I don't get elected, it will look
good on my resume."
