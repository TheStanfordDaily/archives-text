If only I had a
LaserWriter...
Think of all the wonderful things
you could do if only you had a
Laser Writer® printer.
Okay, now come mm Kinko's and
use ours.
Use our Macintosh® 1 and
LaserWriter® system to produce
near-typeset quality documents
without the high cost of
conventional typesetters or
expensive equipment.
