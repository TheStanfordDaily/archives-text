# Mandating Voluntary' public service rouses fears
## 
### John Wagner Editorial staff 
If bills sponsored by Sen. Sam Nunn,
D-Ga., and Rep. Dave McCurdy, D-Okla.,
become law, "voluntary" public service
would become an involuntary necessity
for students who hope to attend college
and can't afford it.
Fear of this prospect is being expressed
by a growing number of students and
college administrators at Stanford and
across the country, including University
President Donald Kennedy and Director
of Financial Aids Robert Huff.
Nunn's National Service Act and
McCurdy's companion bill in the House
are two of more than a half-dozen current

bills of their kind designed to reinvigorate
the public consciousness of the nation's
youth. The Nunn-McCurdy approach,
however, has sparked more controversy
than the others because it links the
receipt of federal financial assistance for
college to the performance of public serv
ice.
Supporters of the bill argue that society
will benefit from people working for what
they get.
Under the terms of the Nunn-McCurdy
proposal, college-bound students — in ex
change for their labor in a national Cit
izen Corps — would receive government
vouchers to be used toward financing
their education.
But traditional federal loans and grants

would be eliminated, making students in
eligible for any type of federal aid unless
they first perform public service for one
to two years.
Most experts agree, however, that the
linkage of federal aid to public service
will be set aside during the initial legisla
tive tug-of-war already begun in
Congress.
Although this connection may be
avoided for now, it probably will not be
shelved for good.
Under the provisions of the Nunn-
McCurdy bill, many of the 4,600 students
at Stanford and the two million nation
wide who rely on federal grants and loans
to attend college each year would be
forced to postpone college for up to two

years while they fulfill a public service
obligation.
"Nunn's bill frightens me to death,"
Huff told The Daily earlier this month.
If implemented, he said, the effects of
the legislation on student financial aid
would be "catastrophic," and cause Stan
ford to lose close to $20 million per year

normally covered by federal grants and
loans.
In an interview which aired on NBC
Nightly News last month, Kennedy said
that a system which ties federal aid for
college to public service would perpetuate
the inequalities between the haves and
have-nots.
"It will kind of create a two-tiered pop
ulation in college if it's the only source
of aid: One group of people who either
aren't interested or can afford not to be
interested and then one group that have
had to do this in order to get their way
paid to college."
