# Mandating Voluntary' public service rouses fears
## 
### John Wagner Editorial staff 
If bills sponsored by Sen. Sam Nunn,
D-Ga., and Rep. Dave McCurdy, D-Okla.,
become law, "voluntary" public service
would become an involuntary necessity
for students who hope to attend college
and can't afford it.
Fear of this prospect is being expressed
by a growing number of students and
college administrators at Stanford and
across the country, including University
President Donald Kennedy and Director
of Financial Aids Robert Huff.
Nunn's National Service Act and
McCurdy's companion bill in the House
are two of more than a half-dozen current

bills of their kind designed to reinvigorate
the public consciousness of the nation's
youth. The Nunn-McCurdy approach,
however, has sparked more controversy
than the others because it links the
receipt of federal financial assistance for
college to the performance of public serv
ice.
Supporters of the bill argue that society
will benefit from people working for what
they get.
Under the terms of the Nunn-McCurdy
proposal, college-bound students — in ex
change for their labor in a national Cit
izen Corps — would receive government
vouchers to be used toward financing
their education.
But traditional federal loans and grants

would be eliminated, making students in
eligible for any type of federal aid unless
they first perform public service for one
to two years.
Most experts agree, however, that the
linkage of federal aid to public service
will be set aside during the initial legisla
tive tug-of-war already begun in
Congress.
Although this connection may be
avoided for now, it probably will not be
shelved for good.
Under the provisions of the Nunn-
McCurdy bill, many of the 4,600 students
at Stanford and the two million nation
wide who rely on federal grants and loans
to attend college each year would be
forced to postpone college for up to two

me to death.'

years while they fulfill a public service
obligation.
"Nunn's bill frightens me to death,"
Huff told The Daily earlier this month.
If implemented, he said, the effects of
the legislation on student financial aid
would be "catastrophic," and cause Stan
ford to lose close to $20 million per year

normally covered by federal grants and
loans.
In an interview which aired on NBC
Nightly News last month, Kennedy said
that a system which ties federal aid for
college to public service would perpetuate
the inequalities between the haves and
have-nots.
"It will kind of create a two-tiered pop
ulation in college if it's the only source
of aid: One group of people who either
aren't interested or can afford not to be
interested and then one group that have
had to do this in order to get their way
paid to college."
But Kennedy — as well as many
others who have spoken out
against the linkage aspect of the
Nunn-McCurdy proposal — sup
ports the general idea of a national
volunteer system.
"The idea of national service is
good," Kennedy told The Daily.
"Having it be the only vehicle for
federal student aid is not."
Kennedy said he believes volun
tary national service is "an idea
whose time has come." He is not
alone.
Advocates of an American na
tional service program claim that
voluntary public service would
help cure various social ills as well
as benefit college-bound students
in need of financial assistance.
In exchange for serving in vol
unteer organizations which
protect the environment, aid the
elderly, disabled or homeless, stu
dents will get a financial break in
paying for college.
According to Catherine Milton,
director of Stanford's Public Serv
ice Center, many students are in
terested in national service but
do not have the opportunity to
serve because of tremendous pres
sure to pay back college loans. A
national service bill that would
relieve some of the burden of
loans would make engaging in
public service a more realistic op
tion for many students, Milton
said.
The Nunn-McCurdy bill claims
a national service program would
"encourage young Americans to
serve their country and each other
in order to foster greater civic
responsibility, marshal our na
tion's human resources to meet
national needs — especially the
needs of the poor, and to open
new paths to opportunity and up
ward mobility for young people to
serve their country."
A legislative assistant to
McCurdy told The Daily that
given the appeal of such social
benefits, public service as a con
cept "is very hard to argue
against."
In fact, all those consulted by
The Daily who are keeping close

tabs on the legislative process
agree that some type of national
service bill is inevitable.
An assistant to Sen. Dale
Bumpers, D-Ark. — who also has
a bill under consideration — was
the most blunt in his assessment:
"There's gonna be a bill. Bush
wants a bill. Congress will oblige."
The task before Congress now
is to hammer out a bill that will
incorporate politically satisfactory
portions of each of the more than
half-dozen national service offer
ings.
Besides the question regarding
linkage to college aid, the various
legislative efforts differ in other
ways as well:
• The period of time students
would perform service. Options
include: full-time between high
school and college, full-time after
college graduation or part-time
during college,
• The nature and amount of the
benefits offered for serving,
• The types of service work
available and
• The structure of the national
administration of the program.
Given the spectrum of differing
viewpoints, most observers think
the process of drafting a bill is
likely to be especially complicated
and contentious.
In the House, the national serv
ice legislation is being considered
by three committees: Education

service a more re
alistic option for

and Labor, Veterans' Affairs and
Armed Services.
In the Senate, the bill is being
handled by the Labor and Human
Resources Committee, chaired by
Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass.
Kennedy is among those who have
introduced a bill of his own.
According to an aide to Nunn,
Sen. Kennedy is now in the
driver's seat in the legislative
process and has "quite a task
ahead of him" as he begins to
patch together the various bills.
But, while the current legisla
tive drama occupies center stage,
the more value-laden issue of who
deserves access to higher educa
tion has emerged from the wings.
Critics nationwide argue that
the potential change from a need
based to service-based system of
financial aid raises serious ques
tions about whether higher edu
cation is a public good to which
all should have access or a com
modity which must be purchased
through service.
According to Huff, the most
troubling aspect of the Nunn-
McCurdy proposal is that the bill
— by replacing federal grants and
loans with service requirements
— "destroys need as the legitimiz
ing basis for college aid."
The Nunn and McCurdy camps
are fully aware that tying public

service to federal assistance to col
lege will require a revolution in
thinking about higher education.
The McCurdy assistant told The
Daily that the linkage aspect of
the Nunn-McCurdy proposal
"would require a different way of
thinking and would be a great
departure from our current mode
of thought" about who deserves
post-secondary education.
A college education should not
be financed by a government
hand-out, according to the aide.
"There is a very incorrect feeling
that the government should just
write checks," she said. "Democ
racy isn't free."
An aide to Nunn told The Daily
that she believes the linkage of
public service to college assistance
was a "dramatic" measure which
"the American people would wel
come."
"It is important for the young
to have a sense of reciprocity.
That's not too much to ask," she
said.

On the same NBC broadcast
during which Kennedy charged
that the Nunn bill would create
a two-tiered system, Nunn coun
tered by claiming federal aid for
college should be earned.
"I don't apologize to anyone for
saying that someone who serves
the country should receive from
the tax-payers more benefits than
someone who doesn't serve the
country," Nunn said.
The McCurdy assistant ac
knowledged that the implementa
tion of the Nunn-McCurdy bill
would require students from
lower-income families to serve in
the Citizen Corps in order to at
tend college.
"If they really need the funds,
they will need to serve," she said.
The opportunities created by
the Citizen Corps, she added, will
benefit the poor in the long run
since they will not be incurring
debt during their college years.
Additionally, the national serv
ice program would be more in
clusive and more just in distribut
ing federal aid to all classes, the
McCurdy assistant said.
"The current programs are dis
criminatory against everyone but

the poor," she said, adding that
the middle-class is especially hard
hit under current legislation.
Those who oppose the linkage
approach of the Nunn-McCurdy
bill, but Bupport national service
legislation, would like to see a
program in which both public
service and traditional models of
federal aid would be options.
According to Milton, any na
tional service requirements must
be flexible, allowing students to
serve at the time that best suits
their needs.
National service bills intro
duced by Kennedy, Bumpers and
Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.1., are
more realistic options than the
Nunn-McCurdy proposal, accord
ing to Milton.
Political realism is likely to put
the linkage aspect of the Nunn-
McCurdy proposal on hold.
Since the drafting of his Na
tional Service Act, Nunn has
realized the transition from need
based aid to service-based aid will
most likely be a gradual one, ac
cording to an aide.
And, according to the assistant
to McCurdy, although McCurdy
"is wed" to the linkage aspect of

the proposal, he has realized from
the beginning that the radical
terms of the bill will have to be
implemented incrementally.
Because it represents a "major
alteration" in thought about ed
ucation, McCurdy's vision may
take years to fulfill, the assistant
said.
Some experts fear the legisla
tive patchwork approach currently
underway may produce a bill on
national service that lacks a com
mon theme and compromises its
own intent.
According to Chuck Ludlam, an
aide to Bumpers, given the great
number of differing viewpoints
clamoring for accomodation, the
compromise bill will most likely
contain "a little of everything, but
not much of anything."
The bill will lack a unifying con
cept, he said, and he is skeptical
"it will do anyone any good."
Others have adopted a wait
and-see outlook. According to a
staff member of Leon Panetta,
D-Ca. — who is also co-sponsoring
a House bill — the resulting bill
will be viewed as an experiment.
More legislation is then likely to
follow, he said.
