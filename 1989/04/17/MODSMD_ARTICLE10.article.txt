# Feminist Steinem lauds 'reproductive freedom'
## 
### Eric Muñoz 
In a spirited talk to a packed
audience in Kresge Auditorium
Friday afternoon, famed
feminist Gloria Steinem said
"the establishment of a wom
an's reproductive freedom as a
basic human right" is the most
important challenge facing
women today.
"Government influence over
women stops at our skin," said
Steinem, the author of several
books and the co-founder of Ms.
magazine.
Steinem — who was a
speaker at a massive pro-choice
rally in Washington, D.C. on
April 9 — made no direct ref
erence to the current national
furor over the possible reversal
of the Supreme Court's deci
sion in the landmark case in
volving reproductive rights,

Roe v. Wade. But she stressed
the importance of the general
issue for women.
For example, she said many
patriarchal religions symboli
cally try to take away women's
reproductive powers by insist
ing that a child is not truly
born until he or she is baptized
by a church official.
Steinem told audience mem
bers that the point of her
speech was to "empower" other
people to make their own
speeches to champion impor
tant causes today.
She said people need to work
to eradicate patriarchal tradi
tions in society. Developments
such as the introduction of
feminist studies programs at
universities nationwide, for ex
ample, are helping to wipe out
social patriarchy, she said.
