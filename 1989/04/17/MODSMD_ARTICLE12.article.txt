## British mourn 94 killed in weekend soccer disaster 
### 
SHEFFIELD, England (AP) -
Lawmakers yesterday demanded
changes in stadium designs, in
cluding a ban on anti-riot fences,
after a mad rush at a soccer match
trapped thousands of fans behind
one of the steel barriers. At least
94 people died.
Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher visited Hillsborough sta
dium and promised a public in
quiry into Saturday's disaster,
which turned a soccer cup semi
final between Liverpool and Not
tingham Forest into a nightmare.
The investigation was expected
to focus on why so many fans
were still outside as the match
began and on allegations that
many entered the sold-out stadi
um, which has a capacity of
54,000, without tickets or with
forged tickets.
In Liverpool, the Roman Cath
olic cathedral was filled to over
flowing for a requiem Mass for
the victims â€” most of them from
the northwest port city. The
Anglican cathedral's bell tolled 94
times to mark the deaths.
Survivors broke down in tears
as they described watching
children die and people hit each
other in the frenzied fight to sur
vive Britain's worst sports disas
ter.
Steve Ellis, a photographer, said
he could hear and see children
screaming as they were pressed

into the fence.
"More were coming in from the
back, pushing forward. I can still
see the young lads behind the
fence shouting, 'Save me!' I'll
never forget it until the day I
die," he said.
Seventeen-year-old Wayne
Adams said he was about five
rows from the front of the crowd.
"I realized it was serious when I
saw one of the lasses standing
near me just turn blue in the face.
She went down. She was dead.
That was it,"he said.
Police defended the decision to
open 16-foot-wide steel gates out
side the stadium just as the match
began. Last-minute arrivals then
poured into a central standing
room-only section, pressing those
already inside against the steel
mesh fence.
The sturdy 10-foot-high fence,
angled in at the top to stop people
from scaling it, prevented them
from escaping over the top to the
field. Some were crushed to death.
Others suffocated or were
trampled trying to fight their way
out of the crowd or when the bar
rier finally collapsed.
South Yorkshire's chief con
stable, Peter Wright, said a senior
officer decided to open the gates
"to save people's lives and to
relieve the crush outside."
Survivor Stephen Dooling, 34,
defended the action. "The police

had to open the door because the
lads at the front were screaming.
They would have died there at
the turnstiles instead of in the
ground," Dooling said from his
hospital bed.
Outside the stadium, people lay
flowers and team scarves in mem
ory of the dead.
Many victims were teen-agers
and children, because the cheap
standing-room-only section is
favored by young fans.
Pratt said 170 people were in
jured. Seventy-one people were
hospitalized, many in extremely
critical condition.
It was the third major soccer
tragedy in four years involving
English teams, which have been
barred from European soccer
competition since a May 1985
rampage by Liverpool fans at
Heysel stadium in Brussels that
killed 39 people.
Eighteen days earlier, 56 soccer
fans had died in a fire at Bradford
stadium in England.
Lawmakers, sports officials and
survivors demanded changes in
stadium designs and elimination
of anti-riot fences and standing
room sections, known as terraces.
In the terraces, fans pay about
$6.80 and stand on bare concrete
ledges that ascend from the edge
of the field to about 10 feet above
ground level.
