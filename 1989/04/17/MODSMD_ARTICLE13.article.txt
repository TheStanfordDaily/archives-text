# Father hunted in slayings of wife, children and in-laws

### 
GLEN ELLEN, Calif. (AP) - A 3-year
old girl, the only survivor of a rampage
that claimed her mother, grandmother,
two sisters, two aunts and an unrelated
man, was showered with toys yesterday
as she recovered from a slashed throat.
Lawmen hunted her father, 28-year-old
winery worker Ramon Salcido, from
Mexico to Canada.
The object of compassion was 3-year
old Carmina Salcido, who was rescued
bleeding and barely conscious Saturday
from a wine country dump between
Petaluma and Sonoma, near the bodies
of her two sisters, whose throats also
were cut.
Salcido has been hunted since Friday
morning when officers discovered the
bodies of his wife, Angela, 24, at their

Boyes Hot Springs home; his mother-in
law and her two young daughters at their
home in Cotati; and a co-worker at the
Grand Cru Winery. Police have not yet
pieced together the sequence of killings.
"We've got to find him, we've got to
find him," Sonoma County Sheriff Dick
Michaelsen mumbled at a news confer
ence Saturday after the discovery of Car
mina and her sisters.
Salcido has been described by neighbors
as a hostile gun-toter who drank a lot,
a husband who harbored chronic, tower
ing jealousy of his attractive wife — to
the point that he drove home from work
several times a day to spy on her.
Carmina, her throat cut nearly from
ear to ear, and her dead sisters, Teresa,
1, and Sofia, 4, were found near a landfill

transfer station not far from where Sal
cido had fled with them Friday.
Carmina, also suffering exposure and
dehydration, was flown to Petaluma Val
ley Hospital, where she told deputies her
father had slashed her sisters and herself.
After two hours of surgery, Carmina was
in stable condition.
"She's still in stable condition and
doing well," nursing supervisor Stasia
Andrew said Sunday. "Different people
have sent stuffed animals. She has a teddy
bears and a couple of bunnies."
Doctors said she suffered some vocal
cord damage but is expected to recover.
A trust fund was being established for
Carmina in a Sonoma bank.
Michaelsen said Salcido is the only
suspect in the killings. A ranch worker

who was shot in a shoulder, apparently
the first person attacked, had alerted
authorities, sending them first to the
winery where they found one man shot
to death.
At a news conference Friday, Michael
sen said a department psychologist had
warned that the savagery of the slaying?
indicated Salcido "no longer felt any af
fection or attachment to his own
children."
The three girls were spotted in a ravine
near the dump by a man working on his
truck.
"At first he thought they were dolls,"
the sheriff said.
The man, unidentified, called to a
worker from the dump and the two found

"yet another horrible scene," Michaelsen
said.
"I tried to talk to the little girl who
was still alive and I tried to comfort her,"
said the dump worker, Tim Smith.
Autopsies performed Saturday in San
Francisco revealed that Angela Salcido
had been shot, and her mother had been
shot and her throat was slashed, the
sheriff s office reported. Angela Salcido's
two sisters, age 8 and 12, died of throat
wounds apparently inflicted with a knife
and had been raped and sodomized, Mic
haelsen said.
A friend and a neighbor described Sal
cido as fiercely jealous of his wife.
"He's crazy. He was always going
around with a gun," said Richard Clark,
a next-door neighbor to the Salcidos.
