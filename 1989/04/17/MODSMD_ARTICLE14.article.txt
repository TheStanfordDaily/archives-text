### 
JERUSALEM (AP) — Three Palestinians
including a 10-year-old boy were killed yes
terday in clashes with soldiers as protests
broke out on the first anniversary of the
slaying of a PLO military chief.
In Jerusalem, leaders of Prime Minister
Yitzhak Shamir's right-wing Likud bloc
balked at giving Cabinet approval to
Shamir's election plan for the occupied
West Bank and Gaza Strip.
Despite army curfews in the occupied
territories ordering 700,000 Palestinians
to remain in their homes, more than a
dozen protests were reported yesterday
over the death of Khalil Wazir in Tunis
last April 16. Israeli sources have said Is
rael's agents carried out the slaying, but
the government has never claimed respon
sibility.
In the West Bank city of Nablus, dozens
of pictures of Wazir, better known by his
PLO codename, Abu Jihad, were plastered
on walls and utility poles.
In downtown Tel Aviv, which is predom
inantly Jewish and rarely a site of violence,
assailants believed to be Palestinians set a
gas balloon ablaze at a pub entrance and
painted graffiti calling on Arabs to avenge

Wazir's death, Israel television said.
Ten-year-old Mohammed Suleiman Rabai
was killed in the West Bank village of
Sumou when soldiers opened fire during a
stone-throwing demonstration to protest
Wazir's killing, Arab reports said. The army
confirmed Rabai's death but said it was
checking the circumstances.
Nasser Ibrahim Kasas, 17, died after he
was shot in the back during a demonstra
tion over Wazir's death in the Dheishe
refugee camp outside Bethlehem.
In the Gaza Strip town of Khan Yunis,
soldiers shot and killed a 22-year-old Pal
estinian who attacked a soldier with a knife
and refused to stop when troops fired in
the air, the army said.
Arab reports gave the victim's name as
Khalil Mustafa Al-Asstal. The army said
he was wanted by authorities.
Six Palestinians also were wounded in
clashes with soldiers, Arab reports said.
Military spokesmen confirmed at least two
injuries.
The latest deaths brought to 435 the
number of Palestinians killed in the 16-
month uprising against Israel's occupation
of the West Bank and Gaza.
