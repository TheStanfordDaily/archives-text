Libya denies Pan Am bomb link
ROME (AP) — Libya yesterday angrily denied
a report in a British newspaper linking it to the
bombing of Pan Am Flight 103.

uted to U.S. intelligence sources, said the bombing

Guards.
Libya's official JANA news agency, in a dis
patch monitored in Rome, said Libya "has reaf
firmed repeatedly its condemnation of terrorism
in general and the disaster suffered bv the Pan
Am jumbo jet in particular, and the report pub
lished by this newspaper amounts to no more
than a part of the campaign of distortion and
twisting."
Belgians protest NATO missiles
BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) — Tens of thou
sands of demonstrators yesterday protested plans
to modernize NATO's short-range nuclear mis

alliance meeting this week.
"Do not modernize the missiles — scrap them,"
the demonstrators chanted as they marched
through central Brussels.
Organizers said 75,000 people participated.
Police put the figure at just more than 21,000.
"More than ever, demonstrations are neces
sary," said Hugo Ongena, a spokperson for anti
nuclear activists who organized the march.
Belgium's center-left coalition government said
last Tuesday it wanted NATO to delay plans to
modernize its short-range nuclear arms in Europe

issue as soon as possible.
