WASHINGTON (AP) - House
Speaker Jim Wright said yester
day he is eager to defend himself
against allegations of ethics vio
lations, asking that a hearing be
held within hours after the release
of a formal ethics committee
report.
"I am requesting the earliest
possible opportunity to appear
before the committee to answer
specifically any statement of al
leged violations," Wright said in

a letter the speaker's office said
was delivered Sunday afternoon
to the leaders of the ethics com
mittee.
"I am prepared to appear as
early as Monday afternoon, but
certainly the committee should be
able to schedule a hearing within
seven days," Wright wrote to
Rep 9. Julian Dixon, D-Calif., and
John Myers, R-Ind. The commit
tee is scheduled to issue its report
this morning.

Wright noted in his letter that
"there are many procedural rights
available to me which could
postpone final committee action
for months" but emphasized that
he wanted to move quickly and
expressed hope the committee
would put its own deliberations
on a fast track.
Wright has said the business of
the House in dealing with
legislation is being hampered by
the attention focused on his case.
