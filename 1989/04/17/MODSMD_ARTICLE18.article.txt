CORSIER-SUR-VEVEY, Swit
zerland (AP) â€” Festooned streets
overflowed with people wearing
bowler hats and baggy trousers
yesterday as thousands joined to
commemorate the 100 th birthday
of Charlie Chaplin, who died in
1977.
The English comedian spent the
last 25 years of his life in Corsier
and was the most famous resident
of this wine-producing village
overlooking Lake Geneva.
"His films leave us a poignant
message of justice and equality,"

said Swiss President Jean-Pascal
Delamuraz who spoke at a cere
mony dedicating a park to Chaplin
at nearby Vevey.
Also attending the ceremony
was British Ambassador Christo
pher Long, who praised Chaplin
as "a unique and extraordinary
phenomenon."
The solemn tributes were of
little interest to the costumed
children assembled in the park.
They were entertained by David
Lee Parsons, an American imper
sonator of Chaplin who hns per

formed as the "little tramp" in
many countries.
The Chaplin family was repre
sented by the comedian's son Mi
chael, Michael's wife and two of
their children.
Chaplin's wife, Lady Oona, re
mained home at the Manoir de
Ban, the 18th century manor that
Chaplin bought in 1953. A spokes
man for the organizers of the cen
tennial celebration, Jean-Charles
Kollros, said she was not feeling
well enough to attend.
