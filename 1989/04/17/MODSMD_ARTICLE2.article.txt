# Senate hopefuls set strategies to win
## 
### Baldwin Lee Staff writer 
An examination
of the 43 under
graduates seeking
election to the
ASSU Senate shows
they are divided into
three groups: 10
People's Platform

members offering continuity, 10
Students First nominees em
phasizing diversity and 23 non
affiliated candidates who are
stressing independence.
The 17 graduate senate hope
fuls, on the other hand, are
unified behind a concentration on
meeting the needs of graduate
students.
Duru Ahanotu, a current
People's Platform senator, said all
of this year's People's Platform
candidates subscribe to the same
ideology. Sophomore Sophia
Shing, a senate nominee, summed
up the platform of her party's
candidates: They will attempt to
finish the work on issues brought

to the fore by past party senators.
Shing cited teaching assistant
cutbacks and minority studies
professorships as examples of is
sues that senators still need to
push.
Ahanotu said the fact that pre
vious People's Platform senators
help new senators from the party
learn the ropes reinforces the
party's ability to work toward its
goals over time.
While the People's Platform
stresses unity, Students First sen
ate candidates highlight the di
versity of their party. Senate can
didate Martina Lauchengco said
Students First nominees are a co
alition of diverse ideologies
brought together by a devotion to
student needs.
Lauchengco said that while her

party's candidates may have dif
ferent stands, they agree that stu
dent issues — and not political
issues — must be the primary
focus of the ASSU.
Jim Abbott, another Students
First senate candidate, said his
party provides a mainstream al
ternative to the People's Plat
form, which he characterized as
a "narrow group ... of liberals."
He added that Students First
candidates are running on the
theme of service not politics. Ac
cording to Abbott, People's Plat
form members concentrate too
much on political issues such as
Webb Ranch and the grape
boycott.
However, Shing defended the
People's Platform saying political
issues and student issues do not
draw on a finite amount of
senators' time. People's Platform
candidates can spend as much
time on student issues as Students
First while working on political
issues as well, she said.
Freshman Jim Hsu, an inde
pendent candidate, said while Stu
dents First proclaims itself as the
alternative to the People's Plat
form, it is independents who are
the true alternative. Independents
cannot be constrained on an issue
due to a party stand, Hsu ex
plained.
Hsu said he is running inde
pendently because of his opposi
tion to the party system and the
bureaucracy it adds to the ASSU.
According to Hsu, independent
candidates help promote the elec
tion of senators due to their in

dividual merits.
In the graduate student senate
race, where 17 candidates are
seeking the 10 seats, the People's
Platform is the only party endors
ing candidates. Seven graduate
candidates are endorsed by the
People's Platform.
No graduate senate candidates
were endorsed last year, and this
year's endorsements will have
little impact, according to current
graduate senator Bob Griffin.
Griffin cited the lack of compe
tition in graduate senatorial races
— the Humanities and Science
district is the only district where
the number of candidates exceeds
the number of available seats —
as one reason endorsements will
have a minimal effect.
Chris Gacek, another graduate
senator, said that most graduate
senators are united by a focus on
addressing graduate students'
needs. Vague People's Platform
stands regarding graduate stu
dents and the fact that only one
party made any endorsements will
also cause graduate students to
vote on issues rather than party
endorsements, according to Grif
fin.
