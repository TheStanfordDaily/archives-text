The Daily's endorsements are based
on reviews of each organization's cur
rent and proposed budget, as well as
interviews with most groups.
AASA
$22,928 YES
This is the Asian-American Students
Association's first request for special
fees from the ASSU. In the past
several years, even without the money,
they have proven to be organized and
committed to serving the Asian-
American community.
ASSU Course Guide
$21,293 NO
While the course guide is an impor
tant resource for students, printed
copies are hard to come by and the
computer version is often confusing
and incomplete — once a student fi
nally finds it. Rather than use more
than $21,000 in special fees, the course
guide staff should be forced to reduce
their excessive costs.
ASSU Legal Counseling
$64,564 YES
Fighting it out with your landlord?
Caught for underage drinking? The
place to turn to for free advice is ASSU
Legal Counseling. An estimated 300
students take advantage of this inval
uable service every quarter.
ASSU Speakers Bureau
$85,912 YES
Operating under a $6,000 deficit
from last year, Speakers Bureau has
done an excellent job of getting big
name speakers at low prices this year.
Speakers such as Gloria Steinem, John
Updike and Robert MacFarlane — who
is speaking this month for one-fifth
of his regular fee — represent a variety
of disciplines and interests.
Barrio Assistance
$15,607 YES
Barrio Assistance brings elemenen
tary school-age students from East
Palo Alto to campus every Saturday
morning for a warm breakfast and
some one-on-one tutoring. Involving
58 Stanford students, the program
made a wise decision this year to no
longer call itself Chicanos in Public
Service (ChIPS). The name inac
curately suggested that only Chicano
students could take part.
Black Student Union
$25,745 YES
A group that can effectively mobilize
students, the BSU organizes diverse
political and cultural events. From a
South African activist's speech to a
soul food dinner, the BSU has tried
to reach the student body at large while
fostering a supportive environment for
Stanford's black community.
Chaparral
$10,318 YES
The Chappie is Stanford's 89-year
old student-produced humor magazine.
Although it lost its fee last year —
students felt it had been shabbily
produced and was rarely funny — its
creators have made marked improve
ments and reliably promise three or
four free issues of solid mirth.
Club Sports
$80,215 YES
Hundreds of students participate in
Club Sports like rugby, ice and field
hockey, crew, and many others which
the Athletic Department cannot afford
to support.
Graduate Student Assn.
$17,600 YES
Graduate students have it tough at
Stanford. They lack both the commu
nity support of a strong residence sys
tem and a common place to socialize.
Fortunately, the GSA helps to fills
those gaps.
KZSU Radio
$87,487 YES
KZSU provides a valuable service
not only for Stanford listeners but for

listeners from as far away as Oakland
and for students interested in learning
about running a radio station.
MEChA
$32,558 YES
Celebrating its 20th anniversary
next year, MEChA has a long history
of providing cultural and personal sup
port for Stanford's Hispanic commu
nity, while reaching out to the com
munity at large.
SEAS
$9,085 YES
Through its habitat restoration proj
ects and its work to preserve rain
forests, Students for Environmental
Action at Stanford has been leading
the move to protect the environment
both locally and globally.
SPOON Hunger Relief
$9,023 YES
Stanford food that would otherwise
go in the trash is going to feed the
hungry and homeless of Palo Alto,
thanks to the 23 Stanford dorms and
houses involved with SPOON.
Stanford Axe Committee
$34,000 YES
Dressed in their red shirts and ever
chained to the precious Axe, the Stan
ford Axe Committee has managed to
psyche up Stanford's often lukewarm
fans.
Stanford Band (LSJUMB)
$39,218 YES
"The World's Largest Rock 'n' Roll
Band" won't march in formation.
Won't play military marches. And we
wouldn't have it otherwise.
Stanford Concert Network
$40,000 YES
Jay Leno. The Grateful Dead. Mi
chael Hedges. The Crazy Eights. Zulu
Spear. Need we say more?
The Stanford Daily
$48,500 NEUTRAL
The Daily believes it is inappropriate
to endorse its own fee request.
Stanford in Government
$27,894 YES
SIG provides students with a valu
able connection to Washington, D.C.,
and to state and local governments by
bringing speakers to campus and pro
viding resources.
Stanford Women's Center
$18,333 YES
The forgotten minority at Stanford
can find a supportive environment at
the Women's Center. The center serves
as home base for the Rape Education
Project, women's self-defense classes
and many other women's groups.
SURE Escort Service
$49,045 NO
For the second consecutive year, The
Daily has found SURE escort service
to be the least cost-effective organiza
tion on campus. Although its mission
— to provide students with safe trans
portation at night — is laudable, cer
tainly it could be accomplished for less
than $49,000. Salaries for escorts, who
should volunteer their services, make
up the bulk of SURE's budget. A vote
against SURE's special fee does not
mean it will cease to exist. Rather,
the organization will rely on the Pro
gram Board for funding while learning
a lesson in management.
Tuesday Films
$22,847 YES
Playing to a packed house every
week for five years, Tuesday Films is
one of the most efficiently run student
organizations on campus. Because ad
mission to the films is free, organizers
get special rental rates on the films.
The Student Channel (XTV)
$27,799 YES
After losing last year's fee, XTV is
leaner, more efficient — and also in
dire need of modernization.
