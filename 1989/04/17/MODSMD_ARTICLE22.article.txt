## Seductions of the job hunt 
### 
THE EASIEST PERSON to seduce
is almost invariably oneself.
Unemployment has made me a
bit philosophical, but that really was the
lesson I learned after my first foray into
the job market.
It is a lesson I should have learned
four years ago, when I thought that
Princeton was the only university for me.
I saw the age of the buildings and the
fact that my brother, who is not very
much like me, liked it there, and I was
able to convince myself that I really could
learn to love New Jersey.
It took a rejection letter from them
and a year at Stanford to realize that it
wasn't really the right school for me. Of
course, it's more difficult to combat a
seduction when the object really does
want you, but sometimes the battle is
still important.
Nearly everyone has thought about
how nice it would be to be in the movies.
Actors and actresses have a seemingly
magical life. They are all glamorous, from
the ugliest to the most beautiful. But if
you can't act. si: 4 g or dance, how can you
join this elite group?
I thought that it would be a good idea
to try to be a screenwriter. I wrote to
all the production companies, and found
that Stanford does not open every door.
Paramount wanted me to be a secretary.
Lucasfilms wanted an intern, but only if
I would come back to Stanford for a fifth
year. Mary Tyler Moore didn't even need
me as a gofer.
The most positive response I got was
from a lower-level Warner Brothers ex
ecutive who told me that I should look

into a talent agency. I didn't have any
idea about what a talent agent actually
does, but the whole concept of working
with the movie stars of my imagination
made me want to do it.
It would be a tough time, the agency
director told me. I'd have to run errands,
read submissions, make coffee and basi
cally kiss up to every person who walked
through the agency doors.
I would be working 24-hour days,
seven-day weeks, and have no social life.
I would be treated like garbage despite
my class ring, I would be making $15,000
a year, including overtime, and I would
have few, if any, benefits. But I wanted
that job. Sean Connery used that agency,
you see.
I'm not trying to say that the movie
stars were the only attractions of the
job. Agents make 10 percent of what their
clients take in, and that's lots of money.
The offices were in the middle of an
exciting area in Los Angeles. And if I got
this job, I wouldn't have to do any more
interviews.
But location, being in"The Business,"
and laziness should not be the deciding
factors when it comes to getting a job.
This would be my entire life for a long
time. Did I know enough about what I
was getting into to make such a momen
tous decision? The answer to that one
was obviously "No." And the agency
people let me know that I should consider
my choice very carefully before giving
them an answer.
They didn't want someone beginning
such a rigorous program with only a
shaky understanding of the nature of

their business. They let me know in no
uncertain terms that being an agent isn't
all it's cracked up to be.
I was angry as hell at the agency for
telling me to go think about what I really
wanted to do with my life. But now that
I have had these two weeks to distance
myself from the seductive glamour of the
place, I see that he was right to do so.
Now, I could go back there and argue
until I am blue in the face that I really
am right for their agency. I could convince
them the same way I did myself, about
Princeton and about being an agent. But
what would be the point?
I know I want to do something, but it
isn't being an errands girl, or kowtowing
to people just because they have a long
list of movie credits under their belts.
But what made me so intent on proving
that it was right for me in the first place?
I realized even then that having a Stan
ford degree does a lot for you, but even
with that realization, I gained no real
feeling of self-worth. And maybe that's
the key to the seduction.
Doing something mindless that will
eventually seem glamorous to everyone
not involved is almost the ideal of every
one with low expectations. And being
seduced is a pretty mindless occupation.
