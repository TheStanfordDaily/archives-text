COP candidate's
criticism ofAASA
was unwarranted
On behalf of the Asian American
Student Association, I want to correct
the inaccurate description that Tony
Chor, member of the Students' Choice
slate for Council of Presidents, gave
about AASA. In an April 12 article,
"Chor noted that Asian American Stu
dent Association meetings are attended
by 15 to 20 people who supposedly
represent an Asian community of more
than 800."
AASA represents a wide range of
Asian-American student interests and
has a record of which we are proud.
Historically, the efforts exerted by
members of AASA have brought nu
merous benefits to Asian-American
students as well as to the entire
campus.
Without AASA's work, we wouldn't
have Okada House, the Tea House, an
Asian American Activities Center, an
Assistant Dean of Asian American Af
fairs, the only Asian-American history
class that is currently offered, the
Asian Pacific Heritage Celebration, the
Lunar New Year Celebration or
Rhythm of the Night.
This year's campaign for an Asian-
American history tenure-track profes
sorship is part of a continued effort to
represent the interests of the Asian-
American community as well as an
effort to improve the quality of educa
tion and life at Stanford for all people.
AASA not only works on these so
cial, cultural and political issues, but is
also an umbrella organization that
works in liaison with a number of
different Asian-American student organ
izations. Currently 23 such organiza
tions exist.
In light of this, it seems strange
that Chor, who even lists his member
ship in AASA as one of his qualifica
tions in the Election Pamphlet, should

attack AASA's ability to articulate the
needs and views of the Asian-American
community.
We are a growing organization that
welcomes input from all sectors of the
Stanford community, provided that it
is expressed in a respectful manner.
Our meetings are open to anyone and
serve as a forum for open debate and
discussion. If Chor wants to better
serve his community, he should work
with us and not attack us.

Foreign students on
financial aid have
unfair tax burden
At a time when most students are
scrambling to get their taxes filed,
foreign students on financial aid at
Stanford find themselves in a perplex
ing situation. Already burdened by
taxes withheld from their scholarship
monies, they are discovering that they
owe additional money to the IRS.
U.S. law forces them to pay more
tax money than most American stu
dents. The Financial Aids Office
refuses to include taxes as a legitimate
expense when calculating a student's
financial need. By doing so for all stu
dents, the financial aids office claims
to treat all students equitably and fair
ly-
However, not only does this policy
contradict the Financial Aids Office's
stated policy of meeting every student's
demonstrated need, it is also discrimi
natory against foreign students. Some
how, foreign students are expected to
produce the extra money, even though
they have no means of doing so, since
most of them are already expected to
work 20 hours a week.
