## Administration's silence hurts Stanford gays and lesbians 
### 
THE GAY, LESBIAN and bisexual
community has many obstacles
to overcome. But after many
years of observing the negative impact
of all of our enemies, I have come to
the conclusion that the greatest
weapon society uses against us, the
one that always tilts the odds in their
favor, is silence.
"It's okay to be gay," we're told,
"but keep it in the bedroom where it
belongs. Why do you have to talk
about it all the time? We don't." What
do they mean, they don't talk about it?
I suppose Valentine's Day is one of the
quietest holidays of the year, that
falling in love is about as exciting as
going to the supermarket, and that
weddings are considered fairly trivial
events. Face it, we talk about love all
the time.
Silence even finds its way into insti
tutions of higher learning. This year
marks the 10th anniversary of my
battle with University President Donald
Kennedy's silence and the resulting
silence of his administration. Here are
just a few highlights:
• In 1979 we saw an increasing
number of applicants who, like me,
were nervous about including refer
ences to our work in the gay commu
nity on applications. I led an effort to

convince the University to change its
nondiscrimination policy to include us
among the protected categories. Fred
Hargadon, then Dean of Undergraduate
Admissions, refused to even meet with
us because he found it "insulting to
have to make such a statement."
Other staff members were more open
to discussion, but in the end Kennedy
turned us down with an observation
that "a person's sexual orientation is a
matter of private concern" and there
fore not something to consider in
admissions, nor something to mention
in Stanford publications.
• In 1982 I applied for a position in
the Computer Science Department.
Unfortunately, the timing of their deci
sion coincided with the appearance of a
Daily article entitled, "On Being Gay:
Feelings and Perceptions," by Stuart
Reges.
Despite the protection afforded gays
by the faculty/staff policy that I knew
by rote, I was told, "We want to give
you the job, but we were concerned
about your article." When asked for
clarification, I was told, "It's embar
rassing for us to have you publish
articles about your personal life, and
we can't offer you the job unless you
promise not to do so in the future."
So I didn't for three years until a

new chairman arrived. I consider this
particular act of silence to be the most
cruel punishment Stanford ever in
flicted on me: threatening to deny me
a job I loved if I wouldn't keep secret
an aspect of my personality that
seemed as vital a part of me as my
ability to teach.
• At graduation in 1985, Kennedy
presented me with a Dinkelspiel Award
for, among other things, "the valuable
private time he steadily provides to
others, not only as a general adviser,
but also as a counselor at the Bridge."
Although they got the building right,
the actual organization that benefited
most from my efforts should have been
listed as "the Gay and Lesbian Coun
seling Group."
To this day I don't know whether
the words "gay and lesbian" were acci
dentally left off my award, whether
some well-intentioned idiot tried to
spare me the "embarrassment" of
being associated with those words in a
public assembly, or whether some
practical underling of Kennedy's
realized that he might choke on the
words in front of such a large group of
parents and donors.
• In 1986 Kennedy finally answered
a letter that I had written one year
earlier complaining about the wording

of my Dinkelspiel Award. I encouraged
him in making speeches about Stanford
diversity to "mention gay men and
lesbian women, especially to prospective
applicants and newly arrived fresh
men;" to "find out which of the faculty
and staff are openly gay, and talk
about them. Say that you admire their
courage;" and to "make it a goal to
have gay mentors in positions of au
thority."
His response was that, "I think we
probably have some real differences —
about whether, for example, the con
victions you press upon me would not
in the end result in my putting unfair
pressure on some gays to declare when
they are not ready, or to dissemble
when they would prefer not to."
I still don't understand his reason
ing. Should we stop talking about
Jewish people, in case there are some
who prefer to "pass"?
• 1986 was also the year that Stan
ford: A Centennial Chronology ap
peared. Inside was a tedious list of
newsworthy events of the past century,
including at least one milestone for
each group that Kennedy normally
includes on his diversity list.
But despite the meticulous
documentation gathered by Gerard
Koskovich of the Stanford Gay and

Lesbian Archives Project, no mention
of gay people appeared on any of the
31 pages. Not the surprising fact that
Branner Hall had an openly gay fresh
man in 1931 named Harry Hay who
went on to found one of the first gay
political organizations of this century;
not even the 1984 vandalism of the
Segal "Gay Liberation" statue that got
national media coverage.
Even now I can feel the silence
drowning out our voices. That's the
only explanation I have for under
standing how a group of masked pro
testers in front of Otero last spring
supporting a freshman's antigay behav
ior could end up being mentioned in a
report by the University Counsel's
office as an example of racism,
nowhere including the words "gay" or
"homophobia."
I would prefer to end this article on
an optimistic note, but sometimes the
silence seems so powerful that even my
shouting sounds weak and faltering.
I've come to realize that gay people
can't break the silence alone. If the
rest of you don't hear the truth faintly
whispering, I fear that I will be
silenced after all, along with all the
others.

nity on applications. I led an effort to

convince the University to change its
nondiscrimination policy to include us
among the protected categories. Fred
Hargadon, then Dean of Undergraduate
Admissions, refused to even meet with
us because he found it "insulting to
have to make such a statement."
Other staff members were more open
to discussion, but in the end Kennedy
turned us down with an observation
that "a person's sexual orientation is a
matter of private concern" and there
fore not something to consider in
admissions, nor something to mention
in Stanford publications.
• In 1982 I applied for a position in
the Computer Science Department.
Unfortunately, the timing of their deci
sion coincided with the appearance of a
Daily article entitled, "On Being Gay:
Feelings and Perceptions," by Stuart
Reges.
Despite the protection afforded gays
by the faculty/staff policy that I knew
by rote, I was told, "We want to give
you the job, but we were concerned
about your article." When asked for
clarification, I was told, "It's embar
rassing for us to have you publish
articles about your personal life, and
we can't offer you the job unless you
promise not to do so in the future."
So I didn't for three years until a

new chairman arrived. I consider this
particular act of silence to be the most
cruel punishment Stanford ever in
flicted on me: threatening to deny me
a job I loved if I wouldn't keep secret
an aspect of my personality that
seemed as vital a part of me as my
ability to teach.
• At graduation in 1985, Kennedy
presented me with a Dinkelspiel Award
for, among other things, "the valuable
private time he steadily provides to
others, not only as a general adviser,
but also as a counselor at the Bridge."
Although they got the building right,
the actual organization that benefited
most from my efforts should have been
listed as "the Gay and Lesbian Coun
seling Group."
To this day I don't know whether
the words "gay and lesbian" were acci
dentally left off my award, whether
some well-intentioned idiot tried to
spare me the "embarrassment" of
being associated with those words in a
public assembly, or whether some
practical underling of Kennedy's
realized that he might choke on the
words in front of such a large group of
parents and donors.
• In 1986 Kennedy finally answered
a letter that I had written one year
earlier complaining about the wording

of my Dinkelspiel Award. I encouraged
him in making speeches about Stanford
diversity to "mention gay men and
lesbian women, especially to prospective
applicants and newly arrived fresh
men;" to "find out which of the faculty
and staff are openly gay, and talk
about them. Say that you admire their
courage;" and to "make it a goal to
have gay mentors in positions of au
thority."
His response was that, "I think we
probably have some real differences —
about whether, for example, the con
victions you press upon me would not
in the end result in my putting unfair
pressure on some gays to declare when
they are not ready, or to dissemble
when they would prefer not to."
I still don't understand his reason
ing. Should we stop talking about
Jewish people, in case there are some
who prefer to "pass"?
• 1986 was also the year that Stan
ford: A Centennial Chronology ap
peared. Inside was a tedious list of
newsworthy events of the past century,
including at least one milestone for
each group that Kennedy normally
includes on his diversity list.
But despite the meticulous
documentation gathered by Gerard
Koskovich of the Stanford Gay and

Lesbian Archives Project, no mention
of gay people appeared on any of the
31 pages. Not the surprising fact that
Branner Hall had an openly gay fresh
man in 1931 named Harry Hay who
went on to found one of the first gay
political organizations of this century;
not even the 1984 vandalism of the
Segal "Gay Liberation" statue that got
national media coverage.
Even now I can feel the silence
drowning out our voices. That's the
only explanation I have for under
standing how a group of masked pro
testers in front of Otero last spring
supporting a freshman's antigay behav
ior could end up being mentioned in a
report by the University Counsel's
office as an example of racism,
nowhere including the words "gay" or
"homophobia."
I would prefer to end this article on
an optimistic note, but sometimes the
silence seems so powerful that even my
shouting sounds weak and faltering.
I've come to realize that gay people
can't break the silence alone. If the
rest of you don't hear the truth faintly
whispering, I fear that I will be
silenced after all, along with all the
others.

THE GAY, LESBIAN and bisexual
community has many obstacles
to overcome. But after many
years of observing the negative impact
of all of our enemies, I have come to
the conclusion that the greatest
weapon society uses against us, the
one that always tilts the odds in their
favor, is silence.
"It's okay to be gay," we're told,
"but keep it in the bedroom where it
belongs. Why do you have to talk
about it all the time? We don't." What
do they mean, they don't talk about it?
I suppose Valentine's Day is one of the
quietest holidays of the year, that
falling in love is about as exciting as
going to the supermarket, and that
weddings are considered fairly trivial
events. Face it, we talk about love all
the time.
Silence even finds its way into insti
tutions of higher learning. This year
marks the 10th anniversary of my
battle with University President Donald
Kennedy's silence and the resulting
silence of his administration. Here are
just a few highlights:
• In 1979 we saw an increasing
number of applicants who, like me,
were nervous about including refer
ences to our work in the gay commu
nity on applications. I led an effort to

convince the University to change its
nondiscrimination policy to include us
among the protected categories. Fred
Hargadon, then Dean of Undergraduate
