## Stanford group keeps close tabs on national service legislation 
### John Wagner Editorial staff 
As Congress pulls back and
forth in a legislative tug-of-war
to compromise on a national
service bill, at least one group
of students at Stanford is watch
ing with a special interest.
Since last fall, members of the
Stanford Project on National
Service have been tracking the
wide array of national service
proposals coming out of Wash
ington, D.C..
According to project member
Greg Maget, the group is at
tempting to improve the percep
tion of public service at Stanford
and to encourage federal and
state officials to establish pro
grams that will lend "a common
thread" to public service oppor
tunities for students.
Maget said he also hopes the
efforts of the project will make
students and faculty more aware
of the service proposals and
stimulate debate about their
merit.
While the project members
have yet to endorse any of the
more than half-dozen national

service bills, they have con
structed a set of criteria which
they feel should be contained in
a service bill (see box). Accord
ing to Maget, these criteria
should be "absolutes" for any
legislation that is passed by
Congress.
Maget said the project may
endorse a particular bill either
later this quarter or next fall.

In an effort to determine what
students want in a service pro
gram, project members recently
conducted a survey of Stanford
students. According to survey
author Julie Plaut, results will
soon be presented at Congres
sional hearings for some of the
bills under consideration.
Preliminary survey results
have indicated several clear
trends:
• The vast majority of stu
dents (89.5 percent) support a
national service program in
which service is a voluntary op
tion and only one form of college
financial assistance.
• Very few (6.2 percent) sup
port a program which is volun
tary but makes public service
the only form of college financial
aid. The Nunn-McCurdy pro
posal falls into this category.
• Of those who do support the
principles of the Nunn-McCurdy
bill, 92.3 percent do not receive
any loans to help finance their
education.
• Of those who do receive
loans to help finance their ed
ucation, 78 percent oppose the
principles of Nunn-McCurdy.


In a recent survey conducted by the Stanford Project on National
Service, students were asked if they supported or opposed each
of the above four combinations of conditions attatched to national
service legislation. The Nunn-McCurdy proposal falls under the
category of voluntary service/only form of aid.
