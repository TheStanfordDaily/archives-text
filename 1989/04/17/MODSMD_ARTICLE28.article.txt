April 19, 1906
The Daily Palo Alto
University President David
Starr Jordan announced the
immediate closing of Stanford
for the remainder of the aca
demic year in the wake of the
mcgor earthquake which shook
the Bay Area April 18.
Jordan instructed professors
to report students' credits and
grades as if they had completed
the semester. Provisions for
special exams, both in the
spring and at the beginning of
fall term were made for stu
dents of "doubtful standing."
However, Jordan declared, "all
class work in Stanford Univer
sity shall be suspended for the
rest of the college year."
On campus the earthquake
killed one student and one staff
member, and injured six
others. Witnesses reported ex
tensive damage to campus
buildings, including the

destruction of Memorial Arch,
the landmark entrance to the
Quad.
April 20, 1965
The Stanford Daily
John Bacon, a Stanford
junior, returned to campus
after three months of solitary
confinement in a Czechoslovak
ian jail. Bacon had just com
pleted a six month term at the
Stanford-in-Germany campus
when Czech police arrested him
for trying to smuggle an East
German student into West Ger
many.
"He seemed like the kind of
person I would want to help,"
Bacon said of the East German
student. Czech border guards
discovered the hidden student,
and Bacon was promptly taken
to a military institution and
then to Pilsen prison.
Bacon was released one week
short of the end of his three
month sentence.
