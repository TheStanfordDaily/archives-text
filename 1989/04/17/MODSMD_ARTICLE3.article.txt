# 22 student groups bid for ASSU special fees
## 
### Martha Brockenbrough Staff writer 
With the finan
cial futures of their
organizations hang
ing in the balance,
ASSU Special Fee
applicants are ner
vously anticipating
the results of the

upcoming elections.
Twenty-two groups are applying
for funding packages ranging
from $9,023 to $87,487 in this
week's elections. The total fees
requested amount to $789,971 —
an $18,038 increase from last
year.
Groups seeking more than
$4,000 apply for a special fee re
quest while groups with smaller
budgets apply for funding through
the ASSU Programing Board or
the ASSU Publications Board.
The competition for special fee
requests last year contained more
surprises than usual. For in
stance, the Black Student Union,
which usually gains its special fee
request easily, was eight votes shy

of a mcyority vote until the over
seas ballots were counted and
guaranteed the fee request.
BSU Spokesperson and sopho
more Louis Jackson blamed his
organization's close finish on an
anti-BSU "backlash" which he
said rocked the campus last
spring.
"Our profile is not as high, and
(the BSU has not had) as much
negative coverage at The Daily
this year, and that puts us in a
good position" to win the assess
ment for next year, Jackson said.
In addition, last year Stanford's
historic satire magazine, The
Chaparral, was denied its $9,873
request along with X-TV, Stan
ford's student-run cable network.
To improve their chances in this
spring's elections, The Chaparral
distributed complementary copies
of its 90th Anniversary Edition.
After its defeat last year, X-TV
was forced to use money left over
from the previous year and funds
solicited through the Program

ming Board to finance current op
erations.
General Manager and sopho
more Max Sheika said the 3-year
old organization will be in trouble
if it does not receive support in
this election. "Seventy-five per
cent of the money would go
towards equipment," he said.
"Ours is 20 years old — it's mostly
donated and it's all breaking."
Shoka said X-TV has done "a
little more campaigning, and has
a more visible profile" because of
new programs like "Love Links"
and the "Video Year Book."
The list of applicants for Special
Fee Requests also includes several
first-time solicitors.
Of the new applicants, the
Asian-American Students Associ
ation is weighing in with the
largest request — $22,928.
Spokesperson Quynh Tran, a
junior, said in the past AASA has
applied to the Programming
Board and sent individual fund
raisers out to secure money for

their events. "But AASA has
grown a lot," Tran said. "Many
new organizations have formed"
within the group.
Some of these new organiza
tions include the Stanford Uni
versity Nikkei — a Japanese
student organization, the Thai
Club, the Undergraduate Chinese
American Association and the
Vietnamese Student Association.
Because AASA co-sponsors
events with smaller organizations
such as these, funding awarded
to AASA would go to these groups.
"We recognize that, although we
are different, there is a tie among
Asians, and we co-sponsor (events)
because of our similarities," Tran
said.
The two other new applicants
for fee requests are Students for
Environmental Action at Stan
ford, and SPOON — the Stanford
Project on Nutrition.
SEAS spokesperson and junior
Robert Abrams said the 2-year-old
organization has "grown suffi
ciently, and is reasonably well
known enough that it is an
opportune time" to apply for a
special fee.
Abrams said the 25- to 50-

member organization exists so
that "anyone interested in initi
ating a new project (with an en
vironmental focus), or anyone who
wants to help out on an existing
one, can have more impact than
they would if they were working
individually."
Founded in October 1987,
SPOON delivers leftover food
from 26 on-campus residences to
local soup kitchens and food
banks. The organization staffs 75
volunteers.
Spokesperson Amira Leifer
said, "It was getting difficult ap
plying for money every few weeks
(from the Programing Board), and
then not being sure if we would
have it or not."
"Long-range planning is impos
sible" without special funding
from the ASSU, Leifer said. "If
we don't get [the funding] we are
not going to be able to expand as
much as we'd like."
Two organizations have
changed their names since last
year. Barrio Assistance — the
East Palo Alto tutoring program
— used to be called ChIPS, and
MEChA was known as SALSA.

if it does not receive support in
this election. "Seventy-five per
cent of the money would go
towards equipment," he said.
"Ours is 20 years old — it's mostly
donated and it's all breaking."
Shoka said X-TV has done "a
little more campaigning, and has
a more visible profile" because of
new programs like "Love Links"
and the "Video Year Book."
The list of applicants for Special
Fee Requests also includes several
first-time solicitors.
Of the new applicants, the
Asian-American Students Associ
ation is weighing in with the
largest request — $22,928.
Spokesperson Quynh Tran, a
junior, said in the past AASA has
applied to the Programming
Board and sent individual fund
raisers out to secure money for

their events. "But AASA has
grown a lot," Tran said. "Many
new organizations have formed"
within the group.
Some of these new organiza
tions include the Stanford Uni
versity Nikkei — a Japanese
student organization, the Thai
Club, the Undergraduate Chinese
American Association and the
Vietnamese Student Association.
Because AASA co-sponsors
events with smaller organizations
such as these, funding awarded
to AASA would go to these groups.
"We recognize that, although we
are different, there is a tie among
Asians, and we co-sponsor (events)
because of our similarities," Tran
said.
The two other new applicants
for fee requests are Students for
Environmental Action at Stan
ford, and SPOON — the Stanford
Project on Nutrition.
SEAS spokesperson and junior
Robert Abrams said the 2-year-old
organization has "grown suffi
ciently, and is reasonably well
known enough that it is an
opportune time" to apply for a
special fee.
Abrams said the 25- to 50-

member organization exists so
that "anyone interested in initi
ating a new project (with an en
vironmental focus), or anyone who
wants to help out on an existing
one, can have more impact than
they would if they were working
individually."
Founded in October 1987,
SPOON delivers leftover food
from 26 on-campus residences to
local soup kitchens and food
banks. The organization staffs 75
volunteers.
Spokesperson Amira Leifer
said, "It was getting difficult ap
plying for money every few weeks
(from the Programing Board), and
then not being sure if we would
have it or not."
"Long-range planning is impos
sible" without special funding
from the ASSU, Leifer said. "If
we don't get [the funding] we are
not going to be able to expand as
much as we'd like."
Two organizations have
changed their names since last
year. Barrio Assistance — the
East Palo Alto tutoring program
— used to be called ChIPS, and
MEChA was known as SALSA.
With the finan
cial futures of their
organizations hang
ing in the balance,
ASSU Special Fee
applicants are ner
vously anticipating
the results of the

upcoming elections.
Twenty-two groups are applying
for funding packages ranging
from $9,023 to $87,487 in this
week's elections. The total fees
requested amount to $789,971 —
an $18,038 increase from last
year.
Groups seeking more than
$4,000 apply for a special fee re
quest while groups with smaller
budgets apply for funding through
the ASSU Programing Board or
the ASSU Publications Board.
The competition for special fee
requests last year contained more
surprises than usual. For in
stance, the Black Student Union,
which usually gains its special fee
request easily, was eight votes shy

of a mcyority vote until the over
seas ballots were counted and
guaranteed the fee request.
BSU Spokesperson and sopho
more Louis Jackson blamed his
organization's close finish on an
anti-BSU "backlash" which he
said rocked the campus last
spring.
"Our profile is not as high, and
(the BSU has not had) as much
negative coverage at The Daily
this year, and that puts us in a
good position" to win the assess
ment for next year, Jackson said.
In addition, last year Stanford's
historic satire magazine, The
Chaparral, was denied its $9,873
request along with X-TV, Stan
ford's student-run cable network.
To improve their chances in this
spring's elections, The Chaparral
distributed complementary copies
of its 90th Anniversary Edition.
After its defeat last year, X-TV
was forced to use money left over
from the previous year and funds
solicited through the Program

ming Board to finance current op
erations.
General Manager and sopho
more Max Sheika said the 3-year
old organization will be in trouble
if it does not receive support in
this election. "Seventy-five per
cent of the money would go
towards equipment," he said.
"Ours is 20 years old — it's mostly
donated and it's all breaking."
Shoka said X-TV has done "a
