### Martha Brockenbrough Staff writer 
With the finan
cial futures of their
organizations hang
ing in the balance,
ASSU Special Fee
applicants are ner
vously anticipating
the results of the

upcoming elections.
Twenty-two groups are applying
for funding packages ranging
from $9,023 to $87,487 in this
week's elections. The total fees
requested amount to $789,971 â€”
an $18,038 increase from last
year.
Groups seeking more than
$4,000 apply for a special fee re
quest while groups with smaller
budgets apply for funding through
the ASSU Programing Board or
the ASSU Publications Board.
The competition for special fee
requests last year contained more
surprises than usual. For in
stance, the Black Student Union,
which usually gains its special fee
request easily, was eight votes shy

of a mcyority vote until the over
seas ballots were counted and
guaranteed the fee request.
BSU Spokesperson and sopho
more Louis Jackson blamed his
organization's close finish on an
anti-BSU "backlash" which he
said rocked the campus last
spring.
"Our profile is not as high, and
(the BSU has not had) as much
negative coverage at The Daily
this year, and that puts us in a
good position" to win the assess
ment for next year, Jackson said.
In addition, last year Stanford's
historic satire magazine, The
Chaparral, was denied its $9,873
request along with X-TV, Stan
ford's student-run cable network.
To improve their chances in this
spring's elections, The Chaparral
distributed complementary copies
of its 90th Anniversary Edition.
After its defeat last year, X-TV
was forced to use money left over
from the previous year and funds
solicited through the Program
