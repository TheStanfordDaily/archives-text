## Spiker's rally falls short against No. 1 Bruins 
### John Kirks Staff writer 
It was the stuff out of which champion
ship teams, championship seasons are
made. A huge early deficit against the No.
1-ranked team in the nation. A mighty
comeback. A rowdy crowd of 3,000 plus on
hand at Maples that, with each step the
Cardinal gained on the leading UCLA team,
got crazier and more delirious.
But, the storybook ending was not to be.
Stanford came up short, losing 11-15 in
the deciding fifth game.

The Cardinal dressing room after the
match was a somber sight. Setter Parker
Blackman sat frozen, contemplating plays
in the game that could have but did not
fall in the Cardinal's favor.
John Alstrom, despite surfacing from rel
ative anonymity in 1989 to play an inspi
rational match, refused to comment on the
loss. Everyone else, if they spoke at all,
spoke in soft, reserved voices.
Why all the tension? The loss to UCLA
was just another regular season loss. Or
was it?
Junior hitter Craig Forsyth did not think
so. "There was nothing positive about
tonight's loss," he said. "The comeback
came up short. We expected to win."
Captain Scott Fortune, despite acknowl
edging the pain that the team was experi
encing, held a slightly brighter outlook.
"Hey, we played right with this team,
and they're a very good team," Fortune
said. "If a few more breaks had fallen our
way, the result might have been different.
We've got to gather ourselves together, go
down there and play them tough."
Fortune was referring to the immediate
rematch the Cardinal will have against the
Bruins on Wednesday. Stanford's hopes of
a Western Intercollegiate Volleyball Asso
ciation title, which were dimmed after Sat
urday night's loss, would be rekindled with

a Cardinal victory in Pauley Pavillion.
Fortune commented on his team's
chances, saying, "Of course its going to be
tough to go down there and beat them,
but we definitely feel like we have a food
chance."
The loss to UCLA came on the heels of
an impressive, three-game sweep of the
upstart Long Beach State 49ers on Friday
night.
The Cardinal rode strong hitting
performances by Duncan Blackman (.364
percentage) and Dan Hanan (.543 percent
age) to the victory. And the stage was set
for the match against the UCLi\ Bruins,
a match that was built up as the battle
for the WIVA title.
The Cardinal got out of the gate slowly
against the Bruins; the UCLA mystique
seemed to have Stanford's younger players
a bit rattled. After spotting UCLA the first
two games (15-6 and 15-11) though, the
Cardinal was able to shake the inhibitions
it had in the early going, and the comeback
was on.
Stanford won the next two games, 15-11
and 15-8.
It was almost perfect, as the Cardinal
stormed back. Scott Fortune, as he is wont
to do, turned it on in the clutch, arguably
hitting as well as he has hit since his
season-high performance against UC-Santa
Barbara.
John Alstrom hit .626 for the match,
doing more than his share to keep the
Cardinal in the hunt. Dan Hanan hit .387
for the match, and his ever-present contri
bution was there as well.
The crowd was electrified as Stanford
erased the two-game deficit. But UCLA
defended its No. 1 ranking admirably in
game five as the Cardinal charge sputtered.
In fact, the Cardinal outhit the visitors
.341 to .264 for the entire match. But,
UCLA fell back on its strongest weapon:
its blocking. The Bruins put the clamp on
Stanford's swingers, tallying an impressive
33 blocks for the match. Stanford was able
to notch only 17.

Stanford won the next two games, 15-11
and 15-8.
It was almost perfect, as the Cardinal
stormed back. Scott Fortune, as he is wont
to do, turned it on in the clutch, arguably
hitting as well as he has hit since his
season-high performance against UC-Santa
Barbara.
John Alstrom hit .626 for the match,
doing more than his share to keep the
Cardinal in the hunt. Dan Hanan hit .387
for the match, and his ever-present contri
bution was there as well.
The crowd was electrified as Stanford
erased the two-game deficit. But UCLA
defended its No. 1 ranking admirably in
game five as the Cardinal charge sputtered.
In fact, the Cardinal outhit the visitors
.341 to .264 for the entire match. But,
UCLA fell back on its strongest weapon:
its blocking. The Bruins put the clamp on
Stanford's swingers, tallying an impressive
33 blocks for the match. Stanford was able
to notch only 17.
