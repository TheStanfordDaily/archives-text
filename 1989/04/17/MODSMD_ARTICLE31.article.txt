# Passing, blocking fail squad
## 
### Evan Tuchinsky Senior staff writer 
Special teams — they win football games, and
they can lose volleyball matches.
Saturday night at Maples Pavilion, special teams
devastated the Stanford men's volleyball team. De
spite outhitting and outdigging the top-ranked
Bruins, the Cardinal could not complement the effort
with the supporting skills of blocking, passing and
serving.
In volleyball, there is no special unit that jogs
on the court when the team needs a key block or
a clean pass. A coach can make a situational sub
stitution occasionally but must depend on the bal
ance of his starters to consistently make the im
portant plays.
This just did not happen for Stanford in the
UCLA match, and the intermittent gasping put the
home team at a disadvantage that not even the
supportive crowd could compensate for. Stanford's
prolific hitters and timely digs prevented premature
elimination, but the absence of an overbearing block
and consistent serve receive made winning the match
difficult.
Passing difficulties struck right at the outset of
the match, giving UCLA an immediate edge. Neither
Scott Fortune nor Duncan Blackman made a set
table pass until UCLA's score reached double digits
giving setter Parker Blackman no opportunities to
set up anything but a hurried transition offense.
The team steadied out as the match progressed,
but passing problems hung like an evil specter over
Stanford for the whole three hours. All told, the
Cardinal made a disappointing nine reception errors
to the Bruins' five.
"I thought we had a mediocre passing perform
ance," Stanford Coach Fred Sturm said. "UCLA's
a tough serving team, and we had an off night
passing. That (passing) is really important to us."
As is serving, another Cardinal difficulty. Stanford
sailed a total of 18 serves out of play, relinquishing
key scoring opportunities and — even more costly
— putting the ball back in UCLA's hands.
But the most telling statistic was blocking. The
Bruins outblocked the Cardinal 33-17, an astound
ing figure. For every block that the Cardinal mus-
tered, UCLA answered with two;
this, above all else, made the dif
ference.
The Bruins are noted for their
excellent blocking, so their hefty
tally is no real surprise. Every
single UCLA starter recorded at

least four block assists against
Stanford, demonstrating that the
Bruins have no weak blocking
alignments, no rotation where
they are particularly vulnerable.
Stanford could not duplicate the
opponent's net-defense domi
nance. Even with Dan Hanan and
Fortune recording a good amount
of blocks, overall the Cardinal
block was unfruitful.

Stanford faces the Bruins again
on Wednesday. With several days
to practice and iron out the weak
nesses, special teams may well re
emerge in a winning role.
