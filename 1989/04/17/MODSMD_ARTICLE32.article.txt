LOS ANGELES - The spell
that the Stanford baseball team
had cast over the USC Trojans
was finally broken yesterday as
the Cardinal was defeated 10-4 at
Rod Dedeaux Field.

Baseball
Cardinal takes two of three

Stanford had won its previous
three meetings with Troy, includ
ing the first two of this weekend's
series. The Cardinal is now 19-23
overall and 7-14 in Pacific 10 Con
ference Southern Division play.
The Trojans are 31-19, 11-10.
While Stanford has yet to win
a series against the other four
teams in the Six- Pac, it has won
four of six from USC this season.
"We're expected to beat USC,"
reserve center fielder Jack Hollis
said. "You're looking for the mis
take their gonna make to lose the
game. It's in their heads."
But it was the Cardinal that
made the mistakes yesterday to
allow the Trojans to pull ahead.
In the bottom of the fourth inning
with Stanford leading 2-1, the
normally sure-handed second
baseman Frank Carey booted a
ground ball from Murph Proctor
that allowed two Trojans to score.
On the next play, Mike Robert
son grounded to first baseman
David McCarty who fired it home,
but catcher Troy Tallman could
not hold onto the ball in the col

lision with the runner and every
body was safe. The Trojans ended
up with four runs in the inning,
three of them unearned, and
never looked back.
"We played very sloppy defense
in that (the fourth) inning, and
gave them two or three extra
outs," Stanford Coach Mark Mar
quess said. "We played well here,
we just didn't play well today,"
he added.
Steve Chitren (4-3) took the
mound for Stanford yesterday,
despite pitching 2Vb innings Fri
day to get the win. Chitren pitched
well through the third inning, al
lowing one unearned run and two
hits.
Paul Carey generated the offen
sive excitement for the Cardinal
by stroking a huge two-run home
run onto the upper deck of a four
story parking garage behind the
right-field fence. It was Carey's
team-leading ninth round-tripper
of the year
In Saturday's game, Stanford
bludgeoned the Trojans 15-5 be
hind great hitting and a heroic
pitching performance by Brian
Keyser (4-3). Keyser came in to
relieve starter Steve Worrell with
the bases loaded and one out in
the first. He induced right fielder
Corey Aurand to ground into a
double play to end the inning.
"When I came in I wasn't really
loose yet after pitching a lot at
Arizona State, but I threw sliders
and got the double play," Keyser
said.
By the end of the game, Keyser
amassed a career-high 10 strike
outs, and he struck out the side

in the eighth inning. "I had all
my stuff working today. I didn't
strike anyone out with my fast
ball, but I made them respect it,
and then got them with the curve
and the slider," he said.
Everyone hit for the Cardinal
in the 17-hit extravaganza. David

Holbrook and Paul Carey had four
hits apiece while McCarty, who
came in for Brian Johnson in the
top of the seventh, had a two-run
home run and three RBI.
Friday night, Paul Carey played
the role of offensive hero as he
has so many times in his career.

The junior right fielder had batted
in five of the Cardinal's seven
runs on the night and untied the
score in the top of the ninth with
a three-run moonshot over the

365-foot marker in right-center
field that put Stanford up 7-4.
"Obviously they didn't see me

on ESPN," Carey said, "otherwise
they wouldn't have brought in the
lefty (John Cummings, who came
in to pitch to Carey)."
Stan Spencer started the game
for the Cardinal and pitched into
the seventh inning, holding the
Trojans to four runs on eight hits.

Chitren came in for Spencer in
the bottom of the seventh, and
gave Marquess a scare in the
eighth with the score tied at four
when he loaded the bases with
one out and then proceeded to
strike out two in a row before
getting a groundout.
