# Carey heats up

LOS ANGELES - John Platz,
radio broadcaster for KCBS and
KZSU, has this theory about Paul
Carey, the Cardinal's top RBl
man.
"John thinks that since I'm
from back East, where I didn't
start playing baseball till real late
(because of the weather), I don't
start hitting till late April and
May. I'm usually playing hockey
in January, February and
March."
After 34 games last season,
Stanford's right fielder was bat
ting .262 with no home runs, 14
RBI and a .303 slugging percent
age. Over the last 35, Carey hit
.386 with 12 homers, 42 RBI and
a .717 slugging percentage.
1989 again saw Carey start off
slowly, but the left-handed slugger
has found his home-run swing just
in time to spark a Cardinal team
that had sunk to depths unseen
in the championship years of '87
and '88.
Carey's offensive heroics over
the weekend at USC led Stanford
to two wins in three games after
the Cardinal was swept the week
end before at Arizona State.
"P.C." took matters into his
own hands on Friday, going 3-for
-4 with a three-run homer, two
singles and five RBI in all as Stan
