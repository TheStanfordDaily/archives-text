# Carey heats up
## 
### Robert Portnoy Senior staff writer 
LOS ANGELES - John Platz,
radio broadcaster for KCBS and
KZSU, has this theory about Paul
Carey, the Cardinal's top RBl
man.
"John thinks that since I'm
from back East, where I didn't
start playing baseball till real late
(because of the weather), I don't
start hitting till late April and
May. I'm usually playing hockey
in January, February and
March."
After 34 games last season,
Stanford's right fielder was bat
ting .262 with no home runs, 14
RBI and a .303 slugging percent
age. Over the last 35, Carey hit
.386 with 12 homers, 42 RBI and
a .717 slugging percentage.
1989 again saw Carey start off
slowly, but the left-handed slugger
has found his home-run swing just
in time to spark a Cardinal team
that had sunk to depths unseen
in the championship years of '87
and '88.
Carey's offensive heroics over
the weekend at USC led Stanford
to two wins in three games after
the Cardinal was swept the week
end before at Arizona State.
"P.C." took matters into his
own hands on Friday, going 3-for
-4 with a three-run homer, two
singles and five RBI in all as Stan
ford defeated the Trojans 7-4.
Saturday, he grounded out
twice before banging out four con
secutive hits, two singles and two
doubles. As he is wont to do, Carey
sprayed the ball everywhere, dou
bling over the center fielder's head
in right-center, shooting another
into the gap in left-center and
twice singling sharply to right.
In a losing cause on Sunday,
Carey unloaded his ninth homer

of the season, a mammoth two
run blast that landed on top of a
four-story parking structure be
yond the rightfield fence. Oakland
A's basher Mark McGwire, who
played his college ball for USC,
is the only other player in history
to have put one up there.
The Cardinal slugger insists
that it's all in his head.
"Confidence. That's the whole
thing about hitting. Early in the
year, I didn't feel like I could hit
shit. Now I go up there and I feel
like I can't get out," Carey said.
Designated hitter Tim Griffin,

currently mired in a slump of his
own, says he was never worried
about Carey's early-season skid.
"He's just so good, it was only
a matter of time," Griffin said.
To hear left fielder Brian
Johnson tell it, Carey simply
stopped wondering what was
wrong and attacked the baseball.
"He's not thinking about any
thing. It got to a point where he
got so frustrated, he just forgot
about everything and started
hacking. That's the best way to
get out of a slump," he said.
