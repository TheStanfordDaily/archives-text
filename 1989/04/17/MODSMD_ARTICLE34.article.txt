# All-Americans lead 6th-place NCAA finish
## 
### Mark Smoyer Senior staff writer 
Although the Stanford men's gymnastics
team came up short of its goal at this week
end's NCAA Championships in Lincoln, Neb.,
three of the Cardinal managed to salvage
something positive from the competition with
impressive showings at Saturday's individual
finals.

Saturday afternoon, junior Conrad
Voorsanger and freshman Tim Ryan gave su
perb performances in the compulsory finals
to take fifth and sixth places respectively in
the all-around individual championships.
At that evening's event finals, Ryan and
senior Scott Schaffer each achieved All-
American status on the parallel bars. Ryan
tied for second place with a 9.70 score, one
tenth ahead of Schaffer, who took fourth.
The all-around competition is a rigorous
ordeal which establishes the nation's best col
legiate gymnasts. It is a combination of indi
viduals' scores during the team preliminaries
and the compulsory finals and demands con
sistency through a total of 18 routines. The

fifth and sixth place finishes by Voorsanger
and Ryan were appropriate season finales for
Stanford's most valuable performers.
Schaffer, who has been this reporter's most
loyal informant over the four years each has
dedicated to Stanford gymnastics, was awoken
from a well-deserved nap yesterday for a final
interview and provided some perspective on
the meet.
"I'm not disappointed," Schaffer said. "It's
kind of a strange feeling now that my college
career is over; there's no way I can walk away
from 15 years of gymnastics, although right
now I'm not sure my body can take much
more.
"We placed three All-Americans — that's
pretty positive," Schaffer added. "(As is) the
fact that Tim (Ryan) made such a strong
showing as a freshman, especially coming from
behind."
Hope for the future is indeed strong. Junior
co-captain Adam Forman, after an ii\jury
riddled regular season, remarkably recovered
to take 14th in the all-around standings. Only
Schaffer and senior co-captain Andy Ropp will
not be returning to the team next year.
Stanford, making its fourth trip in five years
to the collegiate championships, finished sixth
this year. That placing at Thursday's prelim
inaries left the team out of Friday night's
three-way final. In past years, the Cardinal
has finished third (1986), fourth (1988) and

finishes by Voorsanger

seventh (1985).
Thursday Stanford effectively lost its chance
to advance to the team finals by scoring more
than two points lower than it had expected
to on the high bar. Schaffer said the Cardinal
gymnasts were surprised and depressed by
the low scores it received.
"(Coach Sadao Hamada) tried to give us a
pep talk," Schaffer said, "but I think every
body pretty much lost hope after high bar. It
was, after all, a very low score."
The Fighting Illini of Illinois won the team
finals, taking their ninth NCAA title (but
their first since 1958) with a score of 283.40
over host Nebraska (282.30) and Minnesota
(280.55). Two other Pacific 10 Conference
teams had joined Stanford in the loser's
bracket Thursday. UCLA finished three-tenths
out of the final in fourth. Arizona State placed
eighth among the 10 teams.
