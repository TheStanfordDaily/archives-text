# Men's tennis crushes Arizona, ASU
## Home court advantage aids victories over Pac-10 Conference foes 
### Cameron Macky Senior staff writer 
Comparing the average tennis
crowd with, say, the average vol
leyball crowd is like comparing
the fans at a Carnegie Hall per
formance with the ones at a typ
ical Bon Jovi concert.
One group watches silently,
picking and choosing the times to
applaud politely. The other group
screams its collective head off.
However, although rowdy fans at
volleyball (and basketball) games
are more noted for the ability,
both types of crowds are more
than capable of contributing to a
home-court advantage.

Men's Tennis
Cardinal 7, Sun Devils 2
Cardinal 8, Wildcats 1

The Stanford men's tennis
team's matches this weekend
against No. 25 Arizona State and
No. 13 Arizona were a case in
point. Two weeks ago, on the road
in Arizona, the Cardinal had to
scrape, claw and scratch its way
to a pair of 5-4 wins.
The second time around was a
breeze in comparison, as Stanford
wrapped up the ASU match in
the first doubles contest to be
completed, and finished off the
Wildcats in singles — the first

time in 1989 that the Cardinal
has sealed a Pacific 10 Conference
win without being forced to play
doubles.
"I'm very, very pleased with our
play," Stanford Coach Dick Gould
said. "Especially when you re
member that both these teams
gave us fits down there — in fact,
we were lucky to come away with
two wins [in Arizona]."
The Cardinal's home-court edge
(Stanford is 9-0 at home in 1989)
is not lost on Gould. "The crowd
has been very good," he said. "It
really does help the guys."
If the crowd keeps helping, the
Cardinal will be in pretty good
shape. The team is at home for
the rest of the season, except for

the Pac-10 singles championships,
which will be held in Ojai, Calif.
April 27-30.
Provided that the team keeps
playing as it did this weekend,
visitors will be hard-pressed to
come away with a win. Stanford
was in control of both matches
from start to finish, dominating
both ASU and Arizona in singles
and closing with solid perform
ances from — for the first time
in a while — all three doubles
squads.
Friday's match against Arizona
State was a showcase for Jeff
Tarango, who tooled Brian Gyetko
6-0, 6-4. Tarango returned serve
brilliantly, completely erasing any
Gyetko serving advantage.
Gyetko's returns found the net
time and time again.
"I've been returning a lot better
lately," Tarango said. "Both my
forehand return and second serve
have improved — those are the
two things I couldn't do with my
sore wrist. Now that my wrist is
stronger my confidence is return
ing in both."
Speaking of hurt wrists, Jeff
Cathrall played both days with a
taped left wrist, although he is a
righthander. ASU's David
Lomicky probably spent most of
his match with Cathrall wishing
the Stanford junior had sprained
his right wrist. Cathrall had no
trouble at all with Lomicky, win
ning 6-3, 6-4.
Despite a Yannick Noah
between-the-legs shot, Martin
Blackman was unable to defeat
Dan Marting, falling 2-6, 6-3, 6-4.
Alex O'Brien joined Blackman
as the only Cardinal players to
lose on the day, falling 6-7, 6-0,
4-6 to Jeff Wood. Glenn Solomon,
continuing to come on strong,
wiped Joel Finnigan off the court
6-3, 6-0, and Barry Richards —
surprise — won yet again, defeat
ing Craig Purcell 6-4, 6-4.
Richards, along with partner
Dan Turbow, provided the
clincher to the team win when
the pair downed Purcell and Fin
