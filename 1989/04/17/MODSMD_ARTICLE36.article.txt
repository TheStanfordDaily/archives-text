# Track tones technique at Stanford Classic
## 
### Ed Pike Staff writer 
Patty Purpur is determined to finish her
final year at Stanford strong.
Purpur led a Cardinal sweep in the women's
throwing events at the Stanford Track and
Field Classic Saturday, destroying the once
pround Washington throwers in the discus
and shot put.
The senior set a new personal best in the
shot put at 53-foot-3, putting her among the
country's top putters, before throwing a
season-best of 179-foot-9 in the discus.
While consistantly throwing more than 170
feet by itself would have been enough to
qualify her for the NCAA Championships,
Purpur added over a foot to her past best in
the discus and several inches to the shot put.
The six-time All American has been hitting
new heights with a refined technique. "I do
not think she has got anything new," throwing
coach John Powell said. "The difference is,
she's got another year of experience."
Erica Wheeler also won her event, with an
anti-climactic battle in the women's javelin.
Wheeler entered the competition with a
season's best of 178-foot-4, while Washing

tons's Shelly Sanford had thrown 182-foot-4.
Wheeler almost won by default, however, when
Sanford threw only 161-foot-3, but they will
do battle again at the NCAA Championships.
Several other Stanford athletes had notable
personal bests, qualifying for the Pacific 10
Conference Championships along the way.
Leading off the day's running events, sopho
more Jason Martin held on to a narrow lead
down the stretch in the men's 3,000-meter
steeplechase.
Tired from setting the pace, Martin rallied
in the last 100 yards to win in 8:59.81. He
joined six other Stanford men who have al
ready qualified for the conference champion
ships in May.
Sophomore Melanie Bloch also had a
season's best, running the women's 3,000
meters behind Stanford Olympian Patty Sue
Plummer. Plummer took the race easily in
9:15.16, with Bloch finishing second in
9:44.38.
Bloch is the eighth woman to make her
Pac-10 mark, a major early-season objective.
Freshman Jodi Bilotta missed qualifying by
a fraction of a second in the women's 800
meters.
Stanford's Chrystie Gains won two close

victories in the women's 100 and 200 meters,
clocking times of 11.6 and 24.24, respectively.
She ran the 200 meters for just the second
time this season. "I got a good start," she
said. "It felt good." A freshman, she has al
ready set a Stanford school record in the 100
at 11.56.
Steve Miller and David Strang registered
moral victories in the men's running events.
Both came back from multiple stress fractures
to help the depleted ranks of the Cardinal
distance runners, which have been decimated
by injuries.
Miller placed in the 5,000 meters against
strong competition from Notre Dame and
Washington, holding steady after beginning
the race in the very last spot. Middle-distance
runner David Strang, who had a 3:44.50 1,500-
meter effort five weeks ago, staked the Car
dinal to an early lead in the mile relay.
The Cardinal is hosting a total of six home
meets this year, including the Pac-10 Cham
pionships. Its next home meet will be Satur
day, and will be the squad's last competition
before the "Big Meet" against California. Stan
ford will take on Sacramento State, Cal State
Hayward and San Francisco State in the Stan
ford Collegiate Open Saturday
