Women's Tennis
Cardinal 7, Anteaters 2
Yesterday, the Stanford wom
en's tennis team was like the im
patient child who couldn't wait for
morning, though.
The Cardinal opened the box
and — instead of finding some
thing new — found Eleni Ros
sides, an old, familiar friend.
Perhaps the team should have
followed the directions.
At first, it appeared the haste
would do no damage. Rossides,
the senior Ail-American who last
played singles March 4, came out
looking strong against UC-
Irvine's Stacey Cadigan. So
strong, in fact, that she captured
the first set 6-1.
Rossides didn't feel strong, how
ever. Her pulled stomach muscle,
the latest in a series of physical
problems, began to bother her
even before the match began. On
the changeover between sets, Ros
sides decided she could go no fur
ther and defaulted.
"She thought she could play
today," Coach Frank Brennan
said. The hope was that Rossides
could see action in singles and
doubles to "get back into the
flow," Brennan added.
Still, while it was not meant to
be for Rossides yesterday, the na
tion's No. 1-ranked team walked
past the Anteaters and upped its
record to 22-0.
And, while winning has come
to be expected for the Cardinal
— the team's last loss was April
15, 1988 — the victory was im

pressive considering that three of
Stanford's top five singles players
weren't in the lineup.
Freshman Debbie Graham and
her 21-0 record went from No. 4
singles to No. 1 cheerleader as
she rooted her mates on from the
stands. Tami and Teri Whitlinger,
the twin sophomore All -
Americans, weren't even at the
Stanford Tennis Stadium.
Outside of the Rossides' match,
things went smoothly for the Car
dinal in singles action. With
Sandra Birch, Lisa Green, Kylie
Johnson, Cindy Buchsbaum and
Valerie Wilson all winning, Stan
ford had the meet clinched in
singles.
Wilson was the first of the win
ners allowing Melissa Vaccaro
nary a game in a 6-0, 6-0 shutout.
Johnson, moving up two notches
from her usual spot, was equally
impressive at No. 4. She trounced
Biljana Korac by a 6-0, 6-2 score.
Birch's performance was per
haps the best of them all. Matched
against Courtney Weischel, Birch
excelled at all aspects of the game
in scoring a 6-2, 6-1 win.
Green handled Kathy Rose 6-4,
6-3, and Buchsbaum outpointed
Karin Bering, 6-0, 4-6, 6-1.
With Rossides injured, Brennan
had the option of finding a new
partner for Green or subbing in
the Birch-Graham tandem. He
chose the latter and the pair didn't
disappoint.
Graham made a number of es
pecially sensational volleys and
came up with strong serving as
the Cardinal twosome beat Weis
chel and Rose 7-6 (10-8), 6-3.
One spot below them in the
lineup, Johnson and Buchsbaum
were sharp in overcoming Bering
and Cadigan 6-3, 6-4. In the No.
3 spot, Wilson and Carina Rolley
gave Korac and Monica Corbett
a tough battle after dropping the
first set.
In the end, though, their come
back came up just short as the
Irvine team pulled out the 4-6,
7-6 (9-7), 7-5 win.
Ah, Christmas in springtime at
