# Golfers host invite, take fourth

"It was a do-or-die tournament, and we did it."
The words of Cardinal men's golf Coach Wally
Goodwin most easily summed up his team's clutch
play at the Stanford Invitational Tournament last
Friday and Saturday at Stanford Golf Course.

Men's Golf
Cardinal 4th at Stanford Invite

Calling it "by far our best performance since I've
been here," Goodwin watched as his top five golfers
shot the second under-par round of their last four
to finish fourth in a strong field. It was the second
such round in Goodwin's two seasons here.
Southern California won the tournament with an
858, while the Cardinal's 877 narrowly edged the
University of Texas-El Paso by one stroke. Stanford
also just missed topping a good San Jose State
team, which shot 874 for the 54 hole tournament.
The sudden-death nature of the contest was a
result of the looming NCAA regional qualifier at
the end of May. In a new process this year, a team
must be in the top 10 in its district to make the
regionals in El Paso.
Stanford is grouped with all of the West Coast
in District Eight, in which the Cardinal has been
a steady seventh or eighth place.
But with most of the teams that are vying for
those 10 spots at the Stanford tournament, the
pressure was on. "If we had played badly, we would
have been in danger of not making the regionals,"
junior Don Christensen said, who ended up third

on the Cardinal team with a 220.
The weather was cool on Friday, which is a good
thing when 90 golfers have to play 36 consecutive
holes each. The Stanford course was a challenge,
even for the Cardinal players, because for a change
the rough was allowed to grow long and the greens
were somewhat fast.
Still, the new links didn't seem to pose a problem
for Stanford freshman Christian Cevaer, who
humbled the course with a second round "four-under
par 67 to lead the field going into Saturday's final
round. "He's the best player his age in the country,"
senior teammate Brad Geer said. "That 67 score
was just great."
Geer didn't have a bad second round himself,
shooting a one-under-par 70 as the Cardinal ended
up at 282, two under par. That put the team in a
tie for third place behind SJSU and Fresno State
going into Saturday's final 18 holes.
It was not a good time for Cevaer to have a bad
round, but a triple-bogey on the twelfth hole slapped
him with a 76. He finished tied for fourth individ
ually at 214.
The Cardinal could have folded, but junior Mark
Funseth posted a 73 and junior Josh Zander had
his best round of the tourney, a 74. Stanford man
aged to stay ahead of much of the eighteen-team
field, and "beat everyone we had to beat," according
to Goodwin.
The Cardinal continue to improve, a gradually
rising level of play that may have begun in Hawaii,
Christensen said. Two weeks ago in Nashville, Tenn.
Stanford had an incredible third round, and the
under-par rounds may become common soon.
"We're not as good a team as we will be in two
weeks," Goodwin said.
