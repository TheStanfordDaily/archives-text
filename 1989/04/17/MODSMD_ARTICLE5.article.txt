# Feasibility and funding: the first steps

### Ken Yew Staff writer 
Editor's note: This is the first of a series
about the implications and implementation of
the report issued in March by the University
Committee on Minority Issues.

A shortage of funds and other bureaucratic
problems are forcing University officials to
cautiously implement recommendations issued
last month by the University Committee on
Minority Issues.
As a result, correcting the campus racial
problems detailed by the committee promises
to take a long time.
University President Donald Kennedy and
Provost James Hosse set the wheels in motion
last month by setting up a task force to direct
20 various committees and departments in

implementing the UCMI's recommendations.
The task force sent a letter two weeks ago
to each of the departments affected by the
UCMI's prescriptions, asking them to examine
which recommendations could be reasonably
undertaken.

UCMI

Reports by each of these departments are
expected to be delivered to the task force by
the beginning of next month, said Assoc.
Provost Ray Bachetti, task force co-chair.
Several University departments have al
ready said they do not have sufficient funds
to fully implement the UCMI's recommen
dations.

The UCMI's 125 recommendations include
changes such as: hiring new staff in the Ad
missions Office, admitting a greater number
of minority graduate students in all schools
and departments and hiring new minority fac
ulty on both the undergraduate and graduate
levels.
Cecilia Burciaga, associate dean of Graduate
Studies, said "more money is needed to expand
the graduate fellowship budget as a whole."
Burciaga said graduate schools plan to increase
the number of their minority students through
preferentially admitting minorities instead of
by adding spaces for new students.
Dean of Undergraduate Admissions Jean
Fetter said her office does not have enough
money to increase their staff or hire an Amer
ican Indian recruiting officer as the UCMI
suggested.
The UCMI report recorded nu
merous complaints from admis
sions officers that the lack of
adequate funds and staff ham
pered minority recruiting efforts,
especially during the intense pe
riod of application reading.
Across the board, Bachetti said
the University does not have suf
ficient funds to distribute among
the departments to introduce the
UCMI's changes.
He said because Stanford is cur
rently redesigning its budget, the
University's central funds "aren't
very ample anymore." The Uni
versity recently developed a
budget that is expected to leave
Stanford with a $2 million deficit.
According to Bachetti, no Cen
tennial funds have been ear
marked for the UCMI's
provisions. However, he said the
University will undertake special
fundraising efforts to implement
the report's recommendations.
For now, the funds necessary
to implement the UCMI's recom
mendations must be built into
each department's current operat
ing budget. These new expenses
could take away from other
departmental priorities or neces
sitate new fundraising, Bachetti
speculated.
He said departments affected by
the UCMI were advised to "be
strategic" with their estimates for
how much the changes are ex
pected to cost.
One of the areas that will have
to undergo substantial change ac
cording to the UCMI's findings
is the Dean of the Office of Stu
dent Affairs.
While he declined to comment
about the criticisms the UCMI
report leveled against his office,
Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons said DOSA has already
begun work to involve more staff
in policy-making decisions, as the
UCMI recommended.
Because DOSA runs a number
of campus departments, from res
idential education to medical serv
ices, the office must first
synthesize a consensus among the
various departments before decid
ing how to implement the UCMI's
recommendations, he said.
Asst. Dean of Undergraduate
Studies Charles Junkerman said
the Undergraduate Studies de

partment will likely be able to fol
low the report's recommenda
tions.
"Most here believe the recom
mendations are very feasible,"
Junkerman said.
Nonetheless, he said there is
much "difference of opinion on
the advisability" of a ninth distri
bution requirement for ethnic
studies, as the report suggests.
Junkerman said the proposal
for a fund that will help develop
more ethnic studies courses was
"a great idea." The UCMI recom
mended that a fund be set up to
develop six new courses and
modify six existing courses to in
clude more ethnic studies mate
rial every year for three years.
Junkerman said 12 new courses
per year seems "ambitious" and
that a more likely outcome would
be six courses per year over six
years.
Junkerman said Asian-
American and American Indian
studies are "the most needy and
the most underrepresented" eth
nic subjects, and that these two
fields will be a "high priority" in
developing the ethnic studies cur
riculum.
Junkerman also said Under
graduate Studies is closely study
ing the problems — pointed out
by the UCMI — that many mi
nority students seem to have in
basic math and chemistry courses.
"Both of these are actively ad
dressed problem areas," Junker
man said.
Junkerman added that the pro
posals to establish a program to
attract more ethnic studies fac
ulty and senior visiting professors
to Stanford, and to form a task
force to oversee ethnic studies,
are "reasonable ideas."
Junkerman said he sees no ob
stacle to their implementation.
Burciaga said the Graduate
Studies Department has already
been acting on the recommenda
tion to double the number of tar
geted minority Ph.D. students
within the next five years.
Targeted minorities are identi
fied as those of black, American
Indian and Chicano/Latino back
ground. Asian-American students
are not included because their
numbers are seen as sufficiently
high in some graduate schools.
According to Burciaga, a sub
committee on affirmative action
has been formed which will ex
amine the percentages of these
minorities in two graduate schools
every year.

As a result, correcting the campus racial
problems detailed by the committee promises
to take a long time.
University President Donald Kennedy and
Provost James Hosse set the wheels in motion
last month by setting up a task force to direct
20 various committees and departments in

implementing the UCMI's recommendations.
The task force sent a letter two weeks ago
to each of the departments affected by the
UCMI's prescriptions, asking them to examine
which recommendations could be reasonably
undertaken.

UCMI

Reports by each of these departments are
expected to be delivered to the task force by
the beginning of next month, said Assoc.
Provost Ray Bachetti, task force co-chair.
Several University departments have al
ready said they do not have sufficient funds
to fully implement the UCMI's recommen
dations.

The UCMI's 125 recommendations include
changes such as: hiring new staff in the Ad
missions Office, admitting a greater number
of minority graduate students in all schools
and departments and hiring new minority fac
ulty on both the undergraduate and graduate
levels.
Cecilia Burciaga, associate dean of Graduate
Studies, said "more money is needed to expand
the graduate fellowship budget as a whole."
Burciaga said graduate schools plan to increase
the number of their minority students through
preferentially admitting minorities instead of
by adding spaces for new students.
Dean of Undergraduate Admissions Jean
Fetter said her office does not have enough
money to increase their staff or hire an Amer
ican Indian recruiting officer as the UCMI
suggested.
The UCMI report recorded nu
merous complaints from admis
sions officers that the lack of
adequate funds and staff ham
pered minority recruiting efforts,
especially during the intense pe
riod of application reading.
Across the board, Bachetti said
the University does not have suf
ficient funds to distribute among
the departments to introduce the
UCMI's changes.
He said because Stanford is cur
rently redesigning its budget, the
University's central funds "aren't
very ample anymore." The Uni
versity recently developed a
budget that is expected to leave
Stanford with a $2 million deficit.
According to Bachetti, no Cen
tennial funds have been ear
marked for the UCMI's
provisions. However, he said the
University will undertake special
fundraising efforts to implement
the report's recommendations.
For now, the funds necessary
to implement the UCMI's recom
mendations must be built into
each department's current operat
ing budget. These new expenses
could take away from other
departmental priorities or neces
sitate new fundraising, Bachetti
speculated.
He said departments affected by
the UCMI were advised to "be
strategic" with their estimates for
how much the changes are ex
pected to cost.
One of the areas that will have
to undergo substantial change ac
cording to the UCMI's findings
is the Dean of the Office of Stu
dent Affairs.
While he declined to comment
about the criticisms the UCMI
report leveled against his office,
Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons said DOSA has already
begun work to involve more staff
in policy-making decisions, as the
UCMI recommended.
Because DOSA runs a number
of campus departments, from res
idential education to medical serv
ices, the office must first
synthesize a consensus among the
various departments before decid
ing how to implement the UCMI's
recommendations, he said.
Asst. Dean of Undergraduate
Studies Charles Junkerman said
the Undergraduate Studies de

partment will likely be able to fol
low the report's recommenda
tions.
"Most here believe the recom
mendations are very feasible,"
Junkerman said.
Nonetheless, he said there is
much "difference of opinion on
the advisability" of a ninth distri
bution requirement for ethnic
studies, as the report suggests.
Junkerman said the proposal
for a fund that will help develop
more ethnic studies courses was
"a great idea." The UCMI recom
mended that a fund be set up to
develop six new courses and
modify six existing courses to in
clude more ethnic studies mate
rial every year for three years.
Junkerman said 12 new courses
per year seems "ambitious" and
that a more likely outcome would
be six courses per year over six
years.
Junkerman said Asian-
American and American Indian
studies are "the most needy and
the most underrepresented" eth
nic subjects, and that these two
fields will be a "high priority" in
developing the ethnic studies cur
riculum.
Junkerman also said Under
graduate Studies is closely study
ing the problems — pointed out
by the UCMI — that many mi
nority students seem to have in
basic math and chemistry courses.
"Both of these are actively ad
dressed problem areas," Junker
man said.
Junkerman added that the pro
posals to establish a program to
attract more ethnic studies fac
ulty and senior visiting professors
to Stanford, and to form a task
force to oversee ethnic studies,
are "reasonable ideas."
Junkerman said he sees no ob
stacle to their implementation.
Burciaga said the Graduate
Studies Department has already
been acting on the recommenda
tion to double the number of tar
geted minority Ph.D. students
within the next five years.
Targeted minorities are identi
fied as those of black, American
Indian and Chicano/Latino back
ground. Asian-American students
are not included because their
numbers are seen as sufficiently
high in some graduate schools.
According to Burciaga, a sub
committee on affirmative action
has been formed which will ex
amine the percentages of these
minorities in two graduate schools
every year.
