Editor's note: This is the first of a series
about the implications and implementation of
the report issued in March by the University
Committee on Minority Issues.

A shortage of funds and other bureaucratic
problems are forcing University officials to
cautiously implement recommendations issued
last month by the University Committee on
Minority Issues.
As a result, correcting the campus racial
problems detailed by the committee promises
to take a long time.
University President Donald Kennedy and
Provost James Hosse set the wheels in motion
last month by setting up a task force to direct
20 various committees and departments in

implementing the UCMI's recommendations.
The task force sent a letter two weeks ago
to each of the departments affected by the
UCMI's prescriptions, asking them to examine
which recommendations could be reasonably
undertaken.

Reports by each of these departments are
expected to be delivered to the task force by
the beginning of next month, said Assoc.
Provost Ray Bachetti, task force co-chair.
Several University departments have al
ready said they do not have sufficient funds
to fully implement the UCMI's recommen
dations.

The UCMI's 125 recommendations include
changes such as: hiring new staff in the Ad
missions Office, admitting a greater number
of minority graduate students in all schools
and departments and hiring new minority fac
ulty on both the undergraduate and graduate
levels.
Cecilia Burciaga, associate dean of Graduate
Studies, said "more money is needed to expand
the graduate fellowship budget as a whole."
Burciaga said graduate schools plan to increase
the number of their minority students through
preferentially admitting minorities instead of
by adding spaces for new students.
Dean of Undergraduate Admissions Jean
Fetter said her office does not have enough
money to increase their staff or hire an Amer
ican Indian recruiting officer as the UCMI
