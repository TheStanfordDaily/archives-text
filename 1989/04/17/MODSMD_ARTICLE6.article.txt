# Prospective frosh to visit Farm
## 
### Sophia Shing Staff writer 
Beginning today, more than 450 prospective fresh
men will descend on campus and take up temporary
residence with some of the 900 undergraduates who
have volunteered to show them what Stanford life
is all about.
While many of last year's programs will continue,
this year's Prospective Freshman Week boasts many
more activities.
New programs and events include a scavenger
hunt, a concert given by all the student singing
groups at Stanford and a reception hosted by the
Admissions Office. Informational sessions will
describe the student publications at Stanford, the
ASSU and the Greek system. Several programs will
be offered twice.
' Kimberly Geil, John Keller and Morris Sim, all
Sophomores and student directors of this year's "Pro
Fro" Week, began planning the event in September.
"Our goal was to provide the pro fros with an
informed perspective of Stanford," Sim said. With
this in mind, the list of classes pro fros may attend
during their visit was significantly increased.
While there are more activities open to pro fros
this year, the directors made a point of encouraging
them not to go to too many. "As you start to explore

Stanford, remember that there is more here than
programs and classes," reads the front of the 1989
Pro Fro Week Handbook. "We encourage you to
experience that life by living it!"
About 60 volunteers helped coordinate this year's
Pro Fro Week compared to only 12 last year. This
increase is due to intensified efforts by this year's
directors to improve communication with residence
staff campus-wide.
This year, the check-in desk will no longer serve
as a meeting place for all Pro Fros and their hosts.
Instead, arriving Pro Fros will be escorted to the
dorms in batches where they will then meet their
hosts. "It hopefully eliminates some of the confusion
and time delays at the check-in desk," Geil said.
In deciding where to house pro fros on campus,
two criteria were considered: whether the dorm was
located close to the center of campus and if there
were freshmen and sophomores in the residence.
Asst. Director of Admissions Greg Smith said,
"It's important for prospective freshmen to talk to
someone who hasn't been here as long, because the
whole decision of colleges is freshest in their minds."
"We're not trying to sell Stanford" during Pro
Fro Week, Keller said. "Rather, we're trying to
provide the pro fros with an opportunity to make
an informed choice. We want everyone involved in
Pro Fro Week to have fun."
