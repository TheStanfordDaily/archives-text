# Anti-hazing activist shares sobering story

During Alfred University's fra
ternity rush in 1978, Chuck was
given a pint of bourbon, a fifth
of wine and a six-pack of beer.
Then he was locked in the trunk
of a car, driven about New York
state and told that he would have
to drink it all before being re
leased. After 40 minutes, frater

sleep it off. The next morning,
Chuck died of acute alcohol
poisoning.
Since then, Chuck's mother has
done her best to protect other
college students from the dangers
of hazing practices such as those
that killed her son.

hazing activist, will share her

story during a talk in Cubberley
Auditorium, Room 133 at 7:30
p.m.
Hoping that Stevens's talk will
open people's minds to "the down
part of Rush," Chuck Gillingham,
one of the organizers of the event,
said, "I think people need to be
aware of the problems that can
come up." Gillingham is the res
ident assistant at the Delta Tau
Delta Fraternity.

Chuck's death, her reaction was
"horror and shock. ... It made
no sense to us," she said, "because
he was not a drinker."
It was not until the day after
his funeral that she learned
Chuck died during a hazing ritual.
In the weeks following the
tragedy, Stevens learned that no
one was going to be held respon
sible for what happened. As other
parents called her to report
