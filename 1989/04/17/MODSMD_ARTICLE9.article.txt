# Anti-hazing activist shares sobering story
## 
### Marina Krakovsky 
During Alfred University's fra
ternity rush in 1978, Chuck was
given a pint of bourbon, a fifth
of wine and a six-pack of beer.
Then he was locked in the trunk
of a car, driven about New York
state and told that he would have
to drink it all before being re
leased. After 40 minutes, frater
nity members found Chuck un
conscious but decided to let him
sleep it off. The next morning,
Chuck died of acute alcohol
poisoning.
Since then, Chuck's mother has
done her best to protect other
college students from the dangers
of hazing practices such as those
that killed her son.
And tonight after a week of par
ties and other Rush activities,
Stanford students will get a sober
ing taste of this mission. Eileen
Stevens, now a national anti
hazing activist, will share her

story during a talk in Cubberley
Auditorium, Room 133 at 7:30
p.m.
Hoping that Stevens's talk will
open people's minds to "the down
part of Rush," Chuck Gillingham,
one of the organizers of the event,
said, "I think people need to be
aware of the problems that can
come up." Gillingham is the res
ident assistant at the Delta Tau
Delta Fraternity.
When Stevens found out about
Chuck's death, her reaction was
"horror and shock. ... It made
no sense to us," she said, "because
he was not a drinker."
It was not until the day after
his funeral that she learned
Chuck died during a hazing ritual.
In the weeks following the
tragedy, Stevens learned that no
one was going to be held respon
sible for what happened. As other
parents called her to report
similar incidents, she decided to
do something so that "others
could learn from what happened
to my son."
She decided to start an organ
ization named after him —
CHUCK, the Committee to Halt
Useless College Killings.
She argues that fraternities
were founded on strong values
and ideals and that hazing "was
an ugly tradition that crept into
the program much later."
Fraternal Affairs Adviser Joe
Pisano said he applauds Stevens'
ability to turn a personal tragedy
into something positive to help
other people.
"Here's a woman who's been
victimized and, while strongly cri
tical of some of the activities of
fraternities, is supportive of fra
ternity life," he said.
Pisano said he believes that
Stanford's fraternities can learn
from her that "the tragedies one
reads about in the papers are real
— that hazing exists."
