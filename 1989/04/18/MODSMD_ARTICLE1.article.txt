# BSU elects a new chair
## UCMI goals to be stressed 
### John Wagner Editorial staff 
Implementation of recommendations made in the
recent UCMI report will be foremost on the political
agenda of next year's Black Student Union, newly
elected BSU Chair Calvin Martin said yesterday.
Martin, a sophomore and the current BSU trea
surer, told The Daily that he wholeheartedly en
dorsed the vision of an ethnically diverse community
presented in the report issued last month by the
University Committee on Minority Issues.
In addition to electing Martin, Sunday night the
BSU selected Louis Jackson as vice-chair for exter
nal affairs, Lloyd Metz as secretary, Bacardi Jackson
as general representative, Tara Walters as publicity
coordinator and Christi Taylor as secretary.
The remaining position on the BSU officer corps,
vice-chair for internal affairs, will be filled after a
run-off election later this week.
As BSU Chair, Martin said he will work to
strengthen course offerings in ethnic studies, par
ticularly in the Afro-American studies program, and
to push the administration to recruit more minority
faculty members.
Martin said he also plans to place a greater em
phasis on community service work next year. He
said he hopes to make members of the black com
munity at Stanford aware of their gifts and talents
and encourage them to share these with others less
fortunate.
The BSU will be watching closely for the
remainder of this year and into next year as the
Student Conduct Legislative
Council attempts to re-interpret
the Fundamental Standard, Mar
tin said.
He said he thought the commit
tee's first draft of interpretation
was "not as severe and not as
clear" as he would have liked for
it to have been.
Violations of the Fundamental
Standard need to be defined more
explicitly, he said.
The "many loopholes" in the
current interpretation have
"caused a lot of stress and duress"
in the black community, Martin
said, referring to the racist inci

dents which took placc last fall in
Ujamaa House. In October, two
white freshmen admitted to pos
ting a racially offensive poster out
side the door of a black resident
in Ujamaa.
Due to the ambiguity in the
current interepretation of the
Fundamental Standard, the ad
ministration could not take dis
iplinary action against the fresh
men, Martin said.
While Martin said he would like
to see racist acts regarded as ex
plicit violations of the standard,
he said he recognizes the potential
difficulty that such a definition
could present.
"It's going to be difficult to
define what is really a racist act
and what is ignorance," he said.
