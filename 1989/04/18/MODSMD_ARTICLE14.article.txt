## Poland legalizes Solidarity Walesa urges rebuilding union 'skillfully and quickly' 
### 
WARSAW, Poland (AP) â€” Lech
Walesa yesterday urged Poles to rebuild
Solidarity "skillfully and quickly" hours
after a court declared the independent
union legal again and ended seven years
of government suppression.
Walesa also praised President Bush
for announcing an aid package for
Poland's economy.
Walesa was expected to follow up res
toration of his union's legal status with
a meeting today with his longtime an
tagonist, Polish leader Gen. Wojciech
Jaruzelski, and a trip to Rome on to
morrow to meet Polish-born Pope John
Paul II at the Vatican.
Looking relaxed despite what he said
was a case of pneumonia, Walesa arrived
by train in Warsaw on last night and
told reporters Bush was "a brilliant
politician."
"Bush is a great man and he knows
the Polish situation very well," he said.
He called the proposal for U.S. aid
"quite big."
Walesa was accompanied to Warsaw
by key adviser Adam Michnik and was
welcomed at the station by a handful
of other Solidarity advisers.
He said he could not confirm or deny
he had a planned meeting with
Jaruzelski.
"I appeal to all workers and support
ers of our union to form factory organ
izations as soon as possible where they
still don't exist and to report their mem

bership in Solidarity or to join it," said
Walesa, in a statement read in Warsaw
by union spokesman Janusz
Onyszkiewicz.

There was thunderous
applause when the ver
dict was complete,
sealing an about-face ap
proved earlier by Com
munist Party leaders.

Onyszkiewicz said an independent un
ion press should begin operating by the
end of the month and that Solidarity
should get new national headquarters
in Gdansk by today.
"Our effort, devotion and suffering
have not been in vain," Walesa said in
his statement. "We defended our
workers' rights, together we are paving
a road to a fully democratic and sover
eign Poland."
But he cautioned the"day of success"
came in hard economic times.
"The Polish nation is facing tasks
which are much more complex than in
1980. Now we must undertake a trial
of real and deep economic reform and
democratic restructuring of the state,"
he said.

The Warsaw provincial court regis
tered the reborn Solidarity in the same
room where its original charter was ap
proved in November 1980.
Onyszkiewicz said Walesa stayed
away from the hearing in part because
the union always regarded itself as legal,
so the session had "a technical rather
than symbolic nature."
Nevertheless, there was thunderous
applause when the verdict was complete,
sealing an about-face approved earlier
by Communist Party leaders.
As the court session ended, hundreds
of hands lifted in the"V" for victory
sign and chants of "Solidarnosc! Solidar
nosc!" filled the room. Solidarity leaders
beamed, supporters waved bouquets of
yellow daffodils, and judges shook hands
with the participants.
Then there were cheers of "Lech
Walesa! Lech Walesa!" and the singing
of the national anthem.
"The spirit of history was with us,"
said Solidarity supporter Krzysztof
Sliwinski.
Two Solidarity banners were held
aloft during the hearing before Presid
ing Judge Danuta Widawska and two
other judges. About a dozen Solidarity
leaders and advisers and 300 sympat
hizers jammed the narrow courtroom
with yellow walls and crimson curtains.
Another 100 waited in the corridor.
