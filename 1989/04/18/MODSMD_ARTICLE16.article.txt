NEW YORK (AP) - A federal
bankruptcy judge gave Eastern
Airlines and its creditors an extra
week yesterday to seek buyers and
explore a possible breakup, but
parent Texas Air Corp. said the
strike-strapped airline wasn't for
sale.
The developments added a new
twist to the Miami-based airline's
tortuous labor crisis, now in its
seventh week, and suggested a so

lution was growing more elusive.
"As time goes by there are fewer
alternatives to explore," U.S.
Bankruptcy Judge Burton Lifland
told a Manhattan courtroom
crammed with about 50 pilots and
lawyers for Texas Air, creditors
and the unions.
"This airline is hemorrhaging,"
Lifland said. "It is not tolerable
that this process be so lengthy
that the parties have nothing left

to consider."
Bruce Simon, an attorney for
the pilots' union, told a news con
ference that Texas Air "appears
to be in an especial state of dis
array," with the company and its
lawyers giving conflicting signals
about their planned course of ac
tion.
Lifland held a hearing to deter
mine why he shouldn't put the
entire airline up for sale.
