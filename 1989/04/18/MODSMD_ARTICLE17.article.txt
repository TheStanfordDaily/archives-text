# Committee charges Wright
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - The
House ethics committee, with
Democrats and Republicans
united, formally charged Speaker
Jim Wright yesterday with 69 vi
olations of the chamber's rules
including what the panel's chair
man called "a scheme to evade"
limits on outside earnings.
After a 10-month, $1.5 million
investigation, the committee of six
Democrats and six Republicans
voted unanimously to issue a
report finding "reason to believe"
the Texas Democrat had run afoul
of House rules requiring reporting
of gifts, barring acceptance of gifts
from persons with a direct inter
est in legislation and limiting out
side earned income.
"I know in my heart I have not
violated any of the rules of that

institution," Wright said in a
speech to a labor meeting shortly
after the ethics report was re
leased.
He said he had asked "very ur
gently, very earnestly" for a quick
meeting with the the committee
"to confront them, to confront the
allegations head-on, face-to-face."
While scandal has tainted other
House speakers, Wright is the
first ever to be formally charged
with ethical wrongdoing.
At a news conference, commit
tee chairman Rep. Julian Dixon,
D-Calif., emphasized that Wright
is presumed innocent until the
charges are proven, and he un
derscored that proving them re
quires a much heavier weight of
evidence than the step taken yes
terday, which is the panel's equiv

alent of an indictment.
The move set in motion a series
of steps in which Wright can
defend himself and the panel try
to prove with "clear and convinc
ing" evidence that the violations
occurred. That is likely ultimately
to throw the matter before the
full House, where Wright's posi
tion as the nation's highest
elected Democrat could be on the
line.
Possible punishments range
from a reprimand to expulsion
from the House, although law
makers in both parties seemed to
think the final decision would
come down to whether Wright
should be reprimanded or simply
chastised for poor judgment and
let off without formal punishment.
