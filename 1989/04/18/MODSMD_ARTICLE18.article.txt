Soviets admit psychiatric abuses
MOSCOW (AP) — A top Soviet psychiatric
expert said yesterday that authorities in the past
had abused the legal rights of mental patients in
the Soviet Union.
The Soviet Union pulled out of the World
Psychiatric Association in 1983 after reports that
political dissidents were held in Soviet psychiatric
hospitals. The reports probably would have
caused the Soviets to be expelled from the asso
ciation.
The organization's executive committee voted
at a meeting in Madrid, Spain, on March 29 to

re-admit the Soviets, a decision yet to be ratified
by the association's general assembly.
Botha offers deal to Mandela
CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) — President
P.W. Botha said yesterday the government will
"react with magnanimity" if jailed black leader
Nelson Mandela offers to promote a peaceful
settlement in South Africa.
Botha's speech in Parliament appeared no dif
ferent from previous government offers to free
the 70-year-old African National Congress leader
on condition he renounces his guerrilla organi
zation's use of violence. Mandela has refused.
