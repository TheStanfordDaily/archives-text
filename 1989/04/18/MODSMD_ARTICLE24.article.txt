## Forced into motherhood 
### 
DOES THE GOVERNMENT have
the right to make or enforce laws
that concern individual morality?
This issue is at the heart of Webster v.
Reproductive Health Services, which the
Supreme Court will hear April 26. This
case deals with the legality of abortion
and has the potential to overturn the Roc
v. Wade decision, making the act of
childbearing compulsory for all pregnant
women.
Pregnancy is not easy and neither is
motherhood. Unless a woman is certain
that she is ready for the responsibility
of parenthood and is willing to put the
needs of her child before her own, she
should not have a child. This is a decision
that each woman must make for herself.
An opinion held by Christian and non-
Christian abortion opponents alike is the
wrongness of murder, drawing a parallel
between murder and abortion. Indeed
murder is illegal and is morally wrong,
but is the termination of a pregnancy
comparable to the murder of a child?
It is questionable if the fetus can ac
tually be given status as a person, since
it is incapable of existing outside of the
mother's womb until the seventh month
of pregnancy, if then.
Christian proponents of this view assert
that God views the unborn child as a
person; therefore abortion is murder. The
Bible does not make any such claim.
There is no mention of the unborn,
though there are various references made
to the rights of children throughout the
New Testament.
Abortion foes also tell us that there
are alternatives to abortion. Unwanted
children could be adopted by families who

want, but cannot have, children. 1 ques
tion whether this is really an alternative
worth overturning Roe v. Wade.
Though it is true that there are many
families waiting to adopt children, these
families want particular types of children.
What about those babies born with phys
ical or psychological handicaps? Who will
adopt minority children? The largest
number of unadopted children fall into
these categories. Before increasing the
number of children who need to be
adopted, we need to improve the entire
adoption system.
Forcing women to continue pregnancies
they do not want will only lead to in
creases in the number of children abused
by their parents, the number of children
living below the poverty line and the
number of children born with birth
defects.
Feelings of frustration, of unfulfilled
dreams and aspirations, lead some par
ents to abuse their children. If the parents
do not really want their child, abuse be
comes all the more likely. Is it ethical or
moral to subject an innocent child to such
a situation? ("Take heed that you do not
despise one of these little ones . . Mat
thew 18:10.)
Moreover, more than one out of five
American children live below the poverty
line, including one out of four children
under the age of six. There are 13 million
"poor" children, then, and out of these
13 million, 42 percent live in families
with incomes below 50 percent of the
poverty line. (These are 1983 figures
which have increased substantially due
to Reagan's policies).
The revocation of a woman's right to

terminate her pregnancy would cause
these numbers to skyrocket. The families
that are below the poverty line are largely
comprised of unmarried women, a con
siderable number of whom are teen moth
ers.
It is no secret that teen pregnancies
are on the rise; if we force these women
to carry their pregnancies to term we
will see an increase in the number of
single mothers living below the poverty
line, leading to an increase in poverty
stricken children.
That women are forced to give birth
does not mean that they will be forced
to get prenatal care, nor will such care
be given to those who cannot afford it.
Today the United States leads the indus
trialized world in high infant mortality
rates, low birth-weight children and death
of women during childbirth.
When hearing Webster v. Reproductive
Health Services later this month, the Su
preme Court needs to look at all of the
possible ramifications of its decision. By

whether to give birth, the Court would
not only hurt women and the citizens of
our country, but also those it purports

comes all the more likely. Is it ethical or
moral to subject an innocent child to such
a situation? ("Take heed that you do not
despise one of these little ones . . Mat
thew 18:10.)
Moreover, more than one out of five
American children live below the poverty
line, including one out of four children
under the age of six. There are 13 million
"poor" children, then, and out of these
13 million, 42 percent live in families
with incomes below 50 percent of the
poverty line. (These are 1983 figures
which have increased substantially due
to Reagan's policies).
The revocation of a woman's right to

terminate her pregnancy would cause
these numbers to skyrocket. The families
that are below the poverty line are largely
comprised of unmarried women, a con
siderable number of whom are teen moth
ers.
It is no secret that teen pregnancies
are on the rise; if we force these women
to carry their pregnancies to term we
will see an increase in the number of
single mothers living below the poverty
line, leading to an increase in poverty
stricken children.
That women are forced to give birth
does not mean that they will be forced
to get prenatal care, nor will such care
be given to those who cannot afford it.
Today the United States leads the indus
trialized world in high infant mortality
rates, low birth-weight children and death
of women during childbirth.
When hearing Webster v. Reproductive
Health Services later this month, the Su
preme Court needs to look at all of the
possible ramifications of its decision. By
denying women the right to choose
whether to give birth, the Court would
not only hurt women and the citizens of
our country, but also those it purports
to help, the unborn.
