SURE's fee request
needed for funding
important service
In response to The Daily's recom
mendation of "NO" for SURE Escort
Service's fee request, we feel it is nec
essary to refute The Daily's contention
that SURE could continue to exist
solely on Program Board funding.
In the brief interview, the editors did
not fully address and understand the
issue of escort salaries. In the past,
SURE has used volunteer escorts.
However, these volunteers are not an
efficient means of providing reliable
service.
As for relying on Program Board
funding, The Daily should realize that
in the fifth discretionary cycle, 31
groups applied for approximately
$6,500. This situation will not improve
next year. The Daily is assuming our
service can be run effectively and
reliably on a Program Board that is
already overextending its own re
sources.
Last year, the campus overwhelm
ingly supported SURE's fee request.
We trust that students will again rec
ognize the value and need of the serv
ice we provide.

Women's Center is
open to all women,
pro-lifers included
In her April 14 letter, Jennifer
Bryson raised two issues which we as
members of the Women's Center Col
lective would like to address.

First, Bryson states, "The Women's
Center should not try to mask the
narrow appeal of feminism under such
a broad title as 'Women's Center.' "
Feminism is founded on the basic prin
ciple that men and women should be
equal in society, and this can hardly
can be viewed as a position of narrow
appeal.
Second, this ideal of equality does
not necessarily preclude any viewpoint
concerning the issue of abortion that
takes into consideration women's con
cern. Bryson implies that the Women's
Center does not support Stanford Stu
dents for Life because of its political
stance. However, it is not the group's
ideology, but the tactics by which it
attempts to advance this ideology, that
are objectionable.
Stanford Students For Life, as an
organization which actively supports
Operation Rescue, cannot be said to
approach the abortion issue in such a
constructive manner. Operation Rescue
is an organization which uses illegal
tactics, including violence and intimida
tion, to achieve its goals.
As long as such tactics persist, the
Stanford Women's Center cannot con
done, much less support, Operation
Rescue's activities; thus, we cannot
support Stanford Students for Life.
The Women's Center is for all wom
en. We invite men and women of the
Stanford community to participate with
us in an effort to promote social
equality in a fair and respectful way.
