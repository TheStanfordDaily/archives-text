## Beyond Greece: multi-cultural literacy

"The Graywolf Annual Five:
Multi-Cultural Literacy"
Edited by Rick Simonson and Scott Walker
Graywolf Press, $8.50
Reviewed by Barry Katz
The fifth Graywolf Annual is dedicated to
the theme of multi-cultural literacy, and I
skipped right to the appendix where the
editors, in a deliberate provocation to E. D.
Hirsch's "Cultural Literacy," offer "the begin
ning of an expanded list of essential names,
phrases, dates, and concepts" that will make
us multi-culturally literate:
AA (Alcoholics Anonymous)
Abdul-Jabbar, Kareem
Absurd, Theater of the
Agent Orange
Asian Exclusion Act
Brecht, Bertold . . .
This made me nervous, because it seemed
that it could easily degenerate into a sort of
affirmative-action version of Hirsch's mis
guided exercise in trivial pursuit.
Hirsch, it will be recalled, soared to the top
of last year's best-seller list by making the
reasonable argument that a culture must
share a common field of factual reference
points, and to help us along the way he and
his associates provided a list of some 5,000
people, places and things that "all Americans
need to know."
The problem, however, is that our culture
is far more diverse than Hirsch would have
had us believe, and his reference points turned
out to be suspiciously evocative of its narrow
but dominant upper stratum.
"Multi-Cultural Literacy" seeks to redress
that bias — not through an alternative list,
of course, but by offering to us a selection of
writings drawn from some of the other strata
of American culture.
In its range of literary expression, political
commitment and cultural identification, the
anthology amounts to a real list not only of
things to be known but of ways of knowing
that may guide us toward an appreciation of
the Indian-European-African-Asian-Latin ag
glomeration that is contemporary American
society.
The list, in this context, has the character
not of a counter-cultural inventory of what
we should know but of a revelation of what
we do not. It is a mocking, biting parody of
the hegemonic standard built into the cam
paigns of E.D. Hirsch, Allan Bloom, William
Bennett and all of last year's polemicists who
would reduce the phenomenon of "culture"
to the standard of its narrow elite.

The 13 essays collected in "Multi-Cultural
Literacy" span a period of 25 years and range
in hue from black to brown to yellow to red
to white. Although they are intended to rep
resent the broadest range of cultural iden
tifications, a recurrent theme runs through
nearly all of them. It is best stated, perhaps,
in the lead essay by James Baldwin, first
delivered in 1963 as "A Talk to Teachers" of
black children: "I would try to make him
know that just as American history is longer,
larger, more various, more beautiful, and more
terrible than anything anyone has ever said
about it, so is the world larger, more daring,
more beautiful and more terrible, but prin
cipally larger — and that it belongs to him."
Although Baldwin was speaking to a specific
audience, the message deserves to be heard
by everyone, and it does so through the pages
of this book. The dominant literary culture
which we have all inherited is full of riches,
but we will starve ourselves if we hoard them

greedily and narrow our intellectual appetites
to European fare.

The theme of anti-parochialism resonates
throughout these essays and achieves a par
ticularly vivid evocation in the lyrical reflec
tions of Carlos Fuentes on "How I Started to
Write." Describing a literary trajectory that
traversed the Americas, literally from Santiago
to Mexico City to Cambridge, Fuentes learned
"that the intellectual tradition of the whole
world was ours by birthright, and that
Mexican literature was important because it
was literature, not because it was Mexican."
Why has this insight — "that culture con
sists of connections, not of separations" —
proven so refractory? Why do we strive so
desperately to narrow the range of cultural
experience, to deprive ourselves of our proper
inheritance as Americans and, indeed, as
human beings?
What is needed, suggests black feminist Mic
hele Wallace, is "a Rainbow Coalition of the
mind."

Sometimes, in these essays, an author yields
to a note of stridency: "The terms Third World
Culture, ethnic art, and minority art are
openly ethnocentric and necessarily imply an
axiological vision of the world at the service
of Anglo-European culture," writes San Diego
artist Guillermo Gomez-Pena — as if Anglos
aren't themselves an "ethnic group," as if the
500 million Latin American mestizos that in
habit the Americas are a "minority."
But the literary psychodynamics of anger
are part of the story, and it is one of the
merits of these essays that the writer's anger
— over exclusion, oppression, humiliation —
is thematized and used as an instrument of
analysis, not a weapon of assault.
"As a result of this process," says Gomez-
Pena of his deterritorialization, "I have be
come a cultural topographer, border-crosser,
and hunter of myths." The loss of an unam
biguous cultural identity, of linguistic security,
of clearly delimited ideological horizons has

not been easy for his generation of Chicano
artists and intellectuals, but in exchange,
"what we have won was a vision of a more
experimental culture, a multi-focal and toler
ant one."
I compare this dignified and expansive vi
sion to the hysterical tirades that mark "The
Closing of the American Mind" and the
speeches of our former Secretary of Education.

Ishmael Reed likes to think of America as
a "cultural bouillabaisse," not a melting pot
in which, inevitably, the cultural solvent turns
out to be white, middle class, male, English
speaking, and Protestant. "Western civiliza
tion, then, becomes another confusing cate
gory like Third World, or Judaeo-Christian
culture, as man attempts to impose his small
screen view of political and cultural reality
upon a complex world."
For Paula Gunn Allen, a leading Native
American writer and critic, this myopia is but
a symptom of a larger loss of memory that
retroactively makes all cultural exchange into
a one-way traffic — the Europeanization of
the Indians, but never the Indianization of
the European settler; the Christianization of
Africa, but never the reciprocal influence of
African civilization on "the west;" the eman
cipation of women, but not, ipso facto, of men.
Another contributor, exiled Uruguayan
writer and editor Eduardo Galleano, warns
in this vein that "that which is considered
'uncultured' often contains the seeds or fruits
of another culture," its beauty, its eloquence,
and its suffering.

Other voices ring through the pages of
"Multi-Cultural Literacy," more and richer
than can be represented here: the poet-farmer
Wendell Berry, whose gentle prose evokes the
delicacy of the rural ecology; Michelle Cliff,
whose writing pulses with the beat of
Jamaican reggae. They combine in a thun
dering denunciation of the ethnocentrism that
has hung like a curse over the heads of
colonized and colonizer alike, preventing us
from learning from the triumphs and disasters
that are our common heritage.
"We are not only dying," Michael Ventura
writes from Las Vegas; "We are living. And
we are struggling to share our lives, which is
all, finally, that 'culture' means."
That, in the last analysis, is the question
put by this provocative, challenging, enriching
volume: What, finally, does 'culture' mean?
The classical answers to this question —
elitist, parochial, disciplinary — no longer
seem adequate to the complex and fragile
world in which we find ourselves, "and the
artist or intellectual who doesn't comprehend
this," as one of our authors notes, "will not
form part of the great cultural debates of the
continent."
This is indubitably true, and explains the
pathetic wheeze that accompanies the
pronouncements of Bennett, Bloom and the
other fossils who, unfortunately, still preside
over the bureaucracies of art and ideas. There
is more wisdom in a single page of "Multi-
Cultural Literacy" than in all their sordid
best-sellers combined.
