# Politicians sling mud over noontime concert
## 
### DJ Berinstein Senior staff writer 
An election wouldn't be an
election without some type of
finger-pointing, and this
year's ASSU race is no ex
ception to this rule of thumb.
What might have been an
ordinary noon-time concert
in White Plaza yesterday

turned into a disorganized
mish-mash of music, a cultural festival and
claims of political maneuvering that some
candidates argue goes against election
limits.
Due to an alleged scheduling miscom
munication, a band originally scheduled to
play for the Council of Presidents slate
Students' Choice and a multi-cultural event
sponsored by ethnic student groups affili
ated with the People's Platform shared
time in White Plaza.
Several weeks ago, Students Choice
planned to have Marci and the Moongods,
a new student band, play on their behalf.
The band had agreed to play for free, but
ASSU Elections Commissioner Steve
Krauss said he would charge the slate "a
fair market value of $40" for the band's
performance, according to Mike
Rubenstein, a campaign manager for Stu
dents' First, a political party sponsoring
the Students' Choice slate for COP.
Wary of surpassing their election budget,
Students' Choice decided not to sponsor
the band, Rubenstein said.
If a COP slate goes over the $250 spend
ing limit, according to the ASSU bylaws,

the slate will be disqualified.
Despite Students' Choice withdrawing
their sponsorship, the band set up its equip
ment in White Plaza to play independently
for publicity purposes, according to band
member Ravi Bellur. Students First has
endorsed Bellur as a candidate for the Stu
dent Conduct Legislative Council.
Students First understood that its mem
bers "weren't allowed to pass out fliers,
use the microphone or have any connection
to the band" while it played. Rubenstein
said.
However, some band members,
Rubenstein and Students First co-campaign
manager William Thomas said they were
surprised to discover that the Asian-
American Students Association, the Black
Student Union and MEChA, a Chicano stu
dent organization, were organizing their
own event in White Plaza. The three groups
are affiliated with the People's Platform,
which is sponsoring its own slate for COP,
Slate of the Times.
According to Bellur, a band member went
to Student Organization Services to clear
the mix-up before beginning to play. Dis
covering the space was reserved for Marci
and the Moongods on behalf of the Students
First party, the band decided to share its
time with the People's Platform, he said.
The band played a few songs, allowed
the cultural festival to take place on the
stage and then played a few more songs
as the lunch hour ended.
