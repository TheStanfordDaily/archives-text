# Politicians sling mud over noontime concert
## 
### DJ Berinstein Senior staff writer 
An election wouldn't be an
election without some type of
finger-pointing, and this
year's ASSU race is no ex
ception to this rule of thumb.
What might have been an
ordinary noon-time concert
in White Plaza yesterday

turned into a disorganized
mish-mash of music, a cultural festival and
claims of political maneuvering that some
candidates argue goes against election
limits.
Due to an alleged scheduling miscom
munication, a band originally scheduled to
play for the Council of Presidents slate
Students' Choice and a multi-cultural event
sponsored by ethnic student groups affili
ated with the People's Platform shared
time in White Plaza.
Several weeks ago, Students Choice
planned to have Marci and the Moongods,
a new student band, play on their behalf.
The band had agreed to play for free, but
ASSU Elections Commissioner Steve
Krauss said he would charge the slate "a
fair market value of $40" for the band's
performance, according to Mike
Rubenstein, a campaign manager for Stu
dents' First, a political party sponsoring
the Students' Choice slate for COP.
Wary of surpassing their election budget,
Students' Choice decided not to sponsor
the band, Rubenstein said.
If a COP slate goes over the $250 spend
ing limit, according to the ASSU bylaws,

the slate will be disqualified.
Despite Students' Choice withdrawing
their sponsorship, the band set up its equip
ment in White Plaza to play independently
for publicity purposes, according to band
member Ravi Bellur. Students First has
endorsed Bellur as a candidate for the Stu
dent Conduct Legislative Council.
Students First understood that its mem
bers "weren't allowed to pass out fliers,
use the microphone or have any connection
to the band" while it played. Rubenstein
said.
However, some band members,
Rubenstein and Students First co-campaign
manager William Thomas said they were
surprised to discover that the Asian-
American Students Association, the Black
Student Union and MEChA, a Chicano stu
dent organization, were organizing their
own event in White Plaza. The three groups
are affiliated with the People's Platform,
which is sponsoring its own slate for COP,
Slate of the Times.
According to Bellur, a band member went
to Student Organization Services to clear
the mix-up before beginning to play. Dis
covering the space was reserved for Marci
and the Moongods on behalf of the Students
First party, the band decided to share its
time with the People's Platform, he said.
The band played a few songs, allowed
the cultural festival to take place on the
stage and then played a few more songs
as the lunch hour ended.
Representatives from the People's Plat
form and the ethnic groups involved said

the multi-cultural celebration was
intended to promote awareness of
AASA, BSU and MEChA special
fee assessments appearing on the
ASSU ballot.
There is no budget ceiling on
spending for fee assessments, only
for COP and senate.
Members of the minority
groups and the party itself, as
well as a number of student wit
nesses independent of either party,
agreed that the three minority
groups made no mention of
People's Platform nor any of its
candidates. Dean Chisiu, a junior
who witnessed the event, said the
announcements basically said,
"You should vote for our fee as
sessments."
The only mention of the

People's Platform, according to
these sources, was on stickers for
Slate of the Times distributed
during the performances and a
Slate of the Times poster near
the band's performance area that
had been placed earlier in the
week.
However, the Students' Choice
candidates and campaign manag
ers said the People's Platform
campaigned for its COP slate dur
ing the multicultural festival by
distributing fliers and stickers for
their candidates. Members also
argued that the People's Plat
form, because it is comprised of
four individual groups, also
benefits from an unclear determi
nation about who the groups are
actually campaigning for.
"They behaved in the exact
manner that we weren't allowed
to, and they should be charged,"
said Rubenstein. "They utilized
this campaign's equipment with

out paying for it."
Even if Krauss and Hearings
Commissioner Ed Sun rule after
the election that People's Plat
form must pay the full cost of the
performance, the program will
only violate election rules if the
slate's total costs exceed the $250
limit.
People's Platform representa
tive Julie Martinez said that
White Plaza is a free speech area
on campus, noting that a pro
choice table in White Plaza was
just as affiliated with the band
as was Slate of the Times.
Other People's Platform mem
bers pointed out that Students'
Choice also had a large black box
in the middle of White Plaza be
hind the viewing area for the
performances, advertising their
slate.
Martinez said she didn't see
how free speech in the form of
campaigning can be attributed to

one side or the other.
Krauss was not available for
comment last night.
Martinez asserted there was a
mix-up at Student Organization
Services between groups which
had reserved White Plaza.
However, Thomas claimed
there was no mix-up at SOS, and
there was no possibility that the
People's Platform could have
reserved White Plaza on such
short notice. He said he was upset
about "the fudged lines" between
fee assessment campaigning and
COP campaigning.
Martinez pointed out that in
order for a band to play in White
Plaza, it must be sponsored by or
be a part of a student organiza
tion. Since yesterday's band was
not sponsored by Students'
Choice, she said People's Platform
was doing them a favor by letting
them play.

People's Platform nor any of its
candidates. Dean Chisiu, a junior
who witnessed the event, said the
announcements basically said,
"You should vote for our fee as
sessments."
The only mention of the

People's Platform, according to
these sources, was on stickers for
Slate of the Times distributed
during the performances and a
Slate of the Times poster near
the band's performance area that
had been placed earlier in the
week.
However, the Students' Choice
candidates and campaign manag
ers said the People's Platform
campaigned for its COP slate dur
ing the multicultural festival by
distributing fliers and stickers for
their candidates. Members also
argued that the People's Plat
form, because it is comprised of
four individual groups, also
benefits from an unclear determi
nation about who the groups are
actually campaigning for.
"They behaved in the exact
manner that we weren't allowed
to, and they should be charged,"
said Rubenstein. "They utilized
this campaign's equipment with

out paying for it."
Even if Krauss and Hearings
Commissioner Ed Sun rule after
the election that People's Plat
form must pay the full cost of the
performance, the program will
only violate election rules if the
slate's total costs exceed the $250
limit.
People's Platform representa
tive Julie Martinez said that
White Plaza is a free speech area
on campus, noting that a pro
choice table in White Plaza was
just as affiliated with the band
as was Slate of the Times.
Other People's Platform mem
bers pointed out that Students'
Choice also had a large black box
in the middle of White Plaza be
hind the viewing area for the
performances, advertising their
slate.
Martinez said she didn't see
how free speech in the form of
campaigning can be attributed to

one side or the other.
Krauss was not available for
comment last night.
Martinez asserted there was a
mix-up at Student Organization
Services between groups which
had reserved White Plaza.
However, Thomas claimed
there was no mix-up at SOS, and
there was no possibility that the
People's Platform could have
reserved White Plaza on such
short notice. He said he was upset
about "the fudged lines" between
fee assessment campaigning and
COP campaigning.
Martinez pointed out that in
order for a band to play in White
Plaza, it must be sponsored by or
be a part of a student organiza
tion. Since yesterday's band was
not sponsored by Students'
Choice, she said People's Platform
was doing them a favor by letting
them play.
An election wouldn't be an
election without some type of
finger-pointing, and this
year's ASSU race is no ex
ception to this rule of thumb.
What might have been an
ordinary noon-time concert
in White Plaza yesterday

turned into a disorganized
mish-mash of music, a cultural festival and
claims of political maneuvering that some
candidates argue goes against election
limits.
Due to an alleged scheduling miscom
munication, a band originally scheduled to
play for the Council of Presidents slate
Students' Choice and a multi-cultural event
sponsored by ethnic student groups affili
ated with the People's Platform shared
time in White Plaza.
Several weeks ago, Students Choice
planned to have Marci and the Moongods,
a new student band, play on their behalf.
The band had agreed to play for free, but
ASSU Elections Commissioner Steve
Krauss said he would charge the slate "a
fair market value of $40" for the band's
performance, according to Mike
Rubenstein, a campaign manager for Stu
dents' First, a political party sponsoring
the Students' Choice slate for COP.
Wary of surpassing their election budget,
Students' Choice decided not to sponsor
the band, Rubenstein said.
If a COP slate goes over the $250 spend
ing limit, according to the ASSU bylaws,

the slate will be disqualified.
Despite Students' Choice withdrawing
their sponsorship, the band set up its equip
ment in White Plaza to play independently
for publicity purposes, according to band
member Ravi Bellur. Students First has
endorsed Bellur as a candidate for the Stu
dent Conduct Legislative Council.
Students First understood that its mem
bers "weren't allowed to pass out fliers,
use the microphone or have any connection
to the band" while it played. Rubenstein
said.
However, some band members,
Rubenstein and Students First co-campaign
manager William Thomas said they were
surprised to discover that the Asian-
American Students Association, the Black
Student Union and MEChA, a Chicano stu
dent organization, were organizing their
own event in White Plaza. The three groups
are affiliated with the People's Platform,
which is sponsoring its own slate for COP,
Slate of the Times.
According to Bellur, a band member went
to Student Organization Services to clear
the mix-up before beginning to play. Dis
covering the space was reserved for Marci
and the Moongods on behalf of the Students
First party, the band decided to share its
time with the People's Platform, he said.
The band played a few songs, allowed
the cultural festival to take place on the
stage and then played a few more songs
as the lunch hour ended.
Representatives from the People's Plat
form and the ethnic groups involved said

the multi-cultural celebration was
intended to promote awareness of
AASA, BSU and MEChA special
fee assessments appearing on the
ASSU ballot.
There is no budget ceiling on
spending for fee assessments, only
for COP and senate.
Members of the minority
groups and the party itself, as
well as a number of student wit
nesses independent of either party,
agreed that the three minority
groups made no mention of
People's Platform nor any of its
candidates. Dean Chisiu, a junior
who witnessed the event, said the
