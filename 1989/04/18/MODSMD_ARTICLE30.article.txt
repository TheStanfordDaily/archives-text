# Perseverance Press
## 'Whodunits' find a home in Menlo Park 
### Marina Krakovsky 
When no publisher would accept a children's book she wrote
without substantial revisions, Meredith Phillips started her own
publishing company.
That was in 1979. Since then, Perseverance Press has gone
from being a self-publisher to publishing mystery novels by
other writers. Still, the Stanford alumna (Class of '65) continues
to operate out of a room in her Menlo Park home. Her books
are stored in rows of boxes in the garage.
Asked the significance of the name, Phillips instantly says
that perseverance is "the most essential quality" needed to make
a small press succeed.
Small publishers face far greater difficulties in publicity than
do large presses. For small publishers, as Phillips notes, "getting
your books into bookstores is tough." Also, small presses confront

high printing costs, since they print
relatively fewer copies of each

book. "Obviously," she says,
"you don't get rich doing
this sort of thing."

Phillips' own job has
not been easy. To run
what she calls her
"one-woman operation"
means she has to do "a
million little things"

— everything from reading
and evaluating submitted man
uscripts (many of which are

disappointing) to writing up
her own press releases. For a
jacket cover of one of the
mysteries she published she
even posed as the shape for a

dead body tape-up. It is this
variety, this opportunity to
wear many different hats, that
Phillips really loves.

Her dedication and persever
ance have paid off. Persever
ance Press has published
seven books since 1984 and its
current mailing list — through
which Phillips does most of
her sales — has more than
10,000 names. One of the
mysteries she published,
"Murder Once Done," was
recently nominated for an
Edgar award (the Oscar of the
mystery world) for Best First
Mystery Novel of 1988.

This last distinction may be
due to Phillips' high standards
for the work she publishes.
Aiming at the traditional
whodunit, she advises potential
submitters against "gratuitous
violence, excessive gore and
exploitive sex." Taking pride
in the attractive trade paper
back format of her books —
larger than the average paper
back and with thicker pages
— Phillips says, "My books
are more like hardbacks."
Almost as if encouraging
others to get into the publish
ing business, she concludes,
"If you like to read, it's really
fun to make books."
