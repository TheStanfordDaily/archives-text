## Carey carries the load for Card 
### Robert Portnoy Senior staff writer 
"He threw a fastball on the out
side corner, and I just had a feeble
swing on it. I looked real bad and
missed it for strike one," Cardinal
right fielder Paul Carey remem
bers.
"I was looking for the ball out
there again. I think if a pitcher
sees a batter looks horrendous on
a pitch, he should come right back
with that pitch. He threw it just
about the same place.
"I got out front of it a little bit
and just drove it to left center. I
thought it was gone, but I wasn't
sure and was too excited to watch
it, so 1 ran hard to first base.
Then I saw it went out and it was
just incredible. I was numb and
I was tingling inside."
That home run by Carey, then
a freshman, will live forever in
Cardinal baseball lore. His 10th
inning grand slam gave the Stan
ford a 6-5 victory in a do-or-die
1987 College World Series game
against Louisiana State. The Car
dinal went on to win the first of
two straight NCAA titles, and if
Carey had done nothing else in
his Stanford career, Cardinal
faithful would still recall the
homer.
But he has done more. Quite a

bit more, in fact. "P.C." helped
lead his team in a command per
formance last season. The Cardi
nal did the impossible, repeating
as national champion and taking
its place in college baseball his
tory.
For Carey, the excitement of
that game-winning homer was
outdone just a few days later.
"The best feeling that I ever
had was the eighth and ninth in
ning against Oklahoma State in
the final game my freshman year.
I was out in the outfield and 1
knew inside that we were going
to beat them. That was the one
greatest feeling of my life, when
I knew we were going to be the
national champions," Carey said.
With two world series rings now
in his possession, Carey has a pro
fessional baseball career waiting
impatiently for him. But Carey
must have known he would be
tested before that stage of his life
began. The 1989 Cardinal season
is that test.
Stanford is 19-23 and a dismal
7-14 in the Pacific 10 Conference
Southern Division. The Cardinal
must get hot and stay hot if it
maintains any hope of postseason
play. Stanford showed signs of life
last weekend, taking two of three
at USC, and Carey has answered
the call.

He went 8-for-15 with two
homers and eight RBI in the series
and has hit .484 with six homers
and 14 RBI over his last nine
games. Carey's .331 average is
second on the club and his .575
slugging percentage, nine homers
and 34 RBI are tops.
With his traditional early
season funk a memory, the Car
dinal may well be carried on
Carey's ample shoulders.
"He's just got so much natural
power," senior second baseman
Frank Carey said. "It's God-given
talent. The scariest thing is that

he hasn't even come close to being
the hitter he can be. He can carry
a team by himself, dominate a
game."
"He can hit the ball out to all
fields," he added. "He handles the
outside pitch so well he can hit
it out. All he needs right now,
and you could see him doing it
the last few weeks, is to turn on
the inside pitch. He's starting to
learn to pull the ball in the air."
"That's one of the things the
scouts would like to see him do

few games.
more. They like to see a guy his
size turn on it and hit it out."
A pair of huge home runs to
right field last weekend are
evidence that Carey is doing just
that. Though a majority of his
Cardinal homers have gone out
left of center, Carey says he pulled
everything in high school and is
working to again turn on pitches
that come, as he calls it, "inside
half." Nobody doubts that he will.
"He's so strong he doesn't have
to hit the ball well for it to go
out," designated hitter Tim Grif
fin said. "Now that he's hitting
it on the nose, it can't help but
go out. He's not even swinging
hard."
Though all appears to have been
rosy for Carey since he arrived
on the Farm, he was a whisper
from leaving Stanford at the end
of fall quarter freshman year.
"Fall quarter 1 was hurt all the
time, I was sick, I had never
played fall baseball in my life,
back home we played two months
out of the year. Fall practices are
intense; I was just dead. I hated
it here, I wasn't doing that well
(in school), and I was kind of
homesick," Carey said.
"Something wouldn't let me
transfer inside, I said 'Paul don't
do it, give it a shot, let's see what
the season turns out like.' My
goal was to dress for the home
games freshman year. I came back
from Christmas, everything fell
into place, I got to start in the
first game, and I haven't missed
a start since," he added.
