TODAY —2:30 p.m. at Sunken Diamond.
RECORDS -Stanford (19-23), St Mary s (14-30).
STANFORD'S STARTER - Mark Carper RH (1-1, 7 50 ERA)
WHO'S HOT — Regular third baseman David Holbrook continues to be
the Cardinal's steadiest hitter. He has hit .378 in his last eight games.
Troy Paulsen, who has been a journeyman of late, starting at DH, left
field and shortstop, is .359 in his last nine games.
WHO'S NOT — Frank Carey, the Cardinal's leadoff hitter is still mired in
a slump that has brought his average down to .312 Tim Griffin, the
regular designated hitter, has gone 0-12 in his last four games and did
not start last Sunday at USC.
KEYS TO VICTORY — If Carper can put together a solid outing for seven
innings, as he did last week against San Francisco, the Cardinal should
have no trouble with the Gaels, who have a team ERA of 4.93 and
batting average of .239. It's crunch time for a regional berth and the
Cardinal must win all of its midweek conference games to be considered
for postseason play.
