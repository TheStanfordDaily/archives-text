# Baseball flicks test devotion, imagination of moviegoer

Even the most dedicated baseball
and movie fans had to be groaning
when they heard that two more
baseball movies were being released this
month.
That makes a total of five movies with
the national pastime as its subject or
backdrop within the past year. If Holly
wood has plans on resurrecting the West
ern, the plot will probably involve a battle
between the Texas Rangers and the
Cleveland Indians.
Amazingly, despite the glut of baseball
movies that has hit America, all of them
have something to offer. And thanks to
home video cassette recorders and neigh
borhood theaters, one could probably
make a weekend of seeing all five of them.
The first of the recent baseball bunch
to come out was "Bull Durham", which
hit theaters early last summer. I had
some problems when I was watching this
story about minor-leaguers on the rise

and fall and the woman that loves them
all. First and foremost of those was my
sister groaning in the seat next to me
every time Susan Sarandon came on the
screen.
Now, Sarandon's role as Annie Savoy
has been lauded by most reviewers as a
great portrayal of the independent woman
— woman as actor in instead of pawn

of society. However, when it wasn't in
ducing me to elbow her in the ribs, the
periodic wailing of my sister (an inde
pendent 23-year-old actor in society her
self) alerted me to the fact that while
Annie was a true woman-of-the-80s, the
things she said made her too much of a
nitwit to be any kind of role model.
1 had the same sort of problems with
Kevin Costner's dialogue. 1 mean, it was
a great moment when Crash Davis solilo
quized to Annie about how he liked "long,
slow, deep wet kisses that last for three
days" and all that, but I can barely imag
ine a poet laureate, let alone a jour
neyman catcher, coming up with those
lines.
For me, scenes on a baseball field can
be as impossible as Robert Redford
literally knocking the cover off the ball
(in"The Natural"), but dialogue has to
be realistic. That's not to say that I didn't
enjoy the movie overall; I'm nitpicking

because everybody else seemed to go gaga
over it. I just wonder if the "Bull Dur
ham" characters could ever hear them
selves talk.
I wouldn't necessarily recommend
"Stealing Home", which came out on
the heels of "Bull Durham", to a base
ball fan. I don't know which came first,
the screenplay or the title, but Mark Har
mon stole home enough to make that
rare act of glory seem mundane. In gen
eral, the baseball scenes were rather
mundane.
To movie aficionadoes, however,
"Stealing Home" might be an interesting
choice. It proves once again that no mat
ter what the material or the supporting
cast, Jodie Foster lifts whatever film she
is in to a higher level. Also, it was in
teresting that the young actor who played
Mark Harmon's character as a child in
the numerous flashback sequences actu

ally outshone Harmon on the screen.
Coming out last fall was the docudrama
"Eight Men Out", starring the best, wor&t
and newest of that tired old gang, the
"Brat Pack."
"Eight Men Out" was automatically a
very ambitious movie, because the story
of the 1919 Chicago Black Sox is by no
means one that is cut-and-dry and can
be told with ease. Given the fact that the
author of the book "Eight Men Out",
which is the current authoritative work
on the Black Sox scandal, was in the
movie, one has to believe that he helped
ensure that this was a faily accurate
portrayal of what happened.
Eight Men Out fizzled at the box
office and I'm not sure why, but
maybe it was because it didn't suc
cumb to the peer pressure of weaving


JON WEISMAN
some dumb interpersonal rela
tionship into the story (see
League", below).
This movie was truly a baseball
movie, about the pressures the
game puts on its players both on
and off the field. The acting and
screenplay is solid. I'd say "Eight
Men Out" deserved a better fate.
If "Eight Men Out" was a movie
as ambitious as Donald Trump,
"Major League" is about as am
bitious a cinematic enterprise as
Donald Duck. It's so without

drive, in fact, that when the
players on the Cleveland Indians
resolve to "win the whole thing,"
they're talking about the division
title, not the World Series or even
the American League pennant.
But that's how the movie tri
umphs. "Major League" has got
good characters — eccentrics like
Annie Savoy and Crash Davis but
somehow more believable — and
let's them carry the movie and
run with it. "Major League" has
no message to speak of and
doesn't apologize for that, which
is great.
For some reason, the film
makers felt compelled to intro
duce a dumb interpersonal rela

tionship as a sidestory in the
movie. It had to have been like,
"Well, we've got Tom Berenger in
this movie; he's got to have a love
interest." Or maybe it's in
Berenger's contract: private dress
ing room, $250,000 and love in
terest.
I have nothing against inter
personal relationships, espe
cially dumb ones, but you
knew what was going to happen
with this one the moment it
began. In this case, give me Crash
and Annie.
The fifth in our odysssey of
baseball movies, "Field of
Dreams", is just coming out. This

also stars Costner and therefore
doubly risks being tossed aside by
baseball fans and movie patrons
wondering, "Haven't we seen
enough already?"
However, even if you're worn
out, give "Field of Dreams" a
chance. It is based upon a fantas
tic novel by W.P. Kinsella entitled
"Shoeless Joe."
No, this isn't "Eight Men Out"
all over again; besides Joe Jack
son, the book also features J.D.
Salinger as a main character, to
give you an idea of where it's
coming from.
If the movie is anything like
the book, it's awesome. If it isn't,
go read the book — and expect

that you've seen the last of the
baseball movies for a while. Where
are the great tractor-pull movies,
anyway?
Oh, by the way — the above
discussion was not meant
to mark the beginnings of
my career as a movie reviewer.
Rather, it was only to give me
the opportunity to segue from
sports and comment on a partic
ular actress. Her name is Winona
Ryder, and this sylph is also in
two movies being released this
spring: "Great Balls of Fire" and
"Heathers."
I recently read an interview of
Ryder, two parts of which stuck
out. The first was that Ryder said

she has a policy of not doing any
nude scenes. As Ryder is 17 years
old, I found this policy to be
sound, and somewhat comforting.
Most of all, it strikes me as legal.
The second caveat of the inter
view was the fact that Ryder was
named after her hometown of
Winona, Minn. This inspired from
me respect as well as envy, for
who wouldn't want to be named
Woodland Hills Weisman. (One
wonders how many first names
President Bush would have had).
That's all for now. If anyone
out there thinks I should be more
relevant to Stanford Sports —
hey, you can always write to
Sports Mailbag.

Now, Sarandon's role as Annie Savoy
has been lauded by most reviewers as a
great portrayal of the independent woman
— woman as actor in instead of pawn

of society. However, when it wasn't in
ducing me to elbow her in the ribs, the
periodic wailing of my sister (an inde
pendent 23-year-old actor in society her
self) alerted me to the fact that while
Annie was a true woman-of-the-80s, the
things she said made her too much of a
nitwit to be any kind of role model.
1 had the same sort of problems with
Kevin Costner's dialogue. 1 mean, it was
a great moment when Crash Davis solilo
quized to Annie about how he liked "long,
slow, deep wet kisses that last for three
days" and all that, but I can barely imag
ine a poet laureate, let alone a jour
neyman catcher, coming up with those
lines.
For me, scenes on a baseball field can
be as impossible as Robert Redford
literally knocking the cover off the ball
(in"The Natural"), but dialogue has to
be realistic. That's not to say that I didn't
enjoy the movie overall; I'm nitpicking

because everybody else seemed to go gaga
over it. I just wonder if the "Bull Dur
ham" characters could ever hear them
selves talk.
I wouldn't necessarily recommend
"Stealing Home", which came out on
the heels of "Bull Durham", to a base
ball fan. I don't know which came first,
the screenplay or the title, but Mark Har
mon stole home enough to make that
rare act of glory seem mundane. In gen
eral, the baseball scenes were rather
mundane.
To movie aficionadoes, however,
"Stealing Home" might be an interesting
choice. It proves once again that no mat
ter what the material or the supporting
cast, Jodie Foster lifts whatever film she
is in to a higher level. Also, it was in
teresting that the young actor who played
Mark Harmon's character as a child in
the numerous flashback sequences actu

ally outshone Harmon on the screen.
Coming out last fall was the docudrama
"Eight Men Out", starring the best, wor&t
and newest of that tired old gang, the
"Brat Pack."
"Eight Men Out" was automatically a
very ambitious movie, because the story
of the 1919 Chicago Black Sox is by no
means one that is cut-and-dry and can
be told with ease. Given the fact that the
author of the book "Eight Men Out",
which is the current authoritative work
on the Black Sox scandal, was in the
movie, one has to believe that he helped
ensure that this was a faily accurate
portrayal of what happened.
Eight Men Out fizzled at the box
office and I'm not sure why, but
maybe it was because it didn't suc
cumb to the peer pressure of weaving


JON WEISMAN
some dumb interpersonal rela
tionship into the story (see
League", below).
This movie was truly a baseball
movie, about the pressures the
game puts on its players both on
and off the field. The acting and
screenplay is solid. I'd say "Eight
Men Out" deserved a better fate.
If "Eight Men Out" was a movie
as ambitious as Donald Trump,
"Major League" is about as am
bitious a cinematic enterprise as
Donald Duck. It's so without

drive, in fact, that when the
players on the Cleveland Indians
resolve to "win the whole thing,"
they're talking about the division
title, not the World Series or even
the American League pennant.
But that's how the movie tri
umphs. "Major League" has got
good characters — eccentrics like
Annie Savoy and Crash Davis but
somehow more believable — and
let's them carry the movie and
run with it. "Major League" has
no message to speak of and
doesn't apologize for that, which
is great.
For some reason, the film
makers felt compelled to intro
duce a dumb interpersonal rela

tionship as a sidestory in the
movie. It had to have been like,
"Well, we've got Tom Berenger in
this movie; he's got to have a love
interest." Or maybe it's in
Berenger's contract: private dress
ing room, $250,000 and love in
terest.
I have nothing against inter
personal relationships, espe
cially dumb ones, but you
knew what was going to happen
with this one the moment it
began. In this case, give me Crash
and Annie.
The fifth in our odysssey of
baseball movies, "Field of
Dreams", is just coming out. This

also stars Costner and therefore
doubly risks being tossed aside by
baseball fans and movie patrons
wondering, "Haven't we seen
enough already?"
However, even if you're worn
out, give "Field of Dreams" a
chance. It is based upon a fantas
tic novel by W.P. Kinsella entitled
"Shoeless Joe."
No, this isn't "Eight Men Out"
all over again; besides Joe Jack
son, the book also features J.D.
Salinger as a main character, to
give you an idea of where it's
coming from.
If the movie is anything like
the book, it's awesome. If it isn't,
go read the book — and expect

that you've seen the last of the
baseball movies for a while. Where
are the great tractor-pull movies,
anyway?
Oh, by the way — the above
discussion was not meant
to mark the beginnings of
my career as a movie reviewer.
Rather, it was only to give me
the opportunity to segue from
sports and comment on a partic
ular actress. Her name is Winona
Ryder, and this sylph is also in
two movies being released this
spring: "Great Balls of Fire" and
"Heathers."
I recently read an interview of
Ryder, two parts of which stuck
out. The first was that Ryder said

she has a policy of not doing any
nude scenes. As Ryder is 17 years
old, I found this policy to be
sound, and somewhat comforting.
Most of all, it strikes me as legal.
The second caveat of the inter
view was the fact that Ryder was
named after her hometown of
Winona, Minn. This inspired from
me respect as well as envy, for
who wouldn't want to be named
Woodland Hills Weisman. (One
wonders how many first names
President Bush would have had).
That's all for now. If anyone
out there thinks I should be more
relevant to Stanford Sports —
hey, you can always write to
Sports Mailbag.
Even the most dedicated baseball
and movie fans had to be groaning
when they heard that two more
baseball movies were being released this
month.
That makes a total of five movies with
the national pastime as its subject or
backdrop within the past year. If Holly
wood has plans on resurrecting the West
ern, the plot will probably involve a battle
between the Texas Rangers and the
Cleveland Indians.
Amazingly, despite the glut of baseball
movies that has hit America, all of them
have something to offer. And thanks to
home video cassette recorders and neigh
borhood theaters, one could probably
make a weekend of seeing all five of them.
The first of the recent baseball bunch
to come out was "Bull Durham", which
hit theaters early last summer. I had
some problems when I was watching this
story about minor-leaguers on the rise

and fall and the woman that loves them
all. First and foremost of those was my
sister groaning in the seat next to me
every time Susan Sarandon came on the
screen.
