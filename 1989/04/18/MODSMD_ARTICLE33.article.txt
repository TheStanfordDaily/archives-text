# Baseball flicks test devotion, imagination of moviegoer

### 
Even the most dedicated baseball
and movie fans had to be groaning
when they heard that two more
baseball movies were being released this
month.
That makes a total of five movies with
the national pastime as its subject or
backdrop within the past year. If Holly
wood has plans on resurrecting the West
ern, the plot will probably involve a battle
between the Texas Rangers and the
Cleveland Indians.
Amazingly, despite the glut of baseball
movies that has hit America, all of them
have something to offer. And thanks to
home video cassette recorders and neigh
borhood theaters, one could probably
make a weekend of seeing all five of them.
The first of the recent baseball bunch
to come out was "Bull Durham", which
hit theaters early last summer. I had
some problems when I was watching this
story about minor-leaguers on the rise

and fall and the woman that loves them
all. First and foremost of those was my
sister groaning in the seat next to me
every time Susan Sarandon came on the
screen.
Now, Sarandon's role as Annie Savoy
has been lauded by most reviewers as a
great portrayal of the independent woman
â€” woman as actor in instead of pawn

of society. However, when it wasn't in
ducing me to elbow her in the ribs, the
periodic wailing of my sister (an inde
pendent 23-year-old actor in society her
self) alerted me to the fact that while
Annie was a true woman-of-the-80s, the
things she said made her too much of a
nitwit to be any kind of role model.
1 had the same sort of problems with
Kevin Costner's dialogue. 1 mean, it was
a great moment when Crash Davis solilo
quized to Annie about how he liked "long,
slow, deep wet kisses that last for three
days" and all that, but I can barely imag
ine a poet laureate, let alone a jour
neyman catcher, coming up with those
lines.
For me, scenes on a baseball field can
be as impossible as Robert Redford
literally knocking the cover off the ball
(in"The Natural"), but dialogue has to
be realistic. That's not to say that I didn't
enjoy the movie overall; I'm nitpicking

because everybody else seemed to go gaga
over it. I just wonder if the "Bull Dur
ham" characters could ever hear them
selves talk.
I wouldn't necessarily recommend
"Stealing Home", which came out on
the heels of "Bull Durham", to a base
ball fan. I don't know which came first,
the screenplay or the title, but Mark Har
mon stole home enough to make that
rare act of glory seem mundane. In gen
eral, the baseball scenes were rather
mundane.
To movie aficionadoes, however,
"Stealing Home" might be an interesting
choice. It proves once again that no mat
ter what the material or the supporting
cast, Jodie Foster lifts whatever film she
is in to a higher level. Also, it was in
teresting that the young actor who played
Mark Harmon's character as a child in
the numerous flashback sequences actu

ally outshone Harmon on the screen.
Coming out last fall was the docudrama
"Eight Men Out", starring the best, wor&t
and newest of that tired old gang, the
"Brat Pack."
"Eight Men Out" was automatically a
very ambitious movie, because the story
of the 1919 Chicago Black Sox is by no
means one that is cut-and-dry and can
be told with ease. Given the fact that the
author of the book "Eight Men Out",
which is the current authoritative work
on the Black Sox scandal, was in the
movie, one has to believe that he helped
ensure that this was a faily accurate
portrayal of what happened.
Eight Men Out fizzled at the box
office and I'm not sure why, but
maybe it was because it didn't suc
cumb to the peer pressure of weaving
