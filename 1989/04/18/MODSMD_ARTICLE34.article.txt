# Out of the spotlight, Richards keeps winning
## 
### Cameron Macky Senior staff writer 
There are 1,150 individual seats
in the new Stanford Tennis Sta
dium. Each brand-new seat is in
finitely more comfortable than
the wooden benches they replaced.
And, to the very last chair, they
all face Courts No. 1, 2 and 3,
giving the crowd a great view of
the top three singles matches.
For those fans who want to
watch the action on the back
courts, there's plenty of standing
room along a wall behind the sec
tion of box seats. This is a swell
vantage point for viewing the
fourth match and also offers a
passable view of the No. 5 contest.
As for sixth singles, well. . . .the
last court is so far away from the
stands that even those few spec
tators standing along the wall find
it hard to keep up with the action.
Most fans are content to follow
the score on the electronic
scoreboard while they sit and
watch the top three matches.
And that's a shame, because on
the northernmost tennis court in
the new complex, far away from
the crowds, Stanford's Barry Ric
hards has been putting on quite
a show all season.
Richards, one of the Cardinal's
three co-captains, has quietly
amassed an 11-1 record this
season, with all but one of those
wins coming at the No. 6 spot.

Time and again, he has won, and
time and again, only a handful of
people have been there to watch.
That's just fine with Richards.
"It doesn't bother me that there
aren't hundreds of people watch
ing," he says."I like having a few
people there to be behind me, but
not huge crowds."
To that end, two sets of wood
three-tiered bleachers were placed
near the No. 6 court last week to
allow fans the chance to watch
Richards perform. The bleachers
can hold about 50 people.
"[The bleachersl are a really
good idea, because otherwise no
one can get down there," Richards
says.
However, the fans that matter
the most to Richards have been
watching all along. "I kind of like
having the few people that want
to come watch me," he says,"the
few people who are really going
to be down there supporting me
and are interested in the match."
For Richards, playing in front
of small crowds certainly beats
not playing at all — which was
just what he was doing at the
start of the season. After closing
out the 1988 campaign at the No.
6 spot (he was 7-4 at that position
a year ago) Richards seemed to
have a good shot at starting again
this year.
However, he started 1989 on
the bench, mainly because of a
series of injuries that have

plagued him this year. "My whole
life I've never really been injured
for the amount of time I was in
jured this fall," he says."I had
problems with my shoulder, and
(after) I took some time off over
Christmas I came back to play in
a tournament in Palm Springs,
and hurt my back pretty bad."
The net result of the back in
jury was that Richards wasn't at
full strength when the Cardinal
was trying to get its singles lineup
in order. "At the most critical time
for determining the team, the
challenge matches right after
Christmas, I had a really bad back
injury and couldn't play that
much," he says.
"I think that hurt me because
I hadn't played as many matches
as the other guys. Once I started
getting in the lineup, playing, and
showing that I play pretty
well, I think that might have
changed coach's mind a little bit."
There's nothing quite like staying
undefeated through nine matches
to make a coach pay attention to
you.
Richards' sole 1989 loss, ironi
cally, came during the Cardinal's
biggest team win of the season,
the 5-4 squeaker last Tuesday at
California, when Cal's Mark
Lucena beat him 1-6, 6-3, 7-5.
According to Richards, though, he
should still be undefeated. "I
definitely think I should have won
that match," he says."I was

breaking his serve almost every
time, but I wasn't able to hold
my serve, which is usually one of
my strong points."
Richards' strongest point, how
ever, is his resolve to win, as he
showed quite clearly during the
Cardinal's recent journey to Los
Angeles. At UCLA, Richards
dropped the first set of his match
6-3 before rebounding to take the
second set and a 5-3 lead in the
third. After losing three of the
next four, he then won the tie
breaker for Stanford's onlv win

Co-captain Barry Richards has compiled an 11-1 record this season
despite laboring in obscurity at No. 6 singles.
of the day.
The following afternoon at USC
provided Richards with his tough
est test of the season. Playing
Andy Olypant in the day's longest
match (by far), Richards overcame
both Olypant and an inane umpire
to secure a split in the singles
matches. "I knew we were down
3-2, and everyone was watching
me play and expecting me to win,"
he says. "That was a pretty tough
match, but luckily I got through.
"I don't think I'm as good of
an athlete as some of the other
guys on the team, but I think
that I know how to win really
well," Richards continues. "Some
how, when the going gets tough,
when it gets close in the third
set, I feel that I can win. I feel
that's when I'm the strongest.
"That's another reason my Cal
match disappointed me a lot, be
cause that's the kind of match I
usually win, and I lost."
The loss apparently didn't
bother Richards too much, for he
came right back to sweep his two
matches last weekend. He also

won both his doubles matches
with Dan Turbow.
The doubles shuffle has been
disconcerting at times. "It's been
tough for everyone," Richards
says.
"It's just like it was last year
at sixth singles, because we had
me, Curtis (Dunn) and Glenn
(Solomon) all playing," Richards
continues. "It's a lot of pressure
when you go out there knowing
that if you don't do well, you don't
play well, then you're not in there
anymore. That's even harder than
worrying about the match. It gets
you sidetracked from the match
sometimes, which is bad for the
team. It's really tough."
Odds are that no matter what
happens to the Cardinal's doubles
situation, Richards at No. 6
singles will continue to come
through, match after match.
