# Women's water polo splashes in the spring
## 
### T.C. Hall Staff writer 
Contrary to popular belief, the wide world
of water polo is not exclusive to men. Those
avid followers who frequent deGuerre in the
fall to watch guys churn up the water in
funny bathing caps will be pleasantly surprised
to know that Stanford plays in the spring as
well, but this team's Speedos go all the way
up the body.
All kidding aside, it is a pleasure to introduce
the best kept secret of Stanford athletics —
the women's water polo team.
The women's team is not as prestigious as
its male counterpart, but despite the fact that
they are a club team, no one thinks women
play water polo, and they have to fight for
funds and pool time, the 4-4 1989 squad is
not doing so bad.
The women also do not have the luxury of
picking from a wide talent pool as do the men

(women's water polo is even more uncommon
on the high school level), and it is only the
rarest of freshmen who walks onto The Farm
with any kind of playing experience at all.
Instead the team is forged together hy bored
ex-swimmers and interested athletes looking
for a sport. Bound together by the itch to
compete and the infectious fun of the sport,
about 20 women train six times a week be
cause they want to, not because they are
obligated.
With no scholarships or boosters breathing
down their necks, the women's water polo
team reveals the beauty of club sports —
people play because it is fun and they want
to be there.
Practices are always optional partly because
the team is not varsity and partly because
the coaches are employed by the athletes.
That is the greatly unique thing about club
sports — the players are completely in charge,
and they like it that way. No athletic depart
ment hassles to deal with, just hire a coach

each year, pay for some airfare and balls, and
pln y
"Play" is obviously the most important part
of the greatly oversimplified last sequence,
and the women do not let their club status
effect their intensity for the sport.
Looking both above and below the water of
a normal match shows the women to take
their game seriously. Scratching and kicking
is just as common place as with the men, and
it is a lucky player who comes out of a match
completely unscathed.
With an annual national championship
(which is being held this year in Santa Bar
bara) it is not as though they are playing for
nothing.
Yet being a sport that is alien to most
women does make the team a bit unique.
Most people come to the team because of the
novelty, and stay because of the challenge of
learning how to play.
