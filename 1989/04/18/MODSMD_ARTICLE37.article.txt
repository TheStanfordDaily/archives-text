# Crew rows to finals
##

Stanford and Harvard are
rarely mentioned in the same
breath among crew aficiona
dos.
However, the Stanford wom
en's varsity eight boat made a
case to change that last week
end at the Redwood Shores
Stanford Rowing Classic at
Redwood Shores. The Cardinal
crew, after posting impressive
victories over Brown and Wis
consin in the opening races,
bowed to Radcliffe by three
seconds in a hard-fought final.
The surprising second-place
showing against a strong field
establishes the Stanford

women as a legitimate national
power, perhaps even making
them one of the top four crews
in the nation, according to
coach John Davis.
The men's varsity did not
fare as well, finishing sixth
after losing to Harvard in the
opening round, heating Califor
nia, and losing to UCLA in the
race for fifth place.
A comment by the Radcliffe
coach to Davis seemed to sum
up the Cardinal women's ef
forts: "Every time this team
puts the boat in the water they
go faster," he said.
The team did just that, pos
ting a time of 6:37 in the final.
