# Getting a grip on Stanford's loose alcohol regulations
## 
### Elaine Riggs Staff writer 
Editor's note: This is the first
of a series examining Stanford's
plans to revise the alcohol policy.

The alcohol policy Jim Lyons
administered when he was an RA
at Allegheny College was a couple
barstools removed from the one
he oversees today as Stanford's
Dean of Student Affairs.
Back then, the school policy
stated students should not drink.
At all.
Lyons remembers one evening

when the policy was grossly vio
lated. He and Bruce, a fellow res
ident assistant, returned to the
dorm after seeing a movie.
"We walked into the lounge and
the students were all over the
place, going crazy, playing ping
pong ... I said, Bruce, what have
we here?' "
"And Bruce said. 'Jim, 1 think
these students are half
smashed.' "
Lyons soon discovered that an
enterprising young colleague had
broken into the soda pop vending
machine and replaced the vanilla
syrup with gin. Suddenly, every

one decided they were in the mood
for a soda.
Leaning hack in his chair, the
older and wiser Lyons gets to the
point of the story.
"I'm illustrating that when
there are specific rules, they can
be gotten around," Lyons says.
"No Stanford student is incapa
ble of getting around a rule."
That's why, according to Lyons,
there are no specific University
alcohol rules.
Currently under review by
Lyons, the new University alcohol
policy calls for students to be re
sponsible for their actions.

The intentional vagueness of the
policy means that students must
make their own decisions about
specific alcohol-related matters
such as EANABS (Equally Attrac
tive Non-Alcoholic Beverages) and
IDs.
"We're deliberately trying to
avoid being prescriptive," Lyons
says, because specific rules would
mean that enforcing the rules
"would become a game and then
the purpose of it would be lost."
"We're trying to say, think
before you act," Lyons says.
Does that mean Stanford stu
dents can technically get away

with anything? No, according to
Lyons.
The University may respond to
improper behavior. The local
police may respond to broken
alcohol-related laws.
This division means that a stu
dent's actions may violate the
state laws while not violating the
University policy. Or vice versa.
Or both. To illustrate:
Joe Sophomore is drunk and
walking through the Quad, yelling
obscenities and taking swings at
passers-by.
Joe has violated state law be
cause he is under 21 years of age

and he is under the influence of
alcohol. The Stanford police may
take action against him for break
ing the law.
Joe has violated the University
policy because he is not behaving
responsibly. The University might
take action against him not be
cause he was drunk, but because
of his hurtful behavior.
"It's not the University's job to
enforce the law," Lyons says.
Still, the Office of Residential
Education advocates guidelines
for party situations. These in
clude:
• having EANABS available in
visible and plentiful supply;
• having food available when al
cohol is served;
• checking for Stanford student
IDs at the door; and
• not having alcohol be the
focus of parties.
These tried-and-true guide
lines, according to Assoc. Dean of
Residential Education Alice Sup
ton, have ensured safer parties
for years at Stanford.
Res Ed also recommends notify
ing a police officer of a party
beforehand as a courtesy gesture
and to ward off confusion if the
officer decides to visit the party.

"You want the police there.
Every now and then you're going
to get a real bozo who will show
up at the door and start beating
up on people," Lyons says.
"You can't control all these
risks," Lyons says.
In addition, over at the Cowell
Student. Health Center, Project
RISC (Risk Reduction of In
toxicants in the Stanford Commu
nity) has developed Party Source,
a student-run party consulting
service available to students plan
ning parties.
Party Source offers lists of in
formation on party supplies rang
ing from local bands to different
kinds of food.
Party Source also provides
training on how to reduce resi
dence liability when planning a
party.
"We try to maximize the fun

while minimizing the risks of
throwing a party," says Cowell
health promotions specialist
Louise Miller.
Party Source is still in the form
ative stages this quarter, although
they have sponsored several dorm
parties and received calls for as
sistance. By this fall, Party Source
plans to sell a variety of party
supplies including pre-made
punch mixes and high-quality
EANABS.
While some on campus may
wish that Stanford had specific
alcohol rules like many other uni
versities, Lyons says he does not
forsee specific rules in the future.
"I think there's a cry for
specificity," Lyons says.
"The point is that we don't want
our parties to be focused on al
cohol," Lyons adds.
