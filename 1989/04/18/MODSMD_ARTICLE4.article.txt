# Getting a grip on Stanford's loose alcohol regulations
## 
### Elaine Riggs Staff writer 
Editor's note: This is the first
of a series examining Stanford's
plans to revise the alcohol policy.

The alcohol policy Jim Lyons
administered when he was an RA
at Allegheny College was a couple
barstools removed from the one
he oversees today as Stanford's
Dean of Student Affairs.
Back then, the school policy
stated students should not drink.
At all.
Lyons remembers one evening

when the policy was grossly vio
lated. He and Bruce, a fellow res
ident assistant, returned to the
dorm after seeing a movie.
"We walked into the lounge and
the students were all over the
place, going crazy, playing ping
pong ... I said, Bruce, what have
we here?' "
"And Bruce said. 'Jim, 1 think
these students are half
smashed.' "
Lyons soon discovered that an
enterprising young colleague had
broken into the soda pop vending
machine and replaced the vanilla
syrup with gin. Suddenly, every

one decided they were in the mood
for a soda.
Leaning hack in his chair, the
older and wiser Lyons gets to the
point of the story.
"I'm illustrating that when
there are specific rules, they can
be gotten around," Lyons says.
"No Stanford student is incapa
ble of getting around a rule."
That's why, according to Lyons,
there are no specific University
alcohol rules.
Currently under review by
Lyons, the new University alcohol
policy calls for students to be re
sponsible for their actions.

The intentional vagueness of the
policy means that students must
make their own decisions about
specific alcohol-related matters
such as EANABS (Equally Attrac
tive Non-Alcoholic Beverages) and
IDs.
"We're deliberately trying to
avoid being prescriptive," Lyons
says, because specific rules would
mean that enforcing the rules
"would become a game and then
the purpose of it would be lost."
"We're trying to say, think
before you act," Lyons says.
Does that mean Stanford stu
dents can technically get away

with anything? No, according to
Lyons.
The University may respond to
improper behavior. The local
police may respond to broken
alcohol-related laws.
This division means that a stu
dent's actions may violate the
state laws while not violating the
University policy. Or vice versa.
Or both. To illustrate:
Joe Sophomore is drunk and
walking through the Quad, yelling
obscenities and taking swings at
passers-by.
Joe has violated state law be
cause he is under 21 years of age

and he is under the influence of
alcohol. The Stanford police may
take action against him for break
ing the law.
Joe has violated the University
policy because he is not behaving
responsibly. The University might
take action against him not be
cause he was drunk, but because
of his hurtful behavior.
"It's not the University's job to
enforce the law," Lyons says.
Still, the Office of Residential
Education advocates guidelines
