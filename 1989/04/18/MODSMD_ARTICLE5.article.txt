# South Africa expert expresses hope for Namibian peace plan

As a key player in creating a Namibian
peace plan, Chester Crocker, assistant sec
retary of state for African affairs under
the Reagan administration, said he learned
that negotiation is more effective than coer
cion as a tool for peace.
Crocker, who kicked off the Stanford
African Students Association's Africa Week
1989, told a crowd of about 70 in Cubberley
Auditorium last night that peace could best
be achieved through trade-offs. Each party
should "give something in order to get
something," and the result will be a "peace
without losers," he said.
In 1981, when Crocker began his term,
the situation in southwest Africa was "a
snarl-up." A civil war in Angola pitted the
Cuban-backed government against a faction
supported by South Africa. Angola was "in
shambles," he said.
At the same time, South Africa was de
nying neighboring Namibia its indepen
dence, which United Nations Security
Council Resolution 435 had guaranteed,
according to Crocker.
The goals of the United States in the
region, Crocker explained, were indepen
dence for Namibia and the withdrawal of
Cuban troops from Angola, with the overall

goal of peace in that country. "A panoply
of different interests," including those of
Angola, Cuba, South Africa, Namibia, the
United States and the Soviet Union, made
a peace proposal appear improbable, he
said.
Crocker, as a part of the U.S. team,
found a solution to this seemingly impos
sible problem by diplomatically linking to
gether Namibian independence and the
removal of Cuban troops from Angola.
I he United States did this in such a way
that there were "no losers in the settle
ment," Crocker said. The treaty signed Dec.
22, 1988, provided for a trade-off in which
South Africa would implement Resolution
435 in exchange for the withdrawal of
Cuban troops from Angola.
Crocker said the plan offers multiple les
sons for the creation of successful foreign
policy. A key to peace, negotiation proved
itself more effective than coercion.
Patience, Crocker said, is essential to
achieve peace. Tue process of creating the
peace plan took eight years. Foreign policy,
Crocker admonished, is "not a Super Howl
game. You can't look at ticking clocks."
Crocker also stressed that general,
"abstract formulas," do not work in the
area of foreign policy
