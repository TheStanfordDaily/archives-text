# Financial expert supports public service

"The last eight years have been a
social disaster, but I don't blame
capitalism," Wall Street financier Her
bert Allen Jr. claimed yesterday, cap
tivating an audience of about 50
students at Schiff House.
Allen, who at age 26 became president
of an investment banking company, said
"capitalism is not responsible for
poverty and hunger." His firm, Allen
and Co., gained nationwide attention
when it represented Australian Pub
lisher Rupert Murdock in his bid to
acquire Warner Communications in
1984.
Allen is also known for his successful
business venture with Columbia Pic
tures. In 1973, he bought controlling
interest of Columbia Pictures for seven
dollars a share. He then proceeded to
sell those shares in 1982 to the Coca-
Cola Co. for $70 each. "I got involved

by accidont," he commented.
He claimed that people can make
great improvements in poor social con
ditions by getting involved with the gov
ernment, especially on a local level. And,
instead of "working like mad people"
to solve the problems in South Africa,
we should be sticking to home issues,
like those in East Palo Alto, he said.
When asked about ways he has helped
improve social conditions, Allen said he
helps support those candidates in
politics who he believes will help the
country. He added that he donates to
various causes.
Supporting a requirement of public
service after college, he said two years
of public work, such as teaching, could
do a lot to help others.
In addition, Allen addressed the issue
of Japan's recent economic climb. He
said Americans should be happy that
the .Japanese have prospered. "We con
quered a country which has worked out

real well," he said, attributing some of
Japan's financial success to American
aid after World War 11.
On the other hand, publicity about
Japan's prosperity is "very media
driven," Allen said. "Japan is no better
than us," he said, claiming that pollu
tion in Tokyo and the high teen suicide
rate are problems in Japan.
Allen, who majored in American his
tory and literature at Williams College,
also applauded the value of a liberal
arts education. "Liberal arts is a won
derful preparation for business," he
said.
When questioned by a student who
didn't like the Democratic or the Re
publican party, Allen wittily told the
student "that doesn't leave you many
option." He then said that while he
normally voted Democrat for president
and supported Walter Mondale, "We
shouldn't be nailed to the wall by po
litical labels."
