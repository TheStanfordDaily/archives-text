The Story of One of the Great Intellectual Adventures of Our Age
BUILDING AND SAILING AN
ANCIENT GREEK TRIREME
LECTURE by Professor John S. Morrison
Wolf son College, Cambridge University
Written about in National Geographic and Archaeology and filmed by the BBC.
There will be plenty of slides and some stunning video tapes.
This is Professor Momson's first lecture in America.
BRANNER HALL Wed., April 19 8:00 PM
The Trireme was the most famous of the oared warships of the Ancient Mediterranean. In
1981, a group of British academics and maritime engineering enthusiasts struck on the idea of
reconstructing a full-scale replica of the trireme. Through many trials and building of part
models.. the trireme finally emerged in 1987 as an actual vessel to be rowed in Greek waters.
This lecture is the story of this great adventure of people bringing back the past in a true sense.
People from the Bay Area rowed the ship last summer.
