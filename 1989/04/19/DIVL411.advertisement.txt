PROPOSED INTERPRETATIONS OF THE FUNDAMENTAL STANDARD
The Student Conduct Legislative Council (SCLC) authors and amends both academic and non-academic codes of conduct that relate to students. The
1988-89 SCLC is initiating the legislative process, as prescribed by the Legislative and Judicial Charter of 1968, by releasing to the University community
the proposed new text that appears below.
Your comments, which are warmly encouraged, should be directed in writing to Professor George Parker, School of Business. The deadline for responding
is May 10, 1989.
SCLC members are:
FACULTY George Parker (Chair), Tom Kane, Mark Mancall, John Perry, Alan Schwettman, Edward Solomon
STUDENTS Sam Kim, Eric Li, Janie Yen
EX-OFFICIO Canetta Ivy, David Porter, Sally Cole
The Fundamental Standard reads:
Students at Stanford are expected to show both within and without the University such respect for order,
morality, personal honor and the rights of others as is demanded of good citizens. Failure to do this will be
sufficient cause for removal from the University.
The SCLC proposes to leave this statement unchanged and to follow it with this text:
FUNDAMENTAL STANDARD INTERPRETATION: FREE EXPRESSION AND DISCRIMINATORY HARASSMENT
1. Stanford is committed to the principles of free inquiry and free expression. Students have the right to hold and vigorously defend and promote their
opinions, thus entering them into the life of the University, there to flourish or wither according to their merits. Respect for this right requires that
students tolerate opinions with which they may disagree, and which they may even find abhorrent. Intimidation of students by other students in their
exercise of this right, by violence or threat of violence, is therefore considered to be a violation of the Fundamental Standard.
2. Stanford is also committeed to principles of equal opportunity and non-discrimination. Each student has the right to equal access to a Stanford
education, without discrimination on the basis of sex, race, color, handicap, religion, sexual orientation, or national and ethic origin. Harassment of
students on the basis of any of these characteristics creates a differentially hostile educational environment for them, and infringes their right of equal
access to a Stanford education. Such discriminatory harassment is therefore considered to be a violation of the Fundamental Standard.
3. This interpretation of the Fundamental Standard is intended to clarify the point at which protected free expression ends and prohibited discriminatroy
harassment begins. Prohibited harassment includes discriminatroy intimidation by threats of violence and also includes vilification of students on the
basis of their sex, race, color, handicap, religion, sexual orientation, or national and ethnic origin.
4. Speech or other expression constitutes harassment by vilification if it:
a) is intended to insult or stigmatize an individual or a small number of individuals on the basis of their sex, race, color, handicap, religion, sexual
orientation, or national and ethnic origin; and
b) is addressed directly to the individual or individuals whom it insults or stigmatizes; and
c) amounts to "fighting words" or their functional equivalent; that is, in addition to its insulting or stigmatizing content, is expresses in words,
pictures or symbols that, by virtue of their form, are commonly understood to convey, in a direct and visceral way, hatred or contempt for human
beings of the sex, race, color, handicap, religion, sexual orientation, or national and ethnic origin in question.
Introduction.
The Fundamental Standard requires that students act with
"such respect for . . . the rights of others as in demanded of good
citizens." Some recent incidents have revealed doubt and
disagreement about what this requirement means for students
in the sensitive area where the right of free expression may
conflict with the right to be free of invidious discrimination. The
Interpretation on Free Expression and Discriminatory
Harassment is proposed by the Student Conduct Legislative
Council in order to provide students and administrators with
some guidance in this area.
The University has affirmed the principle of free expression in
its Policy on Campus Disruption, committing itself to support
"the rights of all members of the University community to
express their views or to protest against actions and opinions
with which they disagree." The University has likewise affirmed
the principle of non-discrimination, pledging itself in the
Statement of Nondiscriminatory Policy not to "discriminate
against students on the basis of sex, race, color, handicap,
religion, sexual orientation, or national and ethnic origin in the
adminstration of its educational policies."
In accommodating these two principles, the SCLC has benefited
greatly from the discussion and debate stimulated by its earlier
proposal on this question. In aid of further discussion, these
Comments are meant to answer some questions that have been
raised in connection with the Interpretation, and to supply some
additional contextual remarks that may be useful in its
application.
1. Why prohibit "discriminatory harassment," rather than just
plain harassment?"
Some harassing conduct would no doubt violate the
Fundamental Standard whether or not it was based on one of the
recognized categories of invidious discrimination â€” for example,
if a student, motivated by jealousy or personal dislike, harassed
another with repeated middle-of-the-night phone calls. Some
have raised the question why, given that, it is necessary to
define discriminatory harassment as a separate violation of the
Fundamental Standard.
The answer is suggested by reflection on the reason why the
particular kind of discrimination mentioned in the University's
policy statement are singled out for special prohibition.
Obviously, and without necessity for statement, it is Unversity
policy not to discriminate against any student in the
administration of its educational policies on any arbitrary or
unjust basis. The enumeration of particular prohibited forms of
discrimination rests on the recognition that, in this society at
this time, certain human characteristics are the target of
socially pervasive invidious discrimination. Persons with these
characteristics may sustain the special injury of culmulative
discrimination: they are subjected to repetitive stigma, insult,
and indignity on the basis of a fundamental personal trait. It is
the cumulative and socially pervasive discrimination that
distinguishes the intolerable injury of wounded identity caused
by discriminatory harassment from the tolerable, and relatively
randomly distributed, hurt or bruised feelings that result from
ordinary personally motivated name-calling, a form of hurt that
we do not believe the Fundamental Standard protects against.
2. Does "harassment" by definition require repeated acts?
No. Just as a single sexually coercive proposal can constitute
prohibited sexual harassment, so can a single instance of
vilification constitute prohibited discriminatory harassment. The
reason for this is, again, the socially pervasive character of
discrimination against persons with certain characteristics.
Students with these characteristics have to right to pursue their
Stanford education in an environment that is not more hostile to
them than to others. But the injury of discriminatory denial of
educational access through maintenance of a hostile
environment can be created by single acts of discrimination on
the part of many different individuals. To deal with abuse that is
COMMENTS
repetitive to its victims, and hence constitutes the continuing
injury of harassment to them, it is necessary to prohibit the kind
of individual actions that, when added up, amount to
institutional discrimination.
3. Why is intent to insult or stigmatize required?
Students who are subject to pervasive discrimination may be
injured by unintended insulting or stigmatizing remarks as well
as by those made with the requisite intent. In addition, the
intent requirement makes enforcement of the prohibition of
discriminatory harassment more difficult, particularly since
proof beyond a reasonable doubt is required to establish charges
of Fundamental Standard violations.
Nevertheless, we believe that the disciplinary process should
only be invoked against intentionally insulting or stigmatizing
utterances. For example, a student who heard members of
minority groups using the standard insulting terms for their
own group in a joking way among themselves might falsely
suppose himself or herself free to use those terms in the same
way without giving offense. This kind of insensitivity should be
dealt with by education, not be the disciplinary process.
Further, the threat of prosecution for thoughtless or insensitive
remarks creates the danger of chilling campus discussion of
race, gender, and other sensitive issues. Confining the
disciplinary offense of harassment to intended direct insults,
backed by the requirement of proof beyond a reasonable doubt of
intent, will in our view prevent any serious chilling effect of this
kind.
4. Why is only vilification of "a small number of individuals"
prohibited, and how many are too many?
The principle of free expression creates a stong presumption
against prohibition of speech based upon its content. Narrow
exceptions to this presumption are traditionally recognized,
among other categories, for speech that is defamatory or
assaultive, and (a closely related category) for speech that
constitutes so-called "fighting words." The Interpretation defines
as prohibited vilification only expression that comes within this
last concept, which covers a narrow category of intentionally
insulting or stigmatizing statements about individuals (4a),
directed to those individuals (4b), and expressed in viscerally
offensive form (4c).
The expression "fighting words" can by itself be misleading; this
is why we have added the phrase "or their functional
equivalent." First, by use of the expression we do not mean to
imply that violence is an acceptable response even to
discriminatory vilification. Second, we intend no implication
that a threat of prediction of violent response can by itself turn
protected speech into unprotected "fighting words;" any such
principle would establish in effect a thugs' veto over free
expression. Nor, finally, do we believe that an actual threat or
likelihood of violent response is a necessary element for
application of the "fighting words" concept; statements that are
wounding and vicious enough to constitute "fighting words" do
not become protected speech simply because their immediate
victims are, for example, such disciplined practitioners of
non-violence, or so physically helpless, or so cowed and
demoralized, that they do not pose a realistic physical threat.
As we understand the "fighting words" concept, it does exclude
"group defamation" â€” insulting statements, however offensive
or vile their form of expression, that concern the whole group of
those who possess the characteristic that is the basis for the
insult. We have use the expression "small number" of individuals
in 4(a) (rather than "group" or "determinate group") to make
explicit this exclusion of the concept of "group defamtion" from
the definition of vilification.
The clearest case for application of the prohibition of vilification
is the "face to face" insult of a single individual. Of course, it is
evident that more than one person can be insulted face to face,
and further that a direct vilifying insult delivered by telephone
is not essentially difference from one spoken literally face to
face. The exact contours of the concept of insult to "a small
number of individuals" cannot be defined with mechanical
precision. One guideline for application is that the requirements
of 4(a) and 4(b) go together, so that a "small number" of persons
must be no more than can be and are "addressed directly" by the
person conveying the vilifying message.
We believe, for example, that a poster placed in the common area
of a student residence might be found to be addressed to all the
students living in that residence who possessed the
characteristic vilified. Any such finding would, however, depend
upon an individualized determination of the knowledge and
intent of the person or persons placing the poster.
5. What is the point of the terms "by virtue of their form" and
"commonly understood" in the definition of "fighting words
or their functional equivalent?"
These terms in Section 4(c) are meant to limit vilification to
targeted expression using epithets or pictorial representations
that are, as a matter of social consensus, recognized as gut-level
insults to those with the characteristic in question. The
restrictive term "by virtue of their form" is meant to exclude
charges of vilification being brought on the basis that certain
social and political views are in and of themselves, simply by
virtue of their content offensive and insulting to members of
groups that they concern. Thus under this Interpretation, the
expression of racist, sexist, homophobic, and blasphemous views
as such, even with the intent to insult, and targeted to those
known to be vulnerable to that kind of insult, does not by itself
violate the Fundamental Standard.
What is required in addition is that the form of expression used
must include the standard abusive epithets, or their pictorial or
other equivalents. The expression "commonly understood" is
added not to enlarge but to narrow the discretion of
enforcement and judicial authorities; it is a further restriction,
designed to ensure that forms of expression thought to be
insulting or offensive by a social group or certain members of a
group do not qualify as vilification unless those forms of
expression are generally so understood across society as a
whole.
6. Does not the narrow definition of vilification imply approval
of all "protected expression" that falls outside the definition?
Not every form of speech or conduct that is "protected" in the
sense of being immune from disciplinary sanction is thereby
approved or endorsed by the Stanford community. For example,
while interference with free expression by violence or threat of
violence violates the Fundamental Standard, less overt forms of
silencing of diverse expression, such as too hasty charges of
racism, sexism, and the like, generally do not. Yet the latter
form of silencing is hurtful in individuals and bad for education;
as such, it is to be discouraged, though by means other than the
disciplinary process.
Similarly, while directly targeted vilification violates the
Fundamental Standard, even extreme expression of racial hatred
and contempt does not, so long as it is not addressed to
individuals. Yet the latter form of speech causes real harm and it
can and should be sharply denounced throughout the University
community. Less extreme expressions of bigotry (including
off-hand remarks that embody harmful stereotypes) are also
hurtful to individuals, and bad for education They too should be
discouraged, though again by means other than the disciplinary
process.
In general, the Fundamental Standard is not meant to be a
comprehensive account of good citizenship within the Stanford
community. It is meant only to set a floor of minimum
requirements of respect for the rights of others, requirements
that can be reasonably and fairly enforced through a disciplinary
process. The Stanford community should expect much more of
itself by way of tolerance, diversity, free inquiry and the pursuit
of equal educational opportunity than can possibly be
guaranteed by any set of disciplinary rules.
