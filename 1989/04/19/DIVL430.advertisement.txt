Two views of the Fundamental Standard
i
Originally proposed interpretation
• PERSONAL ABUSE. Students cannot use obscenities, epithets,
and other forms of expression that by accepted community stand
ards degrade, victimize, stigmatize, or pejoratively characterize
another individual on the basis of personal, cultural or intellectual
diversity.
• DEFAMATION OF GROUPS. Students cannot inescapably and
involuntarily expose others to obscenities, epithets, and other
forms of expression that by accepted community standards stig
matize, victimize or pejoratively characterize persons or groups
on the basis of personal or cultural differences.
Newly proposed interpretation
• Intimidating students by "violence or threat of violence" when
they are exercising their right to hold and promote opinions is a
violation.
• Speech or other expression constitutes "harassment by vilifica
tion" if it meets three conditions:
— is intended to insult or stigmatize an individual or a small
number of individuals on the basis of sex, race, color, handicap,
religion, sexual orientation, or national and ethnic origin;
— is addressed directly to the individual(s) involved; — amounts
to "fighting words" or their functional equivalent; that the form of
expression is commonly understood to directly convey hatred or
contempt for human beings on the bases listed above.
• Defamation of groups is not explicitly prohibited.
• An extensive "comments" section answers anticipated questions.
