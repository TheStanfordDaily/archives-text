# Stanford team reproduces 'cold fusion' experiment
## 
### Jock Friedly Editorial staff 
A Stanford research team
helped build the case for "cold
fusion" yesterday when it an
nounced a significant confirma
tion of recent claims that energy
could be produced in a jar at room
temperature.
In a controlled experiment, a
team led by Materials Sciences
Prof. Robert Huggins lent
credibility to controversial claims
for cold fusion, first made by re
searchers in Utah last month. But
the team stopped short of a full
endorsement of the Utah interpre
tation, which if true, means that
the energy that drives stars might
be accessible on a countertop.
Although skeptical of the Utah
findings, scientists worldwide
hope they can use cold fusion as
an inexhaustible source of energy
that does not add to pollution or
the greenhouse effect. What the
Utah researchers lacked was a
control experiment, scientists said,
and that is what Huggins and
company have in part provided.

Like other confirmation
seeking scientists, the Stanford
team found that it had crossed
the break-even point with
deuterium-laden heavy water.
They found that one and a half
times as much heat came out than
was put in.
But in what it believes to be
the first announcement of its
kind, the team found that ordi
nary water, tested next to heavy
water, did not produce the same
result. If they had found the op
posite results, the theory that fu
sion in a jar could happen would
be all but destroyed.
Deuterium is a variant of hy
drogen with an extra neutron, in
addition to the usual proton in
its nucleus. In a normal fusion
reaction, two atoms of deuterium
would combine to form helium,
releasing a neutron that carries
a great deal of energy.
However, the Stanford team did
not claim it had made fusion, say
ing that many other experiments
are needed before anyone will
know whether the heat signals a
nuclear reaction. Also, the group

was not looking for neutrons,
which could help prove that fusion
was happening. "We are not ex
perts in radiation," said Turgut
Gur, a research associate in the
laboratory.
Said Huggins yesterday, "What
ever is happening, we don't know
what it is." Unlike the Utah sci
entists, Huggins would not spec
ulate about possible implications
of his results.
Although Huggins offered no
theories, others are churning
them out right and left. None,
however, carry definitive experi
mental proof.
What has emerged out of the
fusion debate, though, is a divisive
rift between physicists and
chemists.
Physicists claim that the phe
nomenon cannot bo explained by
any nuclear reaction, that it must
be some chemical reaction the
chemists have not accounted for.
"These nuclear reactions have
nothing to do with the energy re
lease," said Physics Prof. Walter
Meyerhof, who is a nuclear

physicist. "The facts about nu
clear physics are fairly well un
derstood."
Chemists, on the other hand,
counter that no chemical reaction
can explain the heat either. They
point to the measurement of
neutrons that many groups claim
to have seen, implying a nuclear
reaction. Chemical reactions, by
definition, don't involve the
change of any of the nuclear com
ponents.
Chemistry Prof. James Collman
said he is so sure the phenomenon
is nuclear that he has risked more
than $100 in bets with other pro
fessors that it is. Though the bet
is all in good fun, in a larger sense
it illustrates that two powerful
branches of science have staked
their professional reputations on
diametrically opposed views in the
cold fusion debate.
If Collman and other chemists
are right, physicists will have to
find quite an explanation for this
process that will explain why they
can't detect more neutrons. If real
fusion — that is, fusion in the
traditional explanation — is oc
curring, the scientists should have
been killed by the billions of
neutrons that should have been
emitted.
Fusion, which fuels the violence
of the sun and hydrogen bombs,
uses the hidden energy of
deuterium atoms to power its re
action. When two hydrogen atoms
come close enough together, they
"fuse," or join. A neutron flies
off, carrying away a tremendous
amount of energy, and a form of
helium — helium-3 to be exact
— is created.
Typically though, the positively
charged cores of the hydrogen
repel each other if they come too
close. The hydrogen atoms are
kept at just enough distance so
they cannot fuse. However, the
15 million degree Celsius temper
ature of the sun can overcome
this inconvenience.
As it often does in cases such
as this, quantum mechanics
throws a funny wrinkle into the
problem. Every once in a while,

gen bombs.

two deuterium atoms that cannot
normally overcome the repulsive
electrical force, can come together
seemingly by magic.
This phenomena is known as
"quantum tunneling," and it
doesn't hit home unless consid
ered on a human scale. Quantum
mechanics dictates that by the
same tunneling effect, a car racing
toward a brick wall has a small
chance of ending up on the other
side of the wall without even hit
ting it.
In the case of everyday objects
such as cars, the quantum tun
neling effect happens so rarely
that it isn't worth imagining that
anyone will ever see this phenom
ena. On the tiny scale of atoms,
however, quantum tunneling is
much more probable. The tinier
the distances involved, the greater
the likelihood of tunneling.
Still, quantum tunneling can
not entirely explain what the re
searchers are seeing. Even at
average distances from each
other, deuterium atoms fuse so
rarely that it would take the es
timated lifetime of the universe
before one atom in a mass of
deteurium as large as the planet
earth fused with another atom in
that mass.
Yet, researchers from Brigham
Young University and the Univer -
sity of Utah say that somehow
their experiment altered the
chance of this quantum tunneling
effect. Many argue that the
deuterium must have been packed
very tightly within the palladium
rods that were used in the exper
iment.
Both research teams used a
setup that they admit is embar
rassingly easy to reproduce.
Except for the neutron
detecting apparatus, the materials

for the experiment can be found
in an undergraduate chemistry
lab. Inside a small beaker, a
platinum electrode is coiled
loosely around a palladium
electrode. Both are surrounded by
heavy water.
When the electricity is turned
on, the electric Current through
the jar breaks, apart the heavy

water into oxygen and deuterium.
The oxygen goes to the platinum
electrode; the deuterium flows to
the palladium electrode.
Scientists say they will not
know for months, and possibly
years, what is happening in those
tiny electrodes that might be the
source for an enormous amount
of clean energy.


The above experimental setup has produced results that some
researchers have said is cold fusion. The typically occurring
fusion reaction, shown below, involves the joining of two
deuterium atoms to form helium-3 and a neutron (shown in
gray).
