# Stanford team reproduces 'cold fusion' experiment

A Stanford research team
helped build the case for "cold
fusion" yesterday when it an
nounced a significant confirma
tion of recent claims that energy
could be produced in a jar at room
temperature.
In a controlled experiment, a
team led by Materials Sciences
Prof. Robert Huggins lent
credibility to controversial claims
for cold fusion, first made by re
searchers in Utah last month. But
the team stopped short of a full
endorsement of the Utah interpre
tation, which if true, means that
the energy that drives stars might
be accessible on a countertop.
Although skeptical of the Utah
findings, scientists worldwide
hope they can use cold fusion as
an inexhaustible source of energy
that does not add to pollution or
the greenhouse effect. What the
Utah researchers lacked was a
control experiment, scientists said,
and that is what Huggins and
company have in part provided.

Like other confirmation
seeking scientists, the Stanford
team found that it had crossed
the break-even point with
deuterium-laden heavy water.
They found that one and a half
times as much heat came out than
was put in.
But in what it believes to be
the first announcement of its
kind, the team found that ordi
nary water, tested next to heavy
water, did not produce the same
result. If they had found the op
posite results, the theory that fu
sion in a jar could happen would
be all but destroyed.
Deuterium is a variant of hy
drogen with an extra neutron, in
addition to the usual proton in
its nucleus. In a normal fusion
reaction, two atoms of deuterium
would combine to form helium,
releasing a neutron that carries
a great deal of energy.
However, the Stanford team did
not claim it had made fusion, say
ing that many other experiments
are needed before anyone will
know whether the heat signals a
nuclear reaction. Also, the group

was not looking for neutrons,
which could help prove that fusion
was happening. "We are not ex
perts in radiation," said Turgut
Gur, a research associate in the
laboratory.
Said Huggins yesterday, "What
ever is happening, we don't know
what it is." Unlike the Utah sci
entists, Huggins would not spec
ulate about possible implications
of his results.
Although Huggins offered no
theories, others are churning
them out right and left. None,
however, carry definitive experi
mental proof.
What has emerged out of the
fusion debate, though, is a divisive
rift between physicists and
chemists.
Physicists claim that the phe
nomenon cannot bo explained by
any nuclear reaction, that it must
be some chemical reaction the
chemists have not accounted for.
"These nuclear reactions have
nothing to do with the energy re
lease," said Physics Prof. Walter
Meyerhof, who is a nuclear
