# Students march for democracy in China
## 
### 
BEIJING (AP) — Thousands of
students demanding greater de
mocracy marched around Tianan
men Square last night in one of
the biggest displays of student dis
content seen in the capital.
Some of the 3,000 students had
staged a daylong sit-in in front of
the Great Hall of the People, the
seat of government located next
to the square, demanding freedom
of press and speech and that gov
ernment leaders disclose their in
comes.
"Long live democracy!" they
chanted. "Down with dictatorship!
Down with corruption!"
A disorderly mass of thousands
of workers, peasants and young
people followed the students. They
did not participate directly in the
demonstrations.
The crowd swelled to perhaps
as big as 10,000 as dissenters
headed west down Changan Boul
evard, Beijing's main thorough
fare. Thousands remained in the
square after the flag-waving,
chanting students left.
Many expressed support for the
goals of the students, although
some said the rally would achieve
nothing. Others said economic is
sues were more important.
"You can't eat democracy," said
a worker who complained about
inflation, running at a record 30
percent and more in some Chinese
cities.
A high school student said few
of his classmates joined the

protest because they do not want
to jeopardize their chances of get
ting into a university. A teacher
said his colleagues worried they
might lose their jobs or wages.
Students from at least seven
Beijing universities demonstrated
during the day in Tiananmen
Square to mourn the death of
reformist former Communist
Party chief Hu Yaobang.
Hu, who died of a heart attack
Saturday at age 73, was popular
among students because he cham
pioned the rights of intellectuals.
Party conservatives forced him to
resign in 1987 after accusing him
of failing to take harsh measures
against pro-democracy student
demonstrations that winter.
Student calls for the govern
ment to reassess Hu's historical
role quickly turned into demands
for political reform.
Last night's rally began when
students returned a 15-foot ban
ner honoring Hu to a monument
for revolutionary heroes in the
center of the square, China's sym
bolic center of power.
About 2,000 students had
placed the banner on the monu
ment before dawn yesterday after
a four-hour march from their
campuses.
"China's spirit, always remem
ber Comrade Yaobang," said the
banner.
After returning it, the students
marched around the 100-acre
square and onto the boulevard.
