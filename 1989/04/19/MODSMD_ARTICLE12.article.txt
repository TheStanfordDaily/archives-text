# Prosecution ends case in North trial
## Attorney describes North as a habitual liar 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Oliver
North was portrayed to his trial
jury yesterday as a liar who
couldn't stop, and as "the Joe
Isuzu of government" who fol
lowed Hitler's maxim that "the
victor will never be asked if he
told the truth."
Said prosecutor John Keker, in
final arguments at North's trial:
"If Ollie North wanted to get it
done, he didn't care if he broke
the law."
North, the former National Se
curity Council aide who was at
the center of the Iran-Contra vor
tex, sat stone-faced at the defense
table as prosecutor Keker meth
odically tried to dismantle his
American-hero image.
"Telling the truth is something
you learned at your mother's
knee," Keker said. "Government
by deception is not a free govern
ment. Government by deception
is not a democratic government.
Government by deception is not
a government under the rule of
law."
After North's lawyer makes his
closing argument, there will be
time for rebuttal on today and
then the trial — now in its ninth
week — will go to the jury.
Prosecutor told the
jurors yesterday,"I will be asking
you to return a verdict of guilty
as to each of these 12 counts
against Oliver North."
He said, "The tragedy of Oliver
North is of a man who cared so
much for freedom in Nicaragua,

but forgot about the demands of
freedom and democracy here at
home."
The charges include six counts
of lying to Congress and withhold
ing information; obstructing a
presidential inquiry and making
false statements to investigators;
altering, shredding and concealing
documents; receiving an illegal
gratuity, a security system at his
home; stealing money from a Iran-
Contra account; and conspiring to
defraud the Internal Revenue
Service.
The charges focus on an alleged
attempt to cover up various
aspects of a secret Reagan admin
istration operation to aid the
Nicaraguan rebels.
Standing behind a portable lec
tern and using a huge chart that
outlined the charges, Keker con
tended that North, a highly
decorated former Marine officer
and White House aide, had a de
fense of "the devil made me do
it."
North "blames other people.
'McFarlane made me to it. Casey
told me to do it,'" the prosecutor
said. Robert McFarlane was the
national security adviser at the
time of some of the alleged offen
ses and William Casey was CIA
director.
He said when North was ques
tioned in November 1986 by the
attorney general and aides about
the diversion of Iranian arms
sales profits to the Contras, "they
thought he was telling the truth."
