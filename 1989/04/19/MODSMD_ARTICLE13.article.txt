HP] I RUT, Lebanon (AP) â€” Thousands of
civilians fled west Beirut yesterday as Chris
tian and Syrian gunners held their fire briefly
to allow the evacuation of 70 severely wounded
Moslems to a French hospital ship.
Hundreds of cars 1 packed with suitcases,
mattresses and blankets sped down a seaside
highway to south and east Lebanon as the
wounded were assembled outside the home of
acting Prime Minister Salim Hoss.
Eight people were killed and 43 wounded
overnight as the city's divided population

huddled in bunkers and bomb shelters for a
third night. That raised the toll to 270 killed
and 975 wounded since fighting erupted
March 8.
Pillars of flame from burning buildings
lighted the sky and the city was laden with
smoke as Christian army units and Syrian
and Moslem gunners bombarded the capital
with rocket, artillery and tank fire.
France's President Francois Mitterrand yes
terday asked President Bush, Soviet President
Mikhail Gorbachev and other world leaders

to help end the fighting in this former French
colony, said Mitterrand spokesman Hubert
Vedrine.
Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported
a telephone conversation between Mitterrand
and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak "crys
tallized the idea of making joint efforts at the
international level to halt the bloodshed."
The Arab League Council called an emer
gency meeting for Friday on Lebanon, al
though it has failed to rein the fighting with
three failed cease-fires.
