## Time to act for freedom in S. Africa 
### 
IN THE ASSU ELECTION, two
referenda concern Stanford's policy
regarding South Africa. One asks
whether Stanford University should
divest, or sell its stocks in companies
which do business with South Africa.
The second proposes educational initia
tives on South Africa.
Students for a Free South Africa
would like to inform the Stanford
community about the issues to help
students make a better decision.
We believe that Stanford has failed
to live up to its responsibility in both
of those areas: The University's finan
cial investments help to bolster the
apartheid regime, and Stanford cur
rently falls short of its moral responsi
bility by failing to cultivate sufficient
educational initiatives for the Stanford
community and for South Africans
themselves.
We realize that Stanford must care
fully secure its economic future, and
that the University has made some
efforts to balance this security with its
moral obligations through a policy of
selective divestment, but this policy is
insufficient, even counterproductive.
By being selective, it assumes that
some businesses in which we invest
"do good." All investments in compan
ies doing business in South Africa
directly and indirectly assist the white
regime through equipment and taxes,
which further add to the viability of
the white regime, the damage of which
outweighs any benefits to the black
workers.

Only total divestment sends a clear
and powerful message to South African
whites that we both reject apartheid as
immoral and have lost faith in its
continuing stability.
After all, Stanford is not only a
financial entity, but also a leading
educational institution — a home of
moral and intellectual integrity — and
thus possesses a unique opportunity
for leadership in opposing apartheid.
Stanford's divestment would send a
message both to other stockholders and
to the companies operating in South
Africa that they must reexamine their
own roles and themselves take an
active stance against apartheid.
The University must assume active
leadership by taking the following
steps:
1. Stanford must totally divest from
corporations doing business in South
Africa.
2. Stanford should recruit more
black students from South Africa. Our
recruitment process must be
redesigned: The best young black
South African students are often the
most politically active students, and
thus may be denied the best grades, or
they may choose to escape the country.
Stanford should follow the University
of California's example and seek out
these students.
3. Stanford should contribute to the
improvement of alternative South
African education programs both
within South Africa and in neighboring
refugee camps.
4. Stanford should establish a profes

sorship of South African history. In
the last two years, two exceptional
scholars specializing in Southern Africa
(Joel Sannoff and William Worger)
have been refused the opportunity to
renew their contracts, leaving an inex
cusable dearth of possibilities in that
area. We can pay people to teach
windsurfing and ultimate frisbee, but
it seems that we cannot pay people to
teach South African history and
politics.
5. Stanford should establish an
overseas campus in Africa. We have
campuses on every other continent.
Africa should not be excluded.
We are embarrassed by our universi
ty's apparent lack of concern regarding
our relationship with South Africa.
While the details of each of these
initiatives will necessarily be worked
out by University committees, they will
only be worked out if we, the students,
show our support for these activities.
We must demonstrate before our
own community, before this nation and
before the international community,
that Stanford does not approve of
apartheid and wants to see a construc
tive change.
