# New SCLC proposal tilts toward primacy of free speech

Backing away from the broad definition
of prohibited offensive expression pro
posed last quarter, the Student Conduct
Legislative Council today offered a new
view of the Fundamental Standard that
adheres more closely to current judicial
interpretation of the First Amendment.
Clearly influenced by the community's
nearly unanimous rejection of its pro
posal last month, the council spent nearly

three weeks drafting the new statement,
which protects significantly more forms
of expression and limits prohibited ex
pression to "discriminatory harassment
by vilification," or more plainly, "fighting
words."
Attempting to define where protection
of expression ends and prohibition begins,
the council formulated three criteria.
To be a Fundamental Standard viola
tion, the expression must:
• Be "intended to insult or stigmatize
an individual or small number of indi

viduals" on the basis of sex, race, color,
handicap, religion, sexual orientation, or
national and ethnic origin;
• Be addressed directly to the individ
uals) whom it insults; and
• Amount to " 'fighting words' or their
functional equivalent."
The council's statement also explicitly
declares "discriminatory intimidation bv
violence or threats of violence" a Standard
violation.
The proposal — written by Law Prof.
Thomas Grev, a consultant to the council

since late March — enters a 21-day com
ment period during which the University
community may review it and respond.
Barring overwhelmingly negative reac
tion, the proposed interpretations could
wind through the lengthy enactment proc
ess and become University policy by June.
Council members contacted by The
Daily would not comment on the second
proposal before the community has had
a chance to respond.
In March the council proposed that
students cannot be exposed to personal

attacks which involve the use of
obscenities, epithets and other forms of
expression that by "accepted community
standards" degrade, victimize, stigmatize,
or pejoratively characterize them on the
basis of "personal, cultural or intellectual
diversity."
The council also issued a similar state
ment prohibiting defamation of groups
based on "personal or cultural differ
ences."
