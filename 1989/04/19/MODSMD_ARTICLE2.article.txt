# New SCLC proposal tilts toward primacy of free speech
## 
### Goodwin Liu Senior staff writer 
Backing away from the broad definition
of prohibited offensive expression pro
posed last quarter, the Student Conduct
Legislative Council today offered a new
view of the Fundamental Standard that
adheres more closely to current judicial
interpretation of the First Amendment.
Clearly influenced by the community's
nearly unanimous rejection of its pro
posal last month, the council spent nearly

three weeks drafting the new statement,
which protects significantly more forms
of expression and limits prohibited ex
pression to "discriminatory harassment
by vilification," or more plainly, "fighting
words."
Attempting to define where protection
of expression ends and prohibition begins,
the council formulated three criteria.
To be a Fundamental Standard viola
tion, the expression must:
• Be "intended to insult or stigmatize
an individual or small number of indi

viduals" on the basis of sex, race, color,
handicap, religion, sexual orientation, or
national and ethnic origin;
• Be addressed directly to the individ
uals) whom it insults; and
• Amount to " 'fighting words' or their
functional equivalent."
The council's statement also explicitly
declares "discriminatory intimidation bv
violence or threats of violence" a Standard
violation.
The proposal — written by Law Prof.
Thomas Grev, a consultant to the council

since late March — enters a 21-day com
ment period during which the University
community may review it and respond.
Barring overwhelmingly negative reac
tion, the proposed interpretations could
wind through the lengthy enactment proc
ess and become University policy by June.
Council members contacted by The
Daily would not comment on the second
proposal before the community has had
a chance to respond.
In March the council proposed that
students cannot be exposed to personal

attacks which involve the use of
obscenities, epithets and other forms of
expression that by "accepted community
standards" degrade, victimize, stigmatize,
or pejoratively characterize them on the
basis of "personal, cultural or intellectual
diversity."
The council also issued a similar state
ment prohibiting defamation of groups
based on "personal or cultural differ
ences."
These two aspects of the pro
posal were widely attacked as
being vague and not in line with
accepted First Amendment prin
ciples.
The council's new one-page in
terpretation, which is followed by
four pages of clarifying comments,
offers no prohibition of group
defamation and more clearly
describes the types of personal at
tacks that violate the Fundamen
tal Standard.
The entire text of the council's
proposal is found in a paid adver
tisement on page 8 of today's Dai
ly-
The council devoted most of its
comments to explaining the three
stringent requirements that pro
hibited expression must meet.
Prohibited expression — or
"fighting words" — falls into "a
narrow category of intentionally
insulting or stigmatizing state
ments about individuals, directed
to those individuals and expressed
in viscerally offensive form," ac

cording to the proposal.
The council included "proof be
yond reasonable doubt of intent"
as one requirement of "fighting
words" because thoughtless or in
sensitive remarks "should be dealt
with by education, not by the dis
ciplinary process." The council
also recognized the dangers of
threatening prosecution for such
remarks, as it may "create the
danger of chilling campus discus
sion of race, gender and other
sensitive issues."
The council emphasized the im
portance of form of expression,
noting that discriminatory ex
pression, even intented to insult
and targeted to those known to
be vulnerable to that kind of in
sult, does not "by itself violate
the Fundamental Standard.
The proposal only prohibits in
tentional insults expressed "in
words, pictures or symbols that,
by virtue of their form, are com
monly understood to convey, in a
direct and visceral way, hatred or
contempt for human beings of the
sex, race, color, handicap, religion,
sexual orientation, or national and
ethnic origin in question."
The expression " 'commonly

cially pervasive dis
crimination (causes)

understood' is added not to en
large but to narrow the discretion
of enforcement and judicial au
thorities," the council wrote.
Many respondents to the previous
interpretation argued with the use
of the phrase "accepted commu
nity standards."
While "fighting words" must be
addressed directly to an individual
or a small number of individuals,
the council wrote that the "exact
contours" of a small number of
individuals "cannot be defined
with mechanical precision." The
comments add that the phrase is
intended to make explicit the ex
clusion of "group defamation"
from the definition of vilification.
The council also explained why
it has sought to prohibit "discrim

inatory harassment" rather than
"just plain harassment," which
does not violate the Fundamental
Standard.
The council emphasized that
not all expression "immune from
disciplinary sanction is thereby
approved or endorsed by the Stan
ford community" and that the
Fundamental Standard only sets
a "floor of minimum requirements
. . . that can be reasonably and
fairly enforced through a discipli
nary process."
