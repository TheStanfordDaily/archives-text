MEChA is not the
sole voice of Latinos
Although the Movimiento Estudiantil
Chicano de Aztlan has contributed to
the community, the special fee cam
paign has misrepresented the role of
MEChA within the Stanford communi
ty-
The "Vote MEChA" campaign has
failed to recognize the efforts for the
community by other organizations not
affiliated with MEChA by failing to
point out that the "MEChA Special
Fee" is solely a name, and not a
recognition of MEChA as the
Chicano/Latino voice or as the organi
zation "providing cultural and personal
support for Stanford's Hispanic com
munity."
The Chicano/Latino community is
comprised of people of differing politi
cal views, all of whom work to put
various programs together. The cam
paign recognizes no groups other than
MEChA as contributors to these pro
grams.
We wish to prevent the Stanford
community from clumping all members
of our community into a "MEChA
umbrella organization," which is what,
will happen if the special fee is ap
proved. All events included in the spe
cial fee will be MEChA-sponsored,
falsely implying MEChA's active in
volvement in each event.
The "Vote MEChA" stickers and
fliers imply that one is voting for the
organization, rather than a special fee.
The University Committee on Minority
Issues report states that only 15 per
cent of Mexican-Americans at Stanford
have participated in MEChA. Yet this
organization continues to label itself as
the Chicano voice.
Our intent is not to undermine the
presence and contribution of MEChA
as a student group but rather to in
form the Stanford community of a
differing and important viewpoint that
has not been presented in the cam-

paign. We ask you to recognize our
concerns in your decision to support
the MEChA special fee.

All Asians should
be welcome at AASA
The April 12 article covering my
COP slate, Students' Choice, finished
with a statement about the Asian-
American Student Association. There
has been some concern expressed from
the members of AASA that I have
misrepresented them, so 1 would like
to take this opportunity to expand
upon that statement.
According to the recent University
Committee on Minority Issues report,
less than 40 percent of the Asian re
spondents participate in the Black Stu
dent Union, MEChA, AASA or Stan
ford American Indian Organization,
with the majority presumably involved
with AASA. However, the AASA direc
tory lists 117 members, implying that
less than 15 percent of the Asian com
munity is in AASA.
Certainly, it can be argued that the
meetings are open to all Asians and
that the AASA leadership can really
only base their views on those who
come; however, they should ask them
selves why so few participate.
When I was involved with AASA, the
feeling I got was that views outside
those expressed by the leadership were
unwelcome, that any dissenting voices
would not be heard.
There is not one right approach
which will solve all of our problems;
only if AASA draws upon the opinions
of" a larger part of the Asian commu
nity can it truly claim to represent us.
