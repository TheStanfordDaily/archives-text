## Cold fusion might explain earth's secrets 
### Frank Chen Staff writer 
Plate tectonics, volcanic
eruptions, why Jupiter pro
duces heat — all these mys
teries may ultimately be solved
by a jar of water.
Scientists working at the
University of Utah and Brig
ham Young University last
month announced observation
of a fusion reaction in a jar at
room temperatures, far below
the millions of degrees thought
necessary to produce fusion
normally. In a preprint release
of their findings obtained by
The Daily, physicist Stephen
Jones and colleagues of Brig
ham Young University specu
lated their room-temperature
reaction may have implications
far beyond chemistry and
physics.
They predicted that cold fu
sion — which they said they
might have observed in the lab
oratory — might explain some
"mysteries" about the earth
and other planets that other
wise seemed solved. Jones, the
principal investigator on the
BYU cold fusion project, main
tains in his paper, however,
that his geological theories are
"strictly supposition" and
"controversial."
"The geological implications
are profound if [the cold fusion
theory] can be shown realistic,"
geologist Eric Christenson, also
of BYU, told The Daily.
Sample supposition: The
earth derives its heat from cold
fusion. Prevailing theory post
ulates two sources — "left
over" heat from the planet's
formation and natural radioac
tive decay of potassium, uran
ium and thorium.
If the BYU team is right in
their speculation, the earth
may be heated a third way:
cold fusion. In fusion reactions,
deuterium — an isotope of hy

drogen found naturally in the
ocean — collide and fuse to
gether, producing an isotope of
helium, called helium-3, and a
neutron, releasing much en
ergy in the process. Another
possible energy-releasing fu
sion reaction creates a heavier
hydrogen isotope called
tritium.
The energy released might
power volcanic eruptions and
even the shifting of the con
tinental plates, the BYU group
asserted. Data gathered at
various sights, including
Mauna Loa, Hawaii and Miami
reveal higher tritium con
centrations during volcanic
eruptions. Though tritium can
arise from hydrogen bomb test
ing or freak bursts of ultravio
let radiation from space, cold
fusion is another viable expla
nation, the BYU group re
ported.
The researchers even extend
speculation to other planets.
Jupiter, for example, is known
to radiate twice the energy it
receives from the sun. Cold fu
sion in Jupiter's core, thought
to be composed partially of hy
drogen, might explain this en
ergy, the group asserts.
Christenson predicted that
given five years and the right
equipment, geologists could de
termine whether cold fusion is
a plausible explanation for
earth heating.
Stanford Geophysics Prof.
Norman Sleep disagreed
strongly with the findings.
"That cold fusion can't cause
volcanism can be said with
total certainty," Sleep said. "It
is also very clear that it can't
be a heat source [for the
earth]."
If cold fusion were genuinely
responsible for earth heating,
