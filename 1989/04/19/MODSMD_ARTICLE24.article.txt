Q./s it true that in outer
• space no one can hear you
scream? I might want to be an
astronaut when I grow up.
A. The absence of people in
• space is one of the several

reasons why no one will hear
you scream, if you could scream
in space anyway.
For example if you were in
the middle of the Sahara Desert
with no one around for thou
sands of miles, nobody would
hear you scream, laugh or snore.
If you tried to scream in space,
though, you would be freeze
dried, and nobody would be able
to hear you, according to Ap
plied Physics Prof. Philip Scher
rer.
All the water in your body
would boil away because of the
low pressure of space, Scherrer
said. Your body also freezes in
space due to the extreme cold.
Certain foods, such as instant
coffee, are processed by freeze
drying.
Blood vessels or other parts
of the body may pop, but the
body will probably not explode
in space, Scherrer said.
If there were people — ones
who didn't freeze dry easily —
to hear you, they still wouldn't
hear you since there is not much
matter in the empty space be
tween stars, planets and as
teroids, according to Applied
Physics Prof. Vahe Petrosian.
Sound waves are vibrations
that travel through matter. On
earth where most people
scream, sound waves travel
through the air.

Astronauts in spaceships can
speak to each other because the
cabin is pressurized and con
tains air.
A spaceship is able to com
municate with its ground con
trol center because radio waves,
light and other forms of elec
tromagnetic energy are able to
travel through space. Unlike
sound waves, electromagnetic
waves are vibrating electric and
magnetic fields and are able to
travel through empty space.
Q. Where do waves come
• from ?
A. Surfers should appreciate
• big storms out at sea, be
cause these storms create the
waves they surf on.
According to Geology Prof.
James Ingle, friction between
air and water causes the wind
to move the surface of the sea,
creating waves.
Winds blowing over long dis
tances form long waves. Also,
winds blowing over short dis
tances form short waves, accord
ing to Geophysics Prof. Norman
Sleep.
Waves travel along the sur
face of the ocean, transmitting
the energy given to them by the
wind.
