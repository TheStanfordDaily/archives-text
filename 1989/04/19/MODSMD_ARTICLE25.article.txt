Sex, viruses and cancer. What's
the connection?
More and more, researchers are
finding a link between genital can
cer and infection with the sexually
transmitted virus known as the
human papillomavirus, or HPV,
the virus causing genital warts.

Genital warts are quickly be
coming the most common sexually
transmitted infection in the
United States. According to the
American Social Health Associa
tion, doctors diagnose about one
to two million new infections each
year, and the numbers are
growing.
Although the disease affects all
age groups, the numbers are par
ticularly alarming for adolescents.
As many as 30 percent of sexually
active teenagers may be infected
with the human papillomavirus,
the association reports.
In the last decade, the number
of diagnosed genital warts cases
have increased 500 percent. Ac

cording to the National Sexually
Transmitted Disease Hotline in
Palo Alto, the numbers of calls
regarding genital warts have in
creased dramatically over the past
two years, practically eclipsing
other diseases.
The source of concern
with this new sexually transmit
ted epidemic is the link between
genital warts and cancer. Re
searchers say there may be an
extra risk of cancer of the vulva,
penis or anus among people who
have had warts in these places.
But, the strongest association
appears to be with women infected
on the cervix. Women infected
with certain strains of the human
papillomavirus on the cervix may
be at increased risk for developing
cervical cancer. Cervical cancer is
estimated to cause a total of 7,000
deaths a year.
Women who have regular
gynecological exams with Pap
smears can detect the possibility
of cancer of the cervix early and
can have it treated accordingly.
For sexually active women, Pap
smears are recommended at least
once a year. Women with a history
of any sexually transmitted infec
tion or an abnormal Pap smear
should have a Pap smear exam
every three to six months.
Of the 27 different strains of

the human papillomavirus, only
four cause warts on the genitals.
The human papillomavirus can
be transmitted through direct
skin-to-skin contact with genital
warts. Warts on other parts of
the body are not thought to be
transmitted to the genital area.
The symptoms of genital warts
are skin-colored warts or other
abnormal skin growths and may
appear singly or in groups on skin
of the genital area.
Genital warts can be treated
and removed by several different
treatments. Depending on the size
and location of the warts, chemi
cal treatments, laser therapy,
freezing or burning the warts are
possible treatments to remove
them.
Warts often recur, but with per
sistent treatment they can be
removed permanently.
Because the symptoms of geni
tal warts may not be visible,
sexually active people should use
latex condoms lubricated with
nonoxynol-9, which has been
shown to kill the virus.
