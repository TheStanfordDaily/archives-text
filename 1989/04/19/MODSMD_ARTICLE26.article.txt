The Stanford baseball team

eon St. Mary's yesterday, outscor

through the sixth inning, and
eventually winning the contest 13-
5.

Baseball
Cardinal 13, Gaels 5

Two-run home runs by Troy
Paulsen and Roger Burnett in the
third inning helped break open
the then-scoreless game for the
Cardinal, whose record now
stands at 20-23. The Gaels fall to
14-31.
Frank Carey started things off
in the third with a hard double
just to the fair side of first base.
Burnett then followed with his
sixth home run of the year to left
field. Paul Carey gave Gaels'
pitcher Greg Lakos a scare by hit
ting a Hoover Tower-high fly ball
to right field that was caught on
the warning track.
Tim Griffin followed with his
first hit in 14 at bats and Paulsen
brought him home with his fourth
home run of the year. Paulsen's
hitting has improved over his last
10 games after a slump that saw
his batting average fall as low as
.230. Last year at this time, he
was batting .342 and in the midst
of a school-record 28 game hitting
streak.
In the fourth inning, the Car
dinal tacked on three more on an
RBI single by Roger Burnett and
a two-RBI double by Paul Carey
that went to the gap in right
center field. David Holbrook hit
his second home run of the year
in the fifth inning, a line shot

that just cleared the wall down
the left field line.
"They expect a certain type of
hitting out of me. I'm supposed
to put the ball in play and not
hit for too much power," said
Holbrook, who put the ball in play
a lot, reaching base four out of
five at bats on two singles, the
home run and an error.
The Cardinal's sixth inning
capped off its scoring. David
McCarty, who finished the day 4-
for-6 on four singles had an RBI
single which scored Holbrook. Eric
Cox, who came in for starter Troy
Tallman in the bottom of the
fifth, knocked a two-RBI double
over the center fielder's head, and
Burnett finished his productive
day with an RBI single that scored
Cox.
Stanford used a new lineup
today, as has been the norm this
season. This one featured Paul
Carey in center field and Paulsen
in right. Moving into the tail end
of the season, Stanford Coach
Mark Marquess says that the
lineup will depend on what type
of pitching the Cardinal sees.
"Unless I see all right-handed
pitchers, I won't stay with the
same lineup," Marquess said.
The Cardinal utilized a
veritable melange of pitchers yes
terday. Mark Carper (2-1), who
pitched very well against San
Francisco last week, started and
threw three scoreless innings for
the win.
Freshman lefty Steve Worrell,
who was victimized for two runs
in V3 of an inning at USC last
weekend, held the Gaels hitless
in the fourth and the fifth before
allowing a lone single in the sixth
inning. Scott Weiss took the
mound in the seventh and got two
strikeouts, but hung two cur
veballs that went out of the park

for three St. Mary's runs in the
eighth.
Aaron Dorlarque was the fourth
and final pitcher for Stanford. He
gave up two runs on three hits
before retiring the side in the

ninth.
"I don't think we pitched as
well in the last two innings, but
I wouldn't say that the guys eased
up because they're all trying to
impress and get a spot in the rota
tion," Marquess said.
