# Burnett set at shortstop
## 
### Robert Portnoy Senior staff writer 
When the 1989 baseball season
began, freshman Roger Burnett
was just hoping to see some action
as Stanford's designated hitter.
With nine games left on the
Cardinal's conference schedule,
"Rocket" is firmly entrenched at
shortstop, previously the private
domain of junior Troy Paulsen.
In his endless search for con
sistent offensive production, Stan
ford Coach Mark Marquess has
decided the bats of both Paulsen
and Burnett must be in the lineup
every day. With Tim Griffin hold
ing down the DH spot, Marquess
was left with one other option.
"I have more confidence putting
Troy in the outfield (than Bur
nett) because of the experience
factor. There's not a lot of differ
ence between them defensively (at
shortstop)," Marquess said.
Today against St. Mary's at
Sunken Diamond, Burnett made
his 10th consecutive start at short.
During that time, Paulsen has
quickly acquainted himself with
the outfield.
The switch is already paying
dividends for Burnett. In his last
13 games, Burnett has five
homers, 14 RBI and has raised
his average to .284.
Yesterday, he pounded out four
hits, including a line shot that
cleared the left field fence for a
two-run homer. His six four
baggers are second on the team.
He also drove in runs with a pair
of RBI singles to bring his total
to 23 on the year.
"You don't expect that much
from a freshman. He's shown a
lot of power, especially here (at
Sunken Diamond). All of his home
runs have come at home," Mar
quess said.
In the field, all has not been a
bed of roses for Burnett — his
13th-inning boot at ASU two
weekends ago allowed the winning
run to score — but Marquess is
confident he has all the tools of
a quality shortstop.
"He's got real good range and
real good quickness. He's proba
bly got the strongest arm on the
team. Another thing is he can
throw accurately from a lot of
different angles," Marquess said.
In this topsy-turvy Stanford
season, one thing is now certain:
as long as Burnett stays hot at
the plate, you'll be able to find
him at his new address — short
stop — during the Cardinal's
stretch drive.
