# Is women's tennis as good as the '84 team? Only May will tell
## 
### 
On May 15, 1984, the Stanford
women's tennis team scored a 6-0
shutout over USC to capture the
national championship. The win capped
off a perfect 26-0 season for the Cardinal
and earned the team a special place in
collegiate tennis history.
Collectively, Stanford's six 1984 All-
Americans — Elise Burgin, Linda Gates,
Leigh Anne Eldredge, Patty Fendick,
Kate Gompert and Michelle Weiss — are
widely regarded as the best team ever
assembled.
The current edition of the Cardinal,
though, boasting five 1988 Ail-Americans
and two of the top freshmen in the coun
try, is 22-0 and may be only a few steps
away from knocking the '84 squad from
the top spot of all time.
Then again, they might not.
While the groundwork is in place, the
'89 team has a lot to accomplish before
knocking the '84 superstars off their lofty
perch.
"We've got to get through the NCAAs
and win it before we do any bragging,"
Coach Frank Brennan savs.

Obviously, a national title this season
— which would be an unprecedented
fourth in a row — is necessary for this
team if they hope to compare themselves
to their predecessors.
Let's assume, for argument's sake that
the Cardinal wins the NCAA title next
month in Gainesville, Fla. A statistical
analysis of the two teams' dual-meet
records would serve as a good starting
point for comparison.
The '84 team scored eight shutouts on
the year, including the remarkable NCAA
finale, and only twice had matches as
close as 5-4. This year's squad already

has 12 shutouts and two 5-4 wins.
That comparison favors the '89 team
but is somewhat unfair considering that
the '84 team always played all three dou
bles matches (except in the NCAA final).
Of the 12 shutouts in 1989, only six of
them were 9-0 (two more came very close
at 8-0).
If this year's team pounds its way
through NCAAs like the Cardinal of five
years ago (8-1, 8-1, 7-2, 6-0 in the four
rounds), then they would merit a slight
edge statistically even accounting for the
advantage of playing more matches.
Player for player, things are more in
teresting. Fendick played No. 1 as a fresh
man and is currently ranked around No.
20 in the world. "And she hasn't stopped
yet," Brennan points out. Fendick and
Canadian Jill Hetherington combine to
form one of the top doubles teams in the
world.
Gompert reached 18th in the rankings
before illness knocked her down. Gates
had a bright pro future before a shoulder
injury stopped her upward charge at
around No. 60.

The current edition of the
Cardinal may be only a few
steps away from the top
spot of all time.

Burgin would've topped the Stanford
lineup in '84 were it not for early season
injuries. Like Eleni Rossides last year,
Burgin missed most of the year only to
return for NCAAs, move in at No. 5 and
overmatch her opponents. Rossides may
duplicate that feat this season as well.
"This year's team hasn't done anything
as far as stars (yet)," Brennan notes.
He admits that they might in the fu
ture, however. "Tami (Whitlinger) is so
tough mentally. She's going to do some
damage . . . (and) is going to have a really
good career."
Brennan senses that Sandra Birch,
Stanford's No. 2 singles player, "is going
to show her true colors in the next year
or two. She's going to get better and

better." He believes Birch's all-around
game could take her far.
Freshman Debbie Graham, who won a
couple pro doubles tournaments with
Birch last summer, has art equally bright
future. Her powerful serve-and-volley
game is remarkably polished given her
relative youth. If she maintains her will
to improve, greatness seems within reach.
Teri Whitlinger, an excellent all-around
athlete, "is going to blossom" in the near
future, according to Brennan. And, Ros
sides could be a fine pro if she stays
healthy.
Certainly, taking professional success
into account gives the '84 squad an edge
over their '89 counterparts. But, given
that the members of the '89 team are
still amateurs, it would be presumptuous
to state categorically they won't ac
complish as much.
The conclusion then, is that it's too
early to draw any conclusions. In four
weeks, the 1989 Stanford women's tennis
team will get a chance to rewrite at least
one chapter of the history books. As for
the rest, we'll have to stay tuned.
