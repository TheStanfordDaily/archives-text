Even with one of its top
starters watching from the
stands, the Stanford men's ten
nis team continued its winning
ways yesterday, crushing an
outmatched Utah team.

Men's Tennis
Cardinal 8, Utes 1

Stanford, ranked sixth in the
country in the latest Volvo/ln
tercollegiate Tennis Coaches
Association Poll, is now 13-4
on the season. The Cardinal
hosts No. 7 USC and No. 1
UCLA this weekend.
The win came without the
services of junior Jeff Cathrall,
who usually plays No. 2 singles
for the Cardinal. Cathrall has
been nursing a sprained left
wrist for a week, and Stanford
Coach Dick Gould decided to
give him a break from singles
play.
The right-handed Cathrall,
who hurt his wrist hitting a
left-handed shot during the
team's win at California last
week, did play No. 1 doubles
with Martin Blackman, but the
pair fell to Chris Entzel and
Brendan Bowyer, 3-6, 6-4, 6-3.
The wrist is slightly affecting
Cathrail's backhand, but he
should be ready for this week
end's matches.
Cathrall picked a good match
to miss. With everyone but Jeff
Tarango moving up in the
lineup, the Cardinal still won
all six singles contests.

Barry Richards needed all of
40 minutes to send Jorgen Lin
deman packing, 6-0, 6-2, in the
No. 5 match. Richards then re
turned to the grandstand to
watch Tarango face Entzel.
After toying with in the
first set (which he won in a
tiebreaker), Tarango put on a
show in the second, driving
Entzel crazy with an array of
forehand rockets and curving
backhand returns. Entzel went
quietly, 7-6, 6-3.
Minutes after Tarango
finished his exhibition, Alex
O'Brien finished his 6-4, 6-4
win over Bowyer, while Curtis
Dunn, making his first appear
ance in several weeks, cruised
6-1, 6-3 against Roger Jansson.
Blackman's match at No. 2
against Johan Hoegestedt pro
vided most of the day's excite
ment. After taking the first set
7-5 and dropping the second
3-6, Blackman found himself
down three games to zip in the
deciding set.
"The whole match I was
trying to play at a different
level, the level I'll need to play
at this weekend," Blackman
said, "and 1 think that hurt
me at times. ... 1 think I could
have won a lot more points if
I'd been more tentative."
After Hoegestedt pushed the
advantage to 4-0 (thanks in
part to a dubious call on a
Blackman baseline shot),
Blackman came alive, taking
six of the next eight games.
"He looked like he thought he
had won the match," Blackman
said, "so I just wanted to make
him earn it."
Hoegestedt, as it turned out,
earned nothing. The tiebreaker
turned out to be a struggle, with
Blackman's early 5-3 lead being
the largest advantage either
player would hold. Hoegestedt
closed to 5-4 with an ace, and
then went ahead with a beautiful
topspin lob and a double fault by
Blackman.
Facing Hoegestedt's third
match point of the day, Blackman
earned a reprieve when the Utes'
next lob landed long. After hitting
a return long, though, Blackman
was down another match point.
At 7-8, Blackman's serve came
alive. Hoegestedt's return was
long, and Blackman followed with
an ace to make it 9-8, but couldn't
convert. After exchanging points,
Blackman reached match point
with a running backhand volley.
With the match on his racket,
Blackman reached beck and blew
an ace right by Hoegestedt for
the 7-5, 3-6, 7-6 win.
