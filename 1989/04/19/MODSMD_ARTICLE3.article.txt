# Hardware hang-ups slow election flow
## 
### Rob Burwell Senior staff writer 
Although minor
problems with com
puter hardware and
long lines at highly
visible polling sites
plagued the first
day of ASSU elec
tions, most voters

surveyed yesterday said they were
generally pleased with the easy
to-use computerized voting sys
tem.
"We had a bumpy beginning,
but things settled down quite
well," said Election Commissioner
Steve Krauss.
Problems were more numerous
in the morning because the sys
tem was largely untested when
the polls first opened, according
to Assoc. Elections Commissioner
Mike Conte.
"We didn't have all the bugs
ironed out when we started this
morning, but at the end of the
day things seemed to be running
more smoothly," said Conte, a
junior.
The opening of the Clock Tower
polling station was delayed nearly
an hour when organizers had
trouble supplying electricity to the
computers, Conte said.
Most of the problems, however,
centered on the printing of en
coded hard copies of the ballots.
For example, computers at the
Post Office were down for a cou
ple of hours due to a problem
with the connection between the
computers and the printers, Conte
said.
The new computer system was

passed by the ASSU Senate last
quarter with the stipulation that
individual ballots be printed out
in case of a computer crash.
Even though he had to spend
more time in line to vote this year
than last year, sophomore Todd
Hosein called the computer voting
system "a good procedure," and
said that it "seems more organ
ized than last year."
Like last year's elections, long
lines — that the Macintoshes were
meant to alleviate — dissuaded
some students from voting.
"To some people voting is not
worth standing in line for 20
minutes. They have to streamline
the system if they want to get
people to vote," said sophomore
Marc Lipschultz.
Sophomore Nick Orum, inter
viewed at the voting station near
the Clock Tower, said the com
puters "definitely made it easier
to vote," but complained that
voters should not have been asked
to stand in the sun for 20 to 25
minutes.
Orum, however, was rewarded
with a cold soft drink for waiting
in the hot sun. "The free sodas
(only given out at the Clock Tower
poll site) made the trauma of
standing in the heat more
bearable," he said.
Although most of the Macintosh
SEs used for the voting are owned
by the University, organizers were
able to rent 20 additional comput
ers when they found that Apple
Computers would subsidize the
costs as their contribution to the
project, according to Krauss.
