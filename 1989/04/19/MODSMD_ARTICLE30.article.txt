# Cyclists struggle, fall to third in conference
## 
### Libby Feil Staff writer 
Despite the smooth manage
ment of the three races last week
end by the Stanford cycling team's
captains, the Stanford/Palo Alto
Bicycles Race Weekend ended with
only one win for the Cardinal
team and two for its archrival,
California.
Although the Cardinal has
traditionally been known more for
its criterium abilities than for its
road-racing skills, last weekend
Stanford won only its road race,
losing the team time trial and cri
terium to California.
Saturday's road race was Stan
ford's best event. The men's A
and Braces produced spectacular
placings and lots of points for the
Cardinal, and two riders also
finished well in the men's D and
women's Braces. As a result,
Stanford claimed the overall win
for the race, with a tenuous three
point advantage over California
and 42 points over third-place
finisher Cal Poly-San Luis
Obispo.
Stanford's men's A team gar
nered many points on the gently
rolling road course. Cardinal rider
Steve Miller escaped from the
pack with three other riders early
in the race; he finished third at
the finish line. Teammates Tom
Moyer and Art Walker managed
to score sixth and ninth overall.
The men's B pack was
dominated by Stanford riders. Jon
Kaplan snagged first place in the
final sprint, aided by teammates
Brian Sterling and Ken Zimmer
man, who placed fifth and sixth
respectively.
Finally, the men's D race got
the Cardinal off to an encouraging
start with a second-place finish

by team member James Drew. In
the women's B race Stanford
cyclist Stephanie Page placed fifth
overall.
Stanford finished a relatively
disappointing second overall in
the criterium on Sunday, losing
by a wide margin to the Golden
Bears. The women's A and men's
and women's B criteriums

resulted in the highest placings
for Stanford riders.
Although a few Cardinal riders
placed in the men's A criterium,
they did not score well enough to
bridge the point gap between Cal
ifornia and Stanford.
In the women's A criterium,
Stanford rider Shannon Phillips
followed in the footsteps of team

alumnus Pam Stevenson, who
won this event last year in front
of an enthusiastic home crowd.
Phillips used her formidable
sprinting ability to take first
place. Liz Moyer, a consistently
strong Stanford rider, placed
seventh overall, followed by team-

mate Tasha Brubaker in 10th.
Stanford controlled the men's
B field, as it has all year. Ken
Zimmerman broke away from the
pack and took first at the finish.
Fellow Cardinal Hank Dart put
in a magnificent effort to take
third place overall. Teammate Jon
Kaplan also scored points with a
ninth-place finish.
In the women's B race Stanford
rider Becky Wigglesworth sur
vived both the high attrition rate
and a crash to take third place
with a gutsy final sprint.
Expectations were high for
Stanford's A men. Unfortunately,
these hopes were not realized. Cal
ifornia managed to put two of its
riders into an early breakaway,
which stayed in the front for the
entire race and eventually lapped
the field.
"Cal just got off to a really good
start," Cardinal rider Coulter
Richardson said. He also pointed
out that "it was a really tight
course. You couldn't move up too

many positions at one time."
In the final placings for the
men's A field, Moyer placed sixth
(second in the field sprint), Steve
Miller was 12th and Jason
Tavakolian also scored in 15th
place. Overall, California took
first place to Stanford's second
and Cal Poly-SLO's third.
The team time trial on the pre
vious day resulted in even lower
placings for Stanford. The Bears
beat Stanford again, but so did
Cal Poly-SLO. Stanford had to
content itself with third place.
Both of Stanford's women's
teams placed in the 6.3-mile race,
one team finishing second and the
other eighth. All of the Cardinal
men's B teams placed as well,
coming in second, 10th and 16th.
The men's A teams placed fourth
and sixth.
This weekend's results move
Stanford down a spot in the over
all season standings for the West
ern Collegiate Cycling Conference,
from second to third. Unofficially
California now occupies the top
place in the WCCC, followed by
UC-San Diego and then Stanford.

the field.
"Cal just got off to a really good
start," Cardinal rider Coulter
Richardson said. He also pointed
out that "it was a really tight
course. You couldn't move up too

many positions at one time."
In the final placings for the
men's A field, Moyer placed sixth
(second in the field sprint), Steve
Miller was 12th and Jason
Tavakolian also scored in 15th
place. Overall, California took
first place to Stanford's second
and Cal Poly-SLO's third.
The team time trial on the pre
vious day resulted in even lower
placings for Stanford. The Bears
beat Stanford again, but so did
Cal Poly-SLO. Stanford had to
content itself with third place.
Both of Stanford's women's
teams placed in the 6.3-mile race,
one team finishing second and the
other eighth. All of the Cardinal
men's B teams placed as well,
coming in second, 10th and 16th.
The men's A teams placed fourth
and sixth.
This weekend's results move
Stanford down a spot in the over
all season standings for the West

from second to third. Unofficially
California now occupies the top
place in the WCCC, followed by
UC-San Diego and then Stanford.
Despite the smooth manage
ment of the three races last week
end by the Stanford cycling team's
captains, the Stanford/Palo Alto
Bicycles Race Weekend ended with
only one win for the Cardinal
team and two for its archrival,
California.
Although the Cardinal has
traditionally been known more for
its criterium abilities than for its
road-racing skills, last weekend
Stanford won only its road race,
losing the team time trial and cri
terium to California.
Saturday's road race was Stan
ford's best event. The men's A
and Braces produced spectacular
placings and lots of points for the
Cardinal, and two riders also
finished well in the men's D and
women's Braces. As a result,
Stanford claimed the overall win
for the race, with a tenuous three
point advantage over California
and 42 points over third-place
finisher Cal Poly-San Luis
Obispo.
Stanford's men's A team gar
nered many points on the gently
rolling road course. Cardinal rider
Steve Miller escaped from the
pack with three other riders early
in the race; he finished third at
the finish line. Teammates Tom
Moyer and Art Walker managed
to score sixth and ninth overall.
The men's B pack was
dominated by Stanford riders. Jon
Kaplan snagged first place in the
final sprint, aided by teammates
Brian Sterling and Ken Zimmer
man, who placed fifth and sixth
respectively.
Finally, the men's D race got
the Cardinal off to an encouraging
start with a second-place finish

by team member James Drew. In
the women's B race Stanford
cyclist Stephanie Page placed fifth
overall.
Stanford finished a relatively
disappointing second overall in
the criterium on Sunday, losing
by a wide margin to the Golden
Bears. The women's A and men's
and women's B criteriums

resulted in the highest placings
for Stanford riders.
Although a few Cardinal riders
placed in the men's A criterium,
they did not score well enough to
bridge the point gap between Cal
ifornia and Stanford.
In the women's A criterium,
Stanford rider Shannon Phillips
followed in the footsteps of team

alumnus Pam Stevenson, who
won this event last year in front
of an enthusiastic home crowd.
Phillips used her formidable
sprinting ability to take first
place. Liz Moyer, a consistently
strong Stanford rider, placed
seventh overall, followed by team-

mate Tasha Brubaker in 10th.
Stanford controlled the men's
B field, as it has all year. Ken
Zimmerman broke away from the
pack and took first at the finish.
Fellow Cardinal Hank Dart put
in a magnificent effort to take
third place overall. Teammate Jon
Kaplan also scored points with a
ninth-place finish.
In the women's B race Stanford
rider Becky Wigglesworth sur
vived both the high attrition rate
and a crash to take third place
with a gutsy final sprint.
Expectations were high for
Stanford's A men. Unfortunately,
these hopes were not realized. Cal
ifornia managed to put two of its
riders into an early breakaway,
which stayed in the front for the
entire race and eventually lapped
the field.
"Cal just got off to a really good
start," Cardinal rider Coulter
Richardson said. He also pointed
out that "it was a really tight
course. You couldn't move up too

many positions at one time."
In the final placings for the
