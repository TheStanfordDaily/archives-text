# Volleyball travels to UCLA
## 
### John Kirks Staff writer 
The Stanford men's volley
ball team heads south this
week for the final three games
of its regular season. Any hopes
of a Western Intercollegiate
Volleyball Association league
title hinge on tonight's match,
an immediate rematch with the
UCLA Bruins. The Cardinal
will play out its regular season
over the weekend with matches
against Loyola Marymount and
Pepperdine.
The Cardinal, which was no
doubt reeling a bit after Sat
urday night's emotionally
taxing, five-game loss to
UCLA, had a mediocre practice
on Monday night. Stanford
Coach Fred Sturm was not
worried, though, acknowledg
ing the transition time his
team would require.
About last night's practice,
however, Sturm said,"We need

to have a good practice
tonight."
Looking ahead a bit, if Stan
ford can indeed pull off an up
set at Pauley Pavillion (and a
Stanford victory would
definitely be classified as an
upset), a scary prospect enters
into the WIVA picture. The
one-match playoff that existed
in the 1970's in the case that
two teams tied for the league
championship no longer
decides the league title.
In fact, a tiebreaking system
was installed in the early 80's
but has never been used. The
system is so obscure that no
one seems to be quite sure of
the exact criteria used to
declare a champion.
Of course, that dilemma is
being righted by WIVA's league
officials, but at this point, the
players do not know if a victory
over UCLA would help them
or not.
