A column in yesterday's Daily
incorrectly stated that overturn
ing the Roe v. Wade decision
would make abortion illegal and
childbearing "compulsory for all
pregnant women." Actually, a Su
preme Court rejection of the 1973
decision would return lawmaking
power regarding abortion to indi
vidual states.
Also, two names were mis
spelled in Monday's Daily. John
Abbott is an ASSU Senate candi
date, and Ray Bacchetti is the
University's Vice Provost.
