# State certifies USW as representative of Webb Ranch workers
## 
### Mike Friedly 
Having received no complaints
about the voting procedure, the
Agricultural Labor Relations
Board on Monday certified the
Llnited Stanford Workers as the
legal representative of Webb
Ranch workers.
The certification comes in the
wake of a 36 to 5 vote by ranch
workers on April 6 to join the
USW. Board attorney Bob Dresser
said that neither the union nor
Webb Ranch filed any objections,
which need to emerge within five
days of the vote in order to block
the certification procedures.
Webb Ranch attorney Lisa Mar
tin said the election was fair and
that the Webb family would not
challenge the proceedings of the
vote.
The decision essentially gives
the LISW the power to force Webb
Ranch representatives back to the
negotiations table after talks be
tween the two broke down at the
end of February. The talks will
be held "in good faith," and any
complaints would be handled di
rectly by the board, according to
Dresser.
However, USW field represen
tative Mike Tatham said that the
union had no established time line
for setting up talks between the
USW and Webb Ranch officials.
As of yesterday, there was no of
ficial contact between the two par
ties.
Negotiations between the USW
and Webb Ranch officials over the

housing conditions of the migrant
workers were originally scheduled
for Feb. 27. These talks were
postponed indefinitely soon after
a mysterious fire ripped through
the home of Stanley Webb and his
son Gary, the owners of the ranch.
Controversy originally arose
when San Mateo County officials
cited Webb Ranch for more than
70 violations of health and safety
regulations, ranging from leaky
pipes to overcrowding.
Union officials remain wary,
however, despite the ruling in
their favor. "It's a good sign, but
we're still cautious," said Tatham.
The union is worried that Webb
Ranch officials could still disrupt
the negotiations by stalling or en
tangling the case in court.
Tatham also stated that "Stan
ford University has a moral obli
gation" to help better the
conditions of the workers at Webb
Ranch. The University, however,
will not take part in the negoti
ations because of the board's ear
lier decision that Webb Ranch is
the sole employer of the migrant
workers.
Since Webb Ranch workers oc
casionally work directly for Stan
ford, the USW had maintained
that the University is a joint em
ployer.
The board's regional director
Bob Salens, who handled the USW
case, determined that since the
work done by the migrant workers
for the University was considered
non-agricultural, it was outside of
the board's jurisdiction.
