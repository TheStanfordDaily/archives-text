# The
						long arm of alcohol regulation

This is the second in a three-part
series examining alcohol regulation pol
icies pertinent to Stanford students, in
light of a proposed revision of the Uni
versity alcohol policy.

When it comes to alcohol, universities
often seem like sanctuaries free from
the law.
And under a more relaxed alcohol
policy now in the making, Stanford
would virtually acquiesce to underage
drinking, only taking action if a drunk
student's conduct violated the Funda
mental Standard or the Residential
Agreement.
But before students tap a keg in
celebration of apparently fret 1 drinking,
they should read the bottom of the
policy which states in capital letters that
the University is "not a sanctuary from
the enforcement of state and local laws."

Stanford Police Chief Marv Herring
ton said Stanford's new alcohol policy
would not change the way his force
conducts business with students.
The policy reflects "what we've been
doing all along," he said. ' The Univer
sity is not set up to be a policing agency
The policy is accurate in describing what
the situation really is."
But while state and local laws explic
itly describe illegal actions relating to
the possession and consumption of al
cohol, police officers readily admit that
a lack of available resources hinders
their ability to enforce the rules.
According to Stanford Police Capt.
Raoul Niemever, police most often cite
students for alcohol law violations on
the following three premises:
• if officers observe or receive com
plaints of alcohol possession or purchase
by people under 21 years
• if officers receive a call or observe
intoxicated people who cannot take care
of themselves

• if officers stop drivers whose blood
alcohol level identifies them as drunk,
currently measured at a blood-alcohol
level of .10 percent (A proposal in the
state legislature would decrease that
level to .08 percent)
California law also states that it is a
criminal offense for those under 21 to
falsify evidence of age to purchase al
cohol, carry open containers of alcohol
in public places or drive a vehicle while
carrying alcohol.
No one may have an open container
of liquor in a motor vehicle, the law
states.
Herrington said officers not only en
force these laws in open areas of campus
but also in University residences, in
cluding lounges and hallways. He said
police will not enter a student's room
without a warrant or without "probable
cause," such as a complaint that some-
