# The 						long arm of alcohol regulation
## 
### Jason Bloomstein Staff writer 
This is the second in a three-part
series examining alcohol regulation pol
icies pertinent to Stanford students, in
light of a proposed revision of the Uni
versity alcohol policy.

When it comes to alcohol, universities
often seem like sanctuaries free from
the law.
And under a more relaxed alcohol
policy now in the making, Stanford
would virtually acquiesce to underage
drinking, only taking action if a drunk
student's conduct violated the Funda
mental Standard or the Residential
Agreement.
But before students tap a keg in
celebration of apparently fret 1 drinking,
they should read the bottom of the
policy which states in capital letters that
the University is "not a sanctuary from
the enforcement of state and local laws."

Stanford Police Chief Marv Herring
ton said Stanford's new alcohol policy
would not change the way his force
conducts business with students.
The policy reflects "what we've been
doing all along," he said. ' The Univer
sity is not set up to be a policing agency
The policy is accurate in describing what
the situation really is."
But while state and local laws explic
itly describe illegal actions relating to
the possession and consumption of al
cohol, police officers readily admit that
a lack of available resources hinders
their ability to enforce the rules.
According to Stanford Police Capt.
Raoul Niemever, police most often cite
students for alcohol law violations on
the following three premises:
• if officers observe or receive com
plaints of alcohol possession or purchase
by people under 21 years
• if officers receive a call or observe
intoxicated people who cannot take care
of themselves

• if officers stop drivers whose blood
alcohol level identifies them as drunk,
currently measured at a blood-alcohol
level of .10 percent (A proposal in the
state legislature would decrease that
level to .08 percent)
California law also states that it is a
criminal offense for those under 21 to
falsify evidence of age to purchase al
cohol, carry open containers of alcohol
in public places or drive a vehicle while
carrying alcohol.
No one may have an open container
of liquor in a motor vehicle, the law
states.
Herrington said officers not only en
force these laws in open areas of campus
but also in University residences, in
cluding lounges and hallways. He said
police will not enter a student's room
without a warrant or without "probable
cause," such as a complaint that some-
one is causing destruction.
Officers may also enter a party
to cite underage drinkers,
Niemeyer said.
While the law appears strict on
paper, police officers admit that
in reality enforcement is "reac
tionary." They usually enforce the
underage drinking laws only when
they observe violations after re
ceiving phone complaints.
The erratic enforcement has fos
tered confusion on the part of
students about the police's en
forcement policies, but Herrington
said no plans are in effect to alter
or clarify police practices.
Because of a limited number of
police officers who consider un
derage drinking a lower priority,
compared to thwarting robberies

and other more serious crimes,
there is seemingly lax enforcement
of state and local liquor laws,
Niemeyer said.
"It is not our policy to foot pa
trol dormitories and seek out un
derage drinkers," he said. "It
would take an army of police."
"You have to weigh the impor
tance of enforcing college drinking
laws against patrolling against
burglary and other crimes," said
Alan Ashby, an information offi
cer at the State Attorney Gener
al's office. "We really have no
policy other than to uphold the
law, but it is a fact of life that
police departments have limited
resources," he said.
Herrington said his force does
not even patrol dorm parties un
less the department receives
several complaints about the noise
level.
"We don't assume there is un

derage drinking at a campus
party," he said. "Mostly when par
ties spill out onto the street we
can bust people who have alcohol
and who are underage."
Punishments vary
The punishments for violating
the laws are as varied as the laws
themselves. Underage drinkers
usually must appear in court and
pay a hefty fine, while those found
drunk and unable to take care of
themselves can be taken to the
North County Holding Facility in
Palo Alto.
Convicted underage drinkers
may also lose their drivers'
licenses for up to one year under
a California law passed in Janu
ary.
This law also applies to people
with out-of-state licenses, accord
ing to Eric Carlson, an assistant
to Sen. Bill Campbell of Los An
geles, author of the bill.
