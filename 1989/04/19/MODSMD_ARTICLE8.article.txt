# Digital Corp. donates $8 million
## 
### DJ Berinstein Senior staff writer 
Digital Equipment Corp. has
donated $8 million to Stanford's
Centennial Campaign, giving a
shot in the arm to the Near West
campus renovation.
Although it is large, the gift is
not the largest ever from the
Massachusetts-based computer
company. In 1984, Digital gave
Stanford $9.8 million in cash and
hardware. Counting the latest lar
gesse, the company has given $20
million over the past 10 years.
Most of this year's gift — $7.5
million — will be equipment for
a communications network, re
search development and teaching.
The rest will be cash for specific
education programs.

In a statement issued through
the University News Service,
Samuel Fuller, a Digital vice pres
ident, explained the reason behind
the gift: "It is Digital's hope that
this grant will serve to strengthen
the relationship that we have
formed with Stanford over the
years and allow the University to
increase the number of well
prepared graduates who are
headed for careers in education
and industry."
The gift is welcome news for
the University's Near West
campus, a 26-building science and
engineering renewal project lo
cated west of the Quad. In Feb
ruary, the halfway point in the
$1.1 billion Centennial Campaign,
the University announced that
fundraising for Near West was be

hind schedule. The total bill for
Near West is $180 million, but as
of February, the University had
only raised $72 million.
Digital may not be as visible on
campus as IBM and Apple, but
that is only because the company
specializes in items not normally
utilized by a large number of stu
dents — networking equipment
and mainframe systems.
Although Digital's donating
record is not as strong as IBM's,
its record exceeds Apple's, accord
ing to Evelyn Kelsey, associate di
rector for the Office of Develop
ment.
"It's a good gesture of public
relations for (Digital and other
companies) to have faculty, stu
dents and staff experimenting
with their equipment," she said.
