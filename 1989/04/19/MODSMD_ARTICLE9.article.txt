## Inflation at highest level in two years 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Higher
food and energy costs boosted con
sumer prices 0.5 percent in March
and resulted in a 6.1 percent an
nual inflation rate for the first
three months of 1989, the largest
quarterly advance in two years,
the government said yesterday.
Last month's gain in the Labor
Department's Consumer Price In
dex was fresh evidence that infla
tion continues to run above the
4.4 percent rate registered in both
1987 and 1988.
Analysts said the bad news isn't
over yet.
"Inflation was uncomfortably
high, widespread and entrenched
in March," said Allen Sinai, chief
economist for the Boston Co. "We
haven't seen the last of these high
numbers because there will still
be a rippling through of rising
business costs for both materials
and wages and rising energy costs
in the next few months."
Stock prices rose sharply. After
four hours of trading, the Dow
Jones 30-stock industrial average
was up more than 36 points.
Thomas Walsh of Nikko Secu
rities International in New York
said that "people were expecting
the numbers to be worse. It's not

a great number but the street is
viewing it as an OK number and
it has stimulated buy interest."
Economist James Annable of
the First National Bank of
Chicago commented:
"The market is betting that the
economy is slowing down pretty
dramatically. I suspect that's
wrong. We expect slower growth,
but good growth. Inflation is
going to continue to inch upward."
Economist John Hagens of the
WEFA Group, a forecasting firm
in Bala Cynwyd, Pa., said the na
tion appears destined for a round
of "stagflation," in which the eco
nomy slows while prices continue
to rise, forcing the Federal
Reserve to choose between further
restraining growth to curb infla
tion and boosting the economy to
stimulate employment.
President Bush told a building
trades group the key to continued
economic health for the nation is
bringing down inflation and in
terest rates by reducing the
federal deficit.
"We must keep inflation and
interest rates down and the way
to do that is to bring the budget
deficit down," he said.
