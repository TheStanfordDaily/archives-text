#3-Natural Beef
Whole Foods Market has the purest and freshest meats available anywhere
in town. That's a bold claim. And we can back up every word of it.
Much of the beef currently being marketed in our area as "natural" has been
fed hormones in early stages of development. This beef is categorized as
natural by meeting minimal residue avoidance criteria.
At Whole Foods Market, we carry beef exclusively from the Coleman Ranch
in the Colorado Rockies, where America's purest beef has been raised for over
100 years.
Our beef has never received any antibiotics, hormones, growth stimulants or
tranquilizers. And that's a natural fact.
