# Campus gets sneak preview of NeXT
## 
### Caitlin Liu Staff writer 
As crowds of students pressed close
to demonstration tables to see what the
new, sleek black machine was all about,
NeXT representatives touted their com
puter's vast array of capabilities.
Though its main release to the public
won't be until this summer, the NeXT
computer was unveiled to Stanford stu
dents in front of the Bookstore yester
day.
"I really believe that Steve [Jobs] has
done it again — come out with a revolu
tionary machine," said Stuart Reges, a
senior lecturer for the Computer Science
Department.
Currently, there is an early release of
NeXT only to buyers who are well ac
quainted with the UNIX operating sys
tem. Sales are still selective because a
few bugs remain in the machine, said

NeXT regional sales manager Mark
Hayes.
Hayes summed up the NeXT com
puter in its three key features: a main
frame architecture, the use of optical
discs and a user-friendly interface.
"The mainframe architecture gives
NeXT the ability to run several pro
grams simultaneously," Hayes said.
NeXT's 256 megabyte optical disc also
allows its users to store an enormous
amount of data. In comparison, a Mac
intosh hard disc has only 20 MBs of
memory, he explained.
A single disc's memory can store
every work of Shakespeare and still
have room for additional texts.
Finally, Hayes added that the NeXT
computer is user-friendly. With its
mouse pad, "it's very Macintosh-like,"
he said.
To the 50 or so people crowding
around the demonstration tables, how

ever, the most outstanding aspect of
NeXT may well be its extremely life-like
graphics.
Business School Ph.D. student Janet
Spitz said she thought the computer
screen's resolution was "so much more
superior" than that of a Macintosh Plus.
"If (the computer game) Dark Castle
were on this, my kids would freak out,"
she said. "I wouldn't be able to tear
them away."
The NeXT computer, given all of its
capabilities, has one drawback —
the cost. Its current base price of $6,825
may deter a lot of students from a pur
chase in the near future.
"It cost a hell of a lot," said sophomore
Jon Freund, standing on a chair in back
of the crowd so that he could see. "It's
the most amazing machine I've ever
seen though."
