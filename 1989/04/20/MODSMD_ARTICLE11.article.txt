MEXICO CITY (AP) - Ramon Salcido
Bojorquez, a California winery worker ar
rested yesterday in the slayings of seven
people, told Mexican police he killed his wife
and a co-worker because he thought they were
having an affair, officials said.
"He was arrested before dawn this morning
in a surprise roadblock set up by agents fight
ing the illicit drug trade," said Vicente Men
doza, a spokesman for the attorney general's
office.
Salcido, also suspected of killing two
daughters, his mother-in-law and two sisters
in-law in a rampage in Sonoma County, Calif.,
was picked up just outside Guasave, the
spokesman said. The village is near Los
Mochis, Salcido's hometown in Sinaloa state
about 850 miles northwest of Mexico City.
Mendoza said he did not know Salcido's
nationality, and U.S. Embassy spokesman Bill
Graves said the embassy was not certain
whether he was an American citizen.
"He has been arrested at the request of
U.S. authorities who have asked for his ex
tradition. We are bringing him to Mexico City,"
Mendoza said, adding that Salcido was in the
custody of the Federal Judicial Police, a branch
of the attorney general's office.
He said Salcido would be taken to Mexico
City for an extradition hearing.
Javier Coello Trejo, deputy attorney general,
told reporters Salcido drove into Mexico at
the Calexico, Calif., border crossing.
Coello said Salcido told police under ques
tioning he had lived in California for nine
years and acquired American citizenship.
Other officials said that information is being
checked with police in California.
Salcido told Mexican police he went on the
rampage in a fit of jealousy after suspecting
that his wife of five years was having an
affair with one of his co-workers, Tracy
Toovey, Coello said.
Salcido, 28, was a forklift operator who
worked with Toovey at the winery. About 300
people attended a memorial service Tuesday
for Toovey in Sonoma County.
According to Coello, Salcido told police he
killed his wife with a 9mm pistol.

Salcido was arrested the same day services
1 were being held in Petaluma, Calif., for some
' of the six members of Salcido's family who
were killed.
! Salcido's wife, mother-in-law, two sisters
in-law, and Toovey were butchered, shot to

death or both on April 15. The next day, three
of Salcido's daughters were found with their
throats cut, two of them dead.
Salcido has been charged with four of the
killings and was being sought on a federal
warrant for flight to avoid prosecution.
