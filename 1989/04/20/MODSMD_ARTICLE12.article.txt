# House rep. questions Israeli aid
## Congressman angry about recent Palestinian deaths 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - The
chairman of a House foreign op
erations panel yesterday ques
tioned U.S. aid to Israel in light
of incidents in which Israeli sol
diers have shot fleeing Palestinian
demonstrators in the back.
"When is that stupid practice
going to end?" asked David Obey,
D-Wis., who heads the House Sub
committee on Foreign Operations,
which appropriates foreign aid
money.
"I don't want to take responsi
bility for giving one dime to a
country whose military forces are
firing at people in retreat," Obey

said angrily at a hearing on the
Bush administration's 1990 aid
request for Israel and other
Middle Eastern countries.
It is rare for a congressman to
make such bluntly critical com
ments in public about Israel.
The administration is asking to
maintain the same level of aid to
Israel — $3 billion, the most of
any foreign nation.
Obey said he had raised his con
cerns with the Bush administra
tion and with Israel and all he
had received were "words."
A State Department official who
handles U.S. ties with the Middle

East, Deputy Assistant Secretary
of State Ned Walker, said the ad
ministration continues to urge Is
rael to stop the practice. "We're
not satisfied," he said.
But Walker also expressed sym
pathy for the Israeli soldiers, say
ing he had been in the Israeli
occupied Gaza Strip and seen
them having to deal with violent
Palestinian demonstrators. "It's
difficult for them," he said of the
soldiers.
More than 400 Palestinians
have been killed in a violent upris
ing launched 17 months ago to
protest Israel's 21-year rule of the
West Bank and Gaza Strip.
