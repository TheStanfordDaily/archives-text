NORFOLK, Va. (AP) - A huge
gun turret packed with gunpow
der exploded in flames on the bat
tleship USS lowa near Puerto
Rico yesterday, killing at least 47
sailors in one of the worst naval
disasters since the Vietnam War.
The death toll from the acci
dent, during a gunnery exercise,
"could go higher, but we don't
know at this point," said Lt.
Cmdr. Steve Burnett, a press rep
resentative for the Atlantic Fleet,
based in Norfolk.
The number of crewmen in
jured had not been determined,
he said.
Two ships participating in the
same exercise collided yesterday
afternoon about 500 miles east of
Jacksonville, Fla., causing one
minor injury, said Archie Gal
loway, a civilian public affairs of
ficer at Norfolk.
Neither the USS Piatt, a fleet
oiler, nor the frigate USS Tripp
was in danger of sinking, Gal
loway said. The ships were not in
the same area as the lowa.
lowa crewmen put out a fire in
a turret, each of which supports
three of the ship's nine 16-inch
guns, flooded several compart
ments holding explosives as a
precaution, and declared the ship
no longer in danger, said Lt.
Cmdr. Chris Baumann, another
press representative for the fleet.
The fire was in the second of
the two forward turrets, said
Bruce Nason, a Navy press rep
resentative at the Pentagon. There
also is a turret at the back of the
lowa.
The lowa rendezvoused at
midafternoon with the nearby
aircraft carrier USS Coral Sea,
which carries three doctors and
has full medical facilities,
Baumann said. Helicopters from
the Coral Sea brought medical
equipment to the lowa and trans

ferred some injured crewmen to
the carrier.
The lowa will proceed today to
Roosevelt Roads, a Navy base in
Puerto Rico, said Cmdr. Robert
Franzmann of the Atlantic Fleet.
The 46-year-old ship, one of the
four largest in the fleet, is based
at Norfolk.
Navy officials were notifying
relatives personally of the deaths,
Baumann said.
The explosion occurred during
a gunnery exercise about 330
miles northeast of Puerto Rico,
Burnett said.
The ship's guns were being test
fired and the turret was "full of
gunpowder," Baumann said. The
16-inch guns can fire 2,700-pound
shells a distance of 23 miles.
A gun turret is normally occu
pied by 27 people, but can hold
60 or 70 people, Baumann said,
but, "We don't know how many
people were in there at the time."
Mark Newton, a former Marine
who spent a week as a guest on
the lowa in 1987 and now is
curator of the permanently docked
USS Massachusetts in Fall River,
Mass., explained how a shell is
loaded.
After the shell is placed in the
gun, a door is opened to the gun
room from the powder hoist room,
he said. The powder is then
rammed in behind the shell and
what is called a breech plug is
sealed to prevent the leakage of
powder gases.
Newton said there were "at
least five" stages in the firing
process when the explosion could
have occurred but would not spec
ulate further.
The training exercise to im
prove fleet readiness began April
13 and involved 19,000 people
aboard 29 U.S. ships, three allied
ships and shore-based aircraft,
Baumann said.
