Did officials know about Fl. 103?
LONDON (AP) — A British newspaper re
ported today that large numbers of U.S. diplomats
apparently heeded an official warning and can
celed seats on Pan Am flights in the weeks before
the bombing of Flight 103.
The Independent, a respected daily, cited a U.S.
House of Representatives panel probing the Dec.
'21 bombing. It said the House panel saw internal
Pan Am documents that show Christmas holiday
traffic for U.S. embassies had been heavily re
booked before the bombing over Lockerbie, Scot
land, which killed 270 people.
The newspaper noted relatives of those who
died in the bombing have been angry that a U.S.
Federal Aviation Administration warning of a
possible bombing of a Pan Am flight from

Frankfurt, West Germany to the United States
was not made public. They say diplomats would
have acted on the warnings and canceled Pan
Am flights.
Georgian protesters poisoned
MOSCOW (AP) — The Soviet government
newspaper Izvestia said yesterday that some vic
tims of a clash between soldiers and protesters
in Soviet Georgia are suffering from a poison
resembling a nerve toxin.
Izvestia's interview with Georgia's health min
ister, Irakliy Menagarishvili, appeared to bolster
charges by activists in the southern republic that
soldiers used a toxic substance to break up a
nationalist demonstration April 9 on Tbilisi's
main street. The clash killed 20 people.
