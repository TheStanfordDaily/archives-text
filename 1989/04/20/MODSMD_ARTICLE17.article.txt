### 
Stanford must pay
closer attention to
health and safety

STANFORD HAS A NEW
Health and Safety director
responsible for shaping up
a department plagued with mini
disasters that could turn into
major catastrophes.
The new director, Carol Hoer
ner, faces quite a challenge when
it comes to reshaping the atti
tudes and inefficient procedures
of Health and Safety.
Take February's "minor" ex
plosion at a Medical School lab
oratory for instance. When a jar
containing a cancer-causing
chemical exploded there, Health
and Safety's response to the
emergency was far from speedy
or professional.
Two Medical School students
who heard the explosion called
the Health and Safety emergency
hotline, only to talk with an in
experienced operator. While
firefighters arrived on the scene
20 minutes later, it took Health
and Safety officials two hours to
show up.
And why did the chemical ex
plosion occur in the first place?
For starters, a lot of the chemi
cals over at Health and Safety
aren't documented or cataloged.
The law requires that all chemi
cals used by a company or insti
tution be accompanied by a fact
sheet with information about the
chemical and safety precaution.
The carcinogenic chemical was
missing such a fact sheet.
The explosion occurred be
cause the chemical was stored at
room temperature when it should

have been refrigerated. Part of
the blame for this blunder goes
to the company manufacturing
the chemical; the chemical's con
tainer had the wrong information
on it.
But poor compliance with
health and safety regulations was
involved too.
The documentation on the
hazardous chemical was almost
4 years old. Furthermore, Health
and Safety informational boxes
which are supposed to contain
current information about what
and where chemicals are stored
in laboratories were inaccurate.
After reading the informational
boxes, the two Medical School
students walked right into the
lab, trusting this false informa
tion.
Health and Safety officials
need to update their files and
catalogues now. They must more
diligently enforce rules governing
the storage, handling and
documentation of dangerous and
potentially explosive chemicals.
And what about the cleanup?
It took Health and Safety 10 days
to clean up the toxic spill — even
though a Medical Center report
promised that the mess would be
cleaned up in five or six days.
Once the cleanup finally oc
curred, it cost the University
$30,000. Prevention would have
been cheaper.
Not only is this carelessness
costing the University money,
but it's putting the Stanford com
munity's safety at risk. Safety is
a priority, not an afterthought.
While no real harm came out
of February's chemical spill, it
showed some distressing goings
on at Health and Safety.
Minor toxic spills mean that
major ones can also occur. What
will happen next time?
