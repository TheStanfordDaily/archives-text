## Keep Dish area available for Stanford bikers, dogs 
### 
I AM A HIKER, not a biker, but I
have seen many bikers around the
Dish and I have never seen one
abuse the privilege. Supposedly they
use trails which are not "designated,"
or carve new trails. It seems a bicyclist
would have a hard time pushing his or
her bike through tall grass and fresh
cow patties without falling off into
either one or both.
The trails in use other than the
paved ones have obviously been in use
for a long time. They are wide, hard
and deep. If the University is seriously
worried about cyclists doing damage, it
should mark special cycling trails on
the trail guide at the gate and/or have
individual trail maps available at the
gates for cyclists to take with them.

In his excellent April 12 letter to
Campus Report, Roman Dial asks if
the dog walkers will be the next to go.
In a sense, they already have, in that
dogs are required to be on leash so
that they will not chase the cows. I
could go on about people who train
their dogs vs. people who don't, but
that's another story.
My dog happens to be smart enough
not to chase anything bigger than she
is, but perhaps I'm just lucky. I have
walked her around the Dish all of her
life and she has never had to be put
on a leash.
Dogs are also supposed to be on
leash so they will not foul the areas
around the gates. This is reasonable.
However, unleashed dogs usually will

"do their thing" beside the trail. A
leashed dog doesn't have that option
. . . as I have noticed. Fortunately my
hiking shoes have thick soles and there
was some damp grass available, but
yuck.
Stanford land should be open to
Stanford people. We are either students
here paying money, part of which I am
sure goes to lands upkeep, or we are
workers, staff and professors keeping
the University afloat. I would be will
ing to bet that the problems occur on
weekend afternoons, when the whole
world descends on the Dish.
What if the gates were electronic?
Only Stanford people would be offered
a card, like an ATM card, at a certain
yearly fee. In order to open the gate,

you would have to put your card in a
slot.
There could be a no-picnicking rule
which could be enforced by the officer
on horseback or, better yet, by stu
dents who would be paid an hourly
wage to act as patrollers.
The patrollers' pay would come from
the yearly card fee, which could also
be used to defray costs of trail mark
ers and general upkeep. Designated
trails could be marked and patrolled by
students, who could additionally cau
tion people with out-of-control dogs.
It seems to me like a good idea. Is it
too simple?
