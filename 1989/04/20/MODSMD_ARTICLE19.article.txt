# Roe v. Wade opinion is 'ka-ka,' not law
## 
### 
I would like to address two errors in
Lyzette Settle's April 18 column, in
which she presents a defense of current
abortion laws.
The first is a logical inconsistency in
Settle's discussion of the personhood of
an unborn human. Settle poses the
question, ". . . is the termination of a
pregnancy comparable to the murder of
a child?" and obliquely answers her
own question with, "It is questionable
if the fetus can actually be given
status as a person, since it is incapable
of existing outside of the mother's
womb."
This issue of dependency is not
enough to differentiate the born and
the unborn, since children are com
pletely dependent on external care for a
long period after birth. Settle's argu
ment, as given, is a defense of infan-

ticide. I assume this inference was not
intended.
The second error is one of percep
tion. In her conclusion, Settle states,
in reference to a threat against Roe v.
Wade, "... the Supreme Court needs
to look at all of the possible ramifica
tions of its decision ... by (nullifying
Roe v. Wadel the court would not only
hurt women and the citizens of our
country, but also those it purports to
help."
This passage demonstrates Settle's
lack of understanding of the American
judicial system. The court should not
look at the possible results of its deci
sion. The proper role of any court is to
interpret the law as written, not craft
social policy. It is exactly this sort of
judicial legislation which led to the Roe
v. Wade decision.
At the risk of increasing the
rationality level of the abortion argu
ment, I suggest that all interested par
ties read the Roe v. Wade decision
before talking about it. All should be
surprised at the crude, illogical argu
ment given in the majority opinion.

Roe v. Wade is not law, it is ka-ka,
and almost any decision made concern
ing Webster v. Reproductive Health
Services would have to be an improve
ment.
