# Sobriety and the Standard line
## How the University defines responsible drinking behavior 
### Jason Bloomstein Staff writer 
Editor's note: This is the last in a three-part
series examining alcohol regulation policies pertinent
to Stanford students, in light of a proposed revision
of the University alcohol policy.

Although the Fundamental Standard is not writ
ten into the current alcohol policy, the University
uses this code of behavior to determine whether a
student has acted irresponsibly when drunk.
Of the 11 Standard violations against students
last year, cases involving alcohol abuse accounted
for about half, Judicial Affairs Officer Sally Cole
said. Alcohol-related incidents have constituted
roughly 50 percent of the Fundamental Standard

cases heard over the past few years, she said.
A new alcohol policy, now being put into written
words, allows students to drink liquor on campus
so long as their actions do not violate the Funda
mental Standard.
The policy does not immunize students from state
and local laws regarding alcohol possession. Police
can still enforce underage drinking laws at anytime
in any part of campus, according to Stanford Police
Chief Marv Herrington.
Recent debates over the Fundamental Standard
have cited Stanford's one-line policy on student con
duct as vague, and therefore many say violations
are difficult to determine.
But Assoc. Dean of Student Affairs Norm Robin-
son said the Fundamental Stand
ard's generality makes it an ap
propriate means for judging stu
dent conduct in an alcohol abuse
case.
A policy that attempts to out
line every conceivable alcohol
violation would grow into a "hope
less list of 'do's' and 'don'ts',"
Asst. Dean of Student Affairs
Norm Robinson said. The Funda
mental Standard "forces people to
think about their behavior" when
drinking, he said.
Cole added that "it is not that
difficult" to determine when a
student's actions resulting from
alcohol abuse violate the Funda
mental Standard.
For example, cases of drunk
driving often result in Standard
charges because they pose threats
to others' safety and property.
One stark example of a drunk
driving Standard violation oc
cured when a student passed out
while driving his car near the cor
ner of Campus Drive and Serra
Street.
The University suspended the
student for one quarter, according
to documents The Daily received
outlining various Fundamental
Standard violations. The reckless
driver did not cause any damages
even though he had a blood alcohol

content of .20 percent, twice the
amount California law declares as
legally drunk.
In this case, Provost James
Rosse postponed a one-quarter
suspension because the student
was enrolled for the next quarter
at the Tours campus in France.
The University's punishment
for such action, typical of many
alcohol-related Fundamental
Standard convictions, includes a
suspension, a $100 or 20-hour
work fine, and the inability of the
student to transfer credit to the
University from work done during
a suspension.
In another drunk driving case,
a convicted senior who immedi
ately accepted responsibility for
his violation was served a 20-hour
work or $100 fine and had to help
pay for the light pole he broke
while driving, but no suspension.
Some students who engaged in
verbal abuse when drunk also vi

olated the Fundamental Standard.
University officials suspended an
undergraduate who left messages
on a woman's answering machine
threateneing her with sexual vio
lence. In writing about the case,
University President Donald Ken
nedy stated that he would con
sider readmitting the student
after a one-year suspension if he
had shown evidence of "identifying
and resolving" his alcohol abuse
problem and anti-social behavior.
In another incident of harass
ment which led to a one-quarter
suspension, a student terrorized
a woman in his dormitory, forced
her to leave her room and
urinated on her bed. And because
he did not apologize to the woman
until two months after the inci
dent, he had to pay a $150 res
titution fine to the woman, and
a $150 or 40-hour work fine to
the University.
