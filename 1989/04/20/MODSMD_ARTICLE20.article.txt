# Ex-CIA agent must account for his past
## 
### 
On April 18, Philip Agee, a former
CIA employee and critic of U.S. foreign
policy, spoke at Stanford. But free
speech also requires responsibility for
Agee to account for his past.
When Agee left the CIA in 1968, he
refused a ticket back to the United
States and chose instead to go to
Havana, where he received support
from the Cuban DGI intelligence serv
ice for research and writing of "Inside
the Company," a book that sought to
expose CIA operations and agents.
Agee's magazine, CounterSpy, dedi-

cated to "exposing the CIA," was di
rectly responsible for the assassination
of Richard Welch, the Athens CIA
bureau chief, in 1975. Welch was
gunned down outside his home after
his identity and his residence appeared
in CounterSpy, and were then pub
lished in the Athens Daily News.
In 1979 Agee had his U.S. passport
revoked and was barred from many
NATO countries as a security risk.
Agee's activities also precipitated legis
lation that prohibits exposing U.S.
intelligence agents. Now, the Feds
seems to be acting with liberality by
not pressing any charges against Agee
as he tours the United States, exercis
ing free speech on a Nicaraguan pass
port.
It's doubtful that he could tour
Cuban or Nicaraguan university cam
puses criticizing their countries' intelli
gence agencies. Maybe the United
States is not so bad after all?
