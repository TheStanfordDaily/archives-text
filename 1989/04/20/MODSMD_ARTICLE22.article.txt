## Tresidder is the students' union 
### 
IN RESPONSE TO Burke Smith's
April 14 column entitled "Good
riddance, Marriot," I, too, want to
urge the Stanford community to "take
the initiative and make clear what
they want the new Tresidder to look
like." I also want to help clarify some
of his concerns.
First, I agree wholeheartedly with
Smith that because Tresidder is a
student union, "students should exer
cise the greatest influence in . . . deci-
regarding its future." Given this
and needed improvements, though, it
doesn't necessarily follow that there
needs to be not only change "in man
agement style, but also in the substan
tive organization of Tresidder."
Contrary to misperceptions, the
governing structure of Tresidder allows
for a great deal of student involvement.
Working closely with the director of
the union, the Tresidder Union Board
addresses policies governing the un
ion's purpose, image, facilities, services,
programs and activities. The majority
(five of the nine voting members) of
the union board are students
nominated by the Nominations Com
mission of the ASSU (the others are
two staff members and two faculty.)
Moreover, the union board also has
four standing committees: a program
advisory committee, a food committee,
a space and operations committee and
the Coffee House board. These commit
tees generate and discuss new ideas,
review proposals and work on various
union-related projects. Each of these
committees has a majority of students
as voting members.

In his article, Smith mentioned
numerous areas of needed improve
ments at Tresidder. For example, he
implied that the quality of food could
be improved by contracting some of
the services to "franchises of well
established restaurant chains." Al
though I personally agree with the end
of this suggestion, I tend to disagree
with his suggested means. What is
important though is not our individual
disagreement, but that both voices be
heard.
As you may have already noticed,
there has been a great deal of con
struction around Tresidder lately. With
the deck addition scheduled for comple
tion before the end of this month,
Tresidder will be able to expand its
services to the Stanford community.
As soon as the deck addition is
complete, LOTS-II (the computer
facilities) and the Computer Science
Department will move upstairs into the
new facilities. Of course this move will
free up the space in which they are
currently housed. The staff at Tresid
der has developed a plan as how to

best use this unclaimed space.
Some possible future changes and
renovations that the union board has
discussed include: a new pub with
Mexican food and a raucous evening
atmosphere; an expanded Coffee
House; a larger Store; a fresh ice
cream outlet; and more patio space. To
solicit community feedback, we have
scheduled a public forum to discuss the
upcoming changes at Tresidder.
The forum will be held Thursday,
April 27, from 4-5:30 p.m. It will-take
place in the Cypress Room, upstairs in
Tresidder. The format will include a
brief presentation on the planned and
possible future changes. Open to the
entire community, the forum will hope
fully afford those concerned an oppor
tunity to have themselves heard.
