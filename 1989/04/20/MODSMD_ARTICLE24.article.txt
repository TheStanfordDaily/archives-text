## A 						plastering in Pauley: Spikers blowout Bruins 
### John Kirks Staff writer 
"Now hold on just one minute."'
That's the statement the Stanford men's
volleyball team issued to the Western In
tercollegiate Volleyball Association's ex
perts who, before last night's match, had
projected that UCLA would run away with
the league's championship.

Men's Volleyball
Cardinal 3, Bruins 0

Last night, in a shocker, the Cardinal
conquered the seemingly invincible Bruins,
sweeping the No. 1 ranked team in the
country by scores of 15-7, 15-10, 15-6. In
so doing, Stanford plunged right back into
the hunt for the WIVA crown and the
accompanying automatic berth in the
NCAA's Final Four.
Scott Fortune offered his opinion on the
Cardinal's amazing turnaround.
"Up at Stanford, we really gave them
the first two games; the freshmen were
rattled a little by the UCLA mystique,"
Fortune said. "But, we came together and
really played them tough for the rest of
that match.
"Tonight, that strong play just carried
over. We entered this match with a lot of
confidence; we knew we could play with
these guys. Coach (Sturm) also had us
watch a lot of films, and that helped our
preparation for the match."
Indeed, the Cardinal looked like a team
possessed throughout the match. Stanford
raced to a huge lead in game one, dominat
ing every phase of the game en route to
a 14-3 advantage. If not for UCLA's Mike
Whitcomb's three straight aces at the end
of that game, the final score would not
have even been respectable for the Bruins.
The match was decided in game two.
UCLA had worked its way to a 10-6 ad
vantage over the Cardinal, but then Stan
ford shifted into precision mode.
Sturm's troops dug every Bruin swing
and then were able to capitalize on all of
their scoring opportunities. Stanford ran
off the next nine points in the game to
claim the victory; after that run, UCLA
was officially broken.
The third game was almost a joke. Bruin
coach A1 Scates put in players who had
not even traveled to the Farm for last
Saturday's match. UCLA's play was unin
spired and lethargic, and Stanford needed
no further encouragement to pummel its
hated rival.
(The Cardinal's clutch play was exhibited

by all six starters. Sturm seems to have
settled on a six-man squad with which he
is content. Hitter John AJstrom and middle
blocker Craig Forsyth have apparently se
cured spots in Sturm's lineup for the
season's duration.

The match was decided
in game two.

And, it looks as if the combination is
working. That particular lineup, which was
desperately thrown together by Sturm in
the third game of the Cardinal's loss to
UCLA at Maples, is now 5-1 (in games),
and those wins have come against the No.
1 ranked team in the nation.
Setter Parker Blackman and all five
members of his supporting cast produced
against UCLA. Three of Stanford's five hit
men, Duncan Blackman, Craig Forsyth,
and John Alstrom, hit for percentages in
excess of .500.
Fortune hit just under .300, compiling
20 kills to tie Alstrom for the game high
total, and Dan Hanan hit just under .350.
The most telling statistic for Stanford's
hitters, though, was UCLA's team block
total. The Bruins could only manage six
blocks for the match, well under the 33
they piled up at Maples. Stanford's hitters
obviously did their homework on the Bruin
blocking strategy.
The race between UCLA and Stanford,
which many thought would be decided by
the past week's head-to-head, two-match
series, could be decided by outside teams'
performances.
Stanford rounds out its current road trip
with a match at Loyola Marymount on
Friday night and then a bout with Pep
perdine on Saturday night; both of those
teams, incidentally, are playing sub-.500
volleyball in WIVA. UCLA, on the other
hand, has only one match remaining, a
clash with the USC Trojans at Pauley
Pavillion.
Assuming Stanford and UCLA win their
remaining games, a very intriguing battle
will result.
Yesterday, WIVA's officials overturned
the tiebreaking system that the league had
intended to employ in the case of a tie for
the league championship. Their decision:
Stanford would play UCLA in a one-match
playoff for the league title, and that match
would take place on either Monday or Tues
day of next week at Loyola Marymount,
the site of the NCAA regionals.

Middle Blocker Dan Hanan had 18 kills and 13 digs.

The race between UCLA and Stanford,
which many thought would be decided by
the past week's head-to-head, two-match
series, could be decided by outside teams'
performances.
Stanford rounds out its current road trip
with a match at Loyola Marymount on
Friday night and then a bout with Pep
perdine on Saturday night; both of those
teams, incidentally, are playing sub-.500
volleyball in WIVA. UCLA, on the other
hand, has only one match remaining, a
clash with the USC Trojans at Pauley
Pavillion.
Assuming Stanford and UCLA win their
remaining games, a very intriguing battle
will result.
Yesterday, WIVA's officials overturned
the tiebreaking system that the league had
intended to employ in the case of a tie for
the league championship. Their decision:
Stanford would play UCLA in a one-match
playoff for the league title, and that match
would take place on either Monday or Tues
day of next week at Loyola Marymount,
the site of the NCAA regionals.

Middle Blocker Dan Hanan had 18 kills and 13 digs.
"Now hold on just one minute."'
That's the statement the Stanford men's
volleyball team issued to the Western In
tercollegiate Volleyball Association's ex
perts who, before last night's match, had
projected that UCLA would run away with
the league's championship.

Men's Volleyball
Cardinal 3, Bruins 0

Last night, in a shocker, the Cardinal
conquered the seemingly invincible Bruins,
sweeping the No. 1 ranked team in the
country by scores of 15-7, 15-10, 15-6. In
so doing, Stanford plunged right back into
the hunt for the WIVA crown and the
accompanying automatic berth in the
NCAA's Final Four.
Scott Fortune offered his opinion on the
Cardinal's amazing turnaround.
"Up at Stanford, we really gave them
the first two games; the freshmen were
rattled a little by the UCLA mystique,"
Fortune said. "But, we came together and
really played them tough for the rest of
that match.
"Tonight, that strong play just carried
over. We entered this match with a lot of
confidence; we knew we could play with
these guys. Coach (Sturm) also had us
watch a lot of films, and that helped our
preparation for the match."
Indeed, the Cardinal looked like a team
possessed throughout the match. Stanford
raced to a huge lead in game one, dominat
ing every phase of the game en route to
a 14-3 advantage. If not for UCLA's Mike
Whitcomb's three straight aces at the end
of that game, the final score would not
have even been respectable for the Bruins.
The match was decided in game two.
UCLA had worked its way to a 10-6 ad
vantage over the Cardinal, but then Stan
ford shifted into precision mode.
Sturm's troops dug every Bruin swing
and then were able to capitalize on all of
their scoring opportunities. Stanford ran
off the next nine points in the game to
claim the victory; after that run, UCLA
was officially broken.
The third game was almost a joke. Bruin
coach A1 Scates put in players who had
not even traveled to the Farm for last
Saturday's match. UCLA's play was unin
spired and lethargic, and Stanford needed
no further encouragement to pummel its
hated rival.
(The Cardinal's clutch play was exhibited

by all six starters. Sturm seems to have
settled on a six-man squad with which he
is content. Hitter John AJstrom and middle
blocker Craig Forsyth have apparently se
cured spots in Sturm's lineup for the
season's duration.

The match was decided
in game two.

And, it looks as if the combination is
working. That particular lineup, which was
desperately thrown together by Sturm in
the third game of the Cardinal's loss to
UCLA at Maples, is now 5-1 (in games),
and those wins have come against the No.
1 ranked team in the nation.
Setter Parker Blackman and all five
members of his supporting cast produced
against UCLA. Three of Stanford's five hit
men, Duncan Blackman, Craig Forsyth,
and John Alstrom, hit for percentages in
excess of .500.
Fortune hit just under .300, compiling
20 kills to tie Alstrom for the game high
total, and Dan Hanan hit just under .350.
The most telling statistic for Stanford's
hitters, though, was UCLA's team block
total. The Bruins could only manage six
blocks for the match, well under the 33
they piled up at Maples. Stanford's hitters
obviously did their homework on the Bruin
blocking strategy.
The race between UCLA and Stanford,
which many thought would be decided by
the past week's head-to-head, two-match
series, could be decided by outside teams'
performances.
