# Stanford plays flawless game
## 
### Evan Tuchinsky Senior staff writer 
Before last night, the Pauley Pavilion record book
read as follows: UCLA 34, Stanford 0.
So much for a lifetime shutout.
For the first time in Stanford history, the Cardinal
managed to beat the Bruins on their own floor, in
front of their own fans, in the arena where the
squad has earned several of their numerous national
championships.
The visitors needed a perfect match, and that s
exactly what they got. Exceling at every aspect, the
Cardinal shut down the same hitters that scored
so freely last weekend while avoiding the dreaded,
domineering UCLA block.
But most significantly, Stanford played with un
paralleled confidence. UCLA eeked out a five-game
win at Stanford, yet the Cardinal showed no fear
as it began the Bruin dismantling early in game one.
Scott Fortune, a victim of several UCLA stuff
blocks Saturday, hit relentlessly at the UCLA front
line but met little interference as he found the
seams in the apparently-imperfect Bruin block, holes
that seemed elusive just five days earlier.
He was not alone. Dan Hanan had a character
istically potent hitting night, joined last night by
middle blocker Craig Forsyth and outside hitters
John Alstrom and Duncan Blackman. For the first
time this season, the Cardinal was productive at
every position.
But hitting is but a small part of the tale. There
is a saying that a good defense will beat a good
offense, and Stanford stunningly took this maxim
to heart.
At the net, the Cardinal blockers were unflap
pable, adjusting to the Bruins' offense rapidly and
creating an almost impenetrable wall. In the first
game alone, the squad recorded six blocks, half the
number Stanford tallied in the entire match last
weekend.
The backcourt followed suit, popping up dig after
dig after dig.
Only two UCLA hitters — Trevor Schirman and
Anthony Curci — seemed able to hit out of range
of the Stanford diggers on an intermittent basis;
the rest of the roster saw the visitors scramble and
scrap to get at every spike, with uncanny success.
For Stanford, everything that went wrong at
Maples miraculously went right at Pauley. The Bruin
mystique that has intimidated most of the nation
for most of the year no longer seems to bother the
Cardinal, which may well have established its own
intimidation edge.
After last night, there is little doubt as to which
is the top team in the nation this week. A tiebreaker
may be in the works to determine the Western
Intercollegiate Volleyball Association champ, but
nothing will erase the blemish the Cardinal has
placed on the UCLA record book
Stanford 1, UCLA 34. How sweet it is.
