# 'Musical-chairs' lineup result of disappointing year
## 
### 
Think back for a moment to the
1988 Cardinal football season. Re
member the problems Jason
Palumbis and Brian Johnson had at quar
terback? Remember how neither of them
knew who would start from week to
week? How a bad half or even a bad
series of downs might get them yanked
from the ballgame?
When a team is losing, this kind of
situation becomes inevitable. Stanford
football struggled to a 3-6-2 record.
A similar scenario is being played out
with the 1989 Cardinal baseball team.
After two national championships and a
preseason No. 1 ranking, Stanford's ex
pectations were in the stratosphere, but
the team has struggled to a 20-23 mark,
7-14 in the rugged Pacific 10 Conference
Southern Division.
In the Cardinal's 43 games this year,
the same lineup has been used three
times. Three times. 40 different lineups
thus far. The last 14 games have seen
— you guessed it — 14 different lineups.

Five different players have been used
in centerfield. Four in left field. Three
each at third and first. Two at shortstop
and catcher.
With this much switching going on,
there is little chance for any continuity
to develop. Individual players can't find
their groove and no one gets comfortable
playing with the same people.
"It's not like coming to the park, being
confident you're going to be in the lineup
and going out and playing that way. When

you know you can mess up plenty of
times and still be in there, you tend not
to mess up at all because you're so free
and playing very loose," outfielder Jack
Hollis said.
Hollis is a perfect example of the
merry-go-round that has been the Car
dinal lineup in 1989. The left-handed
hitting Hollis tore up USC pitching when
the Trojans visited Sunken Diamond
March 31-April 2.
Arizona State's starting staff is pre
dominantly left-handed, so Hollis saw
limited action against the Sun Devils the
following weekend. When the Cardinal
traveled to USC, he was back in the
starting lineup, and deservedly so. Hollis
went hitless in his first three at-bats and
was pulled from the opening game. He
did not start again, appearing as a pinch
hitter the rest of the weekend.
"It's to the point where if you're a
position player, I've got to get a hit this
at-bat or go 2-for-4 or tomorrow I won't
be in there," ace reliever Steve Chitren
said. "It's a proven fact that as anxiety

goes up, performance decreases. I'm sure
that's had some effect on the way we've
been playing this year."
"It's not a pressure from the coaches,"
Chitren added, "but a personal pressure
the guys put on themselves to perform,
because if they don't do it, they're going
to get dropped down a few levels and
have to work their way back up through
the season.
"1 can't fault [Stanford Coach Mark
Marquess] for what he's doing because
he's trying to put the guys out there
that are doing the best, but at the same
time the pressure level on each guy is
increased because they know if they don't
perform they'll be out of there. It's kind
of a Catch-22 the way it works right
now."
In recent weeks, some things have be
come more settled. Freshmen Roger Bur
nett and David Holbrook are set at
shortstop and third base. First base is
occupied by Brian Johnson or David
McCarty when Johnson is in the outfield.
One outfield position is still a zoo with

several players — Hollis among them —
competing for playing time.
But there are only nine games left on
the Six-Pac schedule. Time has run out
on searching for a lineup, yet with so
little time left, a player that fails to
produce on Friday must be replaced with
one who may on Saturday.
"I think it's definitely hard to get some
continuity when you have a different
lineup.
"What it boils down to is we haven't
performed the way we should. As a coach
you try and keep finding the lineup that
will work."
The Cardinal can afford only one or
two more losses in conference to stay in
the hunt for a regional bid. The two
previous championship Cardinal teams
basically ran the same eight guys out
there every day, with some shuffling at
designated hitter and occasionally at one
spot in the outfield last season. Stanford
has now fallen on hard times, and the
lineup has been as changeable as a
chameleon.
