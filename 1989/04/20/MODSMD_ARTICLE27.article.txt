# Athletes of the Week
## 
### 
Well, as you all know, it's pro-fro week
here of the Farm. Hundreds of high school
seniors are coming to Stanford, trying to
see if this is the place for them.
For any of the pro-fros here over the
weekend wondering how next year will treat
them, a pair of freshmen showed that being
a freshman isn't all bad. Yes, it's true. A

pair of frosh, sprinter Chryste (iaines and
golfer Christian Cevaer, have been selected
The Daily's Athletes of the Week.
Gaines, a freshman from Dallas, continued
her quest to prove she is the best sprinter
in Stanford history. At the Stanford Classic
Saturday, Gaines won the 100 and 200
meters and anchored the victorious 400-
meter relay team.
In the 100, Gaines recorded an 11.6, .04
seconds off her school record. In fact, Gaines
has broken the school record in the 100
three times already this year and has already
qualified for the Pacific 10 Conference
Championships, to be held at Stanford Sta
dium.
Gaines nearly added a third record to her
collection as she blazed through 200 meters
in 24.24 seconds, just short of the school
mark.

Cevaer, a freshman from Paris, led the
Cardinal linksters to a fourth-place finish
in the 18-team Cardinal Intercollegiate In
vitational at the Stanford Golf Course.
Cevaer shot a 214 for the 54 holes, leaving
him in a two-way tie for fourth.
Cevaer began well, carding a 71 and a 67
in the two rounds played Friday. Not only
was the 67 the second-lowest score of the
day, but also his 138 left him three shots
ahead of his nearest competitor.
In the final round, he shot a 76 to place

him fourth in the 98-golfer field, four swings
behind champion Randy Bridge of Fresno
State.
In the team competition, the Cardinal
trailed only USC, Fresno State and San Jose
State. Stanford finished ahead of Pac-10
rivals Washington, UCLA, Oregon, Califor
nia, Oregon State and Washington State.
