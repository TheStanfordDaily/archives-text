# Stanford basketball hires Ernie Kent as asst. coach
## 
### Jon Weisman Senior staff writer 
Ernie Kent has apparently
decided that if he can't beat 'em,
he'll join 'em.
Kent, formerly an assistant
coach at Colorado State, which
lost to the Stanford men's bas
ketball team 63-49 in the finals
of the Apple Invitational at Stan
ford last December, is joining the
Cardinal coaching staff for the
1989-90 season.
Kent, 34, replaces Barry Collier,
who took the head coaching job
at Butler University.
"We are pleased that Ernie has
joined our staff at Stanford,"
Stanford Coach Mike Mont
gomery said. "Ernie has extensive
coaching experience, and has
recruited successfully on the na
tional scene. We are delighted to
have a person of Ernie's abilities."
Kent and Stanford have the po
tential to do positive things for
each other. Before Kent arrived
at Colorado St.in 1987-88, the
Rams hadn't seen postseason ac
tion for 20 years. But that year,
Colorado St. went 22-13 and ad
vanced to the National Invitation
Tournament, and last season, the
Rams went 23-10, and defeated
Florida in a first-round NCAA
tournament match.

As for Stanford, it has devel
oped into a breeding ground for
NCAA head coaches. First Denny
Huston took the helm at Weber
State prior to last season, and
then Collier departed for Butler
this spring.
But for now, Kent is excited
about his new responsibilities on
the Farm.
"It's an honor to have the op
portunity to coach at Stanford,"
Kent said. "Stanford is a great
university, academically and ath
letically, and the basketball pro
gram is definitely in the top 20 "
