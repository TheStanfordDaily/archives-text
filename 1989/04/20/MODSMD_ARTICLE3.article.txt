# Patients give Cowell OK rating
## 
### Stacy Stern 
Cowell Health Center received
positive ratings overall from stu
dent survey results released last
week, although those surveyed
were disappointed with the food
served in the infirmary.
SHARE designed three different
surveys, concerning either
Cowell's infirmary, outpatient
treatment or after-hours care.
Students surveyed were randomly
selected from a listing of patients
from each facility. These students
evaluated the particular Cowell
service they visited.

One hundred copies of each sur
vey were distributed, and of the
300 students surveyed, 49 percent
responded.
Two years ago students re
sponded to the same survey with
complaints about infirmary
nurses' attitudes toward students.
Consequently, the health center
worked to improve this, and this
year's survey indicates nurses' at
titudes are no longer a problem.
The combined level of overall
satisfaction of the three groups
surveyed averaged 1.91 on a scale
from one to five, with one being
the best rating and five being the

worst. Respondents of the after
hours survey had the highest
overall level of satisfaction with
a mean of 1.73 and respondents
of the outpatient health survey
had the lowest at 2.18.
"We are happy with the
results," said Lou Shaw, the staff
advisor to the Student Health Ad
visory, Review and Education
committee. SHARE was organized
to provide better services for stu
dents and improve Cowell's image,
Shaw said.
Cowell business manager Jane
Meier said, "In general, the sur
veys were more positive than
negative, but there is always room
for improvement."
Level of privacy and friendliness
of practitioners received a favor
able rating by each group sur
veyed. Practitioners' friendliness
was rated under 1.8 in each case,
and over 90 percent of the respon
dents said they had enough
privacy.

The outpatient and after-hours
surveys also asked students about
the time they spent waiting for
care. Eighty percent of after-hours
patients spent less than 10
minutes waiting and over 70 per
cent of outpatients spent less than
20 minutes waiting.
Ratings of food in the infirmary
received the lowest rating. The
mean rating for the taste of the
foods was 3.1 and students rated
the perceived nutritional value at
2.7 on average. "Food is still a
problem," said Shaw, a registered
nurse at Cowell. "We need more
fresh fruits and vegetables."

According to Shaw the survey
was designed to get student feed
back about the service at Cowell
and to dispel negative misconcep
tions about the health center.
Shaw said she felt the survey proj
ect accomplished its goals.
The same survey was adminis
tered two years ago and Meier
said it helped Cowell to improve
its service. The last survey caused
"concern over the attitudes of the
infirmary nurses." As a result,
several meetings were held to give
nurses a better understanding of
student expectations, Meier con
tinued.
