# Patients give Cowell OK rating

### Stacy Stern 
Cowell Health Center received
positive ratings overall from stu
dent survey results released last
week, although those surveyed
were disappointed with the food
served in the infirmary.
SHARE designed three different
surveys, concerning either
Cowell's infirmary, outpatient
treatment or after-hours care.
Students surveyed were randomly
selected from a listing of patients
from each facility. These students
evaluated the particular Cowell
service they visited.

One hundred copies of each sur
vey were distributed, and of the
300 students surveyed, 49 percent
responded.
Two years ago students re
sponded to the same survey with
complaints about infirmary
nurses' attitudes toward students.
Consequently, the health center
worked to improve this, and this
year's survey indicates nurses' at
titudes are no longer a problem.
The combined level of overall
satisfaction of the three groups
surveyed averaged 1.91 on a scale
from one to five, with one being
the best rating and five being the

worst. Respondents of the after
hours survey had the highest
overall level of satisfaction with
a mean of 1.73 and respondents
of the outpatient health survey
had the lowest at 2.18.
"We are happy with the
results," said Lou Shaw, the staff
advisor to the Student Health Ad
visory, Review and Education
committee. SHARE was organized
to provide better services for stu
dents and improve Cowell's image,
Shaw said.
