THE STANFORD DAILY'S ENTERTAINING WEEKLY

Letters
I was beginning to enjoy the weekly "Intermission"
section of The Daily until I read last Thursday's edition.
I find it hard to believe that of all the great contemporary
music artists such as Tracy Chapman, S'nead O'Connor
and U2 we get to read about Madonna, the pop music
queen.
Consequently, we get articles by Alex Kostich em
phasizing the truly important qualities of an artist: the
physical appearance. Forget about originality, talent and
creativity, Kostich likes his rock starts "well-groomed
and good-looking." He praises Madonna for being sexy,
presentable and scenting her albums.
He then criticizes an artist like Tracy Chapman for
maintaining her ideological integrity (she claims to be
a Marxist) by not conforming to the pressure of wearing
a Donna Karan or Chanel evening gown at the Grammys.
Has it ever occured to Kostich that the way Tracy, Bono,
S'nead and Prince appear is an expression of their creative
originality as well as their disgust for the "well-groomed
and good-looking" conceptions that have been inculcated
in to the mass pop culture?
Kostich attempts to redeem himself by criticizing
"eMpTyV" and calling intellectual music videos a con
tradiction in terms, yet he writes an entire article on
Madonna's video which he considers to be the very first
intellectual video. Evidently, Kostich has only been
watching pop videos since many would consider Pink
Floyd and Artists Against Apartheid videos intellectual.
Music videos are not bad in themselves; only the su
perficial videos that emphasize physical appearance are
idiotic. Kostich should start writing for a fashion mag
azine, or he should stick to reviewing movies.
Gene Anaya embarks on a more worthwhile endeavor
as he looks at Madonna's lyrics and attempts to convice
the reader of their profound significance, but all he
manages to do is convine us of the self-centered, egotistic
nature of some of Madonna's music (i.e. Madonna sings
about her father, her family, her marriage — get the
picture?).
In the future please write about truly great artists that
will not insult the intelligence of your readers. Leave
pop stories to pop magazines like "People" and the
"Enquirer" and give us interesting reading on artists that
we will probably not read about in the American mass
media.

Letters policy
Intermission welcomes letters from its readers. Letters
are subject to editing and must include name, phone
number, Stanford affiliation and telltale birthmarks, if
any.
Letters are published on a spacc-availabe basis or when
we find one that is really silly. Intermission regrets that
it cannot return imprinted letters, although if you come
by the office they may very well be on the wall.
