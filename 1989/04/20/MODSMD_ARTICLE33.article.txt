# Queue up for 'A Chorus Line'
## 
### Mia Manzulli Staff writer 
Seventeen dancers. Eight parts.
And one white line running across
the stage. "A Chorus Line" tells
the absorbing story of a Broadway
audition where the dancers arc
asked not only to perform but to
put themselves literally on the line
and tell the director what makes
them tick.
From the huge opening number,
the director makes drastic cuts to
select his 17 contenders. Then,
those 17 must prove themselves
worthy of the final eight, as "A
Chorus Line" takes a very personal
look at the lives of Broadway dan
cers.
Ram's Head's production of the
Pulitzer Prize and Tony Award
winning "A Chorus Line" opens
tomorrow night at Memorial Au
ditorium after months of staging,
choreographing, rehearsals and
yes, auditions.
It all began back in January
when more than 110 students
auditioned for the 19 major roles,
dispelling rumors that there was
not enough talent on campus to
stage "A Chorus Line."
Because it is an ensemble piece
without a true "lead," the play re
quires all of the performers to be
equally talented singers, dancers
and actors. It can be difficult to
find enough triple threads to cast
such a piece.
"Many people felt that 'A
Chorus Line' couldn't be done ad

cquately by college students. I
want people to know that we were
very much aware of this when we
chose the play," said producer
Katie Kershner, a senior. She feels
that the Ram's Head cast is more
than adequately equipped to meet
the challenges presented by this
very ambitious production.
Cast member Cindy Clumeck,
a freshman who plays Judy, said,
"1 had my doubts at the start as
to whether we could do a show of
this caliber. But it's such an en
semble piece and everyone works
so well together."
One of the most appealing
aspects of "A Chorus Line" is that
it does showcase the talents of 19
people. Kershner likes the idea of
giving more people "a chance to
show off their ability."
One of the toughest tasks facing
the performers was learning to
dance in unison, which is what
"A Chorus Line" is all about. The
greatest challenge that the choreog
raphers faced was taking people
with very little dance training and
raising them to a level where they
understood what they were being
taught.
Unlike most traditional musi
cals "A Chorus Line" does not rely
on elaborate costumes or sets.
Other than mirrors and an art deco
drop, the stage and the taped-down
line arc the only "props" the dan
cers have. According to Lighting
Designer Keith Cross, the rest is
done with lights. The dancers arc
left to face the director and the

audience who gets to watch them
struggle through this demanding
audition.
Senior Jill Pixiey who plays
Sheila, an aging dancer, believes
that the show is true to life in its
portrayal of how people act when
something is at stake.
"A dancer, or anybody else, is
willing to do whatever they have
to do to get it . . . even spill their
guts."
The show's production crew has
put itself on the line by tackling
as ambitious a project as "A
Chorus Line." Because the motion
in the play is specially motivated,
there are lots of little things to
spotlight. The lighting in
Memorial Auditorium hasn't made
matters easier. Mem Aud had no
follow spots and very old equip
ment so Cross and the lighting
crew installed four spots, instead
of the normal two.
"We also replaced half the main
lights in the house so we could
light individuals. There were only
60 dimmers in Memorial Audito
rium, so we rigged up .1 new svs
tcm. We now have 72," Cross said.

the auditorium has tradition.ilK

always a priority.

"A Chorus Line" is all about. The
greatest challenge that the choreog
raphers faced was taking people
with very little dance training and
raising them to a level where they
understood what they were being
taught.
Unlike most traditional musi
cals "A Chorus Line" does not rely
on elaborate costumes or sets.
Other than mirrors and an art deco
drop, the stage and the taped-down
line arc the only "props" the dan
cers have. According to Lighting
Designer Keith Cross, the rest is
done with lights. The dancers arc
left to face the director and the

audience who gets to watch them
struggle through this demanding
audition.
Senior Jill Pixiey who plays
Sheila, an aging dancer, believes
that the show is true to life in its
portrayal of how people act when
something is at stake.
"A dancer, or anybody else, is
willing to do whatever they have
to do to get it . . . even spill their
guts."
The show's production crew has
put itself on the line by tackling
as ambitious a project as "A
Chorus Line." Because the motion
in the play is specially motivated,
there are lots of little things to
spotlight. The lighting in
Memorial Auditorium hasn't made
matters easier. Mem Aud had no
follow spots and very old equip
ment so Cross and the lighting
crew installed four spots, instead
of the normal two.
"We also replaced half the main
lights in the house so we could
light individuals. There were only
60 dimmers in Memorial Audito
rium, so we rigged up .1 new svs
tcm. We now have 72," Cross said.
In addition to lighting problems,
the auditorium has tradition.ilK
been plagued by poor acoustics
Kershner said Ram's Head has
doubled its sound budget Al
though she couldn't guarantee pt 1
feet acoustics, she said sound is
always a priority.

"A Chorus Line" plays April 21,
22 and April 27-29 <;f 8 p.m.
