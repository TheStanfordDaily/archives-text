# Bothered by pesky Z particles? Dr. Science to the rescue!
## 
### 
Hello, kids, and welcome once again to
"Ask Dr. Science," that semi-occasional
column where Dr. Science answers your
most pressing scientific questions This
week's column is sponsored by the Stan
ford Linear Accelerator Center, whose
motto is "Hey, you can't put that hamster
in the collider!"
Dear Dr. Science:
I don't quite understand how they dis
covered that Z particle. And how come
it's so important?
What a timely question. The Z particle
is important because it is theorized to be
one of the fundamental building blocks
of the universe. A pair of physicists doing
field work in Lower Mesopotamia recently
discovered the following manuscript,
chiseled in granite, which verifies this the
ory:
In the beginning God created the
heavens and the earth And He saw that
it was good.
On the second day God created the Z
particle. And He saw that it would he
pretty darned hard for scientists to find.
And He snickered.
On the third day God created three
French hens, two turtle doves and a Z
particle in a pear tree.

As you are probably aware, the universe
was orignally a barren emptiness devoid
of substance, much like Top-40 radio. All
that existed were lots of these Z particles
floating around, wandering recklessly to
and fro, accepting book royalties in lieu
of speaking fees. But soon the "Big Bang"
occurred, creating galaxies, planets,
Woltman Jack â€” the very matter which
makes up the known universe.
With all this other matter floating
around, Z particles became lealous and
went to hide inside atoms, joining other
quantum particles such as the quark, the
muon, the leprechaun and the pro-fro.
Now, millions and billions and godzil
lions of years later, scientists at SLAC
have discovered a process to coax the Z
particles out of atoms by smashing to
gether streams of electrons and klingons
accelerated in the Stanford Linear Collider.
As these atomic streams slam into each
other, excess Z particles arc released into
a detector thingy (scientific name: "detec
tor thingy").
According to SLAC Director Burton
Richter, scientists there intend to use the
data they get from the collider to calculate
the mass of the particle, as well as its
lifetime, gender, zodiacal sign and religion.

"I couldn't be more excited," said an
exuberant Richter, "Now we can try to
find particles A through Y."
Dear Dr. Science:
Does this new "Cold Fusion" really
work? If so, what hearing does it have
on niy life?
Does it work' Of course it works' And
it's so easy that it's hard to believe no
one discovered it before In fact, I was
able to generate enough energy to light
my house for a week using a glass of
Perrier and a piece of stainless steel.
For best results, however, you should
do cold fusion using "heavy water" and
palladium, which is prohibitively expen
sive because it costs a heap of money to
rent the Palladium.
The way cold fusion works is simple.
You take a hunk of metal such as pal
ladium and immerse it in "heavy water,"
which is water that contains atoms of
hydrogen known as "delirium." These hy
drogen atoms then bond with the metal,
creating "heavy metal," and forcing Z par
tides to be released.
Scientists, watching the experiment, see
Z particles being released and begin run
ning around like crazy, jumping about and

whooping with |oy. Ry putting the scien
tists on a treadmill, as much as four times
the original energy can he generated
As tor the hearing this has on yovir life,
remember that we often lose sight of the
applicability of scientific discoveries. For
example, the hydrogen bomb was origi
nally developed as a nasal decongestant.
Dear Or. Science:
VVhv arc American space travelers
called "Astronauts," but Soviet space

travelers callcd "Cosmonauts"?
"Cosmonaut" is derived from the Latin
root "Cosmo-" meaning "magazine em
phasizing cleavage," and "naut," meaning
"not." Thus, combining the two we get
"Not a magazine emphasizing cleavage.
And sure enough, Soviet space travelers
are not a magazine emphasizing cleavage
"Astronaut" contains the same root
"naut," but it is preceded by the root
"Astro-," meaning "The Jetsons' dog."
Prior to the "Jetsons" cartoon in the 60s,
American space travelers were referred to
as "Rin Tin Tinauts."
Dear Dr. Science:
A philosophical question: If a tree fails
in the forest, and nobody is there to
hear it, docs it make a sound? What if
a deer is there to hear it falls
To answer your questions
1) If there is nobody there to listen it
doesn't make a sound
2) If a deer is listening it still doesn't
make a sound Unless it falls on the deer,
in which case the deer makes a sound
which goes like this; "Gee Thumper isti t
this a marvelous day to be AAAC
CKKK'"
