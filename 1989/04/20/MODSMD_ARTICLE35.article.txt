# Palo Alto animation festival is outrageous

### Martha Brockenbrough Staff writer 
For everyone who just didn't get
enough at last Saturday's Exotic
Erotic Ball, check out "Outrageous
Animation" â€” a collection of 24
short animated films created by
artists from 13 different countries.
I he films share the distinction
of being too "Outrageous" to meet
the conservative standards of the
annual "Tournee," an interna
tional animation celebration. Cas
ting off the family-oriented garb
which traditionally clothes
animated films, producer Terry
Thoren wanted the adult films to
be shown in movie theaters be
cause audience reaction towards
them had been so positive.
Mere titillation, however, is not
the goal of "Outrageous Anima
tion." On the contrary, the show
constitutes an irreverent, and often
profound, depiction of human
foibles, despite the fact that each
film averages less than five
minutes in length.
"Instant Sex," for example,
depicts a lonely middle-aged man
who is addicted to the canned sex
that he buys at the supermarket.
When he is buried under a colossal
mound of cans, he learns the hard
way that "too much sex may be
harmful to your health."
"Rondino," a more serious Hun
garian -clip, portrays two guards
dismembering a prisoner. A cheery
tune accompanies the carnage,
achieving the same disturbing jux
taposition which "Singing in the
Rain" creates in "A Clockwork Or
ange."

"Outrageous Animation,"
though not a movie of the year,
shows what statements can be
made in only a few minutes. Not
many full-length features can

deliver what this collection does.
"Outrageous Animation" both
amuses and challenges us to
scrutinize "all that goes on behind
closed doors." It is definitely worth

seeing.

"Outrageous Animation " starts to
morrow at the Varsity Theater in
Palo Alto.
