# A 						murmur in French
## 
### Mia Manzulli Staff writer 
In 1970 Louis Malle wrote
"Murmurs of the Heart," a story
reminiscent of his early adoles
cence which captures the pain
and innocence of coming of age.
In the film, Malle explores a
very intense relationship be
tween a mother and her
youngest son that eventually be
comes incestual.
Although a critical success,
the moral implications
provoked considerable contro
versy when the film was first
released in France in 1971.
"Murmurs of the Heart" re
ceived only limited exposure in
the United States. Now, 18
years later, the poignant film
has been re-released both here
and in France for a new gener
ation who can enjoy the laughs
that temper the shocking nature
of the subject.
Laurent Chevalier (Benoit
Ferreux) is the 14-year-old son
of a French gynecologist and his
fun-loving Italian wife who live
in Dijon in 1954. As the
youngest of three sons,
Laurent's education, from jazz
and cigars to drinking and sex,
is provided by his two older
brothers. Marc (Daniel Gel in)

and Thomas (Fabien Ferreux)
arc devious troublemakers who
drink, pilfer from their parents
and do their best to initiate
young Laurent into the ways of
the world including bringing
him to their favorite brothel.
The most complex relation
ship of the film involves Laurent
and his beguiling mother Clara
(Lea Massari), an Italian im
migrant who indulges her sons,
especially her favorite Laurent.
When Laurent, who suffers
from a heart murmur, goes
away with his mother to a
health spa, the love between
them flourishes.
Laurent seems more the
jealous husband than a gawky
adolescent as he is forced to
grow up quickly in this envi
ronment. In what can only be
described as a beautiful but
sadly incestual mother-son love
affair, the sexual tension
heightens.
"Murmurs of the Heart" is a
finely directed and acted expres
sion of love that is beautiful to
watch although distressing to
think about.

"Murmurs of the Heart," in
French with English subtitles,
starts tomorrow at the Aquarius
Theater in Palo Alto.
