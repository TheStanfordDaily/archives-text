# Two Stanford seniors make debut in Palo Alto Players' 'The Wiz'
## 
### Mia Manzulli Staff writer 
A few months ago Tony Stovall
and Larry Shorter were merely
singers in Stanford's Everyday
People. All that has changed, how
ever, as Stovall and Shorter are
earning rave reviews for their
performances in"The Wiz," a
super-soul musical based on
Dorothy's escapades in Oz
The two Stanford students make
their acting debut with the Palo
Alto Players' production of "The
Wiz," (see review) the show whose
movie version featured Michael
Jackson.
Stovall. who plays the Lion, is
a singer with the a capella group
Everyday People. He saw a flier in
his dorm for "The Wiz" auditions
and decided to give it a try. Al
though he's an international rela
tions major here, Stovall says he
hopes to make acting his career.
Like Stovall, Shorter, who plays
the Tinman, sings with Everyday
People. Although he sings and has
taken some dance classes at Stan
ford, "The Wiz" marks the first
time he has been able to use all
talents in a single production.
Shorter is a communication major
and a theme associate in Casa
Zapata. He would like to become
involved in music production
when he graduates.
For Shorter, one of the most dif
ficult parts of acting in"The Wiz"
is getting a feel for the story and
getting to know his character. He
explains, "The four main charac

ters rely on each other a lot. It's
hard to act without being able to
relate to each other as friends.
We've gotten to know each other
more so we are able to bring our
personal experiences on stage
somewhat."
Although it has been fun for
Stovall and Shorter to work to
gether, Shorter says that one of the
most rewarding aspects of "The
Wiz" production has been "getting
to know people outside of Stanford.
You feel more in touch with the
everyday world. It gives you a dif
ferent perspective."
"The cast is fantastic and I really
look forward to rehearsals and
performances every day," adds
Stovall.
Director Dan Yurgaitis com
mented that Stovall and Shorter
are terrific guys and very hard
working. "We always heard about
Stanford where I'm from in the
Midwest and never knew anyone
from there. What a fantastic place
it must be if all the students are
like these guys. They are never
willing to settle for less than the
best. It's good for the younger cast
members to have them as role
models. I think it's fun for them
as well — to get away from
campus."
Yurgaitis is the newly chosen
artistic director for The Palo Alto
Players, and was chosen from
among 70 applicants for the job.
"The Wiz" marks his first show
with the company. According to
Yurgaitis, "The Wiz" has been a
challenging show to direct because

it "is from the '70s — an era where
everyone's consciousness was
being raised, the era of the black
musical. The story is so popular
and has been done in different
forms. It's upbeat and very '70s.
Wc needed to make it relevant to
the '80s."
He adds that "we know more
now. Our consciousness has been
raised and we need an unusual
approach. 1 like to think of the
shown as a true rainbow coalition
— (unlike the Broadway show] it's

a multi-racial production."
Yurgaitis says that he hopes
more Stanford students will get in
volved in community theater. The
Palo Alto Players are doing "La
Cage Aux Folles" for their first
show in September and they need
people.
Concludes Stovall, "Overall,
being in 'The Wiz' has been a great
experience. I would encourage
Stanford people to go down there
and get involved. The Palo Alto
Players are always looking for
people."

ford seniors, join Dorothy (Kym Renee Brown) and the Scarecrow
