# Follow the Yellow Brick Road toward a sexy and soulful 'Wiz'
## 
### Mia Manzulli Staff writer 
You all know the story of
Dorothy from Kansas who doesn't
listen to Aunty Em during a
cyclone and winds up in Oz as a
result of her foolishness. But do
you remember a gospel-singing
Scarecrow, a tap-dancing Tinman
and a rock-and-roll Lion?
Well, if you're in the mood for
the same basic story with some
energetic twists, go see the Palo
Alto Players' production of "The
Wiz," the Tony-award winning
musical based on the classic "The
Wizard of Oz."
Kym Renee Brown, who stars as
Dorothy, infuses her performance
with a lot of vigor and optimism.
Although her voice falters during
some of the singing numbers, her
personality and dancing ability
compensate. She begins her jour
ney in Kansas with her Aunt Em,
played by Beverly Brown. Brown,
who reappears later as the Good
Witch Glinda, has a lovely, sooth
ing voice.
Dorothy is not in Kansas for
long, however, and she soon finds
herself in Munchkinland. The
Munchkin outfits are wonderful as
are all the costumes and sets in
the show.
She is eventually joined by the
Scarecrow, played by Ron Kellum,
a lively and acrobatic addition to
the cast. Of the four leads, Kellum
puts in the best vocal performance.
The Scarecrow and Dorothy

soon meet up with the Tinman,
played by Stanford senior Larry
Shorter. Shorter does a good job
letting loose in his solo number,
"Slide Some Oil to Me."
Finally, the trio finds the Lion,
wonderfully acted by Stanford
senior Tony Stovall. Stovall has an
adorable personality as the
cowardly "King of the Jungle."
The group starts in search of
the Wiz as they "Ease on Down
the Road" — the Yellow Brick
Road, that is. Only in this case,
it's a bunch of yellow-clad dancers
who provide the path to the
Emerald City.
A fine performance is given by
Nile Garner as "Evillene," the
Wicked Witch of the West. She
belts out a show-stopping "No Bad
News" in her rich, throaty voice
to open Act Two. The best visual
effect of the show occurs when
Evillene is inadvertently doused
with water by Dorothy. Robert
Keefe, as The Wiz, sings a very
pleasing rendition of "Believe in
Yourself," the song which offers
the moral of the story.
"The Wiz," like the timeless
classic "The Wizard of Oz, " is a
musical that appeals to all ages.
The Palo Alto Players, directed by
Dan Yurgaitis, do a nice job put
ting on this fun, upbeat show.

"The Wiz" plays through May 6
at the Lucie Stern Theater. 1305
Middlefield Rd., Palo Alto. Tickets
are available at the CAPA box of
fice by calling 329-2623 or 329-
2652.
