# COP race remains up for grabs
## 
### Baldwin Lee Staff writer 
With 85 percent of the votes in
at 11 p.m. last night, the Council
of Presidents race was still up in
the air and will likely be deter
mined by a runoff next week.
Capturing 46.5 percent of the
vote, the Slate of the Times led
over Students' Choice, according
to preliminary results. Students'
Choice came in with 36.2 percent
of the vote while the Chapparal
backed Hammer and Coffin slate
slid in at third with 14.3 percent
of the vote — enough to keep
Slate of the Times from attaining
the 50 percent majority needed to
win.
A runoff election is required if
no slate receives 50 percent or
more of votes cast.
In accordance with ASSU By-
Laws, a COP runoff would take

place next Tuesday and Wednes
day.
These dates are contingent on
the release of unofficial final
results within 48 hours after the
closing of the last poll site.
With the last poll closing at 11
p.m., ASSU Election Commis
sioner Steve Krauss tallied 96 per
cent of the vote by one o'clock
this morning. Krauss planned to
have 100 percent of the vote un
officially tabulated early today.
Krauss said he was uncertain
how a COP runoff would actually
work.
Slate of the Times is endorsed
by the People's Platform while
Students' First backed Students'
Choice.
The preliminary results also
showed a People's Platform party
sweep of the ASSU Senate.
People's Platform candidates
dominated the undergraduate
senate race, as the eight top vote

getters were endorsed by the
party. Forty-three candidates ran
for 20 senate seats, only 10 senate
seats actually have voting power.
In a close senior class presidents
race, the leader, A Kinder, Gentler
Slate, held a 4.1 percent edge over
Slate of the Nineties. The
Metamorphic Slate was in a dis
tant third. As with the COP race,
the senior class presidents race is
bound for a runoff that should
take place next Wednesday.
Three student groups seeking
special fees were on the road for
rejection: ASSU Course Guide,
the Chaparral and the Stanford
Axe Committee.
Representatives from the
Course Guide and Chaparral said
they were not particularly
suprised about their defeat. But
Axe Committee Chair Patrick
Broun said he had felt confident
about getting the money and that
a rejection would be devastating

for his group.
However, all three groups said
they were prepared to try alter
native funding strategies.
The Student Conduct Legisla
tive Council race showed Leonard
Adler and Perry Friedman in the
lead for the three available seats,
with the third seat closely con
tested.
Students voted against any in
crease in the the three General
Fees — for the Program Board,
Publications Board and Commu
nity Service Fund.
The ASSU Constitutional
amendment that intended to
revise the appropriations process
for General Fees fell well below
the two-thirds majority needed to
pass.
Rather than computer voting,
the COP runoff and the senior
class president race will be by
paper ballot.
