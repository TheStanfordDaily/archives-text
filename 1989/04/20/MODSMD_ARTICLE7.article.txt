# State officials peruse Stanford polls

Not only students lined up at the ASSU
polling stations this week.
State and county officials watched as stu
dents put to the test the first computerized
election in the state, a process designed by
two Stanford sophomores.
Several polling stations were visited Tues
day and Wednesday by John Mott-Smith, co
ordinator of the voter outreach program for
the California secretary of state, George
Mann, registrar of voters for Santa Clara
County and Warren Slocum, county clerk
recorder for San Mateo County.
Slocum, who called the new voting process
"a matter of curiosity" in his professional

area, said he is not interested in the project
solely in terms of computerized voting, but
in terms of "electronic democracy."
"Imagine having computers available to the
electoral body to get people involved in making
decisions, like on a zoning issue," he added.
Slocum said he is looking for ways to make
local government more accessible to commu
nities, so that people need not "go to a county
building on Monday through Friday from nine
to five."
"This approach takes us one step closer,"
he said.
Mott-Smith, however, said he came to ob
serve the election with an interest for future
implementation on a state level.
"We were very impressed the University
would even tackle such a project. They had

the election under control and running
smoothly," he added.
While Mott-Smith admired Stanford's com
puterized election, he said he does not see
the high-tech process in the near future of
statewide elections due to security and public
mistrust of computers.
"Right now a physical audit trail is left
behind in an election. In a sense, we can
recreate the election. A computer is a black
box between the voter and the ballot. The
voter and public have to trust the programmer
and program. That security is very important
to the integrity of an election and to the
public's perception of the election," Mott-
Smith said.
"Presumably, if someone were
maliciously inclined, they could al
ter the election in a sophisticated
way. This security is important,"
he added.
Mann agreed that Stanford's
system could not be used as is on
a large scale for a variety of
reasons.
He explained that Santa Clara's
ballot is five to six times longer
than the ASSU's, which could
push voting time up to half an
hour for each individual, consid
ering the estimated three to five
minutes per voter in the ASSU

The expense for the great num
ber of computers needed to con
duct a large election would be an
other drawback. In addition,
Santa Clara County uses a much
greater number of different bal
lots. In the November election,
the county used 199 ballots in
comparison to the five used in
Stanford's election.
Mann said, however, that he did
like the concept and could see it
being used in elections with
shorter ballots and fewer voters,
such as union elections.
"Computerized voting is on the
horizon," he said, adding that
computers designed to be used as
voting machines are being devel

oped on the East Coast.
Elections Commissioner Steve
Krauss — who originated and
helped implement the computer
ized elections — said that he and
sophomore Sandy Aronson,
creator of the program being used,
are considering improving the
program to make it more flexible,
possibly for use at other univer
sities.
As for the attention the system
and its creators are receiving,
Krauss said, "Until a couple
months ago, we weren't aware it
would have significance for
anyone off campus. I love [the
attention]. I've never had any
thing like this happen to me
before."
