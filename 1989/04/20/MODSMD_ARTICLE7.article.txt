# State officials peruse Stanford polls

Not only students lined up at the ASSU
polling stations this week.
State and county officials watched as stu
dents put to the test the first computerized
election in the state, a process designed by
two Stanford sophomores.
Several polling stations were visited Tues
day and Wednesday by John Mott-Smith, co
ordinator of the voter outreach program for
the California secretary of state, George
Mann, registrar of voters for Santa Clara
County and Warren Slocum, county clerk
recorder for San Mateo County.
Slocum, who called the new voting process
"a matter of curiosity" in his professional

area, said he is not interested in the project
solely in terms of computerized voting, but
in terms of "electronic democracy."
"Imagine having computers available to the
electoral body to get people involved in making
decisions, like on a zoning issue," he added.
Slocum said he is looking for ways to make
local government more accessible to commu
nities, so that people need not "go to a county
building on Monday through Friday from nine
to five."
"This approach takes us one step closer,"
he said.
Mott-Smith, however, said he came to ob
serve the election with an interest for future
implementation on a state level.
"We were very impressed the University
would even tackle such a project. They had

the election under control and running
smoothly," he added.
While Mott-Smith admired Stanford's com
puterized election, he said he does not see
the high-tech process in the near future of
statewide elections due to security and public
mistrust of computers.
"Right now a physical audit trail is left
behind in an election. In a sense, we can
recreate the election. A computer is a black
box between the voter and the ballot. The
voter and public have to trust the programmer
and program. That security is very important
to the integrity of an election and to the
public's perception of the election," Mott-
Smith said.
