# Students rank free speech above Standard in poll

### Suzanne Corkins 
A majority of randomly sur
veyed Stanford students said they
believe that Stanford should ad
here to the Constitution's defini
tion of free speech rather than
set its own standard, according to
the latest ASSU Straw Poll.
Of the 125 randomly selected
respondents, 58.4 percent were
undergraduates and 41.6 percent
were graduate students.
Student opinions regarding the
balance between upholding First
Amendment rights and preventing
racism varied more widely, with
about half regarding the Univer
sity's actions as adequately
balanced.
Respectively, 46.6 percent and
51.9 percent of undergraduates
and graduates feel that University
responses to racism have ade
quately emphasized the First
Amendment, while 23.3 percent
and 11.5 percent feel that it has
been underemphasized, and 28.8
percent and 26.9 percent consider
it overemphasized.
George Parker, chair of the Stu
dent Conduct legislative Council

and a Business School professor,
concurred with the largest per
centage of students. "I would cast
my vote with the 'adequate' re
sponse. The University has been
pretty careful not to over- or un
deremphasize the First Amend
ment
Asked to "rate the University's
commitment to establishing four
years of guaranteed student
housing on a scale of one to five
(with one being the weakest com
mitment and five being the
strongest)," undergraduates were
critical, with 47.9 percent giving
Stanford a two and 20.5 percent
granting a three.
Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons said of this result, "It is a
fairly accurate reading of Univer
sity [financial] commitment."
Lyons cited the failure to attract
Centennial Campaign donations
for housing as well as the $6 mil
lion bill for the renovation of
Roble Hall as reasons for the lack
of commitment.
Lyons noted, however, that
Stanford is "really quite close to
a guaranteed housing system," an
observation confirmed by Director

of Student Housing Rodger Whit
ney. Whitney noted that last fall
quarter, all undergraduates who
had agreed to accept any on
campus assignment were accom
modated.
With the opening of the Rains
Apartments, spaces have become
available to undergraduates in
residences which previously
housed mostly graduate students.
With those spaces and the reopen
ing of Roble Hall, Whitney pre
dicted that "by September we will
have, de facto, accomplished what
a guaranteed housing system is
meant to accomplish."
In response to the question, "Do
you think the University has a
plan to phase out housed frater
nities on campus?" student
opinions were divided. Among un
dergraduates, 39.7 percent of re
spondents answered "yes," 34.2
percent said "no," and 26 percent
expressed no opinion.
Commenting on this result,
Fraternal Affairs Adviser Joe
Pisano stated, "There is no effort
to phase out housed fraternities
on this campus."
