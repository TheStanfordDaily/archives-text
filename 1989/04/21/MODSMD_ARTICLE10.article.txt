# New transformer puts air conditioning on hold

Pray for mild temperatures
tomorrow.
The campus chilled water
system used for air condition
ing campus buildings and
cooling laboratory and com
puter equipment will be shut
down from 5 a.m. to 1 p.m.
tomorrow to allow University
workers to "cut in"and ener
gize a new electrical trans
former, according to University
Operations Manager Stephen
Parr.
Student residences, the Med
ical Center and Forsythe Hall,
a computer center, will not be
affected by the shut down.
Temporary systems will be set
up for laboratories that cannot
operate without chilled water.
Parr said he had already seen
two requests for temporary
chilled water systems for

campus laboratories.
The new higher-wattage
transformer comes just in time
for summer. So far this year
the campus chilled water sys
tem has been operating on tem
porary units inadequate to
handle the demand for air con
ditioning when the weather
heats up.
Water is chilled at a central
plant and distributed to more
than 80 buildings on campus.
The chilled water is pumped
into heat exchangers used to
cool recirculating air. When the
air is cooled and the water is
heated, the cool air is blown
back into the building (or lab
equipment), and the warm
water is pumped back to the
central plant.
Tomorrow's work will com
plete efforts begun April 1 to
install the new transformer. No
additional shut downs are an
ticipated, Parr said.
