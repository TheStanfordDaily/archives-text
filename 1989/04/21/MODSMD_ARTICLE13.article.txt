## Jury begins deliberation in North trial Judge reminds jurors that not even the president can order anyone to break the law 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — The jury in Oliver
North's Iran-Contra trial was dispatched yes
terday to decide the guilt or innocence of the
former White House aide with the judge's
admonition that no one, including the presi
dent, had "the legal authority to order anyone
to violate the law."
North has said he had authority from su
periors including, he believed, President
Reagan, for many of his actions in behalf of
the Nicaraguan rebels at a time when official
U.S. aid was banned.
Because of the lateness of the hour, jurors
were sent to the nearby hotel where they will
be sequestered, with orders to begin delibera
tions today.
U.S. District Judge Gerhard Gesell told
them "your job is to decide the facts" in the
first trial stemming from the mid-1980s affair
in which profits from arms sales to Iran were
diverted to aid the Nicaraguan rebels.
The judge was specific in his instruction
about North's contention that he acted under
orders from top White House officials and,
he assumed, with Reagan's approval.
"Neither the president nor any of the de
fendant's superiors had the legal authority to
order anyone to violate the law," Gesell said.
"You have heard testimony indicating that
other government officials may in some
respects have concealed facts known to them,
and some ranking above or below the defend
ant may have engaged in conduct similar to
that charged against the defendant on trial."
But, he said, the conduct of others was no
justification and "you are not to judge the
defendant's guilt or innocence based solely on
the actions of others."

The judge's charge was delayed for a half
day by a problem involving jurors who may
have given misleading answers in pre-trial
questioning. When he convened court in the
afternoon, Gesell said he had denied a North
motion for a mistrial, filed on grounds that
"the jury had been infected by publicity about
some of its members."
The five alternates were dismissed after
Gesell gave the instructions.
Gesell said North's defense that he was
authorized to cover up his secret Contra role
may be considered, but under closely defined
circumstances.
"Authorization requires clear, direct in
struction to act at a given time in a given
way," he said. "It must be specific, not simply
a general admonition or vague expression of
preference. It must be sufficiently precise."
The most attentive person in the courtroom
as Gesell read his long instructions appeared
to be North, whose eyes seldom left the judge.
Occasionally, the 47 year-old defendant would
make a note on a legal pad, writing with his
left hand.
North's wife and mother had been in the
courtroom for much of the morning's long
wait, but they did not return in the afternoon
until the instructions had been read.
Six of the charges involve withholding in
formation from Congress when it sought to
find out about North's and the National Se
curity Council's role in supplying aid to the
Contras.
Conviction on each of those counts carries
a maximum penalty of five years in prison.
Each of the 12 counts has a $250,000 penalty,
for a maximum of $3 million.

North also is charged with obstructing a
presidential inquiry, making false statements
when he was questioned by Attorney General
Edwin Meese 111, and conspiring to defraud
the United States through illegal use of a
tax-exempt foundation. Each of those counts
carries a 5-year penalty.

You are not to judge the de
fendant's guilt or innocence
based solely on the actions of
others.'

One count of altering, destroying and con
cealing documents is punishable by three years
in prison; another, of accepting an illegal
gratuity — a $13,800 security system — is
punishable by two years. The remaining count,
converting traveler's checks to his personal
use carries a 10-year maximum sentence.
If convicted of all counts, North could be
sentenced to a maximum of 60 years in prison,
but federal court practice is to limit sentences
to the longest on a single count — in this
case 10 years. Jurors also have the option of
convicting North of aiding and abetting in a
crime rather than as the principal in seven
of the charges. The penalty would be the same
as for conviction of the full charge.
Gesell had scheduled final instructions to
the jury in the morning, but instead remained
in his chambers, apparently requestioning
some or all of the jurors and alternates.

U.S. District Judge Gerhard Gesell told
them "your job is to decide the facts" in the
first trial stemming from the mid-1980s affair
in which profits from arms sales to Iran were
diverted to aid the Nicaraguan rebels.
The judge was specific in his instruction
about North's contention that he acted under
orders from top White House officials and,
he assumed, with Reagan's approval.
"Neither the president nor any of the de
fendant's superiors had the legal authority to
order anyone to violate the law," Gesell said.
"You have heard testimony indicating that
other government officials may in some
respects have concealed facts known to them,
and some ranking above or below the defend
ant may have engaged in conduct similar to
that charged against the defendant on trial."
But, he said, the conduct of others was no
justification and "you are not to judge the
defendant's guilt or innocence based solely on
the actions of others."

The judge's charge was delayed for a half
day by a problem involving jurors who may
have given misleading answers in pre-trial
questioning. When he convened court in the
afternoon, Gesell said he had denied a North
motion for a mistrial, filed on grounds that
"the jury had been infected by publicity about
some of its members."
The five alternates were dismissed after
Gesell gave the instructions.
Gesell said North's defense that he was
authorized to cover up his secret Contra role
may be considered, but under closely defined
circumstances.
"Authorization requires clear, direct in
struction to act at a given time in a given
way," he said. "It must be specific, not simply
a general admonition or vague expression of
preference. It must be sufficiently precise."
The most attentive person in the courtroom
as Gesell read his long instructions appeared
to be North, whose eyes seldom left the judge.
Occasionally, the 47 year-old defendant would
make a note on a legal pad, writing with his
left hand.
North's wife and mother had been in the
courtroom for much of the morning's long
wait, but they did not return in the afternoon
until the instructions had been read.
Six of the charges involve withholding in
formation from Congress when it sought to
find out about North's and the National Se
curity Council's role in supplying aid to the
Contras.
Conviction on each of those counts carries
a maximum penalty of five years in prison.
Each of the 12 counts has a $250,000 penalty,
for a maximum of $3 million.

North also is charged with obstructing a
presidential inquiry, making false statements
when he was questioned by Attorney General
Edwin Meese 111, and conspiring to defraud
the United States through illegal use of a
tax-exempt foundation. Each of those counts
carries a 5-year penalty.

You are not to judge the de
fendant's guilt or innocence
based solely on the actions of
others.'

One count of altering, destroying and con
cealing documents is punishable by three years
in prison; another, of accepting an illegal
gratuity — a $13,800 security system — is
punishable by two years. The remaining count,
converting traveler's checks to his personal
use carries a 10-year maximum sentence.
If convicted of all counts, North could be
sentenced to a maximum of 60 years in prison,
but federal court practice is to limit sentences
to the longest on a single count — in this
case 10 years. Jurors also have the option of
convicting North of aiding and abetting in a
crime rather than as the principal in seven
of the charges. The penalty would be the same
as for conviction of the full charge.
Gesell had scheduled final instructions to
the jury in the morning, but instead remained
in his chambers, apparently requestioning
some or all of the jurors and alternates.
