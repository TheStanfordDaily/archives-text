# Navy organizes Iowa inquiry
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - The
bodies of 47 sailors killed in
the gun explosion on the lowa
arrived in the United States
yesterday as the Navy tried to
figure out what caused the bat
tleship's turret to blow up.
None of the guns in the No.
2 turret had been fired before
the explosion killed the
seamen, Navy officials said.
They discarded a theory that
the blast had been sparked by
red-hot debris left in the gun's
breech by earlier rounds.
The Navy organized a board
of inquiry and placed a
moratorium on firing 16-inch
guns, found only on the lowa
and its three sister battleships,
the New Jersey, the Wisconsin
and the Missouri.
The lowa was headed back
to its home port at Norfolk,
Va., while the bodies of the
dead were flown to the military
mortuary at Dover Air Force
Base in Delaware and families
of the battleship's 1,600 crew
men waited to learn whether
their relatives were among the
dead.
At the White House, Chief

of Staff John Sununu an
nounced President Bush will
attend a memorial service Mon
day for the victims in Norfolk.
He said the president had heard
of the service and told his staff
"if it could be fitted in, he
wanted to be there."
The blast occurred Wednes
day morning northeast of
Puerto Rico as the lowa took
part in firing exercises that
were part of naval training.
A spokesman for the Atlantic
Fleet and the ship's former
captain both said the explosion
in the No. 2 turret could have
been triggered by red-hot debris
from earlier firings in the
three-gun turret.
But Cmdr. Mark Baker, chief
of the Navy's Pentagon press
office, said later that none of
the turret's three guns had
been fired.
Only four rounds of 22
scheduled to be fired as part
of a training exercise had been
fired, he said, and all had been
from the No. 1 turret, forward
of the one that exploded.
No eyewitnesses survived
