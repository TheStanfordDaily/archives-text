## 
### 
UNITED NATIONS (AP)
The General Assembly con
demned Israel yesterday for al
leged human rights abuses and
demanded it halt excessive gun
fire and restrictions on worship
in the occupied West Bank and
Gaza Strip.
The vote was 129-2, with one
abstention in the 159-member as
sembly.
The United States and Israel
voted against the non-binding res
olution, and Liberia abstained.
Other nations were absent.
The assembly resolution,
backed by Arab, non-aligned and
socialist nations, also demands
that Israel immediately halt its
crackdown and punishment of
those participating in the 16-
month-old Palestinian uprising in
the territories.
It was the latest in frequent
U.N. condemnations of Israel and
its policies. U.S. Ambassador
Thomas Pickering described the
resolution as "confrontational,"
and a Israeli diplomat called the
vote hypocritical.
Pickering said it "does not im-

rights.

prove the situation on the ground
or advance the prospects for peace
in the region."
He said the United States seeks
a comprehensive negotiated
settlement that would provide for
an exchange of territory for peace,
the security of all states and the
legitimate political rights of the
Palestinian people.
The U.S. envoy said the status
quo in the occupied territories is
"untenable" and called the April
13 deaths of four Palestinians by
Israeli gunfire in the West Rank
town of Nahalin "a particularly
serious tragedy."
Israeli envoy Jeremy Nissim Is
sacharoff, first secretary at his
mission, denounced the "immense
hypocrisy" by Arab nations such

as Iraq, Saudi Arabia and Syria
to condemn Israel.
He said the Saudi government
does not permit religious freedom
and slaughtered Iranian worship
pers in Mecca several years ago.
Iraq has killed thousands of its
own Kurdish people, and Syria
has murdered Lebanese, he said,
yet both nations lecture Israel
about the evils of occupation and
violations of human rights.
The resolution expresses "pro
found shock" at the Israeli killings
in Nahalin and cited restrictions
on attendance at Moslem mosques
during the holy period of
Ramadan as a violation of Pales
tinian rights to worship.
The resolution demands that Is
rael immediately halt its viola
tions of the convention and re
spect all Palestinian rights.
The territories, home to 1 7 mil
lion Palestinians, were seized by
Israel from Egypt and Jordan in
the 1967 Middle East War.
At least 439 Palestinians have
been killed since the December
1987 start of the uprising, most
by army gunfire.
