### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - The State De
partment, acting under court decisions ban
ning sex discrimination, is revamping its
entrance exam and informing about 600
female Foreign Service officers they may
be entitled to new jobs, it was disclosed
yesterday.
State Department spokesman Richard
Boucher, discussing the agency's response
to a suit that dates back 13 years, said
Secretary of State James Baker 111 "is
firmly committed to ensuring that there
be no discrimination in the Department of
State of any kind. If past policies have
contradicted this position, they must and
will be changed."
Boucher told reporters that the depart
ment sent cables to U.S. embassies around
the world and planned to inform employees
of a U.S. District Court ruling that the
department has discriminated against
women in the Foreign Service dating back
to 1976.
The spokesman said the notification was
sent to comply with a court order issued
Jan. 31 and outlines remedies to be pro
vided.
They include, he said, "ensuring that
there is no discrimination against women
in the future regarding assignments, per
formance evaluation, occupational special
ties, and superior honor awards."

He added that the department is revamp
ing its entrance exam for Foreign Service
officers because of a separate court order
"finding that the written exam has ad
versely affected women. We've decided that
that must change, and it will change."
The actions stem from a suit filed in
1976 by Alison Palmer, a now-retired
Foreign Service officer who claimed the
department discriminated against women
in hiring and promotion, said Palmer's at
torney, Monica Wagner.
The suit alleged the department discrim
inated against women by hiring more men,
giving men the better career assignments
and more career-advancing performance
ratings and honor awards.
Under the order, a woman is eligible for
relief if she can show that she sought or
"would have sought, absent discrimination"
any of the department's better assignments.
If cases of discrimination are found, the
court order requires the department to al
low women to transfer to other job areas,
be offered other assignments and raise their
performance ratings.
Wagner said her client will not be a direct
beneficiary of the court order because she
has retired. Only those women who are
part of the class-action suit and are still
working for the Foreign Service are af
fected.
