Chinese state warns protestors
BEIJING i AP» — About 1,500 students braved
a daylong downpour and marched for democracy
in the capital yesterday, and authorities threat
ened "harsh measures" to crush four days of
dissent.
About 1,000 students marched in the central
Chinese city of Nanjing, and students in Tianjin,
a port city east of Beijing, plastered posters on
walls. Other marches were also reported in Shan
ghai, Wuhan and Hefei, but details were sketchy.
Nationally televised news led with a stern warn
ing that the protests, the biggest since the pro
democracy demonstrations of 1986-87, would no
longer be tolerated.
"These activities have gone beyond the limits
of the.law and the taking of harsh measures to
end the disturbances has become necessary," the
announcer said, quoting from an editorial by the
official Xinhua News Agency.
"These protesters do not really care about the
future or happiness of China, all they want to
do is overthrow the Communist Party and the
government," the editorial said.
The protests were prompted by the death Sat
urday of Hu Yaobang, an outspoken reformer
who was ousted as Communist Party chief in
1987 Hu was accused of encouraging liberal ideas

and failing to crack down on the 1986-87 student
demonstrators.
The Beijing city government issued regulations
that restricted commemoration activities for Hu
to inside universities, businesses and factories.
Nazi gathering at Hitler birthsite
BRAUNAU, Austria (AP) — Riot troops ringed
the house where Adolf Hitler was born and police
said they arrested eight people yesterday for
marking the 100 th anniversary of the dictator's
birth with Nazi slogans and stiff-armed salutes.
Hundreds of police swarmed this city of 17,000
people to prevent a repeat of the 1979 clashes
between neo-Nazis and leftists that marked Hit
ler's 90th birthday. No serious incidents were
reported.
Across the border in West Germany, foreigners
closed their stores and kept children out of schools
because of fears of neo-Nazi violence. Several
members of anti-Nazi vigilante groups were ar
rested for carrying weapons.
Security was heaviest here, at the two-story
yellow house where Hitler was born on April 20,
1889. The house, a former inn now used as a
day-care center for handicapped children, was
sealed off with metal barriers manned by dozens
of police and special riot squads with dogs.
