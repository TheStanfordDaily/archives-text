# Three races to be determined in runoff
## 
### Jonathan Eisenberg Staff writer 
The winners of the Council of Presi
dents and Senior Class Presidents races
will be decided in a runoff, and the
Student Conduct Legislative Council
race may also be rerun, in paper ballot
elections to be held two weeks from
this week's ASSU Elections.
Elections Commissioner Steve
Krauss said that all 6,229 computer
ballots had been tallied by yesterday
morning. But because 50 votes from
the Law School poll site were er
roneously recorded on paper absentee
ballots, the total does not represent
the "preliminary tally," the entire
campus vote.
According to ASSU Bylaws, the tally
must be released within 48 hours after
the polls close in order for the runoff
to be held one week after the election.
Since the commission did not count
the Law School ballots, the runoff will
be held in two weeks.
The results from the SCLC race may
be scrapped completely because the
top two vote-getters may not be eligible
candidates. Canetta Ivy withdrew from
the race but her name still appeared
on the ballot, and Leonard Adler may
not be a Stanford student next year
pending his admission to the Stanford
Law School. At its bi-weekly meeting
yesterday, the ASSU Senate considered
holding a new election, but did not
vote on the issue.
Although the five-member Elections
Commission plans to hand count the
anticipated 4,000 votes from the runoff
and possible SCLC elections, they do
not plan to tally the 50 paper ballots
from the Law School before the dead
line. Krauss said the final numbers
will not be released until Monday.
The results of most of the absentee
ballots raised the total to about 6,500
votes in Krauss' estimation.
This figure will be an all-time high
turnout for ASSU elections, far sur
passing last year's record of 5,242
tallies.
Krauss attributed the "amazing"
voter turnout to the publicity over the

computerized election, a first in Cali
fornia.
The Elections Commission members
planned to meet "in a day or two" to
hammer out a plan for administering
the runoff election, but said they
would follow ASSU Bylaws explicitly.
According to the bylaws, all stu
dents, regardless of whether they voted
in the general election, will be allowed
to cast their ballots for Council of
Presidents and all students with junior
class standing will be allowed to vote
for Senior Class Presidents.
In order to vote, Krauss said stu
dents would probably be required to
show current Stanford identification
but not the election receipt.
Krauss guessed that the turnout for
the paper ballot runoff will be "drasti
cally lower" — about 4,000 voters —
primarily because students do not have
to vote again to be eligible for ASSU
fee refunds.
Because of the new election, the
various slates can increase their
budgets by the following amounts as
specified in the bylaws:
The COP slates, The Slate of the
l imes and Students' Choice, will be
allowed to spend an additional $50
more than their original $250 limit.
The Senior Class Presidents slates,
The Slate of the Nineties and A
Kinder, Gentler Slate, will be allowed
to spend an additional $25 more than
their original $100 limit. The bylaws
stipulate that the SCLC can spend $60
to campaign, but make no mention of
additional allowance in the case of a
runoff.
The ASSU Senate voted last night
to pay for the Senior Class Presidents
campaigns because of a violation of
the bylaws in the general election. If
the Elections Commission had fol
lowed the bylaws and held a prefer
ential election, where voters rank their
choices, there would be no need for a
runoff election.
If no one takes more than half of
the votes in a preferential election, the
third-ranked slate's swing votes are
divided between the other two slates.

Therefore, one slate must earn a
majority.
To compensate the two slates for
forcing them to participate in a runoff,
the ASSU voted to fund the two cam
paigns.
All slates will be allowed to reuse
any of their campaign materials left
over from the general election without
additional charge.
Krauss said that all campaign pro
cedures and regulations, as specified
in the bylaws, will apply to the runoff

election.
The new election will also increase
the budget of the Elections Commis
sion itself. Krauss submitted an
itemized budget for the paper ballot
runoff of between $5,000 and $6,000
to be approved by the ASSU Senate.
Krauss did not have a budget prepared
in time to be voted on in last night's
senate meeting.
The computerized election cost
about $10,000, but Krauss said
this figure is less than what a
paper ballot general election
would have cost, and the runoff
election should not cost as much
as the general election.
As of last night, the candidates
had not been informed about the
procedures and regulations of the
runoff election.
COP Slate of the Times mem
ber David Brown said he felt his
slate would have won the COP
election if the Hammer and Coffin

Slate had not captured 14.6 per
cent of the vote. Nevertheless, he
remained "excited" about the up
coming election.
Candidate for senior class pres
ident, Nicky Taylor of The Slate
of the Nineties, expressed her ex
haustion. "We all have a lot to do
. . . it's been a long week."
Kindler, Gentler Slate member
Leslie Hatamiya was disappointed
at having to continue the cam
paign but pleased with the sen
ate's decision.
COP Students' Choice member
Alex Hoye admitted that his slate
had "mixed feelings" about the
results of the election.
