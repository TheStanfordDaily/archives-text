## Endangered rights 
### 
Rally will underscore
importance of women's
reproductive rights

YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT
you've got 'til it's gone.
That's usually how things
work. But don't let this happen
with abortion.
As the Supreme Court takes
up the issue of legal abortion next
week, it is not too early to realize
the freedom that we have, nor
to act to preserve it.
On April 10, Washington wit
nessed a 300,000-strong expres
sion of this pro-choice acknowl
edgement. Fortunately, Stanford
students who couldn't join the
massive march for preserving le
gal abortions are not letting ge
ographic distance squelch activ
ism.
Although there won't be
300,000 people at the pro-choice
rally in White Plaza on Monday,
the student display of commit
ment to the cause engages Stan
ford in the critical national move
ment to preserve women's right
to abortion.
On Wednesday, the Supreme
Court will hear oral arguments
for Webster v. Reproductive
Health Services, a case that chal
lenges the basic right to abortion
as provided by the Roe v. Wade
decision in 1973.
The case challenges Roe v.
Wade in four areas. The Supreme
Court will consider whether a
state can:
• Declare "the life of each
human being begins at concep
tion," as the Missouri law states
in its preamble;

• Ban abortions at public facil
ities;
• Forbid publicly-funded family
planning counselors from men
tioning abortion as an option for
pregnant women; and
• Require potentially danger
ous and expensive medical tests
for women considering an abor
tion after 19 weeks of pregnancy.
Of the nine justices on the
court, three have been affiliated
with Stanford in some way —
either as an undergraduate, Law
School student or a Law School
professor. If Stanford lends its
voice to the growing clamor for
abortion rights, it can hardly go
unnoticed.
The court will decide the case
by July. Between now and then,
Americans will have the oppor
tunity to articulate thoughtful re
sponses to the debate and to
grapple with an issue that dips
into reservoirs of emotion, law
and faith.

Students particularly owe it to
themselves to take a stand on
the issue, since reproductive
rights are pertinent for younger
people just discovering their
sexuality.
Because of the immediacy and
importance of the issue, abortion
slaps apathy in the face — it is
an issue requiring compassion
and pragmatism.

The student groups on campus
representing the two sides of the
debate, Stanford Students for
Life and the Pro-choice Alliance,
which is sponsoring the Monday
rally, have sparked campus
dialogue about abortion and
reproductive rights.
Stanford Students for Life plan
to hand out literature of their
own during the rally, said group
leaders.
