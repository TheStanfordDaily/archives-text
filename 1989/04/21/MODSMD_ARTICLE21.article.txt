## Interested undergrads can pursue architecture here 
### 
IN A MARCH 22 story about the
School of Engineering's new Center
for Integrated Facility Engineering,
the Campus Report mentioned a course
the center will sponsor on "The Proc
ess and Practice of Architecture." The
article stated that this is "the first
time since the late 1970's that Stan
ford will offer an architecture course."
Not exactly. One of Stanford's best
kept secrets, it seems, is that architec
ture is taught here in various ways.
Two of us who are involved in the
subject felt that this is a good opportu
nity to point out both the good and
the bad news about architectural edu
cation at Stanford.
The bad news is that Stanford is
practically the only major university in

America without a school or depart
ment of architecture. This is especially
unfortunate since Stanford, with its
strengths in engineering, computer
science, business and other fields,
could create a unique program in
architecture that would be at the

cutting edge of the profession and
contribute to dealing with the environ
mental, urban and housing problems of
our civilization.
The good news is that despite the
lack of an architecture school, Stanford
undergraduates can prepare well for
graduate study in the subject. This can
be done in several ways, the most
popular being the Architecture and
Urban Design option in the Urban
Studies Program.
Students choosing this option take a
wide range of courses related to archi
tecture, from the sciences and engi
neering to architectural history and
studio courses in the Art Department,
and urban design courses taught by
San Francisco architect Gerald Gast.

Each year, Stanford students who
have majored in Urban Studies or
other fields are accepted into the best
graduate schools of architecture in the
country.
Until the day that Stanford creates a
full-fledged program in architecture,
students should know that courses on
the subject are offered in various
departments, and that it is possible to
prepare here for further study in the
field.
