# The 						University must solve problem in grads' housing
## 
### 
It is spring again! It is also time to
consider and remedy a peculiar prob
lem faced by single graduate students
living on campus.
Starting last year, the graduate
housing program introduced the con
cept of specifying exactly the type of
housing students desired (e.g., Rains
two-bedroom, Rains four-bedroom. . .).
The intent of the new scheme was to
give students a chance to move to
housing better suited to their needs
and tastes â€” an excellent and laudable
idea.
Everyone was excited about the idea
until that fine day in September when
it came time to move. The principal
problem involved asking people to
move to different categories of houses
within Escondido Village itself.

Second, there was a minor timing
problem. Basically, there was a period
on that day when people had moved
out of their old places and couldn't
move into their new places.
While the idea behind the scheme
("give those who want to move a
chance to do so") is laudable, the im
plementation needs some looking into.
A simpler solution may be to reduce
the number of choices, for instance
Rains, Escondido Village low rise, Es
condido Village high rise and Crothers
Memorial Hall. If a student is re
allocated to the same type of housing,
then the student should move only if
he or she wants to.
It is clear that a good solution needs
to be found. Uprooting everyone is
certainly not a solution! And asking
everyone to move at the same time
and in a short span is most incon
venient. Could I request the authorities
to kindly address this issue?
