# Why do so many Stanford students wage private wars?

Imagine a Stanford where passing
strangers acknowledged one another
with a look and a smile and did not
stare in loneliness at the ground.
Imagine a Stanford where the first
question asked was not "why is this
person strange and different?" but
"What can I learn from our differ
ences?"
Imagine a Stanford where women
were not so threatened that they
starved themselves to death and men
were not so threatened that they lived
in Encina Weight Room.
Imagine a Stanford where the Sigma
Alpha Epsilon Fraternity house, Casa
Zapata, Ujamaa House and East House
were considered by all as home.
Imagine a Stanford where "Nutur
ing, Healing and Love" was a D.R.

without a pass/no credit option.
Imagine a Stanford where "how you
felt" was more important than "how
you did."
Imagine.
