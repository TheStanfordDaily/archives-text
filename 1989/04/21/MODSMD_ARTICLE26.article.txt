## UCMI gives staff short end of stick 
### 
I HAVE HAD an opportunity to
read that part of the University
Committee on Minority Issues
Report pertaining to staff. Unfortu
nately, it did not take too much time
because the treatment of staff issues
only occupied six pages of the 237-page
report.
Granted, one can not equate num
bers of pages with substance. Yet it
continues to trouble me that, although
staff comprises almost 30 percent of
the University community, less than 3
percent of the report addresses staff
members.
Before addressing the central themes
of the report, there are a couple of
tidbits worth mentioning. First, I
compliment the writers for capitalizing
the first letter of "Black" in the text;
this has to represent an editing
breakthrough of the highest order in
Stanford publications.
Second, the report correctly points
out that "qualified minorities" is used
so often as a cop-out that it is almost
treated as one word and inseparable
when referring to hiring and promoting
people of color. (In spite of this confes
sion in the report, the latest Affirma
tive Action plan still uses it!)
Third, I am not sure if "Blacks as
physically gifted" should be considered
as a positive stereotype, which is sug
gested by the report (p. 213).
Fourth, indeed ethnic diversity and
gender diversity should not be viewed
as conflicting goals, but why the latter
is more successful than the former is
worthy of more attention by this

report than two sentences in a footnote
(p. 211).
One of the central themes of the
report is accountability â€” for which I
applaud the authors. The report, how
ever, falls short of discussing what will
occur if managers and supervisors are
found lacking in accountability. Current
and future managers should be audited
for their performance in these areas
and disciplined if found lacking.
There are managers in high positions
of the University who have never hired
a person of color in an exempt posi
tion! Further, employee relations on
campus and the grievance procedures
must be reconstituted into instruments
of fairness and due process, and not
instruments of management.
The other central theme is "interac
tive pluralism," without acknowledging
that this must occur first in "top
administration." If you have ethnic
diversity in the highest echelons of the
University's administration, multicul-

tural understanding will surely flow
down through the channels of the
University like a mighty stream.
To put it more bluntly, the masses
of white employees are more likely to
address issues of racial diversity if they
are reporting to, or at least lateral to,
persons of color.
The University must rearrange its
priorities, first by rearranging the
ethnicity of its administrative executive
officers. The progress of people of color
on high posts at Stanford should not
be regulated by the degree to and rate
in which cross-cultural understanding
is achieved, if at all, by the masses.
