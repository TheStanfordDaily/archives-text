## Network may have hidden pro-life bent 
### Lori Silver Editorial staff 
Judging from the advertise
ments it runs, the Stanford
Crisis Pregnancy Network
seems innocuous. Yet the Con
traceptive Information Center
refuses to distribute its litera
ture or to refer students to its
services. And Residential Edu
cation does not recommend the
network to resident assistants.
"Pregnancy test, supportive
confidential peer counseling,
clarification of options, all serv
ices free," reads the network's
ad, which runs every day in
The Daily's classified section.
But that ad, critics charge,
masks an organization with a
pro-life agenda.
"They are an anti-choice or
ganization, but it's hard to tell
from their literature," said Lee
Salsburg, co-director of the
contraceptive center.
Assoc. Dean of Residential
Education Alice Supton said
she does not distribute the net
work's material to RAs because
the organization has not dis
closed its ideology.
"When I saw their brochure,
I asked that it include a state
ment explaining the orientation
of the group. If they explain
their orientation, I would be
happy to distribute it," Supton
said
Network co-director Jon Ol
sen, a graduate student in earth
sciences, admitted that the
group believes in"the right to
life" but asserted that the net
work tries to forge a middle
ground between pro-life clinics
"where they are basically
devoted to making you not
have an abortion," and abor
tion referral centers.
The network functions with
the help of about 10 volunteers,
most of whom are students, and
receives no funding from the
ASSU, Olsen said. Instead, he
said, private donors support
the group's activities.
Averaging about one client a
week, the network primarily
serves Stanford students, ac

cording to Olsen.
Although the services pro
vided by the network in some
respects resemble those pro
vided by Cowell Student Health
Center, important differences
delineate the clinics.
Like Cowell, the network
provides free pregnancy testing
and counselors to help outline
a woman's options if she learns
she is pregnant.
But, unlike Cowell, the net
work offers its counseling serv
ices to a woman while she is
waiting for the results of her
pregnancy test. Nurse-prac
titioners at Cowell go over op
tions with a woman only after
she receives her test results.
However, Salsburg of the
contraceptive center noted,
"Usually you give support
while she's waiting for her test
to come back. You don't start
the process until she knows
she's pregnant."
In addition, the network
refuses to provide a pregnant
woman with the names and ad
dresses of abortion clinics if she
decides to choose that option.
Cowell, in contrast, will refer
women to abortion clinics as
well as adoption clinics and
clinics that will support her de
cision to carry the child to
term.
"In no way will we coerce
her into any decision, but we
will not help her (get an abor
tion)," Olsen said. "We will tell
her to go to Cowell." But, the
clinic does refer women to
adoption and other support
agencies, he added.
For this reason, the contra
ceptive center refuses to deal
with the network. "We don't
refer people to them and we
don't have their literature in
the center because we believe
the full range of options should
be given," Salsburg said.
The network "straddles a
real fine line," Olsen said, "in
that we feel that the fetus has
some right to life when weighed
against the woman's right to
life. It's a difficult position to
be in."
