The Structured Liberal Educa
tion program will move into up
perclass dorms next year in an
attempt to become more "in

Faisan and Cardenal, four-class

"We had no input," said Car
denal RA Susie Matsuno. "I was
surprised by the decision."
Greenberg said she agreed that
the RAs should have been in
formed earlier, but that Residen

SLE's presence in a dorm often
creates unique problems and ten
sions, resulting from its intense
intellectual nature and rigorous
academic structure.
"Nothing against SLE, but it
kind of separates the dorm," said
PaJoma freshman Jenny Coleman,
