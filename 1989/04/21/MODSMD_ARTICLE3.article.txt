# Four-class dorms will now host SLE
## 
### Nathanael Cousins Staff writer 
The Structured Liberal Educa
tion program will move into up
perclass dorms next year in an
attempt to become more "in
clusive," according to SLE co
ordinator Suzanne Greenberg.
Faisan and Cardenal, four-class
dorms in Florence Moore Hall,
will house the SLE program next
year, along with Alondra, an all
freshman residence which will
remain unchanged as half-SLE,
according to Greenberg, who is
also a lecturer in the program.
All-frosh dorms Paloma and
Gavilan will no longer host the
program, while Mirlo and Loro
will remain unchanged as four
class, SLE-less dorms.
In addition, SLE will grow in
size from 72 to 84 students next
year in response to increased
demand, Greenberg said. She
envisions the program someday
growing to 125 students, noting
that 220 applied last year.
"SLE is a very, very sincere
intellectual program that is at
tempting to be more inclusive, not
exclusive, of the student body,"

said Greenberg. "It is not some
thing to he wary of."
Hut some Florence Moore resi
dents are not convinced the
change is such a good idea.
"The general consensus is that
this is a had idea," said Kelly
Brown, a resident assistant in Car
denal who has lived in Florence
Moore for three years. "The whole
idea came from above. There was
really no debating it."
"We had no input," said Car
denal RA Susie Matsuno. "I was
surprised by the decision."
Greenberg said she agreed that
the RAs should have been in
formed earlier, but that Residen
tial Education made the decison,
not her.
SLE's presence in a dorm often
creates unique problems and ten
sions, resulting from its intense
intellectual nature and rigorous
academic structure.
"Nothing against SLE, but it
kind of separates the dorm," said
PaJoma freshman Jenny Coleman,
whose roommate is in SLE. "1
wouldn't choose to live in that
situation again," she said.
Alondra freshman Lisa Besson
said that although she hadn't
heard about the dorm sw ; tch, she
would still put Florence Moore on
her draw card. "I'm putting Flo
Mo on my card because it usually
goes pretty high. I wouldn't be
thrilled with having SLE in my
dorm again, but it wouldn't affect
me," Besson said.
"The idea behind SLE is to pro
vide for a more intense learning
experience. But along with that
comes the potential for a lot of
stress, which could be a bigger
problem next year," Brown said.
Brown noted that with the
change, the SLE program will be
come more intense because SLE
freshmen will live in the same
rooms. This year, most SLE stu
dents room with a non-SLE stu
dent.
Brown continued, "I could see
Faisan and Cardenal being less
popular in the Draw now. I'm not
saying anything bad about SLE,
but for an upperclassman one
half of the programs won't apply.
I see a potential for division."
Structured Liberal Education is
an intensive interdisciplinary pro
gram for freshmen which started
about 15 years ago. SLE stresses
critical reading and writing about

major influential texts in small
discussion and tutor groups.
According to "Stanford Today,"
SLE means "to help students
think deeply and rigorously about
difficult philosophical, historical
and literary questions."
Freshmen receive nine units per
quarter for SLE and fulfill the
Western Culture, writing and two
distribution requirements for ful
fillment of the three quarter se
quence, Green berg said.
Because of SLE's special na
ture, most students would like to
know which residences will house
the SLE program before they list
their preferences.
However, "Stanford Residen

ces," the official guide issued by
the housing center, does not list
the new SLE residences. The
change was made after "Stanford
Residences" was completed in
February, so the SLE information
was not included, said Rodger
Whitney, director of student
housing and assistant dean of stu
dent affairs.
In addition, some students in
Florence Moore and most on
campus haven't heard about the
switch, which Whitney acknowl
edged has not been heavily
publicized. He said information
about the Draw change would be
distributed in the residence
newsletter.
