# Next week look for the secret agent decoder ring
## Look kids! Free zip 'n' save guide to Berk vs. Smoyer 
### Mark Smoyer Senior staff writer 
Ahh, yes! Spring is here. A
beautiful time of year in the South
Bay. Opportunities abound for fun
— perhaps a tedious game of fris
bee golf — and for romance —
perhaps a walk through Lakebed
Lagunita.
Fortunately, lest anybody get
too happy, a couple of old friends
have returned to make the grass
of our idyllic pastures a little less
grazeworthy.
The first is the Stench which
has become renascent in time for
the breezeless heat of April. If
you're feeling a little too giddy,
the Bug suggests a picnic lunch
on one of the grates between the
Post Office and Braun Music Cen
ter.
The second is the population of
those damned worms which pend
ulate on silken threads from tree
branches. Right now, as you read,
this population is beginning its
annual assault, forcing bikers into
the most wayward of routes and
giving the short among us some
thing to be thankful for.
Does it seem that an attractive
classmate has been staring at you
dreamily? Never fear, your life is
still a living Hell. He or she is
staring because one of those
worms dropped onto your head
while you were dodging to class
and is now making its way
through your hair.

Dear Bug,
Why did Andrew Berkowitz stop
doing this column?
— Bob Jiminez
The fact that you're asking this
question now leads me to believe
that you may not realize that
Berkowitz hasn't written Bug Me
since last June. Now editor of The
Daily's Entertainment depart
ment, Berkowitz (or "Berk") is re
sponsible for the production of
Intermission, a weekly humor
column and all those little jokes
sprinkled among "Hot Stuff."
Believe me, writing Bug Me
every week for an entire school

year is enough to crush the en
thusiasm of even the most dedi
cated entymologist, but in case
there are less obvious reasons
Berkowitz quit the job, I have
turned the computer terminal
over to the man himself:
Thanks, Mark. You know, Bug
Me was the weirdest thing I've
ever been involved with — ex
girlfriends excepted — and it was
hard to give it up. Nevertheless,
after bugging for an entire year
it seemed like time to move on.
This year I've had plenty of other
activities and distractions to keep
me busy and . . . Hey, Judge Bork,
come back here!!!
Actually, some believe that
Berkowitz still does write the
column. The current Bug, mean
while, has been complimented on
Bug Mes written while Berkowitz
was still at the helm. To help you,
the home reader, differentiate be
tween these two sad excuses for
comic writers, a comparison chart
has been printed somewhere on
this page.
About the only similarity be
tween the two is their egotistical
willingness to have this chart
done in the first place.
Dear Bug,
l)I)o you get paid? 2)Who at
The Daily gets paid? 3)How many
questions a week do you get?
4)What is the typical workload of
a Bug?
— Anna Chavez

l)Yes. (Did you think I did this
for fun? Did you think I might
> enjoy trying to accomodate the
5 senses of humor of 12,000 stu
? dents and a bunch of faculty and
' staff?) 2)Everyone except
Opinions columnists. 3)Four or
> five. 4)lf I decide I care: three or
' four hours, including research. If
I decide I don't: 10 minutes, in
-5 eluding three minutes of reminisc
ing about the days when I thought
r anything in my life mattered..
r Dear Bug,
J I think you really missed the
> point on your recent answer to the
question about M&M color ratios.
t The writer was clearly interested
e in discovering the answer to the
BIG M&M question:
Why are there no tan peanut
z M&Ms?
u Blah, blah, blah ... I can no
.. longer eat the peanut ones as a
r result of this absence. I know I
t am not alone .. . blah, blah, blah
n (this letter went on forever) .. .
— Sylvia Chase
Well, Sylvia, it's the fault of
t l your consumer compatriots that
t there are no tan peanut M&Ms.
According to a public relations
woman at M&M/Mars, consumer
preference polls were conducted
,/ "way back when" to determine
y what colors M&Ms would be.
? While tan did make the cut for
112 the plain variety, it did not qualify
for the peanut variety.
z Until next week. .. .


Bug Me


Some sorry readers believe that ex-Bug Andrew Berkowitz still
writes Bug Me, while current Bug Mark Smoyer has frequently
been complimented for Bug Me's written during Berkowitz's tenure.
The Daily therefore offers this handy clip 'n' save chart to clear
up the confusion once and for all.
