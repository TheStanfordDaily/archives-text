## Card hosts UCLA for vital series Escape artist Chitren gets the baseball team out of defensive binds 
### Robert Portnoy Senior staff writer 
If you don't know senior Steve
Chitren already, just call him "Houdini."
The Cardinal's number one escape
artist also masquerades as its best relief
pitcher.
For three years running, Chitren has
been the ultimate fireman — putting
out nearly every blaze he encountered,
even dousing a few he started himself.
Last Friday at USC, Chitren came on
in relief of starter Stan Spencer. Locked
in a 4-4 tie, USC loaded the bases with
nobody out. "Chit," as his teammates
call him, bore down to get two huge
strikeouts, retired the side, and Stan
ford prevailed in the ninth.
"I just seem to concentrate more with
guys on base. That's something I need
to work on, maintaining that level of
concentration, if I want to move on (to
pro ball)," Chitren said.
"When we played Miami last year (at
the College World Series), he had guys
all over the place. In the short span he
was in there, he had five or six walks,"
Pitching Coach Tom Dunton said.
But "Houdini" again escaped un
scathed, just as he did in the final game
of each of the Cardinal's two title years.
"Even if he doesn't (make it to the
pros), he's done something nobody else
has ever done — pitched the final out
in two consecutive College World Se
ries," Dunton said.
Dunton isn't kidding. You know this
great sports image: the final out is
made, the pitcher turns to greet his
onrushing catcher who hoists him high
in the air, crowning their team the new
champion. Imagine being that pitcher,
twice.
"There's some kind of fate or destiny
that's followed me in my career here.
I'm hoping it continues. But I don't sit
in the dugout between innings and sing
hymns," Chitren quipped.
Chitren's job is that of "closer," the
most nerve-racking, mind-numbing,

pressure-filled job a hurler can have.
When a tempest hits in the late innings,
Chitren is asked to calm the storm.
"He's extremely competitive. He
thrives on that situation where you
either do it or you don't," Dunton said.
"I've liked relieving because I've had
so much success doing it. My first couple
starts here I wasn't prepared and got
knocked around," Chitren said. "Now
it doesn't really matter to me. 1 like
coming in with the game on the line,
but when you're starting you're in con
trol of the game."
In recent weeks, Chitren has been
asked to start in order to fill the void
created by the injury to Stanford's top
starter, sophomore Mike Mussina. As
Dunton points out, that may be a bless
ing in disguise for Chitren.
"Professionally, he may be a starter.
He doesn't have the real explosive fast

ball [pro scouts] like from a reliever,"
Dunton said. "He has a real nasty slider
everyone knows about, and he has good
command of it. He can throw it any
time for a strike. It neutralizes any
hitter."
Selected in the ninth round of last
June's Major League draft, Chitren
decided he was not yet ready to take
the next step.
"I wasn't sure where I was concerning
baseball and 1 wanted to finish school.
With that out of the way, I'll be able
to concentrate on pro ball," Chitren said.
Chitren has only raised his stock in
'89. Though his ERA is slightly higher
— 3.71 compared to last year's phe
nomenal 3.12 — Chitren has fanned 77
in just 68 innings of work. Even more
encouraging, Chitren has drastically


Short relief specialist Steve Chitren, who has also started several games, has a 4-3
record with 2 saves and a 3.71 ERA.
