THIS SEASON AGAINST UCLA - The Bruins took two of three from the Cardinal in Los
Angeles over spring break.
WHO'S HOT — Brian Keyser is coming off his best outing of the year last Saturday
at USC. He pitched 8 2/3 innings of three-run, six-hit relief, recording a career-high
10 strikeouts in the process. It was the longest outing of Keyser's career and earned
him a start Saturday against the Bruins. Brian Johnson started the season by going
3-for-28, but has been on a tear ever since. Johnson has raised his average to .306
in his last 28 games. His four homers are tied for third on the club.
WHO'S NOT — The Cardinal continues to get little offensive production out of the
catcher spot. Freshman Troy Tallman is batting .145 (12-for-83) with just 9 RBI. Eric
Cox is hitting .170 (9-for-53) with 10 RBI. They have combined for five extra-base hits
on the season.
KEYS TO VICTORY — In two wins last weekend, the Cardinal got solid pitching perform
ances from Stan Spencer and Keyser. If they can come through again on Friday and
Saturday, the Cardinal will have a shot at the sweep it so desperately needs. The
Bruins are playing their best ball of the season after taking two of three at home last
weekend against conference powerhouse Arizona State. The best scenario would be
comfortable wins on Friday and Saturday. That would mean Stanford Coach Mark
Marquess could save top reliever Steve Chitren for the start on Sunday.
