# Frosh O'Brien takes teasing, wins in stride
## 
### Cameron Macky Senior staff writer 
Freshmen, as a rule, take a lot
of flak from upperclassmen. Es
pecially on sports teams.
As any rookie will attest, the
good-natured kidding, verbal
abuse and nicknames the veterans
heap on the first-year players are
all part of becoming an accepted
member of the team. If you can't
take the heat, you probably don't
belong.
If you're a rookie, you can al
ways find comfort knowing your
classmates are getting the same
treatment. You're all in it to
gether.
Unless, of course, you happen
to have the honor of being the
only freshman on the team. If
that's the case, you'd better be
prepared to take more than your
fair share of barbs.
Just ask Alex O'Brien, the only
freshman on the Stanford men's
tennis team.
"I get some abuse, but it's all
in good fun," O'Brien says.
"They're all nice about it. . . .
They like to tease me. It's a good
time."
The other members of the team
might be a bit wary of giving
O'Brien too much flak, if only be
cause he's more than proven that
he belongs on the team. After
floating around in the lineup at
the start of the season, O'Brien,
who sports the distinguished nick
name "Meat" — "Because I'm the
fresh meat on the team," he says
— has firmly established himself
at the No. 4 singles position for
the sixth-ranked Cardinal.
Perhaps even more importantly,
O'Brien has teamed with junior
Jeff Tarango at the No. 1 doubles
spot for the last three weeks, and
the pair has yet to lose a match.
With a record of 7-0, including a

win over then-top-ranked Woody
Hunt and Ted Scherman of Cali
fornia, O'Brien and Tarango have
brought a great deal of stability
to a doubles lineup which had
been in a continual state of
change.
All of which makes Stanford
Coach Dick Gould more than a
little pleased with his freshman
find. "Alex has been a tremendous
help to the team," Gould says.
"We're lucky we have him."
The tennis Class of '92 — all
165 pounds of it — was almost
no class at all, according to Gould.
"We didn't have a lot of scholar
ships to offer," Gould says,"and
last year there weren't that many
academically qualified players.
Alex, in fact, was probably the
most academically qualified
player we came across."
That alone, though, did not
guarantee O'Brien a ticket to
Stanford. "Alex hadn't really
thought about it because he
wasn't sure if he could play here,"
Gould says. "Then he played in a
couple of tournaments over
Christmas, did really well, and
kept coming on strong. And he
had a fantastic summer.
"It wasn't like I was writing
letters to him for five years, beg
ging him to come," Gould contin
ues. "It was a situation in which
he sort of fell into our hands."
O'Brien, who was the nation's
fifth-ranked junior player at the
end of the summer, has found the
transition to college play a little
rocky at times. "I'm still adjust
ing," he says."In college tennis,
there's a lot of pressure on
you. . . . It's hard to concentrate
on each point because you're
watching the guys on the other
courts play, or you're thinking 'If
I win this match, then it'll put
us up 5-I,' or whatever.
"I've found myself not concen

trating all the time," O'Brien con
tinues. "A lot of times I'll end up
losing a match because I'm not
playing each point."
Gould puts it more kindly. "Alex
plays in streaks very well," he
says. Translation: O'Brien has a
tendency to take long naps in the
middle of matches.
"There have been plenty of
times this year when Alex was up
a set and a break in the second,
and his mind just started to
wander," Gould says. "He'll start
looking in the stands, or maybe
at the next court."
The result has been a 9-8 dual
match record. "I win a match, and
then I lose a match, and then I

win a match because it takes me
losing a match to wake up,"
O'Brien says."And then after I
win, I'll do the same thing. I'll
get up on a guy, and then I'll blow
it.
"I've gotten into some really bad
habits, and I'm trying to break
them."
This weekend would be a great
time to start. O'Brien's exploits
against UCLA and USO two
weeks ago were a microcosm of
his whole season. "1 got killed by
(Bruinl Jason Netter," O'Brien
says."It wasn't because 1 wasn't
concentrating, he just killed me.
And the next day I came out and
played one of the best matches
I've played in college tennis. The
loss woke me up."
That "best match" was against
USC's Donnie Isaak, whom
O'Brien put away 6-2, 7-5 in less
than 45 minutes. O'Brien may
well play both Netter and Isaak
this weekend.
At the times when he finds the
consistency that has eluded him
in his dual matches thus far,
O'Brien's game reaches a higher
level. He won the NorCal Tour
nament in San Jose earlier this
season, defeating teammate Mar
tin Blackman in the final. "Every
tournament I've played I've done
well," he says,"and it's just be
cause I'm out there concentrat
ing."
Odds are that O'Brien will soon
find a way to keep his brain from
meandering during his matches.
And, when he does, he can pass
the information along to the ten
nis Class of '93.
"We've got three blue-chip
recruits coming in, so Alex won't
be an only child any more," Gould
jokes. And then it'll be O'Brien's
turn to give someone some abuse.
