THIS WEEKEND - 1:30 today, 1:00 tomorrow at Stanford Tennis Stadium.

Cathrall, a right-hander, is expected to play both singles and doubles.
LAST MEETING - The Cardinal lost 5-1 at UCLA April 7 and fell 5-4 to
USC the next day.
TROJAN UPDATE — USC lost both its matches last week, 5-4 at No. 5
UC-lrvine and 5-3 at No. 1 UCLA. Eric Amend, who played No. 5 against
Stanford last time, will probably be in his customary No. 3 spot today.
Greg Failla, the No. 2 man, has a 7-1 record in Pac-10 play.
BRUIN UPDATE — UCLA hasn't lost since late February, when the Bruins
fell 5-3 to No. 5 South Carolina at the National Team Indoors Junior
Brian Garrow is ranked fifth nationally in singles, and senior Buff Farrow,
at 17-2, is seventh Garrow and Pat Galbraith are the No 1 doubles
team in the country and are 16-1 on the season.
CARDINAL UPDATE — Stanford is 4-0 since its LA. trip, including a win
over No. 2 California on the road. With its sweep of the Arizona schools
and Utah, the Cardinal is now 8-0 at home. Junior Barry Richards is
12-1, and the Cardinal's No. 1 doubles team of junior Jeff Tarango and
freshman Alex O'Brien is 7-0
KEYS TO VICTORY — Doubles, doubles, doubles. The Cardinal split its
singles matches with USC two weeks ago and was leading all three
doubles contests after one set — and still lost the match Since then
the No. 2 and 3 tandems have been juggled, and how well those teams
do today will be crucial to the Cardinal's success As for UCLA, the
Cardinal had its chances to win several singles matches last time around,
but only won at No 6 If the singles lineup can pull off a split, anything
can happen.
