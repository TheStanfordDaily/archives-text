IRVING, Texas (AP) The
Dallas Cowboys ended weeks of
NFL draft speculation yesterday
by signing quarterback Troy Aik
man to a rookie-record six-yoar,
$11.2 million contract.
Aikman, who played at UCLA
and who will be the No. 1 choice
in Sunday's NFL draft, said he
hoped that within five years "the
fans will be comparing me with
Roger Staubach."
He said he wanted to sign with
the Cowboys because every Sun
day he used to watch Staubach
on television from his home in
Henryetta, Okla.
"I remember all those comeback
victories and I'd like to be part
of that someday," Aikman said.
"I can't step into Roger's shoes
but maybe 1 can do some of the
things he did."
Cowboys Coach Jimmy Johnson
said the third time was the charm

trying to attract Aikman.
"He turned me down out of
high school and went to Oklaho
ma," said Johnson, who was then
coaching at Oklahoma State.
"Then, when I was at Miami, I
tried to get him when he left Okla
homa, but he went to UCLA. 1
was afraid he would turn me down
a third time."
Ironically, Aikman suffered a
broken leg during a game against
Miami when he was at Oklahoma.
He sat out the rest of that season
and decided to transfer to UCLA
after Oklahoma coaches an
nounced they would return to the
run-oriented wishbone offense the
following season.
"Thanks for breaking my leg,
Coach," Aikman said. "You did
me a favor."
Aikman's $11.2 million contract
included a signing bonus believed
to be worth more than $2 million.
