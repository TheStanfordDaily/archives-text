## Freshman Debbie Graham having dream season for Card netters 
### Mark Rngowsky Editorial staff 
If you were a freshman tennis player
dreaming about the perfect year, it
would probably look something like this:
You'd be attending one of the finest
universities in the country, your team
would be ranked No. 1 and you'd have
a perfect singles record in dual-meet
play.
To top it off, you probably wouldn't
mind if you were having the time of
your life.
For Debbie Graham, that dream is
reality.
The 6-footer from Fountain Valley,
Calif, has attracted a lot of attention
at the No. 4 spot in the Cardinal's
singles lineup. She's 21-0 — Stanford's
only undefeated starter — and has dis
played a consistent, all-around game
that has often been nothing short of
brilliant.
"Debbie Graham is the number one
freshman in the country," Coach Frank
Brennan says of his budding superstar.
That's no surprise considering that
Graham was rated the top high school
player in the land last year. And, it's
also no surprise she wound up here.
"I've always wanted to go to Stanford
. , . probably since I've been about 7,"
Graham says."I wanted to go to a school
that was good for my education."
Graham also found an appealing
familiarity in Brennan. "Frank is a lot
like my coach at home," she says."I
didn't want any drastic changes.
"Both (coaches) pick up on the same
things . . . and know what to tell me,"
Graham says. If, for example, she's
having trouble with her forehand, she

says, Brennan ofTers the right advice
— even if he's not watching her play.
"He can be on another court and
know what to say," Graham explains.
To what does Brennan attribute this
phenomenon?
"She's very coachable," Brennan says.
"Not only is she receptive . . . she's able
to assimilate new techniques rapidly."
To the casual observer, it would ap
pear that the two are getting along
famously at the moment. It wasn't al
ways that way, though.
Earlier in the year, Graham was a
little upset about her position in the
lineup. A team leader her whole life,
she had to adjust to playing No. 4.
"I've always had really high expecta
tions of myself," she says, recalling her
early-season disappointment.
But, before the problem had a chance
to develop it was solved. "I came to
college to be on a team," Graham says.
"It really doesn't matter what number
I play.
"I can't be selfish and individualistic.
I have my turn (for personal glory) in
individual competition," she notes.
Says Brennan: "She's a superstar
who's been able to fit in with a bunch
of superstars."
Graham also realizes there's a real
benefit to the way things are. "I'm prac
ticing with the best players in the coun
try. It's a challenge."
Perhaps the most impressive thing
about Graham is when she explains how
content she is with her situation, one
gets a real sense of her sincerity. With
everything in her life going so well —
not just her tennis — Graham doesn't
seem to want to spoil it.
"I've been having the best time,"

Graham says of her freshman year. "I've
never experienced anything like [this].
"The last couple of years, my life
revolved around tennis," she says, add
ing that her sport left her time for little
else.
"At home, I always had to go to bed
early (because of practice)," Graham
continues. "Here, 1 get to live with all
my friends" and have a little more free
dom.
Those friends have helped her game
as well. "[They're] so supportive," she
says expressing her appreciation at how
they come out to watch her play.
And play she does. The superfrosh
has dropped only three sets all year en
route to compiling her sensational
record. Already, Graham is one of the
top players in college tennis. The scary
thing for her opponents is that she's
almost certainly going to get even better.
"I'm working on my serve-and-volley
. . . trying to make it a huge factor in
my game," Graham says. It's not a
"huge factor" already?
Brennan says it is, but. . . The "prob-

lem," as he sees it, is her serve.
"When | her serve is I going badly,
like it was earlier in the year . . .
she couldn't volley because she
would wonder if it was going in.
"When it goes in (like it has
lately), it's so powerful it doesn't
come back," he adds.
Brennan also noted that confi
dence is a key to a successful
serve-and-volley game, a notion
seconded by Graham. "1 get kind
of scared because my whole life
I've been on the baseline."
So even though she excels at it
in practice, Graham won't serve
and-volley in competition too of
ten. But, with Brennan encourag
ing her not to worry too much,
Graham is getting more comfort
able coming to the net.
In other words, the skill that
makes Graham such a dominant
doubles player — she and partner
Sandra Birch won a couple of pro
tournaments together over the
summer — is going to show up
more often in her already
dominant singles game.
That future editions of Debbie
Graham are going to be even bet
ter is nothing short of a nightmare
for her competition. Oh well, they
can always take up racquetball.
