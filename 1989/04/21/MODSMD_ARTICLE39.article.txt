# Track and field team hosts Open
## 
### Ed Pike Staff writer 
Start with 36 Stanford track and field
athletes, add a half-dozen West Coast
schools, a few New Zealanders and throw
in some U.S. Marines, and what do you
have? This unusual field has been as
sembled for the Stanford Collegiate Track
and Field Open, starting at noon tomorrow.
Stanford's performance against this mix
at collegiate and other athletes will be a
critical indicator of how the team will fare
this season because it is the last opportu
nity for Stanford to put it all together
before taking on California, the Pacific 10
onference and the nation in the upcoming
weeks.
The men will have to show that they
:an field a credible sprinting team and that
:hey have recovered from injuries in the
distance events, while the women will need
:o improve their depth across the board.
Stanford will mix it up with strong com-
Detition in every event.
The only events the Cardinal can count
jn winning are the men's and women's
liscus, with seniors Patty Purpur and
Syrian Boggess nearly ten feet ahead of the
competition (at 53 feet, 3 inches and 58
eet, 6 inches, respectively). Senior Morgyn
Warner and sophomore Debbie Malueg will
ittempt a Cardinal sweep in the women's
?vent.
Purpur and senior Glenn Schneider also
iold the edge going into the discus but will
ace tough competition from Mary
of the Sacramento Track Club

and Bart Goodell of San Fransisco State.
The New Zealand natives will make the
quarter-mile race faster. Four quarter
milers from New Zealand each will be
seeded under :47 and could come within a
few seconds on the 27-year-old Stadium
Record of 3:03.8 in the mile relay.
The Stanford team will focus on individ
ual performances and the meet will not be
scored. Instead, "the individual focus is to
qualify for the Pac-10 Championships (to
be held May 20 at Stanford)," Purpur said.
"As a team, the focus is definitely on the
Cal meet."
In the distance events, the Cardinal will
be focusing on the 1,500 meters and the
800 meters. Freshman Jodi Bilotta will
double in both events for the women, run
ning with Olympian PattiSue Plummer.
The men's events will feature huge fields
in both middle-distance races. In the 1,500
meters the Cardinal will be lead by senior
James Alborough, junior Bill Crowley and
sophomores Jason Martin and Chris Rae.
These athletes, along with sophomore Dave
Strang in the 800 meters, will be the bulk
of the distance team against California next
weekend.
The primary race in the sprints will be
the women's 200 meters where freshmen
Chryste Gaines, Jackie Edwards and
d'Layne Kerr will attack the school record
and Pac-10 qualifying marks. Gaines will
likely take the school 200-meter record to
go along with her 100-meter school record,
while Edwards and Kerr are also strong
bests to beat the 24.64 Pac-10 mark.


Fred Carter and David Rees will pace the Cardinal track team in the 3,000-meter
steeplechase during this weekend's Stanford Collegiate Track and Field Open.
