No Big Game bonfire. No all
campus party.
That's what Axe Committee
leaders predict will happen next
year now that the group has lost
its $34,000 ASSU special fee re
quest.
With last year's fee accounting
for about 62 percent of the Axe
Committee's total annual funding,
Stanford's official spirit committee
received a serious blow from the
57.5 percent of student voters who
opted against this year's fee re
quest.
Axe Committee Chair Pat Broun
doubted that he could raise the
$25,000 needed to cover the cost of
the committee's Big Game tradi
tions â€” the $15,000 bonfire and
$10,000 all-campus party in White
Plaza.
"I'll be busting my ass next year
to at least have a bonfire," said
Broun, a sophomore.
Of the 22 student groups seeking
ASSU special funding, only the Axe
Committee, the Chaparral and the
ASSU Course Guide were denied

funding.
This year marked the first time
the Axe Committee has lost its fee
request in its five years of applying.
With only $3,000 coming from
alumni and business donations,
Broun said he would gear his group
toward solicting more outside spon
sorship.
But the Axe Committee's biggest
alumni donor, Dan Stone, yesterday
said he had "serious second
thoughts" about giving to a campus
spirit group that couldn't even rally
up student support for itself.
Dan Stone, a 1950 alumnus, ques
tioned the Axe Committee's ability
to psyche up crowds. "If students
don't get off their butts at games
I don't know why I should keep my
finger in the dike," he said.
Of the $1,500 in Axe Committee
alumni donations last year, Stone
gave $1,000.
Within the University, the Axe
Committee might have options
other than ASSU financing. Athle
tic Director Andy Geiger told The
Daily yesterday that he is consid
ering footing some of the group's
