# Three organizations lose fee requests, tighten belts

No Big Game bonfire. No all
campus party.
That's what Axe Committee
leaders predict will happen next
year now that the group has lost
its $34,000 ASSU special fee re
quest.
With last year's fee accounting
for about 62 percent of the Axe
Committee's total annual funding,
Stanford's official spirit committee
received a serious blow from the
57.5 percent of student voters who
opted against this year's fee re
quest.
Axe Committee Chair Pat Broun
doubted that he could raise the
$25,000 needed to cover the cost of
the committee's Big Game tradi
tions — the $15,000 bonfire and
$10,000 all-campus party in White
Plaza.
"I'll be busting my ass next year
to at least have a bonfire," said
Broun, a sophomore.
Of the 22 student groups seeking
ASSU special funding, only the Axe
Committee, the Chaparral and the
ASSU Course Guide were denied

funding.
This year marked the first time
the Axe Committee has lost its fee
request in its five years of applying.
With only $3,000 coming from
alumni and business donations,
Broun said he would gear his group
toward solicting more outside spon
sorship.
But the Axe Committee's biggest
alumni donor, Dan Stone, yesterday
said he had "serious second
thoughts" about giving to a campus
spirit group that couldn't even rally
up student support for itself.
Dan Stone, a 1950 alumnus, ques
tioned the Axe Committee's ability
to psyche up crowds. "If students
don't get off their butts at games
I don't know why I should keep my
finger in the dike," he said.
Of the $1,500 in Axe Committee
alumni donations last year, Stone
gave $1,000.
Within the University, the Axe
Committee might have options
other than ASSU financing. Athle
tic Director Andy Geiger told The
Daily yesterday that he is consid
ering footing some of the group's
bill.
The Athletic Department might
siphon off some of the money that
traditionally goes to the Band to
bolster the Axe Committee,
Geiger said. This year the Athletic
Department gave the Band
$46,000.
Geiger stressed that a group re
sponsible for fueling enthusiasm
during Stanford's NCAA basket
ball season deserved its funding.
But sophomore Bruce Arthur
— who voted against the Axe
Committee's fee request — said
students, not any official group,
fire up athletes.
"The Axe Committee spends a
lot of money to build up spirit
that's already there," he said.
Rather than take a "sour
grapes" attitude to the rejection,
Broun said Axe Committee mem
bers would take a step back to
try and understand why they
could not garner more student
support.
"The attitude we need to take
is that we're obviously not doing
something right. We've got to do
something to rectify that," he
said.
Broun speculated that lack of
visibility might have hurt their
bid for a fee request. Not all stu
dents realize that the Axe Com
mittee is responsible for the bon

fire and some have yet to see the
Axe itself, he noted.
For the past two years, a glass
case at Tresidder Union which
traditionally displays the Axe has
been broken.
Although the Axe Committee is
just learning to cope without
ASSU financing, fee reiection is
old hat for the Chaparral.
"I think it's only once in ASSU
history that we've actually gotten
the money," said senior Helen
Song, editor of the Chaparral.
By distributing free Chaparral
issues last quarter and by spon
soring its own slate in the Council
of Presidents election, the Chapar
ral hoped to muster up student
support for their request.
But Song said she was prepared
for the "no" vote. The Program
Board — which regularly supplies
the Chapparal with $3,700 every
year — should keep the humor
magazine alive next year.
The future of the third ASSU
fee request loser is a little less
certain. The ASSU Course Guide
is a one-year-old project that is
still trying to find staff for next
year. With 58 percent of the stu
dents voting against its special fee
request, the project's future is "up
in the air," according to Course
Guide director Julia Kazaks.
Kazaks, a sophomore, said next
year's project coordinators — who
have yet to be selected — will
have to learn to run more effi
ciently.
