# Program Board funds frozen, student groups left out in cold
## 
### Mike Habata Staff writer 
As increasing numbers of stu
dent groups vie for a wad of
ASSU Program Board money,
some are left wanting due to a
limited amount of funding avail
able.
The Program Board, which
allocates ASSU funds to student
organizations, is facing a finan
cial crunch as demand for fund
ing continues to increase and
the annual budget, as voted on
by students during the spring
election, remains fairly con
stant.
In this week's ASSLT election,
students voted to keep Program
Board funds the same.
During the latest of six discre
tionary cycles during the year,
total allocations of $6,500 were
divided between 31 organiza
tions. Each group must apply
for funding with a line-item
budget request, which is voted
upon by the appropriations com
mittee and then by the full
ASSU Senate, according to Gina
Harrison, Program Board

budget counselor.
Student groups which re
ceived funding in the last cycle
ranged from ethnic groups like
MEChA, a Chicano/Latino stu
dent group, to academic groups
like the Symbolic Systems
Forum, to political action groups
like Amnesty International and
to sororities like Delta Sigma
Theta. In short, a representation
of the full spectrum of Univer
sity student groups received
funding.
One of those student groups,
the planning committee for the
annual Gay and Lesbian Aware
ness Week, has traditionally re
ceived adequate funding for its
week's worth of events. But this
year, it received $330 of the
$2,670 it requested, compared
to $3,400 it received last year,
according to committee member
Daniel Bao.
As a result, the committee has
canceled its annual musical con
cert, usually a main event, said
committee member Jennifer
Cole. Last year's concert fea
tured artist Holly Near and
costed approximately $2,500.

Harrison acknowledged that
"a lot of groups have been com
plaining," but that with its fixed
annual budget, the ASSU could
not satisfy all the groups re
questing funding.
Canetta Ivy, treasurer for the
Kuumba Dance group and mem
ber of the Council of Presidents,
said, "No one likes [the sit
uation], but 1 don't fault the
Program Board for it."
The Program Board, she ex
plained, has no reason to with
hold funds from student groups,
though the relative amount al
located to each group is a more
subjective matter.
Ivy claimed that more student
groups are aware of the finan
cial offerings of the ASSU, and
thus "a lot more groups are ap
plying for money."
When asked if this develop
ment creates negative effects for
groups such as GALA Week, Ivy
admitted that the system "is not
working the way it's supposed
to" as it tends to "pit people
(from student organizations)
against one another" in compe
tition for Program Board funds.
