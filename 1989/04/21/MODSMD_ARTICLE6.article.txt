Despite the 8 percent increase in tuition
announced in February, Stanford officials
said they do not foresee adverse effects in
terms of competitiveness with other uni
versities, the number of applicants or the
availability of financial aid.
According to Provost James Rosse, the
higher tuition is a result of a high inflation
rate and a University budget deficit.
Nevertheless, officials expect Stanford to
remain competitive in terms of cost. The
price of attending Stanford next year will
remain comparable to that of the Massac
husetts Institute of Technology, Brown,
Harvard and Princeton Universities.
When ranked with the 15 most expensive
universities in the nation, Stanford falls
in the middle with a reported $13,5(>9 for
tuition and $20,999 estimated total cost.
MIT reported the highest tuition figure,
$14,500 for 1989-90 — up from $13,400
this year — and Duke University the lowest
with $11,340. All 15 schools increased tui
tion by an average of 7 percent this year.
In terms of total cost, I)uke again is

comparatively the least expensive with es
timated expenses of $17,500. Matriculating
freshmen at Johns Hopkins University will
pay the most in the nation for their college
experience — $21,190.
Although students already enrolled at
•Johns Hopkins will pay an estimated total
cost of $19,830, freshmen will he forced to
pay the higher figure to offset a deficit in
the School of Arts and Sciences, according
to a representative of the Johns Hopkins
financial aids office.
The dual tuition strategy undertaken by
.Johns Hopkins was never a viable solution
for the Stanford budget deficit, Rosse said
"We were aware of that as a possibility,
hut never felt that it was appropriate to
treat students differently based on year. We
desired a uniform policy so people knew
what to expect," he said.
Warning people what to expect has be
come almost a battle cry in the Admissions
and Financial Aids offices, where officials
have been attempting to assuage the con
cerns of current, incoming and potential
