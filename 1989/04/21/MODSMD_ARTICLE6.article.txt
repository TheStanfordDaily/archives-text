# University says tuition hike won't hurt competitiveness
## 
### Debby Lu 
Despite the 8 percent increase in tuition
announced in February, Stanford officials
said they do not foresee adverse effects in
terms of competitiveness with other uni
versities, the number of applicants or the
availability of financial aid.
According to Provost James Rosse, the
higher tuition is a result of a high inflation
rate and a University budget deficit.
Nevertheless, officials expect Stanford to
remain competitive in terms of cost. The
price of attending Stanford next year will
remain comparable to that of the Massac
husetts Institute of Technology, Brown,
Harvard and Princeton Universities.
When ranked with the 15 most expensive
universities in the nation, Stanford falls
in the middle with a reported $13,5(>9 for
tuition and $20,999 estimated total cost.
MIT reported the highest tuition figure,
$14,500 for 1989-90 — up from $13,400
this year — and Duke University the lowest
with $11,340. All 15 schools increased tui
tion by an average of 7 percent this year.
In terms of total cost, I)uke again is

comparatively the least expensive with es
timated expenses of $17,500. Matriculating
freshmen at Johns Hopkins University will
pay the most in the nation for their college
experience — $21,190.
Although students already enrolled at
•Johns Hopkins will pay an estimated total
cost of $19,830, freshmen will he forced to
pay the higher figure to offset a deficit in
the School of Arts and Sciences, according
to a representative of the Johns Hopkins
financial aids office.
The dual tuition strategy undertaken by
.Johns Hopkins was never a viable solution
for the Stanford budget deficit, Rosse said
"We were aware of that as a possibility,
hut never felt that it was appropriate to
treat students differently based on year. We
desired a uniform policy so people knew
what to expect," he said.
Warning people what to expect has be
come almost a battle cry in the Admissions
and Financial Aids offices, where officials
have been attempting to assuage the con
cerns of current, incoming and potential
students over the recent tuition
increase.
Dean of Undergraduate Admis
sions Jean Fetter said she is al
ways concerned about tuition
increases. "I must reassure appli
cants that we operate on need
blind admissions," she said.
"Some colleges have had to say
that they can no longer afford to
operate on a need-blind basis, but
we are still committed," Fetter
said.
Fetter said she hopes that by
keeping high school seniors and
parents informed of Stanford's
need-blind admissions policy
through letters, visits and publi
cations, potential applicants will
not be discouraged by high costs.
However, there was a drop in
the number of applicants for the
class of 1993.
"The number of applicants
declined nationwide," Fetter ex
plained, adding that there were
three possible explanations for
this phenomenon. Most impor
tantly, the number of 18-year-olds
is declining, she said.
Additionally, Fetter said, the
high cost of private schools may
be causing parents and students
to choose public schools over
private ones. Rut, she said, this
hypothesis is unlikely since state
schools reported a 20 percent
decline in applications as well.
Finally, "with more data avail
able [such as GPA and SAT score
breakdowns], prospective appli
cants are being more realistic
about their chances — this is
borne out by this year's appli
cants, which were fewer in num
ber but more qualified," Fetter
added.
Moreover, she said that accep

tances, like applications, are not
as influenced by financial consid
erations as it may seem.
"(Many) students admitted who
choose not to come I to Stanford]
choose one of four schools: Har
vard, Princeton, Yale,
Fetter said. "All of those schools
have tuition at least comparable
to Stanford's. The number who
chose Berkeley over Stanford is
much smaller. So 1 don't think
expense is the deciding factor."
Fetter said she did not know
specifically what kind of impact
Stanford's tuition increase would
have on applicants from lower
income groups. "That's tough to
answer, since there are no statis
tics on how many choose not to
apply," she said.
While "need-blind" is the
watchword for the Admissions Of
fice, "meeting computed need" is

the operative phrase for those in
the Financial-Aids Office.
According to Financial Aids Of
ficer Roberta Johnson, "Many
schools are unable to meet their
lull financial aid obligations, hut
Stanford is working hard to meet
the calculated need of students.
There has been ;i steadfast effort
to meet this goal through
fundraising and seeking federal
funding."
Johnson said the Financial Aids
Office is committed to seeing that
the decreasing availability of
federal funds combined with the
steady increase in the cost of
going to Stanford does not even
tually result in a shortage of aid
available.
" There is enough concern in the
financial aid effort to try to en
sure that doesn't happen. Annual
increases in funding does demon
strate that commitment," she
said.

in the middle with a reported $13,5(>9 for
tuition and $20,999 estimated total cost.
MIT reported the highest tuition figure,
$14,500 for 1989-90 — up from $13,400
this year — and Duke University the lowest
with $11,340. All 15 schools increased tui
tion by an average of 7 percent this year.
In terms of total cost, I)uke again is

comparatively the least expensive with es
timated expenses of $17,500. Matriculating
freshmen at Johns Hopkins University will
pay the most in the nation for their college
experience — $21,190.
Although students already enrolled at
•Johns Hopkins will pay an estimated total
cost of $19,830, freshmen will he forced to
pay the higher figure to offset a deficit in
the School of Arts and Sciences, according
to a representative of the Johns Hopkins
financial aids office.
The dual tuition strategy undertaken by
.Johns Hopkins was never a viable solution
for the Stanford budget deficit, Rosse said
"We were aware of that as a possibility,
hut never felt that it was appropriate to
treat students differently based on year. We
desired a uniform policy so people knew
what to expect," he said.
Warning people what to expect has be
come almost a battle cry in the Admissions
and Financial Aids offices, where officials
have been attempting to assuage the con
cerns of current, incoming and potential
students over the recent tuition
increase.
Dean of Undergraduate Admis
sions Jean Fetter said she is al
ways concerned about tuition
increases. "I must reassure appli
cants that we operate on need
blind admissions," she said.
"Some colleges have had to say
that they can no longer afford to
operate on a need-blind basis, but
we are still committed," Fetter
said.
Fetter said she hopes that by
keeping high school seniors and
parents informed of Stanford's
need-blind admissions policy
through letters, visits and publi
cations, potential applicants will
not be discouraged by high costs.
However, there was a drop in
the number of applicants for the
class of 1993.
"The number of applicants
declined nationwide," Fetter ex
plained, adding that there were
three possible explanations for
this phenomenon. Most impor
tantly, the number of 18-year-olds
is declining, she said.
Additionally, Fetter said, the
high cost of private schools may
be causing parents and students
to choose public schools over
private ones. Rut, she said, this
hypothesis is unlikely since state
schools reported a 20 percent
decline in applications as well.
Finally, "with more data avail
able [such as GPA and SAT score
breakdowns], prospective appli
cants are being more realistic
about their chances — this is
borne out by this year's appli
cants, which were fewer in num
ber but more qualified," Fetter
added.
Moreover, she said that accep

tances, like applications, are not
as influenced by financial consid
erations as it may seem.
"(Many) students admitted who
choose not to come I to Stanford]
choose one of four schools: Har
vard, Princeton, Yale,
Fetter said. "All of those schools
have tuition at least comparable
to Stanford's. The number who
chose Berkeley over Stanford is
much smaller. So 1 don't think
expense is the deciding factor."
Fetter said she did not know
specifically what kind of impact
Stanford's tuition increase would
have on applicants from lower
income groups. "That's tough to
answer, since there are no statis
tics on how many choose not to
apply," she said.
While "need-blind" is the
watchword for the Admissions Of
fice, "meeting computed need" is

the operative phrase for those in
the Financial-Aids Office.
According to Financial Aids Of
ficer Roberta Johnson, "Many
schools are unable to meet their
lull financial aid obligations, hut
Stanford is working hard to meet
the calculated need of students.
There has been ;i steadfast effort
to meet this goal through
fundraising and seeking federal
funding."
Johnson said the Financial Aids
Office is committed to seeing that
the decreasing availability of
federal funds combined with the
steady increase in the cost of
going to Stanford does not even
tually result in a shortage of aid
available.
" There is enough concern in the
financial aid effort to try to en
sure that doesn't happen. Annual
increases in funding does demon
strate that commitment," she
said.
Despite the 8 percent increase in tuition
announced in February, Stanford officials
said they do not foresee adverse effects in
terms of competitiveness with other uni
versities, the number of applicants or the
availability of financial aid.
According to Provost James Rosse, the
higher tuition is a result of a high inflation
rate and a University budget deficit.
Nevertheless, officials expect Stanford to
remain competitive in terms of cost. The
price of attending Stanford next year will
remain comparable to that of the Massac
husetts Institute of Technology, Brown,
Harvard and Princeton Universities.
