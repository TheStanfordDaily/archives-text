When Kathryn Gorges, a graduate stu
dent in philosophy, joins the rally for abor
tion rights Monday in White Plaza, she
will bring with her an interest in the na
tional debate that reaches beyond the head
lines.
"I had an abortion in 1975, when I was
18 and a freshman at William and Mary
College," said Gorges, now 32. She said
her desire to continue college, have a career
and exert some control over her life
motivated her decision.
"I felt that if 1 didn't have an abortion
my whole life would be completely different,
and it wouldn't be like I wanted it to be
"If I had been in that position and it
hadn't been legal, who knows what would
have happened to me. 1 would have gone
ahead and gotten an abortion anyways."
Looking back. Gorges said that she didn't
regret having the abortion, but added, "It
was a very difficult decision for me. I had
an opportunity, that I didn't take, to have
a child I have to live with it."
Although The Daily offered her

an abortion my whole
life would be completely
different, and it wouldn't
be like I wanted it to be.'

anonymity, Gorges refused. "I'm willing to
risk talking to people about it because I
think it will do some good."
As the right to an abortion becomes more
and more fragile as each day passes, women
like Gorges who have had abortions, as
well as others whom the issue touches in
some way. have begun to speak out â€” on
both sides of the debate.
Activism on both the pro-choice and pro
life sides of abortion has gained momentum
on a national level, a path unusual for
most such'issues, which usually jump to
prominence from college campuses.
