# Abortion debate hits home Students push the issue to prominence on campus

### Lori Silver Editorial staff 
When Kathryn Gorges, a graduate stu
dent in philosophy, joins the rally for abor
tion rights Monday in White Plaza, she
will bring with her an interest in the na
tional debate that reaches beyond the head
lines.
"I had an abortion in 1975, when I was
18 and a freshman at William and Mary
College," said Gorges, now 32. She said
her desire to continue college, have a career
and exert some control over her life
motivated her decision.
"I felt that if 1 didn't have an abortion
my whole life would be completely different,
and it wouldn't be like I wanted it to be
"If I had been in that position and it
hadn't been legal, who knows what would
have happened to me. 1 would have gone
ahead and gotten an abortion anyways."
Looking back. Gorges said that she didn't
regret having the abortion, but added, "It
was a very difficult decision for me. I had
an opportunity, that I didn't take, to have
a child I have to live with it."
Although The Daily offered her

anonymity, Gorges refused. "I'm willing to
risk talking to people about it because I
think it will do some good."
As the right to an abortion becomes more
and more fragile as each day passes, women
like Gorges who have had abortions, as
well as others whom the issue touches in
some way. have begun to speak out — on
both sides of the debate.
Activism on both the pro-choice and pro
life sides of abortion has gained momentum
on a national level, a path unusual for
most such'issues, which usually jump to
prominence from college campuses.
» Such events as the April 10 pro
-choice march on Washington for
!:which 300,000 people turned out,
t-and blockades of abortion clinics,
-run by the national pro-life or
ganization, Operation Rescue,
jhave placed abortion on the fore
front of the national agenda.
Now, that national activism is
♦beginning to trickle down to the
* Stanford's pro-choice rally on
sponsored by the
T student-run Pro-choice Alliance,
*will mark the first mass "speak
-out" on a college campus in the
Bay Area, according to Margaret
; Kennard of the California Abor
tion Rights Action League.
" Other California campuses, in
- eluding UC-Berkeley, UC-Davis
and San Jose State University,
' have circulated petitions and held
■ all-day vigils for abortion rights,
' according to Kennard, who coor
dinates college activists for the
!league.
? "Campuses are ripe for this
issue," she said. "It's been smol
dering for a while in the backs of
people's minds."
On the pro-life side, Operation
Rescue has stepped up activity in
the Bay Area, involving several
Stanford students including
juniors Janice and Joyce Keen
who have served time in jail for
obstructing clinics.
In addition, Stanford Students
For Life, a pro-life student group,
has sponsored several dorm pro
grams and is planning to hand
out its own literature during Mon
day's rally, according to Joyce
Keen.
Much of the activism will come
to head next Wednesday, as the
Supreme Court hears oral argu
ments for Webster v. Reproductive
Health Services, a case that di
rectly challenges the fundamental
right to an abortion set forth in
Roe v. Wade in 1973.
Known as the Missouri case for
its state of origin, the case chal
lenges Roe v. Wade in four areas.
The Supreme Court will consider
whether a state can:
• Declare "the life"
human being begins at concep
tion," as the Missouri
in its preamble;
• Ban abortions at public facil
ities;
• Forbid publicly-funded family

planning counselors from men
tioning abortion as an option for
pregnant women, and;
• Mandate potentially danger
ous and expensive medical tests
for women considering an abor
tion after 19 weeks of pregnancy.
The court will hand down a de
cision in the Missouri case before
its term ends in July.
Since the court agreed in Jan
uary to hear the Missouri case,
campus activism has steadily in
creased on both sides of the issue.
It's no coincidence that
Elizabeth Wahl, a graduate stu-

dent in comparative literature,
founded the Pro-choice Alliance
in January, with the goal of cre
ating a "broad-based student
group" to foster a campus
dialogue on the issues of abortion
and women's choice.
In addition to planning next
week's rally, the Pro-choice Alli
ance has also held programs in
dorms, sponsored a letter-writing
campaign that sent over 100 let
ters to the U.S. Attorney General,
worked with other local groups to
defend abortion clinics against
Operation Rescue and gathered
nearly 1,000 names on a petition
affirming abortion rights, Wahl
said.
peopla-^'^-involved with the or
gan the
Women's Center. "It's difficult
founding a group like this in the
middle of the year. It's difficult

to get visibility," she said.
"I don't think many people
know what's at stake," she said.
"People are just beginning to
realize what it might be like to
have this right taken away. The
big turnout in Washington (for
the pro-choice rally) fired a lot of
enthusiasm," she added.
Senior Amy Framcetic, one of
the rally's main organizers, said
that she felt she "needed to do
something publicly to support my
views.
"We (women) can't give up what
we've accomplished in the last 15

years. We need to speak now while
it's still timely."
Speakers at the rally will in
clude Assoc. History Prof. Estelle
Freedman, Assoc. English Prof.
Barbara Gelpi and Law School
Prof. Deborah Rhode, as well as
representatives from the Ameri
can Civil Liberties Union, the
Women's Choice Health Center in
San Francisco, and Men Who
Care, a feminist group of men,
Framcetic said.
On the other side of the debate,
Stanford Students for Life mem
ber Jennifer Bryson, a senior, said
that "things are proceeding as
usual" for the organization.
The group is concentrating on
grass roots activism by showing
videos, in dorms and fostering
small group discussions, rather
than sponsoring big activities,
Bryson said.
But, she added, "This vear

things really started taking off."
Although the group does not meet
on a regular basis, more people
have become involved, she said.
"As far as the whole court case
is concerned, there's no way pro
life activism is going to influence
what the judges decide," said
Joyce Keen.
"All we can do is pray about
the decision at this point. I know
the truth will eventually prevail,"
she said.
Keen estimated that approxi
mately 20 people are involved in
Stanford Students for Life. "We're
small, but we have a positive in
fluence."
Outside of Stanford Students
for Life, Keen and her sister
Janice have spent time in jail for
blockading clinics for Operation
Rescue. Last week, Joyce Keen
was sentenced to another 10 days
in jail for her actions.
"If I knew that I would be
spending time in jail, 1 suppose 1
wouldn't have gotten involved . . .
but 1 know what I'm doing is
right," she said.
"Sometimes it is hard — it does
take away from school work and
all that. And it's difficult at Stan
ford because it's a predominantly
pro-choice environment, but faith
is involved.
"You know when you have the
truth on your side, you can't go
wrong," she said. "The rewards
have far exceeded any sacrifice I
have made."
A few Stanford graduate stu
dents in engineering have been ar
rested in Operation Rescue, but
the sisters are the only under
graduates who have been arrested
so far, Keen said.
More Operation Rescue abor
tion clinic blockades are coming
up, Keen said. The organization,
which works through local
churches, is planning an "all
woman rescue" on Mother's Day,
May 14, she added.
Though both pro-choice and
pro-life activisits have focused
their immediate sights on Wed
nesday's Supreme Court hearing,
they know they are in for a
lengthy and complex battle. Most
experts that the court's
most likely* decison in the Mis :
souri cases may restrict abortions
for women with late-term
pregancy or throw the abortion
issue back to state legislatures.
