Do you give
a flying f—ck
about
South Africa?
Native education should be controlled in such a way that it should be in accord with the
policy of the state....lf the native in South Africa today in any kind of school in existence is
being taught to to expect to live his adult life under a policy of equal rights, he is making a big
mistake....There is no place for him in the European community above certain forms of
labour...For that reason, it is of no avail for him to receive a training which has as its aim
absorption in the European community.... Until now he has been subject to a school system which
drew him away from his own community and misled him by showing him the green pastures of
European society in which he is not allowed to graze.'
-Hendrik Verwoerd, architect of the system of South African 'Bantu Education,' and future
South African Prime Minister in a 1953 speech to Parliament.
