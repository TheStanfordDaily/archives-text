THE SITUATION IN LOGIC
JON BARWISE
Situation theory and situation semantics are recent approaches to language and
information, approaches first formulated by Jon Barwise and John Perry in
Situations and Attitudes (1983). The present volume collects some of Barwise's
papers written since then, those directly concerned with relations between logic,
situation theory, and situation semantics. Several papers appear here for the first time.
