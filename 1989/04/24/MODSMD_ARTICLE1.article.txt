# Janitors rally for better pay
## 
### Susan McKean Editorial staff 
Frustrated janitors swept through White Plaza
Friday at noon. Nearly 100 of them.
Marching in red T-shirts and carrying "Justice
for Janitors" signs, janitors from Stanford and all
over San Mateo County demanded respect and fairer
wages from their employers as their union contract
negotiations continue.
The janitors, joined by other Stanford workers
and union representatives, are members of the Local
1877 chapter of the Service Employees International
Union, the fifth largest union in the nation.
Local 1877 represents more than 500 janitors in
the mid-Peninsula area, and is currently negotiating
a renewed general contract with an association of
eight companies that employ union members to
clean buildings.
