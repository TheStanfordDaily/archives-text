# Janitors rally for better pay
## 
### Susan McKean Editorial staff 
Frustrated janitors swept through White Plaza
Friday at noon. Nearly 100 of them.
Marching in red T-shirts and carrying "Justice
for Janitors" signs, janitors from Stanford and all
over San Mateo County demanded respect and fairer
wages from their employers as their union contract
negotiations continue.
The janitors, joined by other Stanford workers
and union representatives, are members of the Local
1877 chapter of the Service Employees International
Union, the fifth largest union in the nation.
Local 1877 represents more than 500 janitors in
the mid-Peninsula area, and is currently negotiating
a renewed general contract with an association of
eight companies that employ union members to
clean buildings.

Janitors marched through White Plaza Friday hoping to draw attention to their cause.
One of these companies, Acme
Building Maintenance, Inc., has
been hired by Stanford for several
years. The University is Acme's
biggest customer.
For more than an hour, Stan
ford Acme workers and other un
ion janitors marched from the
United Stanford Workers offices
near Toyon Hall, around White
Plaza and back out past the Quad.
They chanted in both Spanish and
English, chorusing "We can't sur
vive on $4.25."
Many janitors earn little more
than $4 per hour and do not
receive any benefits, according to
the janitors' union.
Acme supplies more than 50
workers to clean classrooms and
provide other janitorial services
around campus. All Acme employ
ees are represented by the
janitors' union.
Stanford pays Acme, and Acme
pays the workers in this arrange
ment, according to Ramirez. Stan
ford pays less for labor this way
and can more easily separate itself
from labor relations, he added.
But in this system, with a con
tracting company as the middle
man, the Acme workers wind up
making far less than workers di

rectly hirpd by the University,
Ramirez said.
Despite their lower wages,
Acme employees often work side
by-side with Stanford workers, ac
cording to Reuben Serna, USW
field representative.
Neither University nor Acme
officials could be reached Friday.
Along with calling for improved
wages and benefits, the noon-time
rally aimed to show strong union
solidarity — an important chip at
the bargaining table — and em
power the janitors with a sense
of unity and pride, Ramirez said.
"They receive no recognition at
all for what they do. They are a
98 percent Spanish-speaking work
force, made up mostly of immi
grants who have few other job
choices. This kind of thing (the
rally) makes people feel prouder
about what they do," Ramirez
said.
Moreover, Ramirez said the ral
ly, and others like it around the
country, targeted property
owners, such as Stanford, who
make the decision to contract
labor out to private companies.
This is where Ramirez said he
sees the real problem — with in
stitutions that want to save
money and disregard workers'
welfare.
The rally was one of a series
of nationwide "Justice for
Janitors" demonstrations.
