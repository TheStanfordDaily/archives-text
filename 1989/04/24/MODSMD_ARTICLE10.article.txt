## lowa returns home to somber reception 
### 
NORFOLK, Va. (AP) - The
scarred battleship USS lowa made
a somber return yesterday to its
home port, where about 3,000
family members and friends of the
crew welcomed loved ones who es
caped an explosion that killed 47
sailors.
Sailors in whites with black arm
bands lined the rails as the huge
vessel docked at the Norfolk Naval
Base's Pier 5 at 5:41 p.m., just
one minute later than Navy offi
cials had estimated. Twenty
minutes later, families started
filing aboard the ship, exchanging
tearful embraces with the return
ing sailors.
"They wanted to get here on
schedule and were anxious to get
home," said Capt. Steven
Karalekas.
The explosion Wednesday
flashed through the lowa's No. 2
gun turret, which extends six
decks down into the ship. There
were 11 survivors inside the tur
ret, all on the lowest deck loading
powder from the ship's maga
zines, the Navy said.
The surviving crewmen of No.
2 turret stood on top of the fire
blackened turret as the ship
pulled into the pier, with full
crews on the ship's two other tur
rets.
The No. 2 turret was in the
same position as when the explo
sion occurred, facing right with
the left and right guns elevated.
The center gun, where the blast
occurred, was depressed.
When the 887-foot vessel first
appeared there were scattered
cheers by those on the dock, but
all remained silent as the ship
pulled into the pier. The somber
mood was heightened by the lack
of bands, and few waves were ex
changed as the ship docked.
Adm. Powell Carter, com
mander in chief of the Atlantic
Fleet, was on the dock to greet
the vessel. As it docked, three
Marines raised a flag to half-mast
at the stern of the ship.
The Navy kept the news media
about 300 yards from the families,
and reporters were not allowed to

talk with the families or the crew
men.
The violence and power of the
turret explosion was shown in an
amateur videotape released by the
Navy on yesterday. The tape was
made by an officer on the bridge
of the lowa who wanted to record
the firing of the big guns.
The detonation, which appears
to blast away the gasket-like rub
ber "bloomers" that seal the tur
ret's gun slits, is followed by a
jet of intense fire and thick smoke
from the front and base of the
gunhouse.
The videotape cut immediately

to damage control firefighters
spraying heavy streams of water
onto the turret.
This morning, President Hush
will lead a memorial service in a
base hangar that can accommo
date 3,000 people.
The families of the victims were
invited, but Navy officials said
they did not know how many
would attend. None of the victims
listed the Norfolk area as their
hometown.
The explosion occurred during
exercises off Puerto Rico. The
Pentagon said it happened before
the middle 16-inch gun of the

three-gun turret had been fired.
The guns, the largest on any ship
at sea, use six 110-pound bags of
black powder to fire a 2,700-
pound projectile up to 23 miles.
The Navy has refused to spec
ulate on the cause of the explo
sion, which damaged only the in
side of the turret.
But Navy teams who entered
the turret immediately after the
blast found the No. 2 gun's breech
open and undamaged, with the
practice projectile that the gun
was to have fired still there, The
New York Times reported yester
day.
