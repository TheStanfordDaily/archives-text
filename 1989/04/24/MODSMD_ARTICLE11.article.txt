for the speaker's personal appearance before the

Prison occupancy hits record high
WASHINGTON (AP) â€” A record 627,402 men
and women were incarcerated in federal and state
prisons at the end of 1988, an increase of 7.4
percent over the previous year, the Justice De
partment said yesterday.
"The 1988 increase translates into a nationwide
need for more than 800 new prison bedspaces
per week," said the report written bv Lawrence
Greenfeld, corrections unit chief for the depart
ment's Bureau of Justice Statistics.
But prison construction has not kept pace with
the inmate population, the report found, with
overall prison capacity increasing by just 5.5 per
cent in 1988.
