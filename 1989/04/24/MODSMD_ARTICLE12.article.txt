BEIJING (AP) â€” Students
yesterday paraded on cam
puses, made speeches on street
corners and began organizing
a nationwide boycott of classes
to press their demands for
democratic reform.
The protests in Beijing were
organized and generally peace
ful, but marches turned violent
Saturday in Xian and Changsa.
Rampaging mobs looted stores,
burned cars and seized a gov
ernment building. Scores were
reported hurt.
The unrest was perhaps the
most violent since demonstra
tions began April 15, when the
death of reformist leader Hu
Yaobang stirred anti
government sentiments and an
organized protest campaign by
university students.
Protest leaders said students
at Beijing universities planned
to join a class boycott begin
ning today and to contact
schools nationwide to persuade
them to join.
They said the boycott was a
peaceful, legal attempt to force
communist authorities to meet
with them and discuss de
mands for a free press, an end
to official corruption and other
reforms.
Many students also called for
Premier Li Peng's resignation
and hung posters on campus
mocking him.
The official Xinhua News
Agency said today's People's
Daily newspaper contained a
commentary that warned: "So
cial turmoil can only do good
to an extremely small number
of people with ulterior mo
tives."
About 150,000 people joined
Saturday in one of the biggest
protests in Communist China's
40-year history, holding a 15-
hour rally at Beijing's Tianan

men Square. Authorities al
lowed the protest to unfold, but
students alleged yesterday that
police beat several and injured
one seriously.

Maybe I seem to
sacrifice my future,
but if this is suc
cessful, my future
will be better.'

Worse violence was reported
Saturday in Xian and
Changsha. The state-run Xin
hua News Agency said rioters
in Xian, a popular tourist city
and capital of northwestern
China's Shaanxi province,
forced their way into the
provincial government com
pound and burned buildings
and vehicles.
It said 130 security officers
were injured and 18 people
were arrested. Xinhua said the
melee began after students who
had been mourning Hu left the
scene.
Students at several univer
sities in Beijing paraded on
campus and met yesterday to
plan the class boycott and con
tact students in other cities.
One senior, asked if the
boycott could cost him his di
ploma, said, "I think democ
racy comes first and studies
second. Maybe I seem to
sacrifice my future, but if this
is successful, my future will be
better."
Others collected thousands of
yuan in boxes on campus and
the streets to pay for
pamphlets and a student paper
and the costs of contacting
schools nationwide.
