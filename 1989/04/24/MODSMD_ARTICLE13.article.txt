WASHINGTON 'AP) The
Bush administration plans to
move ahead with two kinds of
mobile strategic missiles, to delay
the B-2 Stealth bomber and to
cut Star Wars spending, Defense
Secretary Dick Cheney said yes
terday.
Cheney, in a television inter
view, also said the administration
plans to keep all four World War
II vintage battleships in the fleet
despite an explosion last week
aboard one of them, the USS
lowa, that killed 47 sailors.
The defense secretary was to
appear before Congress tomorrow
to detail cuts he has proposed to
meet a $299.2 billion defense
budget agreed upon by President
Bush and congressional leaders.
Bush decided to cut spending
on Star Wars, formally known as
the Strategic Defense Initiative or

SDI, to $4 6 billion for fiscal year
1990, down from the $5.9 billion
proposed by President Reagan,
and to reduce SDI spending over
five years to $33 billion, down
from Reagan's proposed $40 bil
lion.
Cheney said the president had
accepted his recommendation to
shift the focus of SDI from deploy
ment sometime in the 1990s to
research on a more advanced sys
tem, known as "Brilliant
Pebbles," consisting of thousands
of orbiting satellites.
"SDI is alive and well, but like
everything else, it has to fit into
a reduced budget," Cheney said.
Bush turned down one of the
new defense secretary's recom
mendations. to move the nation's
50 MX missiles, with 10 warheads
apiece, from silos to deplovment

on railroad cars ratheÂ¥ than
develop a single-warhead missile
to be based on trucks.
"What I recommended to the
president was that we go forward
with the rail-garrison system.
Brent Scowcroft recommended we
go forward with the small ICBM.
The president basically said, 'Try
to do both,'" Cheney said on the
NBC-TV interview program
"Meet the Press."
"But instead of doing both si
multaneously, we will try to se
quence them. That is, we will do
the rail garrison first, try to put
a little bit of money in the budget
next year for the small ICBM,
and then as we get the rail gar
rison deployed, we will start tc
ramp up on the small ICBM," he
said. "Eventually, though, we will
have both svstems."
