New SCLC proposal is
a great improvement,
though glitches remain

AMID widespread criticism
of its first proposal, the
Student Conduct Legisla
tive Council last week released a
revamped version that gingerly
toes the First Amendment line
and begins to clarify the first
draft's ambiguous language. Al
though the new proposal is a
marked improvement over the old
one, it does have serious flaws
that need to be addressed.
The SCLC has improved upon
its initial proposal by:
• Excluding verbal attacks
based on "intellectual" differ
ences from the realm of punish
able expression. Particularly at a
university, we must be free to
sharply question any ideas and
those who espouse them.
• Limiting punishable speech
to attacks on "an individual or a
small number of individuals,"
thereby excluding attacks on
large groups.
• Requiring proof of intent to
harass. As the comments follow
ing the new proposal hint, a white
student might overhear black stu
dents jokingly refer to blacks as
"niggers," and mistakenly con
clude that whites may use that
term without giving offense.
The proposal acknowledges
that unintended slurs do hurt;
but accidental insults, grounded
in ignorance, should be corrected
by education rather than punish
ment.
These changes satisfy most of
the objections raised to the old
proposal, but problems remain.

The second draft fails to cure
the "accepted community stand
ards" disease rampant in the first
version. The language has been
changed, to be sure, and now
bans expression "commonly un
derstood," "as a matter of social
consensus," to convey hatred.
But the meaning is the same.
The majority is placed in judg
ment of what is ultimately a mi
nority right. How would black
civil rights activists have fared
in the South of the mid-1960s
against laws relying on "matters
of social consensus"?
In addition, the new proposal
utilizes a highly questionable def
inition of the established First
Amendment term "fighting
words," to the confusion of both
lay and expert readers.
Specifically, the proposal re
quires that speech constitute
" 'fighting words' or their func
tional equivalent" — defined as
expressions that convey both in
sult and hatred — in order for
it to be punishable.
That has never been the mean
ing of "fighting words" within
the legal community. As former
Stanford Law School Dean John
Hart Ely has remarked, the term
"fighting words" means more
than mere profanity and insults,
in effect "an unambiguous invi
tation to a brawl."
The SCLC could easily enough
correct this problem by dropping
all reference to "fighting words."
Between now and the May 10
deadline for comment and
criticism to the SCLC, the Stan
ford community can ignore nei
ther the improvement in the new
proposal nor the shortcomings
that remain. Now is the time to
speak up.
