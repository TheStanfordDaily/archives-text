## Remember Turks' Armenian genocide; avoid denial 
### 
ON AUGUST 22, 1939, Adolf
Hitler ordered his troops at
Obersalzberg to exterminate all
Poles regardless of sex or age. He
concluded his orders with the rhetori
cal statement, "Who, after all, speaks
today of the annihilation of the Ar
menians?"
April 24 marks the tragic day on
which the Ottoman Turkish govern
ment initiated the systematic exter
mination of 1.5 million innocent Ar
menians between 1915 and 1923. The
premeditated massacres of the Ar
menian people amount to the first
attempt of genocide in the 20th cen
tury. •
Yet the tragedy of the Armenian
genocide did not end with the devasta
tion of a people and their homeland;

sadder still, the present Turkish gov
ernment continues to deny that a
genocide took place. The Turkish revi
sionist faction that attempts to twist
and obscure the historical fact demon
strates the Turkish government's intent
to complete the last phase in the cycle
of genocide: successful denial.
If the Armenian case were to be
decided academically in a political
vacuum, the failure of the Turkish
denial would be assured; the Armenian
genocide is well documented and unde
niable. Thousands of testimonies in the
national archives of Germany, Britain,
France, Italy and the United States
preserve the memory of the massacres.
Henry Morgenthau, U.S. ambassador
to the Ottoman Empire, witnessed the
Armenian genocide first hand: "I am

confident that the whole history of the
human race contains no such horrible
episode as this. The great massacres
and persecutions of the past seem
almost insignificant when compared to
the sufferings of the Armenian race in
1915."
The facts of the mass murder speak
loudly. Unfortunately, today's reality —
that Turkey is a key NATO ally with
Iranian and Soviet borders, and is a
country where U.S. corporations have
invested heavily — speaks more
decisively in U.S. policy-making.
Geopolitics have contaminated the
discussion of the Armenian genocide,
and the Turkish government has been
permitted to sustain a fabricated con
troversy.
By succumbing to Turkish pressure,

the U.S. government acts as an ac
complice to the denial phase of
genocide, the consequences of which
are devastating, as proven by Hitler's
all-too-real belief t hat genocide can go
unpunished.
We remain concerned about the
Armenian genocide not only because it
attempted to eradicate our ancestors,
but because of the broad historical
ramifications of its continued denial.
Even though 70 years have passed, all
the people of the world must recognize
Turkey's crimes against the Armenian
people. Prevention of future tragedies
against humanity depend on it.
