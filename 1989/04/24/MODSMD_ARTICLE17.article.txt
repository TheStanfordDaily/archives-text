# Feminism benefits right-wing women
## 
### 
Brava to Jennifer Bryson! Ironically,
as I see it, she is nearly a feminist's
ideal woman.
The student directory lists her as a
senior in political science. She is un
doubtedly an intelligent young woman.
She's attending a prestigious university
and developing her mind. She probably
has a promising career ahead. She
knows what she thinks is right and
wrong, and by golly, she acts on it.
She surely votes. She surely writes
letters to her government representa
tives. She speaks out, and her voice is
heard and respected.
Perhaps she (and other "non
feminist" women here at Stanford)
should think hard about how much
feminists in the past have contributed
to their being in their present position.
During most of the existence of their

precious Western Culture, anything
resembling "higher education" has been
closed to women.
Unless they're thinking of nursing,
secretarial work, teaching or another
"pink collar" job, chances are whatever
career they choose to pursue would not
have been open to women as recently
as 20 or 40 years ago.
There's still much to be done.
Wouldn't Bryson like to get equal pay
for equal work? Wouldn't she rather
that she be the one who chooses if and
when she'll bear children, instead of
her lover, husband, church or govern
ment? Shouldn't the opportunities that
she enjoys — and the ones she still
can't — be open to everyone, regard
less of sex (or, for that matter, color,
religion, political views or sexual orien
tation)?
Come and join your sisters, .Jennifer.
You're an inspiration to us all.
