# The 						Axe Committee deserved to be axed
## 
### 
The Axe has been stolen! No, not by
the Weenies, but instead, from within.
I refer, or course, to the fact that the
Axe hasn't been displayed for the past
two years in Tresidder Union where it
rightfully belongs.-
Fortunately the culprits, also known
as the Axe Committee, didn't escape
and are being punished by not getting
their ASSU special fee request. After
having two years to fix a display case
and not coming through, they
shouldn't be surprised by not getting
their funding.
By losing their funding, the Axe
Committee has been given a warning
that it is time to re-evaluate what its
purpose really is. The student body
doesn't want or need another cheer
leading squad. Stanford students want
the Axe Committee to provide activities

during Big (lame week, but don't want
to follow their "spirit building" cheers.
Why don't they save the time and
money they spend on cheerleading ac
tivities during Big Game, and instead
use it for things like the bonfire and a
security system for the Axe's display
case?
In the meantime, please "Give us
(back) the axe, the axe, the axe ..."
