# Pioneer president framed today's Standard

Editor's note: This is the first in a
four-part series examining the histor
ical context and modern-day implica
tions of Stanford's Fundamental
Standard.

Generations of Stanford students
have lived with the Fundamental
Standard but few are aware of its
origins, and the idealistic man — a
perennial optimist of New England
Puritan roots — who formulated the
98-year-old code of behavior.
David Starr Jordan, Stanford's first
president, conceived the Standard,
which is as old as the University itself.
Jordan's first formulation of the
Standard appeared in 1891, stating:
"In the government of the University,
the largest liberty consistent with good
work or good order will be given to
the students. The University is not a
reform school; its bounty is intended
for the earnest and industrious stu
dent, and the indolent or unworthy
will not bo retained in the institution,"
according to Michael Korffs 1975 dis
sertation "Student Conduct and Uni
versity Government at Stanford."
Within four years the Standard
reached its present form. Appearing in
the Stanford Register, the precursor
to today's Courses and Degrees, the
Standard read with an additional be
ginning sentence:

"In the government of the Univer
sity the largest liberty consistent with
good work or good order will be al
lowed. Students at Stanford. . ."
A pioneer approach
Jordan's Fundamental Standard was
a pioneer approach to student conduct
at a pioneer American university, said
University Archivist Roxanne Nilan.
Nilan is the co-author of a soon to be
released book, "The Stanford Album,"
detailing the development of the St »n
-ford community from 1885-1945.
The men and women at Stanford
during the early years were not only
pioneers in a physical sense, raising a
university in the empty fields on the
edge of the continent; they were also
pioneering a vision, a new approach
to higher education, Nilan explained.
Stanford, like its model, Cornell
University, was founded during the

late Victorian reform period in direct
opposition to universities like Harvard
and Yale, where wealthy sons were
educated, said Nilan.
In his vision of the institution,
Leland Stanford Sr. wanted a more
democratic university. "Stanford and
Cornell were meant for the masses,
not the leisure class," said Nilan.
"Stanford believed education was the
way to improve the living standard of
the American population."
To ensure that the masses could
attend, a student only had to pay for
room and board and no tuition was
charged. At that time, attending Stan
ford was cheaper than attending UC-
Berkeley, according to Nilan.
For those attending the University,
many who were the first members of
their families to study in college, the
opportunity to be a part of the pioneer
ing spirit provided them with a sense
of purpose. "There was a sense of em
powerment by being able to go to col
lege," said Nilan.
There was no greater pioneer at
Stanford than the Standard's author,
Jordan. Born of New England Puritan
stock, "charismatic" and 40 years old
when he assumed the presidency, Jor
dan was a "liberal reformer" according
to Nilan. He supported the women's
suffrage movement, was anti
imperiaTistic, an ardent pacifist and
environmentalist who was a founding
member of the Sierra Club.
According to Nilan, one of Jordan's

most notable traits as a liberal
reformer was his tremendous sense of
optimism. "Jordan was a perennial op
timist. He felt Stanford would be
great," said Nilan. "Jordan had great
optimism in the liberal ideal that 'We
can do it, that it is okay to put faith
in the positive."'
Placing faith in students
Jordan put his faith not only in the
institution but also in the University's
students. "Jordan had enormous faith
in the Stanford student," said Nilan.
Jordan's faith helps explain the
Standard's vague nature. Jordan as
sumed that the students coming to
Stanford were mature adults, who
knew what was right and wrong. This
view was a marked change from the
history of antagonistic faculty-student
relationships in higher education, ac
cording to Nilan.
Thus, for students already instilled
with a sense of decency, Jordan
believed specific rules would be
"demeaning," said Nilan.
For a University that would not
stand in loco parentis (in place of
parents), the optimistic Jordan would
allow students, according to the begin
ning sentence of the 1895 Standard
"the largest liberty consistent winr
good work or good order."
Jordan believed the only rules
needed were those of the state of Cal-
