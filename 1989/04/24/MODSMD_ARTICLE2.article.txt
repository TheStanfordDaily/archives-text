# Pioneer president framed today's Standard

### John Cuerva Staff writer 
Editor's note: This is the first in a
four-part series examining the histor
ical context and modern-day implica
tions of Stanford's Fundamental
Standard.

Generations of Stanford students
have lived with the Fundamental
Standard but few are aware of its
origins, and the idealistic man — a
perennial optimist of New England
Puritan roots — who formulated the
98-year-old code of behavior.
David Starr Jordan, Stanford's first
president, conceived the Standard,
which is as old as the University itself.
Jordan's first formulation of the
Standard appeared in 1891, stating:
"In the government of the University,
the largest liberty consistent with good
work or good order will be given to
the students. The University is not a
reform school; its bounty is intended
for the earnest and industrious stu
dent, and the indolent or unworthy
will not bo retained in the institution,"
according to Michael Korffs 1975 dis
sertation "Student Conduct and Uni
versity Government at Stanford."
Within four years the Standard
reached its present form. Appearing in
the Stanford Register, the precursor
to today's Courses and Degrees, the
Standard read with an additional be
ginning sentence:

"In the government of the Univer
sity the largest liberty consistent with
good work or good order will be al
lowed. Students at Stanford. . ."
A pioneer approach
Jordan's Fundamental Standard was
a pioneer approach to student conduct
at a pioneer American university, said
University Archivist Roxanne Nilan.
Nilan is the co-author of a soon to be
released book, "The Stanford Album,"
detailing the development of the St »n
-ford community from 1885-1945.
The men and women at Stanford
during the early years were not only
pioneers in a physical sense, raising a
university in the empty fields on the
edge of the continent; they were also
pioneering a vision, a new approach
to higher education, Nilan explained.
Stanford, like its model, Cornell
University, was founded during the

late Victorian reform period in direct
opposition to universities like Harvard
and Yale, where wealthy sons were
educated, said Nilan.
In his vision of the institution,
Leland Stanford Sr. wanted a more
democratic university. "Stanford and
Cornell were meant for the masses,
not the leisure class," said Nilan.
"Stanford believed education was the
way to improve the living standard of
the American population."
To ensure that the masses could
attend, a student only had to pay for
room and board and no tuition was
charged. At that time, attending Stan
ford was cheaper than attending UC-
Berkeley, according to Nilan.
For those attending the University,
many who were the first members of
their families to study in college, the
opportunity to be a part of the pioneer
ing spirit provided them with a sense
of purpose. "There was a sense of em
powerment by being able to go to col
lege," said Nilan.
There was no greater pioneer at
Stanford than the Standard's author,
Jordan. Born of New England Puritan
stock, "charismatic" and 40 years old
when he assumed the presidency, Jor
dan was a "liberal reformer" according
to Nilan. He supported the women's
suffrage movement, was anti
imperiaTistic, an ardent pacifist and
environmentalist who was a founding
member of the Sierra Club.
According to Nilan, one of Jordan's

most notable traits as a liberal
reformer was his tremendous sense of
optimism. "Jordan was a perennial op
timist. He felt Stanford would be
great," said Nilan. "Jordan had great
optimism in the liberal ideal that 'We
can do it, that it is okay to put faith
in the positive."'
Placing faith in students
Jordan put his faith not only in the
institution but also in the University's
students. "Jordan had enormous faith
in the Stanford student," said Nilan.
Jordan's faith helps explain the
Standard's vague nature. Jordan as
sumed that the students coming to
Stanford were mature adults, who
knew what was right and wrong. This
view was a marked change from the
history of antagonistic faculty-student
relationships in higher education, ac
cording to Nilan.
Thus, for students already instilled
with a sense of decency, Jordan
believed specific rules would be
"demeaning," said Nilan.
For a University that would not
stand in loco parentis (in place of
parents), the optimistic Jordan would
allow students, according to the begin
ning sentence of the 1895 Standard
"the largest liberty consistent winr
good work or good order."
Jordan believed the only rules
needed were those of the state of Cal-
ifornia. "The institution has no
rules to be broken. Nothing al
lowed by the laws of California is
forbidden by the faculty. Hence,
in general, no punishments are
threatened or administered. A
student is fit to stay in the Uni
versity or he is not," Jordan wrote
in 1897 to explain his disciplinary
philosophy.
Enforcement through suspension
Although the language of the
Standard allows for expulsion of
Standard violators, Jordan in
practice advocated suspension as
the ultimate form of punishment.
In a letter written in 1904, Jor
dan explained his position: "In
larger matters we have had the
theory that we did not punish:
that the students know perfectly
well what is manly and decent,
and that we sent away those who
violate this condition, giving each
student we sent away — except
in rare flagrant cases — the
chance to try again after a little.
We have never expelled any stu
dent. Each student has known
since the beginning that theft,
drunkenness, fraud on examina
tions, grafting, or malicious
disorder would lead to a request
to withdraw."
Maturity through guidance
Although willing to put great
faith in the students, Jordan did
establish a system that would pro
vide students with guidance,
thereby preventing students from

becoming "indolent and un
worthy," writes Korff.
According to Korff, Jordan's
"principal educational innova
tion" was the
system. Under the system, enter
ing students were expected to pick
a field of study and then pick a
professor within that field who
seemed most appealing as a per
son and sympathetic friend. Jor
dan, disapproving of a structured
curriculum, hoped that this would
allow students to study from a
person and not a book.
Jordan expected this personal
relationship to eliminate students'
adolescent tendencies. Jordan
wrote, "The best way to cure a
student of petty vices and childish
trickery is to make a man of him.
Give him something real to do
and he will not fritter his nervous
strength away in conviviality or
in degrading associations."
Thus, Jordan's approach to stu
dent conduct was based on a
faculty-student relationship that
would check adolescent tendencies
without having to rely upon a se
ries of rules, writes Korff. Jor
dan's approach "eschewed parietal
responsibilities and promoted in
timacy between student and
teacher in a pioneer atmosphere."
An 'authoritarian patrimony'
Although Jordan's system of
government sounds democratic,
the system was nonetheless an
"authoritarian patrimony" with
Jordan as the patriarch ruling at
times arbitrarily, according to
Korff.
Jordan's capricious views can
be seen in his interpetation and
use of the Standard. In a letter

to Stanford's Faculty Committee
on Student Affairs, which was re
sponsible for disciplining stu
dents, Jordan instructed the
committee to interpet the Stand
ard in the following manner:
"It is part of the duty of your
committee to eliminate unworthy
persons from the rolls of the Uni
versity classes. You have the au
thority to request the withdrawal
of any student whose presence for
any reason seems undesirable.
"It is desired that you should
exercise this authority not only
on those found guilty of specific
acts of immorality or of dis
honesty, but on any whose per
sonal influence is objectionable.
Those who are dissipated,
profligate, intemperate, tricky or
foul of tongue should be removed,
though no specific act of wrong
doing may be proved or charged
against them."
His actions reflected this phi
losophy, argues Korff. On one oc
casion Jordan fired, without any
sort of due process, an immensely
popular professor who criticized
University policy. The entire stu
dent body, though regretting the
dismissal of their beloved profes
sor, nonetheless signed a petition
supporting the president's deci
sion.
On another occasion both the
editors of The Daily Palo Alto,
the precursor to The Stanford
Daily, and the Chaparral were
suspended by Jordan for printing
material critical of University
policy At this time, The Daily was
not an independent newsaper. For
the most part, the student body
accepted the suspension without
question, according to Korff.

Popularity provides license
According to Korff, Jordan at
times ruled arbitrarily, because of
two factors: Jordan's own tremen
dous popularity and the loyal stu
dent body and faculty.
Jordan's popularity was so im
mense that he became the very
symbol of the University. Korff
writes that the University was but
a "lengthened shadow of Jordan."
Nilan concurs with Korffs as
sesment. "Jordan was enormously
popular. He was a very symbolic
center of Stanford life and spirit,"
said Nilan.
Jordan was able to foster a
"Stanford Spirit" by evoking the
idea of a "Stanford Family." The
Spirit demanded from the mem
bers of the Family, which included
faculty, students and alumni, to
do everything possible, even at
their own inconvenience, to
protect the good name of the Uni
versity, Korff writes.
The Spirit was a direct result
of the pioneering atmosphere that
pervaded the campus, Nilan said.
The University-fostered sense of
purpose commanded the loyalty
that provided the base for the
"Stanford Spirit," Nilan said.
Two additional factors helped
Jordan's ability to govern, accord
ing to Nilan. The relatively small,
homogenous nature of the Uni
versity led to respect for Jordan.
In 1891, the combined under
graduate and graduate population
was 413 students. In 1914 — the
year after Jordan left — that fig
ure rose to 1,972.'
Second, early Stanford students
had a greater sense of right and
wrong instilled in them than stu
dents today, said Nilan.
