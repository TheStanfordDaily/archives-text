## Learning English is vital 
### 
SPANISH NAMES ABOUND in Cal
ifornia, but for those who speak only
that language, life here is less than
idyllic. We live in Tall Tree, up Route
280 is Saint Francis, and our state capital
is Sacrament. The names don't sound as
romantic in our language, but we con
tinue to deprecate those who pronounce
them correctly in Spanish.
People who speak exclusively Spanish
in the United States limit themselves as
far as what heights they can reach, but
that doesn't change the facts. In our
neighboring East Palo Alto, there are
children who were born in this state who
speak only a few words of English.
In East Los Angeles, there are gangs
composed entirely of Spanish-speaking
boys. They cannot read English or un
derstand more than a few words impor
tant to their trade, but they do not
change. |IL ,| IWIUI
It is difficult to understand tTie men
tality that would keep a person in the
role of janitor or groundskeeper rather
than learn the language primary to their
adopted country, but it is possible.
I didn't take Spanish for six years so
that I could help those people. I've lived
in states bordering on Mexico my entire
life, and learning Spanish just seemed a
wise way of dealing with a fact of life.
During my senior year of high school,
though, I changed my mind. I started to
realize that I could use my language skills
for more than merely communicating
with the janitors at school.
My high school had a public service
program that encompassed all levels of
society. One program, though, stood out

as both the most hopeless and the most
inspired. It involved taking groups of 10
students to Tijuana for three weekends
each year. The students were expected to
help the homeless and impoverished in
Tijuana in various ways.
I was given the task of teaching math
not my best subject — to children
whose parents were dead or working away
from home. The school where 1 taught
consisted of a corrugated tin hut that
stood four feet high, seven tiny desks
that some U.S. school had donated and
a chalkboard from some child's toy chest.
The paper the children used had printing
on the other side, and usually the pencils
were just the nubs the children found
outside their school.
Finding throwaways was a way of life
for these children; they actually lived in
t he
days after school sifting through the gar
bage for aluminum, paper and glass. Two
ofi the children 1 taught were misSing
fingers beacause thay had been a little
careless in their searching.
The children lived in cardboard boxes
labeled "Bacardi" and "Kahlua." While 1
was there, I spent my days giving pig
gyback rides, wiping dirty faces and ask
ing about family life. I spent many of my
evenings crying.
When I got home, I had a new respect
for the Spanish-speakers who worked at
my school, and in my enthusiasm I tried
to help them, too. I offered to teach a
groundskeeper how to read English, and
he became angry with me. He said he

didn't need my help, that Spanish was
good enough for him, and that he knew
quite enough English to get hy.
I've met with the same response quite
a few times since then, but I can't help
believing that some day I'll get a more
positive one. It's a vicious circle that they
cannot get out of, and I am only begin
ning to understand how wound up in it
they are.
You begin, to speak the language of
your adopted country, and you begin to
forget what you went through to get
there. You cannot afford to forget, so
you don't try to change. Without change,
tfiougK la nTT-feal improvement. '
Whether they live in a dump in Tijuana
or a crime-clogged neighborhood in Los
Angeles, they cannot aspire to much if
they will not learn English. Those who
have can become anything, but it's hard
to leave language and culture behind. It
is a beautiful language, and the culture
was once as impressive as anything we
have created. Look at all the names we
have to remind us — San Francisco,
Sacramento, Los Angeles.
If only someone could help them gain
without losing all that. If only the vicious
circle could be broken.
