April 30, 1942
The Stanford Daily
Stanford held its first
practice blackout and disas
ter drill to test wartime ci
vilian defense on campus.
The drill simulated dis
asters on various parts of
campus, including the mock
destruction of the Lagunita
residence halls by an enemy
air raid.
Members of the Phi Delta
Theta Fraternity played
football on their front lawn
throughout the "disaster."
In the future, civil defense
leaders suggested, "The stu
dent body should get off the
street and get out of the way
of the defense workers."
April 24, 1967
The Stanford Daily
University President Wal
lace Sterling announced that
senior women had been
granted the right to live off
campus for the first time.
However, in the first year
of the policy, only 100
women would be allowed to
exercise this option.
Women not selected to live
off campus would have to
meet the University's
criteria to exercise the op
tion. In order to meet the
criteria, a woman had to pe
tition the Dean of Student
Affairs Office, and show she
was married, living with her
own family or had "compel
ling personal reasons which
justify a special arrange
ment."
