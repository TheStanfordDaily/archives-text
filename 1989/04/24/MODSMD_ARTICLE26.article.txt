# The 						time vacuum of treatment and rehabilitation
## Injured athletes must juggle therapy into routines 
### Evan Tuchinsky Senior staff writer 
Envision a sporting event. The
action is plentiful, the excitement
is building, the tension is ever
present.
Suddenly, an athlete is down.
Time-out is called as the coach
and trainer run out, checking the
condition of the fallen player.
More often than not, the player
will return to his feet, able to
continue.
Not this time — the injury is
serious. The athlete is escorted to
the sidelines, out of action for the
remainder of the game.
As athletics have grown more
intense, the above scene has be
come increasingly common. On
the college level especially, injury
is a fairly common occurrence
among athletes, a hidden burden
that persists long after the audi
ence ends its perfunctory applause
and turns its attention back to
the resuming contest.
Injuries — major and minor,
persistent or incidental — have a
profound impact on an athlete's
life. Aside from the physical
limitations an ailment imposes, a
host of psychological and practical
demands that continue until the
athlete returns to full-strength
make recuperation a real off-court
struggle.
"The time commitment for any
student is great, and the need for
time management is very signifi
cant for any student here to enjoy
all aspects of life," observed
Standley Scott, Stanford's head
athletic trainer. "When all of a
sudden they're injured, it throws
into that tight schedule another
thing that they're responsible to
take care of."

The time vacuum
After spraining her ankle in the
off-season last quarter, volleyball
player Jennifer Chaffee under
stands this responsibility well.
Her injury was far from career
ending, but was serious enough
to prompt daily visits to the Stan
ford Athletic Training Quarters
as well as modifications in her
lifestyle.
"I still have to go to practice,
so 1 don't get any time off from
that, and I do spend several hours
in the training room every day,"

Chaffee said. "Then there are ex
ercises at home, strengthening ex
ercises. If I were doing everything
that I should be doing, like I would
at the start of the season, it would
probably be three or four hours
a day extra."
Imagine a black hole sucking
three hours out of the middle of
every day, and the injured ath
lete's dilemma becomes clear.
Time, a commodity rare enough
under ordinary circumstances,
literally evaporates under the de
mands of medical care.

"We encourage the injured ath
lete to make as many visits in
here a day as they can afford to,
consistent with being a student,"
Scott said. "So for some people
it's one time a day, for others it's
10 times a day."
Home away from home
The specifics of these treat
ments, which tend to run from 30
to 4f> minutes, vary from injury
to injury, but the general trend
is the same. Heat is the most
oft-used therapy, generated by a
variety of means varying from

heating pads, electric stimulation
and ultrasound vibrations.
But the most noticeable com
mon denominator is the self
service nature of many treat
ments. Wherever possible, the
athlete is directly involved in the
therapy rather than a passive pa
tient.
"What's very typical in sports
medicine, at least in athletic train
ing, is a very aggressive, instruc
tional sort of thing: 'This is how
you can help yourself and be in
volved in your own treatment,' "
Scott said.
The reason for this philosophy
is logistical: On a daily basis, the
training room receives approxi
mately 500 visits from varsity ath
letes needing care ranging from
preventative ankle-taping to
rehabilitative physical therapy.
With such a crush of people,
the trainers simply do not have
the time to administer absolutely
attentive care. Every individual's
need is met, but the athletes are
encouraged to do as much as pos
sible.
Hut while the trainers may not
be able to devote much of their
time, the athlete always must.
The training room becomes an
other slot in the schedule, fitting
tightly in with classes and prac
tice.
Mike Matzek, a gymnast who
graduated last year, has had un
paralleled experience in this
regard. Under the physical
stresses he put on his body en
route to qualifying for the U.S.
National Team in 1988, Matzek
has injured most every part of
his body and has been the training
room's biggest customer.
Since his freshman year, when

on a regular basis, creating a synthetic exoskeleton of tape to support the straining joints.
rotator-cuff tendonitis struck his
shoulders, treatment became a
daily part of life, in addition to
continuing workouts.
"We had practice at 2:30, and
I would go into the training room
at about 1:00 and begin work on
my shoulders," Matzek said.
"Then after practice I would be
in there for an hour, and after
that I would have icebags on my
shoulders as I ate dinner. Then I
would try to ice them again in
the morning if I could, in between
classes.
"It was a serious drain of time,
and you just learn how to study
in the training room — which is
hard when there's a constant flow
of people in and out."
Exhaustion and exasperation
Aside from time, recovery puts
other demands on an athlete, both
physical and emotional. In the
rush to get the injury healed,
stamina and mental toughness are
put to the supreme test and may
falter under the strain.
Javelin thrower Erica Wheeler
experienced both of these prob
lems during her recovery from
shoulder surgery two years ago.
Injured at the start of the season,
she pushed herself to heal in time

to qualify for NCAA Champion
ships and paid a stern price.
"I was working within a time
crunch, and I remember being so
exhausted," Wheeler said.
"It was emotionally very ex
hausting, too. I felt I spent so
much energy dealing with coming
back . . . that it was really hard
for me to concentrate on my
studies or keep anything in bal
ance. Really, it took a lot out of
me.
The return
All things must come to an end,
and the rehabilitation process is
hardly an exception. Though there
is no set deadline, the trainers
eventually decide that an athlete
is healthy enough to return to
action.
The decision is not easy, and
according to Scott, is one of the
hardest things to determine. An
injury can be readily diagnosed,
but it is much harder to evaluate
overall fitness.
Toward this end, the sports
medicine staff has a set of criteria
to ascertain fitness — criteria in
dependent of coaches' demands or
expectations. Only when these re
quirements are met does a trainer
allow an athlete to return.
The first criterion is physical
readiness. If tests and exercises
show an athlete to be healed and
able to withstand the stresses of
competition, return is an allow

able option.
Harder to qualify is psycholog
ical readiness. Physical scars are
readily visible, but emotional set
backs are harder to find.
According to Scott, the psycho
logical factors are sometimes the
hardest to handle. Even when the
body is physiologically sound, fear
can prevent an athlete from re
peating the activity that caused
the pain and struggles.
"The first day I came back, I
was scared to death," Wheeler
confessed about her return to
javelin throwing. "I was scared to
throw the thing, because that
would tell mp if it was okay or if
it was not okay. So subconsciously
I was really reserved — I didn't
want to go all out, know how bad
it was."
For some athletes, the trepida
tion never wanes. Each year, a
few athletes disappear from the
varsity ranks when their fear of
returning becomes too great to
allow a comeback.
Most athletes fall in the middle
ground, remaining cautious but
able to compete at 100 percent.
Injuries plant themselves in
delibly on the subconscious as any
other trauma does, lingering and
subtly affecting the athlete's life.
"Sometimes that does affect
you," Chaffee agreed. "Last year,
Tracy Hughes and Teresa Smith
collided in mid-air at (volleyball)
practice, and both went down.

They bumped heads, and Tracy
was on the ground in shock.
"For the rest of the practice
and the next couple of days, we
were all really tentative going
after balls. Ever since then, if you
do come close to hitting somebody,
it flashes back to that, and you
do get a little tentative."
Prevention is the best cure
Injury may be a common oc
currence in athletics, but sporting
events are hardly accidents in the
making. With numerous advances
in safety equipment and training
techniques, many injuries can be
and are avoided on a daily basis.
For trainers, prevention is as
important as treatment, and their
energies are focused accordingly.
Most every athlete receives
preventative tapings on a regular
basis, creating a synthetic exo
skeleton of tape to support the
straining joints.
But, like many treatments, the
burden falls on the athlete's
shoulders, the person who knows
his own needs the best.
"Once you reach a certain level
in athletics, you begin to know
your body and take care of it, so
you learn preventative steps more
than anything," Matzek ex
plained. "That's why you see a
lot of athletes in the training room
with little injuries, but not nec
essarily one big thing because
they know how to prevent it."

as well as modifications in her
lifestyle.
"I still have to go to practice,
so 1 don't get any time off from
that, and I do spend several hours
in the training room every day,"

Chaffee said. "Then there are ex
ercises at home, strengthening ex
ercises. If I were doing everything
that I should be doing, like I would
at the start of the season, it would
probably be three or four hours
a day extra."
Imagine a black hole sucking
three hours out of the middle of
every day, and the injured ath
lete's dilemma becomes clear.
Time, a commodity rare enough
under ordinary circumstances,
literally evaporates under the de
mands of medical care.

"We encourage the injured ath
lete to make as many visits in
here a day as they can afford to,
consistent with being a student,"
Scott said. "So for some people
it's one time a day, for others it's
10 times a day."
Home away from home
The specifics of these treat
ments, which tend to run from 30
to 4f> minutes, vary from injury
to injury, but the general trend
is the same. Heat is the most
oft-used therapy, generated by a
variety of means varying from

heating pads, electric stimulation
and ultrasound vibrations.
But the most noticeable com
mon denominator is the self
service nature of many treat
ments. Wherever possible, the
athlete is directly involved in the
therapy rather than a passive pa
tient.
"What's very typical in sports
medicine, at least in athletic train
ing, is a very aggressive, instruc
tional sort of thing: 'This is how
you can help yourself and be in
volved in your own treatment,' "
Scott said.
The reason for this philosophy
is logistical: On a daily basis, the
training room receives approxi
mately 500 visits from varsity ath
letes needing care ranging from
preventative ankle-taping to
rehabilitative physical therapy.
With such a crush of people,
the trainers simply do not have
the time to administer absolutely
attentive care. Every individual's
need is met, but the athletes are
encouraged to do as much as pos
sible.
Hut while the trainers may not
be able to devote much of their
time, the athlete always must.
The training room becomes an
other slot in the schedule, fitting
tightly in with classes and prac
tice.
Mike Matzek, a gymnast who
graduated last year, has had un
paralleled experience in this
regard. Under the physical
stresses he put on his body en
route to qualifying for the U.S.
National Team in 1988, Matzek
has injured most every part of
his body and has been the training
room's biggest customer.
Since his freshman year, when

Trainer Dake Walden tapes the ankle of a Stanford athlete. Most athletes receive preventative tapings
on a regular basis, creating a synthetic exoskeleton of tape to support the straining joints.
rotator-cuff tendonitis struck his
shoulders, treatment became a
daily part of life, in addition to
continuing workouts.
"We had practice at 2:30, and
I would go into the training room
at about 1:00 and begin work on
my shoulders," Matzek said.
"Then after practice I would be
in there for an hour, and after
that I would have icebags on my
shoulders as I ate dinner. Then I
would try to ice them again in
the morning if I could, in between
classes.
"It was a serious drain of time,
and you just learn how to study
in the training room — which is
hard when there's a constant flow
of people in and out."
Exhaustion and exasperation
Aside from time, recovery puts
other demands on an athlete, both
physical and emotional. In the
rush to get the injury healed,
stamina and mental toughness are
put to the supreme test and may
falter under the strain.
Javelin thrower Erica Wheeler
experienced both of these prob
lems during her recovery from
shoulder surgery two years ago.
Injured at the start of the season,
she pushed herself to heal in time

to qualify for NCAA Champion
ships and paid a stern price.
"I was working within a time
crunch, and I remember being so
exhausted," Wheeler said.
"It was emotionally very ex
hausting, too. I felt I spent so
much energy dealing with coming
back . . . that it was really hard
for me to concentrate on my
studies or keep anything in bal
ance. Really, it took a lot out of
me.
The return
All things must come to an end,
and the rehabilitation process is
hardly an exception. Though there
is no set deadline, the trainers
eventually decide that an athlete
is healthy enough to return to
action.
The decision is not easy, and
according to Scott, is one of the
hardest things to determine. An
injury can be readily diagnosed,
but it is much harder to evaluate
overall fitness.
Toward this end, the sports
medicine staff has a set of criteria
to ascertain fitness — criteria in
dependent of coaches' demands or
expectations. Only when these re
quirements are met does a trainer
allow an athlete to return.
The first criterion is physical
readiness. If tests and exercises
show an athlete to be healed and
able to withstand the stresses of
competition, return is an allow

able option.
Harder to qualify is psycholog
ical readiness. Physical scars are
readily visible, but emotional set
backs are harder to find.
According to Scott, the psycho
logical factors are sometimes the
hardest to handle. Even when the
body is physiologically sound, fear
can prevent an athlete from re
peating the activity that caused
the pain and struggles.
"The first day I came back, I
was scared to death," Wheeler
confessed about her return to
javelin throwing. "I was scared to
throw the thing, because that
would tell mp if it was okay or if
it was not okay. So subconsciously
I was really reserved — I didn't
want to go all out, know how bad
it was."
For some athletes, the trepida
tion never wanes. Each year, a
few athletes disappear from the
varsity ranks when their fear of
returning becomes too great to
allow a comeback.
Most athletes fall in the middle
ground, remaining cautious but
able to compete at 100 percent.
Injuries plant themselves in
delibly on the subconscious as any
other trauma does, lingering and
subtly affecting the athlete's life.
"Sometimes that does affect
you," Chaffee agreed. "Last year,
Tracy Hughes and Teresa Smith
collided in mid-air at (volleyball)
practice, and both went down.

They bumped heads, and Tracy
was on the ground in shock.
"For the rest of the practice
and the next couple of days, we
were all really tentative going
after balls. Ever since then, if you
do come close to hitting somebody,
it flashes back to that, and you
do get a little tentative."
Prevention is the best cure
Injury may be a common oc
currence in athletics, but sporting
events are hardly accidents in the
making. With numerous advances
in safety equipment and training
techniques, many injuries can be
and are avoided on a daily basis.
For trainers, prevention is as
important as treatment, and their
energies are focused accordingly.
Most every athlete receives
preventative tapings on a regular
basis, creating a synthetic exo
skeleton of tape to support the
straining joints.
But, like many treatments, the
burden falls on the athlete's
shoulders, the person who knows
his own needs the best.
"Once you reach a certain level
in athletics, you begin to know
your body and take care of it, so
you learn preventative steps more
than anything," Matzek ex
plained. "That's why you see a
lot of athletes in the training room
with little injuries, but not nec
essarily one big thing because
they know how to prevent it."

Envision a sporting event. The
action is plentiful, the excitement
is building, the tension is ever
present.
Suddenly, an athlete is down.
Time-out is called as the coach
and trainer run out, checking the
condition of the fallen player.
More often than not, the player
will return to his feet, able to
continue.
Not this time — the injury is
serious. The athlete is escorted to
the sidelines, out of action for the
remainder of the game.
As athletics have grown more
intense, the above scene has be
come increasingly common. On
the college level especially, injury
is a fairly common occurrence
among athletes, a hidden burden
that persists long after the audi
ence ends its perfunctory applause
and turns its attention back to
the resuming contest.
Injuries — major and minor,
persistent or incidental — have a
profound impact on an athlete's
life. Aside from the physical
limitations an ailment imposes, a
host of psychological and practical
demands that continue until the
athlete returns to full-strength
make recuperation a real off-court
struggle.
"The time commitment for any
student is great, and the need for
time management is very signifi
cant for any student here to enjoy
all aspects of life," observed
Standley Scott, Stanford's head
athletic trainer. "When all of a

into that tight schedule another
thing that they're responsible to
take care of."

After spraining her ankle in the
off-season last quarter, volleyball
player Jennifer Chaffee under

is logistical: On a daily basis, the
training room receives approxi
mately 500 visits from varsity ath
letes needing care ranging from
preventative ankle-taping to
rehabilitative physical therapy.
With such a crush of people,
the trainers simply do not have
the time to administer absolutely
attentive care. Every individual's
need is met, but the athletes are
encouraged to do as much as pos
sible.
Hut while the trainers may not
be able to devote much of their
time, the athlete always must.
The training room becomes an
other slot in the schedule, fitting
tightly in with classes and prac
tice.
Mike Matzek, a gymnast who
graduated last year, has had un
paralleled experience in this
regard. Under the physical
stresses he put on his body en
route to qualifying for the U.S.
National Team in 1988, Matzek
has injured most every part of
his body and has been the training
room's biggest customer.
Since his freshman year, when

rotator-cuff tendonitis struck his
shoulders, treatment became a
daily part of life, in addition to
continuing workouts.
"We had practice at 2:30, and
I would go into the training room
at about 1:00 and begin work on
my shoulders," Matzek said.
"Then after practice I would be
in there for an hour, and after
that I would have icebags on my
shoulders as I ate dinner. Then I
would try to ice them again in
the morning if I could, in between
classes.
"It was a serious drain of time,
and you just learn how to study
in the training room — which is
hard when there's a constant flow
of people in and out."
Exhaustion and exasperation
Aside from time, recovery puts
other demands on an athlete, both
physical and emotional. In the
rush to get the injury healed,
stamina and mental toughness are
put to the supreme test and may
falter under the strain.
Javelin thrower Erica Wheeler
experienced both of these prob
lems during her recovery from
shoulder surgery two years ago.
Injured at the start of the season,
she pushed herself to heal in time

to qualify for NCAA Champion
ships and paid a stern price.
"I was working within a time
crunch, and I remember being so
exhausted," Wheeler said.
"It was emotionally very ex
hausting, too. I felt I spent so
much energy dealing with coming
back . . . that it was really hard
for me to concentrate on my
studies or keep anything in bal
ance. Really, it took a lot out of
me.
The return
All things must come to an end,
and the rehabilitation process is
hardly an exception. Though there
is no set deadline, the trainers
eventually decide that an athlete
is healthy enough to return to
action.
The decision is not easy, and
according to Scott, is one of the
hardest things to determine. An
injury can be readily diagnosed,
but it is much harder to evaluate
overall fitness.
Toward this end, the sports
medicine staff has a set of criteria
to ascertain fitness — criteria in
dependent of coaches' demands or
expectations. Only when these re
quirements are met does a trainer
allow an athlete to return.
The first criterion is physical
readiness. If tests and exercises
show an athlete to be healed and
able to withstand the stresses of
competition, return is an allow

able option.
Harder to qualify is psycholog
ical readiness. Physical scars are
readily visible, but emotional set
backs are harder to find.
According to Scott, the psycho
logical factors are sometimes the
hardest to handle. Even when the
body is physiologically sound, fear
can prevent an athlete from re
peating the activity that caused
the pain and struggles.
"The first day I came back, I
was scared to death," Wheeler
confessed about her return to
javelin throwing. "I was scared to
throw the thing, because that
would tell mp if it was okay or if
it was not okay. So subconsciously
I was really reserved — I didn't
want to go all out, know how bad
it was."
For some athletes, the trepida
tion never wanes. Each year, a
few athletes disappear from the
varsity ranks when their fear of
returning becomes too great to
allow a comeback.
Most athletes fall in the middle
ground, remaining cautious but
able to compete at 100 percent.
Injuries plant themselves in
delibly on the subconscious as any
other trauma does, lingering and
subtly affecting the athlete's life.
"Sometimes that does affect
you," Chaffee agreed. "Last year,
Tracy Hughes and Teresa Smith
collided in mid-air at (volleyball)
practice, and both went down.

They bumped heads, and Tracy
was on the ground in shock.
"For the rest of the practice
and the next couple of days, we
were all really tentative going
after balls. Ever since then, if you
do come close to hitting somebody,
it flashes back to that, and you
do get a little tentative."
Prevention is the best cure
Injury may be a common oc
currence in athletics, but sporting
events are hardly accidents in the
making. With numerous advances
in safety equipment and training
techniques, many injuries can be
and are avoided on a daily basis.
For trainers, prevention is as
important as treatment, and their
energies are focused accordingly.
Most every athlete receives
preventative tapings on a regular
basis, creating a synthetic exo
skeleton of tape to support the
straining joints.
But, like many treatments, the
burden falls on the athlete's
shoulders, the person who knows
his own needs the best.
"Once you reach a certain level
in athletics, you begin to know
your body and take care of it, so
you learn preventative steps more
than anything," Matzek ex
plained. "That's why you see a
lot of athletes in the training room
with little injuries, but not nec
essarily one big thing because
they know how to prevent it."

physical therapy.
Envision a sporting event. The
action is plentiful, the excitement
is building, the tension is ever
present.
Suddenly, an athlete is down.
Time-out is called as the coach
and trainer run out, checking the
condition of the fallen player.
More often than not, the player
will return to his feet, able to
continue.
Not this time — the injury is
serious. The athlete is escorted to
the sidelines, out of action for the
remainder of the game.
As athletics have grown more
intense, the above scene has be
come increasingly common. On
the college level especially, injury
is a fairly common occurrence
among athletes, a hidden burden
that persists long after the audi
ence ends its perfunctory applause
and turns its attention back to
the resuming contest.
Injuries — major and minor,
persistent or incidental — have a
profound impact on an athlete's
life. Aside from the physical
limitations an ailment imposes, a
host of psychological and practical
demands that continue until the
athlete returns to full-strength
make recuperation a real off-court
struggle.
"The time commitment for any
student is great, and the need for
time management is very signifi
cant for any student here to enjoy
all aspects of life," observed
Standley Scott, Stanford's head
athletic trainer. "When all of a
sudden they're injured, it throws
into that tight schedule another
thing that they're responsible to
take care of."

The time vacuum
After spraining her ankle in the
off-season last quarter, volleyball
player Jennifer Chaffee under
stands this responsibility well.
Her injury was far from career
ending, but was serious enough
to prompt daily visits to the Stan
ford Athletic Training Quarters
as well as modifications in her
lifestyle.
"I still have to go to practice,
so 1 don't get any time off from
that, and I do spend several hours
in the training room every day,"

Chaffee said. "Then there are ex
ercises at home, strengthening ex
ercises. If I were doing everything
that I should be doing, like I would
at the start of the season, it would
probably be three or four hours
a day extra."
Imagine a black hole sucking
three hours out of the middle of
every day, and the injured ath
lete's dilemma becomes clear.
Time, a commodity rare enough
under ordinary circumstances,
literally evaporates under the de
mands of medical care.

"We encourage the injured ath
lete to make as many visits in
here a day as they can afford to,
consistent with being a student,"
Scott said. "So for some people
it's one time a day, for others it's
10 times a day."
Home away from home
The specifics of these treat
ments, which tend to run from 30
to 4f> minutes, vary from injury
to injury, but the general trend
is the same. Heat is the most
oft-used therapy, generated by a
variety of means varying from

heating pads, electric stimulation
and ultrasound vibrations.
But the most noticeable com
mon denominator is the self
service nature of many treat
ments. Wherever possible, the
athlete is directly involved in the
therapy rather than a passive pa
tient.
"What's very typical in sports
medicine, at least in athletic train
ing, is a very aggressive, instruc
tional sort of thing: 'This is how
you can help yourself and be in
volved in your own treatment,' "
Scott said.
