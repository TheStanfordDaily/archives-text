# The
						time vacuum of treatment and rehabilitation
## Injured athletes must juggle therapy into routines 
### Evan Tuchinsky Senior staff writer 
Envision a sporting event. The
action is plentiful, the excitement
is building, the tension is ever
present.
Suddenly, an athlete is down.
Time-out is called as the coach
and trainer run out, checking the
condition of the fallen player.
More often than not, the player
will return to his feet, able to
continue.
Not this time — the injury is
serious. The athlete is escorted to
the sidelines, out of action for the
remainder of the game.
As athletics have grown more
intense, the above scene has be
come increasingly common. On
the college level especially, injury
is a fairly common occurrence
among athletes, a hidden burden
that persists long after the audi
ence ends its perfunctory applause
and turns its attention back to
the resuming contest.
Injuries — major and minor,
persistent or incidental — have a
profound impact on an athlete's
life. Aside from the physical
limitations an ailment imposes, a
host of psychological and practical
demands that continue until the
athlete returns to full-strength
make recuperation a real off-court
struggle.
"The time commitment for any
student is great, and the need for
time management is very signifi
cant for any student here to enjoy
all aspects of life," observed
Standley Scott, Stanford's head
athletic trainer. "When all of a
sudden they're injured, it throws
into that tight schedule another
thing that they're responsible to
take care of."

The time vacuum
After spraining her ankle in the
off-season last quarter, volleyball
player Jennifer Chaffee under
stands this responsibility well.
Her injury was far from career
ending, but was serious enough
to prompt daily visits to the Stan
ford Athletic Training Quarters
as well as modifications in her
lifestyle.
"I still have to go to practice,
so 1 don't get any time off from
that, and I do spend several hours
in the training room every day,"

Chaffee said. "Then there are ex
ercises at home, strengthening ex
ercises. If I were doing everything
that I should be doing, like I would
at the start of the season, it would
probably be three or four hours
a day extra."
Imagine a black hole sucking
three hours out of the middle of
every day, and the injured ath
lete's dilemma becomes clear.
Time, a commodity rare enough
under ordinary circumstances,
literally evaporates under the de
mands of medical care.

"We encourage the injured ath
lete to make as many visits in
here a day as they can afford to,
consistent with being a student,"
Scott said. "So for some people
it's one time a day, for others it's
10 times a day."
Home away from home
The specifics of these treat
ments, which tend to run from 30
to 4f> minutes, vary from injury
to injury, but the general trend
is the same. Heat is the most
oft-used therapy, generated by a
variety of means varying from

heating pads, electric stimulation
and ultrasound vibrations.
But the most noticeable com
mon denominator is the self
service nature of many treat
ments. Wherever possible, the
athlete is directly involved in the
therapy rather than a passive pa
tient.
"What's very typical in sports
medicine, at least in athletic train
ing, is a very aggressive, instruc
tional sort of thing: 'This is how
you can help yourself and be in
volved in your own treatment,' "
Scott said.
The reason for this philosophy
is logistical: On a daily basis, the
training room receives approxi
mately 500 visits from varsity ath
letes needing care ranging from
preventative ankle-taping to
rehabilitative physical therapy.
With such a crush of people,
the trainers simply do not have
the time to administer absolutely
attentive care. Every individual's
need is met, but the athletes are
encouraged to do as much as pos
sible.
Hut while the trainers may not
be able to devote much of their
time, the athlete always must.
The training room becomes an
other slot in the schedule, fitting
tightly in with classes and prac
tice.
Mike Matzek, a gymnast who
graduated last year, has had un
paralleled experience in this
regard. Under the physical
stresses he put on his body en
route to qualifying for the U.S.
National Team in 1988, Matzek
has injured most every part of
his body and has been the training
room's biggest customer.
Since his freshman year, when

Trainer Dake Walden tapes the ankle of a Stanford athlete. Most athletes receive preventative tapings
on a regular basis, creating a synthetic exoskeleton of tape to support the straining joints.
