## Surging men's tennis knocks off No. 1 UCLA, USC 
### Cameron Macky Senior staff writer 
Tennis fans were peering over walls, fences, and
each other this weekend, trying to get a glimpse of
the Stanford men's tennis team's sold-out shows
against No. 7 USC and No. 1 UCLA.
Those lucky enough to get into the Stanford Tennis
Stadium — along with the bleacher bums near the
hack courts and the fence-climbers — were witness
to a virtuoso performance put on by the Cardinal,
which avenged two earlier losses while sending a
message to the collegiate tennis world that the race
for the NCAA team title is far from over.

On Friday, the fans who didn't pay to see the
Cardinal-Trojan matchup, choosing instead to check
out the action from the backcourt bleachers, actually
had a better — and longer — view of the match
than the paying customers. The top three matches,
held in front of the reserved stadium seats, certainly
had their share of excitement, but couldn't even
come close to matching the tension and drama of
the fourth, fifth and sixth contests.
Jeff Tarango and Martin Blackman made short
work of their opponents, each romping to a two-set
win. Tarango's 6-3, 6-1 thrashing of .Greg Failla
made Failla look like a junior-level player — which
actually isn't that hard to do, considering Failla
weighs maybe 120 pounds.
Failla, who has lost only twice in Pac-10 play,
normally plays No. 2 for USC, while Byron Black
is the regular No. 1 player. With the two switching
roles Saturday, the teams split the top two matches
after Black scored a 6-4, 6-4 win over Jeff Cathrall,
who is still nursing a sore left wrist. Blackman put
the Cardinal up 2-1 with his 7-6, 6-1 working of
Eric Amend.
The stadium matches were over, but things were
just beginning to heat up on the back courts. Several
hundred members of the paying crowd migrated
from their seats to the back side of the stadium,
lining up two and three deep along the walls, stairs,
and press lev°l in order to see what was going on.
What thev saw were three Stanford comebacks.
The Cardinal's fourth, fifth and sixth players, not
used to being in the spotlight, responded by giving
the crowd — and USC — a lesson in determination.
At No. 4, Alex O'Brien had taken the first set
6-2 from Donnie Isaak, but then fell victim to 1)
the O'Brien tendency to become comatose after
taking a one-set lead; 2) an array of spectacular
shots from Isaak; and 3) O'Brien's sore right shoul
der, which turned his normally uninspiring serve
into a wounded duck that cried "Please, please,
break me."
Isaak complied, and rode the strength of his
rejuvenated groundstrokes to a 6-2 second-set win.
'I started rushing my shots, and just let him into
the match," O'Brien said. "I didn't play a smart
second set at all."
O'Brien woke up at the start of the third. His
serve was still off, but he more than made up for

it by breaking Isaak twice to go up 5-3. Without a
strong serve, however, 5-3 can quickly become 5-6,
as Isaak came storming back. O'Brien then held
serve to force the match into a tiebreaker. He took
the first three points and didn't look back, winning
6-2, 2-6, 7-6.
Glenn Solomon had finished up only moments
before, defeating Andy Olypant 3-6, 6-1, 6-4. At two
games apiece in the final s6t, Solomon blew a 3-0
lead and was broken ("I was pretty p ," he said
later) and then dropped the next game at love. That
was the last game Olypant would win, though, as
Solomon broke back twice to close out the match.
It was Barry Richards who provided the most
stirring comeback. Down 5-7, 0-4 to Murphy Jensen
at No. 6, Richards started his uphill climb. A break
and two service holds got him to 3-4. A forehand
crosscourt shot then sent Jensen sprawling, and
moments later Richards had broken again to make
it 4-4. The bleacher fans, already raucous before
the comeback, were going crazy, and Richards was
on fire.
"I felt really confident, and the crowd helped a
lot," Richards said. "Once I got to four-all, I felt
there was no way I could lose." He was right. Jensen
went meekly, 5-7, 6-4, 6-2, -and the Cardinal had
more than repaid the Trojans for USC's 5-4 win
two weeks ago.
The trend toward tight three-set matches contin
ued the next day against UCLA, who came into the
match at 24-1, riding a 16-match win streak. For
a change, all six matches were played on the stadium
courts — good news for paying customers, but bad
for the bleacher crew.
Blackman gave the Cardinal an early lead with
his 4-6, 6-3, 7-5 victory at No. 3 against Pat
Galbraith. In the third set, Blackman was broken
early and was down 5-3 before taking charge.
Galbraith scored all of four points in the match's
final three games, as Blackman sandwiched a service
game at love between two breaks.
Cathrall also had come back from one set down,
but fell apart in the third against Brian Garrow,
who pounded Cathrall 6-3, 1-6, 6-0.
At No. 1, Tarango and Buff (yes, it's his given
name) Farrow were busy exchanging service breaks.
Farrow broke first and was up 4-1 in the first set,
but double-faulted on break point to let Tarango
get to 4-3.
The double fault was the first of many, some at
decidedly inopportune times. Although Farrow took
the first set 6-4, he double-faulted on a break point
early in the second, and then, with Tarango holding
a set point, the Bruins' No. 1 player handed the
set over, putting both his service attempts in the net.
Tarango didn't exactly need Farrow's charity. The
Cardinal junior was putting on his usual show of
forehand heaters and backhand curves, frustrating
Farrow at every turn. Lip 5-2 in the final set,
Tarango was receiving serve down three points to
two.
After — you guessed it — a double-fault, Farrow
charged to the net behind his serve. He hit a weak
volley, and then stood helplessly watching as
Tarango blew a forehand right between his ankles.
Thank you, Buff: 4-6, 6-3, 6-2.
