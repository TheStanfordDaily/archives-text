# Cardinal nine manages only one victory against Bruins
## 
### Robert Portnoy Senior staff writer 
Beating the oncoming rain, a
streaking opponent and its own
disappointment, the Cardinal nine
edged UCLA 3-1 yesterday at
soggy Sunken Diamond.
A brilliant performance from
ace Steve Chitren (5-3) helped
Stanford avert a three-game
sweep and cling to only the
faintest glimmer of hope for post
season play.

Cardinal drops series to Bruins

The Cardinal now stands at 21-
25, 8-16 in the Pacific 10 Confer
ence Southern Division. UCLA
slipped to 21-24, 9-15 in the Six-
Pac and two games behind third
place USC. Stanford holds down
fifth, a game ahead of doormat
California.
"I'm really proud of our guys.
It's good to show your true colors
when things haven't been going
well," Stanford Coach Mark Mar
quess said.
Chitren tossed a three-hitter at
the befuddled Bruins, going the
route for the second time this
season. His last complete game
prevented a sweep by Arizona in
Tucson in early March.
Chitren usually lives and dies
with his exceptional slider, but
yesterday the "breaker" was in
visible in the early innings.
"I struggled with my breaking
ball the first couple innings. It
wasn't really sharp. I made a little
adjustment with my arm angle
and was able to throw it for
strikes. I stayed over the top of
[the ball) instead of wrapping
around it,"he said.
While conducting the search for
his slider, Chitren depended
largely on his fastball to hold
UCLA in check.
"I had a really good live fastball
today. It was moving and I was
able to locate it really well in and
out," he said.
Chitren fanned seven while
walking four. Only three Bruins
advanced past first all day.
The Cardinal scored all the runs
it would need in the fourth off
UCLA starter Scott Schanz (2-9).
A leadoff walk to Paul Carey
was followed by a line single to

left from Troy Paulsen. David
Holbrook ripped a single to left
and Carey barreled in from sec
ond, knocking Bruin catcher Paul
Ellis out of the game, knocking
the ball out Ellis' glove and
staking Stanford to a 1-0 lead.
Jack Hollis hit a chopper to sec
ond and UCLA's Mannie Adams
booted it, scoring Paulsen and
sending Holbrook to third.
Holbrook trotted home on David
McCarty's double-play grounder
for the Cardinal's third and final
run.
Friday's difficult loss was the
key to the series. Cardinal starter
Stan Spencer (2-7) pitched mag
nificently — allowing just two
runs on four hits thourgh nine
innings — but got no support in
a 2-1 loss.
Stanford stranded 11 runners
in all and could muster but one
big hit — Carey's RBI double to
plate Frank Carey in the third.
Epitomizing the Cardinal's frus
tration, Roger Burnett narrowly
missed giving his club a 2-1 lead
in the fifth when his long blast
to left hooked just foul.
By contrast, UCLA's David Tok
heim received an early Christmas
gift — compliments of Easton —
in the top of the sixth. His op
posity field poke eeked over the
wall in left for a 2-1 Bruin lead.
Stanford did mount rallies in
both the seventh and ninth in
nings, but each fell one base hit
short.
Steve Solomon singled tu right
to start the seventh and Eric Cox
followed with a walk. Frank Carey
executed a perfect sacrifice bunt
to put the Cardinal in business.
Burnett wasted his opportunity,
popping to the catcher for the sec
ond out. Paul Carey — Stanford's
top run-producer — then stepped
to the plate.
Just as he would in the ninth,
Carey tantilized his teammates
and the crowd with a deep drive
that looked like a homer from the
crack of the bat. In the seventh,
his shot to left died on the warn
ing track for out three. In the
ninth, with two out and men on
first and second, Carey sent a tow
ering drive to right that brought
everyone to their feet. But this
one fell at the base of the wall
and Spencer's gem went for
naught.
Saturday's 9-6 loss marked the
return to action of Stanford's top

starter Mike Mussina. He had
been sidelined since March 3 with
a strained tendon in his right el
bow.
Paul Carey gave the Cardinal
a 4-0 lead in the third with a
grand slam homerun to deep right
field, and "Moose" held the
Bruins scoreless through four in
nings. But the Bruins got to him
in the fifth, tallying four runs on
four hits. Mussina exited with one

out and the bases empty after
back-to-back homers by Kevin
Webb and Mike Hankins, UCLA's
eighth- and ninth-place hitters.
"Wo had Mussina set for 75
pitches. We came close to getting
that without getting touched up.
He's a little stiff and sore," Car
dinal pitching Coach Tom Dunton
said.
Before the damage was done,
the Bruins had tallied six in the

inning and the Cardinal never re
covered, falling behind 9-4 before
scoring twice in the eighth. Steve
Worrell (2-2) relieved Mussina in
the fifth, lasted a third of an in
ning and absorbed the loss.
Mussina's elbow will be
evaluated on Tuesday and Wed
nesday. If he is still experiencing
pain, he likely will not pitch next
weekend at home against league
'eader Arizona.
