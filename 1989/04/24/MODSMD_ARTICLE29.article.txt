# Spencer keeps up the faith

As if to personify this year's
vexing baseball season, Stan Spen
cer pitched a four-hit, complete
game on Friday against UCLA —
and lost 2-1.
"It's real frustrating, but you
try not to let it bother you. It's
been a whole team thing this
season," Spencer said. He has of
ten been the victim of little offen
sive support from his teammates
this season, and has struggled to
a record of 2-7.
Hut Spencer does not let his
less-than-stellar record get him
down. "He's pretty steady out
there. He's very objective and he
works very hard. He's one of the
best conditioned pitchers I have,
and that's 'saving a lot because
we have a lot of well-conditioned
pitchers," Stanford Asst. Coach
Tom Dunton said.
Spencer gave up two runs
against the Bruins, including a
fatal home run to David Tokheim,
which scored the game winner.
In his nine innings work, Spen
cer struck out seven and walked
only one. Of his 113 pitches, only
26 were balls.
In the late innings of the game,
Spencer wont to his changeup
quite often, a pitch he rarely used
while going 7-2 last season. The
changeup is the kind of pitch that
looks great to a hitter coming
down the pipe, but usually makes
him look foolish when and if he
makes contact because he is way
out in front of it. The result is
often a harmless fly ball or a weak
grounder.
"It helps keep your pitch count
down because a lot of guys swing
at it more. It's become a good
pitch for me," Spencer said.
According to Stanford catcher
Eric Cox, who was Spencer's back
stop for the first seven innings,
Sprncer threw hard in the early
going, using his fastball to got
batters out.
"When he spots his fastball, he
does well and he wins With him
it's not a matter of velocity, but
[of placement]," Cox said. "We
used the changeup early but he
was having trouble with it."
"He usually spots (lie ball real
Avell — a lot of "pitchers tire afraid
to throw it up and in-" because
they're afraid they might hit the
guy, but Stan isn't afraid to throw
there when I call a pitch up and

in,"he added.
With Mike Mussina out because
of an injury, Spencer has assumed
the role of Stanford's No. 1
starter, and his sub-.500 record
belies his skills on the hill. This
is the same pitcher who threw
seven innings in the final game
of last year!* College World Series
•against Arizona State.
And if Stanford ends its frus
tration in the postseason this
year, Spencer will be playing a
leading role once again.
