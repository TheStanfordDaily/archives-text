When the Stanford Cardinal met USC's Women of
Troy in Los Angeles three weeks ago, (Monday Night
hootball highlights music) Stanford star Tami Whit
linger overcame a severe stomach illness and USC's
hard-hitting Trisha Laux in recording one of the
most amazing comeback wins in the history of col
legiate tennis.
Whitlinger's victory was the key as Stanford pulled
out a tense 6-3 win.
Today, in the rematch at the Stanford Tennis
Stadium, the Cardinal puts its perfect 22-0 record
on the line. For Laux and her teammates, no revenge
could be sweeter than to hand Stanford its first loss
of the year.
Ladies and gentlemen, fasten your seat belts. This
should be a good one.

Women's Tennis
Cardinal 5, Women of Troy 1

It was a good one, indeed. No, not at No. 1 where
Whitlinger dominated Laux and scored a 6-3, 6-2
victory, but at No. 6 where Kylie Johnson played
the match of her career in downing Caroline
Kuhlman 5-7, 7-6 (7-3), 6-3. That win guaranteed
Stanford a Pacific 10 Conference Southern Division
championship and upped the squad's record to 23-0,
8-0 in Pac-10 play.
USC fell to 15-6, 6-4 in the conference.
Early in the day, it seemed like there wouldn't
be any tennis at all. Rain delayed the start of the
match by two hours and just 75 minutes into the
action — with none of the singles finished — the
heavens opened again.
The match wasn't called off entirely, as the rain
stopped quickly. After a delay to squeegee the courts
dry, play was once again underway about an hour

and 15 minutes from when it was suspended.
Johnson returned to the court trailing 5-6 in the
first set with Kuhlman serving at deuce.
Quickly, USC's former No. 1 player scored two
points to capture the set. Kuhlman — once the top
player in the nation, and the last collegian to beat
Stanford legend Patty Fendick (in a dual-meet April
19, 1986 played at Stanford while Kuhlman was
26-0), before undergoing surgery on both knees —
appeared to be in control.
Stanford Asst. Coach Lele Farood saw it differ
ently. She told Johnson that with the first set over
so quickly after play resumed, it was "like a whole
new match."
"I came out and lost those two points really fast,"
Johnson recalled. "I thought 'I lost to her down at
USC. I can't do it again.' "
What was Johnson's plan for overcoming the
savvy Kuhlman? "I started taking her balls really
early (and) being aggressive," Johnson said.
Said Farood: "I told her the same thing we told
her last time: The longer she's out there, the better
off you are" since Kuhlman's knees would get
weaker.
Whatever the particulars, the strategy worked
like a charm. After getting down 0-2, Johnson reeled
off five straight wins and led 5-2. "Then I did a
nice little choke job," Johnson said.

That "choke job" allowed Kuhlman to turn the
deficit into a 6-5 lead and a chance to serve for the
match.
On the first point, Johnson ripped off a volley
for a winner then followed up with a scoring back
hand. Kuhlman cut it to 15-30 and was serving to

tie the game.
But she missed the first serve — a failing that
plagued her throughout the match — and Johnson
blew a forehand by her. Kuhlman made it 30-40,

giving her another chance to draw
even.
Johnson came to the net on the
next play and hit several sharp
volleys in a row, but Kuhlman
moved well and returned them
all. All but one. Johnson had the
break and it was time for a tie
breaker.
"Once 1 got to the tiebreaker,
it was my set," Johnson said, add
ing that it's been a long time since
she's lost one.
In the breaker, each player
scored on serve through five
points. Trailing 3-2, Kuhlman
then failed to score on both her
serves giving Johnson a com
manding 5-2 lead. The Stanford
freshman capitalized and took the
tiebreak 7-3.
At that point Johnson had not
only shown an ability to break
Kuhlman's serve, she had appar
ently broken Kuhlman's spirit.
"I got really tired," Kuhlman
said. But the veteran made no
excuses. "She didn't miss a ball;
she played unbelievably."
Said Farood: "[Kyliel started to
really look more confident." And
played like it.
Johnson broke Kuhlman to
open the set and followed that by
holding serve. And what a serve
it was. Oftentimes dazzling,
Johnson combined it with a devas
tating forehand and went in for
the kill.
Leading 2-1, Johnson came up
with another sensational service
game — including an ace — to
hold again. She then became con
tent to judiciously use her back
hand to set up the forehand. The
tactic yielded a number of

forehand winners and provided
Johnson with a 5-1 lead.
After one particularly impres
sive Johnson groundstroke,
Kuhlman shouted: "Where are
you getting all these shots!"
Wherever it was, Johnson had
a couple more. Kuhlman had cut
the lead to 5-3 — fighting off two
match points at 5-2 — and was
serving to draw even nearer. But
Johnson had a different idea.
Kuhlman made an unforced er
ror on the game's first point.
Johnson followed that with a
monster service return and then
forced Kuhlman into another er
ror.
Johnson then had three more
match points. Kuhlman hit a pow
erful serve to save the first one
before Johnson just settled in and
waited patiently for the clincher.
After a long rally during which
neither player took any chances,
Johnson got Kuhlman out of po
sition, ripped off a backhand win
ner and sewed up the win.
Johnson celebrated, acknowl
edged the crowd who had moved
to the bleachers outside Court 7
to cheer her on, and barely had
a chance to get to shelter before
—■ believe it or not — it started
to pour more heavily than it had
all day.
The torrential rounds brought
the No. 2 and 3 doubles to an
immediate close and ended a dra
matic day in perfect Hollywood
fashion.
At No. 2, Sandra Birch dissected
Stephanie London 6-2, 6-1. Lisa
Green was upended by Lupita
Novelo, 6-0, 7-6 at No. 3.
Freshman Debbie Graham re
mained undefeated with a power
ful 6-2, 6-2 trouncing of Anya
Kochoff. Teri Whitlinger displayed
superb athleticism in burying
Ginny Purdv 7-5, 6-0.

Johnson returned to the court trailing 5-6 in the
first set with Kuhlman serving at deuce.
Quickly, USC's former No. 1 player scored two
points to capture the set. Kuhlman — once the top
player in the nation, and the last collegian to beat
Stanford legend Patty Fendick (in a dual-meet April
19, 1986 played at Stanford while Kuhlman was
26-0), before undergoing surgery on both knees —
appeared to be in control.
Stanford Asst. Coach Lele Farood saw it differ
ently. She told Johnson that with the first set over
so quickly after play resumed, it was "like a whole
new match."
"I came out and lost those two points really fast,"
Johnson recalled. "I thought 'I lost to her down at
USC. I can't do it again.' "
What was Johnson's plan for overcoming the
savvy Kuhlman? "I started taking her balls really
early (and) being aggressive," Johnson said.
Said Farood: "I told her the same thing we told
her last time: The longer she's out there, the better
off you are" since Kuhlman's knees would get
weaker.
Whatever the particulars, the strategy worked
like a charm. After getting down 0-2, Johnson reeled
off five straight wins and led 5-2. "Then I did a
nice little choke job," Johnson said.

That "choke job" allowed Kuhlman to turn the
deficit into a 6-5 lead and a chance to serve for the
match.
On the first point, Johnson ripped off a volley
for a winner then followed up with a scoring back
hand. Kuhlman cut it to 15-30 and was serving to

tie the game.
But she missed the first serve — a failing that
plagued her throughout the match — and Johnson
blew a forehand by her. Kuhlman made it 30-40,

giving her another chance to draw
even.
Johnson came to the net on the
next play and hit several sharp
volleys in a row, but Kuhlman
moved well and returned them
all. All but one. Johnson had the
break and it was time for a tie
breaker.
"Once 1 got to the tiebreaker,
it was my set," Johnson said, add
ing that it's been a long time since
she's lost one.
In the breaker, each player
scored on serve through five
points. Trailing 3-2, Kuhlman
then failed to score on both her
serves giving Johnson a com
manding 5-2 lead. The Stanford
freshman capitalized and took the
tiebreak 7-3.
At that point Johnson had not
only shown an ability to break
Kuhlman's serve, she had appar
ently broken Kuhlman's spirit.
"I got really tired," Kuhlman
said. But the veteran made no
excuses. "She didn't miss a ball;
she played unbelievably."
Said Farood: "[Kyliel started to
really look more confident." And
played like it.
Johnson broke Kuhlman to
open the set and followed that by
holding serve. And what a serve
it was. Oftentimes dazzling,
Johnson combined it with a devas
tating forehand and went in for
the kill.
Leading 2-1, Johnson came up
with another sensational service
game — including an ace — to
hold again. She then became con
tent to judiciously use her back
hand to set up the forehand. The
tactic yielded a number of

forehand winners and provided
Johnson with a 5-1 lead.
After one particularly impres
sive Johnson groundstroke,
Kuhlman shouted: "Where are
you getting all these shots!"
Wherever it was, Johnson had
a couple more. Kuhlman had cut
the lead to 5-3 — fighting off two
match points at 5-2 — and was
serving to draw even nearer. But
Johnson had a different idea.
Kuhlman made an unforced er
ror on the game's first point.
Johnson followed that with a
monster service return and then
forced Kuhlman into another er
ror.
Johnson then had three more
match points. Kuhlman hit a pow
erful serve to save the first one
before Johnson just settled in and
waited patiently for the clincher.
After a long rally during which
neither player took any chances,
Johnson got Kuhlman out of po
sition, ripped off a backhand win
ner and sewed up the win.

edged the crowd who had moved
to the bleachers outside Court 7
to cheer her on, and barely had
a chance to get to shelter before

When the Stanford Cardinal met USC's Women of
Troy in Los Angeles three weeks ago, (Monday Night
hootball highlights music) Stanford star Tami Whit
linger overcame a severe stomach illness and USC's
hard-hitting Trisha Laux in recording one of the
most amazing comeback wins in the history of col
legiate tennis.
Whitlinger's victory was the key as Stanford pulled
out a tense 6-3 win.
Today, in the rematch at the Stanford Tennis
Stadium, the Cardinal puts its perfect 22-0 record
on the line. For Laux and her teammates, no revenge
could be sweeter than to hand Stanford its first loss
of the year.
Ladies and gentlemen, fasten your seat belts. This
should be a good one.

It was a good one, indeed. No, not at No. 1 where
Whitlinger dominated Laux and scored a 6-3, 6-2
victory, but at No. 6 where Kylie Johnson played
the match of her career in downing Caroline
Kuhlman 5-7, 7-6 (7-3), 6-3. That win guaranteed
Stanford a Pacific 10 Conference Southern Division
championship and upped the squad's record to 23-0,
8-0 in Pac-10 play.
USC fell to 15-6, 6-4 in the conference.
Early in the day, it seemed like there wouldn't
be any tennis at all. Rain delayed the start of the
match by two hours and just 75 minutes into the
action — with none of the singles finished — the
heavens opened again.
The match wasn't called off entirely, as the rain
stopped quickly. After a delay to squeegee the courts
dry, play was once again underway about an hour
