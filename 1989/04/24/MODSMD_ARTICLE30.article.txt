When the Stanford Cardinal met USC's Women of
Troy in Los Angeles three weeks ago, (Monday Night
hootball highlights music) Stanford star Tami Whit
linger overcame a severe stomach illness and USC's
hard-hitting Trisha Laux in recording one of the
most amazing comeback wins in the history of col
legiate tennis.
Whitlinger's victory was the key as Stanford pulled
out a tense 6-3 win.
Today, in the rematch at the Stanford Tennis
Stadium, the Cardinal puts its perfect 22-0 record
on the line. For Laux and her teammates, no revenge
could be sweeter than to hand Stanford its first loss
of the year.
Ladies and gentlemen, fasten your seat belts. This
should be a good one.

It was a good one, indeed. No, not at No. 1 where
Whitlinger dominated Laux and scored a 6-3, 6-2
victory, but at No. 6 where Kylie Johnson played
the match of her career in downing Caroline
Kuhlman 5-7, 7-6 (7-3), 6-3. That win guaranteed
Stanford a Pacific 10 Conference Southern Division
championship and upped the squad's record to 23-0,
8-0 in Pac-10 play.
USC fell to 15-6, 6-4 in the conference.
Early in the day, it seemed like there wouldn't
be any tennis at all. Rain delayed the start of the
match by two hours and just 75 minutes into the
action — with none of the singles finished — the
heavens opened again.
The match wasn't called off entirely, as the rain
stopped quickly. After a delay to squeegee the courts
dry, play was once again underway about an hour

and 15 minutes from when it was suspended.
Johnson returned to the court trailing 5-6 in the
first set with Kuhlman serving at deuce.
Quickly, USC's former No. 1 player scored two
points to capture the set. Kuhlman — once the top
player in the nation, and the last collegian to beat
Stanford legend Patty Fendick (in a dual-meet April
19, 1986 played at Stanford while Kuhlman was
26-0), before undergoing surgery on both knees —
appeared to be in control.
Stanford Asst. Coach Lele Farood saw it differ
ently. She told Johnson that with the first set over
so quickly after play resumed, it was "like a whole
new match."
"I came out and lost those two points really fast,"
Johnson recalled. "I thought 'I lost to her down at
USC. I can't do it again.' "
What was Johnson's plan for overcoming the
savvy Kuhlman? "I started taking her balls really
early (and) being aggressive," Johnson said.
Said Farood: "I told her the same thing we told
her last time: The longer she's out there, the better
off you are" since Kuhlman's knees would get
weaker.
Whatever the particulars, the strategy worked
like a charm. After getting down 0-2, Johnson reeled
off five straight wins and led 5-2. "Then I did a
nice little choke job," Johnson said.

That "choke job" allowed Kuhlman to turn the
deficit into a 6-5 lead and a chance to serve for the
match.
On the first point, Johnson ripped off a volley
for a winner then followed up with a scoring back
hand. Kuhlman cut it to 15-30 and was serving to

tie the game.
But she missed the first serve — a failing that
plagued her throughout the match — and Johnson
blew a forehand by her. Kuhlman made it 30-40,
