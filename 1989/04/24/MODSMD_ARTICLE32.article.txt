# Volleyball loses flip for conference title
## 
### John Kirks Staff writer 
It appears that Western Inter
collegiate Volleyball Association's
officials attended the Cincinnati
Reds School of Decision-Making.
The coin toss that Marge Schott
used in baseball's preseason to
decide Kal Daniels' exact 1989
salary seems to have caught on
out on the West Coast. Indeed,
the all-important WIVA league
championship came down to one
of the most time-honored met hods
of deciding a difference.

Unfortunately, Stanford men's
volleyball team came out on the
short end of the 50-50 proposition.
And, by far the biggest break of
the WIVA's regular season went
to the UCLA Bruins, as the 12-
time NCAA champion was
crowned 1989's VVIVA champion.
Yesterday morning, the league's
officials contacted the Cardinal
coaching staff, and, after much
discussion, the two parties agreed
on scrapping any other tie
breaking system that had been
mentioned. Among some of the
alternatives that were tossed out
were a head-to-head competition
comparison and a one-match
playoff between the Bruins and
the Cardinal.
Why did Stanford coaches Fred
Sturm and Ruben Nieves agree
to a coin toss, a method that gave
the team no control over who was
granted the league championship?
Well, it's quite simple: the team
had no choice.

Apparently, there exists some
obscure NCAA rule that a team
cannot compete on more than 32
days in its pre-final-four season.
The rule, which no doubt exists
as a safeguard for the players'
academic pursuits, was appealed
by the Stanford coaching staff,
because Stanford has now played
30 matches. A 31st playoff match
and two regional matches would
have put Stanford over the legal
limit. WIVA's officials contacted
the NCAA to present Stanford's
case.
In an unfathomable decision,
the NCAA denied the Cardinal's
request. In what must have been
an understatement, Asst. Coach
Ruben Nieves said, "We were ex
tremely disappointed with the
NCAA's decision."
Stanford was then left with two
decisions: play UCLA in what
would be a do-or-die match, with
the winner advancing to the Final
Four, or opt for the coin toss.
Stanford had a 50 percent chance
of making the final four in the
coin toss, and a 50 percent chance
of going to the regionals. In the
match against UCLA, which
would have to have been called a
toss-up, Stanford would have had
a 50 percent chance of advancing
to the final four, and a 50 percent
chance of going home. Appropri
ately, Stanford chose the former.
And the rest is history. UCLA
won the toss and will be in the
NCAA final four. Stanford will
play this coming Thursday night
at Loyola Marymount in the
regionals' first round; the Cardi
nal's opponent has not yet been
determined.
In fact, the rest of the region

is in a state of chaos at this point.
Hawaii, which finished third in
the league, played its last eight
matches with an ineligible player.
No decision has been handed
down by the WIVA league office
thus far. Depending on that deci
sion, Stanford could play either
USC or UC-Santa Barbara, cur
rently tied for fourth in WIVA, or
Long Beach State, currently sixth
in the final standings.
"We just want to find out who
we are playing (today)," Nieves
said. "We want to prepare for our
next match — that's the most
important thing on our minds
right now."
The coin toss came yesterday
after Stanford and UCLA had
both concluded their seasons at

17-3 in league play. Stanford
reached the 17-win plateau by
beating Loyola Marymount in
four games on Friday night, 7-15,
15-12, 16-14, 15-I*l, and then
beating Pepperdine in throe
games, 15-9, 15-5, 15-8. The Car
dinal played strong on their entire
southern road trip, also knocking
off UCLA in three games.
Right now the Cardinal is find
ing consolation in the fact that
the team is playing well. "We're
the No. 1 seed in the regional,
and we think we have a good
chance there," Nieves said. And
so, the Cardinal will carry its im
pressive, though hard-luck 1989
campaign southward next Thurs
day to the NCAA's regional play.
And, if the Cardinal does make it
all the way to the NCAA cham
pionship match early next month,
UCLA or whoever is there had
better watch out. The Cardinal
will be playing with a vengeance.

academic pursuits, was appealed
by the Stanford coaching staff,
because Stanford has now played
30 matches. A 31st playoff match
and two regional matches would
have put Stanford over the legal
limit. WIVA's officials contacted
the NCAA to present Stanford's
case.
In an unfathomable decision,
the NCAA denied the Cardinal's
request. In what must have been
an understatement, Asst. Coach
Ruben Nieves said, "We were ex
tremely disappointed with the
NCAA's decision."
Stanford was then left with two
decisions: play UCLA in what
would be a do-or-die match, with
the winner advancing to the Final
Four, or opt for the coin toss.
Stanford had a 50 percent chance
of making the final four in the
coin toss, and a 50 percent chance
of going to the regionals. In the
match against UCLA, which
would have to have been called a
toss-up, Stanford would have had
a 50 percent chance of advancing
to the final four, and a 50 percent
chance of going home. Appropri
ately, Stanford chose the former.
And the rest is history. UCLA
won the toss and will be in the
NCAA final four. Stanford will
play this coming Thursday night
at Loyola Marymount in the
regionals' first round; the Cardi
nal's opponent has not yet been
determined.

is in a state of chaos at this point.
Hawaii, which finished third in
the league, played its last eight
matches with an ineligible player.
No decision has been handed
down by the WIVA league office
thus far. Depending on that deci
sion, Stanford could play either
USC or UC-Santa Barbara, cur
rently tied for fourth in WIVA, or
Long Beach State, currently sixth
in the final standings.
"We just want to find out who
we are playing (today)," Nieves
said. "We want to prepare for our
next match — that's the most
important thing on our minds
right now."
The coin toss came yesterday
after Stanford and UCLA had
both concluded their seasons at

17-3 in league play. Stanford
reached the 17-win plateau by
beating Loyola Marymount in
four games on Friday night, 7-15,
15-12, 16-14, 15-I*l, and then
beating Pepperdine in throe
games, 15-9, 15-5, 15-8. The Car
dinal played strong on their entire
southern road trip, also knocking
off UCLA in three games.
Right now the Cardinal is find
ing consolation in the fact that
the team is playing well. "We're
the No. 1 seed in the regional,
and we think we have a good
chance there," Nieves said. And
so, the Cardinal will carry its im
pressive, though hard-luck 1989
campaign southward next Thurs
day to the NCAA's regional play.
And, if the Cardinal does make it
all the way to the NCAA cham
pionship match early next month,
UCLA or whoever is there had
better watch out. The Cardinal
will be playing with a vengeance.

The coin toss that Marge Schott
used in baseball's preseason to
decide Kal Daniels' exact 1989
salary seems to have caught on
out on the West Coast. Indeed,
the all-important WIVA league
championship came down to one
of the most time-honored met hods
of deciding a difference.

Unfortunately, Stanford men's
volleyball team came out on the
short end of the 50-50 proposition.
And, by far the biggest break of
the WIVA's regular season went
to the UCLA Bruins, as the 12-
time NCAA champion was
crowned 1989's VVIVA champion.
Yesterday morning, the league's
officials contacted the Cardinal
coaching staff, and, after much
discussion, the two parties agreed
on scrapping any other tie
breaking system that had been
mentioned. Among some of the
alternatives that were tossed out
were a head-to-head competition
comparison and a one-match
playoff between the Bruins and
the Cardinal.
Why did Stanford coaches Fred
Sturm and Ruben Nieves agree
to a coin toss, a method that gave
the team no control over who was
granted the league championship?
Well, it's quite simple: the team
had no choice.

Apparently, there exists some
obscure NCAA rule that a team
cannot compete on more than 32
days in its pre-final-four season.
The rule, which no doubt exists
as a safeguard for the players'
academic pursuits, was appealed
by the Stanford coaching staff,
because Stanford has now played
30 matches. A 31st playoff match
and two regional matches would
have put Stanford over the legal
limit. WIVA's officials contacted
the NCAA to present Stanford's
