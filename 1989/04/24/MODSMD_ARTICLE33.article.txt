## 
### Andrew Wilcox Staff writer 
The USC and Stanford wom
en's varsity crews are both
teams trying to prove them
selves; the Women of Troy as
a Pacific 10 Conference con
tender and the Cardinal as a
national power.
In a matchup of the two Sat
urday at Redwood Shores,
Stanford showed it may have
already achieved its goal, while
the USC rowers were left won
dering what hit them.
The Cardinal blew their op
ponents out of the water with
a 24-second victory, proving
that the previous week's im
pressive second-place finish at
the Redwood Shores Stanford
Rowing Classic was no fluke.
While is not of the same
caliber as the Redwood Clas
sic's competition, they did hang
with the Stanford boat for the
first 500 meters. However, the
Trojan boat seemed to run out
of gas and faded fast.
The Cardinal rowers, with no
rea) threat from the opposition
to worry about, settled into a
comfortable groove and
lengthened the lead, finishing
over 100 meters ahead of the
USC boat with a time of 6:54.
This clocking was con
siderably slower than the Car
dinal's time against Radcliffe

The Cardinal had
no real threat from
the opposition.

the previous weekend, due to
the presence of a headwind and
the lack of any close opposition.
"We rowed well but we
weren't pressed so we didn't
have any stimulus to row up
to our full potential. We had
been working on some technical
stuff so our technique looked
good," coach John Davis said.
Sophomore Ellen Austin,
who was inserted into the bow
position before the Redwood
Classic, a move which has coin
cided with the team's recent
success, said, "It was a strong
race for us even though we
weren't pushed. It's exciting to
watch the boat move so fast;
we've got a good blend of tal
ent."
Austin added that the USC
race was a good "rehearsal" for
Saturday's race against Cali
fornia at Redwood Shores.
Although Stanford finished
ahead of California at the Red
wood Classic, the teams did not
face each other in head-to-head
competition, and the Golden
Bears are still ranked No.l in
the Pac-10.
