at Stanford Open

The women started things off
right by winning every field event
except the long jump, in which
they were favored but did not
compete, and the men finished
strong on the track with a dra
matic come-from-behind victory
over New Zealand in the mile
relay.
The women scored the psycho
logical victory the coaches were
looking for going into Big Meet
against Cal next weekend, win
ning five of the six field events
against athletes from nine other
schools.
The first Stanford winner was

Fatty Purpur in the shot put,
throwing 53-foot-1 and just miss
ing her personal best. Purpur is
ranked second in the Pacific 10
Conference and in the nation be
hind Carla Garett of Arizona.
Erica Wheeler was the next
Stanford winner, taking the
javelin at 170-foot-7. Wheeler, a
senior, is ranked third in the Pac
-10 behind No.l-ranked Shelly
Sanford of Washington at 178-
foot-4. Wheeler has shown the
value of consistency, however, as
she has beaten Sanford decisively
twice in the last two weeks.
Before the other field events
were finished freshman Jodie
Bilotta took center stage by run
ning away from the field in both
the 800 meters and the 1500
meters.
"1 just wanted to qualify lor
Pac-10's", she said. Bilotta left no
doubt about the outcome in her
first race, the 1500 meters, hit
ting the tape in 4:30.27 and
beating her Pac-10 goal.
It really helped my confidence",
she said. "Qualifying was the big

thing and that took a lot of the
pressure off."
The men's 1500 meters followed
— with just as much excitement.
In the first heat, Olympian and
Stanford graduate Jeff Atkinson
hung back in last place until 500
meters were left and motored by
the entire field.
In the slower heat, senior James
Alborough scored a mental vic
tory. Alborough led the race from
start to finish and held off both
Eric Walker of Sacramento State
and Parker Kelly of UC-Davis
down the stretch. Alborough ap
peared to be easy prey after
leading the entire race, but
showed the stamina of a 5,000-
meter runner to pull off the win.
Meanwhile, Stanford was mov
ing towards wins in the high
jump, discus and triple jump.
Junior Wendy Allen was the
surprise winner in the high jump,
setting a new personal best at
5-foot 8 3/4. Allen cleared the
bight on her first try, while team
mate Peggy Odita cleared the bar
after two misses.
