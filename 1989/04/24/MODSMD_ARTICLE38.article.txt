Africa took the stage at Cub
berley Auditorium Saturday, as
nearly 200 scholars gathered at
the annual conference of African
affairs sponsored by the
Stanford-Berkeley Joint Center
for African Studies.
Thirteen panels held in the
School of Education throughout
the day focused on this year's
topic, "Conflict and Conflict Res
olution in Africa."
At the beginning of this
month, an unusual multina
tional agreement linked Cuban
troop withdrawal from Angola
with Namibian independence
from South Africa. Namibia has
been occupied by South Africa
for more than 70 years.

Acrobatic diplomacy brought six
countries to the bargaining table
in the past few years, ending in
the recent agreement.
The resolution of internal con
flict in African countries was also
examined at the conference. The
keynote speaker, Prof. Oyeleye
Oyediran from the University of
Lagos, addressed the political fu
ture of Nigeria as it shifts from
military to civil rule.
Panels dealt with the status
of military conflicts in Africa, as
well as gender issues, religion
and the political economy of na
tions from all parts of the con
tinent.
Katherine Welsh, a graduate
student and organizer of the
event, emphasized that the pro
gram attempted to draw atten

tion to "opportunities for
resolution of conflict in Africa."
An animated discussion ad
dressed the Angola and Namibia
peace accords. On April 1, an
agreement reached between An
gola, Cuba, South Africa,
Namibia, the United States and
the Soviet Union went into effect.
This treaty connected United
Nations Security Council Reso
lution 435 for the independence
of Namibia from South Africa to
removal of Cuban troops from
Angola after eight years of ne
gotiations.
A panel of experts included
University of Southern Califor
nia Prof. Gerald Bender,
Appollon Davidson from the So
viet Academy of Sciences, Uni
versity of California-Santa Cruz

Prof. John Marcum and Hoover
Institution Fellow William Rat
liff.
Marcum described how the in
volved countries' common inter
est in resolving the persistent
conflicts finally overcame inter
nal divisions to achieve the com
plicated agreement.
For example, a decisive loss to
combined Cuban and African
resistance forces in Angola
damaged South Africa's "notion
of invincibility." Furthermore, a
boom in South Africa's popula
tion may be causing Pretoria to
pay more attention to internal
affairs, Marcum suggested.
Bender said a "common per
ception" that regional peace in
Namibia hinged on acheiving

peace in Angola contributed to
the agreement process.
But despite the agreement,
withdrawal of troops has not
been proceeding as planned. On
the day of the cease-fire. SWAPO
soldiers crossed into northern
Namibia from bases in southern
Angola and clashed with South
African troops. SWAPO is recog
nized by the United Nations as
a legitimate Namibian political
organization.
Speaking at the conference,
Helmut Angula, the SWAPO rep
resentative to the UN, claimed
that South Africa continues to
defy the agreement by interrogat
ing SWAPO prisoners and has
not begun to withdraw from
Namibia.
