# Seniors snowed in at camp

Nearly 25 students are taking a snow
day today, but not by choice.
About 25 students — out of approxi
mately 50 Senior Weekend campers and
nearly 50 Sierra Camp summer staff —
were stranded last night, at the camp after
a surprise snowstorm hit the area on Fri
day. The snow has been falling ever since.
"We're in a lakefront cabin 15 feet from
the lake, and we can't even see it because
of the snow," said stranded senior Mary
Kllis
Senior Weekend takes place annually at
Stanford Sierra Camp, a wilderness
hideaway on Fallen Leaf Lake, near Lake
Tahoe. The weekend is organized by Clubs
and Classes, a department of the Alumni
Association.
Seniors are allowed to enjoy the camp's
facilities which include sailing, canoeing,
swimming and hiking. Water sports were
prohibited due to the inclement weather,
but some seniors attempted a hike which
was cut short due to the knee-deep
snowdrifts.
One group tried unsuccessfully to leave
twice on Sunday, but was stopped by local
police who told the seniors they would not
be able to move more than 200 feet in 2
hours. Another staff member did not make
it to the main road; she said she slid into
a "violent 180 degree spin-out" which left
her dangling over the lake.

According to Sierra Camp Asst. Manager
Marc Guichard, five inches of snow fell on
camp ground, with an additional 12 to 15
inches "over the passes."
"Obviously, we didn't expect this much
snow We were all wearing shorts and T
shirts on Thursday before the snow came,"
he said.
Highway 50 is closed due to the heavy
snowfall and accidents; snow chains are
required for all travellers, according to the
California Highway Patrol.
All guests have been moved to the main
lodge to conserve energy and because the
lodge is warmer, said Guichard. The water
pipes are in danger of freezing and there
is no hot water, said F!llis.
Snowed-in seniors are light hearted. "The
spirit is running high, anyway," said Ellis.
"It's pretty cozy."
At no loss for ways to occupy themselves,
campers have discovered Risk, Monopoly
and Trivial Pursuit. "All the beer from the
beer-tasting contest is gone," quipped
senior Sally Hamaker, "but it's fun hanging
out by the fireplace."
Hamaker and others had planned to "get
an early start" back to Stanford, but the
weather services report snowfall lasting
through today. Guichard assured The Daily
that there will be enough heating and sup
plies to last through the storm.
A number of campers left early yesterday
morning, avoiding the heaviest snows.
