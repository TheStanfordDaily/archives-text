# Social ethics of trustee questioned
## 
### Brad Hayward Senior staff writer 
A coalition of 16 California civil rights groups
has criticized Stanford's newest trustee for his in
volvement in what it alleges are discriminatory
banking practices.
In a letter to be delivered today to University
President Donald Kennedy, the Greenlining Coali
tion claims that the savings and loan association
owned by Texas billionaire Robert Bass engages in
redlining, an illegal practice that denies loans to
people living in low-income neighborhoods.
Bass, elected to Stanford's Board of Trustees April
11, is president of a Fort Worth-based group that
recently acquired American Savings and Loan As
sociation.
In its letter, the coalition asks for a meeting with
Kennedy, Bass and the board to discuss Bass' "social
responsibility" and his relationship to the Univer
sity. The coalition is made up of organizations rep
resenting disabled, homeless and minority groups
in the Bay Area and other parts of the state.
Edith Adame, legal counsel for the Latino Issues
Forum, one of the 16 organizations represented,
said Bass' savings and loan is "notorious" for red
lining. She added that the coalition picketed the
association's Oakland branch two weeks ago to
protest the practice.
The coalition has proposed a plan that would bail
out the savings and loan industry while providing
money to build homeless shelters. In addition, the
plan would require Savings and Loan to commit to
making more money available for mortgage loans
in low-income and minority communities.
The coalition's letter to Kennedy says that Amer
ican Savings and Loan received a $1.7 billion bailout
subsidy from the federal government in late Decem
ber 1988, an amount more than twice that allocated
for aid to the homeless nationwide next year.
"We don't believe it ("Bass' election) reflects well
on Stanford as a private corporation or on its
values," Adame said.
Bass, who received his master's degree at the
Graduate School of Business in 1974, is chair of
the National Trust for Historic Preservation and
serves on the boards of directors of several organ
izations around the country. He has served on the
Business School's advisory council since 1986.
He and his wife have also given financial support
to the Business School and to Stanford's new Wash
ington, D.C., campus, which is named for them.
Bass could not be reached for comment. Kennedy,
who is currently in Europe for a celebration marking
the University's centennial, will not return to
campus until later this week.
Adame said the coalition has previously intervened
in proposed bank mergers by demanding that fi
nancial institutions abide by the federal Community
Reinvestment Act of 1977, which outlaws redlining.
