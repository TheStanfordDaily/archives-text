# Brown badmouths Democratic party for lack of identity
## 
### Ken Yew Staff writer 
As the recently appointed chair
of California's Democratic Party,
former Gov. Jerry Brown blamed
his party for not creating a solid
political identity that wins elec
tions.
"A political party is about cre
ating differences," Brown told a
capacity crowd at Branner Lounge
Friday, Brown, who spoke in an
event sponsored by the Stanford
Democrats, vied for the Democra
tic presidential nomination in
1976 and 1980.
According to Brown, the mi\jor
mistake of Democratic candidates

is that they spend
too much time
trying to appeal
to a wide spec
trum of people
rather than
define their own
opinions.
Too often,
Democrats want

IU appease uie
wealthier portion of their con
stituency, rather than stand be
hind the traditional supporters of
the party — the poor and the
working classes, Hrown said. He
noted that wealthy citizens wield
more power because they usually
have more than a 70 percent voter

turnout, while poorer voters are
not as well mobilized
Calling for the Democratic
Party to revitalize its commitment
to the working class, Brown said
the party needs to organize these
disenfranchised voters into a pow
erful political force.
Despite his sharp criticism
against his own party, Hrown pre
dicted that Democrats will soon
get a big opportunity to reclaim
their political power through "an
exhaustion of the Reagan-Rush
mandate." By creating a paranoia
about the Soviet Union, Reagan
justified large cuts in basic do
mestic programs to fund defense,
he claimed

hile the Republicans currently
hold power. Brown said the two
party political system is in "an
advanced state of decomposition."
He blamed the meager 50 per
cent voter turnout in the last pres
idential elections on the declining
role of political parties.
Partisan politics played a dom
inant role in people's lives in the
early part of the century, Brown
said Immigrants quickly integra
ted into the local political ma
chine, parties rapidly grew,
greater numbers of people
benefitted from political favors
and the system became corrupt,
according to Brown This led to
a "backlash" in which "new bar

ners were placed to eliminate
patronage "
As a result of the backlash
against partisanism, a more
"candidate-based electorate"
emerged in which politicians now
try to appeal to a wide audience
without taking a firm stand on
the issues, Brown said. Politicians
thus "blur the issues as often as
clarify them," he said.
Brown also spoke about the use
of "polling and computer target
ing" to send different messages to
different types of voters, in an
attempt to play to their particular
concerns. Candidates thus give

the voters a "re-confirmation of
their own subjectivity," telling
them what they want to hear in
stead of where they stand on the
issues.
Brown's talk sparked a positive
response from an audience mem
ber with historical perspective.

graduate from the Class of 1932,

party that seemed to care about
the people after the 1929 eco

said, "I don't care what they do
