# Rain-drenched ralliers defend abortion rights

### Elaine Riggs Staff writer 
About 400 people shivered in White Plaza
yesterday as they huddled to listen to songs
and speeches at a noontime rally for con
tinued legal abortion rights.
Titled "Speak Out for Choice," the rally
was sponsored by the Pro-Choice Alliance,
a campus student group, and the California
Abortion Rights Action League.
The U.S. Supreme Court is scheduled
tomorrow to hear oral arguments for
Webster v. Reproductive Health Services,
a case that directly challenges the funda
mental right to an abortion established in
the court's Roe v. Wade decision in 1973.
More briefs have been filed on behalf of
the Webster case than any other case in
the history of the Supreme Court, accord
ing to Law Prof. Deborah Rhode, who spoke
at the rally.
"And with good reason," Rhode told the
crowd. "From the perspective of women,
there is no more important issue than the
right to control one's life."
Rhode said "a whole range of outcomes"
is possible from the Webster case, including

a compromise decision that would not over
turn Roe v. Wade but would add new re
strictions to obtain a legal abortion in the
United States.
"The young, the frightened adolescents,"
particularly poor and minority women,
would be most discouraged by legal restric
tions from getting abortions, Rhode said.
During the decades before Roe v. Wade,
approximately one million abortions per
year were performed in the United States,
according to Rhode. Most of those abortions
were illegal and some resulted in injury or
death, Rhode said.
Students wandered through the crowd
holding handmade signs that read "Keep
Your Laws Off My Body," "Be a Voice for
Choice," "Stanford Men for Choice," and
"Reproductive Freedom."
The signs were soon outnumbered by
umbrellas when a steady rain began to fall

Students braved the cold weather and rain yesterday to show their support for legalized abortion at a rally In White

during the rally.
"It will be a cold, rainy day in
hell before we will ever go back
to the time when women died
from illegal abortion," civil rights
lawyer Mary Dunlap told the
crowd in a fiery address.
When thunder and lightning
erupted during Dunlap's closing
speech, many onlookers responded
with cheers.
"This is a metaphor for the mes
sage that we're sending to Wash
ington, D.C.," Dunlap said, point
ing to the thunderous sky.
Several speakers adopted a stri
dent tone against the campus pro
life organization Stanford Stu
dents for Life, and the Bay Area
chapter of Operation Rescue, a
national pro-life group.
Speaker Diana Workman, direc
tor of the Sunnyvale Family Plan
ning Clinic, said her clinic has
been "attacked" three times by
Operation Rescue.
Repeatedly referring to the
group as "Operation Harrass
You," Workman said Operation
Rescue members sometimes
detain not only women who are
visiting the clinic for an abortion,
but also women who receive
prenatal care for pregnancies they
plan to carry to full term.
"These women are unable to
receive the medical care they need
because these fascists sit or stand
in their way," Workman said.
Rally speakers varied in their
degrees of support for the pro
choice philosophy.
Assoc. English Prof. Barbara
Gelpi, who described herself as a
Catholic feminist, said she is pro
choice "but profoundly opposed to
abortion except in truly desperate

circumstances."
Graduate student Elizabeth
Wahl, who founded the Pro-Choice
Alliance at Stanford in January,
said the turnout for the rally was
"impressive."
"So many students were willing
to stand there in the most adverse
of conditions — the pouring rain,"
Wahl said.
There were several plainclothes
security guards in the crowd, at
the request of Director of Student
Organization Services Michael
Ramsey-Perez, according to Wahl.
Wahl said she was surprised
that members of Stanford Stu
dents for Life did not visibly at
tend the rally.
Many students who attended
the rally expressed positive reac
tions.
. "I thought it was inspiring,"
said junior David Hornik, who
said he "stood out in the cold
until the bitter end."
Hornik said the issues involved
in the upcoming Webster case will
affect men as well as women.
"The issue is more than pro
choice. It's the right to privacy
and the right to control one's
body, and definitely men have
something to gain or lose from
the decision," Hornik said.
Senior Amy Framcetic, one of
the rally's main organizers,
opened the rally with words she
said were directed to three famous
Stanford alumni: current Su
preme Court Justices Anthony
Kennedy, Sandra Day O'Connor
and William Rehnquist.
"We'd like to tell them that we
are in sync with more than two
thirds of the rest of the country,"
Framcetic said.
Students on all sides of the
abortion issue agreed that the
mfyority of Stanford students are
pro-choice.
