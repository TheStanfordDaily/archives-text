### Elaine Riggs Staff writer 
About 400 people shivered in White Plaza
yesterday as they huddled to listen to songs
and speeches at a noontime rally for con
tinued legal abortion rights.
Titled "Speak Out for Choice," the rally
was sponsored by the Pro-Choice Alliance,
a campus student group, and the California
Abortion Rights Action League.
The U.S. Supreme Court is scheduled
tomorrow to hear oral arguments for
Webster v. Reproductive Health Services,
a case that directly challenges the funda
mental right to an abortion established in
the court's Roe v. Wade decision in 1973.
More briefs have been filed on behalf of
the Webster case than any other case in
the history of the Supreme Court, accord
ing to Law Prof. Deborah Rhode, who spoke
at the rally.
"And with good reason," Rhode told the
crowd. "From the perspective of women,
there is no more important issue than the
right to control one's life."
Rhode said "a whole range of outcomes"
is possible from the Webster case, including

a compromise decision that would not over
turn Roe v. Wade but would add new re
strictions to obtain a legal abortion in the
United States.
"The young, the frightened adolescents,"
particularly poor and minority women,
would be most discouraged by legal restric
tions from getting abortions, Rhode said.
During the decades before Roe v. Wade,
approximately one million abortions per
year were performed in the United States,
according to Rhode. Most of those abortions
were illegal and some resulted in injury or
death, Rhode said.
Students wandered through the crowd
holding handmade signs that read "Keep
Your Laws Off My Body," "Be a Voice for
Choice," "Stanford Men for Choice," and
"Reproductive Freedom."
The signs were soon outnumbered by
umbrellas when a steady rain began to fall
