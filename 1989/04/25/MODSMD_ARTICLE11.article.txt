## Japanese leader resigns Takeshita decides to step down over stock scandal 
### 
TOKYO(AP) â€” Japanese Prime
Minister Noboru Takeshita told
leaders of his Liberal Democratic
Party today he had decided to
resign to take responsibity for a
loss of public trust due to a widen
ing political scandal.
The mass circulation Mainichi
Shimbun newspaper and the
Japan Broadcasting Corp. said
Takeshita plans to resign as soon
as Parliament passes the budget
for fiscal 1989, expected by early
May
A recent poll by the Kyodo News
Service put Takeshita's support
at only 3.9 percent, the lowest
ever recorded by Kyodo for a
prime minister. A poll by Mainichi
Shimbun put his support at 9 per
cent, the lowest since the news
paper began such surveys in 1947.
Passage of the budget for fiscal
1989, which began April 1, has
been blocked by an opposition
boycott of deliberations in Parlia
ment, but it is expected to come
late this month or soon after
several national holidays end early
in May.
The reports said Takeshita, who
became prime minister in Novem
ber 1987, has also decided to can
cel a trip to five southeast Asian
nations. He was scheduled to leave

Saturday for the nine-day tour.
Masayoshi Ito, chairman of the
party executive council and an
eight-time member of the lower
house, has been cited as a possible
successor to Takeshita. However,
political analysts say poor health
may keep Ito, 75, from accepting
the post. Ito is diabetic.
The newspaper Yomiuri Shim
bun said Takeshita asked Ito
about succeeding him, but Ito
turned him down for health
reasons.
Kyodo News Service said Ito
denied the report, and Takeshita
told Japanese reporters it was "to
tally unfounded."
But Kyodo quoted a senior
member of Takeshita's faction
within the governing Liberal
Democratic Party as confirming
the prime minister's approach to
Ito.
At least 17 politicians or their
aides, including those of Takes
hita, reportedly bought discount
shares of stock in a subsidiary of
Recruit Co., an information
publishing conglomerate, in 1986.
The transactions generated hefty
profits when the share prices
soared after the stocks were made
available for over-the-counter
trading.

Takeshita has denied wrongdo
ing but has acknowledged receiv
ing more than $1 million in what
he called legal political donations
from Recruit.
Many of the donations were
ticket purchases to fund-raising
parties. Such gatherings of fellow
politicians and business leaders
are common in Japan, where
politics and business are closely
related. They are especially
popular with the Liberal Demo
crats as a way around laws re
stricting campaign funds.
News reports over the weekend
said Takeshita also borrowed
$381,700 from Recruit in 1987,
returning the funds a few months
later.
Recruit paid millions of dollars
to influential politicians or their
aides as contributions, raising
suspicions that it was seeking
favors in return.
In all, more than a dozen people
have been arrested on bribery and
other charges, and three
Takeshita-appointed Cabinet
members have resigned in con
nection with the scandal.
In recent weeks, Takeshita has
repeatedly vowed to push through
political reforms to restore public
trust in government.
