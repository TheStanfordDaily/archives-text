# Amnesty International urges countries to end death penalty
## 
### 
LONDON (AP) â€” Amnesty Interna
tional appealed yesterday to 100 coun
tries, including the United States and
Iran, to abolish the death penalty, calling
it an arbitrary "judicial lottery" that does
not deter crime.
The human rights group, in a study
of capital punishment worldwide, says it
is slanted against the poor, ethnic mi
norities and political opponents of the
government.
Amnesty International recorded 15,320
executions in 90 countries in the past
decade but said they often are done in
secret. It said other estimates put the
number as high as 40,000.

Victims ranged in age from 14 to 76,
with the United States among six coun
tries that have executed juveniles under
age 18, the group said.
However, it cited only cases in which
U.S. authorities executed adults for
crimes committed when they were
juveniles.
Of the 100 men and women executed
in U.S. prisons since the Supreme Court
in 1976 allowed states to resume capital
punishment, three died for murders com
mitted when they were 17.
The death penalty is used in some coun
tries not just to punish murder, but also
adultery, prostitution, showing porno

graphic films, bribery, corruption, em
bezzlement, kidnapping, rape, robbery
and drug-trafficking, Amnesty said. Vic
tims include non-violent political prison
ers and the mentally ill.
Amnesty International says the U.S.
death penalty appears arbitrary and ra
cially biased and has been imposed for
crimes committed by juveniles, on the
mentally ill, and on people who may have
been innocent.
As of May 1, 1988, it said, 2,048 pris
oners were under sentence of death in
35 states, three of whom were tried under
military law, and 98 people were executed
from 1977 to May 31, 1988.

Amnesty International, which is based
in London and won the 1977 Nobel Peace
Prize, said in the study of 180 countries
that 100 still have the death penalty.
"Despite a range of safeguards, the use
of the death penalty in the U.S.A. appears
to be arbitrary and racially biased," the
introduction said.
Whether a death sentence is imposed,
Amnesty said, is decided in the early legal
stages by prosecutors who have "consid
erable discretion over whether or not to
seek" it.
Only a minority of those cases are tried
as capital cases, it said, but "decisions
leading to an eventual death sentence may

be based on factors beyond the circum
stances of the crime itself."
It said these include "financial and
community pressures, the race and social
status of the offender and victim, and
where the crime was committed." Am
nesty said blacks are 12 percent of the
U.S. population but 40 percent of pris
oners under sentence of death.
"Black defendants, especially in the
southern states, have often been con
victed by all-white juries after
prosecutors have used their powers of
peremptory challenge to exclude black
prospective jurors," the report said.
