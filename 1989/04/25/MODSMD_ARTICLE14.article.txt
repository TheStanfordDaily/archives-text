# BBC strikers disrupt British TV

LONDON (AP) - "The Flint
stones" and old documentaries
replaced sports and talk shows,
and the half-hour midday news
shrank to eight minutes on BBC
TV and radio as thousands of em
ployees staged a 24-hour strike
yesterday over pay.
Half the nation's non-cable tele
vision — two channels — and all
four of its national radio channels
were disrupted by the cancellation
or shortening of live programs,
said the publicly funded British
Broadcasting Corp.
The three unions jointly organ
izing the strike estimated that
19,000 of the corporation's 25,000
employees stayed away from work
in the first walkout at the BBC
in four years.
They demanded a 16 percent
pay increase to bring them in line

with commercial broadcasting
salaries. The management has
said it cannot give them more
than a 7 percent raise.
"We say to the management
that if you care about public serv
ice broadcasting then pay the rate
for the job," Deputy General Sec
retary Jake Ecclestone told a rally
of 400 strikers in West London.
'The BBC is underpaying its
staff because it chooses to under
pay its staff," he said.
Demonstrations also were
called for Glasgow, Manchester,
Birmingham, Belfast and other
mqjor cities, and picket lines were
set up in London.
The strike began at midnight,
silencing hourly radio newscasts
between 1 a.m. and 5 a.m. on the
light entertainment station Radio
2. Top disc jockey Chris Stuart

stayed away, and the newscast
was reduced to between two and
five minutes.
On the 24-hour Radio 4, the
main news station, a repeat talk
show replaced the popular
"Today" program, a documentary
was broadcast instead of a live
consumer affairs show and an old
program on Cuba filled in for part
of the midday news.
The walkout caused the cancel
lation of the World Service radio's
global broadcasts of news com
mentary programs, financial
reports and daily review of the
British press.
On television, "The Flint
stones" cartoon anchored an eclec
tic lineup — including a food show
and a program on stuntman Evel
Knievel — instead of the main
morning show "Breakfast Time"
on BBC-1.
