4 cited in People's Park protest
BERKELEY, Calif. (AP) — Four people were
arrested yesterday after they chained themselves
to a concrete slab poured over the weekend in
an effort to build a permanent toilet on university
owned People's Park.
The protesters were cited on misdemeanor
charges of entering property with the intent to
cause damage, said Sgt. Leroy Pereira of the
University of California at Berkeley, which owns
the 2.3-acre lot.
Campus workers later tore up the slab and
carted it away. There was no resistance by those
arrested, although officers had to use bolt cutters
to remove them, said Pereira.
On Thursday, 50 people commemorating the
20th anniversary of the founding of the park
started building the toilet, only to have it torn
up the next morning by campus workers and
police. They returned over the weekend.

The park had its beginning on April 20, 1969,
when activists began occupying the empty lot,
which had been bought by the university 10
months earlier.
Shuttle workers evacuated in fire
CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) — A small
equipment room fire forced the evacuation of
about 600 workers from a building housing the
space shuttle launch control center yesterday, but
it was quickly extinguished.
NASA said the blaze would have no impact on
Friday's scheduled liftoff of Atlantis on a
planetary mission.
The fire was on the fourth floor in a room
that supplies air conditioning to part of the four
story building. The launch control center is on
the third floor.
Space agency spokesman Dick Young said ma
terial used to insulate equipment caught fire, but
caused only "minimal" damage.
