Elections Committee is
once again responsible
for problematic election

Sunday Flicks invites you to a
preview of a new movie: "THE
ASSU ELECTION THAT
WOULDN'T DIE" Thrill at the
chance to cast your ballot again
and again. . .. Scream as the kil
ler election fliers attack your
r00m... . Cringe at the stupid
mix-ups and errors that keep the
election going forever. . .
FOR THE VOTERS, the
ASSU and the candidates
themselves, this year's
never-ending ASSU election must
seem like a bad horror movie
come true.
While the Elections Commis
sion deserves credit for smoothly
pulling off Stanford's first com
puterized election, a system
fraught with potential for major
screw-ups, the not-so-little
details seem to have escaped
them.
These details do not seem
trivial to the Senior Class Pres
ident slates that must participate
in a runoff election because the
Elections Commission forgot to
tell voters to rank the slates
preferentially, as required by the
ASSU Bylaws. Preferential bal
loting was instituted to eliminate
the need for runoff elections.
Meanwhile, candidates for the
Student Conduct Legislative
Council have been placed in limbo
while the ASSU decides whether
to completely rerun that election
because the top two vote-getters
should not have been included on
the ballot.
One SCLC top vote-getter,

Canetta Ivy, withdrew from the
race fairly early on. However, the
Elections Commission forgot to
notify voters of her change in
status.
In addition, Leonard Adler,
who drew the most votes in the
SCLC race, was allowed to stay
on the ballot even though he had
not been admitted to Stanford
Law School. The bylaws dis
qualifed Adler from running for
graduate senator, but did not ad
dress his SCLC candidacy.
Although the ASSU's con
voluted bylaws bear some respon
siblity for the SCLC fiasco, the
ASSU and the Elections Commis
sion do deserve criticism for
failing to point out the inconsis
tency.
In a final topper, the Elections
Commission never got around to
preparing a budget for a runoff
election.
Even if the budget had been
ready though, it's doubtful that
the Elections Commission could
have gotten its act together to
get things over with and have a
runoff election this week. Be
cause the commission was not
able to count 50 paper ballots
from the Law School in time for
the results to be OKed at the
ASSU Senate meeting last week,
the runoff was stalled until next
week.
The real losers in this comedy
of errors? The voters.
Out of sight, out of mind, the
old saying goes. With election
fliers smeared from rain, election
handbooks in the trash can and
Council of Presidents debates
quickly fading from memory,
voters will be more likely to vote
on name recognition, if they vote
at all.
Surely student government
deserves more respect.
