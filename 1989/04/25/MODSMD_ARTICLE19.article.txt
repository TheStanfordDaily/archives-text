## An American nightmare 
### 
I HAD JUST FINISHED making
lunch for my 6-year-old brother. As
I turned back to check on Nathaniel,
to make sure that everything was OK, I
saw something moving in the backyard.
I did a double-take and realized there
was a man outside approaching our patio
and the sliding glass door, the only shield
between Nathaniel and the outside.
My first thought was my brother. I
had to protect him from whatever was
about to happen. 1 ran to the glass door
and locked it before the strange man got
in. He was trying to say something to
me: "Help me. They're gonna kill me."
There were three guys walking up the
quiet cul-de-sac looking for him. They
were gang members. I had seen the graf
fiti of the "Crips" (a.k.a. "Cuzz") and
"Bloods" (a.k.a. "Piru"). However, I had
never before come into direct contact with
this culture.
Gang violence continues to threaten my
neighborhood. My mother has told me
that several people in our neighborhood
have been lulled during the past two
years. The first was a boy my age.
I remember Derek as a very quiet and
shy person. They say he became hooked
on crack. He disappeared for a few days;
then they found him dead in an alley. I
am not sure that they ever found out
what he died from.
The second to die was a girl a year
older than I. I hadn't seen Tami much
since she graduated from high school. My
mother told me she had a boyfriend who
was a gang member.

Apparently, he said something he
shouldn't have and his life was threat
ened. Tami was eight months pregnant
when she was shot down. She was with
her boyfriend and the gang was taking
their revenge. She was shot once in the
stomach and once in tha head.
These are the casualties of a cold and
careless society. We condemn our victims
— the poor, the disadvantaged and the
social misfits — to a life with no hope
and no future. It is no wonder they turn
to crime, drugs or gangs. Until we create
opportunities that will lift these people
from their situations and give them some
sort of hope and pride, the number of
the dead will increase and our generation
will lose many promising men and wom
en.
Gang members are people who have
no hope and have been disappointed or
disenchanted by the American free
enterprise system. They want educations,
jobs, and all that any youth of America
wants, but for some reason or another
they do not have the opportunity, self
confidence or motivation to achieve these
goals.
Their mothers work all day and come
home to work there also, leading to many
frustrated women who do not have the
opportunity to spend the time with their
children that they would like. In turn,
their children feel lonely, dejected and
abandoned, so they turn to gangs where
their needs can be met.
Drugs have had a great influence on
the gang culture; a vast majority of gang
members are drug dealers. Through the
drug market, these young people have

found a way to include themselves in the
free-market enterprise they are otherwise
excluded from. By selling drugs, they
have a chance to become wealthy and
gain status and validation in our society.
The difference between the drug dealer
and the stock broker is the means they
use to achieve their ends. One operates
within the confines of the legal system
and the other operates outside. Both
achieve the same result — their "piece
of the pie," "the American Dream."
The drug market is very profitable. It
provides a means of "getting ahead" in
society for many who have tried and failed
or simply have no hope. By providing
jobs that pay what they are worth and
increasing the wage rates of jobs that
are undervalued, such as teaching in pri
mary and elementary education, we can
make positive steps in alleviating the
existing drug problem.
Putting more people in jail and making
harsher penalties for certain types of
crimes is not going to solve the problem.
When people commit crimes they are well
aware of the possible consequences, but
they still feel that they must do these
things in order to survive.
The sad fact is that their logic is quite
reasonable.
