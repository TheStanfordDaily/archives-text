# Seniors call for student speaker at Commencement ceremony
## 
### John Wagner Editorial staff 
Backed by the Council of Presidents
and Senior Class Presidents, two seniors
are urging the administration to include
a speech given by a graduating senior as
part of the annual Commencement cere
mony.
In a letter scheduled for delivery to
University President Donald Kennedy's
office this morning, Xavier Briggs and
James Pitofsky ask that a senior speaker
be added to the program in order to
"address shared experiences [of the senior
class], to both reflect and look to the
future as one of us."
COP member Stacey Leyton said the
proposal for a senior speaker will be in
cluded on the agenda for the COP's reg

ular weekly meeting with Kennedy on
Thursday morning.
Kennedy is out of town and was un
available for comment.
Briggs told The Daily last night that
the current Commencement program "in
volves kind of a monologue from the ad
ministration to us." Having a graduating
senior share reflections "would add a cer
tain legitimacy to the day," Briggs said.
According to Pitofsky, the effort to in
clude a senior speaker is not meant as a
critique of the administration, but rather
an attempt to "enhance the day."
"Understand, we still wish for you to
address the class," Briggs and Pitofsky
wrote to Kennedy, "and we welcome an
outside speaker, as we know most stu
dents do, but it would seem just and
would be inspiring to have a peer, some

one who shares our common bond, to
speak for and to the class."
In their letter, they suggest the student
speaker at Commencement be chosen by
a vote of the senior class. Following a
nomination period, seniors would cast
their ballots when they pick up their caps
and gowns from the Bookstore in May.
"This process, by lacking an audition,
would avoid a selection based upon the
content of the speech," Briggs and
Pitofsky wrote, "but would, instead,
enable seniors to select the individual
whose insight and perspective they re
spect most."
The chief criteria for the selection proc
ess is that the senior class, rather than
the administration, select the speaker,
Briggs said.
According to Pitofsky, the process

should produce a speaker whom a lot of
people will want to hear and will find
interesting.
However, the suggested selection proc
ess is "purely a suggestion," Pitofsky
said.
"It represents one viable method, but
not the only one," Briggs explained.
Pitofsky said the idea to add a student
speaker to the Commencement ceremony
originated while he, Briggs, and others
while having frozen yogurt at Double
Rainbow Gourmet Ice Cream and Desert
Cafe.
Following a group discussion, Pitofsky
and Briggs composed the letter and then
sought the endorsements of the COP and
Senior Class Presidents.
"Their support added a certain amount
of legitimacy," Briggs said. "Their signa

tures should carry some weight."
The COP "felt real strongly about sup
porting" the proposal for a senior speaker
at gradution, according to Leyton.
Leyton said she thought "something
was missing" from the graduation cere
monies last year. The addition of a senior
speaker "would provide a real student
perspective," she added.
In their letter to Kennedy, Briggs and
Pitofsky express some concern over the
possibility that the administration might
deny their request â€” in fear that the
student would use the speaking opportu
nity as a political platform.
"Please do not shy away from inviting
a student speaker merely because you
fear an expression of political
views," they wrote. "One student
can certainly not represent all
views of the class, but we should
not presuppose that the best al
ternative is to hear no views."
Briggs told The Daily that the
selection process could be set up
to discourage a politically
motivated speech, though "politics
are almost intrinsic" in a speech
about personal vision and goals.
Furthermore, Briggs said,
Doonesbury cartoonist Gary
Trudeau, this year's keynote
speaker at Commencement, "cer
tainly has his own political slant."
Pitofsky agreed that while the
speaking opportunity would not
be offered as a political platform,
a senior's speech could contain po

'If we can avoid
polltfcism and just
have a person reflect,
that would be all the
better.'

litical elements.
"If they say something provoca
tive, it will make us think," he
added.
However, Pitofsky said, "If we
can avoid politicism and just have
a person reflect, that would be all
the better."
But both Briggs and Pitofsky
said they doubted that the possi
bility of politicization would
hinder their efforts to add a senior
speaker to the program. "I don't
think it will be a msgor stumbling
block," Briggs said.
