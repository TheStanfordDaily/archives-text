## Tuesday Films were not singled out for censorship 
### 
AS DIRECTOR OF University
Events and Services, I feel com
pelled to respond to The Daily's
April 13 editorial, which charged the
University with censorship of Tuesday
Films.
As the editorial pointed out, the
films are generally unorthodox and
often controversial in nature. And
while such films have a place on the
Stanford campus, where the exchange
of ideas is encouraged, it is incumbent
upon their sponsors to let audiences
know what will be depicted — be it

nudity, profanity or topics of contro
versy.
That is the whole point of the policy
requiring the film series sponsors — or
any event sponsors — to describe
events before they take place.
A condition of approval which asks
the facility user to inform the audience
of the nature of an event which might
be considered offensive to some is
hardly a policy of censorship.
Rather, it is a gesture of courtesy.
Stanford, as other universities,
is a place where controversial issues

are discussed, not prohibited and cer
tainly not censored. The University is
very supportive of programs provoking
discussions of different points of view,
but, out of courtesy to those who
choose not to enter such sensitive
discussions, we must take steps to see
that the proper manner of presentation
is provided.
All requests for use of University
facilities must be clearly defined in all
facility use applications before the
activities are approved.
The sponsors of Tuesday Films, who

have provided such information
throughout the past several years, are
no exception. No different rules or
regulations were put into effect this
quarter. The student submitting the
form simply did not have the names of
the films listed on the form, and was
requested to provide those names
before final approval could be granted.
All groups who show films on campus
must — and do — meet this same
requirement.
