# Cowell did better than 'OK' according to student survey
## 
### 
The Student Health Advisory, Review
and Evaluation committee was dis
turbed to read the headline of the
April 20 article about the results of
Co well's randomized surveys of stu
dents' satisfaction with care received at
the health center.
The headline read "Patients give
Cowell OK Rating." We feel that this
headline inaccurately described the
results of the surveys.
As the article reported, the results of
the surveys were very positive, not just
OK. The title implied a mediocrity of
care which is inconsistent with the
actual results of the survey.
Overall satisfaction with care re
ceived in outpatient, after-hours and
infirmary care was very high. In gen
eral, students were quite satisfied with
their diagnosis and treatment, the level
of privacy and length of stay in the
waiting room.
In addition, students seemed quite
satisfied with the attitudes and

friendliness of the health care practi
tioners who cared for them.
Most of the Cowell staff have chosen
to work at Cowell because they have a
genuine interest in working with and
caring for students. As SHARE mem
bers, we have gotten to know many of
the Cowell staff and have come to
appreciate the dedication they have to
improving student health.
We do, of course, acknowledge the
validity of student complaints and sug
gestions for improvement of Cowell
services. The main purpose of the sur
vey was to identify these student con
cerns in order to improve the level of
health care provided at Cowell. Any
complaints received on the surveys are
being adequately addressed on an indi
vidual basis.
It is not uncommon to hear Stanford
students griping about their experiences
at Cowell. However, the results of
these surveys indicate a much higher
level of satisfaction with Cowell serv
ices than most students would expect.
We realize that The Daily tries to
select headlines which will generate
public interest in their articles. We also
understand that The Daily has limita
tions on spacing and length of head
lines. However, in the future, The
Daily staff should make a concentrated

effort to choose titles that more closely
match the content of the respective
articles.
The SHARE committee invites all
students with any feedback about care
received at Cowell to stop by the
SHARE booth in White Plaza Tuesdays
and Thursdays between 12 and 1 p.m.
Or give us a call and leave a message
at 725-1389. We would like to hear
your concerns and suggestions for im
provements, and we would be happy to
answer any questions you may have
about Cowell.
