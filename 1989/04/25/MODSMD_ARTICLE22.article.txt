# Pro-lifers should not be ignored by the Women's Center
## 
### 
In defense of Jennifer Bryson's April
14 letter and in response to the subse
quent criticisms of it, I think the point
of her letter has been neglected.
The fact that the Women's Center is
not representing all women's issues

causes me to question the gender
encompassing name of the center. The
center has the prerogative not to
publicize Stanford Students for Life in
its literature, a group whose actions it
does not condone.
However, with the renewed interest
in the legalities of abortion, a presenta
tion of both sides of the issue seems
very important to me. America is sup
posedly a land of freedom and opportu
nity, so why not let the women make
the decision of what they condone and
condemn themselves?
And what better place could one
obtain such information than at, not
the Feminists' Center, not the Pro-
Choice Center, not the Pro-Life Center,
but at the Women's Center?
