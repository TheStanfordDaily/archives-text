## Grasping for the texture of language 
### Alan Isaacs 
Susan Howe's poems and essays rep
resent some of the most challenging
and important material in contempo
rary writing. She is the author of six
books of poetry, most recently "Artic
ulation of Sound Forms in Time"
(Awede, 1987), as well as a critical
work, "My Emily Dickinson." (North
Atlantic Books, 1985).
Howe has been associated with the
language poetry movement, whose
members reject the notion of poetry
as a lyrical vehicle for the communi
cation of a sensitized image, emotion
or character; rather, they treat the
poem as language itself, as a visual
and phonetic juxtaposition of words
on a page.
"Meaning" here becomes obviously
problematic, the reader more often cre
ating than discovering it.
Howe's own poetics, as she made
clear in a recent reading and interview
at Stanford, merely courts the her
metic. "The sound makes the mean
ing," she says,"in an odd way." "In
an odd way," one of Howe's favorite
musings, an indication of her attrac
tion to those ragged edges where lan
guage fails to account for experience.
"You come into life and you die hearing
sounds, voices and whispers."
This immediacy of the word as
sound, its tangible texture, touches the
body. "Your mother babbles and sings;
it's the way my mother got close to
me. Words were milk and comfort."
It would be misleading, however, to
call Howe's work merely musical. The

majority of her
recent poems are
complex medita
tions on certain
historical texts:
17th century
Puritan sermons
and captivity
narratives and
the writing espe
cially of Dickin
son, Melville and
Thoreau.
"I go off to
solitary places
and let some
thing work on
me, letting those
voices come to
you in little
whispers. . . .
Splinters of
sound are im
mensely impor
tant. There is a
sense of fracture
in the American
voice that to me
is absolutely
thrilling."
Howe's "ob
session" with

To kin I call in the Iron-Woods
Turn I to dark Fells last aliray
Theirs wan an archheathen theme
Soon seen stumbled in lag Clock
Still we call bitterly bitterly
Stern norse terse ethical pathos
Archaic presentiment of rupture
Voicing desire no more from here
Far flung North Atlantic littorals
Lif sails off longing for life
Baldr soars on Alfather's path
Rubble couple on pedestal
Rubble couple Rhythm and Pedestal
Room of dim portraits here there
Wade waist deep maidsworn men
Crumbled masonry windswept hick
ory
â€” from "Articulations of Sound Forms
in Time"

17th century America is part of her
drive to "find the origin of things."
She believes that much in contempo
rary America curiously echoes its
Puritan origin; both are histories of
"a culture on the cusp," a time when
the fragmentation of meaning in
literary texts arises from a culture in
rapid flux.

Howe's read
ings of Puritan
history relies es
pecially on cap
tivity narratives,
in which the au
thor, usually a
woman, has been
carried off into
the wilderness
for ransom by
the Native
Americans who
lived there.
Howe has writ
ten that Mary
Rowlandson, the
first such au
thor, "looks out
at the absence of
Authority and
sees we are all
alone . . . (she
and her fellow
captives) are
things; abducted
from the struc
ture of experi
ence."
This place
where one

dwells, painfully,
in possibility, then becomes assim
ilated itself back into a Puritan ideol
ogy whose task is to extinguish the
inexplicable; the narrative is
punctuated by Biblical quotations
which read Rowlandson's experience
(safely) as part of God's plan for a
sinner's conversion and readmission
into the community

Howe writes that this rationalizing
the strangeness of something "other"
is "both a microcosm of colonial im
perialism history, and a prophecy of
our contemporary repudiation of al
terity, anonymity, darkness."
Howe's readings of history help us
to read her poety. Fracture, that which
tears words from conventional mean
ing, charging them with the strange
immediacy of sound, takes place in the
epigraph of "Articulation of Sound
Forms in Time:"
from seaweed said nor repossess rest
scape esaid
One theme of the book which might
be drawn from these lines (without
accounting for them, they remain
sibilantly obscure) is the event of the
"said," of exiting the culturally and
linguistically known.
Howe also describes this escape of
convention as a woman writer's neces
sity. Real sexual difference, however,
remains a "structure we're not aware
of, as mysterious as the atom." Such
mysteries, not at all romantically
gilded, but rather obscurely felt at the
edges of what our langugage has al
lowed us to know, are what Susan
Howe evokes with tangible power in
her work.
