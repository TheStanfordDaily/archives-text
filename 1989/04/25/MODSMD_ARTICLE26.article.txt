# A centennial reading
## 
### 
At 2 p.m. Sunday, April 30 in Memorial
Auditorium, five distinguished alumni of the
Stanford Creative Writing Program will read
from their works.
Sunday's reading forms part of Stanford's
extended Centennial celebration. It also hap
pens to coincide with the 80th birthday of
Wallace Stegner, who founded the writing pro
gram in 1946.
The featured authors, Wendell Berry, Ernest
Gaines, Donald Justice, Larry McMurtry and
Scott Turow, are among the many success
stories the Creative Writing Program has
produced. While their topics have been wildly
diverse — from issues of home and family in
the work of Kentucky born-and-bred Wendell
Berry to the grisly depiction of first-year law
school in Scott Turow's "One L," from Gaines'
portrayal of Southern blacks in"The Autobi
ography of Miss Jane Pittman" to McMurtry's
depiction of small-town life in the Academy
Award winning "Terms of Endearment," —
all five have shared overwhelming critical ac
claim.
Berry, Gaines, Justice, McMurtry and
Turow are among the 98 writers whose work
appears in the centennial anthology "The Un
common Touch: Fiction and Poetry from the
Stanford Writing Workshop," recently released
by the Stanford Alumni Association. Edited
by John L'Heureux, the current director of
the Creative Writing Program, this compila
tion includes a multitude of well-known au
thors, among them Ken Keasy of Merry
Pranksters fame and Raymond Carver, de
facto father of the modern short story.
Sunday's reading is open and free to the
public. A reception with the authors will follow
at the Louis R. Lurie Rotunda in Green Li
brary.
