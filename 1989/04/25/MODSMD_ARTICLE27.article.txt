"1 am mad about you Dear Heart and
sick at the thought of our parting and
the days of separation and longing that
are to follow. It is a wonderful world that
you have created for me, Morton dear,
but how I am to adjust it to the other
world is difficult to conceive. Perhaps
when 1 am once more on land my menial
vision will be clearer — at present, in
the whole universe I see but one thing,
am conscious of but one thing, you, and
our love for each other."
In this burst of emotion very different
from the controlled conservatism dis
played in her novels, Edith Wharton
wrote longingly to her lover Morton
Fullerton, an American journalist she
met in Paris. More than 300 letters from
Wharton to Fullerton are in existence
and a large sampling of these passionate
epistles appear in "The Letters of Edith
Wharton," the recently published collec
tion edited by R.W.B. Lewis and Nancy
Lewis.
The letters provide a very close look
at a remarkable woman who disappointed
the expectations of late 19th century New
York society by becoming a writer. Never
encouraged to pursue her literary
leanings, Edith Jones grew up in an in
tellectually starved environment and con
stantly sought stimulating companion
ship. Marriage to Boston socialite Teddy

Wharton did nothing to encourage
Edith's talents or bring her happiness.
Although the couple was affectionate,
their union was in all respects sexless,
and Edith Wharton's capability for pas
sion was submerged.
Instead, she channeled all of her energy
into writing — Wharton wrote 15 novels
and numerous short stories, essays, and

articles. It was as a novelist of manners
that she gained the most attention. In
1921, she won the Pulitzer Prize for "The
Age of Innocence," her recollection of a
New York society that had vanished
forever.
In"The Letters of Edith Wharton,"
editors R.W.B Lewis, who wrote a Pulit
zer Prize winning biography of Wharton,
and Nancy Lewis, author of several ar
ticles on Wharton's work, offer their ex
tensive knowledge of the writer and the
events which prompted her prolific cor
respondence dating from 1874 to 1937.
Choosing from more than 4,000 letters
extant was no easy task for the Lewises
who finally selected approximately 400
for inclusion in this volume. The epis
tolary art of Edith Wharton, perhaps one
of the last great letter writers, becomes
immediately apparent in the collection
which ranges from 12-year-old innocence
to eloquent mournings. And indeed,
Wharton's letters are art: as vibrant and
varied as her fiction, each letter has a
different voice depending on its recipient.
Yet, the style of each is unmistakably
Wharton. The compelling narration,
witty dialogue and remarkable grasp of
language that characterize her novels are
all present in her abundant correspond
ence.
As the Lewises observe, "the letters of
Edith Wharton oscillate between the
literary and the friendly: between the
more or less consciously composed and
the gracefully expressed at one moment,
and the gossipy, the querying, the com
miserating at another."
Belonging to the group of the more
"consciously composed" are letters to her
editors at Scribners which expose the

no-nonsense business side of Wharton. A
better understanding of the author's per
sonality, however, is derived from her
personal correspondence with friends
such as Bernard Berenson, the distin
guished Italian Renaissance art connois
seur and historian, Berenson's wife Mary,
Gaillard Lapsley, an American professor
of medieval history at Cambridge and
Sara Norton, daughter of Harvard Uni
versity professor Charles Eliot Norton.
Henry James could be counted among
Edith's closest friends and she wrote him
more than 100 letters, but unfortunately
he destroyed most of them.
Perhaps the most remarkable letters
in this collection are the ones to Morton
Fullerton, undeniably the grand passion
of Wharton's life. Scholars assumed for
many years that the lovers' correspond
ence during the peak of their affair had
been destroyed, but 300 of Wharton's
letters to Fullerton appeared mysteri
ously in 1980. They were offered for sale
by a Dutch bookselling firm acting on
behalf of an antiquarian bookdealer in
Paris who did not realize the letters' sig
nificance. Where these letters were hid
den or forgotten in the nearly 30 years
since Fullerton's death remains un
known.
Wharton's letters to Fullerton begin in
1907 during the earliest stages of exciting
romance and discreet rendezvous and
continue to trace the affair to a fevered
pitch of emotional fulfillment for Edith
Wharton.
One letter that spans three days of
June in 1908 is dubbed "a masterpiece"
by the Lewises who say that "in
retrospect, we recognize the letter ... as
marking a moment of well-nigh perfect

poise and balance in Edith Wharton's
sense of the affair."
Although her relationship with Fuller
ton brought Wharton a previously un
known fufillment, the happiness did not
last for long — in the next two years
the relationship fluctuated between erotic
passion and tormented heartbreak.
Wharton's letters to Fullerton during
this time are full of an emotion and
vulnerability that most people never
guessed she possessed. After a "long se
cret night together," Wharton wrote that
"I have been completely happy. 1 have
had evervthing in life that I ever longed
for."
But Fullerton was not the man Whar
ton believed him to be: He treated her
poorly and went for many weeks without
responding to her letters and pleas for
reply. And so to the same man she ad
dressed as "Dear Heart," Edith Wharton
wrote: "My life was better before I knew
you. That is, for me, the sad conclusion
of this sad year. And it is a bitter thing
to say to the one being one has ever
loved d'amour."
In"The Letters of Edith Wharton,"
the exuberant joy and the unfortunate
pain of an American author reveal them
selves in a lifetime of correspondence.
Wharton was not only a prolific letter
writer but an eloquent one as well, as
this intelligently edited volume will prove.
Fans of Wharton's fiction will undoubt
edly welcome this inside look at the
novelist of manners, but even those un
familiar with her work will consider this
a valuable collection of remarkable writ
ing.

June in 1908 is dubbed "a masterpiece"
by the Lewises who say that "in
retrospect, we recognize the letter ... as
marking a moment of well-nigh perfect

poise and balance in Edith Wharton's
sense of the affair."
Although her relationship with Fuller
ton brought Wharton a previously un
known fufillment, the happiness did not
last for long — in the next two years
the relationship fluctuated between erotic
passion and tormented heartbreak.
Wharton's letters to Fullerton during
this time are full of an emotion and
vulnerability that most people never
guessed she possessed. After a "long se
cret night together," Wharton wrote that
"I have been completely happy. 1 have
had evervthing in life that I ever longed
for."
But Fullerton was not the man Whar
ton believed him to be: He treated her
poorly and went for many weeks without
responding to her letters and pleas for
reply. And so to the same man she ad
dressed as "Dear Heart," Edith Wharton
wrote: "My life was better before I knew
you. That is, for me, the sad conclusion
of this sad year. And it is a bitter thing
to say to the one being one has ever
loved d'amour."
In"The Letters of Edith Wharton,"
the exuberant joy and the unfortunate
pain of an American author reveal them
selves in a lifetime of correspondence.
Wharton was not only a prolific letter
writer but an eloquent one as well, as
this intelligently edited volume will prove.
Fans of Wharton's fiction will undoubt
edly welcome this inside look at the
novelist of manners, but even those un
familiar with her work will consider this
a valuable collection of remarkable writ
ing.

"1 am mad about you Dear Heart and
sick at the thought of our parting and
the days of separation and longing that
are to follow. It is a wonderful world that
you have created for me, Morton dear,
but how I am to adjust it to the other
world is difficult to conceive. Perhaps
when 1 am once more on land my menial
vision will be clearer — at present, in
the whole universe I see but one thing,
am conscious of but one thing, you, and
our love for each other."
In this burst of emotion very different
from the controlled conservatism dis
played in her novels, Edith Wharton
wrote longingly to her lover Morton
Fullerton, an American journalist she
met in Paris. More than 300 letters from
Wharton to Fullerton are in existence
and a large sampling of these passionate
epistles appear in "The Letters of Edith
Wharton," the recently published collec
tion edited by R.W.B. Lewis and Nancy
Lewis.
The letters provide a very close look
at a remarkable woman who disappointed
the expectations of late 19th century New
York society by becoming a writer. Never
encouraged to pursue her literary
leanings, Edith Jones grew up in an in
tellectually starved environment and con
stantly sought stimulating companion
ship. Marriage to Boston socialite Teddy

Wharton did nothing to encourage
Edith's talents or bring her happiness.
Although the couple was affectionate,
their union was in all respects sexless,
and Edith Wharton's capability for pas
sion was submerged.
Instead, she channeled all of her energy
into writing — Wharton wrote 15 novels
and numerous short stories, essays, and

articles. It was as a novelist of manners
that she gained the most attention. In
1921, she won the Pulitzer Prize for "The
Age of Innocence," her recollection of a
New York society that had vanished
forever.
In"The Letters of Edith Wharton,"
editors R.W.B Lewis, who wrote a Pulit
zer Prize winning biography of Wharton,
and Nancy Lewis, author of several ar
ticles on Wharton's work, offer their ex
tensive knowledge of the writer and the
events which prompted her prolific cor
respondence dating from 1874 to 1937.
Choosing from more than 4,000 letters
extant was no easy task for the Lewises
who finally selected approximately 400
for inclusion in this volume. The epis
tolary art of Edith Wharton, perhaps one
of the last great letter writers, becomes
immediately apparent in the collection
which ranges from 12-year-old innocence
to eloquent mournings. And indeed,
Wharton's letters are art: as vibrant and
varied as her fiction, each letter has a
different voice depending on its recipient.
Yet, the style of each is unmistakably
Wharton. The compelling narration,
witty dialogue and remarkable grasp of
language that characterize her novels are
all present in her abundant correspond
ence.
As the Lewises observe, "the letters of
Edith Wharton oscillate between the
literary and the friendly: between the
more or less consciously composed and
the gracefully expressed at one moment,
and the gossipy, the querying, the com
miserating at another."
Belonging to the group of the more
"consciously composed" are letters to her
editors at Scribners which expose the

no-nonsense business side of Wharton. A
better understanding of the author's per
sonality, however, is derived from her
personal correspondence with friends
such as Bernard Berenson, the distin
guished Italian Renaissance art connois
seur and historian, Berenson's wife Mary,
Gaillard Lapsley, an American professor
of medieval history at Cambridge and
Sara Norton, daughter of Harvard Uni
versity professor Charles Eliot Norton.
Henry James could be counted among
Edith's closest friends and she wrote him
more than 100 letters, but unfortunately
he destroyed most of them.
Perhaps the most remarkable letters
in this collection are the ones to Morton
Fullerton, undeniably the grand passion
of Wharton's life. Scholars assumed for
many years that the lovers' correspond
ence during the peak of their affair had
been destroyed, but 300 of Wharton's
letters to Fullerton appeared mysteri
ously in 1980. They were offered for sale
by a Dutch bookselling firm acting on
behalf of an antiquarian bookdealer in
Paris who did not realize the letters' sig
nificance. Where these letters were hid
den or forgotten in the nearly 30 years
since Fullerton's death remains un
known.
Wharton's letters to Fullerton begin in
1907 during the earliest stages of exciting
romance and discreet rendezvous and
continue to trace the affair to a fevered
pitch of emotional fulfillment for Edith
Wharton.
