## Plagiarists face stiff penalty — if they get caught 
### Chris Owen 
Although several faculty mem
bers say they are satisfied with
their efforts to prevent plagiarism
and do not view it as a major
problem, more than one-fifth of
Stanford students admit to com
mitting this Honor Code violation.
Compared with this relatively
high rate of admitted plagiarism,
the number of cases actually
prosecuted by the University —
no more than 10 last year — is
miniscule. This discrepancy points
to a large number of unreported
violations, but it may also reflect
a tendency among professors to
handle plagiarism on their own.
After participating in a nation
wide survey designed by Columbia
University in 1961 to study the
problem of plagiarism on college
campuses, Stanford commis
sioned subsequent surveys of its
own students. Distributed in
1976, 1980 and 1984, these sur
veys asked student respondents
whether they had ever committed
plagiarism.
Between 15 and 21 percent of
respondents admitted to "having
plagiarized from published mate
rial on papers" sometime during
their Stanford career.
"One of the things that was
astonishing (about the surveys'
results) was how little things
changed" over the years, Judicial
Affairs Officer Sally Cole told The
Daily recently. "There's some kind
of truthful reporting out there,"
she said.
Despite the high number of
Stanford students who have ad
mitted to committing plagiarism,
several faculty members said they
do not see the issue as one of
pressing concern.
Martin Evans, chair of the Eng
lish Department said he is "not
sure that it's preventable." Ac
cording to Evans, educating stu

dents about unintentional
plagiarism has its limits because
most plagiarists he has encoun
tered "knew what they were
doing" and broke down immedi
ately when confronted with
evidence of their wrongdoing.

'Clearly society
doesn't think it's as
bad to steal ideas
(as objects). To
most people, ideas
aren't all that im
portant.'
— Charles Fifer

Cole said that among the cases
she has reviewed, "there was not
even discussion that this
(plagiarism) could have been an
accident."
However, Prof. Charles Fifer,
director of Freshman English,
notes that freshmen sometimes
unintentionally commit
plagiarism in their English
courses because they are "not
sure of what's allowable [and]
what isn't."
In order to avoid accidental
plagiarism, Freshman English
professors discuss the violation
with their students and distribute
a handout which defines
plagiarism, Fifer said.
According to the handout,
plagiarism is "the action of using
without due acknowledgment the
thoughts, writing, scholarship (or)
inventions of another." The hand
out further describes conscious
plagiarism as "cheating and/or
theft" and identifies it as "a

serious moral issue" in the Uni
versity's eyes.
However, Fifer said he does not
expect plagiarism to disappear. "I
don't think our society looks at
it as all that criminal," he said.
"Clearly society doesn't think it's
as bad to steal ideas (as objects).
To most people, ideas aren't all
that important."
Faculty and staff agree that, in
many if not most cases, plagiarism
results from desperation on the
part of a student trying to meet
a deadline, not from inherent
deviousness.
According to Cole, plagiarists
typically exhibit "behavior that
[is] completely unpredictable
(given) their values and past be
havior."
Fifer's assessment of the typical
plagiarist concurs with Cole's.
"Some perfectly decent people
have committed plagiarism," he
said. "I don't understand why stu
dents do it."
While most faculty members
said they do not believe the fre
quency of plagiarism has in
creased recently, Asst. to the
President Bob Hamrdla said he
believes it has.
In Hamrdla's view, "society is
simply more permissive. . . . We
tend to increasingly mask the fact
that these actions (plagiarism) are
simply wrong by trying — in what
can be convulsive fashion — to
rationalize them."
Hamrdla said he suspects that
students have become signifi
cantly less willing to report their
peers — though it's mandated by
the Honor Code — and that this
reluctancy has created a "situa
tional inconsistency"
Although he warns students not
to plagiarize, Hamardla admits
that he "won't report [a violation]
when I see it." He stressed that
he does not want "to rag on stu
dents. "

However, Cole said that, in her
six years as Judicial Affairs Offi
cer, she has not witnessed any
decline in students' willingness to
report their peers' Honor Code
infractions.
Cole said that in the 1984 sur
vey, in which students were asked
what they would do if they saw
another student cheating during
an exam, only 19 percent of re
spondents said they would ignore
the incident. Furthermore, she es
timates that "one-third of all mis
conduct is reported (to her office)
by students."

Ironically, the same surveys
that show significant percentages
of students breaking the Honor
Code by plagiarizing also indicate
that the student body clearly sup
ports the Honor Code.
In the 1984 survey, 94 percent
of respondents said they "believe
in [the Honor Code] very strong
ly" or "think it's a good idea."
However, this 94 percent sup
port for the Honor Code is not
consistent with the 18 percent of
students who admitted to

plagiarism. Cole said this incon
sistency may exist in part because
students who have been accused
by the University of committing
Honor Code violations often
emerge from this disciplinary
process with a renewed sense of
committment to the Honor Code.
Cole said she believes students'
attitudes can change because the
students sometimes voluntarily
admit to Honor Code violations.
In one case a Stanford graduate,
"interested for religious reasons
. . . in correcting past behavior,"
admitted to the University that

he had often acted dishonest. His
violations were so extensive as to
require the revocation of his di
ploma, she said.
Although the University has a
clear procedure for handling
Honor Code violations, not all
plagiarism cases travel this route.
If a professor judges the offense
to be inadvertent, he or she may
arrange for the student simply to
rewrite a paper containing such
plagiarism.
These sorts of cases may never

reach the Judicial Affairs Office,
and thus cause some of the dis
crepancy between the very few
prosecuted cases of plagiarism
each year and the number of stu
dents who admitted to the offense
in surveys.
However, faculty members in
evitably miss many cases of
plagiarism. According to Marci
Sordor, coordinator of the History
track of Western Culture, only
"the really stupid plagiarists get
caught."
When a case of intentional
plagiarism is discovered, it is
usually referred to Cole, in the
the Judicial Affairs Office.
Cole is the first University of
ficial to see these cases. After she
has determined the probability of
guilt, the student must then either
see one of three University deans
or appear before the Stanford
Judicial Council, a committee
composed of students, faculty and
staff.
Typically, a first-time
plagiarism offender receives both
a "No Credit" in the course where
the violation occurred and a one
quarter suspension.
"I really vacillate on whether
(this) is a harsh penalty," Cole
said.
Cole added that she does think
the one-quarter suspension can be
valuable because it forces students
to consider the causes of their
offense and take time to correct
these problems.
The Honor Code states that,
"The faculty will also avoid, as
far as practicable, academic pro
cedure that create temptations to
violate the Honor Code."
The Economics Department has
adopted requirements in its two
writing-intensive courses that
force students to work through
large projects in stages so they
will not find themselves in a sit
uation which invites plagiarism.

The Honor Code states that,

The Economics Department has

Although several faculty mem

Stanford students admit to com

Compared with this relatively
high rate of admitted plagiarism,
the number of cases actually
prosecuted by the University —
no more than 10 last year — is
miniscule. This discrepancy points
to a large number of unreported

a tendency among professors to
handle plagiarism on their own.
After participating in a nation
wide survey designed by Columbia
University in 1961 to study the
problem of plagiarism on college
campuses, Stanford commis
sioned subsequent surveys of its
own students. Distributed in
1976, 1980 and 1984, these sur
veys asked student respondents
whether they had ever committed
plagiarism.
Between 15 and 21 percent of
respondents admitted to "having
plagiarized from published mate
rial on papers" sometime during
their Stanford career.
"One of the things that was
astonishing (about the surveys'

Cole said that among the cases
she has reviewed, "there was not
even discussion that this
(plagiarism) could have been an
accident."
However, Prof. Charles Fifer,
director of Freshman English,
notes that freshmen sometimes
unintentionally commit
plagiarism in their English
courses because they are "not
sure of what's allowable [and]
what isn't."
In order to avoid accidental
plagiarism, Freshman English
professors discuss the violation
with their students and distribute
a handout which defines
plagiarism, Fifer said.
According to the handout,
plagiarism is "the action of using
without due acknowledgment the
thoughts, writing, scholarship (or)
inventions of another." The hand
out further describes conscious
plagiarism as "cheating and/or
theft" and identifies it as "a

serious moral issue" in the Uni
versity's eyes.
However, Fifer said he does not
expect plagiarism to disappear. "I
don't think our society looks at
it as all that criminal," he said.
"Clearly society doesn't think it's
as bad to steal ideas (as objects).
To most people, ideas aren't all
that important."
Faculty and staff agree that, in
many if not most cases, plagiarism
results from desperation on the
part of a student trying to meet
a deadline, not from inherent
deviousness.
According to Cole, plagiarists
typically exhibit "behavior that
[is] completely unpredictable
(given) their values and past be
havior."
Fifer's assessment of the typical
plagiarist concurs with Cole's.
"Some perfectly decent people
have committed plagiarism," he
said. "I don't understand why stu
dents do it."
While most faculty members
said they do not believe the fre
quency of plagiarism has in
creased recently, Asst. to the
President Bob Hamrdla said he
believes it has.
In Hamrdla's view, "society is
simply more permissive. . . . We
tend to increasingly mask the fact
that these actions (plagiarism) are
simply wrong by trying — in what
can be convulsive fashion — to
rationalize them."
Hamrdla said he suspects that
students have become signifi
cantly less willing to report their
peers — though it's mandated by
the Honor Code — and that this
reluctancy has created a "situa
tional inconsistency"
Although he warns students not
to plagiarize, Hamardla admits
that he "won't report [a violation]
when I see it." He stressed that
he does not want "to rag on stu
dents. "

However, Cole said that, in her
six years as Judicial Affairs Offi
cer, she has not witnessed any
decline in students' willingness to
report their peers' Honor Code
infractions.
Cole said that in the 1984 sur
vey, in which students were asked
what they would do if they saw
another student cheating during
an exam, only 19 percent of re
spondents said they would ignore
the incident. Furthermore, she es
timates that "one-third of all mis
conduct is reported (to her office)
by students."

Ironically, the same surveys
that show significant percentages
of students breaking the Honor
Code by plagiarizing also indicate
that the student body clearly sup
ports the Honor Code.
In the 1984 survey, 94 percent
of respondents said they "believe
in [the Honor Code] very strong
ly" or "think it's a good idea."
However, this 94 percent sup
port for the Honor Code is not
consistent with the 18 percent of
students who admitted to

plagiarism. Cole said this incon
sistency may exist in part because
students who have been accused
by the University of committing
Honor Code violations often
emerge from this disciplinary
process with a renewed sense of
committment to the Honor Code.
Cole said she believes students'
attitudes can change because the
students sometimes voluntarily
admit to Honor Code violations.
In one case a Stanford graduate,
"interested for religious reasons
. . . in correcting past behavior,"
admitted to the University that

he had often acted dishonest. His
violations were so extensive as to
require the revocation of his di
ploma, she said.
Although the University has a
clear procedure for handling
Honor Code violations, not all
plagiarism cases travel this route.
If a professor judges the offense
to be inadvertent, he or she may
arrange for the student simply to
rewrite a paper containing such
plagiarism.
These sorts of cases may never

reach the Judicial Affairs Office,
and thus cause some of the dis
crepancy between the very few
prosecuted cases of plagiarism
each year and the number of stu
dents who admitted to the offense
in surveys.
However, faculty members in
evitably miss many cases of
plagiarism. According to Marci
Sordor, coordinator of the History
track of Western Culture, only
"the really stupid plagiarists get
caught."
When a case of intentional
plagiarism is discovered, it is

require the revocation of his di
ploma, she said.
Although the University has a
clear procedure for handling
Honor Code violations, not all
plagiarism cases travel this route.
If a professor judges the offense
to be inadvertent, he or she may
arrange for the student simply to
rewrite a paper containing such
plagiarism.
These sorts of cases may never

reach the Judicial Affairs Office,
and thus cause some of the dis
crepancy between the very few
prosecuted cases of plagiarism
each year and the number of stu
dents who admitted to the offense
in surveys.
However, faculty members in
evitably miss many cases of
plagiarism. According to Marci
Sordor, coordinator of the History
track of Western Culture, only
"the really stupid plagiarists get
caught."
When a case of intentional
plagiarism is discovered, it is
usually referred to Cole, in the
the Judicial Affairs Office.
Cole is the first University of
ficial to see these cases. After she
has determined the probability of
guilt, the student must then either
see one of three University deans
or appear before the Stanford
Judicial Council, a committee
composed of students, faculty and
staff.
Typically, a first-time
plagiarism offender receives both
a "No Credit" in the course where
the violation occurred and a one
quarter suspension.
"I really vacillate on whether
(this) is a harsh penalty," Cole
said.
Cole added that she does think
the one-quarter suspension can be
valuable because it forces students
to consider the causes of their
offense and take time to correct
these problems.
The Honor Code states that,
"The faculty will also avoid, as
far as practicable, academic pro
cedure that create temptations to
violate the Honor Code."
The Economics Department has
adopted requirements in its two
writing-intensive courses that
force students to work through
large projects in stages so they
will not find themselves in a sit
uation which invites plagiarism.
