## Baseball pitted against Bulldogs 
### Robert Portnoy Senior staff writer 
Going into last weekend, Stanford
needed help from Arizona to challenge
for third place in the Pacific 10 Con
ference Southern Division.
Two home losses to UCLA later, the
Cardinal nine may need divine help to
reach post-season play.
Stanford was really not in bad shape
when the Bruins arrived for a three
game set last Friday. Trailing third
place USC by four games, the Cardinal
knew a Wildcat sweep of the visiting
Trojans was possible. Two of three from
UCLA might put Stanford in striking
distance.
It was not to be. When all was said
and done, Arizona had swept USC and
the Bruins — not the Cardinal — had
seized the moment, narrowly missing a
sweep and moving within two games of
the Trojans.
Now the two-time defending national
champion will need a miracle finish to
make an NCAA regional. With 12 games
left on its schedule, the Cardinal —
whose longest winning streak this year
is four — must put together a hot streak
unlike any this season. Ten wins would
put the Cardinal at 31-27 and teetering
on the bubble.
Such a record would not do it for any
other team. But the Cardinal has its
title defense and strength of schedule
working for it in the battle for an at
large regional bid.
"I've found with this team that if we
look beyond, we don't do as well. We've
just got to lode at each game and see
if we can get a win," Stanford Coach
Mark Marquess said.
If that is going to happen, it must
start today. Stanford hosts nationally
ranked Fresno State, a team the Car
dinal beat in last year's College World
Series. A Big West power at 9-2, the
Bulldogs are 31-15 overall and have won
19 of their last 25 games, including 10
of the last 13.
"It's a real big game. They're on top
of their league and ranked. We're

definitely not going to give up on [post
season playj. We've struggled too hard
to stop now," pitcher Steve Chitren said.
A Cardinal victory over a likely
playoff team would be a start. It would
be Stanford's second win over Fresno
State this year. The Bulldogs visited
Sunken Diamond on Feb. 15 and the
Cardinal eeked out a 2-1 win.
After that, things will only get tough
er. Stanford hosts conference-leading
Arizona this weekend, with two-of-three
victories an absolute must.
Arizona is ablaze. The 'Cats have won
their last 11 straight and nine in a row
in the Six-Pac, coming off consecutive
sweeps of UCLA, California and USC.
Arizona is fourth in Collegiate Base
ball's national rankings and third in
Baseball America's. They have a team
batting average of .319 and a team ERA
of 3.47.
Two or three Cardinal wins over Ar
izona will turn the heads of NCAA of
ficials. Clearly.
Something of a breather follows the
'Cats. Stanford goes to St. Mary's for
a game on May 2 — the Cardinal
trounced the Gaels 13-5 on the Farm
last Tuesday.
Then things heat up again with three
games against cross-bay rival California

that following weekend. The Bears took
two of three from Stanford to open the
Six-Pac season but have hit the skids
recently, dropping three at Arizona St.
last weekend to seize sole possession of
the Six-Pac cellar.
The Cardinal closes out the season
with four non-conference games. A
home contest against a tough Santa
Clara team — the Broncos took two
straight from Stanford to open the
season — is followed by a trip to Stock
ton to meet University of the Pacific.
The Cardinal clubbed Pacific 22-0 at
Sunken Diamond on April 4.
The season wraps up with two games
at Pepperdine, another team at the top
of its conference. A sweep in their park
to finish a season-ending hot streak
would send the message to NCAA offi
cials that Stanford just might deserve
a chance to defend its crown.
After such an ethereal finish, how
could the NCAA refuse a two-time
defending champion?
Correction
The Daily yesterday reported that Stan
ford pitcher Steve Chitren'B complete-game
victory on Sunday was his second of the
season. In fact, his start at Arizona on March
12 was not a complete game, as Stan Spencer
came on in relief to get the win.

Senior Frank Carey, with a .968 fielding percentage this season, leads the Cardinal
against Fresno State today at Sunken Diamond.
