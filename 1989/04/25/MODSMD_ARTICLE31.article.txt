# The
						Pirates in last? The Orioles in first? Parody at last?
## 
### 
Baseball 1988 was weird, but Base
ball 1989 is just plain goofy.
In 1988, the Baltimore Orioles
lost their first 21 games, dropping them
in last place and eliminating them from
the American League East division race.
In 1989, the Orioles are now in first
place. Admittedly, their record is only
9-9, but hey, you gonna deny what a
difference a year makes?
The Orioles sum up the alchemy that
has hit Major League Baseball this
season. Parity is King, because no team
has yet proven themselves worthy of the
throne.
The Pittsburgh Pirates are currently
last in the National League East, but are
only two games out. If the Bucs win their
next two against the San Diego Padres
today and tomorrow they could move
from last to first quicker than a student
in line to vote in the ASSU runoff elec
tions.
Currently one spot ahead of Pittsburgh
in fifth are the preseason favorites, the

New York Mets. Despite their slow start,
there is no reason to believe they won't
win the division. Their starting rotation,
as usual, will remain excellent even if
inflicted with a mcyor injury, and the
team won't be hitting .227 forever.
But, it may take them a while. Don't
forget, the Mets didn't shake second-place
Pittsburgh last season until August. With
improved clubs in St. Louis, Chicago and
Montreal (the Expos are 10-9 now with

Tim Raines hitting only .254), the NL
East figures to have multiple contenders
until September.
It's the same sort of thing in the AL
West. The Oakland A's, the overwhelm
ing preseason favorites, won't romp but
will prevail.
The individuals on the A's pitching
staff (outside of fireman Dennis Eck
ersley) may not impress you, but as a
group they will stifle you. And when Mes
srs. McGwire and Canseco ride like
Jaguars off the disabled list and blast
away like loaded semi-automatic weap
ons, the AL West will fall into Oakland's
"mature" hands.
But, not before Minnesota's Frank
Viola breaks out of his temporary slump
and teams with Kirby Puckett to keep
the Twins contending, and not before the
Rangers' flowering Bobby Witt and phee
nomenal Nolan Ryan help Texas stay
afloat. Plus, Bo Jackson already has six
home runs for the Royals, and if there's
any doubt that there is a new attitude

in Kansas City after a tumultuous season
last year, witness 35-year-old George
Brett stealing three bases in a game.
That team wants to win.
The NL West is the expert in parity
â€” it had five teams play .500 ball or
better last year. This year, Atlanta wants
to join the parity party.
Of all the early-season pretenders, the
Braves are closest to being for real. Every
prognosticator picked Atlanta for last this
year, but many of them would still have
named them as NL West favorites in
1990 or '91. What's happening, however,
is that the great young arms that are
going to propel the Braves in the '90s
are already starting to hit it big:
household names like Jose Alvarez, Derek
Lilliquist and Tom Glavine.
Though Atlanta is still too young to
be viewed as a serious contender, expect
that the NL West race will go down to
the final week, if not day, and expect the
Cincinnati Reds, Los Angeles Dodgers

and San Diego to be the ones racing.
Cincinnati and Los Angeles both figure
to start hitting better (the Reds' Kal
Daniels and Eric Davis are currently both
under .220; the Dodgers have four
starters under that mark). Also, their
pitching can't get worse, not with Cin
cinnati's Danny Jackson currently 1-4
and John Tudor and Ramon Martinez
scheduled to bail out the aching Fernando
Valenzuela this summer.
And San Diego should hang tough until
they finally trade Sandy Alomar Jr. and
fill some holes in the longest-awaited deal
since God promised the Hebrews thid
great piece of land way back when.
Finally, back to the AL East and those
wacky Orioles, bidding for the 1989 Title
after being the 1988 Titanic. What can
you say?
You can say, in the spirit of Baseball
1989, they are good enough to be last
and bad enough to be first.
