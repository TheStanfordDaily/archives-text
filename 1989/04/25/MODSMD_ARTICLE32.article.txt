### Hugh R. Bethell Staff writer 
For the last time this season, the Stanford sailing
team headed out on the waters of San Francisco
Bay this weekend to compete for the Northern
Series title. Ending the regular season on a high
note, the Cardinal captured first and third at the
last event and first overall in the series that began
over two months ago.
In addition, the Stanford team amassed a 5-1
record in a separate team-racing event, thereby qual
ifying for the Pacific Coast Championships in that
division as well as in dinghy racing and women's
racing.
In the final contest of the Northern Series, Stan
ford's toughest challenge came from rival California,
which was at full strength on its home waters and
only two points behind the Cardinal in the overall
standings.
By day's end, however, Stanford had captured
both first and third place. Sophomore Dave Dowd,
sailing with freshmen Lydia Snape and Ted Huang,
took first in the A Division, and sophomore Scott
Dale and junior Sue Kown won in the B Division,
putting the combination into first place overall.
Stanford's scoring boat, sailed by junior Robert
Brown and sophomore Heidi Park in the A Division,
and seniors Ev Rend and Amy Baltzer in the B
Division took third overall, just behind California.
The Cardinal left the regatta site on Saturday
with the Northern Series trophy which it has held
for four years straight. As a result of the series
victory, the Cardinal will travel to the Pacific Coast
Championships in Los Angeles in two weeks as the
northern district's top seed.
Sunday's racing, which involved teams of three
boats racing each other in a round-robin format,
established which schools would represent the north
em district in the last eliminations before the na
tional championships.
Stanford's only loss in that contest came in a
close race with California.
According to Stanford Coach Blake Middleton,
the weekend was a great end to the season.
"Everyone did a good job at these regattas, es
pecially our younger sailors and our women's team.
I'm excited about what these sailors will do in the
future," Middleton said.
