Stanford's Andy Sinclair, who started the last 45
games for the Cardinal football team, including the
last 34 at center, was drafted yesterday by the San
Francisco 49ers in the 10th round of the NFL Draft.
The 6-foot-3, 285-pound Sinclair was the 280 th
pick overall and the last pick in the 10th round of
the 12-round draft.
"I'm really excited about being drafted by the
49ers," Sinclair said upon learning of his selection
by San Francisco. "For me, it's a dream come
true. ... I love the Bay Area, and I'll be trying out
for a team right down the street."
Sinclair, from Huntington Beach, Calif., was
named a Second-Team All-America by the UPI at
the end of the 1988 season and has been a Second-
Team All-Pacific 10 Conference selection each of
the last three years.
Former Stanford Coach Jack Elway once said that
Sinclair "is a complete lineman. ... He's strong,
physical and has the intelligence to play a very
demanding position [at center. 1"
Although Sinclair played center for the Cardinal
the last three years, he may play elsewhere on the
offensive line, probably at guard, for the Super Bowl
champion 49ers.
"[Offensive line coach Bobb McKittrickl told me
that they'll look at me as a center, but to be prepared
to work out at guard as well," Sinclair said. "That's
fine with me, since I've played both positions in
college."
Sinclair played all 11 games of the 1985 season
at the left guard position after starter Kevin Payne
suffered torn ligaments during fall practice.
