# Tennis match canceled
## 
### 
About the only thing the Stanford women's tennis
team hasn't succeeded at recently is beating UCLA
in the Stanford Tennis Stadium. The Bruins haven't
lost to the defending national champs here since
1986.
Yesterday, the Cardinal was denied a chance to
avenge those losses as rain caused the cancellation
of the scheduled UCLA-Stanford showdown. The
match will not be rescheduled
