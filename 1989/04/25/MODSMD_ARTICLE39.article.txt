# Pro-lifers decide not to confront ralliers

### Elaine Riggs Staff writer 
Members of Stanford Stu
dents for Life did not visibly
attend yesterday's pro-choice
rally because they did not want
to risk a confrontation between
their group and the Pro-Choice
Alliance, according to member
Joyce Keen.
"We decided to let them have
their day," said Keen, a junior.
Although Stanford Students
for Life had planned to hand
out their own literature at yes
terday's rally, Keen said they
changed their minds over the
weekend.
"We didn't want to become
(the Pro-Choice Alliance's) tar
get. It would have been con
frontational," Keen said.
Stanford Students for Life
member Andy Corr, a co
terminal student in electrical
engineering, said he didn't at
tend the rally because "it would
have been pretty upsetting to
W
go.
"It's kind of a bummer to
see that many people who be
lieve ... that they're right,"
Corr said.
"In a way I wanted to go
because it's important to see
what the other side has to say.
But I wasn't up for it today,"
Corr said.
Keen, who attended a few
minutes of the hour-long rally,
later expressed sharply differ
ing views from those set forth

'We decided to
let them have
their day.'

In her speech at the rally,
Director of the Sunnyvale Fam
ily Planning Clinic Diana
Workman accused pro-life pro
testers of blocking not only
women who wanted to have
abortions, but also those who
wanted to receive prenatal care
for wanted pregnancies.
Keen agreed that "we can't
tell" whether a woman in a
family planning clinic is there
to discuss a wanted or an un
wanted pregnancy.
However, Keen, who has
been arrested several times for
pro-life protests at family plan
ning clinics, said "it is ethically
inconsistent" that a pregnant
woman can enter a clinic and
either receive care for her preg
nancy or terminate it.
"It's a life-or-death situation
for the unborn baby of the
woman who is planning to have
an abortion. It's not a life-or
death situation for the unborn
baby of the woman who plans
to have that baby. So we don't
think we're doing harm to the
babies who will be born," Keen
said.
