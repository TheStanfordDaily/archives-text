Whether you have let another student
copy a homework assignment, borrowed a
friend's ID to buy an Apple computer at
the Bookstore or beaten up another student,
you may have violated University policy
and could face disciplinary action.
Two disciplinary bodies govern under
graduate and graduate students: the resi
dential deans, who handle both minor and
cases of behavioral misconduct, and
the Judicial Affairs Office, which
prosecutes both academic and behavioral
misconduct of a serious nature.
Because most students who violate Uni
versity policy commit only minor infrac
tions, they only come into contact with
residential deans.

to respect the rights of others at all times."
In ensuring that students "respect the
rights of others," residential deans rely first
on resident assistants and resident fellows
to handle problems by speaking with the
student. According to Larimore, most in
fractions are handled at this level.
"Letting people know they don't have
the right to do what they are doing is
usually all it takes. People here are pretty
level-headed," said Larimore.
Residential deans rely first on residential
staffs because the deans believe in handling
problems on a "local level," said Diana
Conklin, director of residential deans. "The
people who know each other best and are
