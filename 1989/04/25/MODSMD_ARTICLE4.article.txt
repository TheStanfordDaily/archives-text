# Stanford's judicial channels
## 
### John Cuerva Staff writer 
Whether you have let another student
copy a homework assignment, borrowed a
friend's ID to buy an Apple computer at
the Bookstore or beaten up another student,
you may have violated University policy
and could face disciplinary action.
Two disciplinary bodies govern under
graduate and graduate students: the resi
dential deans, who handle both minor and
cases of behavioral misconduct, and
the Judicial Affairs Office, which
prosecutes both academic and behavioral
misconduct of a serious nature.
Because most students who violate Uni
versity policy commit only minor infrac
tions, they only come into contact with
residential deans.
Each residential dean counsels students
who have academic difficulties and provides
leadership to residential staffs in times of
crisis, such as attempted suicides, according
to Residential Dean Jim Larimore, who is
responsible for discipline in Branner,
Florence Moore and Toyon Halls.
The Residential Agreement, which all stu
dents in University housing must sign,
guides the deans tin resolving behavorial
problems. The agreement states: "You
(the undersigned) agree to comply with all
University policies governing occupancy of
University residences, as may be changed

The Fundamental Standard
Students at Stanford are expected
to show both within and without the
University such respect for order,
morality, personal honor and the
rights of others as is demanded of
good citizens. Failure to do this will
be sufficient cause for removal from
the University.

from time to time; to be considerate of
other residents and the residence staff; and
to respect the rights of others at all times."
In ensuring that students "respect the
rights of others," residential deans rely first
on resident assistants and resident fellows
to handle problems by speaking with the
student. According to Larimore, most in
fractions are handled at this level.
"Letting people know they don't have
the right to do what they are doing is
usually all it takes. People here are pretty
level-headed," said Larimore.
Residential deans rely first on residential
staffs because the deans believe in handling
problems on a "local level," said Diana
Conklin, director of residential deans. "The
people who know each other best and are
closest emotionally and
geographically are better able to
resolve difficulties."
Some students still misbehave
If unruly behavior continues
after the residential staff has
asked the student to stop, the stu
dent may be required to meet with
a residential dean and receive a
verbal or written warning. Accord
ing to Larimore, within his juris
diction only a handful of discipli
nary problems proceed beyond the
residential staff.
Of those few cases where mis
conduct continues, the student
may need to meet with the resi
dential dean for further discipline.
The residential dean may give
the student a formal letter of cen
sure that contains behavioral
stipulations. For example, if a stu
dent has damaged property, the
residential dean may require the
student to pay restitution, refrain
from any destructive behavior and
apologize for the behavior, accord
ing to Larimore.
If the student's misconduct con
tinues, the residential dean can
transfer the student to another
residence or can impose the stric
test penalty available to the res
idential deans: denying a student
University housing — which hap
pened last spring to a freshman
from Otero House who was ac
cused of racist and homophobic
acts against his RA.
Residential deans can evict a
student for just the remainder of
the quarter or indefinitely. How
ever, residential deans deny stu
dents housing only as a "last
resort," said Larimore.
Although problems in the resi
dential dean system are first han
dled at lower levels and then esc
alate as the misconduct worsens,
the system is highly flexible and
can respond with the harshest
penalties at the residential deans
disposal if necessary. Thus, the
residential deans can remove a

student from a residence "very
quickly" if the student's conduct
is endangering others, said Con
klin.
Finding disciplinary solutions
In arriving at solutions to be
havioral problems, residential
deans refer to precedents within
the residential system and consult
each other during step of the proc
ess. According to Conklin, the sys
tem is "consultative" and would
not work unless the residential
deans communicate. Residential
deans meet once a week as a group
for discussion.
When disciplining students, the
residential dean system stresses
education instead of retribution,
said Larimore. For example when
a punishment is handed out, there
is always some discussion with
the student as to why the conduct
was inappropriate, said Larimore.
"We just try to make sure
people connect and really under
stand what they did. We try to
use the discipline as a time when
people really learn something," he
added.
Although not bound by Univer
sity policy, the judicial process is
usually kept confidential out of
respect for the students. Larimore
will often inform the residential
staff of his decisions but not nec
essarily the general public, he
said.
Handling serious violations
The second disciplinary route
— the Judicial Affairs Office —
is responsible for enforcing all
University policies, which in

eludes: the Fundamental Stand
ard, the Honor Code, the Resi
dence Agreement, the Policy on
Campus Disruption and the
Prohibition of the Possession of
Dangerous Weapons. The Honor
Code and Residential Agreement
are academic and residential ap
plications of the Standard, respec
tively.
Judicial Affairs Officer Sally
Cole, who heads the office, acts
as University President Donald
Kennedy's designate in discipli
nary matters. The president, how
ever, has the final word in all
disciplinary matters, personally
approving all punishments stu
dents receive.
Cole's office primarily handles
Fundamental Standard and
Honor Code violations, according
to an annual summary of Judicial
Cases released by Cole's office.
From 1982 through 1988 there
have been a total of a 178 mis
conduct charges — an average of
29 cases a year.
Of those cases, 53 cases were
violations of the Fundamental
Standard, averaging almost nine
a year, and 122 cases were viola
tions of the Honor Code, averag
ing about 20 a year.
In prosecuting violations, Cole
follows a complex and highly for
mal process outlined by the
Legislative and Judicial Charter
of 1968. Cole is the only one able
to initiate charges against stu
dents at this level.
Cole can initiate charges after
a student, faculty or staff member
has filed a complaint, or she in
itiates charges on her own.

Guilty or not guilty?
If a complaint is brought
against a student, Cole first in
terviews both parties involved in
order to establish the facts. Of
the 70 complaints she estimates
she receives annually, one-third
are dropped after talking to the
accused party and receiving a
satisfactory account of the behav
ior, said Cole.
Based on existing University
policy and precedents, Cole deter
mines whether the students ac
tions violated the Standard. If
Cole is unsure whether the policy
has been violated, she will drop
the case because the University
does not believe policy should be
established through the judicial
process.
If University policy and prece
dents do exist for a case, for ex
ample the University has found
plagiarism to be a violation of the
Honor Code, Cole then determines
if there is enough evidence "be
yond a reasonable doubt" to ob
tain a conviction. According to
Cole, "many universities have a
standard of proof less rigorous
than Stanford."
At any time in the process a
student may plead guilty, accord
ing to Cole. If a student pleads
guilty, as the "vast meyority" do,
said Cole, then the student will
meet with an assistant dean of
Student Affairs to discuss the
case. The dean then recommends
to Kennedy a punishment for the
student, which Kennedy can ac
cept or modify as he sees fit.

Bringing in an outsider
If a student pleads innocent, a
hearing officer, who is an outside
attorney hired by the University,
reviews the case. The officer hears
both parties' arguments. The ac
cused student has the right to
present the evidence believed nec
essary for a defense, including
witnesses and the right to legal
counsel.
The hearing officer establishes
the facts, which then become un
appealable. The hearing officer
recommends guilty or not guilty
to the Judicial Council. This coun
cil consists of three faculty and
three student members. A faculty
member and law student act as
co-chairs, breaking ties in non-
Honor Code and Honor Code vi
olations, respectively.
At a hearing of the council —
two or three cases annually
emerge — the council will deter
mine whether the facts found by
the hearing officer violate Univer
sity rules. At this point, the stu
dent may only make motivational
explanations. The council often
takes into consideration the stu
dent's personal situation when
making written penalty recom
mendations to Kennedy, said Cole.
Specific violations
In the past, according to a Uni
versity handbook titled "Regula
tions Governing Student Conduct
and Procedures for Their Enforce
ment," conduct which has violated
the Standard include obvious
criminal acts such as physical as
sualt and theft. Other violations

specific to the University include
presenting invalid or false meal
cards or IDs, misrepresentation in
seeking financial aid, student
housing or other University
benefits, and driving drunk on
campus.
According to the handbook, ex
amples of student conduct that
has violated the Honor Code in
the past include copying from an
other's academic work, unper
mitted collaboration and
plagiarism.
For students found guilty, the
Student Penalty Code lists a num
ber of different penalties Kennedy
can impose. The penalties range
from expulsion from the Univer
sity to a letter of censure or a
combination of penalties.
Sample cases of violations in
clude:
In a precedent setting case in
the 1984-85 school year, an intox
icated student drove his car into
bikes parked on the sidewalk. Be
cause it was a precedent setting
case, he received only a $200 fine
and a one-quarter suspension on
the condition he never drive a
motor vehicle on campus.
During the 1985-86 year, "a
student while quite drunk, entered
another student's dorm room
without her knowledge, urinated
on the bed and subsequently sub
jected the student to verbal har
assment. The penalty levied in
cluded restitution to the victim
for damage to the bed, a $150
fine and a 40-hour work penalty
or an additional $200 fine."

or an additional $200 fine."
Whether you have let another student
copy a homework assignment, borrowed a
friend's ID to buy an Apple computer at
the Bookstore or beaten up another student,
you may have violated University policy
and could face disciplinary action.
Two disciplinary bodies govern under
graduate and graduate students: the resi
dential deans, who handle both minor and
cases of behavioral misconduct, and
the Judicial Affairs Office, which
prosecutes both academic and behavioral
misconduct of a serious nature.
Because most students who violate Uni
versity policy commit only minor infrac
tions, they only come into contact with
residential deans.
Each residential dean counsels students
who have academic difficulties and provides
leadership to residential staffs in times of
crisis, such as attempted suicides, according
to Residential Dean Jim Larimore, who is
responsible for discipline in Branner,
Florence Moore and Toyon Halls.
The Residential Agreement, which all stu
dents in University housing must sign,
guides the deans tin resolving behavorial
problems. The agreement states: "You
(the undersigned) agree to comply with all
University policies governing occupancy of
University residences, as may be changed

The Fundamental Standard
Students at Stanford are expected
to show both within and without the
University such respect for order,
morality, personal honor and the
rights of others as is demanded of
good citizens. Failure to do this will
be sufficient cause for removal from
the University.

from time to time; to be considerate of
other residents and the residence staff; and
to respect the rights of others at all times."
In ensuring that students "respect the
rights of others," residential deans rely first
on resident assistants and resident fellows
to handle problems by speaking with the
student. According to Larimore, most in
fractions are handled at this level.
"Letting people know they don't have
the right to do what they are doing is
usually all it takes. People here are pretty
level-headed," said Larimore.
Residential deans rely first on residential
staffs because the deans believe in handling
problems on a "local level," said Diana
Conklin, director of residential deans. "The
people who know each other best and are
closest emotionally and
geographically are better able to
resolve difficulties."
Some students still misbehave
If unruly behavior continues
after the residential staff has
asked the student to stop, the stu
dent may be required to meet with
a residential dean and receive a
verbal or written warning. Accord
ing to Larimore, within his juris
diction only a handful of discipli
nary problems proceed beyond the
residential staff.
Of those few cases where mis
conduct continues, the student
may need to meet with the resi
dential dean for further discipline.
The residential dean may give
the student a formal letter of cen
sure that contains behavioral
stipulations. For example, if a stu
dent has damaged property, the
residential dean may require the
student to pay restitution, refrain
from any destructive behavior and
apologize for the behavior, accord
ing to Larimore.
If the student's misconduct con
tinues, the residential dean can
transfer the student to another
residence or can impose the stric
test penalty available to the res
idential deans: denying a student
University housing — which hap
pened last spring to a freshman
from Otero House who was ac
cused of racist and homophobic
acts against his RA.
Residential deans can evict a
student for just the remainder of
the quarter or indefinitely. How
ever, residential deans deny stu
dents housing only as a "last
resort," said Larimore.
Although problems in the resi
dential dean system are first han
dled at lower levels and then esc
alate as the misconduct worsens,
the system is highly flexible and
can respond with the harshest
penalties at the residential deans
disposal if necessary. Thus, the
residential deans can remove a

student from a residence "very
quickly" if the student's conduct
is endangering others, said Con
klin.
Finding disciplinary solutions
In arriving at solutions to be
havioral problems, residential
deans refer to precedents within
the residential system and consult
each other during step of the proc
ess. According to Conklin, the sys
tem is "consultative" and would
not work unless the residential
deans communicate. Residential
deans meet once a week as a group
for discussion.
When disciplining students, the
residential dean system stresses
education instead of retribution,
said Larimore. For example when
a punishment is handed out, there
is always some discussion with
the student as to why the conduct
was inappropriate, said Larimore.
"We just try to make sure
people connect and really under
stand what they did. We try to
use the discipline as a time when
people really learn something," he
added.
Although not bound by Univer
sity policy, the judicial process is
usually kept confidential out of
respect for the students. Larimore
will often inform the residential
staff of his decisions but not nec
essarily the general public, he
said.
Handling serious violations
The second disciplinary route
— the Judicial Affairs Office —
is responsible for enforcing all
University policies, which in

eludes: the Fundamental Stand
ard, the Honor Code, the Resi
dence Agreement, the Policy on
Campus Disruption and the
Prohibition of the Possession of
Dangerous Weapons. The Honor
Code and Residential Agreement
are academic and residential ap
plications of the Standard, respec
tively.
Judicial Affairs Officer Sally
Cole, who heads the office, acts
as University President Donald
Kennedy's designate in discipli
nary matters. The president, how
ever, has the final word in all
disciplinary matters, personally
approving all punishments stu
dents receive.
Cole's office primarily handles
Fundamental Standard and
Honor Code violations, according
to an annual summary of Judicial
Cases released by Cole's office.
From 1982 through 1988 there
have been a total of a 178 mis
conduct charges — an average of
29 cases a year.
Of those cases, 53 cases were
violations of the Fundamental
Standard, averaging almost nine
a year, and 122 cases were viola
tions of the Honor Code, averag
ing about 20 a year.
In prosecuting violations, Cole
follows a complex and highly for
mal process outlined by the
Legislative and Judicial Charter
of 1968. Cole is the only one able
to initiate charges against stu
dents at this level.
Cole can initiate charges after
a student, faculty or staff member
has filed a complaint, or she in
itiates charges on her own.

Guilty or not guilty?
If a complaint is brought
against a student, Cole first in
terviews both parties involved in
order to establish the facts. Of
the 70 complaints she estimates
she receives annually, one-third
are dropped after talking to the
accused party and receiving a
satisfactory account of the behav
ior, said Cole.
Based on existing University
policy and precedents, Cole deter
mines whether the students ac
tions violated the Standard. If
Cole is unsure whether the policy
has been violated, she will drop
the case because the University
does not believe policy should be
established through the judicial
process.
If University policy and prece
dents do exist for a case, for ex
ample the University has found
plagiarism to be a violation of the
Honor Code, Cole then determines
if there is enough evidence "be
yond a reasonable doubt" to ob
tain a conviction. According to
Cole, "many universities have a
standard of proof less rigorous
than Stanford."
At any time in the process a
student may plead guilty, accord
ing to Cole. If a student pleads
guilty, as the "vast meyority" do,
said Cole, then the student will
meet with an assistant dean of
Student Affairs to discuss the
case. The dean then recommends
to Kennedy a punishment for the
student, which Kennedy can ac
cept or modify as he sees fit.

Bringing in an outsider
If a student pleads innocent, a
hearing officer, who is an outside
attorney hired by the University,
reviews the case. The officer hears
both parties' arguments. The ac
cused student has the right to
present the evidence believed nec
essary for a defense, including
witnesses and the right to legal
counsel.
The hearing officer establishes
the facts, which then become un
appealable. The hearing officer
recommends guilty or not guilty
to the Judicial Council. This coun
cil consists of three faculty and
three student members. A faculty
member and law student act as
co-chairs, breaking ties in non-
Honor Code and Honor Code vi
olations, respectively.
At a hearing of the council —
two or three cases annually
emerge — the council will deter
mine whether the facts found by
the hearing officer violate Univer
sity rules. At this point, the stu
dent may only make motivational
explanations. The council often
takes into consideration the stu
dent's personal situation when
making written penalty recom
mendations to Kennedy, said Cole.
Specific violations
In the past, according to a Uni
versity handbook titled "Regula
tions Governing Student Conduct
and Procedures for Their Enforce
ment," conduct which has violated
the Standard include obvious
criminal acts such as physical as
sualt and theft. Other violations

specific to the University include
presenting invalid or false meal
cards or IDs, misrepresentation in
seeking financial aid, student
housing or other University
benefits, and driving drunk on
campus.
According to the handbook, ex
amples of student conduct that
has violated the Honor Code in
the past include copying from an
other's academic work, unper
mitted collaboration and
plagiarism.
For students found guilty, the
Student Penalty Code lists a num
ber of different penalties Kennedy
can impose. The penalties range
from expulsion from the Univer
sity to a letter of censure or a
combination of penalties.
Sample cases of violations in
clude:
In a precedent setting case in
the 1984-85 school year, an intox
icated student drove his car into
bikes parked on the sidewalk. Be
cause it was a precedent setting
case, he received only a $200 fine
and a one-quarter suspension on
the condition he never drive a
motor vehicle on campus.
During the 1985-86 year, "a
student while quite drunk, entered
another student's dorm room
without her knowledge, urinated
on the bed and subsequently sub
jected the student to verbal har
assment. The penalty levied in
cluded restitution to the victim
for damage to the bed, a $150
fine and a 40-hour work penalty
or an additional $200 fine."

During the 1985-86 year, "a
student while quite drunk, entered
another student's dorm room
without her knowledge, urinated
on the bed and subsequently sub
jected the student to verbal har
assment. The penalty levied in
cluded restitution to the victim
for damage to the bed, a $150
fine and a 40-hour work penalty
or an additional $200 fine."
Whether you have let another student
copy a homework assignment, borrowed a
friend's ID to buy an Apple computer at
the Bookstore or beaten up another student,
you may have violated University policy
and could face disciplinary action.
Two disciplinary bodies govern under
graduate and graduate students: the resi
dential deans, who handle both minor and
cases of behavioral misconduct, and
the Judicial Affairs Office, which
prosecutes both academic and behavioral
misconduct of a serious nature.
Because most students who violate Uni
versity policy commit only minor infrac
tions, they only come into contact with
residential deans.
Each residential dean counsels students
who have academic difficulties and provides
leadership to residential staffs in times of
crisis, such as attempted suicides, according
to Residential Dean Jim Larimore, who is
responsible for discipline in Branner,
Florence Moore and Toyon Halls.
The Residential Agreement, which all stu
dents in University housing must sign,
guides the deans tin resolving behavorial
problems. The agreement states: "You
(the undersigned) agree to comply with all
University policies governing occupancy of
University residences, as may be changed

The Fundamental Standard
Students at Stanford are expected
to show both within and without the
University such respect for order,
morality, personal honor and the
rights of others as is demanded of
good citizens. Failure to do this will
be sufficient cause for removal from
the University.

from time to time; to be considerate of
other residents and the residence staff; and
to respect the rights of others at all times."
In ensuring that students "respect the
rights of others," residential deans rely first
on resident assistants and resident fellows
to handle problems by speaking with the
student. According to Larimore, most in
fractions are handled at this level.
"Letting people know they don't have
the right to do what they are doing is
usually all it takes. People here are pretty
level-headed," said Larimore.
Residential deans rely first on residential
staffs because the deans believe in handling
problems on a "local level," said Diana
Conklin, director of residential deans. "The
people who know each other best and are
closest emotionally and
geographically are better able to
resolve difficulties."
Some students still misbehave
If unruly behavior continues
after the residential staff has
asked the student to stop, the stu
dent may be required to meet with
a residential dean and receive a
verbal or written warning. Accord
ing to Larimore, within his juris
diction only a handful of discipli
nary problems proceed beyond the
residential staff.
Of those few cases where mis
conduct continues, the student
may need to meet with the resi
dential dean for further discipline.
The residential dean may give
the student a formal letter of cen
sure that contains behavioral
stipulations. For example, if a stu
dent has damaged property, the
residential dean may require the
student to pay restitution, refrain
from any destructive behavior and
apologize for the behavior, accord
ing to Larimore.
If the student's misconduct con
tinues, the residential dean can
transfer the student to another
residence or can impose the stric
test penalty available to the res
idential deans: denying a student
University housing — which hap
pened last spring to a freshman
from Otero House who was ac
cused of racist and homophobic
acts against his RA.
Residential deans can evict a
student for just the remainder of
the quarter or indefinitely. How
ever, residential deans deny stu
dents housing only as a "last
resort," said Larimore.
Although problems in the resi
dential dean system are first han
dled at lower levels and then esc
alate as the misconduct worsens,
the system is highly flexible and
can respond with the harshest
penalties at the residential deans
disposal if necessary. Thus, the
residential deans can remove a

student from a residence "very
quickly" if the student's conduct
is endangering others, said Con
klin.
Finding disciplinary solutions
In arriving at solutions to be
havioral problems, residential
deans refer to precedents within
the residential system and consult
each other during step of the proc
ess. According to Conklin, the sys
tem is "consultative" and would
not work unless the residential
deans communicate. Residential
deans meet once a week as a group
for discussion.
When disciplining students, the
residential dean system stresses
education instead of retribution,
said Larimore. For example when
a punishment is handed out, there
is always some discussion with
the student as to why the conduct
was inappropriate, said Larimore.
"We just try to make sure
people connect and really under
stand what they did. We try to
use the discipline as a time when
people really learn something," he
added.
Although not bound by Univer
sity policy, the judicial process is
usually kept confidential out of
respect for the students. Larimore
will often inform the residential
staff of his decisions but not nec
essarily the general public, he
said.
Handling serious violations
The second disciplinary route
— the Judicial Affairs Office —
is responsible for enforcing all
University policies, which in

eludes: the Fundamental Stand
ard, the Honor Code, the Resi
dence Agreement, the Policy on
Campus Disruption and the
Prohibition of the Possession of
Dangerous Weapons. The Honor
Code and Residential Agreement
are academic and residential ap
plications of the Standard, respec
tively.
Judicial Affairs Officer Sally
Cole, who heads the office, acts
as University President Donald
Kennedy's designate in discipli
nary matters. The president, how
ever, has the final word in all
disciplinary matters, personally
approving all punishments stu
dents receive.
Cole's office primarily handles
Fundamental Standard and
Honor Code violations, according
to an annual summary of Judicial
Cases released by Cole's office.
From 1982 through 1988 there
have been a total of a 178 mis
conduct charges — an average of
29 cases a year.
Of those cases, 53 cases were
violations of the Fundamental
Standard, averaging almost nine
a year, and 122 cases were viola
tions of the Honor Code, averag
ing about 20 a year.
In prosecuting violations, Cole
follows a complex and highly for
mal process outlined by the
Legislative and Judicial Charter
of 1968. Cole is the only one able
to initiate charges against stu
dents at this level.
Cole can initiate charges after
a student, faculty or staff member
has filed a complaint, or she in
itiates charges on her own.

Guilty or not guilty?
If a complaint is brought
against a student, Cole first in
terviews both parties involved in
order to establish the facts. Of
the 70 complaints she estimates
she receives annually, one-third
are dropped after talking to the
accused party and receiving a
satisfactory account of the behav
ior, said Cole.
Based on existing University
policy and precedents, Cole deter
mines whether the students ac
tions violated the Standard. If
Cole is unsure whether the policy
has been violated, she will drop
the case because the University
does not believe policy should be
established through the judicial
process.
If University policy and prece
dents do exist for a case, for ex
ample the University has found
plagiarism to be a violation of the
Honor Code, Cole then determines
if there is enough evidence "be
yond a reasonable doubt" to ob
tain a conviction. According to
Cole, "many universities have a
standard of proof less rigorous
than Stanford."
At any time in the process a
student may plead guilty, accord
ing to Cole. If a student pleads
guilty, as the "vast meyority" do,
said Cole, then the student will
meet with an assistant dean of
Student Affairs to discuss the
case. The dean then recommends
to Kennedy a punishment for the
student, which Kennedy can ac
cept or modify as he sees fit.

Bringing in an outsider
If a student pleads innocent, a
hearing officer, who is an outside
attorney hired by the University,
reviews the case. The officer hears
both parties' arguments. The ac
cused student has the right to
present the evidence believed nec
essary for a defense, including
witnesses and the right to legal
counsel.
The hearing officer establishes
the facts, which then become un
appealable. The hearing officer
recommends guilty or not guilty
to the Judicial Council. This coun
cil consists of three faculty and
three student members. A faculty
member and law student act as
co-chairs, breaking ties in non-
Honor Code and Honor Code vi
olations, respectively.
At a hearing of the council —
two or three cases annually
emerge — the council will deter
mine whether the facts found by
the hearing officer violate Univer
sity rules. At this point, the stu
dent may only make motivational
explanations. The council often
takes into consideration the stu
dent's personal situation when
making written penalty recom
mendations to Kennedy, said Cole.
Specific violations
In the past, according to a Uni
versity handbook titled "Regula
tions Governing Student Conduct
and Procedures for Their Enforce
ment," conduct which has violated
the Standard include obvious
criminal acts such as physical as
sualt and theft. Other violations

specific to the University include
presenting invalid or false meal
cards or IDs, misrepresentation in
seeking financial aid, student
housing or other University
benefits, and driving drunk on
campus.
According to the handbook, ex
amples of student conduct that
has violated the Honor Code in
the past include copying from an
other's academic work, unper
mitted collaboration and
plagiarism.
For students found guilty, the
Student Penalty Code lists a num
ber of different penalties Kennedy
can impose. The penalties range
from expulsion from the Univer
sity to a letter of censure or a
combination of penalties.
Sample cases of violations in
clude:
In a precedent setting case in
the 1984-85 school year, an intox
icated student drove his car into
bikes parked on the sidewalk. Be
cause it was a precedent setting
case, he received only a $200 fine
and a one-quarter suspension on
the condition he never drive a
motor vehicle on campus.
During the 1985-86 year, "a
student while quite drunk, entered
another student's dorm room
without her knowledge, urinated
on the bed and subsequently sub
jected the student to verbal har
assment. The penalty levied in
cluded restitution to the victim
for damage to the bed, a $150
fine and a 40-hour work penalty
or an additional $200 fine."
