# Petition drive aims for Stanford to fix conditions at Webb Ranch
## 
### Rob Burwell Senior staff writer 
"If there is to be a migrant farm
on Stanford land, it should be a
model for the industry, not one
that only meets minimal stand
ards of decency."
So reads a petition to be circu
lated by students and faculty,
aimed at pressuring University
President Donald Kennedy into
working for meyor improvements
at Webb Ranch, a privately owned
farm on 250 acres of land leased
from the University.
The petition drive, spearheaded
by Political Science Prof. John
Manley, will kick off tomorrow.
An information table will be sta
tioned in White Plaza to answer
questions about the USW-Webb
Relief Fund. A 1,800-letter
mailing to faculty and adminis
trative staff asking for contribu
tions to the the fund will also
accompany the petition drive,
Manley said.
This will be the second mailing

asking for contributions for the
workers "living in poverty," Man
ley said. "Some of the workers
and their families are living close
to the margin of subsistence."
In addition to the United Stan
ford Workers union, the effort has
managed to attract support from
about five student volunteers and
the backing of English Prof.
Ronald Rebholz and Biological
Sciences Prof. Dow Woodward.
University officials have repeat
edly maintained that Webb Ranch
is the sole employer of the migrant
worker, and therefore the Univer
sity bears no legal responsibility
for working conditions at the
ranch land.
Organizers plan to distribute
information, including recent
newspaper articles and photo
graphs about Webb Ranch, and to
encourage students to visit Webb
Ranch at noon May 12, according
to Kate Morris, a graduate student
in computer science.
A ranch worker may join two
student volunteers working at the

informational table, Morris said.
Manley pointed out that al
though Webb Ranch workers re
cently joined the USW, they have
yet to reap the rewards. "The
workers still do not have any
benefits yet: no health care, no
decent housing, no holidays, no
vacations," Manley said.
A benefit for the workers will
be held this Friday at Casa
Zapata. The event will feature the
band Dr. Loco, Ballet Folklorico,
speakers from the USW and
workers from Webb Ranch.
Manley said the University di
rectly profits from the ranch
workers. "Webb Ranch workers
are often asked to come to campus
and do 'shit work' that most Uni
versity employees would find un
pleasant, including picking up dog
excrement at the golf course,"
Manley said.
"There are other farm contracts
in the state that are not perfect,
but certainly better than those at
Webb Ranch," Manley said.
