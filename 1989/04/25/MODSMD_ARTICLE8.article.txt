## 
### Rob Burwell Senior staff writer 
Hoover Institution members
are exploring the possibility of
building a small television studio
and satellite uplink to make schol
ars and activities held at the In
stitution more accessible to a
nationwide audience, according to
Assoc. Hoover Director Annelise
Anderson.
The studio and uplink would
allow Hoover scholars to give "ex
pert judgment or background on
issues," Anderson said.
Guests on network news pro
grams, as well as shows like "Mac-
Neil/Lehrer Newshour" and
"Nightline" tend to come from the
East Coast, she said. "The easiest
thing for these shows to do is to
have people walk into a studio in
Washington and New York. It's
much more difficult and expensive
to do it at a distance."
Anderson added that there are
also conferences held at Hoover
that could be of interest to C

SPAN. Citing a recent conference
at Hoover attended by former At
torney General Edwin Mee9e, An
derson said she regretted the
conference was not covered and
added that if it had taken place
on the East Coast, it would have
been covered.
The studio would not be solely
for Hoover's use, however. Accord
ing to Anderson, "It would be
available to the rest of the
Stanford community as well,
through some form of an arrange
ment."
Hoover has also received assis
tance on technical aspects of the
project from the Department of
Engineering, Anderson said. The
Engineering Department already
provides television assistance for
other departments on campus and
broadcasts some engineering
classes to Silicon Valley.
The uplink could even be used
to broadcast Big Game to alumni
with access to satellite downlinks,
she said.
