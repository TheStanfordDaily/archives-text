# Massive biology building project underway

After a year-long delay due to
complaints by environmental ac
tivists, construction is underway
on the Charles Gilbert Biological
Sciences Building, a $33 million
project slated for completion in
1991.
"The building will have a tre
mendous impact on the Depart
ment of Biological Sciences at
Stanford," said Prof. Philip
Hanawalt, chair of the depart
ment. "It will be a facility com
mensurate with the explosive na
ture of the field nationally and
internationally."
The construction plans were
put on hold while the University
prepared an environmental impact

report on the project. Another
proposed building — the $18 mil
lion Research Animal Facility II
— faced a one-year delay that cost
the University $1.3 million for ad
ditional preparation. Because of
the two costly delays, the Univer
sity will likely prepare environ
mental impact statements for all
future projects, Hanawalt said.
The building is part of the $250
million renovation of the Near
West Campus. It will be located
next to the current biological
sciences building, Herrin Hall,
and the Herrin Research Labora
tory. The three buildings will be
linked by a central quad to be
called Biology Green.
The four-story building, de
signed by Canadian architect Ar
thur Erickson, will house 14 lab

oratories, three classrooms, ad
ministrative offices and rooftop
greenhouses designed for modern
molecular plant biology.
"The new building will allow
for needed expansion," Hanawalt
said. "Biology is growing as a
result of new genetic technologies
which promise to do wonderful
things. It behooves Stanford as a
premier institution to be at the
frontier of biology."
The Gilbert Building will relieve
the crowding problems in Herrin
Hall, which now holds 28 groups
— 10 more than it was designed
to hold, Hanawalt said. Professors
and graduate students whose of
fices are located in trailers 500
yards away from the Herrin build
ings will also find permanent

homes when the project is com
pleted.
According to Hanawalt, the new
building will also open up existing
space for specialized facilities. For
example, the basement of Herrin
Hall will be converted into a
"micromolecule support facility"
for modern molecular biological
research.
The building will be named
after Charles Henry Gilbert, the
first zoologist brought to Stanford
by David Starr Jordan, the Uni
versity's first president. Appropri
ately, the $10 million pledge for
the construction of the project
came from the Carl Braun Trust
chaired by Gilbert's grandson,
John Braun.
The rooftop greenhouses will be
surrounded by a red tile roof-
