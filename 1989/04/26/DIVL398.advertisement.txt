Don't wait...
until women are dying again.
Women's lives are in danger.
The Supreme Court may soon decide that abortion
will again be a criminal act. Should this happen, we
will return to the days of back alley abortions, when
women faced fear, pain, degradation and even death
Before 1973, abortion was illegal But that did not
prevent women from having abortions. Each year
1,000,000 desperate American women risked their lives
in hopes of a better future
A small yet vocal minority wants all abortions to
be illegal They seek to deny all access to contracep
tion and to prevent sexuality education in schools They
want to return to the days when there was no hope
for women who found themselves with an unwanted
pregnancy
With a conservative Supreme Court and an anti
abortion President, women will once again be forced
to seek hope in a back alley.
Your reproductive rights are protected by the U.S.
C-onstitution An overwhelming majority of Americans
oppose criminalizing abortion Will you allow your
rights to be taken away by a fanatic few'
Keep abortion safe and legal Don't force women
to look for hope in a back alley.
