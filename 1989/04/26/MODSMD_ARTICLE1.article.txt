Echoing campaign promises to maintain America's
competitive edge, President Bush told a crowd of
500 Ford Aerospace employees in Palo Alto yester
day that the nation can win trade wars abroad by
slashing the deficit and investing in technology at
home.
The president also advocated preserving family
values with a strong child care program.
In his 20-minute speech, Bush outlined his pro
posal to reduce the federal budget deficit in the
next fiscal year beginning Oct.l.
Calling the plan "an agreed outline," Bush
conceded that "tough talks still lie ahead." He com
pared deficit reduction to exercise, "like walking
the dog every day."
Bush used the speech as an opportunity to ad
vocate reducing the capital gains tax as a means of
cutting the deficit. He pleaded with the crowd in
the courtyard of Ford Aerospace to write their local
representatives in support of this tax plan, which
he hopes will cut the deficit by $4.8 billion.
The Bush tax plan, which seeks to reduce taxation
on profits from a sale, has been criticized as a "tax
break" for the rich. Bush denounced the criticism,
saying, "Lower capital gains taxes will create jobs
.. . and help build for a better America."
Giving the "high-five symbol to high-tech" — one
of many sports analogies peppering the president's
speech — Bush explained his new congressional
proposals for greater monetary support to technol
ogy.
Bush has asked Congress to increase NASA's
budget by $2.4 million. He has also proposed elevat
ing the status of the Presidential Science Adviser
Allan Bromley, a nuclear physicist at Yale Univer
sity, and has re-established the National Space
Council. He said he also wants to double the Na
tional Science Foundation budget by 1993.
Bush received occasional applause from the
