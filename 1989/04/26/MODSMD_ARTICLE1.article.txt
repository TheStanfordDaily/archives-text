# Bush outlines his priorities

Echoing campaign promises to maintain America's
competitive edge, President Bush told a crowd of
500 Ford Aerospace employees in Palo Alto yester
day that the nation can win trade wars abroad by
slashing the deficit and investing in technology at
home.
The president also advocated preserving family
values with a strong child care program.
In his 20-minute speech, Bush outlined his pro
posal to reduce the federal budget deficit in the
next fiscal year beginning Oct.l.
Calling the plan "an agreed outline," Bush
conceded that "tough talks still lie ahead." He com
pared deficit reduction to exercise, "like walking
the dog every day."
Bush used the speech as an opportunity to ad
vocate reducing the capital gains tax as a means of
cutting the deficit. He pleaded with the crowd in
the courtyard of Ford Aerospace to write their local
representatives in support of this tax plan, which
he hopes will cut the deficit by $4.8 billion.
The Bush tax plan, which seeks to reduce taxation
on profits from a sale, has been criticized as a "tax
break" for the rich. Bush denounced the criticism,
saying, "Lower capital gains taxes will create jobs
.. . and help build for a better America."
Giving the "high-five symbol to high-tech" — one
of many sports analogies peppering the president's
speech — Bush explained his new congressional
proposals for greater monetary support to technol
ogy.
Bush has asked Congress to increase NASA's
budget by $2.4 million. He has also proposed elevat
ing the status of the Presidential Science Adviser
Allan Bromley, a nuclear physicist at Yale Univer
sity, and has re-established the National Space
Council. He said he also wants to double the Na
tional Science Foundation budget by 1993.
Bush received occasional applause from the

President George Bush addressed a local audience yesterday when he visited Ford
Aerospace in Palo Alto.
technically-oriented crowd. Ford
Aerospace and Communications
Corp. produces tactical weapons,
space, intelligence and communi
cation systems and has recently
completed work on the Superbird,
a powerful communication satel
lite, together with the Japanese
firm Mitsubishi. Proud of this
project, Ford management invited
Bush to Palo Alto, and the pres
ident accepted, seeing the oppor
tunity to speak about American
competitiveness.
On the podium with the presi
dent were Tom Campbell, the
freshman Republican congress
man and Stanford law professor;
U.S. Sen. Pete Wilson; and the
chairman and two vice-presidents
of Ford Aerospace.
Campbell, who flew with Bush
from Chicago to San Jose on Mon
day, said in an interview with The
San Jose Mercury News that
Bush recognized the American
electronics industry is ailing,
which also may have spurred him

to visit Silicon Valley.
"He's very aware of the impor
tance of not losing our technical
advantage," Campbell told the
newspaper.
Continuing the theme of invest
ing in a more competitive and
future-oriented America, Bush
closed his address by lauding Ford
for responding to the "changing
demographics and the needs of its
employees."
Bush cited Ford's "Employee
Assistance Program" as an exam
ple of ways to keep "parental op
tions open" in terms of child care.
The president stressed the im
portance of child care, saying that
current congressional child care
initiatives have the wrong empha
sis. Bush proposed federal tax
credits to make child care more
affordable for low-income
families.
Ford employees entered a lot
tery to determine who could at
tend the presidential visit; only
500 of the total 2,000 Palo Alto
employees could observe, but
others watched the event over the
Ford Communications Network.
"It's not too often we get to see
the president in person," said

C.W. Stone, a configurations
management worker on the Su
perbird project. "He was very
good," she said, noting it was the
first time in her life she had ever
seen a president.
Elizabeth Bohan-Leach, an
other Ford employee, said, "It was
nice to see someone thinking
about childcare."
Another employee, Bill Monroe,
said the morale at Ford was al
ready high, but that the presiden
tial tour of the $200 million Su
perbird facilities will probably
raise spirits to even greater
heights.
An hour before the president's
speech, a small crowd of pro-choice
protesters marched outside the
Ford buildings. After the speech,
different protesters held signs say
ing, "Earth first — Not Profits"
and "Aid Cleanup, Not Contras."
The protesters were silent and did
not affect the speech.
The speech was one of a string
of nationwide appearances which
have taken the president from
Norfolk, Va., and Chicago on
Monday to Palo Alto yesterday
and then on to Los Angeles and
then Miami on Thursday.
