# UCMI is a hot idea

### Ann Marsh Editorial staff 
While it may be years before
the influence of Stanford's recent
report on minority issues can be
gauged, the University has at
least succeeded in arousing the
curiosity of educators and the
media nationwide.
Between 30 and 35 requests for
the report by the University Com
mittee on Minority Issues are
coming daily into the Office of
the President. The University
News Service has also sent copies
of the report to 25 universities,
and nearly 300 members of the
media.
"There is significant interest
out there," said Bob Beyers, di
rector of the news service, which
published 10 separate stories
about the UCMI report on April
5, the day it was released.
Requests for the report have
stemmed largely from such heavy
University publicity and from an
in-depth story published April 12
in the influential Chronicle of
Higher Education, a weekly news
paper published in Washington,
DC
Among newspapers, the
Los Angeles Times covered the
report extensively and mentioned
it in a recent editorial decrying
the state of minority life in col
leges nationwide.
But few who have received
copies of the 240-page report have
had time to read it, or digest it.
While some educators said they
are interested in the report for
personal reasons, others said it
could guide them in looking at
racial issues on their campuses.
Still others plan to compare it to
their own studies of racial issues.
"We are currently looking at
doing a study of the racial and
ethnic atmosphere" at the Uni
versity of Virginia, said Ronald
Stump, associate dean of students.
"The Stanford report will be
something that is helpful to us in
terms of giving us direction and
ideas."
At the State University of New
York, three studies of minority
issues have been done over the
years, according to Robert
Marcus, a vice president for aca
demic affairs. But a recent inci
dent of racial tension has dis
turbed many members of the
black community, prompting
Marcus to send for Stanford's
report.
"That (incident) has stirred a
great deal of discussion, anger,
hurt and has galvanized me to
look for how to go beyond what
we have already done here,"
Marcus said. "The first thing to
do is find out what other people
have said and done."
Seeking 40 copies of the report,
UC-Berkeley has weighed in with
the largest request so far by a
single institution. Cornell Univer
sity requested 20 copies of the
report.
Berkeley's "Commission on Re
sponses to a Changing Student
Body" may be even more ambi
tious than Stanford's UCMI,
which examined the overall
quality of minority life here.

"We're really being asked to
think big," said Christina Mas
lach, chair of the commission and
a professor of psychology at
Berkeley.
Maslach said the commission
wants to answer these questions:
"Where do we want the university
to go? What kinds of things im
pede (minority) students' success?
What kind of a university do we
want to have?" The commission
is only beginning its work and is
eager to see if Stanford's report
will be helpful, she said.
Maslach added that Berkeley's
study is coming at a particularly
appropriate time because 1988
was the first year statistics
showed that no single racial group
makes up a mtyority of the stu
dent body there.
University administrators from
Princeton and Harvard who re
quested copies of the report said
there are no plans to undertake
campus-wide studies of race rela
tions at either institution, but
added that Stanford's report is
attracting attention.
"I don't detect any wider inter
est to [undertake such a study]
here," said David Redmon, an as
sociate dean for academic affairs
at Princeton, who requested a
copy of the report. Redmon added
that he is keeping up on how "peer
institutions" are dealing with ra
cial issues.
"Whether studies of a problem
can lead to a solution, I don't
know," said Harvard History
Prof. Stephan Thernstrom, who
described the racial climate at
Harvard as "polarized" and often
"depressing." Thernstrom said he
ordered a copy of the report for

'The Stanford
report will be
something that is
helpful to us in
terms of giving us
direction and
ideas.'

his own interest.
Patricia Kaurouma, director of
the Office of Minority Education
at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, said she ordered a
copy of the UCMI report because
it is comprehensive in looking at
all of Stanford's minorities, not a
single group.
"I'm interested in (racial
studies) by peer institutions be
cause reports of this nature are
rather courageous. They mean in
stitutions are willing to look a
controversial issues â€” at warts,
shall we say?"
Kaurouma added that MIT
completed a "Racial Climate
Report" in September 1986 and
plans a follow-up by the end of
this year.
Stanford's Beyers predicted
that interest in the UCMI report
will only grow. "I think Stanford
does have a lot to offer when a
report comes out like this that is
carefully researched," he said.
The UCMI report contains "one
set of issues that cuts across a
whole institution," Beyers added.
"While the particulars differ (be
tween universities), the problems
are the same."
