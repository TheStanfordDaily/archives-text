# UCMI is a hot idea

While it may be years before
the influence of Stanford's recent
report on minority issues can be
gauged, the University has at
least succeeded in arousing the
curiosity of educators and the
media nationwide.
Between 30 and 35 requests for
the report by the University Com
mittee on Minority Issues are
coming daily into the Office of
the President. The University
News Service has also sent copies
of the report to 25 universities,
and nearly 300 members of the
media.
"There is significant interest
out there," said Bob Beyers, di
rector of the news service, which
published 10 separate stories
about the UCMI report on April
5, the day it was released.
Requests for the report have
stemmed largely from such heavy
University publicity and from an
in-depth story published April 12
in the influential Chronicle of
Higher Education, a weekly news
paper published in Washington,
DC
Among newspapers, the
Los Angeles Times covered the
report extensively and mentioned
it in a recent editorial decrying
the state of minority life in col
leges nationwide.
But few who have received
copies of the 240-page report have
had time to read it, or digest it.
While some educators said they
are interested in the report for
personal reasons, others said it
could guide them in looking at
racial issues on their campuses.
Still others plan to compare it to
their own studies of racial issues.
"We are currently looking at
doing a study of the racial and
ethnic atmosphere" at the Uni
versity of Virginia, said Ronald
Stump, associate dean of students.
