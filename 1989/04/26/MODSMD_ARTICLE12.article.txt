# Exxon braces for lawsuits
## 
### 
NEW YORK (AP) - Exxon
Corp. said yesterday it has been
hit with 31 lawsuits and 1,300
claims ranging from $500 to $4
million in connection with last
month's Alaskan oil spill and ex
pects more suits as well as gov
ernment fines.
At a meeting of securities
analysts, top executives of the na
tion's biggest oil company said Ex
xon already had paid $400,000 to
settle smaller claims brought
mainly by fishermen and cannery

workers whose jobs were dis
rupted because of the March 24
spill that fouled hundreds of miles
of coastline.
Exxon executives declined to
put a dollar value on the existing
lawsuits or the claims.
Exxon Chairman Lawrence
Rawl, who has been criticized for
staying out of sight in the crucial
days following the disaster, said
that in retrospect he would have
responded differently. However,
he said he did not understand the

public anger against the company,
especially because it had accepted
the blame and apologized for the
spill and was cleaning it up.
"I'm angry with myself," Rawl
said. "It's not really clear to me
as to why everyone is so angry
â€” once we get past the point of
admitting it was our ship that
went on the rocks."
Exxon President Lee Raymond
said all but two of the lawsuits
were class actions against the
company.
