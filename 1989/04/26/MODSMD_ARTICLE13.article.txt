MEXICO CITY (AP) - A
strong earthquake struck Mexico
City and Acapulco yesterday,
cracking buildings and an
aqueduct, shattering glass and
panicking thousands of people
who remembered the killer quake
of 1985.
One man was electrocuted when
power cables fell on him, and two
women were seriously injured
when they jumped in panic from
the second story of a swaying
building during the 8:26 a.m.
[10:26 a.m. EDTI quake, officials
said.
Police sent on inspection patrols
throughout the city reported no
collapsed buildings or other
deaths or serious injuries, but
many buildings in the seismically
sensitive center swayed widely and
were evacuated.

"The quake produced a lot of
panic because of the recent [1985]
experience," said Mayor Manuel
Camacho Solis.
He said fallen cables and short
circuits caused power blackouts
in many parts of the city. He also
said the Tlahuac aqueduct, one
of several bringing drinking water
to this metropolis of 19 million,
cracked in several places and
caused some flooding.
However, he said all services
would be restored within three
days.
President Carlos Salinas de
Gortari made a quick tour of af
fected areas and, in a television
interview, praised residents for
maintaining "serenity and cool
ness." He said their experience in
the 1985 disaster had served them
well.

Yesterday's tremor shook the
Pacific beach resorts of Acapulco
and Zihuatanejo, but there were
no reports of death or damage
throughout the state of Guerrero,
according to state government
spokesman Miguel Angel Hernan
dez.
"Even though the quake was
intensively felt, everything is nor
mal and there are also reports of
no damage. We did a survey
by radio," said Hernandez by tele
phone.
The U.S. National Earthquake
Information Center in Golden,
Colo., said the earthquake regis
tered 6.8 on the Richter scale.
The epicenter was 40 miles east
of Acapulco, about 200 miles
south of Mexico City, said seis
