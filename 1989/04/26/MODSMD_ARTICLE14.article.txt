# Takeshita aide kills self
## Assistant implicated in Recruit Co. bribery scandal 
### 
TOKYO (AP) â€” An aide to Noboru Takeshita
killed himself today after the prime minister an
nounced he would resign partly because of financial
dealings handled by the aide, police said.
Japan Broadcasting Corp. said Ihei Aoki commit
ted suicide by slashing his wrists with a razor and
hanging himself at his home in Tokyo this morning.
The network quoted police and fire officials as say
ing an ambulance crew, responding to an emergency
call, found him dead.
Officials at the Tokyo Metropolitan Police head
quarters confirmed that Aoki, 58, had slashed his
wrists.
Aoki had handled political donations, stock pur
chases and loans from the Recruit Co., which is at
the hub of the bribery scandal that toppled Takes
hita. There was no immediate comment on the
suicide from Takeshita, whom Aoki had served as
aide for three decades.
Two days before Takeshita announced his resig
nation, news reports surfaced that Aoki had accepted
a loan from the Recruit Co. of $384,000 in 1987
for use in Takeshita's campaign to succeed Yasuhiro
Nakasone as prime minister. The money was later

paid back.
The revelation embarrassed Takeshita because he
had not included it in a report to Parliament on
April 11, when he acknowledged receiving more
than $1 million in legal political donations from
Recruit, an information conglomerate.
Takeshita did not blame Aoki in his resignation
statement, but news reports Monday said he had
not known of the loan when he spoKe to Parliament.
The reports said the aide had not informed him of
it until Saturday.
Recruit is accused of seeking influence and favors
by selling shares in a subsidiary at bargain prices
to politicians, bureaucrats, business leaders and
media executives. 9
Takeshita, through Aoki and a relative, received
some of those shares, which skyrocketed in value
after they went on public sale in late 1986. Aoki
bought 2,000 shares, which yielded a profit of about
$30,000.
The scandal has forced the resignations of three
Cabinet ministers in addition to Takeshita and led
to the arrests of 14 businessmen and bureaucrats.
