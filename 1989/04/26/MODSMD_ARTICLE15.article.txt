ARCADIA, Fla. (AP) — A judge yes
terday overturned the murder conviction
of a former migrant farm worker in the
poisoning deaths of his seven children,
freeing the 53-year-old man after 21 years
in prison.
Retired Circuit Judge Clifton Kelly re
leased James Richardson, 53, to the cus
tody of defense attorney Ellis Rubin of
Miami.
The decision came after an extraordi
nary appeal in which both Rubin and
special prosecutor Janet Reno agreed that
Richardson, a black man who was con

victed by an all-white jury, had been rail
roaded.
"Within my heart, I knew that these
great men were going to get me out —
they weren't going to let me stay in
there," the gray-haired Richardson,
flanked by his attorneys, told The Asso
ciated Press. "Right now, I feel fine."
Richardson was convicted in 1968 of
murdering his oldest child, an 8-year-old
daughter, and sentenced to death. His
sentence was later commuted to life im
prisonment.
"This court is now convinced that the

defendant did not receive a fair trial,"
Kelly told a packed courtroom in the
DeSoto County Courthouse.
"There is a definite possibility of a
different outcome in the trial" if material
that the defense should have had access
to had been provided by the prosecution,
he said.
The judge denied defense attorney
Mark Lane's motion to dismiss the
charge, saying the state would decide
later whether to retry the case.
Reno, however, said the charges would
be dropped within about 10 days.

Richardson's attorneys said they were
thrilled.
"We have shown the world there is
justice in Florida," said Rubin.
Richardson's wife, Annie Mae, cried
when she heard the judge's decision. She
raised her arms to the heavens and said,
"Thank you, thank you."
Gov. Bob Martinez, who had appointed
Reno to review the case, said the evidence
justified Richardson's release.
"Mr. Richardson has lost too many
years of his life in prison, but my hope
is that this decision will give him an

opportunity to rebuild," Martinez said in
Tallahassee, the capital.
Kelly spent the day listening to argu
ments from three sides: Richardson's de
fense attorneys, the former prosecutor
who brought the case in 1968, and the
special prosecutor. He deliberated about
30 minutes before making his ruling.
Lane had argued that the state attor
ney and the DeSoto County sheriff at
the time of the trial railroaded Richard
son by manufacturing and encouraging
perjured testimony and by withholding
essential evidence from the defense.
