# Cheney doubtful on Gorbachev
## Defense Secretary predicts failure of Soviet reforms 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - De
fense Secretary Dick Cheney yes
terday predicted "a very real
likelihood" that Mikhail Gorba
chev's reform plans would fail and
the Soviet leader may either be
forced to change course or hand
over power.
Cheney told Congress that as a
result, the United States and its
NATO allies must resist the temp
tation to respond to Gorbachev's
proposals for reducing arsenals
and troop strengths and stick to
the policies it has advocated until
now.
Cheney, testifying before the
House Armed Services Commit
tee, said he had watched Gorba
chev and had "become convinced
that he seeks change inside the
Soviet Union, but primarily be
cause the Soviet system has been
a failure."
However, "I think it's going to
be extremely difficult for him to
succeed, and I think there is a
very real likelihood that he'll
either have to reverse course, or

that for one reason or another,
ultimately have to resort to force,
perhaps in Eastern Europe, per
haps in terms of dealing with the
ethnic unrest inside the Soviet
Union.
"And, of course, there's always
the possibility that his successor
may arrive fairly soon and may
pursue radically different policies
than he has," he said.
In apparent reference to pres
sure from West Germany for talks
with the Kremlin on reducing
short-range nuclear weapons,
Cheney said, "I think we're in a
posture now where people are res
ponding to what they perceive to
be the intentions of the Soviet
leadership rather than what are
the capabilities of the Soviet mil
itary
"And we don't have the luxury
of assuming that the intentions
expressed by Mr. Gorbachev nec
essarily are going to permanently
become a part of the policies of
the Soviet Union," he cautioned.
NATO must "continue to resist

the temptation to react to Mr.
Gorbachev's 'proposal of the
month' by trying to dismantle, if
you will, some of our own military
capabilities or alliance strength."
Cheney's comments came as the
State Department accused the So
viet Union of trying to undermine
NATO's nuclear defense and in
structed U.S. ambassadors in
Western capitals to counter the
West German drive for negotia
tions.
The U.S. offensive is designed
to rally the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization against any reduc
tion in nuclear battlefield weap
ons before President George Bush
meets with the 15 allied leaders
in Brussels at the end of May.
West German Chancellor Hel
mut Kohl, trying to counter
growing support for disarmament
in his country, sent Defense Min
ister Gerhard Stoltenberg and
Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich
Genscher to Washington for talks
to try to persuade the Bush ad
