Downey claims skinhead attack
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - Shock TV host Mor
ton Downey said yesterday he was attacked by
"skinheads" who cut his hair and marked him
with swatiskas, but police said they couldn't
verify his report.
"What he's claiming doesn't appear to be the
case at all," said Ron Wilson, a spokesman at
San Francisco International Airport where the
incident was reported at 11:30 p.m. Monday. "We
have not yet been able to confirm any of the
statements Mr. Downey made."
Authorities found no evidence of skinheads in
the area, he said.
Wilson said a witness reported seeing the talk
show host in a restroom where the attack was
said to have happened, but didn't see any con
frontation. The witness said Downey was escorted
to a waiting limousine by a man and woman
with whom he was traveling.
Downey was cleanly dressed when found in

the limousine at the airport and showed no signs
of being in a scuffle, said Wilson. Scissors and
a marking pen were found in the restroom, but
there were no physical signs of a fight, he said.
Brazilian bank workers strike
SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) â€” Thousands of
workers at the country's Central Bank went on
strike yesterday and a bank spokesman said
foreign debt payments and other financial trans
actions were jeopardized.
The Central Bank strike broke out as other
government bank employees and workers at
private banks entered the sixth day of a separate
strike.
Murilo Murca de Carvalho, a Central Bank
spokesman, said by telephone from Brasilia that
"a significant number" of the bank's 7,000
workers around the country stopped work.
Carvalho said the strike was "already causing
difficulties."
