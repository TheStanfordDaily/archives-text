# Ready to be razed?
## The 						boathouse is closed for the quarter 
### DJ Berinstein Senior staff writer 
The Lake Lagunita Boathouse
may not hold up past its silver
anniversary.
The Boathouse was closed Fri
day after a report commissioned
by Student Organization Services
deemed it unsafe and possibly in
danger of collapse.
The Boathouse facilities mana
ger, Paul Thurman, who lives
there, was evacuated and moved
to presumably sturdier housing in
Escondido Village.
The current Boathouse is the
third to grace Lagunita's shores.
In 1938, the second Boathouse col
lapsed during a party, dropping
25 students into the lake and in
juring six others.
The Lake Commission, a panel
of University officials and stu
dents, hasn't decided whether it
will raze the structure or renovate
it at an estimated cost of
$500,000. No decision date has
been set for the commission.
Michael Ramsey-Perez, director
of Student Organization Services
and a commission member,
blamed faulty design and old sup
ports for the building's demise.
"The current problems were not
foreseen," said Ramsey-Perez,
"but in those days, buildings were
designed, not engineered." He ex
plained that the seasonal changes
and varying water levels of the
lake affected the wood pilings,
causing the building to shift.
Thurman said a safety survey
had been done the previous year,
so he was not surprised at his
evacuation. "Safety has been a
concern for the past three to four

years, and since that first survey,
I thought they'd kick in new
funds.
"I guess the Boathouse is a
lower priority to the University
than Roble or other student res
idences," he said. "We forget what
a luxury it is — How many cam
puses have a lake and a boat
house?"
Thurman admitted that he was
worried about his own safety
while living in the building. He
said he attempted to do some
minor repair work to the sub
structure, but that there wasn't
enough funding for him to do any
mgyor repairs, let alone unassist
ed.
Ramsey-Perez, Thurman and
Michael Jackson, associate dean
of Student Affairs and chair of
the Lake Commission, all agreed
that the University will not just
let the building rot.
"We must work now to ensure
that there will always be a
resource like this to serve the
Stanford community," said Jack
son.
"We will have something there,"
Ramsey-Perez said. The Univer
sity intends to maintain teaching
its sailing, windsurfing and
kayaking classes on the lake in
the future.
Rainfall did not fill the lake
this year, and due to the drought,
University officials decided not to
pump water into the lakebed for
recreational athletic classes.
Windsurfing classes have been
relocated to Felt Lake, and sailing
classes have been moved to the
varsity sailing team's facilities at
Redwood City.
Ramsey-Perez said a subcom
mittee will be formed soon to dis
cuss possibilities for either re
structuring the existing building
or building from scratch.
The subcommittee will also
decide whether the building will
be enclosed, include a restaurant,
a dance floor or any other addi
tions, according to Ramsey-Perez.
Sources of funding for the Boat
house, along with other Univer
sity structures, are in question.
Perez suggested fundraising
might provide one answer.
Two students live at the Boat
house: one facility manager and
one safety director. Greg Bevis,
this year's safety director, moved
out at the end of winter quarter
after graduating.
The two students are not paid
for their activities but receive free
housing. "Most people don't know
anyone lives here," said Thurman.
As a part of his job, he serves as
a kind of safety monitor, often

The managers are also in charge
of scheduling events at the Boat
house. Spring is usually the
busiest party season, according to
Thurman, but barbeques will con
tinue to be held on the land be
hind the building, he said.
Thurman noted the last survey
was professional and thorough. It
looked at the building from five
different engineering standpoints,
but "the timing was off," he said.
He added that the University
"has taken care of me in a quick
and efficient way [upon
evacuation]. They've been really
nice."

but "the timing was off," he said.
He added that the University

The Lake Lagunita Boathouse
may not hold up past its silver
anniversary.
The Boathouse was closed Fri
day after a report commissioned
by Student Organization Services
deemed it unsafe and possibly in
danger of collapse.
The Boathouse facilities mana
ger, Paul Thurman, who lives
there, was evacuated and moved
to presumably sturdier housing in
Escondido Village.
The current Boathouse is the
third to grace Lagunita's shores.
In 1938, the second Boathouse col
lapsed during a party, dropping
25 students into the lake and in
juring six others.
The Lake Commission, a panel
of University officials and stu
dents, hasn't decided whether it
will raze the structure or renovate
it at an estimated cost of
$500,000. No decision date has
been set for the commission.
Michael Ramsey-Perez, director
of Student Organization Services
and a commission member,
blamed faulty design and old sup
ports for the building's demise.
"The current problems were not
foreseen," said Ramsey-Perez,
"but in those days, buildings were
designed, not engineered." He ex
plained that the seasonal changes
and varying water levels of the
lake affected the wood pilings,
causing the building to shift.
Thurman said a safety survey
had been done the previous year,
so he was not surprised at his
evacuation. "Safety has been a
concern for the past three to four

years, and since that first survey,
I thought they'd kick in new
funds.
"I guess the Boathouse is a
lower priority to the University
than Roble or other student res
idences," he said. "We forget what
a luxury it is — How many cam
puses have a lake and a boat
house?"
Thurman admitted that he was
worried about his own safety
while living in the building. He
said he attempted to do some
minor repair work to the sub
structure, but that there wasn't
enough funding for him to do any
mgyor repairs, let alone unassist
ed.
Ramsey-Perez, Thurman and
Michael Jackson, associate dean
of Student Affairs and chair of
the Lake Commission, all agreed
that the University will not just
let the building rot.
"We must work now to ensure
that there will always be a
resource like this to serve the
Stanford community," said Jack
son.
"We will have something there,"
Ramsey-Perez said. The Univer
sity intends to maintain teaching
its sailing, windsurfing and
kayaking classes on the lake in
the future.
Rainfall did not fill the lake
this year, and due to the drought,
University officials decided not to
pump water into the lakebed for
recreational athletic classes.
Windsurfing classes have been
relocated to Felt Lake, and sailing
classes have been moved to the
varsity sailing team's facilities at
Redwood City.
Ramsey-Perez said a subcom
mittee will be formed soon to dis
cuss possibilities for either re
structuring the existing building
or building from scratch.
The subcommittee will also
decide whether the building will
be enclosed, include a restaurant,
a dance floor or any other addi
tions, according to Ramsey-Perez.
Sources of funding for the Boat
house, along with other Univer
sity structures, are in question.
Perez suggested fundraising
might provide one answer.
Two students live at the Boat
house: one facility manager and
one safety director. Greg Bevis,
this year's safety director, moved
out at the end of winter quarter
after graduating.
The two students are not paid
for their activities but receive free
housing. "Most people don't know
anyone lives here," said Thurman.
As a part of his job, he serves as
a kind of safety monitor, often

The managers are also in charge
of scheduling events at the Boat
house. Spring is usually the
busiest party season, according to
Thurman, but barbeques will con

Thurman noted the last survey
was professional and thorough. It
looked at the building from five
different engineering standpoints,
but "the timing was off," he said.
He added that the University
"has taken care of me in a quick
and efficient way [upon
