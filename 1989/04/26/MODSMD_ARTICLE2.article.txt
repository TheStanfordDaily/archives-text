# Ready to be razed?
## The

The Lake Lagunita Boathouse
may not hold up past its silver
anniversary.
The Boathouse was closed Fri
day after a report commissioned
by Student Organization Services
deemed it unsafe and possibly in
danger of collapse.
The Boathouse facilities mana
ger, Paul Thurman, who lives
there, was evacuated and moved
to presumably sturdier housing in
Escondido Village.
The current Boathouse is the
third to grace Lagunita's shores.
In 1938, the second Boathouse col
lapsed during a party, dropping
25 students into the lake and in
juring six others.
The Lake Commission, a panel
of University officials and stu
dents, hasn't decided whether it
will raze the structure or renovate
it at an estimated cost of
$500,000. No decision date has
been set for the commission.
Michael Ramsey-Perez, director
of Student Organization Services
and a commission member,
blamed faulty design and old sup
ports for the building's demise.
"The current problems were not
foreseen," said Ramsey-Perez,
"but in those days, buildings were
designed, not engineered." He ex
plained that the seasonal changes
and varying water levels of the
lake affected the wood pilings,
causing the building to shift.
Thurman said a safety survey
had been done the previous year,
so he was not surprised at his
evacuation. "Safety has been a
concern for the past three to four

years, and since that first survey,
I thought they'd kick in new
funds.
"I guess the Boathouse is a
lower priority to the University
than Roble or other student res
idences," he said. "We forget what
a luxury it is â€” How many cam
puses have a lake and a boat
house?"
Thurman admitted that he was
worried about his own safety
while living in the building. He
said he attempted to do some
minor repair work to the sub
structure, but that there wasn't
enough funding for him to do any
mgyor repairs, let alone unassist
ed.
Ramsey-Perez, Thurman and
Michael Jackson, associate dean
of Student Affairs and chair of
the Lake Commission, all agreed
that the University will not just
let the building rot.
"We must work now to ensure
that there will always be a
resource like this to serve the
Stanford community," said Jack
son.
"We will have something there,"
Ramsey-Perez said. The Univer
sity intends to maintain teaching
its sailing, windsurfing and
kayaking classes on the lake in
the future.
Rainfall did not fill the lake
this year, and due to the drought,
University officials decided not to
pump water into the lakebed for
recreational athletic classes.
Windsurfing classes have been
relocated to Felt Lake, and sailing
classes have been moved to the
varsity sailing team's facilities at
