Put 'Gay Liberation'
back where it belongs
(hint: not the basement)

TWO CLASSES OF entering
students have never laid
eyes on the innocuous
George Segal sculpture "Gay Lib
eration" that used to stand in
Lomita Mall.
Since August 1987 — a year
and eight months ago — it has
been lying with the word "AIDS"
spray-painted on it in the base
ment of the Stanford Art Muse
um, due to bureaucratic or ho
mophobic neglect.
One class of entering students
has never seen the small sign
that used to hang on the front
of the Old Firehouse that said
"Gay and Lesbian Alliance." It
was taken down more than six
months ago for the long-overdue
repainting of the building and has
not been replaced, due to more
"bureaucratic" delays.
Surely the University, with all
its statements in support of "di
versity," is not intentionally
trying to render its gay/les
bian/bisexual community invis
ible. But that's the way it looks
to many members of the Stanford
community.
Almost a year ago, The Daily
obtained photographs that con
tradicted statements by Art De
partment officials saying the
sculpture had been repaired. In
the wake of that dismaying dis
closure, students rallied for the
return of the statue, and The
Daily ran an editorial that read
in part:
"The University should public
ly account for the statue's prog
ress from last August [1987] until

now and release a timetable for
when it will be repaired and
reinstated. It should establish a
permanent mechanism for better
communication for the gay and
lesbian community."
Guess how many of those ac
tions the University has taken in
the past year? That's right, zip.
The sign on the Old Firehouse
is another interesting case. Stu
dent Organization Services offi
cials have raised architectural
questions about how a sign would
fit in with the renovated "Fire
Truck House."
Is it possible that they are more
concerned about reactions of Uni
versity visitors to an open ac
knowledgment that there are gay
and lesbian students on campus,
since the official University tour
route passes in front of the Old
Firehouse?
Of the many prospective stu
dents who visit campus each year,
approximately 10 percent are gay,
and would be reassured by visible
signs that they are welcome on
campus. And if bigotry is really
"out" at this University, we
wouldn't want students here who
would be offended enough by
such a sign not to come.
Now that the Firehouse reno
vation and the Lomita Mall con
struction are finally finished,
there is no reason for delay in
replacing the sign or the sculp
ture — if it has been repaired.
But no one knows whether re
pairs on the sculpture have even
begun.
Members of the gay community
have politely asked whether there
is any reaon the sculpture cannot
be brought out of the closet —
that is, basement — by May 7,
the first day of this year's Gay
and Lesbian Awareness Week.
Surely that's not too much to ask.
