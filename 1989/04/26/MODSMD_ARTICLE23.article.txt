## 'Techie' discrimination 
### 
THIS SCHOOL is considered one of
the most prestigious places where
you can spend several years of your
life in dedication to learning. And I can
claim confidently that a lot of Stanford's
prestige and renown is a result of the
scientific research that goes on in places
most of us will never see.
You would think, therefore, that our
science program would be something to
be proud of. Yet there is a subtle prejudice
among Stanford students against the
sciences.
I'm not talking about a discrimination
of the offensive and malicious type, like
racism, sexism or homophobia that stirs
up campus-wide discussion and major re
evaluations of campus policy. Rather, I
am frustrated by a passive, more subtle,
yet similarly intolerable "discrimination"
against the sciences that no administra
tion can do anything about.
For example, I was sitting outside the
other day reading a marvelous book on
gene regulation by Harvard molecular
biologist Mark Ptashne called "A Genetic
Switch." A friend who passed by looked
down at my reading and commented
lightly about how I was always doing
work.
When I told him no, that's not true at
all, that this is pleasure reading, what I
received was a most alienating glance of
frustration that implied that I had a
serious problem. And all I could do to
justify myself was to explain to him how
this was pleasurable, to explain to him
my enthusiasm and my care for the
sciences, which he did not seem to care
about anyway.
The funny thing is that if I had been

sitting out there reading something like
Hawthorne's "The Scarlet Letter" or
Faulkner's "Absalom, Absalom!",
whether for pleasure or for a class, I
would have received a look of approval,
and perhaps an interested question or
two about the book itself.
Yet "A Genetic Switch" is as internally
complex as the two novels are, and beauti
fully written as well, describing a
decision-making process of the gene that
involves many factors. I should have re
ceived that look of approval and maybe
an interested question about the book,
but I didn't because it was science, being
"discriminated" against, once again.
A more general example is dinner con
versation. There seems to be an unwrit
ten law against any mention of a scientific
subject during dinner. Even I feel guilty
about breaking this law, with all the faces
of disapproval glaring at me when I try.
Yesterday at dinner my friend Traci
began to explain to me what she was
studying in her lab. The law was broken
and the looks were there, glaring con
temptuously. As Traci was speaking,
someone else at the table made his hand
into a gun, said, "Speak English!", and
shot her down. As if she had broken some
kind of law.
Even on a more subtle level I can sense
the discrimination against science. Last
week, I found out that I would be working
at the Jackson Laboratory in Bar Harbor,
Maine this summer. It's really made my
day, every day, just thinking about it.
And naturally I should want to talk about
something that is personally satisfying.

Yet, when I do talk to people about it,
I notice that they are interested only at
the mention of the free room and board,
the $2,000 grant and the location (the
lab is on an island off the coast of Maine).
These benefits are not the core of the
job, not the reason I'm going, and yet
few people seem to be interested in what
the job entails, and I conjecture that it
is because it has to do with science.
Appreciating scientific knowledge is un
derstandably difficult. I sometimes feel
bogged down by technical details â€” until
I realize that it is this precision, this
detail, this complexity that allows us to
understand what underlies the world, to
see what things mean, as opposed to just
what they are.
There are similarities between the hu
manities and the sciences. For example,
writers work following the saying "show,
don't tell." Scientists follow this concept,
too, designing experiments that explain
phenomena by showing. Also, artistic
detail is analogous to scientific detail in
that understanding is enriched by detail.
I don't know why one should be feared
and avoided so much.
