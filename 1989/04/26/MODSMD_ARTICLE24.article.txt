'Blue-collar' work
deserves respect
In reference to Robyn Bezar's April
24 column on learning English, I can
understand why no one took her up on
her offer to teach English. Bezar's
misconceptions and attitude are so
biased that I find it difficult to dignify
her article with this letter.
But I was deeply pained by her com
ment, "It is difficult to understand the
mentality that would keep a person in
the role of janitor or groundskeeper
rather than learn the language pri
mary to their adopted country ..."
Bezar was talking not only about hun
dreds of thousands from the working
class, most of whom are minority, but
also about my beloved father, who
passed away three years ago.
For 40 years my father worked as a
janitor for a Jewish Orthodox
synagogue. He was proud of the work
he did and his knowledge and love of
the Jewish religion. He and my mother
raised six children and sent us to
private Catholic grade and high schools.
Can you imagine the supreme
sacrifices they made? Do you think my
father had time for night classes? He
spoke sufficient English in a town and
place that didn't necessitate it. My
father never had time to further his
own education beyond third grade. All
he had time for was his family and his
work.
Love and selfless dedication was his
mentality. Do you think they need
English in those positions? Or in the
barrio?
There ia a dignity in the work of a
janitor that will never be found in
some of the highest positions on this
campus. Bezar's words hurt, and she
insulted the people that keep this uni
versity looking so beautiful. The lack
of respect and consideration toward
janitors amd groundskeepers in this
elitist university is appalling.

Next time you "trash" the hallway,
eat from clean plates or see the beauti
fully kept lawns, think of them. Their
work is essential and honest. Think
before you write.

Bible does speak
about the unborn
It was surprising to see Lyzette Set
tle attempt to use the Bible to support
pro-choice views in her April 18
column.
However, in our opinion Settle has
completely misrepresented the Biblical
verses she quoted and therefore her
statements require a response.
First of all, Settle was incorrect in
stating that the Bible does not mention
the unborn. There are definite refer
ences to the unborn in both the Old
and New Testaments. Many of those
references speak directly to the value
of the unborn child.
The fact that the Bible did not di
rectly speak about abortion is most
likely because abortion was generally
considered to be prohibited by the
commandment "Thou shall not mur
der."
It also surprises us that anyone
could interpret Matthew 18:10 ("Take
heed that you do not despise one of
these little ones ...") to mean that
killing a child is better than allowing
him or her to live and possibly face
difficult times. Settle seems to believe
that it is ethically correct to kill a
child in order to save him or her from
presumed poverty (as if wealth has
anything to do with living a fulfilled
life) or child abuse (as if no abused
child could ever become a productive
member of society).
Would Settle extend her argument to
kill victims of child abuse and poverty
on their first birthday? It is not the
child who is to blame in cases of child
abuse, and it is not the child who

should be punished.
Any attempt to use abortion to alle
viate poverty amounts to little more
than genocide of the poor. Settle's sta
tistics on poverty and child abuse
should not lead us to the destruction
of our children, they should lead us to
battling the causes of poverty and child
abuse.

Network denies any
hidden pro-life bent
I am writing to correct some of the
inaccuracies of the April 21 article on
the Stanford Crisis Pregnancy Net
work.
First, Res Ed does distribute our
brochure to resident assistants, along
with a letter from us that states we do
not give abortion referrals but do give
other referrals.
Secondly, the article gives the im
pression that we try to take advantage
of a woman's vulnerability as she waits
for the results of her pregnancy test.
This is completely false. I did tell the
writer that our counselor would talk to
the woman while waiting for test
results, but this is purely of a support
ive nature.
I also told the writer that any coun
seling we provide is strictly optional
and non-directive in nature. If a preg
nancy test is positive, we ask our
clients to think about their options
(keeping the child, adoption and abor
tion) and how each would influence
their goals and values. Each woman
must find her own answer and make
her own choice.

Learning English
won't cure povertg
I had trouble understanding the
meaning and purpose behind Robyn
Bezar's April 24 column, and it was
not due to any lack of knowledge of
the English language on my part. She
makes the assumption that in the
United States people who speak only
Spanish are trapped in a "vicious
circle" which they will not be able to
escape unless they learn English. I
find this simplistic and naive.
I wonder if Bezar ever noticed that
the poor children in Tyuana who were
eagerly waiting to open her taxi's door
or were trying to sell her a serape as
she waited to cross the border back
into the United States spoke good Eng
lish?
Learning English is not the complete
solution to the "vicious circle" problem
she alluded to in her column. If it
were, the black community in this
country would not be faced with the
same problems (gangs, drugs, school
dropouts, teen pregnancies, etc.) that
Mexican-Americans suffer.
These problems are caused by
poverty. Because people are poor they
can only afford to live in crime-infested
neighborhoods. Because they are poor
they do not get a good education. How
can you expect any immigrant to learn
English when he or she has to work
two shifts a day in minimum-wage jobs
in order to survive?
As for the last paragraph of her
column, I found it to be condescending.
For Bezar's information, Mexican cul
ture was, is, and will continue to be
impressive. Also, people are not as
wound up" in the "vicious circle" as
she believes. Proof of this is found in
the front page article "Janitors rally
for better pay that ran on the same
day as her column.

Learning English
won't cure povertg
I had trouble understanding the
meaning and purpose behind Robyn
Bezar's April 24 column, and it was
not due to any lack of knowledge of
the English language on my part. She
makes the assumption that in the
United States people who speak only
Spanish are trapped in a "vicious
circle" which they will not be able to
escape unless they learn English. I
find this simplistic and naive.
I wonder if Bezar ever noticed that
the poor children in Tyuana who were
eagerly waiting to open her taxi's door
or were trying to sell her a serape as
she waited to cross the border back
into the United States spoke good Eng
lish?
Learning English is not the complete
solution to the "vicious circle" problem
she alluded to in her column. If it
were, the black community in this
country would not be faced with the
same problems (gangs, drugs, school
dropouts, teen pregnancies, etc.) that
Mexican-Americans suffer.
These problems are caused by
poverty. Because people are poor they
can only afford to live in crime-infested
neighborhoods. Because they are poor
they do not get a good education. How
can you expect any immigrant to learn
English when he or she has to work
two shifts a day in minimum-wage jobs
in order to survive?
As for the last paragraph of her
column, I found it to be condescending.
For Bezar's information, Mexican cul
ture was, is, and will continue to be
impressive. Also, people are not as
wound up" in the "vicious circle" as
she believes. Proof of this is found in
the front page article "Janitors rally
for better pay that ran on the same
day as her column.

'Blue-collar' work
deserves respect
In reference to Robyn Bezar's April
24 column on learning English, I can
understand why no one took her up on
her offer to teach English. Bezar's
misconceptions and attitude are so
biased that I find it difficult to dignify
her article with this letter.
But I was deeply pained by her com
ment, "It is difficult to understand the
mentality that would keep a person in
the role of janitor or groundskeeper
rather than learn the language pri
mary to their adopted country ..."
Bezar was talking not only about hun
dreds of thousands from the working
class, most of whom are minority, but
also about my beloved father, who
passed away three years ago.
For 40 years my father worked as a
janitor for a Jewish Orthodox
synagogue. He was proud of the work
he did and his knowledge and love of
the Jewish religion. He and my mother
raised six children and sent us to
private Catholic grade and high schools.
Can you imagine the supreme
sacrifices they made? Do you think my
father had time for night classes? He
spoke sufficient English in a town and
place that didn't necessitate it. My
father never had time to further his
own education beyond third grade. All
he had time for was his family and his
work.
Love and selfless dedication was his
mentality. Do you think they need
English in those positions? Or in the
barrio?
There ia a dignity in the work of a
janitor that will never be found in
some of the highest positions on this
campus. Bezar's words hurt, and she
insulted the people that keep this uni
versity looking so beautiful. The lack
of respect and consideration toward
janitors amd groundskeepers in this
elitist university is appalling.

Next time you "trash" the hallway,
eat from clean plates or see the beauti
fully kept lawns, think of them. Their
work is essential and honest. Think
before you write.

Bible does speak
about the unborn
It was surprising to see Lyzette Set
tle attempt to use the Bible to support
pro-choice views in her April 18
column.
However, in our opinion Settle has
completely misrepresented the Biblical
verses she quoted and therefore her
statements require a response.
First of all, Settle was incorrect in
stating that the Bible does not mention
the unborn. There are definite refer
ences to the unborn in both the Old
and New Testaments. Many of those
references speak directly to the value
of the unborn child.
The fact that the Bible did not di
rectly speak about abortion is most
likely because abortion was generally
considered to be prohibited by the
commandment "Thou shall not mur
der."
It also surprises us that anyone
could interpret Matthew 18:10 ("Take
heed that you do not despise one of
these little ones ...") to mean that
killing a child is better than allowing
him or her to live and possibly face
difficult times. Settle seems to believe
that it is ethically correct to kill a
child in order to save him or her from
presumed poverty (as if wealth has
anything to do with living a fulfilled
life) or child abuse (as if no abused
child could ever become a productive
member of society).
Would Settle extend her argument to
kill victims of child abuse and poverty
on their first birthday? It is not the
child who is to blame in cases of child
abuse, and it is not the child who

should be punished.
Any attempt to use abortion to alle
viate poverty amounts to little more
than genocide of the poor. Settle's sta
tistics on poverty and child abuse
should not lead us to the destruction
of our children, they should lead us to
battling the causes of poverty and child
abuse.

Network denies any

I am writing to correct some of the
inaccuracies of the April 21 article on
the Stanford Crisis Pregnancy Net
work.
First, Res Ed does distribute our
brochure to resident assistants, along
with a letter from us that states we do
not give abortion referrals but do give
other referrals.
Secondly, the article gives the im
pression that we try to take advantage
of a woman's vulnerability as she waits
for the results of her pregnancy test.
This is completely false. I did tell the
writer that our counselor would talk to
the woman while waiting for test
results, but this is purely of a support
ive nature.
I also told the writer that any coun
seling we provide is strictly optional
and non-directive in nature. If a preg
nancy test is positive, we ask our
clients to think about their options
(keeping the child, adoption and abor
tion) and how each would influence
their goals and values. Each woman
must find her own answer and make
her own choice.
