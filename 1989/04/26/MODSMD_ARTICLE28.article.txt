## Still reacting 
### 
One week after a Stanford
team announced they had
confirmed "cold fusion" ex
periments, the tests are still
running and cold fusion is
still a hot topic at Stanford.
Last Tuesday, Materials
Sciences Prof. Robert Hug
gins and his team an
nounced they had produced
more heat than they
pumped into a tiny jar filled
with "heavy water." With
the results of a control ex
periment they performed
using normal water, they
said they had, in all
likelihood, ruled out the pos
sibility that any chemical re
action was occurring.
Since then, the Huggins
team has kept getting
results. In one stretch, they
ran the experiment continu
ously for over 50 hours.
The Huggins team plans
to formally present their
findings to scientists tonight
at a meeting of the Materials
Research Society in San
Diego. The results will be
presented at a hastily-called
special session at 9 p.m., ac
cording to Turgut Gur, one
of the researchers.
Gur said they will an
nounce a theory about why
some groups have seen
results and others have had
no luck, but would not give
any more details about their
theory.
Cold fusion, so named
after it was discovered at
room temperature last
month by Utah researchers,
is leaving scientists per
plexed. Fusion, scientists
thought previously, could
only happen at temperatures
nearly as hot as the sun.
