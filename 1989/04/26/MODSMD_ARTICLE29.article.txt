# Stanford team lowers heart transplant risks
## 
### Jock Friedly Editorial staff 
Stanford researchers announced yester
day they may have developed a method for
performing heart transplants without the
side effect of necessary life-long drug treat
ment to battle against rejection of the new
heart.
Although the method has only been
tested on rats, the researchers said the
new approach should work in humans as
well. The treatment, called MRC Ox-38,
should be effective in other organs as well,
such as the kidney, said Medicine Prof.
Garrison Fathman, the principal inves
tigator on the research.
His colleague Thomas Flavin, a professor
in the department of Cardiovascular Sur
gery, presented the findings yesterday at
a meeting of the International Society for
Heart Transplantation in Munich, West
Germany.
The new method involves antibodies,
called anti-CD 4 antibodies, that prevent the
immune system from attacking the trans
planted organ. Antibodies are the cells that
fight foreign invaders to the body, but in
this case, they are used to destroy the
white blood cells that can fight the new
organ.
"It's clear there's a lot of potential there,"
said Harvard University's Hugh Auc
hincloss. In his research, Auchincloss uses
similar transplantation techniques, with
skin grafts instead of hearts.
Normally when heart transplants occur,
the body fights cells of the new heart as
though they were harmful viruses or bac
teria. The entire immune system gears up
to respond to the foreign tissue invading
it. What the immune system can't recog
nize, is that the new organ it is destroying
is vital for the person's survival.
To combat this immune response, doc
tors must administer a life-long series of
drugs called immunosuppressors to prevent
the immune system from destroying the
body's new organ. With the new therapy,
transplant patients could potentially go
home days after the operation and not have
to worry about taking medication.
"As transplantation numbers have im
proved in terms of survival of the patient,
and in terms of quantity — how long the
patient survives — the issue of quality of
life has become the real emphasis," said
Vaughn Starnes, assistant professor of car
diovascular surgery.
With the new development at the School
of Medicine, doctors may, in a few years,
give transplant patients this therapy that
will temporarily "paralyze" the body's im
mune system, but at the same time not
completely disable it.
Fathman said he does not expect to see
clinical application in humans for another
three years at least.
Concurs Auchincloss of Harvard: "It's a
long way from clinical applications." Auc
hincloss said he expects that doctors will
eventually tailor "cocktails of antibodies"
for specific transplant patients, depending
on the circumstances.
Antibod}' treatments for use with trans

plants have been around for 20 years, but
only in the last five or six years have
researchers been able to make antibodies
with the specificity to destroy the immune
cells they don't want.
With this specific treatment, the antibody
kills many of the white blood cells, called
CD4 T helper cells, that stimulate the
major immune cells involved in heart re
jection.
But, doctors admit, it is a thin line be
tween turning off the immune system just
enough to prevent heart rejection, and com
pletely opening up the body to host of other
infections.
Fathman said it is like substituting one

disease — heart disease — for another —
immune deficiency. With the headaches of
having the immune suppression treat
ments, transplant patients must fight
against a host of diseases that can affect
them, much like they can affect victims of
AIDS, acquired immune deficiency
syndrome.
One decisive advantage to this new treat
ment, say the scientists who developed it,
is that not all of the cells necessary to
revive the immune system are killed. With
the treatment, only mature ones die,
leaving the young cells to repopulate.
The young T cells at this stage have not
yet not "learned" the difference between

the host and one of the implanted heart
invaders. When the T cells mature, there
are none left that are targeted to destroy
the cells in the transplant.
Therefore, the heart is not rejected, and
as soon as the T cells mature, the body's
immune system is working again.
According to Fathman, the rats' immune
systems were completely suppressed for
about three weeks.
The team transplanted a heart from an
ordinary rat into the abdomen of the
recipient rat. The recipient, one of 12 rats
in all, received a treatment of antibodies
before the operation in single or multiple
doses.

Heart Transplantation in Munich, West
Germany.
The new method involves antibodies,
called anti-CD 4 antibodies, that prevent the
immune system from attacking the trans
planted organ. Antibodies are the cells that
fight foreign invaders to the body, but in
this case, they are used to destroy the
white blood cells that can fight the new
organ.
"It's clear there's a lot of potential there,"
said Harvard University's Hugh Auc
hincloss. In his research, Auchincloss uses
similar transplantation techniques, with
skin grafts instead of hearts.
Normally when heart transplants occur,
the body fights cells of the new heart as
though they were harmful viruses or bac
teria. The entire immune system gears up
to respond to the foreign tissue invading
it. What the immune system can't recog
nize, is that the new organ it is destroying
is vital for the person's survival.
To combat this immune response, doc
tors must administer a life-long series of
drugs called immunosuppressors to prevent
the immune system from destroying the
body's new organ. With the new therapy,
transplant patients could potentially go
home days after the operation and not have
to worry about taking medication.
"As transplantation numbers have im
proved in terms of survival of the patient,
and in terms of quantity — how long the
patient survives — the issue of quality of
life has become the real emphasis," said
Vaughn Starnes, assistant professor of car
diovascular surgery.
With the new development at the School
of Medicine, doctors may, in a few years,
give transplant patients this therapy that
will temporarily "paralyze" the body's im
mune system, but at the same time not
completely disable it.
Fathman said he does not expect to see
clinical application in humans for another
three years at least.
Concurs Auchincloss of Harvard: "It's a
long way from clinical applications." Auc
hincloss said he expects that doctors will
eventually tailor "cocktails of antibodies"
for specific transplant patients, depending
on the circumstances.
Antibod}' treatments for use with trans

plants have been around for 20 years, but
only in the last five or six years have
researchers been able to make antibodies
with the specificity to destroy the immune
cells they don't want.
With this specific treatment, the antibody
kills many of the white blood cells, called
CD4 T helper cells, that stimulate the
major immune cells involved in heart re
jection.
But, doctors admit, it is a thin line be
tween turning off the immune system just
enough to prevent heart rejection, and com
pletely opening up the body to host of other
infections.
Fathman said it is like substituting one

disease — heart disease — for another —
immune deficiency. With the headaches of
having the immune suppression treat
ments, transplant patients must fight
against a host of diseases that can affect
them, much like they can affect victims of
AIDS, acquired immune deficiency
syndrome.
One decisive advantage to this new treat
ment, say the scientists who developed it,
is that not all of the cells necessary to
revive the immune system are killed. With
the treatment, only mature ones die,
leaving the young cells to repopulate.
The young T cells at this stage have not
yet not "learned" the difference between

the host and one of the implanted heart
invaders. When the T cells mature, there
are none left that are targeted to destroy
the cells in the transplant.
Therefore, the heart is not rejected, and
as soon as the T cells mature, the body's
immune system is working again.
According to Fathman, the rats' immune
systems were completely suppressed for
about three weeks.
The team transplanted a heart from an
ordinary rat into the abdomen of the
recipient rat. The recipient, one of 12 rats
in all, received a treatment of antibodies
before the operation in single or multiple
doses.
