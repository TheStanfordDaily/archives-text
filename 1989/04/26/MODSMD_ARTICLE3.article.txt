# Research on human fetal tissue: the crossing of life and death
## 
### Stephanie Sansoni 
In a high-security laboratory at
the Medical Center, dozens of
AIDS-infected mice might some
day yield clues to cures for the
fatal disease.
This research, the scientists say,
is made possible by a special in
gredient implanted into the mice:
human fetal tissue. As they
scamper around in their heavily
restricted environment, these
little mice are at the seat of a
controversy marked by strong
emotions on both sides of the

issue.
On April 20, the New England
Journal of Medicine published a
report by the Committee on Eth
ics at the Stanford Medical Center
on use of fetal tissue. The report,
the first on this controversial sub
ject by a mcyor U.S. medical fa
cility, concluded that as long as
scientists stringently adhere to
certain regulations, fetal tissue
transplantation should continue.
The controversy, however,
reaches far beyond Stanford's
boundaries and into the heart of
the nation.

Today, the U.S. Supreme Court
will hear the case of Webster v.
Reproductive Health Services,
which challenges the fundamental
right to abortion set by the 1973
Roe v. Wade decision. Since the
ruling, the Wade case has never
completely escaped the public con
science.
If the Supreme Court ruling on
the Webster case restricts abor
tions, this decison could be detri
mental to transplantation re
search, say scientists, by way of
drastically reducing the availabil
ity of fetuses viable for research.

Furthermore, restricting abor
tions could influence the govern
ment to take even more dramatic
steps by severely reducing funding
which fetal tissue research
receives; the National Institutes
of Health presently channels $12
million into this researcn.
Fetal tissue research has al
ready felt the effects of such gov
ernment intervention. In April,
1988, the NIH, under the Reagan
administration, placed a mora
torium on all federal funding for
fetal tissue transplantation by sci
entists using tissues from induced

abortions.
The ban has had little impact
on most fetal research because the
ban only restricts federal funding
for research on tissue implanted
into human subjects. At the time
of the ban, only one researcher
was supported by the NIH for
transplantation of human fetal
tissue into other humans. Most
human fetal tissue is transplanted
into animals.
Researchers say they need fetal
tissue because it grows easier, it
doesn't reject the host and it's
adaptable. For instance, Dr. Irving

Weissman and Dr. Mike McCune
of the Medical School, implanted
fetal tissue into mice because they
needed tissue that would not be
rejected by the host mice. Fetal
tissue does not yet contain an
tibodies, cells which kill foreign
material — good or bad — in the
body.
Research at other universities
has led to breakthroughs on the
pathway to treatment for diabetes,
Parkinson's disease, AIDS and a
host of other life- threatening ail
