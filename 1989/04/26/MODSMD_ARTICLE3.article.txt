# Research on human fetal tissue: the crossing of life and death
## 
### Stephanie Sansoni 
In a high-security laboratory at
the Medical Center, dozens of
AIDS-infected mice might some
day yield clues to cures for the
fatal disease.
This research, the scientists say,
is made possible by a special in
gredient implanted into the mice:
human fetal tissue. As they
scamper around in their heavily
restricted environment, these
little mice are at the seat of a
controversy marked by strong
emotions on both sides of the

issue.
On April 20, the New England
Journal of Medicine published a
report by the Committee on Eth
ics at the Stanford Medical Center
on use of fetal tissue. The report,
the first on this controversial sub
ject by a mcyor U.S. medical fa
cility, concluded that as long as
scientists stringently adhere to
certain regulations, fetal tissue
transplantation should continue.
The controversy, however,
reaches far beyond Stanford's
boundaries and into the heart of
the nation.

Today, the U.S. Supreme Court
will hear the case of Webster v.
Reproductive Health Services,
which challenges the fundamental
right to abortion set by the 1973
Roe v. Wade decision. Since the
ruling, the Wade case has never
completely escaped the public con
science.
If the Supreme Court ruling on
the Webster case restricts abor
tions, this decison could be detri
mental to transplantation re
search, say scientists, by way of
drastically reducing the availabil
ity of fetuses viable for research.

Furthermore, restricting abor
tions could influence the govern
ment to take even more dramatic
steps by severely reducing funding
which fetal tissue research
receives; the National Institutes
of Health presently channels $12
million into this researcn.
Fetal tissue research has al
ready felt the effects of such gov
ernment intervention. In April,
1988, the NIH, under the Reagan
administration, placed a mora
torium on all federal funding for
fetal tissue transplantation by sci
entists using tissues from induced

abortions.
The ban has had little impact
on most fetal research because the
ban only restricts federal funding
for research on tissue implanted
into human subjects. At the time
of the ban, only one researcher
was supported by the NIH for
transplantation of human fetal
tissue into other humans. Most
human fetal tissue is transplanted
into animals.
Researchers say they need fetal
tissue because it grows easier, it
doesn't reject the host and it's
adaptable. For instance, Dr. Irving

Weissman and Dr. Mike McCune
of the Medical School, implanted
fetal tissue into mice because they
needed tissue that would not be
rejected by the host mice. Fetal
tissue does not yet contain an
tibodies, cells which kill foreign
material — good or bad — in the
body.
Research at other universities
has led to breakthroughs on the
pathway to treatment for diabetes,
Parkinson's disease, AIDS and a
host of other life- threatening ail
ments.
Not everyone agrees that this
research is to society's advantage.
"The preborn child has been
preyed upon by a scientific com
munity," said Cammille Jiglio of
the California Right-to-Life or
ganization.
In the last few years, this con
flict between researchers and
right-to-life activists has grown
increasingly severe.
"I think that it's only after you
talk about transplants that the

public has become all excited
about the subject," said Dorle
Vawter, a bioethecist at the Center
for Biomedical Ethics at the Uni
versity of Minnesota. Vawter
pointed out that fetal tissue has
been used for research since 1930.
Dr. Tom RafTin, head of the
Medical School's Committee on
Ethics, said "the key issue of con
cern is that the research might
stimulate elective abortions."
Many right-to-life activists have
made exactly this point: that
women might be encouraged to
have abortions knowing that the
fetus will benefit science.
The committee recommended
that the Uniform Anatomical Gift
Act, which has been passed into
law in all 50 states and the Dis

trict of Columbia be amended to
only allow blind donations of fetal
tissue. This would prevent women
having an abortion from knowing
or specifying the recipient of the
tissue.
This measure, the committee
hopes, will prevent women from
becoming pregnant with a fetus
destined only for abortion. Some
pro-life activists have used this as
one of their primary arguments
against the use of fetal tissue in
research.
"I personally don't think that
there is too much to that argu
ment," Vawter said.
For some, though, the contro
versy extends beyond the issue of
whether this kind of research en
courages abortions. Andrew Col
lier, a pastoral assistant at the St.
Thomas Aquinas Church in Palo
Alto, stated that some research
"uses fetuses as objects, and the
Church teaches that all human
life is human from conception.
This research denegrates the po
sition of the fetus."
Vawter commented, "One of the
questions being asked is 'Have we
really explored all the possible
sources for aborted pregnancies?
Have we looked at using tissue
from spontaneous pregnancies?"'
The Church does not object to
using fetal tissue obtained from
spontaneous abortions, Collier
said.
However, tissue from spontane
ous abortions is not viable for re
search, scientists say. Further
more, they say, the supply is min
imal and unpredictable, and much
of it contains genetic defects,
making it infeasible for tissue
transplantation.
Raffin said the ethics commit
tee at the Medical School has
decided that certain regulations
regarding fetal tissue research
must be implemented to insure
the morality of this research. As

one such example, he suggested:
"The scientific community cannot
allow the fetus to become a
marketable product."
The fetus could become a com
modity if the woman or the doctor
performing the abortion profited
— monetarily or otherwise —
from the use of this tissue, RafTin
said.

"Subject to [certain] conditions,
human fetal tissue can be used
ethically for medical research and
treatment," the ethics committee
report said.
Jiglio of the California Right
to-Life group does not agree. "Fe
tal experimentation has gotten
way out of hand," she said.
"No one can truly anticipate
what we don't know," said Dr.
Randy Weingarten, a member of
the Stanford Medical Center Com
mittee on Ethics.
"There might be some un
foreseen uses of fetal tissue that
can become unrestrained and that
is the tremendous risk of that re
search," Weingarten said.
To many right-to-life activists,
though, it is not a matter of wor
rying about potential uses of
fetuses in research tomorrow, but
the real use of them in research
today.
For these activists, no ethics
committee should decide the fate
of fetuses. "That's pretty disgust
ing — to treat human beings that
way, whether they are preborn or
not," Jiglio said.

"The preborn child has been

public has become all excited
about the subject," said Dorle
Vawter, a bioethecist at the Center
for Biomedical Ethics at the Uni
versity of Minnesota. Vawter
pointed out that fetal tissue has
been used for research since 1930.
Dr. Tom RafTin, head of the
Medical School's Committee on
Ethics, said "the key issue of con
cern is that the research might
stimulate elective abortions."
Many right-to-life activists have
made exactly this point: that
women might be encouraged to
have abortions knowing that the
fetus will benefit science.
The committee recommended
that the Uniform Anatomical Gift
Act, which has been passed into
law in all 50 states and the Dis

trict of Columbia be amended to
only allow blind donations of fetal
tissue. This would prevent women
having an abortion from knowing
or specifying the recipient of the
tissue.
This measure, the committee
hopes, will prevent women from
becoming pregnant with a fetus
destined only for abortion. Some
pro-life activists have used this as
one of their primary arguments
against the use of fetal tissue in
research.
"I personally don't think that
there is too much to that argu
ment," Vawter said.
For some, though, the contro
versy extends beyond the issue of
whether this kind of research en
courages abortions. Andrew Col
lier, a pastoral assistant at the St.
Thomas Aquinas Church in Palo
Alto, stated that some research
"uses fetuses as objects, and the
Church teaches that all human
life is human from conception.
This research denegrates the po
sition of the fetus."
Vawter commented, "One of the
questions being asked is 'Have we
really explored all the possible
sources for aborted pregnancies?
Have we looked at using tissue
from spontaneous pregnancies?"'
The Church does not object to
using fetal tissue obtained from
spontaneous abortions, Collier
said.
However, tissue from spontane
ous abortions is not viable for re
search, scientists say. Further
more, they say, the supply is min
imal and unpredictable, and much
of it contains genetic defects,
making it infeasible for tissue
transplantation.
Raffin said the ethics commit
tee at the Medical School has
decided that certain regulations
regarding fetal tissue research
must be implemented to insure
the morality of this research. As

one such example, he suggested:
"The scientific community cannot
allow the fetus to become a
marketable product."
The fetus could become a com
modity if the woman or the doctor
performing the abortion profited
— monetarily or otherwise —
from the use of this tissue, RafTin
said.

"Subject to [certain] conditions,
human fetal tissue can be used
ethically for medical research and
treatment," the ethics committee
report said.
Jiglio of the California Right
to-Life group does not agree. "Fe
tal experimentation has gotten
way out of hand," she said.
"No one can truly anticipate
what we don't know," said Dr.
Randy Weingarten, a member of
the Stanford Medical Center Com
mittee on Ethics.
"There might be some un
foreseen uses of fetal tissue that
can become unrestrained and that
is the tremendous risk of that re
search," Weingarten said.
To many right-to-life activists,
though, it is not a matter of wor
rying about potential uses of
fetuses in research tomorrow, but
the real use of them in research
today.
For these activists, no ethics
committee should decide the fate
of fetuses. "That's pretty disgust
ing — to treat human beings that
way, whether they are preborn or
not," Jiglio said.
In a high-security laboratory at
the Medical Center, dozens of
AIDS-infected mice might some
day yield clues to cures for the
fatal disease.
This research, the scientists say,
is made possible by a special in
gredient implanted into the mice:
human fetal tissue. As they
scamper around in their heavily
restricted environment, these
little mice are at the seat of a
controversy marked by strong
emotions on both sides of the

issue.
On April 20, the New England
Journal of Medicine published a
report by the Committee on Eth
ics at the Stanford Medical Center
on use of fetal tissue. The report,
the first on this controversial sub
ject by a mcyor U.S. medical fa
cility, concluded that as long as
scientists stringently adhere to
certain regulations, fetal tissue
transplantation should continue.
The controversy, however,
reaches far beyond Stanford's
boundaries and into the heart of
the nation.

Today, the U.S. Supreme Court
will hear the case of Webster v.
Reproductive Health Services,
which challenges the fundamental
right to abortion set by the 1973
Roe v. Wade decision. Since the
ruling, the Wade case has never
completely escaped the public con
science.
If the Supreme Court ruling on
the Webster case restricts abor
tions, this decison could be detri
mental to transplantation re
search, say scientists, by way of
drastically reducing the availabil
ity of fetuses viable for research.

Furthermore, restricting abor
tions could influence the govern
ment to take even more dramatic
steps by severely reducing funding
which fetal tissue research
receives; the National Institutes
of Health presently channels $12
million into this researcn.
Fetal tissue research has al
ready felt the effects of such gov
ernment intervention. In April,
1988, the NIH, under the Reagan
administration, placed a mora
torium on all federal funding for
fetal tissue transplantation by sci
entists using tissues from induced

abortions.
The ban has had little impact
on most fetal research because the
ban only restricts federal funding
for research on tissue implanted
into human subjects. At the time
of the ban, only one researcher
was supported by the NIH for
transplantation of human fetal
tissue into other humans. Most
human fetal tissue is transplanted
into animals.
Researchers say they need fetal
tissue because it grows easier, it
doesn't reject the host and it's
adaptable. For instance, Dr. Irving

Weissman and Dr. Mike McCune
of the Medical School, implanted
fetal tissue into mice because they
needed tissue that would not be
rejected by the host mice. Fetal
tissue does not yet contain an
