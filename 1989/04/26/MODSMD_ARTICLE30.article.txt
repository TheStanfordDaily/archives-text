. How do microwaves work ?
A. These ovens which have
• been used to blow up grem
lins, cook food by introducing
— you guessed it — microwaves
into an oven chamber, according
to a physicist at the Stanford
Linear Accelerator Center, the
largest microwave west of the
Mississippi.
Microwaves are high-fre
quency electromagnetic waves
produced by a device known as
a magnitron. Microwave ovens
were designed because water
has a propensity for absorbing
these high frequency waves and
because most foods are mostly
water.
Ceramics and other materials,
on the other hand, are not
heated in the ovens because they
do not absorb microwaves very
well. Therefore, your meal can
be baked to a toasty warm tem
perature while the plate might

not be hot to the touch.
When microwaves are intro
duced into the oven chamber,
they bounce around and are ab
sorbed by the food. Because
water absorbs microwaves, the
ovens heat food by vibrating
water molecules in the food at
a higher frequency than usual.
Microwaves penetrate the
food and heat it uniformly,
whereas conventional ovens
usually heat from the outside
in. A steak cooked in a conven
tional oven may look cooked on
the outsided, but may actually
be raw on the inside.
According to Physics Asst.
Prof. Peter Michelson, gremlins
and other creatures, could pos
sibly explode in a microwave
oven. If foods — or creatures
— get too hot, they might re
lease the energy in the form of
an explosion.
And if that doesn't blow you
away, take note that one of the
physics buildings is named after
the Varian brothers, the inven
tors of the klystron tube for
producing microwaves. The two
brothers, who worked at Stan
ford decades ago, originally de
signed klystrons for radar
detection during World War 11.
Their invention has had great
impact on numerous technolo
gies. For example, klystrons at
SLAC — 240 in all — boost
electrons and positrons to

speeds close to the speed of
light. This perhaps makes the
two-mile-long accelerator the
largest microwave oven in the
world.
Q # Why are evergreens al
• ways green ?
A. Roses are red, violets are
• blue, and evergreens are
always green because they do
not lose their leaves as decid
uous trees do.
Evergreens such as pine and
spruce trees only lose their
leaves every several years, ac
cording to Biological Sciences
Prof. Paul Green.
Unlike trees that lose their
leaves every year, evergreens
undergo photosynthesis — the
process of producing carbo
hydrates — all year. Photosyn
thesis is driven by chloroplasts,
green organelles in many plant
cells.
Deciduous tree leaves have
distinct disadvantages to ever
green leaves, Green said. In the
winter, deciduous trees can suf
fer frost damage or water loss.
The needle shape of the leaves
in some evergreen trees reduces
water loss by lowering the ratio
of surface area to volume.
On the other hand, the small
surface of the needles makes the
task of absorbing sunlight more
difficult.
