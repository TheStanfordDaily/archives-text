## Tennis team crushes helpless Huskies, 7-2 
### Cameron Macky Senior staff writer 
When Stanford's Barry Richards put a
volley into the net midway through the
second set of yesterday's No. 1 doubles
match, Washington*B Knute Lund yelled
"We scored a point!" and gave his partner
a high five.
It was that kind of day for Washington.

Men's Tennis
Cardinal 7, Huskies 2

Actually, Lund and partner David
Johnson had scored several times before
that point. They had even won two games
in the first set. The mtyor problem the
Husky duo had was that they scored all
of two points in the eight games that they
received serve from Richards and Dan Tur
bow. Both points came on Richards volleys
that found the net.
Most of the time, though, the Husky
players couldn't even put the ball in play
after receiving a serve. Turbow's last serv
ice game, at 4-2 in the second set, went
like this:
Serve No. 1: Lund bangs the return five
feet long of the baseline. 1-0.
Serve No. 2: Johnson hits the return at
the bottom of the net. 2-0.
Serve No. 3: Lund's return quacks all
the way to the net. 3-0.
Serve No. 4: Guess. 4-0 and game, Stan
ford.
"They didn't return serve very well,"
Turbow said afterward. With a straight
face.
The two points the Huskies scored
weren't quite enough, and Richards and
Turbow romped, 6-2, 6-2. It was the first
time the pair had played No. 1 after four
outings in the third doubles spot.
"Moving up" was a recurrent theme for
the Cardinal yesterday. Three regular
members of the singles lineup watched
from the stands, which gave Curtis Dunn,
Jason Yee and John Connolly a shot at the
singles action.

Yee made the most of the opportunity
— or the least, if you go by number of
games played. His 6-1, 6-0 crushing of Jon
Freudenberger at No. 5 gives him a singles
record of 1-0 on the year.
"Jason just got going and never let up,"
Stanford Asst. Coach John Whitlinger said.
"He never gave the guy a chance to get in
the match."
Dunn had a bit more trouble with Jeff
Parry at fourth singles, but couldn't really
complain about his 6-0, 6-2 win. Connolly,
though, lost the first singles match of his
collegiate career, 6-4, 4-6, 6-2 to Robert
Grundy.
"This was the first time I've played in
singles that wasn't just an exhibition,"
Connolly said. "I've played a lot of doubles,
but this was the first singles match I've
played that's counted.
"When that type of thing is on your
mind, you may be playing someone you
normally would beat and still lose."
Grundy, of course, also had a little some
thing to do with the loss. "[HeJ was good,
he played really well," Connolly said. "I
wasn't exactly choking left and right."
The experience is what counts, according
to Whitlinger. "It's good to get these guys
in there, because they're not exactly match
tough," he said. "They haven't played many
matches, if any."
That wasn't exactly true of yesterday's
top three Cardinal players. Jeff Tarango,
the only member of the squad to play in
his normal position, worked lan Schroeder
6-2, 6-3 in less time than it took Yee to
paste Freudenberger.
Martin Blackman made things interest
ing against Johnson before winning 6-3,
7-6. Serving for the match at 5-4, Blackman
had his serve broken, but came right back
for a break point of his own. His service
return fell wide, however, and he found
himself down 5-6.
Blackman then held to force a tiebreaker.
With several gorgeous slice backhand vol
leys, an ace and a service winner, he took
the breaker 7-3, and the match was over.
Meanwhile, next door at No. 3, Barry
