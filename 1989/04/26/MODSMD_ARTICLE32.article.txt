# Spikers robbed of NCAA Final Four bid by WIVA coin flip
## 
### 
Finally, the tiebreaker to determine
the champion of the Western In
tercollegiate Volleyball Association
has been announced.
Unfortunately, the Stanford Cardinal
has been left out in the cold. Why?
Can you say: "Coin toss?"
Knowing it had to win its final three
matches this weekend to force a playoff
with UCLA, Stanford did just that —
dropping only one game in the process.
The kids on the Farm established beyond
a shadow of a doubt that they are the
best in the nation.
Yet, the wizards of WIVA, eschewing
the tiebreaking procedure written in the
league manual, decided to let Lady Luck
determine who would received an auto
matic berth to the NCAA Final Four.
Once upon a time, the rule read like
this: If two teams are tied for the con
ference title, a one-match playoff will be
held on a neutral site. The winner will
be awarded the berth in the semifinals.
UCLA and Stanford were going to play
that match two days ago in Albert
Gersten Pavilion on the campus of Loyola
Marymount University. Since the two
teams split the season series, it seemed
like the most equitable method.

What the WTVA wizards realized, how
ever, was that Stanford would have
played one match over the NCAA pre-
Final Four limit of 32 if they took part
in such a playoff.
Instead, they went for the soon-to-be
infamous coin flip. It may go down in
Stanford lore with The Play . . . and the
Siena game . . . and . . . you get the idea.
Volleyball aficionados everywhere, or
anywhere for that matter, could've
devised a better tiebreaker. Total team
height might qualify Or aggregate GPA.
Or — dare I say it? — performance in
head-to-head competition.
A quick look at that Stanford-UCLA
matchups of 1989 gives the Cardinal a
definitive edge. In the first meeting at

Stanford, UCLA needed five games to
beat the Cardinal. In the rematch, your
home team dissected the Bruins on the
hallowed hardwood of Pauley Pavilion.
It doesn't take a rocket scientist to
combine those results. Stanford, win
ner of 5-of-8 games with UCLA,
proved itself the superior volleyball team.
WIVA, with its patented 25-cent piece,
proved that UCLA would do better at
the slot machines.
It's not as if the Bruins didn't have
enough of an advantage already. UCLA
has won 12 national titles in the 19 years
the NCAA has conducted a volleyball
tournament. Stanford, the upstart, has
never won a postseason match.
Now the Cardinal will have to win two
— in the tough Western Regional Selec
tion Tournament — to reach its first-ever
Final Four.
Imagine if the coin came up heads.
Stanford, instead of needing wins against
No. 4 USC and either No. 3 Hawaii or
No. 6 UC-Santa Barbara, could make
reservations for the national semifinals.
As they might say in So Cal: "Totally
bogus, dude!"

Xmas came early for the Bruins, but
the last laugh may yet belong to
Fred Sturm and Co.
While UCLA is strong at every aspect
of the game, Stanford lacks any apparent
weaknesses as well. Leading the Cardinal
attacks is player-of-the-year candidate
Dan Hanan.
Hanan is the only player in the country
who is ranked among the top 10 in four
of five statistical categories kept by the
NCAA. When he's on his game — which
is to say almost every night — Hanan
is virtually unstoppable.
Teaming with Hanan on the front line
is Olympic hero Scott Fortune. In Seoul,
Fortune learned how to win the big one,
as he as his teammates downed the
Soviets to win the gold medal. That
prime-time experience could prove vital
in the postseason.
Hanan and Fortune are no two-man
team, however. The third starting front
liner, Duncan Blackman, is one of the
nation's top freshmen. And, Stanford is
deep.
John Alstrom, Craig Forsyth and Ryan
Moos have provided quality play for the

Cardinal at different times this season.
Then there's the secret weapon — a
6-foot-9, redheaded power forward by the
name of Adam Keefe.
In the LMU match Friday, Stanford
dropped the first game and was trailing
6-2 in the second. Sturm made a lineup
change, inserting Keefe for Forsyth.
Keefe had 16 kills in the remainder of
the match and hit a sizzling .652.
Quarterbacking the whole shew is set
ter Parker Blackman. A smooth operator,
Blackman has delivered the ball with pre
cision to the Monsters of Maples.
Stanford has won five of the si*
matches played against teams in the!
regional field. Thirty-five of 38 times,
WTVA teams have been finalists for the
championship.
If the "Take-No-Prisoners" Cardinal
meets UCLA in the final, the Bruins just
might find they don't have any change
to bail them out this time.

has been left out in the cold. Why?
Can you say: "Coin toss?"
Knowing it had to win its final three
matches this weekend to force a playoff
with UCLA, Stanford did just that —
dropping only one game in the process.
The kids on the Farm established beyond
a shadow of a doubt that they are the
best in the nation.
Yet, the wizards of WIVA, eschewing
the tiebreaking procedure written in the
league manual, decided to let Lady Luck
determine who would received an auto
matic berth to the NCAA Final Four.
Once upon a time, the rule read like
this: If two teams are tied for the con
ference title, a one-match playoff will be
held on a neutral site. The winner will
be awarded the berth in the semifinals.
UCLA and Stanford were going to play
that match two days ago in Albert
Gersten Pavilion on the campus of Loyola
Marymount University. Since the two
teams split the season series, it seemed
like the most equitable method.

What the WTVA wizards realized, how
ever, was that Stanford would have
played one match over the NCAA pre-
Final Four limit of 32 if they took part
in such a playoff.
Instead, they went for the soon-to-be
infamous coin flip. It may go down in
Stanford lore with The Play . . . and the
Siena game . . . and . . . you get the idea.
Volleyball aficionados everywhere, or
anywhere for that matter, could've
devised a better tiebreaker. Total team
height might qualify Or aggregate GPA.
Or — dare I say it? — performance in
head-to-head competition.
A quick look at that Stanford-UCLA
matchups of 1989 gives the Cardinal a
definitive edge. In the first meeting at

Stanford, UCLA needed five games to
beat the Cardinal. In the rematch, your
home team dissected the Bruins on the
hallowed hardwood of Pauley Pavilion.
It doesn't take a rocket scientist to
combine those results. Stanford, win
ner of 5-of-8 games with UCLA,
proved itself the superior volleyball team.
WIVA, with its patented 25-cent piece,
proved that UCLA would do better at
the slot machines.
It's not as if the Bruins didn't have
enough of an advantage already. UCLA
has won 12 national titles in the 19 years
the NCAA has conducted a volleyball
tournament. Stanford, the upstart, has
never won a postseason match.
Now the Cardinal will have to win two
— in the tough Western Regional Selec
tion Tournament — to reach its first-ever
Final Four.
Imagine if the coin came up heads.
Stanford, instead of needing wins against
No. 4 USC and either No. 3 Hawaii or
No. 6 UC-Santa Barbara, could make
reservations for the national semifinals.
As they might say in So Cal: "Totally
bogus, dude!"

Xmas came early for the Bruins, but
the last laugh may yet belong to
Fred Sturm and Co.
While UCLA is strong at every aspect
of the game, Stanford lacks any apparent
weaknesses as well. Leading the Cardinal
attacks is player-of-the-year candidate
Dan Hanan.
Hanan is the only player in the country
who is ranked among the top 10 in four
of five statistical categories kept by the
NCAA. When he's on his game — which
is to say almost every night — Hanan
is virtually unstoppable.
Teaming with Hanan on the front line
is Olympic hero Scott Fortune. In Seoul,
Fortune learned how to win the big one,
as he as his teammates downed the
Soviets to win the gold medal. That
prime-time experience could prove vital
in the postseason.
Hanan and Fortune are no two-man
team, however. The third starting front
liner, Duncan Blackman, is one of the
nation's top freshmen. And, Stanford is
deep.
John Alstrom, Craig Forsyth and Ryan
Moos have provided quality play for the

Cardinal at different times this season.
Then there's the secret weapon — a
6-foot-9, redheaded power forward by the
name of Adam Keefe.
In the LMU match Friday, Stanford
dropped the first game and was trailing
6-2 in the second. Sturm made a lineup
change, inserting Keefe for Forsyth.
Keefe had 16 kills in the remainder of
the match and hit a sizzling .652.
Quarterbacking the whole shew is set
ter Parker Blackman. A smooth operator,
Blackman has delivered the ball with pre
cision to the Monsters of Maples.
Stanford has won five of the si*
matches played against teams in the!
regional field. Thirty-five of 38 times,
WTVA teams have been finalists for the
championship.
If the "Take-No-Prisoners" Cardinal
meets UCLA in the final, the Bruins just
might find they don't have any change
to bail them out this time.
