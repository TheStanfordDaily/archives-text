# Golfers take fourth at Pac-10s

### David Hirning Staff writer 
Like Stanford's tennis and base
ball squads, the women's golf
team plays in a conference that
is second to none in the country.
That reality was made evident
over the last three days as the
Cardinal women were forced to
settle for fourth place at the Pac
-10 Championships in Pasadena.
Host team USC dominated the
competition, blasting a powerful

Arizona State squad by 14 strokes
(911-925). The Arizona Wildcats
managed to edge out the Cardinal
for third, 935 to 937.
Jodi Figley, bouncing back from
an unusually poor performance at
the Lady Sun Devil in Arizona,
ripped a second-round 73 on her
way to an impressive 229, good
for seventh place in the 50-player
tournament. But the sophomore's
first-round difficulties continued
to nag her.
"I was happy with the second

day â€” I putted a lot better and
shot an even par," Figley said.
"But the first day was not very
good. I shot an 80. It was the
same as the past couple tourna
ments. ... I didn't hit the ball
well and putted poorly."
It was Figley's play on Monday
that led the Cardinal to the low
round of the day (306) and vaulted
it from fifth to third place. But
No. 2-ranked ASU came out firing
