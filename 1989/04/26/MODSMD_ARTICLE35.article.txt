## Cyclists take Cal but not victory 
### Libby Feil Staff writer 
The Stanford cycling team
competed in its next-to-last
regular-season race last week
end at UC-Santa Cruz and re
turned home without a much
needed victory.
The Cardinal came in second
to Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo in
both an individual time trial
and a road race. However, Cal
ifornia, Stanford's rival for the
conference title, placed even
lower. The Bears finished third
both days.
Saturday's time trial, which
Santa Cruz had billed as a 14-
mile "hill climb," turned out
to be a 7 mile, flat course. Un
fortunately, despite some good
showings, the Cardinal did not
score enough cumulative points
to take the overall victory. The
men's A race was the Cardi
nal's best event.
Two Stanford cyclists scored
points for the team in the
men's A field. Graduate stu
dent Art Walker gritted his way
to second place, followed by
teammate Steve Miller in 13th.
The road race the next day
was "really grueling," accord

ing to captain Vit Henisz. The
cyclists rode around a 2.8-mile
circuit which featured 400 feet
of climb per lap. Once again
the men's A race garnered
points for Stanford, as did the
men's Band women's A races.
Walker broke away from the
main pack in the men's A di
vision with about 6 miles to go
and stayed away to capture
first place. "It was amazing and
he was a stud," Henisz said.
In the men's B field Stanford
displayed its depth. Brian Ster
ling and Ken Zimmerman took
third and fourth, followed by
Cardinal riders Jon Kaplan,
Hank Dart and Henisz in ninth,
12th and 13th places.
In the women's A category
Stanford had several consis
tently strong riders. Freshman
Tasha Brubaker took third
overall, followed by Laura Wil
son and Liz Moyer in Nth and
15th places.
Next weekend Stanford
travels to UC-Davis. The team
is hoping for two victories over
California to close the gap be
tween the two teams as they
head into conference champi
onships.

Softball team wins
two over weekend
Stanford's women's soflball
team played its last home
games of the season last week
end against Los Medanos and
Menlo Colleges and came away
victorious. Next weekend the
team travels to San Diego and
use.
Thursday's game against Los
Medanos was a close one. The
final score was 11-9. Katie
Voth had two doubles and four
RBI. Fellow Cardinal Rachel
Marcus had two singles, includ
ing the single that brought in
the game-winning run.
On Friday Stanford played a
double-header against Menlo
College, with victories of 18-12
and 15-4. In the first game
Kate Saldutti, Nancy Til
lapaugh, Marion Ingersoll and
Michele Veneto were all key
players.
The second game of the twin
bill was dominated by the Car
dinal. Minerva Tirado, Monica
Marquez, Ellen Tauber and
Voth all had excellent games.
Center fielder Tamara Sosnick
sprained her knee while trying to
steal third base, thereby ending
her season.

series at UCSB
The women's lacrosse team
traveled to Santa Barbara last
weekend to compete in a tourna
ment and came away with third
place. The team's record in the
tounament was 2-2 after playing
UC-Santa Barbara, California,
UC-San Diego and Whittier.
The loss to UC-Santa Barbara
was a heartbreaker. Since Stan
ford had beaten the Gauchos in
their last meeting, the Santa Bar
bara team was "on the warpath,"

captain Caroline Clevenger said.
However, after being behind for
the first half, the Cardinal came
back and tied the game. Stanford
lost 8-7 in overtime.
Cardinal Julianne Coleman
played "a really strong center po
sition," Clevenger said.
The match against California
was not as close. Since Stanford
did not take all of its most expe
rienced players with them, the
Cardinal players felt that they
competed well. California won,
11-4.
Stanford did win its matches
against UC-San Diego and Whit
tier, 8-2 and 9-1. Both Suzanne
Doi and Aruna Venkatachalam
played well.
The next tournament that Stan
ford will compete in will be May
6-7 in Seattle.

Cardinal Julianne Coleman
played "a really strong center po
sition," Clevenger said.
The match against California
was not as close. Since Stanford
did not take all of its most expe
rienced players with them, the
Cardinal players felt that they
competed well. California won,
11-4.
Stanford did win its matches
against UC-San Diego and Whit
tier, 8-2 and 9-1. Both Suzanne
Doi and Aruna Venkatachalam
played well.
The next tournament that Stan
ford will compete in will be May
6-7 in Seattle.
The Stanford cycling team
competed in its next-to-last
regular-season race last week
end at UC-Santa Cruz and re
turned home without a much
needed victory.
The Cardinal came in second
to Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo in
both an individual time trial
and a road race. However, Cal
ifornia, Stanford's rival for the
conference title, placed even
lower. The Bears finished third
both days.
Saturday's time trial, which
Santa Cruz had billed as a 14-
mile "hill climb," turned out
to be a 7 mile, flat course. Un
fortunately, despite some good
showings, the Cardinal did not
score enough cumulative points
to take the overall victory. The
men's A race was the Cardi
nal's best event.
Two Stanford cyclists scored
points for the team in the
men's A field. Graduate stu
dent Art Walker gritted his way
to second place, followed by
teammate Steve Miller in 13th.
The road race the next day
was "really grueling," accord

ing to captain Vit Henisz. The
cyclists rode around a 2.8-mile
circuit which featured 400 feet
of climb per lap. Once again
the men's A race garnered
points for Stanford, as did the
men's Band women's A races.
Walker broke away from the
main pack in the men's A di
vision with about 6 miles to go
and stayed away to capture
first place. "It was amazing and
he was a stud," Henisz said.
In the men's B field Stanford
displayed its depth. Brian Ster
ling and Ken Zimmerman took
third and fourth, followed by
Cardinal riders Jon Kaplan,
Hank Dart and Henisz in ninth,
12th and 13th places.
In the women's A category
Stanford had several consis
tently strong riders. Freshman
Tasha Brubaker took third
overall, followed by Laura Wil
son and Liz Moyer in Nth and
15th places.
Next weekend Stanford
travels to UC-Davis. The team
is hoping for two victories over
California to close the gap be
tween the two teams as they
head into conference champi
onships.

Softball team wins
two over weekend
Stanford's women's soflball
team played its last home
games of the season last week
end against Los Medanos and
Menlo Colleges and came away
victorious. Next weekend the
team travels to San Diego and
use.
Thursday's game against Los
Medanos was a close one. The
final score was 11-9. Katie
Voth had two doubles and four
RBI. Fellow Cardinal Rachel
Marcus had two singles, includ
ing the single that brought in
the game-winning run.
On Friday Stanford played a
double-header against Menlo
College, with victories of 18-12
and 15-4. In the first game
Kate Saldutti, Nancy Til
lapaugh, Marion Ingersoll and
Michele Veneto were all key
players.
The second game of the twin
bill was dominated by the Car
dinal. Minerva Tirado, Monica
Marquez, Ellen Tauber and
Voth all had excellent games.
Center fielder Tamara Sosnick
sprained her knee while trying to
steal third base, thereby ending
her season.
Women's lax splits
series at UCSB
The women's lacrosse team
traveled to Santa Barbara last
weekend to compete in a tourna
ment and came away with third
place. The team's record in the
tounament was 2-2 after playing
UC-Santa Barbara, California,
UC-San Diego and Whittier.
The loss to UC-Santa Barbara
was a heartbreaker. Since Stan
ford had beaten the Gauchos in
their last meeting, the Santa Bar
bara team was "on the warpath,"

captain Caroline Clevenger said.
However, after being behind for
the first half, the Cardinal came
back and tied the game. Stanford
lost 8-7 in overtime.
Cardinal Julianne Coleman
played "a really strong center po
