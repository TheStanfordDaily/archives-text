# Thrower Wheeler rolls into Pac-10s
## Top recruit, after injury-plagued seasons, enjoys undefeated 1989 
### Evan Tuchinsky Senior staff writer 
Erica Wheeler may be the best kept
secret in the Pacific 10 Conference.
Competing in what is generally
deemed the strongest track conference
in the country, a league filled with
Olympic gold medalists and defending
NCAA champions, it is easy for an ath
lete to be lost in the bustle.
Yet Wheeler, considered the best
javelin thrower coming out of high
school four years ago, remains virtually
unnoticed by all but the many throwers
she has bested. At the rate she is going
this season, celebrity may soon replace
anonymity.
Boasting an undefeated record in
1989, the defending Pac-10 champ has
gone head-to-head with the best
throwers in the country and emerged
victorious.
When the Pac-10 Championships ar
rive at her home stadium at Stanford
May 20-21, Wheeler may finally move
from the shadows into national
prominence. The senior set a Pac-10
record at last year's meet with a 192-
foot, two-inch throw, and may well
surprise the field again this year.
"She sometimes forgets that she is
one of the best collegiate throwers,"
Stanford throwing coach John Powell
said. "Erica is very capable of throwing
in the 190s again. Whether she does
that is a matter of motivation.
"Her talent and potential is that she'll
win them both (Pac-lOs and NCAAs).
Does that mean she'll win them both?
No. Could she? Yes. She's more expe
rienced now."
And more confident. Last year was a
rebuilding year for Wheeler, who missed
much of the previous season with a
shoulder injury that prevented her from
throwing.
Her return was less than spectacular
at first, but she made up for it at the
Pac-10 meet. Competing against a
strong field, she stunned even herself

'Her talent and potential is that she'll win both
the Pac-10s and NCAAs. Does that mean she'll
win them both? No. Could she? Yes. She's
more experienced now.'

with the 192-foot throw, the longest
distance achieved in the U.S. up to that
point in the year.
"It surprised me," Wheeler said, "not
so much that I never thought I could
throw that far but just what was hap
pening during last year. Last year was
not really a good year for me until
toward the end.
"It was just one of those days where
everything was really on," Wheeler
remembered. "Warm-ups were great,
and I felt really on. The 192 was great,
because that's what gave me my confi
dence back again.
"It shouldn't have happened. If you
ask my coach, I don't think he would
have predicted me to throw a 192. It
was a shock, and I really like to do that,
go in and shock the heck out of people."
The aftershocks swept her through
the NCAA Championships, where she
finished second in the nation. Confi
dence boosted, she is enjoying perhaps
the finest senior season a thrower could
have.
In her last three meets, Wheeler has
found herself behind throwers ranked
higher than she is, based on the dis
tances they have thrown so far this
year. In the end, however, it is Wheeler
who has had the satisfaction of winning,
calmly saving her finest throws for last.
Confidence has been the key, and her
appearance at the U.S. Olympic Trials
contributed greatly to her cause.
Wheeler was not among the Americans

who ventured to Seoul, but her personal
pre-Olympic experience fueled her
rekindled self-assurance.
"I used to think that everybody was
doing something different, and there
was some secret I didn't know," Wheeler
relayed. "People were throwing really
far, and I didn't feel I was included in
that group.
"After throwing 192 and having that
be the best throw in the nation, and
then at the Olympic Trials a 181 made
the team, I know that 1 am throwing
distances that are the top in the nation.
I feel very confident about winning
NCAAs. A 180 won it last year, so I
don't have to make that much of a jump
to win it."
But competition aside, it is the sport
itself and not any potential glory that
keeps Wheeler training. Injuries ham
pered her first several seasons at Stan
ford, but her love of the javelin inspired
her to persevere.
"The javelin is never boring for me,"
Wheeler said. "It's an event where it
seems like you can always throw it far
ther. It's fun to watch when it goes a
long distance, and there is so much
technically to be correct with.
"I know I'm still doing a lot of things
wrong," Wheeler added. "I just want to
catch the one where I'm doing every
thing right and see how far it goes.
That's what motivates me — waiting
for that perfect throw and seeing how
far it's going to go."

Senior Erica Wheeler is one of the pre-eminent javelin throwers In the nation. She
set a Pac-10 record with a 192-foot, 2-Inch throw at the Pac-10 Championships las*
year.
Erica Wheeler may be the best kept
secret in the Pacific 10 Conference.
Competing in what is generally
deemed the strongest track conference
in the country, a league filled with
Olympic gold medalists and defending
NCAA champions, it is easy for an ath
lete to be lost in the bustle.
Yet Wheeler, considered the best
javelin thrower coming out of high
school four years ago, remains virtually
unnoticed by all but the many throwers
she has bested. At the rate she is going
this season, celebrity may soon replace
anonymity.
Boasting an undefeated record in
1989, the defending Pac-10 champ has
gone head-to-head with the best
throwers in the country and emerged
victorious.
When the Pac-10 Championships ar
rive at her home stadium at Stanford
May 20-21, Wheeler may finally move
from the shadows into national
prominence. The senior set a Pac-10
record at last year's meet with a 192-
foot, two-inch throw, and may well
surprise the field again this year.
"She sometimes forgets that she is
one of the best collegiate throwers,"
Stanford throwing coach John Powell
said. "Erica is very capable of throwing
in the 190s again. Whether she does
that is a matter of motivation.
"Her talent and potential is that she'll
win them both (Pac-lOs and NCAAs).
Does that mean she'll win them both?
No. Could she? Yes. She's more expe
rienced now."
And more confident. Last year was a
rebuilding year for Wheeler, who missed
much of the previous season with a
shoulder injury that prevented her from
throwing.
Her return was less than spectacular
at first, but she made up for it at the
Pac-10 meet. Competing against a
strong field, she stunned even herself

'Her talent and potential is that she'll win both
the Pac-10s and NCAAs. Does that mean she'll
win them both? No. Could she? Yes. She's
more experienced now.'

with the 192-foot throw, the longest
distance achieved in the U.S. up to that
point in the year.
"It surprised me," Wheeler said, "not
so much that I never thought I could
throw that far but just what was hap
pening during last year. Last year was
not really a good year for me until
toward the end.
"It was just one of those days where
everything was really on," Wheeler
remembered. "Warm-ups were great,
and I felt really on. The 192 was great,
because that's what gave me my confi
dence back again.
"It shouldn't have happened. If you
ask my coach, I don't think he would
have predicted me to throw a 192. It
was a shock, and I really like to do that,
go in and shock the heck out of people."
The aftershocks swept her through
the NCAA Championships, where she
finished second in the nation. Confi
dence boosted, she is enjoying perhaps
the finest senior season a thrower could
have.
In her last three meets, Wheeler has
found herself behind throwers ranked
higher than she is, based on the dis
tances they have thrown so far this
year. In the end, however, it is Wheeler
who has had the satisfaction of winning,
calmly saving her finest throws for last.
Confidence has been the key, and her
appearance at the U.S. Olympic Trials
contributed greatly to her cause.
Wheeler was not among the Americans

who ventured to Seoul, but her personal
pre-Olympic experience fueled her
rekindled self-assurance.
"I used to think that everybody was
doing something different, and there
was some secret I didn't know," Wheeler
relayed. "People were throwing really
far, and I didn't feel I was included in
that group.
"After throwing 192 and having that
be the best throw in the nation, and
then at the Olympic Trials a 181 made
the team, I know that 1 am throwing
distances that are the top in the nation.
I feel very confident about winning
NCAAs. A 180 won it last year, so I
don't have to make that much of a jump
to win it."
But competition aside, it is the sport
itself and not any potential glory that
keeps Wheeler training. Injuries ham
pered her first several seasons at Stan
ford, but her love of the javelin inspired
her to persevere.
"The javelin is never boring for me,"
Wheeler said. "It's an event where it
seems like you can always throw it far
ther. It's fun to watch when it goes a
long distance, and there is so much
technically to be correct with.
"I know I'm still doing a lot of things
wrong," Wheeler added. "I just want to
catch the one where I'm doing every
thing right and see how far it goes.
That's what motivates me — waiting
for that perfect throw and seeing how
far it's going to go."
