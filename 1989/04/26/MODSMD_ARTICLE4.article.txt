# A 						Standard without teeth?
## 
### John Cuerva Staff writer 
Editor's note: This is the third in a four
part series examining the historical context
and modern-day implications of Stanford's
Fundamental Standard.

Although the Fundamental Standard is
worded to permit expulsion, in reality, ex
pulsion is virtually unheard of.
In the past six years there have been 53
violations of the Standard and 122 viola
tions of the Honor Code in cases that widely
varied in severity. In that time only one
student has been expelled.
According to Judicial Affirs Officer Sally
Cole, the expelled student:
• Forged letters of recommendation from
prominent professors and placed them on
file at the Career Planning and Placement
Center;
• Broke into a California school other
than Stanford and significantly altered his
transcripts; and
• Took the GMAT, a test required for
admission to business school, for another
person.
The student was eventually charged with

seven separate Standard violations.
"His lack of respect for the printed word
was just astonishing. If he didn't like what
something or someone said he just changed
it," Cole said.
University President Donald Kennedy,
who personally approves all punishments
given to students, expelled the student a
couple of weeks before he was to graduate.
The closest alternative to expulsion used
by the University is indefinite suspension,
for a minimum of two years, Cole said.
Students who receive an indefinite suspen-
sion may have to petition the Uni
versity to return, arguing that it
is in Stanford's best interest to
readmit them, Cole said.
"Expulsion is very rarely felt
to be an appropriate penalty," she
said.
The University's reluctance to
expel students who commit
serious violations of the Standard
can be seen in the following cases.
During 1986 fraternity Rush,
two intoxicated freshmen as
saulted another freshman. The
two freshmen kicked in the ribs
of the third student while he was
on the ground, causing his lungs
to collapse. The attack nearly
killed the freshman.
One of the freshmen involved
in the assault had a record of
serious misconduct prior to the
incident, according to Music Prof.
Tom Baumann, the resident fel
low at Trancos House, where the
freshman lived.
At the beginning of the year,
the student had been "vulgar,
abusive and threatening,"
Baumann said, citing the stu
dent's attempts to sell cocaine to
a staff member and an incident
in which the student urinated in
a bowl of carrots meant for a dorm
study break.
After numerous warnings to the
student, Baumann said he in
formed the residential dean of the
student's misconduct and
demanded the student be removed
from Trancos. He further sugges
ted the student had no place at
Stanford.
The student was immediately
moved to another residence.
After the assault, the freshman
was investigated for possible
violation of the Fundamental
Standard. Because of the policy
of confidentiality, Cole could not
comment on the outcome of the
case.
But an examination of the sum
mary of judicial activity for 1985-
86, which lists all punishments by
category, reveals that the maxi
mum penalty the freshman could
have received was an indefinite

suspension, with a stipulation re
quiring him to petition in order
to return.
The student may also have re
ceived a combination of penalities,
for example a monetary fine and
loss of University housing.
The student is currently en
rolled at Stanford.
Another example occurred last
spring quarter when a student was
arrested for stealing $60,000 in
computers from the Stanford
Bookstore — the largest heist in
the store's history.
The student was convicted of
felony and grand theft and sen
tenced to nine months in the
Santa Clara County Jail. He is
currently on a work furlough pro
gram, working in the day and re
turning to the jail at night.
Cole could not say if the student
had been charged with a Standard
violation. Nonetheless, because
the information is already public,
Cole could tell The Daily that the
student, a senior, did not receive
a degree last June. Students that
receive suspensions can not
receive their degree until the
suspension is over.
Cole also stated, "There is a
precedent for viewing thefts from
the Bookstore as violations of the
Fundamental Standard." Prior to
this case, no precedent existed for
a crime of that scope.

expel students who commit
serious violations of the Standard
can be seen in the following cases.
During 1986 fraternity Rush,
two intoxicated freshmen as
saulted another freshman. The
two freshmen kicked in the ribs
of the third student while he was
on the ground, causing his lungs
to collapse. The attack nearly
killed the freshman.
One of the freshmen involved
in the assault had a record of
serious misconduct prior to the
incident, according to Music Prof.
Tom Baumann, the resident fel
low at Trancos House, where the
freshman lived.
At the beginning of the year,
the student had been "vulgar,
abusive and threatening,"
Baumann said, citing the stu
dent's attempts to sell cocaine to
a staff member and an incident
in which the student urinated in
a bowl of carrots meant for a dorm
study break.
After numerous warnings to the
student, Baumann said he in
formed the residential dean of the
student's misconduct and
demanded the student be removed
from Trancos. He further sugges
ted the student had no place at
Stanford.
The student was immediately
moved to another residence.
After the assault, the freshman
was investigated for possible
violation of the Fundamental
Standard. Because of the policy
of confidentiality, Cole could not
comment on the outcome of the
case.
But an examination of the sum
mary of judicial activity for 1985-
86, which lists all punishments by
category, reveals that the maxi
mum penalty the freshman could
have received was an indefinite

suspension, with a stipulation re
quiring him to petition in order
to return.
The student may also have re
ceived a combination of penalities,
for example a monetary fine and
loss of University housing.
The student is currently en
rolled at Stanford.
Another example occurred last
spring quarter when a student was
arrested for stealing $60,000 in
computers from the Stanford
Bookstore — the largest heist in
the store's history.
The student was convicted of
felony and grand theft and sen
tenced to nine months in the
Santa Clara County Jail. He is
currently on a work furlough pro
gram, working in the day and re
turning to the jail at night.
Cole could not say if the student
had been charged with a Standard
violation. Nonetheless, because
the information is already public,
Cole could tell The Daily that the
student, a senior, did not receive
a degree last June. Students that
receive suspensions can not
receive their degree until the
suspension is over.
Cole also stated, "There is a
precedent for viewing thefts from
the Bookstore as violations of the
Fundamental Standard." Prior to
this case, no precedent existed for
a crime of that scope.
