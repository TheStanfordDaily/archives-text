# Cartoonists talk politics, humor

The cartoon depicts a bookstore called B. Chicken.
The caption reads, "We no longer stock The Satanic
Verses; we're just stocking Vanna Speaks."
This was the first slide presented in an hour-long
question-and-answer session with three award
winning political cartoonists: Jack Ohman of The
Oregonian, Scott Willis of The San Jose Mercury
News and Tom Meyer of The San Francisco
Chronicle.
The cartoonists kept the audience of about 40
students laughing as they shot quick-witted re
sponses to questions about symbolism and political
implications in their cartoons.
When asked whether dark characters represent
hell and light ones represent heaven, Meyer
responded sarcastically saying, "That's definetly
what goes through my mind."
The cartoonists added, however,
that humor was insufficient with
out political overtones in their
work.
"My first goal is to (get across)
the point I want to make; then I
[think up] a humorous metaphor
that would stick in people's minds
and make the idea more
palatable," Meyer said.
"A caricature has to be dead-on
for people to appreciate it," Oh
man said. However, none of the
three cartoonists had a back
ground in art or found that they
needed one.
The cartoonists said they gen
erally drew with air brushes, cre
ating a rough cartoon about the
size it would be in the newspaper,
and then they drew a final draft
which was slightly larger so that
it could be reduced without a loss
in quality.
When asked about the
cartoonist-editor relationship, the
three agreed that editors gave
them a fair amount of leeway.
However, Ohman noted that
editors tend to use single panel
cartoons more often than multi
paneled ones.
According to Ohman, the re
sponse to the cartoons can often
be surprising. The politicians
depicted and ridiculed would often
call to ask for the originals. Oh
man said that if he liked the per
son, he would give it to him,
otherwise he would sell it.
