Intermission
Invites Daily staffers to our quarterly "Off the record with Don" party next Tuesday, May 2 at 12 noon in the Daily
offices. Come talk to our fearless (and featherless) leader about the issues that concern you, like the prospect of starting
a nudist theme house on campus.
Come see the"artistic" (see Andrew's column) photos that Kathy wouldn't let us run.
