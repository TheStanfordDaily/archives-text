# Axe Committee: new fee request
## 
### Amy Rosenfeld Editorial staff 
Although their special fee re
quest was axed by the student
body in last week's election, the
Stanford Axe Committee will pe
tition the ASSU Senate tonight
to have its revised request placed
on next week's runoff ballot.
The new fee request is $20,000,
pared down from its original total
of $34,000.
According to committee chair
Pat Broun and senate chair David
Porter, the committee members
have to complete the same process
as required to appear on the
original ballot. They must collect
signatures of 10 percent of the
student body — about 1,500 stu

to the senate.
Members of the committee
started collecting signatures yes
terday morning and have until
this afternoon to reach their goal,
said senior Tom Smegal, former
chair and a member of the com

"It'll be tough to get them so
quickly, but I think we'll make
it," Smegal said.
After the petition is complete,

the senate appropriations commit

fee request and then at least 12
members of the senate must ap
prove it.
Porter said the senate would
pose no problem if the committee
can get enough signatures. "I'm
sure the senate will say, 'We'll
give you another chance,' " he
said.
Porter added that resubmitting
a fee request for a runoff is not
unprecedented. In the early '80s,
a number of groups took similar
action, according to Porter. "We
rarely do it, only because of time
constraints."
The Axe Committee has made
some mistakes in the past which
might have harmed their image,
Broun said. For example, students
have not been able to see the Axe
for several years because its dis
play case in Tresidder Union has
been broken, he said.
Porter said voters probably
thought the Axe Committee had
"gotten a little bit too big for its
britches," sponsoring basketball
and baseball events not related to
