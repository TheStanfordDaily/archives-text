# Axe Committee: new fee request
## 
### Amy Rosenfeld Editorial staff 
Although their special fee re
quest was axed by the student
body in last week's election, the
Stanford Axe Committee will pe
tition the ASSU Senate tonight
to have its revised request placed
on next week's runoff ballot.
The new fee request is $20,000,
pared down from its original total
of $34,000.
According to committee chair
Pat Broun and senate chair David
Porter, the committee members
have to complete the same process
as required to appear on the
original ballot. They must collect
signatures of 10 percent of the
student body — about 1,500 stu
dents — and submit the petition
to the senate.
Members of the committee
started collecting signatures yes
terday morning and have until
this afternoon to reach their goal,
said senior Tom Smegal, former
chair and a member of the com
mittee.
"It'll be tough to get them so
quickly, but I think we'll make
it," Smegal said.
After the petition is complete,

the senate appropriations commit
tee must first approve the new
fee request and then at least 12
members of the senate must ap
prove it.
Porter said the senate would
pose no problem if the committee
can get enough signatures. "I'm
sure the senate will say, 'We'll
give you another chance,' " he
said.
Porter added that resubmitting
a fee request for a runoff is not
unprecedented. In the early '80s,
a number of groups took similar
action, according to Porter. "We
rarely do it, only because of time
constraints."
The Axe Committee has made
some mistakes in the past which
might have harmed their image,
Broun said. For example, students
have not been able to see the Axe
for several years because its dis
play case in Tresidder Union has
been broken, he said.
Porter said voters probably
thought the Axe Committee had
"gotten a little bit too big for its
britches," sponsoring basketball
and baseball events not related to
Big Game Weekend, the tradi
tional domain of the committee.
However, both Broun and
Smegal said they do not think
students understood exactly what
the Axe Committee stood for
when they voted last week and
did not realize that by voting
against the committee, they were
voting against the bonfire and Big
Game Bash.
To clear up confusion, Broun
said he will officially change the
name of the committee to the
Stanford Axe/Big Game Bonfire
Committee and hopes that name
will appear on the new ballot.
"The first [loss] was a nuyor
setback," Broun said. "If this
doesn't get passed it is definitely
going to hurt." He said the com
mittee will be forced to turn to
alumni and corporate support and
possibly seek money from the ath
letic department if it doesn't get
its fee request.
However, Broun and Smegal
both agreed that the request will
probably pass both the senate and

student body. "I would think that
the senate wants a bonfire. I think
everyone wants a bonfire,"
Smegal said.
Porter said the prospect of not
having a bonfire or Big Game
Bash next year will certainly help
the committee win its fee request.
To reduce their fee request by
$14,000 the committee eliminated
most of its operating costs, the
Freshman Handbook and plans
for activities at sports events be
sides football games, Broun said.
The committee "cut basically
everything back to the bare
bones," Broun said. The only
events the committee will be able
to stage next year are the bonfire
and Big Game Bash, he said.
If the proposal passes in the
senate but doesn't get approved
by the students in next week's
election, "then we obviously have
to read that as the student body
doesn't want to have a bonfire
and a Big Game Bash," Broun
said. He added in that case there
was little reason for the Axe Com
mittee to seek funding from out
side sources.
"But I don't think that will hap
pen," he added.
