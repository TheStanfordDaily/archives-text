Strong track records in public
service paid off for sophomores
Andrew Kassoy and Christopher
Kersey. From a pool of 1,400 uni
versity sophomores, the two Stan
ford students were recently
selected Truman scholars.
As a memorial to the 33rd pres
ident, Harry S. Truman Scholar
ships are authorized by Congress
and go to students demonstrating
outstanding leadership potential
who plan to enter government
careers.
The scholarship is more than
just an honor; it comes with sub
stantial financial backing as well.
The sophomores will receive
$7,000 annually for their two
final undergraduate years and for
their first two years of graduate
study.
In the past, Stanford students
have been especially successful in
capturing the award. Seventeen of
19 sophomores nominated by the

University in the
last nine years
have all been win
ners. This is the
sixth-straight
year that two
Stanford students
have won.
Beginning his
public service
work early, Kas-

soy spent a summer doing volun
teer work at age 14 for former
Sen. Gary Hart. Since then, he
has continued work in the political
arena.
During his summers, Kassoy
has worked hard for politicians
from Colorado, his homestate.
The summer following his
freshman year at Stanford, Kas
soy's volunteer work turned into
a full-time paid position as an as
sistant director for fundraising for
a Colorado congressman.
Kassoy's chief interests are
foreign policy, arms control and
the military. Writing his Truman
application on the Strategic De-

fense Initiative,
Kassoy has also
done research on
sea-launched
cruise missiles for
the Center of In
ternational Secu
rity and Arms
Control on
campus.
His domestic

interests include welfare, poverty
and race relations.
With his interests focusing in
on the medical side of public
policy, Kersey, a human biology
mEyor, hopes to work as an epider
miologist, advising Congress on
pending public health legislation.
Washington D C. agencies "can
really have a huge influence af
fecting change in society and
dealing with contemporary medi
cal issues," said Kersey, a native
of South Carolina.
While in high school, Kersey in
terned with the South Carolina
House of Representatives.
