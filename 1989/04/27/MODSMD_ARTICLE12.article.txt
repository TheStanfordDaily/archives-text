## Missouri abortion case goes before the Supreme Court 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Abor
tion opponents led by the Bush
administration urged the Su
preme Court in a long-awaited
courtroom showdown yesterday to
overturn its landmark 1973 ruling
that women have a constitutional
right to end their pregnancies.
Outside, police arrested 27
abortion-rights activists, among a
noisy crowd of people demonstrat
ing on both sides of one of the
the nation's most divisive issues.
Those arrested were charged with
crossing a police line.
In sharp contrast, the hour-long
argument session took place in a
packed but hushed courtroom.
"The United States asks this
court to reconsider and overrule
its decision in Roe vs. Wade," said
Harvard law professor Charles
Fried, referring to the ruling that
legalized abortion.
But Frank Susman, a St. Louis
lawyer representing those who
successfully challenged an
abortion-limiting Missouri law in
lower courts, argued, "There can
be no ordered liberty for women
without control over their ...
childbearing."
Missouri Attorney General

William Webster urged the court
to restore the state's abortion reg
ulations even if it does not reverse
the broader 1973 decision, which
was based on women's privacy
rights.
Fried, a former Justice Depart
ment official called back to gov
ernment duty for Wednesday's
session, argued, "We are not ask
ing the court to unravel the fabric
of ... privacy rights which this
court has woven. We are asking
the court to pull this one string."
Susman responded, "It has al
ways been my personal experience
that when I pull a thread my
sleeve falls off. There is no stop
ping. It is not a thread he is after."
Questioning by the justices was
brisk but not as aggressive as it
has been in many argument ses
sions of recent years.
Seven of the nine court mem
bers probed the positions of the
three lawyers in front of them.
Only Justices Thurgood Marshall,
a strong supporter of abortion
rights, and Harry A. Blackmun,
author of the 1973 decision, re
mained silent.
The justices, who do not neces
sarily have to reconsider Roe vs.

Wade in resolving the Missouri
dispute, gave little indication as
to how broad their decision will
be. They are expected to announce
their ruling by July.
At one point, Justice Antonin
Scalia — a potential "swing vote"
along with Justices Sandra Day
O'Connor and Anthony M. Ken
nedy — asked whether the court
must consider the nature of a
fetus.
"Can you derive (a fundamental
right to abortion) without making
a determination as to whether the
fetus is human life or not?" Scalia
asked.
"It is very hard to say ... it
must be a fundamental right un
less you make a determination
that the organism that is
destroyed is not a human life,"
Scalia suggested.
In an attempt to sway the jus
tices, Americans in record num
bers have been writing and telep
honing the court to express their
views. Tens of thousands of letters
arrive each day, and the court's
two switchboards were so flooded
with calls that a rarely used third
board had to be activated.
