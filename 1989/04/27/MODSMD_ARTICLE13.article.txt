### 
JERUSALEM (AP) — Israeli soldiers
reportedly shot and killed three Palestin
ians and wounded at least 63 during a
general strike yesterday in the occupied
lands, and masked attackers killed an
Arab accused of collaborating with Israel.
Also yesterday, more than 80 Palestin
ian leaders in the occupied lands rejected
a government proposal for elections
leading to an interim peace plan. The
leaders, many of them pro-PLO, said the
--- ■ „ t« jd LO
to the media, to end the (Palestinian)
uprising and to win time."
They said only an international peace
conference with PLO participation can
solve the Middle East conflict. Their
signed statement was the first formal
response by local Palestinians to

Shamir's proposal.
In another development, the leaders of
five major Christian denominations in
Jerusalem denounced Israel's crackdown
on the uprising, protesting what they
described as "excessive use of force" and
the "unprovoked harrassment" of Pales
tinians.
The joint statement marked the shar
pest criticism of Israel by Christian
leaders since the December 1987 start of
.lie uprising. It was signed by the heads
of the Greek Orthodox, Roman Catholic,
Armenian, Syrian and Anglican churches.
Yesterday's violence occurred mostly in
the Gaza Strip, a stronghold of the Is
lamic fundamentalist group Hamas,
which called the strike on the anniversary
of the capture of Mecca in Saudi Arabia

by the Prophet Mohammed in 630.
The widespread clashes apparently
were sparked by the death of Sharif
Khatib, 16, who was killed by troops dur
ing a confrontation in Gaza City's Sabra
neighborhood, Arab reports said. The
army confirmed that Khatib was killed
by army gunfire.
About 300 Sabra residents — some
waving outlawed Palestinian flags and
chanting "God is great!" — carried
Khatib's body through the streets.
Troops fired live ammunition to disperse
the funeral march, wounding at least 13
Palestinians, Arab reports said.
The violence spread, and 17-year-old
Ammal Mohammed Hussein was fatally
shot in the head by troops in the nearby
Shati refugee camp.

An army official confirmed the death
but said the circumstances were under
investigation.
At least 45 other Palestinians, most of
them teen-agers, were shot and wounded
in stone-throwing clashes with troops in
Gaza. They included a 2-year-old girl
from Gaza City who was seriously injured
by a plastic bullet in the head.
In the West Bank, 8-year-old Issam
Omar Aniss was fatally shot in the chest
when soldiers opened fire on stone
throwers on the Tulkarem refugee camp,
Arab hospital officials said. At least five
Palestinians were wounded in West Bank
clashes, including a 9-year-old boy from
Tulkarem camp who was reported in cri
tical condition with a plastic bullet in
the eye.

An army official confirmed 10 wounded
in the occupied lands and said he was
investigating the report of the Tulkarem
death. He noted that in two cases bodies
were taken by relatives for quick burial
before army investigators arrived. The
army usually lags hours behind
in confirming casualties.
Masked assailants carrying automatic
rifles gunned down the alleged col
laborator, Fayek Erar, at his home in
the northern West Bank village of Ras
Atiya, Arab reporters said. The 40-year
old property dealer became the sixth vic
tim in a week apparently targeted for
cooperating with Israel.
The army confirmed the death and
said police were investigating.
