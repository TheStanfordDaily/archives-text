LOS ANGELES (AP) - Lucille
Ball, the daffy comedian whose
harebrained schemes drove her
television family crazy but
delighted viewers for four
decades, died yesterday of a rup
tured abdominal artery. She was
77.
The actress, star of the im
mensely popular "I Love Lucy"
and related situation comedies
seen in more than 80 countries,
had undergone major heart sur
gery April 18.
She had been recovering steadi
ly, getting out of bed and joking
with the staff, but shortly before
dawn yesterday, she went into car
diac arrest due to internal bleed
ing and could not be revived, said
Cedars-Sinai Medical Center
spokesman Ronald Wise.
She suffered a complete heart

failure at 5 a.m. and 47 minutes
of resuscitation efforts proved
fruitless, Wise said. "There was
nothing to indicate this would
happen," Wise said. "The heart
itself apparently was not involved
in Miss Ball's sudden death."
In the six-hour surgery at
Cedars-Sinai, doctors replaced her
aorta and aortic valve. Although
the replaced portion of Ball's
aorta did not apparently fail, the
entire artery was in poor condition
when she was operated upon, said
Dr. Robert Kass.
Kass, who performed the oper
ation, said at the time the tearing
in Ball's aorta "progressed all the
way down into her abdomen."
Ball, with her fire-engine red
hair and siren wail, was consid
ered the queen of situation com
edy and a pioneer of the sitcom

format.
"I and 100 million others will
miss her," said comedian George
Burns. "But we haven't lost
Lucille Ball because she's still
with us on television and we can
see her on and on."
"Lucille Ball possessed the gift
of laughter. But she also embodied
an even greater treasure — the
gift of love," President Bush said
in a statement. "She appealed to
the gentler impulses of the human
spirit. She was not merely an
actress or comedienne. She was
Lucy and she was loved."
"Her red hair, her antics on the
screen, her timing and her zest
for life made her an American
institution," former President and
Nancy Reagan said in a statement.
"Just the mention of her name
brings a smile "
