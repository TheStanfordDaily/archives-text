GNP tops five trillion dollar mark
WASHINGTON (AP) — The government re
ported yesterday the U.S. economy topped the
$5 trillion mark for the first time last quarter,
powered by a strong 5.5 percent growth rate that
caused some analysts to express concern about
rising inflation.
Even discounting for a statistical bounceback
from the 1988 drought, a mjyor factor in the
overall increase, the gross national product grew
at a solid 3 percent annual rate during the
January-March period, the Commerce Depart
ment reported.
The stock market's response was inconclusive,
with stock values drifting in a narrow range.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials edged
up 2.20 to 2,3889.11.
J. Antonio Villamil, chief economist for the
Commerce Department, said the economy's per
formance in the first quarter "appears to be

consistent with moderate, sustainable growth for
the balance of the year" and contains no threat
of a recession.
Gorbachev lists nation's problems
MOSCOW (AP) — Mikhail Gorbachev said in
a speech released yesterday that shortages of
housing, food and consumer goods are growing
despite his reforms. He blamed runaway govern
ment spending and Soviets who "forgot how to
work."
In one of his frankest admissions of the Soviet
Union's problems, he said citizens vented their
anger March 26, when at least three dozen senior
Communist Party candidates were defeated in
parliamentary elections.
Gorbachev said perestroika — the program he
launched four years ago to overhaul Soviet eco
nomy and society — remains the proper course,
but reforms are not being put into effect properly,
particularly at the local level.
