## Senior to seniors 
### 
Students deserve to
have a voice at their
own commencement

A STUDENT VOICE at
Commencement could fill
in a "missing element" dur
ing the June 18th ceremony and
signal the beginning of an en
lightening Stanford tradition.
While impressive keynote
speakers like George Shultz and
Robert Maynard can woo parents
and students alike, a student
speaker lends insight to those
most affected by Commencement
— the graduates themselves.
Seniors want to hear someone
who can look back on the past
years in the same way that the
rest of the class can. And that is
something that no big-name
speaker can do.
This fresh suggestion — made
public this week — already has
the support of student leaders.
The Council of Presidents and
the Senior Class Presidents have
endorsed the idea. Now it's onto
the administration.
Today the COP is scheduled to
meet with University President
Donald Kennedy to discuss the
suggestion.
Pending Kennedy's OK, the
Senior Class Presidents need to
get right down to business and
figure out the most viable method
for choosing the speaker among
several who will likely express in

terest.
Two seniors, who came up with
the Commencment idea while
having frozen yogurt (quite the
Stanford way), have suggested
leaving the decision up to a class
vote.
But if seniors go with this se
lection process, the class might
end up with a speaker whose
name is known — but whose
speaking ability is not. To ensure
that the senior speaker is some
one who is both popular among
classmates and can deliver an ef
fective message, the selection
process merits some more
thought and detail:
• Starting next week, inter
ested seniors could nominate
themselves or be nominated by
friends.
• With a list of nominees, mem
bers of the senior class could then
vote for their favorites in May
when they all go to pick up their
caps and gowns.
• The top three vote-getters
would then go before the Senior
Class Presidents and deliver their
speeches.
• Based on best delivery, the
class presidents could vote on who
will address the Commencement
Day audience.
As long as the class presidents
keep in mind that they are
looking for an engaging speaker,
not necessarily one who has ideas
they agree with, then the pro
posal for a student speaker will
work.
