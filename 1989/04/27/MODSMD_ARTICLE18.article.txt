Editorial was not
fair in criticizing
ASSU Elections
The April 25 editorial criticizing the
performance of the Elections Commis
sion during last week's election is not
only unjustifiably harsh, but is fraught
with misconceptions that ignore the
fundamental details of the 1989 Spring
General Elections.
The Daily blames the Elections Com
mission for "the stupid mix-ups and
errors that keep the election going on
forever," when in fact this is simply
untrue. The need for a runoff is
clearly and explicitly defined in the
ASSU Bylaws, Article IV, Section IIB,
2, which state that "if, on the basis of
the preliminary tally, no [COP1 slate
obtained [a msyority of votes castl,
then the Commission shall call for a
run-off election. .
What this by-law says, in short, is
that because no COP slate received
more than 50 percent of the votes cast
in the election, the ASSU must
proceed to hold a run-off, regardless of
the circumstances surrounding the
races for Senior Class President and
SCLC.
Even in discussing the issues sur
rounding the races for Senior Class
President and SCLC, The Daily demon
strates a profound lack of understand
ing, for while it is true that Canetta
Ivy's name should not have appeared
on the ballot, there is no reason why
Leonard Adler, the top vote-getter,
should not have appeared on the bal
lot.
In fact, if the SCLC race appears on
the run-off election ballot, it is likely
that his name will once again appear
as a candidate. Attacking the Elections
Commission, as The Daily does, while
glossing over the valuable, noteworthy
successes of this year's election, is
unforgivable.
Furthermore, The Daily has the gall

to accuse the Elections Commission of
simply "not getting around" to prepar
ing a budget for a run-off election in
time for the subsequent ASSU Senate
meeting, less than 24 hours after the
polls closed on Wednesday night! This
accusation is ridiculous. To suggest
that the Elections Commission, which
worked around the clock for three days
beginning Monday afternoon, should
propose a budget to the Senate in a
half-ass manner before checking and
re-checking the results for accuracy
and consistency is a leap-before-you
look philosophy of carelessness.
But more importantly, and perhaps
pathetically, The Daily's April 25 edito
rial chooses to focus on small mishaps
while ignoring the larger, overall suc
cess of the election. The fact that The
Daily is annoyed by the failure of the
Elections Commission to release a final
"preliminary tally," including a com
plete tally of all on-campus votes,
within 48 hours after the closing of
the polls (the time that would have
been required by the Bylaws to have
held the run-off this week instead of
next week) ignores the point that until
this year even partial results were not
available within 48 hours after the
closing of the polls.
Last year's results did not arrive
until five days after polls closed; two
years ago, the election was run three
times over the course of several weeks;
three years ago, two and a half weeks
were required to produce results. This

year, partial preliminary results were
released at the moment the polls
closed, and 96 percent of the ballots
were tallied within two hours after the
last polls closed.
The editorial also ignores the suc
cessful turnout at the election, in
which over 6,500 people voted (com
pared to a record turnout last year of
5,242 votes), and the overall success of
the first fully-computerized election in
California state history and the largest
in U.S. history. In addition, this year's
election was easily the smoothest-run
election at Stanford in the last decade,
encountering virtually no prob
lems besides those for which the Daily
pronounces the election a flop!
But it is not simply we who main
tain that the election was a categorical
success. Of the more than 5,000 voter
surveys we have received following the
election, the vast majority contain posi
tive feedback.
The Daily can continue to criticize
the Elections Commission, but the real
vote concerning last week's election is
the vote of the public, and the vote is
in: THE DAILY SHOULD "GET ON
THE BALL."

Store overlooked
Jewish students'
needs for Passover
The Jewish holiday of Passover will
end today at sundown. This eight-day
holiday entails a very special diet which
restricts many common foods.
As a junior, I recall being able to
buy matzah at the Store in previous
years. This year it is an embarrassing
oversight that the Store has no items
stocked for Passover, not even matzah,
which is very easy to come by (except
for those of us without transportation
to Safeway).
I hope that in the future the Store's
management pays more attention to
the recurring need for some Kosher
for-Passover stock during this week.

the preliminary tally, no [COP1 slate
obtained [a msyority of votes castl,
then the Commission shall call for a
run-off election. .
What this by-law says, in short, is
that because no COP slate received
more than 50 percent of the votes cast
in the election, the ASSU must
proceed to hold a run-off, regardless of
the circumstances surrounding the
races for Senior Class President and
SCLC.
Even in discussing the issues sur
rounding the races for Senior Class
President and SCLC, The Daily demon
strates a profound lack of understand
ing, for while it is true that Canetta
Ivy's name should not have appeared
on the ballot, there is no reason why
Leonard Adler, the top vote-getter,
should not have appeared on the bal
lot.
In fact, if the SCLC race appears on
the run-off election ballot, it is likely
that his name will once again appear
as a candidate. Attacking the Elections
Commission, as The Daily does, while
glossing over the valuable, noteworthy
successes of this year's election, is
unforgivable.
Furthermore, The Daily has the gall

to accuse the Elections Commission of
simply "not getting around" to prepar
ing a budget for a run-off election in
time for the subsequent ASSU Senate
meeting, less than 24 hours after the
polls closed on Wednesday night! This
accusation is ridiculous. To suggest
that the Elections Commission, which
worked around the clock for three days
beginning Monday afternoon, should
propose a budget to the Senate in a
half-ass manner before checking and
re-checking the results for accuracy
and consistency is a leap-before-you
look philosophy of carelessness.
But more importantly, and perhaps
pathetically, The Daily's April 25 edito
rial chooses to focus on small mishaps
while ignoring the larger, overall suc
cess of the election. The fact that The
Daily is annoyed by the failure of the
Elections Commission to release a final
"preliminary tally," including a com
plete tally of all on-campus votes,
within 48 hours after the closing of
the polls (the time that would have
been required by the Bylaws to have
held the run-off this week instead of
next week) ignores the point that until
this year even partial results were not
available within 48 hours after the
closing of the polls.
Last year's results did not arrive
until five days after polls closed; two
years ago, the election was run three
times over the course of several weeks;
three years ago, two and a half weeks
were required to produce results. This

year, partial preliminary results were
released at the moment the polls
closed, and 96 percent of the ballots
were tallied within two hours after the
last polls closed.
The editorial also ignores the suc
cessful turnout at the election, in
which over 6,500 people voted (com
pared to a record turnout last year of
5,242 votes), and the overall success of
the first fully-computerized election in
California state history and the largest
in U.S. history. In addition, this year's
election was easily the smoothest-run
election at Stanford in the last decade,
encountering virtually no prob
lems besides those for which the Daily
pronounces the election a flop!
But it is not simply we who main
tain that the election was a categorical
success. Of the more than 5,000 voter
surveys we have received following the
election, the vast majority contain posi
tive feedback.
The Daily can continue to criticize
the Elections Commission, but the real
vote concerning last week's election is
the vote of the public, and the vote is
in: THE DAILY SHOULD "GET ON
THE BALL."

Store overlooked
Jewish students'
needs for Passover
The Jewish holiday of Passover will
end today at sundown. This eight-day
holiday entails a very special diet which
restricts many common foods.
As a junior, I recall being able to
buy matzah at the Store in previous
years. This year it is an embarrassing
oversight that the Store has no items
stocked for Passover, not even matzah,
which is very easy to come by (except
for those of us without transportation
to Safeway).
I hope that in the future the Store's
management pays more attention to
the recurring need for some Kosher
for-Passover stock during this week.

Editorial was not
fair in criticizing
ASSU Elections
The April 25 editorial criticizing the
performance of the Elections Commis
sion during last week's election is not
only unjustifiably harsh, but is fraught
with misconceptions that ignore the
fundamental details of the 1989 Spring
General Elections.
The Daily blames the Elections Com
mission for "the stupid mix-ups and
errors that keep the election going on
forever," when in fact this is simply
untrue. The need for a runoff is
clearly and explicitly defined in the
ASSU Bylaws, Article IV, Section IIB,
2, which state that "if, on the basis of
the preliminary tally, no [COP1 slate
obtained [a msyority of votes castl,
then the Commission shall call for a
run-off election. .
What this by-law says, in short, is
that because no COP slate received
