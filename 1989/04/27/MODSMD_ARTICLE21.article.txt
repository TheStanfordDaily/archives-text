## Smarter but no wiser 
### 
IT PUT THE DETAILS in focus, but
it left the big picture blurry
The University Committee on Mi
nority Issues left out of its final report
what it should have been sure to put in:
an analysis of the philosophical tension
that lies at the heart of racial politics on
campus. As a sad result, the report leaves
us smarter, but no wiser.
The spirit of the age has produced two
powerful philosophies about the impor
tance of race, philosophies that vie daily
(and often in The Daily) for preeminence
at Stanford.
One holds that race does not — or
should not — matter. Race is an incidental
characteristic, irrelevant to our common
human purpose. What divides the races
is trivial compared to what unites the
species. What matters is not that one is
black or white, but that one is a human
being.
This philosophy gave the civil rights
movement its moral authority and polit
ical appeal. People who hold this philos
ophy emphasize human unity. As its most
eloquent proponent said: "I have a dream
that my four little children will one day
live in a nation where they will not be
judged by the color of their skin but by
the content of their character."
Another philosophy maintains that
race matters a lot. Because we are prod
ucts of our culture, we are to a large
degree products of our race, especially
insofar as our race has a strong and
distinct cultural implication. Ignoring
race therefore strips us of a powerful
component of our personality.
Indeed, according to this philosophy,
"ignoring" race maximizes the impor

tance of the dominant culture by im
plicitly asking minorities to adopt
majority culture and therefore lose their
own identity. In this vocabulary, "we're
all the same under the skin" gets practi
cally translated "we're all white under
the skin" and therefore rejected.
The first philosophy is individualistic;
its unit of analysis is the individual
human being, and it rejects a person's
minority or msyority status as incidental
and irrelevant to individual expression.
The second philosophy is group-based;
since there is little of "self' beyond cul
ture, personal identity is tied closely to
minority- or msyority-ness.
The UCMI — along, apparently, with
campus minority communities, The Dai
ly's editorial board, and, if public
proclamations are any guide, Stanford's
president — believes in the group-based
philosophy. Racial identification matters
a lot. As the UCMI report says:
"The present [individualistic] philoso
phy misses the prominence of ethnic
groups or ethnic community identity for
minority students. It focuses too exclu
sively on the students as individuals, ex
pressing an atomistic view of pluralism
. . (Emphasis in original.)
The report asserts this philosophy
without weighing the merits of the com
petition. The UCMI declares its position
frequently and eloquently but never
defends it from external criticism. As a
result, critical parts of the UCMI final
report seem written by believers, for
believers.
Indeed, by taking its own, group-based
philosophy as axiomatic, the UCMI
missed an opportunity of tremendous im-

portance. Instead of mediating a powerful
conflict, the report preaches to the con
verted. The imperatives, the recommen
dations, even the context of the report
are predicated on an acceptance of the
idea of group rather than individual iden
tity.
In a way, it's a tomayto vs. tomahto
kind of problem. Longstanding differ
ences of perspective are not going to be
erased by assertion. If I'm of such a
mindset that when the UCMI says "mul
ticultural community" I say "tower of
Babel," then the report is not going to
bring us together; indeed, it doesn't even
try.
The UCMI may be right. But this issue
is too important to be decided by default
in the absence of serious debate. The
practical consequences of this philosophi
cal decision are huge, and we do violence
to a proud legacy if we abandon the view
of people as first and foremost individual
people.
This violence may be justified. It should
not be accidental.

human being, and it rejects a person's
minority or msyority status as incidental
and irrelevant to individual expression.
The second philosophy is group-based;
since there is little of "self' beyond cul
ture, personal identity is tied closely to
minority- or msyority-ness.
The UCMI — along, apparently, with
campus minority communities, The Dai
ly's editorial board, and, if public
proclamations are any guide, Stanford's
president — believes in the group-based
philosophy. Racial identification matters
a lot. As the UCMI report says:
"The present [individualistic] philoso
phy misses the prominence of ethnic
groups or ethnic community identity for
minority students. It focuses too exclu
sively on the students as individuals, ex
pressing an atomistic view of pluralism
. . (Emphasis in original.)
The report asserts this philosophy
without weighing the merits of the com
petition. The UCMI declares its position
frequently and eloquently but never
defends it from external criticism. As a
result, critical parts of the UCMI final
report seem written by believers, for
believers.
Indeed, by taking its own, group-based
philosophy as axiomatic, the UCMI
missed an opportunity of tremendous im-

portance. Instead of mediating a powerful
conflict, the report preaches to the con
verted. The imperatives, the recommen
dations, even the context of the report
are predicated on an acceptance of the
idea of group rather than individual iden
tity.
In a way, it's a tomayto vs. tomahto
kind of problem. Longstanding differ
ences of perspective are not going to be
erased by assertion. If I'm of such a
mindset that when the UCMI says "mul
ticultural community" I say "tower of
Babel," then the report is not going to
bring us together; indeed, it doesn't even
try.
The UCMI may be right. But this issue
is too important to be decided by default
in the absence of serious debate. The
practical consequences of this philosophi
cal decision are huge, and we do violence
to a proud legacy if we abandon the view
of people as first and foremost individual
people.
This violence may be justified. It should
not be accidental.
