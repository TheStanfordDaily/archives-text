## Explosive Bulldogs chew up Card nine pitching 
### Bruce Sarkisian Senior staff writer 
Pity the relief pitchers. Their
job is as tough as any the Byzan
tine game of baseball can come
up with.
With one out in the top of the
fifth and runners on second and
third, Aaron Dorlarque was asked
to put out Fresno State's explo
sive offense. Instead he fanned
the flames, giving up a first-pitch
double to Eddie Zosky that scored
two runs and put the Bulldogs
out of reach of che Cardinal, 4-1.

Baseball
Bulldogs 8, Cardinal 2

The high-pressure job was too
much for the freshman hurler yes
terday, and he gave up four of
the Bulldogs' eight runs in % of
an inning. The 8-1 loss lowered
the Cardinal's record to 21-26 and
improved the No. 13 Bulldogs to
32-16.
"[Stanford Asst. Coach] Scott
Laurence said Dorlarque looked
good in the bullpen, but he looked
tight out there [on the mound],"
Asst. Coach Tom Dunton said
after the loss.
Freshman Steve Worrell (2-3)

took the defeat for the Cardinal,
since he was responsible for the
runners that scored on Zosky's
double.
Even without its pitching woes,
the Cardinal could not muster
much offense against Steve Wolf
(7-1), who threw a complete-game
eight-hitter for the win. Wolf al
lowed only two runs and no extra
base hits.
Things started off promisingly
in the first for Stanford when
Frank Carey lined a single, but
he was picked off first. Steve
Solomon, the next batter, hit a
long fly ball to left-center field
but Tom Goodwin flagged down
the ball and any hopes of an early
Stanford explosion. It was typical
of a day when only two Cardinal
baserunners would get past sec
ond base.
The Bulldogs took a 1-0 first
inning lead on a manufactured
run by Goodwin, who looks like
a bomb ready to explode on the
basepaths. He lined a single to
right, stole second easily, ad
vanced to third on a groundout,
and scored on a wild pitch by
Brian Keyser, the Stanford
starter.
Stanford scored its first run in
the third when Frank Carey sin

gled, went to second on a passed
ball and scored on Paul Carey's
single. The Cardinal added an
other in the seventh when David
McCarty led off with a single, went
to second on Roger Burnett's
groundout, and scored on Eric
DeGraw's single.
The home team's offensive
drought can partially be explained
by home-plate umpire Roy Roth's
unusually large strike zone, which
seemed to favor the outside of the
plate. Cardinal designated hitter
Tim Griffin struck out looking an
uncharacteristic three times in
the game.
But Stanford also benefited
from Roth's generosity towards
pitchers, especially Scott Weiss,
who pitched a perfect eighth and
ninth inning, recording three
strikeouts.
"I think Weiss' curve ball fooled
(Roth) a little bit," Dunton said.
Card note
Stanford's Troy Paulsen is suffer
ing from an inexplicably obtained in
flamed right knee and was evaluated
by a doctor yesterday. Starting pitcher
Mike Mussina will not pitch this
weekend against Arizona and is listed
as week-to-week for the rest of the
season.
