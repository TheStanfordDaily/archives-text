With the Cardinal trailing 2-1
in yesterday's game against na
tionally ranked Fresno State — a
game it desperately needed to win
— freshman Steve Worrell was in
trouble on the mound.
Junior Mark Carper, sopho
more Scott Weiss and freshman
Aaron Dorlarque were all avail
able to enter the ballgaine.
With Carper and Weiss waiting
for the call, Dorlarque — who has
allowed almost two hits for every
inning pitched this season — en
tered the game. He had surren
dered 56 hits in 32 innings before
yesterday's game.
Dorlarque's first pitch was a
double to left for two Fresno runs.
Before his outing was over, he
had pitched to seven batters who
combined for three doubles, one
three-run homer and a single. All
of a sudden, a tight game was a
rout.
Senior Brian Keyser pitched the
first three innings, permitting one
unearned run on three hits. As
is the mid-week custom — Stan-
ford likes to use several pitchers
in non-conference games so
they're fresh for the weekend —
Keyser was pulled and Worrell
came on. Worrell gave up three
hits and three runs.
"Sometimes it works, some
times it doesn't," junior right
fielder Paul Carey said.
"Keyser pitched three outstand
ing innings. You have to second
guess that maybe you leave him
in there for the game, but we're
looking to save him for the week
end against Arizona, for the Six-
Pac, that's more important."
"We wanted to get them all in
there. We had the first two, and
after that ... that was about the
way we had it set up. It looks bad
because [Dorlarque] didn't get out
of it and we had the two freshmen
back to back," Cardinal pitching
Coach Tom Dunton said.
"The thinking was that we
could finish up with some of the
older guys to nail it down. We
didn't get there."
