Before the NBA'a second season
begins tonight, let's take a moment
to reflect on the most intriguing
regular season in recent memory.
Biggest surprise: Mitch Richmond of
Golden State. He is the shoe-in rookie of
the year, yet nobody expected him to hit
with such a big splash.
A future NBA starter? Sure. Maybe
even a starter by season's end. But not
the 16th best scorer in the league. His
average of 22 points per game indicates
a quality seen in few NBA frosh: consis
tency.
Richmond has done it night in and
night out. Case in point: Richmond scored
at least 20 points in each of the the
Warriors' three games against the Jazz
this year. Don Nelson's hoping that con
tinues in Utah tonight.
Biggest surprise to everyone else: The
Phoenix Suns' Kevin Johnson. Johnson
is an NBA "star" by anyone's criteria.

Only league-leader John Stockton of
Utah and the Lakers' Magic Johnson
were better than "KJ" at handing out
assists. And Johnson still found time to
average 20.4 points a game. He's also in
the top 10 in free-throw percentage (.882),
and of those 10 only Magic had more
attempts.
We in the Bay Area weren't surprised

to see KJ hit the big time this year.
Stanford fans watched him run circles
around the Cardinal while Berkeley faith
ful relished it.
There still is one thing that we don't
understand: Why didn't Cal coach Lou
Campanelli ever let Johnson loose? Were
it not for the ball and chain Johnson
carried around the court, the Bears may
have had an NCAA tourney bid or two
with KJ.
Best acquisition: Some will say Mark
Aguirre, who transferred to the NBA's
Detroit office just in time to win a title.
True, the Pistons found somebody who
handles Adrian Dantley's role better than
Dantley.
Dantley's job was to provide offense in
Detriot's half-court set. Aguirre does
that, and even a chubby Aguirre is faster
than Dantley. Besides, with long-time
buddy Isiah Thomas running the fast
break, Aguirre has added incentive to get

the lead out and fill a wing.
Nonetheless, the best acquisition was
Tom Chambers of Phoenix. The Suns
were without a legitimate NBA scorer at
the forward position. Young Armon Gil
liam could be counted on for a 20-point
night every now and then, but not with
any regularity. And Larry Nance was per
forming his high-wire act for the
Cleveland Cavaliers.
So the Suns got Chambers, a perennial
20-ppg player while in Seattle. Chambers
will get his points — whether everyone
around him stays happy is an altogether
different question. There have been few
waves in the desert this season, but the
jury will be out for a few years before
that query is answered.
Best departure: Tom Chambers. The
Seattle Supersonics had three super
scorers and three super egos while Cham
bers was there. Xavier McDaniel, Dale

Kllis and Chambers all averaged over 20
points a game.
In a situation like that, something has
to give. Heck, there's only one ball. Even
Magic couldn't keep all three happy every
night. So the Sonics got smart, dumped
Chambers and barely skipped a step.
Comeback Player of the Year and Dec
ade: Chris Mullin of Golden State. Period.
He has come back from alcohol rehabilita
tion to put the NBA on its ear. Mullin
finished fifth in scoring (26.5 ppg) and
fifth in free throw percentage (.892). His
passing is often stunning, as his unselfish
play at St. John's promised it would be.
And his jumper — never as consistent
as expected prior to this season — is
money in the bank. He is the backbone
of a Golden State team that went from
20 wins last year to 43 this year. All that
while adjusting to a switch from guard
to forward. Most impressive.

tion to put the NBA on its ear. Mullin
finished fifth in scoring (26.5 ppg) and
fifth in free throw percentage (.892). His
passing is often stunning, as his unselfish
play at St. John's promised it would be.
And his jumper — never as consistent
as expected prior to this season — is
money in the bank. He is the backbone
of a Golden State team that went from
20 wins last year to 43 this year. All that
while adjusting to a switch from guard
to forward. Most impressive.
