# Women's tennis starts Pac-10s
## 
### Mark Rogowsky Editorial staff 
The best women's tennis team in the country is
going to finally get a chance to play for themselves
this weekend. And they're probably going to do
pretty well, thank you.
Stanford has five players among the top-seven
seeds at the Pacific 10 Conference Championships
in Ojai, Calif. — including defending champion Lisa
Green — which begin today and continue through
Sunday.
Other Cardinal representatives include Tami
Whitlinger, the nation's top-ranked player; Sandra
Birch, currently No. 3; Debbie Graham, undefeated
in dual-match play and ranked 10th; and, last but
not least, Teri Whitlinger, who is ranked one spot
behind Graham.
For her own part, Green comes in with a national
ranking of No. 5. Any one of them could walk away
with the individual title.
About the only safe prediction is that the Anson
S. Thacher trophy — given to the school with the
most wins in the four-day event — will be brought
back to the Farm.
An examination of the bracket suggests that Stan
ford may once again place three players in the
semifinals, as they did last year.
There are two potential all-Cardinal confronta
tions that could determine which Stanford players
make it that far: Birch vs. Teri Whitlinger and
Green vs. Graham.

Tami Whitlinger's road to the final four appears
to be easier than that of her teammates. In addition
to avoiding any and all Stanford players, Whit
linger's only top-notch foe is California's Lisa Al
bano. That potential matchup would occur in the
quarterfinals.
Tami Whitlinger will meet Arizona's Banni Red
hair in the first round. Whitlinger dusted Redhair
6-1, 6-2 in March.
Graham meets another Arizona player, Danielle
Scott, in her opening match. In their first meeting,
Graham beat Scott soundly, 6-3, 6-1.
Green has Arizona's Betsy Somerville. (No, this
isn't a Wildcats-Cardinal dual-meet. Honest.) Some
rville fell 6-1, 6-3 to Green in March.
Teri Whitlinger drew USC's Ginny Purdy. In Sun
day's Stanford-USC match, Purdy appeared to be
thoroughly outclassed by Whitlinger in dropping a
7-5, 6-0 decision.
Birch meets UCLA's Alysia May. Those two met
at the National Team Indoors in March and Birch
came out on top by a 6-4, 7-5 margin.
In the doubles, the Whitlinger twins are the top
seed. They drew the California tandem of Albano
and Alissa Finerman.
Graham and Birch will face UCLA's Iwalani
McCalla and Kirsten Dryer in their opening-round
match.
Unlike the singles draw, an all-Stanford final is
impossible in the doubles competition since both
pairs are in the same half of the draw.
Nevertheless, both teams are among the favorites
to capture the title.
