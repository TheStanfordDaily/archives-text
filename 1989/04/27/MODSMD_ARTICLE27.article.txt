# Volleyball plays pre-Final Four
## 
### John Kirks Staff writer 
As they head south, their
heads are held high.
The Stanford men's volleyball
team, despite swallowing some
of the worst luck to hit Stanford
athletics since The Play, has dug
in for postseason play. The
squad will take on Southern
California in the first round of
the NCAA's regional playoffs
tonight at 6 p.m.
The team has managed to
maintain as healthy an attitude
as anyone could expect in light
of the heartbreaking loss in the
Great Western Intercollegiate
Volleyball Association Coin
Toss.
Senior Dave Johnson did what
he could to prepare his team
for the loss before it happened,
saying "We're in the regional
until we hear otherwise."
Unfortunately, the team
never did "hear otherwise," and

tonight, the team begins its
journey along the back road to
the NCAA Final Four. On the
other hand, UCLA, the winner
of the toss, will take Easy Street
to the promised land, having
pocketed an automatic bid in
the Final Four.
Stanford finds itself thrown
into a pre-Final Four Final Four
that is particularly brutal. Stan
ford's first-round opponent,
USC, is the defending national
champion and is intent on
defending that crown.
Most recently, the Trojans
pushed the Bruins in Pauley Pa
vilion before succumbing in
three games. Indeed, they seem
to be playing well and are cer
tainly capable of beating
anybody.
In the other bracket, UC-
Santa Barbara plays Hawaii.
UCSB is a team that, like Stan
ford, swept UCLA in three
games; their ability to play op
ponents tough is obvious. And

then there is Hawaii, which has
been involved in a little
postseason controversy of its
own.
Carlos Briceno, the team's
hard-nosed middle blocker, has
been declared ineligible for
reasons unknown to the Stan
ford coaches and will play no
more matches with his team
mates.
But, because Hawaii played
its last eight WIVA games with
Briceno on the floor, the team
was rumored to have been dis
missed from postseason play.
Nevertheless, the Rainbow-
Warriors will be a very real pres
ence in the regional. Stanford
coach Fred Sturm agreed that
Hawaii would still be a for
midable opponent. "I think they
are one of four teams that could
win the National Champion
ship," Sturm said.
The other three were USC
and then, of course, Stanford
and UCLA.
