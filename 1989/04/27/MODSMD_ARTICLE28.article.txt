# Netters try for individual honors
## 
### Cameron Macky Senior staff writer 
Stanford's Jeff Tarango has a
few scores to settle this weekend
at the Pacific 10 Conference Ten
nis Championships in Ojai, Calif.
The Championships, which run
today through Sunday, are strictly
an individual tournament. UCLA
has already wrapped up the con
ference team title with a 9-1
league record.
Tarango, who has a 12-5 dual
match record and is ranked sixth
in the country, reached the finals
of both the singles and doubles
draws of last year's champion
ships, but finished as the runner
up in both categories.
This year, Tarango once again
has a good shot at making the
finals. Since his loss to Califor
nia's Woody Hunt, who is ranked
15th, Tarango has won six
matches in a row, including a 4-6,
6-3, 6-2 over UCLA's Buff Farrow
last weekend.
Farrow, ranked seventh, is half

of the Bruin combination that will
battle Tarango for the singles
title. Brian Garrow, who won last
year's championship match with
a 6-2, 6-3 pasting of Tarango, is
ranked fifth. Garrow beat
Tarango 6-2, 6-2 in their only
meeting of 1989, three weeks ago
in Los Angeles.
In the doubles bracket, Garrow
and Pat Galbraith, the 1988
NCAA Champions, are the
favorites. The Bruin duo, cur
rently ranked No. 1, are followed
by Cal's second-ranked pair of
Hunt and Ted Scherman, The
Bear pair is the only team to
defeat Garrow and Galbraith this
season.
The best doubles team in the
Pac-10, however, may not even be
in Ojai. Tarango and Alex O'Brien
defeated Hunt and Scherman in
straight sets two weeks ago, and
were leading Garrow and
Galbraith 6-2, 3-3 when their
match was canceled last weekend.
Tarango and O'Brien won't get
a shot at the title because

O'Brien's right shoulder is still
causing him trouble when he
serves. The Cardinal freshman
didn't even make the trip to Ojai.
Taking O'Brien's place will be
junior Eric Peus, who hasn't
played with Tarango yet this
season. If history is any indica
tion, though, that won't be much
of a problem.
Last year, Barry Richards
teamed with Tarango at the Pac
10'b for the first time all year.
The pair made it to the finals
anyway.
The rest of the Cardinal con
tingent is Jeff Cathrall, Martin
Blackman, Glenn Solomon and
Barry Richards in singles, and
Cathrall and Blackman in the
doubles bracket.
Senior Curtis Dunn will play in
the open invitational bracket
leach school may only enter five
players in the Pac-10 singles
draw), while Richards and Dan
Turbow will most likely play in
the open division of the doubles
draw.
