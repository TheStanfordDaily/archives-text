# Dean establishes task force to examine TA program
## 
### Suzanne Corkins 
Prompted by ASSU surveys last quar
ter documenting student frustrations
with the University's teaching assistant
program, Dean of Humanities and
Sciences Ewart Thomas has launched an
effort to revamp the ailing system.
Thomas decided last July to freeze the
portion of the Humanities and Sciences
budget which funds TA salaries, but, as
he stated in an interview last night, "I
am not going to institute a freeze this
year."
Predicting a hike in TA funding next
year, Thomas said, "Any increases in the

budget I'm going to pass on to the TA
budget. It's just not worth the misun
derstanding [the budget freeze] caused
last fall."
However, Thomas does not view in
creased funding as the only solution to
the problem. "Tne main objective is more
personalized instruction," Thomas ex
plained. "I don't believe that pouring
money blindly into the system will
achieve any demonstrable benefits."
Rather than simply allocate more
money, Thomas has also set up a new
five-person committee charged with the
specific task of investigating the TA prob
lem and recommending reforms.

The new committee will look into ways
to reallocate resources within the depart
ments, creating a more effective system,
Thomas said.
Committee members include Thomas,
Dean of Undergraduate Studies Thomas
Wasow, one faculty representative, one
graduate student and two undergradu
ates.
Problems with the TA system were
identified early this year by an ASSU
survey of undergraduates and TAs. Sur
vey results indicated that both groups
felt the average size of TA discussion
sections is too large, detracting from the
intended benefits of such sections.

The survey, conducted by the ASSU's
Committee on Democracy in Education,
was sparked by a fall quarter meeting
between Thomas and CODE. During that
quarter, Thomas explained the reasons
for the budget freeze to the committee
but could not ofTer an increase in TA
funding.
The survey results, which were pre
sented to Thomas last quarter, "really
had an impact on him," according to COP
member David Brown, a member of
CODE who will serve on the task force
created by Thomas.
AnotheV CODE member, Katherine
Van Uum, said Thomas' decision to set

up a special subcommittee was a big step
forward for fixing up the program.
Last summer, when the 1988-89 Hu
manities and Sciences budget was
decided, Thomas requested $3.3 million
for the TA budget, exactly the amount
that Humanities and Sciences had spent
the preceding year on the program.
Thomas received only $2.9 million from
the University budget, but he reallocated
the additional $400,000 from other areas
of the budget to compensate for the cut.
"Keeping the budget the same last year
was effectively a cut" considering the im
pact of inflation, Thomas said.
