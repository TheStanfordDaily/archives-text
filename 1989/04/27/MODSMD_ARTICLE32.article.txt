Marvelous mime
One evening on "Late Night with David Letterman" last
year, Letterman announced that he was pleased to welcome
the Swiss mime-mask group Mummenschanz to their New
York studios. As the audience roared its approval, three
figures dressed as a giant hot dog, a giant fork and a
giant knife took the stage and began prancing about to
German march music.
It was an elaborate put-on, but one that accurately cap
tures most people's perception of Mummenschanz, the
incredible "mime" tno who will be performing tonight at
8 p.m. at the Flint Center in Cupertino, courtesy of The
Lively Arts at Stanford.
Since their beginning in 1969, Mummenschanz has
delighted audiences worldwide with their Marcel Marceau
Meets Godzilla playfullness. Whether portraying amoebes,
robots or creatures with toilet paper for eyes, the tno takes
mime to new levels. Tonight's show is a sort of retrospective
or their career, including old and new works. Tickets
are still available at the Tresidder Ticket Office, and this
one really should not be missed. To get to the Flint Center
in Cupertino take Interstate 280 south to Stevens Creek Blvd.
Lenoriffic
Go see Jay Leno.
We'll give you two reasons. First, he's funny and you'll
have a good time. The guy can simply do stand-up comedy,
and he's not even raunchy in the process. Second, the
more bodies there are at Frost on Sunday, the more we'll
be able to prove that Stanford is capable of supporting
big name acts without a major promoter.
The Concert Network has landed some biggies this year,
and by showing good attendance at these shows we have
put ourselves on the verge of landing even bigger biggies.
U2 plays Mem Aud! Well, maybe not, but you get the picture.
So break out the Dontos and sunscreen and head on
over to Frost on Sunday for a dosage of humor.
Tickets are $12.50 for students, ($15.50 others) which is
probably less than you'll ever pay to see Leno live again.
So check out Jay Leno on Sunday. Tickets are available
at Tresidder through Saturday, and will be available at the
door before the show.
