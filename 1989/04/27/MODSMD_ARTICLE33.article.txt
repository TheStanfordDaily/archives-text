# 'A Chorus Line' SCORES!
## 
### Mia Manzulli Staff writer 
It is a difficult task to find 17
performers equal to the demanding
roles in Michael Bennet's Tony
award winning "A Chorus Line."
But Ram's Head succeeded not
only in casting, but in directing
and producing the hit show. This
very impressive production of "A
Chorus Line" tops all other Ram's
Head musicals performed in the
past few years.
"A Chorus Line" captures the
intensity of a Broadway audition
by allowing the dancers to reveal
their secrets, frustrations and
dreams to the director — and to
the audience. It is an intimate
show which goes beyond dancing
and singing to touch on the larger
issues of growing up, homo
sexuality and fear — personal top
ics that are expressed well in a
theater atmosphere but that didn't
translate well in the film version.

The show starts off strong with
a very upbeat song, "I Hope I Get
It"the —the prayer of the auditioning
dancers. The lyrics are audible, due
in part to a pit chorus which helps
out on group numbers. After
watching all the auditioners dance,
Zach, the director (junior Steve
Tannen), picks his 17 finalists.
Once on the line, the dancers
are asked to tell the director some
thing about themselves — he al
ready knows they can dance, but
wants to know more. One by one
they reveal themselves as very dif
ferent individuals through dance,
song or monologue.
For the most part, the dancers
are young and constantly referred
to as "boys and girls" by Zach.
Sheila, played by senior Jill Pixley
"is going to be 30. Real soon." Her
comments are sarcastic and witty
and she asks Zach, "Do you need
any women?" Well, Zach hasn't
decided, so he grills them all.
Senior Katie Genshlea displays

a lot of verve (and nerve) in her
solo number "Dance: Ten; Looks:
Three," more commonly known
as "Tits and Ass," as she regales
her fellow dancers with her tales
of plastic surgery. And Mark Patlan
does a wonderfully funny job
opening up about the time he
realized he was a homosexual.
The most memorable song of
the play, "What I Did For Love,"
is the crucial examination of the
feelings dancers have when they
can no longer dance. Senior Julie
Padilla, as Diana, sings this num
ber in her very sweet and powerful
voice in one of the show's most
touching scenes.
The show's most intense mo
ment occurs when Paul (junior Mi
chael Leonard) breaks down while
telling Zach about his experiences
in a drag show. The powerful scene
really allows Leonard to show off

his acting ability. Although the
monologue is slow at times, it pro
vides a necessary counter to the
generally more light-hearted nature
of the play.
Fortunately, the acoustics and
the lighting are right on target, add
ing to the success of the show,
rather than detracting from it. The
minor backdrop and the special
lighting effects create the perfect
'70s look and the mood of that

decade is carried out musically by
the orchestra, conducted by
Timothy Gallagher.
"A Chorus Line" winds down to
its finale and then jumps back full
of energy with a glitzy rendition
of "One!" (Editor's note: Not the
Metallica song.) The lights, cos
tumes and an art deco setting add
to the dazzling, up beat and
splashy ending that is perfectly
choreographed and danced in
synch.

"A Chorus Line" plays tonight
through Saturday at 8 p.m. in
Memorial Auditorium.
