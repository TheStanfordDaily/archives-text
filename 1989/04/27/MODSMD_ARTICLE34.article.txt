# Revealed at last — the naked truth behind art classes
## 
### 
I would like to state up front that this
week's column will have no silly gim
micks. There will be no parodies of TV
shows or books; not once will I make up
imaginary biblical references or funny
translations to foreign phrases; I will
refrain, even, from hurling gratuitous in
sults at familiar campus groups. No, this
column will have no gimmicks.
Unless, of course, you count the fact
that I'm writing today's column com
pletely in the nude.
That's right, I'm naked. Unclad and
generally clothesless. In the buff, if you
will. Not even a strategically placed fig
leaf to stand between me and my Mac
intosh. And I'm doing this, you see, be
cause I believe it will better help me to
understand art.
When it comes to art, I, like billions of
other men worldwide, lack that critical
gene which allows people to understand
it. Women tend to have this gene, which
explains why most men arc perceived as
being insensitive clods.
For instance, at a recent art exhibit my
girlfriend and I came across a painting of
a bowl of fruit.
"Do you know what that painting rep
resents?" my girlfriend asked
I gambled. "Fruit?"
"No," she said, "the rendition of the

objects in space passionately represents
the struggle between love and understand
ing in the human experience. You insensi
tive clod."
[I really am naked — my butt is sticking
to the chair. The things I do in the name
of journalism. ...]
So I decided to take action — I enrolled
in an art class. Art 40, "Basic Drawing
For The Casual Student Who Isn't Quite
Sure Which End Of The Pencil To Use."
As soon as the class started it became
apparent that there were three levels of
talent:
(1) Those who understood art, and
whose drawings looked like the things they
were supposed to represent. (Women.)
(2) Those who did not understand art,
and whose drawings looked like Rorschach
tests. (Men.)
(3) Those who were regularly attacked
by the easel, and whose drawings looked
like a rhinocerous had squatted over the
paper and relieved itself. (Me.)
For the first half of the quarter things
went swimmingly. Every day the teacher
would come in and set up a few bottles
and fruit, and every day we'd draw these
bottles and fruit. It went on like this for
some time. Bottles and fruit. Bottles and
fruit. Bottles and fruit. Pretty soon I
started having dreams about bottles and

fruit.
During this initial learning period, the
teacher would wander around the class
and offer suggestions or words of encour
agement, such as "TYy showing more con
trast between the bottles," or "Try feeding
the rhino a higher fiber diet."
Just to make the class more difficult
we were drawing with charcoal. This
meant that besides having to try to draw
accurately, I also had to be careful not to
accidently start a barbecue.
(Here's the nude part! I'm not making
this up.]
And then, one day, we started drawing
naked people. This was quite a surprise
— the teacher had announced the previous
day that we would begin drawing "the
nude," but "the nude" is a very abstract
term, sort of like "the Z particle."
So on this day we were sitting in class,
charcoal and lignter fluid in hand, waiting
for some bottles and fruit, when all of a
sudden this guy slinks into the middle of
the classroom, whips off his bathrobe, and
proceeds to be a "nude "
I completely expected the class to
scream.
"There's a naked person in the room,"
I said to the girl next to me.
"Shhh!!" she said, "you'll disturb the
nude."

Only he didn't look like a "nude." He
looked like a very naked person. And he
sat there and continued to be naked for
two hours. And everyone drew pictures of
him. And nobody seemed the slightest bit
put off by the fact that there was a naked
person in the room.
And so began my career as a pornog
rapher.
As the quarter wore on we drew more
naked people. Male naked people, female
naked people. Fat naked people, thin naked
people. A naked Santa Claus. A naked Sid

Vicious. Sometimes they would talk to us.
"Nice drawing," they would say.
"Thank you," we would say, "nice
penis."
There appeared to be two different
drawing strategies. My strategy was "draw
real fast." I could complete a drawing in
10 minutes flat. Most of my nudes looked
like stick figures.
"Very primitive," said the teacher. I
added a spear and a wooly mammoth.
The other drawing strategy was "draw
real slow." My friend, who I'll call "Mia"
('cause that's her name), drew this way.
For one female nude she used a two-hour
drawing period to complete exactly one
nipple.
"Very primitive," I said to her. She slapped
me.
It went on like this for the rest of the
quarter. Naked people would come into
class. I would draw stick figures; "Mia"
would draw nipples; the rhinocerous
would try to goose the models.
Having been an artist now for an entire
quarter, I still don't understand art. But
having written my column in the nude,
at least I understand what it's like to be
art.
If only I could figure out how to be
bowl of fruit. . .

looked like a very naked person. And he
sat there and continued to be naked for
two hours. And everyone drew pictures of
him. And nobody seemed the slightest bit
put off by the fact that there was a naked
person in the room.
And so began my career as a pornog
rapher.
As the quarter wore on we drew more
naked people. Male naked people, female
naked people. Fat naked people, thin naked
people. A naked Santa Claus. A naked Sid

Vicious. Sometimes they would talk to us.
"Nice drawing," they would say.
"Thank you," we would say, "nice
penis."
There appeared to be two different
drawing strategies. My strategy was "draw
real fast." I could complete a drawing in
10 minutes flat. Most of my nudes looked
like stick figures.
"Very primitive," said the teacher. I
added a spear and a wooly mammoth.
The other drawing strategy was "draw
real slow." My friend, who I'll call "Mia"
('cause that's her name), drew this way.
For one female nude she used a two-hour
drawing period to complete exactly one
nipple.
"Very primitive," I said to her. She slapped
me.
It went on like this for the rest of the
quarter. Naked people would come into
class. I would draw stick figures; "Mia"
would draw nipples; the rhinocerous
would try to goose the models.
Having been an artist now for an entire
quarter, I still don't understand art. But
having written my column in the nude,
at least I understand what it's like to be
art.
If only I could figure out how to be
bowl of fruit. . .

I would like to state up front that this
week's column will have no silly gim
micks. There will be no parodies of TV
shows or books; not once will I make up
imaginary biblical references or funny
translations to foreign phrases; I will
refrain, even, from hurling gratuitous in
sults at familiar campus groups. No, this
column will have no gimmicks.
Unless, of course, you count the fact
that I'm writing today's column com
pletely in the nude.
That's right, I'm naked. Unclad and
generally clothesless. In the buff, if you
will. Not even a strategically placed fig
leaf to stand between me and my Mac
intosh. And I'm doing this, you see, be
cause I believe it will better help me to
understand art.
When it comes to art, I, like billions of
other men worldwide, lack that critical
gene which allows people to understand
it. Women tend to have this gene, which
explains why most men arc perceived as
being insensitive clods.
For instance, at a recent art exhibit my
girlfriend and I came across a painting of
a bowl of fruit.
"Do you know what that painting rep
resents?" my girlfriend asked
I gambled. "Fruit?"
"No," she said, "the rendition of the

objects in space passionately represents
the struggle between love and understand
ing in the human experience. You insensi
tive clod."
[I really am naked — my butt is sticking
to the chair. The things I do in the name
of journalism. ...]
So I decided to take action — I enrolled
in an art class. Art 40, "Basic Drawing
For The Casual Student Who Isn't Quite
Sure Which End Of The Pencil To Use."
As soon as the class started it became
apparent that there were three levels of
talent:
(1) Those who understood art, and
whose drawings looked like the things they
were supposed to represent. (Women.)
(2) Those who did not understand art,
and whose drawings looked like Rorschach
tests. (Men.)
(3) Those who were regularly attacked
by the easel, and whose drawings looked
like a rhinocerous had squatted over the
paper and relieved itself. (Me.)
For the first half of the quarter things
went swimmingly. Every day the teacher
would come in and set up a few bottles
and fruit, and every day we'd draw these
bottles and fruit. It went on like this for
some time. Bottles and fruit. Bottles and
fruit. Bottles and fruit. Pretty soon I
started having dreams about bottles and

fruit.
During this initial learning period, the
teacher would wander around the class
and offer suggestions or words of encour
agement, such as "TYy showing more con
trast between the bottles," or "Try feeding
the rhino a higher fiber diet."
Just to make the class more difficult
we were drawing with charcoal. This
meant that besides having to try to draw
accurately, I also had to be careful not to
accidently start a barbecue.
(Here's the nude part! I'm not making
this up.]
And then, one day, we started drawing
naked people. This was quite a surprise
— the teacher had announced the previous
day that we would begin drawing "the
nude," but "the nude" is a very abstract
term, sort of like "the Z particle."
So on this day we were sitting in class,
charcoal and lignter fluid in hand, waiting
for some bottles and fruit, when all of a
sudden this guy slinks into the middle of
the classroom, whips off his bathrobe, and
proceeds to be a "nude "
I completely expected the class to
scream.
"There's a naked person in the room,"
I said to the girl next to me.
"Shhh!!" she said, "you'll disturb the
nude."

Only he didn't look like a "nude." He
looked like a very naked person. And he
sat there and continued to be naked for
two hours. And everyone drew pictures of
him. And nobody seemed the slightest bit
