# Tetherless 'Heathers' never weathers
## 
### Mark Tompkins Editorial staff 
"Heathers" is a pitch-black com
edy about teenagers which operates
on the principle that the nastier
something gets, the funnier it gets.
It's set in Sherwood, Ohio, but
really could take place anywhere.
All high schools and shopping
malls look the same on the inside.
This particular high school is
dominated by the "Heathers,"
three self-professed "megabitches,"
all named Heather. They're snobby
and insensitive beyond belief: one
of them dismisses an African
famine relief project by whining,
"God, aren't they fed yet?" You
can imagine what they make of
the various geeks and fatties they
have to deal with in the cafeteria.
The fourth member of this all
powerful social clique is Veronica
(Winona Ryder), who's just a little
too smart and perceptive to feel
really comfortable with the Hea
thers. Unfortunately, Veronica
doesn't have anywhere else to go,
socially — everyone else seems to
be either stupid or boring.
So it's no surprise that Veronica
should be attracted to the new kid,
J. D. (Christian Slater). For J.D.,
black is the color and one is the
number: he's a smirking outsider
who tells Veronica, "I find that the
extreme always makes an impres
sion." They become a couple al
most instantly, and they visit the
head Heather one morning with
the intention of giving her a
phelgm glob in her hangover cure,
or so Veronica thinks. J.D.'s idea
of a prank is a bit more extreme:
he poisons Heather.
Naturally, Veronica realizes the
seriousness of what's happened:
"Now I'll have to send my SAT
scores to San Quentin instead of
Stanford," she moans. But J.D.
stages things so that it looks like
Heather killed herself, a trick
which kicks the movie into satiric

'Now I'll have to
send my SAT
scores to San
Quentin instead of
Stanford'

high gear. Heather's "suicide" turns
the high school into a media
circus.
While the TV cameras are on,
Heather is ennobled in death by
the kids who despised her in life,
school officials mouth platitudes
and the school psychiatrist reigns
supreme with her touchy-feely
psychobabble. Veronica is ap
palled; J.D. just laughs and says,
"Society always nods at whatever
horrors American teenagers can
come up with." He wants to stage
more "suicides," and gets Veronica
to help him.
At times the black humor in
"Heathers" is reminiscent of
1987's "River's Edge," but this
movie goes much, much farther.
From the opening scene, when one
Heather tells someone off by say
ing, "Oh, fuck me gently with a
chain saw," we get the idea that
this isn't going to be your typical
teen comedy. Some group of bliss
ninnies or other will probably be
outraged that a movie could dare
mock teen suicide, but these same
people will completely miss the
multiple layers of irony in Daniel
Waters' script.
A newcomer to screenwriting,
Waters has written a movie which
is genuinely shocking. It's also
hilarious, in the most in-your-face
way imaginable. His teens speak
a zingy slang, a convenience store
speak of clipped phrases and ab
breviated words. The cast delivers
these lines perfectly — there's not
a bad performance in the movie.

Waters and first-time director
Michael Lehmann (who shot the
film beautifully, adding to its
weirdness) find humor everywhere.
The movie gets darker and more
bizarre toward the end, and for a
minute it looks like Waters and

Lehmann are going to blow it with
a sappy confession from J.D. and
a hokey ending. But they don't.
"Heathers" is not to be missed —
people will love it or loathe it like
no other movie. The extreme really
does make an impression.

Waters has written a movie which
is genuinely shocking. It's also
hilarious, in the most in-your-face
way imaginable. His teens speak
a zingy slang, a convenience store
speak of clipped phrases and ab
breviated words. The cast delivers
these lines perfectly — there's not
a bad performance in the movie.

Waters and first-time director
Michael Lehmann (who shot the
film beautifully, adding to its
weirdness) find humor everywhere.
The movie gets darker and more
bizarre toward the end, and for a
minute it looks like Waters and

Lehmann are going to blow it with
a sappy confession from J.D. and
a hokey ending. But they don't.
"Heathers" is not to be missed —
people will love it or loathe it like
no other movie. The extreme really
does make an impression.

Winona Ryder stars as the scheming Veronica Sawyer in the terrific
new "Heathers."
