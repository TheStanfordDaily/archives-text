# An old fashioned American divorce

### Sharon Gwyn 
"See You in the Morning" is
one of the most enjoyable and
realistic films I've seen this year.
Alan Pakula produced and wrote
the script which focuses on an
experience many American
families are going through today
â€” divorce and remarriage.
Jeff Bridges gives a wonderful
performance as Larry Living
ston, a New York psychiatrist
who, a year after divorcing his
famous fashion model wife, Jo
(Farrah Fawcett), marries a pho
tographer named Beth Good
win, played by South African
actress Aiice Krige. Most of the
movie looks at Larry and Beth's
marriage and the difficulties
that they and their children, by
the previous marriages, go
through in adapting to their new
life.
One of the movie's strongest
points is its ability to inter
mingle the past with the pres
ent. For example, when Larry's
ex-mother-in-law (Frances
Sternhagen), dies, he returns
back home to his first family
for the funeral. The movie
shows how past feelings are
hard to escape when Larry's old
feelings for his ex-wife appear
to resurface. You'll have to go
and see the movie to find out
if anything actually happened
between Jo and Larry, but I will
say it was an eventful weekend.

The movie demonstrates that
people cannot completely es
cape their past; however, they
can put it in perspective and go
on to live happy productive
lives. Larry and Beth help each
other grow in ways their previ
ous marriages did not. For ex
ample, Beth used to put her first
husband's career before hers.
However, seeing her about to
repeat the same pattern in their
marriage, Larry tells her,
"You're 36 years old. Don't you
think its time you did some
thing for yourself?"
It would be unfair not to note
the strong performances given
by the child actors in this
movie. E.T.'s girlfriend, Drew
Barrymore, gave an exceptional
performance as Betli's daughter
Cathy, who is getting over the
suicide of her father while also
learning to live with a step
father.
Plus, hats off to the other
child actors Lukas Haas (Peetey
Goodwin), Heather Lilly (Robin
Livingston) and Macaulay
Culkin (Billy Livingston). All
gave believable performances as
children going through the ef
fects of divorce and remarriage.
"See You in the Morning"
covers several difficult topics,
with sensitivity and and a touch
of humor. This romantic com
edy is well worth the trip to
Century 10. If you haven't seen
it, see it.
