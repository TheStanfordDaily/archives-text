# Savoyards entertain with Iolanthe
## 
### Martha Brockenbrough Staff writer 
Some laws were meant to be
broken.
But, as the Peers and Fairies of
Gilbert and Sullivan's "lolanthe"
discover, some of them only need
a little rewriting.
True to Gilbert and Sullivan
form, the plot of "lolanthe" — the
latest production of the Savoyards
— "trips hither and thither" down
a rocky path until the legal adjust
ment can be made.
Set in a verdant clearing
hemmed by a river, Act One opens
with a band of Fairies rejoicing the
pardon of their favorite, lolanthe,
who was punished for marrying a
human — the Lord Chancellor.
Although Fairy law stipulates
that interspecies marriage is
punishable by death, lolanthe's life
is spared because she leaves her
husband soon after their union.
She doesn't leave him soon
enough, though. Soon after their
separation, she gives birth secretly
to Strephen, their half-Fairy son.
By the time of his mother's par
don, Strephen, a 25-year old Ar
cadian shepherd, has fallen in love
with Phyllis, a beautiful shepherd
girl.
But because Phyllis is under age
— and because she has captivated
the Lord Chancellor — he denies
Strephen's request to be allowed
to marry her.
Eventually Strephen and Phyllis
persuade lolanthe to beg the Chan
cellor for his consent. Once the
Chancellor sees lolanthe, he relin
quishes his claim on the girl.
lolanthe and the Chancellor's
reunion is just as illegal as their
initial marriage. But, as hormones
would have it, all of the Fairies
have paired off with various Peers
as well.

So, to prevent the annihilation
of all Fairykind, the Chancellor
helps the Queen redraft the law
so that any Fairy who did not
marry a human would die.
In general, the performance by
the Savoyards is entertaining. De

spite sometimes conservative and
uninspired staging, and the rather
imprecise and overly loud or
chestral accompaniment, the
talented cast carries the show
pretty well, making "lolanthe"
worth seeing.


The Fairy Queen turns Private Willis Into Tlnkerbell In "lolanthe,"
which plays this weekend In Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
