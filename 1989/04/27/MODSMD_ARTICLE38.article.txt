# 'Say Anything' says something

When you put writer/director Cameron Crowe
("Fast Times At Ridgemont High") and actor John
Cusack ("The Sure Thing") together, you'd figure
that the result — "Say Anything" — would be aiming
for a high school audience.
Well, it's been a few years since "Fast Times" and
"The Sure Thing" came out, and "Say Anything" is
probably for those of us who were in those high
school crowds. It combines the usual humor of teen
flicks with a heavy dose of seriousness. As a result,
it reflects the coming of age of Crowe, Cusack, the
characters and the audience.
The movie opens with Lloyd (Cusack) deciding to
ask Diane Cort (lone Skye) out on a date. Lloyd's
graduation, a familiar entrance into adulthood in
these films, occurs later that day. The graduation
scene is all comedy, including one student's original
rendition of "The Greatest Love of All."

From the beginning, there are signs that this is
not just another teenage farce. For example, loan
Cusack (John's real sister) plays Lloyd's sister, a
mother whose husband ran out on her; and Diane's
father (John Mahoney) spends most of the movie
being investigated by the IRS. The movie feels schiz
ophrenic, switching between drama and punchlines.
It is carefully done, however, and the jokes that are
thrown in are timed well enough that we don't lose
a sense of what comes before.
It would be a mistake to see "Say Anything" (or
not see it, for that matter) expecting a movie where
you get to see John Cusack be a funny person. True,
he is funny here, but he proves that he can be more.
Lloyd is probably the most vulnerable character that
Cusack has played, and this comes out in the sen
sitivity of the film.
The movie succeeds at being more than a romantic
comedy (a genre that has been worn out in the past
couple of years).
