The latest film from British di
rector Michael Caton-Jones shows
that British politicians like to do
to beautiful women what Ameri

America for years
Though ini
tially given an 'X'
rating for some
thing of an orgy
scene, "Scandal"
is not a movie
about sex. Rather,
it takes a somber
look at the subtle

relationship between two of the
principle participants in the
Profumo Affair, a sex scandal
which shook, and eventually
toppled, the Conservative British
government in the early '60s.
"Scandal" begins in 1959 when
17-year-old showgirl Christine
Keeler (Joanne Whalley-Kilmer),
meets Stephen Ward (John Hurt),
a doctor who socializes with the
upper-crust in British high society.

Of his social circle, Ward explains
to Keeler, "You must be very clever
or very beautiful" to enter it.
Needless to say, Keeler's beauty
assures her of an open door.
Through Ward, Keeler becomes a
young socialite, rubbing shoulders
with members of British high so-

SCANDAL

ciety.
Much to the delight of Ward,
Keeler begins a relationship with
Eugene Ivanov (Jeroen Krabbe), a
Russian naval attache. At the same
time, she has an affair with John
Profumo (lan McKellen), secretary
of state for war. Herein lies the
meat behind the scandal — a Rus
sian and a government official both
sleeping with the same woman.
For some reason, Ward appears

to be more interested in the in
trigues of Keeler's relationships to
the two men than with his own
relationship to her. However, the
basis of their relationship is that
Ward would introduce her to his
world. In doing so, though, their
bond becomes strong but unspo

ken.
After a split
with Ward, Keeler,
in her depression
and confusion,
speaks to the
press about her af
fairs, including
Profumo in her
list. Profumo

denies the allegations at first but
is later forced to resign.
Ward, on the other hand, is
wrongly tried for pimping — Keeler
supposedly being his prostitute. By
the time of the trial, the beautiful
young mistress has become a tired
defeated woman; the only man she
ever loved, ruined.

"Scandal" opens tomorrow at the
Varsity theater in Palo Alto.
