# COP criticizes racism survey
## Issue will be brought up with President Kennedy 
### Rob Burwell Senior staff writer 
On the heels of an in-depth Uni
versity study of campus race re
lations, members of the Council
of Presidents are charging that a
new survey inquiring into "the
nature of racism" at Stanford uses
loaded questions that will yield
prejudiced findings.
COP members will express con
cerns about the survey, sent out
by a Hoover Institution fellow last
week, during a meeting today with
University President Donald Ken

nedy and Provost James Rosse.
The survey, mailed to seniors
by Hoover Senior Fellow John
Bunzel, asks students to define
racism and answer questions on
subjects ranging from affirmative
action to their perceptions of the
extent and causes of racism at
Stanford.
The survey is intended to pro
vide data for a research project,
Bunzel said last quarter.
The COP members decided to
include a discussion of the survey
in their quarterly meeting with
Kennedy and Rosse after several

concerned students phoned the
COP and alerted them to the sur
vey which arrived in mailboxes
yesterday.
"fßunzel] could really use the
results he receives to hurt the
unity students are trying to build
at Stanford," said COP member
Stacey Leyton. "It seemed like the
questions were worded in ways
that would get his expected
answers."
Bunzel was unavailable for
comment and will be out of town


John Bunzel
until next week. Kennedy was also
unavailable, but he will be back
in town in time for today's meet
ing with the COP.
Bunzel is already notorious
among minority groups on
campus because of an article in
the Fall 1985 issue of Stanford
Magazine in which he argued that
ethnic theme houses harmfully
promote separatism.
The survey was designed in part
by Flanders Associates, a private
independent firm in Palo Alto. It
was distributed to a "scientific"
sample of the senior class.
COP member Miguel Marquez
said the survey "really goes back
in time by considering racism in
just black and white terms. The
only mention of Chicanos is in
the back of the survey where it
asks for your ethnic group."
"[The survey] makes whites out
to be the victims of what students
of color are doing," Marquez
added.

Criticizing the survey for asking
questions that "lead you to a con
clusion," Marquez said he found
certain questions especially
"leading."
Marquez questioned what Bun
zel was getting at by including a
question which asks students to
agree or disagree with the follow
ing statement: "The black student
leadership here is made up of
people with their own political
agenda who are devoted to simply
seeing racism."
According to Marquez, a series
of "blacks are ..." hypothetical
statements may have been in
cluded as a way of framing racial
issues on campus in a way that
"(puts) out lines" implying blacks
are inferior.
Another area of concern for
Marquez are the questions that
could "only be answered by
blacks" but are asked of all stu
dents surveyed. For example, Mar
quez pointed to one question that
makes the statement: "There is
pressure here on black students
— from other blacks — to avoid
developing close friendships with
white students."
