# COP criticizes racism survey
## Issue will be brought up with President Kennedy 
### Rob Burwell Senior staff writer 
On the heels of an in-depth Uni
versity study of campus race re
lations, members of the Council
of Presidents are charging that a
new survey inquiring into "the
nature of racism" at Stanford uses
loaded questions that will yield
prejudiced findings.
COP members will express con
cerns about the survey, sent out
by a Hoover Institution fellow last
week, during a meeting today with
University President Donald Ken

nedy and Provost James Rosse.
The survey, mailed to seniors
by Hoover Senior Fellow John
Bunzel, asks students to define
racism and answer questions on
subjects ranging from affirmative
action to their perceptions of the
extent and causes of racism at
Stanford.
The survey is intended to pro
vide data for a research project,
Bunzel said last quarter.
The COP members decided to
include a discussion of the survey
in their quarterly meeting with
Kennedy and Rosse after several

concerned students phoned the
COP and alerted them to the sur
vey which arrived in mailboxes
yesterday.
"f√üunzel] could really use the
results he receives to hurt the
unity students are trying to build
at Stanford," said COP member
Stacey Leyton. "It seemed like the
questions were worded in ways
that would get his expected
answers."
Bunzel was unavailable for
comment and will be out of town
