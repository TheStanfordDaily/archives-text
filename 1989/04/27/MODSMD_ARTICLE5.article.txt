# Fee amendment may be voted on again
## 
### Tim Marklein Editorial staff 
Students will be guaranteed as
much power as the ASSU Senate
in determining general fee in
creases if a revised constitutional
amendment is approved in next
week's runoff elections.
The senate will vote tonight
whether to include the revised
amendment on the ballot next
Wednesday and Thursday.
The amendment provides the
senate with the power to increase
or decrease the general fee by up
to 20 percent. The revised amend
ment guarantees students the
same range of fee alteration, in
stead of the current 10 percent
mandated in the constitution.
Senate chair David Porter said

he was confident the measure will
be approved for the ballot, com
menting that he foresees no op
position from the senate. "As long
as the runoff election is going to
happen, there is no problem with
resubmitting the amendment,"
Porter said. He added that the
revised amendment was submit
ted on previous notice at last
Thursday's senate meeting — in
accordance with the ASSU
Bylaws.
The original amendment failed
in last week's general election gar
nering support from only 48.7
percent of voters. A two-thirds
vote of the student body is needed
for the amendment to pass.
The original amendment ex
panded the senate power to allow
for increases of up to 30 percent,

though students are only
guaranteed a 10 percent change.
Currently, the constitution
mandates that the senate give stu
dents the options of plus or minus
10 percent, as well as no change.
Additional changes can be placed
on the ballot if the senate chooses,
within a range of minus to plus
100 percent.
The senate has included a 20
percent increase or decrease on
ballots in the past two years.
For the past five years, students
have opted for no change, creating
what Porter calls a tight budget
situation — where ASSU Pro
gram Board and Publications
Board draw on reserves, and a
number of student groups are cut
short in their general fee requests.
In those same five years, Porter

said inflation has increased costs
about 25 percent.
"We are facing a drastic decline
in student program funding,
something we have already seen
on the publications side," Porter
said. Program Board reserves
have been cut from about $60,000
to $44,000, but Porter noted that
many student groups still received
about one-tenth of their requests
in the latest Program Board allo
cation period.
"At this rate, we can only fund
about two more years without a
fee increase," Porter said, adding
that the students' reluctance to
vote for increases requires that
the senate be able to change the
general fees, with proper checks
by students.
