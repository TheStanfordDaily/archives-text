# Review funded by private foundation
## 
### Jason Bloomstein Staff writer 
Alternative college newspapers,
including The Stanford Review,
are establishing themselves on
campuses nationwide, in part be
cause of a private foundation ded
icated to help finance publications
that support minority viewpoints.
Based in Washington, D.C., the
Institute for Educational Affairs
aims to "preserve and enhance the
discussion of important ideas on
campuses," according to Leslie
Lenkowsky, the institute's presi
dent. That role includes helping

to finance newspapers, liberal or
conservative, that take a stance
counter to mainstream thought at
a university.
Some campus papers, though,
are cautious of support from, and
association with the institute, be
cause it has been accused of being
overly right-wing and racist.
Several UC-Berkeley professors
have refused to talk with the Cal
ifornia Review because of its ties
with the foundation, according to
an article in Tuesday's San Fran
cisco Chronicle.
Last year the institute contrib

uted $100,000 in direct grants to
30 alternative newspapers in or
der to make them more self
sufficient, Ixmkowsky said. The
Stanford Review received about
$3,000 last year, one fourth of its
operating budget, according to
sophomore Norm Book, the
Review's new editor.
Book said the institute's sup
port has been "a windfall" to the
Review, which received only $500
of its $3,000 request for ASSU
funds for next year, according to
ASSU records.
"It's hard to get support from
student government," he said.
"We've been finding a lot of bias
on campus."
Book said the institute's sup
port has "improved the paper in
many ways," but he hopes that
the Review will be self-sufficient
from advertisements and alumni
contributions next year.
Lenkowsky stressed that the
group does not attempt to influ
ence the editorial positions of the
newspapers, nor does it try to
create such publications on cam
puses where they don't already
exist.
Bill Grace, editor of Dartmouth
College's alternative publication,
said the Dartmouth Review
rejected funding from the insti
tute in part because the paper is
already self-sufficient, but also for
fear that "you lose your credibility
and independence on campus
when you receive money from
foundations."
