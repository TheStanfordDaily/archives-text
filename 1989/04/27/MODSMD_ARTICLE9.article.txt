# Hush up: Why conduct cases don't go public
## 
### John Cuerva Staff writer 
Editor's note: This is the last
in a series examining the histor
ical context and modern-day im
plications of Stanford's Fun
damental Standard.

In the spring of 1985, the Jud
icial Affairs Office investigated 24
students for multiple Honor Code
violations in a psychology class.
Of the 24, only 12 were charged.
In the spring of 1986, Judicial
Affairs investigated two students
who assaulted another student for
a possible Fundamental Standard
violation.
And last spring, Judicial Affairs
investigated one student for a
Standard violation because he
stole $60,000 from the Bookstore.
In all three cases, the outcomes
remained "confidential." They
were kept from the Stanford com
munity because University policy
allows students under a Judicial
Affairs investigation the right to
choose between a public or con
fidential hearing and outcome.
Not surprisingly, nearly all stu
dents opt for confidentiality.
The policy prohibits Judicial Af
fairs Officer Sally Cole from
releasing any information not
already public that might disclose
the identity of those under inves
tigation.
As a result, the Stanford com
munity has been denied access to
178 misconduct cases between
1982 and 1988.
The reasons for confidentiality
are numerous, according to Gen
eral Counsel John Schwartz.
Schwartz said that University
policy does not include discipli
nary records on students' aca
demic transcripts, so that
students are not "saddled" by
their mistakes in the future.
Schwartz argued that if disci
plinary information were made
public, the University could not
deny potential employers or other
institutions or publications access
to a student's record.
Students with a black mark on
their record could suffer the rest
of their lives, Schwartz said.
Another reason to maintain
confidentiality is the possibility
that students under investigation

Fundamental Standard
Students at Stanford are ex
pected to show both within
and without the University
such respect for order,
morality, personal honor
and the rights of others as
is demanded of good cit
izens. Failure to do this will
be sufficient cause for re
moval from the University.

could suffer from the publicity
even if they are found innocent,
according to Schwartz.
Finally, the "University's disci
plinary system is not designed to
duplicate or provide the same
redress as the state criminal law
system," said Schwartz. If a stu
dent commits a crime, then the
police will prosecute and make
public the arrest and trial records.
Despite the University's
reasons for confidentiality, the
system has come under criticism.
Director of University News
Services Bob Beyers argued that
not releasing the names of stu
dents found guilty — not students
being charged — undermines the
University's commitment to
protect "first and foremost the
integrity of academic progress and
information."
Releasing the names would "let
people know there is a risk" in
volved when violating University
policy, said Beyers.
Those students whose names do
go public should be allowed to ad
dress the community: voicing an
explanation or apology, or main
taining their innocence, said
Beyers.
In fact, it wasn't until the pas
sage of The Legislative and Jud
icial Charter of 1968, which
provided legal guidelines for the
Judicial Affairs Office, that stu
dents could even opt for a public
hearing. The choice was permitted
due to pressure by student pro
testers who wanted their trials to
go public.
Schwartz said he found Beyers'
"logic to be incomprehensible. You
don't need to publish the names
