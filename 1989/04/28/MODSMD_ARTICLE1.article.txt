# Senate votes to add three items to ballot
## 
### Baldwin Lee Staff writer 
Three new items will be introduced in the ASSU's
runoff election that did not appear on the original
ballot, the ASSU Senate decided last night.
The original purpose of next week's election was
to hold the runoff races for the Council of presidents
slates, Senior Class presidents slates and Student
Conduct Legislative Council candidates.
The three new ballot items are: a revised Stanford
Axe Committee fee request, a revised constitutional
amendment regarding general fee alterations and a
referendum on abortion.
Students voted down the Axe Committee's original
fee request of $34,000 in last week's general election.
The committee needed 1,500 signatures to present
its revised fee request of $20,000 to the senate last
night. Committee chair Pat Broun told the senate
that about 2,000 signatures had been collected.
The senate voted unanimously to put the fee
request on the ballot. The request needs at least
50 percent approval in next week's election to pass.
The revised constitutional amendment put on bal
lot last night allows both the senate and the student
body to increase or decrease a general fee by up to
20 percent. The amendment needs a two-thirds
majority of next week's vote to pass.
The referendum approved for next week's ballot
asks voters whether they support a woman's right
to abortion as legalized by the Roe v. Wade case.
The landmark 1973 ruling is currently under review
by the Supreme Court in the case of Webster v.
Reproductive Health Services.
The senate also voted to approve a $6,000 budget
for next week's election.
Senators voted not to act on a mistake in last
week's undergraduate senate race in which Brian
Clark, a candidate who had withdrawn from the
race, was left on the ballot. Clark recieved 251 votes
in the general election.
Undergraduate senator Brian Fagel proposed that
the undergraduate senate election be held again
because of the possible effect the votes would have
had if givsn to another candidate.
The motion was overwhelmingly rejected by the
senate — it received only two yes votes — because
senators felt that holding a second election in the
43-candidate race would be too cumbersome for the
ASSU and put an unfair time burden on the senate
candidates.
Senate chair David Porter said that the senate
had ignored minor mistakes in previous senate races
because the races are too difficult to hold again in
their entirety.
