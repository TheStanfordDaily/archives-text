# Cat Network nabs 250 tabbies

### Suzanne Corkins 
A successful collaboration be
tween University officials and
concerned area residents has al
lowed about 250 formerly stray
cats to remain on campus as
officially registered pets.
Approximately half of these
animals were captured by the
Cat Network, a Stanford com
munity group. They worked
along side University contractor
Crane Pest Control.
Crane, which conducted a
seven-week trapping effort that
ended on April 17, delivered 18
of the 250 feral cats to the Santa
Clara Animal Shelter. Once at
the shelter, the cats were held
for 72 hours and, in the worse
case scenario, were put to sleep.
The remaining cats were
voluntarily registered, vac
cinated, tagged and spayed or
neutered by Stanford residents,
many of whom had already been
feeding the strays.

Registration of trapped cats
was facilitated by the Cat Net
work, a group organized by con
cerned residents early this year
when the University first an
nounced that it would take ac
tion against feral cat over
population. Network members
set their own traps one month
before Crane's program began
in order to register as many
adoptable cats as possible.
Crane also reported the inad
vertent capture of 18 possums,
17 skunks, three raccoons and
three birds. All of these were
released by monitors in the area
of the foothills.
The vandalization of the traps
was reported early in the trap
ping campaign and continued to
plague the program for its dura
tion. According to Ron Parker
of University Operations and
Maintenance, two traps were
"completely destroyed," while
20 were damaged and several
cats were anonymously re

leased.
The 250 cats trapped falls far
short of Crane's original esti
mate of the Stanford feral cat
population, originally set at
1000 to 1500 cats. Parker at
tributed this discrepancy to the
large number of kittens born in
the fall, many of which may not
have survived past January.
Although Crane's formal trap
ping program has ended, the
company will continue to pro
vide the traps to campus areas
on an "as needed" basis.
The Cat Network has also
purchased its own traps for in
dividual use.
"There *8 a lot of work that
remains to be done," said Net
work member Carole Miller.
"There may be well-meaning
students out there who are
caring for cats and will have to
leave them to fend for them
selves this summer," she
warned.
