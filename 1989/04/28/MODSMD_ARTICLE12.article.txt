# Animal activists, scientists clash

### Stacy Stern 
Animal rights activists and
biomedical researchers gathered
in Sterling Quad Dining Center
Wednesday night to debate moral
implications and possible alterna
tives to animal research.
The three animal rights ac
tivists represented a wide range
of positions, some moderate and
some more extreme.
Larry Horton, associate vice
president of public affairs, and
several medical researchers de
fended animal research and Stan
ford's role in it.
Lise Giraud, director of the Palo
Alto Humane Society, argued that
animal research necessarily leads
to the widespread exploitation of
helpless creatures.
In answer to Giraud, Dr. Tom
Hamm, director of Lab Animal
Medicine at Stanford, said
biomedical research on animals is
more than a moral question.
Stanford regulates animal re
search even more strictly than
state and federal regulations, he

added. To back up his claim, he
openly invited audience members
to tour laboratory facilities.
One audience member asked
Hamm how he would respond to
being used as a subject in a re
search experiment run by ex
traterrestrials. "I would hope they
would treat me as well as I treat
my lab animals," he responded.
If research is eliminated on
animals, it may necessitate testing
on humans, according to Hamm.
He stressed the necessity of ani
mal research for advancing
modern medicine.
"I am not opposed to animal
research," said Dr. Robert Neger,
a more moderate of the animal
rights activists. "I just want to
get rid of bad research."
A practicing ophthalmologist,
Neger called many animal studies
"useless and repetitive." He cited
his own past involvement in need
less research.
When he did research into the
effects of cosmetics, he had to re
move three monkeys' eyes.
He said he regretted "maiming"

the monkeys for "no reason."
Neger made the distinction be
tween basic research and applied
research. Applied research should
receive funding since it has a
direct impact on humans, he said,
but basic research, which is more
general in its scope, should be dis
continued.
Dr. Charles Nicoll, faculty spon
sor of the Coalition for Animals
and Animal Research at UC-
Berkeley, did not agree with
Neger. He said that since basic
research often expands into ap
plied research, it is acceptable to
use animals.
Nicoll cited the example of re
search into the hibernation pat
tern of squirrels, which has con
tributed significantly to the un
derstanding of seasonal depres
sion in human beings.
Animal research has also pro
vided the medical community
with information on illnesses such
as AIDS, cancer and diabetes, ac
cording to Nicoll.
