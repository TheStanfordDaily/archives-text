## Chinese protest march draws 150,000 
### 
BEIJING (AP) - More than
150,000 students and workers
calling for democracy pushed
through police lines yesterday and
marched cheering and singing
through central Beijing in com
munist China's biggest protest
ever.
Workers by the thousands
joined the students, giving them
popsicles and bread in their
strongest act of support in 11 days
of protests.
Beijing residents escorted the
students on bicycles and foot and
tried to shield them from soldiers
and police, who had issued harsh
warnings against marches.
But the security forces were un
armed, and although they pushed
fiercely against advancing stu
dents in a vain effort to halt their
march, they did not use other
force against them.
There was no immediate infor
mation on any injuries in the
crush.
The march turned instead into
a jubilant procession. For more
than 15 hours, the students
marched through streets and un
der overpasses jammed with thou
sands of applauding people. High
rise dwellers leaned from their
windows to watch, store clerks
stood in their doorways and the
patients of one hospital emerged
in blue-and-white-striped
pfyamas.
The march was the biggest and

most dramatic action yet by
Beijing students in their campaign
for sweeping democratic reforms,
including a free press and an end
to corruption.
In Washington, the State De
partment called for restraint on
the part of Chinese authorities
and hoped the demonstrations
would remain peaceful.
"The United States believes in
and supports the right of peaceful
assembly, including peaceful
protest and the freedom of ex
pression," department spokes
woman Margaret Tutweler said.
Even before the march ended,
the government announced it was
willing to hold talks with the stu
dents "at any time" if the students
return to their campuses and
"adopt a calm and reasonable at
titude."
However, a government spokes
man quoted by the official Xinhua
News Agency said the talks should
be conducted through official stu
dent groups already rejected by
the protesters as non-democratic.
The government calls the protest
ers' newly formed unions illegal.
Xinhua later quoted a city
spokesman as saying many of the
students' demands, such as wiping
out corruption, were "in accord
with the wishes of the party and
the government." The spokesman,
who was not identified, urged the
students to return to class.
