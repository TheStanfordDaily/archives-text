# FDA approves new AIDS drug
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - The
Food and Drug Administration
said yesterday it will allow a po
tentially promising new AIDS
drug to be tested on people infec
ted with the deadly virus.
Researchers say the drug,
known as GLQ223, is unique be
cause it appears to kill only those
immune system cells that are in
fected with the AIDS virus,
leaving non-infected cells alone.
However, they caution that the
drug so far has been tested only
in the laboratory and has not been
used on AIDS patients.
"I'm verv optimistic because of
the test tube results, but there's
always the possibility it could
have unpredictable side effects or
when given to humans the drug
may not be able to get to all the
infected cells," said Dr. Michael
McGrath of the University of Cal
ifornia in San Francisco and San
Francisco General Hospital.
McGrath led a team of scientists
from UCSF, the Chinese Univer

sity of Hong Kong and Genelabs
of Redwood City, Calif., that de
veloped GLQ223.
The drug is a highly purified
form of the plant protein tric
hosanthin, which is derived from
the root of a Chinese cucumber
plant. The plant extract has been
used in China to induce abortions.
In the laboratory, the drug has
been found to work on two dif
ferent types of cells crucial to the
normal functioning of the im
mune system — T-cells and mac
rophage cells, which act as a res
ervoir for the virus.
AZT, the only drug now licensed
for treatment of AIDS, and other
drugs like it only prevent the virus
from replicating in T-cells.
David Corkery, a spokesman for
the American Foundation for
AIDS Research, called the drug
"very promising," and said he is
"cautiously optimistic" about its
prospects.
Genelabs said yesterday the
clinical trials are expected to begin

in May at San Francisco General
Hospital, primarily to determine
safety and human tolerance of the
drug. McGrath said the trials are
expected to last three to six
months.
If a safe dosage can be deter
mined, then trials would be con
ducted on the effectiveness of the
drug.
Genelabs also cautioned that
though GLQ223's active ingredi
ent is found in some Chinese her
bal medicines, "such preparations
may also contain other compo
nents with unknown toxic ef
fects."
Also, the company said that
since the toxicity of trichosanthin
itself has not been evaluated in
AIDS patients, it "cautions
against the use of trichosanthin
or trichosanthin-containing
preparations as an AIDS therapy."
The drug is being developed
with money from the Swiss chemi
cal and pharmaceutical company
Sandoz Ltd.
