Shuttle set for launch today
CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) - Five
astronauts tracked a perfect countdown yesterday
as technicians prepared the shuttle Atlantis for
today's midafternoon launch. The mission will
propel NASA's "Magellan" probe to Venus and
revive America's deep-space science program.
"After an 11-year gap in the planetary program,
we're anxious to get started," said John Ger
pheide, Magellan project manager.
Officials described the countdown as the
smoothest of four since the Challenger disaster.
The chance of high winds provided slight concern
as NASA looked forward to liftoff in an unusually
tight launch window that opens at 2:24 p.m. EDT
and lasts justs 23 minutes.
Magellan, ready for its 15-month flight to
Venus, "is 100 percent healthy and ticking along,"
said Lennard Fisk, NASA's chief scientist. "We're
ready to go fly," said Richard Truly, who heads

the shuttle program and is the incoming NASA
administrator.
Earlier yesterday three Soviet cosmonauts re
turned to Earth, leaving the Mir space station
unattended for the first time in more than two
years. Two of the cosmonauts had been in space
for five months, the other for eight months.
Soviets plan to reduce pollution
STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) â€” The Soviet
Union releases 100 million tons of waste into the
air and water each year, but is working to clean
up its pollution, the leading Soviet environmental
official said Thursday.
Scientists and politicians were debating the
question at meetings in Helsinki, Finland. The
head of the U.N. Environment Program said Wed
nesday that disagreement with the Soviets could
block agreement to phase out chlorofluorocar
bons, which are blamed for depleting the Earth's
ozone layer.
