MANIKGANJ, Bangladesh
(AP) â€” A tornado swept
through central Bangladesh,
killing 600 people and injuring
12,000 others as it flattened
buildings and tossed fishing
boats, government officials said
yesterday. At least 200 people
were missing.
Wednesday evening's storm,
which also unleashed hail and
heavy rain, struck hours after
President Muhammad Ershad
led nationwide prayers for an
end to a drought that has been
tormenting Bangladesh.
Survivors said the funnel
cloud raged for 10 minutes at
dusk Wednesday in the Manik
ganj area 25 miles northwest
of Dhaka, and tore down
"everything, including build
ings."
The twister capsized several
fishing boats, raising fears that
many of the 200 missing may
have been killed.
"I saw black clouds gathering
in the sky. In moments we
found we were flying along
with the house," said Sayeda
Begum, a 30-year-old
housewife in the village of
Saturia, near Manikganj.

The government official, who
spoke on condition of
anonymity, confirmed the toll
of 600 dead. A government doc
tor from the area said at least
12,000 people were injured.
Troops yestreday searched
wrecked villages for survivors.
In Saturia, a village of 10,000
people, nothing was standing
for about one square mile.
Sayeda said she and her hus
band and four children were
lifted through the air by the
storm. Her 5-year-old son was
found two miles away, suffer
ing from bad bruises, she said.
All of them suffered injuries.
In the neighboring village of
Nandeshwari, none of the 120
houses was left standing.
Tofael Ahmed, a teacher,
wept bitterly as he held a torn
shirt that had been worn by
his son, Sonal, hours earlier.
Sonal and his sister, Sufia
Beagum, were among the miss
ing.
"What shall I do with this
shirt? Why Allah should curse
me like this!" he cried.
Another tornado hit Nar
singdi district, about 25 miles
east of Dhaka.
