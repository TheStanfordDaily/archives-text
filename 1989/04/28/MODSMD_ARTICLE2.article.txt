# McFarlane audience avoids issues of Iran
## 
### Jonathan Eisenberg Staff writer 
Although Robert McFarlane
encouraged the audience to
"have at it" with questions
about his involvement in covert
operations in the Iran-Contra
affair, few took him up on the
invitation last night.
Before an audience of about
200, the former national secu
rity adviser was not forced to
digress from his scheduled sub
ject — "the changing distribu
tion of global power" —

because few asked him about
his involvement in the Iran-
Contra affair.
McFarlane responded to a
question about his knowledge
of secret negotiations in Paris
in October 1980 concerning the
sales of arms to Iran with a
prompt denial. He did state,
however, that covert operations
are a small but necessary part
of foreign policy.
Nevertheless, McFarlane
devoted most of his speaking
