# McFarlane audience avoids issues of Iran
## 
### Jonathan Eisenberg Staff writer 
Although Robert McFarlane
encouraged the audience to
"have at it" with questions
about his involvement in covert
operations in the Iran-Contra
affair, few took him up on the
invitation last night.
Before an audience of about
200, the former national secu
rity adviser was not forced to
digress from his scheduled sub
ject — "the changing distribu
tion of global power" —

because few asked him about
his involvement in the Iran-
Contra affair.
McFarlane responded to a
question about his knowledge
of secret negotiations in Paris
in October 1980 concerning the
sales of arms to Iran with a
prompt denial. He did state,
however, that covert operations
are a small but necessary part
of foreign policy.
Nevertheless, McFarlane
devoted most of his speaking

Former national security adviser Robert McFarlane addressed
an audience of about 200 at Annenberg last night.
time to address the profound
changes occurring in the political
and economic power balance
among the United States, the So
viet Union, Japan, China and a
unified Europe from now to the
end of the century.
Now the chair of a group of
international affairs experts, the
former national security adviser
said future national security will
depend not on the avoidance of
conflict, but rather on the ability
to compete succesfully for re
sources. The global market will
be divided among not two but five
superpowers, he said.
McFarlane expressed his hope
that President Bush will have the
vision to focus U.S. foreign policy
on Asian nations, the future
centers of world economy. But he
noted that President Bush "knows
an iconoclastic, rigid ideological
approach to life."
A free trading area will be
forged in the East and a great
wealth of foreign aid can be
"brokered" to needy Asian nations
if the U.S. can use diplomacy to
reconcile Japan with its neigh
bors.
Japan alone will have the eco
nomic power to join the U.S. in
solving regional conflicts, such as
in the Middle East. "Japan should
pay its way," he stressed.
His generation was responsible
for the "ossification of U.S. in
dustry" that let has brought an
end to U.S. hegemony, he said.
Echoing the theme of Bush's
speech in Palo Alto Tuesday,

McFarlane predicted
a 'slow decline ...
into irrelevance' for
the Soviet Union in
terms of global
politics.

McFarlane urged, "We've got to
do a little shaking up" to restore
our ability to compete in world
markets.
McFarlane suggested improving
the U.S. education system by
teaching foreign languages and
geography, necessities for foreign
relations. He also encouraged in
dustry funding of college research
and development projects. "I'm
betting we can do it,"he said.
McFarlane predicted a "slow
decline ... into irrelevance" for
the Soviet Union in terms of
global politics. Although he en
couraged Soviet leader Mikhail
Gorbachev to continue reform
efforts through the policy of
perestroika, McFarlane said the
superpower's enormous and static
bureaucracy will be an "insur
mountable" obstacle to change.
Since economic decision
making will remain centered in
Moscow, the Soviet Union will be
unable to produce enough goods
to sustain either its population or
an imperial ambition beyond its
borders, he said.
In his opinion, the more
cohesive European nations of the
1990s will be so heavily involved
in internal trading that they will
erect broad tariffs against outside
nations and present no threat to
U.S. security.
