BONN, West Germany (AP) —
Chancellor Helmut Kohl, in a
major policy speech today, inten
sified pressure on the United
States to agree to superpower
talks on short-range nuclear
weapons.
Addressing Parliament, Kohl
repeated his call for negotiations
to reduce the number of short
range nuclear rockets in Europe
as well as atomic artillery.
"Because of the range of the
short-range systems, the Federal
Republic of Germany is affected
more by these weapons than the
other partners in the alliance,"
Kohl said.
"It is to me self-evident for our

friends to have the same under
standing for our interests as we
have shown many times for
theirs," he added.
Britain and the United States
have been critical of Kohl's pro
posal for superpower talks on
tactical atomic arms deployed in
Europe. But NATO allies Bel
gium, Norway and Denmark have
indicated their support for Kohl
on the issue.
Many lawmakers applauded
when Foreign Minister Hans-
Dietrich Genscher indirectly crit
icized the United States and Brit
ain for their stand.
"There is much to fear in this
world. But we certainly don't have

to fear negotiations, and we don't
have to fear talks with a Soviet
Union that is ready for negotia
tions," he told Parliament.
Recent polls indicate that three
quarters of the West German pop
ulation favors eliminating all nu
clear weapons in Europe. Most of
NATO's short-range weapons are
based in West Germany.
Kohl reassured the United
States and other NATO partners
that his government does not want
to eliminate those battlefield nu
clear weapons.
"In the current circumstances,
land, sea and airborne short-range
nuclear weapons are still impor
tant in Europe," he said.
