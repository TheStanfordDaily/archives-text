## Costly renovation 
### 
The boathouse is a
well-used resource at Stan
ford, and as such it should
be preserved — but at a reason
able cost.
The $500,000 estimate to
renovate the structure is obscene.
As the home port for sailing,
windsurfing and kayaking
classes, the current Boathouse
gives students from a wide range
of backgrounds the opportunity
to enjoy water sports not avail
able to them elsewhere.
The current boathouse struc
ture consists of housing for two
students, a deck, and a large shed
used for storing kayaks, winsur
fers, etc. We're not talking ac
comodations for Jim and Tammy
Fae Bakker. So why the high
price tag?
If it is determined that the
standing Boathouse cannot be
repaired, the new structure
should either be a structurally

sound replica of the current Boat
house, or a scaled-down version
that would provide a place for
students to store sports equip
ment and maybe a deck — not
Pier 39.
Members of the Lake Commis
sion have mentioned the possibil
ity of adding a restaurant or a
dance floor. That's a little bit ex
cessive. If you must eat, try Tres
idder. If you need somewhere to
throw a party, Elliot Program
Center offers not only a place to
dance, but a view of the lake as
well.
If this project cannot be com
pleted for less than $100,000, it
should not be taken on at all. To
invest $500,000 on a glorified
shed is simply more than the Uni
versity can afford, especially
when it is already facing a deficit
and says it cannot afford to build
new student housing or pay teach
ing assistants the wages they
deserve.
