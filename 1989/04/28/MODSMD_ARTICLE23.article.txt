# Editor's welcome
## 
### 
Remember the scene
in "Risky Business" where
the Tom Cruise character
is entrusted with the care of the
family house and the keys to his
father's Porsche?
Well, first year staffers were
given the reins over the produc
tion of today's Daily.
Sometimes life imitates the
movies.
The first year staffers' issue
traditionally results in a night of
little or no sleep for those whose
arms are twisted into producing
the paper; traditionally non-first
year staffers do all they can to
ensure those with twisted arms
will get little or no sleep.
Last night was no different.

Anyway, as acting editor in
chief, I'm left with the task of
filling the rest of this box and
am rapidly running out of ideas.
Thus, allow me to borrow a
few sentences from the "Editor's
welcome" of the editor in chief
who entrusted me with this po
sition, Kathy Lachenauer:
• A gawky Features editor cor
nered me.
• I was too much of a wimp to
tell him the idea was stupid.
• Flashes of barbeque beef
burgers and eggplant stackup
popped up into mind.
• It worked for me, and I sin
cerely hope you'll think about
giving us a try.
Enjoy the issue.
