## America must respect all languages 
### 
In response to Robyn Bezar's Apriil
24 column, I agree that people in
America have to speak English in
order to be successful and to find a
functioning place in society. However, I
do not believe that English is a supe
rior language, nor that English should
be the official language of America,
nor that Spanish-speaking people are
less capable of being an active part of
society.
Americans who only speak English
refuse to adapt and learn another
language. Therefore, the people who
only speak English and who comprise a
large part of the population, force
those who do not speak English to
change. Although America is the great
"melting pot" for many different cul
tures that speak many different lan
guages, it "melts" into one culture, the
culture that speaks English.
The examples that Bezar used in her
column were totally illogical. She said
there are gangs in East Los Angeles
that do not "read English or under
stand more than a few words impor
tant to their trade." If you are a gang
member, what is your "trade?" A
person doesn't need to speak English
in order to pollute a city with graffiti,
to steal, to kill, or to sell drugs. I
understand the point that Bezar was
trying to make, but her example fell
far from the mark. The point that
these young men are in gangs can be
attributed partly to the fact that they
do not speak English, but I believe the
answer is not that easily explained.
Bezar says that she does not under

stand why a person would want to
remain a janitor instead of learning
"the language primary to their adopted
country." In a country comprised of so
many diverse cultures, races and na
tionalities, there should not be one
primary language. When this country
was "discovered" by Columbus, the
people here did not speak English.
Thus, the primary language should be
that of the Native Americans, since
anyone coming here after them made
America their adopted country.
Bezar then makes a connection be
tween the poverty found in Tyuana
and the fact that the people there do
not speak English. If this is logical and
correct, then why are there people in
the United States who speak English
living in the same kind of abject
poverty that Bezar described? Since
English is not the official nor the pri
mary language of Tyuana, there is no
obvious relation between the people not
speaking English and having to live in
cardboard boxes.
The next disjointed statement Bezar
makes is that because Spanish
speaking people refuse to learn Eng
lish, they are living in a vicious circle.
They are not the only ones living in a
vicious circle. Americans who refuse to
learn a language other than English
are also living in a vicious circle. With
California approaching the 1990s and
on the verge of being a state in which
the majority will be people of color,
particularly Latino Americans, those
who only speak English or Spanish will
be out of sync with the rest of the

ln a country comprised of
so many diverse cultures,
there should not be one
primary language.

bilingual population.
The language barrier in this state
and in this country is not a burden
that should be placed on people who do
not speak English. It is a burden that
should be shared with the rest of soci
ety. The best steps toward a solution
to the growing problem are to stop
emphasizing English and to stop
deprecating other languages. In order
to understand the many different culr
tures and the people that comprise
these cultures, we have to welcome the
people and their languages, and adopt
them into the larger society — not
force them out — because of their
differences. We have to realize that
Spanish and other languages are an
integral part of our society, without
which this country would not be the
"great melting pot."
