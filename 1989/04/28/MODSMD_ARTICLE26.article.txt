SOS not delaying
the installation of
Firetruck sign
The editorial in the April 26 Daily
suggests that this office is reluctant to
install a sign for the Lesbian, Gay,
Bisexual Community Center, a depart
ment of Campus Affairs.
Nothing could be further from the
truth. Indeed, a gifted volunteer from
the Gay and Lesbian Alliance, in con
sultation with the officers of the Cen
ter, has been working with the Plan
ning Office to design a sign. We will
install the sign when it has been built.

X-TV fiasco proves
homophobia still
exists at Stanford
Late on April 25, a friend of mine
who works with X-TV asked if I could
help with the taping of the Lesbian
and Gay Men's Love Links. X-TV
needed some technical help with the
taping because some of their technical
crew resigned after they learned the
theme of this particular edition.
Apparently they didn't think it was
"right." I'm not sure if they don't
think that an edition of Love Links
involving gay men and women would
be right, or if they think homo
sexuality itself is not right.
Regardless, their resignations make
some pretty strong statements.
First, if it's the latter case, it is
amazing that someone could possibly
believe that it is his or her privilege to
judge another person's lifestyle and
sense of self.
If it is the former, then I contend
that there is no difference between a

straight and gay person participating
in a dating game.
Far more relevant, though, is the
statement the X-TV workers' resigna
tions makes about the Stanford com
munity as a whole. In the fall, Peter
Thiel and others complained that an
article by Stuart Reges posted to the
gay computer bulletin board was writ
ten to encourage gay students on
campus to incite homophobia.
Well, gay students cannot incite ho
mophobia, just as they cannot choose
to be homosexual. Homophobia on this
campus is a situation which is already
present and which must be acknowl
edged and addressed.
It is time for the University to
realize that it is homophobic, that
there are homophobes on this campus,
and that Stanford University is not the
bastion of tolerance it so often claims
to be. If it were so, why would I have
to worry whether my writing this let
ter would make my friends and ac
quaintances wonder whether or not I
myself am gay?
The week of May 7 is Gay and Les
bian Awareness Week at Stanford. This
is a perfect time for people to begin to
question how accepting they truly are.
Can you attend one of the sponsored
functions without worrying about what
your friends will think? Will you wear
shorts or pants on May 8? Will you
even care about all this on May 14?

Future leaders need
to appreciate what
science has to offer
Bravo John Chuang on your April
26 column on 'Techie' discrimination.
You've hit on an important concern,
that science, which has had more im
pact on human life than all of the
humanities, is not considered stimulat
ing or pleasurable to those intelligent

students outside it. However, the prob
lem is more than one of social discrim
ination; it has important ramifications
for the future of civilization.
I think most of us enjoy the arts
because we are interested in better
understanding life, and in particular
the human experience. Science is about
understanding life explicitly. How can
an individual have a true concern for
life and not have an interest in sci
ence?
One might argue that science (more
accurately its misuse) has birthed the
worst nightmares of humanity (along

If as a student you are not
interested in science, then
you are also not truly inter
ested in life and its future.

with its benefits). But this is not an
argument for avoiding science; it is the
strongest reason for studying it since
we cannot control what we do not
comprehend.
When we live in a world where our
best students disdain science as boring
specialization, we lose the ability as a
society to develop the kind of under
standing we need to direct our future.
All students, especially those who are
not in technical fields and who may
one day be the decision makers in this
world, should cultivate some scientific
appreciation. The impact of having
leaders who do not understand science
and technology can be fully judged by
the problems we have today in dealing
with out technical failures and manag
ing our scientific success.
It seems obvious to me that if as a
student you are not interested in sci
ence, then you are also not truly inter
ested in life and its future.

If denied a legal
choice, abortions
will become unsafe
Our Government, urged by President
Bush, is trying to bring us back to the
"good old days" when abortion was
outlawed and women were forced to
resort to back-alley abortions if they
had an unwanted pregnancy.
I used to see these women after they
developed serious uterine infections,
and it is not something I want to see
again. The fact is that although abor
tion is not something we encourage or
relish, it is nevertheless something
that women will resort to if their con
traception fails and they become preg
nant against their will.
It is far better to have it remain as
it is now â€” a safe and simple proce
dure done under proper medical condi
tions rather than to outlaw it and
force women to seek help from illegal,
unsafe sources.
At a time when we are having as
many as a million and a half teen
agers becoming pregnant every year,
we cannot ignore this problem. Right
now we are having an excess of un
wanted babies for which the welfare
agencies are having great difficulty
finding homes.
Gov. George Deukmeyian is attempt
ing to do away with the state office of
Family Planning, an extraordinarily
short-sighted attempt at cost-cutting
which would further compound the
problem by removing contraceptive
guidance from those who need it most.
The end result will be more unwanted
children with all their attendant prob
lems. To outlaw abortion will further
compound this problem.
