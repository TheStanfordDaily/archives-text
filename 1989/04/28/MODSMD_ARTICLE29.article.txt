## Gliding offers the fun of flying without the motor Floating through the air and catching waves at 3,500 feet 
### Tim Marklein Amy Rosenfeld Editorial staff 
Glider pilots and surfers both
"catch waves." But the similarity
ends there. While surfers usually
prefer to catch theirs on the
ocean, gliders do it 3,500 feet
above sea level.
Floating through the air in an
engineless aircraft, glider pilots
can use "thermals" and "waves"
to make their vessels rise — a
process called soaring, the thrill
that draws Electrical Engineering
graduate student Inder Singh to
the sport.
Singh originally started flying
at age 16. In India, where Singh
grew up, "you can fly before you
can drive," he says.
He describes the difference be
tween gliding and flying a power
plane as analogous to sailing
versus power boating. Gliders
have "all the same controls as any
full-fledged plane — everything
but the motor," he says.
Even with no motor, gliders fly
high and long. The greatest alti
tude reached by a glider is 50,000
feet, higher than the 30,000 feet
averaged by commercial jetliners,
according to Singh. The distance
record of 900 miles was achieved
by a European who flew until he
"ran out of continent" over Spain,
Singh says.
The distance gliders fly depends
on the grade of aircraft. Training
gliders fly 25 feet for every one
foot lost in altitude. High
performance gliders fly a slope of
37-to-l, and competition gliders
average about 50-to-l.
Slopes lose all relevance, how
ever, when the glider pilot enters
either a "lift" or a "sink" — air

currents that pressure the plane
to gain or lose altitude. The pilot
stays on the lookout for develop
ing clouds, Singh says, which
usually carry stronger air cur
rents than normal air.
"Wherever there is lift, there is
also sink," Singh says, adding that
the glider pilot tries to maximize
the effect of lift without losing
the gained altitude by hitting a
heavy sink.
If the pilot hits a heavy sink,
which may force the glider down
about 500 feet, the pilot will dive
out of the sink to avoid a contin
ued loss of altitude. In the dive,
the glider often reaches air speeds
of over 100 knots.
Using a stick and rudder similar
to those on a power plane, the
glider pilot is in complete control
of the aircraft.
Singh compares flying a glider
to driving a car, except for the
"third dimension" of altitude. "If
there's a problem in a car, you
can just pull over," he jokes.
Having control of an unpowered
aircraft creates a special thrill for
most glider pilots, Singh says.
"When you get a couple of g-forces
under your control, you know it's
a controllable beast."
Although Singh also flies small
power planes, he prefers the ride
of a glider, because it is more
natural and lacks the "noisy rack
et" and instability inherent in a
small plane.
"Gliding is as basic as flying
gets," Singh says. "You are purely
working with the forces of nature
and sometimes you find yourself
soaring with the birds."
Many gliders — including the
GROB 103 ACRO model which
Singh prefers to rent — are fully
aerobatic, which allows glider

pilots to do wing-overs, loops, rolls
and spins. However, aerobatics
are illegal in this area because of
the crowded air space.
The GROB 103 is a high
performance fiberglass sailplane
with a 57-foot wingspan. The two
seater plane, which sells for about
$38,000, is manufactured in West
Germany, where Singh says the
best gliders are made.
After the pilot gets in the glider,
he buckles the five-point harness
and wiggles the glider's rudder as
a signal for takeoff. Then, the tow
plane — a rickety little plane
which looks as if it could never
make it in the air itself, let alone
with a glider in tow — starts to
drag the sailplane down the run
way.
Certified air mechanics regu
larly check the gliders for safety,
but Singh says, "It's a stupid pilot
who doesn't check all (the glider's)
functions before flying."
Even in the air, safety is a pri
mary concern. "You must always
be alert, constantly thinking of
what can go wrong, thinking of
escape plans," Singh says. How
ever, he adds that he has flown
about 600 flights without any
safety problems.
According to A.J. Allee, who
owns the Sky Sailing Gliderport
in Fremont with his brother, the
century-old sport of soaring began
to die out in the 1950s but has
gained new popularity in recent
years.
"The French were doing gliding
in the 1880s," says Allee, a retired
Air Force Lieutenant Colonel who
flew missions in World War II and
the Korean and Vietnam Wars.
The Wright brothers were
gliding enthusiasts, Allee says,
and it was their gliding which led

to the development of engine
powered aircraft.
Located about 30 minutes from
Stanford across the Dumbarton
Bridge, Sky Sailing is one of eight
gliderports in California and the
largest training glider port in the
world. It's not unusual to have
100 flights a day out of the air
port, especially on a weekend, Al
lee says.
Stanford students and profes
sors are frequent customers at the
airport, where a ride in a glider
costs between $40 to $100, de
pending on the time and distance
covered.
Bert Hesselink, an associate
professor of aeronautics and
astronautics, has flown in gliders
before but recently took his first
flight at Sky Sailing. Hesselink

does not have his own license but
says he enjoys riding in gliders
because of "the quietness and the
feeling that you're soaring on
your own power."
"It can be a very thrilling
feeling," he says.
Sky Sailing also offers glider
lessons for more adventurous
souls who would like to "control
the beast" themselves.
Instructor John Fulton, who
graduated from Princeton Univer
sity a few years ago, is taking
time out from his education to
teach flying at Sky Sailing. He
estimates he has flown over
10,000 glider flights.
In about two months, Fulton
says, just about anyone can learn
to fly. To receive a certification

from the Federal Aviation Admin
istration, a pilot must log 10 hours
of instructional flying time and
seven hours of solo flights. Finally,
after a written exam and a flight
check, the pilot is certified to
carry passengers.
However, even with the best
training and meticulous pre-flight
checks, there is one hazard of
flying which no manual can help
with — airsickness. First-time
glider passengers might be
advised to eat only a light meal,
if anything, before their flight.
According to Allee, who began
flying 58 years ago in a Colorado
wheat field, the only way to avoid
this hazard is "practice." After a
while, the queasiness disappears,
he says.
