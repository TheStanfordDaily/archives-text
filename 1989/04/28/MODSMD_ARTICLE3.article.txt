# Kennedy says no to senior class speaker
## 
### Rob Burwell Senior staff writer 
Just back from a Centennial celebration
in Europe, University President Donald
Kennedy used a travel analogy to slam the
door on the possibility of a member of the
senior class speaking at this year's Com
mencement: For this year at least, "it is
an airplane that cannot fly."
Kennedy said yesterday that although he
would submit the idea to the Commence
ment Committee for consideration for next
year, the idea "came much too late for this
year."
Kennedy outlined three reasons that the
speech could not be included in Commence
ment ceremonies this June. First, the Com
mencement program is already at the print
ers, Kennedy said.
Second, there are still too many problems
with the proposed speaker selection proc
ess. And finally, even if a selection com
mittee used the process already outlined,
it would not reach a decision until it would
be too late to prepare a speech, he said.
"I have already started working on my

speech," Kennedy added.
The idea of having a student speak at
Commencement was initiated by seniors
Xavier Briggs and James Pitofsky and was
discussed at a meeting yesterday between
Kennedy and members of the Council of
Presidents.
COP member Miguel Marquez, a senior,
said he was disappointed with Kennedy's
reaction to the idea.
"[The COP] still supports the idea of a
student speaker at our graduation," Mar
quez said. "It's a good way to get a student's
perspective on our time at Stanford."
Kennedy added that the Commencement
Committee will have to give "careful con
sideration" to the selction process when it
looks at the issue next year.
The final process will have to reconcile
the problem of addressing both undergrad
uates and graduates slated to pick up their
diplomas, he said. "We hand out more
diplomas to graduates than undergraduates
each June."
There will also have to be a role for
faculty and some consideration of academic
achievement used in the selection process,
Kennedy said.
