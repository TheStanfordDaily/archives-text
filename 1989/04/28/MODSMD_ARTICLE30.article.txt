# Bruised and broken Bug uncovers truth about sororities
## 
### Mark Smoyer Senior staff writer 
Well, if you find this week's
column is easier to keep up with
than the usual Bug Me, it's 'cause
1 recently broke my finger and so
am typing this very slowly.
This broken finger is just one
of the many reasons the final
months of my zany college years
in sunny California are sure to
usher my life even deeper into the
catacombs of worthlessness.
Or, as my Uncle Arthur used
to say, "Things are not always
what they seem, especially if they
seem in any way positive."
In the process of researching
this week's first couple questions,
I was reminded of a corollary to
that piece of wisdom: Things are
not always what they seem, espe
cially if they seem in any way
exciting or interesting.
So I'm in a bad mood, so what?
Everything will be A-OK as long
as this graduating senior com
mencement speaker idea works
out.
The Bug sure hopes the chosen
one is really cheery and talks
about all those things that have
unified our erstwhile diverse class
of '89 — you know, Big Game
and Res Ed and the Western Cul

ture debate and community serv
ice and Vuamets . . .
Dear Bug,
On the corner of Page Mill and
El Camino there's a beat-up old
antique/thrift store. Not once in
six years have I seen this place
open for business!
I've heard various rumors about
this place being a front for various

nefarious dealings. What's the
real deal with this place?
— Harry Belafonte
This was one of a few questions
the Bug has received concerning
"Polly & Jake's", which although
it still has a listing as a Bryant
Avenue furniture store in the
white pages, has sat closed at the
El Camino/Page Mill corner for
about four years.
As usual, the truth of the mat
ter is far less interesting than its
myth.
The county assessor's office
lists David Swartz as owner of
"Polly & Jake's", but Swartz's
wife, Elaine, said he is a trustee.
Polly, the actual owner, has been
in convalescence for many years,
and, according to Mrs. Swartz,
maintains that upon her recovery
she will reopen the shop.
Mrs. Swartz hardly sounded
like somebody who would run a
den of iniquity out of the antique
store owned by an ill oc
togenarian, despite the red lamps
and generally murky appearance
of the place which created that
rumor. Basically, it's a pretty per
sonal thing, even though it does
involve an extremely valuable
piece of property on the area's
main consumer strip.
"It's sort of a delusion the lady

'Things are not al
ways what they
seem, especially if
they seem in any
way positive.'

has and it's something we don't
like to destroy," Mrs. Swartz said.
Jake was Polly's husband. They
opened the store together in 1929,
a great year to start a business.
Although my instincts tell me
that the situation is a very per
sonal one, they also tell me the
situation's about as odd as 919.
I mean we're dealing here with
prime storefront property being
closed for four years and being
listed in the white pages under
an entirely wrong address. Per
haps one of the Bug's predeces
sors will shine a more revealing
light, but until then, some mys
tery remains.
Dear Bug,
Is it true that they unhoused
sororities 'cause some girl com
mitted suicide over not getting in
to one? , , ,
— Ashford and Simpson
Sorry, but unless somebody

comes forth with evidence to the
contrary, the answer is no.
Fraternal Affairs Adviser Joe
Pisano said, "As far as I know,
it's just simply not true."
Pisano said he has been asked
about this before and has con
ferred with a number of Univer
sity officials, but has yet to hear
anything to confirm the rumor.
Housed sororities existed until
1944, when they were completely
disbanded. Since its inception, the
sorority system had been held
suspect, by both those within and
without it, due to its "divisive"
nature. Sororities would not reap
pear in any form until 1977, when
their absence in light of the fra
ternities' presence was thought of
as discriminatory. However, they
were never housed again after
1944, according to Pisano.
To compensate for the lack of
a graphically-described suicide
here, the Bug will relate an inci
dent which was printed by the
Boston Globe in December as part
of a compilation of 1988's most
bizarre news wire stories:
"In Los Angeles, a bystander
watching a man prepare to leap
to his death from a bridge asked
if he could have the man's car."
Dear Bug,
What would happen if I didn't

dissolve my Alka-Seltzer before
taking it?
— Slim Whitman
Mrs. Kent, a member of the
public relations department at
Miles Laboratories, said her com
pany's most famous product is so
safe that it doesn't even have to
be packaged in child-resistant con
tainers. The reason Alka-Seltzer
is safe is 'cause it's too big to just
swallow whole and it basically dis
solves and makes you throw up
the minute you put it in your
mouth. At least that's what Mrs.
Kent said.
To be specific: "Being hydrop
hilic — which means attracting
water — the dry product, if placed
directly in the mouth, will imme
diately react with the saliva,
producing a tingling sensation and
a foaming action which tends to
cause gagging. ... It would never
get into your stomach whole,
you'd probably vomit before it got
anyplace."
She asked that the Bug advise
against anybody attempting to
refute her theory, but actually
he'd just as soon advise that you
do attempt it. The worst that
could happen is you'd get sick and
die. (Can I have first dibs on your
car?)
Until next week, the Bug has
spoken.

Dear Bug,
On the corner of Page Mill and
El Camino there's a beat-up old
antique/thrift store. Not once in
six years have I seen this place
open for business!
I've heard various rumors about
this place being a front for various

nefarious dealings. What's the
real deal with this place?
— Harry Belafonte
This was one of a few questions
the Bug has received concerning
"Polly & Jake's", which although
it still has a listing as a Bryant
Avenue furniture store in the
white pages, has sat closed at the
El Camino/Page Mill corner for
about four years.
As usual, the truth of the mat
ter is far less interesting than its
myth.
The county assessor's office
lists David Swartz as owner of
"Polly & Jake's", but Swartz's
wife, Elaine, said he is a trustee.
Polly, the actual owner, has been
in convalescence for many years,
and, according to Mrs. Swartz,
maintains that upon her recovery
she will reopen the shop.
Mrs. Swartz hardly sounded
like somebody who would run a
den of iniquity out of the antique
store owned by an ill oc
togenarian, despite the red lamps
and generally murky appearance
of the place which created that
rumor. Basically, it's a pretty per
sonal thing, even though it does
involve an extremely valuable
piece of property on the area's
main consumer strip.
"It's sort of a delusion the lady

'Things are not al
ways what they
seem, especially if
they seem in any
way positive.'

has and it's something we don't
like to destroy," Mrs. Swartz said.
Jake was Polly's husband. They
opened the store together in 1929,
a great year to start a business.
Although my instincts tell me
that the situation is a very per
sonal one, they also tell me the
situation's about as odd as 919.
I mean we're dealing here with
prime storefront property being
closed for four years and being
listed in the white pages under
an entirely wrong address. Per
haps one of the Bug's predeces
sors will shine a more revealing
light, but until then, some mys
tery remains.
Dear Bug,
Is it true that they unhoused
sororities 'cause some girl com
mitted suicide over not getting in
to one? , , ,
— Ashford and Simpson
Sorry, but unless somebody

comes forth with evidence to the
contrary, the answer is no.
Fraternal Affairs Adviser Joe
Pisano said, "As far as I know,
it's just simply not true."
Pisano said he has been asked
about this before and has con
ferred with a number of Univer
sity officials, but has yet to hear
anything to confirm the rumor.
Housed sororities existed until
1944, when they were completely
disbanded. Since its inception, the
sorority system had been held
suspect, by both those within and
without it, due to its "divisive"
nature. Sororities would not reap
pear in any form until 1977, when
their absence in light of the fra
ternities' presence was thought of
as discriminatory. However, they
were never housed again after
1944, according to Pisano.
To compensate for the lack of
a graphically-described suicide
here, the Bug will relate an inci
dent which was printed by the
Boston Globe in December as part
of a compilation of 1988's most
bizarre news wire stories:
"In Los Angeles, a bystander
watching a man prepare to leap
to his death from a bridge asked
if he could have the man's car."
Dear Bug,
What would happen if I didn't

dissolve my Alka-Seltzer before
taking it?
— Slim Whitman
Mrs. Kent, a member of the
public relations department at
Miles Laboratories, said her com
pany's most famous product is so
safe that it doesn't even have to
be packaged in child-resistant con
tainers. The reason Alka-Seltzer
is safe is 'cause it's too big to just
swallow whole and it basically dis
solves and makes you throw up
the minute you put it in your
mouth. At least that's what Mrs.
Kent said.
To be specific: "Being hydrop
hilic — which means attracting
water — the dry product, if placed
directly in the mouth, will imme
diately react with the saliva,
producing a tingling sensation and
a foaming action which tends to
cause gagging. ... It would never
get into your stomach whole,
you'd probably vomit before it got
anyplace."
She asked that the Bug advise
against anybody attempting to
refute her theory, but actually
he'd just as soon advise that you
do attempt it. The worst that
could happen is you'd get sick and
die. (Can I have first dibs on your
car?)
Until next week, the Bug has
spoken.
