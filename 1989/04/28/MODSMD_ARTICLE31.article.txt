## Stanford spikes USC, faces Hawaii in West final 
### Chris Crader Senior staff writer 
LOS ANGELES — It may have been a long
time coming, but for the Stanford men's vol
leyball team, its first-ever postseason victory
was well worth the wait.
It took the Cardinal two hours and 16
minutes — and six match points — to defeat
the fourth-ranked USC Trojans. The outcome,
however, was never in doubt in the 15-10,
15-4, 12-15, 15-9 win at Albert Gersten Pa
vilion, on the campus of Loyola Marymount.
Stanford, ranked second nationally, is now
23-5 and faces Hawaii Saturday night in the
Western Regional final. USC, ranked fourth,
finishes the season at 29-10.
Hawaii (22-6 and ranked third) defeated
sixth-ranked UC-Santa Barbara (26-13) 15-6,
9-15, 15-10, 15-6 in the second semifinal. Allen
Allen led the way with 16 kills and 17 digs,
and Gary Van Sickle and Brian Poppinga each
had 12 kills. Jose Gandara had 22 kills for
the Gauchos.
The championship match, which will deter
mine the last berth in the Final Four, will
be played at Gersten Pavilion Saturday night
at 7:30 p.m.
"We did a good job," Stanford Coach Fred
Sturm said. "We were a little tight, I think,
but we played through it."
Stanford had perhaps the most balanced
attack the squad has had all year as five
players reached double-figures in kills. Scott
Fortune led the way with a match-high 31
kills, 16 digs and five blocks. Dan Hanan
added 22 kills, a .472 hitting percentage, 14
digs and two blocks.
Other Stanford players posting double
doubles were Duncan Blackman (17 kills, .344
percentage and 11 digs), Craig Forsyth (13
kills, 13 digs) and John Alstrom (11 kills,
.400 percentage, a match-high 21 digs and
three blocks). Setter Parker Blackman added

83 assists and 10 digs.
"I thought that we came out real strong in
the first two games," Duncan Blackman said.
"We could have played better defense. The
third game ... we let SC stay in the match.
In the fourth, we played hard and took it
away from them."
USC was led by Chris Martz and Lawrence
Horn, who had 23 kills each, but the Trojans
hit under .250 as a team. Stanford hit .322.
The Stanford players downplayed the fact
that this was the team's first postseason win.
"That's not something we even think about,"
Parker Blackman said. "We have a very high
level of expectation for ourselves. We think:
'We want to win this because that's one step
closer to the Final Four.' I think that's the
right attitude to have."
Stanford lost to Hawaii in three straight
games at Maples in January, but the Cardinal
was playing without Hanan and Forsyth.
Hanan had the flu, and Forsyth had two
lacerated fingers.
The following night, in a rematch, Hanan
and Forsyth were in the lineup and the Car
dinal prevailed in five games.
"I think we have to play well," said Sturm,
looking toward Saturday's match. "The key
for us is siding out. We've got to side out;
we've got to block . .. We just have to play
our game."
Against the Trojans, Stanford did just that.
The team jumped ahead early in game one
and never allowed USC to get close. After
many side outs, the score reached 14-8. Alstom
blocked Bryan Ivie one-on-one to end the
game.
In the second game, Stanford raced out to
an 8-2 lead before the Trojans staged a mini
comeback to creep to 8-4. A few Cardinal
blocks later, however, it was 14-4. Horn hit
long to end the game.
The third game seesawed until USC took a
12-8 lead. Adam Keefe, the 6-foot-9 freshman,

entered the match to come up with a block
and two kills to tie the score, but it was not
enough. The Trojans came back to run off
three points, and the Cardinal had to wait a
little longer for victory.
If Stanford was a little uninspired in the
third game, the team made up for it in the
fourth. Fortune's hitting and blocking took
Stanford to a 14-7 lead, and after five side
outs, Alstrom blocked Dan Greenbaum's dump
attempt to end the match.
Stanford had played in the same gym only
six nights earlier, losing the first game and
falling behind in the second against Loyola
Marymount, the 10th place team in the league.
The Cardinal did, however, rebound to defeat
the Lions.
"I thought we did a good job bouncing back
after having a horrible match in this gym,"
Duncan Blackman said. "Everyone played
well."
Hawaii is playing without the services of
junior outside hitter Carlos Briceno. Briceno,
an All-American last season, played in a pro
fessional beach tournament about a month
ago. Although he did not accept prize money,
his partner did and the NCAA ruled that he
would serve a two match suspension. He sat
out last night and will not play tomorrow to
complete the suspension.
Card notes
Tomorrow's match will be televised life by a
Hawaiian cable company. For interested fans, the
match most likely will be picked up The Oasis
restaraunt. Call The Oasis for more details.
In the first Stanford-Hawaii match this season,
Poppinga had 19 kills in 20 attempts (a .950 hitting
percentage, and, no, that is not a typo) to lead the
Rainbows to a 15-4, 15-12, 15-3 win. Allen added
12 kills and Briceno had 11. Stanford was led by
Fortune with 14 and Mike Lowe with 11.
In the rematch, a 7-15, 11-15, 15-10, 15-9, 15-13
thriller, Hanan had 35 kills, and Fortune had 34.
