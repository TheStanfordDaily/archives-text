# Randomness strikes Stanford sports, Daily pages
## 
### 
Lest anyone get confused, allow me
to explain the irregular nature of
this column.
This past week has been the week of
randomness in Stanford athletics. A miss
called coin inexplicably landed the men's
volleyball team in the West Regional and
UCLA in the Final Four, when Stanford
won five out of the eight games the teams
played. Random.
Defending NCAA champion Stanford
baseball, ranked No. 1 on one of the two
preseason polls, virtually guaranteed that
it will not repeat by losing yet more
ground in the Pacific 10 Southern Divi
sion race. A title year followed by a build
ing year. Random.
Both the men and women's track teams
have been slated as one-point favorites
over California this weekend. Stanford
has not beaten Cal in the Big Meet in
17 years. Random.
As a salute to the randomness that
has pervaded Stanford sports, The Daily
is proud to unveil the latest in a series
of semiregular sports features with
catchy monikers. Welcome to Inside Edge.
"What is Inside Edge?" you might in
quire.
Regulated randomness. Delving into
the wealth of information churned out
about Stanford athletics, Inside Edge
tries to make sense of it all. Blending
certainties with conjecture, Inside Edge
explores the subtle nuances and unseen
elements into one hopefully-coherent
column.

Or, to put it another way, Evan
rambles. Incessantly. Biweekly.
In any case, this should be interesting
(as I often responded when my mother
asked me my opinion about a meal she
created and I didn't wish to use the word
"toxic"). Let's see how this goes, shall we?
To commence, a thought came to
me while reading Robert Portnoy's
column in yesterday's Daily. Amid
his NBA awards was an interesting com
ment on Kevin Johnson of the Phoenix
Suns, who has had an outstanding
season:
"We in the Bay Area weren't surprised
to see KJ hit the big time this year.
Stanford fans watched him run circles
around the Cardinal while the Berkeley
faithful relished it.

"There is still one thing that we don't
understand: Why didn't Cal Coach Lou
Campanelli ever let Johnson loose? Were

it not for the ball and chain Johnson
carried around the court, the Bears might
have had an NCAA tourney bid or two."
What I found interesting (in the fas
cination, hot culinary, sense) is how easily
this can be adapted to describe Todd
Lichti's upcoming rookie season in the
NBA. This may turn out to be idle
speculation, but for once I agree with
some of the experts who say that, un
leashed in the open court, Lichti will be
a terror.
Stanford fans saw some, but hardly
all, of what Lichti can do. In fact, it
would be infinitely quicker to list what
he cannot do: (pause). Thank you for
your time.
Once again the following is conjecture,
but it is conceivable that had the Cardinal
supported Lichti instead of vice-versa the
season finale might have been in the
Northeast.
In any event, switch KJ with Todd the
God, make the appropriate school adjust
ments, and Portnoy's words state what
fans next year may well feel.
Our next item up for bids is a wom
en's gymnastics coach. Unknown
to many, long-time Cardinal Coach
Homer Sardina will not return to the
Farm next season.
That leaves a big opening to fill. With
a stellar group of freshmen this year,
Stanford is a team with potential, spelled
"t-a-l-e-n-t."
A nationwide search for a replacement

veil Inside Edge, the latest

is going on, but there is really no need
to look beyond Stanford. Beyond Encina
Gym. Beyond the women's gymnastics
office.
You see, Stanford employs Steve Fis
her. Yes, the Michigan marvel.
Only here, his name is Sam Shaw. An
assistant for several years and currently
the acting head coach, Shaw is a man
whom the Athletic Department powers
that-be would be wise to hire.
I got to see a lot of Shaw in action
two years ago when I was the beat writer
for women's gymnastics. He is well
respected and well-liked by the athletes,
a knowledgeable coach and a great guy.
A successful program needs nothing
more.
People often wonder whether an assis
tant coach can make the "big" jump to
the top position. Fisher proved he could
do it; hopefully Shaw will get his chance.
More randomness: Out of nowhere,
women's crew is a national
power.
Well, probably if I paid better attention
over the long haul, this would not have
been such a revelation. But when I heard
John Davis, the Cardinal's coach, dissem

inating the following facts, I knew it was
time to wake up and snort the grinds
(another charming Evan expression oc
casionally unleashed on his nuclear fam
ily).
First off, at this weekend's Big Row
(can't anyone compete with Cal without
bringing in this Big stuff?), Stanford has
a good chance of shooting past the Bears
into the No. 1 spot in the Pac-10. A big
(lower case B) win, indeed.
The next bit of news is that five of
the rowers — Ellen Austin, Audrey Bar
nett, Laura Stearns, Katherine Van Uum
and Kim Walsh — have been invited to
compete for places on U.S. National Team
boats this summer.
Consider the significance of this. Five
athletes from one team trying out for
the National Team is spectacular. Things
were exciting enough when Lichti was
Stanford's sole representative in the
Olympic Trials. Now there are four more
than that asked to give Team USA a
whirl. Pretty awesome.
Finally, Asst. Coach Wendy Davis has
been named U.S. Junior Women's Na
tional Team coach for the summer. No
comment necessary.
While we're at it, let's go for one
more tidbit. If you have nothing
to do Monday and want to ir
ritate a lot of celebrities, crash the Jim
Plunkett Celebrity/Amateur Golf Tour
nament.


EVAN TUCHINSKY
The event will raise money for
The Stanford Buck/Cardinal Club,
which acquires the money needed
to finance athletic scholarships.
Unlike other schools where the
general scholarship funds foot the
bill for athlete*, Stanford's Ath
letic Department must pay its own
way in the rea'.m of financial aid.
I won't spoil the surprise by
naming the celebrities, but many
are athletes of the headliner
Plunkett's caliber.
Playing with the Stanford worn

en's golf team in its entirety, in
cluding redshirt freshman Martha
Richards of Cardinal basketball
fame, the stars hope to shine on
Stanford's course (pardon the
cliche — it was irresistable).
Well, that's about all for now.
Until next week, The Bug has
spoken.
Oh, sorry, wrong column.
By the way, it is National Ran
domness Week. Overturn a neat
friend's desk; it's cheaper than a
card.

In any event, switch KJ with Todd the
God, make the appropriate school adjust
ments, and Portnoy's words state what
fans next year may well feel.
Our next item up for bids is a wom
en's gymnastics coach. Unknown
to many, long-time Cardinal Coach
Homer Sardina will not return to the
Farm next season.
That leaves a big opening to fill. With
a stellar group of freshmen this year,
Stanford is a team with potential, spelled
"t-a-l-e-n-t."

is going on, but there is really no need
to look beyond Stanford. Beyond Encina
Gym. Beyond the women's gymnastics
office.
You see, Stanford employs Steve Fis
her. Yes, the Michigan marvel.
Only here, his name is Sam Shaw. An
assistant for several years and currently
the acting head coach, Shaw is a man
whom the Athletic Department powers
that-be would be wise to hire.
I got to see a lot of Shaw in action
two years ago when I was the beat writer
for women's gymnastics. He is well
respected and well-liked by the athletes,
a knowledgeable coach and a great guy.
A successful program needs nothing
more.
People often wonder whether an assis
tant coach can make the "big" jump to
the top position. Fisher proved he could
do it; hopefully Shaw will get his chance.
More randomness: Out of nowhere,
women's crew is a national
power.
Well, probably if I paid better attention
over the long haul, this would not have
been such a revelation. But when I heard
John Davis, the Cardinal's coach, dissem

inating the following facts, I knew it was
time to wake up and snort the grinds
(another charming Evan expression oc
casionally unleashed on his nuclear fam
ily).
First off, at this weekend's Big Row
(can't anyone compete with Cal without
bringing in this Big stuff?), Stanford has
a good chance of shooting past the Bears
into the No. 1 spot in the Pac-10. A big
(lower case B) win, indeed.
The next bit of news is that five of
the rowers — Ellen Austin, Audrey Bar
nett, Laura Stearns, Katherine Van Uum
and Kim Walsh — have been invited to
compete for places on U.S. National Team
boats this summer.
Consider the significance of this. Five
athletes from one team trying out for
the National Team is spectacular. Things
were exciting enough when Lichti was
Stanford's sole representative in the
Olympic Trials. Now there are four more
than that asked to give Team USA a
whirl. Pretty awesome.
Finally, Asst. Coach Wendy Davis has
been named U.S. Junior Women's Na
tional Team coach for the summer. No
comment necessary.
While we're at it, let's go for one
more tidbit. If you have nothing
to do Monday and want to ir
ritate a lot of celebrities, crash the Jim
Plunkett Celebrity/Amateur Golf Tour
nament.


EVAN TUCHINSKY
The event will raise money for
The Stanford Buck/Cardinal Club,
which acquires the money needed
to finance athletic scholarships.
Unlike other schools where the
general scholarship funds foot the
bill for athlete*, Stanford's Ath
letic Department must pay its own
way in the rea'.m of financial aid.
I won't spoil the surprise by
naming the celebrities, but many
are athletes of the headliner
Plunkett's caliber.
Playing with the Stanford worn

en's golf team in its entirety, in
cluding redshirt freshman Martha
Richards of Cardinal basketball
fame, the stars hope to shine on
Stanford's course (pardon the
cliche — it was irresistable).
Well, that's about all for now.
Until next week, The Bug has
spoken.
Oh, sorry, wrong column.
By the way, it is National Ran
domness Week. Overturn a neat
friend's desk; it's cheaper than a
card.

Evan Tuchinsky is a senior staff
writer at The Daily with delusions
of humor.
Lest anyone get confused, allow me
to explain the irregular nature of
this column.
This past week has been the week of
randomness in Stanford athletics. A miss
called coin inexplicably landed the men's
volleyball team in the West Regional and
UCLA in the Final Four, when Stanford
won five out of the eight games the teams
played. Random.
Defending NCAA champion Stanford
baseball, ranked No. 1 on one of the two
preseason polls, virtually guaranteed that
it will not repeat by losing yet more
ground in the Pacific 10 Southern Divi
sion race. A title year followed by a build
ing year. Random.
Both the men and women's track teams
have been slated as one-point favorites
over California this weekend. Stanford
has not beaten Cal in the Big Meet in
17 years. Random.
As a salute to the randomness that
has pervaded Stanford sports, The Daily
is proud to unveil the latest in a series
of semiregular sports features with
catchy monikers. Welcome to Inside Edge.
"What is Inside Edge?" you might in
quire.
Regulated randomness. Delving into
the wealth of information churned out
about Stanford athletics, Inside Edge
tries to make sense of it all. Blending
certainties with conjecture, Inside Edge
explores the subtle nuances and unseen
elements into one hopefully-coherent
column.

Or, to put it another way, Evan
rambles. Incessantly. Biweekly.
In any case, this should be interesting
(as I often responded when my mother
asked me my opinion about a meal she
created and I didn't wish to use the word
"toxic"). Let's see how this goes, shall we?
To commence, a thought came to
me while reading Robert Portnoy's
column in yesterday's Daily. Amid
his NBA awards was an interesting com
ment on Kevin Johnson of the Phoenix
Suns, who has had an outstanding
season:
"We in the Bay Area weren't surprised
to see KJ hit the big time this year.
Stanford fans watched him run circles
around the Cardinal while the Berkeley
faithful relished it.

"There is still one thing that we don't
understand: Why didn't Cal Coach Lou
Campanelli ever let Johnson loose? Were

it not for the ball and chain Johnson
carried around the court, the Bears might
have had an NCAA tourney bid or two."
What I found interesting (in the fas
cination, hot culinary, sense) is how easily
this can be adapted to describe Todd
Lichti's upcoming rookie season in the
NBA. This may turn out to be idle
speculation, but for once I agree with
some of the experts who say that, un
leashed in the open court, Lichti will be
a terror.
Stanford fans saw some, but hardly
all, of what Lichti can do. In fact, it
would be infinitely quicker to list what
he cannot do: (pause). Thank you for
your time.
Once again the following is conjecture,
but it is conceivable that had the Cardinal
supported Lichti instead of vice-versa the
season finale might have been in the
Northeast.
In any event, switch KJ with Todd the
God, make the appropriate school adjust
ments, and Portnoy's words state what
fans next year may well feel.
