# Keyser pitches his way out of obscurity
## 
### Bruce Sarkisian Senior staff writer 
Getting a full page in the Stan
ford baseball media guide means
that the coaching staff is expect
ing big things from you. Of course
the big names get a full page:
Frank Carey, Paul Carey, Troy
Paulsen etc. But this year there
was a full-page surprise: pitcher
Brian Keyser.

Keyser had toiled in relative
obscurity for much of his Stanford
career, pitching solidly behind
Stanford legends Jack McDowell
and Lee Plemel. Last year Keyser
suffered a sore elbow early in the
season, then pitched in 17 games,
two as a starter, amassing a 3-0
record and 6.27 ERA.
With Plemel graduated last
year, there was a gap in Stanford's
starting rotation. Sophomores

Stan Spencer and Mike Mussina
would be the number one and two
men, but a third starter was
needed.
Keyser emerged in fall practice
as that third starter, and thus
merited a full page in the media
guide. But Keyser fizzled in the
early season, struggling with his
control and giving up a lot of runs.
"One of the easiest things for
him to do would be to give up,

but he never gave up," Stanford
pitcher Scott Weiss said.
Indeed, Keyser worked hard
and battled back. When talking
about his return to form this year,
almost everyone talks about his
8% inning performance at USC,
when Keyser struck out eight
Trojans to preserve Stanford's
win. Since then, Keyser has been
stellar, most recently pitching
three innings against 13th-ranked
Fresno State and allowing only
one unearned run.
"He's pitching about as well
right now as he has in his career,"
said Cardinal pitching Coach Tom
Dunton. "With his bad start and
him being a senior, he could be
an attitude problem, but he
hasn't. That means a lot to the
team and the coaches."
According to Dunton, Keyser is
now more of a "pitcher" instead
of a "thrower." He has worked
hard to develop new pitches for
his repertoire, including an effec
tive straight change.
When he first came to the
Farm, Keyser was a hard thrower
with a live arm and not much
finesse. He relied on his fastball
and a medium-hard slider to get
batters out. Now Keyser has com
mand of four pitches, according
to Dunton: a fastball, a straight
change, a hard slider and a down
breaking curve. According to com
puter whiz Jeff Earhart's statis
tics, Keyser uses the fastball 48
percent of the time, the slider 38
percent, the curve 11 percent and
the changeup three percent.
Catcher Eric Cox credits

Keyser's confidence on the mound
with his resurgence. "It was like
he was holding back a little bit
before. It seems like he really has
an edge out there now and he's
pitching with a lot more confi
dence," he said.
Keyser's career has been
marred by injury, which may have
led to his ineffectiveness earlier
in the year. "He's changed the
way he throws his curve because
he's not trying to protect his arm
any more," Weiss said.
As one of the few seniors on
the team, Keyser has also as
sumed a leadership role among
the pitchers. "The way he's been
throwing lately you know he's
gonna give you his best effort and
that gives everyone a lift. He's
one of the best cheerleaders when

he's not pitching," Weiss added.
By virtue of his performance at
USC, Keyser earned back a start
ing spot that has bounced between
him, freshman Steve Worrell, and
Weiss all season. The key to a win
this weekend will be for Keyser
to be aggressive against some
tough Arizona bats. Six of the
nine starters for the 'Cats are
hitting .300 or better.
"He has to be aggressive and
he has to have command of his
pitches," Dunton said.
If Keyser keeps throwing as
well as he has the past two weeks,
a win against Arizona should be
no problem and his resurgence
could lead him all the way to the
league draft and a full page
in someone else's media guide.

starting rotation. Sophomores

Stan Spencer and Mike Mussina
would be the number one and two
men, but a third starter was
needed.
Keyser emerged in fall practice
as that third starter, and thus
merited a full page in the media
guide. But Keyser fizzled in the
early season, struggling with his
control and giving up a lot of runs.
"One of the easiest things for
him to do would be to give up,

but he never gave up," Stanford
pitcher Scott Weiss said.
Indeed, Keyser worked hard
and battled back. When talking
about his return to form this year,
almost everyone talks about his
8% inning performance at USC,
when Keyser struck out eight
Trojans to preserve Stanford's
win. Since then, Keyser has been
stellar, most recently pitching
three innings against 13th-ranked
Fresno State and allowing only
one unearned run.
"He's pitching about as well
right now as he has in his career,"
said Cardinal pitching Coach Tom
Dunton. "With his bad start and
him being a senior, he could be
an attitude problem, but he
hasn't. That means a lot to the
team and the coaches."
According to Dunton, Keyser is
now more of a "pitcher" instead
of a "thrower." He has worked
hard to develop new pitches for
his repertoire, including an effec
tive straight change.
When he first came to the
Farm, Keyser was a hard thrower
with a live arm and not much
finesse. He relied on his fastball
and a medium-hard slider to get
batters out. Now Keyser has com
mand of four pitches, according
to Dunton: a fastball, a straight
change, a hard slider and a down
breaking curve. According to com
puter whiz Jeff Earhart's statis
tics, Keyser uses the fastball 48
percent of the time, the slider 38
percent, the curve 11 percent and
the changeup three percent.
Catcher Eric Cox credits

Keyser's confidence on the mound
with his resurgence. "It was like
he was holding back a little bit
before. It seems like he really has
an edge out there now and he's
pitching with a lot more confi
dence," he said.
Keyser's career has been
marred by injury, which may have
led to his ineffectiveness earlier
in the year. "He's changed the
way he throws his curve because
he's not trying to protect his arm
any more," Weiss said.
As one of the few seniors on
the team, Keyser has also as
sumed a leadership role among
the pitchers. "The way he's been
throwing lately you know he's
gonna give you his best effort and
that gives everyone a lift. He's
one of the best cheerleaders when

he's not pitching," Weiss added.
By virtue of his performance at
USC, Keyser earned back a start
ing spot that has bounced between
him, freshman Steve Worrell, and
Weiss all season. The key to a win
this weekend will be for Keyser
to be aggressive against some
tough Arizona bats. Six of the
nine starters for the 'Cats are
hitting .300 or better.
"He has to be aggressive and
he has to have command of his
pitches," Dunton said.
If Keyser keeps throwing as
well as he has the past two weeks,
a win against Arizona should be
no problem and his resurgence
could lead him all the way to the
league draft and a full page
