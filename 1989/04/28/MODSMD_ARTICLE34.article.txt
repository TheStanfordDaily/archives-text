last weekend against UCLA

seven games He has gone 2-for-23 over that span and has seen his
average fall to .302 after being in the 330 range earlier this season.
ARIZONA ANGLE — The Cats have won their last 11 games, including

KEYS TO VICTORY — The Cardinal needs a sweep to keep its postseason
hopes alive Spencer and Keyser have pitched well lately and if they
can keep the Wildcat offense down, Steve Chitren would be available
to pitch Sunday But it will be a tough task six of Arizona's starting nine
are batting above 300.
