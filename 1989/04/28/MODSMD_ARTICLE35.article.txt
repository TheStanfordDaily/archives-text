# Cardinal track prepares to munch Golden Bears
## 
### Greg Gottesman Staff writer 
Several things can motivate a track team.
A chance to break a 17-year losing streak
may spark a few. Home field advantage
definitely helps. Yet, for most on Stanford's
track and field team, having Cal on the
other side of the scorecard is all the mo
tivation they need.
Indeed, Big Meet this Saturday at noon
will be exactly that — BIG.
"This is the first meet that really
counts," Asst. Coach Scott Chisam ex
plained. "We have held out a lot of people
this season just so they could be healthy
to compete against Cal."
"To the team, this is an extremely im
portant meet," junior Venessa Henlon said.
"The coaches have been talking about this
one since September."
While Stanford women have compiled a
6-4 record over the past 10 years, the Car
dinal men have something to prove; they
have not beaten the boys from the other
side of the Bay since 1971. "We haven't
beaten Cal in some of the people on our
team's lifetime," sophomore Dave Strang
lamented. "The team is really psyched up
to beat them this year."
Last year, the Bears edged the Cardinal
men 71-70. Stanford women won 74-70.
Despite the losing streak, Strang said the
men's team has a better than good chance
of winning. "All it will take is everybody
performing at their best. I don't think
anyone is going to let Cal leave next Sat
urday with their eighteenth win in a row.
That's for sure."
A key race tomorrow includes the 1500

meters where 1988 Pac-10 champion Dave
Ottaway from Cal will square off against
Strang. Ottaway has run a 3:42.74, while
Strang has a 3:44.50. The two will also go
head to head in the 800 meters.
In the high jump, Stanford's John Hop
kins will try to outleap Cal's Mike Harris.
The long jump features Marcus Hickerson
of Stanford and Devin Smith of Cal. Hick
erson has a leap of 25-foot-2 this year,
while Smith has a jump of 25-lV*.
On the men's side, Stanford will be
favored in the shot put, discus, and javelin.
Cal has an edge in the short sprints and
short relay.
In terms of the women's competition,
freshman sensation Chryste Gaines, who
already holds the school record in the 100
meters, should receive stiff competition in
the sprints from Cal and from her sidekick
freshman Jackie Edwards. Edwards al
ready has qualified for the Pac-10's in the
long jump with a leap of 19-11.
National qualifiers Patty Purpur (shot
put and discus), Erica Wheeler (javelin)
and Peggy Odita (heptathlon) undoubtedly
will give the Cardinal an edge in their
respective events.
Strang concluded, "We need a lot of
people there. There's nothing better than
the feeling of running down the
homestretch and beating a guy from Cal
with a bunch of Stanford fans cheering. If
we get a lot of people, there is no way Cal
will come near us. Besides, if it's sunny,
there isn't really a better place to hang
out than Stanford Stadium."
The Big Meet field events kick off at
noon. The running events will not com
mence until 1:30 p.m.
