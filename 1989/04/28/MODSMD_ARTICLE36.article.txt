# Skippers favored at Pacific Coast
## 
### Hugh R. Bethell Staff writer 
For the Stanford women's sailing team, now
is the time. With three skippers in top form
and the Pacific Coast Championship to be held
on their home waters this weekend, the Car
dinal squad is currently looking at its best
chance to qualify for Women's Nationals in
several years.
Teams from all over the Pacific Coast region
will be travelling to Redwood City for the
event, which will determine the district's rep
resentatives at the national event at the end
of May. Over 12 schools are expected to attend.
As the start of the first race nears, two
teams stand out as particularly likely to do
well. From the South, the experienced and
accomplished UC-Irvine team will come to the
regatta as the favorite. Although once labeled
an underdog, the Cardinal team is considered
just as likely to win.
Stanford has emerged as one of the nation's
finest women's teams after several years of
inactivity. After being unranked for two sea
sons, the Cardinal sailed its way to a win at
the Women's Fall Championship and a ninth
at the prestigious Navy Women's Invitational.
The team's current strength is the result of
new and also returning talent. From among
last year's recruits came Cathy Petzold of
Michigan, who together with sophomore Katie
Burke has scored a series of improving finishes
in this year's regular season races.
Meanwhile, junior Kim Grose has been
steadily refining her skills since starting with
the team two years ago. Grose's time next to
the tiller has made her one of the
most formidable female competi
tors on the West Coast, especially
when sailing with four-year crew
member Amy Baltzer.
This year's team was incom
plete, however, until the return
of senior Buff Wendt, who rejoined
the Cardinal after a year-and-a
half absence from the Redwood
City waters. Wendt has demon

strated no rustiness since her
return, especially while winning
a recent North Series regatta with
freshman crew member Chris Li.
Together, Petzold, Grose, and
Wendt promise to be an especially
tough team to beat on their home
waters. According to Coach Blake
Middleton, their improvement re
cently has been startling.
"It's hard to believe they have
come so far so fast. During the
last month, they have become one
of the top women's teams in the
nation."
