# Golfers contend for NCAA regional birth
## 
### David Hirning Staff writer 
Five days of golf will determine
the post-season berths for the
NCAA District Eight regional. To
say that this weekend's trip is
crucial for the Cardinal men's golf
team would be an understatement
of mcyor proportions.
Coach Wally Goodwin takes his
team to the Cougar Classic at
Brigham Young University for 36
holes today and 18 tomorrow.
Then the Cardinal is whisked
away to Seattle for the Pac-10
Championships Monday, Tuesday
and Wednesday.
The BYU tournament may end
up being the more important of
the two, as Stanford will face
three teams that are fighting with
the Cardinal for the final few
spots in the 10-team regional.
"There are six teams that are
shoo-ins," Goodwin said. "We're
in a dead heat with California and
University of California at Santa
Barbara. We're 3-5 against San
Jose State, but we have a big
stroke differential over them."
Goodwin stated that his team
needs to beat UC-Santa Barbara

and gain at least a split with the
Golden Bears (as Cal also will be
in Seattle). Stanford could also
improve its position by knocking
off Arizona at the Pac-lOs. The
Wildcats defeated the C.ordinal by
one stroke in Hawaii.
"On paper, USC and Arizona
State are better than we are,"
Goodwin said. "We're 2-2 with
UCLA and 0-1 with Arizona.
We've beaten everybody else."
Last year, the men finished
fourth at the Pac-lOs, but Stan
ford is stronger this year, even if
they have not moved up in the
seedings. "Christian Cevaer can
play with anybody in the Pac-10,"
Goodwin said. "We're a more solid
third or fourth place team this
year."
Stanford has not finished
higher than fourth since 1984,
when it was second to USC in
Tucson.
Including practice rounds, the
five Cardinal golfers — or six, in
the case of the Pac-lOs — will
shoot more than 120 holes of golf
in the next six days. "It will be
mentally demanding," Goodwin
expounded. "If we do well, we'll
be in the regionals."
