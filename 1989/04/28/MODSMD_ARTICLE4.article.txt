## 
### Nathanael Cousins Staff writer 
After a 20-month absence, the George
Segal sculpture "Gay Liberation" will be
returned to the Lomita Mall next Wednes
day, according to Frank Kommer of the
Stanford Museum.
Ted Hardie, an officer for Stanford's Les
bian, Gay and Bisexual Community Center,
said yesterday that the University had not
yet told his organization when the sculp
ture would be back in place.
"If it's up on Wednesday, we're delighted
and we'll be dancing in the street," Hardie
said.
"Gay Liberation" has been a controver
sial symbol for the gay movement since its
unveiling on Feb. 22, 1984. It was taken
down in August 1987 after vandals spray

painted "AIDS" on one of the male figures.
Replacement of the sculpture has been
delayed by the $4.7 million Lomita Mall
project, which was completed last Friday.
If the sculpture is returned next Wed
nesday as planned, it will arrive before the
May 7 deadline set by the Gay and Lesbian
Alliance at Stanford. May 7 is also the
start of the annual Gay and Lesbian Aware
ness Week planned for the gay community.
Last year 200 protesters gathered at the
statue site to bring attention to the missing
sculpture.
The sculpture is a life-size bronze with
four figures frozen in mid-motion. Two
men stand with one resting his arm on
the other's s'houlder. Two women sit on a
nearby bench, one lightly touching
the other's knee.
"Gay Liberation" was commis
sioned for $150,000 in 1979 by
the Mildred Andrews Fund. The
sculpture was smashed over 40
times by a ball peen hammer
within a month after its unveiling.
After national media coverage of
the incident, it was repaired and
put back in Lomita Mall on June
8, 1984.
The sculpture has been in the
basement of the Stanford Museum
since the last attack in August
1987.
"We recognize that there is a
lot of homophobic violence that
may be targeted at the sculpture,"
Hardie said.
"You have to understand that
the vandalism is violence directed
toward people. It is like chalking
a swastika at Hillel. It is not to
be taken lightly or covered up,"
Hardie added, however, that he
was not concerned about more vi
olence.
