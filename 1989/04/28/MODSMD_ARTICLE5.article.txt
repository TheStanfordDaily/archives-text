# Shultz fields questions and holds forth on foreign policy issues
## 
### Morgan Slain Staff writer 
With a friendly tone and an occasionally
wry joke, former Secretary of State
George Shultz won over a nearly full
Kresge Auditorium yesterday.
For an hour and a half, Shultz, perhaps
Stanford's best-known professor, fielded
a series of wide-ranging queries from a
high-powered panel including Economics
Prof. Kenneth Arrow and Political Sci
ence Profs. Alexander George, Stephen
Krasner and Terry Karl.
Before becoming President Reagan's

Secretary of State in 1982, Shultz served
as Secretary of Labor, Secretary of the
Treasury and Director of the Office of
Management and Budget. He now teaches
in Stanford's Business and Law schools.
Yesterday's question-and-answer ses
sion, billed as a "dialogue" on interna
tional negotiation, was sponsored by the
Stanford Center on Conflict and Negoti
ation, which studies barriers to diplo
matic resolution of conflicts.
The only panelist to challenge Shultz,
if indirectly, was Karl. Introducing her
question, she noted that critics of Central
American policy had accused the Reagan

administration of undercutting
diplomacy in the region by such tactics
as pressuring Mexican and Costa Rican
leaders, by "constantly upping the ante"
in talks with the Nicaraguan government
and by removing U.S. foreign service of
ficials who were making progress toward
peaceful settlement.
At this point, Shultz inteijected with
a laugh that Karl was "engaging in such
a stream of misstatements" that he felt
compelled to interrupt her. The audience
began to laugh. Then Shultz said that
because Karl's list of charges was so long,
he was likely to forget them. And the

audience laughed even harder.
When Karl concluded her question by
asking why negotiated settlement in Cen
tral America was so difficult, Shultz
responded with a lengthy narrative de
scribing his personal experiences with
Daniel Ortega, the president of Nicara
gua.
During secret meetings in Mexico, the
Nicaraguans disrupted the peace process,
he said. They bragged to other Central
American countries that they were not
going to negotiate because Nicaragua was
dealing with "the big guy" â€” the United
States, Shultz said.

The negotiations with Nicaragua
"didn't succeed because they did not act
in good faith," said Shultz.
In response to a question from Alex
ander George about Soviet-American re
lations, Shultz said that he and other
recent U.S. negotiators "did not buy the
very popular and traditional approach of
linkage,"' by which, for example, a trade
issue would be linked with human rights.
Shultz then discussed his views on the
future of U.S. foreign policy. "I think
that the world is shifting gears. There
