# Bunzel survey not sanctioned by University
## 
### Rob Burwell Senior staff writer 
Fearing any association with a
student survey that has been
termed racist, University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy and Provost
James Rosse made it clear yester
day that the administration had
never sanctioned its distribution.
Kennedy and Rosse discussed
the survey conducted by Hoover
Senior Research Fellow John Bun
zel in a meeting yesterday morn
ing with the Council of Presidents.
The survey, entitled "Stanford
Student Survey," came right on
the heels of the University's

Senior Survey, creating some con
fusion.
The survey drew criticism from
the COP Wednesday for contain
ing "leading questions" that
"seemed to have been written in
a way that would get [Bunzel'sl
desired result."
Bunzel was unavailable for
comment last night.
Although the University cannot
restrict surveys of its students,
Kennedy explained in an interview
with The Daily, "The title might
engender some confusion."
"Anybody from Budweiser to
name-your-favorite-local-organ
ization can conduct a survey if

they can get people to fill it out,"
Kennedy said, "but 'Stanford Stu
dent Survey' implies a University
affiliation. This project has no in
stitutional sanction."
Rosse added that because the
survey's distribution came so soon
after the University's Senior Sur
veys, students could be misled by
an official-looking questionnaire
called the Stanford Student Sur
vey. "It is a survey of Stanford
students, not a survey of students
by Stanford," he said.
COP member Stacey Leyton
said she had hoped Kennedy and
Rosse would have made some kind
of statement against the survey.

According to Rosse, "a set of
inquiries by Bunzel in the past
caused us to clarify our policies
about what information about our
students is public and what is
not."
Kennedy added, "We were con
cerned about the use of University
statistics that were compiled for
our purposes. Various offices have
been cautious about what infor
mation they give [Bunzen."
Two years ago, Bunzel used
confidential academic information
compiled by the the Pacific 10
Conference that the University
had agreed to keep secret, Ken
nedy said.
