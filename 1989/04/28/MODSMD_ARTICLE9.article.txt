When the new addition to Tresidder's upper deck
opens on May 18, it will mark the next step in the
$6 million plan to improve the student union.
In an open forum yesterday, Tresidder Student
Union Board Chair Brad Chick and Assoc. Director
of Tresidder Paul Szczesiul unveiled a preliminary
blueprint of the transformation.
The Union Board — an organization of students,
faculty and staff — said it envisions a boulevard
cutting through the center of Tresidder, flanked by
a Pub-style cafe, a flower shop and newsstand and
a housed Patio Grill. Currently, the Patio Grill
operates out of wheeled stands.
However, financial and logistical constraints will
prevent the transformation of Tresidder from hap
pening all at once.
"We are trying to gauge what is the most impor
tant," Szczesiul said. Once the board approves the
finalized plans, the shifting of the Union's stores

and restaurants will be implemented in phases.
The first step involves the relocation of the LOTS
II computer cluster from its present first floor lo
cation to its new space on the newly created second
floor. The Store will replace LOTS.
The former home of The Store will become the
kitchen for the Grand Marketplace, Tresidder's
cafeteria. The Coffee House kitchen will also be
remodeled. Neither kitchen can handle the current
volumes of customers they serve.
The Coffee House will share its remodeled kitchen
with "The Camino Real Cafe," a new student pub
which has also been proposed.
"It will be a place where people can get together,
drink beer and throw peanuts on the floor," said
Chick of the new pub.
Construction may begin as early as next January,
once funding is secured from the University Facil
ities Reserve General Fund and the University con
tracts businesses to operate the new facilities. Other
funding will come from University loans.
