STUDENT LOANS?

Other banks may claim to have quick service and a complete line of education loan programs. But compare
their products and services to ours and you'll see why we re the lender more California students choose.
Service
Do you know where your student loans are? Seriously - many California banks use outside organizations to service
their loans. The result - mass confusion. Where do you call with questions? Who do you send your payments to?

unnecessary confusion. The result - fast, professional service by a concerned and caring staff.
Loan Alternatives

programs they offer.

allopathic medical students...as well as an Alternative Loan Program for families with higher incomes.
