KEPLER'S PRESENTS
Michael Chabon
Tliesday • May 2*B p.m.
Michael Chabon will read from THE MYSTERIES OF
PITTSBURGH. This remarkably polished first novel
establishes the 23-year-old Chabon as one of
America's most promising new voices. In the style of
Catcher in the Rye, THE MYSTERIES OF PITTSBURGH is
a coming-of-age story acted out against a
complicated world of haphazard pleasure and
mystery.
Greil Marcus
Thursday • May 4*B p.m.
In LIPSTICK TRACES: A SECRET HISTORY OF THE 20TH
CENTURY, Greil Marcus takes us down the dark path
of counterhistory, a route of blasphemy, adventure,
and surprise. Join us for an evening with Griel
Marcus as he presents LIPSTICK TRACES, a book which tells a story as
disruptive and compelling as the century itself.
W. S. Di Piero
Thursday • May 11 • 8 p.m.
W. S. Di Piero will read poetry from EARLY LIGHT
and essays from MEMORY AND ENTHUSIASM. The
poems of EARLY LIGHT are finely crafted lyric stories
about the odd ways of grace and desire. MEMORY
AND ENTHUSIASM is a brilliant new collection of essays which draw
us toward fresh encounters with literary artists from both sides of
the Atlantic. Di Piero, Associate Professor of English at Stanford, is a
skillful and fervent interpreter of the productive tensions between
Europe and America.
