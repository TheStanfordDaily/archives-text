# Meese: out of the ethical fray and into Reagan revision
## 
### John Wagner Editorial staff 
Given the fray that surrounded his
departure from the Justice Department
last August, Ed Meese exhibits
remarkably few visible battle scars these
days.
During an interview with The Daily
last week, the former U.S. Attorney Gen
eral spoke about his past with a curious
cheerfulness and lack of vindictiveness.
Meese insisted the charges of ethical
misconduct levied against him during his
tenure were no more than political at
tacks and undeserved smears by the
press. But, for a man who claimed to
have been so "victimized," Meese seemed
eerily accepting of his fate.
Currently a distinguished visiting
scholar at the Hoover Institution, Meese
spends between three days and a week
on the Stanforo campus each month. He
also has a full-time appointment at the
Heritage Foundation, a conservative
think tank in Washington, D.C.

During his monthly stints at Hoover,
Meese has been taking part in seminars,
making speaking appearances and con
ducting research on the relationship be
tween Ronald Reagan's terms as the
governor of California and his terms as
president.
In the unfurnished office in Hoover in
which Meese spoke to The Daily, the
onslaught of charges he faced just a few
months ago as the nation's former top
law enforcer seemed far removed. But,
Meese gave the impression that any ref
uge from the attacks he endured as a
key player in the Reagan Administration
was unnecessary.
In fact, his proclamation of "I'm so
busy now that I don't think about (the
past) much" would almost have been
believable if it weren't for the heightened
enthusiasm Meese exhibited upon dis
cussing the sales potential of his upcom
ing book.
Due to be published later this year,
the book will deal both with the Reagan
Administration in general and with

Meese's dealings in the Justice Depart
ment, he said.
"I'm not going to use the book to
avenge old wrongs or sensationalize in
cidents," Meese explained. "Unlike some
of the other books that have come out
(on the Reagan Administration), mine
will be truthful."
According to Meese, some of these
other books "obviously exaggerated or in
some cases actually misstated the reasons
for what occurred" under Reagan. The
reason for this misrepresentation, accord
ing to Meese, was "the commercial gain
of the author — to sell the book."

Meese declined when given the oppor
tunity to point out specific errors in any
of the books. Throughout the interview,
in fact, Meese tended to talk candidly in
general terms and then balk when pressed
for specifics.
Despite his criticism of earlier books
documenting the Reagan Administration,
Meese confessed his hope that his book
would be a commercial success as well.
"That's why I don't mind this promotion
in the article," he said, laughing.
"But, getting the truth out is the im
portant thing," Meese said. "I think there
will be some things that surprise people.
The book will provide more of an inside
story of what went on in the Reagan
Administration than any book I've seen
so far in terms of the actual decisions
and how decisions were made, how the
White House worked, what went on in
the Justice Department, things like that."
According to Meese, examining the
Reagan Administration as a whole is nec
essary in order to understand the charges
of ethical misconduct that were levied

against him personally.
"I think the two are intertwined," he
said. "The attacks on me were in part
to damage the administration, and there
fore making sure the record is correct
on the whole history of the administra
tion would include making sure it's cor
rect as far as I'm concerned."
An internal report issued in January
by the Justice Department concluded that
Meese had "engaged in conduct which
should not be tolerated of any government
employee, especially the attorney gener
al," and that disciplinary action by the
president would be warranted if Meese
were still in office.
The report cited several violations of
department standards of conduct includ
ing:
• Preferential treatment shown to his
long-time friend E. Bob Wallach, a San
Francisco lawyer indicted in the Wedtech
scandal,
• A 16-month delay by Meese in report


'I think I was the
deliberate vic
tim of a smear
attack by the
press.'
