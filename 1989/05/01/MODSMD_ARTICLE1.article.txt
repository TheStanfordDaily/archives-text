# Meese: out of the ethical fray and into Reagan revision
## 
### John Wagner Editorial staff 
Given the fray that surrounded his
departure from the Justice Department
last August, Ed Meese exhibits
remarkably few visible battle scars these
days.
During an interview with The Daily
last week, the former U.S. Attorney Gen
eral spoke about his past with a curious
cheerfulness and lack of vindictiveness.
Meese insisted the charges of ethical
misconduct levied against him during his
tenure were no more than political at
tacks and undeserved smears by the
press. But, for a man who claimed to
have been so "victimized," Meese seemed
eerily accepting of his fate.
Currently a distinguished visiting
scholar at the Hoover Institution, Meese
spends between three days and a week
on the Stanforo campus each month. He
also has a full-time appointment at the
Heritage Foundation, a conservative
think tank in Washington, D.C.

During his monthly stints at Hoover,
Meese has been taking part in seminars,
making speaking appearances and con
ducting research on the relationship be
tween Ronald Reagan's terms as the
governor of California and his terms as
president.
In the unfurnished office in Hoover in
which Meese spoke to The Daily, the
onslaught of charges he faced just a few
months ago as the nation's former top
law enforcer seemed far removed. But,
Meese gave the impression that any ref
uge from the attacks he endured as a
key player in the Reagan Administration
was unnecessary.
In fact, his proclamation of "I'm so
busy now that I don't think about (the
past) much" would almost have been
believable if it weren't for the heightened
enthusiasm Meese exhibited upon dis
cussing the sales potential of his upcom
ing book.
Due to be published later this year,
the book will deal both with the Reagan
Administration in general and with

Meese's dealings in the Justice Depart
ment, he said.
"I'm not going to use the book to
avenge old wrongs or sensationalize in
cidents," Meese explained. "Unlike some
of the other books that have come out
(on the Reagan Administration), mine
will be truthful."
According to Meese, some of these
other books "obviously exaggerated or in
some cases actually misstated the reasons
for what occurred" under Reagan. The
reason for this misrepresentation, accord
ing to Meese, was "the commercial gain
of the author — to sell the book."

Meese declined when given the oppor
tunity to point out specific errors in any
of the books. Throughout the interview,
in fact, Meese tended to talk candidly in
general terms and then balk when pressed
for specifics.
Despite his criticism of earlier books
documenting the Reagan Administration,
Meese confessed his hope that his book
would be a commercial success as well.
"That's why I don't mind this promotion
in the article," he said, laughing.
"But, getting the truth out is the im
portant thing," Meese said. "I think there
will be some things that surprise people.
The book will provide more of an inside
story of what went on in the Reagan
Administration than any book I've seen
so far in terms of the actual decisions
and how decisions were made, how the
White House worked, what went on in
the Justice Department, things like that."
According to Meese, examining the
Reagan Administration as a whole is nec
essary in order to understand the charges
of ethical misconduct that were levied

against him personally.
"I think the two are intertwined," he
said. "The attacks on me were in part
to damage the administration, and there
fore making sure the record is correct
on the whole history of the administra
tion would include making sure it's cor
rect as far as I'm concerned."
An internal report issued in January
by the Justice Department concluded that
Meese had "engaged in conduct which
should not be tolerated of any government
employee, especially the attorney gener
al," and that disciplinary action by the
president would be warranted if Meese
were still in office.
The report cited several violations of
department standards of conduct includ
ing:
• Preferential treatment shown to his
long-time friend E. Bob Wallach, a San
Francisco lawyer indicted in the Wedtech
scandal,
• A 16-month delay by Meese in report


'I think I was the
deliberate vic
tim of a smear
attack by the
press.'
ing capital gains on the sale of stocks, and'
• Involvement in telecommunications is
sues at the same time he held stock in the
so-called Baby Bell regional operating com
panies.
"Obviously nobody in government has a
lot of time to do everything," Meese told
The Daily. "In the sense that I didn't pay
very much attention to my own private
matters — working primarily on govern
ment business virtually all the time — it
was very hard to maintain personal records
and that sort of thing, and therefore there
were some delays in making some filings
and this sort of thing, none of which was
in any way wrongful or improper.

Tm not going to use the
book to avenge old wrongs
or sensationalize incidents.
Unlike some of the other
books that have come out
(on the Reagan Adminstra
tion), mine will be truthful.'

"I think people pounced upon those kinds
of things and distorted them. So they take
a germ of truth and generalize erroneous
ly"
Meese's perception of the events sur
rounding his departure from the govern
ment is strongly rooted in his belief that
the charges against him were the result of
a political plot to destroy the president's
prestige.
"There's no question that's true," Meese
said. "You have unscrupulous politicans,
particularly some of the people who are
committee chairmen in the Democratic
party, who for political reasons want to
attack a strong conservative and a person
who is effective in putting forward the
president's program and I think I was the
victim of those attacks."
According to Meese, he was only one of
several such targets of political attacks ul
timately directed at the Oval Office.
"It happened to a lot of people," he said.

"(Former national security adviser) Dick
Allen was certainly a victim of that.
(Former Secretary of Labor) Ray Donovan
was a victim of that. (Former Secretary of
the Interior) Jim Watt was a victim of that.
I think there have been a lot of people
over the course of the administration and
usually the closer they were to the presi
dent, the more likely they were to be at
tacked."
The teflon armor worn by Reagan was
the primary reason political foes had to
resort to attacking those around the pres
ident, Meese said. "Ronald Reagan himself
was so hard for the press and politicians
to successfully attack because he was such
a popular president, the most popular pres
ident of the century probably," Meese ex
plained.
Meese's interpretation of the events sur
rounding his exit from Washington also
rests heavily on his perception of the press
as a reckless, predatory monster.
"I think there were a lot of dishonest
press attacks and essentially a distortion
of facts and just plain untruths that were
portrayed in the press," he said. "Partic
ularly since the Watergate days, [the press]
will find anything they can use to attack."
"It's kind of like a feeding frenzy," Meese
explained. "They read each other's stuff
and accept it as though it were true when
actually much of it isn't. ...
"I think I was the deliberate victim of
a smear attack by the press. It wasn't a
conspiracy, but it was just the natural way
the press doesn't do a very good job."
Consequently, Meese contends, the public
was misled about his activities in the Jus
tice Department. "Because of the massive
new coverage and the distortions, any rea
sonable member of the public would have
gotten a very wrong picture of what was
going on," he said.
Nevertheless, Meese said, he never got
the impression that public opinion had
turned against him. To the contrary, he
said, he received a great deal of support
from the public.
"I don't know of any public consensus
[against me]," Meese explained. "I got just
the opposite picture from most people who
talked to me.
"I think most people didn't care very
much at all, but I know a lot of people
who did support me and still support me.

"I can hardly go through an airport with
out somebody coming up and thanking me
or go to a public place or event without
people coming up and telling me what a
bad deal I got from the press and how they
didn't believe the press and how they ap
preciated what I had done."
Meese said he feels he played a substan
tial role in helping Reagan to "literally
turn the country around" and hopes to be
remembered as "an important part of that
successful effort."
Such expectations are realistic, Meese
said. "I think the people who know the
facts and who have looked into the matter
would certainly get that perception and I
would hope that historians would do the
same."
While Meese waits for history to judge
the Reagan Administration and his role in

the administration, he has ruled out a
return to government.
"I've been in and out of government off
and on over the past 30 years and I would
expect that I would remain in the private
sector and pay some attention to developing
a retirement potential," Meese said.
Despite what amounted to an ungraceful
exit from government, Meese said his view
of government service remains untainted.
"I think it's worthwhile," he said. "There
are other values besides just making
money, and both the challenges of the work
and opportunity to serve are attributes.
"I still think that public service deserves
the highest ethical conduct and involves
the best effort that a person can put into
it ... I feel I did that, that I lived up to
those standards. And I think most of the
people who know the situation mostly feel
the same way."

Meese gave the impression that any ref
uge from the attacks he endured as a
key player in the Reagan Administration
was unnecessary.
In fact, his proclamation of "I'm so
busy now that I don't think about (the
past) much" would almost have been
believable if it weren't for the heightened
enthusiasm Meese exhibited upon dis
cussing the sales potential of his upcom
ing book.
Due to be published later this year,
the book will deal both with the Reagan
Administration in general and with

Meese's dealings in the Justice Depart
ment, he said.
"I'm not going to use the book to
avenge old wrongs or sensationalize in
cidents," Meese explained. "Unlike some
of the other books that have come out
(on the Reagan Administration), mine
will be truthful."
According to Meese, some of these
other books "obviously exaggerated or in
some cases actually misstated the reasons
for what occurred" under Reagan. The
reason for this misrepresentation, accord
ing to Meese, was "the commercial gain
of the author — to sell the book."

Meese declined when given the oppor
tunity to point out specific errors in any
of the books. Throughout the interview,
in fact, Meese tended to talk candidly in
general terms and then balk when pressed
for specifics.
Despite his criticism of earlier books
documenting the Reagan Administration,
Meese confessed his hope that his book
would be a commercial success as well.
"That's why I don't mind this promotion
in the article," he said, laughing.
"But, getting the truth out is the im
portant thing," Meese said. "I think there
will be some things that surprise people.
The book will provide more of an inside
story of what went on in the Reagan
Administration than any book I've seen
so far in terms of the actual decisions
and how decisions were made, how the
White House worked, what went on in
the Justice Department, things like that."
According to Meese, examining the
Reagan Administration as a whole is nec
essary in order to understand the charges
of ethical misconduct that were levied

against him personally.
"I think the two are intertwined," he
said. "The attacks on me were in part
to damage the administration, and there
fore making sure the record is correct
on the whole history of the administra
tion would include making sure it's cor
rect as far as I'm concerned."
An internal report issued in January
by the Justice Department concluded that
Meese had "engaged in conduct which
should not be tolerated of any government
employee, especially the attorney gener
al," and that disciplinary action by the
president would be warranted if Meese
were still in office.
The report cited several violations of
department standards of conduct includ
ing:
• Preferential treatment shown to his
long-time friend E. Bob Wallach, a San
Francisco lawyer indicted in the Wedtech
scandal,
• A 16-month delay by Meese in report

deliberate vic
tim of a smear
attack by the
press.'

• Involvement in telecommunications is
sues at the same time he held stock in the
so-called Baby Bell regional operating com
panies.
"Obviously nobody in government has a
lot of time to do everything," Meese told
The Daily. "In the sense that I didn't pay
very much attention to my own private
matters — working primarily on govern
ment business virtually all the time — it
was very hard to maintain personal records
and that sort of thing, and therefore there
were some delays in making some filings
and this sort of thing, none of which was
in any way wrongful or improper.

Tm not going to use the
book to avenge old wrongs
or sensationalize incidents.
Unlike some of the other
books that have come out
(on the Reagan Adminstra
tion), mine will be truthful.'

"I think people pounced upon those kinds
of things and distorted them. So they take
a germ of truth and generalize erroneous
ly"
Meese's perception of the events sur
rounding his departure from the govern
ment is strongly rooted in his belief that
the charges against him were the result of
a political plot to destroy the president's
prestige.
"There's no question that's true," Meese
said. "You have unscrupulous politicans,
particularly some of the people who are
committee chairmen in the Democratic
party, who for political reasons want to
attack a strong conservative and a person
who is effective in putting forward the
president's program and I think I was the
victim of those attacks."
According to Meese, he was only one of
several such targets of political attacks ul
timately directed at the Oval Office.
"It happened to a lot of people," he said.

"(Former national security adviser) Dick
Allen was certainly a victim of that.
(Former Secretary of Labor) Ray Donovan
was a victim of that. (Former Secretary of
the Interior) Jim Watt was a victim of that.
I think there have been a lot of people
over the course of the administration and
usually the closer they were to the presi
dent, the more likely they were to be at
tacked."
The teflon armor worn by Reagan was
the primary reason political foes had to
resort to attacking those around the pres
ident, Meese said. "Ronald Reagan himself
was so hard for the press and politicians
to successfully attack because he was such
a popular president, the most popular pres
ident of the century probably," Meese ex
plained.
Meese's interpretation of the events sur
rounding his exit from Washington also
rests heavily on his perception of the press
as a reckless, predatory monster.
"I think there were a lot of dishonest
press attacks and essentially a distortion
of facts and just plain untruths that were
portrayed in the press," he said. "Partic
ularly since the Watergate days, [the press]
will find anything they can use to attack."
"It's kind of like a feeding frenzy," Meese
explained. "They read each other's stuff
and accept it as though it were true when
actually much of it isn't. ...
"I think I was the deliberate victim of
a smear attack by the press. It wasn't a
conspiracy, but it was just the natural way
the press doesn't do a very good job."
Consequently, Meese contends, the public
was misled about his activities in the Jus
tice Department. "Because of the massive
new coverage and the distortions, any rea
sonable member of the public would have
gotten a very wrong picture of what was
going on," he said.
Nevertheless, Meese said, he never got
the impression that public opinion had
turned against him. To the contrary, he
said, he received a great deal of support
from the public.
"I don't know of any public consensus
[against me]," Meese explained. "I got just
the opposite picture from most people who
talked to me.
"I think most people didn't care very
much at all, but I know a lot of people
who did support me and still support me.

"I can hardly go through an airport with
out somebody coming up and thanking me
or go to a public place or event without
people coming up and telling me what a
bad deal I got from the press and how they
didn't believe the press and how they ap
preciated what I had done."
Meese said he feels he played a substan
tial role in helping Reagan to "literally
turn the country around" and hopes to be
remembered as "an important part of that
successful effort."
Such expectations are realistic, Meese
said. "I think the people who know the
facts and who have looked into the matter
would certainly get that perception and I
would hope that historians would do the
same."
While Meese waits for history to judge
the Reagan Administration and his role in

the administration, he has ruled out a
return to government.
"I've been in and out of government off
and on over the past 30 years and I would
expect that I would remain in the private
sector and pay some attention to developing
a retirement potential," Meese said.
Despite what amounted to an ungraceful
exit from government, Meese said his view
of government service remains untainted.
"I think it's worthwhile," he said. "There
are other values besides just making
money, and both the challenges of the work
and opportunity to serve are attributes.
"I still think that public service deserves
the highest ethical conduct and involves
the best effort that a person can put into
it ... I feel I did that, that I lived up to
those standards. And I think most of the
people who know the situation mostly feel
the same way."

In an interview with The Daily, former U.S. Attorney General Ed Meese insisted the
charges of ethical misconduct levied against him during his tenure were no more
than political attacks and undeserved smears by the press. Meese is currently a
distinguished visiting scholar at the Hoover Institution.
Given the fray that surrounded his
departure from the Justice Department
last August, Ed Meese exhibits
remarkably few visible battle scars these
days.
During an interview with The Daily
last week, the former U.S. Attorney Gen
eral spoke about his past with a curious
cheerfulness and lack of vindictiveness.
Meese insisted the charges of ethical
misconduct levied against him during his
tenure were no more than political at
tacks and undeserved smears by the
press. But, for a man who claimed to
have been so "victimized," Meese seemed
eerily accepting of his fate.
Currently a distinguished visiting
scholar at the Hoover Institution, Meese
spends between three days and a week
on the Stanforo campus each month. He
also has a full-time appointment at the
Heritage Foundation, a conservative
think tank in Washington, D.C.

During his monthly stints at Hoover,
Meese has been taking part in seminars,
making speaking appearances and con
ducting research on the relationship be

governor of California and his terms as
president.

general terms and then balk when pressed
for specifics.
Despite his criticism of earlier books
documenting the Reagan Administration,
Meese confessed his hope that his book
would be a commercial success as well.
"That's why I don't mind this promotion
in the article," he said, laughing.
"But, getting the truth out is the im
portant thing," Meese said. "I think there
will be some things that surprise people.
The book will provide more of an inside
story of what went on in the Reagan
Administration than any book I've seen
so far in terms of the actual decisions
and how decisions were made, how the
White House worked, what went on in
the Justice Department, things like that."
According to Meese, examining the
Reagan Administration as a whole is nec
essary in order to understand the charges
of ethical misconduct that were levied

against him personally.
"I think the two are intertwined," he
said. "The attacks on me were in part
to damage the administration, and there
fore making sure the record is correct
on the whole history of the administra
tion would include making sure it's cor
rect as far as I'm concerned."
An internal report issued in January
by the Justice Department concluded that
Meese had "engaged in conduct which
should not be tolerated of any government
employee, especially the attorney gener
al," and that disciplinary action by the
president would be warranted if Meese
were still in office.
The report cited several violations of
department standards of conduct includ
ing:
• Preferential treatment shown to his
long-time friend E. Bob Wallach, a San
Francisco lawyer indicted in the Wedtech
scandal,
• A 16-month delay by Meese in report

tim of a smear
attack by the
press.'
ing capital gains on the sale of stocks, and'
• Involvement in telecommunications is
sues at the same time he held stock in the
so-called Baby Bell regional operating com
panies.
"Obviously nobody in government has a
lot of time to do everything," Meese told
The Daily. "In the sense that I didn't pay
very much attention to my own private
matters — working primarily on govern
ment business virtually all the time — it
was very hard to maintain personal records
and that sort of thing, and therefore there
were some delays in making some filings
and this sort of thing, none of which was
in any way wrongful or improper.

Tm not going to use the
book to avenge old wrongs
or sensationalize incidents.
Unlike some of the other
books that have come out
(on the Reagan Adminstra
tion), mine will be truthful.'

"I think people pounced upon those kinds
of things and distorted them. So they take
a germ of truth and generalize erroneous
ly"
Meese's perception of the events sur
rounding his departure from the govern
ment is strongly rooted in his belief that
the charges against him were the result of
a political plot to destroy the president's
prestige.
"There's no question that's true," Meese
said. "You have unscrupulous politicans,
particularly some of the people who are
committee chairmen in the Democratic
party, who for political reasons want to
attack a strong conservative and a person
who is effective in putting forward the
president's program and I think I was the
victim of those attacks."
According to Meese, he was only one of
several such targets of political attacks ul
timately directed at the Oval Office.
"It happened to a lot of people," he said.

"(Former national security adviser) Dick
Allen was certainly a victim of that.
(Former Secretary of Labor) Ray Donovan
was a victim of that. (Former Secretary of
the Interior) Jim Watt was a victim of that.
I think there have been a lot of people
over the course of the administration and
usually the closer they were to the presi
dent, the more likely they were to be at
tacked."
The teflon armor worn by Reagan was
the primary reason political foes had to
resort to attacking those around the pres
ident, Meese said. "Ronald Reagan himself
was so hard for the press and politicians
to successfully attack because he was such
a popular president, the most popular pres
ident of the century probably," Meese ex
plained.
Meese's interpretation of the events sur
rounding his exit from Washington also
rests heavily on his perception of the press
as a reckless, predatory monster.
"I think there were a lot of dishonest
press attacks and essentially a distortion
of facts and just plain untruths that were
portrayed in the press," he said. "Partic
ularly since the Watergate days, [the press]
will find anything they can use to attack."
"It's kind of like a feeding frenzy," Meese
explained. "They read each other's stuff
and accept it as though it were true when
actually much of it isn't. ...
"I think I was the deliberate victim of
a smear attack by the press. It wasn't a
conspiracy, but it was just the natural way
the press doesn't do a very good job."
Consequently, Meese contends, the public
was misled about his activities in the Jus
tice Department. "Because of the massive
new coverage and the distortions, any rea
sonable member of the public would have
gotten a very wrong picture of what was
going on," he said.
Nevertheless, Meese said, he never got
the impression that public opinion had
turned against him. To the contrary, he
said, he received a great deal of support
from the public.
"I don't know of any public consensus
[against me]," Meese explained. "I got just
the opposite picture from most people who
talked to me.
"I think most people didn't care very
much at all, but I know a lot of people
who did support me and still support me.

"I can hardly go through an airport with
out somebody coming up and thanking me
or go to a public place or event without
people coming up and telling me what a
bad deal I got from the press and how they
didn't believe the press and how they ap
preciated what I had done."
Meese said he feels he played a substan
tial role in helping Reagan to "literally
turn the country around" and hopes to be
remembered as "an important part of that
successful effort."
Such expectations are realistic, Meese
said. "I think the people who know the
facts and who have looked into the matter
would certainly get that perception and I
would hope that historians would do the
same."
While Meese waits for history to judge
the Reagan Administration and his role in

the administration, he has ruled out a
return to government.
"I've been in and out of government off
and on over the past 30 years and I would
expect that I would remain in the private
sector and pay some attention to developing
a retirement potential," Meese said.
Despite what amounted to an ungraceful
exit from government, Meese said his view
of government service remains untainted.
"I think it's worthwhile," he said. "There
are other values besides just making
money, and both the challenges of the work
and opportunity to serve are attributes.
"I still think that public service deserves
the highest ethical conduct and involves
the best effort that a person can put into
it ... I feel I did that, that I lived up to
those standards. And I think most of the
people who know the situation mostly feel
the same way."

In an interview with The Daily, former U.S. Attorney General Ed Meese insisted the
charges of ethical misconduct levied against him during his tenure were no more
than political attacks and undeserved smears by the press. Meese is currently a
distinguished visiting scholar at the Hoover Institution.
Given the fray that surrounded his
departure from the Justice Department
last August, Ed Meese exhibits
remarkably few visible battle scars these
days.
During an interview with The Daily
last week, the former U.S. Attorney Gen
eral spoke about his past with a curious
cheerfulness and lack of vindictiveness.
Meese insisted the charges of ethical
misconduct levied against him during his
tenure were no more than political at
tacks and undeserved smears by the
press. But, for a man who claimed to
have been so "victimized," Meese seemed
eerily accepting of his fate.
Currently a distinguished visiting
scholar at the Hoover Institution, Meese
spends between three days and a week
on the Stanforo campus each month. He
also has a full-time appointment at the
Heritage Foundation, a conservative
think tank in Washington, D.C.

During his monthly stints at Hoover,
Meese has been taking part in seminars,
making speaking appearances and con
ducting research on the relationship be
tween Ronald Reagan's terms as the
governor of California and his terms as
president.
In the unfurnished office in Hoover in
which Meese spoke to The Daily, the
onslaught of charges he faced just a few
months ago as the nation's former top
law enforcer seemed far removed. But,
Meese gave the impression that any ref
uge from the attacks he endured as a
key player in the Reagan Administration
was unnecessary.
In fact, his proclamation of "I'm so
busy now that I don't think about (the
past) much" would almost have been
believable if it weren't for the heightened
enthusiasm Meese exhibited upon dis
cussing the sales potential of his upcom
ing book.
Due to be published later this year,
the book will deal both with the Reagan
Administration in general and with

Meese's dealings in the Justice Depart
ment, he said.
"I'm not going to use the book to
avenge old wrongs or sensationalize in
cidents," Meese explained. "Unlike some
of the other books that have come out
(on the Reagan Administration), mine
will be truthful."
According to Meese, some of these
other books "obviously exaggerated or in
some cases actually misstated the reasons
for what occurred" under Reagan. The
reason for this misrepresentation, accord
ing to Meese, was "the commercial gain
of the author — to sell the book."

Meese declined when given the oppor
tunity to point out specific errors in any
of the books. Throughout the interview,
in fact, Meese tended to talk candidly in
general terms and then balk when pressed
for specifics.
Despite his criticism of earlier books
documenting the Reagan Administration,
Meese confessed his hope that his book
would be a commercial success as well.
