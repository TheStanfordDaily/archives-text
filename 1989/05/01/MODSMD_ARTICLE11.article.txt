## Alaska criticizes Exxon's cleanup 
### 
VALDEZ, Alaska (AP) â€” Alaska
environmental officials said yes
terday they are frustrated by the
pace of oil spill cleanup efforts in
Prince William Sound and are
pressuring Exxon to be more ag
gressive.
At the same time, a newspaper
reported that a company Exxon
hired for the cleanup is scaling
back its work force at Seward,
outside the sound.
The giant oil company has
promised to clean more than 300
miles of shoreline in the sound
by Sept. 15, but some people are
skeptical.
Today is Exxon's deadline for
providing the state with a plan
for waste disposal and cleaning of
Gulf of Alaska shorelines hit by
the drifting oil.
The 987-foot tanker Exxon Val
dez rammed Bligh Reef on March
24, spilling nearly 11 million gal
lons of heavy North Slope crude
oil as fishermen prepared for their
upcoming seasons and migrating
animals and birds headed into the
sound.
Colleen Burgh, shoreline clean
up coordinator for the Alaska De
partment of Environmental Con
servation, said the company
should be experimenting with new
clean-up techniques and bringing
them to the state for evaluation.
"We get the impression they are
sitting back and waiting for us to
tell them which method to use,"
she said yesterday. "They've been
working two weeks and they don't
even have a mile clean."

"They've got to get more ag
gressive if they're going to get tht
job done," said Burgh.
Asked if she was skeptical Ex
xon could meet its Sept. 15 dead
line, Burgh said that "using the
methods I've seen to date, I'd have
to say yes."

'They've been
working two weeks
and they don't
even have a mile
clean.'

In a letter to Exxon, the state
said the company should examine
all cleanup methods and let state
and federal agencies decide
whether they should be used.
Burgh said she could envision use
of bulldozers to redo the contours
of beaches in some cases.
The state letter was addressed
to Andy Teal, part of Exxon's
shoreline advisory panel. He said
his company was working to make
the cleanup more efficient and had
been talking with state officials.
"We've had a number of discus
sions as to enhancing the opera
tions out there," Teal said. "That
letter came as a bit of a surprise
to me. Those discussions were al
ready taking place."
He said the company was bring
ing in new equipment for trials.
