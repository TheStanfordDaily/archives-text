DEIDESHEIM, West Germany
(AP) — Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher of Britain failed yester
day to persuade Chancellor Hel
mut Kohl to drop his demand that
the superpowers begin talks soon
on cutting short-range nuclear
missiles.
The two leaders, trying to reach
a compromise on a stalemate that
*has split the NATO alliance, de
scribed their talks as frank and
intensive. Both admitted they
could not solve the crisis.
"We still have quite a lot of
work to do," Kohl told reporters
during a news conference with
Thatcher after an afternoon of
talks.
But Kohl said he was optimistic
the disagreement could be re
solved before a North Atlantic
Treaty Organization summit in
Brussels on May 29-30.
Thatcher also expressed op
timism, but stuck strongly to the
U.S.-British position that rules
out early talks with the Soviets
on short-range nuclear weapons.
"Strength must continue not
only in words; strength has to be
translated into weaponry," she
said.
Thatcher's visit to the
Rhineland-Palatinate town of
Deidesheim was aimed at per
suading Kohl to drop his govern
ment's insistence on early talks,
a demand that has placed him in
a battle of wills with Thatcher
and President Bush.
The West Germans believe su
perpower arms talks should be at
tempted on a broad scale because
of the current disarmament

climate in Moscow.
Washington and London main
tain talks on tactical nuclear ar
senals should not begin as long
as the Warsaw Pact alliance has
superiority in conventional forces.
The United States and Britain
also argue that it would be hard
to stop the talks from progressing
to the point where they would
address the total elimination of
tactical nuclear weapons in Eu
rope — a goal of Soviet President
Mikhail Gorbachev.
Under NATO's flexible re
sponse policy, the allies could re
spond to a Soviet bloc attack with
either conventional or nuclear
weapons.
"Short-range nuclear weapons
are absolutely vital for flexible re
sponse," Thatcher said.
Thatcher said elimination of the
weapons would mean that the
"Soviet Union v/ill have achieved
its objective of getting land-based
nuclear weapons out of Europe.
This, I believe, would be dis
astrous for us."
Thatcher at one point appeared
to question whether Kohl was in
favor of an outright elimination
of tactical nuclear weapons. "I'm
sure Mr. Kohl will correct me if
I have misunderstood him on this
issue," she said.
Kohl responded by having his
interpreter read a line from his
speech to Parliament last week in
which he rejected elimination of
the tactical nuclear weapons un
der the present balance of military
forces in Europe.
