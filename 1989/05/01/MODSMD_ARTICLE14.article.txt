SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -
Students and workers fought riot
police with firebombs and rocks
in downtown Seoul yesterday
after troopers blocked a rally
called by and dissident
groups to mark May Day. More
than 2,900 peoplq were arrested.
The clashes were the first
protests on Seoul's streets since
late last year, and they sent ter
rified pedestrians running for cov
er.
In scattered clashes, bands of
protesters battled the 20,000 riot
police deployed to block the rally,
called on the eve of the interna
tional labor holiday.
Police officials, who spoke on
condition of anonymity, reported
dozens of injuries.
In Inchon, west of Seoul, and
in southeastern Kwangju, protest
ers also fought police.
Police fired warning shots into

the air in Sungnam on Seoul's
southern outskirts when about
200 workers and students tried to
firebomb a police station, police
said. Five officers were injured.
Radical students, dissidents and
workers are mounting violent
protests to demand the overthrow
of the government. They also want
higher wages, better working con
ditions and a share in South
Korea's growing economic pros
perity. Most South Korean
workers earn subsistence wages
for long working weeks.
President Roh Tae-woo's gov
ernment has warned it may take
emergency steps to halt strikes,
which have cost more than $3
billion in lost production this year.
Government leaders are worried
that labor unrest could cripple the
economy and foment political un
rest.
Police had no overall figures on

the number of protesters in Seoul,
but it appeared below 10,000.
Rally organizers had claimed that
100,000 people would take part,
but police blocked off outlying
towns near Seoul and prevented
workers from leaving for„khe cap

Riot police guarded bus and
train stations in Seoul to turn
back people arriving for the rally.
They also blocked off the meeting
site.
The worst fighting raged for
about four hours around Yonsei
University, when about 2,000 stu
dents and workers tried to march
past 5,000 riot police surrounding
the campus.
Protesters, many armed with
clubs and iron pipes, marched to
the beat of drums and gongs.
"Knock down the dictatorship
which suppresses the masses!"
marchers chanted.
