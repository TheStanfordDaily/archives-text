Filipino rebel attacks kill fifteen
MANILA, Philippines (AP) — Communist
guerrillas shot and killed two of President
Corazon Aquino's security guards yesterday,
police said.
Two other rebel attacks elsewhere in the coun
try left a total of 15 people dead, officials said.
hi Manila, six men approached the two guards,
Cpl. Troy Lampreya and Pfc. Clemente Requiene,
as they sat in their jeep, authorities said. The
attackers shot them in the head, then dragged
them from the vehicle and shot them again, police
said.
The gunmen warned onlookers not to interfere,
saying they were members of the communist
New People's Army, said Cpl. Rodolfo Janer, a
police investigator. The urban guerrilla group
has killed scores of police and military men during
a 20-year communist insurgency.
Janer said the attackers took an M-16 rifle
from the slain soldiers and fled in a comman
deered jeep.
Lampreya and Requiene were members of the
Presidential Security Group, an elite command

that guards the president and foreign dignitaries.
In Leon town on Panay island, more than 200
New People's Army rebels attacked a military
outpost manned by a dozen government troops
and 10 civilian militiamen, said Maj. Edgardo
Doromal.
Three swept off U.S. submarine
TOKYO (AP) — Three crewmen on a U.S.
Navy submarine fell overboard today when a
wave swept the vessel as it conducted surface
operations in waters off Japan's southwestern
island of Kyushu, and two remained missing,
U.S. military officials said.
One of the men who fell from the 2,145-ton
Barbel was rescued later, the U.S. Forces Media
Liaison Office said in a statement.
It said the rescued man was picked up by the
submarine itself after a search aircraft spotted
him. His identity and condition were withheld.
The submarine was conducting surface opera
tions in international waters when a wave swept
away the crewmen, who were standing watch on
deck, the statment said.
