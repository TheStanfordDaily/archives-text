## Senate softies 
### 
IF AT FIRST YOU don't suc
ceed, try and try again — the
ASSU Senate will let you.
That message was sent to stu
dent groups last week when the
senate decided to allow the Axe
Committee to put its fee request
on the ballot a second time.
It's great that students might
get another chance to revel in
the excitement of the Big Game
Bonfire. It's also great that the
Axe Committee will have another
chance to get the funds to spon
sor this traditional event.
But they lost the first time. In
the ASSU general election two
weeks ago, the student body voted
against the spirit organization.
The new $20,000 request cuts
the committee's budget to the
basics. The Axe Committee dem
onstrated student support for the
"fee re-request" by rounding up
2,000 signatures in 48 hours.
But the decision sends the mes
sage that student groups can be
lazy in the future when stating

their budgetary needs. Student
groups should prune the extras
out of their budgets and cam
paign hard to rally support for
the proposed budget — before the
election.
Also, a -second ASSU election
is less representative than the
first. With fee refunds not at
stake, only students with strong
feelings for or against different
issues vote, warping election
results.
Finally, the senate gets too
much leeway in deciding what
goes on the ballot. Will the senate
be more receptive to a request
by a group that aligns itself with
a similar political stance?
Imagine a year where there is
no runoff. A student group which
loses gets no second chance. Will
they feel the process is fair when
a previous group got lucky due
to a runoff election?
The Axe Committee deserves
its fee request. Students should
get to vote on that fee request.
Once. And once only.
