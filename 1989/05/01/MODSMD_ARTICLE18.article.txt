A SIMPLE "NO." With no
reasonable explanation.
And no room for debate.
That was University President
Donald Kennedy's answer to a
student-initiated suggestion that
a senior class member speak at
this year's Commencement.
Kennedy's reason came down
to a two-word explanation: no
time. He said it was too late for
the University to formulate a se
lection process, choose a speaker
and add the name to the Com
mencement program.
Well, here's a workable time
table: Speaker nominations could
be submitted this week, seniors

could select their top three can
didates and the Senior Class
Presidents could choose the
speaker, all in three weeks.
Before the beginning of June. No
program need be changed.
Here's the University's appar
ent itinerary: Set up one commit
tee to determine a process,
another to set speaker require
ments and a third to select the
speaker. In addition, we need a
task force to spend two years
studying whether a senior
speaker is a good idea.
Where is Sen. Bill Proxmire
with his Golden Fleece awards
when you need him?
