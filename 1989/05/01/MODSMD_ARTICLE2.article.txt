# Trustee's S&L refutes charges
## 
### Brad Hayward Senior staff writer 
The savings and loan institution owned by Stan
ford's newest trustee has denied charges that its
loan practices discriminate against people living in
low-income inner city neighborhoods.
In a written statement received by The Daily on
Friday, officials of American Savings said the com
pany "has never engaged in redlining, nor does the
company condone such practices."
The institution, which was recently bought by
trustee and Texas billionaire Robert Bass, has come
under fire by a group of 16 California community
organizations for the alleged redlining.
Last week the Greenlining Coalition wrote a letter
to University President Donald Kennedy asking for
a meeting to discuss the matter. Kennedy, who was
away from campus much of the week, has not issued
a response.
American's statement was issued in early April
in response to charges levied by the coalition before
the groups addressed Stanford's connection.
According to Edith Adame, legal counsel for the
Latino Issues Forum, one of the 16 organizations,
the coalition has twice written to Bass about the
issue of redlining, but he has not responded. She
added that a senior vice president of American did
write the coalition in response to a recent picketing
of the institution's Oakland branch.
