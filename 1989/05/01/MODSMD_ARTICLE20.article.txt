## Losing touch with 'reality' 
### 
APRIL IITH WAS yesterday, ac
cording to my Daily. I ordered a
subscription so that I could keep
up with the latest-breaking Stanford
news, and now I find that a letter from
a friend would keep me more up to date.
You lose touch when you leave Stan
ford. I went back for a visit on April 18
and people reacted as if I'd been gone
for months. Everyone was depressed. Not
because I was visiting, but because the
Draw was coming up. Whitman House
was having its open house the night I
arrived, and the residents all of a sudden
had unavoidable out-of-house commit
ments.
The Draw just never seemed like a
reason for suicide in my four years at
Stanford. Now the problems I deal with
are different, you see. The problem for
me is no longer drawing a number low
enough to get decent housing, it's drawing
a big enough paycheck to afford a room
of my own. And the first letter of my
last name isn't going to guarantee me a
place in any company, as it guaranteed
me space in classes.
But about losing touch. That's a real
problem. I thought that if I kept up this
column I would be forced to 3tay in the
Stanford mind-frame until June. People
I visited tell me it's as if I never left
because they see my smirk every Monday,
but I don't feel that way.
Every time I fax in my column from
New York or down the street in Laguna
Beach, I don't know whether it will be
printed, whether anyone will like it,
whether they switched my photo with
some road kill to see if anyone would
notice the difference. I am awash in in

securities every week because of this silly
700-word piece, but I still love to do it.
So here's my solution. If one reader
each week would send me a letter here
at home telling me what's going on, what
I should deal with or if any more available
men have shown up on campus, I would
forever be in his or her debt. Also, I
would write back, and that person would
get mail from a certified unemployed per
son in Southern California.
I only received my degree three weeks
ago, but one day is enough to create a
gap from Stanford. I really miss knowing
what my definition is. When people ask
me what I do, I either say, "I'm a col
umnist for a mtgor metropolitan news
paper, and in my spare time I race speed
ing bullets," or I admit to being in pursuit
of a non-secretarial job that doesn't in
volve lifting large boxes marked "Do Not
Stack More Than Eight High."
Saying I'm a student sounds so much
better. "And where do you go to school?"
is invariably the next question. And
"Stanford" has a nice response ring to
it, doesn't it? It's a little too much like
Stamford if your're bragging near Con
necticut, but it still sounds better than
"Pitzer" or "Harvey Mudd." However, "I
graduated from Stanford" doesn't sound
nearly as sweet to me as "I go there" did.
It seemed as if having graduated would
be the greatest thing, but it isn't. I lost
my filter when I finished my 180 units.
It's hard to deal with newspapers that
are only concerned with people killed in
terrible accidents, and not whether the
administration takes alcohol too lightly.
Big news, real news, important news is

a bit too depressing for me.
But it's not that Stanford is so isolated
or so "above all that" that I could avoid
dealing with the outside. Stanford wasn't
my filter. People were my filter, because
they were and are what made Stanford
what it is.
I could talk to friends around the din
ner table, and problem sets took on the
same urgency as the impending dissolu
tion of the ozone layer. If a really serious
problem came up, we could discuss it at
the "O" over a pitcher or three. And if
we really wanted to deal with it, we could
form a letter-writing committee.
I may meet people who are just as
intelligent, just as charming, just as fas
cinating as the crowd at Stanford, and
if I find them all congregated in a place
as beautiful as Palo Alto, I hope it isn't
a nudist colony 'cause I'd love to work
there. But such a hope is unrealistic at
best and probably downright ludicrous.
Please, if any of you have the time,
inclination or the postage, help me slow
down the touch-losing process. Write me,
and I guarantee you'll find a letter in
your box very soon after. Robyn Bezar,

better. "And where do you go to school?"
is invariably the next question. And
"Stanford" has a nice response ring to
it, doesn't it? It's a little too much like
Stamford if your're bragging near Con
necticut, but it still sounds better than
"Pitzer" or "Harvey Mudd." However, "I
graduated from Stanford" doesn't sound
nearly as sweet to me as "I go there" did.
It seemed as if having graduated would
be the greatest thing, but it isn't. I lost
my filter when I finished my 180 units.
It's hard to deal with newspapers that
are only concerned with people killed in
terrible accidents, and not whether the
administration takes alcohol too lightly.
Big news, real news, important news is

a bit too depressing for me.
But it's not that Stanford is so isolated
or so "above all that" that I could avoid
dealing with the outside. Stanford wasn't
my filter. People were my filter, because
they were and are what made Stanford
what it is.
I could talk to friends around the din
ner table, and problem sets took on the
same urgency as the impending dissolu
tion of the ozone layer. If a really serious
problem came up, we could discuss it at
the "O" over a pitcher or three. And if
we really wanted to deal with it, we could
form a letter-writing committee.
I may meet people who are just as
intelligent, just as charming, just as fas
cinating as the crowd at Stanford, and
if I find them all congregated in a place
as beautiful as Palo Alto, I hope it isn't
a nudist colony 'cause I'd love to work
there. But such a hope is unrealistic at
best and probably downright ludicrous.
Please, if any of you have the time,
inclination or the postage, help me slow
down the touch-losing process. Write me,
and I guarantee you'll find a letter in
your box very soon after. Robyn Bezar,

APRIL IITH WAS yesterday, ac
cording to my Daily. I ordered a
subscription so that I could keep
up with the latest-breaking Stanford
news, and now I find that a letter from
a friend would keep me more up to date.
You lose touch when you leave Stan
ford. I went back for a visit on April 18
and people reacted as if I'd been gone
for months. Everyone was depressed. Not
because I was visiting, but because the
Draw was coming up. Whitman House
was having its open house the night I
arrived, and the residents all of a sudden
had unavoidable out-of-house commit
ments.
The Draw just never seemed like a
reason for suicide in my four years at
Stanford. Now the problems I deal with
are different, you see. The problem for
me is no longer drawing a number low
enough to get decent housing, it's drawing
a big enough paycheck to afford a room
of my own. And the first letter of my
last name isn't going to guarantee me a
place in any company, as it guaranteed
me space in classes.
But about losing touch. That's a real
problem. I thought that if I kept up this
column I would be forced to 3tay in the
Stanford mind-frame until June. People
I visited tell me it's as if I never left
because they see my smirk every Monday,
but I don't feel that way.
Every time I fax in my column from
New York or down the street in Laguna
Beach, I don't know whether it will be
printed, whether anyone will like it,
whether they switched my photo with
some road kill to see if anyone would
notice the difference. I am awash in in

securities every week because of this silly
700-word piece, but I still love to do it.
So here's my solution. If one reader
each week would send me a letter here
at home telling me what's going on, what
I should deal with or if any more available
men have shown up on campus, I would
forever be in his or her debt. Also, I
would write back, and that person would
get mail from a certified unemployed per
son in Southern California.
I only received my degree three weeks
ago, but one day is enough to create a
gap from Stanford. I really miss knowing
what my definition is. When people ask
me what I do, I either say, "I'm a col
umnist for a mtgor metropolitan news
paper, and in my spare time I race speed
ing bullets," or I admit to being in pursuit
of a non-secretarial job that doesn't in
volve lifting large boxes marked "Do Not
Stack More Than Eight High."
Saying I'm a student sounds so much
better. "And where do you go to school?"
is invariably the next question. And
"Stanford" has a nice response ring to
it, doesn't it? It's a little too much like
Stamford if your're bragging near Con
necticut, but it still sounds better than
"Pitzer" or "Harvey Mudd." However, "I
graduated from Stanford" doesn't sound
