## Armenian genocide is 'fiction,' not historical fact 
### 
SINCE THE BEGINNING of this
week, the Stanford community
has been fed a bunch of fiction
under the name of "historical facts" by
the Stanford Armenian Students' Asso
ciation. The "documentary" that is
being shown in different locations, the
April 24 letter, and the flier and
pamphlet under doors in our residences
all seem very realistic to the relatively
ignorant audience.
In fact, they do get the job done. If
you are on shaky ground and you have
certain allegations that are based on
fabricated evidence, you want to con
duct a one-sided publicity campaign
where you avoid contact with the
defenders of the other viewpoint.
In fact, those programs that were

attended by Turkish students both this
year and last turned out to be failures
for the Armenians, since they were
called on all their misrepresentations of
the facts.
No Ottoman Government ever
planned or carried out a policy of
genocide against its Armenian or any
other minority population. However,
there was an official policy of reloca
tion of the Armenian population from
the Russian border to the southern
lands of the Empire.
No one denies the major loss of lives
due to harsh weather conditions, dis
ease, famine and lack of resources
during wartime. This relocation was
the direct result of the acceleration of
the Armenian revolutionary movement.

Hitler's widely publicized speech at
Obersalzberg did not contain any refer
ence whatsoever to Armenians. The
Nuremberg trial transcripts demon
strate that the tribunal rejected the
version of the speech with the remark
in question in favor of two more offi
cial versions found in confiscated
German military records.
The most outrageous use of trickery
in the Armenian propaganda is to
present the Republic of Turkey as the
responsible party for events that took
place during the times of the Ottoman
Empire. The two are distinctly sepa
rate entities with fundamental differ
ences in form of government and in
every facet of life. This is a plot which
ultimately aims at threatening the

territorial integrity of Turkey, a coun
try of great geopolitical importance.
Are Armenians trying to garner
support for their cause by committing
acts of terrorism? In the past 16 years,
they have claimed the lives of more
than 50 Turkish diplomats and inno
cent civilians.
If they are so confident about their
correctness, why don't they wait for
objective historians to inspect Ottoman
documents in the archives to be opened
later this year, instead of trying to
rush resolutions past the U.S.
Congress, or misinforming the Stanford
community, for that matter?
