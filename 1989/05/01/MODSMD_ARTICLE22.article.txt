# Pause and reflect on Holocaust Remembrance Day
## 
### 
On the occasion of Yom Ha-Shoah,
(Holocaust Remembrance Day), the
religious leaders of Stanford Associated
Ministries encourage members of the
University community to pause and
reflect on the horror, hate and murder
that was unleashed against the Jews of
Europe during World War 11.
In this somber moment of contempla
tion, we ask that you remember the
consent and indifference which gave
rise to this murder and hatred. Our
hope is that the free reign of terror
and innocent slaughter may never hap
pen again.
Bigotry, enmity and malice continue
to assault many within our own coun
try and throughout our world. The
complicity of our institutional tradi
tions, religious as well as secular, in

this human suffering is painfully obvi
ous. Our religious and moral legalisms
can never adequately alleviate the
human injury that we do.
It takes, instead, a willingness to act
mercifully and justly toward even our
most distrusted enemies. To do less
only conceals the pain we cause one
another. Free speech, intellectual
debate and First Amendment argu
ments, important as they are, do not
fully embrace the understanding and
compassion necessary to address
human hurt. More is required of us.
Despite our pronouncements, we
recognize that our religious communi
ties have often condoned the practices
of hate and separation. We have failed
to act when confronted with cruelty
and vindictiveness. We confess that we
have been part of the problem.
Racial bigotry, sexual exploitation,
national chauvinism and religious in
tolerance are more than historical
problems; they personally and institu
tionally plague even our most conscien
tious efforts to live beyond them. Be
cause of this, we urge people of all

faiths to draw on the best of their
traditions in order to overcome bigotry,
enmity and malice. Otherwise, human
meanness and apathy may engulf and
destroy us all.
