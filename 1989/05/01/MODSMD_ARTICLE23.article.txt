# Foothills are more tranquil without 'bicyclists from hell'
## 
### 
I would like to commend the decision
to ban bicycles from the Stanford Foot
hills. I often visit the foothills, and all
too often last quarter I would be star
tled by the passing blur of a bicyclist
from nell, head bent in racing position,
whizzing past me at high speed.
The foothills are tranquil now with
out the bicyclists. After all, the foot-

hills should be a serene place, not a
race track for cycles.
