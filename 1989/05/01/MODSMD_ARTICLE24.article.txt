# ASSU Commission did a fantastic job on this year's elections
## 
### 
As a Stanford senior having survived
three previous student elections, I
would like to congratulate the Elec
tions Commission for implementing the
smoothest, quickest and most innova
tive election I've experienced in my
time at the Farm.
Unfortunately, The Daily chose to
run an April 25 editorial which dwelt
on several small mistakes rather than
the overwhelming success of the elec
tion. The Elections Commission "was
on the ball"; unfortunately, The Daily
fumbled this one.
