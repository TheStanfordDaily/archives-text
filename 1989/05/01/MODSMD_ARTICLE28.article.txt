## Final Four! Spikers down Hawaii in five to reach national semifinals 
### Chris Crader Senior staff writer 
LOS ANGELES - While Sat
urday night's volleyball match
between Stanford and Hawaii
was a contest neither team
deserved to lose, it was even
more apparent that Scott For
tune's team deserved to win.
Faced with what could have
been the last match of his col
legiate career, the Cardinal
senior took control in the final
two games to lead the second
ranked Cardinal to a 15-11, 8-15,
13-15, 15-12, 15-7 victory over
No. 3 Hawaii in the final of the
Western Regional Selection
Tournament at Gersten Pavilion
on the campus of Loyola Mary
mount.

Cardinal 3, Rainbows 2

With the win, Stanford ad
vances to the school's first-ever
Final Four with a 24-5 record.
Hawaii's season ends with the
Rainbows at 22-7.
Fortune's performance — he
had 33 kills, 20 digs, seven blocks
and was completely unstoppable
down the stretch — was made
even more impressive by the fact
that he was nearly incapacitated
by a mild case of food poisoning.
He, Parker Blackman, Adam
Keefe and Mike Lowe all felt
poorly after eating out Friday
night.
Fortune was forced to come
out of the match for about ten
minutes in the fourth game to
lie down in the bench area and
missed the start of game five
while in the locker room. He
returned to the floor after one
point in the fifth, however, and
provided leadership and fire
power for the Cardinal in the
final game. Fortune passed
every serve nearly flawlessly and
was a sideout machine, at one
point hitting over the Hawaiian
block for five straight kills.
Dan Hanan added 27 kills, 15
digs and nine blocks, including
five solos, and Duncan Black
man had 23 kills, 14 digs, six
blocks and hit .425. John
Alstrom recorded 11 kills and
18 digs and Craig Forsyth had

11 digs and six blocks.
Stanford, which tied for the
Western Intercollegiate Volley
ball Association regular-season
title, lost the league's automatic
Final Four berth on a coin flip.
And while it took wins over the
fifth- and third-ranked teams in
the country, taking five hours,
25 minutes to do it, Stanford is
going to Pauley Pavilion this
weekend.
The pairings have not been
announced but it is likely Stan
ford will meet Ball State and
UCLA will face Penn State Fri
day night in the national semi
finals.
"I'm happy for our guys,"
Stanford Coach Fred Sturm said
after the three-hour, nine
minute match. "We've had a
tough road. . . . The team has
worked really hard."
Stanford ran its record in five
game matches to 5-1 this season.
Hawaii has not won a five-game
match this year.
"I was fairly confident
(throughout the match)," Hanan
said. "There was a time near
the end when we kept serving
Allen Allen and he couldn't pass
well. I don't know if he was ner
vous or what. They had to set
outside all the time and we got
out block up and set up our de
fense."
Stanford served first to open
the match and on the first play,
Duncan Blackman came up with
a dig and Fortune spiked from
20 feet off the net. Kill; point
Cardinal.
Stanford led the whole way
behind good defense and when
Hawaii got to within 12-10, For
syth came up with a pair of
blocks. At 14-11 Fortune and
Duncan Blackman combined to
block Gary Van Sickle and the
first game was over.
The Rainbow Warriors jumped
out to an early lead in the next
game and coasted to 14-6. Keefe
then entered for the Cardinal
and came up with two blocks to
cut the lead to six, but Hawaii
then ran out the game.
Keefe continued to play well
in the third game but the Rain
bows were soon up 5-3. Sturm
then inserted Ryan O'Hara for
Parker Blackman at setter but

Duncan Blackman and the Cardinal qualified for the volleyball team's
first-ever Final Four by beating Hawaii Saturday.
Hawaii kept going to 10-5. (Black
man returned at 8-5).
A Forsyth ace appeared to
change the momentum, but on the
next play Hanan hit a ball off the
blockers' hands and way out of
bounds. Even though the touch
was obvious, and one linesman
was signalling touch, referee Wink
Davenport overruled, calling the
ball out.
A Stanford block cut the score
back to 11-7 and the Cardinal con
tinued to fight, coming within one
at 13-12 on an Allen hitting error.
Allen made amends with a kill for
a point, but then Van Sickle hit
out for 14-13, Hawaii. After a
sideout, however Van Sickle
produced a kill for the game.
Stanford coasted to a 10-3 lead
in a must-win game four and
Sturm elected to give Fortune a
rest. With Ryan Moos playing out
on the floor, and Fortune lying
on the floor being attended to by
trainer Rickey Hayes, Stanford
continued to sideout but Hawaii
eventually closed to 10-5.
Fortune came back in, but
Hawaii kept going behind setter
Lyman Lacro, who had replaced
Poncho Maluo at 4-2. An Adam
Lockwood kill gave the Rainbows
the lead at 11-10, but with the
match slipping away from the
Cardinal, Damien Hardy hit long
for Hawaii.
Forsyth and Alstrom then
roofed Brian Poppinga to make it
12-11, but Hawaii got the point
right back. A bad pass forced
Lacro to lift the ball to make it

13-12, and on the next serve Allen
hit a backrow set about one incK
too long. On game point Hawaii
made another bad pass and no
one was able to hit Lacro's errant;
set over the net. It was now one
game to 15 for the Final Four. •
With Maluo in there for Hawaii
and Moos starting for an absent
Fortune, Stanford got the first
sideout on a throw call. Fortune
returned to the lineup immedi
ately and two Alstrom blocks
made it 2-0. Stanford rolled to a
5-1 lead before Lacro came in foe
Maluo again.
The Rainbows closed to 8-6 but
Fortune and Co. ran it to 11-7{
Lockwood hit into the net, then
Hardy hit into the net on a broken
play and it was 13-7. Forsyth then
came up with his third ace of the
day and it was match point. Pop-;
pinga hit off the block to save one
match point for Hawaii but they
were unable to capitalize as Lock
wood hit a jumpserve way long.
Parker Blackman served, Allen
passed and Lacro set it back tq
him. Duncan Blackman and For-*
tune were there, however, and the
block enabled Stanford to make
reservations for Los Angeles for
the third consecutive weekend.
