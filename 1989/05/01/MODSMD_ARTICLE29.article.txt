# Netters singled out

As far as vacations go, the Stan
ford men's tennis team's stay in
Ojai, Calif., this past weekend
probably doesn't rank up there
with, say, a few days in Hawaii.
Or San Diego.
Heck, a weekend in Toledo
might actually have provided
more excitement than Ojai did
during the four days the Cardinal
spent playing at the Pacific 10
Conference Championships. The
weekend's highlights were few
and far between for the Stanford
squad, which saw its best player
fall in the second round of the
singles tournament.
Actually, Jeff Tarango's match
against Southern California's Eric
Amend provided more than its
share of great tennis â€” at first.
Tar an go, who fell to Amend 0-6,
7-5, 6-4, started off the match
playing like a man possessed.
"JefT was playing spectacular
tennis," Stanford Asst. Coach
John Whitlinger said. "For seven
or eight games, he was playing

probably as well as he's played
all year. He was moving (Amend)
all around, and really controlling
the tempo of the match.
"After that, though, he might
have tried to do a little too much,"
Whitlinger said. Apparently so, for
Amend recovered from his first
set disaster to grind out the win.
Tarango was the third Cardinal
player to be eliminated. Glenn
Solomon bowed 6-0, 3-6, 6-3 to
California's Doug Eisenman in
the first round, and Barry Ric
hards also lost his opening match,
7-6, 6-3 to Danny Marting of Ar
izona State.
Martin Blackman and Jeff
Cathrall both survived Thurs
day's opening rounds, but
Cathrall got no further. Buff Far
row, who had defeated Cathrall
in three tight sets in Los Angeles
a month ago, made it two wins
in as many tries with his 7-6, 6-3
quarterfinal win over the ailing
Cathrall.
"Jeffs [left] wrist is really both
ering him," Whitlinger said.
