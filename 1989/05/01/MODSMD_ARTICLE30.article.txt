# Golfers begin Pac-10s

It wasn't scheduled. It doesn't
have an official, capitalized title
like other sports, such as, The
Big Game, The Big Meet, The Big
R0w....
But, somehow, it seems as
though this is what the rivalry is
really all about. Stanford vs. Cal.
Winner to the postseason, loser
back home to think about next
year and a shot at revenge. That's
exactly what will happen at the
men's Pacific 10 Conference Golf
Championships that start today
in Seattle.
The Cardinal and the Golden
Bears will be competing in a 10-
team field, but the other eight
may as well be window-dressing.
The teams are 4-4 against each
other in head-to-head competi
tion, and the simple fact is that
whichever of the two teams
finishes higher over the fifty-four
holes (thereby "defeating" the
other) will get the tenth and final
berth in the NCAA West
Regionals.
This do-or-die situation is the
result of a lackluster performance
by Stanford at the Cougar Classic
hosted by Brigham Young last Fri
day and Saturday.
A Cardinal victory over Cal or

UCSB would have given them the
series edge they needed to guar
antee a post-season invitation.
Final results: California 1101,
fifth; UCSB 1103, seventh; Stan
ford 1104, tied for eighth.
Coach Wally Goodwin called the
tournament "disappointing," and
cited a letdown in the four, five,
and six spots. "The bottom three
didn't perform at all," Goodwin
said.
This wasted superior perform
ances by Christian Cevaer, Mark
Funseth, and Don Christenson, all
of whom finished in the top fif
teen. Cevaer turned in his typical
brilliant tournament with a one
under-par 215, good for a tie at
fifth; Funseth had "his best tour
nament all year" according to
Goodwin, and was only a step be
hind Cevaer at 216 (sixth); Chris
tenson rode his first-round two
under-par 70 to a 219, good for,
a tie at 14th.
The final hole was a bizarre one
for the Stanford team. Brad Geer
hit the pin on the fly, only to see
his ball ricochet off the green. He
bogeyed. Then Christenson hit a
rare bad iron on 18 to bogey it.
Finally, Cevaer left a six-foot putt
(that would have tied the Cardinal
with UCSB) short by a half-inch.
Despite these mishaps, Goodwin
said the team ended the tourna
ment in a positive frame of mind.
