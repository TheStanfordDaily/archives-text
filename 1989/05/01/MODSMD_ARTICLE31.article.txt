# Baseball finds a groove, topples Arizona twice
## 
### Bruce Sarkisian Senior staff writer 
All season long, they were like
a vial of nitroglycerin, just waiting
for the right moment to explode.
Opponents were able to control
them by handling them gently,
and kept themselves from getting
burned.
But on Saturday, the Arizona
baseball team dropped the volatile
container and Stanford set off a
firestorm in Sunken Diamond,
shellacking the Wildcats 11-3 Sat
urday and 12-5 yesterday as they
won a crucial Pacific 10 Confer
ence Southern Division series
from the conference leader.
Baseball
Cardinal wins two of three
from Wildcats
The Cardinal lost the series
opener Friday 6-5 but kept a glim
mer of postseason hope alive, im
proving its record to 23-27 overall,
10-17 in the Six-Pac. Arizona fell
to 37-14-1, but held on to its con
ference lead at 20-7.
The Cardinal got to starter Jim
Richardson (4-2) early and often
in the second inning and knocked
him out of the game. No matter
what he threw up to the plate
Stanford hitters were right on it,
hitting line drive after line drive
in the eight-run stanza.
David McCarty's two-RBI
single started the scoring for
Stanford, driving in David
Holbrook and Tim Griffin. Frank
Carey also had an RBI single, and
Roger Burnett added two RBI
before Troy Paulsen launched a
three-run home run with two
down.
"I'm swinging the bat as well
as I have since last year," Paulsen
said, referring to his 28-game hit
ting streak last season.
"No matter what pitch they
throw, it looks real big coming
down. You name it, it's fat," he
added.
As he has so many times this
season, Steve Chitren (6-4) came

in to start the final game of the
weekend series and did a superb
job. He threw very few bad
pitches, but the Wildcats took ad
vantage of them, with Kevin Long
smashing a grand-slam home run
in the fifth.
But Chitren had all the support
he needed yesterday to get the
win. Cardinal fans got a scare in
the sixth when Chitren fielded
Greg Fowble's swinging bunt and
threw to first base while falling
down and wrenching his back.
The Stanford faithful held their
breath while Chitren lay on the
ground in pain, but were relieved
when Chitren walked off the field
under his own power. "He'll be
ready to go next weekend, I
think," Cardinal Coach Mark
Marquess said.
Arizona reliever Jason Hisey
was able to control Stanford after
the second, but freshman Steve
Solomon, a defensive replacement
in the third inning, had his num
ber, clubbing a home run and an
RBI double in two at bats.
In Saturday's game, Stanford
helped its cause again by getting
to the Wildcats' starting pitcher
early. Lance Dickson (4-5) held
the Cardinal to one hit through
two innings before catcher Troy
Tallman's two-run home run, his
second of the season, ignited a
six-run third.
The freshmen owned the day
Saturday. In addition to Tal
lman's round-tripper, Holbrook
went 3-for-4 with four RBI, and
he dialed long distance for the
third time this season.
"I was surprised that we got to
Dickson so early," said Paul
Carey, who added his team
leading 11th home run Saturday.
"He was throwing in the high 80s
and spotting his fastball well, but
then he lost it."
Brian Keyser (5-3) threw his
first career complete game for the
victory, allowing three runs on
nine hits. He allowed one run in
the first, third and fourth innings,
but really started to cruise after
his offense staked him to a big
lead.

"I always struggle in the first
couple of innings. I was throwing
outside and they were taking over
the inside part of the plate. After
that, I decided I wasn't going to
let them take over the plate,"
Keyser said.
In the third inning, with one
run already in and the bases
loaded, Keyser struck out desig
nated hitter Randy Bongard on a
3-2 slider to end the inning.
"That pumped up the whole
team. I decided I was going to
throw the heck out of a slider. I
gave him my best pitch and said
'here it is, see what you can do
with it,'" Keyser commented.
Friday's game was a big disap
pointment for the Cardinal as it

took a 5-3 lead into the ninth be
hind superb pitching by Stan
Spencer and clutch hitting by Eric
Cox, Holbrook, and Paul Carey.
Spencer struggled in the ninth
however, allowing consecutive
singles to Alan Zinter and J.T.
Snow with none out.
Chitren came in to fill his role
as the stopper but allowed a first
pitch single to Fowble that tied
the game at five. He then walked
a batter and threw two pitches in
the dirt that Tallman couldn't
handle and Fowble scored the go
ahead and final run of the game.
In its loss, the Cardinal com
mitted two errors, while commit
ting none on Saturday's and Sun
day's wins.

"When we do play good defense,
our whole game improves," Mar
quess commented.
Card note
There were two mild imbroglios this
weekend, both involving seemingly
mild-mannered characters. In the
sixth inning Saturday, Eric DeGraw
ducked to avoid a little chin music.
As DeGraw glared menacingly at the
mound, both benches cleared but the
umpires were able to restore order
before any flesh was marred.
In yesterday's game Wildcat man
ager and kindly old gent Jerry Kindall
got himself thrown out of the game
arguing a play at first. He watched
the rest of the game from the bushes.

to 37-14-1, but held on to its con
ference lead at 20-7.
The Cardinal got to starter Jim
Richardson (4-2) early and often
in the second inning and knocked
him out of the game. No matter
what he threw up to the plate
Stanford hitters were right on it,
hitting line drive after line drive
in the eight-run stanza.
David McCarty's two-RBI
single started the scoring for
Stanford, driving in David
Holbrook and Tim Griffin. Frank
Carey also had an RBI single, and
Roger Burnett added two RBI
before Troy Paulsen launched a
three-run home run with two
down.
"I'm swinging the bat as well
as I have since last year," Paulsen
said, referring to his 28-game hit
ting streak last season.
"No matter what pitch they
throw, it looks real big coming
down. You name it, it's fat," he
added.
As he has so many times this
season, Steve Chitren (6-4) came

in to start the final game of the
weekend series and did a superb
job. He threw very few bad
pitches, but the Wildcats took ad
vantage of them, with Kevin Long
smashing a grand-slam home run
in the fifth.
But Chitren had all the support
he needed yesterday to get the
win. Cardinal fans got a scare in
the sixth when Chitren fielded
Greg Fowble's swinging bunt and
threw to first base while falling
down and wrenching his back.
The Stanford faithful held their
breath while Chitren lay on the
ground in pain, but were relieved
when Chitren walked off the field
under his own power. "He'll be
ready to go next weekend, I
think," Cardinal Coach Mark
Marquess said.
Arizona reliever Jason Hisey
was able to control Stanford after
the second, but freshman Steve
Solomon, a defensive replacement
in the third inning, had his num
ber, clubbing a home run and an
RBI double in two at bats.
In Saturday's game, Stanford
helped its cause again by getting
to the Wildcats' starting pitcher
early. Lance Dickson (4-5) held
the Cardinal to one hit through
two innings before catcher Troy
Tallman's two-run home run, his
second of the season, ignited a
six-run third.
The freshmen owned the day
Saturday. In addition to Tal
lman's round-tripper, Holbrook
went 3-for-4 with four RBI, and
he dialed long distance for the
third time this season.
"I was surprised that we got to
Dickson so early," said Paul
Carey, who added his team
leading 11th home run Saturday.
"He was throwing in the high 80s
and spotting his fastball well, but
then he lost it."
Brian Keyser (5-3) threw his
first career complete game for the
victory, allowing three runs on
nine hits. He allowed one run in
the first, third and fourth innings,
but really started to cruise after
his offense staked him to a big
lead.

"I always struggle in the first
couple of innings. I was throwing
outside and they were taking over
the inside part of the plate. After
that, I decided I wasn't going to
let them take over the plate,"
Keyser said.
In the third inning, with one
run already in and the bases
loaded, Keyser struck out desig
nated hitter Randy Bongard on a
3-2 slider to end the inning.
"That pumped up the whole
team. I decided I was going to
throw the heck out of a slider. I
gave him my best pitch and said
'here it is, see what you can do
with it,'" Keyser commented.
Friday's game was a big disap
pointment for the Cardinal as it

took a 5-3 lead into the ninth be
hind superb pitching by Stan
Spencer and clutch hitting by Eric
Cox, Holbrook, and Paul Carey.
Spencer struggled in the ninth
however, allowing consecutive
singles to Alan Zinter and J.T.
Snow with none out.
Chitren came in to fill his role
as the stopper but allowed a first
pitch single to Fowble that tied
the game at five. He then walked
a batter and threw two pitches in
the dirt that Tallman couldn't
handle and Fowble scored the go
ahead and final run of the game.
In its loss, the Cardinal com
mitted two errors, while commit
ting none on Saturday's and Sun
day's wins.

"When we do play good defense,
our whole game improves," Mar
quess commented.
Card note
There were two mild imbroglios this
weekend, both involving seemingly
mild-mannered characters. In the
sixth inning Saturday, Eric DeGraw
ducked to avoid a little chin music.
As DeGraw glared menacingly at the
mound, both benches cleared but the
umpires were able to restore order
before any flesh was marred.
In yesterday's game Wildcat man
ager and kindly old gent Jerry Kindall
got himself thrown out of the game
arguing a play at first. He watched
the rest of the game from the bushes.

Opponents were able to control
