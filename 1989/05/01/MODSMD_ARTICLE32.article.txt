# The 						'Big Inning' fruitful for Card
## 
### Robert Portnoy Senior staff writer 
The anatomy of the big inning:
With one out, Cardinal Brian
Johnson singles up the middle.
Catcher Troy Tallman homers to
left to bring Stanford even with
Arizona at 2-2. Frank Carey
walks. Roger Burnett singles.
Paul Carey walks. Troy Paulsen's
line single scores Frank Carey.
David Holbrook singles in two
more runs. Tim Griffin knocks in
another with a ground-out.
By the time Holbrook is picked
off second for the third out, the
Cardinal has turned a 2-0 deficit
into a 6-2 advantage, and the six
run third catapults Stanford to
Saturday's 11-3 shellacking of No.
2 Arizona.
More than anything else in
baseball, the big inning can
change — or set — the tone of a
ball game. For the 1989 Cardinal,
big innings have been scarce at
best, and even scarcer in Pacific
10 Southern Division play.
Until this weekend. Stanford
rode big rallies to victory in wins
over the Wildcats on both Satur
day and Sunday, and all this after
a heart-breaking, come-from
behind win by Arizona Friday.
So Saturday's big inning not
only changed the tone of the
game, it changed the tone of the
series.
"Hitting is so contagious it's in
credible. You get a couple hard-hit
balls that fall in, and the pitcher
gets in a rut. They get afraid and
try to pick corners. Then it's a
hitter's count, and the game's not
so tough anymore," Paul Carey
said.
"[Arizona] came in expecting us
to roll over. Beating the best team
in the Pac like that will carry
over the rest of the season," Tall
man said after Saturday's win.
Yesterday's contest made Tall
man lock every bit the prophet.
The Cardinal scored eight times
in the second stanza on the way
to a 12-5 rout.
The win earned Stanford a
season-split with the powerful
Wildcats, and the momentum
should follow the Cardinal to
Moraga Tuesday for its matchup
with St. Mary's.
