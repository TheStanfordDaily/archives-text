# Birch takes Pac-10 singles crown
## Sophomore defeats teammate Graham in all-Stanford final 
### Mark Rogowsky Editorial staff 
Unchallenged by virtually
everyone else in the world of col
legiate tennis, the Stanford wom
en's team finally had a chance to
challenge itself this past weekend
in the Pacific 10 Conference Ten
nis Championships at Ojai, Calif.
Of the five Stanford players
who were entered in the singles
draw, all reached the quarter
finals, three reached the semis
and two did battle in the final.
And the winner was ... Sandra
Birch. The sophomore All-
American bested her doubles part
ner, freshman Debbie Graham, in
a three-set final yesterday, 6-1,
2-6, 6-1.
Those two emerged from Sat
urday's semifinal action which —
for the second year in a row —
was nearly an all-Stanford affair.
Birch blew by California's Sharon
Fletcher 6-3, 6-0 in her match
Saturday.
Fletcher was something of a
surprise semifinalist. She was a
last-second replacement for her
star teammate Karen Shin, who
had to withdraw from the tour
nament.
On the other side of the draw,
Graham scored an upset over

Stanford's own Tami Whitlinger,
the nation's top-ranked player, by
an impressive 6-4, 6-3 margin.
The road to the semis went
smoothly for all the Cardinal
women — until they ran into one
another. Birch dusted UCLA's
Alysia May 6-0, 6-1 in her opening
match. She followed that up with
a 6-3, 6-2 win over Arizona State's
Krista Amend. Her quarterfinal
opponent was teammate Teri
Whitlinger.
Ten Whitlinger handled USC's
Ginny Purdy in her first-round
contest 6-2, 6-1. She then knocked
off the Bruins' Mamie Ceniza 6-3,
6-0 before losing to Birch.
Graham thrashed Arizona's
Danielle Scott 6-0, 6-3 in her
opener. That triumph was fol
lowed by a 6-4, 6-1 win over USC's
Anya Kochoff.
Graham then ran into a familiar
face — Lisa Green — in the quar
terfinals. Green reached that
point with a 6-0, 6-2 win over
Arizona's Betsy Somerville and a
6-3, 6-3 round-two win against
ASU's Karen Bergan. Graham
beat Green 6-1, 6-3 in their quar
terfinal showdown.
Tami Whitlinger took Arizona's
Banni Redhair 6-1, 6-3 in the first
round. She then had no problem

in a 6-2, 6-1 victory over Cal's
Alissa Finerman in her next
match. USC's Lupita Novelo, who
recently beat Lisa Green in
straight sets, fell to Whitlinger by
a 6-0, 6-1 score in the quarters.
In doubles competition, the
Cardinal didn't fare as well. The
Whitlinger twins lasted longer
than the other two Stanford tan
dems. They lost to Jennifer
Rojohn and Karen Bergan of ASU
in the semis.
In their opener they bested
Cal's Lisa Albano and Finerman
by a 6-0, 6-2 score. Their next
match was a 6*4, 6-1 win against
Harriett Knols and Danielle Scott
of Arizona.
Bergan and Rojohn eliminated
Birch and Graham the round
before playing the Whitlingers.
Birch and Graham beat Jill
Hamilton and Luann Klimchock
of ASU 6-2, 6-4 before dropping
a 6-4, 6-3 decision to Bergan-
Rojohn.
Green and Kylie Johnson
defaulted in their first-round
match.
