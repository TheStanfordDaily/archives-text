# Track stumbles in Big Meet

No one ever said 17 was a lucky number.
The Stanford men's track team can attest to
that. For the 18th year in a row, Cal knocked
off the men's team — last Saturday by a score
of 85-78.

Track and Field
Bears 85, Cardinal(M) 78
Bears 86, Cardinal(W) 59

The women, who actually hold a 6-5 series lead
over Cal, lost as well, 86-59.
"Cal is just a better dual-meet team," senior
Ail-American Glenn Schneider explained. "They
are very deep. But just wait two weeks until the
Pac-lOs, the bigger meet. Cal isn't even going to
be near us."
The men's competition stayed close throughout
as both teams interchanged leads. In the second
event of Big Meet, the 3000 meter steeplechase,
Cardinal senior Steve Miller ran away with the
victory, posting a time of 8:50.94. Stanford soph
omore Jason Martin took second.
In the shot put, junior Brian Boggess and
senior Andy Papathanassiou finished first and
second, respectively.
The 400-meter dash, two events after the shot
put, saw Stanford's Marcus Hickerson edge out
teammate James Cramton.
After Nick Rosen and James Kostohryz cap
lured the first two spots in the javelin, Stanford
had a 44-42 lead with only nine events remaining.
But Cal's senior superstar Dave Ottaway saw
that Stanford's lead was shortlived. In what
seemed like a instant replay of the 1500 meters,
Ottaway outleaned Cardinal standout Dave
Strang to take the 800 meters.

The 5000 meters provided the biggest upset
of the day. Cal's Doug Henderson (14:28.26) out
lasted Stanford's James Alborough (14:28.35),
putting the meet out of reach — pending any
unforseen miracles.
No miracles materialized and despite victories
by Cramton in the 200 meters and Schneider in
the discus, Stanford never regained the lead. In
the final tally, the Bears took 12 out of 19 events
and the 85-79 victory.
"We had decided beforehand that we were not
going to let them win one in our backyard,"
sophomore Chris Rae said. "We just didn't get
the breaks we needed."
In the women's meet, Cal avenged last year's
whipping with a 86-59 triumph.
The Stanford women's team, however, was not
at full throttle. Freshman Chryste Gaines, who
already holds the school record in the 100 meters,
did not participate. After trying her luck in the
400-meter relay, Gaines was pulled to rest up a
sore hamstring.
National qualifiers Patty Purpur and Erica
Wheeler both won their events convincingly. Pur
pur triumphed in both the shot and discus. With
a throw of 52-foot-0, she beat out teammate
Debbie Maleug by almost 10 feet. Purpur's discus
hurl of 172-foot-1 bettered Maleug's by well over
10 feet.
In the javelin, Wheeler outhurled her Bear
counterpart, Laura Baker, by over 30 feet.
Besides Purpur and Wheeler, freshman Jodie
Bilotta and junior Venessa Henlon proved to be
bright spots in an otherwise cloudy afternoon.
Bilotta grabbed both the 800 and 1500 meter
titles, while Henlon took first in the triple jump.
"Everyone was a little disappointed," Bilotta
said. "But it wasn't that bad of a day. Everyone
went out there and did the best they could. We
will just have to get them back next year."
