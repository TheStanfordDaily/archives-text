# Leno turnout falls 300 short of ticket goal

### Jon Eisenberg Staff writer 
Comedian Jay Leno did not lure enough
people to Frost Amphitheater for the Concert
Network to break even on yesterday's show,
but hope is not yet lost for students who
dream of seeing big-name acts here.
By only advertising the concert on campus,
professional promoters were testing to see if
Stanford could support mtyor acts on its own.
According to Concert Network Director
Steve Cramer, about 1,700 people attended
Leno's concert, falling about 300 short of the
student group's break-even point. Tickets cost
$12.50 for Stanford students and $15.50 for
general admission.
However, Cramer, a senior, deemed the
event a success. He added that the Concert
Network will have to "sit down and re
evaluate" the results of the show to determine
whether it will try this kind of promotion
again. Regardless of how the Leno show fared,
the Concert Network is still seeking to land

The Concert Network is still
seeking to land major acts at
Stanford, including Ziggy
Marley, Tracy Chapman and
Elvis Costello.

mcyor acts at Stanford, including Ziggy Mar
ley, Tracy Chapman and Elvis Costello, said
Cramer.
However, the group is not certain if it will
launch any more campus-only promotions.
Cramer said the Concert Network was merely
trying to gauge whether the campus-only
promotion was a viable way of promoting
mtyor acts.
concert promoters do not like to put
on certain shows here for fear of competing
with bigger markets like San Francisco, he
explained. So, if Stanford can support mqjor

acts without advertising in the big cities, it
will carve a competition-free niche for itself
in the concert market.
Even if promoters were not satisfied with
the turnout at the Leno concert, the only acts
Stanford could stand to lose are those that
big Bay Area cities like San Francisco could
better support, Cramer said.
Of the 1,700 fans at yesterday's concert,
1,100 people were Stanford students, the big
gest student turnout for any Stanford concert
except Grateful Dead shows..
Of the 18,000 tickets sold for next weekend's
Dead shows, 4,000 were alloted for students.
Student tickets for Stanford's Grateful Dead
concert cost $25.
The promoters of the Grateful Dead, Bill
Graham Presents, prefer to produce the show
at Frost, rather than places like the Shoreline
Amphitheater in Mountain View, because
Frost's setting is a bigger draw, according to
Cramer.
"Our show (at Frost) blows [Shorelinel
away," he said.
