During a Thursday night computer heist, about
10 Macintosh computers were stolen from the Bow
man Alumni House, according to the Stanford
Police.
Detective Keith Viveiros estimated that about
$20,000 worth of equipment was stolen sometime
between closing Thursday night and opening Friday
morning. The police were called in about 7:30 a.m.
on Friday.
Viveiros said police are investigating and that
they "do have a couple of leads that we're going
on." It is, however, "extremely difficult" to uncover
anything in a case of this sort "when the burglars
make a clean getaway," he said. Viveiros declined
to give more details of the robbery because he said
it might jeopardize the investigation.
He added that in computer heists the goods are
often disposed of almost immediately â€” either on
the black market or on the open market. Sometimes
they are shipped out of California or out of the
country, making the case even more difficult.
Computers were also stolen from Bowman over
winter break, but there were "no substantial leads"
in these cases and thus no recovery of equipment,
according to Viveiros.
