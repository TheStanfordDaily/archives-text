# Advocate blames federal housing cuts for rising homelessness
## 
### Ed Pike Staff writer 
Blaming "greed, competitiveness and
individualism" for federal cuts in afford
able housing, Mitch Snyder called on
Stanford students Saturday to actively
improve the plight of the homeless, or
else continue to be part of the problem.
As one of the nation's leading advocates
for the homeless, Snyder told the 200-
person audience at Dinkelspiel Audito
rium that the federal government has
slashed nearly 80 percent of its housing
budget.
"The disappearance of affordable
housing . . . has done the most to put
people on the street and has changed the
face of the homeless" to include more

families and 700,000 children, Snyder
said during the keynote address at the
Stanford "Conference on Homelessness."
Snyder, who left a high-paying man
agement consultant job on Madison Ave
nue in the 19605, began his campaign
for the homeless in 1975. In 1980, he
spent the winter on a heating grate in
Washington, D.C. to understand the suf
ferings of the homeless.
In 1984, he went on a 51-day hunger
strike to force the federal government to
donate a dilapidated building for a new
shelter. Snyder now lives in and operates
this shelter.
Politicans will do nothing without dra
matic action, he charged, because "it is
cheaper to deny their existence than deal

with their needs." Those who do not not
seek change allow people to continue
living and dying in the streets, he said.
Snyder said the role of the university
system has become one that helps create
individuals who amass wealth in high
paying professions while others suffer
without necessities.
Pointing specifically to Stanford,
Synder said, "There is no defense for this
institution. There is no reason for anyone
to be here."
Students must become personally ac
tive and be willing to confront authority,
he continued.
"There is no middle ground" because
compromising with authority keeps
people living and dying on the streets

unaided. "You are part of the solution
or you are part of the problem," according
to Snyder.
The failure to provide the poor with
affordable housing and a decent wage are
outward manifestations of much deeper
societal problems, he said.
"There are some things that everyone
must do," namely, take the government
to task, demand affordable housing, make
personal sacrifices to aid those on the
streets. When we "look away or look
through," he said, "we lose our human
ity."
Snyder told students hoping to make
a difference to "work in a soup kitchen.
If you already do, work more."
There are two food closets — suppliers

of free food to the needy — within a
block of University Avenue in Palo Alto,
as well as a rotating soup kitchen among
local churches.
According to sophomore John Aber
nathy, one of the weekend conference's
organizers, the event was aimed at build
ing student awareness and action to help
alleviate the problem of homelessness.
"We're making this conference heavily
action-oriented," he said, noting that the
proceeds of a Friday musical concert will
go towards building a house in East Palo
Alto next fall.
The conference provided a guide to vol
unteer opportunities at Stanford and be
yond as well as informational resources
on the homeless issue.
