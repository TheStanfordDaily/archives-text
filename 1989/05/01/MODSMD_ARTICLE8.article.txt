Rumor has it that there ia little
or no dating at Stanford, at least
among the heterosexual popula
tion. According to members of the
gay and lesbian community,
things are tough all over.
Last Saturday, X-TV tried to

about it with a special edition of
"Love Links" — X-TV's version

a gay version of "Love Links,"
said the purpose of the program

people do, like that they go out
on dates."
Held before a lively crowd of
20 in a Suites' eating club, the
program's filming ran smoothly,
although one X-TV technician
refused to participate in the gay
and lesbian version.
