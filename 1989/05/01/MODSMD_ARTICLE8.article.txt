# 'Love Links' tapes gay, lesbian episode
## 
### Jason Bloomstein Staff writer 
Rumor has it that there ia little
or no dating at Stanford, at least
among the heterosexual popula
tion. According to members of the
gay and lesbian community,
things are tough all over.
Last Saturday, X-TV tried to
extend their services, improving
the gay dating scene while dispell
ing common misconceptions
about it with a special edition of
"Love Links" — X-TV's version
of network television's "The
Dating Game."
Now in its second year of play
ing matchmaker, "Love Links"
usually has a student posing ques
tions to three anonymous "bach
elors" of the opposite sex. After
evaluating the answers, the ques
tioner decides who seems like the
best date. The victorious "bache
lor" and questioner then are
awarded a dinner for two at a
local restaurant.
The format in Saturday's show
was the same, but this time all
of the participants were members
of Stanford's gay and lesbian com
munity. Both the question posers
and the contestants were of the

same sex.
The show will air May 8 and
11 at 6:30 p.m. on X-TV to coin
cide with Gay and Lesbian Aware
ness Week, May 7-13.
"With this particular show, we
(the stafT of "Love Links") want
to show our support for the gay
and lesbian community," said
senior Sharon Wachs, the show's
producer.
Senior Bobbi Bernstein, who ap
proached Wachs with the idea for
a gay version of "Love Links,"
said the purpose of the program
was to "show that gay people do
the same things heterosexual
people do, like that they go out
on dates."
Held before a lively crowd of
20 in a Suites' eating club, the
program's filming ran smoothly,
although one X-TV technician
refused to participate in the gay
and lesbian version.
According to Wachs, that person
"felt that the show might not
come across well in the commu
nity."
"This person didn't think the
show would be taken seriously and
wouldn't help their (the gay com

munity's) cause," Wachs said.
The absent technician could not
be reached for comment over the
weekend.
Toni Long, one of the female
contestants, said the technician's
protest "brings to light the homo
phobia that exists at Stanford."
While the show's producers ad
mitted homophobia might have
been the motivation behind the
technician's pullout, the person's
absence did not dampen the crew's
high spirits for producing the pro
gram.
Technical director Matt John
son, a junior, said he and his staff
were very supportive of the show,
which he said he believes X-TV
will try again in the future.
"It was a great idea," he said.

"We were behind it all the way."
Overall, the taping went well,
said co-producer Evie Bunn, a
senior. The gay and lesbian ver
sion was "less sexual and more
mellow" than usual versions, she
said, but in general it was much
like a typical "Love Links" pro
duction.
During the taping, the male
questioner asked the bachelors
which "Brady Bunch" character
they liked the most. One said he
liked the housekeeper Alice be
cause "maids are cool." The sec
ond contestant responded that he
liked Greg, the oldest son in the
famous TV family, because "he
was a closet case."
"It was a lot of fun," said the
female questioner, senior Sasha
George. "It was also good for the
community. I hope it will open up
people more to the gay and lesbian
community."
