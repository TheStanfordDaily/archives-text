Kyoto: a symbol of global trend
When the Stanford Center in Kyoto opens in
the fall of 1989, it will be more than the largest,
most sophisticated overseas campus Stanford has
ever built. The Asia-based center for undergradu
ate and graduate teaching, research and training
is a locus for the exchange of ideas between U.S.
and Japanese scholars and scientists.
It will be a symbol of a broad new vision of
the purpose, reach and nature of American ed
ucation in a global context, according to Tom
Heller, professor of law and director of Stanford
Overseas Studies programs.
Together with related trends and developments
on campus, Heller calls the process "the inter
nationalization of the University."
"Traditionally, Overseas Studies has been
looked at as the capstone of a student's educatioal
period. You study a little of the language and
culture, and then go overseas to cap it off," he
says.
"My vision of it is that today's students are
going to be living their whole lives in an inter
national environment, and their first trip abroad
is only an introduction. They're going to be going
back and forth for most of their lives."
From this perspective, he projects, "Overseas
studies centers have to move from being under

graduate programs exclusively dedicated to local
history and culture, to multi-level research and
teaching centers that include a focus on isues
that are aspects of the changing character of the
global system."
