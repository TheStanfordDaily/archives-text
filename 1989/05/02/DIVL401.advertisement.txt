Proposed Constitutional Amendment
To Provide for Increases and Decreases
in General Fees
Association Bill XIX-CA-2
Submitted for Approval
BE IT ENACTED BY THE ASSOCIATED STUDENTS
OF STANFORD UNIVERSITY:
1. That Article V Section 1 Sub-Section B Sub-Section
1 & 2 which currently reads as follows:
1. The Senate must approve a list of percentages by
which the General Fee may be raised and lowered;
these percentages must specifically include zero
and ten percent, and must fall in the range from
zero to 100 percent. Senate approval requires a
two-thirds vote and notice at the previous regular
meeting of the Senate, and must occur no later
than the day before the beginning of the Spring
quarter general election. If approval does not
occur in time, the percentages from the previous
year shall be used.
2. The base amount of a General Fee is the amount
assessed for that Fee in the current fiscal year.
Be replaced by the following:
1. The Senate must approve a list of percentages by
which the General Fee may be raised and lowered;
these percentages must specifically include zero,
ten and twenty percent, and must fall in the range
from zero to 100 percent. Senate approval
requires a two-thirds vote and notice at the
previous regular meeting of the Senate, and must
occur no later than the day before the beginning
of the Spring quarter general election. If approval
does not occur in time, the percentages from the
previous year shall be used.
2. The base amount of a General Fee is the amount
assessed for that Fee in the current year unless it
is modified by a two-thirds vote of the
membership of the Senate. Notice of a change in
the base amount of a General Fee must be given at
the previous regular meeting of the Senate. Such
changes shall not increase or decrease the base of
the General Fee by more than twenty percent and
must be made prior to the end of Winter Quarter.
And, that the following enactment clauses be, and
hereby are approved:
1. Any By-Laws of the Association which are in
conflict with the above Amendment are hereby
repealed.
MAY 3&4
2. The Senate may on a one time basis modify the
base amount of General Fees after the General
election in which this amendment is passed. Such
modifications shall not increase or decrease the
base of any General Fee by more than twenty
percent.
Vote YES for
Constitutional Amendment # 1
To Provide for Increases and
Decreases in General Fees
The Community Service Fund, Program Board,
and Publications Board of the Association allow for
the funding of numerous small student organizations.
It is these organizations which help provide the
diversity of programs and activities which we have all
grown accustomed (a partial list of these
organizations is listed below). Over the past four
years these fees have not been changed to reflect the
increased demands for funds or to deal with
inflationary pressures. This constitutional amendment
allows for modifications to the base amount of these
Fees by the Senate while maintaining checks in the
system which will prevent abuse of the system. The
proposed process will allow the Senate to modify a
fee, but will allow the student body to reverse any
change that the Senate makes during the Spring
General Election.
In supporting this amendment, students will assist
over 150 campus organizations in their efforts to
bring speakers, plays, musical performances and a
host of other activities to campus. In addition,
community service organizations on campus will also
benefit from your support. For further questions,
please give me a call at 725-1463. I strongly urge you
to vote yes on this amendment.

Stanford Axe/
Big Game Bonfire Committee
The Stanford Axe/Big Game Bonfire Committee is a student
organization chartered to support Stanford athletics by
providing support to the teams and continuing the traditions
associated with Stanford sports. We are the legal custodians
of The Stanford Axe when it is at Stanford. We also provide
the leadership and organization of the Big Game Week
activities, most notably the Bonfire, the Big Game Bash, and
the Big Game Sing-off.
Five years ago, when the committee numbered only eight, it
would have been extremely hard for us to attempt so much,
but the committee has grown in those years to a membership
of just under one hundred. We now have the people to
accomplish our goals. In five years we have reinstated the
Bonfire, brought back the historic desk blotter, restored the
lost Stanford Banner to its place at football games, and
instigated a holiday-season canned food drive for the needy.
The Axe/Bonfire Committee will receive some $6,000 in
non-ASSU support next year. Nevertheless, the many
expenses make a fee assessment vital. We feel that the
activities of the Axe/Bonfire Committee, including one of the
most attended events of the year, warrant such an
assessment.

fee, but will allow the student body to reverse any
change that the Senate makes during the Spring
General Election.
In supporting this amendment, students will assist
over 150 campus organizations in their efforts to
bring speakers, plays, musical performances and a
host of other activities to campus. In addition,
community service organizations on campus will also
benefit from your support. For further questions,
please give me a call at 725-1463. I strongly urge you
to vote yes on this amendment.

Stanford Axe/
Big Game Bonfire Committee
The Stanford Axe/Big Game Bonfire Committee is a student
organization chartered to support Stanford athletics by
providing support to the teams and continuing the traditions
associated with Stanford sports. We are the legal custodians
of The Stanford Axe when it is at Stanford. We also provide
the leadership and organization of the Big Game Week
activities, most notably the Bonfire, the Big Game Bash, and
the Big Game Sing-off.
Five years ago, when the committee numbered only eight, it
would have been extremely hard for us to attempt so much,
but the committee has grown in those years to a membership
of just under one hundred. We now have the people to
accomplish our goals. In five years we have reinstated the
Bonfire, brought back the historic desk blotter, restored the
lost Stanford Banner to its place at football games, and
instigated a holiday-season canned food drive for the needy.
The Axe/Bonfire Committee will receive some $6,000 in
non-ASSU support next year. Nevertheless, the many
expenses make a fee assessment vital. We feel that the
activities of the Axe/Bonfire Committee, including one of the
most attended events of the year, warrant such an
assessment.

Proposed Constitutional Amendment
To Provide for Increases and Decreases
in General Fees
Association Bill XIX-CA-2
Submitted for Approval
BE IT ENACTED BY THE ASSOCIATED STUDENTS
OF STANFORD UNIVERSITY:
1. That Article V Section 1 Sub-Section B Sub-Section
1 & 2 which currently reads as follows:
1. The Senate must approve a list of percentages by
which the General Fee may be raised and lowered;
these percentages must specifically include zero
and ten percent, and must fall in the range from
zero to 100 percent. Senate approval requires a
two-thirds vote and notice at the previous regular
meeting of the Senate, and must occur no later
than the day before the beginning of the Spring
quarter general election. If approval does not
occur in time, the percentages from the previous
year shall be used.
2. The base amount of a General Fee is the amount
assessed for that Fee in the current fiscal year.
Be replaced by the following:
1. The Senate must approve a list of percentages by
which the General Fee may be raised and lowered;
these percentages must specifically include zero,
ten and twenty percent, and must fall in the range
from zero to 100 percent. Senate approval
requires a two-thirds vote and notice at the
previous regular meeting of the Senate, and must
occur no later than the day before the beginning
of the Spring quarter general election. If approval
does not occur in time, the percentages from the
previous year shall be used.
2. The base amount of a General Fee is the amount
assessed for that Fee in the current year unless it
is modified by a two-thirds vote of the
membership of the Senate. Notice of a change in
the base amount of a General Fee must be given at
the previous regular meeting of the Senate. Such
changes shall not increase or decrease the base of
the General Fee by more than twenty percent and
must be made prior to the end of Winter Quarter.
And, that the following enactment clauses be, and
hereby are approved:
1. Any By-Laws of the Association which are in
conflict with the above Amendment are hereby
repealed.
MAY 3&4
2. The Senate may on a one time basis modify the
base amount of General Fees after the General
election in which this amendment is passed. Such
modifications shall not increase or decrease the
base of any General Fee by more than twenty
percent.
Vote YES for
Constitutional Amendment # 1
To Provide for Increases and
Decreases in General Fees
The Community Service Fund, Program Board,
and Publications Board of the Association allow for
the funding of numerous small student organizations.
It is these organizations which help provide the
diversity of programs and activities which we have all
grown accustomed (a partial list of these
organizations is listed below). Over the past four
years these fees have not been changed to reflect the
increased demands for funds or to deal with
inflationary pressures. This constitutional amendment
allows for modifications to the base amount of these
Fees by the Senate while maintaining checks in the
system which will prevent abuse of the system. The
proposed process will allow the Senate to modify a
fee, but will allow the student body to reverse any
change that the Senate makes during the Spring
General Election.
In supporting this amendment, students will assist
over 150 campus organizations in their efforts to
