The ability to manipulate DNA fired a revolution that has forever changed
the nature of biology. In this compelling memoir, Nobel Prize-winner,
Arthur Kornberg, a primary architect of the revolution, retraces his major
research campaigns in enzymology. In the telling his story offers a primer
on how important science is done and a fascinating look at some ot the
great biochemical challenges of the twentieth century.
'This is a first-rate book. I had difficulty putting it down. Kornberg is
refreshingly frank and writes with a lively wit as well."
—Paul Schimmel, M.I.T.
