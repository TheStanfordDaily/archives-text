A Saturday morning fire at the High Energy
Physics Laboratory damaged equipment there, pos
sibly delaying the completion of a $170-million ex
periment designed to test Einstein's theory of
relativity in a 1993 space shuttle mission.
According to Marshall O'Neill, associate director
of Hansen Laboratories which operates the lab, the
early-morning fire caused between $225,000 and
$400,000 of damage in a clean room, where equip
ment is assembled in a contaminant-free environ
ment. Officials say the cause of the fire may have
been a faulty water heater mistakenly left on.
For close to 30 years now, scientists at the lab
have been developing gyroscopes for the Gravity
Probe B experiment. The experiment, which is sched
uled to be launched in the space shuttle in 1993,
will test Einstein's theory by studying how the
gyroscopes spin in space.
NASA has deemed the experiment one of the most
important of this century because it will either
confirm the final unproven prediction of Einstein's
theory or show that the theory is incorrect and
incomplete.
The scientists have constructed two gyroscopes,
which are currently the roundest, smoothest objects
on earth.
