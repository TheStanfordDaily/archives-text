# Physics lab charred by weekend fire

A Saturday morning fire at the High Energy
Physics Laboratory damaged equipment there, pos
sibly delaying the completion of a $170-million ex
periment designed to test Einstein's theory of
relativity in a 1993 space shuttle mission.
According to Marshall O'Neill, associate director
of Hansen Laboratories which operates the lab, the
early-morning fire caused between $225,000 and
$400,000 of damage in a clean room, where equip
ment is assembled in a contaminant-free environ
ment. Officials say the cause of the fire may have
been a faulty water heater mistakenly left on.
For close to 30 years now, scientists at the lab
have been developing gyroscopes for the Gravity
Probe B experiment. The experiment, which is sched
uled to be launched in the space shuttle in 1993,
will test Einstein's theory by studying how the
gyroscopes spin in space.
NASA has deemed the experiment one of the most
important of this century because it will either
confirm the final unproven prediction of Einstein's
theory or show that the theory is incorrect and
incomplete.
The scientists have constructed two gyroscopes,
which are currently the roundest, smoothest objects
on earth.
Although no one was hurt in
the fire, it "made quite a mess of
the room," O'Neill said. The in
tense heat melted some of the
plastic in the lab which stores
nearly $1 million worth of equip
ment. However, he said all the
damaged equipment is replace
able.
The fire might set the experi
ment back by as much as three
months, O'Neill said. There is "al
ways a chance" that the research
ers will not make their deadline,
delaying the scheduled launch of
the shuttle, but O'Neill said he
hopes they will be able to make
up any lost time.
The fire broke shortly after 3
a.m. Saturday and was not dis
covered until a research assistant
arrived at 9 a.m.
