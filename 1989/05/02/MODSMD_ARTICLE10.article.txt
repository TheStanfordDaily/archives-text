# Take two: Runoff begins tomorrow with COP up for grabs
## 
### Jonathan Eisenberg Staff writer 
Students will go to the polls
again tomorrow and Thursday to
determine the winners of three
runoff races from last month's
ASSU General Elections as well
as to vote on three new items.
Using pencils and paper instead
of computer ballots, voters will
choose among the various candi
dates and slates for Council of
Presidents and the Student Con
duct Legislative Council. Juniors
will also vote for Senior Class
Presidents.
Assistant Elections Commis
sioner Mike Conte said he does
not expect any problems with the
election. Tallying paper ballots
will take a little longer than with
computers, but results will still
be available that night, he said.

At last Thursday's meeting, the
ASSU Senate voted to include on
the ballot a revised Stanford Axe
Committee fee request, a revised
constitutional amendment regard
ing genera] fee alterations and a
referendum on abortion.
Last week the senate also es
tablished the following polling
sites to be open both election days:
• Green Library, 6-10 p.m.;
• Meyer Library, 8 a.m. - 10
p.m.;
•White Plaza, 8 a.m. - 6 p.m.;
• Physics Tank, 8 a.m. - 6 p.m.;
• Terman Engineering Build
ing, 8 a.m. - 6 p.m.;
• Clock Tower, 8 a.m. - 6 p.m.;
• Graduate School of Business,
10 a.m. - 2 p.m.;
• Law School courtyard, 10 a.m.
• 2 p.m.; and
• Medical School courtyard, 10
a.m. - 2 p.m.

The COP runoff pits The Slate
of the Times, endorsed by the
People's Platform party, against
the Students' Choice slate, sup
ported by Students First.
For Senior Class Presidents, the
Slate for the Nineties opposes a
Kinder, Gentler Slate.
The election for the Student
Conduct Legislative Council will
be re-run completely and will in
clude all eligible candidates from
the general election. There was
some confusion during the last
election as to whether senior
Leonard Adler, who is waiting to
hear if he has been accepted by
Stanford Law School, would be
eligible for the council.
According to Conte, Adler, who
was the top vote-getter in the first
election, can run for the SCLC
post but cannot also run for grad
uate senator as he did before.

Tallying paper bal
lots will take a little
longer, but results
will still be avail
able Thursday
night.

Because of a successful petition
of the ASSU, the Axe Commitee's
fee request will reappear on the
ballot, reduced from $34,000 to
$20,000. The request needs a 50-
percent majority in the election
to pass.
The revised constitutional
amendment, which needs a two
thirds majority to pass, allows the

senate to increase or decrease the
general fee by 20 percent, and
grants matching power to the stu
dent body. Currently students are
allowed to change a fee by 10 per
cent.
A referendum will also appear
on the ballot, which asks voters
whether they support a woman's
right to abortion as legalized by
the 1973 Roe v. Wade Supreme
Court case.
Conte said he expects about
4,000 people to turn out for the
election. However, "considering
fee refunds aren't at stake" the
turnout will probably be smaller
than at the first election, he
added.
All students with current Stan
ford I.D. are eligible to vote in
the runoff election regardless of
whether they voted in the original
general election.
