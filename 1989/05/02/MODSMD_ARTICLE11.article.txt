## New doubts on cold fusion Caltech and MIT researchers unable to verify claims 
### 
BALTIMORE (AP) - Two of
the nation's most prominent sci
ence institutes said yesterday they
have been unable to confirm the
University of Utah cold fusion
claims and they suggested that
errors were made in the Utah ex
periments.
Researchers from the California
Institute of Technology and Mas
sachusetts Institute of Technology
said elaborate and painstaking ef
forts to verify the Utah claims
have all been unsuccessful.
"We have no reason to invoke
fusion to explain any of their
results," Nathan Lewis, a Caltech
chemist, said of the Utah experi
ments. "There is no evidence of
any unknown nuclear process. At
this point, we can find no evidence
of anything except conventional
chemistry."
Papers prepared by MIT re
searchers for presentation today
at the American Physical Society
meeting also reported that
verification experiments con
ducted over a five-week period
failed to detect any fusion reac
tion.

Richard Petrasso of MlT's
Plasma Fusion Center also said
that an analysis of the claimed
flow of neutrons, a product of fu
sion, is "inconsistent" with other
data reported from the Utah ex
periment.
"We're asserting that their
neutron emission was below what
they thought it was, including the
possibility that it could have been
none at all," Ronald Parker, di
rector of MlT's Plasma Fusion
Center, said in a telephone inter
view yesterday.
Parker said MIT researchers
have been working for weeks to
verify the Utah experiments, but
the results didn't hold up when
measured against a standard
known as a Neutron Capture
Gamma Spectrum.
"If (fusion) occurred at all, it
was far below what they deduced
from their measurements,"
Parker said.
On March 23, Utah professor
B. Stanley Pons and his col
laborator, Martin Fleischmann of
England's University of South-

Hampton, reported at a news con
ference that they had achieved nu
clear fusion using a table top ex
periment at room temperatures.
Part of the problem, Parker
said, could be that Pons and
Fleischmann did not directly mea
sure the neutrons released in
their experiment.
"The measurement they made
was an indirect measurement, not
of neutrons directly, but of
gamma rays produced by
neutrons," Parker said.
The two MIT researchers said
in a paper planned for presenta
tion to the conference that the
Utah research apparently misin
terpreted some crucial data on
neutrons.
At an APS news conference,
Lewis said that after the Utah
table-top, cold fusion claim was
announced he, physicist Charles
Barnes and other Caltech scien
tists devoted weeks to a series of
elaborate and carefully calibrated
experiments in an effort to con
firm the findings.
Every effort failed, he said.
