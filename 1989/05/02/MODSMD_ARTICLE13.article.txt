# North judge threatens to declare mistrial over secret document
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - While the
Oliver North jury deliberated for the
ninth day yesterday, the judge raised the
specter of a mistrial if the news media
succeed in forcing disclosure of a sealed
document in the case.
"If you prevail in this matter," U.S.
District Judge Gerhard Gesell told a
lawyer for 10 news organizations, "one
possibility is I must discharge the jury."
The jurors, knowing none of this, re
turned to the courthouse after a second
weekend under the eyes of U.S. marshals.
The jury had deliberated a total of 40
hours before quitting at the lunch hour
Saturday.

The document in question, a stipulation
of facts agreed to by the government and
North, summarizes highly secret "inter
cepts" of intelligence gathered as the Na
tional Security Agency tracked a ClA
assisted November 1985 shipment of
Hawk missiles from Israel to Iran.
North is charged with claiming in a
false chronology that no one in the U.S.
government knew until January 1986
about the missiles. His defense is that
then-CIA Director William Casey and Na
tional Security Adviser John Poindexter
knew about the missiles from the inter
cepted messages but perpetuated the false
story.

Then-President Reagan, when inter
viewed by the Tower investigative com
mission in January 1987, said he did not
remember how the shipment came about.
A month later, he told the commission
that both he and his chief of staff, Donald
Regan, agreed they could not remember
any meeting about a shipment of Hawk
missiles.
The stipulation, an exhibit in the trial,
was included in the material the jury
took into its deliberations on April 21.
But Gesell refused to release it to the
public, and the news organizations filed
a protest with the court.
At a hearing yesterday, Gesell said the

issues were "very, very broad." He
brushed aside an attempt at explanation
by Timothy Dyk, who represents the news
media, including The Associated Press.
Dyk said that "only one document" was
involved.
"It's the only document I treated this
way after 14 months of dealing with over
a million documents," said Gesell.
After the court session, Dyk told
reporters that "the jury has no security
clearance, the jury's free to discuss it,
then the rest of the country ought to see
what the jury has."
The judge did not elaborate on how
forced disclosure could lead to the jury's

discharge.
One scenario might be a protest by the
Justice Department that national security
secrets were about to be disclosed. That
would force Gesell to withdraw the doc
ument from the jury's consideration,
which in turn could lead North's lawyers
to say he could not get a fair trial.
The news organizations' disclosure mo
tion was rejected by Gesell on April 22
on grounds that the stipulation "is a
classified document."
The ruling was appealed and the higher
court sent the matter back to Gesell for
a hearing on national security issues in
volved.
