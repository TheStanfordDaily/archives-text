# Court divides on sex bias case
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - A
sharply divided Supreme Court
ruled today the burden is on em
ployers to disprove sexual stereo
typing when they are accused of
discriminating against women.
By a 6-3 vote, the justices or
dered further lower court hear
ings in a suit against the account
ing firm Price Waterhouse by Ann
Hopkins, who said she was denied
a partnership because of "macho"
attitudes that she did not behave
sufficiently ladylike.

Today's ruling also is a partial
victory for Price Waterhouse. The
court overturned a lower court
ruling that would have placed an
even heavier burden of proof on
the company.
Moreover, only four of the jus
tices agreed on the standards that
should govern lawsuits alleging
sexual stereoptyping.
The absence of a court megority
enunciating clear guidelines is
likely to sow confusion among
lower courts when deciding such

cases.
Justice William Brennan, in the
court's main opinion, said when
someone "proves that her gender
placed a motivating part in an
employment decision, the defend
ant may avoid a finding of liability
only by proving by a prepon
derance of the evidence that it
would have made the same deci
sion even if it had not taken the
plantifTs gender into account."
Justice Byron White also con
curred in today's result.
