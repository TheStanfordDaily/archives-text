Illinois death law struck down
SPRINGFIELD, 111. (AP) - A federal judge
yesterday struck down Illinois' death penalty law,
raising doubts about the fate of 121 prisoners
on the state's Death Row, including serial killer
John Gacy.
U.S. District Judge Harold Baker ruled that
the 1977 law gives prosecutors too much discre
tion in deciding when to seek the death penalty,
violating U.S. Supreme Court directives .
