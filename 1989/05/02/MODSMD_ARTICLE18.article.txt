Braving homophobia,
gay 'Love Links' faces
hard topic with mirth

X-TV IS DOING MORE
than playing Cupid these
days. It is speaking up loud
and clear for an ever-present so
cial scene at Stanford: gay dating.
And the student channel is
doing it in a fun and innovative
way.
Two years ago, knowing how
students bemoan the dating scene
here, X-TV started up "Love
Links," a takeoff of network tele
vision's "The Dating Game."
X-TV tuned into the fact that
the campus single scene is not
always swinging, and found a way
to put Stanford men and women
at ease when the word "date"
pops up.
But the "Love Links" crew took
a progressive step forward by
producing a show that doesn't
just address the social needs of
the majority.
And they should be commended
for tackling an issue that has too
long gone silent.
The crew recognized an over
sight that the network game
show, and society at large, has
yet to acknowledge: Dating isn't
just a heterosexual phenomenon.
Because gays and lesbians here
face the same tough time finding
a loving partner as straight stu
dents, X-TV last weekend filmed
a special "Love Links" edition for
gay and lesbian singles.
The show will air May 8 and
11 at 6:30 p.m. to coincide with
Gay and Lesbian Awareness
Week, May 7-13.
Following "The Dating Game"
format, the three contestants on

Stanford's show try to think up
clever answers to please a ques
tioner — the person who decides
which contestant would make the
best date.
Once the questioner makes the
choice, the newly-formed couple
gets a night on the town — or
at least a free dinner — courtesy
of X-TV.
This episode was no different,
except that a woman questioned
the women, and a man ques
tioned the men.
Improving the gay dating scene
was just one motivation behind
the special edition. The show will
also tackle a more severe prob
lem, campus homophobia.
Although at least 10 percent of
the Stanford population is gay,
homophobia hasn't died at this
university.
Even in an organization that
seems so willing to face the tough
issues of homosexuality and ho
mophobia, there was some dis
sension in the X-TV staff as to
whether a gay and lesbian show
would be a positive statement to
the gay community.
As a result, one staff member
refused to take part in the film
ing of this particular episode.
The show's producer, Sharon
Wachs, emphasized that the staff
member's refusal to take part
was not a result of homophobia,
but does show the difficulty of
dealing with homosexuality, even
among a very tolerant group of
students.
There is no simple solution to
solving homophobia. But a gay
"Love Links" sure is a step in
the right direction.
By presenting gay dating in a
traditionally straight forum, the
show recognizes that straights
and gays are not so different after
all.
Bravo, "Love Links."
