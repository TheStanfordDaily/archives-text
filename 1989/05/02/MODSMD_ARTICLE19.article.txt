Trustee received too
harsh a wrap for his
S&L involvement
It was appropriate that a April 24
article examining the historical context
and modern-day implications of Stan
ford's "Fundamental Standard" of re
spect for the rights of others appeared
next to the article about the Greenlin
ing Coalition's unfounded attack on
the "social responsibility" of Robert
Bass.
Adherence to the Fundamental
Standard and respect for the rights of
Bass would have required that The
Daily exercise more judgment before
prominently displaying these charges
against a member of the Stanford com
munity by a group obviously seeking
publicity for its political agenda.
The primary attack on Bass is the
unsubstantiated assertion that Ameri
can Savings and Loan, which Bass
purchased less than four months ago,
engages in the illegal practice of "red
lining."
If there is evidence that this occurs,
the group which sent the letter should
bring it to the district attorney, not
try it in the press.
Bass has personally vigorously con
demned this practice and, in the brief
time he has owned American Savings,
has taken a leadership role in eliminat
ing it from the industry.
Absurdly, the group also questions
Bass' "social ethics" on the basis that
part of the transaction to acquire
American Savings required the FSLIC
to contribute $1.7 billion to carry bad
loans made by previous management,
which is "more than twice that alloca
ted for aid to the homeless nationwide
next year."
It is also more than what is alloca
ted to stop the killer bees, but that
has nothing to do with Bass' ethics. If
any part of this transaction can be

questioned, it has to be the FSLIC's
judgment, not Bass' ethics, and that
fact is not pointed out in the article.
Bass has a long and significant his
tory of support for Stanford. He is a
member of this community. This does
not mean that he is not subject to
criticism, but it does mean that he is
entitled to the Fundamental Standard
of respect.

Review got less for
economic reasons,
not political ones
Stanford Review editor Norm Book is
amusingly incorrect in implying that "a
lot of bias on campus" is responsible
for the reduction of Review funding in
an April 27 Daily article.
The Publications Board cut their
recommended 1989-90 annual funding
for economic reasons, not political
ones. We thought their $3,000 request
was absurd considering line-items such
as $1,500 to send "free subscriptions"
to off-campus readers and a $750 an
nual phone bill.
It's also worth noting that the
Review prints 10,000 copies of every
issue, yet estimates its readership at
6,000.
For clarity, I should also note that
the $500 recommendation is not yet
official, since it requires ASSU Senate
approval.
Book is more than welcome to argue
his case at that time. However, consid
ering the Pub Board's lack of funds,
granting the Review's entire request
would be like the United Way funding
the Bob Hope Celebrity Golf Tourna
ment.

Even an old family
doctor believed in
right to an abortion
My grandfather, William E. Lock
hart, Jr., was a family doctor for more
than 50 years in Alpine, Texas, a small
town in the Big Bend country of west
Texas. He saw every aspect of the
abortion issue during his long medical
practice. He witnessed the age of ille
gal abortion, and the coming of
legalization.
He was also a fervent, longtime sup
porter of legalized abortion. That his
women patients should have the right
to choose (and that he should have the
freedom to counsel and provide them
with) every appropriate medical option
was something he held almost sacred.
Were he still alive, I have no doubt he
would be greatly impressed and encour
aged by the passionate renewal of in
terest on college campuses across the
nation concerning the right to choose
abortion.

Too many seniors
to be represented
by single speaker
Before we get too carried away plan
ning to have a senior speaker at Com
mencement, perhaps we should reflect
on exactly what it would add to the
ceremony.
Its authors and supporters contend
that such an addition will "enhance"
and "add a certain legitimacy to the
day" by providing a "real student per
spective" from someone "who shares a
common bond" with the students, and
who will "speak for and to the class."

We are puzzled about whom such a
student representaative could be.
What student perspective ought we
seek, and how is such a person to be
chosen? Do you think the senior class
could actually agree on somebody to
speak for "us," especially when this
provides the opportunity for captive
political spouting?
Where is this "common bond" among
the seniors, outside of the cliche
shared experiences of University Food
Service, roommates and Big Game?
What one person embodies that Stan
ford experience for the Class of '89?
Do Business School students share this
perspective, too? How about grad stu
dents in general? Maybe they should
have a speaker "for them" as well.
The Stanford Experience cannot
easily be encapsulated into a single
representative voice. Such speakers are
compatible with the homogeneous expe
riences of high school, and, possibly,
within the smaller, more personalized
departmental ceremonies.
But to attempt this in such a diverse
and plural land as Stanford would only
detract from the coherence, allotted
time and appropriate generality of the
scheduled speakers.

Even an old family
doctor believed in
right to an abortion
My grandfather, William E. Lock
hart, Jr., was a family doctor for more
than 50 years in Alpine, Texas, a small
town in the Big Bend country of west
Texas. He saw every aspect of the
abortion issue during his long medical
practice. He witnessed the age of ille
gal abortion, and the coming of
legalization.
He was also a fervent, longtime sup
porter of legalized abortion. That his
women patients should have the right
to choose (and that he should have the
freedom to counsel and provide them
with) every appropriate medical option
was something he held almost sacred.
Were he still alive, I have no doubt he
would be greatly impressed and encour
aged by the passionate renewal of in
terest on college campuses across the
nation concerning the right to choose
abortion.

Too many seniors
to be represented
by single speaker
Before we get too carried away plan
ning to have a senior speaker at Com
mencement, perhaps we should reflect
on exactly what it would add to the
ceremony.
Its authors and supporters contend
that such an addition will "enhance"
and "add a certain legitimacy to the
day" by providing a "real student per
spective" from someone "who shares a
common bond" with the students, and
who will "speak for and to the class."

We are puzzled about whom such a
student representaative could be.
What student perspective ought we
seek, and how is such a person to be
chosen? Do you think the senior class
could actually agree on somebody to
speak for "us," especially when this
provides the opportunity for captive
political spouting?
Where is this "common bond" among
the seniors, outside of the cliche
shared experiences of University Food
Service, roommates and Big Game?
What one person embodies that Stan
ford experience for the Class of '89?
Do Business School students share this
perspective, too? How about grad stu
dents in general? Maybe they should
have a speaker "for them" as well.
The Stanford Experience cannot
easily be encapsulated into a single
representative voice. Such speakers are
compatible with the homogeneous expe
riences of high school, and, possibly,
within the smaller, more personalized
departmental ceremonies.
But to attempt this in such a diverse
and plural land as Stanford would only
detract from the coherence, allotted
time and appropriate generality of the
scheduled speakers.

Trustee received too
harsh a wrap for his
S&L involvement
It was appropriate that a April 24
article examining the historical context
and modern-day implications of Stan
ford's "Fundamental Standard" of re
spect for the rights of others appeared
next to the article about the Greenlin
ing Coalition's unfounded attack on
the "social responsibility" of Robert
Bass.
Adherence to the Fundamental
Standard and respect for the rights of
Bass would have required that The
Daily exercise more judgment before
prominently displaying these charges
against a member of the Stanford com
munity by a group obviously seeking
publicity for its political agenda.
The primary attack on Bass is the
unsubstantiated assertion that Ameri
can Savings and Loan, which Bass
purchased less than four months ago,
engages in the illegal practice of "red
lining."
If there is evidence that this occurs,
the group which sent the letter should
bring it to the district attorney, not
try it in the press.
Bass has personally vigorously con
demned this practice and, in the brief
time he has owned American Savings,
has taken a leadership role in eliminat
ing it from the industry.
Absurdly, the group also questions
Bass' "social ethics" on the basis that
part of the transaction to acquire
American Savings required the FSLIC
to contribute $1.7 billion to carry bad
loans made by previous management,
which is "more than twice that alloca
ted for aid to the homeless nationwide
next year."
It is also more than what is alloca
ted to stop the killer bees, but that
has nothing to do with Bass' ethics. If
any part of this transaction can be

questioned, it has to be the FSLIC's
judgment, not Bass' ethics, and that
fact is not pointed out in the article.
Bass has a long and significant his
tory of support for Stanford. He is a
member of this community. This does
not mean that he is not subject to
criticism, but it does mean that he is
entitled to the Fundamental Standard
of respect.

Review got less for
economic reasons,
not political ones
Stanford Review editor Norm Book is
amusingly incorrect in implying that "a
lot of bias on campus" is responsible
for the reduction of Review funding in
an April 27 Daily article.
The Publications Board cut their
recommended 1989-90 annual funding
for economic reasons, not political
ones. We thought their $3,000 request
was absurd considering line-items such
as $1,500 to send "free subscriptions"
to off-campus readers and a $750 an
nual phone bill.
It's also worth noting that the
Review prints 10,000 copies of every
