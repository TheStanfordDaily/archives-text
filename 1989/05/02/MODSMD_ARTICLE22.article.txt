## Beware, the sex patrol 
### 
Last Wednesday, April 26, the
Supreme Court heard oral argu
ments for the Webster v. Reproduc
tive Health Services case. It becomes
apparent in reading the transcript of the
arguments that Roe v. Wade is not the
only precedent-setting case that may be
overturned. The decision reached in Gris
wold v. Connecticut is also at risk.
The Griswold case dealt with the con
stitutionality of a Connecticut law that
made the use of contraceptives illegal.
The Supreme Court found this law to be
unconstitutional because it impinged
upon the right to privacy guaranteed in
the penumbras of the first, third, fourth,
fifth, ninth and 14th Amendments.
It is bad enough that Roe v. Wade may
be overturned, but to have the Supreme
Court rethink the Griswold decision is
oppressive. Women would no longer have
any choice whatsoever in the timing of
their pregnancies.
I cannot imagine anything worse than
the government being allowed to regulate
the sex lives of every individual in the
United States. When I am ready to have
children, I will. I do not want the gov
ernment regulating the time when I will
have children and not giving me the op
tion not to procreate. Without legal con
traceptives, before we plan to have sex
we will need to be prepared for pregnancy
and motherhood.
Since pregnancy is something that only
happens to women, the problem of no
contraception would hit women the hard
est. The numbers of unwed pregnancies
would increase, thereby increasing the

number of people below the poverty line,
making children the majority of the poor.
The overturn of Griswold has more
implications than simply placing
restraints on sexuality and procreation,
it also affects the spread of sexually trans
mitted diseases. Barrier contraceptives,
such as condoms, are used to prevent
STDs. Without such methods available,
the number of people who will need to
be treated for sexually transmitted dis
eases will increase. For example, without
the use of condoms, AIDS will claim lives
in the same manner smallpox did before
a vaccine was found.
The overturn of Griswold would be
especially discriminatory toward gay
men. Gay and bisexual men used to be
the highest risk group, along with in
travenous drug users, for contracting
AIDS. However, the gay community, un
like the heterosexual community, has
taken it upon itself to learn and put into
practice methods preventing the spread
of AIDS.
The gay community practices safe sex,
including the use of condoms, which is
why AIDS can no longer be called a gay
disease.
The overturn of Griswold would also
impinge upon the sex lives of gays and
lesbians. If the Supreme Court were to
overturn Griswold, they would have an
even more difficult fight than they do
now in an effort to overturn laws that
violate their individual rights.
In the case of Bowers v. Hardwick, the
Supreme Court has already held intact
one such law, a Georgia statute that made
sodomy "a criminal offense, punishable

by up to 20 years imprisonment." The
Court decided that homosexuals do not
have a "fundamental right" guaranteed
in the due process clause to practice
sexual acts in the privacy of their home,
although this is seldom enforced.
Incidentally, the defendant in that case,
Michael Hardwick, will lead a panel dis
cussion of the case and its ramifications
May 9 at 3:30 p.m. in room 290 of the
Law School.
If the Supreme Court were to deny
that any right to privacy exists within
the penumbras of the Bill of Rights and
the 14th Amendment, the individual
rights, sexual - and- othen»i|e, of every
citizen. o£ the United States, gay or other
wise, would be even morei at risk.
I can envision a society with a special
task force called "the sex patrol." There
would be undercover policemen in every
bush, behind trees, outside windows,
looking for people who were engaging in
illegal sex acts or using illegal contracep
tives.
This scenario is ridiculous. But if the
Supreme Court finds that there is no
right to privacy implied in the Bill of
Rights and the 14th Amendment, what
would prevent states from bringing in
the sex patrol?

including the use of condoms, which is
why AIDS can no longer be called a gay
disease.
The overturn of Griswold would also
impinge upon the sex lives of gays and
lesbians. If the Supreme Court were to
overturn Griswold, they would have an
even more difficult fight than they do
now in an effort to overturn laws that
violate their individual rights.
In the case of Bowers v. Hardwick, the
Supreme Court has already held intact
one such law, a Georgia statute that made
sodomy "a criminal offense, punishable

by up to 20 years imprisonment." The
Court decided that homosexuals do not
have a "fundamental right" guaranteed
in the due process clause to practice
sexual acts in the privacy of their home,
although this is seldom enforced.
Incidentally, the defendant in that case,
Michael Hardwick, will lead a panel dis
cussion of the case and its ramifications
May 9 at 3:30 p.m. in room 290 of the
Law School.
If the Supreme Court were to deny
that any right to privacy exists within
the penumbras of the Bill of Rights and
the 14th Amendment, the individual
rights, sexual - and- othen»i|e, of every
citizen. o£ the United States, gay or other
wise, would be even morei at risk.
I can envision a society with a special
task force called "the sex patrol." There
would be undercover policemen in every
bush, behind trees, outside windows,
looking for people who were engaging in
illegal sex acts or using illegal contracep
tives.
This scenario is ridiculous. But if the
Supreme Court finds that there is no
right to privacy implied in the Bill of
Rights and the 14th Amendment, what
would prevent states from bringing in
the sex patrol?
