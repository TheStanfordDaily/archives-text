## Cash without calling home Campus jobs provide student spending money 
### Nathanael Cousins Staff writer 
Have you ever wanted to dress
up like a carrot? Or a crash
dummy?
Though the opportunity may
not be highly publicized, dress
ing in bizarre outfits for busi
ness promotions is just one of
many ways Stanford students
try to make some money during
the school year.
With the cost of attending
Stanford skyrocketing past
$20,000 a year, many students
seek part-time or temporary
employment to earn some cash
for their quarterly textbook bill
or weekly supply of pizza and
beer.
A check at the Student Em
ployment Office in Financial
Aids or at the Career Planning
and Placement Center reveals
numerous job options, with
various wages, hours and expe
rience requirements.
The campus minimum wage
— currently $6.08 — was estab
lished in the early 1970's and
is a4justed each year based on
the increase given full time Uni
versity staff, according to Mary
Roberts, assistant director of fi
nancial aids. Because of the
minimum wage, most part-time
jobs pay better if they are on
campus.
With much of the student
body working, there is lively
debate as to which jobs are the
best.
To some students, their job is
more than just a paycheck. "It's
an ego thing," says junior Pat
Rollins, who directs the Sunday
ultimate Frisbee league as one
of nine staff members in intra
mural athletics. "It's a real
status symbol to work in IMs,"
Rollins quipped.
"We stress fun down here.
There is not too much strenuous
work involved," Rollins contin
ued. "After all, we oversee the
fun of the University."
Rollins, who began in the IM
department as a referee, is paid
$6.25 an hour to supervise in
tramural competitions, from

horseshoes to softball, and he
gets to drive the "cool" yellow
IM sports cart.
Although Rollins warns of
ficiating can be stressful —
"Watch out for the biz school"
— he said he enjoys the paid
suntan and wouldn't trade his
spot for one in the library or
cafeteria. "I wouldn't call the
job cushy," Rollins said. "We're
doing important work."

'Hashing can be a
social scene.'

One of the most difficult jobs
to get is as a tour guide, giving
campus visitors their first im
pression of the Farm. "Most
guides applied more than once,"
said veteran guide Courtney
Reed, whose enthusiastic voice
can easily be heard over the in
terested babble of 50 foreign
guests.
"The job is a lot of fun. It is
mostly talking, and there is not
much paperwork, just being
yourself," added Reed, who is
now assistant co-ordinator of
the guide and visitor service.
The visitor service employs 30
students as guides, but 60 stu
dents applied for the last eight
openings. Along with the
glamour of leading tours, how
ever, comes service in the
bowels of Hoover Tower at the
information booth, or in the
"cell" at the mouth of the Quad.
"You need to be enthusiastic,
but patient," said Reed, noting
that applications are available
for the busy summer season.
Kathy Campbell of the CPPC
is in charge of keeping the "job
board" updated so she has the
closest look at the variety of jobs
offered to Stanford students.
Dressing up as a carrot for
the promotion of a public mar
ket or as a crash dummy for a
safety meeting are some of the
strangest opportunities she has
seen pass by her desk. She said

she posts eight to 10 new jobs
every day.
"Tutoring is the most sought
after job because it is high
paying," Campbell said.
A nice quiet desk job for six
dollars an hour in a controlled
temperature environment also
sounds good to many students.
"I work in the library because
I need spending money and the
library is one of the easiest
places to work," said freshman
Bill Norfleet, who shelves books
in Green Library 10 hours per
week.
Norfleet, who likes the flexible
hours offered by the libraries,
got the job simply by asking at
the library desk.
Roberts said that of the 600-
700 jobs the Financial Aids Of
fice offers every year, library
jobs are probably the most
sought after.
But if staying in the library
for too many hours gives you a
headache, Kay Gaskin, an ad
ministrative assistant in Uni
versity Food Service, would love
to give you a job as a hasher.
"Hashing can be a social
scene," Gaskin said. "Plus, it is
not during the time people are
normally involved in other ac
tivities, so it is convenient."
Gaskin said food service
employs 350-400 students to
bus, serve and check at meals
— and anyone interested can
get a job. If you don't mind
getting lasagna under your fin
gernails, some hashing jobs pay
up to $7.25 an hour.
One duty many students
would like to perform on the
job is sleep. Sophomore Rob
Johnstone, who often works the
graveyard shift as a critical care
dispatcher at the Medical Cen
ter, gets to nap when he is not
doing homework or arranging
transport for prenatal infants.
Johnstone, who took the job
because he wants to be a doctor,
swears he wasn't in REM sleep
when he was contacted by a
United Airlines Flight searching
for San Francisco Airport. It
was just another night on the
job.
