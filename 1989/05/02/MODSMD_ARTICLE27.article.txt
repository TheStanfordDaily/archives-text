# Institute facilitates dialogue with North and South Korea

In ancient times, the mighty goddess Isis was the
purveyor of divine wisdom for the ancient Egyptians.
Today, a modern version of ISIS — the Interna
tional Strategic Institute at Stanford — is bringing
together the wisdom of top scholars from the East
and West by becoming the first American academic
institution to establish ties with North Korea.
The Institute's newest program, the Project on
Peace and Cooperation in the Asian-Pacific Region,
examines policies that could promote peaceful
cooperation in that region. The project began in
1984 as a joint effort of the Stanford Center for
International Security and Arms Control and the
Northeast Asia-United States Forum on Interna
tional Policy.
The project studies security issues affecting the
major powers of the Asian-Pacific region: Korea,
China, Japan, and the Soviet Union. Recently, the
project has taken aim squarely at Korea.
According to Kyongsoo Lho, a South Korean
scholar at ISIS, Korea is important because it "is
the linchpin in Asia's geopolitical sphere. All four
powers are focused in or around the Korean
Peninsula.
"Because of the strategic position of the region,
conflict on the Korean peninsula would mean in
volvement of the superpowers," he added.
Assoc. Director of ISIS Gordon Chang said the
project made the agreement to "conduct regular
exchanges on issues related to the Korean Peninsula
and the United States" during an unprecedented
visit to Pyongyang, North Korea in October.
The exchanges continued in March when three
scholars from the Institute for Disarmament and
Peace in North Korea visited Stanford for private
meetings with ISIS scholars.
Meetings like these indicate North Korea's will
ingness to consider peaceful solutions to the hostile
situation which has persisted in that area since the
Korean War. Members of the project said such ex
changes are valuable because of the neutral, facilitat
ing role played by academics.
The project's work in North and South Korea
represents "the effort of non-governmental special
ists to study the security problems and hopefully
to contribute to defining policies that will contribute
to a more peaceful environment," Chang explained.
He added that scholars can do this because they
have more time and are not affected by diplomatic
procedure, legacies of the past, current policies and
general governmental sensitivities.
The project members complemented their visit to
Pyongyang by a December visit to Seoul, South
Korea. The Stanford delegation met with Korean

scholars, members of the military, and foreign min
isters to discuss the future of the peninsula, U.S.-
Korean relations, regional economic and political
development, and East-West arms control issues.
Lho and Chang both said the South Koreans gave
the delegation a warm reception. "The South
Koreans are very positive about ISIS's role as a
catalyst and as an honest broker."
Chang said he found that "both North and South
Korea are interested in ways to improve their re
lations, they're interested in improving their rela
tionship with the U.S., and they're giving thought
and attention to how to make Korea more prosperous
and stable."
As Lho said, "There is a new atmosphere in
Northeast Asia, and given this context, South Korea
is taking measures to open up relations."
Contributing to the new atmosphere of change is
South Korea's emergence as a confident and growing
power. "The Olympics confirmed South Korea's im
portance in the world, and the absence of disruptive
incidents inspired by North Korea was signaling
that North Korea wanted to act responsibly as well,"
Chang said.
Korea's new status as an economic powerhouse
makes active attempts at cooperation possible. The
formalization of bilateral trade ties between the
USSR and South Korea, the construction of Soviet
ships in Hyundai shipyards, and South Korea's eco
nomic aid to Hungary — the first Socialist country
to engage in full open diplomatic relations with
South Korea — all bode well for a future free of
hostilities between the two nations.
What the implications of these developments are
is a question the project hopes to answer, Lho said.
But, according to Ambassador James Goodby, a
member of, arms control center and project partic
ipant, despite all the economic progress, the "concept
infrastructure (of cooperation) is not really thought
through."
Goodby said that before North and South Korea
can establish a truly peaceful relationship, they
need to accomplish three things: 1) begin talks, 2)
build confidence, and 3) seek to negotiate troop
reductions.
Project members have also been consulting with
academics from other interested nations. In June
of last year, members of the project flew to Alma-
Ata, Kazakhstan, in the Asian Republic of the Soviet
Union to attend a special meeting sponsored by
ISIS and the USSR's Institute of Far Eastern
Studies.
Alma-Ata was "selected because it represented a
crossroads between the East and West," Chang said.

Alma-Ata was "selected because it represented a
crossroads between the East and West," Chang said.

In ancient times, the mighty goddess Isis was the
purveyor of divine wisdom for the ancient Egyptians.
Today, a modern version of ISIS — the Interna
tional Strategic Institute at Stanford — is bringing
together the wisdom of top scholars from the East
and West by becoming the first American academic
institution to establish ties with North Korea.
The Institute's newest program, the Project on
Peace and Cooperation in the Asian-Pacific Region,
examines policies that could promote peaceful
cooperation in that region. The project began in
1984 as a joint effort of the Stanford Center for
International Security and Arms Control and the
Northeast Asia-United States Forum on Interna
tional Policy.
The project studies security issues affecting the
major powers of the Asian-Pacific region: Korea,
China, Japan, and the Soviet Union. Recently, the
project has taken aim squarely at Korea.
According to Kyongsoo Lho, a South Korean
scholar at ISIS, Korea is important because it "is
the linchpin in Asia's geopolitical sphere. All four
powers are focused in or around the Korean
Peninsula.
"Because of the strategic position of the region,
conflict on the Korean peninsula would mean in
volvement of the superpowers," he added.
Assoc. Director of ISIS Gordon Chang said the
project made the agreement to "conduct regular
exchanges on issues related to the Korean Peninsula
and the United States" during an unprecedented
visit to Pyongyang, North Korea in October.
The exchanges continued in March when three
scholars from the Institute for Disarmament and
Peace in North Korea visited Stanford for private
meetings with ISIS scholars.
Meetings like these indicate North Korea's will
ingness to consider peaceful solutions to the hostile
situation which has persisted in that area since the
Korean War. Members of the project said such ex
changes are valuable because of the neutral, facilitat
ing role played by academics.
The project's work in North and South Korea
represents "the effort of non-governmental special
ists to study the security problems and hopefully
to contribute to defining policies that will contribute
to a more peaceful environment," Chang explained.
He added that scholars can do this because they
have more time and are not affected by diplomatic
procedure, legacies of the past, current policies and
general governmental sensitivities.
The project members complemented their visit to
Pyongyang by a December visit to Seoul, South
Korea. The Stanford delegation met with Korean

scholars, members of the military, and foreign min
isters to discuss the future of the peninsula, U.S.-
Korean relations, regional economic and political
development, and East-West arms control issues.
Lho and Chang both said the South Koreans gave
the delegation a warm reception. "The South
Koreans are very positive about ISIS's role as a
catalyst and as an honest broker."
Chang said he found that "both North and South
Korea are interested in ways to improve their re
lations, they're interested in improving their rela
tionship with the U.S., and they're giving thought
and attention to how to make Korea more prosperous
and stable."
As Lho said, "There is a new atmosphere in
Northeast Asia, and given this context, South Korea
is taking measures to open up relations."
Contributing to the new atmosphere of change is
South Korea's emergence as a confident and growing
power. "The Olympics confirmed South Korea's im
portance in the world, and the absence of disruptive
incidents inspired by North Korea was signaling
that North Korea wanted to act responsibly as well,"
Chang said.
Korea's new status as an economic powerhouse
makes active attempts at cooperation possible. The
formalization of bilateral trade ties between the
USSR and South Korea, the construction of Soviet
ships in Hyundai shipyards, and South Korea's eco
nomic aid to Hungary — the first Socialist country
to engage in full open diplomatic relations with
South Korea — all bode well for a future free of
hostilities between the two nations.
What the implications of these developments are
is a question the project hopes to answer, Lho said.
But, according to Ambassador James Goodby, a
member of, arms control center and project partic
ipant, despite all the economic progress, the "concept
infrastructure (of cooperation) is not really thought
through."
Goodby said that before North and South Korea
can establish a truly peaceful relationship, they
need to accomplish three things: 1) begin talks, 2)
build confidence, and 3) seek to negotiate troop
reductions.
Project members have also been consulting with
academics from other interested nations. In June
of last year, members of the project flew to Alma-
Ata, Kazakhstan, in the Asian Republic of the Soviet
Union to attend a special meeting sponsored by
ISIS and the USSR's Institute of Far Eastern
Studies.
Alma-Ata was "selected because it represented a
crossroads between the East and West," Chang said.
