Elie Wiesel teaches that some events are
false even if they happened, while others are
true even if they did not. George Perec's "W
or The Memory of Childhood" bears out this
maxim on both counts.
Published in France in 1975 and only re
cently translated into English, its chapters
alternate between two stories. "W" is a parable
of the world of the death camps, while "The
Memory of Childhood" recounts Perec's youth,
one spent hiding his Jewish identity in Nazi
occupied France after his father was killed
and his mother deported to Auschwitz.
Riddled with gaps, distortions and fantasies,
Perec's memory cannot accommodate a reality
incomprehensible to him as a child, and no
less impenetrable to him as an adult.
Therefore, when Perec recollects, he cor
rects himself in end notes to chapters which
run longer than the chapters themselves. The
effect is to thematize the process of remem
bering.
Perec wants to retrieve himself from those
"mindless mists where shadows swirl," as
Book One's epigraph announces. But the
epigraph asks the further question "how could
I pierce it?", and accordingly, the book, rather
than piercing, meditates on the question:
What might it mean to pierce through to the
essence of a child whose formative years were
a living lie, hiding from Germans under a
false identity? How to pierce a mist which
shrouds only Absence?
Perec wonders whether perhaps there "was
no past" since he must "reconstruct it arbi
trarily." The divide between fact and fiction
narrows once fact eludes comprehension. He
thus resorts to a fictional tale, "W" to sup
plement his memories of childhood.
"W" is a parable of a totalitarian dystopia
and is, according to Perec, "if not the story
of my childhood, then at least a story of my
childhood." Weaving the parable and memoir
into "a crisscross web," threads of Perec's two
narratives intertwine, generating stories out
side the scope of either narrative.
As an example, in "The Memory of Child
hood," Perec reports how he received a
gratuitous blow to his face which left a scar
on his mouth. This scar, an emblem of the
injustice Perec suffers and his consequent in
ability to speak his childhood memories, in
duces Perec to identify with a portrait of a
condottiere with such a scar. Perec's first
novej tells of one Gaspard Winckler, who
forges this portrait and "W" begins with a
narrator' living on the forged identification
papers of Gaspard Winckler. This narrator-
Gaspard learns of the real Gaspard Winckler
who is deaf and dumb and is lost at sea. The

narrator sails in search of his shipwrecked
Doppelganger.
Further, Perec's grandmother pretended
she was deaf and dumb during the war to
hide her Polish-Jewish accent, and when Perec
was baptized, he was forced to wear a sailor
suit belonging to a Christian boy he never
meets.
The threads of speechlessness, false iden
tities and voyages in pursuit of alter egos
merge in a meta-text of Perec's life and
writings. Neither Perec nor his work is self
sufficient; as a human-text, Perec is blank,
and can only read himself in the act of his
literary self-creation. His writing, then, does
not reflect his past or contain its trace, so
much as the past's "trace is writing" (my
italics).
Perec remarks that one's childhood provides
the coordinates which orient one's entire life.
Like his childhood memories, Perec's early
writings and drawings share "an absence of
landmarks"; they have "no mooring . . . noth
ing to anchor them." Parallel to his shuttling
from one relative to another, from one Cath
olic school to another, Perec's writings drift.
Like Scheherzade, spinning tales continuously
to prolong his life, Perec writes to discern the
coordinates of his childhood so as to recover
his life.
But in the absence of any coordinates, he
is condemned to circle this absence, to live it
and to write it, each as the condition of the
other.
Eventually, Gaspard finds his double and

What is the essence of a child
whose formative years were a
living lie, hiding from Ger
mans under a false identity?

Perec his truth. The search turns up not
persons, but W. the allegorical death camp,
both as answer and in lieu of an answer to
the search.
It is axiomatic among those who write about
the Holocaust that language lacks resources
to convey situations in which humiliation,
torture and murder are übiquitous. There
seems no translation between that world and
ours. As Primo Levi has written, had the
camps lasted longer, an entirely new language
would have evolved, for words had already
begun to assume new valences under the im
pact of camp logic.
For this reason, neither memoir nor parable
suffices to tell the story. Switching back and
forth from memoir to parable. Perec limns
what he cannot say, by manipulating tech
nique as metonym. Oscillating from fact to
fiction implies that both are impotent to
describe or explain Auschwitz. Only in the
interstitial "points of suspension" between
memoir and parable, does the story emerge.
Only in properly contextualized silence will
the camps echo, faintly.
David Grossman's new book "See Under:
Love," about a child of survivors trying to
understand the Holocaust, also employs mul
tiple narrative techniques to make the same
point.
Certain critics believe that the only true
literature of the Holocaust is Kafka or de
Sade. They create hermetic universes in which
nightmare is no aberration but rather the
order of reality Again, when facts thwart com
prehension, the line between fact and fiction
blurs; the death camp as another planet or a
warped space seems almost more credible than
the death camp as a site in Europe 40 years
ago.
Many chroniclers of the Holocaust enlist
the other-planet metaphor (e.g. Bellow in "Mr.
Sammler's Planet" and Rousset in"L'Univers
Concentrationnairre"), but Perec goes further.
Splicing "W" and"The Memory of Child
hood," he fractures each narrative on the other
and regroups the shards into a third, extra
textual story, in whose mist silenced voices
[both those of the dead and that which was
to be Perec's but was lost with the true Gas
pard on W.l inscribe themselves as writing.
This extra-textual, missing story is the story
of the missing. A story told by silenced voices
is an event that does not happen, but the
event is a true one.
