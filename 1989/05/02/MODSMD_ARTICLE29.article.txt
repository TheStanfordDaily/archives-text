### Bernard Shaw: The Search for Love" By Michael Holroyd 
Random House, $24.95
Reviewed by Martin Esslin
This is the first volume of a monu
mental three-volume biography. It is in
itself remarkable for the fact that its
author, Michael Holroyd, has received for
the three books the largest advance ever
paid by a publisher in the history of
publishing — more than 600,000 pound
sterling. The sum is well over a million
dollars at the present exchange rate.
Does the first volume justify that vast
amount?
Well, it certainly is a fascinating story
that Holroyd, already famous as the biog
rapher of such worthies as Lytton Strac
hey (one of the most eccentric members
of the Bloomsbury circle) and Augustus
John (the Falstaffian English painter),
has to tell. And it is the story of a man
much more important than those two.
George Bernard Shaw was more than
just a famous playwright, more than just
a brilliant novelist, music and theater
critic. He was, above all, one of the
creators of our world: as an advocate of
Ibsen and Richard Wagner, as one of the
earliest and most effective feminist
propagandists, as a vegetarian and violent
fighter for animal rights, and, most im
portantly, as one of the founders of the
Fabian society which created the
gradualist approach to social reform with

its emphasis on social services and the
welfare state.
It is not only the British Labour Party
that has inherited this approach. The
entire modern Western world from Fin
land and Sweden to the United States
follows this pattern. However violently
some people in the United States
denounce liberalism, deep down they are
"social democrats" all, talking about
Medicare, daycare, welfare payments,
graduated income taxes, etc. And Shaw
played a decisive part in creating and
spreading that gospel. He shaped all our
lives.
On top of that Shaw was one of the
wittiest and most creative people of his,
and all, time. Born in Dublin in 1856,
he died in England in 1950 at the age
of 94.

Holroyd calls this first volume, which
covers the first 40 years of Shaw's life,
"The Search for Love." And, indeed, Ber
nard Shaw, apart from all his other fas
cinating sides, presents a psychological
puzzle of the first order.
Shaw came from a deeply unhappy
household. His father, an unsuccessful
and rather feeble character, a real loser,
was a pathological drunkard.
Shaw's mother had the deepest con
tempt for her husband. She had high
ambitions to become a singer, and when
she met a charming but obviously amoral
singing teacher, Vandeleur Lee — he was
the model for a famous literary character,
Svengali, in du Maurier's novel "Trilby"
— she fell under his spell. He moved in
with the Shaw's and became a member
of a curious "menage a trois." There were

even doubts whether he might not have
been GBS'a real father. There are a lot
of illegitimate children and foundlings in
Shaw's plays.
This situation could not last, and fi
nally Mrs. Shaw and Lee moved to Lon
don, leaving the father and the son back
in Dublin. Such was the arrangement
until one day when young Shaw, fed up
with his job as an apprentice clerk, fol
lowed his mother to London and left his
drunken father in the lurch.
Shaw was a late developer: For many
years he turned out unsuccessful novels
and tried to keep himself going by writing
for newspapers and magazines, until he
established himself first as a music critic,
and later as a theater critic, playwright
and socialist pamphleteer.
Deep down, Holroyd shows, Shaw was
a diffident person, but for the surface he
created himself anew, as a character he
called "GBS": impertinent, iconoclastic,
full of paradoxical and outrageous state
ments, turning everything into a joke,
flamboyant, aggressive and shouting it
from all the rooftops that he considered
himself a genius.
An unloved child of a drunken father
and mother who cruelly neglected him,
Shaw, Holroyd maintains, created this
fictional personality, the role that he
enacted for the rest of his life, in the
search to be recognized, a search for love.
Shaw was almost 30 before he had his
first experience of physical sex — and
that with an older woman who was a
friend of his mother. Although he was

tremendously attractive to women, he felt
rather repelled by sex and carried on a
number of platonic affairs with some of
the leading actresses of his time: Janet
Achurch, Mrs. Patrick Campbell and El
len Terry. It is significant that with Ellen
Terry he carried on a long correspond
ence, writing her passionate love letters
every day for many years, yet he never
actually met her alone, and only admired
her from afar on the stage.
When Shaw finally married an attrac
tive and very rich lady — at the age of
42 — one of the conditions under which
he entered that bond was: "no physical
lovemaking!" And it appears that the cou
ple kept this condition for many decades
until Mrs. Shaw died.
Holroyd tells this story with consumate
skill, using the veritable mountains of
material that document it — letters,
diaries, the reminiscences of friends and
contemporaries and the vast corpus of
Shaw's writings.
From academic quarters, however, Hol
royd has been bitterly attacked for doing
all this without sufficient documentation.
To these accusations he shrugs: he will
include all the necessary references in
the last volume of the biography.
That may be a valid defence, or it may
not. In any case, this a highly readable
and amusing book, both for Shaw's wit
which is amply quoted here and for the
wonderful image of the English cultural
scene in the last half of the 19th century.
