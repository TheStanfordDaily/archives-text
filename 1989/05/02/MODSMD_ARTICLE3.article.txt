# Staged kidnapping riles police, Lyons
## 
### Tim Marklein Editorial staff 
A staged kidnapping that was
intended as a "theater action"
turned into a scuffle and rescue
attempt Sunday night, bringing
police into the fray and upsetting
University officials.
As part of a quarter-long plan
to raise awareness about U.S.
policy in Central America, mem
bers of Stanford Central America
Action Network acted out a kid
napping of pre-arranged "victims"
in Wilbur, Lagunita and Florence
Moore Halls at dinner time. But
aside from the victims, no one
was let in on the secret.
Unaware students in Wilbur's
Otero House dining hall rushed
to the rescue when group mem
bers — dressed in camouflage,
masked with pantyhose and car
rying sticks — tried to "kidnap"
freshman Kristi Rux. The fake
abduction was intended to repre
sent alleged violations of civil
rights by Central American gov
ernments.
A startled spectator called the
police, warning them of a "kidnap
in progress."
Police Chief Marvin Herrington
and the four officers who went to

the scene were not entertained by
the "theater."
"We are not happy at all about
this," Herrington said yesterday,
adding that organization mem
bers never notified police before
their staged event."The potential
for people to be hurt was really
high," he said.
"No one in the dining hall knew
about it," Herrington added, a sit
uation which led to "some alterca
tion" between the kidnappers and
the rescuers. Though the con
cerned diners did not injure any
group members, Herrington said,
"They just as well could have
picked up a chair and hit them
with it."
Herrington passed the case on
to Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons, who was no less upset
about the incident yesterday. "We
expect to meet with the students
involved .. . and share our deep
concerns," he said.
Group members yesterday de
fended their actions, emphasizing
there were "no blows exchanged
between SCAAN people and house
members," according to member
Sha Xin Wei.
Graduate student Marcia Klotz
explained, "It was meant to be
really clear that it was guerilla
theater. We're sorry if we hurt
anybody or traumatized any
body."
Otero resident assistant Jae
Choi, who dived into the crowd of
confused students to save his res
ident, said a fellow hasher and
other residents "struggled to strip
her away" from the abductors.
"They could have easily gone
through glass," Choi said, adding
that forks and knives were readily
available in the kitchen setting.
Participants were "shocked by
the really strong reaction" of
Otero residents, Sha said. "There
was a great deal of confusion."
Sha said residents of Lagunita
and Flo Mo's Cardenal House did
not react as strongly as those at
Otero, though dorm residents
were "throwing things or yelling

things" during the fake abduc
tion.
Because of the Otero residents'
reaction, group members re
turned later Sunday night and
yesterday to explain their actions.
Choi said the staged kidnapping
"stirred up a lot of emotions" and
many involved students were
"fairly distraught" about the in
cident. "What (dorm residents)
talked about afterward was not
the issue of El Salvador but the
issue of what happened — the
emotions and the other things
(the group) screwed up," he said.
Lyons said, "It's an action that
by its nature imperils a number
of students. . . . While they are in
control of the theater, they are
not in control of the reaction."
Lyons said the University plans
no punishment if the students
take no further action. "It's an
understandable mistake," he said,
adding that "one doesn't always
anticipate other people's reac
tions."
