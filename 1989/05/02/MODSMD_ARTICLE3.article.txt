# Staged kidnapping riles police, Lyons

### Tim Marklein Editorial staff 
A staged kidnapping that was
intended as a "theater action"
turned into a scuffle and rescue
attempt Sunday night, bringing
police into the fray and upsetting
University officials.
As part of a quarter-long plan
to raise awareness about U.S.
policy in Central America, mem
bers of Stanford Central America
Action Network acted out a kid
napping of pre-arranged "victims"
in Wilbur, Lagunita and Florence
Moore Halls at dinner time. But
aside from the victims, no one
was let in on the secret.
Unaware students in Wilbur's
Otero House dining hall rushed
to the rescue when group mem
bers — dressed in camouflage,
masked with pantyhose and car
rying sticks — tried to "kidnap"
freshman Kristi Rux. The fake
abduction was intended to repre
sent alleged violations of civil
rights by Central American gov
ernments.
A startled spectator called the
police, warning them of a "kidnap
in progress."
Police Chief Marvin Herrington
and the four officers who went to

the scene were not entertained by
the "theater."
"We are not happy at all about
this," Herrington said yesterday,
adding that organization mem
bers never notified police before
their staged event."The potential
for people to be hurt was really
high," he said.
"No one in the dining hall knew
about it," Herrington added, a sit
uation which led to "some alterca
tion" between the kidnappers and
the rescuers. Though the con
cerned diners did not injure any
group members, Herrington said,
"They just as well could have
picked up a chair and hit them
with it."
Herrington passed the case on
to Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons, who was no less upset
about the incident yesterday. "We
expect to meet with the students
involved .. . and share our deep
concerns," he said.
Group members yesterday de
fended their actions, emphasizing
there were "no blows exchanged
between SCAAN people and house
members," according to member
Sha Xin Wei.
