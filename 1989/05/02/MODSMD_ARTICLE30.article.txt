## Frankly, Cardinal nine does or dies with Carey 
### Robert Portnoy Senior staff writer 
When Cardinal fans remember
the career of senior second base
man Frank Carey, a host of images
will come to mind.
"I think of his eyeblack and his
patented double to left-center
field. I think of his first-to-third
hustle and nothing getting by on
the right side of the infield," out
fielder Paul Carey (no relation)
said.
"Frank turns the double play
as well as anybody I've played
with, if not better. He makes the
diving play up the middle better
than the majority of [second
basemen] in the country," out
fielder Jack Hollis said.
Maybe the little hop-step Carey
makes when he takes a pitch will
pop into fans' heads. His team
mates love to mimmick that trait
in front of the dugout.
Stanford faithful may remem
ber those agonizing seconds Carey
made them endure before flipping
the ball to first for the putout.
"It scares the hell out of me. He's
the all-cool player and I love it,"
Paul Carey said.
But of all the possible memor
ies, "consistency" will be the
operative word when Carey is the
topic of conversation.
"He's intense and very consis
tent. He's like a bulldog, he gets
down and gets dirty and is not
afraid to," Paul Carey said.
As a shortstop in 1986, Carey
started in 49 of the 55 games in
which he played. Since then, he

has been the Cardinal's everyday
second baseman, missing just five
games and starting all but nine.
His 239 games played rank second
in Stanford history. Unless the
Cardinal makes post season play,
he will finish one behind career
leader Ruben Amaro (1984-87).
As steadily as his name has been
on the lineup card, Carey's bat
ting average has improved in each
of his four years on the Farm. As
a frosh, he hit .240, but raised
his average some 40 points the
second half of the season. During
a 19-game span from April 9 to
May 7, he hit .375 (24-for-64) with
17 RBI.
After hitting .267 in 1987 —
Stanford's first championship
season — Carey threatened the
.300 mark in 1988, finishing at
.295. In the NCAA Northeast Re
gional last year, he hit .474 and
was named the tournament's
most valuable player.
This season has been rough on
the two-time defending national
champions, but — in typical
workman like fashion — Carey
has made himself a bona fide pro
prospect. Batting .315 entering
last weekend, he has been the Car
dinal's leadoff hitter from opening
day. Seventeen doubles this year
have brought his career total to
49, one shy of Mark Davis' record
for a Stanford career. It may be
a cliche, but as Carey goes, so
goes the Cardinal.
"When Frank starts the game
off with a first-pitch single or
double, he's a catalyst for the
whole game," Hollis said.

In a season when scoring has
often tied Stanford in knots,
Carey is the team leader in runs
scored.
And, as always, his defense has
been impeccable. Among in
fielders, he is second only to first
baseman David McCarty in field
ing percentage. His current pace
will better by 10 points his .960
average of a year ago.
Yet, as the only senior starter
on this year's club, Carey feels
there's one area where he could
have had a better '89.
"To be honest, I don't think
I've done a really good job of
[being a leader]. I could've done
more to verbalize things. It's not
my make-up, but I could've tried
to be a little more vocal this year,"
Carey said.
Said Hollis: "Frank's much

more of a leader by example. He's
not the talkative team cheer
leader, though a couple times
when we needed a meeting this
year, he's called one or two, bas
ically to give us a goal for the
week."
For namesake Paul — Stan
ford's top run-producer and
second-leading hitter — Carey
sets a fine example.
"He's my inspiration. He's the
one guy on the team I look to for
leadership. I look up to what he
does and try to emulate him,"
Paul Carey said.
Carey is hoping mtyor league
scouts feel the same way. Magor
League Baseball's June draft is
just around the corner, and Stan
ford's sparkplug will be waiting
for the call.
