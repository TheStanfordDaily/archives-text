# Dunn takes changing status in stride
## 
### Cameron Macky Senior staff writer 
Curtis Dunn may play today in the
men's tennis team's match against No.
15 Pepperdine.
Then again, he may not.
Dunn, one of the Cardinal's three
co-captains and the team's only senior,
has been in and out of the singles lineup
this season. He started the season at
No. 6, and then moved up to fifth when
injuries kept first Jeff Tar an go and then
Martin Blackman on the sidelines.
However, while Dunn was playing at
No. 5, Barry Richards was establishing
himself as a sixth-man power. Since en
tering the lineup, Richards has posted
a 15-1 record, which means that when
Tar ango and Blackman became healthy
again, Dunn found himself in the
stands, watching the action.
Since then, most of Dunn's playing
time has come when one of the starters
has been unable to play. That might
bother a lot of ego-happy tennis players,
especially ones in the final season of
their careers, but not Dunn.
"I'm not a great tennis player who's
going to do well individually," Dunn
says."I don't have a lot of individual
goals to look forward to anyway.
"I want the team to do well, and if
I'm not playing well, someone else can
do the job just as easily," he continues.
"Barry was doing great, so I have no
problem with that."

is nothing new for
Dunn.

task? "Not at all," Dunn says. "Espe
cially when we're winning, beating
UCLA and USC... .Of course I want
to play, but I think it's gone pretty well."
The now-you-see-him-now-you-don't
routine is nothing new for Dunn. He
also spent most the 1988 campaign ro
tating with Richards, Glenn Solomon,
and a cast of thousands at the No. 6
spot.
Worrying about how you're playing
— and knowing that someone is ready
to take your place if you don't do well
— probably isn't the most healthy psy
chological situation for most players.
Two-seasons of teetering on the brink
between starting and watching would
probably wreak havoc upon most
players' minds, but Dunn has taken it
all in stride.
"I don't think it's affected me that
much," Dunn says."I never really
thought about it when I played."
Of course, Dunn has been doing more
than just watching for the past month.
At the Pacific 10 Conference Champi
onships in Ojai last weekend, Dunn won
four matches in the open division (only

five players from each school were en
tered in the Pac-10 draw) before falling
in the semifinals.
"That's as much as he's played in a
long time," Stanford Asst. Coach John
Whitlinger said. "It's great for us that
Curtis was able to go down there and
play well. We're going to need him to
do well because we have a few guys
hurting."
If those "few guys hurting" don't get
better soon, Dunn will be back on the
courts for the Cardinal. Odds are he
will play today against Pepperdine, and
he may see action again Saturday
against California. If not, though, he'll
be in the stands, supporting his team
mates.
