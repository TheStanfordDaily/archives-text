# Sailors catch a current to nationals

### Hugh R. Bethell Staff writer 
Though the Stanford women's
sailing team couldn't quite catch
the defending champions from
UC-Irvine this weekend, a close
second at the Pacific Coast Cham
pionships did earn the squad a
berth at this year's nationals, to
be held in Chicago at the end of
May.
Seven schools competed in Red
wood City on Saturday and Sun
day for the right to represent the
district at the national champion
ship. For all of them, shifting
breezes made consistent finishes
difficult to attain.
From the start of the regatta,

Irvine did the best job of staying
at the front of the fleet. By the
end of the first day's racing, Irvine
had built up a substantial lead,
while Stanford was in a tight race
for second with UC-Santa Bar
bara.
On Sunday, stronger breezes
brought a change in Stanford's
fortune. Junior Kim Grose and
senior Amy Baltzer seized the day
with two firsts and two seconds,
to lead the charge toward Irvine.
While Santa Barbara fell off the
pace, Stanford closed the gap be
tween first and second with each
race.
Time ran out, though, before
the Cardinal squad could catch
up to the leaders. When the racing
ended, Stanford was just behind

Irvine but well ahead of California
in third, Santa Barbara in fourth,
Orange Coast in fifth, Sonoma
State in sixth, and UC-San Diego
in seventh.
In the divisional results,
rankings were similar. Irvine cap
tured both A- and B-Division,
while Grose and Baltzer and took
second in the A fleet and senior
Buffy Wendt and freshman Chris
Li finished third in B.
This coming weekend, the coed
dinghy squad and the team-racing
team will head to their own
Pacific Coast Championships, to
be held in Los Angeles. If all goes
well, Stanford will be sending even
more sailors to Chicago at quar
ter's end.
