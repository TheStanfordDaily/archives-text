# Swimming recruits possibly best ever

### Chris Crader Senior staff writer 
In football they say, "You can't
coach speed."
In basketball it's, "You can't
coach height."
In boxing it's, "You can't teach
heart."
Basically, all those cliches mean
is that it is impossible for a coach
to do what natural talent does.
Realizing that, Stanford women's
swimming Coach Richard Quick,
this year's NCAA Coach of the
Year, is now shooting for recruiter
of the year as well.
And for those who hope to
dethrone the Cardinal when Stan

Alphabetically, the recruits who
have already signed are:
• Lori Heisick — Heisick, a
breaststroker from Edina, Minn.,
is the national high school record
holder in the 100-yard breast

100-meter breaststroke champion
at the 1987 Pan-American Games.
• Janel Jorgenson — The Rich

Olympian who has signed with
Stanford so far. She took second

Seoul. Although she did not place

in that event, she swam well
enough to earn the right to swim
the butterfly leg on the silver
medal-winning 400-meter medley
relay team.
• Ann Mahoney — Mahoney,
from Wichita, Kan., is the defend
ing national champion in the 100
backstroke, a title she won at the
U.S. Short Course Nationals in
Chapel Hill, N.C. in March. Ma
honey was the national champ in
both the 100 and 200 backstrokes
in 1987 and finished third in the
100-meter backstroke at the
Olympic Trials, like Heisick just
missing a spot on the squad.
Additionally, triple gold med

styler from Placentia, Calif., is ex
