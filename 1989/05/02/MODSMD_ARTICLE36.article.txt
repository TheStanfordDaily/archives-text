# Applause for 'other' spring sports
## 
### 
Even with its modest two
game winning streak,
Stanford baseball has
yielded the spring sports spot
light to tennis and men's vol
leyball.
Not golf. But more about that
later.
Baseball has for now relin
quished center stage despite the
amazing (or even redundant)
fact that the Cardinal batsmen
still have a shot at an NCAA
Regional berth. We've all been
hearing that Stanford's chances
are slim since the first week of
the season it seems; the thing
is, those chances just won't go
away.
Though its record is only 10-
17 in Pacific 10 Conference
Southern Division play, the Car
dinal is tied for fourth with
UCLA going into a final series
with last-place California this
weekend. The following week
end, UCLA plays USC and Ar
izona plays Arizona State.
Stanford could finish fourth
or even in a three-way tie for
third. The standings: 1) Arizona
20-7 (37-14), 2) Arizona St. 19-8
(40-14), 3) USC 13-14 (37-22),
4t) Stanford 10-17 (23-27), 4t)
UCLA 10-17 (22-26), 6) Cal 9-18
(34-22).
Last year, the top-four Six-
Pac teams went to the NCAAs,
and even though the conference
is apparently having a down year
in 1989, the selection committee
might find it hard to turn down
a strong-finishing, two-time

defending champion Cardinal
squad.
But let's face it, the teams to
watch this spring have been the
ones that play with the nets.
Not golf.
There's not much you can say
about the women's tennis team.
When they aren't playing inter
squad matches to determine the
nation's top players, the Cardi
nal netters are stomping oppo
nents on their way to an un
precedented fourth-straight
NCAA title.
Meanwhile, you can't say
enough about the men's volley
ball team. The spikers could
have griped ad infinitum about
being forced to play two difficult
playoff matches because they
won only five out of eight games
against UCLA instead of six
(which would have meant a
season sweep of the Bruins).
Instead, the Cardinal forgot
about the misbegotten coin toss
and simply earned its Final Four
spot by winning those two
matches.

As Pauley Pavilion opens its
doors for the NCAA Champion
ship this weekend, let's hope the
men's volleyballers aren't
bridesmaids, as has been the
tragic fate of their female coun
terparts.
If the Cardinal can end
UCLA's stranglehold on the na
tional title, this weekend will
legitimately be one of the
greatest in Stanford sports his
tory.
Men's tennis is an enigma. In
1987, the team struggled and
failed to make the NCAA tour
nament for the first time, it
seemed, since wooden rackets
were phased out. In 1988, the
team lost only one match en
route to a surprisingly easy
NCAA title.
This year's team has shown
flashes of both the '87 and '88
squads. Consistency is not ex
actly this squad's middle name.
But the excitement generated by
standing-room only wins over
USC and No. 1 UCLA has
guaranteed that when it plays
for the NCAA title in Athens,
Ga. later this month, the Stan
ford men's tennis team will be
one to watch.
Not golf, which is the subject
of today's column.
I realize I haven't been merely
beating around the bush; 1 ha
ven't come anywhere near it.
Both the men's and women's
golf teams are perennially in the
kind of battles for NCAA
