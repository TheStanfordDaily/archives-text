# Codes of conduct differ at universities nationwide
## 
### Dan Mendelsohn Staff writer 
Recently proposed changes in Stan
ford's 83-year-old Fundamental Stand
ard have generated debate on the role
of the University in enforcing moral
codes of conduct and its power to limit
a student's constitutional rights.
A Daily survey of the moral and ac
ademic codes at seven universities
nationwide reveals varying degrees of
rules and enforcement of these regula
tions.
While some schools like the University
of Virginia, Harvard and Brown have
disciplinary systems that utilize a broad
code of conduct much like Stanford's,
other universities such as UCLA, Yale,
UC-Berkeley and Duke set out specific
guidelines for student conduct.
University of Virginia students are
governed by a strong Honor System and
the Twelve Standards of Student Con
duct which enumerate specific offenses
and their punishments.
According to UVA student Adam Ar
thur, chair of the First Year Judiciary
Committee, "the Honor System covers
lying, cheating and stealing, and the
Twelve Standards cover everything
else." The punishment for Honor Sys
tem violations is dismissal.
Standard 10 of the Twelve Standards
is something of a general, cover-all rule,
calling for punishment of "any violation

of federal, state or local law," Arthur
said.
There has been talk at UVA of adding
another standard dealing specifically
with racism, based on an incident earlier
this year involving a misunderstanding
over a flier advertising a fraternity
party, he said.
However, Arthur said such a standard
would involve "a lot of gray area. We
can't really define racism as 'conduct'
— it's more an attitude."
Students at Harvard are governed by
a version of Stanford's Fundamental
Standard, which is put forth in Har
vard's 1988-89 Handbook for Students
titled "Life in the Harvard Community,"
according to Ellen Towne, assistant
dean of students.
Under General Regulations for Stu
dents, the section warns that "failure
to behave with the maturity and re
sponsibility expected of Harvard and
RadclifTe students will be dealt with as
the faculty and administrative board
shall determine," she said.
Additionally, the section states that
"students are expected to be familiar
with those parts of the academic rules
and Life in the Harvard Community as
apply to them. ... Violation will lead
to disciplinary action."
At Brown, in addition to an Academic
Honor Code, students are governed by
the Tenets of Community Behavior, a
group of standards that proscribe stu

dent conduct on and off campus.
Other schools lack broad standards
on moral and academic behavior and
their students are governed solely by
specific regulations.
A representative of UCLA said there
was "nothing like [the Fundamental
Standard] here — just specific rules,"
and added that offensive posters were
protected by the First Amendment in
public places, but not in residence halls.
Karen Miracle, assistant dean of Ac
ademic Life at Yale, said that there is
"not an honor code here. Regulations
are very specifically delineated."
At UC-Berkeley, there is no Honor
Code and no broad statement like the
Fundamental Standard. According to
Alan Rolling, assistant dean of Student
Life, the Student Judicial System
enumerates all rules and definitions,
both academic and general.
There are no anti-racism or anti
sexism rules at UC-Berkeley, but there
are general rules about racial and sexual
harassment, he said. "You can't make
an absolute rule, even with reference to
the word 'nigger,"' Kolling said.
Students at Duke enter into the Duke
Student Honor Commitment, which in
cludes the statement, "My devotion to
integrity establishes that I will not cheat
in academic work, and that I will adhere
to the established and required commu
nity code of conduct."
