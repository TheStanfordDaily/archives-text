# University to build backup infectious waste incinerator

"We've really got something at Stanford to be
proud of," says Ted Malloy, operations manager for
the Environmental Safety Facility, as he overlooked
the infectious waste incinerator at the facility.
When the incinerator was first built, University
officials faced a torrent of bad press and community
protest about its many design flaws. However, now
that the smoke has cleared, Health and Safety of
ficials are claiming that the incinerator is one of
the world's finest.
Malloy says people from all over the world have
come to visit the facility to get a look at the Stanford
model and possibly copy the design. For example,
a Japanese businessman told The Daily that after
touring incinerators from around the world, Stan
ford's incinerator design was the best he had seen.
One would hardly expect such rave reviews after
such a controversial start, but Health and Safety
officials say that except for a few minor problems,
the incinerator is in perfect condition.
However, officials point out that the smokestack
of the incinerator is rapidly decaying after only two
years of use and needs to be replaced.
They also note that smoke from the stack blows
back into the building, called re-entrainment, causing
potential health hazards to Health and Safety offi
cials, who make sure nobody else on campus is
exposed to health problems.
Two years ago, the smoke re-entrainment was not
the only problem with the Environmental Safety

machinery" that is the University's waste incinerator.
