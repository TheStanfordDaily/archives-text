# Wisconsin's debate mirrors Stanford's
## 
### Sharon Gwyn 
While Stanford wrestles with a new
interpretation of its conduct code, the
University of Wisconsin is revising its
non-discrimination code to include ac
tion against verbal assaults on race, cul
ture and sexual orientation.
Because Wisconsin is a public institu
tion, any changes to its policy must be
approved by the state legislature as well
as the university.
Proposed revisions for System Rule
17, the non-discrimination rule of the
university conduct code, is a direct re
action to racial incidents at some fra
ternities within the University of
Wisconsin system, especially at UW-
Madison.
In the spring of 1987, the Phi Gamma
Delta Fraternity gave a "Fiji party,"
which had pictures depicting stereo
typical natives. Also, last fall, national
attention focused on the university when
the Zeta Beta Tau Fraternity held a
mock slavery auction at a party.
Last spring, the UW-Madison educa
tional committee passed System Rule 17
as an emergency code, to take effect
immediately.
However, The Board of Regents, the

governing body for the Wisconsin sys
tem, overturned this change. The board
voted 8-7 to reject this emergency im
plementation, arguing that the proposed
code conflicted with the Constitution's
First Amendment.
Now the proposed changes must un
dergo a legislative state hearing, which
will last for several months, before com
ing back to the university system to be
reconsidered.
According to Stephen White, the
campus editor of UW-Madison's Badger
Herald, the revised System Rule 17 has
been "overwhelmingly supported by
most groups on campus, except some
members of the American Civil Liberties
Union and some political science profes
sors."
The changes to the rule, if passed,
would have two effects.
First, the university could immedi
ately suspend or expel students who
make demeaning ethnic remarks, such
as jokes or slurs, directed at another
person, White said.
And second, the university could take
action against students who make re
marks or act in such a way that makes
the university seem hostile toward a cer
tain racial group, according to White.
