Two years after the startup of a controversial
incinerator on campus. University officials are
thinking of building another incinerator to dispose
of the ever-growing amount of infectious waste gen
erated by the Medical School.
The second incinerator, priced at $2 million to
build, would act as a backup in case the primary
incinerator is down for maintenance. Currently, if
the existing incinerator fails, infectious waste must
be shipped off campus at a high cost to the Uni
versity.
Housed side by side at the University's Environ
mental Safety Facility, the incinerators would never
operate simultaneously, according to Ted Malloy,
operations manager of the facility.
"The reason for two units is the same as carrying
a spare tire in your automobile," Malloy said.
Plans for the incinerator are pending an evalua
tion of its cost-effectiveness, according to Malloy,
who will conduct the study with members of the
Office of Facilities Project Management.
Shipping infectious waste off campus when the
incinerator shuts down costs the University about
$250,000 annually. Health and Safety officials said
they hope that the new incinerator might be able
to pay for itself in a number of years.
"We're also evaluating the benefits of limiting
the University's liability," Malloy
said. Shipping infectious waste
has been a touchy subject in many
communities because of the po
tential for spills.
"From a purely human level, I
think it's stupid [to ship waste
off-campus]," said Alain Decleve,
an official with the University's
Office of Health and Safety.
If the incinerator is built, the
University will have to write an
environmental impact report on
the facility and hold a public
hearing before the project begins.
"The major concern is that
chemicals and radiological waste
are being dumped into the infec
tious waste," said John Joynt,
president of the Barron Park As
sociation, a homeowner's group.
Chemical and radiological waste

are more difficult to incinerate,
and present an increased risk of
hazardous emissions.
According to Health and Safety
officials, the incinerator has the
capability of burning chemical and
radiological waste.
However, Health and Safety of
ficials said they do not intend to
burn chemical and radiological
wastes. The community opposi
tion to a plan of this kind would
require the University to undergo
extensive and costly permit pro
cedures, according to Malloy.
With growing infectious waste
disposed and skyrocketing costs
for shipping the waste off campus,
a second incinerator has become
an attractive alternative for the
University. In recent years, costs
for shipping infectious waste has
increased seven-fold, Malloy said.
Furthermore, medical waste
has increased from 1.2 million
pounds last year to about 1.7 mil
lion pounds.
