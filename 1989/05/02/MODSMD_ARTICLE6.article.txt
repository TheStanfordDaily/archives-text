For the second year in a row,
Stanford leads the nation's
schools in fund raising, according
to an annual report released by
the Council for Financial Aid in
Education.
Stanford raised $181.9 million
in the fiscal year 1987-88, com

gifts from alumni and parents
each year.
The Centennial Celebration in
1991 should help Stanford raise

intensity of the fund raising and
the size of the staff for the Cen

"Stanford has had three major
'campaigns' and each one has
lifted Stanford to a new plateau,"
said Fulton. "I think we will come
out raising more money in this
campaign than we would if we
didn't have one."
