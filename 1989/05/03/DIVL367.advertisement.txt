#5-Home Cooking to Go
In-store delis and take-out sections are fairly common in supermarkets these
days. You can find a roasted chicken, roast beef sandwich, and macaroni salad
just about anywhere.
What you won't find anywhere else but Whole Foods Market, however, is our
innovative, mouth-watering array of gourmet prepared foods, deli sandwiches,
and freshly made salads for lunch or dinner take out.
At Whole Foods Market, we prepare specialty items from our own recipes
every day. We offer entrees like game hens Morocco, five cheese lasagne,
sesame pork ribs, pesto stuffed chicken, and herb crust salmon and shrimp
with snow peas. Our salads include southwestern black bean, tortellini with
sun dried tomatoes, Thai black rice, and Hunan chicken, just to name a few.
We like to think of it as "home cooking to go," because it's the kind of food
you'd be proud to prepare and serve for a special meal at home.
