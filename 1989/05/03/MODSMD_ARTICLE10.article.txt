# Memories, lessons:
## A
						day to mourn the Holocaust 
### Clarisse Perrette 
"Never again." Those two
words, inscribed on a Holocaust
memorial stone in Warsaw,
Poland, were the heart of a
speech given by prominent the
ologian Robert MacAfee Brown
in a Stanford memorial service
last night.
The service commemorated
the Holocaust remembrance day
known to Jews as "Yom Ha-
Shoah," which comes every year
on the 27th day of Nisan, a
Hebrew month. The Hillel
sponsored service, witnessed by
about 40 people, included

mourning candles, mourning
prayers read by students and
two featured speakers: Brown
and Rabbi Sheldon Lewis.
Brown, a retired Stanford
professor of religious studies
who most recently taught at the
Berkeley Graduate Theological
Union, used this occasion to ex
plain correct and incorrect
analogies to the Holocaust.
Brown, who was a member of
the national Holocaust Mem
orial Council, argued that only
a nuclear war can be compared
to the Holocaust.
Defining a Holocaust as the
"consumption by fire of all that

is," Brown spoke disparagingly
of any "trivializing" compari
sons between the Holocaust and
abortions or epidemics in which
fire was not the agent of de
struction.
"Remembrance is first of all
to honor the dead, but it is also
to protect the living," Brown
said.
Lewis strongly encouraged
Jews to celebrate their religious
tradition with no less joy or fer
vor than before the Holocaust,
pointing to "positive motiva
tion" as the best way of "grow
ing beyond our memories."
