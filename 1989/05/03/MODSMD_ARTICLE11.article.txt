## Chinese protests continue Student leaders demand recognition for new union 
### 
BEIJING (AP) â€” Student
leaders in Beijing yesterday gave
the government 24 hours to rec
ognize their new student union
or they would take to the streets
again. In Shanghai, thousands
demonstrated for democracy and
freedom.
The developments added new
tension to a situation the govern
ment has been trying to calm by
holding talks with officially sanc
tioned student unions.
Last week's activism crested
with a march of 150,000 students
and their supporters in China's
capital.
The official student unions took
no part in the marches, the big
gest in communist China's his
tory, and student activists say the
talks won't satisfy their yearnings
for a freer and more open China.
The protest in Shanghai,
China's most important trading

and industrial city, began in the
early afternoon when about 6,000
students, carrying banners read
ing "give us democracy and free
dom," blocked traffic in front of
city government offices.
Student leaders presented peti
tions demanding political reform
and the Xinhua News Agency said
the protest ended about 10 p.m.
An American teacher said a
class boycott, which started in
Beijing and spread earlier this
week to Tianjin, has moved to
Shanghai. About half of the stu
dents at Fudan University, the
city's leading school, are striking,
said Jason Hurtado, of Portland,
Ore.
He quoted student activists at
Fudan as saying that student
leaders from Beijing helped or
ganize the strike and the march.
Student leaders have also been

sent to Beijing for more coordina
tion, he said. Earlier, students
from Tianjin came to Beijing for
guidance with their movement.
In Beijing, 65 student leaders
from 33 universities bicycled more
than 7 miles to deliver an ul
timatum to the National People's
Congress, China's legislature; the
State Council, its cabinet; and the
Central Committee of the ruling
Communist Party.
In a handwritten letter, the stu
dents demanded the government
recognize and hold talks with the
United Association of Beijing Uni
versities, an independent associa
tion set up during their 2-week
old campaign for democratic
reform. They want a free press,
freedom of assembly and publica
tion and an end to official corrup
tion.
If they are turned down, they
said, they will march tomorrow.
