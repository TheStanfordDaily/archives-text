BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) â€” A U.S. proposal for
resolving the internal NATO dispute over short
range nuclear missiles does not address West Ger
man demands for East-West negotiations on the
weapons, an alliance official said yesterday.
In Rome, Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Ger
many said he was open to "reasonable compromise,"
but wants talks to begin soon. The United States
and Britain have rejected such negotiations.
In Paris, Foreign Ministers Roland Dumas of
France and Hans-Dietrich Genscher of West Ger
many told reporters it is essential that a common
position emerge from the NATO summit at the end
of this month.
Most of the short-range Lance missiles are in

West Germany, and a battle fought with such weap
ons would take place on its territory.
The NATO official said the American plan sug
gests the 16-member North Atlantic Treaty Organ
ization announce unilateral reductions in its short
range nuclear arsenal and challenge the Soviet-led
Warsaw Pact to meet those levels.
In London, A British Defense Ministry policy
paper said the Soviets have modernized or replaced
95 percent of their short-range nuclear missile sys
tems in Eastern Europe in the past five years.
A separate "fact sheet" said the Soviet Union
"has been aggressively pursuing" modernization of
its short-range forces and now has a 16-1 advantage
over NATO west of the Ural Mountains.
