Congress moves to kill FSX deal
WASHINGTON (AP) â€” Campaigns opened in
the House and Senate yesterday to force President
Bush to scrap plans for the co-production of a
new jet fighter with Japan.
Opponents of the co-production agreement de
nounced it as "a giveaway" which will "shut
down American industries" by handing the
Japanese vital U.S. technology.
But key congressional leaders said the votes
may not be available to override Bush's expected
veto of any congressional resolution disapproving
the deal for production of the FSX fighter, an
advanced version of the F-16.
Bush administration sources said the White
House is "reasonably convinced" that it has suf
ficient support in Congress to prevent passage of

the disapproval resolutions in the first place.
If the motions do get through, "we know we
have enough votes to get a veto override," said
one official who commented on condition he not
be identified by name.
Atlantis countdown underway
CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) - An ab
breviated countdown began yesterday for launch
ing Atluntis on a once-delayed planetary mission,
and the astronaut who will command the flight
said, "This time we're going to see if we can get
it right."
Astronaut David Walker and his four crew
mates flew here yesterday afternoon from their
training base in Houston, where they went after
their flight was scrubbed Friday just 31 seconds
before the planned liftoff.
