# Arafat calls PLO charter 'void'
## PLO chief rejects document advocating destruction of Israel 
### 
PARIS (AP) — Yasser Arafat
said yesterday the PLO charter,
which calls for the destruction of
Israel, is outdated and he favors
a Middle East peace settlement
based on the existence of both
Israel and a Palestinian state.
The PLO chairman was asked
about the charter provision dur
ing a television interview on the
first day of an official visit to
France, and he replied:
"I was elected on a political pro
pram which is founded on the
basis of two states," Israel and
Palestine. "As for the charter,
there is an expression in French,
it is 'caduc.'" Caduc means out
dated, or void.
Initial reaction from Israel and
from a major U.S. Jewish organ
ization was that Arafat's state
ment was angled at public rela
tions and changed nothing.
President Francois Mitterrand
Look the occasion of a 90-minute
meeting with Arafat at the begin
ning of his two-day visit to express

concern that the charter still con
tains a provision for Israel's
destruction.
Pierre Mauroy, leader of the
governing Socialist Party, met
with Arafet later and said he too
brought up the charter.
He said the PLO chief re
sponded: "This text has existed
for many years and is now out
dated. The leadership of the PLO
was elected with a program that
includes recognition of Israel and
the abandonment of terrorism."
Israel frequently cites the
charter provision as reason it will
not deal with the Palestine Lib
eration Organization, which it
considers a terrorist organization.
Last December, the PLO chief
publicly renounced terrorism and
recognized Israel's right to exist.
Arafat, smiling and in uniform,
arrived in Paris yesterday to an
official greeting just below that
for a chief of state: red carpets at
the airport but no Palestinian
flags; high-level talks but no

greeting on the tarmac by the
head or government or state.
France's Jewish community
largely disapproved of the visit.
In the Jewish-dominated Paris
garment district, shopkeepers and
manufacturers set off their bur
glar alarms simultaneously for
five minutes to show displeasure.
Israeli activists protested out
side the French consulate in
Jerusalem and the embassy in Tel
Aviv.
Hubert Vedrine, spokesman for
Mitterrand, read a statement im
plying the president urged Arafat
to drop the charter article about,
the destruction of Israel.
"During the meeting, Francois*
Mitterrand noted that the con
tinuation in force of the charter
of the PLO, adopted in 1964, was
contrary to important points of
the political program adopted by
the Palestine National Council in
Algiers on Nov. 15, 1988, and he
believed things should be made
clear," the statement said.
