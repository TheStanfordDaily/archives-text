### 
Constitutional
Amendment
B'NO □ YES

THE REVISED ASSU con
stitutional amendment
gives both students and the
ASSU Senate a fair say in deter
mining general fee increases and
decreases, and offers hope for stu
dent groups currently starved for
funds.
But students still cannot accept
this amendment.
An "enactment clause" tacked
on to the amendment grants the
senate a one-shot imposition of
taxation without representation
— the very evil which had to be
ironed out of the original propos
al.
The enactment clause gives the
senate the capacity to "on a one
time basis, modify the base
amount of general fees after the
general election in which the
amendment is passed."
Despite the fact that students

voted only two weeks ago not to
increase the general fee, the sen
ate will have the unchecked
power to raise general fees by up
to 20 percent for next year.
If this enactment clause
weren't part of the amendment
package, the revised amendment
would deserve full student sup
port.
The first draft of the amend
ment did not provide for a fair
system of checks and balances
and gave the senate too much
power.
In effect, the senate would have
held the power to raise the fee
by 20 percent regardless of stu
dent opinion.
The revised version of the
amendment rights this wrong.
Under the new amendment, the
senate has the power to change
general fees by 20 percent instead
of 30 percent. More importantly,
students are guaranteed the right
to oppose a change by the same
amount.
It's a shame that the enactment
clause prevents students from
supporting an otherwise solid
amendment.

Council of Presidents
B* Slate of the Times

With specific, viable ideas and
the energy to mobilize students,
The Slate of The Times is a clear
choice for next year's Council of

Presidents. Sophomores Aimee
Allison and Chin-Chin Chen and
juniors David Brown and Ingrid
Nava have repeatedly demonstra
ted a commitment to working for
progressive change within the
Stanford community and the
University itself.

Axe Committee
NEUTRAL

After losing its initial fee request,
the Axe Committee has trimmed
down its budget to allow for Big

Game activities only. Although
The Daily supports the Axe Com
mittee's goals, the ASSU Senate
should not allow any organization
a second chance for a fee assess
ment once it has lost in the gen
eral election.
