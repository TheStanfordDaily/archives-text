ASSU Senate lacked consistency in runoff decision

THE ASSU SENATE is playing
games with the elections again.
At the April 27 senate meeting I
raised the issue of the invalidation of
the Student Conduct Legislative Coun
cil election and the issue of whether
the undergraduate senate election
should be invalidated.
In the SCLC election, one of the
candidates, Canetta Ivy, withdrew
before the election and yet her name
was not removed from the ballot as
the ASSU Bylaws specify. Rather than
just disqualify the votes cast for that
person and use one of the alternates,
the Elections Committee decided to
rerun the election.
It has been argued that the votes
cast for Ivy could have greatly influ
enced the results of the election if they
were cast for legitimate candidates.
She received over 1,500 votes, more

than any other candidate received.
However, it is important to add that if
the current results had been validated
the People's Platform candidate would
not be one of the three people elected
to the SCLC.
In the senate election, one of the
candidates, Brian Clark, withdrew
before the election and was not
removed from the ballot. He received
250 votes. While this is far less than
the number of votes cast for the win
ning candidates, it is still significant.
Only five votes separated the last
voting member from the first non
voting member (10th and 11th place)
and only five votes separated the last
non-voting member from the first
non-senator (20th and 21st place).
Surely 250 votes could have made a
significant change. It is worth noting
that under the current results, seven of

the 10 voting senators are from the
People's Platform.
If the senate were to act consistently
they should have voted to either
validate both of these races or in
validate both of them. However, the
senate voted not to rerun the under
graduate senate election, and no
senator raised the issue of overturning
the Elections Committee's decision to
rerun the SCLC election.
However, the people (specifically,
those tied to the People's Platform)
who are running the elections and
deciding on their validity have a vested
interest in the outcome. People's Plat
form senators currently make up a
majority of voting members on the
senate and the current Council of
Presidents is also backed by the
People's Platform.
Membership in the ASSU is manda-

Tory for all students, but 1 feel no
responsibility to financially support or
be a member of an organization in
which I have no voice or power. If the
University obligates us to be members
of the ASSU and to pay a partially
non-refundable fee then it also has an
obligation to see that all students are
treated fairly within the ASSU.
Furthermore, if the ASSU is to
claim in its endeavors to be representa
tive of all its members then it had
better be so. If not, then students
should be allowed to "secede" from the
ASSU altogether. Short of that, please
vote in the upcoming election. Make
your voice heard! Do not allow the
senate and Elections Committee to play
games with the elections.
