# Student speaker proposal requires more time, study
## 
### 
It takes a good deal to offend me
these nice spring days, but the May 1
editorial on my response to the pro
posal for a student Commencement
speaker — cleverly titled "Spoilsport"
— managed to do it.
In the first place, the editorial fails
the elemental tests of civility; not only
is it singularly nasty in tone, but The
Daily failed to make any inquiry into
the background of the decision, or even
to get hold of the text of my reply to
those who developed the proposal.
Had The Daily done so it would
know that I expressed positive interest
in the idea, committed us to study it
next year (not, as the editorial sugges

ted, through some complex array of
committees), and carefully explained
the reasons we could not proceed with
it this year.
In the second place, the timetable
offered in the editorial suffers from
exactly the objections I tried to explain
in the article earlier this week. It gives
a role only to the seniors and their
class officers, ignoring the fact that
more graduate than undergraduate
degrees will be given at Commence
ment.
It presents no scope whatever for
considering what qualifications, aca
demic or other, the selectee should
possess. And it presumes that the last
minute product of this hastily con
trived process will be able, amidst
finals and farewells, to write in two
weeks a talk that 4,000 graduates and
30,000 of their admirers will find
thoughtful and/or inspiring.
Fortunately, the students who wrote
the proposal did a much better job,

and the Commencement Committee
will have something to work with in
the fall. As to this year, I only hope
that the graduates will understand and
sympathize with my position that this
is an idea whose time has not quite
come, and that they will not accept
The Daily's clumsy misrepresentation.
