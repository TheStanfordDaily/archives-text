# Sluggish fund raising could cause delays
## Science quad may wait four years

Sluggish fund raising may delay the
completion of Stanford's Near West
Campus — a 43-acre science mega
complex — by up to four years.
Phase one of the two-phase project
now under construction was projected
to end by 1994 at a total cost of more
than $350 million. However, donations
have taken longer to come in than ex
pected and the science quad might not
finish on time, according to University
officials responsible for the project.
Requiring $250 million for phase one,
the project's funds are coming from
three sources: designated funds from

the University Board of Trustees ($2O
million), long-term loans ($5O million)
and fund raising from the Office of
Development's Centennial Campaign
($lBO million).
With about half of the Campaign pe
riod left, the Office of Development has
raised $72.8 million for the science com
plex — 40 percent of the $180 million
goal.
However, University officials are op
timistic that fund raising will pick up
and that the complex will finish on or
near schedule.
"Rather than calling it a shortfall,
which implies failure, it is better to say
we are just a little slow. We are still
very much committed to the idea of

raising $180 million, and I think we'll
be successful," said Richard Bennett,
associate director of the Centennial
Campaign.
Asst. Provost for Facilities John
Hughes said a four-year delay is a "pes
simistic" assessment. If the Centennial
Campaign does not raise enough money
for the campus' completion, fund raising
for the campus will continue beyond
the 1991 Campaign deadline, Hughes
said.
The University has not laid out ex
tensive plans for phase two of the proj
ect, and they will not work on the second
part until the Campaign ends.
