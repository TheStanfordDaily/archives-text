# Sluggish fund raising could cause delays
## Science quad may wait four years 
### Sophia Shing Staff writer 
Sluggish fund raising may delay the
completion of Stanford's Near West
Campus — a 43-acre science mega
complex — by up to four years.
Phase one of the two-phase project
now under construction was projected
to end by 1994 at a total cost of more
than $350 million. However, donations
have taken longer to come in than ex
pected and the science quad might not
finish on time, according to University
officials responsible for the project.
Requiring $250 million for phase one,
the project's funds are coming from
three sources: designated funds from

the University Board of Trustees ($2O
million), long-term loans ($5O million)
and fund raising from the Office of
Development's Centennial Campaign
($lBO million).
With about half of the Campaign pe
riod left, the Office of Development has
raised $72.8 million for the science com
plex — 40 percent of the $180 million
goal.
However, University officials are op
timistic that fund raising will pick up
and that the complex will finish on or
near schedule.
"Rather than calling it a shortfall,
which implies failure, it is better to say
we are just a little slow. We are still
very much committed to the idea of

raising $180 million, and I think we'll
be successful," said Richard Bennett,
associate director of the Centennial
Campaign.
Asst. Provost for Facilities John
Hughes said a four-year delay is a "pes
simistic" assessment. If the Centennial
Campaign does not raise enough money
for the campus' completion, fund raising
for the campus will continue beyond
the 1991 Campaign deadline, Hughes
said.
The University has not laid out ex
tensive plans for phase two of the proj
ect, and they will not work on the second
part until the Campaign ends.
Noting that the Near West proj
ect is the largest undertaking of
this type attempted by a univer
sity, Bennett said the project is
"not going to achieve success with
gifts of just a hundred or a
thousand dollars."
"We need gifts of millions of
dollars and the pool of prospects
for gifts of that size is much
smaller," Bennett explained.
A hefty $50-million donation
for the science quad already ar
rived in 1986 from William
Hewlett, co-founder of Hewlett-
Packard Co.. Last month, Digital
Equipment Corp. donated $8 mil
lion.
Phase one of the project in
cludes the contruction of seven to

eight mtyor new buildings and the
renovation of four to five old
buildings. Many of the science
buildings standing today were
constructed as temporary facili
ties in the late 19405.
At that time, the construction
of science buildings was federally
funded. However, since about 15
years ago, the government stopped
funding science buildings, so it
became much more difficult to
construct new buildings, accord
ing to Bennett.
"Forty years is definitely the
end of the lifetime for temporary
facilities. We need to replace the
old one-story buildings with
modern facilities to accommodate
our current research needs," Vice
Provost for Research Robert Byer
said.
"The new buildings will provide
the stability which is necessary

in advanced experiments such as
those that are extremely sensitive
to vibrations," Byer said. More
over, the buildings will be able to
handle more toxic materials than
before.
"If you are in research, you
know that if you don't have the
right kind of facilities, you cannot
do the kind of research you want
to do," Byer said.
Hughes emphasized the need
for new buildings. "We are dealing
with a set of obsolete buildings
that are badly cramped from past
academic growth. The needs are
quite pressing."
Describing the Near West
campus as a crossroads for a wider
campus community, Byer said the
emphasis is science and engineer
ing but the design is meant to
look attractive to others as well.
