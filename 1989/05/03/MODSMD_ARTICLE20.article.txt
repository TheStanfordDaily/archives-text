# Mock kidnapping dramatized fear felt by Salvadorans
## 
### 
On April 30, we were part of a
group, dressed in combat gear and
with masks over our faces, that burst
into three dining halls and staged a
mock abduction of students.
Although our chosen "victims" knew

in advance what was to happen, their
friends did not. Many were shocked,
afraid, even outraged. In Wilbur, some
students even tried to intercede and, in
fact, rescued one of our two "victims."
Although we never anticipated such a
strong reaction, we greatly respect the
anger students expressed, and their
urge to help those who were abducted.
We regret and apologize for the fact
that some students were considerably
upset.
The action was far more realistic
than we had foreseen, but that was
precisely the point. This was not meant
as a joke. We intended to dramatize,
though on a much smaller scale, the
fear that Salvadoran students feel
every day when they or one of their
friends "disappears."
