## Life: the abridged version 
### 
TRIVIAL PURSUIT IS easily one of
the most popular games of the dec
ade. It became a cultural obsession,
and everyone I know has played it. But
its popularity illustrates the scary prob
lem of the simplification phenomenon the
world faces today. The name of the game
itself suggests that its purpose lies in the
pursuit of trivialities.
And that is indeed the object of the
game: the person who spits out the most
answers to trivial questions wins. The
game doesn't test skill and critical think
ing, but knowledge of trivia. Unfortu
nately, its popularity reflects our culture,
showing that the values of our age have
shifted towards the simple, the trivial,
in response to the increasing complexity
of the world.
Contemporary Czech writer Milan
Kundera recently remarked that "modern
society encourages journalistic thinking.
That's what dominates. Journalistic
thinking is fast thinking. It doesn't per
mit real thought, and its vision of the
world is naturally very simplified."
Both televised and print news illustrate
this simplification phenomenon. Looking
at the reasons behind the success of
Trivial Pursuit, the massive circulation
of the newspaper USA Today hardly
surprises me.
Gannett's innovative 1982 idea for a
national newspaper left local papers in
awe, yet the idea works on the same
principles of mass simplification that at
tracts people. The paper's success should
not be surprising, as its simplified news
is what sells.
The past few decades have been called

the "age of information." The threatening
overflow of information has fostered the
spread of simplification. What results is
a newspaper that reports international,
national and local news, weather and
editorials in the space of about 12 pages
(with room for advertisements). It's been
called the "Cliffs Notes" of the world,
and its circulation edges toward 6 million.
TV news at best spends three minutes
covering one story. It lacks the investi
gative analysis necessary for actual un
derstanding. Like the trivia games, it
conforms to society's drive for hurried
information.
And just as TV news compacts the
news, other TV programs present life in
abridged format. The shows condense life
into neat half-hour or one-hour blocks in
which the characters resolve a large prob
lem.
Most shows, in order to attract their
audience, try to end on a positive note,
which means that all conflicts are settled
by the end of the short period of time,
sometimes through near-impossible
methods.
Say you're watching an adventure show
that started at 8 p.m. You know that by
8:28, just before the long commercial
break, the hero will be knocked out or
in danger of losing his life, with no ap
parent means of escape. But by 8:48, the
dramatic finale begins, perhaps including
a chase scene, and by 8:52 the bad guv
is caught, killed or otherwise down the
tubes.
Television only offers idealized and
simplified solutions to problems. And
consequently, through excessive exposure

to television, people soon expect (or at
least want) their own problems at home
and at work to be easily solved. They
create simplified ideological models of
reality in their minds.
Inevitably, these problems of real life
turn out to be more complicated than
television portrays them, and the viewer's
self-deception ends in frustration and res
ignation. A worker moves from job to
job, and marriages easily end in divorce
since problems cannot be quickly re
solved.
The high rates of divorce, unemploy
ment, teen runaways, etc., may be par
tially influenced by cultural simplification
through television.
The whole problem boils down to how
we question things. Author Robert Pirsig
points out that '"What's new?' is an in
teresting and broadening eternal ques
tion, but one which, if pursued exclus
ively, results only in an endless parade
of trivia and fashion, the slit of tomorrow.
I would like, instead, to be concerned
with the question 'What is best?,' a ques
tion which cuts deeply -ather than broad
ly, a question whose answers tend to move
the slit downstream."

Say you're watching an adventure show
that started at 8 p.m. You know that by
8:28, just before the long commercial
break, the hero will be knocked out or
in danger of losing his life, with no ap
parent means of escape. But by 8:48, the
dramatic finale begins, perhaps including
a chase scene, and by 8:52 the bad guv
is caught, killed or otherwise down the
tubes.
Television only offers idealized and
simplified solutions to problems. And
consequently, through excessive exposure

to television, people soon expect (or at
least want) their own problems at home
and at work to be easily solved. They
create simplified ideological models of
reality in their minds.
Inevitably, these problems of real life
turn out to be more complicated than
television portrays them, and the viewer's
self-deception ends in frustration and res
ignation. A worker moves from job to
job, and marriages easily end in divorce
since problems cannot be quickly re
solved.
The high rates of divorce, unemploy
ment, teen runaways, etc., may be par
tially influenced by cultural simplification
through television.
The whole problem boils down to how
we question things. Author Robert Pirsig
points out that '"What's new?' is an in
teresting and broadening eternal ques
tion, but one which, if pursued exclus
ively, results only in an endless parade
of trivia and fashion, the slit of tomorrow.
I would like, instead, to be concerned
with the question 'What is best?,' a ques
tion which cuts deeply -ather than broad
ly, a question whose answers tend to move
the slit downstream."
