/""V . A couple of weeks ago,
vy • the moon was in a cres
cent, but the rest of the moon
was still slightly visible in front
of the dark sky. If the crescent
is the part lit up by the sun,
how did light get to the other
side of the moon ?
A. According to Astronomy
• Research Associate Jef
frey Morgan, the rest of the
moon is still visible because of
a double bounce of sunlight.
"Earth-shine" is sunlight
reflected from the earth to the
moon and back to the earth.
The dark section is barely
visible because the earth is a
poor reflector of light.
"Lunar halos," the rings
around the moon, are similar
to rainbows. They are produced
by the refraction, or the ben
ding, of moonlight in a thin
layer of ice particles in the
earth's atmosphere. The ring
is produced by the unique prop
erties of the ice particles.
From an observer's point of
view, the light ring appears to
be on the moon. It usually ap
pears white because human
night-vision cannot distinguish
other colors as well.
According to the famous poet

Samuel Coleridge, a new moon
with an "old Moon in her lap"
is a sign of impending mayhem
and destruction.
• Why can't you throw a
Vy • marble as far as a base
baft?
A. According to Aeronautics
• and Astronautics Asst.
Prof. Ilan Kroo, the "square
cube law," the same law that
limits the size of many animals,
may explain why you can throw
a baseball farther than a
marble.
If an object, such as marble,
were to increase in size, its
mass and momentum will in
crease by the cube of the
change in the diameter. How
ever, the air resistance and sur
face area will only increase by
the square of the change in the
diameter.
A large marble the size of a
baseball would travel farther
because the momentum in
creases faster than the decel
erating force of "air resis
tance." As the mass of an object
decreases, air resistance be
comes more significant. For ex
ample, you can't throw a grain
of sand as far as you can throw
a rock.
This principle also applies to
fleas and the strength of ob
jects. As a flea gets larger, its
mass is cubed while its strength
is only squared. A flea the size
of a human, about the same
size as the main character in
the movie "The Fly," wouldn't
be able to jump because of its
greatly increased mass.
In order to apply the
"square-cube law," however,
the initial velocity, the mass
and the flight time of both ob
jects must be the same. Unlike
sand and rocks, baseballs and
marbles complicate calcula
tions and might not be subject
to this law because they have
different densities, according to
Mechanical Engineering Prof.
Daniel Deßra.
Distance marble and baseball
throwing have only recently be
come popular sports, and there
is insufficient data to draw any
conclusions. The marble dis
tance throwers of the world are
eagerly waiting for someone
who hasn't lost his or her
marbles to collect data and
complete a study in this revolu-
