# Chaos reigns over order in the universe
## Stanford researchers study chaos in fluid motion and Newton's laws of physics 
### Tanya Paull 
Part of the realm of every sci
ence — including the science of
human nature — is subject to
randomness.
Every day, Stanford scientists
seem to come even closer to find
ing the factor of uncertainty in
every dynamic system that ac
counts for much of the unpredict
ability in life. But whether they
be in global weather patterns, eco
nomics, fluid dynamics, political
science or biology, many simple
phenomena are left unexplained.
How does smoke rise from a
burning cigarette? How do the
prices of commodities fluctuate on
periodic cycles? How do blood ves
sels intertwine at the most micro
scopic level?
Still no answers, of course; but
scientists are now noticing that
some of these mysteries are more
structurally and mathematically
related than was previously
believed.
The occurrence of randomness
in every natural and man-made
system is certainly not new, but
scientists are now beginning to
put more emphasis on the phe
nomenon itself and the thin,
maybe nonexistent, line between
order and chaos.
For instance, Mechanical Engi
neering Prof. Parviz Moin studies
the chaos inherent in turbulent
fluid flow. "Turbulence," he said,
"is one of the 10 outstanding prob
lems in classical physics."
Turbulent flow is so unpredict
able, even in the simplest system
like liquid flowing through a pipe,
because the end result is so sensi
tive to the initial conditions of
the system. Even microscopic dif
ferences in the placement of indi
vidual fluid elements can make a
surprising change in the final out
come.
This quality, combined with the
non-linearity of fluid flow, means
that the eventual appearance of
most fluid systems will be com
pletely random and incredibly
complex. Non-linear equations,
which involve a complicated inter
dependency between variables, are
often impossible to solve analyti
cally.
To graph the movement of the
simplest turbulent flow on a com
puter requires 2 million grid

points and a hundred hours of
supercomputer time. This type of
movement is still too complicated
for scientists to manage or control.
Moin, however, and others at
Stanford's Center for Turbulence
Research, are trying to find bits
and pieces of similar patterns
within supposedly chaotic flow.
For instance, the familiar appear
ance of a bathtub vortex may be
very deterministic; yet when
many of these are combined, they
give rise to complex, incoherent
patterns.
If scientists like Moin are able
to locate the order within the ran
domness of turbulence, virtually
every system involving fluid flow
could be improved. From the
problem of drag in aircraft design
to the mystery of turbulent
mixing in internal combustion en
gines, scientists might eventually
be able to predict and control dy
namics of the flow.
Moin and colleagues have al
ready made advances in this re
spect with their computer
simulation of a "smart wall" —
a surface that would sense pat
terns in the air flow above it and
respond by moving small sections
of the wall slightly to minimize
air resistance.

Very simple laws
can appear to be,
at times, com
pletely chaotic.

Theoretically, a "smart wall"
placed on an airplane wing could
decrease air resistance by as much
as 20 percent, according to cal
culations. About 40 percent of the
fuel consumption by commercial
airplanes is used to overcome air
resistance caused by turbulence,
Moin said.
The difficulty with studying
fluid dynamics, researchers say,
is that turbulence is both deter
ministic and probabilistic. As
Moin explained, "Anytime you
have a system that is composed
of both elements, you can't really
use the tools from one side or the
other — you have to create your
own new science."

Despite the insights of research
ers like Moin, scientists still can
not predict the precise behavior
of two fluids mixing together. Nor
can they accurately anticipate
changes in global weather pat
terns or explain the complex
rhythms of the human heart, even
though the physical nature of
these systems and the laws that
dictate them are well defined.
Increasingly, though, patterns
are being found which suggest
that seemingly chaotic phenomena
are not necessarily random in
origin. For example, systems that
almost, but never quite, repeat
themselves — like the exact move
ment of the planets, the rotation
and flow of a waterwheel, or the
movement of a fluid as it is being
heated or cooled — have almost,
but never quite, been understood.
Math Prof. Donald Ornstein
has also studied the paradoxical
relationship between order and
randomness, but he explores
chaos through a different perspec
tive — theoretical mathematics.
In an article published in a Jan
uary issue of the journal Science,
Ornstein proved mathematically
the possibility of a certain kind
of deterministic chaos.
By taking a simple mathemat
ical model of the trajectories of a
billiard ball and comparing the
result to a random coin-tossing
system, Ornstein showed that the
same Newton's laws can produce

the same outcome as chance.
Just as scientists have shown
there is some degree of order pres
ent in apparent chaos, Ornstein
has shown that chaos can also be
lurking in the most simplistic,
most deterministic kind of order.
Students in introductory
physics courses are always taught
Newton's laws using ideal, over
simplified examples — the classic
pendulum with no air resistance
and frictionless rope, for instance.
Of course this is necessary at first
to learn how to use Newton's laws.
But physicists often assume
that in any system, if all of the
extraneous details were accounted
for — friction, air resistance, en
vironmental noise, a graduate stu
dent bumping into the experiment
set-up — then the universal phys
ical laws would hold perfectly, and
we would be able to predict the
behavior of any physical system.
With the development of chaos
theory, scientists like Ornstein
have come to believe there is non
linearity actually built into the
systems themselves.
It won't be an earth-shattering
discovery like that of relativity,
but neither will it go unnoticed.
Because the realization that an
other factor is involved in dy
namic systems — one that
depends on, and yet defies, com
plete chaos — will slowly
revolutionize our understanding
of natural processes.

Cigarette smoke rises in a seemingly ordered fashion and soon
breaks into chaos.
Part of the realm of every sci
ence — including the science of
human nature — is subject to
randomness.
Every day, Stanford scientists
seem to come even closer to find
ing the factor of uncertainty in
every dynamic system that ac
counts for much of the unpredict
ability in life. But whether they
be in global weather patterns, eco
nomics, fluid dynamics, political
science or biology, many simple
phenomena are left unexplained.
How does smoke rise from a
burning cigarette? How do the
prices of commodities fluctuate on
periodic cycles? How do blood ves
sels intertwine at the most micro
scopic level?
Still no answers, of course; but
scientists are now noticing that
some of these mysteries are more
structurally and mathematically
related than was previously
believed.
The occurrence of randomness
in every natural and man-made
system is certainly not new, but
scientists are now beginning to
put more emphasis on the phe
nomenon itself and the thin,
maybe nonexistent, line between
order and chaos.
For instance, Mechanical Engi
neering Prof. Parviz Moin studies
the chaos inherent in turbulent
fluid flow. "Turbulence," he said,
"is one of the 10 outstanding prob
lems in classical physics."
Turbulent flow is so unpredict
able, even in the simplest system
like liquid flowing through a pipe,
because the end result is so sensi
tive to the initial conditions of
the system. Even microscopic dif
ferences in the placement of indi
vidual fluid elements can make a
surprising change in the final out
come.
This quality, combined with the
non-linearity of fluid flow, means
that the eventual appearance of
most fluid systems will be com
pletely random and incredibly
complex. Non-linear equations,
which involve a complicated inter
dependency between variables, are
often impossible to solve analyti
cally.
To graph the movement of the
simplest turbulent flow on a com
puter requires 2 million grid

points and a hundred hours of
supercomputer time. This type of
movement is still too complicated
for scientists to manage or control.
Moin, however, and others at
Stanford's Center for Turbulence
Research, are trying to find bits
and pieces of similar patterns
within supposedly chaotic flow.
For instance, the familiar appear
ance of a bathtub vortex may be
very deterministic; yet when
many of these are combined, they
give rise to complex, incoherent
patterns.
If scientists like Moin are able
to locate the order within the ran
domness of turbulence, virtually
every system involving fluid flow
could be improved. From the
problem of drag in aircraft design
to the mystery of turbulent
mixing in internal combustion en
gines, scientists might eventually
be able to predict and control dy
namics of the flow.
Moin and colleagues have al
ready made advances in this re
spect with their computer
simulation of a "smart wall" —
a surface that would sense pat
terns in the air flow above it and
respond by moving small sections
of the wall slightly to minimize
air resistance.

Very simple laws
can appear to be,
at times, com
pletely chaotic.

Theoretically, a "smart wall"
placed on an airplane wing could
decrease air resistance by as much
as 20 percent, according to cal
culations. About 40 percent of the
fuel consumption by commercial
airplanes is used to overcome air
resistance caused by turbulence,
Moin said.
The difficulty with studying
fluid dynamics, researchers say,
is that turbulence is both deter
ministic and probabilistic. As
Moin explained, "Anytime you
have a system that is composed
of both elements, you can't really
use the tools from one side or the
other — you have to create your
own new science."

Despite the insights of research
ers like Moin, scientists still can
not predict the precise behavior
of two fluids mixing together. Nor
can they accurately anticipate
changes in global weather pat
terns or explain the complex
rhythms of the human heart, even
though the physical nature of
these systems and the laws that
dictate them are well defined.
Increasingly, though, patterns
are being found which suggest
that seemingly chaotic phenomena
are not necessarily random in
origin. For example, systems that
almost, but never quite, repeat
themselves — like the exact move
ment of the planets, the rotation
and flow of a waterwheel, or the
movement of a fluid as it is being
heated or cooled — have almost,
but never quite, been understood.
Math Prof. Donald Ornstein
has also studied the paradoxical
relationship between order and
randomness, but he explores
chaos through a different perspec
tive — theoretical mathematics.
In an article published in a Jan
uary issue of the journal Science,
Ornstein proved mathematically
the possibility of a certain kind
of deterministic chaos.
By taking a simple mathemat
ical model of the trajectories of a
billiard ball and comparing the
result to a random coin-tossing
system, Ornstein showed that the
same Newton's laws can produce

the same outcome as chance.
Just as scientists have shown
there is some degree of order pres
ent in apparent chaos, Ornstein
has shown that chaos can also be
lurking in the most simplistic,
most deterministic kind of order.
Students in introductory
physics courses are always taught
Newton's laws using ideal, over
simplified examples — the classic
pendulum with no air resistance
and frictionless rope, for instance.
Of course this is necessary at first
to learn how to use Newton's laws.
But physicists often assume
that in any system, if all of the
extraneous details were accounted
for — friction, air resistance, en
vironmental noise, a graduate stu
dent bumping into the experiment
set-up — then the universal phys
ical laws would hold perfectly, and
we would be able to predict the
behavior of any physical system.
With the development of chaos
theory, scientists like Ornstein
have come to believe there is non
linearity actually built into the
systems themselves.
It won't be an earth-shattering
discovery like that of relativity,
but neither will it go unnoticed.
Because the realization that an
other factor is involved in dy
namic systems — one that
depends on, and yet defies, com
plete chaos — will slowly
revolutionize our understanding
of natural processes.
