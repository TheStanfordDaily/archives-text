Cardinal 3, Gaels 1

The Cardinal improved to 24-27
on the season with its third
straight victory. Stanford took the
final two games of a three-game
set last weekend against No. 2
Arizona. St. Mary's dropped its
second of the season to the Car
dinal and fell to 17-36.
"We're playing better. We
pitched very well and played real
good defense today," Stanford
Coach Mark Marquess said.
"You hope that it will carry over
(to the weekend). A lot depends
on how you pitch. We've been get
ting some good pitching perform
ances, last weekend against
Arizona and today," he added.
Carper (3-1) surrendered just
three hits while fanning five and
walking two. He encountered mild
trouble in two of the five innings
he worked.
A pair of walks in the fourth
left men on first and second with
two out, but he retired Gael third
baseman Jeff Leantini on a fly
ball to center to end the inning.
In the fifth, Carper gave up a
pair of solid, two-out singles to
second baseman Art Shields and
shortstop Brian Keegan, but
rightfielder Lee Dongallo's line
drive to center was caught for out
number three.
"He threw stirkes. He had good
command. He's got a real good
fastball. He just needs to pitch,
to log some innings. He just has

to believe in himself," Cardinal
pitching coach Tom Dunton said.
Gaels' starter Dennis Scully ab
sorbed a difficult loss. He went
seven innings, allowing just two
runs on seven hits. His record
dropped to 3-4.
Carey's two homers — one a
mammoth shot over the 407-foot

sign in center, the other to deep
right — moved him past Mark
Davis into third place on the Stan
ford career home-run list with 37,
tied with Eric Hardgrave and Tom
Guardino. Carey leads the Cardi
nal with 13 this season, his high
est single-season total in three
years on the Farm.

"Carey's really been swinging
the hat well. Hopefully it'll keep
up a couple more weeks," Mar
quess said.
Solomon's solo blast — a line
shot that cleared the right field
fence in the sixth — was his
fourth four-bagger of the season.
Freshman Steve Worrell pitched

the final four innings for Stan
ford, surrendering a run on three
hits. Worrell fanned three while
walking one. He picked up his
first save of the year.
Stanford now looks to this
weekend's final Pacific 10 South
ern Division series against
California.

Sophomore Stan Spencer (2-7)
will start on Friday for the Car
dinal after last Friday's hard-luck
outing against the Wildcats.
Senior Brian Keyser <5-3) will
start Satu day on the heels of th
best outing of his career — a
complete-game victory over hard
hitting Arizona last Saturday.
