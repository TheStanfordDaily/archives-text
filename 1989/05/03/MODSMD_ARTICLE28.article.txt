# Midweek games prove vital
## 
### Bruce Sarkisian Senior staff writer 
MORAGA, Calif. — In the
1989 season, Stanford will play
30 Pacific 10 Southern Division
games and 28 games against
non-league opponents, most of
them during the middle of the
week.
Although the team is cur
rently well below .500 in the
league at 10-17, its non
conference record is much bet
ter at 14-10.
The tendency is to think that
midweek games are unimpor
tant contests that the Cardinal
uses to pad its record. But oc
casionally Stanford is caught
napping, as in a loss to San
Francisco, a team that has al
ready lost over 30 games, ear
lier in the year.
Both Cardinal coaches and
players find the midweek con
tests valuable and will tell you
that the last two national
championship seasons would
not have been possible without
the midweek schedule.
"I think that the midweek
games are just as important as
the conference games because
they give us a chance to work
on things," reserve outfielder
Jack Hollis said.
Some of the games often turn
into blowouts by the middle in
nings, but it is not hard for

the players to keep their con
centration.
"As a hitter, you are in it
during every at-bat because
you can just swing away. They
usually don't put a play on and
there are very few take signs,"
Hollis added.
Cardinal pitching coach Tom
Dunton uses the midweek
game to find out which of his
bullpen pitchers have the stuff
to pitch in the weekend con
ference series.
"Sure, guys can pitch their
way from a midweek game to
the weekend series, but it goes
both ways," Dunton said.
Brian Keyser is a prime ex
ample. He pitched well enough
in the midweek games last year
to earn a 3-0 record and a spot
as the team's third starter this
year. His midweek start against
Fresno State last week proba
bly helped him to pitch his first
complete game ever against Ar
izona last weekend.
"Even though it is just a mid
week game, you have to keep
up the concentration. If you
want to be a good team you
have to concentrate," second
baseman Frank Carey said.
"You have to have pride in
your own performance, and the
good, consistent player gives
100 percent every game. It's
not who we're playing, it's how
we play," Carey said.
