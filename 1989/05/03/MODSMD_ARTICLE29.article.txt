Surprise, surprise, surprise.
Capping off perhaps the finest career in
Stanford basketball history, the man called
the greatest Cardinal player ever received one
final feather for his cap. Todd Lichti, breaker
of 22 school and Pacific 10 Conference records,
was named the men's basketball team's Most
Valuable Player at last night's annual banquet.
An Associated Press Third-Team Ail-
American who was deemed by many as the
best shooting guard in the nation this year,
Lichti was the natural and inevitable choice
for the honor. He averaged 20.1 points and
five rebounds per game this past season, 18.8
and 5.3 over the course of his 124-game Car
dinal career.
The tallies were sufficient to make him the
all-time scoring leader and the second most
prolific scorer in Pac-10 history with 2,336
points, behind AP Player of the Year Sean
Elliott of Arizona. Lichti maintains the edge
in league games and retires as the career top
scorer in conference contests.
Fellow senior Eric Reveno was named Most
Inspirational Player after rebounding from
back injury and moving into the starting center
role.
Another senior, Howard Wright, received the
prestigious Howie Dallmar Award, named after
one of the Cardinal's great players and coaches
and bestowed upon the individual who dis
played excellence on and off the court.
Surprise, surprise, surprise.
