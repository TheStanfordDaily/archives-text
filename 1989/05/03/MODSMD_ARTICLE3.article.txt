# Free speech flier fuels COP race
## 
### John Wagner Editorial staff 
A flier on free speech has triggered
another round of back-and-forthing be
tween slates in the ASSU Council of
Presidents race.
The flier attacks past quotes on free
speech by senior Canetta Ivy, a current
COP member and a member of the Stu
dent Conduct Legislative Council. Both
the present COP slate and the Slate of
the Times are sponsored by the People's
Platform.
Slate of the Times member David
Brown told The Daily last night that
he saw a "suspicious" connection be
tween the opposing Students' Choice
slate and the Stanford Federalist Soci
ety, the group which distributed be
tween 200 and 300 copies of the flier

in dining halls across campus.
The Federalist Society is a group of
conservative and libertarian law stu
dents and is "very pro-free speech," ac
cording to the group's president, Neil
Morganbesser.
Brown said he was concerned by the
possibility that the flier was used by
Students' Choice as a "way to get
around" campaign spending limits. The
combined spending limit for the COP
election and runoff is $300.
Students' Choice member Frank
Quaratiello said Brown's charges were
unfounded. According to Quaratiello,
Students' Choice knew the Federalist
Society would be distributing the flier
but "never gave approval because it was
not our place."
According to Morganbesser, the flier
was independently produced by the

Federalist Society and is not intended
as an endorsement of the Students'
Choice slate.
The primary concern of the Federalist
Society is not the COP election, but
protecting free speech, Morganbesser
said. "(The flier) is an endorsement of
the pro-free speech position taken by
Students' Choice," he explained.
Elections commissioner Steve Krauss
told The Daily last night that since the
Students Choice slate did not print the
flier, they would not be charged for it.
Krauss said Brown had yet to back
up his charges and that the ASSU
Bylaws do not address such scenarios.
According to Krauss, if a formal com
plaint is issued by Slate of the Times,
the issue will be resolved by a hearing
committee after the election.
