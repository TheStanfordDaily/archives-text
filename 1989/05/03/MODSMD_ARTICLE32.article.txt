# Men netters break the Waves, 6-1

### Cameron Macky Senior staff writer 
The Pepperdine Waves rolled
into the Stanford Tennis Stadium
yesterday, hoping for an upset win
that would help their chances of
receiving an NCAA tournament
berth.
Wrong.
Even though the Stanford
men's tennis team has been doing
a swell imitation of the Walking
Wounded lately, the Cardinal still
had no trouble with the Waves,
wrapping up the match in singles.

Men's Tennis
Cardinal 6, Waves 1

Most of the day's excitement
came in Jeff Tarango's match
against Grant Saaks. Tarango
spotted Saaks a one-set lead and
then, up 4-1 in the second, made
things interesting by dropping the
next three games. Serving at four
all, Tarango then missed three
straight serves. "Hit the damn
thing in!" he screamed. Of course,
the next serve was an ace, but
Saaks won the game anyway to
go up 5-4.
Tarango broke right back to get
even, rediscovered his serve to go
up 6-5, and then broke Saaks

again to take the set.
Things came to a boil in the
fourth game of the third set.
Tarango called a Saaks serve wide,
and Saaks politely implied that
Tarango was full of manure.
Tarango then joined Saaks at the
net, looked at where Saaks had
said the ball hit, nodded politely,
and said "Out," as he walked
away.
"Out of your reach," Saaks
retorted.
"Out of your league," Tarango
replied in kind.
Tarango called a let on the next
serve (wouldn't you?), but Saaks
won the point and game anyway.
The two stayed on serve until
Tarango came up with two gor
geous passing shots to go up 5-3.
He then served out the match,
winning 3-6, 7-5, 6-3.
Considering the rest of the Car
dinal's state of health (or lack of
health) yesterday, the Waves blew
a beautiful opportunity for an up
set. For the second straight
match, Stanford played without
No. 2 man Jeff Cathrall, who
didn't play singles in order to rest
his left wrist. Cathrall was sched
uled to play doubles, but was
pulled after Stanford wrapped up
the team win.
Alex O'Brien did play, but his
right shoulder is still turning his
serve into a prayer. By the third

set of his 6-4, 1-6, 6-1 win over
David Wells-Roth at No. 3,
O'Brien was serving so weakly
that he probably could have done
just as well hitting the ball left
handed. He is scheduled to be ex
amined by a doctor today.
That doctor may want to check
out the rest of the team as well.
Barry Richards and Martin Black
man both played, but had to fight
off the flu to do so. Richards didn't
practice Monday and wasn't at
full strength for his match at fifth
singles with Brian Dick. The flu
must have really been bothering
him, because he took over an hour
to put Dick away, 6-4, 6-2. Ric
hards is now 16-1.
As for Blackman, he got off to
shaky start, but downed Tomer
Zimmerman 7-6, 6-3, giving the
Hospital Crew a 3-0 record.
The healthy members of the
team, meanwhile, were holding
their own. Tarango took care of
Saaks, but Glenn Solomon, play
ing at No. 4, suffered his first
loss in almost a month, 6-3, 6-2
to Christophe Van De Weghe.
Curtis Dunn, after dropping a
break at the start of the third
set, bounced back for a 4-6, 6-0,
6-3 win at No. 6.
"I'm really proud of Curtis. He
came in and did a great job,"
Gould said. "In all, this was a
great team effort."

Stanford's Jeff Tarango and Grant Saaks of Pepperdine argue over a first-service call yesterday.
Tarango called the serve long and prevailed in the argument, but lost the point and the game.
