# Off to court: USW workers air complaints at staged tribunal
## 
### Mike Friedly 
In a tribunal staged yesterday
by the United Stanford Workers
at the Law School, a dozen Stan
ford workers publicly aired griev
ances against the University,
saying it discriminates in its treat
ment of minorities, women, dis
abled workers and homosexuals.
With the school's Moot Court
room as a backdrop, the "Tribunal
on Employment Discrimination,"
consisting of five members of the
San Francisco-based Coalition for
Civil Rights, listened to three
hours of testimony from past and
present Stanford employees. Ac
cording to Chair Eva Paterson of
the San Francisco Lawyer's Com
mittee on Urban Affairs, the panel
will take "an impartial look" at
the grievances before submitting
a report to the University.
Several members of the Bay
Area media corps watched the
event, including radio and TV cor

respondents.
According to USW field repre
sentative Rodney Barnette, about
75 invitations were issued to Uni
versity officials and managers, in
cluding one to each member of
the Board of Trustees and one
hand-delivered to University
President Donald Kennedy.
However, none of them came.
Director of University Relations
Stephen Peeps later said in an
interview with University News
Service that the University does
not discuss individual grievances
because of confidentiality guide
lines.
The charges focused on exam
ples of "blatant racism and
sexism" by Stanford managers
against their workers, according
to USW Steward Linda Crouse.
Robert Ignacio, a Filipino who
works for Campus Mail, said one
of his supervisors continually calls
him "Bobo" — which he knew
meant "stupid" in Spanish,

despite protests from Ignacio. He
also quoted his white supervisor
as saying, "I feel I've hired too
many minorities already," in a
grievance meeting between the
University and the USW.
Another grievance was filed by
Debbie Britt of the Stanford Med
ical Center. Britt said her duties
as a Life Science technician, a job
which is dominated by women,
were comparable to those of Sci
ence and Engineering technicians,
a mostly male job. Despite this,
Britt said, these women are paid
between 7 and 21 percent less
than the men for essentially the
same work.
Britt filed her complaint with
the University in January 1983,
but it will not reach arbitration
until next September. This il
lustrates a common complaint of
the USW, that the University is
slow to process grievances.


James Rucker — Daily
Stanford groundskeeper Soane Masifilo airs his grievances against the University before judges in
the mock Tribunal on Employment Discrimination," staged by representatives of the United Stanford
Workers in the Law School yesterday.
One worker in the Operations
and Maintenance Department
complained to the tribunal about
his treatment after his supervisors
discovered that he was gay. Stan
Shaver said he once "brought a
lover to a Christmas party," and
was told never to do it again by
one of his supervisors. And when
Shaver asked a supervisor a
simple job-related question, he
was allegedly told: "Get away
from me. I don't associate with
people like you."
According to Barnette, much of
the problem lies with the Univer
sity's use of the arbitration pro
cedures. All arbitration between
the USW and the University is
handled by a panel of six members
of the American Arbitration As

sociation. The USW has 200 griev
ances filed with the University,
which are usually handled by
Stanford at the rate of about two
per month.
Another difficulty for the USW
is the expense of the arbitration
proceedings, which usually costs
both the union and the University
$2,000 a day, on average. When
asked by a member of the tribunal
whether the University has some
times skipped an arbitration
hearing in order to increase USW
expenses, the frustrated Barnette
answered, "yes," with a theatrical
gasp.
After pointing out the nine
paintings of white male Law
School deans that hung in the
courtroom as representative of
discrimination, USW lawyer Jim
Eggleston made specific proposals
for the University to fight the
problem.

An independent commission,
staffed by elected representatives
of University groups, should be
established to investigate
manager-employee relations, Eg
gleston said. He also suggested
counseling for University manag
ers to make them more sensitive
to discrimination.
