# Off to court: USW workers air complaints at staged tribunal
## 
### Mike Friedly 
In a tribunal staged yesterday
by the United Stanford Workers
at the Law School, a dozen Stan
ford workers publicly aired griev
ances against the University,
saying it discriminates in its treat
ment of minorities, women, dis
abled workers and homosexuals.
With the school's Moot Court
room as a backdrop, the "Tribunal
on Employment Discrimination,"
consisting of five members of the
San Francisco-based Coalition for
Civil Rights, listened to three
hours of testimony from past and
present Stanford employees. Ac
cording to Chair Eva Paterson of
the San Francisco Lawyer's Com
mittee on Urban Affairs, the panel
will take "an impartial look" at
the grievances before submitting
a report to the University.
Several members of the Bay
Area media corps watched the
event, including radio and TV cor

respondents.
According to USW field repre
sentative Rodney Barnette, about
75 invitations were issued to Uni
versity officials and managers, in
cluding one to each member of
the Board of Trustees and one
hand-delivered to University
President Donald Kennedy.
However, none of them came.
Director of University Relations
Stephen Peeps later said in an
interview with University News
Service that the University does
not discuss individual grievances
because of confidentiality guide
lines.
The charges focused on exam
ples of "blatant racism and
sexism" by Stanford managers
against their workers, according
to USW Steward Linda Crouse.
Robert Ignacio, a Filipino who
works for Campus Mail, said one
of his supervisors continually calls
him "Bobo" — which he knew
meant "stupid" in Spanish,

despite protests from Ignacio. He
also quoted his white supervisor
as saying, "I feel I've hired too
many minorities already," in a
grievance meeting between the
University and the USW.
Another grievance was filed by
Debbie Britt of the Stanford Med
ical Center. Britt said her duties
as a Life Science technician, a job
which is dominated by women,
were comparable to those of Sci
ence and Engineering technicians,
a mostly male job. Despite this,
Britt said, these women are paid
between 7 and 21 percent less
than the men for essentially the
same work.
Britt filed her complaint with
the University in January 1983,
but it will not reach arbitration
until next September. This il
lustrates a common complaint of
the USW, that the University is
slow to process grievances.
