## University returns Axe to Tresidder display case 
### Craig Mallery 
In an emergency, don't break that glass case
next to the fire alarm in the first-floor Tresidder
lobby. Despite what you may think, the axe
inside is just for show.
After an 18-month delay, the Stanford Axe
went back on display Monday in Tresidder Union,
fully protected by an elahorate alarm system.
In November 1987, the Cardinal football team
reclaimed the Axe from Cal, and last fall kept
it with a tie. But the traditional trophy hasn't
been in its display case because the University
was slow to fix the alarm system, according to
University Bursar Jon Erickson, who advises the
student committee that cares for the Axe.
The return of the Axe comes at an optimal
time for the former Axe Committee, which has
renamed itself the "Stanford Axe/Big (lame Bon
fire Committee." Denied $34,000 in special fee
funding in last month's ASSU election, the com
mittee will be seeking $20,000 in a special ASSU
election today and tomorrow.
Committee chair Pat Broun said that the
timing of the special election and the Axe's reap
pearance is coincidental because the University
had decided before the first election that the
case would be fixed between April 24 and 28.
"The case was fixed on April 28," Broun said,
"and we put the Axe in its case on May 1."
The problem with the case began two years
ago, Erickson said, when Stanford began replac
ing its outdated alarm system. At that time,
UC-Berkeley held the Axe, and the case's security
system was disconnected. However, installation
of the new system was delayed by problems with
hardware, software and telephone line connec
tions.
Erickson described the situation as "one delay
after another. Ever since we won the Axe back.

we have been continually asking
them. When can we have the
alarms back?" But alarms for li
braries and student residences
took a higher priority, he said.
Broun said the Axe could not
have been returned to its case
sooner, because "without the se
curity system there was a high
probability of a Weenie theft."
Three times, Berkeley thieves
have tried to snatch the Axe, he
said, and each time the alarm sys
tem notified the police and the
Axe was saved.
Erickson apologized that the
Axe had not been on display, but
said that the committee "has tried
to compensate by getting the Axe

out to other settings such as the
Cal basketball games and taking
it around to the dorms."
Erickson and the committeee
have also been working on estab
lishing a Stanford Heritage Cen
ter, envisioned as a 17-foot-long,
floor-to-ceiling display case in
Tresidder's second-floor lounge.
The Axe and its history would be
displayed alongside a larger ex
hibit of Stanford history and
memorabilia.
The first-floor lobby, where the
present display case is, resembles
a bus station, Erickson said, and
is not a conducive place for
viewing.
The Heritage Center is an offi
cial Centennial fundraising proj
ect, with $16,000 in donations so
far, toward a goal of $60,000.
Erickson said the center may
begin construction early next
year.
