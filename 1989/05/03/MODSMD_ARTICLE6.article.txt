# Trustees urge curtailment of South African trading
## 
### Brad Hayward Senior staff writer 
A Board of Trustees committee has voted
to support two shareholder resolutions ur
ging companies to curtail their operations
in South Africa.
The board's Special Committee on In
vestment Responsibility agreed by phone
Monday to support resolutions facing Chev
ron Oil and the Interpublic Group, an ad
vertising and marketing communications
firm. The University owns stock in both
companies.
The committee, which is given power
over some investment policies by the full
board, first voted for a resolution that calls
for Chevron to end sales to the South
African government of petroleum and pe
troleum products that are then used by
the state military and police.
"This is consistent with the policy (the
board's) had all along," said Bob Freelen,
vice president for public affairs. "That is,

if companies are going to be [in South
Africa] at all, they ought not to be doing
business with apartheid-enforcing agen
cies."
Stanford's share of Chevron stock is es
timated at $1.7 million.
A second resolution approved by the com
mittee calls for Interpublic to sever all eco
nomic ties with South Africa. The Univer
sity's share of that companv is valued at
$662,625.
Herb Dwight, one of five trustees on the
committee, said yesterday that the com
mittee was disturbed that Interpublic has
not agreed to abide by the Sullivan Prin
ciples, an international statement of stand
ards by which a company's efforts to com
bat apartheid are measured.
"They have elected to abide by measures
put forth by the State Department, which
we regard as being insufficient," Dwight
said.
