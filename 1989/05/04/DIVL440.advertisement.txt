We'd never compromise
our standards for a
couple bucks.
Would you?
Do you ever wonder why other pizza
restaurants have to give you something
to get you to eat their pizza—a couple
bucks off the pnce, a liter of cola, two
pizzas for one 7 Do you think it might
be because of their pizza?
At Applewood, we only give you one
thing—a consistently great pizza.
Thick, nch, and heavy with cheese and
toppings. All on our famous crust.
Because we're in the business for one
reason—to serve a temfic pizza. After
all, if we wanted to be nch, we never
would have opened a restaurant.
It's not jnst pizza at Applewood.
