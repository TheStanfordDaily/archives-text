# Quest for senior speaker stays alive

### Martha Brockenbrough Staff writer 
Despite University President Donald
Kennedy's rejection last week, the press
for a first-ever student speaker at this
year's Commencement continues for Jim
Pitofsky and Xavier Briggs, the two
seniors who came up with the proposal.
Last Thursday, in a meeting with the
ASSU Council of Presidents, Kennedy
put the idea on hold. In an official reply,
he committed the University to studying
the plan for next year.
But Kennedy's decision has not dis
suaded the two seniors from seeking a
student speaker at the June 18 cere

mony.
"Rather than rolling over and letting
the idea die," said Pitofsky, "we will
write a letter (to Kennedy) and do the
best we can to respond to his concerns."
However, Pitofsky said he would
prefer "to come to the table" with Ken
nedy, instead of sending letters back
and forth.
Marlene Wine, special assistant to the
president, said she has requested the
two seniors to submit a written response
to Kennedy's objections.
Pitofsky said he will deliver this re
sponse to Kennedy's office by Friday.
And Kennedy, in turn, has promised to
meet with Pitofsky sometime next week.

If Kennedy refuses to reverse his po-"
sition, Pitofsky and Briggs are thinking
about a separate event — "Senior
Voices" — dunng the class celebration
held before graduation. Two or three
elected speakers, along with the class
presidents, would address the graduates
and their parents. Pitofsky and Briggs
said they want "Senior Voices" to be a
"stepping stone" towards including stu
dent speakers at a future commence
ment.
When Kennedy met with the COP
last week, he cited four reasons to jus
