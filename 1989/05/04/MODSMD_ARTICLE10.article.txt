# Quest for senior speaker stays alive
## 
### Martha Brockenbrough Staff writer 
Despite University President Donald
Kennedy's rejection last week, the press
for a first-ever student speaker at this
year's Commencement continues for Jim
Pitofsky and Xavier Briggs, the two
seniors who came up with the proposal.
Last Thursday, in a meeting with the
ASSU Council of Presidents, Kennedy
put the idea on hold. In an official reply,
he committed the University to studying
the plan for next year.
But Kennedy's decision has not dis
suaded the two seniors from seeking a
student speaker at the June 18 cere

mony.
"Rather than rolling over and letting
the idea die," said Pitofsky, "we will
write a letter (to Kennedy) and do the
best we can to respond to his concerns."
However, Pitofsky said he would
prefer "to come to the table" with Ken
nedy, instead of sending letters back
and forth.
Marlene Wine, special assistant to the
president, said she has requested the
two seniors to submit a written response
to Kennedy's objections.
Pitofsky said he will deliver this re
sponse to Kennedy's office by Friday.
And Kennedy, in turn, has promised to
meet with Pitofsky sometime next week.

If Kennedy refuses to reverse his po-"
sition, Pitofsky and Briggs are thinking
about a separate event — "Senior
Voices" — dunng the class celebration
held before graduation. Two or three
elected speakers, along with the class
presidents, would address the graduates
and their parents. Pitofsky and Briggs
said they want "Senior Voices" to be a
"stepping stone" towards including stu
dent speakers at a future commence
ment.
When Kennedy met with the COP
last week, he cited four reasons to jus
tify his refusal:
• Graduate students, who
receive the majority of diplomas,
would not be represented;
• • Determining the members of
the selection committee, and the
selection process itself would take
longer than the time available;
• Since the programs had al
ready been sent to the printers,
the speaker could not be men
tioned, and;
• Because of the late date, the
Commencement Panel, the organ
ization responsible for planning
the graduation ceremony, would
not have an opportunity to review
the proposal.
It is "a matter of principle"
having a speaker represent the
class at graduation, Briggs said
in response to Kennedy's first
concern. "Principle is more im
portant than getting the speaker's
name on the program."
Countering Kennedy's concerns
regarding the selection process,
Briggs and Pitofsky proposed that
nominated individuals be elected
by ballot. The seniors could vote

for a speaker when they picked
up their graduation gowns at the
Bookstore.
"We would welcome faculty in
put," Briggs said, "but they would
be non-voting, because (giving
them a vote) would undermine
the idea of student representa
tion."
Briggs and Pitofsky said they
oppose including academic criteria
in the selection process. "Aca
demic achievement does not nec
essarily correlate with insight or
quality oratory," Briggs said.
Kennedy's concern that the
graduate voice may not be heard
is valid, Briggs said, "because
there is no organized graduate
student leadership" like the
Senior Class Presidents. However,
their initial letter to Kennedy pro
posed that both a graduate and
an undergraduate representative
be chosen, he ardded.
"We can't, in wanting to be care
ful, be slaves to a process," Briggs
said, regarding Kennedy's concern
that the proposal bypassed the
Commencement Panel. "That is
not a reason to deny" student
speakers at commencement, he
said.
