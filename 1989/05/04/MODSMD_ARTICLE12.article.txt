### Caitlin Liu Staff writer 
After a one-year absence, the
Stanford University AIDS Task
Force will reconvene next Mon
day to set new goals for the
coming year, according to Pat
Fabiano, the new director of
the health promotion program
at Cowell Student Health Cen
ter.
According to Dr. Paul Wal
ters, the Cowell director, the
task force originally formed
last year to put out guidelines
for the University in dealing
with the AIDS crisis. The
guidelines prevent discrimina
tion against AIDS victims and
those who have related dis
eases.
While the goal of last year's
committee was formulating
policy, the goals of this year's
task force have not yet been

set. Fabiano, Walters and task
force student member Daniel
Bao all said, however, that they
hope to have AIDS education
programs for the Stanford com
munity as one of the goals.
According to Fabiano, the
current committee is composed
of students and administrators
from Residential Education,
the Legal Office, graduate
schools, Counseling and Psy
chological Services and Cowell.
The meeting will be 8:30 a.m.
Monday at Cowell.
Fabiano also said that there
is a real need to address the
issue of AIDS on college cam
puses right now. New data
from the Center for Disease
Control in Atlanta show a
higher-than-expected infection
rate of HIV — the human im
munodeficiency virus, a precur
sor for AIDS — among college
students, she said.
