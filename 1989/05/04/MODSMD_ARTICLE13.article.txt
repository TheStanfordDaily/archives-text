## South Korean violence escalates President threatens martial law after students kill six policemen 
### 
SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — Presi
dent Roh Tae-woo threatened yesterday
to invoke emergency powers, which
could mean martial law, if students and
workers continue the kind of violent
protest in which six riot policemen were
killed.
He said his government was deter
mined to stop the wave of radical protest
that has battered South Korea in recent
weeks, but he did not outline specific
action in a televised speech to the na
tion.
If violence and illegal acts endanger
democracy and the future of the coun
try, I would be obliged to invoke emer
gency measures as empowered by the
constitution," he said.
South Korea's constitution permits
the president to rule by decree or impose
martial law in cases of emergency.
Radical students are trying to bring

down Roh's government and have
formed alliances with striking workers.
They are a powerful minority on cam
puses, but lack public support because
of their extremism and violent tactics.
Roh's warning responded to the kil
ling of six riot troopers early yesterday
at Dongui University in Pusan, a south
ern stronghold of the opposition.
People seldom are killed in South
Korean protests. Riot officers wear pro
tective helmets and shields, along with
fireproof fatigues, and normally are
armed only with tear gas and batons.
The six who died were set afire when
they broke into a room on the seventh
floor of the university library to free
five comrades held hostage. They were
the first policemen killed since a riot
officer died in June 1987.
Authorities said students seized the
hostages Tuesday after a violent dem

onatration against the firing of warning
shots by police on Monday when pro
testers menaced a police station.
Students hurled firebombs and set
fire to a barricade drenched with paint
thinner as the policemen were climbing
over it. Some officers wrapped in flames
jumped out of windows and others were
burned to death or asphyxiated, police
said.
Ten officers were in critical condition
and police said they expected more to
die. Officials said about 10 other
policemen and students suffered minor
injuries.
Jo Jong-suk, chief of the national
police, resigned after about 150 officers
in Pusan conducted a sit-down protest
and accused senior officers of mishan
dling the assault. His office said it was
the worst loss of police life in recent
years.
