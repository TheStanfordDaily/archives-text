# NATO leaders seek compromise

### 
BONN, West Germany (AP) — Chan
cellor Helmut Kohl had his first meeting
late yesterday with the new, tough
talking U.S. ambassador after the Neth
erlands and Canada pushed for compro
mise in a NATO dispute over defense
strategy.
Ambassador Vernon Walters repeat
edly has stated his support for a NATO
project that would more than triple the
range of nuclear missiles based in West
Germany, and his opposition to arms
talks with the Kremlin aimed at reduc
ing short-range missile stockpiles.
But embassy spokesman Bill Bach
said Walters, who started his job last
week, would make no public comment
on his talks with West German leaders
in alliance efforts to resolve the issue.
Government spokesman Reinhardt
Schwarzer said Kohl's office also would
not comment officially.
In Washington, President Bush yes
terday ruled out negotiations with Mos

cow on short-range nuclear missiles and
the White House portrayed Bush's dis
agreement with Kohl as a sign of
NATO's vitality.
Kohl stirred the long-simmering dis
pute over short-range nuclear forces —
which arms negotiators call SNF — into
a full-fledged controversy last week
when he called for negotiations aimed
at "the third zero," or ultimate elimi
nation of short-range missiles.
Talks are already in progress to cut
the superpower arsenals of long-range
missiles, and the December 1987 agree
ment on intermediate-range forces set
out the total removal of those weapons
to reach the first zero.
The Pentagon opposes negotiations on
short-range missiles, claiming the War
saw Pact has a predominance in con
ventional arms and that until a balance
is achieved the Western alliance needs
to retain a nuclear option.
But West German fears of becoming

a nuclear battleground intensified in
recent months because most of the
short-range missiles — the only nuclear
weapons not under negotiation — are
based in West Germany.
Of NATO's 88 Lance missile laun
chers deployed in Central Europe, 76
are in West Germany. The rockets have
a range of about 75 miles, so their use
would mean fighting a nuclear war on
West German territory.
The SNF flareup triggered a flurry
of diplomatic efforts to work out a com
promise that would satisfy all 16 mem
ber nations of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization.
A senior U.S. official, who briefed
reporters in Bonn on condition of
anonymity, expressed confidence the
SNF debate would be ironed out by the
end of the month when leaders of NATO
nations meet in Brussels for their an
nual summit.
