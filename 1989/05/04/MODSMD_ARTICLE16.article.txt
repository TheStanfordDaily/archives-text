# Education report: spending up, performance at a standstill

WASHINGTON (AP) — Spending on
education is up but progress is at a
standstill, Education Secretary Lauro
Cavazos said yesterday in releasing a
report card that rates the nation's stu
dents as "merely average."
"The good news is that the schools are
not worse; the bad news is that we are
not making progress," Cavazos said as
he stood before his department's sixth
annual State Education Performance
Chart.
"We are standing still, and the problem
is that it's been this way for three years
in a row. Frankly, the situation scares
me," he said.
The figures show a decline this year
in the national high school graduation
rate and falling scofes on college entrance
exams in half the states.
In reaction, the Council of Chief State

School Officers, while acknowledging that
"the task ahead is gigantic," noted that
44 of the 50 states have made college
entrance test gains since 1982 and 38
states have improved their high school
completion rates since then.
But Cavazos called the longer-term
gains minimal. He said "scores on college
entrance exams are still substantially
lower than they were in the 19605" while
the graduation rate has gone up less than
two points.
"As a nation our educational perform
ance is merely average," Cavazos said.
"People are still willing, apparently, to
accept that we're not doing well and can't
compete."
If educational progress has stagnated,
the Education Department's chart shows
the same cannot be said of per-pupil
spending. The national average was

$3,977 per student in 1987, up from
$3,165 in 1982, calculated in constant
dollars — a 26 percent hike.
"We are already spending more money
per student than our m*yor foreign com
petitors, Japan and Germany. And yet
our students consistently fall behind the
competition in competitive testing,"
Cavazos said. "Money alone is not the
answer to our education deficit."
Cavazos said he would write to state
school chiefs, governors and school board
presidents and urge them to adopt spe
cific goals such as boosting high school
graduation rates to 90 percent and cut
ting in half the number of children who
fail a grade. He said states and districts
should issue annual reports on their prog
ress toward such goals.
Specifically, the department's chart
shows that national scores on the Scholas

tic Aptitude Test (SAT) fell from an
average of 906 to 904 (on a scale of 400
to 1,600) from 1987 to 1988. Fourteen
of the 22 states in which the SAT is the
dominant college entrance exam regis
tered declines.
Scores on the American College Testing
Program (ACT), marked on a scale of 1
to 36, showed a scant 0.1-point gain. And
11 of the 28 states in which the ACT
dominates posted decreases.
The high school graduation rate rose
from 69.5 percent in 1982 to 71.7 percent
in 1985. But it edged down in 1986 to
71.6 percent and dropped to 71.1 percent
in 1987, the latest year for which such
statistics could be calculated.
Department officials noted several en
couraging trends: Minority students are
continuing to lift their test scores, close
a high school "graduation gap" and in

increasing numbers take the Advanced
Placement test that qualifies students for
college credit.
In addition, states with relatively high
poverty rates such as Alabama, Missis
sippi and South Carolina have registered
some of the largest increases in college
entrance test scores since 1982, though
they still rank at the bottom of the heap.
Cavazos' generally dismal assessment
comes amid a spate of reform efforts in
the past few years. Asked if the reform
movement has failed, he replied that
"some of it has lost its momentum" or
failed to achieve its goals.
He said fundamental restructuring —
which he defined as parental freedom to
choose public schools, provision of alter
nate ways to become a teacher and more
parental involvement in education — has
yet to occur.
