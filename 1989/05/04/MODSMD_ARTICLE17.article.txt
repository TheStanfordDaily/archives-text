Space shuttle launch set for today
CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) - The
countdown marched smoothly yesterday toward
a second attempt to launch the shuttle Atlantis
with a crew of five and a space probe destined
for Venus. NASA's only worry was a worsening
weather forecast.
"All in all, things look good for a 1:48 p.m.
launch [today] and the start of our trip to Venus,"
launch test director Albert Sofge said of shuttle
preparations.
The weather outlook, however, was not the
greatest, with forecasters saying yesterday after
noon there was a 40 percent chance that either
rain or high winds would prevent a launch during
the available 64-minute launch period. That was
up from 30 percent in the morning and 20 percent
two dayB ago.
The first launch attempt last Friday was
aborted just 31 «econds before the planned liftoff
because of a short circuit in a fuel pump. NASA

said the delay cost about $300,000.
The mission to take the Magellan spacecraft
into orbit will revive a U.S. planetary program
that has been dormant since the launch of
Pioneer-Venus in 1978.
Pinochet scraps plans for reform
SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) — The right-wing mil
itary government said yesterday it was scrapping
plans for democratic reforms because the oppo
sition rejected a take-it-or-leave-it proposal.
Interior Minister Carlos Caceres blamed "in
transigent" opposition leaders in announcing an
end to further talks. He said the opposition
"closed out the possibility of a realistic agree
ment" on amendments to the 1980 constitution.
"Under the current circumstances, there is no
possibility whatsoever of talking again about con
stitutional changes," he told a news conference.
Among reform proposals abandoned was one
legalizing Marxism.
