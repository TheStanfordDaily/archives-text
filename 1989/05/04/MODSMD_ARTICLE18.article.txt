# China expecting 'historic march'
## Rally to mark the 70th anniversary of Chinese student activism

BEIJING (AP) â€” Police closed
off Beijing's central square early
yesterday as students prepared for
a "historic march" for democracy
in China on the 70th anniversary
of China's first student move
ment.
More than 40 universities
around Beijing were expected to
take part in the march to Tianan
men Square, student leader VVu'er
Kaixi said. The march would be
the sixth time in three weeks that
students have marched to the vast
expanse, the symbolic political
center of China.
The students are angry because
the government has refused to
recognize their independent un
ions.
By 7:30 a.m. today, the 100-acre
square had been cleared of all

pedestrians. Police were stationed
about 15 feet apart around the
perimeter to keep people off.
Several hundred police also
gathered at an intersection just
south of Beijing Normal Univer
sity, a center for the pro
democracy student activism that
has rocked the Chinese govern
ment since it began on April 15.
"Students, let us march to
gether with our heads held high,"
Wu'er said yesterday to a crowd
of his classmates at the school.
"Tomorrow we will create his
tory."
Beijing's Public Security
Bureau had announced it would
close the square, but students said
they would go anyway.
"They tried to close it on April
22nd and look what happened

then," said Wu'er, referring to the
day when more than 150,000 stu
dents and their suporters occupied
the square in defiance of a police
order. "Our protest will show that
Chinese democracy has arrived at
a new stage. It will be a historic
march."
Late last night, campuses
around Beijing were alive with the
sounds of speeches and chants as
students prepared for the march.
More than 500 students
crammed in an auditorium at
Beijing University and applauded
wildly as student leader Yang Tao
said the protest could be larger
than on April 28 when 150,000
students and supporters and tens
of thousands of onlookers filled
Beijing streets.
