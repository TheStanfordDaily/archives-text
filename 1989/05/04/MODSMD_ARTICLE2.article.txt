# MEChA demands dean
## 
### Jennifer Schmid 
Giving voice to its frustrations,
MEChA officially renewed its
demand for a full-time ethnic
dean for Chicano/Latino affairs
yesterday.
In a noontime press conference
at El Centro Chicano, 10 members
of MEChA (a Chicano/Latino stu
dent organization) and about 10
members of other student groups
— including the Black Student
Union, the Asian-American Stu
dent Association, the Stanford
American Indian Organization
and Barrio Assistance — called
for a full-time Chicano dean.
Cheered on by the students as
she read from a statement,
MEChA member Anna Mata said
her group has worked for the
hiring of a full-time dean since
1987.
"We will change any University
that holds back the democratic
process and the chance to improve
the quality of life for Chicano stu
dents," Mata declared during her
reading.
Back in the fall of 1987, the
Rainbow Agenda included the call
for a full-time MEChA dean
among its demands to the Uni
versity.

Since then, the ASSU has
passed a resolution for the es
tablishment of full-time deans at
all the ethnic centers, according
to Miguel Marquez, a member of
both the ASSU Council of Presi
dent and MEChA.
The University Committee on
Minority Issues report, released
this March, has also recommended
the hiring of full-time deans in
all the University's ethnic centers.
Juan Yniguez is presently a
part-time dean for MEChA. The
BSU has a full-time dean and
AASA is in the process of hiring
a new full-time dean. SAIO, like
MEChA, has a part-time dean.
Mata added that MEChA has
acquired more than 100 student
signatures to support their
demand and has gained the back
ing of Chicano faculty, staff,
alumni and the United Stanford
Workers.
MEChA members said they
have met several times with the
University's Budget and Admin
istration committee, but have yet
to see the committee take action
on their request.
No one from the committee
could be reached for comment last
night.
MEChA Co-Chair Gina Her

nandez said that because Stan
ford's Chicano community has
grown so much in the past few
years a full-time administrator
who coordinates its many activi
ties is a necessity.
Accordig to MEChA members,
the full-time dean could act as:
• a liaison between the different
Chicano student groups and the
administration;
• an advocate for the Chicano
community;
• a unifier who could work with
the other ethnic deans to organize
multicultural events; and,
• an assistant coordinator of
Barrio Assistance, a tutorial pro
gram that brings elementary
school-age children from East Palo
to campus.
Hernandez questioned whether
"it is humanly possible for a half
time dean to adequately fulfill
these needs."
She said that members of
MEChA had spoken last quarter
with Assoc. Dean of Student Af
fairs Michael Jackson, who over
sees ethnic deans, in order to dis
cuss the needs of Chicano stu
dents at Stanford.
She said Jackson told the group
