# Out in the open

There they are, big as
life, back out in the sun
shine where they belong —
for the first time since Aug. 20,
1987.
The four patinated bronze fig
ures that make up George Segal's
"Gay Liberation" sculpture were
replaced yesterday as promised
(and about time, too).
The Stanford Police Depart
ment should be extra-vigilant in
the next few weeks to safeguard
against vandalism attacks like
the ones in 1985 and '87, which
twice led to the sculpture's
removal.

Art lovers and those who have
never seen the sculpture in
Lomita Mall should check it out.
Despite all the controversy sur
rounding the sculpture, the four
white figures look peaceful, sit
ting and standing there in
nocuously.
And that's one message of the
sculpture: Gay liberation means
the freedom to do ordinary little
things heterosexual people take
for granted, like putting a hand
on a girlfriend's knee or an arm
around a boyfriend's shoulder —
and the freedom to do so out in
the open, without shame or fear.
