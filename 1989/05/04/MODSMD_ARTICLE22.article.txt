Denial of genocide
is insupportable
The May 1 letter to The Daily at
tacking the Armenian genocide is accu
rate in one sense only; it is a faithful
representation of the posturing of the
Turkish government.
It opens brazenly with an unsup
ported claim of innocence. Next, it
attempts to justify the genocide and
euphemizes the murderous act as
"relocation." Then it quickly follows
with a nervous qualification to offi
cially distance the current Turkish
government from the allegedly innocent
acts of its Ottoman precursor.
Revealingly, the letter gives highest
priority to this final point and to pe
ripheral protestations that have no
bearing on the fact of the genocide.
"The most outrageous trickery," it
claims, "is to present the Republic of
Turkey as the responsible party for the
events that took place."
This line of argument clearly con
cerns itself more with public relations
than with facts. The letter labels our
remembrance "a plot which ultimately
aims at threatening the territorial in
tegrity of Turkey, a country of great
geopolitical importance." We hope the
Stanford community will recognize the
global human importance of not per
mitting an act of genocide to be
denied.
A forgotten crime carries the
frightening possibility of re-enactment.
We do not question Turkey's geopoliti
cal importance as a U.S. ally; in fact,
that reality is a major reason Turkey
has been permitted to perpetuate its
lies.
We must answer these lies with
facts. The basic Turkish claim that the
genocide did not take place cannot
stand up against the 13,000 document*
in U.S. archives that bear witness, and
thousands of similar documents in
other national archives, including those

of Germany, a Turkish ally during
World War I.
A Turkish tribunal headed by the
founder of modern Turkey, Kemal At
taturk, met in 1919, and condemned
those leaders who had ordered the
policy of genocide. The New York
Times ran 194 articles from 1915 to
1923 that brought daily reports of the
annihilation.
Recent international recognition af
firms the strength of the Armenian
case. The Permanent People's Tribunal
at the Hague, including three Nobel
laureates, passed a resolution on April
16, 1984, stating that "the extermina
tion of the Armenian population con
stituted a crime of genocide."
The European Parliament, on June
18, 1987, placed as a stipulation for
Turkey's entering the European Com
mon' Market the recognition of "the
historically proven Armenian genocide."
In November of the same year, the
Holocaust Council affirmed that "the
genocide of the Armenian citizens of
the Ottoman Empire between 1915 and
1923 ... should be included in any
discussion of genocide in the 20th cen
tury."
The denial of the Armenian genocide
in the face of irrefutable and over
whelming fact is bewildering and pain
ful. The persistent assaults on the
truth are frustrating to those who live
with the memory of murdered ances
tors and frightening to those who ob
serve the yet-unbroken chain of
genocide in our century.
The question, "Who's next?" has
already elicited far too many sickening
responses: the Jewish Holocaust,
Stalin's reign of terror, the Cambodian
genocide. Let our next response be the
correct one: an awareness of history
that will guarantee that we never have
to ask this ominous question again.

The Axe Committee
deserved second try
Many students benefit from the ef
forts of the Axe Committee, which
organizes functions such as the Big
Game Bonfire and the Big Game all
campus party. It was surprising to
many that the Axe Committee fee as
sessment failed. Axe Committee officers
spoke with many students who said
they had voted against the fee request
without fully realizing what the Axe
Committee does.
Axe Committee members went out
and collected 2,000 signatures within
48 hours. This was certainly no easy
task. In working so hard to place the
fee request back on the ballot, the Axe
Committee has shown that they are
really committed to doing what it
takes to support school spirit at Stan
ford. We applaud this initiative and
determination and salute the commit
tee for its efforts.
Obviously, it would have been better
if the committee had done the neces
sary publicity prior to the first general
election. In the future we expect that
they will. But we feel that if students
voted against the Axe Committee with
out fully understanding its functions,
students should have a second chance.
Therefore, the ASSU Senate placed the
fee request on the ballot for the runoff
elections, held yesterday and today.
If the students reject the fee request
a second time, it will send a clear mes
sage that Stanford students don't want
money spent on programs like the Bon
fire and Big Game party. If it passes,
the Axe Committee will have learned a
valuable lesson: that they need to be
more visible and accountable to the
student body. And we will still have
our Bonfire. Either way, it is the stu
dents who will decide.
As to The Daily's assertion, "If at
first you don't succeed, try and try

again — the ASSU Senate will let
you," we plead guilty. After all, isn't
that what we're here for?

ASSU Council of Presidents
Hoover, ASSU both
skewed surveys
How ironic to read that the Council
of Presidents is accusing Senior Hoover
Fellow John Bunzel of surveying stu
dents on racism with "loaded ques
tions." I refused to participate in a
survey conducted last quarter by the
ASSU's Committee on Democracy in
Education for the same reason. •
As I recall, the ASSU asked ques
tions like "Will the impending 8 per
cent tuition hike affect your ability to
pay tuition?" and "Has the cutback in
TAs affected the quality of your educa
tion?" Few would say no.
Speaking about Bunzel's racism sur
vey in The Daily, COP member Stacey
Leyton said "It seemed like the ques
tions were worded in ways that would
get his expected answers." The same is
true of the ASSU's survey; ask obvious
questions and you'll get obvious
answers.
Bunzel's survey is more subtle, but
equally leading. One question asks how
I would characterize relationships be
tween blacks and whites at Ujamaa
House. Unfortunately, to the vast
majority who don't live in Ujamaa, the
attention given past incidents rather
than harmonious interactions is.sure to
obscure the response.
Regardless of their individual motiva
tions for asking, I didn't like the con
struction of the questions put to me
by Bunzel or the ASSU. I'm participat
ing in neither survey.

campus party. It was surprising to
many that the Axe Committee fee as
sessment failed. Axe Committee officers
spoke with many students who said
they had voted against the fee request
without fully realizing what the Axe
Committee does.
Axe Committee members went out
and collected 2,000 signatures within
48 hours. This was certainly no easy
task. In working so hard to place the
fee request back on the ballot, the Axe
Committee has shown that they are
really committed to doing what it
takes to support school spirit at Stan
ford. We applaud this initiative and
determination and salute the commit
tee for its efforts.
Obviously, it would have been better
if the committee had done the neces
sary publicity prior to the first general
election. In the future we expect that
they will. But we feel that if students
voted against the Axe Committee with
out fully understanding its functions,
students should have a second chance.
Therefore, the ASSU Senate placed the
fee request on the ballot for the runoff
elections, held yesterday and today.
If the students reject the fee request
a second time, it will send a clear mes
sage that Stanford students don't want
money spent on programs like the Bon
fire and Big Game party. If it passes,
the Axe Committee will have learned a
valuable lesson: that they need to be
more visible and accountable to the
student body. And we will still have
our Bonfire. Either way, it is the stu
dents who will decide.
As to The Daily's assertion, "If at
first you don't succeed, try and try

again — the ASSU Senate will let
you," we plead guilty. After all, isn't
that what we're here for?

ASSU Council of Presidents
Hoover, ASSU both
skewed surveys
How ironic to read that the Council
of Presidents is accusing Senior Hoover
Fellow John Bunzel of surveying stu
dents on racism with "loaded ques
tions." I refused to participate in a
survey conducted last quarter by the
ASSU's Committee on Democracy in
Education for the same reason. •
As I recall, the ASSU asked ques
tions like "Will the impending 8 per
cent tuition hike affect your ability to
pay tuition?" and "Has the cutback in
TAs affected the quality of your educa
tion?" Few would say no.
Speaking about Bunzel's racism sur
vey in The Daily, COP member Stacey
Leyton said "It seemed like the ques
tions were worded in ways that would
get his expected answers." The same is
true of the ASSU's survey; ask obvious
questions and you'll get obvious
answers.
Bunzel's survey is more subtle, but
equally leading. One question asks how
I would characterize relationships be
tween blacks and whites at Ujamaa
House. Unfortunately, to the vast
majority who don't live in Ujamaa, the
attention given past incidents rather
than harmonious interactions is.sure to
obscure the response.
Regardless of their individual motiva
tions for asking, I didn't like the con
struction of the questions put to me
by Bunzel or the ASSU. I'm participat
ing in neither survey.

Denial of genocide
is insupportable
The May 1 letter to The Daily at
tacking the Armenian genocide is accu
rate in one sense only; it is a faithful
representation of the posturing of the
Turkish government.
It opens brazenly with an unsup
ported claim of innocence. Next, it
attempts to justify the genocide and
euphemizes the murderous act as
"relocation." Then it quickly follows
with a nervous qualification to offi
cially distance the current Turkish
government from the allegedly innocent
acts of its Ottoman precursor.
Revealingly, the letter gives highest
priority to this final point and to pe
ripheral protestations that have no
bearing on the fact of the genocide.
"The most outrageous trickery," it
claims, "is to present the Republic of
Turkey as the responsible party for the
events that took place."
This line of argument clearly con
cerns itself more with public relations
than with facts. The letter labels our
remembrance "a plot which ultimately
aims at threatening the territorial in
tegrity of Turkey, a country of great
geopolitical importance." We hope the
Stanford community will recognize the
global human importance of not per
mitting an act of genocide to be
denied.
A forgotten crime carries the
frightening possibility of re-enactment.
We do not question Turkey's geopoliti
cal importance as a U.S. ally; in fact,
that reality is a major reason Turkey
has been permitted to perpetuate its
lies.
We must answer these lies with
facts. The basic Turkish claim that the
genocide did not take place cannot
stand up against the 13,000 document*
in U.S. archives that bear witness, and
thousands of similar documents in
other national archives, including those

of Germany, a Turkish ally during
World War I.
A Turkish tribunal headed by the
founder of modern Turkey, Kemal At
taturk, met in 1919, and condemned
those leaders who had ordered the
policy of genocide. The New York
Times ran 194 articles from 1915 to
1923 that brought daily reports of the
annihilation.
Recent international recognition af
firms the strength of the Armenian
case. The Permanent People's Tribunal
at the Hague, including three Nobel
laureates, passed a resolution on April
16, 1984, stating that "the extermina
tion of the Armenian population con
stituted a crime of genocide."
The European Parliament, on June
18, 1987, placed as a stipulation for
Turkey's entering the European Com
mon' Market the recognition of "the
historically proven Armenian genocide."
In November of the same year, the
Holocaust Council affirmed that "the
genocide of the Armenian citizens of
the Ottoman Empire between 1915 and
1923 ... should be included in any
discussion of genocide in the 20th cen
tury."
The denial of the Armenian genocide
in the face of irrefutable and over
whelming fact is bewildering and pain
ful. The persistent assaults on the
truth are frustrating to those who live
with the memory of murdered ances
tors and frightening to those who ob
serve the yet-unbroken chain of
genocide in our century.
The question, "Who's next?" has
already elicited far too many sickening
responses: the Jewish Holocaust,
Stalin's reign of terror, the Cambodian
genocide. Let our next response be the
correct one: an awareness of history
that will guarantee that we never have
to ask this ominous question again.
