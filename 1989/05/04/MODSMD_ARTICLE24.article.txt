## Pedagogical peccadillos 
### 
ABSURD AS IT SOUNDS, the ac
ademic calendar at this school is
the active enemy of true education.
The single most important and easiest
thing Stanford could do to improve its
humanities programs would be to abolish
the quarter system.
Forget the hassle of three exam periods
each year. Forget that midterms crunch
lasts from week three until the start of
finals. Forget that professors feel so
pressed for time that Dead Week is a
dead concept. Those petty tyrannies of
the quarter system are just incon
veniences. I'm talking pedagogical neces
sities.
The inevitable result of the quarter
system in humanities classes is the
truncation of ideas. Nine or 10 weeks
simply does not provide enough time for
students to think. Instead of allowing
time for introspection and analysis,
classes rush through the objective criteria
of course completion: midterm, essay,
final.
Unfortunately, education takes time.
One cannot understand a great book by
effort of will alone; one needs time to
get to know the author, to do research,
to make a few false starts at analysis
and evaluation, to talk with classmates
and professors.
It's not just that we could cover more
if we switched to a semester system; it's
that we could cover it better. We would
give our ideas the critical time to perc
olate that they currently lack. In doing
so we would take a huge step towards
enabling serious study of the humanities.
The "educational philosophy" behind

the quarter system seems to be that we
can take more classes under it. Yes, that's
true, but contrary to apparent adminis
tration belief, a lot of classes does not
equal an education. We'd be better off
with two-thirds as many classes if we
could tackle them in something more like
the depth that they deserve.

Speaking of a lot of classes not equaling
an education, Stanford has got to do
something about its currently ineffective
and mind-dulling system of distribution
requirements. Something like abolish it,
get serious, and start over.
The current system just does not make
sense. The criteria for area and class
selection seem arbitrary at best, appar
ently obeying some mystical formula for
even-handedness between departments
and programs in lieu of any internal logic.
Questions about the worth of the re
quirements abound. If we're serious
about Area One, why do we need separate
requirements in Literature and Philoso
phy? Should we really have to take a
course in Human Development, Behavior
and Language as a graduation require
ment?
Then there are questions about how
"satisfactory" courses get chosen. Does
taking Japanese Economy pass/no credit
really fulfill the spirit of t he Non-Western
Culture requirement? What kind of deal
did the Slavic Department cut to make
Russian 1, 2, 3 the only language class
to satisfy the Human Development, Be
havior and Language requirement?
It sounds like a scam, and it is.

President Kennedy gets applause in this
corner for nixing the proposal for a stu
dent speaker at our graduation. It's had
enough that we feel so insecure that we
have to draw big-name graduation
speakers with a tenuous connection to
higher education; let's not make it worse
by sponsoring the fantasy that one of
our peers could sum up our Four Years
in any meaningful way.
This is not high school. As a class, we
simply don't have big, unifying experi
ences at any non-trivial level. Certain
things — fro yo at the Co Po, late night
dorm discussions, Western Culture — do
unite us, but they are largely accidents
of location and circumstance.
It's not the fact that we had dorm
discussions that's important, it's what
we talked about when we had them. No
speaker can universalize those par
ticulars. Any effort to do so is bound to
dissolve into maudlin generalities.
Starting on June 18, for good or ill,
our Stanford Experiences are destined to
be private memories, cherished and
shared in the company of close friends
and scrapbooks. Let's not sentimentalize
them into insignificance by trying to
reduce them to the nostalgic equivalent
of a sound-bite.
