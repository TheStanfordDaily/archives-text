Stanford freshman Christian
Cevaer entered the third and
final day of the Pacific 10 Con
ference Golf Championships yes
terday with a two stroke lead
over Oregon's Chris Holzang.
Holzang shot a four-under-par
66 final round, his second 66 of
the tournament. Certainly, that
should have been enough to win
the tournament.

Cardinal 3rd at Pac-10s
But Cevaer, winner of the
Junior World Amateur Champi
onships in 1987, wouldn't let
this one get away. Instead, he
demolished the par-70 Broad
moor course with a 65, capturing
the championship by three
strokes and making him the
seventh Cardinal golfer to win
the tournament, and the first
since Don Walsworth did in
1986.
"I accomplished my goal this
year, which was to win a tour
nament," Cevaer said.
"I didn't do it at the Stanford
tournament, and at BYU I
played well but never really had

a chance to win. But today I had
a really good round and was able
to win it."
As a team, the Big Swing
turned into a big rout as the
Stanford men's golf team
finished an impressive third
place in the tournament and, in
the process, dusted off California
by 17 strokes. The Cardinal
thereby puts itself in the driver's
seat for an NCAA regional tour
nament berth.
"We finished great, and we
should qualify now to go to the
regionals," Cevaer said. "After
BYU, our chances were mar
ginal."
A great finish indeed: After a
bad round Tuesday dropped
them from contention, Stanford
shot a final round 351, the best
of the tournament, and leap
frogged three teams to finish a
solid third.
"We now have a winning
record against UCLA this year,
the first time that's happened
in three years," sophomore Don
Christensen said.
"They're defending national
champions."

Team All Pac-10 for his perform

the first day, but came from be

hind with a 68 and the 65 to
finish the tournament at 7-under
par 203. Cevaer had four previous
top 10 finishes, but this is his
first tournament win of the year.
"I have to be in the right frame
of mind," Cevaer said. "I have to
just forget about what I have to
shoot and just play the golf course.
Today I was able to keep every
thing in perspective and have a
good round."
Christensen finished tied for
25th with a 221. He had his worst
round of the tournament on Wed
nesday, but his teammates were
able to pick him up. "I was dis
appointed with the way I played,
but when coach told me how well
everyone played, I was happy," he
said.
Stanford (1090) was third only
to Arizona State (1074) and Ari
zona (1078). The Trojans tied for
fourth with Oregon at 1096, and
UCLA was sixth at 1099.
"Everyone expected ASU to win
it and Arizona to finish second,"
senior Brad Geer said. "Then USC
and UCLA were supposed to bat
tle for third, and we and Oregon
were supposed to go for fifth. We
jumped a couple places above
what people expected."
Besides Cevaer and Christen
sen, Stanford needed solid
performances by juniors Mark
Funseth and Brad Benbrook. Fun
seth, coming off a great outing in
the BYU tournament, shot an
even-par 70 on the final day to
finish at 222 (tied for 28th).
