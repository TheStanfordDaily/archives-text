# Netters bring Soaring Gulls back to earth

### Mark Rogowsky Editorial staff 
If a typical Stanford crowd at
tended yesterday's women's ten
nis match, they probably would've
gone into the typical Stanford
refrain of "Bor-ing! Bor-ing!"
The Cardinal women actually
played very well. Unfortunately,
the Soaring Gulls of U.S. Inter
national University were incapa
ble of putting up much of a chal
lenge.

So even with a lineup that
didn't include Pacific 10 Confer
ence champion Sandra Birch and
undefeated superfrosh Debbie
Graham, Stanford upped its
record to 24-0 and recorded its
13th shutout of the season.
The only singles match that was
even moderately in doubt was at
No. 1. Tami Whitlinger, the na
tion's top-ranked player, ended up
scoring a 6-2, 6-4 victory over
USIU's Carol Curmi — it just
took a while.
By the time Whitlinger's match
ended, No. 2 and 3 doubles were
already through five games.
"Tami struggled a bit . . .she's
a little tired," Stanford Coach
Frank Brennan said.

The Gulls started
dropping like flies.

Tami Whitlinger's sister Teri
was the first Stanford player to
complete a match. She won 6-3,
6-1 over Diane Lowings.
Then the Gulls starting drop
ping like flies. Lisa Green quickly
closed out Sari Shaley 6-2, 6-2.
Kylie Johnson dusted Joann
Tshako 6-2, 6-2. Cindy
Buchsbaum vanquished Andrea
Ritecz 6-3, 6-3. And Valerie Wil
son thumped Rene Koahou 6-2,
6-0.
In doubles, Green and Johnson
beat Tshako and Robin Nakamure
6-3, 6-1. Buchsbaum and Carina
Rolley beat Shaley and Koahou
6-3, 5-7, 7-5 — the only match
Stanford didn't win in straight
sets. The No. 1 doubles was can
celed.
Card notes
Johnson was sporting a knee brace
today for the first time. She tore some
cartilage in her match against USC's
Caroline Kuhlman. Johnson said she
felt fine but was a little afraid to run.
Friday, Stanford takes on fifth
ranked California. Tami Whitlinger
will have a chance to avenge her only
dual-match defeat of the season in
her anticipated showdown with Karen
Shin.
