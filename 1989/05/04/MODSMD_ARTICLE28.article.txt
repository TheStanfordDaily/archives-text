# Scanning the box scores: the science of Rotisserie baseball
## 
### 
After just 25 games of having a small
stake in my first rotisserie league
baseball team, several axioms of
player selection have hit me square in
the face:
Stay away from mediocre players com
ing off career years. My friends and I
made the mistake of choosing the Chicago
Cubs' Vance "Common" Law (Chris Ber
man nickname). Law finished in the top
10 in National League batting last season,
missing the .300 mark by a couple points.
Law is not a career .300 hitter. April of
v 1989 has proven that, as Law is floun
' dering under .200. Of course, Law isn't
'r that bad, but even at .300 his run
i production is not phenomenal. At .250,
112 he makes any rotisserie aficionado wince.
Go for proven players coming off sub
* par years. We nabbed Tommy Herr of
" the Philadelphia Phillies. Granted, in the
rotisserie world — where run-production
is valued above all else — Herr is not a
" gem. But among second basemen, he has
a a shot at finishing in the top five this
■I' year.

Last season in Minnesota he struggled
as a part-time player in a new city and
a new league. Prior to that, he was a
consistent offensive threat for the St.
Louis Cardinals, playing every day at
second base for three World Series teams.
In Herr's best season, he knocked in 100
runs despite hitting less than 10 homers.
Everything was in Herr's favor enter
ing the current campaign. He was return
ing to the National League where he
knows the pitchers and has had success

throughout his career.
The Phillies handed him an everyday
job at second base, shifting all-hit, no
field Juan Samuel to the outfield. And
through Tuesday, Herr was hitting a tor
rid .340, good for fourth in the N.L.
To strengthen the case a little more,
I'll draw blood from an open Giant
wound. When San Francisco unloaded
Jeffrey Leonard to the Milwaukee
Brewers last season, it looked like a decent
move. His numbers were way down and
he was fighting nagging injuries that
plague players who are past their peak.
But everyone seemed to forget the Hac-
Man was just one year removed from his
best- season and a memorable perform
ance in the 1987 National League
playoffs. Further, it's especially difficult
to switch leagues in mid-season — as
Leonard did — and be immediately suc
cessful. He barely had time to adjust and
his disappointing year was over.
This season, Hac-Man had his health
and a half-season of A.L. experience when
he arrived for spring training with his

new team, the Seattle Mariners. Tuesday
night Leonard hit his second grand slam
of the year to propel Seattle to a 7-2 win
over the Tigers.
Before last night's games, Leonard led
the A.L. in RBI with 24 and was tied
for the league lead in homers with
eight. Bet the Giants wish Hac-Man's act
was still at Candlestick.
Find a rookie that's not in the main
stream. Everyone had heard of Mark
McGwire as he embarked on his maiden
voyage, just as everybody knew 19-year
old Ken Griffey Jr. before the 1989 season
began. My one worthwhile contribution
to our team has been the California An
gels' Dante Bichette.
Who? Dante Bichette, a rookie out
fielder who's been good enough to keep
high-priced acquisition Claudell Washing
ton from playing every day in right field.
Just to ground things a bit for Bay Area
fans, Bichette's stance and swing bring
to mind a right-handed Will Clark.
Weight back, front leg stiff, bat waving
behind the head. And, like Clark, Bichette

hits for power — he ha 3 two homers in
a platoon role thus far in '89.
As you may have guessed, the idea of
these axioms is to improve rotisserie
choices in the later rounds of the draft.
Not everyone can have Ryne Sandberg,
Glenn Davis, Kevin Mitchell, Will Clark
and the like at their respective positions.
That's why it's so cruciaJ to find as many
"steals" in the draft as possible.
Nevertheless, even the most proven of
stars can turn out to be flops. Minneso
ta's Frank "Sweet Music" Viola was our
first pitcher chosen, but the Cy Young
award winner has struggled this season
as contract troubles stretched past
opening day — he is winless in '89.
St. Louis' fire-balling right-hander
Todd Worrell is our relief pitcher, but
even he has encountered early problems.
In St. Louis' last two save situations,
Worrell has (1) been passed over for left
hander Ken Dayley and (2) blown a Car
dinal lead. Those are valuable rotisserie
points down the tubes. What can you do?

Jeffrey Leonard to the Milwaukee
Brewers last season, it looked like a decent
move. His numbers were way down and
he was fighting nagging injuries that
plague players who are past their peak.
But everyone seemed to forget the Hac-
Man was just one year removed from his
best- season and a memorable perform
ance in the 1987 National League
playoffs. Further, it's especially difficult
to switch leagues in mid-season — as
Leonard did — and be immediately suc
cessful. He barely had time to adjust and
his disappointing year was over.
This season, Hac-Man had his health
and a half-season of A.L. experience when
he arrived for spring training with his

new team, the Seattle Mariners. Tuesday
night Leonard hit his second grand slam
of the year to propel Seattle to a 7-2 win
over the Tigers.
Before last night's games, Leonard led
the A.L. in RBI with 24 and was tied
for the league lead in homers with
eight. Bet the Giants wish Hac-Man's act
was still at Candlestick.
Find a rookie that's not in the main
stream. Everyone had heard of Mark
McGwire as he embarked on his maiden
voyage, just as everybody knew 19-year
old Ken Griffey Jr. before the 1989 season
began. My one worthwhile contribution
to our team has been the California An
gels' Dante Bichette.
Who? Dante Bichette, a rookie out
fielder who's been good enough to keep
high-priced acquisition Claudell Washing
ton from playing every day in right field.
Just to ground things a bit for Bay Area
fans, Bichette's stance and swing bring
to mind a right-handed Will Clark.
Weight back, front leg stiff, bat waving
behind the head. And, like Clark, Bichette

hits for power — he ha 3 two homers in
a platoon role thus far in '89.
As you may have guessed, the idea of
these axioms is to improve rotisserie
choices in the later rounds of the draft.
Not everyone can have Ryne Sandberg,
Glenn Davis, Kevin Mitchell, Will Clark
and the like at their respective positions.
That's why it's so cruciaJ to find as many
"steals" in the draft as possible.
Nevertheless, even the most proven of
stars can turn out to be flops. Minneso
ta's Frank "Sweet Music" Viola was our
first pitcher chosen, but the Cy Young
award winner has struggled this season
as contract troubles stretched past
opening day — he is winless in '89.
St. Louis' fire-balling right-hander
Todd Worrell is our relief pitcher, but
even he has encountered early problems.
In St. Louis' last two save situations,
Worrell has (1) been passed over for left
hander Ken Dayley and (2) blown a Car
dinal lead. Those are valuable rotisserie
points down the tubes. What can you do?

After just 25 games of having a small
stake in my first rotisserie league
baseball team, several axioms of
player selection have hit me square in
the face:
Stay away from mediocre players com
ing off career years. My friends and I
made the mistake of choosing the Chicago
Cubs' Vance "Common" Law (Chris Ber
man nickname). Law finished in the top
10 in National League batting last season,
missing the .300 mark by a couple points.
Law is not a career .300 hitter. April of
v 1989 has proven that, as Law is floun
' dering under .200. Of course, Law isn't
'r that bad, but even at .300 his run
i production is not phenomenal. At .250,
112 he makes any rotisserie aficionado wince.
Go for proven players coming off sub
* par years. We nabbed Tommy Herr of
" the Philadelphia Phillies. Granted, in the
rotisserie world — where run-production
is valued above all else — Herr is not a
" gem. But among second basemen, he has
a a shot at finishing in the top five this
■I' year.

Last season in Minnesota he struggled
as a part-time player in a new city and
a new league. Prior to that, he was a
consistent offensive threat for the St.
Louis Cardinals, playing every day at
second base for three World Series teams.
In Herr's best season, he knocked in 100
runs despite hitting less than 10 homers.
Everything was in Herr's favor enter
ing the current campaign. He was return
ing to the National League where he
knows the pitchers and has had success

throughout his career.
The Phillies handed him an everyday
job at second base, shifting all-hit, no
field Juan Samuel to the outfield. And
through Tuesday, Herr was hitting a tor
rid .340, good for fourth in the N.L.
To strengthen the case a little more,
I'll draw blood from an open Giant
wound. When San Francisco unloaded
Jeffrey Leonard to the Milwaukee
Brewers last season, it looked like a decent
move. His numbers were way down and
he was fighting nagging injuries that
plague players who are past their peak.
