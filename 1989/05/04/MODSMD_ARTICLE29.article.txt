# Club Sports Roundup
## Equestrians surprise nation 
### Lihby Feil Staff writer 
The Stanford equestrian
team capped off the season by
finishing an unexpected third
overall in the National Cham
pionships of the Affiliated Na
tional Riding Commission.
Despite having to travel to
North Carolina and race on un
familiar horses, the Cardinal
surprised the other teams with
its excellent riding in the show,
which was hosted by St.
Andrews College.
The Championships con
sisted of three separate phases.
Each school entered a team of
three riders for each phase.
Only the top two riders from
each college were counted in
that school's point totals.
The first two phases, the
dressage sportif and the cross
country ride, were competi
tions that the Stanford team
was unfamiliar with. In spite
of their lack of experience,
though, the team members did
well.
Each rider had to perform a
detailed program of moves with
his or her horse. Gwyn Gordon
placed sixth out of 35 riders,
while teammate Emma Hughes
placed 10th. As a team, the
upstart Stanford riders ended
up in third.
The cross-country ride in
volved jumping natural solid
fences located in hilly, varied
terrain. The course included
such additional, obstacles as
mud, water, steep hills and
ditches â€” "things you would
come across on a fox hunt,"
Gordon said.
Stanford did well again: Gor
don captured third and Hughes
took fourth, while the riders
placed second as a team.
The final phase, the stadium
competition, was held in the
ring. The riders all jumped
fences within the stadium. "We

were very comfortable with
that (format)," Gordon said,
since "this is basically what we
do" in most West Coast shows.
Stanford rider Lizzie Child
ress earned third place, fol
lowed by Gordon in sixth. The
Cardinal placed second as a
team.
After tallying the scores for
the entire weekend of competi
tions, Stanford emerged in
third place out of 10 teams.
Gordon placed fifth and
Hughes seventh in the individ
ual standings. The Cardinal's
unexpected success gave the
team a rousing finale for its
season.
Running Club places
in local races
Although there are no
strictly intercollegiate events in
which the Stanford Running
Club can race, the club mem
bers have not suffered from a
dearth of competition. Stanford
runners have entered an as
sortment of local fun runs re
cently, including the MBA
Challenge on April 22 and the
Nimitz Run last weekend, and
have beaten their competitors
soundly.
The Nimitz Run was held on
Treasure Island in San Fran
cisco Bay. The five Stanford
runners who participated faced
hilly terrain and an 800-person
field. In spite of these obsta
cles, Cardinal Dan Fernandez
"smoked his competitors" to
finish third overall and second
in his age group, according to
teammate Dante Rodriguez.
Rodriguez and fellow Stanford
runner J.D. Douglas finished
in the top 50.
Cyclists end season with
tough weekend at Davis
Stanford's cycling team
finished its last regular-season

weekend of racing with two
seconds and one third place at
UC-Davis. Unfortunately, arch
rival California and close compet
itor Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo
both beat Stanford, Cal in two
races and Cal Poly in one race.
Although the Cardinal placed
well in the women's and top men's
categories, its lack of depth in the
men's C and D divisions gave its
opponents enough of an advantage
to allow them to win.
The weekend's racing started
with an individual time trial Sat
urday morning on a 5.8-mile flat
loop on the Davis campus. The
course's even terrain meant fast
racing. Despite good Stanford
placings in the men's and wom
en's A and B divisions, the Car
dinal came in second behind Davis
because of its lack of C and D
riders.
In the men's B field, Stanford
rider Ken Zimmerman smoked the
field and took first place. Team
mates Hank Dart and Brian Ster
ling followed in seventh and ninth.
The men's A results showcased
Stanford as well: Art Walker, Rus
sell Meade, and Coulter Richard
son finished second, fourth and
fifth overall.
The women also had impressive
results. In the B field, Cardinal
Stephanie Page captured second
place. Her teammate Polly Siegal
came across the line just behind
in third. Women's A cyclists Tasha
Brubaker, Shannon Price and
Laura Wilson finished fourth,
11th and 14th in their field.
Next weekend Stanford travels
to the Western Collegiate Cycling
Confernce Championships, to be
held at UC-Santa Barbara.
Heading into WCCC Champion
ships Cal is at the top of the
league, with a perfect score for
the season. UC-San Diego still oc
cupies second place, but is sure
to fall out of contention for Na
tionals. Stanford is currently a
very close third.
