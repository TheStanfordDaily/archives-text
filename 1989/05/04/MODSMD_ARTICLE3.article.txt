# Physicist refutes validity of Stanford cold fusion results
## 
### Jock Friedly Editorial staff 
A Stanford physicist announced
Tuesday that the generation of
so-called cold fusion is a result of
erroneous measurements and ne
glected chemistry. These findings,
announced by Physics Prof. Wal
ter Meyerhof, cast doubt on a
Stanford team's crucial confirm
ation of the findings of Utah sci
entists.
Two weeks ago, a group led by
Materials Science Prof. Robert
Huggins announced they had per
formed a successful, controlled
cold fusion experiment, providing
some of the best support for
claims from University of Utah
and Brigham Young University

scientists that fu
sion can be
created in a labo
ratory beaker.
Scientists
hoped that cold
fusion in a jar,
previously
thought impossi
ble, could yield a
clean and inex-

haustible source of energy.
At a meeting of the American
Physical Society in Baltimore,
Meyerhof reported that the cold
fusion claims were based on in
correct calculations of the heat
created in the experiment. The
Utah scientists claimed they had
created excess heat after driving
electricity through "heavy water,"

a form of water in which hydrogen
is replaced by an isotope called
deuterium.
Meyerhof said incorrect calo
rimetry, the measurement of heat,
accounts for the claims of excess
heat. He said calculations he per
formed show that because the sci
entists did not stir their sample
of heavy water, their findings
could be in error.
"They should have seen these
effects," Meyerhof told The Daily
yesterday about the temperature
differences from insufficient mix
ture of the water. "They are easily
measurable."
The Huggins team disagreed
with Meyerhof's assessment.
"We're quite confident that what
we are reporting is correct," Hug

gins said.
Furthermore, Meyerhof said he
could explain why the control test
performed by Huggins' group
showed a difference between
heavy water and normal water.
The greater heat generated in the
heavy water experiment lent
credibility to the claim that cold
fusion, rather than an unac
counted for chemical reaction, was
occurring.
"There is no question that there
is a difference in the water and
the heavy water," Meyerhof said.
He argued, however, that the dif
ference could be easily explained
by chemistry, not nuclear physics.
Huggins added he is just begin
ning more experiments to refute
some of Meyerhofs objections.
