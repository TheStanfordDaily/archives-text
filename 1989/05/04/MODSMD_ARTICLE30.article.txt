# Stanford's chances depend on Fortune

Scott Fortune. What hasn't al
ready been said about the Stan
ford Volleyball team's living
legend?

The Olympian returned from
his international conquests in
Seoul this summer and has led
his Cardinal team to the greatest
heights it has ever achieved. As
everybody familiar with Stanford
Volleyball knows, he put down the

gold medal-clinching point for the
United States.
Even Dan Hanan, who has
reserved a spot for himself in
Stanford volleyball lore, classified
Fortune as "a volleyball god."
But what is it that is so special
about this 6-foot-6 outside hitter,
Stanford's team captain? Playing
on a team that, as a whole, has
compiled a .323 hitting percent
age, Fortune actually checks in
with below average offensive
numbers. In Stanford's 24 match
es, Fortune has hit .293.
Granted, that is a fairly impres
sive figure considering that For
tune is an outside hitter. But, all
of Stanford's current starters,
John Alstrom, Duncan Blackman,
Craig Forsyth, and Dan Hanan,
have hit more consistently than
has Fortune.
Nevertheless, Fortune has got
ten a disproportionate amount of
Parker Blackman's sets; through
out the season, almost one out of
three sets went to the captain.
The question is, "Why?"
Of course, the answer is multi
faceted, but it boils down to one
fact. Scott Fortune, two-time CIF
State Champion at Laguna Beach
High School, Olympic gold
medalist, hero of last weekend's
NCAA regional play, knows how
to get the job done. Or, more con
cisely, Fortune knows how to win.
There is nobody that Parker
Blackman can feel better about
setting in the clutch.
Fortune is the glue that holds
the Cardinal together. Sure, he
hits for a very respectable per
centage. But that is just the
launching point. He is a
smokescreen for all of Stanford's
other offensive weapons, drawing
huge amounts of attention from
opposing blockers and freeing up
guys like Duncan Blackman and
Dan Hanan to wreak havoc.
Fortune shares the team's pass
ing duties with Duncan Black
man, which is a job that requires
mental concentration from the
first point of a match to the last.
And then one can look at the de
fensive aspects of the outside hit
ter's game, digging and blocking,
where Fortune excels as well. He

is first on the team in dig average
and second in blocks.
So, in summary, Scott Fortune
does it all on the court. But, his
contribution to the Stanford cause
goes well beyond the statistically
tangible aspects of the game.
He is a living icon of excellence,
a standard that the other mem
bers of the Cardinal team can hold
themselves up to and attempt to
match. In addition, the fact that
he was voted captain by his team
mates is indicative of his inspira
tional and vocal leadership
abilities.
Throughout the Cardinal's
drive for the Final Four, Fortune
would handle the pre-match in
spirational talks. In the team's
courtside huddle that would form
just before each match's first
serve, Fortune would say,
"NCAAs guys, this is it."
Most recently, Fortune led Stan
ford to the promised land that is
the Final Four. In the regional
final against Hawaii, he compiled
33 kills, 20 digs and seven blocks
despite battling an acute case of
food poisoning. He was in and out
of the match, King on the floor
during game four and fighting the
urge to get sick for the entire
match.
Fortune described the hellish
experience, "Every time I'd dive,
I would hold my stomach and hope
nothing would come out. I just
felt terrible. They (Hawaii) were
a small team, and in game five,
all I thought about was jumping
as high as I could and hitting as
hard as I could. I didn't try any
thing fancy."
The intangibles. Competitive
fire. Scott Fortune has these char
acteristics, and if a team is going
to claim a national title, it has to
have players like Scott Fortune.
In addition to all of his other
accolades, Fortune has the ability
to win a match singlehandedly.
Just ask UC-Santa Barbara. That
squad witnessed Fortune's
wrecking-crew potential first
hand
In a three-game Cardinal vic-


Kal Keasey — Dalty f»e
Senior Scott Fortune has been at times an unstoppable hitting
force for the Cardinal. Playing sick, he helped lead Stanford to
wins over USC and Hawaii and earn a spot in the Final Four.
Tory, he racked up 46 kills, in
cluding 24 in one game. It is
doubtful that anybody in the
Western Intercollegiate Volleyball
Association would contest that,
when Fortune is on top of his
game, Stanford is invincible.
Well aware of his pivotal role
in Cardinal victories, and ac
knowledging that, indeed, when
he's playing well his team is un
stoppable, Fortune is subjected to
plenty of pressure. In fact, many
feel that, if Stanford is to come
away with a national title in its
first ever Final Four appearance,
Fortune MUST play well. Now
that's pressure.
Fortune shrugs it off, saying,
"I really don't think about it too
much. I just go out there and try
my best. I think that if I don't
play well, though, we have so
many other guys that we can go
to — we still have an excellent
chance of winning."
And then there's Fortune's
Olympic experience. Fortune off
handedly mentions names like
Chris Evert, "Flo Jo," and Greg

Louganis, seeming as if he was
at ease with the nation's best. -4
And why not? He is one of them.
Fortune describes the gold
medal match: "Volleyball was on
the last day of the Olympics, and
we really felt like if we didn't win,
people back home would be very
disappointed. We were also
favored throughout the Olympics,
and that put a little extra pressure
on us. Luckily, things worked out
well."
With Fortune contributing
strongly this time to the Cardinal
cause, maybe things will work out
well for Stanford this weekend in
Pauley Pavillion.
Because the Cardinal has For
tune in its arsenal, Stanford has
an excellent chance against the
field. Besides, the team has com
batted sicknesses, history (sweep
ing UCLA in Pauley for only
Stanford's second victory against
the Bruins in the last 36 meet
ings), all sorts of bad luck (e.g.
the Coin Toss) and has come out
smelling like a rose. One would
have to guess that the showdown
in Pauley between UCLA and
Stanford, if it comes down to that,
will be a classic. And, you can bet
that Scott Fortune will have a
large part to do with the outcome.
