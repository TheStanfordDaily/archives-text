One, two, three times a baby
The results are in from the First Annual Cutest Baby
Contest, which is held annually in Steller, New Jersey. Just
like in the Miss Amenca Pageant, babies first compete in
state competitions and then move on to the national finals
in Steller. This year's winner, Eugenio Anaya, hails all the
way from Spenard, Alaska.
In place of swimsuit and evening gown competitions,
babies are judged on personality, smile, friendliness and
overall cuteness. Anaya, pictured above, is shown here
smiling on his first birthday.

This Fnday, Saturday or Sunday the circus is coming
to town. The Pickle Family Circus, a one-nng circus ex
traordinaire, will be doing two shows daily at 12 and 3.30
p.m. at Angell Field (the I.M. fields).
Clowns, magicians, dancers — it's all there and more.
Take your kids, or if you don't have any, borrow some.
Tickets are $8 ($5 for kids under 12), and are available
at the door. Er.... at the tent flap.
From the overkill dept.
Lock the doors, hide the kids and cover your eyes, it's
slasher movie sequel update time.
Now filming in Los Angeles is "A Nightmare on Elm
Street, Part 5 — The Dream Child." In this lively sequel,
Alice Johnson (Lisa Wilcox) returns, but this time she's
pregnant. Who's the father? Freddy? The mind reels. We
are not making this up.
In October we've got "Halloween 5." Michael Myers,
who appeared to have died in "Halloween 4," is back, but
this time he's VERY disappointed that Jamie Lee Curtis
didn't get nominated for an Oscar for "A Fish Called
Wanda." We are not making this up either
And not to be outdone, stay tuned in August for (drumroll
please) "Fnday the 13th, Part VIII — Jason Takes Man
hattan." Oh barf. Can "Friday the 13th, Part IX — Jason
Does Dallas" be far behind? The mind reels and then
shuts off entirely.
