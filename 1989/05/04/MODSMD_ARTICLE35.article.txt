THE STANFORD DAILY'S ENTERTAINING WEEKLY

Picture hundreds of riderless
bicycles tracking down a woman
frantically running around
campus. Now imagine trying to
film that very same scenario.
Warren Scherffius, a graduate
student in the Department of
Communication, had to do more
than imagine it. For his award
winning videotape, "Spokes,"
Scherffius had to arrange for an
army of bikes to appear to converge
on an unsuspecting victim sitting
peacefully near Crothers Memo
rial.
It took three days of filming and
three weeks of preparation to shoot
this short which runs only four
minutes in its entirety. But for
Sherffius, the time and bicycle
recruiting certainly paid off.
"Spokes" is one of the 15 films
and videos selected for the 13th
Annual Palo Alto Film and Video
Festival, which shows next week
in Palo Alto.
More than 140 entries were sub
mitted for this year's festival,
which marks the first time videos
will be screened along with films.
The competition, open only to in
dependent filmmakers residing in
or attending school in Northern
California, has always held the
fundamental belief of the impor
tance of the filmmaker. Considered
one of the nation's best regional
film competitions, the Palo Alto
Film and Video Festival provides
a wonderful showcase for local tal
ent.
Four Stanford filmmakers, in
cluding Scherffius, are represented
among this year's festival winners.
Like Scherffius, Inez Robinson and
Camilla Calamandrei are graduate
students in the Communication
Department. For all three this
competition is their first — and
winning .1 spot in the festival is,
as Robinson said, "a nice reinforce
ment of our work." They join vet
eran filmmaker, lan Krawitz, an
associate professor in the Depart
ment of Communication, to com
plete the Stanford contingent.
Krawitz, who came to Stanford
after teaching for eight years at the
University of Texas at Austin, has
been independently producing and

directing documentary films since
1976. A shortened version of her
documentary on dwarfs, "Little
People," was nominated for an
Emmy Award in 1985 after na
tional braodcast on PBS. For the
festival she directed "Drive-In
Blues," a fun celebration of the
drive-in movie theater and a la
ment for its decline.
"'Drive-In Blues' explores the
drive-in from its heydey in the
1950s to its present day slow and
inexorable dying out," Krawitz ex
plained. She finds it interesting
that "since the film was made,
three of the 'living' drive-ins in the
film have gone out of business."
Krawitz filmed the 28-minute
documentary during the summer
of 1985 on a location shoot which
covered 5000 miles through Texas
and Colorado, on the trail of living,
dying and abandoned drive-ins. In
terviews with drive-in owners are
"fleshed out with archival materi
als we found lying in old projection
booths."
Krawitz unearthed great promo
tional gimmicks in the ruins, in
cluding one promo film which
invited moviegoers to bring shut
ins and invalids "and others whose
physical proportions make it un
comfortable ... to sit in an ordi
nary theater seat" to the drive-in
for free. And gone are the days of
"passion pits" — a nickname at
tributed to drive-ins in the archives
— for teenage patrons take their
love lives elsewhere. Krawitz's film
is a nostalgic look back at an
American institution
Also in the documentary vein is
Inez Robinson's "Color of lustice,"
in which Superior Court Judge
LaDoris Hazzard Cordell recounts
her experience with the South
African police in December of
1988. Robinson, a first-year grad
uate student, met ludge Cordell
through a mutual friend last No
vember, prior to Cordell's trip to
South Africa.
LaDoris Cordell, a graduate of
the Stanford Law School, and as
sistant dean of the Law School
from 1978-1982, attended the first
Fhiman Rights Conference held in
South Africa. Flcr presence as a
black American woman judge at
such an event was unprecedented.
While traveling in the country, she

was accused by South African
police of taking pictures of them
on her trip to that nation.
"It was wonderful as a Stanford
woman to do a film about another
Stanford woman," Robinson said.*
"Such an outstanding woman here
— this unprecedented figure in the
United States — was not credible,
not believed when she went some
where else."
Inez Robinson is currently work
ing on her thesis film, a half-hour
documentary on South Africa, for
which she is trying to raise funds.
On a lighter note, third-year
graduate student Camilla
Calamandrei recently completed
her thesis film, "At Arm's Length,"
which focuses on the resurgence
of ballroom dancing. Her entry in
the Palo Alto Film and Video Fes
tival, like her thesis, takes a unique
look at dancing.
"Sunday, April 26," Cala
mandrei's six-minute award wih
ner, is an impressionistic deCll*
ment of the annual Tea Dance
held at the Lucie Stern Community
Center in Palo Alto. Although the
student/filmmaker has spent time
dancing, her main interest m h©r
work is in gender roles. Hef-grad
uate studies at Stanford mark v the
beginning of her film training.
'"Sunday, April 26' is 'cinema
verite,' it was not staged. It was'
only observation." Calamandrei
had never been to a dance session
at the center, but when she found
out about it she obtained permis
sion to hang lights and film — if
she stayed out of the way.
"There's a distance inherent in
filmmaking, but in making this
film, we actually felt it — it was
a very vivid experience we all had.
It is very different to be a part of
the dancing than to be looking at
it through a camera. You realize
you can relate to the action al
though you are only watching it."
She also pointed out that unlike
most documentaries, her film was
not instructive, but purely observa
tional.
Unlike Calamandrei, who used
a fly-on-the-wall approach to
. filmmaking, Warren Scherffius had
to do more than watch; a lot of;
set-up and planning was necessary

for his video, "Spokes."
"I began to long for a scene with
out any bikes in it," Scherffius said.
"Every shot in it had problems."
The four-minute spoof of horror
films, Alfred Hitchcock's in par
ticular, features the most danger
ous of modern monsters — the
dreaded bicycle.
"I've loved movies since I was
a little kid and would go with my
dad," said Scherffius, the head
graduate coordinator of Crothers
and Crothers Memorial. Although
he studied engineering at Trinity
University in Texas, he wanted to
get into the film field, especially
special effects, so he could com
bine his engineering training and
film interest.
"Spokes" was shot in the sum
mer of 1987, before Scherffius at
tended Stanford's Mass Media
Institute. "I shot about four times
as much as I used. The poles,
wires, hands that we used to move
the bicycles would often be visible
so we'd have to do more takes. I
have a whole tape of bloopers."
Scherffius, like his classmates,
is hard at work on yet another
project. He's currently finishing a
half-hour video documentary on
Stanford's recently resurrected Up
ward Bound program, as well as
acting as director of photography
for another student's master's proj
ect.

The Palo Alto Film anil Video Fes
tival shows at the Varsity Theater
on Wednesday. May 10 and Thurs
day, May 11 at 7:30 p.m. Fifteen
short films will he shown, and
there is a different program each

"Spokes" will be included in the
May 10th screening, and "Sunday,

"I began to long for a scene with

THE STANFORD DAILY'S ENTERTAINING WEEKLY

Picture hundreds of riderless
bicycles tracking down a woman
frantically running around
campus. Now imagine trying to
film that very same scenario.
Warren Scherffius, a graduate
student in the Department of
Communication, had to do more
than imagine it. For his award
winning videotape, "Spokes,"
Scherffius had to arrange for an
army of bikes to appear to converge
on an unsuspecting victim sitting
peacefully near Crothers Memo
rial.
It took three days of filming and
three weeks of preparation to shoot
this short which runs only four
minutes in its entirety. But for
Sherffius, the time and bicycle
recruiting certainly paid off.
"Spokes" is one of the 15 films
and videos selected for the 13th
Annual Palo Alto Film and Video
Festival, which shows next week
in Palo Alto.
More than 140 entries were sub
mitted for this year's festival,
which marks the first time videos
will be screened along with films.
The competition, open only to in
dependent filmmakers residing in
or attending school in Northern
California, has always held the
fundamental belief of the impor
tance of the filmmaker. Considered
one of the nation's best regional
film competitions, the Palo Alto
Film and Video Festival provides
a wonderful showcase for local tal
ent.
Four Stanford filmmakers, in
cluding Scherffius, are represented
among this year's festival winners.
Like Scherffius, Inez Robinson and
Camilla Calamandrei are graduate
students in the Communication
Department. For all three this
competition is their first — and
winning .1 spot in the festival is,
as Robinson said, "a nice reinforce
ment of our work." They join vet
eran filmmaker, lan Krawitz, an
associate professor in the Depart
ment of Communication, to com
plete the Stanford contingent.
Krawitz, who came to Stanford
after teaching for eight years at the
University of Texas at Austin, has
been independently producing and

directing documentary films since
1976. A shortened version of her
documentary on dwarfs, "Little
People," was nominated for an
Emmy Award in 1985 after na
tional braodcast on PBS. For the
festival she directed "Drive-In
Blues," a fun celebration of the
drive-in movie theater and a la
ment for its decline.
"'Drive-In Blues' explores the
drive-in from its heydey in the
1950s to its present day slow and
inexorable dying out," Krawitz ex
plained. She finds it interesting
that "since the film was made,
three of the 'living' drive-ins in the
film have gone out of business."
Krawitz filmed the 28-minute
documentary during the summer
of 1985 on a location shoot which
covered 5000 miles through Texas
and Colorado, on the trail of living,
dying and abandoned drive-ins. In
terviews with drive-in owners are
"fleshed out with archival materi
als we found lying in old projection
booths."
Krawitz unearthed great promo
tional gimmicks in the ruins, in
cluding one promo film which
invited moviegoers to bring shut
ins and invalids "and others whose
physical proportions make it un
comfortable ... to sit in an ordi
nary theater seat" to the drive-in
for free. And gone are the days of
"passion pits" — a nickname at
tributed to drive-ins in the archives
— for teenage patrons take their
love lives elsewhere. Krawitz's film
is a nostalgic look back at an
American institution
Also in the documentary vein is
Inez Robinson's "Color of lustice,"
in which Superior Court Judge
LaDoris Hazzard Cordell recounts
her experience with the South
African police in December of
1988. Robinson, a first-year grad
uate student, met ludge Cordell
through a mutual friend last No
vember, prior to Cordell's trip to
South Africa.
LaDoris Cordell, a graduate of
the Stanford Law School, and as
sistant dean of the Law School
from 1978-1982, attended the first
Fhiman Rights Conference held in
South Africa. Flcr presence as a
black American woman judge at
such an event was unprecedented.
While traveling in the country, she

was accused by South African
police of taking pictures of them
on her trip to that nation.
"It was wonderful as a Stanford
woman to do a film about another
Stanford woman," Robinson said.*
"Such an outstanding woman here
— this unprecedented figure in the
United States — was not credible,
not believed when she went some
where else."
Inez Robinson is currently work
ing on her thesis film, a half-hour
documentary on South Africa, for
which she is trying to raise funds.
On a lighter note, third-year
graduate student Camilla
Calamandrei recently completed
her thesis film, "At Arm's Length,"
which focuses on the resurgence
of ballroom dancing. Her entry in
the Palo Alto Film and Video Fes
tival, like her thesis, takes a unique
look at dancing.
"Sunday, April 26," Cala
mandrei's six-minute award wih
ner, is an impressionistic deCll*
ment of the annual Tea Dance
held at the Lucie Stern Community
Center in Palo Alto. Although the
student/filmmaker has spent time
dancing, her main interest m h©r
work is in gender roles. Hef-grad
uate studies at Stanford mark v the
beginning of her film training.
'"Sunday, April 26' is 'cinema
verite,' it was not staged. It was'
only observation." Calamandrei
had never been to a dance session
at the center, but when she found
out about it she obtained permis
sion to hang lights and film — if
she stayed out of the way.
"There's a distance inherent in
filmmaking, but in making this
film, we actually felt it — it was
a very vivid experience we all had.
It is very different to be a part of
the dancing than to be looking at
it through a camera. You realize
you can relate to the action al
though you are only watching it."
She also pointed out that unlike

American institution
Also in the documentary vein is
Inez Robinson's "Color of lustice,"
in which Superior Court Judge
LaDoris Hazzard Cordell recounts
her experience with the South
African police in December of
1988. Robinson, a first-year grad
uate student, met ludge Cordell
through a mutual friend last No
vember, prior to Cordell's trip to
South Africa.
LaDoris Cordell, a graduate of
the Stanford Law School, and as
sistant dean of the Law School
from 1978-1982, attended the first
Fhiman Rights Conference held in
South Africa. Flcr presence as a
black American woman judge at
such an event was unprecedented.
While traveling in the country, she

was accused by South African
police of taking pictures of them
on her trip to that nation.
"It was wonderful as a Stanford
woman to do a film about another
Stanford woman," Robinson said.*
"Such an outstanding woman here
— this unprecedented figure in the
United States — was not credible,
not believed when she went some
where else."
Inez Robinson is currently work
ing on her thesis film, a half-hour
documentary on South Africa, for
which she is trying to raise funds.
On a lighter note, third-year
graduate student Camilla
Calamandrei recently completed
her thesis film, "At Arm's Length,"
which focuses on the resurgence
of ballroom dancing. Her entry in
the Palo Alto Film and Video Fes
tival, like her thesis, takes a unique
look at dancing.
"Sunday, April 26," Cala
mandrei's six-minute award wih
ner, is an impressionistic deCll*
ment of the annual Tea Dance
held at the Lucie Stern Community
Center in Palo Alto. Although the
student/filmmaker has spent time
dancing, her main interest m h©r
work is in gender roles. Hef-grad
uate studies at Stanford mark v the
beginning of her film training.
'"Sunday, April 26' is 'cinema
verite,' it was not staged. It was'
only observation." Calamandrei
had never been to a dance session
at the center, but when she found
out about it she obtained permis
sion to hang lights and film — if
she stayed out of the way.
"There's a distance inherent in
filmmaking, but in making this
film, we actually felt it — it was
a very vivid experience we all had.
It is very different to be a part of
the dancing than to be looking at
it through a camera. You realize
you can relate to the action al
though you are only watching it."
She also pointed out that unlike
most documentaries, her film was
not instructive, but purely observa
tional.
Unlike Calamandrei, who used
a fly-on-the-wall approach to
. filmmaking, Warren Scherffius had
to do more than watch; a lot of;
set-up and planning was necessary

for his video, "Spokes."
"I began to long for a scene with
out any bikes in it," Scherffius said.
"Every shot in it had problems."
The four-minute spoof of horror
films, Alfred Hitchcock's in par
ticular, features the most danger
ous of modern monsters — the
dreaded bicycle.
"I've loved movies since I was
a little kid and would go with my
dad," said Scherffius, the head
graduate coordinator of Crothers
and Crothers Memorial. Although
he studied engineering at Trinity
University in Texas, he wanted to
get into the film field, especially
special effects, so he could com
bine his engineering training and
film interest.
"Spokes" was shot in the sum
mer of 1987, before Scherffius at
tended Stanford's Mass Media
Institute. "I shot about four times
as much as I used. The poles,
wires, hands that we used to move
the bicycles would often be visible
so we'd have to do more takes. I
have a whole tape of bloopers."
Scherffius, like his classmates,
is hard at work on yet another
project. He's currently finishing a
half-hour video documentary on
Stanford's recently resurrected Up
ward Bound program, as well as
acting as director of photography
for another student's master's proj
ect.
