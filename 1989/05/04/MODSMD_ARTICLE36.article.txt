### 
The reaction to the Great Rooks updated
by contemporary authors last fall quarter
was so great that we're introducing the
Great Books Updated By Contemporary
Authors Book Club.
Join now and we'll send you six
GBUBCA for ONE CENT! You need only
buy four more books over the next two
years at regular club prices ($7,800-
$13,450 each).
Every month we'll send you the latest
in our exciting series. Examine each book
for 10 days. Look it over, read it, have
your mechanic check it out. If you like
it, do nothing. Don't move. Don't even
breathe. If you're not completely satisfied,
send the book back in its original packing
material with every little individual piece
of styrofoam in place.
Here's a sampling of a few of the new
books in the spring line:
"The Odyssey," updated by "James
Bond" author lan Fleming
007 crept silently into the cave where
his archenemy lay sleeping, the Walther
PPK Troian Issue dagger hugging insis
tently at his calf. The cave was completely
bare except for a few human bones scat
tered around the floor, and a World
Destroying Death-Ray Machine pointed

toward the sky.
007 knew when to feel fear, and now
was as good a time as any. A license to
kill didn't protect you from being scared,
especially a license with such a goofy pic
ture. 007 made a mental note to get the
picture on his license retaken.
And suddenly, there in front of him,
was the enemy, Polephemus the Cyclops.
007 remembered what he had read in the
dossier on the cyclops: 50-fcct-tall, man
eating, possessed of superhuman strength,
a bachelor, cnioys skiing and water polo,
possible homosexual tendencies.
shuddered.
The cyclops awoke with a start and
grunted. 007 removed his silver cigarette
case from the pocket of his tuxedo and
lit a cigarette with a piece of burning sailor.
"My name is Bond," he said. "Odysseus
Bond "
The cyclops peered down at 007 with
his single eye. "I liked Sean Connery bet
ter," he grunted. Odysseus appeared
shaken. Not stirred.
"Moby Dick," updated bv Exxon
On the 13th day at sea in the month
of July we had still not spotted the white
whale. Captain Ahab Hazclwood had
spent most of his waking hours forward

on the poopdeck — or occasionally
pooping on the foredeck.
Now and then the captain would pace
back and forth, his wooden leg pounding
out a beat that sounded much like "Funky
Cold Medina." But now he had taken to
drinking — port, brandy, Budweiser — it
was a sad sight to sec the captain so
thoroughly taken with alcohol.
It was late that night when Queckcg
heard the call of the first mate from the
crow's nest high above the Exxon Pequod's
deck.
"Thar she spawns!" came the crv from
the mate.
"Quick," shouted Queckcg, pulling me
along behind him, "let's find that whale.
And somebody tell that guy in the crow's
nest to stop mating!"
CRAAAACCKKKK'! We felt the ship
shudder, and a chill ran down my spine.
Captain Hazclwood appeared behind me
from the poopoodcck. Mis shirt was un
buttoned near to the waist and alcohol
smclled heavily upon his breath. H: had
a glimmer in his eye and I could have
sworn I saw him wink at two passing
sperm whales.
"Captain," I said, "we're spilling oil into
the sea."
"Yes," he said, "isn't it exciting? This

will take care of the white whale for sure."
Dante's "Inferno," by The Fodor
TYavcl Guides
If you've already visited all the typical
hot spots, why not try something different
this year — go to Hell! Just because it's
the eternal flaming destination of billions
of tortured souls doesn't mean that Hell
isn't a great place to visit. The people and
climate of Hell are much like what you'd
find in New York, only without the sales
tax.

■ > A,
Walk around with a Devil-may-care at
titude as you visit the many attraction*
of Hell. A quick stop by the Virgil Tour
Company, for instance, will apprise vou
of what fun activities are available. Take
the "Future Homes of the Evangelists"
tour, or, if you're into sightseeing, consider
a day trip to some of the surrounding
areas, such as New Jersey.
Hell is served by its own airline, Delta,
which offers flights into Hell International
Airport. Direct flights arc available for evil
travelers who wish to go straight to Hell,
while minor sinners may choosc the flight
with a stopover in Purgatory
Restaurants
Denny's. Their slogan in Hell: ' Alwavs
Closed." Four stars Visa, MC, DC, Di&'

The reaction to the Great Rooks updated
by contemporary authors last fall quarter
was so great that we're introducing the
Great Books Updated By Contemporary
Authors Book Club.
Join now and we'll send you six
GBUBCA for ONE CENT! You need only
buy four more books over the next two
years at regular club prices ($7,800-
$13,450 each).
Every month we'll send you the latest
in our exciting series. Examine each book
for 10 days. Look it over, read it, have
your mechanic check it out. If you like
it, do nothing. Don't move. Don't even
breathe. If you're not completely satisfied,
send the book back in its original packing
material with every little individual piece
of styrofoam in place.
Here's a sampling of a few of the new
books in the spring line:
"The Odyssey," updated by "James
Bond" author lan Fleming
007 crept silently into the cave where
his archenemy lay sleeping, the Walther
PPK Troian Issue dagger hugging insis
tently at his calf. The cave was completely
bare except for a few human bones scat
tered around the floor, and a World
Destroying Death-Ray Machine pointed

toward the sky.
007 knew when to feel fear, and now
was as good a time as any. A license to
kill didn't protect you from being scared,
especially a license with such a goofy pic
ture. 007 made a mental note to get the
picture on his license retaken.
And suddenly, there in front of him,
was the enemy, Polephemus the Cyclops.
007 remembered what he had read in the
dossier on the cyclops: 50-fcct-tall, man
eating, possessed of superhuman strength,
a bachelor, cnioys skiing and water polo,
possible homosexual tendencies.
shuddered.
The cyclops awoke with a start and
grunted. 007 removed his silver cigarette
case from the pocket of his tuxedo and
lit a cigarette with a piece of burning sailor.
"My name is Bond," he said. "Odysseus
Bond "
The cyclops peered down at 007 with
his single eye. "I liked Sean Connery bet
ter," he grunted. Odysseus appeared
shaken. Not stirred.
"Moby Dick," updated bv Exxon
On the 13th day at sea in the month
of July we had still not spotted the white
whale. Captain Ahab Hazclwood had
spent most of his waking hours forward

on the poopdeck — or occasionally
pooping on the foredeck.
Now and then the captain would pace
back and forth, his wooden leg pounding
out a beat that sounded much like "Funky
Cold Medina." But now he had taken to
drinking — port, brandy, Budweiser — it
was a sad sight to sec the captain so
thoroughly taken with alcohol.
It was late that night when Queckcg
heard the call of the first mate from the
crow's nest high above the Exxon Pequod's
deck.
"Thar she spawns!" came the crv from
the mate.
"Quick," shouted Queckcg, pulling me
along behind him, "let's find that whale.
And somebody tell that guy in the crow's
nest to stop mating!"
CRAAAACCKKKK'! We felt the ship
shudder, and a chill ran down my spine.
Captain Hazclwood appeared behind me
from the poopoodcck. Mis shirt was un
buttoned near to the waist and alcohol
smclled heavily upon his breath. H: had
a glimmer in his eye and I could have
sworn I saw him wink at two passing
sperm whales.
"Captain," I said, "we're spilling oil into
the sea."
"Yes," he said, "isn't it exciting? This

will take care of the white whale for sure."
Dante's "Inferno," by The Fodor
TYavcl Guides
If you've already visited all the typical
hot spots, why not try something different
this year — go to Hell! Just because it's
the eternal flaming destination of billions
of tortured souls doesn't mean that Hell
isn't a great place to visit. The people and
climate of Hell are much like what you'd
find in New York, only without the sales
tax.

■ > A,
Walk around with a Devil-may-care at
titude as you visit the many attraction*
of Hell. A quick stop by the Virgil Tour
Company, for instance, will apprise vou
of what fun activities are available. Take
the "Future Homes of the Evangelists"
tour, or, if you're into sightseeing, consider
a day trip to some of the surrounding
areas, such as New Jersey.
Hell is served by its own airline, Delta,
which offers flights into Hell International
Airport. Direct flights arc available for evil
travelers who wish to go straight to Hell,

with a stopover in Purgatory
