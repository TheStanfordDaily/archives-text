# Masters of Reality are not Cream
## 
### Bill Fagelson 
This past spring break I went
to see the Replacements during
my visit home. The band that
opened for them was loud and
looked nothing like the 'Mats.
As a matter of fact, they weren't
received well by an audience
composed mainly of college stu
dents.
Perhaps it was the volume,- or
it might have been the bottles
of whiskey they kept taking
drinks from. (As David Lee Roth
during a Van Halen concert said
to a fan who had asked if the
JD he was drinking up on stage
was real, "This ain't no fucking
Quiet Riot.") Whatever the
reasons, nobody was really lis
tening to them.
The band was Masters of
Reality. You may have heard
their first single, "The Blue Gar
den," but didn't realize it. It's
more probable that you thought
it was some old Cream song that
you'd never heard before. The
song, as well as their self-titled
debut album, goes deeper than
just a rehashing of Cream's
trademark sounds. Actually,
"The Blue Garden" is the only
song that really sounds com
pletely like Cream. Their music
is a mix of heavy metal and the
blues.
Rick Rubin produced the al
bum in the Def American label.
You can feel his presence on

most of the songs, especially
"The Candy Song," a tune bound
to offend some women with lines
like "Sugar Girl knocks me off
of my feet / Yeah the price is
high but the candy's sweet." It
has the age-old blues tradition
of objectifying women as well as
some blatant nods to Led Zep
pelin, as Rubin is wont to do.
"John Brown," a semi-acoustic
piece, can hold its own with most
of Zep's material on "Led Zep
pelin III" and "Physical Graffiti."
With his trademark heavy back
beat, Rubin has produced a cross
between heavy metal and Texas
blues with a touch of white blues
thrown in.
The fact that these boys are
just playing the blues adds to
the tendency for them to sound
familiar. A song like "Lookin' To
Get Rite" is a simple acoustic
blues piece that's just a tradi
tional arrangement. Likewise,
"Magical Spell" sounds like
"Blueberry Hill" with a few al
terations, but it stands as a sep
arate song.
The strongest comparison,
however, is with Cream. Chris
Goss' voice is about the closest
I've ever heard to Jack Bruce's
(better known as "the guy who
played bass in Cream"). This
alone would make it hard to
avoid the comparison; but Goss,
Rick Rubin and guitarist Tim
Harrington manage to reproduce
what Eric Clapton did singlehan
dedly.
The distortion effects are fan
tastic on "The Blue Garden" and
"Sleepwalkin"' a psychedelic ex
cursion about, of course, a drug
trip. He doesn't talk about "tiny
purple fishes" like Bruce, but of
fers, "I stood there in my own
mind / The way a stranger prowls
around."
The music reflects more than

just the style of British white
boy blues, however. If you are
listening you'll hear a little ZZ
Top. They are playing some
serious Texas blues somewhere
in there. "Kill the King" begins
with a classical piano and guitar
arrangement, then dives into per
haps the hardest rocking they do
on the album. It sounds a lot
like some of the stuff ZZ Top
did early on, but played like
heavy metal. "Gettin' High" is
another Texas blues rocker that
reveals the layers of style in their
music.
"Masters of Reality" have
looked back to their music's
roots, something that very few
heavy metal bands of today are
willing or able to do. Heavy metal
came out of the blues.
It started with Clapton and
what he did with Cream. Led
Zeppelin is heralded as the heavy
metal band, when in reality they
played the blues, and Black Sab
bath is more likely the first real
heavy metal band. There is still
a strong tradition of the blues in
heavy metal today, though.
Aerosmith and Cinderella put
out blues songs on their last al
bums, attesting to this fact.
"Masters of Reality," therefore,
is hard to pin down in terms of
style. They are a blues band who
understand the lessons that rock
in the '60s and '70s learned.
They do sound a little like
Cream, Led Zeppelin or even ZZ
Top, but who can blame them
for knowing what good music is.
At the core they are a blues
band playing heavy metal, and
doing a pretty good job of it.

"Masters of Reality" is available
at finer record stores every
where. Heck, it's probably avail
able at scummy record stores
too, for all we know.

Harrington manage to reproduce
what Eric Clapton did singlehan
dedly.
The distortion effects are fan
tastic on "The Blue Garden" and
"Sleepwalkin"' a psychedelic ex
cursion about, of course, a drug
trip. He doesn't talk about "tiny
purple fishes" like Bruce, but of
fers, "I stood there in my own
mind / The way a stranger prowls
around."
The music reflects more than

just the style of British white
boy blues, however. If you are
listening you'll hear a little ZZ
Top. They are playing some
serious Texas blues somewhere
in there. "Kill the King" begins
with a classical piano and guitar
arrangement, then dives into per
haps the hardest rocking they do
on the album. It sounds a lot
like some of the stuff ZZ Top
did early on, but played like
heavy metal. "Gettin' High" is
another Texas blues rocker that
reveals the layers of style in their
music.
"Masters of Reality" have
looked back to their music's
roots, something that very few
heavy metal bands of today are
willing or able to do. Heavy metal
came out of the blues.
It started with Clapton and
what he did with Cream. Led
Zeppelin is heralded as the heavy
metal band, when in reality they
played the blues, and Black Sab
bath is more likely the first real
heavy metal band. There is still
a strong tradition of the blues in
heavy metal today, though.
Aerosmith and Cinderella put
out blues songs on their last al
bums, attesting to this fact.
"Masters of Reality," therefore,
is hard to pin down in terms of
style. They are a blues band who
understand the lessons that rock
in the '60s and '70s learned.
They do sound a little like
Cream, Led Zeppelin or even ZZ
Top, but who can blame them
for knowing what good music is.
At the core they are a blues
band playing heavy metal, and
doing a pretty good job of it.

"Masters of Reality" is available
at finer record stores every
where. Heck, it's probably avail
able at scummy record stores
too, for all we know.
This past spring break I went
to see the Replacements during
my visit home. The band that
opened for them was loud and
looked nothing like the 'Mats.
As a matter of fact, they weren't
received well by an audience
composed mainly of college stu
dents.
Perhaps it was the volume,- or
it might have been the bottles
of whiskey they kept taking
drinks from. (As David Lee Roth
during a Van Halen concert said
to a fan who had asked if the
JD he was drinking up on stage
was real, "This ain't no fucking
Quiet Riot.") Whatever the
reasons, nobody was really lis
tening to them.
The band was Masters of
Reality. You may have heard
their first single, "The Blue Gar
den," but didn't realize it. It's
more probable that you thought
it was some old Cream song that
you'd never heard before. The
song, as well as their self-titled
debut album, goes deeper than
just a rehashing of Cream's
trademark sounds. Actually,
"The Blue Garden" is the only
song that really sounds com
pletely like Cream. Their music
is a mix of heavy metal and the
blues.
Rick Rubin produced the al
bum in the Def American label.
You can feel his presence on

most of the songs, especially
"The Candy Song," a tune bound
to offend some women with lines
like "Sugar Girl knocks me off
of my feet / Yeah the price is
high but the candy's sweet." It
has the age-old blues tradition
of objectifying women as well as
some blatant nods to Led Zep
pelin, as Rubin is wont to do.
"John Brown," a semi-acoustic
piece, can hold its own with most
of Zep's material on "Led Zep
pelin III" and "Physical Graffiti."
With his trademark heavy back
beat, Rubin has produced a cross
between heavy metal and Texas
blues with a touch of white blues
thrown in.
The fact that these boys are
just playing the blues adds to
the tendency for them to sound
familiar. A song like "Lookin' To
Get Rite" is a simple acoustic
blues piece that's just a tradi
tional arrangement. Likewise,
"Magical Spell" sounds like
"Blueberry Hill" with a few al
terations, but it stands as a sep
arate song.
The strongest comparison,
however, is with Cream. Chris
Goss' voice is about the closest
I've ever heard to Jack Bruce's
(better known as "the guy who
played bass in Cream"). This
alone would make it hard to
avoid the comparison; but Goss,
Rick Rubin and guitarist Tim
Harrington manage to reproduce
what Eric Clapton did singlehan
dedly.
