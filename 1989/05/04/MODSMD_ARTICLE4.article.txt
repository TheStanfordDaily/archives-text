# Wrestling with fusion findings
## 
### Jock Friedly Editorial staff 
Cold fusion has officially
turned into a spectator sport
— an All-Star Wrestling match.

News Analysis

of sorts, for scientists. In one
corner are the physicists; the
chemists are in the other.
And after a few quick and
dirtv blows directed at chemists

this week, the physicists said
they want out of the ring.
At a meeting of the American
Physical Society in Baltimore
that concludes today, physicists
blasted cold fusion supporters
— who are mostly chemists.
They said the researchers who
first reported cold fusion are
nothing short of sloppy scien
tists.
"I don't think anyone wins
gold stars for behavior in this
affair," said Peter Galison, asso
ciate professor of history of sci
ence at Stanford.
"It's not the way you should be
doing science," said Materials Sci
ence Prof. Robert Huggins, who
two weeks ago announced a con
firmation of the original reports
from Utah.
Huggins said he has not been
the victim of any of these attacks
from scientists. He has, however,
received hate mail.
"Your claim to have verified
cold fusion is ludicrous," said one
piece of mail from a budding, but
anonymous, scientist. "By Dec. 31,
1989 your name will be mud like
the [University of] Utah chem
ists."
Although the physicists are the
most guilty of the name-calling,
not all of them are hitting below
the belt.
"I think it's a bad thing for
(there to be) public name-calling,"
said Physics Prof. Walter Meyer
hof.
Meyerhof discovered another
venue for his skepticism of the
cold fusion claims. In a news con
ference at the physics meeting
Tuesday, Meyerhof read a recent
poetic composition of his:
Tens of millions of dollars
are at stake,
Dear Sister and Brother,
Because some scientists put
a thermometer
At one place and not an
other.
This poem was not the only
spectacle at the meeting. Scien

tists rarely decide on scientific
validity by hand counts, but that's
what happened in Baltimore on
Tuesday. A panel voted 8-1 that
they were 95 percent sure fusion
was not the answer for these ex
periments.
Panel voting was just one ex
ample of how science has been
transformed by the cold fusion
affair. Scientists have been holding
press conference after press con
ference to announce their discov
eries rather than sending papers
to journals.
Not only are the scientists
talking to the press, they are also
learning how to do the experi
ments from journalists. Huggins,
for example, received a copy of
the Utah papers about fusion
from a reporter. He said one team
working on cold fusion decided
the size for their electrodes from
a picture in one of the major
papers.
Galison said it is "enormously
frustrating" to be forced to learn
science from reporters rather than
fellow scientists. Some of the sci
entists, particularly the Utah re
searchers, are vying for patents
and they fear disclosures of their
exact methods will allow other sci
entists to capture the glory — and
the money.
Physicists, however, say there
will be no cold cash from cold
fusion.
Despite those negative votes,
the chemists say the match is not
over yet — the second round is
just about to begin. Monday,
chemists will get their chances to
respond to physicists' concerns at
a meeting of the Electrochemical
Society in Los Angeles.
