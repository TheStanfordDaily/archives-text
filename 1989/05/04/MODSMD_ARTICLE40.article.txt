# Stephen King's 'Pet Sematary': It stinks, but at least it's stupid
## 
### Alex Kostich Staff writer 
Stephen King books are a lot like
junk food. They're cheap, good and
easily digested. If that's the case,
then Stephen King movies are like
stale Fritos — they're cheap, bad
and disgusting. King's latest movie
is based on his novel "Pet
Sematary," which was a bland con
cept to begin with.
The book told the story of an
ancient Indian burial ground where
children buried their dead pets.
Little did anyone know that the
soil at this place had the power to
raise the deceased. In any case,
King basically rehashed "Night of
the Living Dead" with zombie
animals rather than humans. (Of
course, humans ended up in the
pet cemctary as well, resulting in
a circus of the walking dead).
The film's problem is that it
doesn't capture King's wit and
spirit — it's a stillborn slice-and
dice movie, at best. The novel had
interesting moments as it explored

A George Romero ver
sion of a "Huggies"
commercial

the consequences of raising the
dead ("You don't mess with what
God intended"). But the movie
can't have an omniscient narrator,
and it can't plunge into the stream
of-consciousness passages that arc
King's trademark.
Instead, under Mary Lambert's
sledgehammer direction, we are
spoonfed excessively bloody scenes
that aren't at all scary — just gross.

Two people are hit by trucks, three
are stabbed and two others are set
on fire. As the body count rises,
you can't help but wonder why
King didn't come to the rescue.
He adapted the screenplay and he
makes a cameo, but where was he
when the director butchered his
book?
Mary Lambert, who directed
Madonna's "Material Girl" and
"Like a Prayer" videos, hasn't the
slightest notion of how to build
tension. Her idea of a scare is drop
ping a cat out of a tree onto some
one's unsuspecting head. The
climax of the plot, which was rela
tively frightening in the book, will
evoke laughter in the movie ver
sion. Without giving anything
away, I can say it plays like a
George Romero version of a
"Huggies" commercial.
A lot of King's casual lingo and
deadpan humor is lost in the trans
fer to the screen, and the characters
seem hatched from a TV sitcom.
"Pet Sematary" isn't scary or in
ventive or stylish. It's just boring.
