Capturing first place honors as
the best tasting, best looking and
most sensusal type of condom, a
Japanese brand called "Skin Less
Skin" came out on top in this
year's Condom Rating Contest.
According to results released
early yesterday, Skin Less Skin
beat out six American-made con
dom brands.
"Unlike men, all condoms are
not created equal," said Daniel
Bao, director of the Stanford Aids
Education Project. He said they
ran the contest to dispel the myth
that all condoms are the same.
The Stanford AIDS Education
Project, in cooperation with AIDS
task forces at five other colleges
and universities in California,
sponsored the contest, which fea

tured seven different condom
brands. In February, nearly
70,000 condoms were distributed
over three days to students at the
different universities. Participants
then rated the contenders on a
scale of one to 10. Two thousand
packages of condoms were alloted
to Stanford.
The condom ranking applied to
several categories including Over
all Favorite, Best Tasting, Best
Appearance, Most Sensual/Com
fortable, Best Smelling and
Greatest Sense of Security. Stan
ford students submitted 54 bal
lots. More than one student could
fill out a ballot.
In addition to the numerical
scores, students submitted their
own personal comments about the
condoms.
