Capturing first place honors as
the best tasting, best looking and
most sensusal type of condom, a
Japanese brand called "Skin Less
Skin" came out on top in this
year's Condom Rating Contest.
According to results released
early yesterday, Skin Less Skin
beat out six American-made con
dom brands.
"Unlike men, all condoms are
not created equal," said Daniel
Bao, director of the Stanford Aids
Education Project. He said they
ran the contest to dispel the myth
that all condoms are the same.
The Stanford AIDS Education
Project, in cooperation with AIDS
task forces at five other colleges
and universities in California,
sponsored the contest, which fea

tured seven different condom
brands. In February, nearly
70,000 condoms were distributed
over three days to students at the
different universities. Participants
then rated the contenders on a
scale of one to 10. Two thousand
packages of condoms were alloted
to Stanford.
The condom ranking applied to
several categories including Over
all Favorite, Best Tasting, Best
Appearance, Most Sensual/Com
fortable, Best Smelling and
Greatest Sense of Security. Stan
ford students submitted 54 bal
lots. More than one student could
fill out a ballot.
In addition to the numerical
scores, students submitted their
own personal comments about the
condoms.

"Your date will run screaming
from the room when she tastes
it," wrote one student. "Wow!"
remarked another.
Skin Less Skin was the overall
favorite for the second-straight
year.
"Golden Circle Coin," the con
test winner in 1987, placed second
overall this time around, and took
first in the best smelling category.
"Embrace Lubricated," which
finished third overall, received
first place in the best lubrication
category. Students ranked Saxon
Ribbed as having the greatest
sense of security.
Although some may worry that
the contest promotes casual sex,
contest organizers disagreed.
"People walk even if you don't
give them shoes to protect their
feet," said Beowulf Thorne, direc
tor of the UC-Santa Cruz Condom
Co-Op.
All the condoms were donated
by the manufacturers for the con
dom contest.
