# Bundy calls for conventional force cuts
## 
### Susan McKean Editorial staff 
Without mentioning any names,
foreign policy luminary McGeorge
Bundy put the ball of Soviet-
American relations in President
Bush's court last night, as he
spoke in a sparsely filled Cubber
ley Auditorium.
"The right place for the large
step towards reconciliation and
new thinking between both gov
ernments is now in the office of
the President of the United
States," said the former national
security assistant to President
Kennedy and one of this century's
foremost foreign policy makers.
As the first lecture of The Wes
son Lecture Series in Interna
tional Relations: Theory and
Practice, Bundy called on histor
ical examples to illuminate the
immediate issue of the U.S. role
in current arms control negotia
tions and touched on a wide range
of related topics.
A veteran analyst of war and
peace, Bundy called for the expe
dient and thorough reduction of
conventional weapons in Europe.
He said to his audience, which
conspicuously lacked student at
tendance, "It is the imbalance of
conventional deployments that
has been the cause of our nuclear
worries," and imparted Bush with
the power to take this lead in
talks in Geneva.
Discrediting the view that the
process of democracy interferes
with the conduct of responsible

foreign relations, he attributed
historically successful foreign
policy in America to the success
of presidential leadership.
And leadership, by his defini
tion, requires asking the right
questions to understand a given
situation, and then translating
that understanding into an acces
sible, sufficient explanation.
Bundy accorded this skill to So
viet leader Mikhail Gorbachev,
and gave as proof Gorbachev's
unilateral conventional force
reductions proposed in December
at the United Nations. He said
this step was a carefully calcu
lated response to the Soviets' do
mestic troubles and a needed, but
novel, move to increase stability
by removing forces.
He hailed the use of unilateral
processes of arms control, rather
than relying on and getting
bogged down in treaty making.
Looking back on Gorbachev's
years so far, he told the audience
that it is not the rapidity of
change in the Soviet Union that
"is shocking, but the direction of
the changes that is remarkable."
And Bundy examined the forces
for this change, and the forces
playing in the United States and
Europe. These included the in
creased attention to domestic
problems, and the internal
political climates determining
foreign policies, particularly in
West Germany.
He cited as a second objective,
after cutting conventional forces,
the preservation of NATO. The

alliance, he said, must stay to
gether as it adjusts to the warm
ing up of the Soviet Union, and
he charged the United States with
this task.
"There is a problem of holding
your people together, especially if
your objective is an object of hope
rather than an object of imminent

danger," he said, alluding to
NATO affairs with the Warsaw
Pact countries.
The rift between Germany and
Britain, now capturing front
pages nationwide, is important
but not insolvable, he said, and
did not advocate rushing into nu
clear weapons reductions.
