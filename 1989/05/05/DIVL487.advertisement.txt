SATYAGRAHA
OPERA IN THREE ACTS IN SANSKRIT
Philip Glass' Safyagraha has played to critical acclaim
and sold-out houses in cities across the country as well as
in Europe. John Rockwell, music critic of the New York
Times calls Safyagraha "deeply moving and theatrically
compelling." Thor Eckert, in the Christian Science Monitor,
says "Safyagraha is not so much an opera as a total
musico-theatrical encounter. Glass's score casts a unique
spell." Safyagraha promises to be one of 1989's most
discussed musical events
