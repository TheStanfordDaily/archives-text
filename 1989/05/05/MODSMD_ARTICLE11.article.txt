# Rushing to finish Roble

### Jonathan Eisenberg Staff writer 
Roble Hall's $7.3 million
dollar renovation project is
"about half way" to comple
tion, according to Project Man
ager Jonathan Ryan, and
University officials remain con
fident that the student resi
dence will be ready to reopen
next fall.
The last of the eight concrete
towers that will make 71-year
old Roble seismically stable
were poured last week. With
the completion of the towers
the "major part" of the ren
ovation — chances of delay on
the project are reduced by 50
percent, said Ryan.
The remaining work mostly
consists of improving existing
utilities as well as adding new
facilities, including a more
elaborate basement recreation
room, a bigger dining area, an
open kitchen to compliment
University Food Service and a
stairway to connect the "pent
house" in the A-wing to the
main builiding.
Although the contractor,
Overaa, guarantees that the
work will he done on August
31 and is currently on schedule,
the project has "very little float
time," according to Ryan.
"It might be the challenge of
my career" to bring the job home
by the deadline, said Ryan, but
he stated that he fully expects
Roble to reopen fall quarter.
Roble was closed over Christ
mas break in 1987, when a Uni
versity researcher examining
photographs of the building's con
struction determined that it was
unsafe in the event of an earth
quake.
The only possible causes of
delay in the near future are two
problems in the kitchen area,
Rvan explained. F'irst, the Uni
versity is "at the mercy of the
suppliers" as it awaits delivery of
a custom-made conveyer line for
dirty dishes, said Ryan.
Second, project managers dis
covered last week that the entire
ceiling in the dining area will have
to be removed and replaced.
Workers planned to remove only
a few rows of ceiling tiles before
enlarging the area connecting the

kitchen and the dining area, but
they discovered that all the tiles
are interconnected.
Earlier in the project, workers
exposed asbestos insulation
around plumbing pipes hidden be
hind the walls, causing a delay in
the progress as they removed the
hazardous material. Ryan said the
asbestos posed no health threat
to former Roble residents.
Workers have been putting in
10-hour days and some time on
weekends to catch up from the
delay, said Ryan.
Bill Georges, assistant director
of the Housing Center, said that
because of the successful efforts
to stay on schedule, the Univer
sity currently has no formal back
up plan to relocate students
assigned to Roble if the dorm does
not open next year.
Justifying the lack of a plan,
Georges noted that the gap be
tween the August 31 deadline and
the beginning of classes at the
end of September is a "fairly large
cushion" of time if unforeseen
renovations need to be made.
In addition to constructing the
concrete towers and other
stabilizing structures — such as

a 10-inch wide steel bar that runs
along the top of the third floor's
walls — the project calls for im
provements in Roble facilities, in
cluding:
• Replacement of current
plumbing and electrical systems;
• Installation of a new $500,000
ceiling sprinkler system and more
fire exits;
• Wiring in every bedroom to
connect personal computers to
Stanford computer networks; and
• Construction of ramps to al
low handicapped students access
to the first floor.
Ann Porteus, who will return
next year with her husband Evan
as Roble's resident fellows,
praised the University for taking
the opportunity to upgrade
Roble's utilities. She said the
plumbing system, as old as the
residence itself, caused some "hor
rendous problems" over the years.
The final work to be done on
Roble is the replastering and
repainting of walls that were torn
asunder during the construction.
Ryan said that there was an out
side chance that painters will still
be retouching the interior as stu
dents move in next fall.
