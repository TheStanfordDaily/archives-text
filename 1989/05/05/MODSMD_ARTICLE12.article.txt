## Iran-Contra jury convicts Oliver North on three counts 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Oliver
North, the Marine at the shadowy
center of the Reagan administra
tion's secret effort to arm the
Nicaraguan Contras, was con
victed yesterday of altering and
shredding documents and of two
other charges in the Iran-Contra
affair. He was acquitted on nine
other counts.
North said he would appeal the
jury's decision: "We're absolutely
confident of the final outcome. As
a Marine I was taught to fight
and fight hard for as long as it
takes to prevail."
"We will continue this battle
and we will be fully vindicated,"
he told reporters in a statement
at his lawyer's office. He did not
take questions.
The retired Marine lieutenant
colonel, who faces up to 10 years
in prison on the convictions, lis
tened to the verdict without any
show of emotion. Jurors said he
was guilty of illegally changing
and destroying documents, accept
ing an illegal gratuity — a $13,800
home security system — and one
count of aiding and abetting in
an obstruction of Congress.
One juror said the 12 days of
deliberations had included "a lot
of bickering and arguing" and
that the conviction votes came
yesterday after a fellow juror of
fered "a strong prayer."
North had admitted in court
that he misled members of

Congress about his Iran-Contra
activities, hut said he had done
so at the direction of superiors.
He was acquitted of five other
charges of lying to or obstructing
Congress, of two counts of lying
to then-Attorney General Edwin
Meese 111 and obstructing Meese's
inquiry into the affair, of convert
ing traveler's checks to his own
use and of conspiring to defraud
the Internal Revenue Service by
using a tax-exempt foundation to
raise funds for the Contras.
After judge and jury had left
the room, North walked to a
railing separating him from his
wife, Retsy, and kissed her lightly
on the cheek. Mrs. North had been
sitting in the front row with a
clergyman.
It was the first trial born of
the scandal that marred the last
two years of Ronald Reagan's
presidency and raised questions
about then-Vice President George
Rush's involvement in the clan
destine effort to arm the Contras.
Even as the jury was returning
its verdict, Rush told reporters at
the White House that he did not
participate in any arrangement to
expedite aid to other countries in
exchange for their support for the
Contras. The White House said
Rush would have no comment on
the verdict.
In Los Angeles, former Presi
dent Reagan also declined com
ment.
