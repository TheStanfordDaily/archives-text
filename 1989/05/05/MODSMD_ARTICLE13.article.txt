# Verdict still leaves questions

WASHINGTON (AP) - The verdict in Oliver
North's Iran-Contra trial gave both sides credible
claims to partial victory in the grueling battle for
the jury's votes.
"You can't say at this juncture that either side
walked away with their theory intact," said Wash
ington attorney Lawrence Barcella.
Although North stands convicted of three felony
charges, the jury acquitted him of all the charges
that he lied to Congress â€” including an allegation
that he falsely answered lawmakers' questions dur
ing a face-to-face meeting.
"There is something there for everyone," said
Washington attorney Richard Ven-Veniste, a former
Watergate prosecutor.
Throughout the case, prosecutors for independent
counsel Lawrence Walsh argued that North's lies
to Congress cut to the heart of the democratic
process by subverting the government's reliance on
truth.
Hut jurors cleared the former presidential aide of
these charges, accepting North's denials that he
helped prepare false statements. Jurors also appar
ently accepted North's explanation that when he
did participate in fabrications, it was on orders from
superiors.
The jury's verdict on these counts was the worst
defeat for Walsh, whose office has spent $16 million
investigating and prosecuting North and the other
Iran-Contra defendants.
After dropping charges that North conspired to
illegally divert U.S.-Iran arms-sale profits to the
Nicaraguan rebels, Walsh was left with a case that
North lied, cheated and stole money.
Ben-Veniste noted that North was cleared of lies
to Congress that allegedly took place while the Con
tra resupply operation was still secret.
