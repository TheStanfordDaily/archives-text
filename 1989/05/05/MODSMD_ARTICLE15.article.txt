women who take birth control pills
for more than four years run a
significantly increased risk of
breast cnncer, according to a
major British study published
today.
The researchers said that
among women younger than 36,
they found a 43 percent increase
in the risk of breast cancer after
four years of pill use and a 74
percent increase after eight years.
They called on doctors to tell
women about the possible risks

of breast cancer before they
prescribe contraceptive pills, but
they did not advocate avoiding
oral contraceptives.
The study, published in the
prestigious medical weekly The
Lancet, is the most comprehensive
look at the pill and breast cancer
ever undertaken in Britain and
one of the largest in the world.
Clair Chilvers of the Institute
of Cancer Research in London,
one of the authors of the study,
advised women to aim for the
lowest-dose pill available and stay

on it for the shortest possible
time.
"Women who are not having in
tercourse should stop taking it,"
she told a press conference in Lon
don.
Earlier studies on the relation
ship between the pill and breast
cancer have reached conflicting
results. Last January, a I'.S. Food
and Drug Administration commit
tee of experts declared that recent
research on possible links between
the pill and breast cancer was in
conclusive.
