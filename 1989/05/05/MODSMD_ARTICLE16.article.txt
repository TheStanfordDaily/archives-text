# Space shuttle takes off at last

CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)
— Atlantis found a hole in the
clouds and thundered into orbit
yesterday, sailing 184 miles above
Earth where five astronauts
prepared to propel NASA's state
of-the-art Magellan probe on a
mapmaking journey to Venus.
Scientists hoped the $550 mil
lion project would open a new
"golden age" for an American
planetary program dormant for a
decade.
In a spectacular start, the
winged spaceplane vaulted away
from its seaside launch pad at
'2:47 p.m. EDT, after being
delayed a cliff-hanging 59 minutes
by shifting clouds and winds that
had threatened a second postpone
ment in six days.
Atlantis departed just five
minutes before its 64-minute
launch window for the day would
have expired — a window dictated

by a requirement to have the
shuttle in the proper position in
orbit to dispatch Magellan to
Venus.
The launch team had advanced
the countdown to the 5-minute
mark and held there, waiting for
a break in the clouds that
obscured a runway near the
launch pad where Atlantis would
land in an emergency.
Chief astronaut Dan Bran
denstein, flying a weather scout
plane, found a break, signaled the
go-ahead, and the count was
started and carried down to the
blazing liftoff.
"It was another cliff-hanger.
I'm glad you stuck with it," acting
NASA administrator Dale Myers
said as he congratulated the
launch team.
It was the 60th U.S. man-in
space flight, the 29th for the
shuttle and the fourth since the

Challenger explosion more than
three years ago.
"Four of us are very happy to
be back in space, and the fifth
one is very happy to be here,"
radioed astronaut David Walker,
mission commander.
Walker, pilot Ron Grabe and
mission specialists Mary Cleve
and Norman Thagard flew on pre
vious shuttle flights. Mission spe
cialist Mark Lee is a rookie.
"Did somebody win the pool up
there?" mission control commen
tator John Creighton asked the
crew. "We had only five minutes
left in the window."
"We wouldn't want to push it
any closer," replied Walker.
rhe astronauts quickly turned
to remotely checking Magellan
before its scheduled release later
yesterday into an independent or
bit.
