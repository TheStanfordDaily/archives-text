Five I '.S. marines killed in crash
DIGNE, France (AP) — A U.S. military helicop
ter crashed and exploded in southern France
after it hit a high-tension power line on a night
training flight, and all five Marines aboard were
killed, officials said yesterday.
The UH-1 Huey fell about 200 feet and then
crashed into a mountain stream and exploded at
about 9:45 p.m. Wednesday near Rougon, a village
60 miles northwest of Nice.
The craft was from the amphibious assault
ship Guadalcanal, in port in Toulon, and was
assigned to Marine Medium Helicopter Squadron
162 based at the New River, N.C.. Marine Corps
Air Station.
The pilots were using night-vision goggles, but
military officials said there was no reason to

suspect the goggles played a role in the crash.
A Marine official in Washington, however, said
the goggles do not permit pilots to see power lines.
The Army recently ordered a safety inspection
of its night-vision goggles after several crashes.
