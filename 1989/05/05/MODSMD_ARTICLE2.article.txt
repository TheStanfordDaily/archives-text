# Kennedy objects to Standard legislation
## Free speech issue ignites Fac Sen 
### Morgan Slain Staff writer 
The campuswide debate over the Stu
dent Conduct Legislative Council's
recent interpretation of the Fundamen
tal Standard flared up in yesterday's
Faculty Senate meeting, where student
leadefs, professors and University Pres
ident Donald Kennedy sparred over the
issue for nearly an hour.
Although the senate has no power to
enact or Kill the interpretation, 551 stu
dents signed a petition delivered in April
which asked the senate to carefully con
sider the SCLC's interpretation and its
effects on free speech. The senate must
respond to any such petition that has
more than 500 signatures.
The proposal considered yesterday is
the SCLC's second attempt to write a
Fundamental Standard interpretation
which distinguishes between free speech
and discriminatory harrassment. The
Council withdrew its first proposal after
the Stanford community overwhelm
ingly criticized it for obstructing First
Amendment rights.
Yesterday's debate revealed a wide
range of opinions. -Some, including Ken
nedy and Law Prof. Gerald Gunther,
objected to any legislation at all on the
issue.
After telling the senate he found prob
lems in the SCLC proposal, Kennedy
said, "Enactment of legislation of this

sort presents more difficulties than it
does advantages."
Both Kennedy and Gunther said the
problems being considered were so im
portant that the SCLC needs to give
the Stanford community more opportu
nity to discuss them.
But Business School Prof. George
Parker, the chair of the SCLC, was
unclear about the current status of the
proposal and the timetable for general
comment.
Student leaders with speaking rights
in the senate charged the proposal with
being too weak and demanded stiffer
legislation to protect minorities.
Stanford is trying to develop a mul
ticultural, multiracial environment
while still maintaining free speech, but
"the First Amendment really doesn't
care whether you hate your neighbor,"
argued ASSU Senate Chair David
Porter.
Before the Ujamaa incident, students
felt that the Fundamental Standard
would protect them, Porter said, but
then they saw that all the University
did to the offenders was show "righteous
indignation."
Council of Presidents member Stacey
Leyton charged that, if passed, the
SCLC proposal "really will not address
the problems occurring in dorms."
A few faculty staunchly defended the
new interpretation. Education Prof.
Denis Phillips offered "very strong sup

port for the present proposal. ... The
things that it rules out are things I
would not like to see at Stanford."
When he introduced the legislation,
Parker said that free speech was a "most
precious" ideal.
Rut as debate heated up, Parker ap
peared to become exasperated with the
constant bickering over constitutional
ity. He said, "We're getting into a tre
mendous morass," and then suggested
the Fundamental Standard itself might
breach First Amendment rights.
Philosophy Prof. John Perry, another
SCLC member, charged that the current
system for prosecuting violations of the
Standard was inadequate. As a Residen
tial Fellow in Wilbur Hall, he said he
knew of cases over the past several years
where students had screamed obsceni
ties at others and otherwise degraded
fellow students.
When the victims of these incidents
came to him, Perry said, he told them
the Fundamental Standard was too
weak to do anything.
University officials questioned Per
ry's claims. In an unusual move, Ken
nedy spoke out of turn to support Uni
versity Gene r a 1 Counsel John
Schwartz's assertion that the incidents
Perry described were violations of the
Standard and could he prosecuted.
After the meeting. Judicial Affairs Of
ficer Sally Cole told Perry that she had
in fact prosecuted similar cases.
