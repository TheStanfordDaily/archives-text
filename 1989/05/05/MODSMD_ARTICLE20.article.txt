## Poor performance 
### 
SLOPPY PREPARATION
and lack of sensitivity
turned what could have
been an effective political state
ment into a potentially dangerous
situation.
Stanford Central America Ac
tion Network staged a kidnap
ping Sunday in several Univer
sity dining areas which was sup
posed to represent alleged viola
tions of civil rights by the death
squads in El Salvador.
But because of SCAAN's poor
preparation, residents of Otero,
one of the dorms selected,
thought the kidnapping was real.
The "performance" shocked and
upset the residents, rather than
enlightening them.
SCAAN should have notified
police and resident assistants
beforehand and made it clearer
to their audiences that the kid

napping was only theater, not a
real abduction.
The "theater action" defeated
its own purpose: According to
Otero residents, for the past few
days El Salvador has not been
the subject of interest, SCAAN's
tactics have.
SCAAN's poor planning and
lack of sensitivity have showed
up elsewhere on campus. Scat
tered around campus have been
white hand marks in chalk —
representing the symbol of Mano
Blanco, the Salvadoran guerrilla
group that is allegedly kidnap
ping people.
Although the idea is to promote
awareness, most people are not
aware of the meaning behind the
symbol. The hand marks also
show a lack of sensitivity toward
the workers who will end up
cleaning the marks off.
