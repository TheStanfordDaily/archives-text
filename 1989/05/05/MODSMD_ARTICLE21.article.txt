WHEN YOU INVITE 75
people to a party and
none of them show up,
you might be insulted. Well, Uni
versity officials didn't exactly
receive engraved invitations to
the United Stanford Workers'
tribunal on Stanford labor prac
tices.
But it was neither respectful
nor constructive for the 75 in
vited officials to refuse to attend
en masse.
The USW staged the tribunal
at the Law School Tuesday in
order to air their grievances
about examples of "blatant rac
ism and sexism" on the part of
University managers.
According to USW field repre
sentative Rodney Barnette, the
University's legal office issued a

memo asking University manag
ers not to attend the tribunal.
University officials could neither
confirm nor deny the existence
of the memo.
Whether or not such a memo
existed, the University's resound
ing absence sent out a clear mes
sage to the workers that Univer
sity officials were not interested
enough or concerned enough to
attend.
Perhaps the University simply
made a tactical error: Although
University managers are not ex
emplary employers, they've
shown a sincere effort in improv
ing workers' conditions.
However, the number of com
plaints lodged by workers indi
cates that there is significant
room for improvement.
