## ASSU election blues 
### 
I DO NOT UNDERSTAND the logic
behind the ASSU fee refund system.
The ASSU forcibly collects money
in order to fund student groups on
campus. In order to get my money back,
I have to vote in the spring ASSU Elec
tion.
Does voting in the election make the
money more mine? No. The money the
ASSU takes from me, nearly $90 over
the course of the year, is my money.
If I don't want to support student
groups on campus with personal funds,
then I should have the right to take that
money back, regardless of whether I
voted or not.
Imagine the uproar if the U.S. govern
ment decided that every person who had
not voted in the 1988 presidential election
would not receive a tax refund.
If the ASSU reversed the present policy
and allowed all students to receive their
refunds, the drain on student groups
would no doubt increase.
There is a significant body of students
who want their money back, who don't
feel represented by the student groups
and who are apathetic about student gov
ernment.
The fact that they are apathetic and
choose not to vote should have no bearing
on whether they receive their money
back.
Some people may argue that student
groups deserve the money they are voted
in the spring election. I think it sets a
dangerous and annoying precedent for
the ASSU and University to allocate my
money and set requirements for me to
get it back.
If student groups want a true measure

of how well they represent the Stanford
population, they should advocate the
opening of refunds to everyone and give
students the opportunity to vote with
their pocketbook.

In other news this week, the ASSU
proved what a joke fee assessment elec
tions really are. By the Axe Com
mittee to get back on the ballot, the
senate set a confusing precedent.
Has the senate set a policy to allow
any group that loses its fee assessment
in the general election to have a second
chance?
The justification promulgated by the
Council of Presidents was that students
did not understand the implications of
rejecting the Axe Committee's request,
so the committee should be given one
more chance.
I can hear someone behind closed doors
in the ASSU office saying, "Students just
don't understand the true importance of
the Axe Committee." I would respond
that according to that thesis we might
as well just have the senate decide who
gets funding and bypass students entirely
(which isn't too far from the truth as it
is).
So what if it is students' money being
spent.
I suspect that going into the first elec
tion, the Axe Committee leaders ar
rogantly expected their fee request to
pass easily and didn't feel any publicity
was required.
The committee is at fault for not
making it publicly known that a "no"
vote translates as no bonfire. To give

I should have the right
to take that money
back, regardless of
whether I voted or not.

them a second chance puts an undue
burden on students and shows a lack of
respect for the students who did vote and
who made their decision with the ex
pectation that the end result would be
binding.
The Axe Committee should not get its
money this year â€” as students indicated
in the election. And if students feel hurt
by the result, they will undoubtedly ap
prove an assessment next year.
I am also highly skeptical that the Axe
Committee would be getting another
chance if there wasn't a COP run-off
election. The expense and trouble of hold
ing another election would probably have
been avoided.
The end result of the senate's actions
is the introduction of a random factor
into election policy that fundamentally
detracts from the whole process.
