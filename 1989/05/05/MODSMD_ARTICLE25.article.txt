# Survey sought to understand racism, not to reinforce it
## 
### 
According to last week's coverage in
The Daily, members of the Council of
Presidents have charged that a ques
tionnaire inquiring into the nature of
racism on the Stanford campus that I
mailed to a sample of seniors, "uses
loaded questions that will yield
prejudiced findings."
One COP member even went so far
as to say that "Bunzel could really use
the results he receives to hurt the
unity students are trying to build at
Stanford," adding that "it seemed like
the questions were worded in ways
that would get his expected answers."
It calls to mind a remark made by
Samuel Butler: "I don't mind lying,
but I hate inaccuracy."
I have been involved in a year-long
project on racism that relies exclusively

and draws on the direct experience of
students. The questionnaire asks
seniors to provide information on their
own observations and to comment on a
few issues on their own terms.
Virtually every question (excluding
those asking for biographical informa
tion) gives students a choice of re
sponses, such as "Strongly Disagree,"
"Somewhat Disagree," "Somewhat
Agree," "Stronly Agree," "Don't Know"
or "No Opinion." Some questions offer
a choice of "Yes," "No" or "Don't
Know."
Not a single question forces a stu
dent to come up with an answer that
he or she does not wish to provide.
The questionnaire is voluntary, and no
one who participates can be identified
by name because no names are sought.
All responses will be kept confidential.
The study is a modest effort to pro
vide as accurate a picture as possible
of students' views on an important
subject that will be examined and
reexamined on this campus and on
campuses across the country for years
to come.

The notion that Stanford students
are somehow being manipulated to
provide answers that "will get Bunzel's
desired result" is simply wrong-headed.
It is also an insult to the intelligence
of graduating seniors.
One COP member criticizes the sur
vey for asking questions that "lead to
a conclusions." But every survey looks
for information that will lead to con
clusions.
In this instance, the survey depends
entirely on the information and conclu
sions of students, not mine. How can I
produce my "expected results" when I
have no idea what the students are
going to say? "Good grief!" as Charlie
Brown would say.
I wish to make a more personal
observation. The great philosopher
Bertrand Russell has said that what is
wanted is not the will to believe, but
the wish to find out, which is the ex
act opposite.
I have a great desire to find out
what students have experienced and
what they think and believe about this
sensitive and complex subject. I have

focused in this study on black-white
issues because for some reason these
are the ones that are at the heart of
the controversy on most campuses
today.
But my interest in racism reflects
another consideration. Apart from my
own personal involvement in the civil
rights movement for more than 40
years, I continue to be interested in
studying race relations because I want
to find out — both as a citizen and as
a social scientist — what still needs to
be understood about why most whites
(according to the m*yor studies) believe
that color distinctions have no place in
an integrated and egalitarian society, at
the same time that racists continue to
spread their poison.
I should also add that a good part of
my motivation to continue to inquire
and to learn comes from the belief
that the media's treatment of these
complicated issues is less than satisfac
tory.
