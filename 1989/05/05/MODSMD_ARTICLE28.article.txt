Dear Bug,
I was just curious: Every year
Dean Jean, a goddess if there ever
were one, admits around 2,500
freshmen. By some good fortune,
only 1,500 seem to accept.
What would happen if all 2,500
accepted?
— Uriah Heep
What would happen is that, fi
nally, with 1,000 tuition checks
hanging in the balance, the Uni
versity would build new housing.
But, according to Dean Fetter,
it as about as unlikely an event
as could be imagined, and she
hopes saying so won't inspire the
God of Chance to ensure that it
does.
"The laws of probability are on
our side," Dean Fetter under
stated, citing statistics which
show that in each of the past 25
years the yield has been between
60 and 64 percent.
When the acceptance letters are
sent out in April, the Admissions
Office is counting on a disparity
of no more than the square root
of n, where n is the number of
applicants, according to Fetter. In
the case of 2,500 applicants, that
would be 50.
A 62 percent yield is the ideal,
but 50 students more or 50 stu
dents less would still lead to a
matriculation somewhere within
the normal range.
If more students can be admit
ted, the wait list files are
reopened. This pool of applicants
is completely re-evaluated before
acceptance letters are sent out.
After this, the 1,200-student
transfer pool is evaluated and de
cisions are mailed out during the
first week of June.
By the time Dean Fetter had
explained all this, the Bug felt as
if he had gone through the whole
process himself.
Dear Bug,
What happens if one approaches
a Bay Area toll plaza without the

requisite funds to pay the toll?
— The Phantom
Well, this is a very personal
issue. There are a number of op
tions.
You could drive right through
without paying (and almost cer
tainly get away with it); OR, you
could turn around and drive the
wrong way down the freeway 'til
you got to an exit ramp and then
go over to the correct freeway and
drive home and get the requisite
funds and then drive back;
OR, you could drive up to the
booth where, according to the Cal
ifornia Highway Patrol, the atten
dant would, essentially, give you
a ticket for your temporary
poverty.
Of course, if you're like me, you
don't bother with this car crap in
the first place and so never have
to worry about driving anywhere,
giving anybody a ride, parking, or
going through toll booths.
Of course, when being driven
by somebody anywhere, I'm al
ways sure to bring along a couple
quarters so that I can contribute
to the toll payments and thus
won't feel guilty when the driver
picks up the entire gas bill.
Incidentally, next time you're at
a toll booth and feelin' zany, try
this one on the attendant: "Hey,
can I have one of those special
chocolate chip cookies?"
