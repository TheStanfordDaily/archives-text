# MEChA: 20 years of empowerment
## 
### Erika Ryst 
Twenty years might seem
short when looking at the grand
scheme of time in Chicano/
Latino history, but members of
MEChA would argue otherwise.
Crying and celebration
abounded in a Los Angeles high
school last month, as MEChA
members from across California
traveled there to celebrate the
organization's 20th anniversary.
The Movimiento Estudiantil
Chicano de Aztlan is a statewide
network of campus groups com
mitted to representing the inter
ests of Chicanos and Latinos.
Calling the celebration both
"powerful and touching," senior
Gina Hernandez, co-chair of
Stanford's MEChA, made her
way down to the event with
about 20 other Stanford stu
dents.
"I was really proud that we've
been around for 20 years making
steps for Chicanos," she said.
Hernandez delivered a key
note speech at the celebration,
while other MEChA members
sang, created a statewide banner
and encouraged community col
lege students to attend. Board of
Trustees members Luis Nogales
and Peter Bing both helped fund
the conference.
Festivities ranged from an art
show to Chicano music work
shops led by members of Los

Lobos and Dr. Loco. Noted
Chicanos such as State Sen. Art
Torres, Texas congressman Kika
Dela, comedian Cheech Marin
and actress Rosanna De Soto all
spoke at the 20-year celebration.
Hernandez said she was
touched by the presence of par
ents and community members
at the conference. "The theme
that came out was that Chicano
students are getting an educa
tion because of the sacrifices of
parents and community mem
bers. The victory for us is a vic
tory for them," she said.
The central event of the
celebration was the unveiling of
the updated "El Plan de
MEChA." This document, in
stituted 20 years ago as the con
stitution and guidelines of
MEChA, was updated at Stan
ford. The document now calls
for the increase of funding
budgets for education in Califor
nia, measures to end racism on
college campuses and the im
provement of Chicano studies.
The plan also proposes to
strengthen MEChA regionally,
state-wide and nationally, to
support struggles of people in
labor and the community and to
maintain participation in the po
litical arena as a unified net
work.
The plan plays an integral part
in MEChA's history. First pre
sented at a spring 1969 confer

ence in Santa Barbara, it served
as the "vision of MEChA," ac
cording to former Stanford
MEChA chair Lucky Gutierrez.
From this origin stemmed a
statewide network. At Stanford,
MEChA's existence led to the
establishment of El Centro
Chicano, the Casa Zapata theme
house and the Chicano Fellows
Program.
The organization disappeared
in the early '80s, but a reformed
version re-emerged in the fall of
1985 and has been expanding
ever since.
The name MEChA refers to
the organization's function as a
student arm of the movement
for Chicano educational rights.
As Stanford MEChA co-chair
Delia Ibarra expalined, "We see
Chicano students as being con
nected to the movement of the
Chicano people."
Because of this connection,
MEChA is a "very political"
group, she said.
"When you talk about Chicano
people, you have to talk about

politics," Ibarra added. Because
of underrepre9entation, crime
and poverty plaguing Chicanos,
"empowering our people is vi
tal," she said.
Gutierrez expressed a similar
sentiment. "We need to link up,
preserve Chicano rights." To
this end, MEChA worked to sup
port Webb Ranch workers. "A
lot of us came from that (work
ing class) background, so we feel
compelled to help the [United
Stanford Workers,]" he said.
Besides supporting USW
workers, MEChA has worked on
Spring Action, the People's Plat
form, the Rainbow Agenda, the
Literacy Project, academic semi
nars on Chicano research, the
MEChA newspaper "El Aguila"
as well as various cultural activ
ities.
MEChA members are now
pushing for the establishment of
a full-time dean for El Centro.
"In this we have been inspired
bv the black community,"

Gutierrez said.
To further this cause, MEChA
held a press conference Wednes
day afternoon with members of
several other minority student
groups publicizing the need for a
full-time dean.
Ibarra predicted that there
would be a full-time dean "by the
end of the year."
According to Gutierrez, more
long-term goals for MEChA in
clude "continuing to build more
faculty for Chicano Studies, and
making sure the University's ears
are open to us."
In addition, Gutierrez said he
hopes MEChA will "expand its
ability to reach out to students."
"Through MEChA I've seen a
lot of the best come out of the
Chicano people," he said.
Ibarra also sees MEChA as a
"way of asserting who we are.
Coming to Stanford made me see
who I was — that I had a different
culture, a special one," she said.

Coming to Stanford made me see
who I was — that I had a different
culture, a special one," she said.
Twenty years might seem
short when looking at the grand
scheme of time in Chicano/
Latino history, but members of
MEChA would argue otherwise.
Crying and celebration
abounded in a Los Angeles high
school last month, as MEChA
members from across California
traveled there to celebrate the
organization's 20th anniversary.
The Movimiento Estudiantil
Chicano de Aztlan is a statewide
network of campus groups com
mitted to representing the inter
ests of Chicanos and Latinos.
Calling the celebration both
"powerful and touching," senior
Gina Hernandez, co-chair of
Stanford's MEChA, made her
way down to the event with
about 20 other Stanford stu
dents.
"I was really proud that we've
been around for 20 years making
steps for Chicanos," she said.
Hernandez delivered a key
note speech at the celebration,
while other MEChA members
sang, created a statewide banner
and encouraged community col
lege students to attend. Board of
Trustees members Luis Nogales
and Peter Bing both helped fund
the conference.
Festivities ranged from an art
show to Chicano music work
shops led by members of Los

Lobos and Dr. Loco. Noted
Chicanos such as State Sen. Art
Torres, Texas congressman Kika
Dela, comedian Cheech Marin
and actress Rosanna De Soto all
spoke at the 20-year celebration.
Hernandez said she was
touched by the presence of par
ents and community members
at the conference. "The theme
that came out was that Chicano
students are getting an educa
tion because of the sacrifices of
parents and community mem
bers. The victory for us is a vic
tory for them," she said.
The central event of the
celebration was the unveiling of
the updated "El Plan de
MEChA." This document, in
stituted 20 years ago as the con
stitution and guidelines of
MEChA, was updated at Stan
ford. The document now calls
for the increase of funding
budgets for education in Califor
nia, measures to end racism on
college campuses and the im
provement of Chicano studies.
The plan also proposes to
strengthen MEChA regionally,
state-wide and nationally, to
support struggles of people in
labor and the community and to
maintain participation in the po
litical arena as a unified net
work.
The plan plays an integral part
in MEChA's history. First pre
sented at a spring 1969 confer

ence in Santa Barbara, it served
as the "vision of MEChA," ac
cording to former Stanford
MEChA chair Lucky Gutierrez.
From this origin stemmed a
statewide network. At Stanford,
MEChA's existence led to the
establishment of El Centro
Chicano, the Casa Zapata theme
house and the Chicano Fellows
Program.
The organization disappeared
in the early '80s, but a reformed
version re-emerged in the fall of
1985 and has been expanding
ever since.
The name MEChA refers to
the organization's function as a
student arm of the movement
for Chicano educational rights.
As Stanford MEChA co-chair
Delia Ibarra expalined, "We see
Chicano students as being con
nected to the movement of the
Chicano people."
Because of this connection,
MEChA is a "very political"
group, she said.
"When you talk about Chicano
people, you have to talk about

politics," Ibarra added. Because
of underrepre9entation, crime
and poverty plaguing Chicanos,
"empowering our people is vi
tal," she said.
Gutierrez expressed a similar
sentiment. "We need to link up,
preserve Chicano rights." To
this end, MEChA worked to sup
port Webb Ranch workers. "A
lot of us came from that (work
ing class) background, so we feel
compelled to help the [United
Stanford Workers,]" he said.
Besides supporting USW
workers, MEChA has worked on
Spring Action, the People's Plat
form, the Rainbow Agenda, the
Literacy Project, academic semi
nars on Chicano research, the
MEChA newspaper "El Aguila"
as well as various cultural activ
ities.
MEChA members are now
pushing for the establishment of
a full-time dean for El Centro.
"In this we have been inspired
bv the black community,"

Gutierrez said.
To further this cause, MEChA
held a press conference Wednes
day afternoon with members of
several other minority student
groups publicizing the need for a
full-time dean.
Ibarra predicted that there
would be a full-time dean "by the
end of the year."
According to Gutierrez, more
long-term goals for MEChA in
clude "continuing to build more
faculty for Chicano Studies, and
making sure the University's ears
are open to us."
In addition, Gutierrez said he
hopes MEChA will "expand its
ability to reach out to students."
"Through MEChA I've seen a
lot of the best come out of the
Chicano people," he said.
Ibarra also sees MEChA as a
"way of asserting who we are.
