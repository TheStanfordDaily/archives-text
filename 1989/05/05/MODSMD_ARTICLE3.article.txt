## 
### Baldwin Lee Staff writer 
The Slate of the Times will be next year's
Council of Presidents, according to results
after 95 percent of the votes were counted
in the ASSU Runoff Election.
With results as of 11 p.m. last night,
54.88 percent of approximately 2,700 voters
marked their paper ballots in support of
Slate of the Times, a People's Platform
party endorsement.
Junior David Brown, a slate member,
said the victory was a vote of confidence
in the People's Platform's vision. The cur
rent COP slate, of which Brown is a mem
ber, is also endorsed by the People's Plat
form.
Alex Hoye, a member of the losing Stu
dents' Choice slate, said he felt good about
a relatively close race.
The Axe Committee's rejuvenated cam
paign for a special fee request failed in
spite of receiving a 56.23 percent yes vote.
ASSU Bylaws require that at least 15 per
cent of the student body approve of a special
fee for it to pass. Of the approximately
1,800 votes needed, the Axe Committee
had received 1,535 votes by the 11 p.m.
tally.
A Kinder, Gentler Slate received 59.22
percent of the vote to handily defeat chal
lenger Slate for the '90s in the Senior Class
Presidents race.
Three voting seats were available in the
Student Conduct Legislative Council race.
I'he top three vote getters were Leonard
Adler, Perry Friedman and Tino Pena.
In addition, the ASSU constitutional
amendment to modify the General Fee
budget process was defeated bv a wide mar

gin, receiving only 43.84% of the vote. The
amendment needed a two-thirds majority
to pass.
ASSU Senate Chair Dave Porter, a main
proponent of the amendment, said the main
reason for the amendment's defeat was The
Daily's negative endorsement.
Axe Committee chair Pat Broun said he
was frustrated by student apathy shown
by the low voter turnout. Broun, a soph
omore, said the committee had done the
best they could, distributing fliers and
meeting with students at house meetings
and dining halls.
Broun said that it was "a real bummer"
for the Axe Committee to lose on a tech
nicality. Although he was personally disap
pointed, Broun said the greatest loss would
be to the student body, who would miss
the committee's traditional events, such as
the Big Game Bonfire.
He said he was unsure of the committee's
future plans, but said it would be difficult
to get any alumni donations after
students had rejected the organi
zation twice.
Also on the ballot, a referendum
gauging student support of abor
tion rights passed in a landslide,
capturing 85.29 percent of the
vote. The referendum asked if
voters supported a women's right
to the choice of abort ion as upheld
by Roe v. Wade.
ASSU Senator Kathyrn Cole, an
author of the resolution, said the
combination of the referendum's
success and last Monday's pro
choice rally in White Plaza showed
definitive student support for
abortion rights.
