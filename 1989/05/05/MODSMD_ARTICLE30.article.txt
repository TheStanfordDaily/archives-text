# Celebrating Cinco de Mayo
## 
### 
In 1862, the independent
nation of Mexico was under
French imperialist rule.
Napoleon 111 had overrun the
country several years before
and the small Mexican army
seemed no match for the
strength of the French forces.
Then, on May 5, 1862, at
the Battle of Puebla, the
Mexicans defeated the French
and drove Napoleon and his
troops from their country.
Each year on May 5,
Chicanos all over the United
States and Mexico celebrate
this victory as their most im
portant holiday of the year â€”
Cinco de Mayo. In Spanish,
the holiday's name literally
means May 5.
According to sophomore
Delia Ibarra, co-chair of
MEChA, a Chicano student
group, Cinco de Mayo is the
"prime holiday for Chicano
people in the United States."

Because of the disparity be
tween the two sides in the
battle, Ibarra said the victory
was "kind of like David de
feating Goliath."
MEChA will be hosting a
concert on the back patio of
Tresidder Union this after
noon featuring mariachi
bands like Dr. Loco, Ibarra
said.
Casa Zapata, the Chicano
and Mexican-American theme
house, will also be celebrating
the holiday.
According to Zapata resi
dent assistant Jon Inda, the
house will hold a special Cath
olic mass at 1 p.m. on Satur
day in the Stern Hall
courtyard. The service will be
followed by an afternoon
celebration as well as a special
dinner and speaker Saturday
night in Casa Zapata's dining
hall, Inda said.
