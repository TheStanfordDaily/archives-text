## Spikers face Ball State in NCAA semifinals 
### John Kirks Staff writer 
The big dance. The brawl for it all.
The NCAA's postseason party — the
Final Four. This weekend in UCLA's
Pauley Pavilion, the Stanford men's vol
leyball team enters its first-ever Final
Four, embarking on its quest for a na
tional title.
To claim the championship, Stanford
will have to rise above the Ball State
Cardinals, a scrappy squad from Indiana,
in the national semifinal. That match
gets underway at 5:30 p.m. And then, to
win the big one, Stanford will most likely
have to fight its way through homestand
ing UCLA in the NCAA final on Saturday
night at 7:30.
Both matches will be broacast live on
KZSU (90.1 FM).
UCLA is no newcomer to the national
volleyball spotlight, having won the
championship 12 times since the NCAA
first sanctioned a national championship
for volleyball in 1970.
Stanford has risen above unbelievable
adversity on the road to Los Angeles,
battling injuries, illnesses and the team's
formidable Western Intercollegiate Vol
leyball Association foes all season long.
All that effort was largely wasted, how
ever, when Stanford tied UCLA for the
league title and lost WIVA's automatic
Final Four berth — on a coin flip.
Nevertheless, the Cardinal has made
it to the promised land, fighting through
USC and Hawaii, the No. 5-ranked and
third-ranked teams in the land. In fact,
one might think that the Stanford players
would be content just being in the Final
Four. They have made school history al
ready by just advancing this far.
But, on the contrary, the team is ex
tremely hungry. "We really feel we have
momentum going into the weekend,"
Stanford Coach Fred Sturm said. "We
had to fight to earn a spot in this Final
Four, and hopefully we'll be able to capi
talize by winning a national champion
ship."
"We aren't overlooking Ball State, and
UCLA might have a tough time with
Penn State," Scott Fortune said.
"But, if the final is between us and
UCLA .. . , he paused and continued,
"Well, I UCLA Coach Al] Scates recruited
me, and one of his pitches was that I'd
never win a national championship at
Stanford. Remembering him saying that

would make a championship all the
sweeter."
And the chess match between the two
coaching staffs has already begun. A 1
Scates has apparently told the press that
Stanford should be favored, but his at
tempts to soften his potential Cardinal
opponents before the final showdown are
failing.
Fortune, in response to Scates, smiled
and said, "He's a real sandbagger. We
aren't the jeast bit affected by him."
Besides, just because Stanford swept

UCLA in the two teams' last meeting
does not mean that the Cardinal will
have an easy time with the Bruins. In
fact, the two teams split their two con
ference matches, and UCLA defeated
Stanford in an additional preseason
tournament match
If the Cardinal could sneak into the
Bruins' backyard and steal a national
championship, it would cap what would
have to be considered a dream season
for Dan Hanan, Fortune and Co.
