# Cardinal may have the Inside Edge
## 
### 
Without any ado, let's get down
to business. There's an NCAA
volleyball trophy impatiently
awaiting a winner in Pauley Pavilion
this weekend, and it may well be the
Cardinal that does the claiming.

Yes, this is yet another column with
lofty expectations. But rather than
relying on personal speculation, Stan
ford Coach Fred Sturm provided the
lowdown of the showdown in a harried
chat earlier in the week.
No idle banter here. After all, this
is Inside Edge. Here, then, is the inside
scoop on the Final Four.
Stanford's semifinal opponent is Ball
State, ranked eighth nationally and
the winner of the Midwest Regional.
Behind the hitting of All-American-to
be Chris Beerman, the slick setting of
Chris Cooper and the capable coaching
of Don Shondell, the Cardinals have
played well against good competition.
Now you know about as much as
Sturm does.

The Cardinal and the Cardinals have
not met this season, nor in any season
(which is probably best for easily
confused match announcers). Much of
what the Stanford coaches have ascer
tained about Ball State is in the form
of tidbits gleaned from conversation
with other coaches or performance
against common foes. In other words,
not many facts but a lot of guesswork.
The result is that Stanford will be
experimenting at the outset. The
team's patented blocking plays will be
put on hold until the Cardinal has a
better feel for the Ball State hitting
corps' tendencies.
Sturm has always respected openess
and adaptability; these will be the buzz
words in his pregame preparations.
The key, Sturm said, is siding out.
It is not quite as rewarding as scoring
points, but his objective is to learn as
much as possible, as quickly as pos' i
ble, without yielding many points.
Once Stanford understands the
enemy, the Cardinal shall conquer it.
Victory is not guaranteed but is a
pretty solid bet.
That would pit the Cardinal up
against the winner of the Penn State-
UCLA match for the national title. Of
the semifinals, this is the more diffi
cult to predict.
The Bruins would seem to have the
inside edge, playing on their home floor
and in front of their own fans. Behind
setter Matt Sonnichsen, UCLA's hit
ters have had a fine year.
Penn State has Chris Chase. His


EVAN TUCHINSKY
INSIDE EDGE
jump-reach is almost 12 feet. He
hits over most blockers. Few
teams can stop him. He is scary.
Whichever team wins will give
Stanford a stern test for the title.
If the Nittany Lions prevail, the

Cardinal will have to play much
in the same manner as in the Ball
State match, as Stanford has not
played Penn State either.
The Bruins are an all-too
familiar foe, however. In the reg
ular season, Stanford lost in five
games at home but won in three
on the road. Pauley has been good
for the Cardinal this year; enough
said.

Well, in a nutshell, that's the
scoop from the expert (not me,
Sturm). Suffice it to say that
Stanford's second NCAA champi
onship trophy of the year may be
traveling home Sunday morning
with Sturm and his squad (says I).
By the way, the KZSU (90.1
FM) broadcasts from Los Angeles
promise to be the most informa

tive and interesting ones this year
in any sport. Joining Adam Fogel
son (the most professional and
articulate 'caster on the station's
hypothetical payroll) tonight is
Cardinal Graduate Assistant
Coach Craig Lauchner, while
women's volleyball Coach Don
Shaw will add color commentary
tomorrow.
As the saying says, check it out.
