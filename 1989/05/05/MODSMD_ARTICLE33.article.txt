# Slugger finds groove after slump
## 
### Bruce Sarkisian Senior staff writer 
In high school, Steve Solomon
was a first team All-State selec
tion twice. He hit .417 his senior
year of high school, finishing
with a career batting average of
.412 with 14 home runs and 43
stolen bases.
In his first 21 at-bats for
Stanford, Solomon got exactly
one hit.
"Getting that first hit was
really big," Solomon said. "I'm
not used to going 0-for-15. It
got to the point where, sure you
like to hit the ball hard every
time, but I would have taken a
cheap hit just as much."
Since his early-season woes,
Solomon has flourished at the
plate. In his last 23 games, he
is batting .317, raising his
average to .250 overall and .301
in Pacific 10 Southern Division
play.
What the coaches originally
wanted Solomon for was his de
fense. "He's a good defensive
ballplayer and he's got a great
arm for his size," fellow fresh
man David Holbrook said, the
Cardinal's everyday third base
man.
Defensively, Solomon has
lived up to his billing. He has
committed only two errors all
season and his strong arm has
gotten him five assists from the
outfield, the second most on the
team.
What the coaches did not ex
pect from Solomon was offense.
In fact, they spent a lot of time
with him, working with his
swing. All the hard work has
recently paid dividends. While
Solomon had power coming in
to Stanford, he has hit solidly
for average as well.
"One of the good things about
him is that he started out poorly
and he hung in there. They (the
coaches) were changing him
around a lot, but he's made the
adjustments real well,"
Holbrook said.
Solomon was injured for a
good portion of the fall, and for
him, the beginning of the season
meant getting adjusted once
again.
"I was behind on almost
everything. 1 was asking guys
the same questions over and
over again. I especially had to
learn situations and base run
ning techniques," Solomon said.
"Everyone could have gotten
sick of all my questions, but
they were patient with me," he
added.

This season has been the year
of the freshman for Stanford
baseball. At times there have
been as many as five of them
in the starting lineup. Holbrook,
shortstop Roger Burnett and
David McCarty have become
everyday players, while Solo
mon and catcher Troy Tall man
have been in the lineup more
often than not.
"I think we (the freshmen)
look out for each other. We hope
guvs do well because we know
we'll be together for four years,"
he said.
Walking into a new locker
room is never easy, hut for this
year's freshmen it was even
harder because each upperclass
man had at least one College
World Series ring on his hand.
However, the upperclassmen's
experience has been a plus for
many of the rookies.
"One of the things that is dif
ferent from my freshman year
is that the older guys have
mingled with and accepted the
younger guys right off the get,"
right fielder Paul Carey said.
At first, Solomon said, it was
hard to approach the upper
classmen because they had the
national championships to bond
them together. But after the
first two practices, any barrier

between the freshmen and up
perclassmen all but disappeared.
"I like to watch Frank and
Paul Carey. I really admire the
way they move on the field and
their attitude. It's a comfortable
feeling to know they have time
to talk to you," Solomon said.
Anyone who has been mired
in the throes of a batting slump
knows how physically and men
tally draining it can be, but
Solomon says that he tried to
feel comfortable even during his
slump.
"Mostly I've felt comfortable
up there, even when I wasn't
hitting. I always try to feel com
fortable, but I try and change
things when I'm not hitting,"
he said.
Before he became an All-Star,
Jose Canseco was notorious for
changing his batting stance
when he was slumping, some
times as often as every at bat
Solomon was not that drastic.
"There 11 be little things (that
I change), such as trying to wait
on the pitch a little better.
"1 also try to outguess the
pitcher. I'm a pretty good fast
ball hitter, and if I can guess
the pitch and location right, I'll
hit it well. I really haven't
guessed wrong too many times,"
Solomon said.
Solomon needs to be every bit
the mystic this weekend against
California, a team with a very
stingy pitching staff. The way he's
been hitting lately, however,
Solomon wouldn't earn such a bad
living in the circus as a fortune
teller.

Jack-of-all-trades Troy Paulsen

carries a six-game hitting streak into
this weekend's series. Paulsen has
started at second base, shortstop,
right field, left field and designated
hitter this season.
After being unproductive most of
the season, the occupiers of the
catcher position have done very well
of late. Kric Cox had his best game
of the year against Arizona, going 2-
for-3 with a home run, a double and
two RBI. Tallman, who has split time
with Cox at backstop this year was
2-for-3 with a home run, two RBI and
three runs scored in two games.

classmen because they had the
national championships to bond
them together. But after the
first two practices, any barrier

between the freshmen and up
perclassmen all but disappeared.
"I like to watch Frank and
Paul Carey. I really admire the
way they move on the field and
their attitude. It's a comfortable
feeling to know they have time
to talk to you," Solomon said.
Anyone who has been mired
in the throes of a batting slump
knows how physically and men
tally draining it can be, but
Solomon says that he tried to
feel comfortable even during his
slump.
"Mostly I've felt comfortable
up there, even when I wasn't
hitting. I always try to feel com
fortable, but I try and change
things when I'm not hitting,"
he said.
Before he became an All-Star,
Jose Canseco was notorious for
changing his batting stance
when he was slumping, some
times as often as every at bat
Solomon was not that drastic.
"There 11 be little things (that
I change), such as trying to wait
on the pitch a little better.
"1 also try to outguess the
pitcher. I'm a pretty good fast
ball hitter, and if I can guess
the pitch and location right, I'll
hit it well. I really haven't
guessed wrong too many times,"
Solomon said.
Solomon needs to be every bit
the mystic this weekend against
California, a team with a very
stingy pitching staff. The way he's
been hitting lately, however,
Solomon wouldn't earn such a bad
living in the circus as a fortune
teller.
Card notes
Jack-of-all-trades Troy Paulsen

carries a six-game hitting streak into
this weekend's series. Paulsen has
started at second base, shortstop,
right field, left field and designated
hitter this season.
After being unproductive most of
the season, the occupiers of the
catcher position have done very well
of late. Kric Cox had his best game
of the year against Arizona, going 2-
for-3 with a home run, a double and
two RBI. Tallman, who has split time
with Cox at backstop this year was
2-for-3 with a home run, two RBI and
three runs scored in two games.
In high school, Steve Solomon
was a first team All-State selec
tion twice. He hit .417 his senior
year of high school, finishing
with a career batting average of
.412 with 14 home runs and 43
stolen bases.
In his first 21 at-bats for
Stanford, Solomon got exactly
one hit.
"Getting that first hit was
really big," Solomon said. "I'm
not used to going 0-for-15. It
got to the point where, sure you
like to hit the ball hard every
time, but I would have taken a
cheap hit just as much."
Since his early-season woes,
Solomon has flourished at the
plate. In his last 23 games, he
is batting .317, raising his
average to .250 overall and .301
in Pacific 10 Southern Division
play.
What the coaches originally
wanted Solomon for was his de
fense. "He's a good defensive
ballplayer and he's got a great
arm for his size," fellow fresh
man David Holbrook said, the
Cardinal's everyday third base
man.
Defensively, Solomon has
lived up to his billing. He has
committed only two errors all
season and his strong arm has
gotten him five assists from the
outfield, the second most on the
team.
What the coaches did not ex
pect from Solomon was offense.
In fact, they spent a lot of time
with him, working with his
swing. All the hard work has
recently paid dividends. While
Solomon had power coming in
to Stanford, he has hit solidly
for average as well.
"One of the good things about
him is that he started out poorly
and he hung in there. They (the
coaches) were changing him
around a lot, but he's made the
adjustments real well,"
Holbrook said.
Solomon was injured for a
good portion of the fall, and for
him, the beginning of the season
meant getting adjusted once
again.
"I was behind on almost
everything. 1 was asking guys
the same questions over and
over again. I especially had to
learn situations and base run
ning techniques," Solomon said.
"Everyone could have gotten
sick of all my questions, but
they were patient with me," he
added.

This season has been the year
of the freshman for Stanford
baseball. At times there have
been as many as five of them
in the starting lineup. Holbrook,
shortstop Roger Burnett and
David McCarty have become
everyday players, while Solo
mon and catcher Troy Tall man
have been in the lineup more
often than not.
"I think we (the freshmen)
look out for each other. We hope
guvs do well because we know
we'll be together for four years,"
he said.
Walking into a new locker
room is never easy, hut for this
year's freshmen it was even
harder because each upperclass
man had at least one College
World Series ring on his hand.
However, the upperclassmen's
experience has been a plus for
many of the rookies.
"One of the things that is dif
ferent from my freshman year
is that the older guys have
mingled with and accepted the
younger guys right off the get,"
right fielder Paul Carey said.
At first, Solomon said, it was
hard to approach the upper
classmen because they had the
national championships to bond
them together. But after the
first two practices, any barrier
