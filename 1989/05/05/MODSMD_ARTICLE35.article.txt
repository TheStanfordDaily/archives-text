# Solomon wisely forgets NCAA woes

### Cameron Macky Senior staff writer 
The time is May 1988 You are
a 19-year-old freshman, playing
No. 6 singles for the top-ranked
college team in the country. You
have compiled a 14-4 dual-match
record for a team that has lost
once all year, and now, in the
NCA.A Championship finals, you
are facing Mike Hammett of
second-ranked lA)iusiana State.
Four of your teammates have
won their contests. If you defeat
Hammett, the match is over, and
the championship goes to your
school for the fifth time in nine
years. You have the chance to
clinch the NCAA title.
After winning the first set easi
ly, you almost wrap up the win
in a second-set tiebreaker, but
Hammett saves two match points
to force a third set. The third set,
too, ends up in a tiebreaker. Your
nerves start to act up. You have
to win. The team is counting on
you. This is the biggest match of
your life.
And you lose.
Of course, the Stanford men's
tennis team went on to win the
NCAA Championship last season,
with the doubles team of David
Wheaton and Jeff Tarango wrap
ping up the title only two minutes
after Glenn Solomon dropped a
heartbreaking 2-6, 7-6 (11-9), 7-6
(7-5) decision to Hammett. And

of course, Solomon was much too
busy celebrating the team victory
to worry about his missed oppor
tunity. Rut thoughts of that match
still came up over the summer.
"I would have thought about it
a hell of a lot more if we hadn't
pulled it (the team win) out,"
Solomon says. "I'm not going to
say I wouldn't have liked very
much to win that match, but
things turned out all right. Vic
tory was pretty damn sweet.
"It was a team effort, and I felt
I had been contributing to the
team," Solomon continues. "I was
part of a team that was the best
team in the country."
This year, Solomon is part of a
team that, according to the latest
Volvo/ITCA poll, is the second
best in the country. And, for some

reason, Solomon's fortune has
mirrored the success of the 1989
Cardinal squad.
Playing all but one match at
either the fourth or fifth spot,
Solomon has a 14-6 record this
year. One month ago, however, he
was 7-5 and reeling after several
tough losses. The Cardinal, too,
was going through tough times!
having dropped two matches on
the road against UCLA and USC.
Then came the California
match
When the two teams squared
off in Berkeley April 11, California
was ranked second in the nation

straight loss to a Pacific 10 Con
