# Solomon wisely forgets NCAA woes
## 
### Cameron Macky Senior staff writer 
The time is May 1988 You are
a 19-year-old freshman, playing
No. 6 singles for the top-ranked
college team in the country. You
have compiled a 14-4 dual-match
record for a team that has lost
once all year, and now, in the
NCA.A Championship finals, you
are facing Mike Hammett of
second-ranked lA)iusiana State.
Four of your teammates have
won their contests. If you defeat
Hammett, the match is over, and
the championship goes to your
school for the fifth time in nine
years. You have the chance to
clinch the NCAA title.
After winning the first set easi
ly, you almost wrap up the win
in a second-set tiebreaker, but
Hammett saves two match points
to force a third set. The third set,
too, ends up in a tiebreaker. Your
nerves start to act up. You have
to win. The team is counting on
you. This is the biggest match of
your life.
And you lose.
Of course, the Stanford men's
tennis team went on to win the
NCAA Championship last season,
with the doubles team of David
Wheaton and Jeff Tarango wrap
ping up the title only two minutes
after Glenn Solomon dropped a
heartbreaking 2-6, 7-6 (11-9), 7-6
(7-5) decision to Hammett. And

of course, Solomon was much too
busy celebrating the team victory
to worry about his missed oppor
tunity. Rut thoughts of that match
still came up over the summer.
"I would have thought about it
a hell of a lot more if we hadn't
pulled it (the team win) out,"
Solomon says. "I'm not going to
say I wouldn't have liked very
much to win that match, but
things turned out all right. Vic
tory was pretty damn sweet.
"It was a team effort, and I felt
I had been contributing to the
team," Solomon continues. "I was
part of a team that was the best
team in the country."
This year, Solomon is part of a
team that, according to the latest
Volvo/ITCA poll, is the second
best in the country. And, for some

reason, Solomon's fortune has
mirrored the success of the 1989
Cardinal squad.
Playing all but one match at
either the fourth or fifth spot,
Solomon has a 14-6 record this
year. One month ago, however, he
was 7-5 and reeling after several
tough losses. The Cardinal, too,
was going through tough times!

by Chang.
The win gave Stanford a 4-2
lead, which turned out to he just
enough. The Cardinal won 5-4,
and a new season had begun for
both Solomon and the team.
"That match meant a lot for
two reasons," Solomon says.
"First, I hadn't felt like 1 was
contributing to the team as much
as 1 should've been, because I'd
just lost a few tough matches.
"Second, I had been emphasiz
ing to myself during my mini
slump that I was playing pretty
well, and I was," he continues.
"Sometimes, the chips just don't
fall your way. It only took that
one match to make me feel on
top of the world, confidence-wise."
Solomon still hasn't left the top

demoralizing at best, and at worst
might have meant a move down
in the rankings.
Up 3-1, the Cardinal received a
shock when Harry Richards, play
ing at No. 6, suffered his first
(nnd still his only) loss of the year.
With all the other singles matches
over, all eyes turned to Solomon's
battle with Carl Chang.
Solomon was serving for the
match up 5-3 in the third set, but
Chang held off a match point to
break serve. After knotting the
score at five games each, though,
Chang blew a break point to fall
behind 6-5. Solomon then put the

of the world. Since the California
match, he is 7-1, the only loss
coming Tuesday against Pepper
dine's Christophe Van De Weghe.
The Cardinal, meanwhile, is 8-0
since then and is now ranked sec

ond in the country.
The only team ranked above the
Cardinal is UCLA, who came out
on the short end of a 5-2 decision
two weeks ago at Stanford Tennis
Stadium Solomon's opponent at

No. 5 that day was Billv Harbor,
who at 6-6 towered above the 5-8
Solomon.
"I felt I had nothing physically
to hurt him with, I was so little,"
Solomon savs. "It was just an up
hill battle."
That's putting it lightly. Barber
won the first set 6-3, Solomon
took the second 7-6, and promptly
dug himself a 4-0 hole in the third
set.
Solomon began to climb back,
breaking serve for 4-1 and then
holding. Barber went up 5-2 and
later served for the match at 5-3,
hut Solomon saved a match point
and broke Barber to get back on
serve.
The sellout crowd, which had
come alive during the comeback,
was ready to explode Solomon

saved another match point to
force a tiebreaker, and, after
taking a 6-3 lead, threw a serve
right down Barber's throat on
match point.
The standing ovation Solomon
received for his 3-6, 7-6, 7-6 win
was the first of his collegiate
career. "That's the most energy
I've felt, crowd-wise," Solomon
says."It was great for the team,
not just me."
It was easily Solomon's finest
performance of the year, and it
came during the team's biggest
match — so far — of the season,
If Solomon and the team keep
up their current level of play, he
just might get a shot at erasing
the memories of that match of a
year ago.

With all the other singles matches

battle with Carl Chang.

match, he is 7-1, the only loss
coming Tuesday against Pepper
dine's Christophe Van De Weghe.
The Cardinal, meanwhile, is 8-0
since then and is now ranked sec

ond in the country.
The only team ranked above the
Cardinal is UCLA, who came out
on the short end of a 5-2 decision
two weeks ago at Stanford Tennis
Stadium Solomon's opponent at

No. 5 that day was Billv Harbor,
who at 6-6 towered above the 5-8
Solomon.
"I felt I had nothing physically
to hurt him with, I was so little,"
Solomon savs. "It was just an up
hill battle."
That's putting it lightly. Barber
won the first set 6-3, Solomon
took the second 7-6, and promptly
dug himself a 4-0 hole in the third
set.
Solomon began to climb back,
breaking serve for 4-1 and then

come alive during the comeback,
was ready to explode Solomon

saved another match point to
force a tiebreaker, and, after
taking a 6-3 lead, threw a serve
right down Barber's throat on
match point.
The standing ovation Solomon
received for his 3-6, 7-6, 7-6 win
was the first of his collegiate
career. "That's the most energy
I've felt, crowd-wise," Solomon
says."It was great for the team,
not just me."
It was easily Solomon's finest
performance of the year, and it
came during the team's biggest
match — so far — of the season,
If Solomon and the team keep
up their current level of play, he
just might get a shot at erasing
the memories of that match of a
year ago.
The time is May 1988 You are
a 19-year-old freshman, playing
No. 6 singles for the top-ranked
college team in the country. You
have compiled a 14-4 dual-match
record for a team that has lost
once all year, and now, in the
NCA.A Championship finals, you
are facing Mike Hammett of
second-ranked lA)iusiana State.
Four of your teammates have
won their contests. If you defeat
Hammett, the match is over, and
the championship goes to your
school for the fifth time in nine
years. You have the chance to
clinch the NCAA title.
After winning the first set easi
ly, you almost wrap up the win
in a second-set tiebreaker, but
Hammett saves two match points
to force a third set. The third set,
too, ends up in a tiebreaker. Your
nerves start to act up. You have
to win. The team is counting on
you. This is the biggest match of
your life.
And you lose.
Of course, the Stanford men's
tennis team went on to win the
NCAA Championship last season,
with the doubles team of David
Wheaton and Jeff Tarango wrap
ping up the title only two minutes
after Glenn Solomon dropped a
heartbreaking 2-6, 7-6 (11-9), 7-6
(7-5) decision to Hammett. And

of course, Solomon was much too
busy celebrating the team victory
to worry about his missed oppor
tunity. Rut thoughts of that match
still came up over the summer.
"I would have thought about it
a hell of a lot more if we hadn't
pulled it (the team win) out,"
Solomon says. "I'm not going to
say I wouldn't have liked very
much to win that match, but
things turned out all right. Vic
tory was pretty damn sweet.
"It was a team effort, and I felt
I had been contributing to the
team," Solomon continues. "I was
part of a team that was the best
team in the country."
This year, Solomon is part of a
team that, according to the latest
Volvo/ITCA poll, is the second
best in the country. And, for some

reason, Solomon's fortune has
mirrored the success of the 1989
Cardinal squad.
Playing all but one match at
either the fourth or fifth spot,
Solomon has a 14-6 record this

just lost a few tough matches.
"Second, I had been emphasiz
