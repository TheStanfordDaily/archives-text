# Water polo's top teams visit deGuerre Pool
## 
### Tyson Vaughan 
Stanford men's water polo
Coach Dante Dettamanti is going
to be busy this weekend. Several
of the coach's teams will be com
peting in a water polo triple
header this weekend at deGuerre.
Several?
Several. Not only will Det
tamanti be coaching the Stanford
men's water polo team tomorrow,
he is the- assistant coach of the
United States National Team —
actually it's two teams, the A and
B teams. He will be wearing both
hats tomorrow afternoon as the
three teams will be taking on Cal
ifornia, Cuba and Mexico, respec
tively.
Wait a minute. Water polo is a
fall sport, right?
Sort of. At least the fall season
is the only one the NCAA cares
about. Perhaps less known is the
spring-summer season, complete
with its own state and national
level championships, played by
club teams. Although these teams
are not officially sponsored by

schools, they usually contain more
or less the same lineup as the
varsity teams.
The major personnel difference
is the occasional addition of
players from outside the Univer
sity. Players from the immediate
area and even as far away as
Brown university have partici
pated on Stanford's club team,
Dettamanti said. "This team is
open to virtually anybody," he
said.
However, aside from the season
and the appellation "club team,"
the Stanford-California matchup
should not be much different from
an "official" varsity game. Which
means vicious, ferocious, stop-at
nothing, take-no-prisoners water
polo.
The rivalry between the Cardi
nal and Bear squads is undoubt
edly one of the greatest in the
history of intercollegiate sports.
Of the past 16 NCAA men's water
polo titles, 14 of them have been
claimed by one of the two cross-
Bay rivals. Add to this the usual
hatred between the schools, plus

the fact that Stanford's coach is
from northern Italy while Califor
nia's is from Sicily, and you have
the makings for a very intense
rivalry, indeed.
Dettamanti calls tomorrow's
battle a "preview of the 1989
NCAA Championship." California
is the defending champion, while
the young Stanford team finished
fourth last fall. Dettamanti is ob
viously quite confident in his
team, not to mention the fact that
the Bears are graduating some
key players while the Cardinal re
mains essentially intact. In any
case, this one shouldn't be missed.
Immediately following the
Card-Bear contest, the U.S. B
team, featuring current Cardinal
players Jon Swerdloff and Eric
Blum, will take on Mexico. "Not
a very strong team," Dettamanti
said of Mexico. Look for a U.S.
win here.
Finally, the really big matchup,
as far as the rest of the world is
concerned, is the U.S. vs. Cuba
game. This is more than an ide
ological or political rivalry. The

Cubans have for some time now
been forced to settle for second
best in the Americas. They were
silver medalists in the last Pan
Am Games, and are currently
ranked among the top eight teams
in the world.
The United States is the team
that beat the Cubans in the Pan
Am finals and won the silver
medal in the '84 and '88 Olympics.
It might appear from this that
the U.S. has a slight edge, but on
the other hand, of the '88 silver
medal-winning squad, only three
remain, and one of those was a
back-up. It is a young team.
Also, the Cubans boycotted the
'88 Olympic Games, and it is Det
tamanti's opinion that they should
be ranked at least sixth in the
world. They will be looking to
avenge their Pan Am loss tomor
row.
The game should be a tight one,
with the winner taking it by no
more than a point. The U.S.
Team, although young, is de
scribed by Dettamanti as "quick
and very talented" and should be
boosted by its strong performance
recently at the Paris Invitational,
where it finished fourth, over
fifth-ranked Spain and only one
point behind third-ranked Hun
gary.
The team features Stanford
alums Craig Klass, the 1986
NCAA Player of the Year and one
of those who brought home the
silver in '88, and Erich Fischer,
a two-time Ail-American. In ad
dition, two current Stanford team
members will be playing for the
U.S., Todd Kemp and Rick
McNair.
As expected, California is also
well-represented, with three
former or present Bears on the
national team, including 1988
NCAA Player of the Year Kirk
Everist.
For the mere pittance of $3.00
with a Stanford University I.D.
(and for kids) or the still quite
affordable $5.00 without, you can
see some of the best, most exciting
water polo action in the world
tomorrow, at a pool near you.
Stanford vs. California is at
2:00 p.m., with U.S. vs. Mexico
and U.S. vs. Cuba following at
3:30 and 5:00 respectively.
