# Crew teams split with Cal
## 
### Andrew Wilcox Staff writer 
The crew version of the
Stanford-California rivalry was
renewed last Saturday at Red
wood Shores, and this edition
also ended in a tie of sorts as
both teams' varsity boats cap
tured one victory.
The Cardinal women vaulted
into first place in the Pacific
10 Conference with a convinc
ing 4.5 second victory over the
Golden Bears, who previously
held the conference lead.
The men did not fare quite
as well, suffering a heartbreak
ing loss by less than one sec
ond.
The women's eight rowed an
impressive race, burning up the
course in a time of 6:30.1, a
mark which missed the Red
wood Shores record by 1.2
seconds.
The key to the race, as is
often the case in crew, was the
first 500 meters. Stanford an
ticipated California's strategy
of trying to gain an early lead
and had worked on perfecting
their start, Coach John Davis
said.
The practice paid off, as the
Cardinal opened strong and
gained a slight edge at the cri
tical 500-meter mark. This
lead, which they never relin
quished, gave Stanford a psy
chological advantage for the
race's latter portions, Davis
said.
However, just when it
seemed Stanford had settled
into a comfortable groove,
near-disaster struck as the
coxswain's voice gave out.
Without the coxswain in com

mand, shouting out instruc
tions, the Cardinal boat lost
some of the rhythm it had es
tablished, but the Stanford
rowers shifted to a higher gear
and pulled harder to make up
for the loss.
"It was a scary moment but
the kids had enough poise not
to panic without that commu
nication," Davis said.
Entering the race, Stanford
was ranked fourth in the con
ference by virtue of their losses
to California, Washington and
UCLA earlier in the season.
This win gives the Cardinal the
top seed in the Pac-10 champi
onships May 13-14 in
Sacramento. The women have
a chance to sweep both the var
sity and junior varsity league
title for the first time ever.
The men's eight, although
they lost to a crew they had
beaten twice earlier in the year,
turned in one of their strongest
performances of the year. The
Stanford time of 5:45.3, which
was aided by a tailwind, topped
their previous fastest mark this
season by seven seconds.
The Cardinal men opened up
with what coach Ken Drey fuss
called "our best first 1,000
meters of the season," which
gave them a small cushion at
the race's half-way point.
However, as has often been
the case this year, the Stanford
men faltered in the next 500
meters. The California boat
moved into the lead by several
feet, a margin to which they
clung the rest of the way.
Drey fuss attributed the fall
off to lineup uncertainties in
the week preceding the race.
