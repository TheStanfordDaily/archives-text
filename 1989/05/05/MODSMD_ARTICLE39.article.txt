# The 						Whitlingers, Stanford's twin Ail-Americans, are irrefutably
## Double Faultless 
### 
Tami and leri Whitlinger are two o! the top players in college tennis and they're twin
sisters as well.
Both are sophomores and All-Americans â€” and Stanford's hopes for a fourth-straight
NCAA championship rest squarely on their more-than-capable shoulders.
The Whitlingers are from Neenah, Wis., and have been playing tennis for most of their lives.
leri is considered the team s best athlete; Tami is regarded as the nation's best player.
