# Tami looks toward pro career
## 
### Mark Rogowsky Editorial staff 
For Tami Whitlinger, the future
is now. Or at least very soon.
Tami, the top-ranked player in
collegiate women's tennis, has
decided almost for certain to turn
professional at the end of the year.
"Right now, I'm ready to go out
and do it," she says, noting that
she made a list of pros and cons
— and the pros, in both senses
of the word, won out.
"To me, it's very important to
turn pro when you're feeling
good," Tami says. "It's destruc
tive when you do it because you
feel you have to."
The way she's played this year
certainly has influenced her deci
sion. Tami has lost a grand total
of one match in dual-meet com
petition — she can avenge that
defeat today if she beats Califor
nia's Karen Shin — while winning
18.
Coach Frank Brennan says he
once thought that athleticism was
Tami's greatest strength as a ten
nis player. Today, though, he
thinks its her focus and concen
tration. "Tami is very, very men
tally tough," Brennan says.
Tami seconds the notion. "I
have a fighter instinct about me,"
she says. "I'm very competitive
when I go out to play. I don't like
to lose."
But Tami, when it looks hope
less, don't you ever just let up —
even a little?
"I find that in a lot of matches
I play ... no matter what the
score is, 1 believe I can come
back," she says.
"I just start playing point by
point and forget about the score,"
Tami adds.
That strategy provided the
highlight of Tami's stellar season
early in April. Trailing USC's
Trisha Laux 5-1 in the third set
at Los Angeles, Tami went on to
mount a thrilling comeback.
At that point in the match, and
all throughout it for that matter,
Tami felt so sick from the stomach
flu that she nearly had to default.

Somehow, she was able to focus
on the task at hand and suddenly
began to rip off winner after win
ner. Laux began to feel the pres
sure and Tami ended up winning
the unforgettable match in a tie
breaker.
Tami will need to display that
kind of toughness all the time to
make it on the pro circuit. Given
that, one is naturally led to
wonder why she doesn't wait a
while.
"We all can all say: 'A Stanford
education . . . you're going to give
that up' " Brennan notes. Hut he
points out "it's a personal deci
sion" and Tami has to do what
she thinks is best.
Unfortunately, it's impossible
to know for sure what is best, as
those who've preceded Tami can
attest.
Brennan says that when Alycia
Moulton came here, "[She] was
staying for four years. Period."
That decision, he adds, allowed
her to go though her college career
free from constantly worrying
about whether she was doing the
right thing.
The "flip side" was Elise Bur
gin. "She listened to everyone
talking to her (about going pro)
. . . and drove herself and me
slightly crazy for the next two
years," Brennan says. "Some of
the joy (of being here) was lost."
Patty Fendick, Class of'B7, took
a middle road, says Brennan. She
decided to come for two years —
definitely. Then, after her sopho
more year, she planned on making
a second definitive decision for
the next two years.
Fendick, of course, stayed at
Stanford and went on to win back
to-back NCAA singles titles. Cur
rently, she is ranked around 20th
in the world. In Fendick's case,
everything clearly worked out for
the best.
Tami said she was hoping to
talk to Fendick about her decision
but hadn't yet gotten the chance.
She has, however, talked to the
members of her family about
turning pro.
Tami says among her parents'

greatest concerns is that leaving
Stanford will take her away from
her twin sister Teri. The two have
been through everything together
for as long as they've been on the
planet.
Yet, while Tami admits the
prospect of not having Teri
around is frightening, she thinks
both of them are prepared for it.
"We've always known there was
going to come a time when we
were going to have to go different
ways," Tami says.
In order to get used to being
apart, the two haven't lived in the
same place while they've been at
Stanford. Still, both agree they're
as close as ever and they seem
able to offer something to each
other that no one else can.
For example, when Tami is
struggling in a match, just a few
words from Teri can magically
turn things around. Says Tami:
"You tend to look at someone close
to you for help (when things aren't
going right)." More often than
not, Teri has provided that help
for Tami — and vice versa.
"I gain strength from her just
like she gains strength from me,"
Teri says.
Right now, both Tami and Teri
Whitlinger have their sights set
on the NCAAs. Later this month,
the Cardinal will be making a bid
for an unprecedented fourth
straight NCAA title — and Tami
Whitlinger will be leading the way.
After that, she said she will
probably announce her decision
to begin her professional career.
For his part, Brennan wishes
her nothing but the best. "Tami
has been teriffic," he says. "She's
been a teriffic team player and a
teriffic competitor."
Brennan adds that she has been
"great to be around" and always
"up front and honest" about her
plans.
The one thing that is certain,
however, is when Tami Whitlinger
does leave she will be remembered
along with Moulton, Burgin and
Fendick as some of the great ones
to have played tennis at Stanford.
At least for the foreseeable future.
