# Teri's star continues to shine
## 
### Mark Rogowsky Editorial staff 
Teri Whitlinger is a great ath
lete and a great tennis player. She
is a key cog in the No. 1-ranked
Stanford Cardinal machine. Given
her abilities and accomplishments,
it would seem that she'd be recog
nized simply for being herself.
But Teri Whitlinger happens to
have a sister named Tami — and
no one ever lets her forget it.
You see, Tami is the top-rated
player in the country while Teri
is merely in the top 10. When
they are on the same side of the
court, they combine to form the
best doubles team in the country.
When they are on opposite sides
of the court, Tami always wins
— always.
The record books say the
longest winning streak in sports
belongs to the United States for
holding the America's Cup for well
over a century. Hut while chal
lengers only got a shot at the cup
every few years, Teri has gotten
her chance at Tami countless
times in the past decade.
And she's come up empty.
Rut if you think Teri is jealous,
or somehow negatively affected by
all this, you just don't know Teri
Whitlinger. "1 kind of lived in
Tami's shadow for a while," Teri
says. "We pretty much did every
thing the same."
Things began to change while
the Whitlingers were in high
school, Teri says. "We shared the
same friends, but we also had dif
ferent friends.
"1 became my own person . . ,
and my tennis really improved
too," Teri adds.
Today, her tennis is very good,
indeed. While Tami is dominant
as the Cardinal's No. 1 player,
Teri is just as dominant playing
at No. 5. She has compiled a 20-1
dual-match record this season.
"At times, I've worried about
playing No. 5," Teri says, explain
ing she was concerned about not
playing top-notch competitors.
Now, she realizes it's been good
for her
"It (her success at No. 5) has
{riven me confidence and I've been

able to work on some things," she
says.
Of course, Teri would be playing
much higher than No. 5 were it
not for the fact the Cardinal is
loaded with stars. Such a situation
might be expected to produce a
clash of egos, but Teri says that's
not the case here.
"We don't let each other get big
heads," she says.
Teri adds that the early-season
challenge matches used to deter
mined the lineup were a little hard
emotionally. But once they were
done, everyone settled into their
position and things have been
smooth since.
"We're all out there to win for
ourselves, but also for the team,"
she says. "It's definitely fun when
you have so much respect for
every person on the team.
"We feel like we can win every
match in singles — that's a good
feeling."
Basically, Teri says "We're all
pretty even lin ability). On any
given day, I think we can beat
each other," Teri adds.
But you haven't beaten Tami
in a long, long time, Teri.
"It's kind of funny now," she
says, appearing completely unaf
fected by The Streak. "I think
our matches have gotten better
. . . it's pretty much mental."
Tami concurs. "There was a

time when I was definitely better
than she was — but then she
closed the gap." Even after im
proving, though, "We'd go out to
play and she'd say 'I'm going to
lose.' "
Says Teri: "I'm almost afraid
to beat her. I think I worry too
much about how it would affect
her."
Though they don't play each
other much these days, Teri fig
ures she'll get at least a few
chances when the two both make
their way onto the pro circuit.
She says jokingly that maybe
when there's money on the line
things will turn out differently.
Fortunately for Teri Whitlinger,
though, even if she never beats
her sister in a tennis match, she
seems certain to go far.
"Teri excels at other things be
sides tennis," Coach Frank Bren
nan is quick to point out. He says
she's not as single-minded as her
sister, citing her interests in ac
ademics and her sorority as just
some of her other concerns.
And Brennan believes that her
multifaceted lifestyle will help her
deal with not having Tami around
— should she turn pro.
"Teri has so many things going
on for her at Stanford," Brennan
says. "She'll get caught right up
in it.
"I'm not worried about it. I
think it will be great for her," he
adds.
For her own part, Teri says
she's a bit worried. "Things are
so natural I between us]. I can tell
her anything. I'll definitely feel
sad."
In the meantime, Teri is pretty
happy about things. She says even
though things are tougher
academically this year than they
were last year, she still loves being
at Stanford.
"I really enjoy the people (and)
the weather," adds the Neenah.

says.
Of course, Teri would be playing
much higher than No. 5 were it
not for the fact the Cardinal is
loaded with stars. Such a situation
might be expected to produce a
clash of egos, but Teri says that's
not the case here.
"We don't let each other get big
heads," she says.
Teri adds that the early-season
challenge matches used to deter
mined the lineup were a little hard
emotionally. But once they were
done, everyone settled into their
position and things have been
smooth since.
"We're all out there to win for
ourselves, but also for the team,"
she says. "It's definitely fun when
you have so much respect for
every person on the team.
"We feel like we can win every
match in singles — that's a good
feeling."
Basically, Teri says "We're all
pretty even lin ability). On any
given day, I think we can beat
each other," Teri adds.
But you haven't beaten Tami
in a long, long time, Teri.
"It's kind of funny now," she
says, appearing completely unaf
fected by The Streak. "I think
our matches have gotten better
. . . it's pretty much mental."
Tami concurs. "There was a

time when I was definitely better
than she was — but then she
closed the gap." Even after im
proving, though, "We'd go out to
play and she'd say 'I'm going to
lose.' "
Says Teri: "I'm almost afraid
to beat her. I think I worry too
much about how it would affect
her."
Though they don't play each
other much these days, Teri fig
ures she'll get at least a few
chances when the two both make
their way onto the pro circuit.
She says jokingly that maybe
when there's money on the line
things will turn out differently.
Fortunately for Teri Whitlinger,
though, even if she never beats
her sister in a tennis match, she
seems certain to go far.
"Teri excels at other things be
sides tennis," Coach Frank Bren
nan is quick to point out. He says
she's not as single-minded as her
sister, citing her interests in ac
ademics and her sorority as just
some of her other concerns.
And Brennan believes that her
multifaceted lifestyle will help her
deal with not having Tami around
— should she turn pro.
"Teri has so many things going
on for her at Stanford," Brennan
says. "She'll get caught right up
in it.
"I'm not worried about it. I
think it will be great for her," he
adds.
For her own part, Teri says
she's a bit worried. "Things are
so natural I between us]. I can tell
her anything. I'll definitely feel
sad."
In the meantime, Teri is pretty
happy about things. She says even
though things are tougher
academically this year than they
were last year, she still loves being
at Stanford.

Sophomore Tami Whitlinger is 18-1 in dual-match play this season for the Cardinal. Carrying the
nation's No. 1 ranking, Whitlinger is considered a favorite to capture the NCAA singles title in
Gainesville, Fla. later this month.

A queen on the court
All-American Teri Whitlinger has been virtually unstoppable this season. Widely regarded as the best
athlete on the women's tennis team, Whitlinger is 20-1 in dual matches this year.
Teri Whitlinger is a great ath
lete and a great tennis player. She
is a key cog in the No. 1-ranked
Stanford Cardinal machine. Given
her abilities and accomplishments,
it would seem that she'd be recog
nized simply for being herself.
But Teri Whitlinger happens to
have a sister named Tami — and
no one ever lets her forget it.
You see, Tami is the top-rated
player in the country while Teri
is merely in the top 10. When
they are on the same side of the
court, they combine to form the
best doubles team in the country.
When they are on opposite sides
of the court, Tami always wins
— always.
The record books say the
longest winning streak in sports
belongs to the United States for
holding the America's Cup for well
over a century. Hut while chal
lengers only got a shot at the cup
every few years, Teri has gotten
her chance at Tami countless
times in the past decade.
And she's come up empty.
Rut if you think Teri is jealous,
or somehow negatively affected by
all this, you just don't know Teri
Whitlinger. "1 kind of lived in
Tami's shadow for a while," Teri
says. "We pretty much did every
thing the same."
Things began to change while
the Whitlingers were in high
school, Teri says. "We shared the
same friends, but we also had dif
ferent friends.
"1 became my own person . . ,
and my tennis really improved
too," Teri adds.
Today, her tennis is very good,
indeed. While Tami is dominant
as the Cardinal's No. 1 player,
Teri is just as dominant playing
at No. 5. She has compiled a 20-1
dual-match record this season.
"At times, I've worried about
playing No. 5," Teri says, explain
ing she was concerned about not
playing top-notch competitors.
Now, she realizes it's been good
for her
"It (her success at No. 5) has
{riven me confidence and I've been

able to work on some things," she
says.
Of course, Teri would be playing
much higher than No. 5 were it
not for the fact the Cardinal is
