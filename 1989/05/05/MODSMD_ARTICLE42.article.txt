# Which Whit is which?
## 
### 
Since they are identical
twins, Tami and Teri Whit
linger are often treated as if
they are one in the same.
This creates a couple of prob
lems. First, while they are very
clpse, the two prefer to be
treated as individuals. Second,
if you don't know them, it can
be very difficult telling them
apart.
The following is an attempt
to resolve that problem:
Tami has the lighter hair —
more of a bleached-blond look
— and has bangs that come
straight down her forehead.

She wears her hear in a banana
clip.
Teri's hair is parted in the
middle and she wears a
ponytail.
Tami's face is rounder, while
Teri's is longer.
Teri is the more outgoing of
the two. This can be deceiving,
though, since both are very
friendly. Be careful when using
the "outgoing" test.
If all else fails, flip a coin. If
you guess wrong, they'll forgive
you — it's happened to them
at least a million times before.
