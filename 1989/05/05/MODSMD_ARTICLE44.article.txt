Crew merits better coverage
Stanford crew teams have consistently
ranked among the top three teams in the
Pacific Coast Conference. Stanford stu
dents would never know it from The Daily's
coverage of the sport.
I was very disappointed to see absolutely
no mention of the crew's performance in
The Big Row in the Monday, May 1 edition.
Despite resounding victory by the women's
crew and official confirmation of its second
in-the-nation standing, The Daily failed to
provide the prompt reporting the event
deserved.
Even Evan Tuchinsky's surprise dis
covery in his April 28 column that five
women have qualified for national team
tryouts was evidently not enough to spur
a reporter to attend the weekend regatta.
Contrary to a myth that The Daily is
helping to perpetuate, most rowers are not
masochistic eccentrics who prefer
anonymity to public recognition of their
efforts and achievements. They are varsity
athletes competing on the West Coast in
a sport that has traditionally been
dominated by East Coast powers and a lot
of East Coast supporters.

On the whole, your point is well-stated and
well-taken. Crew, along with several other
sports, have seemingly slipped through the
cracks this spring.
In this instance, at least, it was merely
a case of waylaid plans. Space was rela
tively restricted in Monday's issue due to
the large number of events which transpired
last weekend, including men's volleyball at
the NCAA West Regional Selection Tour
nament, baseball playing an important se
ries with Arizona and both tennis teams
at the Pac-10 individual championships.
In order to provide adequate coverage
for all the sports — crew included — a
decision was reached to delay publication
of the crew results until the following day.
Unfortunately, that printing never hap

pened, due to an oversight.
Mistakes happen, even at the most inop
portune times. The article has been pub
lished today (see page 8), but the sports
staff is well aware that this is far too
distant from the event to constitute satis
factory coverage.
Women's golf deserves
the community's support
We, the women's golf team, would like
to thank you for the print you so generously
granted us in The Daily on Tuesday, May
2 in Jon Weisman's article. We're proud
to be a part of Stanford varsity sports, and
are proud that our other varsity teams are
ranked nationally.
But Jon forgot we are presently ranked
10th in the nation in Division I. Addition
ally, he forgot that being a young team
comprised of four freshmen, three sopho
mores and one junior, we're proud of that
ranking because we are the highest ranked
young team in the nation.
Our national championship is fast ap
proaching, and we have been preparing all
year for that week of May 24-27. In order
to gain a berth in these championships,
we have dedicated ourselves to one of the
most time-consuming schedules of all var
sity sports at Stanford. Our season runs
from September until May with daily prac
tice from 1:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. We have
already competed in nine tournaments, a
schedule which requires us to travel ap
proximately 40 days, 20 of those days being
school days.
For all of those who are interested in
the stadium effect which makes spectating
exciting, you are more than welcome to sit
around the 18th green and cheer us on as
we finish our rounds. Golf can have cheer
ing sections, too. We invite any one inter
ested to join us for The California Inter
collegiate on Sunday, May 7 and Monday
May 8 and then the NCAA Women's Golf
Championships May 24 to 28.

golfer, we are not going to give up.
