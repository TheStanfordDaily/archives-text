# June Daughery named coach of Boise State
## 
### Evan Tuchinsky Senior staff writer 
Parting is such sweet sorrow. After helping
Stanford women's basketball Coach Tara Van-
Derveer build the Cardinal into a national
contender, Asst. Coach June Daugherty will
not be around to savor the fruits of her labor.
In a surprisingly rapid hiring, Daugherty
was named head coach of the team at Boise
State earlier this week, just two days after
interviewing for the position. She has already
begun her duties.
"1 think it's a great opportunity, and I'm
really excited for her," VanDerveer said. "It's
a compliment to her and the hard work she's
done.
"It will be fun for her. She'll get to do it
her own way, and that's what's fun about
being a head coach."
In her four years on the Farm as one of
VanDerveer's three assistants, Daugherty con
centrated on coaching the post players, «long
with scouting potential recruits and overseeing
team promotions. In her final two seasons,
the Cardinal was 55-8 overall, earned two con
secutive Midwest Regional berths and finished
in the upper echelon of the Pacific 10 Con
ference.
A nationwide search will begin immediately
for Daugherty's replacement at Stanford, but
VanDerveer does not foresee much difficulty
in finding a worthy replacement.
"There are a lot of people who would like
to work here," VanDerveer said. "It's a very
attractive job. The biggest plus is working
with an outstanding team, a team that is a
step away from the Final Four."
In the meanwhile, Asst. Coach Julie Plank
will increase her duties from part-time to full
time assistant. The team's chief scout, Plank
has concentrated her coaching on the Cardi
nal's guards, helping mold what is generally
considered the best backcourt in the West.
Practically a full-time coach already in terms
of workload, she has been an integral part of
VanDerveer's staff for all four years on the
Farm.
