# Cagers named to national teams
## 
### Evan Tuchinsky Senior staff writer 
While most of the college wom
en's basketball world is on a
spring hiatus, seven Stanford
players have only begun to com
pete.
Capping off the finest season
in Cardinal history, seven mem
bers of the NCAA regional finalist
Stanford team have been selected
for national team play. Four —
sophomore Celeste Lavoie, fresh
men Martha Richards and Chris
MacMurdo, and incoming fresh
man Val Whiting — have been
named to various squads for the
U.S. Olympic Festival, while three
other Cardinal cagers — sopho
mores Trisha Stevens and Sonja
Henning, and freshman Julie
Zeilstra — have been named
finalists for the U.S. Junior Na
tional Team.
As if that was not enough, in
coming freshman Molly Gooden
bour was selected as one of four
girls basketball players on the
AAU/Milky Way All-America
Team.
The honors are certainly fitting
considering the Cardinal's play
this season. Finishing with a '28-3
overall record, the team became
the first Pacific 10 Conference
champion to win every league
game. The squad also set 52
school, Pac-10 and NCAA Tourna
ment records.
With almost half of the team
chosen to compete over the sum
mer, Stanford's success will only
improve.
"I'm very happy for all of our
players who will be competing in
the summer," Stanford Coach
Tara VanDerveer said. "It will be
like a Stanford mini-reunion when
we compete in Oklahoma City. I
can't imagine another school
having more representation at the

Olympic Festival."
Current teammates Lavoie,
MacMurdo and Richards will
remain as such when they com
pete for the West Squad at the
Olympic Festival. Whiting, a na
tive of Wilmington, Del., will join
the East Squad.
If for some reason Henning,
Stevens or Zeilstra does not make
the Junior National Team, a spot
will be waiting on one of the four
Olympic Festival teams.
For Henning and Stevens, at
least, this contingency is quite un
likely. Henning was the quiet hero
for most of Stanford's season,
blending with Kodak Ail-
American off-guard Jennifer Azzi
to form perhaps the most feared
backcourt in the country.
Stevens, who scored a regional
high 31 points against lowa in
the Midwest Regional semifinal
game, has been virtually unstop
pable for most of the year. On
the block, only a select few man
aged to counteract her strong post
moves.
Cioodenbour was not tapped to
play in the Olympic Festival but
received an honor equally as dis
tinctive. A team of four high
school boys and four high school
girls, the AAU/Milky Way All-
America Team acknowleges all
around individuals in much the
same manner as the Wooden
Award does in collegiate men's
basketball.
The criteria for selection in
clude an outstanding academic
record, excellent athletic perform
ance and highly-commendable
community service.
Goodenbour, from Waterloo,
lowa, has maintained a 4.0 GPA
at Waterloo High School, where
she averaged 18 points per game
this past season as point guard.
For her achievements, she was
named Gatorade Player of the
Year for her state and region.
