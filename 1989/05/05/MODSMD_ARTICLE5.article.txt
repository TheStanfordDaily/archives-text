# Committee proposes new distribution requirement
## 
### Ken Yew Staff writer 
Stanford's distribution requirements
may be substantially restructured under a
plan revealed last night which would re
quire students to study ethnic and gender
issues.
At a public forum, the Subcommittee on
Distribution Requirements — influenced
partly by the recent University Committee
on Minority Issues recommendation to add
a distribution requirement focusing on eth
nic studies — outlined three options that
would consolidate existing DRs and add
new ones.
Subcommittee members emphasized that
none of the option.s include more than nine
distribution requirements.
The first option would add a DR called
"World Cultures'' which would include
those courses focusing on non-Western cul
tures "in their own terms rather than

against the background of North Atlantic
culture" or their contributions to America.
This option would also add another DR
called "Contemporary Social Issues" focus
ing on a wide range of issues relevant to
modern society, "from war and peace to
the environment," said Education Prof.
Martin Carnoy, committee chair.
According to Carnoy, the first option does
not require a course in gender studies, as
does the third option.
To compensate for adding two new DRs,
the first option would combine four of the
humanities DRs into two. The proposal
would merge current DRs Two and Three
into the heading "Humanities/Fine Arts"
and Four and Five into "Social Sciences."
The second option would simply add a
"World Cultures" DR for a total of nine,
but would allow students to count the Cul
tures, Ideas and Values sequence for one
of DRs Three through Nine. For
example, a student completing the
History CIV sequence could also
count the course for DR Four.
The third option is perhaps the
most ambitious and the strongest
on gender studies. It calls for an
interim set of requirements, com
bining humanities DRs Two
thrugh Five, as in the first option,
and adding "World Cultures" and
"Ethnic and/or Gender Studies,"
for a total of eight DRs.
By Autumn of 1993, the "Eth
nic and/or Gender Studies" DR
would be replaced by an "Ethnic
Studies" requirement and a fur
ther condition that at least one
of the eight DRs "must give sub
stantial treatment to issues of
gender."
All students currently enrolled
would not be affected by any of
the options, as they are required
to follow the DRs listed during
their entering year.
Committee members said there
is no consensus about which of

the three proposed options to
choose. After the members make
a final decision next fall, they will
give a report to the Committee
on Undergraduate Studies, which
will then present its own recom
mendations to the Faculty Senate
for a final vote.
If last year's experience with
the Area One Task Force holds
true, the CUS will substantially
revise the subcommittee's recom
mendations before presenting
them to the Faculty Senate, said
Dean of Undergraduate Studies
Thomas Wasow, an ex-officio
member of the subcommittee.
Last year the Area One Task
Force assigned to re-evaluate
Western Culture submitted a
report to the CUS, which then
substantially changed their rec
ommendations, Wasow said.
Feminist Studios chair Sylvia
Yanagisako said the subcommit
tee's recommendations will prob
ably require the University to
spend more money to hire profes
sors with ethnic and gender
studies expertise. "There are not
enough faculty now to incorporate
these studies into the curricu
lum," she said.
