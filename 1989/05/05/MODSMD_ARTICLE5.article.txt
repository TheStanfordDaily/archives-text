### Ken Yew Staff writer 
Stanford's distribution requirements
may be substantially restructured under a
plan revealed last night which would re
quire students to study ethnic and gender
issues.
At a public forum, the Subcommittee on
Distribution Requirements — influenced
partly by the recent University Committee
on Minority Issues recommendation to add
a distribution requirement focusing on eth
nic studies — outlined three options that
would consolidate existing DRs and add
new ones.
Subcommittee members emphasized that
none of the option.s include more than nine
distribution requirements.
The first option would add a DR called
"World Cultures'' which would include
those courses focusing on non-Western cul
tures "in their own terms rather than

against the background of North Atlantic
culture" or their contributions to America.
This option would also add another DR
called "Contemporary Social Issues" focus
ing on a wide range of issues relevant to
modern society, "from war and peace to
the environment," said Education Prof.
Martin Carnoy, committee chair.
According to Carnoy, the first option does
not require a course in gender studies, as
does the third option.
To compensate for adding two new DRs,
the first option would combine four of the
humanities DRs into two. The proposal
would merge current DRs Two and Three
into the heading "Humanities/Fine Arts"
and Four and Five into "Social Sciences."
The second option would simply add a
"World Cultures" DR for a total of nine,
but would allow students to count the Cul
tures, Ideas and Values sequence for one
