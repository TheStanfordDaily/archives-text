### Baldwin Lee Staff writer 
Members of the two Council
of Presidents slates disagreed
last night on the effect of the
low voter turnout for the
runoff election.
The Slate of the Times, spon
sored by the People's Platform,
was winning the election with
95 percent of votes tabulated
at 11 p.m. last night, leading
Students' Choice 54.9 percent
to 45.1 percent. Students'
Choice ran under of the auspi
ces of the Students First party.
With 95 percent of the
results in, approximately 2,700
students had voted. 6,500 stu
dents voted in the ASSU Gen
eral Election held two weeks
ago, setting an election record
for voter turnout.

Junior David Brown, a mem
ber of the winning Slate of the
Times, said that the low turn
out did not have a significant
effect upon results. Brown
pointed to the 10 percent mar
gin of victory as approximately
the same as the margin in the
first election. He said the num
bers showed the distribution of
voters had not changed, only
the total number.
However, junior Tony Chor,
a member of the losing Stu
dents' Choice slate, contended
that a larger voter turnout
could have changed the results.
Chor said that the "non-group"
students, who constituted a
majority of Students' Choice's
support, are not as politically
active as the supporters of
Slate of the Times and thus
did not vote.
