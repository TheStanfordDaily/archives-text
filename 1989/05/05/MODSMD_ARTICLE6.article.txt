# Kennedy takes flak from bellicose ASSU senators
## 
### DJ Berinstein Senior staff writer 
University President Donald Kennedy
last night faced a hostile ASSU Senate
whose members homharded him with ques
tions about a proposed interpretation of
the Fundamental Standard and enforce
ment of the Standard's provisions.
Kennedy stated that the Student Conduct
Legislative Council's second proposed in
terpretation of the Fundamental Standard
"still needs work" because of its constitu
tional ambiguities. The SCLC interpreta
tion would restrict harassment of individ
uals on the basis of race, sexual orientation
or gender.

Several members of the senate criticized
the University for failing to adequately en
force the current version of the Fundamen
tal Standard.
Some senators cited the case of a fresh
man who last year continually verbally
abused his gay resident assistant in Otero,
an all-freshmen dorm. The freshman was
removed from University housing, but was
not charged with violating the Fundamental
Standard.
"We made a mistake," Kennedy said. The
freshman "can and should be prosecuted,"
he added, but noted that he could not
speak for the SCLC, which decides
such cases.
Responding to concerns of some
senate members that the Univer
sity was not protecting the welfare
of minorities or trying to improve
abusive behavior patterns, Ken
nedy said that sometimes the
power of community disapproval
might serve "as an adequate in
stitution for punishment."
Senators questioned his re
sponse, but Kennedy stood firmly
by his initial assessment, saying,
"I think you may be underes
timating the power of the com
munity."
As the questioning continued,
undergraduate senator Joe Cha
called the University's discipli
nary system lenient and asked
Kennedy "why the University
makes it so easy to graduate."
Kennedy disagreed with the as
sesment of lenient policies, how
ever, saying two- or three-quarter
suspensions for honor code viola
tions are "a heavy price."
