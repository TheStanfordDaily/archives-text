# Stanford faces water bill hike

Despite recent heavy rains, Stanford still faces a
probable 25 percent cut in water use later this year
and a possible water bill increase of $100,000 to
$150,000, according to Cheryl Jensen, operations
and maintenance manager overseeing campus water
use.
Jensen's best guess is that the University may
face a 30 to 40 percent increase in water rates,
which translates to $100,000 or more next year.
This increase comes at a tough time for University
finances, as Stanford already plans for a $2 million
deficit.
San Francisco Water District officials, on whom
the campus depends for its Hetch Hetchy reservoir
allocation, have decided to seek a rate increase from
the city's Public Utilities Commission before reach
ing a final decision on how much to reduce the
quotas of 30 suburban water dis
tricts.
The water district recently es
timated that a 32 percent rate
increase would be needed in 1989-
90, if the current rationing was
discontinued. That would cost
Stanford an additional $200,000
per year.
John Mullane of the San Fran
cisco Water District said any of
ficial changes in rates or water
cutbacks will be announced next
month. Until then, the University
will continue to operate on a basic
formula that was applied in May
of 1987.
"The water district has only put
forth three plans so far" on water
reduction, Jensen said. "Either no
decrease, a 10 percent voluntary
decrease or a 25 percent manda
tory decrease. I'd say it's a run-off
between the 10 and 25 percent
cutbacks."
In order to prepare for the
worst, Jensen said she foresees 25

percent cutbacks for the Univer
sity.
Jensen said that Stanford is cur
rently adhering to a mandatory
25 percent cutback based on the
1987 usage report. "The worst
that could happen is that we
would stay on that plan for an
other year," she said.
Jensen expects that Stanford
will simply continue using its cur
rent conservation measures. They
include cutting back on irrigation,
watering athletic fields and the
Stanford Golf Course with Felt
Lake water rather than drinking
water and installing water-saving
devices in student dorms.
These reductions in water use
are now being followed by a closer
look at high-volume water uses in
research, where recycling may
prove cost-effective in some in
stances.
Depending on this summer's
heat, the University may near
capacity usage of its chilled water
system for air conditioning.
Continued construction and
even modest population growth on
campus will boost long-term
water demand.
