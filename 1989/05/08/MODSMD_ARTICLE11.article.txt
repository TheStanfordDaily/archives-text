### 
MEXICO CITY (AP) - The leader
of a drug-smuggling cult that killed 15
people and buried their bodies along
the U.S.-Mexican border ordered his
own killing when police closed in on
him, two of his companions said yes
terday.
Adolfo de Jesus Constanzo was shot
and killed Saturday after police ap
peared outside the Mexico City apart
ment building where he was staying
with Sara Aldrete and five other alleged
cult members.
Aldrete, 24, a former honor student
at Texas Southmost College in
Brownsville, told reporters Constanzo
ordered Alvaro de Leon Valdez to kill
him and his right-hand man, Martin
Quintana Rodriguez.
Aldrete, described as the "witch" of
the cult, de Leon Valdez and three
others arrested after the shootout were
presented to reporters Sunday at the
Mexico City Attorney General's office.
They stood behind a 3-by-6-foot table
bearing confiscated cult items, including
a skull apparently made of wax and a
female doll holding another doll.

De Leon Valdez said he shot Con
stanzo and Quintana with a machine
gun after Constanzo ordered him to do
so and hit him when he resisted.
"He went crazy, crazy" when police
came, said de Leon Valdez, who had
collar-length blond hair and a beard and
wore a dirty white shirt.
"He grabbed a bundle of money and
threw it and began shooting out the
window," he said. "He said everything,
everything was lost."
He quoted Constanzo as saying, "No
one's going to have this money."
Aldrete said Constanzo "ordered him
to kill him because it was the end and
he wanted to die with Martin."
She referred to Constanzo, 26, as El
Padrino, or the godfather.
The bodies of Constanzo and Quin
tana were found slumped together in
side a tiny closet in the Mexico City
apartment. Their shirts were smeared
with blood.
Aldrete said she did not see the shoot
ing or the killings of 15 people whose
bodies were found on the Santa Elena
Ranch outside Matamoros along the

U.S. border in April.
She said she did not know about those
killings until she saw reports of them
on television.
Constanzo and Aldrete are believed
to have directed human sacrifices,
mutilations and the boiling of brains
and other organs in rituals to bring
occult protection to their drug
smuggling ring.
De Leon Valdez, 22, said he took part
in the killing of Mark Kilroy, a Texas
college student, and of some of the
others on the ranch. But he and Aldrete
indicated Constanzo committed most of
the killings.
Asked who killed Kilroy, Aldrete said:
"Adolfo."
De Leon Valdez said the young Amer
ican was killed with a machete chop to
the head.
Appearing calm, Aldrete said she was
sorry about the death of Kilroy and the
others.
"I feel sorry because when he disap
peared I was trying to help the (Kilroy)
family," she said in response to
reporters' questions.
