# Panamanians elect new president

### 
PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) -
Panamanians voted for a new president
yesterday in an election fraught with
charges of fraud and U.S. interference,
and some foreign observers complained
of voting irregularities.
The election, seen as a referendum
on the de facto rule of Gen. Manuel
Antonio Noriega, pitted Carlos Duque,
hand-picked by Noriega, against
Guillermo Endara, the candidate of an
opposition coalition.
"The triumph of the opposition is
indisputable," Endara said after polls
closed at 5 p.m. (6 p.m. EDT) but before
any results had been announced. He
called for a march today to safeguard
the results.
Although Endara cited no figures, the
opposition released an exit poll claiming
that 55.1 percent of 1,022 voters said
they had chosen Endara and 39.5 per
cent said they had voted for Duque.

In the only reported incident of vio
lence, the Roman Catholic church said
a Dutch priest was shot and seriously
wounded by soldiers as he urged people
over a loudspeaker to go to the polls in
the western city of David.
Voters began lining up at some polling
stations at 5 a.m., two hours before the
scheduled opening. At one booth, more
than 100 of 348 registered voters were
in line by 8 a.m. By late afternoon, the
lines were gone.
The government promised official
results within 24 hours after closing
time.
The opposition accused the govern
ment of making arrangements for its
supporters to vote "early and often"
and said they feared the election would
be stolen as votes were tallied at the
Election Tribunal.
Opposition leaders pointed out that
the 15,000 members of Noriega's De

fense Forces were allowed to jump to
the front of voting lines and they could
vote at any booth, making multiple
voting possible.
They said hundreds of opposition sup
porters who went to the San Juan
Bautista de la Salle College to vote were
told they were not registered to do so.
The college is in a wealthy Panama City
district.
Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., part of a
13-member uninvited delegation sent by
President Bush, said: "The general belief
is that the election will be stolen some
time tonight."
"We've seen many irregularities, but
it is difficult to judge the extent of the
irregularities," he said.
"They tried to put on a nice play, but
it wasn't Shakespeare," said Jurgen
Koch, a West German observer invited
by Panama's human rights commission.
