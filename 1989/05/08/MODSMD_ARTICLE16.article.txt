## Shorts story 
### 
GALA Week provides a
chance for everyone
to learn and have fun

IT'S 8:50 A.M., you have a 9
a.m. class, and it is a hot May
day at Stanford. So of course
you fumble for your shorts and
stumble your way bleary-eyed
toward the Quad.
But as your eyes begin to focus,
you notice that people are staring
at your bare legs. One group
snickers, and another shouts an
obscenity. Then you realize — it's
Gay/Lesbian/Bisexual Shorts
Day, and they're laughing at your
shorts.
Well, now imagine this happen
ing every day, and you may begin
to understand the experience of
gays at Stanford. To them, their
sexuality is a natural, unchange
able thing.
Such consciousness-raising is
exactly what Gay and Lesbian
Awareness Week is about. With
a kick-off celebration at the Vor
tex last night, it will go on
through next Saturday.
Tomorrow is Shorts Day (for
merly Gay Blue Jeans Day), and
unless you want to be constricted
to a hot pair of jeans, you too
will be participating in GALA
Week.
Contrary to popular opinion,
wearing shorts tomorrow does
not indicate that you are gay, or
even that you support homo
sexuality. Rather, it's an exercise
in putting yourself in someone
else's shoes — or in this case,
shorts — for one day.
It is quite natural for someone
to wear shorts on a hot day in
May. And that's exactly the point.
Society tries to make gay, lesbian

and bisexual people feel like
deviants every day of the year
for doing something as natural
to them as wearing cool clothing
when it's hot.
Even students who have had
no contact with homosexuality
will benefit from the week.
Greater understanding, whether
it be in issues of race, gender or
sexual orientation, surely could
not hurt this campus.
It should be emphasized, then,
that GALA Week is not just about
gay pride or gay unity. One com
munity of Stanford students is
inviting the rest of the campus
to learn more about them.
Events include talks on the le
gal status of gays and lesbians
and the intersections of homo
sexuality with Christianity and
Judaism.
And the community wants
people to have fun, too. Aside
from lectures, GALA Week also
includes films, parties, a noon
concert at Tresidder Union and
a comedy night at The Coffee
House. The week will finish off
Saturday with a dance at Elliott
Program Center. Heterosexual
students are welcome at any and
all of these events.
Lesbians, gays and bisexuals
are 10 percent of Stanford. They
are 10 percent of the, academic
endeavors, the dramatic produca
tions, the residence life, the ath
letic competitions — everything
that makes Stanford a great uni
versity.
The Stanford community must
make the effort to accept and
include gays, lesbians and
bisexuals, and support their ef
forts — like GALA Week — to
enrich and educate the commu
nity. Without this acceptance,
Stanford is only 90 percent of
what it could be.
