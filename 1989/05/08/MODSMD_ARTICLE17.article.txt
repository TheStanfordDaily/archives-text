El Centro Chicano director deserves full-time status

THERE WERE SEVERAL inac
curacies in the May 4 article,
"MEChA demands dean," that
should be clarified.
The article states, "Back in the fall
of 1987, the Rainbow Agenda included
the call for a full-time MEChA dean
among its demands to the University."
The correct title for this position is
assistant dean of Student Affairs and
director of El Centro Chicano.
The Rainbow Agenda called for
full-tirne status for the administrator
who fulfills this responsibility. This
staff member works with 20 different
Chicano/Latino student groups affili
ated with El Centro, and with many
other groups in the University, not

just MEChA, although that organiza
tion is very important.
The article states, "MEChA said that
they have met several times with the
University's Budget and Administration
committee." The committee MEChA
met with is the El Centro Budget,
Administration and Planning Commit
tee. It is the governance committee of
the center.
Still later it is stated that, "Jackson
o.ersees ethnic deans ..." I oversee
assistant deans of Student Affairs who
also serve as directors of ethnic
centers. This distinction may be a fine
one, but nevertheless it is very impor
tant. These are University professional
positions with broadly defined educa-

tional responsibilities.
The article also indicates that
. . MEChA would like to help with
the selection process for a full-time
dean to ensure that the University
hires a responsive dean." This quota
tion suggests that there is currently a
vacancy in the El Centro that needs to
be filled. This is not the case.
El Centro is currently administered
by an assistant dean of Student Affairs
and director who is in a mainline
professional position and has been for
five years. He deserves to have the
percentage of his time increased from
50 percent to 100 percent as was done
at the Black Community Services
Center this year.

Finally, it is important for the com
munity to know that the Dean of
Student Affairs and the Provost have
provided Campus Affairs with funds to
ensure full-time administrative support
for this position and for the assistant
dean and director positions in the
other ethnic centers.
What is needed in El Centro is for
students to work through the El
Centro governance group to frame a
recommendation for my office indicat
ing how the center would like us to
use the funds at our disposal to ad
minister this vital University program.
Michael Jackson
Associate Dean of Students for Campus
Affairs
