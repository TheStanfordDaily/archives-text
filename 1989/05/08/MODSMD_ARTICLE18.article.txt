# Abortion debate is too sensationalist
## 
### 
With the strong emotional nature of
the abortion debate, it is easy for both
the pro-choice and pro-life camps to get
carried away with name-calling, sweep
ing generalizations and sensationalism
of the issues involved. These kinds of
activities only serve to further confuse
and cloud the issues.
Ads such as the one printed by the
"Voice for Choice" campaign in the
April 26 Daily exemplify this irrespon
sible presentation of the abortion
debate. The ad states that we cannot
allow this country to "return to the
days of back alley abortions, when
women faced fear, pain, degradation
and even death."
Let's not fool ourselves. Abortion has
never been, and never will be, a picnic
on a sunny day. "Safe and legal" abor
tions are not pain-free. In fact, they
are often excruciatingly painful physi
cally and/or psychologically. Also, many
women give accounts of legal abortion

experiences that were very fear-filled
and very degrading. "Safe and legal"
abortions still can cause physical harm
such as perforation of the uterus, fu
ture inability to bear children and yes,
even death.
Furthermore, the sweeping general
ization in the ad that everyone who
wants abortions to be illegal also
"seek(s) to deny all access to contracep
tion and to prevent sexuality education
in schools" is simply false. I am pro
life, pro-contraception and pro-respon
sible sex ed, and I know many others
who are as well.
The further statement that pro-life
advocates "want to return to the days
when there was no hope for women
who found themselves with an un
wanted pregnancy" is short-sighted and
unfounded. Isn't it a brazen conclusion
that the only "hope" women have in a
crisis pregnancy situation is through
abortion?
I believe that the many women who
have chosen other options in this situa
tion would strongly disagree. Also, a
large number of pro-life advocates are
involved in volunteer programs which

seek to provide counseling, financial,
medical and housing aid to women
with unplanned pregnancies.
