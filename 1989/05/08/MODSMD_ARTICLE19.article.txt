# Hamrdla would enforce Honor Code
## 
### 
Having been away from the campus
for a couple of weeks, I returned to
find inaccuracies in remarks attributed
to me in an April 25 article,
"Plagiarists face stiff penalty ..
I am quoted as saying that "society
is simply more permissive ... we tend
to increasingly mask the fact that
(plagiarism) is simply wrong by trying
— in what can be convulsive fashion
— to rationalize them." "Convulsive"
should have been "convoluted."
More substantially, I am quoted as
admitting that I "won't report a viola
tion when I see it." I would never
have said any such thing. My stance
on the issue is precisely the opposite;

as a student earlier and as an instruc
tor now, I would report a violation of
the Honor Code with no hesitation.
What I did say is that — while dis
agreeing with the inaction — I can
understand why students now might be
much more reluctant to report other
students than they were some years
ago.
