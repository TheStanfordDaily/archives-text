# Campbell displays a Debtman
## 
### DJ Berinstein Senior staff writer 
Congressman Tom Campbell, R-Santa Clara,
began his first Stanford "town meeting" last night
by presenting the newest Congressional gimmick —
the Debtman, a large deficit-measuring tubular cal
culator that illustrates the need to reduce an ever
present federal budget deficit.
By the end of the hour-long meeting in Tresidder
Union, the Debtman, which steadily measures
growth of the deficit, registered a $28-million in
crease.
Campbell went on to summarize his recent activ
ities in Washington, D.C., including his support of
a new Congressional budget package that aims to
reduce the deficit by $28 billion in the next year,
1,000 hours of debt at the rate incurred last night.
"Although it's not a lot, it's a start," he said.
However, Campbell added that the package faces
multiple barriers to its passage in the coming year.
If this happens, Congress could go to a "sequester"
plan, or across-the-board cuts.
The sequester cuts would trim down defense as
well as social spending, "which no one wants," he
said.
Campbell also outlined President Bush's new
trade plans with Japan over the FSX fighter plane
and criticized them for benefitting Japan too much.
Under Bush's plan, the United States may help
Japan build FSX planes for its own defense by
providing the country with avionic software and
weapons-systems technology.

Campbell said he disapproves of
the FSX deal because of the recent
scandal in which Japanese compan
ies gave U.S. technological secrets
to the Soviets and helped the
Libyans build a controversial chemi
cal weapons plant.
Audience members then asked
Campbell why the United States
should have helped Japan build its
own defense after World War II

when Japan's constitution was changed to specify
that its defense budget should not total more than
1 percent of its gross national product.
Campbell said the United States has a vested
interest in encouraging a stronger North Pacific
region.
However, he voiced doubt over whether the FSX
deal is the best way to maintain U.S. interests in
the area.
Over the course of the evening, the freshman
representative answered questions ranging from gun
control and abortion to environmental issues.
For instance, Campbell said he believes in the
federal legislation to ensure tighter gun control, but
added that "we can do more."
Campbell drew applause from the crowd when he
affirmed his belief that women should have the
right to choose whether or not to have an abortion.
He added, however, that because abortion is a
religious issue, he does not support government
funding for abortions.
