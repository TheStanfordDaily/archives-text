## Slouching toward June 
### 
SENIOR CLASS SPEAKER, huh?
That sounds like a good idea to me,
considering how bored I was at last
year's Commencement. I spent most of
the time trying to pick out people who
weren't wearing anything under their
gowns, watching the grads playing fris
bee, and thumb-wrestling any chal
lengers. I got a good tan, I have to admit,
but there isn't much chance of that this
go-round. I'll be covered with a long black
robe.
I'm really pretty excited about Com
mencement. I mean, that's only natural.
It is mine, after all. But Gary Trudeau
is reason for anybody to be anxious for
the 18th to get here. We can ask him for
all the poop on Bryant Gumbel, and
maybe he'll even bring Jane along. I don't
know how funny he'll be, but he's got
to be better than last year's yawnmaster.
I saw history majors dozing off frota
that guy, and I didn't think anything
bored them. _
But about having one of our own speak
at graduation. It's a great idea, but it
presents lots of problems. For instance,
who is to say that the graduate schools
don't want representatives to speak as
well? I mean, we aren't the only ones
who are getting degrees on that day. Why
shouldn't one Med School, one Law
School, one Biz School, etc. grad get his
or her say, too?
I'll tell you why, and this is no reflec
tion on any of those schools, but it would
make the ceremony too damn long, and
it would be boring for the rest of us.
I mean, who wants to hear some Med
School guy with a hangover talk about

cadavers he has known or a law student
reminisce about his favorite cases? Sub
jects only a fellow student could love, and
only an insomniac could stay awake
through.
So do we really want to subject them
to some of our petty insights? Like I do
every week? Don't answer that last bit.
Aside from the problem of "Well, if you
have one everyone else will want one,
too," there is the problem of who makes
the decision about the identity of the
speaker.
Should he of she be an A.B. or a 8.5.?
Should a man represent our class or is
a woman a better representative? Should
this person have plans for continuing
education? Should this person have a job
lined up?
Stanford is a diversified community. I
know for sura thai 4 t any
subject with every member ot our class.
But I could be a representative as easily
as the next person.
I did Stanford. I went overseas. I lived
in a freshman dorm. I've had five room
mates. I rowed crew. I played IMs. I
bought sweatshirts at the Bookstore. I
waited in line at the Post Office. I went
to the Exotic Erotic at Alpha Sig. I drank
beer at fraternities. I played pinball at
the Rec Center. I hung out at the 0. I
read The Daily. I went to Flicks. I went
to most of my classes.
What makes me non-representative of
Stanford? Tell me that, and you'll tell
me how the decision is going to be made,
if it is made. Who can claim to speak for
us all? And how do we find you? We'd

like to hear from a peer, but we're all
so different, who really is our peer?
I can think of a few people I'd like to
hear speak at graduation. Not because
they represent Stanford's Class of 1989,
but because they're funny or clever or
exceptionally good-looking. I don't want
to be bored at our graduation ceremony.
I don't really care that much if I feel
represented.

If you read my column, you know that
I am a little behind on my Dailys because
I get them by second class mail (that is,
by slow boat delivery). However, I have
heard that people were insulted by my
April 24 column. It was a poorly thought
out piece. It is not for me or anyone else
to tell someone what they should do, and
it is certainly not for me to say what
profession is more valuable.
I am sorry for what I said. I was wrong,
and I will not allow the same mistake to
happen again. Sometimes when we don't
think before we speak or write, our feet
creep up a yard or so and we end up
chewing our toenails. One sentiment be
comes a totally different one when so
expressed, and people get hurt. And that
is not what I intended.

read The Daily. I went to Flicks. I went
to most of my classes.
What makes me non-representative of
Stanford? Tell me that, and you'll tell
me how the decision is going to be made,
if it is made. Who can claim to speak for
us all? And how do we find you? We'd

like to hear from a peer, but we're all
so different, who really is our peer?
I can think of a few people I'd like to
hear speak at graduation. Not because
they represent Stanford's Class of 1989,
but because they're funny or clever or
exceptionally good-looking. I don't want
to be bored at our graduation ceremony.
I don't really care that much if I feel
represented.

If you read my column, you know that
I am a little behind on my Dailys because
I get them by second class mail (that is,
by slow boat delivery). However, I have
heard that people were insulted by my
April 24 column. It was a poorly thought
out piece. It is not for me or anyone else
to tell someone what they should do, and
it is certainly not for me to say what
profession is more valuable.
I am sorry for what I said. I was wrong,
and I will not allow the same mistake to
happen again. Sometimes when we don't
think before we speak or write, our feet
creep up a yard or so and we end up
chewing our toenails. One sentiment be
comes a totally different one when so
expressed, and people get hurt. And that
is not what I intended.

SENIOR CLASS SPEAKER, huh?
That sounds like a good idea to me,
considering how bored I was at last
year's Commencement. I spent most of
the time trying to pick out people who
weren't wearing anything under their
gowns, watching the grads playing fris
bee, and thumb-wrestling any chal
lengers. I got a good tan, I have to admit,
but there isn't much chance of that this
go-round. I'll be covered with a long black
robe.
I'm really pretty excited about Com
mencement. I mean, that's only natural.
It is mine, after all. But Gary Trudeau
is reason for anybody to be anxious for
the 18th to get here. We can ask him for
all the poop on Bryant Gumbel, and
maybe he'll even bring Jane along. I don't
know how funny he'll be, but he's got
to be better than last year's yawnmaster.
I saw history majors dozing off frota
that guy, and I didn't think anything
bored them. _
But about having one of our own speak
at graduation. It's a great idea, but it
presents lots of problems. For instance,
who is to say that the graduate schools
don't want representatives to speak as
well? I mean, we aren't the only ones
who are getting degrees on that day. Why
shouldn't one Med School, one Law
School, one Biz School, etc. grad get his
or her say, too?
I'll tell you why, and this is no reflec
tion on any of those schools, but it would
make the ceremony too damn long, and
it would be boring for the rest of us.
I mean, who wants to hear some Med
School guy with a hangover talk about

cadavers he has known or a law student
reminisce about his favorite cases? Sub
jects only a fellow student could love, and
only an insomniac could stay awake
through.
So do we really want to subject them
to some of our petty insights? Like I do
every week? Don't answer that last bit.
Aside from the problem of "Well, if you
have one everyone else will want one,
too," there is the problem of who makes
the decision about the identity of the
speaker.
Should he of she be an A.B. or a 8.5.?
Should a man represent our class or is
a woman a better representative? Should
this person have plans for continuing
education? Should this person have a job
lined up?
Stanford is a diversified community. I
know for sura thai 4 t any
subject with every member ot our class.
But I could be a representative as easily
as the next person.
I did Stanford. I went overseas. I lived
in a freshman dorm. I've had five room
mates. I rowed crew. I played IMs. I
bought sweatshirts at the Bookstore. I
waited in line at the Post Office. I went
to the Exotic Erotic at Alpha Sig. I drank
beer at fraternities. I played pinball at
the Rec Center. I hung out at the 0. I
read The Daily. I went to Flicks. I went
to most of my classes.
