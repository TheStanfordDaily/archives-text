# Dunham's dance: an exercise of mind and spirit
## 
### Ashley Ryan 
Imagine entering a dance studio
one morning to find a group of
news reporters — complete with
pads, pens and cameras — clap
ping, dancing and singing to the
powerful drumming of a Sen
egalese welcome song.
In the front of the room, the
troupe is led by a beautiful 80-
year-old woman who is unable to
sit still as she hears and feels the
magic of "the best drummer in
the world."
Those who stopped by Roble
Gym Friday morning found just
that, for Friday's press conference
marked the first public appear
ance and demonstration by Kath
erine Dunham, world renowned
choreographer, anthropologist, ed
ucator, humanitarian and Stan
ford's artist-in-residence for May.
After the demonstration, Dun
ham spoke of dance not only as
a movement of the body, but as
an exercise of the mind and spirit
as well. She emphasized that
dance combines movement with
music, rhythm and meaning. As
a dancer and a choreographer, she
said she works "toward having
what you hear and what you vo
calize and the movement you
make be one thing: form and func
tion."
Dunham has been brought to
Stanford thanks in large part to
the efforts of the Committee on
the Black Performing Arts, and
especially those of Halifu
Osumare, the director of the com
mittee and an instructor with
Stanford's Dance Division.
Two years ago, Osumare had
the dream of bringing the "best"
to Stanford, and this month the
dream has been realized to the
great benefit of the entire Stan
ford and Bay Area community.
Born in Chicago in 1909, Dun
ham graduated from the Univer

sity of Chicago in 1938 with a
bachelor's degree in dance anthro
pology. She continued to do re
search on the dances of the
Caribbean, with a particular em
phasis on Haiti, and brought a
unique dance technique back to
the United States, integrating the
traditional African and Caribbean
dance forms she observed with
contemporary dance styles.
In 1937, Dunham founded her
own black dance company, which

perfomed her original choreog
raphy and toured internationally
until 1965.
She has also starred in several
Hollywood films, serving at times
as dancer, actor, singer and
choreographer. Her film credits
include "Stormy Weather" and
"Casbah," which were shown on
campus last quarter by the Black
Student Union and Committee on
Black Performing Arts as a
preview to the Dunham residency.

Dunham is also the author of
a number of books on Afro-
Caribbean dance and culture, con
centrating on the sacred Haitian
vodun religion.
Dunham holds eight honorary
degrees and has received numer
ous awards and distinctions, in
cluding the 1983 Kennedy Center
award for lifetime achievement in
the arts.
She presently resides in Port
au-Prince, Haiti, and in East St.

Louis, 111., where she is the direc
tor of the Katherine Dunham
Museum.
Dunham first went to East St.
Louis 20 years ago and found her
self in a city "on fire" with the
civil rights movement. She spent
her first night in jail, protesting
the arrest of young Warlords, a
black militant group. After that
experience, she established a com
munity center promoting both ac
ademics and the visual arts, with
the goal of finding "a way to bring
out of the young of East St. Louis
what they could do with perform
ing arts," she said.
Dunham's public residency at
Stanford began April 14 with the
opening of a costume and print
exhibit at Meyer Library. The ex
hibit will be on display until the
end of this month.
The events continued yesterday
at Memorial Auditorium with a
lecture and demonstration titled,
"A Walk Through Katherine Dun
ham's Life." On Friday, May 12,
a day-long symposium on Dun
ham and her contributions to
American dance will feature
speakers, papers and presenta
tions from around the nation. The
symposium will be open to the
public.
Public community classes are
also being offered every Saturday
this month at the Ravenswood
Recreation Center in East Palo
Alto. These classes, which are
being taught by Dunham and
three assistants accompanying
her during the residency, include
a performance class on the Dun
ham technique, a seminar on
dance anthropology and a
workshop on Senegalese drum
ming.
At Stanford, Dunham is teach
ing one anthropology class,
"Dances of the African Diaspora,"
and one dance class, "African
Caribbean Dance Technique."
