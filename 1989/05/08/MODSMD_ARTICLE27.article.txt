## Bruins beat tired Cardinal for NCAA title 
### Evan Tuchinsky Senior staff writer 
LOS ANGELES — Put simply, Stanford
volleyball and national championships have
yet to become compatible partners.
Battling adverse odds and apparent
fatigue, the Cardinal men's volleyball team
came up short in Saturday's title match of
the NCAA Final Four, losing to perennial
winner UCLA 15-1, 15-13, 4-15, 15-12 in
front of 7,224 partisan Pauley Pavilion
fans.

Including Stanford's four-game semifinal
win over Ball State on Friday, the Cardinal
concluded its season with a 29-5 record.
The Bruins finished the year with their
13th title in the 19 years of NCAA com
petition and a 25-6 mark, after decimating
third-place finisher Penn State in the sec
ond semifinal match.
The stage was appropriately set for the
final, a showdown between the No. 1 and
No. 2 teams in the country. Co-champions
of the Western Intercollegiate Volleyball
Association, only one would emerge as na
tional champion.
Serving strong and playing even tougher
defense, the Bruins avenged their April 19
three-game loss to the Cardinal to earn
the title.
"A couple weeks back when they played
us here in Pauley, they really embarrassed
us," Bruin middle blocker Trevor Schirman
said. "I think at that point they peaked in
their season, played flawless volleyball."
With revenge on their minds, the Bruins
entered the match prepared to return the
favor. That they did, playing aggressive
and unintimidated volleyball.
In hindsight, the opening few minutes
foretold the match's outcome. Stanford
middle blocker Dan Hanan's match-opening
serve sailed just past the endline, and the
Bruins converted on the next three plays
to seize a 3-0 lead.
A UCLA hitting error returned the serve
to Stanford. Scott Fortune and Craig For
syth combined to block Bruin Matt
Whitaker for a point, Stanford's only point
of the game. The end came quickly after.
With the easy first-game win bolstering
the home team's confidence and inspiring
the crowd to peak decibel levels of enthu
siasm, the Bruins gained a tangible advan
tage.

"They (UCLA) got off to a good start,
and I think that sort of set the tempo for
them," Stanford Coach Fred Sturm said.
"They're usually pretty good when they
get out to a lead."
Good, but hardly invincible. The Bruins
scored the first point again, but Stanford
responded with two more to take the team's
first lead of the match.
UCLA tied the score immediately and
extended an 8-3 advantage, but Stanford
crept back to knot the score at 12, then
at 13. The fiasco of game one turned into
a real chance to win in game two.
"I think that'B one of the good traits
about this team: They put things like that
(loss) in the past and get off to a fresh
start," Sturm said. "It's something we weye
able to do well this year."
Stanford came up a little short this time,
however. After a stalemate of sideouts, For
tune attempted a dink shot that landed
incnes wide of the Bruins' right sideline
to give UCLA its 14th point.
Anthony Curci served game point, and I
Fortune hit the ball into the net to give
UCLA the pivotal win. In an instant, the
chance for a 1-1 tie became 2-0 UCLA.
The momentum clearly belonged to
UCLA. One game away from elimination,
Stanford's NCAA title hopes had drastically
dimmed. Even the 200 diehard Stanford
fans seated amid the Bruin contingent
found little reason for hope after the
heartbreaking second-game defeat.
The Cardinal, however, found renewed
inspiration. Fueled by all-around offensive
excellence, Stanford stunned the Bruins
15-4 and returned hope to the Cardinal
cause.
Stanford scored the first point with a
Fortune spike through the middle, followed
immediately by an ofT-the-block hit by John
Alstrom.
The Bruins soon took a 4-3 lead on an
ace by Schirman, but that was the last
point registered by the Bruins that game.
Plagued by hitting errors, the Bruins were
utterly unable to seal the match.
For Stanford, the win meant more than
survival. With an emotional edge, the Car
dinal had an advantage entering the fourth
game, giving the team a chance to tie the
game score and win the match.
That did not happen.
"Usually, to win the third game like that
and take away the momentum, the team
that wins the third game wins in top level
volleyball," UCLA Coach A 1 Scates ex
plained. "So I was really proud of the way
