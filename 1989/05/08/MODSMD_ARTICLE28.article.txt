# Cardinal traveled unpaved road to volleyball final
## 
### Evan Tuchinsky Senior staff writer 
LOS ANGELES — It was a long and
winding road for Stanford to the finals.
Therein lay the problem.
Losing in four games to Western In
tercollegiate Volleyball Association co
champion UCLA, the Cardinal was a
victim of poor circumstance and unfor
tunate timing. A now-infamous coin
toss set the scene for the Bruins' 13th
title, and Stanford would have had to
deviate greatly from the set script in
order to bring the championship trophy
to the Farm.
The odds were not in Stanford's favor
ever since the WIVA tiebreaker which
gave UCLA a vacation and Stanford a
headache. Forced to play through the
toughest regional in any sport, where

any of the teams competing could
realistically win the national title, the
Cardinal could not possibly enter the
Final Four in top form.
The result: a less-than-spectacular
tournament. Flat and fatigued from two
demanding and emotional regional wins,
Stanford settled for second in the big
gest tourney the NCAA has, while
UCLA coasted through to the title.
For Stanford, it was the most
honorable second-place finish imagina
ble.
"I'm proud of my team," Stanford
Coach Fred Sturm said. "If you compare
the two roads to get here, we had a
pretty tough road. In the last four
weeks, we had a series of very tough
matches and my players responded very
well. We fell one short."
The deficit is not surprising, consid

ering the circumstances. Bruin middle
blocker Trevor Schirman felt that
UCLA was peaking in the finals whereas
Stanford peaked two weeks earlier, but
the real difference lay in the two teams'
roads to the Final Four.
UCLA: The Bruins played USC at
home, then had two weeks off before
this past weekend's Final Four.
Stanford: The Cardinal played Loyola
Marymount and Pepperdine on the
road. Then came the West Regional Se
lection Tournament the following
Thursday down in Southern California,
where Stanford faced defending NCAA
champion USC in its own neighborhood,
followed by a grueling match with
Hawaii. Finally, four days later, the Car
dinal boarded the plane one more time
for Los Angeles.
Definitely a discernable differ
ence.
"We played seven matches in
three weeks," Sturm noted. "We
had five matches in maybe eight
days, then had to come down here
and play another two.
"The other team was playing
at home, training for two weeks
with the game ball and on the
game court, changing their lineup,
preparing for a team that has to
battle through the regionals and
has to come home and has to
prepare for the Final Four with
only three days to go. I think we
have to give our players credit."
The Bruins were awarded the
championship trophy for a record
13th time and for the seventh time
at center court in Pauley. But the
moral victory and pride belong to
Stanford, the team that came
within two games of earning, not
merely accepting, the national
title.
