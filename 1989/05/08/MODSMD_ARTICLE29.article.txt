If a prophet were asked to
predict Stanford's performance in
Friday's tennis match with Cali
fornia tennis match, he would
have been wise to say something
to the effect of "And a freshman
shall lead them."

Women's Tennis
Cardinal 5, Golden Bears 4

That freshman was the incom
parable Debbie Graham who
pulled out a gutsy three-setter
against Kay Louthian and teamed
with All-American Sandra Birch
to thrash Emilie Viqueira and
Alissa Finerman in doubles.
Graham's win gave the Cardi
nal a 4-2 lead after singles. The
Graham-Birch duo then went on
to provide Stanford with its only
doubles triumph — and the team
win.
And so, in the regular-season
finale, the Cardinal came closer
to losing a dual match than it had
in the 1989 campaign. Nonethe
less, the team came out on top
to finish the year 25-0, 9-0 in

Pacific 10 South play.
"It was a good, scary match,"
Coach Frank Brennan said after
wards. "We haven't been tested
all that much this year."
Graham took an early lead in
her match with Louthian, win
ning the first set 6-3. But Lou
thian came back to take the sec
ond set 7-5. In the meantime, the
rest of the singles matches all
were closed out in straight sets.
At No. 1, Tami Whitlinger was
trying to avenge her only dual
match defeat of the year against
Karen Shin. Once again, though,
Shin had Whitlinger's number
winning 6-4, 6-3.
Sandra Birch continued her roll
at No. 2, dusting Cal's Lisa Albano
by a 6-2, 6-4 score. One spot be
hind Birch, Lisa Green continued
her superb play with a 6-4, 6-4
win over Jean-Marie Lozano. Teri
Whitlinger handled Viqueira 6-4,
6-3 at No. 5.
The No. 6 contest provided the
Bears' second singles victory —
and set the stage for the excite
ment in doubles. Sharon Fletcher
— a surpise semifinalist at Pac
10s — continued to be one of the
hottest players in collegiate tennis
as she bested Kylie Johnson 7-5,
6-4.

In the doubles, things looked
like trouble for Stanford. The
Whitlingers dropped the first set
to Fletcher and Lozano 6-2 and
then fell behind 1-0 in the second.
And to make matters worse,
Green and captain Cindy
Buchsbaum were trailing 3-1 at
the hands of Louthian and Al
bano.
Birch and Graham, perhaps
sensing the importance of earning
a victory, then turned their play
up a notch. The two began pound
ing overheads and hitting crisp
volleys and moved out to a 5-3
lead.
The Whitlingers then fell in the
second set by a 6-0 score at about
the time Buchbaum and Green
dropped their first set 6-3.
It seemed critical for Buchs
baum and Green to remain com
petitive to allow Birch and
Graham to escape the psycholog
ical pressure of standing out there
alone with an undefeated season
— and a place in history — on
the line.
Buchsbaum and Green did ex
actly that, managing to extpnd
their match just enough.
Meanwhile, Birch and Graham
