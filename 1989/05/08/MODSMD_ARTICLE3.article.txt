# Trustee's accusers may back down
## Coalition to drop charges if Bass' bank did not redline 
### Brad Hayward Senior staff writer 
The smoke is growing thicker
in a fiery dispute between a coa
lition of Bay Area community
groups and the bank owned by
Stanford Board of Trustees mem
ber Robert Bass.
The organization of 17 groups,
calling itself the Greenlining Co
alition, has offered to withdraw
its charge that American Savings
Bank engages in redlining if the
bank proves through an indepen

dent audit that more than 1 per
cent of its loans goes to black
people living in black communi
ties.
Redlining is an illegal loan prac
tice that discriminates against
people living in low-income, pri
marily minority neighborhoods.
American Savings officials have
vigorously denied the charge of
redlining but have not responded
to the coalition's new proposal.
American Savings officials are
perplexed that the coalition has
issued a new proposal when the

bank has already agreed to the
original proposal — a meeting to
discuss the redlining allegation.
Meanwhile, University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy has sent a
letter to the coalition denying its
request for a meeting to discuss
the relationship of Bass' business
activities and his role as a trustee.
The letter said Bass has "an ex
emplary record of service — not
only to Stanford, but to dozens
of community and philanthropic
organizations."
And amid the charges and

refutations, Bass himself has re
mained silent and referred The
Daily's phone calls to a public re
lations agent.
Over the past two months, the
greenlining coalition has been
pushing for a meeting with Bass
to discuss the alleged redlining.
The coalition picketed the bank's
Oakland branch last month and
has written several rounds of let
ters.
The coalition's charges against
American Savings are part of a
larger political agenda that aims
to link federal bailouts of savings
and loan institutions to increased
funding for aid to the homeless.
The coalition, in connection with
its legal counsel, Public Adv
ocates, has previously intervened
in mergers and buyouts involving
California First and Union Bank,
according to spokeswoman Edith
Adame.
The recent history of American
Savings is complicated. Just a few
months ago, in fact, was a com
pletely different company: Amer
ican Savings and Loan Associa
tion.
American's q>3o bulion 'n assets
were seized by the Federal Home
Loan Bank Board in September

1988, according to current senior
vice president Layna Browdy. In
December, Bass' Fort Worth
based investment group bought $7
billion of the asse « and became
the owner of a institution,
American Savings Bank.
Under the owner, a com
pletely new mur agement team has
operated American Savings for
the past four months, Browdy
said.
The coalition's charge of redlin
ing is Tirimarily based on two
sources. The first is a recent in
vestigation by an Atlanta news
paper that revealed widespread
redlining in the savings and loan
industry.
The second is the testimony of
Bay Area congressman Pete Stark
before the House Ways and Means
Committee in March. The tes
timony included the assertion
that every major California
savings and loan institution is

currently engaged in redlining.
Bob Gnaizda, chief counsel for
Public Advocates, added that
American Savings has refused to
support Washington, D.C.-based
coalitions organized by Ralph
Nader and Consumers Union that
call for increased government
auditing of redlining practices.
But according to Browdy,
"American has never engaged in
redlining and the company does
not condone the practice."
Browdy said American Savings
is involved in several projects
around California to prevent red
lining and provide home-financing
for low-income families. Further,
she said she could not understand
how the coalition could come up
with its charges against a com
pany so recently created.
"Surely they aren't talking
about a new company that's only
been around four months,"
Browdy said.

Law School Prof. Kenneth
Scott, an expert on the savings
and loan industry, said in a phone
interview that, though it is diffi
cult to get accurate information
on the problem, "there {ire prob
ably very few examples in Cali
fornia" of redlining as defined by
the coalition.
Adame said the coalition has
twice written to Bass concerning
the alleged redlining and has not
received a personal response.
Owen Blicksilver, Bass' public re
lations agent in New York, said
Thursday that he did not know
of any correspondence Bass had
received from the coalition.
"The issue is a bank issue. The
management of the bank should
really be speaking on the issue,"
Blicksilver said.
Blicksilver added that Bass
would not respond to attacks on
him involving his relationship
with the University. It is the Uni

versity's responsibility to respond
to such charges, he said.
The coalition has, in fact, re
ceived a letter from bunk officials.
According to Browdy, the letter
said bank officials were open to
a face-to-face meeting with the
coalition.
"We're trying very hard to be
responsive," Browdy said.
Coalition respresentatives, how
ever, have expected a response di
rectly from Bass and a meeting
with him personally. Last Wed
nesday, they sent another letter
to Bass describing their proposal
for American Savings to submit
to an independent audit, which
would settle the dispute once and
for all.
Browdy said the bank would not
comment on the proposal until it
is received but added that she
didn't know why the new proposal
is being submitted just after the

bank agreed to the meeting orig
inally proposed by the coalition.
Stanford was brought into the
dispute just last month. Bass, who
holds a master's degree from the
Graduate School of Business and
has provided significant financial
support to both the Business
School and Stanford's Washing
ton, D.C. program, was appointed
to the Board of April 11.
Ten days later, the Greenlining
Coalition sent a letter to Kennedy
questioning Bass' "social respon
sibility" and asking if Bass' ap
pointment "is an embarrassment
to Stanford's values" because of
his bank's alleged redlining.
In a written response dated May
2, Kennedy wrote, "I believe that
the issues you raise, about which
I am in no position to comment,
could more productively be ad
dressed directly to American
Savings Bank."

Ten days later, the Greenlining
Coalition sent a letter to Kennedy
questioning Bass' "social respon
sibility" and asking if Bass' ap
pointment "is an embarrassment
to Stanford's values" because of
his bank's alleged redlining.
In a written response dated May
2, Kennedy wrote, "I believe that
the issues you raise, about which
I am in no position to comment,
could more productively be ad
dressed directly to American
Savings Bank."
The smoke is growing thicker
in a fiery dispute between a coa
lition of Bay Area community
groups and the bank owned by
Stanford Board of Trustees mem
ber Robert Bass.
The organization of 17 groups,
calling itself the Greenlining Co
alition, has offered to withdraw
its charge that American Savings
Bank engages in redlining if the
bank proves through an indepen

dent audit that more than 1 per
cent of its loans goes to black
people living in black communi
ties.
Redlining is an illegal loan prac
tice that discriminates against
people living in low-income, pri
marily minority neighborhoods.
American Savings officials have
vigorously denied the charge of
redlining but have not responded
to the coalition's new proposal.
American Savings officials are
perplexed that the coalition has
issued a new proposal when the

bank has already agreed to the
original proposal — a meeting to
discuss the redlining allegation.
Meanwhile, University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy has sent a
letter to the coalition denying its
request for a meeting to discuss
the relationship of Bass' business
activities and his role as a trustee.
The letter said Bass has "an ex
emplary record of service — not
only to Stanford, but to dozens
of community and philanthropic
organizations."
And amid the charges and

refutations, Bass himself has re
mained silent and referred The
Daily's phone calls to a public re
lations agent.
Over the past two months, the
greenlining coalition has been
pushing for a meeting with Bass
to discuss the alleged redlining.
The coalition picketed the bank's
Oakland branch last month and
has written several rounds of let
ters.
The coalition's charges against
American Savings are part of a
larger political agenda that aims
to link federal bailouts of savings
and loan institutions to increased
funding for aid to the homeless.
The coalition, in connection with
its legal counsel, Public Adv
ocates, has previously intervened
in mergers and buyouts involving
California First and Union Bank,
according to spokeswoman Edith
Adame.
The recent history of American
Savings is complicated. Just a few
months ago, in fact, was a com
pletely different company: Amer
ican Savings and Loan Associa
tion.
American's q>3o bulion 'n assets
were seized by the Federal Home
Loan Bank Board in September

1988, according to current senior
vice president Layna Browdy. In
December, Bass' Fort Worth
based investment group bought $7
billion of the asse « and became
the owner of a institution,
American Savings Bank.
Under the owner, a com
pletely new mur agement team has
operated American Savings for
the past four months, Browdy
said.
The coalition's charge of redlin
ing is Tirimarily based on two
sources. The first is a recent in
vestigation by an Atlanta news
paper that revealed widespread
redlining in the savings and loan
industry.
The second is the testimony of
Bay Area congressman Pete Stark
before the House Ways and Means
Committee in March. The tes
timony included the assertion
that every major California
savings and loan institution is

currently engaged in redlining.
Bob Gnaizda, chief counsel for
Public Advocates, added that
American Savings has refused to
support Washington, D.C.-based
coalitions organized by Ralph
Nader and Consumers Union that
call for increased government
auditing of redlining practices.
But according to Browdy,
"American has never engaged in
redlining and the company does
not condone the practice."
Browdy said American Savings
is involved in several projects
around California to prevent red
lining and provide home-financing
for low-income families. Further,
she said she could not understand
how the coalition could come up
with its charges against a com
pany so recently created.
"Surely they aren't talking
about a new company that's only
been around four months,"
Browdy said.

Law School Prof. Kenneth
Scott, an expert on the savings
and loan industry, said in a phone
interview that, though it is diffi
cult to get accurate information
on the problem, "there {ire prob
ably very few examples in Cali
fornia" of redlining as defined by
the coalition.
Adame said the coalition has
twice written to Bass concerning
the alleged redlining and has not
received a personal response.
Owen Blicksilver, Bass' public re
lations agent in New York, said
Thursday that he did not know
of any correspondence Bass had
received from the coalition.
"The issue is a bank issue. The
management of the bank should
really be speaking on the issue,"
Blicksilver said.
Blicksilver added that Bass
would not respond to attacks on
him involving his relationship
with the University. It is the Uni

versity's responsibility to respond
to such charges, he said.
The coalition has, in fact, re
ceived a letter from bunk officials.
According to Browdy, the letter
said bank officials were open to
a face-to-face meeting with the
coalition.
"We're trying very hard to be
responsive," Browdy said.
Coalition respresentatives, how
ever, have expected a response di
rectly from Bass and a meeting
with him personally. Last Wed
nesday, they sent another letter
to Bass describing their proposal
for American Savings to submit
to an independent audit, which
would settle the dispute once and
for all.
Browdy said the bank would not
comment on the proposal until it
is received but added that she
didn't know why the new proposal
is being submitted just after the

bank agreed to the meeting orig
inally proposed by the coalition.
Stanford was brought into the
dispute just last month. Bass, who
holds a master's degree from the
Graduate School of Business and
has provided significant financial
support to both the Business
School and Stanford's Washing
ton, D.C. program, was appointed
to the Board of April 11.

Coalition sent a letter to Kennedy
