letter to the coalition denying its
request for a meeting to discuss
the relationship of Bass' business
activities and his role as a trustee.

greenlining coalition has been
pushing for a meeting with Bass
to discuss the alleged redlining.
The coalition picketed the bank's
Oakland branch last month and
has written several rounds of let
