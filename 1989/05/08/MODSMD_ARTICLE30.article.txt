team's win over California on Sat
urday live, or was it really a tape
of the teams' last meeting?
You make the call.

Men's Tennis
Cardinal 5, Golden Bears 4

Anyone who thought they had
seen most of this weekend's match
before would have been right.
Consider the points of similarity
between Saturday's contest and
the Cal match of April 11:
Exhibit A. Last time around,
Stanford's Barry Richards lost his
first match of the season to Cal's
Mark Lucena. Saturday, Richards
fell 7-6, 6-4 to Doug Eisenman,
marking his second 1989 loss.
Exhibit B. At Berkeley, after
the other singles matches had
been completed, Glenn Solomon's
gutty win at No. 5 gave the Car
dinal a 4-2 lead going into the

doubles matches. In the rematch,
all eyes were once again on
Solomon (who was at No. 4) as
his 3-6, 7-5, 6-4 win over Ted
Scherman again put Stanford up
4-2.
Exhibit C. Last month, the Car
dinal turned that 4-2 lead into a
four-all tie as Cal's second and
third doubles teams quickly wiped
Stanford's off the courts. Satur
day, the Cardinal's No. 2 and No.
3 teams both fell again in straight
sets, putting the pressure of win
ning the match firmly on the
shoulders of Jeff Tarango and
Alex O'Brien at No. 1.
Exhibit I). Tarango and
O'Brien's biggest win of 1989 had
been their 6-4, 7-6 April 11 tri
umph over Cal's Scherman and
Woody Hunt. Until Saturday. The
Stanford pair, which has yet to
lose this year, scored their second
victory over the nation's second
ranked tandem, 6-7, 6-3, 6-4, to
wrap up the team win.
Of course, Saturday's match
wasn't all deja vu for the Cardinal.
Tarango avenged his earlier
thrashing at the hands of Hunt

by taking him to school, 6-3, 6-0.
"Jeff played unbelievably well,"
Hunt said. "He told me before the
match that he was going to kick
my ass. I knew he was a lot more
pumped up this time."
"I just wanted to put a little
extra effort in today because it
was my last home match,"
Tarango said.
Another change from last time
was that Jeff Cathrall didn't play
singles on Saturday. Martin
Blackman, as he has done several
times in the last two weeks,
moved into Cathrall's customary
No. 2 spot and handled the posi
tion well, downing Carl Chang 7-
6, 6-3.
Alex O'Brien made it three wins
for the Cardinal by crushing Kurt
Streeter 6-2, 6-3.
Meanwhile, on the back courts,
Richards was swallowing his rare
loss and Curtis Dunn was falling
to Lucena, 6-4, 7-5. With all the
other matches over, Solomon
found himself on center stage yet
again, and responded with an
other virtuoso performance.
"I have to give Glenn a lot of

credit," Stanford Coach Dick
Gould said. "He's come through
time and again for us this year.
That was really a pivotal match."
Solomon's win gave the Cardi
nal just enough of a cushion.
Cathrall and Blackman fell 6-3,
6-4 to Eisenman and Lucena,
while Richards and Dan Turbow
didn't fare much better against
Chang and Streeter, who romped
6-1, 6-4.
"It's a good win, but there's
only one match that counts â€” the
NCAAs," Gould said. "Cal, when
they're healthy, is as good as
anyone. We had to play great dou
bles just to stay in the match."
Even though the match meant
very little as far as the season is
concerned (Stanford will moat
likely be seeded second at the
NCAAs, Cal third), Hunt was still
wondering just what more Cal
would have to do to beat the Car
dinal. "Do you know how long its
been since we won here? 1924?"
he asked. "It's been at least 50
years, and we blew it. We had
them. We were up a set and a
break and we still couldn't do it."
