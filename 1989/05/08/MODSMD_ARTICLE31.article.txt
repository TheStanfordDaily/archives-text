Scott Weiss 1 11 i loss
after allowing three Cal runs in
the top of the

was pinch hitter Derek Stark's
fisted double down the left field
line which scored two runs and
put the Bears up 6-5.
"1 don't think Weiss pitched
that bad. The runs were a little
tainted," said Cardinal pitching
Coach Tom Dunton.
Steve Chitren started the game
for Stanford but gave way to
Weiss in the sixth after walking
four batters in the fourth and
fifth.
In the bottom of the sixth, the
Cardinal scored two runs on Steve
Solomon's single. That left Frank
Carey on third and Solomon on
first. Stanford Coach Marquess
had a move up his sleeve.
Solomon took a big lead at first,
md drew the throw from pitcher
Joe Buckley. On the throw, Carey
broke for home, but first baseman
Brad DeJardin threw to third
baseman Dan Cholowsky and
Carey was caught in a pickle.
Cholowsky threw to catcher An
thony Crudele, who was unable
to get Carey running back to
third. Crudele threw it back to
('holowsky who tagged Carey a bit
over zealously and raised his ire.
\s the two exchanged words, both
benches cleared, as they had in
last year's Big Series, but this
time no punches were thrown.
In the seventh, Marquess tried
a little more managerial magic,
but to no avail again. With none
out and runners on first and
third, Marquess decided to try the
old squeeze play. David McCarty
was at the plate with two strikes
and was forced to try and bunt a
pitch down and away. Wben he
♦ ailed to make contact, Troy Paul
sen was caught off third and the
inning was over.
"I think the squeeze play was
a bad call on my part," Marquess
lamented after the game.
Saturday's game was also a
barn burner, this time in enemy
territory. Brian Keyser (6-3)
pitched a superb eight innings to
get the win, a 3-2 decision for the
Cardinal. Keyser allowed seven
hits, but they were scattered and
• 'I ' M ., grot the clutch out when

he needed it.
Keyser worked out of trouble
two consecutive innings. In the
fifth with runners on first and
second, Keyser struck out
Cholowsky on a wicked curve ball
to get the third out.
In the sixth, Keyser had allowed
two runs to put Cal up 2-1. With
the bases loaded, he stopped the
bleeding by inducing Mike Har
rison to ground out.
Stanford scored the winning
run in the top of the ninth with
the game tied 2-2. Roger Burnett
lined a single to center and moved
to second on Tallman's ground
out. Frank Carey then singled
sharply to left, with Harrison
picking up the ball as Burnett

rounded third. Harrison threw a
strike to Stark, but Burnett made
a beautiful hook slide around the
tag to score the run.
With Weiss on the mound in
the ninth, the Bears made a last
gasp. Weiss, using his curve ball
almost exclusively, struck out the
first two batters in the inning,
then walked pinch hitter Mike
Zuber.
Leadoff man Todd Mayo singled
to center, and Evans Diamond
came alive. Daryl Vice, who was
3-for-4 on the day, came to the
plate and crushed a line drive to
the wall that Paul Carey came up
with for the final out.
On Friday, Stan Spencer (3-7)
finally got the offensive and de

fensive support ho needed to get
his first win since March 31. The
Cardinal won 4-1, on the strength
of home runs hy Paul Carey and
McCarty, and some great defen
sive plays.
In the second inning, Spencer
was clearly in trouble. He loaded
the bases by allowing a leadoff
double and two singles. Then
Muehlethaler grounded to
McCarty at first who started a
3-2-3 double play that took the
wind out of Cal's sails. They failed
to score a run in the inning.
The Bears finally managed to
push a run across in the eighth,
but by then it was 4-1 in favor of
the Cardinal, and Spencer cruised
to a complete game win.


David McCarty is congratulated by teammate David Holbrook at home plate after smashing a two-run
homer yesterday. The Cardinal eventually dropped a 7-6 decision to the Bears after taking the first
two contests in the three game series.
