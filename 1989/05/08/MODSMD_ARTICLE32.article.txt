# Lady Luck shines on Cardinal nine
## 
### Robert Portnoy Senior staff writer 
After Friday and Saturday's
games against California, it looked
like Stanford's luck had changed.
With a three-game winning
streak entering the weekend se
ries, the Cardinal's post-season
hopes hinged on continued success
against the Bears.
Lady Luck came to Stanford's
aid for the first time in the
seventh inning Friday.
Clinging to a precarious 2-0 lead
after David McCarty's one-out,
solo home run, designated hitter
Tim Griffin singled. Griffin at
tempted a steal of second, and the
throw trickled into center field,
allowing him to hustle into third.
Cal pulled the infield in, and
Roger Burnett sent a high chopper
to third. The Bears' Dan
Cholowsky leaped, but the ball
skimmed off his glove and into
left for a base hit and Stanford's
third run of the game. Until re
cently, that kind of seeing-eye hit
did not come Stanford's way.
Lady Luck next reared her head
in the eighth. With Todd Mayo
on third and nobody out after an
RBI-triple, Darryl Vice hit a
ground ball to the right of Car
dinal first baseman David
McCarty. McCarty elected to
throw home as Mayo broke on
contact. His throw to Stanford
catcher Eric Cox was perfect, Cox
withstood a collision with Mayo
and the Bears' rally fizzled.
Where did Lady Luck come in,
you ask? First, McCarty's decision
to go home was questionable at
best. Cardinal Head Coach Mark
Marquess revealed after the game
that he was furious when McCarty
threw home. Stanford led 4-1 at
the time, and the easy out at first
was much more important than
cutting down the run at home.
Second, had McCarty decided
to do what he should have, pitcher
Stan Spencer was late in getting
started towards first. McCarty
would have had to eat the ball
because Spencer was beaten to the
ba 8
Third, Mayo is a rather swift
runner. The No. 2 base stealer on
the Bears with 31, Mayo was on
top of Cox as the throw arrived.
Nothing but a perfect throw
would have retired Mayo.
McCarty made the perfect throw.
It was more of the same on
Saturday. Sophomore Scott Weiss,
pitching the ninth in relief of
starter Brian Keyser, was protec
ting a tenuous 3-2 advantage.
Weiss promptly fanned the first
two batters, but decided to do his
best Steve Chitren imitation after
that. Chitren is notorious for put
ting runners on base when he
pitches in a relief role. With two
out, Weiss walked pinch hitter Jon
Zuber and surrendered a single
that sent Zuber to third.
Lady Luck this time decided to
change the wind direction. A stiff
breeze had been blowing out to
right all day, and just before left
handed hitting Darryl Vice
stepped in, the flags started point
ing in.
Sure enough, Vice sent a rocket
into the teeth of the gale that
died at the track in the waiting
glove of Stanford's Paul Carey to
end the game. Moments before
Vice's ball would've been a game
winning homer.
