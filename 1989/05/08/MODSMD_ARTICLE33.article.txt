Not to be outdone by her
younger teammate, junior
Vpnessa Henlon stole some of the
spotlight Saturday. With a leap of
19-foot-5V2, Henlon earned a
chance to compete in the long
jump at the Pacific 10 Conference
meet. Earlier in the year, she
qualified in the triple jump with
a leap of 38-6.
I needed an inch," Henlon said.
Coach kept telling me keep your
legs up, keep your legs up. That's
what I tried to remember as I
wpnt into the jump. It just hap
pened."
"I still need to improve," she
added. "If I am going to do any
thing at the Pac-lOs or qualify for
t hp NCAAs, I nped to jump a lot
farther."
Besides thp pfTorts of the two

women, Asst. Coach Scott Chisam
mentioned the men's mile relay
team as competing "exceptionally
well." The team, comprised of Tim
Collins, Jim Cramton, Marcus
Hickerson, and Peter Kolotouros,
finished a respectable fifth at the
high-power meet. "We actually ex
pected to do better," Hickerson
commented. "We wanted to run
under 3:10."
Other members of the Cardinal
men's team who have already
qualified for the Pac-lOs May 20-
21 include Dave Strang (1:49.2),
Bill Crowley (1:50.5) and Chris
Rae (1:51.39) in the 800, Strang
(3:44.50) in the 1500, Hickerson
(25-2) in the long jump, Brian
