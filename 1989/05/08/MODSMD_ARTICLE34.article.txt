# Water polo clash with Cal ends in tie
## 
### Tyson Vaughan 
At the end of the Stanford-
California men's water polo
game Saturday, the Cardinal
players were visibly disap
pointed.
The result was not one the
players desired — from either
team. The two collegiate water
polo powers tied at 10 points
apiece. Since the game was
played during the club season,
the team did not bother with a
tiebreaker.
Some pointed out positives,
however. Stanford Coach Dante
Dettamanti assured his team,
"If we had eliminated some of
those really dumb mistakes out
there, we would've beaten them
by four or five points."

Junior holeman Eric Blum
chimed in, expressing high ex
pectations for future clashes be
tween the Cardinal and the
Bears. "We know we're better
than them, and that's what
really matters," he said.
Indeed, aside from some stu
pid but costly mistakes, the Car
dinal looked good, for the most
part. However, "Our driving
game wasn't there," Dettamanti
said, refering to one element of
his patented offense. The Car
dinal will need to perfect their
"drive-throughs" if they are to
achieve their goal of a national
championship next year.
In sharp contrast to the
Cardinal-Bear matchup, the fol
lowing game was no contest.
The United States B team dis
mantled the Mexican national

team by a score of 12 to 7, with
three of those goals coming from
Blum. Current Cardinal team
members Jon Swerdloff and
Greg Morris also played for the
U.S.
The last game of the day was
something of a surprise. The
U.S. A Team lost to a deter
mined and aggressive Cuban na
tional team. The surprise was
not necessarily that the Cubans
won, but that they won it hand
ily.
The U.S. fell behind early,
with the Cubans up 3-2 at the
end of the first quarter. The
rest of the game they played
catch-up, usually two or three
points behind the Cubans.
The final score was Cuba 10,
United States 8.
