# Public Service Center gets big boost
## Haas family donates $6.2 million, Center to be renamed in their honor 
### Sharon Gwyn 
The former Stanford Public
Service Center received a hefty fi
nancial boost — and a new name
— last week as a result of a $6.2
million Centennial Campaign en
dowment earmarked to support
the organization.
Because of the large gift, the
center "will be able to continue
as long as the University does,"
said Catherine Milton, the direc
tor of the Public Service Center.
The center will be renamed the
Haas Center for Public Service in
honor of San Francisco's Haas
family, which made the gift.
The Haas' "are a really out
standing family with a long line

of public service," Milton said.
According to Milton, $5 million
of the endowment will go to the
center and the remaining $1.2 mil
lion will go to the newly created
Miriam and Peter Haas Centen
nial professorship in public serv
ice.
The Public Service Center cur
rently involves approximately
2,000 Stanford students in public
service activities, from tutoring in
East Palo Alto to service fellow
ships in countries such as India,
Afghanistan and Hong Kong.
"Plans are to use the money
for the tutoring program in East
Palo Alto, the Clearinghouse and
supporting volunteer coordina
tors" who work at the center, Mil

ton said. The Clearinghouse is a
computerized listing of volunteer
and internship programs in public
service.
"It's very important that stu
dents have the opportunity to go
to other countries and do public
service," Milton said, adding that
the Haas' gift will also enable
more students to do public service
work abroad.
The late Waltar Haas was the
president and chair of Levi Stauss
& Co. and former owner of the
Oakland Athletics baseball team.
His son, Peter Haas, was a
former Stanford trustee, and
Peter Haas' wife Miriam is a
Public Service Center Advisory
Council member. Both Peter and

Miriam Haas are actively involved
in the San Francisco "I Have a
Dream" project, which encourages
sixth graders to continue their ed
ucations through college.
"One of the goals of the Public
Service Center is to integrate
public service with the curricu
lum," said Miriam Haas. The
Haas' gift will help the center take
a step in this direction by provid
ing the funding to bring former
U.S. Secretary of the Health, Ed
ucation and Welfare Department
John Gardner to Stanford as a
professor for public service.
Milton said Gardner will prob
ably be appointed to faculty posi
tions in the School of Business
and the School of Education.
