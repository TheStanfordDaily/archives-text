## Historian recovers a lost past 
### Elizabeth Howton Hob Michitarian Editorial staff 
Editor's note: This is the first
in a five-part series coinciding
with Stanford's Gay and lesbian
Awareness Week.

When Gerard Koskovich came
to Stanford in 1979 intending to
get a doctorate in art history, he
found himself part of a gay com
munity that knew almost nothing
about its own past.
"There were only hints and
rumors about when the Gay
People's Union had been founded
— no one really knew," he re
members.
At that time, the University Ar
chives in Green Library had one
slim folder on gay life at Stanford.
Today, largely due to Koskovich's
efforts, the folders in the archives"
gay and lesbian collection would
make a stack 30 feet high if they
were piled on top of each other.
As he began to get involved in
the union — the predecessor of
today's Gay and Lesbian Alliance
— Koskovich "quickly became
aware that in the jumble of boxes,
loose papers and general disor
ganization in the Old Firehouse
(the home of the union), there
was a lot of unidentified and very
interesting stufT."

Thinking that "someone ought
to take responsibility for preserv
ing those documents," Koskovich
began the Stanford Lesbian and
Gay Archives Project in 1981. "At
first, he says,"it was a very
personal thing. . . . Everyone I
talked to about the project said
'C»reat — you do it.'

Although he says"it was hard
to find others with as much of a
passion for the material as I
have." Koskovich has been helped
by a few other volunteers over
the years, and about 45 people
and organizations have donated
documents to the collection.
The collection includes informa

tion about famous gays and les
bians associated with Stanford,
like Harry Hay, who established
the first gay political organization
in the United States, and Cleve

Koskovich moved to San Fran
cisco last year, where he is a
freelance journalist. He is writing
a book on homosexuality at Stan
ford, which he expects to finish
in about five years.
In his absence, no one has taken
over the project, and a jumble of
papers is again piling up in the
second floor of the Old Firehouse.
But due to Koskovich's decade
of work, today's gay students have
an awareness of their history that
those of 10 years ago did not.
