# Tracking the struggle
## 
### Gerard Koskovich 
The social, cultural and po
litical history of homosexuality
at Stanford is a complex and
fragmentary story of change
and discontinuity, of private
lives and public struggles.
From the early years of the
University to the end of the
last decade, the following
chronology offers a brief sam
pling of people and events
central to that history.
1911-12: In the earliest doc
umented homosexual relation
ship at Stanford, Alberta
Lucille Hart and her lover en
roll as junior transfers. Hart

returns in 1916 for one quarter
at the Medical School. (In later
years. Hart would go on, dress
ing as a man, to practice radiol
ogy and publish a 1936 novel,
"The Undaunted," featuring a
homosexual character.)
1930-32: Harrv Hay attends
Stanford as a freshman and
sophomore. In fall, 1931, he an
nounces his homosexuality to
several nonplussed dorm
neighbors. Hay leaves Stanford
after his sophomore year for
financial reasons. (In 1950,
Hay would go on to found the
Mattachine Society, the first
mtyor homosexual rights group in
the country.)
1953: Jane Rule enrolls for one
quarter in the English graduate
program, where she submits
lesbian-themed short stories to
her writing professor, Wallace
Stegner. (Rule would go on to
publish the classic lesbian novel
"Desert of the Heart" in 1964.)
1965-66: Five students organize
the Stanford Sexual Rights
Forum to promote social and legal
reforms, including the repeal of
"all laws punishing co-habitation,
sodomy, homosexuality . . The
organization ceases to exist when
the students graduate.
January-May 1968: Wendell An
derson (probably a pseudonym for
an unidentified Stanford student)
organizes the Student Homophile
League of Stanford University,
the second known homosexual
student group in the nation.
November 1970: Stanford com
munity members found the Stan
ford Gay Students Union, a social
support and consciousness-raising
group of men and women, stu
dents and non-students meeting
off-campus in private homes. The
founding of GSU marks the be
ginning of the continuous organ
izational history of gay men and
lesbians at Stanford.
January 1971: Maud Haimson,
a senior in English, and Fred Oak
ford, a senior in history, announce
GSU-sponsored dormitory discus
sions on homosexuality in a Stan
ford Daily viewpoint; they are the
first students to come out in The

Daily.
Late December 1971-early Jan
uary 1972: The GSU receives
recognition as a registered
voluntary student organization
under a new name, possibly cho
sen to suggest the group widening
scope: The Gay People's Union.
Winter Quarter 1973. Under the
auspices of the predecessor of the
Innovative Academic Courses pro
gram, community activist Joel
Roberts teaches the first gay
studies course at Stanford.
1973-74: During Fall Quarter,
GPU moves from a desk in the
Old Union Clubhouse to a small
office in the Old Firehouse. By
summer, the group is using the
entire second floor of the building.
1974-77: GPU receives a three
year, $90,000 grant from the state
of California — the first Califor
nia state funding for a gay organ
ization — to establish the Gay
Community of Concern, an inde
pendent pilot program providing
liason between the gay commu
nity and Bay Area mental health
agencies and professionals.
June 1974: GPU sponsors the
first gay and lesbian awareness
week on campus.
1975-76: GPU members for the
first time campaign unsuccess
fully to have the Stanford Career
Planning and Placement Center
closed to employers who discrim
inate on the basis of sexual ori
entation. (The center still
continues to allow employers who
discriminate on the basis of sexual
orientation to recruit on campus.)
April 1976: At the urging of
GPU members, Stanford librari
ans move publications on
homosexuality from locked stacks

to open stacks.
1977: Donald Howard, a founder
of the Modern Language Associ
ation Gay Caucus in 1973, is ap
pointed professor of English —
the first documented openly gay
scholar hired with tenure at Stan
ford. (Howard dies of AIDS in
1987 — the first professor whose
death is publicly attributed to the
disease.)
Spring 1978: A group of stu
dents organize the Gay Counsel
ing Group at the Bridge, with
members certified by the Stanford
Peer Counseling Program.
October 1979: Four community
members carry the GPU banner
in the first National March on
Washington for Gay and Lesbian
Rights, joining over 100,000 other
demonstrators in the nation's cap
ital.
Since 1979, there have been
many more developments in the
history of homosexuality at Stan
ford that are still too recent to be
viewed from a historical perspec
tive.

bian Politics at Stanford: A His
torical Perspective" on Thurs.,
