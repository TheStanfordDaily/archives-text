The 1988 Jobs Rated Almanac listed Actuaries as the
number one professional opportunity in the United
States. Transamerica Life Companies, one of the pre
mier financial services organizations in North America,
offers outstanding opportunities for talented people to
train in this dynamic field. We understand that the
future of our company is, quite literally, in the hands
and minds of our Actuaries as they develop, price,
market and report the financial results of a variety of
products in a profit motivated environment.
Acceptance into Transamerica Life Companies' actu
arial training program requires a strong mathematics
background and the successful completion of a mini
mum of one actuarial examination. Our commitment
to the training program is evidenced by the fact that
time is designated on the job for study in preparation
for each examination.
Transamerica Life Companies also has an actuarial
summer program (completion of 1 actuarial exam is
strongly preferred) designed to provide students,
usually college sophomores or juniors, with an over
view of the insurance industry. Students gain hands
on work experience.
We offer excellent advancement opportunities and a
benefits package hard to beat. We invite you to
explore the challenging and rewarding future you can
have with Transamerica Life Companies by attending
our informational presentation on Tuesday, or
signing up for an interview on Wednesday at the
Career Planning and Placement Center. Or, send
