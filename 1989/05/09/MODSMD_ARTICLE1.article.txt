# Second 'kidnapping' raises few eyebrows
## 
### Jennifer Schmid Staff writer 
Despite negative reactions to a staged
kidnapping last week, the Stanford Central
America Action Network struck again last
night, abducting two pre-arranged "vic
tims" from the dining halls of Arroyo and
Serra Houses.
Seven members of SCAAN, dressed in
camouflage and black, entered the dining
halls and presented a modified dramatiza
tion in order to "bring to (public) awareness
the severity of the human rights violations"
which they say occur on an everyday basis
in Central America.
A similar mock kidnapping, which oc
cured last Sunday night in Otero House,
upset dorm residents and University offi
cials because students did not realize the
abduction was fake. Students attempted to
rescue the "victim," and police arrived on
the scene.
This time, however, SCAAN modified its
realistic approach so as not to provoke a
violent reaction from student observers.
Graduate student Ben Robinson read from
a script as each "victim" was taken from
her seat and told the audience that "of
course, this is theater."
To present a "more stylized and less
realistic" kidnapping, SCAAN members
carried signs about death squad activities
and did not carry sticks as they did in last
week's mock kidnapping.

Last week, Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons and Police Chief Marvin Herrington
were upset by the effect of the staged kid
nappings. Lyons told SCAAN members that
they should avoid such a realistic presen
tation that could put students in danger.
This time, SCAAN members informed
Lyons, dorm resident assistants and the
Stanford police that they would be staging
another mock kidnapping.
Lyons said that although he wasn't aware
another presentation would take place last
night, he had talked with the group and
knew they planned another staged kidnap
ping.
He said the problem on Sunday night
"wasn't guerrilla theater; it was the
surprise and the reactions this resulted in."
He added that SCAAN members were
"very responsible" and came to him to
discuss their intentions.
SCAAN members yesterday notified the
police, who said it was the group's "re
sponsibility to make sure nothing goes
wrong," according to Heather McClure, a
SCAAN member. Police were not called to
the scene yesterday.
Graduate student Marcia Klotz said that
in addition to raising awareness of alleged
death squad activities, SCAAN members
staged the kidnappings to give the audience
a sense of the terror that the citizens of
El Salvador feel when such an abduction

occurs.
Students in Serra seemed more
entertained than frightened, how
ever, as several remarked "Oh,
it's that group again" and made
comments during the presenta
tion.
Students in Arroyo were more
attentive and watched the mock

abduction in silence, then listened
to graduate student Josie Saldana
as she passed out fliers and recited
statistics about death squad ac
tivities.
Sophomore Katie Hogan, who
witnessed the staged abduction in
Serra, said she had read about
the previous mock kidnappings in
The Daily and found last night's
presentation "kind of hard to take
seriously."
Another student in Serra, how

ever, said that although she knew
what was going on she still found
the staged event "scary."
Arroyo Resident Assistant Jim
Jen said he thought the group
"got their idea across" without
any confusion or panic.
SCAAN members said they
planned to follow up each mock
kidnapping with a dorm presen
tation. According to Lyons,
SCAAN members talked to Otero
residents "for a good two hours"

after Sunday's performance.
Saldana said the reason for a
second presentation was "to con
tinue to stress the connection be
tween U.S. government policies
and the role of citizens, especially
students" who are often a prime
target of abductions in El Sal
vador.
Saldana said the U.S. govern
ment sends $1.5 million a day in
aid to El Salvador.
