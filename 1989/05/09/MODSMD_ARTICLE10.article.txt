# New service offers a free ride for temporarily disabled students
## 
### Suzanne Corkins Staff writer 
Temporarily disabled students no
longer have to foot the bill for the
coveted electric golf carts that whisk
them around campus, thanks to the
efforts of a student volunteer at Stan
ford's Disability Resources Center.
At the start of this quarter, junior
Charles Day established a new service
that provides injured students with free
on-campus rides in the familiar carts
as an alternative to private rental.
Contrary to popular belief, the Uni
versity does not maintain a fleet of golf
carts for the convenience of those com
munity members whose mobility is tem
porarily restricted. Students who sprain

an ankle or similarly injure themselves
must rent carts from off-campus agen
cies at their own expense.
The rental cart company most fre
quently used by Stanford students for
this purpose is the Turf and Industrial
Equipment Company, which charges
$130 for one week or $150 for one
month of rental, $25 of which is a re
fundable deposit.
"A lot of times these companies don't
even have carts available when students
try to get them," leaving students im
mobilized for as long as a week, said
Day.
In response to this problem, the cen
ter now rents its own carts from the
company and has hired eight student
drivers to provide the ride service. Tem

porarily disabled students can arrange
on-campus transportation by calling the
coordinator the day before the service
is required and specifying the times and
destinations in their schedule.
"The main point of this service is
that I think any student should be able
to get to class and if the student is
disabled, a service should be provided,"
Day said.
For community members with per
manent disabilities, the center will con
tinue to operate its van service through
contractor St. Clair Transportation, op
erator of the Marguerite bus line.
Students wishing to make reserva
tions with the golf-cart service should
call Voice Mail number 725-2484.
