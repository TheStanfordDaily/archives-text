# Drawing the line in El Salvador

### Jamie Dycus 
In a lively discussion Friday af
ternoon, two experts on the con
flict now raging in El Salvador
sharply disagreed about whether
the insurgency or the government
there has committed the worst
transgressions against human
rights.
Titled "Human Rights in El Sal
vador" and held in the History
Corner, the discussion pitted
William RatlifT, Latin American
curator at the Hoover Institute,
against Oscar Orellana, chief of
the human rights arm of the
Farabundo Marti National Liber
ation Front, the revolutionary or
ganization currently attempting
to overthrow the Salvadoran gov
ernment.
Presently on a speaking tour of
the United States, Orellana is in
exile from El Salvador.
Since 1979, El Salvador has
been torn by what RatlifT termed
"a seemingly interminable civil
war."
The Salvadoran government

held popular elections March 19,
raising hopes for an improved sit
uation there. However, the polit
ical clime has deteriorated with
the victory of the conservative
Arena party.
Speaking first, RatlifT attacked
the liberation front's human
rights record, but did not attempt
to exonerate the current Salva
doran government of human
rights abuses. He emphasized his
belief that "both sides in this con
flict deserve condemnation."
Speaking through an inter
preter, Orellana countered that in
1988 "there were 4,000 victims
of (government) repression, 4,000
victims of government terror."
Charging the liberation front
with the 1988 assassination of
nine local mayors and numerous
other public officials, RatlifT dis
puted the front's claim that these
killings came as a result of inves
tigations conducted by indepen
dent tribunals of civilians.
The decisions to execute
civilians were made by "self
appointed cliques," RatlifT said,

arguing that no evidence has
emerged to prove that these
tribunals exist.
Orellana stressed that tribunals
do exist and added that secrecy
is essential to the protection of
their members. In addition, Orel
lana said that many of the front's
victims participated in
government-organized massacres.
Turning to the subject of the
recent elections in El Salvador,
Ratliff said the front's transpor
tation blockage on the day of the
election obstructed voting. He
added that even the most liberal
candidates criticized this action as
undermining a free democratic
process.
At one point during the discus
sion, RatlifT argued that the front
mistreats its prisoners and cited
a Red Cross report which com
plained that officials of that or
ganization were denied access to
prisoners of the front.
From a seat in the audience,
one of Orellana's supporters ques
tioned RatlifT about the accuracy
of the report.
