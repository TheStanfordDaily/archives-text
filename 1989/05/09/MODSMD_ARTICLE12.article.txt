# Cowell task force confronts AIDS

### Craig Mallery 
If national surveys hold true
here, there are about 40 Stan
ford students who have con
tracted the HIV virus and will
develop AIDS within 15 years
of their infection, according to
Pat Fabiano, the new director
of the health promotion pro
gram at Cowell Student Health
Center.
In an effort to stem the spread
of the acquired immune
deficiency syndrome on campus,
the University's AIDS Task
Force met yesterday after a five
month break to discuss new ob
jectives and AIDS education
programs.
Last year, Cowell Director Dr.
Paul Walters formed the task
force to establish guidelines for
the University to deal with the
AIDS crisis. However, Fabiano
said "last year's task force only
focused on policy formation"
and was not geared towards im

plementing an educational pro
gram.
In yesterday's meeting, the
task force "articulated strong
educational goals for itself,"
seeking to "elevate the visibility
of the AIDS issue on campus,"
Fabiano said.
She also stressed the need to
coordinate AIDS education for
both the undergraduate and
graduate student population.
"Education is still the number
one prevention tool with AIDS,"
Fabiano said.
Currently the AIDS Educa
tion Project, Residential Educa
tion, Stanford AIDS
Educational Outreach and
Human Biology courses offer ed
ucation about AIDS.
College students are in the
highest risk age groups for all
sexually transmitted diseases
other than AIDS, and their be
havior pattern may also put
them at a high risk of contract
ing the human immuno virus,

according to Fabiano.
"Studies across the country
show that even though college
students on an intellectual level
know a lot about the mechanics
of human sexuality that it is
still very difficult even for col
lege students to translate that
knowledge into safe sexual prac
tices," Fabiano said.
According to Daniel Bao, a
student representative on the
task force and the head of the
Stanford AIDS Educational
Project, one of the difficulties
with AIDS education is that the
HIV virus has an incubation pe
riod of about seven years but
within 15 years 99 percent of
HIV positives show signs of ill
ness.
Bao concluded that although
there may be a high rate of in
fection — studies estimate that
one in every 300 college students
is HIV positive — there are no
immediately visible signs of the
illness.
