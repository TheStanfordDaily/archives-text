## Atlantis: mission accomplished Shuttle lands safely after launching Magellan probe into space 
### 
EDWARDS AIR FORCE BASE, Calif.
(AP) — Space shuttle Atlantis landed
on a gusty desert runway yesterday
after putting U.S. planetary exploration
back on track with the launch of the
unmanned Magellan probe to Venus.
Atlantis touched down at 12:43 p.m.
PDT on a concrete runway at Rogers
Dry Lake after a fiery, hour-long plunge
from orbit 184 miles above Earth.
"Congratulations and nice landing,"
said capsule communicator Frank Cul
bertson in Houston. "You've extended
the shuttle's reach far beyond Earth
orbit now. Commodore Magellan (the
16th century explorer for which the
Venus probe was named) would ap
prove."
"It's good to be back. It's a great
trip," shuttle commander David Walker
told reporters and space agency workers
before the crew flew back to Johnson
Space Center four hours after landing.
"We had a great time on orbit. We
hope you liked what we did," said mis
sion specialist Mary Cleave.
The crew left the orbiter about an

hour after landing and inspected its un
derside, accompanied by senior National
Aeronautics and Space Adnministration
officials. They found little damage to
its thermal tiles.
"The vehicle looks about as clean as
any one that I've ever seen," Richard
Truly, NASA's acting associate admin
istrator for space flight, told a post
landing news conference.
"The Magellan spacecraft is floating
toward the planet Venus to open up a
new era of planetary exploration," Truly
said.
Only about 27,500 of a predicted
100,000 spectators braved baking heat
to see Atlantis dive through the thin,
high clouds and rock the desert with
the its signature twin sonic booms.
About 200 people cheered the
astronauts' return home last night at
Houston's Ellington Field. Even a few
of the astronauts' dogs were on hand
to greet their 9:45 p.m. CDT arrival.
"I can't tell you how grateful all of
us are to those of you who have sup
ported us personally and professionally

through all these many months of train
ing and through, in fact, our whole
careers," Walker told the crowd of
mostly Johnson Space Center workers.
The astronauts left the airport with
their families. They were scheduled to
report back to work today to begin re
viewing their mission.
Just 12 minutes before touchdown,
Atlantis was ordered to land on the
concrete Runway 22 rather than the
hard-packed clay of Runway 17 as dust
devils whipped up by the variable winds
twirled across the lakebed.
Truly said the switch was apparently
ordered because the crosswind angle
was better on the concrete runway for
a test of handling under such conditions
— a precursor to someday resuming
landings at Kennedy Space Center in
Florida.
The crosswinds at landing were
believed to have ranged from 12.6 mph
to 20.7 mph, which would have yielded
"significant" information on such lan
dings, Arnold Aldrich, director of the
shuttle program.
