PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) â€”
Armed men in civilian clothes attacked
thousands of protesters yesterday, firing
automatic rifles to break up an opposi
tion march against election fraud. At
least three people were wounded.
About 15,000 people joined the march
to protest raids by Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega's soldiers, who witnesses said
seized thousands of vote tally sheets
and prevented Sunday's presidential
election from being tabulated.
Opponents said Noriega, Panama's de
facto ruler, ordered the raid on vote
counting centers because the returns
would show his hand-picked presidential
candidate losing to the U.S.-backed op
position by a wide margin.
"The government is confessing that
it lost the elections by seizing the tallies
across the nation," said Ricardo Arias
Calderon, the opposition's vice
presidential candidate.
U.S. observers also said the election
was fraudulent, and former President
Jimmy Carter said Noriega was "steal
ing this election from his own people."
Polls closed 5 p.m. Sunday, but not
until 3 p.m. yesterday did the official
Electoral Tribunal say it had received
votes to count. It did not release totals.

Opposition presidential candidate
Guillermo Endara and government can
didate Carlos Duque both claimed vic
tory and cited rival exit polls as proof.
The new president is to take office
Sept. 1.
The attack came as the two-hour
march was breaking up near the Elec
toral Tribunal.
Endara and other opposition leaders
had left when a car bearing a large
Duque poster drove into the crowd.
Demonstrators threw stones at the
car and the men inside began firing in
the air. People scattered, many flinging
themselves to the ground.
Nearby soldiers also began firing into
the air. The men leaped from their car,
still firing AK-475, carbines and shot
guns.
One was asked whether he was mil
itary or civilian and replied: "We are
from the people."
A local television cameraman was shot
in the chest and seriously wounded. Two
other people were wounded less
seriously but also hospitalized.
After the brief confrontation, the
crowd moved back about 500 yards and
started building bonfires in the street.
The march, led by Endara, began in

an eastern district and headed for the
center of Panama City.
"The people are going to defend their
victory!" Endara declared. "The people
will rule."
In Washington, White House press
secretary Marlin Fitzwater cited reports
of fraud and intimidation. He also
pointed to independent exit polls
showing the opposition slate had well
over 60 per cent and the government
coalition in the "low 205."
The United States has been trying to
oust Noriega, who was indicted on
federal drug trafficking charges last
year in Florida. The United States im
posed economic sanctions, supported
anti-government leaders and reportedly
gave $10 million to the opposition elec
tion campaign.
Noriega, who denies the drug charges,
accused the United States of conspiring
with the opposition to oust him.
An official delegation of election ob
servers sent by President Bush said Nor
iega's soldiers intimidated voters and
carried out widespread fraud.
Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla., an observer
who left early yesterday, said in Miami
the United States "should now consider
the use of force in Panama."
