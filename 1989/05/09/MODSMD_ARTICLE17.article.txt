# Fusion scientists defend findings

### 
LOS ANGELES (AP) - Two
scientists who say they achieved
nuclear fusion at room tempera
ture appeared before nearly 2,000
fellow chemists last night to
counter critics who doubt their
claim.
Martin Fleischmann and B.
Stanley Pons disputed critics who
accused them of sloppy measure
ments, saying scientists who have
bfien unable to duplicate their ex
periments failed to use large
enough electrodes made of tbe
metal palladium.
In their latest experiment, they
said they produced up to 50 times
more energy with their device
than what they had put into it.
The energy was emitted as a burst
of heat that lasted two days, they
said.
In their initial announcement,
in March, they said they had
produced four times the amount
of energy than was used.
Pons, of the University of Utah,
and Fleischmann, of the Univer
sity of Southampton in England,
announced March 23 that they
achieved nuclear fusion in a jar

at room temperature.
Such an accomplishment, if con
firmed, could lead to a cheap and
virtually inexhaustible source of
energy.
The two scientists said they did
it by sending a current through
an apparatus in which a palladium
electrode was wrapped in
platinum and soaked in a con
tainer of heavy water. Heavy
water is made from an isotope of
hydrogen called deuterium and
oxygen.
Last week, delegates at the
American Physical Society meet
ing in Baltimore accused the
Utah-based Pons and
Fleischmann of experimental er
rors.
Some critics said Pons and
Fleischmann were deluded into
thinking that their device
produced excess heat through fu
sion because they measured tem
peratures in the jar improperly
and were actually measuring hot
spots.
However, Fleischmann, appear
ing before 1,800 scientists at a
meeting of the Electrochemical

Society Inc. at the Bonaventure
Hotel here, said there were no
hot spots in his fusion device and
that the excess heat measure
ments were accurate.
He even showed a short movie
of gas bubbling through the fu
sion device to support his claim
that heat was distributed evenly
throughout the apparatus.
"This argument of ineffective
(heat) mixing really doesn't hold
water," Fleischmann said.
Pons said scientists who have
been unable to reproduce the
Pons-Fleischmann team's find
ings failed to use adequately large
palladium electrodes.
Using technical language, he
lashed out at critics who contend
that neutrons allegedly generated
by fusion in the experiment may
really have come from naturally
occurring radon gas and radiation
in the Utah laboratory.
He said that he and
Fleischmann measured gamma
rays — an indication of neutrons
and thus fusion — that came from
their experimental device but were
not present elsewhere in the lab.
