Japan says U.S. 'lost' an H-bomb
TOKYO (AP) — Japan today formally re
quested an explanation from Washington about
a 1965 accident, previously vaguely reported, in
which a U.S. hydrogen bomb was lost in the
Pacific Ocean near one of Japan's islands.
"This happened in international waters so we
have no right to make a loud demand," said a
senior Foreign Ministry official who declined to
be named. "We are just asking the United States
to give us an explanation."
The incident, which Japanese opposition poli
ticians and citizens' groups are claiming was cov
ered up by the U.S. government, occurred in 1965.
The bomb was aboard an A-4 Skyhawk jet that
fell off the carrier Ticonderoga about 80 miles
from a small island in Japan's Ryukyu chain and
200 miles east of the heavily populated island of
Okinawa.
The carrier was on its way from Vietnam to
the Japanese port of Yokosuka.
The Japanese government does not know the
present location and condition of the bomb and
there have been no discussions with the United
States about how to deal with it, said another
Foreign Ministry official, who also spoke on con
dition of anonymity.
Japanese officials said yesterday that the loss

of the bomb was reported in a 1981 U.S. De
partment of Defense listing of nuclear weapons
accidents but there was no indication that it
occurred near inhabited islands. The report said
only that the accident occurred 500 miles from
the Asian mainland.
Fighter jet collision leaves 1 dead
INDEPENDENCE, Calif. (AP) - Two Navy
jet fighters collided in flight yesterday over the
Sierra Nevada, killing one pilot who went down
with his aircraft and injuring the other, officials
said.
The P'A-18 Hornets, based at Point Mugu Naval
Air Station, collided around 11 a.m.
The single-seat jets went down about 45 miles
apart — one into the remote foothills of the Inyo
National Forest, the other into sand dunes to
the south.
Witnesses reported seeing one parachute and
a Navy spokesman said the dead pilot did not
eject from his aircraft.
"We have one confirmed fatality and one in
jured," Navy Lt. Cmdr. Gene Okamoto said from
Point Mugu. "The pilot who was found dead was
found in his aircraft."
The pilots' names were withheld until relatives
could be notified, Okamoto said.
