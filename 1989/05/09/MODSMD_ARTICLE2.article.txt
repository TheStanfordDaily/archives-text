# Fusion confusion: Pauling sides with the physicists

"The tempest in the teapot is warm,
but not by cold fusion," Chemistry
Emeritus Prof. Linus Pauling told The
Daily last week. Pauling, 89, has not
stopped speculating about the newest top
ics in science.
In a letter to be printed this week in
the journal Nature, the Nobel laureate
adds his insight to the growing contro
versy over cold fusion — a phenomenon
first reported by University of Utah
chemists Stanley Pons and Martin
Fleischmann.

In the letter, the chemist Pauling sides
with physicists who are convinced that
the heat which scientists are measuring
is a product of a chemical reaction, not
of nuclear fusion.
Since the first announcement in late
March, physicists and chemists have
divided sharply on this issue. The
physicists think the chemists must be
neglecting some chemical reaction; the
chemists, on the other hand, think the
physicists must be mistaken.
Pauling — famous for determining the
nature of chemical bonds, the molecular
basis of sickle-cell anemia, the impor-

tance of vitamin C, crys
tal structure and much
else — has not performed
any cold fusion experi
ments.
But after hearing
about the cold fusion
confusion — as it is now
often called — Pauling
realized he could offer an
explanation for what

seemed to him to be a chemical reaction.
Yet even though the cold fusion ques
tion is new, Pauling is applying age-old
answers. In his Nature letter, Pauling

cites a paper he wrote in 1938 about the
metallic orbitals of metals like palladium
which would allow this kind of reaction
to occur.
The two-time Nobel Prize winner sug
gests that deuterium atoms from the
heavy water solution are forced into the
palladium cathode and form palladium
dideuteride — a molecule of palladium
with two deuterium atoms attached. This
molecule then decomposes, which leads
to the generation of heat which can even
be explosive.
If it is correct, his theory might explain
some of the unusual observations of other

scientists. The production of heat over a
long period of time could be from the
steady decomposition of the deuteride,
he argues.
Furthermore, the disappearance of the
palladium cathode itself — which Pons
and Fleischmann observed — could be a
result of the violent explosion of the un
stable palladium deuteride.
Verification of Pauling's hypothesis
will only come with further experiments
and calculations. But if Pauling's intui
tions are still as sharp as they were in
1938, the answer may be near in sight.
