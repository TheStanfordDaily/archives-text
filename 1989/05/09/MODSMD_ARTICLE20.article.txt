Smooth run-off election
avoids blunders of past,
promises better future

VOTER TURNOUT may
have taken a nose-dive, but
spirits should be flying
high in the ASSU Elections Com
mission's office following last
week's run-off election.
The special election went off
without a hitch — quite a feat
considering the bloopers that typ
ically beset ASSU elections. From
forgetting to tabulate overseas
ballots to goofing up the candi
dates' list, the history of ASSU
elections — including the original
one this spring — sometimes
frustrates students and may vear
them from the polls.
But this time around, the Elec
tions Commission handled the
job professionally, hopefully
resurrecting some student confi
dence in the ASSU election sys
tem.
Despite a low 2,700-person
voter turnout, largely due to the
runoff, election assistants did
their best to get the word out
about when and where students
could vote. They ran the polling
stations efficiently, enabling stu
dents to mark up their paper bal
lots in as little as two minutes
flat.
Most importantly, in this sec
ond election the Elections Com
mission followed all the rules. No
matter how convoluted or contra
dictory the ASSU Bylaws might
seem, they are the guidelines the
commission has to stick to, even
if it means denying a sympathetic
cause — like the Axe Committee
— its funding.
The Axe Committee brought

home about 56 percent of the
vote, but the commission realized
that this second-round fight for
a student fee request would still
have to fail. The bylaws require
at least 15 percent of the entire
student body to approve a special
fee before it passes; the Axe Com
mittee fell about 200 votes shy.
It's easy to forget and tempting
to overlook the fine print and
seemingly arbitrary stipulations
in the bylaws, but it was the
Elections Commission's job to
uphold the rules.
With the next ASSU election
a solid year away, the Elections
Commission has time to kick
back and reflect on the good and
the bad of Spring Election '89.
Election Commissioner Steve
Krauss, a sophomore, says he
wants to head the commission
again next year. As the man who
brought computer voting to Stan
ford, Krauss has the innovative
ideas and experience to improve
ASSU elections.
But before Krauss takes on the
task, he needs to finetune his
brainchild and determine how the
ASSU can best take advantage of
the Macintosh system.
If the ASSU sticks with com
puter voting, how can it speed
up the process and eliminate the
40-minute wait apparent at some
of the polling stations? Couldn't
the commission use the comput
erized results to determine
demographics of voter turnout
and find out where apathy per
sists?
Krauss and his co-workers
have overcome the blunders of
past Elections Commissions.
Now it's time to look toward
maintaining a professional elec
tion process that restores student
confidence and gets students out
to vote.
