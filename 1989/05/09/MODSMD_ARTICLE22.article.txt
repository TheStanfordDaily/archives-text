## When death is a victory 
### 
There is a right time for everything: A
time to be born, a time to die.. .
— Ecclesiastes 3:2
AS CHILDREN, WE wonder about
death — what is it, how does it
feel, will it hurt. We are told that
death is something that happens to all
of us, that we grow old and eventually
die a peaceful death. The reality is that
this does not hold true for many people.
For some, death comes after much pain
and suffering; it is long-awaited and
much sought-after.
There are many who contract incurable
and debilitating diseases that cause them
endless amounts of pain and suffering
before the sweet victory of death claims
them. Some suffer such great reductions
to the quality of their lives — for example,
a machine does their breathing — that
they wish to die.
Death would be better than the con
stant physical and psychological suffering
they would endure for the remainder of
their lives. Still others have curable dis
eases, but choose to refuse the cure,
knowing that without it they will die.
Should these people be allowed to
choose death over life? Do they have a
constitutional right to make such a de
cision?
The right to die has been addressed
by the courts, which divide treatment
into two categories:
• Life-saving treatment offers hope of
curing the existing medical condition or
of restoring the person's impaired bodily
function.
• Life-sustaining treatment offers no

hope of curing the person with the med
ical problem or restoring the person's
impaired bodily functions, including cases
where machinery is keeping the person
alive.
A "competent" adult has the right to
decide what type of medical treatment
he or she wishes to receive, which in
cludes the right to refuse treatment which
may save or prolong the patient's life.
This right is, however, a fundamental
right and not an absolute right. It is
guaranteed in the penumbras of the Fifth,
Ninth, and 14th Amendments to the Con
stitution.
Cases dealing with the right to die or
euthanasia are given strict judicial scru
tiny. The right of the individual to refuse
life-saving or life-sustaining treatment is
weighed against the interests of the state,
which are the preservation of life, the
prevention of suicide, the maintenance of
the ethical integrity of the medical pro
fession, and the protection of innocent
third parties (i.e., children).
These legal precedents do not involve
cases in which patients are dying from
terminal illnesses, but there is no cure
for their ailment so they cannot hasten
their death by refusing treatment.
Let us consider, for example, those
dying from AIDS. AIDS is a horrible dis
ease that strips many of its victims of
their sanctity, sanity and dignity.
There are those who would like to die
with dignity and without the constant,
unbearable pain they will incur for the
remainder of their lives. They will be
given painkillers which will minimize
their physical suffering, but the fact re

mains that their agony is endless until
death. What choice is left to them?
The only thing that will allow them to
die with dignity is if they take control of
the timing of their death by using what
ever means are at their disposal to end
their life.
This is usually termed suicide, but
given the connotations of the word, it
does not to fit the action. The word eu
thanasia only describes those who take
the life of an individual "for reasons to
be considered merciful." It does not en
compass those who take their own live.
Suicide or inducing ones own death is
not protected by the Fifth, Ninth and
14th amendments. Doesn't a person have
the right to decide the quality of life they
would like to lead? If they find death
preferable in cases where they will endure
much suffering for the rest of their life
(with or without a cure), should they not
be allowed to end their misery?
It is inhumane to allow people to suffer
when they wish that a stop be put to
their suffering. We treat our animals bet
ter than this. If a horse breaks its leg,
many times it is shot. This is considered
a humane act. Why can't we be just as
humane to human beings?
