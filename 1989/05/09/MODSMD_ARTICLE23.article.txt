The SCLC's second
proposal still too
vague, restrictive
On April 19, the Student Conduct
Legislative Council published a second
draft of its interpretations of the Fun
damental Standard regarding free ex
pression and discriminatory harass
ment. While this revised version shows
a marked improvement over the first
draft's vague and expansive language,
the proposal remains inadequate.
First, there are still too many un
clear phrases. As The Daily's editorial
pointed out, the phrase forbidding
"fighting words" which are "commonly
understood" as conveying hatred or
contempt for one's sex, race, color,
handicap, religion, sexual orientation or
national and ethnic origin is no clearer
than the first version's questionable
phrase about "accepted community
standards."
The nature of the University is such
that a consensus in antithetical to its
educational goals of fostering diversity
and letting those who are not in the
majority speak their minds. As a
result, it is difficult to be more specific
than the phrases "commonly under
stood" and "accepted community stand
ards." Yet, the phrases must be spe
cific to have an effect.
The new proposal also prohibits cer
tain types of vilification directed at "an
individual or a small number of indi
viduals." We are left to guess just how
many such a group would include.
Even though the SCLC has now
attempted to clearly draw the line be
tween free speech and harrassment, the
vague phrases which remain in the
new proposal make it difficult to know
beforehand whether or not a specific
expression violates the Fundamental
Standard. Unclear restrictions upon
what one can say within the Univer
sity will inevitably lead to hesitancy on

the part of almost anyone expressing
an opinion.
I can see this hesitancy being espe
cially pronounced among those who are
trying their hardest to be well
meaning. People who have no intention
whatsoever of insulting someone may
fail to speak up about race or any of
the other areas outlined in the pro
posal just to be safe.
Ambiguities regarding what one's
allowed to say — especially in pas
sionate intellectual debate — will add
to the chill that already frequently
affects Stanford discussions on racial
and other sensitive issues.
There is an additional problem with
the vagueness of the new draft. It is
unclear whether the students involved
in the Ujamaa incident would have
been punished if this new interpreta
tion had been in effect. The SCLC
seems to have danced around this
issue.
Although the University is a private
institution which needs not abide by
the First Amendment, I believe that it
should not enact anything which could
not stand up in court outside Stanford.
I believe the SCLC's proposal fails in
this respect.
As lofty as the goals of this proposal
are, the new interpretation seems to be
a hindrance upon free expression, and
thus a hindrance upon Stanford's abil
ity to function as a place for the ex
change of ideas.
The most troubling part of the
SCLC's proposal, however, is the lack
of student response. I have witnessed
little, if any, discussion for or against
the proposal. Considering the vehement
protest the first version aroused, this
current lack of response is surprising
and unnerving.
If you care about being able to ex
press yourself, do so. Forward any
comments for or against the second
proposal to Prof. George Parker, School
of Business, by May 10.

Facts clearly show
Review didn't get
fair consideration
In his May 2 letter, Chris Adamson
denied that the Publications Board has
a political bias, and he described my
concerns to that effect as "amusingly
incorrect."
I find this odd considering that even
a cursory examination of the Publica
tions Board's allocations suggests such
a bias exists. While The Stanford
Review received only $500, Real News
was given $1,000; Stanford Commen
tary, $1,014; Reasonable Doubt,
$1,800; and Dial Tone, $2,723.
The Stanford Review prints more
issues and is more widely read than
any of these other publications. By any
reasonable standard The Review should
receive at least comparable amounts of
funding.
Unlike Adamson we don't find this
sort of political discrimination amusing.

As of now, the Draw
creates stress and
needs revamping
After just having gone through the
Draw for the first time, I'm really glad
it's over.
The Draw caused me a lot of stress,
and I almost got into fights with my
friends who I was drawing with. I feel
that I'm not the only one who has
gone through this stress, but another
system might alleviate some of this.
If we were to draw our numbers
first, then submit our Draw cards, it
would be better than the way it is

done currently where we have to fill
out our Draw cards before we the
number. This way, we would have
some idea what places we could get
into when we are deciding on our
Draw card.
If we drew a low number, we
wouldn't have to argue about places
that we couldn't conceivably live in.
Deciding on the last couple of choices
was the hardest part since we had to
decide which house had the least worst
aspects.
But we drew a good number so all
this arguing and stress was in vain. If
we had drawn a low number, we could
have concentrated more on the lower
Draw houses and made a better deci
sion in that area.
Drawing the numbers first would be
just as fast since we could draw the
numbers in early March and that
wouldn't involve making any decisions.
Then our Draw card could be due in
April at the same time it is now.
After we've gotten our number, we
could spend time looking more care
fully at the houses wheffe we have a
chance of getting in.
I hope that someone in charge of the
Draw sees this, or that enough stu
dents support it since I believe it is a
valid improvement to the Draw. The
Draw may always have problems, but I
think this method may reduce a lot of
the stress of arguing about Draw
choices.

than the first version's questionable
phrase about "accepted community
standards."
The nature of the University is such
that a consensus in antithetical to its
educational goals of fostering diversity
and letting those who are not in the
majority speak their minds. As a
result, it is difficult to be more specific
than the phrases "commonly under
stood" and "accepted community stand
ards." Yet, the phrases must be spe
cific to have an effect.
The new proposal also prohibits cer
tain types of vilification directed at "an
individual or a small number of indi
viduals." We are left to guess just how
many such a group would include.
Even though the SCLC has now
attempted to clearly draw the line be
tween free speech and harrassment, the
vague phrases which remain in the
new proposal make it difficult to know
beforehand whether or not a specific
expression violates the Fundamental
Standard. Unclear restrictions upon
what one can say within the Univer
sity will inevitably lead to hesitancy on

the part of almost anyone expressing
an opinion.
I can see this hesitancy being espe
cially pronounced among those who are
trying their hardest to be well
meaning. People who have no intention
whatsoever of insulting someone may
fail to speak up about race or any of
the other areas outlined in the pro
posal just to be safe.
Ambiguities regarding what one's
allowed to say — especially in pas
sionate intellectual debate — will add
to the chill that already frequently
affects Stanford discussions on racial
and other sensitive issues.
There is an additional problem with
the vagueness of the new draft. It is
unclear whether the students involved
in the Ujamaa incident would have
been punished if this new interpreta
tion had been in effect. The SCLC
seems to have danced around this
issue.
Although the University is a private
institution which needs not abide by
the First Amendment, I believe that it
should not enact anything which could
not stand up in court outside Stanford.
I believe the SCLC's proposal fails in
this respect.
As lofty as the goals of this proposal
are, the new interpretation seems to be
a hindrance upon free expression, and
thus a hindrance upon Stanford's abil
ity to function as a place for the ex
change of ideas.
The most troubling part of the
SCLC's proposal, however, is the lack
of student response. I have witnessed
little, if any, discussion for or against
the proposal. Considering the vehement
protest the first version aroused, this
current lack of response is surprising
and unnerving.
If you care about being able to ex
press yourself, do so. Forward any
comments for or against the second
proposal to Prof. George Parker, School
of Business, by May 10.

Facts clearly show
Review didn't get
fair consideration
In his May 2 letter, Chris Adamson
denied that the Publications Board has
a political bias, and he described my
concerns to that effect as "amusingly
incorrect."
I find this odd considering that even
a cursory examination of the Publica
tions Board's allocations suggests such
a bias exists. While The Stanford
Review received only $500, Real News
was given $1,000; Stanford Commen
tary, $1,014; Reasonable Doubt,
$1,800; and Dial Tone, $2,723.
The Stanford Review prints more
issues and is more widely read than
any of these other publications. By any
reasonable standard The Review should
receive at least comparable amounts of
funding.
Unlike Adamson we don't find this
sort of political discrimination amusing.

As of now, the Draw
creates stress and
needs revamping
After just having gone through the
Draw for the first time, I'm really glad
it's over.
The Draw caused me a lot of stress,
and I almost got into fights with my
friends who I was drawing with. I feel
that I'm not the only one who has
gone through this stress, but another
system might alleviate some of this.
If we were to draw our numbers
first, then submit our Draw cards, it
would be better than the way it is

done currently where we have to fill
out our Draw cards before we the
number. This way, we would have
some idea what places we could get
into when we are deciding on our
Draw card.
If we drew a low number, we
wouldn't have to argue about places
that we couldn't conceivably live in.
Deciding on the last couple of choices
was the hardest part since we had to
decide which house had the least worst
aspects.
But we drew a good number so all
this arguing and stress was in vain. If
we had drawn a low number, we could
have concentrated more on the lower
Draw houses and made a better deci
sion in that area.
Drawing the numbers first would be
just as fast since we could draw the
numbers in early March and that
wouldn't involve making any decisions.
Then our Draw card could be due in
April at the same time it is now.
After we've gotten our number, we
could spend time looking more care
fully at the houses wheffe we have a
chance of getting in.
I hope that someone in charge of the
Draw sees this, or that enough stu
dents support it since I believe it is a
valid improvement to the Draw. The
Draw may always have problems, but I
think this method may reduce a lot of
the stress of arguing about Draw
choices.

The SCLC's second
proposal still too
vague, restrictive
On April 19, the Student Conduct
Legislative Council published a second
draft of its interpretations of the Fun
damental Standard regarding free ex
pression and discriminatory harass
ment. While this revised version shows
a marked improvement over the first
draft's vague and expansive language,
the proposal remains inadequate.
First, there are still too many un
clear phrases. As The Daily's editorial
pointed out, the phrase forbidding
"fighting words" which are "commonly
understood" as conveying hatred or
contempt for one's sex, race, color,
handicap, religion, sexual orientation or
national and ethnic origin is no clearer
than the first version's questionable
phrase about "accepted community
standards."
The nature of the University is such
that a consensus in antithetical to its

and letting those who are not in the
