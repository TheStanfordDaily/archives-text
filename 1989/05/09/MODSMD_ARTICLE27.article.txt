## What they are really doing behind the scaffolding: New-improved Tresidder will be 'real' student union 
### Martha Brockenbrough Staff writer 
Some buildings, like some
people, are "bad seeds." Others
just take a little extra time to
bloom. Tresidder Union re
garded as a problem child just a
year after its 1959 birth may
finally blossom.
Vintage minutes from a 1960
Tresidder Board of Directors
meeting describe plans to expand
the building to better serve the
needs of its users. At last, 29 years
later, the University has provided
the funds for such a project.
A $2.1 million upper-deck ex
pansion project fruit of that
funding and the first step in the
plan to convert Tresidder into a
long-demanded "student hang
out" will be complete May 18
when the 10,000 square foot ad
dition is officially opened.
Academic Information Re
sources called LOTS II until
this year is tentatively sched
uled to move into the new addition
a week after Commencement. The
new space is directly above AlR's
present location. Following AlR's
relocation, the Computer Science
Department will move into offices
in the addition.
"Our schedule is driven by the
delivery of furniture ... a
modular panel system with indi
vidual work surfaces," AIR Divi
sion Director Sean Welsh said.
Relocating AIR and the Com
puter Science Department will
touch off a frenzy of reorganiza
tion within Tresidder. With nearly
double its current floor space, The
Store will fill the gap left by. AIR.
The video games and the outdoor
recreation club will move closer
to the relocated convenience mar
ket.
These shifts will help accom
modate construction of a new,
self-sustaining kitchen for the
Coffee House. According to Assoc.
Director of Tresidder Paul
Szczesiul, "The Coffee House was
originally a ping-pong room. It
has no real food production facil
ity."
Dubbed "Phase One" by
Szczesiul, the relocation of The
Store and the expansion of the
Coffee House could be complete
by the fall of 1990.
"The Coffee House will be ex
panded, but not greatly. We don't
want to tamper with what works,"
Szczesiul said.
A pub-style cafe slated for con
struction would share the Coffee
House kitchen. Tentatively named
"The Camino Real Cafe," the pub

To 'open up' Tres
idder, the planning
committees envi
sion a 'boulevard'
cutting through the
center of the build
ing, possibly
flanked by a flower
shop and a
newsstand.

"will be a place where people can
get together and throw peanuts
on the floor," according to Tres
idder Union Board Chair Brad
Chick.
Because some musicians have
complained about the acoustics in
the Coffee House, and patrons
have called the noisier program
ming intrusive, performing artists
will be booked into the Camino
Real Cafe where there will be a
stage built to accommodate them.
Sororities and unhoused fraterni
ties may also be allowed to use
the pub for their functions, Chick
said.
Eventually, The Grand Market
Place would expand its kitchen
into the current location of The
Store. With this expansion would
also come some "cleaning up and
simplifying" of the cafeteria-style
restaurant, Szczesiul said. Re
search by consultants indicated
that "too much variety was of
fered" to efficiently accommodate
current volumes of customers at
the Grand Market Place.
The larger kitchen will stream
line some of the inefficiencies,
Szczesiul explained. Because of
"facilities problems," and a
greater need for seating, plans in
clude eliminating the Corner
Pocket, he added. A proposed
glass-enclosed trellis wrapping
around the side of Tresidder
which faces White Plaza would
also house more tables and chairs.

To fill the service gap created
by the elimination of the Corner
Pocket, a dual frozen yogurt and
candy shop would share a space
with Baker Street. A pizzeria
"where you can see the pizza
being made" could operate from
the renovated Grand Market
Place, Szczesiul added.

To "open up" Tresidder, the
planning committees envision a
"boulevard" cutting through the
center of the building, possibly
flanked by a flower shop and a
newsstand. Other improvements
include a permanent Patio Grill
to replace the one currently
operated from portable carts.
"The same product would be
produced," Szczesiul explained,
"only it would be more efficient
and serve more people."
Although the upper-deck expan
sion project is one small step
toward the creation of the "real
union" envisioned by Tresidder's
Union Board a committee of
faculty, staff, and students and
the directors of Tresidder, it con
stitutes a giant leap for AIR.
AIR computer specialist Randy

Melen said he hopes the new space
will allow the center to double its
number of Macintoshes during
fall quarter.
At the same time, the Computer
Science Department, located next
to AIR, will move upstairs to of
fices around the perimeter of the
addition.
Gerda de Werk, an administra
tive assistant in the department,
said she hopes to be relocated in
time for summer quarter.
Once AIR and the Computer
Science Department are relocated,
Szczesiul said he intends to work
with the Union Board and the
Provost towards finalizing the
renovation plans over the next few
months.
Pending secure financing, the
selection of an architect from the

12 currently under consideration,
and approval from the Board of
Trustees, the massive interior
face-lift may begin as early as next
January.
"We'll blow out the lower walls
of the lobby," Szczesiul said,
noting the University policy which
mandates that Tresidder may
only be modified within its exist
ing structural confines. Because
of this mandate, the upper deck
addition represents the final fron
tier of physical expansion which
Tresidder can accommodate.
Hired consultants from Burlin
game and Portland researched
Tresidder for nine months to
overcome this policy and other re
strictions. Physical constraints,
however, are only one of the
obstacles slowing the gestation of
their brainchild, Chick said.

The planning committee is also
concerned with the logistics
construction ideally should incon
venience as few users as possible
and financing of the renova
tion.
"We can't afford it all at once,"
said Szczesiul of the projected $6
million price tag. He explained
that the price included construc
tion of everything the planning
committees envisioned an un
likely occurrence.
Funding will come from three
sources the University Facili
ties Reserve General Fund,
financing from contractors
interested in operating out of
Tresidder and loans from the Uni
versity, Szczesiul said. These
loans would be repaid with reve
nue generated by the new restau
rants and shops.

If all goes as planned, the first floor of Tresldder Union will be turned Into a diner's nirvana. The renovation will spawn expanded versions of
the Coffee House and The Store, as well as a new eatery, the Camino Real Cafe, which promises to be a place where "people can get together
and throw peanuts on the floor," according to Tresldder Union Board Chair Brad Chick.
