Nadine Gordimer is the most unnerv
ing of novelists.
She habitually stands well back from
her fictional material, resisting the im
pulse to focus tightly on a character,
even in the most dramatic situations.
Instead, she presents her readers with
broad, inclusive portraits how a so
ciety was rocked by the unjust trial of
a single upright man; or the seething
world that might come to pass in South
Africa in the furious wake of the Na
tional Party's rule.
There is always the sense that she is
directing our vision a little to the side
of the main characters, reminding us
always that the actions of one person
don't affect only that person they
affect the entire world.
It is this point that she addresses
again and again in her new collection
of essays essays that, unlike her
novels, are sharp and focused in the
extreme. Her constant awareness is that
the writer is the voice of his or her
society, that the writer exists first and
most importantly as witness.
This idea takes on peculiar clarity for
a writer such as Gordimer, writing from
and about a country where books (in
cluding Gordimer's own) are routinely
banned, and where all literature is
viewed by those in power as suspect, a
means to undermine the morality of
the nation. Indeed, Gordimer herself
would in some measure agree with this
view. "The creative act," she writes in
the title essay, "is not pure. History
evidences it. Ideology demands it. Soci
ety exacts it."
Her point, in this essay and elsewhere,
is that the writer is obliged to put forth
a double vision. The first bears witness
to the community for and from which
he or she writes, but the second must
be the writer's own, that view not sub
ject to ideology or any arbiters other
than the writer's own values.
This is not such a simple point as it
seems. South Africa, Gordimer points
out, is seeing a nascence of gifted black
writers who feel compelled to write not
only about their experiences of oppres
sion, but to write about them in the
accepted argot. In "Living in the Inter
regnum," Gordimer says, "The problem
is that agitprop ... has become the first
contemporary art form that many black
South Africans feel they can call their
own. It fits their anger; and this is
taken as proof that it is an organic
growth of black creation freeing itself,
instead of the old shell that it is, in
habited many times by the anger of
others."
The essays vary in tone in some

she is angry, in some puzzled and
subdued, and her travel pieces are filled
with humor and a sharp eye for the
implied drama of observed lives. They
cover some 30 years of extraordinary
upheaval in South African history,
chronicling its rise by one morally
obliged to support with all her energy
a new regime that might force her to
quit the country she has struggled, all
her writing life, to save.
The collection is divided into thirds.
The first section (after a charming essay
that stands alone about her youth and
earliest experiences as a writer), called
"A Writer in South Africa," contains
essays relating to specific incidents in
South Africa the banning of the ANC,
the Bram Fischer trial. Carefully foot
noted, these essays serve as a fine text
on the history of South Africa since the
early 19505. They serve as a personal
statement for Gordimer as well, reflect
ing the change in her attitudes over the
years and the struggles and the
bloodshed. "Africa is going through a
stage when it passionately prefers its
own mistakes to successes (or mistakes)
that are not its own," she wrote in
1959. By 1976, writing her "Letter from
Johannesburg," she comments, "It
seems old white adversaries might be
accepted but white liberals will never
be forgiven for their inability to come
to power and free blacks."
The second section, "A Writer in
Africa," also covers a number of years,
from her return trip to Egypt in 1958
to her report on Transkei in 1977. The
essays are edged in Gordimer's political
sense, that events at the market reflect
the essence of a country, the lives and
values of its people, how they will
weather the uncertain seas ahead.
In "Mon Dieu, It Changes," about
Ghana and the Ivory Coast, she writes,
"One gets into the habit of looking for
omens a private text-for-the-day, a
warning? as one moves around in
Accra. Perhaps there will be a message
to be interpreted only by oneself ... in
the next taxi one climbs into. One af
ternooon there was. Just two words that
were the last words on everything I
had seen and heard and done. 'lt
changes.'"
The final section, "Living in the In
terregnum," contains the essays that
examine most closely the knot between
writing and politics. In these Gordimer
is writing perhaps at her best, examin
ing the need for a people to write and
read its own experience, to voice what
it knows of life and pronounce judgment
of that life.
In "The Essential Gesture," perhaps
her clearest distillation of these compli
cated and intertwined values she writes,
"ours is a period when few can claim
the absolute value of a writer without
reference to a context of responsibili
ties." As the crises we are expected to
bear in this century accumulate, there

is little room for "mere" art, for disen
gagement.
"Loyalty is an emotion, integrity a
conviction adhered to out of moral
values. Therefore I speak here not of
loyalties but integrities, in my recogni
tion of society's right to make demands
on the writer as equal to that of the
writer's commitment to his artistic vi
sion ..." For that vision cannot be ex
tracted from the society that produced
it: Our language and our ideals are
forged in the world we live in every
day. We learn these things what we
speak, and what we speak for simul
taneously, and cannot treat them as if
they were divisible.
And so it is that Gordimer is finally
able to write simply, "Art is on the side
of the oppressed." She goes on, "Think
before you shudder at the simplistic
dictum and its heretical definition of
the freedom of art. For if art is freedom
of the spirit, how can it exist within
the oppressors? ... In Poland, where
are the poets who sing the epic of the
men who have broken Solidarity? In
South Africa, where are the writers who
produce brilliant defences of apartheid?"
This collection of essays is impas
sioned, intelligent, challenging. It is a
superb book for students of revolution
or Africa, or for writers. It is an excellent
book for anyone interested in Gordimer,
or the issues of writing from inside
oppression. And it is an essential book
for understanding the vision and pas
sion of one of the finest writers of our
time.
