Reviewed by James Mills
Chinua Achebe's Africa is at a cross
road, with each accessible path pointing
toward an uncertain future. Africa's nas
cent nation-states still struggle with the
formidable task of defining themselves
in the wake of centuries of European
colonialism. Questions regarding the
types of societies Africans should em
ulate prove numerous and increasingly
difficult to answer in the face of mount
ing social and political problems endemic
to developing nations.
The onus of modernization proves it
self to be unwieldly under growing
mountains of foreign debt and competing
political interests. Achebe's own Nigeria
is but one among the many African na
tions in the throws of these "growing
pains.','
In "Anthills of the Savannah," Ac
hebe's most recent novel, the author
portrays not only his own nation's pres
ent difficulties, but those of his fellow
Africans as well, in the fictional West
African nation of Kangan. The result is
a compelling and enlightening story of
political intrigue and human drama.
Kangan (like Nigeria), a former
British colony, has recently witnessed a
military coup. The young army colonel
who takes the reins of power has done
so in the wake of popular dissatisfaction
with the civilian government. He creates
a new government with the help of two
college friends who aid him in the forma
tion of a ruling cabinet. The two friends,
Christopher Oriko and Ikem Osodi, be
come respectively, the Minister of Infor
mation and the editor of the
government-run National Gazette. Ac
hebe reveals through flashbacks the first
name of the colonel (Sam), but he is
usually referred to as His Excellency.
The first third of the novel is pre
sented in the different voices of the char
acters themselves, the chapters
alternating between Chris and Ikem and
Beatrice Okoh, Chris's lover. Deftly han
dling this potentially awkward format,
Achebe captivates the reader by allowing
the story to unfold naturally through
personal vignettes of the same events
seen through the eyes of these three
narrators.
His Excellency, in what can be said
to be the typically comical (if only we
didn't have so many real-life examples)
method of megalomaniacal despots,
abandons his ambitious plans for
idealism and reform in favor of soldify
ing his autocratic regime. A referendum
to name him as leader for life fails, and
the recriminations begin.
Chris and Ikem become particular tar
gets because of their less than blind
support for the matter. Ikem is especially
singled out for taking his annual vaca

tion during the referendum instead of
editorializing in its favor.
In the latter two-thirds of the novel,
as the political situation in Bassa, Kan
gan's capital, rapidly deteriorates,
Beatrice becomes the central figure. She
is a senior assistant secretary in the
Ministry of Finance and a graduate of,
Queen Mary College, University of Lon
don.
Achebe paints a sensitive portrait of
an African woman's struggle between
the values of her own society and those
imposed by her European education. De
mands placed upon her by circumstances .
beyond her control compel her to make,
unfamiliar decisions.
Through Beatrice, Achebe makes the
reader think about the position of
women in a modern African society by
pointing out and answering disturbing
questions about the condition of women
around the world.
Chinua Achebe, in this his 13th novel,
has given us a captivating story showing
the human side of what those of us in
the First World seldom give thought to
as we turn our backs to many of the
problems we have helped create and con
tinue to fuel.
Despite Achebe's biting sarcasm and
irony, there is no bitterness in his lucid
prose; if anything, the novel leaves the
reader with an unshakable (if somber)
sense of his optimism.
In a speech to a gathering of university
students, Achebe's autobiographical
counterpart Ikem imparts these words:
"Writers in the Third World context
must stop at the stage of documenting
social problems but move to the higher
responsibility of proffering prescrip
tions." Although Achebe himself does
not offer specific prescriptions in "An
thills of the Savannah," his book is
clearly a call for action. It is also a great
read and can be had for $7.95 at your
local bookstore.
