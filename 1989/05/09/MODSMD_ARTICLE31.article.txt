## For Cox, the waiting is over Catcher shakes early slump, regains starting position

Waiting for the Sun.
It's the title of a song by The Doors,
a favorite group of Cardinal catcher Eric
Cox. It's also how he characterizes the
first half of his 1989 baseball season.
"[Waiting] is difficult, and it was com
pounded by the fact I hadn't played
well. Plus the team wasn't playing well,
so there was a lot of tension," Cox said.
"The whole mood out there was frus
tration, and I was just one of the players
that was frustrated. It was something
that I had to work through in my head."
Cox, a junior, had been expected to
fill the large shoes of Doug Robbins,
who vacated the catcher position with
his graduation last June.
Unfortunately for Cox, his season did
not start out the way he'd planned.
Cox started the first three games of
the Stanford season, playing poorly in
three straight Cardinal losses. Then, in
the first of a three-game series with
Loyola-Marymount, Cox was involved
in a frightening collision at home plate.
He suffered a mild concussion and
missed the rest of the game and the
series.
In each of the next two weekend se
ries, Cox would start but one game.
"It was pretty disappointing. I wasn't
happy with the way I played at the
beginning of the season. I'd worked
really hard over the summer to come
back and start out the season and play
well," Cox said.
"I had a couple bad games and I was
out of the lineup, and it didn't look like
I would have a real good chance to get
back in. It wasn't the way that I had
played it out in my mind."
Freshman Troy Tall man — one of
the most highly touted recruits in the
country — became the Cardinal's num
ber one catcher, while Cox saw only

limited action.
"I decided that I was just going to
keep working extra hard, and when I
did get my chance, I was going to really
show them — whether it was in batting
practice, a pinch-hit appearance or a
start against a right-handed pitcher —
that I could play," Cox said.
Had Tallman taken off, Cox may
never have gotten his second chance,
but the freshman, like the rest of the
Cardinal, struggled through a dismal
first half of the year.
Cox would wait for the sun no longer.
His first big hit came on March 7
against Santa Clara — 25 games into
a 58-game season. Cox had the game
winning RBI against the Broncos, a vic
tory that helped snap the Cardinal's
three-game losing streak. Cox was be
ginning to prove himself to everyone,
but most of all to himself.
"That first game (against Santa
Clara) was a step in the right direction.

It's a situation that every day I got
another start, I got more confidence in
my ability. I think it was sort of a
gradual process," Cox said.
On April 9 at Arizona State, Cox
proved he wasn't affected by the mas
sive collision at home plate earlier in
the season. Devil catcher Dave Robson
— a freshman built like a small Sher
man tank — put a similar hit on Cox,
who withstood the impact and held onto
the ball for the out.
The sun has shone on Cox ever since.
He played arguably his best baseball
of the season last weekend against Cal
ifornia. He went 4-for-8 in the series,
starting all three games against the
Bears. He cut down all three baserun
ners that attempted to run on him. He
is 6-for-19 (.316) in his last seven games,
including a homer, double and two RBI.
And it appears the sun won't set again
on Cox until the season is over.

weekend in the Cardinal's three games against California.
