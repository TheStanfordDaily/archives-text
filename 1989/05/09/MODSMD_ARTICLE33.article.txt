Terry Taylor and Scott Meinert, Car
dinal cut-ups on the Stanford
men's basketball team, stole the
show at the annual Cage Club award's
banquet last week.
This, if you are acquainted with the
point-guard tandem, is not necessarily
suprising.
But it was the surprising way they
stole the show that, as much as Todd
Lichti's wonderous, miraculous (and
don't forget ambidexterous) talents, ex
plain the success of the 1988-89 Cardinal.
And in many ways, it was a banquet
that, though quite enjoyable, needed to
be pilfered. In short, it was kind of a
strange night.
The banquet began with an auction to
raise money for the basketball program
and help pay for the banquet itself. Items
up for bid ranged from a poster-sized
photograph of redshirt center Lang
Meyer, to various sets of golf clubs, to
boxes of asparagus.
If the tone of the evening had been set
there, then I would be writing about the
mysterious powers of asparagus to
generate NCAA tournament basketball
teams. Fortunately, Taylor and Meinert
walk through life a bit more tone-deaf
than the rest of us.
* But it was still to be a long journey
from the silly to the serious, and the
significance of the evening.
As the 370 people in attendance filed
from the auction into the dining room,
emcee Bob Murphy of KCBS radio im
' mediately took to the podium and, before

everyone had even sat down, began firing
out Vegas-style barbs left and right.
The temptation is to say, "Bob, don't
quit your day job," but I'm not sure
Murph isn't better suited to work
alongside Wayne Newton and Charo.
Things remained odd even when Murph
took a brief time out to eat dinner with
the rest of us.
The lights were dimmed and the "Stan
ford Basketball '89" videotape was
shown. Among the highlights of this tape
were pictures of Hoover Tower and talk
about how Stanford was less than a half
hour from San Francisco. Interviews with
the players focused not as much on the
season as on Stanford University in gen
eral.
Yes, there were many exciting basket
ball plays weaved into the presentation,
but there was no way to hide that this
was purely a recruiting tape. There's
nothing wrong with this, but it would
have been more appropriate at a banquet

honoring Stanford basketball 1988-89 to
have shown a separate video that con
centrated on the story of Stanford bas
ketball 1988-89.
Little did I know that the players would
communicate — not tell, communicate
— that story themselves.
Murph soon returned to the stage.
The players were then called up
one-by-one to meet with Murphy,
and suddenly we were all watching a Bob
Hope Christmas special.
You know how Hope gets the college
Ail-American football team on his show?
One by one, each player meets with Hope
and plays Hope's foil as he makes some
tired joke about the player's athletic
prowess or shoe size?
Well, Murph was Bob Hope redux.
A joke about Andrew Vlahov's house
habits. A joke about Eric Reveno's vert ical
leap. Yeah fans, Murph was in command.
Brooke Shields came out and sang with
Murph. Afterward, he said to her,
"Brooke, you sure have the height to play
basketball, and you're better-looking than
these clowns. You can start on my team
anytime, heh heh heh."
Well, not exactly, but you get the idea.
But then, Scott Meinert came up. The
confident-on-the-edge-of-cocky Meinert is
the kind of guy who never even seems
to take himself seriously, although one
never doubted his tenacity when he was
on the court. Still, it seemed likely that
the class clown would team with Murph
to bring the banquet silliness to a peak.

But Meinert, as he is wont to do, went
left as everyone was going right. When
Murph attempted to engage him in some
banter, Meinert, a fifth-year senior who
is actually nearing his 24th birthday,

choked up. It was, quite frankly, a side
of Meinert most of us have never seen,
and it showed better than any videotape
could have how pervasive throughout the
men's basketball team were the finest
qualities of maturity.
Soon after, it was Terry Taylor's turn.
Like Meinert, a chance for the crack
ling, fist-pumping Taylor to go one-on
one with Murph seemed like a natural.
Murph's vivacity was diminished but
not deflated. He made a joke. Taylor made
a comeback remark. Then a second time,
then a third. Then Murph made another.
Taylor didn't respond. Not right away.
As he was to communicate to us
through sputtering half-sentences and
thank-yous choking out through tears,

all the years of basketball for Taylor, a
coach's son, a player too short and too
slow to excel in a sport tailored to the
tall and fleet, a man who maybe was
never taken completely seriously by
anyone outside of the members of this
Stanford basketball team, all those years,
which went by with the flick of a back
spinning shot from beyond the 3-point
line, all those years were ending here.
Now.
All the jokes were over.
The gentle giant, Howard Wright,
helped finish up this melancholy affair
which, though it was upwards of five
hours, maybe should have been
videotaped as well.
Stanford basketball isn't going to go
very far away, even with the departure
of six seniors, and it will be back sooner
than you think. Stanford is shooting to
finish in the top three in the Pacific 10
Conference in 1989-90. I would say that
even the top five in the improving Pac-10
would be a great achievement.
But through the mist of the tears, one
could see that Stanford Basketball '89
was special in a way that words can't
describe, on paper or at a podium. Nearly
two months after the season ended,
nearly four hours after the banquet began
on a frolicsome note, there was a simple,
serene message. The Stanford men's bas
ketball team was an amazing collection
of people.
As Bob Hope would say, "Thanks for
the memories."

Nearly two months after
the season ended, there
was a simple, serene mes
sage. The Stanford men's
basketball team was an
amazing collection of
people.

which, though it was upwards of five
hours, maybe should have been
videotaped as well.
Stanford basketball isn't going to go
very far away, even with the departure
of six seniors, and it will be back sooner
than you think. Stanford is shooting to
finish in the top three in the Pacific 10
Conference in 1989-90. I would say that
even the top five in the improving Pac-10
would be a great achievement.
But through the mist of the tears, one
could see that Stanford Basketball '89
was special in a way that words can't
describe, on paper or at a podium. Nearly
two months after the season ended,
nearly four hours after the banquet began
on a frolicsome note, there was a simple,
serene message. The Stanford men's bas
ketball team was an amazing collection
of people.
As Bob Hope would say, "Thanks for
the memories."

Terry Taylor and Scott Meinert, Car
dinal cut-ups on the Stanford
men's basketball team, stole the
show at the annual Cage Club award's
banquet last week.
This, if you are acquainted with the
point-guard tandem, is not necessarily
suprising.
But it was the surprising way they
stole the show that, as much as Todd
Lichti's wonderous, miraculous (and
don't forget ambidexterous) talents, ex
plain the success of the 1988-89 Cardinal.
And in many ways, it was a banquet
that, though quite enjoyable, needed to
be pilfered. In short, it was kind of a
strange night.
The banquet began with an auction to
raise money for the basketball program
and help pay for the banquet itself. Items
up for bid ranged from a poster-sized
photograph of redshirt center Lang
Meyer, to various sets of golf clubs, to
boxes of asparagus.
If the tone of the evening had been set
there, then I would be writing about the
mysterious powers of asparagus to
generate NCAA tournament basketball
teams. Fortunately, Taylor and Meinert
walk through life a bit more tone-deaf
than the rest of us.
* But it was still to be a long journey
from the silly to the serious, and the
significance of the evening.
As the 370 people in attendance filed
from the auction into the dining room,
emcee Bob Murphy of KCBS radio im
' mediately took to the podium and, before

everyone had even sat down, began firing
out Vegas-style barbs left and right.
The temptation is to say, "Bob, don't
quit your day job," but I'm not sure
Murph isn't better suited to work
alongside Wayne Newton and Charo.
Things remained odd even when Murph
took a brief time out to eat dinner with
the rest of us.
The lights were dimmed and the "Stan
ford Basketball '89" videotape was
shown. Among the highlights of this tape
were pictures of Hoover Tower and talk
about how Stanford was less than a half
hour from San Francisco. Interviews with
the players focused not as much on the
season as on Stanford University in gen
eral.
Yes, there were many exciting basket
ball plays weaved into the presentation,
but there was no way to hide that this
was purely a recruiting tape. There's
nothing wrong with this, but it would
have been more appropriate at a banquet

honoring Stanford basketball 1988-89 to
have shown a separate video that con
centrated on the story of Stanford bas
ketball 1988-89.
Little did I know that the players would
communicate — not tell, communicate
— that story themselves.
Murph soon returned to the stage.
The players were then called up
one-by-one to meet with Murphy,
and suddenly we were all watching a Bob
Hope Christmas special.
You know how Hope gets the college
Ail-American football team on his show?
One by one, each player meets with Hope
and plays Hope's foil as he makes some
tired joke about the player's athletic
prowess or shoe size?
Well, Murph was Bob Hope redux.
A joke about Andrew Vlahov's house
habits. A joke about Eric Reveno's vert ical
leap. Yeah fans, Murph was in command.
Brooke Shields came out and sang with
Murph. Afterward, he said to her,
"Brooke, you sure have the height to play
basketball, and you're better-looking than
these clowns. You can start on my team
anytime, heh heh heh."
Well, not exactly, but you get the idea.
But then, Scott Meinert came up. The
confident-on-the-edge-of-cocky Meinert is
the kind of guy who never even seems
to take himself seriously, although one
never doubted his tenacity when he was
on the court. Still, it seemed likely that
the class clown would team with Murph
to bring the banquet silliness to a peak.

But Meinert, as he is wont to do, went
left as everyone was going right. When
Murph attempted to engage him in some
banter, Meinert, a fifth-year senior who
is actually nearing his 24th birthday,

choked up. It was, quite frankly, a side
of Meinert most of us have never seen,
and it showed better than any videotape
could have how pervasive throughout the
men's basketball team were the finest
qualities of maturity.
Soon after, it was Terry Taylor's turn.
Like Meinert, a chance for the crack
ling, fist-pumping Taylor to go one-on
one with Murph seemed like a natural.
Murph's vivacity was diminished but
not deflated. He made a joke. Taylor made
a comeback remark. Then a second time,
then a third. Then Murph made another.
Taylor didn't respond. Not right away.
As he was to communicate to us
through sputtering half-sentences and
thank-yous choking out through tears,

all the years of basketball for Taylor, a
coach's son, a player too short and too
slow to excel in a sport tailored to the
tall and fleet, a man who maybe was
never taken completely seriously by
anyone outside of the members of this
Stanford basketball team, all those years,
which went by with the flick of a back
spinning shot from beyond the 3-point
line, all those years were ending here.
Now.
All the jokes were over.
The gentle giant, Howard Wright,
helped finish up this melancholy affair
which, though it was upwards of five
