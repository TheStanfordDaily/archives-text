# Green names spring starters; Frosh Smith wins QB spot
## 
### Chris Crader Senior staff writer 
Entering the final week of
spring football practice, the
normal thing to do is to allow
optimism to abound. With a
team like Stanford's, a new
coach, plenty of talent and a
great class of recruits coming
in, of course people are going
to start thinking of bowl
games.
But how good will the Car
dinal be this fall? Of course we
won't know until the fall, but
Coach Denny Green took the
first step toward finding out
by announcing a tentative
starting lineup yesterday. Al
though a few likely starters
weren't listed because they are
injured, and although a few in
coming freshmen will contend
for starting roles, Green did say
who he would play if Notre
Dame came to town tomorrow.
In the most awaited an
nouncement, freshman Steve
Smith was tabbed as the
starter at quarterback for the
fall. "Steve Smith simply
played his position better than
anyone else did this spring,"
Green said. "Steve has the
strength in his arm, he has the
accuracy, and we feel he has

the qualities needed to lead this
team."
Green stated that the lineup
he announced is the lineup for
the start of fall practice but
that things may change before
the team's first game.
Joining Smith on offense are
split end Ed McCaffrey, flanker
Walter Batson, halfback
Charlie Young, fullback Scott
Eschelman, center Chuck Gil
lingham, guards Chris Dalman
and Eric Anhalt and tackles
John Carpenter and Darran
Baird.
Andy Papathanassiou will
take over for Dalman at one
guard spot this fall and Jon
Volpe will be the starting full
back. Papathanassiou, a re
turning starter, is throwing the
shot put and the discus for the
track team and Volpe, a 1000-
yard rusher in 1988, has inju
ries to both shoulders.
Defensively, All-American
outside linebacker Rob
Hinckley leads the way. He is
joined by Bruce Lang, inside
linebackers Jonathan Tunney
and Kevin Puk, ends Scott
Palmbush and Ryan Shea,
noseguard Estevan Avila, cor
nerbacks Alan Grant and Tuan
Van Le and safeties Rob
Englehardt and Herbie Berry.
