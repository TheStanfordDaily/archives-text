Dynasty building is an art, not
a science.
Perhaps the foremost practi
tioner of that art in the world of
collegiate tennis today is Stanford
Coach Frank Rrennan. For as
Brennan and his team sit poised
on the brink of capturing their
fourth straight national champi
onship, Rrennan has taken a
major step toward capturing a
fifth next year.
That step was the signing of
high school standouts Meredith
McGrath, Heather Willens and
Mario Carruth to letters of intent.
McGrath, a native of Midland,
Mich., is almost certainly the top
recruit in the nation. The 5-foot-7
rising star is not only one of the
top-ranked juniors, but also has
already attained a ranking of No.
100 in the world.
"I feel Meredith is the best
player I've seen coming out of
juniors in the last 10 years, and
I've seen a lot of players coming
and going," Brennan said. "I'm
really excited about a girl of her
prominence coming to Stanford
instead of turning pro.
"There is no doubt in my mind
that as the years move one,
Meredith is going to do nothing
but get better."
Said McGrath's coach, Glenn

William: "Meredith could turn
professional today and probably
work herself into the top 50 in
the world within a year. But
what's the rush? At Stanford,
she'll continue to develop her
game and get a great education
at the same time."
For her own part, McGrath
agrees the opportunity to play at
Stanford is worthwhile. "Stan
ford's team is strong," McGrath
said. "Every day, I'm going to
have someone to practice with
who is tops in the nation."
Noted William: "The Stanford
