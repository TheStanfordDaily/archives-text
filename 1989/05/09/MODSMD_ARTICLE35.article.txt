# Women's tennis recruits stars McGrath, Willens and Carruth

Dynasty building is an art, not
a science.
Perhaps the foremost practi
tioner of that art in the world of
collegiate tennis today is Stanford
Coach Frank Rrennan. For as
Brennan and his team sit poised
on the brink of capturing their
fourth straight national champi
onship, Rrennan has taken a
major step toward capturing a
fifth next year.
That step was the signing of
high school standouts Meredith
McGrath, Heather Willens and
Mario Carruth to letters of intent.
McGrath, a native of Midland,
Mich., is almost certainly the top
recruit in the nation. The 5-foot-7
rising star is not only one of the
top-ranked juniors, but also has
already attained a ranking of No.
100 in the world.
"I feel Meredith is the best
player I've seen coming out of
juniors in the last 10 years, and
I've seen a lot of players coming
and going," Brennan said. "I'm
really excited about a girl of her
prominence coming to Stanford
instead of turning pro.
"There is no doubt in my mind
that as the years move one,
Meredith is going to do nothing
but get better."
Said McGrath's coach, Glenn

William: "Meredith could turn
professional today and probably
work herself into the top 50 in
the world within a year. But
what's the rush? At Stanford,
she'll continue to develop her
game and get a great education
at the same time."
For her own part, McGrath
agrees the opportunity to play at
Stanford is worthwhile. "Stan
ford's team is strong," McGrath
said. "Every day, I'm going to
have someone to practice with
who is tops in the nation."
Noted William: "The Stanford

Meredith McGrath of Midland, Mich., signed a letter of Intent to
attend Stanford last week. McGrath is currently ranked No. 100 In
the world.
team has a host of strong players
returning (including All -
Americans Sandra Birch, Lisa
Green and Teri Whitlinger, as well
as Kylie Johnson and Debbie
Graham), and McGrath may not
necessarily begin at No. 1 singles.
"They've got great depth.
Meredith will have to work and
compete for her position on the
team," William added.
Brennan certainly has a lot of
faith in what McGrath can do.
"It's her ability to serve and volley
and play the big game that makes
her so strong," he said. "Plus,
there's the fact that she's a great
doubles player. She can play
world-class doubles right now on
the pro circuit."
With all the hoopla surrounding
McGrath, one might think the
other recruits could get lost in
the shuffle â€” but not these two.
For starters, both are ecstatic

about coming to Stanford. Willens
said she is "very excited, of
course."
Said Carruth: "I'm really
looking forward to it a lot."
And the Cardinal faithful
should be looking forward to
them. Willens is the reigning
champion in the National Indoor
18-and-under doubles and a Na
tional Indoor singles semifinalist
in 1987.
She is a two-time Al!-City of
Los Angeles champion.
Carruth is the reigning singles
champion in the National
Hardcourt 16-and-under (she is
17 now). She won the 1989 Ojai
Tournament a week and a half
ago defeating Willens along the
way. Carruth called that match
"the most difficult of the tourna
ment."
Carruth is the No. 1-ranked
player in Northern California.
For both, academics seemed to
be a key concern in choosing Stan
ford. Like McGrath, they are high
school honor students.
Willens explained that while her

sport is important to her, "Tennis
doesn't come first. School and
doing other things come first."
Looking at the Stanford team,
she said "I think their talent is
the best assembled ever. If I play
real well, I'd have a chance to get
in there (the lineup)."
And if not? "I won't be
crushed," she said.
Carruth echoed a similar tone.
She considered attending Califor
nia, Harvard and UCLA in addi
tion to Stanford. Ultimately, when
she was admitted here, the choice
was made.
"It's a great school," Carruth
said. "I've always wanted to go
[to Stanford]."
Her views of cracking the Car
dinal's Murderer's Row lineup?
"It will be really hard," she said.
"If I do; I do. If I don't; I don't,"
Carruth added succinctly.
Willens said an added benefit
was that she is "really close with
Meredith" and also friends with
Carruth. She added that through
all their experience in juniors, it
becomes a situation where "every
body knows everybody."
