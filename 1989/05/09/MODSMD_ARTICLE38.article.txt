# A 						gift for the family: openness

When the Lesbian/Gay/Bisexual
Speakers Bureau came to her
frosh dorm, a dormmate of Susan
McKean's told her: "I'm going to
picket. I don't want them in my
house. They'll just make it filthy."
Susan, who had recently learned
that her older brother Tom is gay,
was stunned. "Suddenly I realized
it was really scary to confront that
kind of moralizing, and that I
have to stand up for gays as much
as Tom does," she says.
People in her dorm didn't know
Susan has a gay brother, but they
knew her views. "You don't have
to have a relative or a good friend
who's gay as an excuse to support
gays," she says.
Susan, now a sophomore and
an editor at The Daily, asked her

brother if he was gay in a letter
just before the start of her fresh
man year. "He had given me all
these hints that summer. So I
wrote him."
In the next few months after
coming out to Susan, Tom began
distancing himself from their par
ents because he was anxious about
telling them.
So at Christmas, Susan bought
a book on gays, wrapped it, and
put it under the tree, saying it
was a gift for the family. "When
my mom opened it, Tom was
really happy. He started crying
and he hugged me."
The family was at a New
Hampshire cabin and spent the
next two days discussing
homosexuality. "Tom was totally

free talking about it. It was
great," she says.
"My mom cried a lot. My dad
is an ordained minister, a liberal
Protestant. I think that worked
both ways. Christianity had
taught him that it was an abnor
mality, but also to forgive, that
you should love all equally."
Today the family fully supports
Tom, who will graduate from Yale
University this month and will
move to San Francisco to live with
his lover of two years.
Of Tom, Susan says,"I just
admire him so much. He is sure
of his worth as a person regardless
of his trappings — who he loves,
what he wears, where he works.
His feet are on the ground. I love
him."
