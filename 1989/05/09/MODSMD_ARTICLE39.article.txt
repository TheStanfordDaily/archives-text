# 'I wish it were more unacceptable to be homophobic'

Recently, "Lynne" and some
dormmates who didn't know she
has a lesbian sister were talking.
"Some guys were being really ho
mophobic and I was getting
angrier and angrier. They made
a joke like 'homosexuals don't
breed,' and I said, 'My sister
might.' Their conversation just
stopped."
Lynne, not her real name, is a
senior in history. She asked for
anonymity to protect her sister,
who didn't want to come out as
a lesbian at this time.
Lynne believes anti-gay bigotry
is common at Stanford. "I wish
it were more unacceptable to be

homophobic. You're not supposed
to be racist. No one here would
ever defend racism, although they
might disagree over what it means
to be racist. But a lot of people
think homophobia is OK."
Four years ago, Lynne learned
that her older sister, "Ann," is
lesbian. "I'd thought for my last
couple years of high school that
she was lesbian, but she never
said anything so I didn't think
about it. Then my freshman year
(at Stanford), she told me in a
letter she sent from Africa, where
she was in the Peace Corps."
Lynne's parents, who already
knew their oldest .child would

come out to her sister in the let
ter, watched Ann read it."I don't
remember this, but my dad said
I smiled. He was surprised by that
reaction. I just thought, 'Finally,
I know. This is great.' "
Ann had come out to her par
ents a year before, and they asked
her not to tell her younger brother
and sister. "I'm not sure, but I
think they were scared it would
influence us toward homosex
uality," Lynne says. Today the en
tire family — including siblings
"Brian," 26; Lynne, 22; and
"Andrew," 18 — knows that 27-
year-old Ann is lesbian.
Accepting Ann's homosexuality

"was kind of difficult for the fam
ily at first," Lynne says."It was
very much on our minds, and the
family didn't want to talk about
it. We're gradually referring to it
more in normal conversations.
In part because of her sister's
lesbianism, Lynne feels very
strongly that more needs to be
done to combat homophobia. "It
really pisses me off that (Stan
ford) lets the CIA interview on
campus. The CIA won't hire ho
mosexuals. I had a gay friend who
wanted to interview with them,
and I said, 'What are you think
ing? You think they'll treat you
fairly?' "
