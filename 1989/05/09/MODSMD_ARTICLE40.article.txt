# Linksters take second, will host NCAAs
## 
### David Hirning Staff writer 
Perhaps no other sport has the
home-court advantage that col
legiate golf necessarily requires,
and it has nothing to do with
screaming crowds or the lack of
travel. It comes down to a simple
case of familiarity, of knowing the
tricks and turns of a golf course
so well they have become second
nature.
Therein lies the beauty of the
position of the Cardinal women's
golf team. Needing a few good
rounds and a decent finish to as
sure itself of a berth in the
NCAAs, Stanford hosted a tour
nament the last two days and
finished second to San Jose State.
The Cardinal will be playing in
the NCAA tournament May 24 to
27.
Oh, yeah, that one's going to
be on the Stanford course too.
Kind of convenient, that.
Using a format usually reserved
for men's collegiate tournaments
(18 holes one day and 36 the
other), the women suffered indi
vidually on the second day but
prospered as a team. The Cardinal
moved up to second place on the
strength of a pair of 3025, after
wallowing in fourth after the first
round.
"It was a must-performance,
and they did it," Stanford Coach
Tim Baldwin said. "We will prob
ably end up in the NCAAs now."
Baldwin noted that the Cardi
nal would likely be ranked No. 11

nationally next week by the
NCAA, which would give them
one of the 14 automatic bids for
the tournament.
Freshman Adele Moore, who
flirted with first place on the first
day before settling for a tie at
fifth, said she wasn't affected by
the long day."I think that every
one prepared mentally for 36
holes. It was funny, because after
the first round it didn't feel like
I had played 18."
Moore fell back a bit from the
torrid pace she had set on Sunday
when she posted a two-under-par
71. At that point tied for second
with teammate Jodi Figley,
Moore's second-round 76 left the
Texan five shots out of the lead.
Her final round was at par, and
the overall score of 220 left her
eight shots back.
"I was happy," Moore said. "My
middle round was not the best,
but overall I had some good
rounds and played well."
Her teammate Figley didn't
fare so well, dropping to No. 12
after an 81 and a 79 on the second
day. "Jodi faltered today all day,
and she is usually such a strong
performer," Baldwin said. "But I
know she'll be there for us at the
NCAAs."
Freshman Audrey Wooding con
tinued her fine play by posting
consecutive rounds of 77, 74 and
75 to finish eighth overall. "It
was nice to play three premium
rounds in a tournament," she
said. "I've been kind of on the
edge lately, but I thought it went

well this weekend."
Wooding thought that the team
took advantage of the home course
advantage to beat the other two
good teams at the tournament,
UCLA (ranked third nationally)
and U.S. International (fourth).

"It does help," Wooding said.
"The greens were really fast and
smooth, but I was putting well.
We analyzed what we needed to
work on after the last tourna
ment, and it really paid off."
Going into the final round, the
Cardinal trailed San Jose State
by six strokes. "I thought we were
going to beat them," Baldwin said.
"But they got tremendous
performances in the final round,
and shot two under par." Stanford
ended up 18 shots back of the
Spartans.
Pretty much everyone got into
the act last weekend, as junior
Stephanie Parel shot 71 and 75
on the final day to push her up
into 10th. Stephanie Davis, play
ing as an individual, was tied with
Figley for 12th, and redshirt Kris
tin Ryan and freshman Martha
Richards played just for the ex
perience.

formance, and they
did it. We will proba

fifth, said she wasn't affected by
the long day."I think that every
one prepared mentally for 36
holes. It was funny, because after
the first round it didn't feel like
I had played 18."
Moore fell back a bit from the
torrid pace she had set on Sunday
when she posted a two-under-par
71. At that point tied for second
with teammate Jodi Figley,
Moore's second-round 76 left the
Texan five shots out of the lead.
Her final round was at par, and
the overall score of 220 left her
eight shots back.
"I was happy," Moore said. "My
middle round was not the best,
but overall I had some good
rounds and played well."
Her teammate Figley didn't
fare so well, dropping to No. 12
after an 81 and a 79 on the second
day. "Jodi faltered today all day,
and she is usually such a strong
performer," Baldwin said. "But I
know she'll be there for us at the
NCAAs."
Freshman Audrey Wooding con
tinued her fine play by posting
consecutive rounds of 77, 74 and
75 to finish eighth overall. "It
was nice to play three premium
rounds in a tournament," she
said. "I've been kind of on the
edge lately, but I thought it went

well this weekend."
Wooding thought that the team
took advantage of the home course
advantage to beat the other two
good teams at the tournament,
UCLA (ranked third nationally)
and U.S. International (fourth).

"It does help," Wooding said.
"The greens were really fast and
smooth, but I was putting well.
We analyzed what we needed to
work on after the last tourna
ment, and it really paid off."
Going into the final round, the
Cardinal trailed San Jose State
by six strokes. "I thought we were
going to beat them," Baldwin said.
"But they got tremendous
performances in the final round,
and shot two under par." Stanford
ended up 18 shots back of the
Spartans.
Pretty much everyone got into
the act last weekend, as junior
Stephanie Parel shot 71 and 75
on the final day to push her up
into 10th. Stephanie Davis, play
ing as an individual, was tied with
Figley for 12th, and redshirt Kris
tin Ryan and freshman Martha
Richards played just for the ex
perience.

'It was a must per
formance, and they
did it. We will proba
bly end up in the
NCAAs now.'
