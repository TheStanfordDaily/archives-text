# 'The best mom I know'
## 
### 
Jennifer and
Ted DesMaisons'
parents are
divorced — not
an uncommon
family situation
for Stanford stu
dents.
But unlike
many, their
mother Kathleen

is a lesbian who has been in a
serious relationship with a woman
for four years.
For reasons unrelated to Kath
leen's sexuality, the parents
divorced when Ted was 5 and Jen
nifer was 3, the siblings said. Five
years later, Ted and Jennifer
learned their mother was gay.
Kathleen had her first lesbian
relationship when Ted, now a
junior in feminist studies, was 10.
"It wasn't any big deal," says Ted,
who knew about it from the be
ginning.
"The first time I saw them kiss,
I asked her about it. She said
they were in love, that it was a
romantic relationship."
For Jennifer, an undeclared
freshman, the realization was
more gradual. "I don't think I
consciously thought of it as being
lesbian for a long time. ... I was
just thinking about it as a best
friend, someone my mom could

really relate to. They were very
supportive of each other."
The kids grew up in Rhode Is
land, which Ted says was "oppres
sive" for his mom. She wasn't
able to tell others about her re
lationship, so although Ted ac
cepted his mother's lesbianism, he
couldn't talk about it much. "We
had to collude in the lie," he says.
At first, Jennifer didn't tell
anyone about her mother. Ted told
close friends, who reacted well.
"Mom's a wonderful person," he
says. "Before they knew she was
lesbian, they knew they liked her,
and that didn't change."
Growing up with a lesbian mom
has heightened Ted's and Jenni
fer's sensitivity to gay and lesbian
issues and made them more com
fortable with their friends who are
gay. They attend a gay-oriented
church in San Francisco with
their mother.
Neither Ted nor Jennifer has
experienced too much criticism of
their family at Stanford; Jennifer
has told only a few of her friends.
Says Ted, "Anybody who knows
my family and how well we've
turned out is not going to make
a negative comment about my
mom's parenting abilities.
"She's the best mom I know,
and I'm not just saying that be
cause she's mine."
