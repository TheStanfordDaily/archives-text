# College Republicans claim free speech flier was theirs
## 
### Pam Weisz Staff writer 
Yet another organization has
emerged as the possible distribu
tors of a controversial flier on free
speech that appeared during last
week's ASSU Council of Presi
dents campaigning.
The flier, which attacked past
quotations on free speech by
Canetta Ivy, a member of the COP
and the Student Conduct Legisla
tive Council, has now been attrib
uted to three different sources.

The Stanford Federalist Soci
ety s name had been handwritten
on the original flier and last week
the group claimed responsibility
for the flier.
At the same time, David Brown,
a COP candidate for Slate of the
Times, a slate backed by the
People's Platform, charged that
Students' Choice, the opposing
COP slate, may have a connection
to the flier. The font on the flier
was the same font used on the
fliers of the Students' Choice.

In the latest development, Keith
Rabois, president of the College
Republicans, has claimed that the
flier was "our idea." Rabois said
his organization approached the
Federalist Society and asked them
to take responsibility for the flier.
He thought students would ap
proach the flier with a more open
mind if they did not know it had
been distributed by a Republican
group, Rabois explained.
Kevin Ascher, treasurer of the
College Republicans, said the fee
for publishing the flier — about

$40 — will be split "more or less
evenly" between the College Re
publicans and the Federalist So
ciety.
In another development, the
College Republicans are charging
that Drew Dixon, the top vote
getter in this year's ASSU Senate
race, took down the flier and
replaced it with People's Platform
fliers last Wednesday night.
Rabois claims the alleged act
violates the Fundamental Stand
ard because it "intentionally vio

lated our right to communicate
with the rest of the campus."
The case is based primarily on
circumstantial evidence. Sopho
more Brian Fagel, an ASSU
senator, claims that a free-speech
flier which was on a door in
Faisan House disappeared during
a 10-minute interval during which
Dixon and "two or three" other
People's Platform supporters
were putting up Slate of the
Times fliers in the hall. Fagel said
he did not actually see anyone
taking down the flier.
