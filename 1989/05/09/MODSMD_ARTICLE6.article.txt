# The
						Unseen Stanford: Families of Gays & Lesbians
## One family out of four 
### Elizabeth Howton Bob Michitarian Editorial staff 
FOR MANY GAYS and les
bians, the hardest thing
they've ever done is come
out to their families.
Many others have yet to take that
step, and some doubt they ever
will.
Today's stories highlight five
families with a gay or lesbian
member. These families have gen
erally accepted their loved one's
sexual orientation and are able to
speak openly about their child's,
parent's or sibling's experiences.
Three can't come home
But some gays aren't so lucky.
Some parents, upon learning they
have gay children, disown them
and cut them off from in
heritances. Some refuse to con
tinue supporting their child.
Other parents refuse to let their
gay children in their house. "In
our neighborhood, there are four
gay boys, and only one of them
can come home," says Ann David
son, wife of Medical School Prof.
Julian Davidson. "I think that's
a tragedy."
The Davidsons, whose son Ben
is the only one of the four wel
come in his parent's home, live in
an area populated by Stanford fac
ulty and administrators.
