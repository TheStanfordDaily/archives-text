# The 						Unseen Stanford: Families of Gays & Lesbians
## One family out of four 
### Elizabeth Howton Bob Michitarian Editorial staff 
FOR MANY GAYS and les
bians, the hardest thing
they've ever done is come
out to their families.
Many others have yet to take that
step, and some doubt they ever
will.
Today's stories highlight five
families with a gay or lesbian
member. These families have gen
erally accepted their loved one's
sexual orientation and are able to
speak openly about their child's,
parent's or sibling's experiences.
Three can't come home
But some gays aren't so lucky.
Some parents, upon learning they
have gay children, disown them
and cut them off from in
heritances. Some refuse to con
tinue supporting their child.
Other parents refuse to let their
gay children in their house. "In
our neighborhood, there are four
gay boys, and only one of them
can come home," says Ann David
son, wife of Medical School Prof.
Julian Davidson. "I think that's
a tragedy."
The Davidsons, whose son Ben
is the only one of the four wel
come in his parent's home, live in
an area populated by Stanford fac
ulty and administrators.
A death in the family
Some parents react to news that
they have a gay child "like it's a
death in the family," says Dr.
Carlos Grieves, a Palo Alto psy
chiatrist who specializes in work
ing with gay people and their
families.
"They have to remove their ex
pectations of what their child's
future would be like — grand
children, a particular position in
society, et cetera," says Grieves,
who also works for Stanford's
Counseling and Psychological
Services.

Siblings generally react more
positively than parents when they
learn their brother or sister is
gay. "The children grow up to
gether and know each other very
well," Grieves says. "They tend
to be more tolerant."
Acceptance may take years
But most parents do eventually
accept their child's homosexuality,
Grieves says.
"Usually there's a great deal of
shock" when parents first learn
their child is gay, Grieves says.
Then, parents commonly feel
guilt, thinking that the child's
homosexuality is "their fault,"
and shame, worrying what friends
might think. They may even ques
tion their own sexuality.
Finally, though, most parents

come to terms with their child.
The entire process, Grieves says,
"can take months or many, many
years."
One family in four
To help the transition, there is
a support organization called P
FLAG, or Parents and Friends of
Lesbians and Gays. The organi
zation has about 200 chapters and
contacts nationwide and a dozen
overseas.
The Stanford chapter meets
monthly, and has a mailing list
of 110. "About 20 people come to
each meeting," said Ann Hender
son, a Stanford P-FLAG coordi
nator. "Almost every month
there's somebody new."
In 1978, Henderson learned
that her son, who later became

president of the Stanford Gay Law
Students Association, was gay. "It
was three years before we talked
to anyone," she said. At the P
FLAG meetings, "All people are
welcome. Some come for several
meetings and don't say anything.
That's OK; they don't have to."
According to P-FLAG, one in
four families has a gay family
member. "If 10 percent of the pop
ulation is gay, that means there
are 22 to 25 million gay people
in the U. 5.," said P-FLAG Pres
ident Pamela Goodman from the
group's Washington, D.C., head
quarters. "So there are probably
as many as 40 million moms and
dads."

hotline is 854-0142.
