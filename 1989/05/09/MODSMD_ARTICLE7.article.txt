# 'Happy Days': two Stanford brothers
## 
### 
"Most people are surprised,"
Todd Olson says, when they learn
that his brother Peter is gay.
"Pete's not effeminate. He has a
booming bass voice. He's very ath
letic. He doesn't have the airs of
the stereotypical homosexual,
which, from what I understand,
is true of most gays."
Todd, 24, is a graduate student
in electrical engineering. He also
was an undergraduate here and
was manager of the Band. Peter,
22, is a senior in psychology and
a Trancos resident assistant.
In January 1986, Todd found
out Peter was gay when they were
driving back to Stanford" after
winter break. "1 was a junior; he
was a freshman. ... I asked him
how the romantic life was, and he

said he was interested in someone
in Mendicants. Well, it took me a
second. Mendicants is an all-male
(singing) group."
Having a gay brother at Stan
ford "really hasn't been a big deal
to me," Todd says."It took some
time getting used to; you have to
rework a lifetime of expectations.
And at first, I was concerned
about who 1 could tell. But the
only thing that bothers me now
is explaining to people who expect
me to be upset."
Todd says he's always been sup
portive of gays. "We were brought
up to respect people," he says.
"We're an all-American family. . . .
Mom was president of the PTA.
Dad coached soccer. We led the

life of the Cunninghams on
'Happy Days.' "
A few months after Peter told
Todd, he came out to their par
ents. "I expected my dad to have
problems with it, but he did fine,"
I odd says."It really took my mom
a while.
Todd also says,"I wouldn't go
out with anyone who isn't accept
ing of gays. When Tobi, my
girlfriend, and 1 started going out,
I sort of felt out her feelings on
gays. If she wasn't accepting, we
wouldn't be seeing each other."
Peter's coming out "brought
our family closer. My brother and
dad understand each other better.
My mom's supportive, too. And
I've never seen Pete happier."

Todd Olson, right, says he'll probably ask his gay brother Peter
to be the best man at his wedding.
