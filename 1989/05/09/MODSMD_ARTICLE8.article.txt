# 'Mom, I'm in love — his name is Pedro'
## 
### 
Ben Davidson, then 21 and a
junior at UC-Santa Cruz, called
his mom at Stanford to say he
had to come home to tell her
something.
"I remember it exactly, like the
day Kennedy died," says Ann
Davidson, wife of Medical School
Prof. Julian Davidson. "We spent
the whole day together. We went
to Printer's Inc., the Prolific
Oven, the shopping center — and
he never said anything."
At day's end, Ann insisted that
her son talk. "Ben, tell m<>
"OK. I'm in love."
"That's wonderful. What's her
name?"
"Well, his name is Pedro."
Ann was shocked. "I looked at

lien in disgust. I had visions of
him making love to another man,
which at that time was very up
setting to me."
But today, more than five years
later. Ann accepts her son's homo
sexuality. "It was tough. On the
one hand you have all these nega
tive stereotypes. On the other, we
knew our son was a great kid who
wos happy and confident. We
could see there was something
wrong with our attitudes."
Ben and Pedro are still to
gether; they spend holidays with
the Davidsons. "When they're to
gether, I see two young men who
love each other, respect and care
for each other. The signs of affec
tion I sef> are beautiful."

A few months before he told
Ann, Ben told his father, Julian.
They were driving back to Stan
ford from the family's cabin in
the Sierras. Julian didn't tell his
wife. "I didn't want to worry her."
"I thought he would have trou
ble in his life. I thought of
grandchildren. And I felt sad
dened, like Ben and 1 couldn't be
as close because we were differ
ent," says Julian.
But Julian and Ben — and the
whole family — have grown closer
since Ben came out. "You move
from being upset and scared and
full of misconceptions to being
much more comfortable," Julian
says.
