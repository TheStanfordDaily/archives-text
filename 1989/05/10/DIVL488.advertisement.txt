we will match it. Sales last until Saturday, May 13th, so

Attention Grad
Student TAs:
What's on Your Mind?
To insure that the concerns of all graduate stu
dents are heard, the ASSU Committee on Democ
racy in Education (CODE) is holding its second in
a series of open meetings to discuss plans for the
newly formed Dean of Humanities and Sciences TA
Task Force.
At last week's first meeting, 20 graduate TAs
from eight departments came up with preliminary
suggestions for improving the TA program.
More work and input is certainly needed. Please
join us Friday for the next meeting (lunch
