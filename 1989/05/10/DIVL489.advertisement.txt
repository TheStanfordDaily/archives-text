ALMOST FRESH VS.
ALWAYS FRESH
Some people have never
even tasted a fresh chocolate.
Thafs because other candy
makers store their chocolates for
up to seven months.
But at Ethel M Chocolates, we make
weekly deliveries so you can experience our
mouthwatering chocolates within a few days
of being freshly made. And we never keep
more than a week's worth of inventory.
This Mother's Day, give your mom a gift
of pure, freshly-made Ethel M Chocolates.
Because she's always wanted whafs best.
