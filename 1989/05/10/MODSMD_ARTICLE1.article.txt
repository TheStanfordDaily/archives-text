# Trustee's S&L opens outreach lending program
## 
### Brad Hayward Senior staff writer 
Amid charges of discriminatory loan practices,
the bank owned by Stanford trustee Robert Bass
has announced a new program that may halt
criticism of its treatment of low-income customers.
American Savings, of Stockton, announced Mon
day that a new Corporate Outreach Department
will oversee the bank's affirmative lending program
and monitor its compliance with the federal Com
munity Reinvestment Act.
The act outlaws redlining, a practice by which
banks systematically deny loans to people living in
low-income, inner city neighborhoods.
The Greenlining Coalition, an organization of Cal
ifornia community groups, recently charged that
American Savings has been redlining in some of its
Bay Area branches. Bank officials have vigorously
denied the charge but have agreed to meet with
representatives of the coalition.
Layna Browdy, senior vice president of American
Savings, said yesterday that the bank has worked
for several months on the new department, and
that its creation was not a response to the coalition's
charges.
Edith Adame, legal counsel for the Latino Issues
Forum, one of the Greenlining Coalition's member
groups, said the coalition welcomed the bank's latest
step but added: "It's not unique to their institution.
All banks and savings and loans recognize it's good
business policy to do what they're doing."
