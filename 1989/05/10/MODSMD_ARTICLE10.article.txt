# New group wants to reform ASSU
## 
### Mike Friedly 
Claiming that the ASSU no
longer represents the majority
of Stanford students, a group
of about a dozen students met
last night to form the Associ
ation for Student Government
Reform, a "watchdog organiza
tion" that will work to change
the ASSU, according to foun
der Perry Friedmn.r
Planning to garner student
support for their position the
group aims to pressure *he
ASSU into iur Omen
tal constitutional changes that
will make the student govern
ment more representative.
The group will t y "to work
with the AS3U to cftange the
ASSU," said Friedman, a re
cently elected member of the
Student Conduct Legislative
Council and a member of the
Chaparral, the campus humor
magazine.
The group proposes to ex
pand membership in the ASSU
Senate so that a wider range
of student concerns can be

voiced. Friedman claimed that
the senate has too few mem
bers to adequately represent
the broad spectrum of student
thought. Currently, the senate
has 10 vo< ing members and 10
non-voting members.
Council of Presidents mem
ber David Brown, who attended
a portion of the meeting, dis
missed the charges as "ridic
ulous." He said that no group
could possibly represent the en
tire Stanford community and
that the People's Platform —
which endorsed Brown's slate
during his recent victorious
campaign for the COP — tries
to act in the best interest of
the "vast majority."
One of the grievances aired
during the meeting concerned
the ASSU's involvement in out
side political events such as the
Spring Action march.
In addition, the group wants
to review the salaries of the
COP members and the ASSU
financial manager, which the
group claims are unnecessarily
high.
