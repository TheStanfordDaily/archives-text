### 
GUATEMALA CITY (AP) - Troops loyal
to Guatemala's 3-year-old civilian government
snuffed out the second attempted coup in a
year by rebellious military officers yesterday
without firing a shot.
President Vinicio Cerezo asked Guatemalans
to remain calm, saying, "The situation is un
der the control of the government and the
army of Guatemala."
Defense Minister Alejandro Gramajo said
rebel air force troops backed by two helicopter
gunships and an A-37 warplane blocked two
mqjor highways on the south and northeast
edges of the capital. Gramtyo said rebel troops
also tried to march on his home.
He said the rebels turned back when they
encountered a superior force of loyalist troops.
The defense chief said at least 300 rebel
soldiers were involved. He gave no other troop
figures.
The rebellion was crushed without a shot
being fired, Cerezo told a news conference
hours after the uprising.
Cerezo and Gramtyo said the attempt was
staged by an air force tactical unit based at
the international airort south of Guatemala
City. It was led by at least 10 current, retired
or cashiered military officers, including
several who took part in a failed uprising on

May 11, 1988, they reported.
In that attempt, two columns of troops
marched on Guatemala City but were turned
back without gunfire. Six officers were ar
rested.
Cerezo and Granuyo said all but two high
ranking officers involved in yesterday's plot
were in custody. An unspecified number of
soldiers were also arrested.
The president said civilians apparently were
not involved, as they were last year.
In Washington, White House press secretary
Marlin Fitzwater voiced strong, continued
U.S. support for the government.
A State Department official, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said he received
reports that the real target may have been
Gramqjo or another minister. Gramajo repeat
edly has said the time has come for real
civilian government in Guatemala.
Guatemala never has sustained a modern
democratic govenment. It is widely agreed ci
vilian authority now exists only with military
consent and supervision.
Gramajo said yesterday that loyalist troops,
tanks and artillery took up defensive positions
at strategic sites after the plot surfaced at
about 5 a.m. Loyalists surrounded the Pres
idential Palace, government communications
company, national police headquarters and na

tional broadcasting facilities. They took up
positions at the home of Gramfiyo, who refused
to join the 1988 attempt.
Loyalist troops identified themselves by
wearing blue kerchiefs at their necks. Most
of them returned to barracks by 8:30 a.m.
after the rebel aircraft returned to base.
Cerezo said rebels tried to seize radio and
TV to broadcast a communique. He refused
to divulge the contents, saying it would be
used as evidence in military tribunal proceed
ings.
Gramajo told The Associated Press in Au
gust, "The army is doing everything possible
so that the era of coups pertains to the past.
Nonetheless, the traditional forces are doing
everything possible so that it does not. As of
now, I'm winning."
The "traditional forces" are rightist land
owners and business people who forged strong
alliances with the military during years of
military rule.
Guatemala never has sustained a modern
democratic govenment. It is widely agreed ci
vilian authority now exists only with military
consent and supervision.
Cerezo, 46, a Christian Democrat, took office
in January 1986, heading the first elected
civilian administration in 16 years. His term
ends in 1991.
