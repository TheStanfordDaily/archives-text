# Wright lashes out at ethics committee special counsel
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - House
Speaker Jim Wright yesterday accused
the ethics committee's special outside
counsel of distorting testimony in an ef
fort to implicate him in House rules vi
olations, but committee members dis
missed the charge as a defense gambit.
At the same time, the ethics panel
faced a possible expansion of its investi
gation of the speaker, requesting court
records from a Texas fraud trial where
Wright's name has surfaced and sched
uling a meeting for today to decide

whether to pursue a gas drilling venture
that proved lucrative to Wright.
Wright's new eight-member legal de
fense team filed a series of motions with
the ethic committee, asking for access to
committee documents and witnesses and
seeking to bar private contact between
the panel and its outside counsel, Chicago
lawyer Richard Phelan.
Other motions were being prepared
asking that the most serious charges
against Wright be dismissed because they
are based on faulty reading of House

rules.
"I think Mr. Wright will be totally
cleared in any fair trial before his peers,
said Stephen Susman, a Houston lawyer
brought in to bolster the speaker's de
fense team.
In a blunt attack on Phelan, Wright
said his attorneys "have been profoundly
shocked by the lack of professionalism
find prevalence of distortion and inac
curacy contained in the Phelan report"
and called the committee's investigation
"one-sided."

He also said the 12 ethics committee
members attended few interviews of wit
nesses. "It has rendered them totally de
pendent on Mr. Phelan's interpretation
and his summary of the investigation,"
Wright said.
And on one issue — whether his wife,
Betty, earned the $18,000-a-year salary
she was paid by Fort Worth developer
George Mallick from 1979 through 1984
— Phelan ignored testimony of another
Mallick employee and concluded Mrs.
Wright worked only 12 days in four years,

Wright said.
"That's a lie, a falsehood, a distortion
and a misrepresentation of the testimony
that was given," he charged.
But committee chairman Julian Dixon,
D-Caiif., and other panel members said
Wright was wrong in contending Phelan
had misled the committee.
"I'm very proud of the way they (the
panel) have conducted themselves and
thoroughly digested everything made
available to them," Dixon said.
