PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP)
— The government under Gen.
Manuel Antonio Noriega de
ribunced international observers
who saidtfM Utole the 'presidential
election, and it declared yesterday
its own candidate was ahead by
almost two to one.
In Washington, President Bush
demanded that Noriega "heed the
call of the people" and abandon
power. Bush said reports by U.S.
observers "demonstrate clearly
that despite massive irregularities
at the polls the opposition has
won a clear-cut, overwhelming
victory" in Sunday's election.
The opposition claims a 3-1 vic
tory. It said it was paying no at
tention to official results and of
fered to negotiate.
"We are ready to enter a
dialogue between civilians and the
military to find a solution to the
nation's crisis," Ricardo Arias
Calderon, the opposition candi
date for first vice president, told

a news conference Monday.
Government foes staged no fur
ther demonstrations, and truck
loads of troops coursed through
•the streets.
Police broke up a brief con
frontation between pro- and anti
government supporters at the
home of Archbishop Marcos
McGrath, the country's Roman
Catholic leader, who was meeting
with the opposition leadership.
Walls, telephone poles and palm
trees still bore campaign posters,
but stores that were boarded up
in anticipation of violence were
reopening.
The government said Noriega's
candidate, Carlos Duque, was
leading opposition candidate
Guillermo Endara by 51,752 to
26,878 with 12 of 40 districts re
ported.
The opposition released figures
from its own pollwatchers saying
it was leading by 236,097 to
79,260 with 35.8 percent of the

vote counted.
Retiree Carlos Halphen sum
med up an opinion expressed by
many when asked what would
happen next.
"We want the United States to
do something. The U.S. got us
into this mess, it should get us
out," he said.
U.S. observers discussed with
Bush in Washington options for
putting more pressure on Noriega
to step down.
The United States has imposed
damaging economic sanctions on
the government but has been un
able to oust Noriega as com
mander of the 15,000-strong De
fense Forces and as de facto ruler.
"This election was a terrible
fraud on the Panamanian people,"
said Rep. Larry Smith, R-Fla., a
member of an uninvited observer
delegation sent by Bush. "Polls
opened late, peoples' names were
not on lists, dead peoples' names
were on lists."
