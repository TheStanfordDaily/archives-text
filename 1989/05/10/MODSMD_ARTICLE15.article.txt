# Six sailors killed in ship fire

WASHINGTON (AP) â€” Six sailors were killed
and five injured yesterday when an intense fire
erupted in the engine room of a Navy supply
ship heading home from a deployment supporting
Persian Gulf operations, the Pentagon said.
Crewmen aboard the USS White Plains, a food
stores ship, battled the blaze for over an hour
before bringing it under control, officials said.
The ship was in the South China Sea about 100
miles east of Hong Kong at the time.
The Pentagon spokesman, Dan Howard, said
that the fire occurred "in the main engine
spaces." A Navy source said it apparently involved
a fuel leak in and around the ship's No. 3 boiler.
The 581-foot White Plains is based at the
Pacific island of Guam and is crewed by a normal
complement of 403 enlisted men and 25 officers.

Anxious relatives of crew members gathered
at the military chapel on Guam yesterday, await
ing word on the accident. Some wives had just
returned to Guam after visiting their husbands
during a port call in Hong Kong.
The accident occurred three weeks after an
explosion inside a gun turret on the battleship
lowa left 47 sailors dead.
Questions have been raised about whether the
lowa explosion was due to faulty powder or
human error, but officials have not yet said what
caused the accident. Howard, with a curt, one
word reply of "None," dismissed the idea the fire
aboard the White Plains might suggest problems
with Navy training or equipment maintenance.
In addition to the six dead, five other crewmen
were injured.
