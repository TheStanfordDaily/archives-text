### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Soviet
arms control experts told the
House Armed Services Committee
yesterday their country has cut
production of tanks, planes and
ships, despite U.S. intelligence
reports that Soviet military out
put continues at previous levels.
During the unusual hearing,
three committee members ex
pressed reservations that the
panel was hearing testimony from
the Soviet group, which included
four leading civilian experts on
military matters.
Rep Richard Ray, D-Ga., asked
the Soviets to respond to concerns
expressed by Defense Secretary
Dick Cheney and other Americans
that "the goals of the Soviet Un
ion have really not changed"
despite the reforms of Kremlin
leader Mikhail Gorbachev.
"They point to the fact that
weapons manufacturing contin-

production had gone
down this year.

ues, tank production at 278 a
month continues with no let up,
submarine building, ship building,
airplane building, and so forth,
continues to be modernized," said
Ray.
Andrei Kokoshin, known as one
of the architects of the Soviet
"new thinking" on military af
fairs, said weapons production
had gone down this year.
And Roald Sagdeyev, a promi
nent reformer elected to the newly

created Congress of Peoples'
Deputies, said Soviet military
spending had been cut by 1.5 per
cent this year.
The actual Soviet military
budget has not been published,
Kokoshin and Sagdeyev acknowl
edged, but they said the figure
would be revealed in June by Mar
shal Sergei Akhromeyev, the
former chief of the Soviet General
Staff who now serves as Gorba
chev's top military adviser.
Pentagon and intelligence
sources said preliminary data in
dicated that during the first four
months of the year, Soviet tank
production had risen from the pre
vious level of 3,200 to 3,400 a
year, in the same range as Ray's
figure.
But the statistics were under
review, and the surge was believed
to be temporary and related to
plans to close down production
lines.
