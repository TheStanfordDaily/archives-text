# Lucas appointment stirs protest
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - A coa
lition of civil rights organizations
voiced its opposition yesterday to
the appointment of William Lucas
to head the Justice Department's
civil rights division.
The Leadership Conference on
Civil Rights said Lucas doesn't
have the experience or litigation
skills needed in the position,
which is the federal government's
top civil rights job.
The conference is an umbrella
group of 180 organizations and
the opposition was adopted "by
consensus" at a meeting of the
conference, according to Ralph
Neas, executive director of the or
ganization.

Neas and Benjamin Hooks,
chairman of the conference, said
in a statement that Lucas "may
well be qualified for other impor
tant positions in the federal gov
ernment, but he does not have
the experience, the substantive
knowledge of the increasingly
technical field of civil rights, or
the litigation skills to carry out
the duties effectively."
The opposition was the latest
round in the controversy swirling
around Lucas, a black Detroit
lawyer. Lucas, 61, also has been
an FBI agent, sheriff of Wayne
County, Mich., and the chief ex
ecutive of that county.
Lucas is being backed for the

post by Attorney General Dick
Thornburgh, civil rights activist
Jesse Jackson, some members of
the Congressional Black Caucus
and the Rev. Joseph Lowery, pres
ident of the Southern Christian
Leadership Conference.
But the nomination of Lucas,
a Democrat-turned-Republican
who lost a race for the Michigan
governor's post in 1986, has been
opposed by the National Associa
tion for the Advancement of
Colored People.
The leadership conference posi
tion said the organization would
"work to persuade the U.S. Senate
to withhold confirmation of the
nomination'.'
