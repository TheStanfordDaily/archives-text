Violence continues in West Bank
JERUSALEM (AP) â€” Israel remembered its
war dead yesterday and celebrated its indepen
dence, but the twin tributes to a tumultuous
Past were marred by more bloodshed from the
alestinian uprising.
In the occupied West Bank, troops fatally shot
one Palestinian and wounded two in a raid on
the village of Salfit, an army official said. Arab
reports said five others were wounded by soldiers
in the West Bank and Gaza Strip
In the Arab-Jewish city of Akko in northern
Israel, a 27-year-old Jew fatally stabbed a 14-
year-old Arab. An Arab motorist caught the as
sailant, who has a history of mental illness, police
said. The assailant told the motorist he stabbed
the boy to avenge Arab attacks on .Jews, police
said.
The two deaths brought to 467 the number
of Palestinians killed in the uprising. Twenty-one
Israelis also have died.
The violence came as Palestinians observed a

general strike called by pro-PLO underground
leaders to mark the beginning of the 18t.h month
of the uprising

WASHINGTON (AP) - Investigators impl

Senate Select Committee on Indian AfTairs that
Koch Industries, which does a large amount of
business on Indian oilfields, over the past three
years consistently took hundreds of thousands
more barrels of crude oil than it paid for.
In Wichita, a Koch public affairs department
receptionist said no one was immediately avail
able to respond to the allegations.
A certain amount of mismeasuring is normal
in the industry, but not to the degree shown in
documents subpoenaed from Koch, said witnesses
