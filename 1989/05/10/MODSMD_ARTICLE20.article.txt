## Redistributing DRs 
### 
Planned inclusion of
ethnic, gender studies
is a sign of priorities

STANFORD'S distribution
requirement system needs a
good dose of perestroika.
And it looks like it just might get
it, now that the Subcommittee
on Distribution Requirements
has proposed some reforms that
would consolidate requirements
and could mandate ethnic and
gender studies.
The three options for restruc
turing proposed by the committee
reflect a re-evaluation of Stan
ford's curricular priorities in fa
vor of greater attention to non-
Western, ethnic and more issue
related categories.
Currently, the existing DRs are
arbitrary and could use con
solidation. For instance, the dis
tinction between "Social
Thought" and "Social Process" is
not evident in the actual course
offerings.
The subcommittee's proposed
changes include adding a new DR
called "World Cultures" and one
focusing on ethnic and gender is
sues. Two of the proposals con
solidate four of the current DRs
into two.
These are good intentions. But,
the committee needs to expound
on what "World Cultures" spe
cifically will cover. We don't want
to fall into the same rut of having
DRs with obscure bounds.
By requiring that students take
courses that deal with ethnic and
gender issues, the University is
also making an important state
ment.
Stanford is finally taking an

institutional stand that says
these issues are important and
necessary for students if they
wish to receive a complete liberal
arts education.
Of the three options that the
subcommittee proposes, the third
one appears to be the most ag
gressive and complete. It
proposes to combine the DRs Two
through Five, and then to add
"World Cultures" and "Ethnic
and/or Gender Studies," leaving
the total at eight DRs.
It's about time Stanford takes
another look at balancing re
quirements with priorities, and
requirements with actual class of
ferings.
The subcommittee's proposals
are a step in the right direction,
but the subcommittee must
elucidate on what, exactly, each
of the options would entail if put
into effect.
Are these requirements viewed
as a way to more fully integrate
non-Western, ethnic and gender
sensitive studies into the overall
curriculum? Or are they the Uni
versity's final answer to the cur
rent deficiencies?
There is a danger in pigeon
holing these areas. By putting
them into their own slots, it's
easy to marginalize them and
avoid really incorporating these
themes and peoples into the
mainstream, total curriculum.
But for starters, requiring
classes is one way to legitimate
those studies now unfortunately
on the fringes of academia.
Even at this early stage in the
planning, community input is
necessary. The groundswell of
community response to the
debate over the Fundamental
Standard interpretation should
be sequeled with this issue.
