Marking Israel's
independence is
bittersweet, hopeful
Today there will be celebrations
throughout the world in honor of Isra
el's independence, including one at
Stanford in White Plaza. The celebra
tions, occuring one week after
Holocaust Remembrance Day, com
memorate 41 years of the existence of
the State of Israel.
It is not by coincidence that
Holocaust Remembrance Day falls just
before Israel's Independence Day. The
former was purposefully designated to
be commemorated within a week of
the latter. The two days are inex
tricably tied; one must understand the
meaning behind the Holocaust remem
brance in order to fully grasp the
meaning behind the independence of
Israel.
It was during the Holocaust, almost
half a century ago, that the Jewish
race almost became extinct. Jews were
systematically robbed of all of their
possessions, separated from their
families, starved and dehumanized in
the streets of the "civilized" societies
of Europe.
This process culminated with the
mass murder of six million Jewish
people. Many Jews tried to escape from
this genocide only to be sent back to
their deaths by many countries, the
United States included. Throughout
their suffering, the greatest fear of
many Jews who died was that along
with them would die the Jewish
people.
Yet the Jews as a people did not die.
And the continuing existence of the
state of Israel is the greatest affirma
tion of this fact. Founded three years
after the Holocaust, Israel serves as a
homeland to Jews everywhere. It is the
one place a Jew can live without the
threat of anti-Semitism and the incred

ible horrors of a Holocaust.
Even more than that, and not
withstanding these trying times, Israel
serves as a symbol. Its existence is a
symbol of determination that the the
murderous extinction of the Jewish
people, or any other people, shall never
happen again. The existence of Israel
also symbolizes a belief in humanity
that despite such horrors as the
Holocaust, there is hope.
Last week I mourned the brutal
genocide of my Jewish ancestors, won
dering how such a horrific crime
against humanity was made possible.
Today I am free to celebrate the exis
tence of a Jewish state. I celebrate for
the six million who could not. I hope
the Stanford community joins in
celebration.

SCAAN accurately
portrayed terror
ofSalvadoran life
I am writing in response to the May
5 editorial accusing the Stanford Cen
tral America Action Network of a
"Poor Performance." I am not a mem
ber of SCAAN, but have worked on
Central American issues for a number
of years.
El Salvador is the third largest
recipient of U.S. aid. We spend over $1
million every day sustaining their gov
ernment, equipping their military and
financing their police force.
Guerrilla theater's purpose is to
bring a message to people who may
not have access to information from
other sources — i.e., newspapers or
other media. Guerrilla theater is im
portant here, because mainstream U.S.
media does not tell us what is going
on in El Salvador.
The Daily provides evidence of that
in writing that SCAAN's acts represent

"alleged" violations of civil rights in El
Salvador. I assume The Daily chose the
word "alleged" because no one has
been brought to trial and convicted for
the deaths. But blame that on a cor
rupt and terrified judicial system . . .
not on any doubts as to whether the
death squads in El Salvador have vio
lated "civil rights."
SCAAN's "acts" represent the sys
tematic abduction, torture and murder
of over 10,000 men and women. If you
are able to imagine the terror and
confusion that causes, keep in mind
that people in El Salvador can't call
their resident assistants, and they espe
cially can't call the police. The police
are, in many cases, the plainclothes
people who have abducted the person
in the first place. Complain to them
and you may be next.
The point of guerrilla theater is to
help us understand the reality of ter
ror in a country that we otherwise
know little about. I am sorry that the
abductions upset The Daily. 1 am even
more sorry that The Daily and the
residents of Otero were unable to draw
from their experience anything more
than anger at SCAAN.
I'm sorry that they could not use
the genuine confusion and fear they
felt for that short time to try to un
derstand the terror that Salvadoran
citizens live with every day.

Bug Me mocked
'Shorts Day' with
'Shirt Day' joke
May 9 represented a very important
date in the lives of many Stanford
students (over 1,300 if you believe Kin
sey). It was "Gay and Lesbian Shorts
Day."
With this in mind, I cannot say I
was thoroughly impressed by the May

5 "Bug Me." At the beginning of the
column, readers are urged to "under
stand and support the Bug" by
wearing a shirt on May 9; a date he
designated "Bug Me Shirt Day."
Although not one who is easily of
fended, I found it hard not to take
Bug Me's reference as anything other
than a slap in the face of the gay,
lesbian and bisexual community at
Stanford. To insist that people wear
shirts, something to which there is no
obvious alternative, to show their sup
port for the column serves only to
belittle the purposes behind Gay and
Lesbian Shorts Day.
Many Stanford students, both homo
sexual and heterosexual, have worked
very hard to create a caring and un
derstanding environment here at Stan
ford; one in which everyone feels as
comfortable as possible being whomever
he or she is. Unfortunately, comments
like those printed in the May 5 "Bug
Me" serve to undermine this work.
As I inferred at the beginning of my
letter, ono in 10 of us at Stanford and
in American society in general is gay
or lesbian; and it is because of the
seemingly harmless acts of the Bug
that so few of us are able to perform
such simple tasks as writing this letter
without the fear of the possible conse
quences which may result from it
leaping into the forefronts of our
minds.
If there was any confusion about the
purposes of Gay and Lesbian Shorts
Day, then I'm sure the many resources
available at The Daily office would
have helped to clarify it. As with
everything else, however, ignorance is
no excuse.

Marking Israel's
independence is
bittersweet, hopeful
Today there will be celebrations
throughout the world in honor of Isra
el's independence, including one at
Stanford in White Plaza. The celebra
tions, occuring one week after
Holocaust Remembrance Day, com
memorate 41 years of the existence of
the State of Israel.
It is not by coincidence that
Holocaust Remembrance Day falls just
before Israel's Independence Day. The
former was purposefully designated to
be commemorated within a week of
the latter. The two days are inex
tricably tied; one must understand the
meaning behind the Holocaust remem
brance in order to fully grasp the
meaning behind the independence of
Israel.
It was during the Holocaust, almost
half a century ago, that the Jewish
race almost became extinct. Jews were
systematically robbed of all of their
possessions, separated from their
families, starved and dehumanized in
the streets of the "civilized" societies
of Europe.
This process culminated with the
mass murder of six million Jewish
people. Many Jews tried to escape from
this genocide only to be sent back to
their deaths by many countries, the
United States included. Throughout
their suffering, the greatest fear of
many Jews who died was that along
with them would die the Jewish
people.
Yet the Jews as a people did not die.
And the continuing existence of the
state of Israel is the greatest affirma
tion of this fact. Founded three years
after the Holocaust, Israel serves as a
homeland to Jews everywhere. It is the
one place a Jew can live without the
threat of anti-Semitism and the incred

ible horrors of a Holocaust.
Even more than that, and not
withstanding these trying times, Israel
serves as a symbol. Its existence is a
symbol of determination that the the
murderous extinction of the Jewish
people, or any other people, shall never
happen again. The existence of Israel
also symbolizes a belief in humanity
that despite such horrors as the
Holocaust, there is hope.
Last week I mourned the brutal
genocide of my Jewish ancestors, won
dering how such a horrific crime
against humanity was made possible.
Today I am free to celebrate the exis
tence of a Jewish state. I celebrate for
the six million who could not. I hope
the Stanford community joins in
celebration.

SCAAN accurately
portrayed terror
ofSalvadoran life
I am writing in response to the May
5 editorial accusing the Stanford Cen
tral America Action Network of a
"Poor Performance." I am not a mem
ber of SCAAN, but have worked on
Central American issues for a number
of years.
El Salvador is the third largest
recipient of U.S. aid. We spend over $1
million every day sustaining their gov
ernment, equipping their military and
financing their police force.
Guerrilla theater's purpose is to
bring a message to people who may
not have access to information from
other sources — i.e., newspapers or
other media. Guerrilla theater is im
portant here, because mainstream U.S.
media does not tell us what is going
on in El Salvador.
The Daily provides evidence of that
in writing that SCAAN's acts represent

"alleged" violations of civil rights in El
Salvador. I assume The Daily chose the
word "alleged" because no one has
been brought to trial and convicted for
the deaths. But blame that on a cor
rupt and terrified judicial system . . .
not on any doubts as to whether the
death squads in El Salvador have vio
lated "civil rights."
SCAAN's "acts" represent the sys
tematic abduction, torture and murder
of over 10,000 men and women. If you
are able to imagine the terror and
confusion that causes, keep in mind
that people in El Salvador can't call
their resident assistants, and they espe
cially can't call the police. The police
are, in many cases, the plainclothes
people who have abducted the person
in the first place. Complain to them
and you may be next.
The point of guerrilla theater is to
help us understand the reality of ter
ror in a country that we otherwise
know little about. I am sorry that the
abductions upset The Daily. 1 am even
more sorry that The Daily and the
residents of Otero were unable to draw
from their experience anything more
than anger at SCAAN.
I'm sorry that they could not use
the genuine confusion and fear they
felt for that short time to try to un
derstand the terror that Salvadoran
citizens live with every day.

Bug Me mocked
'Shorts Day' with
'Shirt Day' joke
May 9 represented a very important
date in the lives of many Stanford
students (over 1,300 if you believe Kin
sey). It was "Gay and Lesbian Shorts
Day."
With this in mind, I cannot say I
was thoroughly impressed by the May

5 "Bug Me." At the beginning of the
column, readers are urged to "under
stand and support the Bug" by
wearing a shirt on May 9; a date he
designated "Bug Me Shirt Day."
Although not one who is easily of
fended, I found it hard not to take
Bug Me's reference as anything other
than a slap in the face of the gay,
lesbian and bisexual community at
Stanford. To insist that people wear
shirts, something to which there is no
obvious alternative, to show their sup
port for the column serves only to
belittle the purposes behind Gay and
Lesbian Shorts Day.
Many Stanford students, both homo
sexual and heterosexual, have worked
very hard to create a caring and un
derstanding environment here at Stan
ford; one in which everyone feels as
comfortable as possible being whomever
he or she is. Unfortunately, comments
like those printed in the May 5 "Bug
Me" serve to undermine this work.
