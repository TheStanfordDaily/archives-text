## A 						shovelful of idealism 
### 
THIS COLUMN IS intended for the
eyes of a large, unofficial (and
mostly imaginary) organization
called the Stanford Idealists. The Stan
ford Idealists aim toward the highest,
expect the best.
They are not supported by student
approved ASSU funds. Rather, they are
driven by a unifying force that all mem
bers adhere to in spirit. This grand ideal
is the fear of shit.
How does this deepest, most intimate
fear unify the members of the Stanford
Idealists? Simple. It is the denial of shit
that beautifies our lives.
For example, take this basic, crude
scenario: Two students, both card
carrying members of the Stanford
Idealists, go out on a first date. The
motives behind this action are simple.
They both like each other, as one thinks
the other is a beautiful person, and vice
versa. They are attracted to each other,
as each appears beautiful in the other's
eyes.
The two plan to go ice skating or some
thing of the sort. But first, they go to
Max's Opera Cafe for dinner, or another
restaurant where the food is beautiful.
It is such a splendid evening that they
must forget where that beautiful food
ends up. They must deny human excre
ment in the presence of absolute beauty.
When we are born into this world we
agreeably sign a binding contract that
states, "Life is Good." But some people
think we sign a contract that says, "Life
is Beautiful." If this idea sounds silly, if
you don't remember holding a pen at
birth, you've forgotten that a contract

signed by the heart is substantially more
meaningful than a contract signed in ink.
Think about it. Our lives, while they
may not have a clear, specific purpose,
do share this common contract. If we
were miserable, why would we want to
live? We continue living because life is
good or can be good. Or, as long as we
are living, we try to make things good,
find meaning in everyday events, make
things beautiful. Even at the cost of
reality.
The members of the Stanford Idealists
signed this contract at birth. In doing
so, they agreed to deny shit, in every
sense of the word. They fear it. They
loathe it, because thinking about it vi
olates the contract that states life is beau
tiful. The contract allows them to exclude
the negative aspects of life. It is the good
ness of existence that wills them to exist.
The danger behind this idealism is that
it distorts perception. For example, it
distorts the past, or what you remember
of it. What is memory, but the slow turn
ing over and over of an image that has
passed? The idealism applied to memory
leads to a selective memory where we
are capable of convincing ourselves about
things that were never true, for the pur
pose of fulfilling the contract that binds
you to see life as beautiful.
This idealism is scariest in the realm
of human relationships. The contract that
states "life is beautiful" has caused the
two students from the example above to
overlook, to deny the human fact of
defecation.
What this means in a figurative sense
is that they deny each other's faults,
elevating each other on to high pedestals.

Instead of seeing who that person really
is, they see what they want to see or
what they expect to see. How can some
one try to live up to the expectations of
another, already expecting so much of
themselves? I would call this problematic.
The denial of shit presents its brutal
effects in the public sphere as well. What
is censorship but expression that must
conform to the idealistic standards of
those who do censor? The need to control
expression is a reflection of meekness, of
an insecurity that cannot accept a dis
senting perspective that does not conform
to the binding contract.
The idealists must make life agreeable
for themselves; they have a starving need
to deny This need is called kitsch.
I first heard of the idea of a "categorical
agreement with being" in Milan Kun
dera's "The Unbearable Lightness of
Being." In the novel, Sabina, the perse
cuted painter, tells her lover Tomas, "The
reason I like you is you're the complete
opposite of kitsch. In the kingdom of
kitsch you would be a monster."
In her country where she is restrained
by the idealism of the government, she
looks to Tomas for her self-expression.
Kitsch is essentially a denial of real life.

scenario: Two students, both card
carrying members of the Stanford
Idealists, go out on a first date. The
motives behind this action are simple.
They both like each other, as one thinks
the other is a beautiful person, and vice
versa. They are attracted to each other,
as each appears beautiful in the other's
eyes.
The two plan to go ice skating or some
thing of the sort. But first, they go to
Max's Opera Cafe for dinner, or another
restaurant where the food is beautiful.
It is such a splendid evening that they
must forget where that beautiful food
ends up. They must deny human excre
ment in the presence of absolute beauty.
When we are born into this world we
agreeably sign a binding contract that
states, "Life is Good." But some people
think we sign a contract that says, "Life
is Beautiful." If this idea sounds silly, if
you don't remember holding a pen at
birth, you've forgotten that a contract

signed by the heart is substantially more
meaningful than a contract signed in ink.
Think about it. Our lives, while they
may not have a clear, specific purpose,
do share this common contract. If we
were miserable, why would we want to
live? We continue living because life is
good or can be good. Or, as long as we
are living, we try to make things good,
find meaning in everyday events, make
things beautiful. Even at the cost of
reality.
The members of the Stanford Idealists
signed this contract at birth. In doing
so, they agreed to deny shit, in every
sense of the word. They fear it. They
loathe it, because thinking about it vi
olates the contract that states life is beau
tiful. The contract allows them to exclude
the negative aspects of life. It is the good
ness of existence that wills them to exist.
The danger behind this idealism is that
it distorts perception. For example, it
distorts the past, or what you remember
of it. What is memory, but the slow turn
ing over and over of an image that has
passed? The idealism applied to memory
leads to a selective memory where we
are capable of convincing ourselves about
things that were never true, for the pur
pose of fulfilling the contract that binds
you to see life as beautiful.
This idealism is scariest in the realm
of human relationships. The contract that
states "life is beautiful" has caused the
two students from the example above to
overlook, to deny the human fact of
defecation.
What this means in a figurative sense
is that they deny each other's faults,
elevating each other on to high pedestals.

Instead of seeing who that person really
is, they see what they want to see or
what they expect to see. How can some
one try to live up to the expectations of
another, already expecting so much of
themselves? I would call this problematic.
The denial of shit presents its brutal
effects in the public sphere as well. What
is censorship but expression that must
conform to the idealistic standards of
those who do censor? The need to control
expression is a reflection of meekness, of
an insecurity that cannot accept a dis
senting perspective that does not conform
to the binding contract.
The idealists must make life agreeable
for themselves; they have a starving need
to deny This need is called kitsch.
I first heard of the idea of a "categorical
agreement with being" in Milan Kun
dera's "The Unbearable Lightness of
Being." In the novel, Sabina, the perse
cuted painter, tells her lover Tomas, "The
reason I like you is you're the complete
opposite of kitsch. In the kingdom of
kitsch you would be a monster."
In her country where she is restrained
by the idealism of the government, she
looks to Tomas for her self-expression.
Kitsch is essentially a denial of real life.
