Q. What causes baldness?
• Are there any cures ?
A. According to Human Biol
• ogy Visiting Asst. Prof.
James Lawry, scalp disease or

the genetic predisposition to
baldness cause a bald spot or a
slowly creeping hairline.
Hair patterns, from head hair
to pubic hair, are inherited.
Males inherit a male pattern of
hair growth and females inherit
a female pattern.
In the male hair pattern, the
hairline usually recedes from
the temples straight back,
leaving a bald dome. Males
rarely bald on the back of their
heads or on their beards, Lawry
said. Balding for men usually
begins in the 40s, but sometimes
begins in the 20s for "early
starters."
Occasionally females inherit
baldness, too, according to Der
matology Assoc. Prof. Marvin
Karasek.
The genetic device causing
baldness involves more than one
gene, and is not necessarily
transferred by the mother or
the father, Lawry said.
Baldness is associated with
the male hormone, testosterone.
A form of testosterone acts on
the hormone receptors at the
base of the hair follicle. For this
reason, not as many women will
go bald.
But genes are not the only
controlling factors of whether
you will become bald.

Baldness might be caused by
scalp diseases such as fungus or
drug treatment such as chemo
therapy, the treatment used for
cancer patients. Baldness caused
by scalp disease usually appears
"patchy," according to I^awry.
Thousands of Americans who
are going bald turn to compan
ies who claim to be able to res
tore hair to even the baldest of
heads. "Full hair recovery in six
weeks," some advertisements
claim.
But many of the cures for
baldness do not work since hair
follicles do not regenerate,
Lawry said. Surgical techniques,
such as hair grafts and trans
plants, are marginally success
ful, he said.
Monoxydol, a drug used to
treat high blood pressure, has
been used with some success to
treat baldness. But, Karasek
said, the hair growth is not very
good, and the prescription drug
has to be applied constantly.
According to Lawry, "You get
what you're born with."
