# Skin cancer clouds the sunny days

Don't be fooled. Gray skies
don't mean you aren't being ex
posed to the sun's deadly ultra
violet rays.
According to the American Can
cer Society, it is possible to get a
sunburn even on a cloudy day.
And, experts say, repeated sun
burns and excessive exposure to
these ultraviolet rays is the num
ber one risk factor for developing
skin cancer.

The sun's rays can penetrate
the cloud cover to cause severe
sunburns. Sun rays can also reach
down at least three feet into
water. So, swimming under the
surface of the water is not nec
essarily sufficient protection
against burning.
The sun's rays are strongest
between 10 a.m. and 3 p.m., so
doctors advise avoiding the sun
at midday. Sun exposure at high
altitudes can be more dangerous
because there is less atmosphere
to filter out the ultraviolet rays.

Over 500,000 new cases of skin
cancer are reported every year,
making it the most common form
of cancer. The vast majority of
these cases are preventable. Luck
ily, if detected early, skin cancer
is also one of the most curable
forms of cancer.
There are three types of
skin cancer: basal cell carcinoma,
squamous cell carcinoma and
malignant melanoma.
Malignant melanoma, the most
serious, yet least common, skin
cancer strikes more than 25,000
persons each year. According to a
New York University study re
leased last week, the rate of malig
nant melanoma among white
women under 45 is increasing
dramatically, more than ever
thought before. Furthermore,
dark-skinned people are increas
ingly becoming victims of
malignant melanoma.
People who sunburn easily, such
as those who have fair skin with
red or blond hair, are most prone
to develop skin cancer.
Children, in particular, should
be protected from severe sun
burns. One study found that se
vere sunburn in childhood carries
with it an excessive risk of
melanoma in later life.
If you are prone to skin cancer,
it is not necessary to completely

avoid the outdoors to reduce can
cer risk. A fair-skinned person
who wearB protective clothing,
uses strong sunscreens, and stays
out of bright sunlight has a good
chance of avoiding skin cancer.
Many sunbathers may try to
substitute indoor sunlamps, tan
ning parlors or tanning pills for
direct, natural sunlight. However,
exposure to ultraviolet rays occurs
even from these artificial means.
The light emitted by tanning
lamps are somewhat safer than
the sun, but can still damage.
About 90 percent of all skin can
cers occur on unclothed parts of
the body. For example, the face,
tips of the ears, hands and
forearms have been the usual sites
of cancer.
However, in the past 50 years,
cancer on the shoulders, backs
and chests of men, and the lower
legs of women is becoming more
prevalent.
Skin specialists also recommend
using sunscreens with a Sun Pro
tective Factor — known as SPF
— of 15 or higher. The American
Cancer Society especially recom
mends sunscreens containing such
ingredients as PABA — para
aminobenzoic acid.
