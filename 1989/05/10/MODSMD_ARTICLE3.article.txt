# Kennedy warns: No activism on Harvard Board
## 
### Jason Bloomstein Senior staff writer 
Fearing that "the virus" of special-interest politics
may pervade his alma mater, University President
Donald Kennedy warned Harvard University against
filling recent openings on its board of overseers with
"single-issue" candidates.
Kennedy's message comes on the tail of the an
nouncement that South African Archbishop Des
mond Tutu and four other anti-apartheid activists
are running to fill the board's five vacancies. The
Harvard-Radcliffe Alumni Against Apartheid is sup
porting the candidacy of Tutu, a Nobel Peace Prize
winner, and the other candidates.
In the latest issue of Harvard magazine, Kennedy
wrote that he was "alarmed to watch the virus of
single-issue, special-interest politics, already a
serious infection in our national life, spread to Har
vard."
Besides receiving three degrees from Harvard,
Kennedy held a post on the board of overseers from
1970-76. The board is elected by Harvard graduates.
Kennedy told The Daily yesterday that he did not
intend to attack any individuals, but rather to
espouse the principle that "elections to governing
bodies should not succumb to the disease of single
issue politics." He did tell The Daily, though, that
Tutu's candidacy prompted the letter.
In his letter, Kennedy never refers directly to
Tutu or the four other candidates.
However, Kennedy did say that
"Candidates should be judged on
the basis of what they present on
a broad perspective and not on
whether they pass or fail a loyalty
test ... no matter how attractive
their particular position."
In an interview yesterday,
Robert Zevin, one of the candi
dates supported by the Harvard
anti-apartheid group, said Ken
nedy's complaints "imply anti
apartheid candidates don't care
about other university issues."
Zevin said such implications are
unfair and wrong.
Kennedy countered by saying he
does not make assumptions about
what each candidate believes in,
but that he disagrees with candi
dates who run pledged to a single
issue.
Zevin said he was running to
stem what he called the current
board's "campaign" of avoiding
the apartheid issue. He accused

Kennedy of "playing into Har
vard's campaign, presumably by
their invitation" by critizing his
candidacy.
Noting that he wrote the letter
on his own initiative, Kennedy
said Harvard is currently making
"forthright and constructive" ap
proaches to examining their rela
tion with the South African gov
ernment.
According to Kennedy, his letter
was not directed at criticizing
Harvard's electoral process for its
board of overseers but to show
that all political organizations
should be wary of strong single
issue influence.
"Once these special interest
groups start," Kennedy added,
"there is no clear place where they
will stop."
Though single-issue slates have
not sieged spots on the Stanford
Board of Trustees, Kennedy
warned that special-interest
groups are gaining political power
nationwide and "any electoral
process is not immune.
"This virus is so prevalent in
aspects of political life," he said.
"No place is safe."
