# THE 						ASSU NEWS
## On Free Speech and the Fundamental Standard A 						message from the ASSU Senate and the Council of Presidents 
### 
The Ujamaa and Otero incidents caused many students great pain while challenging all of us to reexamine our values and our expectations. We struggled to come to
terms with difficult questions: What protection do we guarantee students to be free from harassment? What does "'freedom of speech" really mean and how do we protect
it at a university? When does someone's right to speak infringe on someone else's right to fully participate in the Stanford community? We want to utilize this opportunity
to explain the ASSU position on this issue: after discussions with many students in the days following the Ujamaa incident, the ASSU Senate voted overwhelmingly to
support changing the Fundamental Standard.

We value the right of every Stanford stu
dent to be a fully participating member of
the community. When a slur or epithet is di
rected against someone in a way that inhibits
his or her ability to feel comfortable at this uni
versity, we feel that something is wrong.
An action which seeks to frighten or
degrade another student on the basis of race,
religion, gender or sexual orientation, contra
dicts the values of our community and should
be seen as violating the Fundamental Standard.
This is especially important in the dorms —
where all students need to feel comfortable,
safe and welcome.
But does this mean that we seek to prevent
"free speech" or violate the First Amendment?
No. Constitutional scholars, including Stanford
Law professors and students, will tell you that
the Supreme Court has never explicitly held
racist and sexist forms of speech to be
protected under the First Amendment.

There is a critical distinction between
speech that has content and value and
speech which merely consists of epithets
and slurs. One must be protected in order to
allow the free exchange of ideas. The other
serves only to hurt others; it has no intrinsic
value in promoting discussion or understand
ing.
Thus, the Ujamaa argument over whether
Beethoven was Black was a discussion that
deserves the protection accorded to free speech;
the students crossed the line when they
defaced a poster in a racially derogatory man
ner and anonymously posted it on the door of
a Black student, having a silencing and chilling
effect on his right to freedom of speech.
The issue of punishment is an entirely sep
arate question. As an institution, we need to
make a statement: incidents such as Ujamaa vi
olate university standards or policies. No one is
saying that an ignorant statement should result
in suspension or expulsion. We are saying that

we should deem such statements unacceptable
and then decide on the value of punishment
based on the individual merits and characteris
tics of each case.
Simplifying a complex issue by telling stu
dents that we are trying to deny your freedom
of speech serves only to intimidate you into
jumping to conclusions. We hope that all stu
dents will discuss the issue, weigh out the
complexities, and feel comfortable coming to
talk to us.
If you disagree with this statement, let
us know, and let us know why. We want to
foster thoughtful discussion about this issue so
that we don't only emerge with a new policy,
we also emerge with a new concensus about
what is and isn't acceptable here. Hopefully,
something positive will come out of the Otero
and Ujamaa incidents: this is our chance to
redefine and clarify our values as a diverse
community. This can only happen if all stu
dents participate thoughtfully and responsibly
in the discussion.
