## Cardinal tames Broncos, wrestles Tigers today 
### Bruce Sarkisian Senior staff writer 
Bud E. Klein Varsity Clubhouse
at Sunken Diamond was built for
days like yesterday. It's a place
where the players can kick back,
watch a little satellite television
and stay in from the cold.
But this is crunch time for the
Cardinal and frigid temperatures
or not, Stanford won a critical
non-league game with Santa Clara
6-4, braving the wind and rain to
do it.

Baseball
Cardinal 6, Broncos 4

Stanford (27-28) improved its
record to within one game of .500
for the second time in a week
while Santa Clara fell to 40-22.
For the Cardinal, the early in
nings were the key to victory as
Stanford jumped out to a 3-0 lead
by the second inning on two RBI
singles by Roger Burnett and one
by Paul Carey.
Stan Spencer (4-7) held the
Broncos off until the sixth to get
the victory, his second in five

days. Spencer usually does not
start games in the middle of the
week, but with only three games
left on the Cardinal's schedule,

'The coaches
asked me how I felt
before the game. I
said I was fine, and
they said "You're
pitching."'

Stanford Coach Mark Marquess
needs every victory to avoid his
first losing season at Stanford.
"At this point, every non-league
game is important," Spencer said.
"They (the coaches) asked me how
I felt before the game. I said I
was fine, and they said 'You're
pitching.' "
The Cardinal put the game out
of reach in its half of the fifth,
scoring two runs. With two outs,
David McCarty singled and Troy
Paulsen laced a double into the
left-center field gap for the first

run. Then Tim Griffin brought
his roommate across the plate
with an RBI single to make the
score 5-0.
Spencer had a little hard luck
in the sixth, courtesy of a vicious
breeze blowing straight out to left
field. Bronco third baseman Mark
Lewis led off with a single but
Spencer retired the next two bat
ters.
Left fielder Craig Middlekauf,

a Cardinal nemesis, then hit a
pop fly to left field that got caught
up in the wind and just carried
over the wall for a two-run homer
that put the Broncos within strik
ing distance at 5-2. It was Mid
dlekaufs eighth home run of the
year, but his third off Stanford
pitching.
Mark Carper came out to pitch
the seventh and gave up a run on
a single, two passed balls and a
ground-out. He loaded the bases
in the eighth on a walk and two
singles before Scott Weiss came
out of the bullpen with no outs.
Weiss displayed the form he had
in saving Saturday's win over Cal
ifornia, striking out five batters
in the final two innings. He did
allow one unfortunate walk in the
eighth, which forced in Santa
Clara's fourth and final run.
Other than a double by the hot
hitting Lewis, Weiss was unhit
table. "It's his curve ball," Mar
quess said. "When he usually gets
hit, it's his fastball."
Marquess was especially happy
with how Spencer peformed on
only three days rest. "We're really
thin in the bullpen and if we don!t
get four or five innings out of
Spencer, we're in trouble."
With another game today at
Pacific, Marquess will have to get
a similar performance from his
starting pitcher if the Cardinal is
to have any pitching left for the
weekend at Pepperdine.
Card notes
Paul Carey was named a First
Team CoSida District-8 Academic Ail-
American yesterday. The award was
voted on by the sports information
directors in Stanford's district.
McCarty hit his fifth home run of
the year in the seventh inning. It was
his third in four games.

Weiss displayed the form he had
in saving Saturday's win over Cal
ifornia, striking out five batters
in the final two innings. He did
allow one unfortunate walk in the
eighth, which forced in Santa
Clara's fourth and final run.
Other than a double by the hot
hitting Lewis, Weiss was unhit
table. "It's his curve ball," Mar
quess said. "When he usually gets
hit, it's his fastball."
Marquess was especially happy
with how Spencer peformed on
only three days rest. "We're really
thin in the bullpen and if we don!t
get four or five innings out of
Spencer, we're in trouble."
With another game today at
Pacific, Marquess will have to get
a similar performance from his
starting pitcher if the Cardinal is
to have any pitching left for the
weekend at Pepperdine.
