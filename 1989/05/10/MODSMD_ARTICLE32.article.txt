Diamond All but one of the 18 Cardinal batters that came to the plate
that day reached base
WHO'S HOT — The Cardinal faced a lefty yesterday, so Roger Burnett
batted second and went 3-for-5 with two RBI. In his last 15 games,
Burnett is hitting just over .430 (28-for-65). David McCarty has three
home runs in his last four games.
WHO'S NOT — David Holbrook has seen his batting average fall 20
points in the last two weeks. He was 1-for 4 yesterday, but is still one
of six Cardinal players batting over 300
KEYS TO VICTORY — Stanford should roll easily to a win today. A big
Cardinal victory on the road would give the team the confidence it
needs to beat Pepperdine, a team that rarely loses at home. Steve
Worrell (2-3, 6.61 ERA) needs to pitch at least six innings to save
the thin Cardinal bullpen for the weekend. Stanford cannot take Pacific
too lightly. The beat 12th-ranked Fresno State two weeks ago.
