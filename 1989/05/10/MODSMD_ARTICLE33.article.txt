## Cyclists take 2nd behind Cal 
### Libby Feil Staff writer 
The Stanford cycling team
experienced a nightmarish
sense of deja vu last weekend
as the cyclists competed in the
Western Collegiate Cycling
Conference Championships at
UC-Santa Barbara. Although
the Cardinal won the individ
ual time trial Saturday morn
ing and vaulted to a lead over
rival California, its slim advan
tage eroded in the road race
and was erased in Sunday's cri
terium.
The flat time trial on Satur
day was Stanford's best event.
The Cardinal went into the race
42 points behind California and
emerged 23 points ahead. The
team's strongest divisions were
the women's Band men's A
fields, but Stanford students
placed well in every category.
Stanford rider Russell Meade
won the men's A event, and
fellow rider Art Walker took
second. Teammate Steve Miller
was 17th.
Stanford's women's B riders
also worked well together.
Stephanie Page, Becky Wig
glesworth and Polly Siegal flew
to a one-two-four placing.
Despite some strong finishes
in the road race, Stanford lost
to the Bears in this event 154-
133, thereby cutting its lead to
two narrow points. The Cardi
nal's best categories were the
women's Band men's A divi
sions.
In the women's B division,
consistently strong riders Page
and Wiggles worth repeated the
morning's results by capturing
first and second. In the men's
A field, Cardinal Tom Moyer
showed the strength that made
him the league's top scorer by
placing second. He was fol
lowed by Miller and Walker in
10th and 12th places.
In past years the Stanford
team had the reputation of only

being able to win criteriums.
Unfortunately, that has
seemed like the one thing it
has not been able to do consis
tently this year.
The Cardinal watched its
chances for the conference title
become more and more slim as
Sunday's criteriums prog
ressed. Despite outstanding
finishes by some individual
Stanford riders, the day ended
in much the same fashion as
the disappointing Stanford Cri
terium a few weeks ago.
As a result, California ended
up with 1,273 points for the
season to Stanford's 1,174. Cal
Poly-San Luis Obispo and UC-
Santa Rarbara were the third -
and fourth-place finishers in
the conference.
In two weeks, however, these
four teams will go on to na
tionals in Colorado Springs,
Colo. At nationals all the com
peting teams start from
scratch.
Runners excel in
San Jose races
The Stanford running club
sent several runners last week
end to the Bigfoot Run to the
Lake, held in the Raging
Waters waterslide park in San
Jose. The Cardinal's runners
competed sensationally, placing
in ail the categories they en
tered.
Stanford runner Rohan
Zaveri flew to first place overall
in the five-mile race. Team
mate Dante Rodriguez took
first place overall in the two
mile run by a wide 1:30 margin.
Stanford's Marissa Schwartz
and Stacy Hurd captured first
and second places in the wom
en's division.
Cardinal runners J.D.
Douglas and Rich Meich
pounded to 13th and 15th
places overall in the five-mile
run. Douglas placed third in
the 20-29 age division as well.
