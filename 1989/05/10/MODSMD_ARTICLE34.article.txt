# Weiss surges late in season
## 
### Robert Portnoy Senior staff writer 
As he strode off the mound
after the final out yesterday, a
blood stain streaked the back of
his right pant leg.
"Sometimes on the fastball, my
index finger comes through and
takes a chunk out of my thumb,"
Stanford pitcher Scott Weiss said.
"When you're pitching, all the
blood rushes down your arm. We
put a piece of tape on it, but it
was bugging me in the ninth."
Throughout the ninth inning,
Weiss could be seen rubbing the
index finger of his pitching hand
on the pant leg. As if the pressure
of relief pitching weren't enough,
Weiss had to maintain his com
posure as blood trickled onto the
baseball before every pitch.
No amount of pressure — or
blood — would affect Weiss' nasty
curveball on this day. He used it
to fan five batters in two innings,
slamming the door on Santa Clara
in the Cardinal's 6-4 victory. It
was Weiss' team-leading third
save of the season.
Weiss has now finished each of
the last three ball games for Stan
ford — he saved Saturday's game
against California, suffered a loss
to the Bears Sunday and saved
yesterday's contest.
"I went through the stiffness
part of it after throwing Sunday.
Today it felt pretty good," Weiss
said. "Over the last three games,
I've thrown the ball the best that
I have since the beginning of the
season."
When starter Mike Mussina
went down with an iiyury on
March 3, former stopper Steve
Chitren was forced into a starting
role. That made Weiss the man
out of the Cardinal bullpen when
the game's on the line. And he
loves it.
"I was a field player when I got
here. They watched me pitch and
told me they wanted me to pitch,
too," Weiss said. "As a reliever,
you're playing in a lot more games
than as a starter, and you're in
the tight games. It provides some
excitement."
Weiss started the year as the
second man out of Stanford's bull
pen. He slumped badly in mid
season when he was temporarily
moved into a starting role.
"When I was starting, I lost my
breaking ball. It didn't have a
hard bite on it,"he said. "My

ERA as a reliever is about 3.60,
and when I start it's like 10.70.
As a stopper, you want somebody
to strike people out, and with my
breaker I'm capable of that."
When it's right, Weiss' breaking
ball — he likes to call it a "slurve"
— is the best on the Stanford
pitching staff. It breaks more than
a slider, but is thrown harder and
breaks later than a curve.
Whatever it's called, it conjures
up memories of former Cardinal
Lee Plemel's curveball.

'As a reliever, you're
playing in a lot more
games than as a
starter, and you're in
the tight games. It
provides some excite
ment.'

With Chitren graduating in
June, the sophomore Weiss is
being groomed to continue in the
role of closer next season. That
should be no problem for Weiss,
who has shown this year he can
come back and pitch with little
or no rest. Weiss has appeared in
26 ball games, most on the club.
"My arm feels tired (after three
games in a row), but if I have
something left in my arm, I'll give
it to them," Weiss said.
It's just that kind of attitude
that allowed Chitren to pitch the
final out in each of the last two
College World Series. In his three
seasons as Stanford's stopper,
Chitren learned how to deal with
pressure.
Weiss admits he wasn't
equipped at first to deal with the
emotional roller coaster that is
relief pitching.
"I couldn't deal with the emo
tional aspect of being the goat. I
called my parents and talked to
them. You've just got to find a
balance. The good is easy to take.
If you can take the bad and come
back, you'll be successful," Weiss
said.
Yesterday Weiss proved he
could handle the bad — a tough
loss to the Bears on Sunday —
by shutting down Santa Clara in
a crucial game for the playoff
hopeful Cardinal.
