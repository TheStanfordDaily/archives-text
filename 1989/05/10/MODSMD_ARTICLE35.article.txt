# After injuries, Rossides looks to future
## 
### Mark Rogowsky Editorial staff 
When Eleni Rossides came to
Stanford four years ago as one of
the top tennis recruits in the na
tion, Rossides, Coach Frank Bren
nan and the Cardinal faithful all
expected big things.
The Stanford tennis program

was hot and so was Rossides. To
gether, the wisdom went, the two
could win championships. And
they did. At least sort of.
Rossides, you see, has not
played much for the Cardinal dur
ing her tenure here. Injury after
injury kept her on the sidelines
and out of the action.
"It's not exactly what I expected

my college experience to be," Ros
sides say 8.
Still, as a sophomore and junior,
Rossides found enough strength
to play during the NCAA cham
pionships. One could argue that
without her help, Stanford might
not have come home from Los
Angeles wearing the national
crown the past two years.
Rossides has fond memories of
those times. "Some of the most
exciting matches I've played have
been through college tennis," she
says, citing last year's doubles
match in which she and Teri Whit
linger clinched the team title for
Stanford.
And, despite what the casual
observer might think, Rossides
casts the time she spent here in
a positive light. "It hasn't all been
terrible," she says."I hope I've
learned from it.
"You learn a lot about a team
aspect," she continues, explaining
that tennis outside of college is
almost always a you-against-me
proposition. "It's definitely a
unique experience."
Even the ii\juries have been a
learning experience. "In my opin
ion all my injuries took longer
than they should have," Rossides
says.
Part of the problem was that
she took "bad advice." During her
freshman year, she had shin
splints and was in a great deal of
pain. "[But] people told be to play
through them," she remembers.
The result was stress fractures,
an early end to her freshman
season and a sophomore year dur
ing which she saw very little ac
tion.
Despite everything, she has got
ten to the point that she even
considers herself somewhat fortu
nate. "People have career-ending
injuries all the time," Rossides
says."I know people who've gone
through that. It puts my situation
in perspective.
"I still have a chance to go out
and play my sport."
Rossides figures even though
she's "lost time" in college, M I still
have plenty of time to achieve
what I wanted to achieve."
Meanwhile, "I've got my degree
... I've accomplished something

'People have career
ending injuries all the
time. I know people
who've gone through
that. It puts my situa
tion in perspective. I
still have a chance to
go out and play my
sport;

(at Stanford)."
Still, things would've been dif
ferent if she been on the court
these past four years. Rossides
sayB it's been "frustrating" for
herself and Brennan. She says
Brennan asks her the same ques
tions every week: "How re you
doing? What's going on? Why
aren't you playing?"
And, while Rossides feels good
about her relationship with Bren
nan, she knows it might have been
better. "We would've been closer
had I been playing for four years,"
she sayB.
Instead, she would sit on the
sidelines and watch. To Rossides,
that has been"the worst part.
Absolutely, the worst part."
Is that because when the team
is struggling you wish you could
be out there helping? Rossides
says not really "It's not whether
you're winning or losing . . You
just want to be part (of the ac
tion)."
In the past, Rossides could al
ways look to next year and believe
things would change This season,
she knows there is no next year
and has become somewhat dis
tanced from the team.
Sometimes, during a match,
Rossides will leave before every
thing is over. U I usually am
around until I know we're fine,
and then I go," she says"I don't
think it's good for me to be around
if I'm being sort of negative"
about being unable to play
That regret is especially acute
