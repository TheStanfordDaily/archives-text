# Ahoy! Next port for sailors, Chicago
## 
### Hugh R. Bethell Staff writer 
By the time all was said and done at this weekend's
Pacific Coast Championships in Los Angeles, the
Stanford sailing team had realized a long-standing
goal. By finishing second in team racing and fourth
in fleet racing at the event, the Cardinal qualified
for this year's national championships, to be held
in Chicago at the beginning of June.
In order to qualify for the team racing portion
of the nationals, Stanford had to battle against the
region's best for a spot in the top two. During the
team racing, Stanford proved itself by beating out
squads from USC, California, and UC-Santa Cruz.
UC-Irvine will join Stanford at the national event.
Though the Cardinal failed to qualify for the fleet
racing portion, the team did not miss by much.
Stanford finished ahead of seven of the region s
best schools, including California, and missed qual
ifying only by the few points that separated them
from third-place UC-Santa Barbara and second-place
USC. UC-Irvine and USC will represent the region
at the fleet racing nationals.
During the dinghy eliminations, Stanford was led
by junior Robert Brown and sophomore Heidi Park
in the A division, who narrowly missed third place
in their division. In the B division, seniors Ev Rend
and Amy Baltzer shared the boat with sophomores
Dave Dowd, Rick Rosen and Rebecca Bryson. The
five together finished in sixth place.

Stanford's fortune took a turn for the better on
Monday, as the fleet racing ended and team racing
began. Team racing is to fleet racing as doubles is
to singles in tennis. Team racing is even more com
plex, though, as three pairs of sailors work together
to defeat another team of three pairs by slowing
the opposition down to let teammates pass.
Rend and Baltzer, Brown and Park, and Rosen
and Bryson sailed a circuitous route to second place
in the event. Along the way they handed the defend
ing national champions from Irvine their only loss,
but ended up tied with USC when a jury's decision
gave California a victory in one of its races with
Stanford.
In order to break the tie with USC, Stanford
headed back out on to the water at the end of the
day for a single deciding race against the Trojans.
In what spectators described as the most
miraculous comeback of the season, the Cardinal
recovered from a dismal start to race past all three
USC boats and into first and second place. For
senior Rend, whose collegiate sailing career could
have come to an end with that race, the victory
was especially sweet.
"For a while I thought we were doomed, but when
I heard the rest of the team cheering from shore,
I began to see we had done the impossible," Rend
said.
"We did what we needed to do, and now we're
headed to Chicago," Stanford Coach Blake Mid
dleton said.
