# 8-3? With Smith at the helm, anything's possible
## 
### 
Summer. It turns me upside down.
Summer. Summer. Summer . . .
It seems likes a perfect time
to talk football.
The big story out of spring practice
is that the Cardinal has a new quar
terback — for the fifth time in two
years. Ever since John Paye graduat
ed, separated shoulder and all, Stan
ford's been looking for his replacement.

First, it was Greg Ennis. Next up:
Scott Stark. Then Brian Johnson.
After him, Jason Palumbis. The new
kid in town is Strappin' Steve Smith,
a 6-foot-4, 220-pound gunslinger from
the bayou.
He is big (to say the least), he is
strong (can bench Coach Denny
Green), h* has an 1 accurate arm
(throws the ball on a straight line to
his receivers), and seems to possess
the most elusive of quarterback
credentials — leadership ability
The thinking here is that Smith
need not be a superstar. What he must

prove is that he is consistent enough
to do the job each times he takes the
field. The Cardinal QB Shuffle of
recent years resulted from an endless
ebb and flow of confidence in whoever
was currently holding the mantle.
From all indications, Smith may
have the equanimity to smooth out
those peaks and valleys. And Stanford
fans, regardless of whether they were
pulling for Smith, Johnson or
Palumbis, should hope he can.
For the one thing that seems certain
is yet another midseason recasting of
the quarterback role virtually guaran
tees yet another "building" year when,
lo and behold, this might be a
"bowling" year.
A bowl game? Yes, a bowl game!
With a whole mess of return
ing starters — seven on offense,
eight on defense and the placekicker
— and in infusion of new talent
through newly eligible redshirts and
highly-touted recruits, the 1989 edi
tion of the Stanford Cardinal promises
to be quite competitive, indeed.
In addition to playing defending na
tional champion Notre Dame, Stanford
faces and a typically rugged schedule
in the Pacific 10 Conference — the
toughest league in the country. It's
the kind of schedule that impresses
bowl-game representatives when a
school comes through it with a solid
record.
The Cardinal should do just that.

The Cardinal QB
Shuffle resulted from an
endless ebb and flow of
confidence in whoever
was holding the mantle.

Consider the following:
Stanford opens on the road with
Arizona and Oregon State before re
turning home for matchups against
Oregon and San Jose State. In all four
games, Green's troops will go out
feeling they should win.
History seems to suggest that early
season success propels the Cardinal to
greater heights than the pundits imag
ine. An upset of Texas in the first
game of the Gator Bowl year is a case
in point. In 1989, Stanford might just
be 4-0 heading into the Oct. 7 show
down with national champ Notre
Dame.
Will the Cardinal slay the Fighting
Irish? Clearly, no one knows for cer
tain. The fact of the matter is, how
ever, it might not ridiculous a
notion then as it is now.
In the second half of the season,
there will be a Washington State game
in Pullman, a Utah contest here and
another chance to trample the hated
Trojans in Southern California. Can

you say 6-2?
Better yet, can't you see 6-2?
The last three games are UCLA at
Stanford, a road trip to Arizona State
and Big Game on the Farm. It doesn't
take a genius to see the collective
mouths of the alumni watering at this
point. A winning season seems likely;
an 8-3 season is by no means out of
the question.
It is apparent that the play of Smith
will be a key determinant of just
how well the team does this fall.
All the high hopes could be dashed if
Smith can't do tht job, the team starts
slow and the quarterback controversy
heats up again.
Without playing a down, though,
Smith provides reason for optimism.
Let us not forget who he had to beat
out for the job.
Two years ago, Johnson took the
helm of an 0-4 team and guided it to
five wins in its last seven game. He
is not a bad quarterback.
Last year, Palumbis showed poise
and a deadly accurate arm. He is not
a bad quarterback either.
That Smith has beaten them both
out suggests that he could be a very
good If that
proves true, Stanford could be a very
good football team in 1989.
I understand season tickets are on
sale now. They just might be a hot
item before too long.
