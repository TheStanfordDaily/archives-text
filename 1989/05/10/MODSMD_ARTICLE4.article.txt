# The 						fickle jar: Cold fusion experiment still draws fire and heat
## 
### Jock Friedly Editorial staff 
Frazzled from overwork but undaunted
by criticism, Materials Sciences Prof.
Robert Huggins says he still is getting
heat from his little jar of water.
While Huggins will not speculate
whether he is seeing cold fusion, he says
he thinks no chemical reaction could be
responsible for the heat he is seeing.
However, Huggins faces critics — par
ticularly Physics Prof. Walter Meyerhof
— who think he has fallen victim to
hidden difficulties in measuring the en
ergy put into the jar and measuring the
heat coming out.

Huggins discounts ob
jections to his experimen
tal procedures, but he
has been ruthless in
verifying his experi
ments. One by one,
Huggins has apparently
addressed the concerns
of physicists by contin
ued experiments.
However, the cold fu-

sion controversy still swirls around the
two principal players, Stanley Pons of
Utah and Martin Fleischmann of Eng
land, who first made the announcement
that they had found cold fusion.
Next to those two, who have achieved

both fame and infamy, Huggins is simply
a supporting actor. While physicists grill
the vulnerable Pons and Fleischmann,
relatively few have tried to find the weak
nesses in the Huggins results, which have
been the strongest confirmation of the
Utah findings yet.
"We stand convinced that we didn't do
anything wrong in our experiment," Hug
gins says confidently. "The heat effects
are well established."
If the scientists are generating heat,
they aren't generating any other convinc
ing evidence for cold fusion. Huggins,
though, has clearly separated himself
from the claims of cold fusion.
But for Huggins, who was previously

working on technology applicable to
making new batteries, heat energy is all
that matters. All he wants out of this,
he says, is a new kind of battery, whether
or not it happens to be from the process
of cold fusion.
Over the past few weeks, many other
physicists have criticized Huggins and
other electrochemists for claiming that
by connecting a car battery to a palladium
electrode, excess heat could be created.
What that heat may be — new physics,
new chemistry or just plain sloppy science
— has captivated scientists and the public
for weeks.
About 1,800 electrochemists gathered
for a big powwow in Los Angeles this

week at a meeting of the Electrochemical
Society. The meeting turned into an in
quisition of Pons and Fleischmann, but
scientists and the press did not pay much
attention to Huggins, who announced
that his data strongly contradicted the
opponents and defended the accuracy of
his experiment.
Even though they threw a few trump
cards Monday night, the electrochemists
have yet to play the ace in the cold fusion
quest that will convince the physicists.
No convincing measurements of neutrons
or helium, two signatures of fusion, have
been reported.


Huggins
"[The meeting] was a kind of
let-down," according to Jacob
Jorne, a chemical engineer from
the University of Rochester who
spoke there. "There is nothing
new really."
Although the ante in this game
is low — cold fusion experiments
cost relatively little money — the
stakes are high. The fever for fu
sion has become a fever for
patents that could control the
market for this potential, but un
likely, source of virtually limitless,

clean energy.
At the center of the fusion
debate is whether researchers
have measured the heat correctly.
The calorimetry — the mea
surement of heat — is not as easy
as it might seem, say many sci
entists. Although it basically con
sists of putting a thermometer in
the experiment, the interpretation
of that temperature is the difficult
part.
"There are so many ways to
make mistakes," said Stanford
Chemistry Prof. James Collman.
Last week, physicists in a con

vention at Baltimore criticized
Huggins and the Utah scientists
for not stirring the water in their
fusion jar. By not doing that, they
did not have a uniform tempera
ture in their water bath, physi
cists said.
"They probably don't measure
the right temperature," Meyerhof
says.
Scientists who have performed
the experiment said that the large
number of bubbles formed at the
palladium electrode cause suffi
cient mixing. "This argument of
ineffective mixing really doesn't

hold water," Fleischmann told the
electrochemists in Los Angeles.
And now, Huggins says he has
performed experiments in which
he stirred the water at different
rates, demonstrating that the ef
fect continues.
Meyerhof argues, though, that
an even more significant source
of error might be present with
the calorimetry. "In principle, er
rors can be made in the calibra
tion," Meyerhof says.
Calibrating a calorimeter — de
termining how much heat a tem
perature reading corresponds to
— is tricky, he says. For any one
experiment, scientists can't seem
to agree on a uniform method for
calibration.
In light of his recent experi
ments, Huggins disagreed with as
sessments that the calorimetry
was in error. "[The experiments]
completely rebuff the charges that
people have made about the
calorimetry," concludes Huggins.
"The calorimetry is real."
Most impressive and harder to
refute, Huggins points out, is that
his controlled experiment demon
strated that hydrogen and deuter
ium, an isotope of hydrogen,
produce different amounts of heat.
Because fusion occurs with deu
terium and not hydrogen, that
finding is necessary, but by no
means sufficient, to prove that fu
sion is causing the heat.
Although Huggins is the only
one to have publicized his find
ings, at least one other team
found a difference in the heat gen
erated by hydrogen and deuteri
um. In similar experiments, Digby
Mac Donald, an electrochemist at
SRI International in Menlo Park,
measured more heat in the deu
terium experiment than in the hy
drogen experiment.
However, the SRI scientists ig
nored their data because they felt
too many uncertainties and errors

could have crept into the meas
urements. Now they are trying to
measure neutrons emitted from
the jar; after one week they have
not seen any sign of the neutrons
that are needed to verify the ex
periment.
"The heat argument doesn't
impress me much," said Mac-
Donald, speaking of the Huggins'
findings.
Despite such criticism, Huggins
says helium and neutrons are not
important. Heat is the most im
portant thing to measure, he says.
Meyerhof disagrees. Over the
past few weeks, he has performed
calculations that he thinks can
easily explain the differences in
the measurements between the
hydrogen and deuterium reac
tions.
The differences are due to what
is called the "overvoltage effect,"
he says. When a current is passed
through an electrode, some energy
splits the heavy water — water
made of deuterium in the place
of hydrogen — and ideally the
rest produces heat directly related
to the current.
Overvoltage effects depend on
a number of factors, including the
current passed through the
electrode and the surface condi
tions of the electrode. "[Overvol
tage effects] are all those
processes you don't understand,"
Meyerhof explains.
The higher the overvoltage, the
greater the observed heat should
be. Using values for the overvol
tages for the hydrogen and the
deuterium published by Pons and
Fleischmann, Meyerhof says he
calculated that this effect could
easily account for the heat differ
ence Huggins was seeing.
But Huggins discounts the over
voltage effect too. "This is a red
herring," Huggins says.
Why are the physicists so
against cold fusion? Because, they

say, it violates everything they
have cherished about nuclear
physics for the last few decades.
Fusion powers the sun's 10-
million-degree furnace, and except
for what is known as muon
catalyzed fusion, it cannot occur
at room temperature — or at least
not often. So rare is fusion at
ordinary temperatures, that if the
entire Earth were deuterium, only
one pair of deuterium atoms
would likely fuse in about a mil
lion billion years.
Although they might not say it
directly, Pons and Fleischmann —
who were wedded to cold fusion
— now stop short of saying that
they are seeing fusion. Rather,
they say they see heat that cannot
be explained by chemical means.

Although Huggins is the only
one to have publicized his find
ings, at least one other team
found a difference in the heat gen
erated by hydrogen and deuteri
um. In similar experiments, Digby
Mac Donald, an electrochemist at
SRI International in Menlo Park,
measured more heat in the deu
terium experiment than in the hy
drogen experiment.
However, the SRI scientists ig
nored their data because they felt
too many uncertainties and errors

could have crept into the meas
urements. Now they are trying to
measure neutrons emitted from
the jar; after one week they have
not seen any sign of the neutrons
that are needed to verify the ex
periment.
"The heat argument doesn't
impress me much," said Mac-
Donald, speaking of the Huggins'
findings.
Despite such criticism, Huggins
says helium and neutrons are not
important. Heat is the most im
portant thing to measure, he says.
Meyerhof disagrees. Over the
past few weeks, he has performed
calculations that he thinks can
easily explain the differences in
the measurements between the
hydrogen and deuterium reac
tions.
The differences are due to what
is called the "overvoltage effect,"
he says. When a current is passed
through an electrode, some energy
splits the heavy water — water
made of deuterium in the place
of hydrogen — and ideally the
rest produces heat directly related
to the current.
Overvoltage effects depend on
a number of factors, including the
current passed through the
electrode and the surface condi
tions of the electrode. "[Overvol
tage effects] are all those
processes you don't understand,"
Meyerhof explains.
The higher the overvoltage, the
greater the observed heat should
be. Using values for the overvol
tages for the hydrogen and the
deuterium published by Pons and
Fleischmann, Meyerhof says he
calculated that this effect could
easily account for the heat differ
ence Huggins was seeing.
But Huggins discounts the over
voltage effect too. "This is a red
herring," Huggins says.

have cherished about nuclear
physics for the last few decades.
Fusion powers the sun's 10-
million-degree furnace, and except
for what is known as muon
catalyzed fusion, it cannot occur
at room temperature — or at least
not often. So rare is fusion at
ordinary temperatures, that if the
entire Earth were deuterium, only
one pair of deuterium atoms
would likely fuse in about a mil
lion billion years.
Although they might not say it
directly, Pons and Fleischmann —
who were wedded to cold fusion
— now stop short of saying that
they are seeing fusion. Rather,
they say they see heat that cannot
be explained by chemical means.

Jeff Sneller — Daily
Frazzled from overwork but undaunted
by criticism, Materials Sciences Prof.
Robert Huggins says he still is getting
heat from his little jar of water.
While Huggins will not speculate
whether he is seeing cold fusion, he says
he thinks no chemical reaction could be
responsible for the heat he is seeing.
However, Huggins faces critics — par
ticularly Physics Prof. Walter Meyerhof
— who think he has fallen victim to
hidden difficulties in measuring the en
ergy put into the jar and measuring the
heat coming out.

Huggins discounts ob
jections to his experimen
tal procedures, but he
has been ruthless in
verifying his experi
ments. One by one,
Huggins has apparently
addressed the concerns
of physicists by contin
ued experiments.
However, the cold fu-

sion controversy still swirls around the
two principal players, Stanley Pons of
Utah and Martin Fleischmann of Eng
land, who first made the announcement
that they had found cold fusion.
Next to those two, who have achieved

both fame and infamy, Huggins is simply
a supporting actor. While physicists grill
the vulnerable Pons and Fleischmann,
relatively few have tried to find the weak
nesses in the Huggins results, which have
been the strongest confirmation of the
Utah findings yet.
"We stand convinced that we didn't do
anything wrong in our experiment," Hug
gins says confidently. "The heat effects
are well established."
If the scientists are generating heat,
they aren't generating any other convinc
ing evidence for cold fusion. Huggins,
though, has clearly separated himself
from the claims of cold fusion.
But for Huggins, who was previously

working on technology applicable to
making new batteries, heat energy is all
that matters. All he wants out of this,
he says, is a new kind of battery, whether
or not it happens to be from the process
of cold fusion.
Over the past few weeks, many other
physicists have criticized Huggins and
other electrochemists for claiming that
by connecting a car battery to a palladium
electrode, excess heat could be created.
What that heat may be — new physics,
new chemistry or just plain sloppy science
— has captivated scientists and the public
for weeks.
About 1,800 electrochemists gathered
for a big powwow in Los Angeles this

week at a meeting of the Electrochemical
Society. The meeting turned into an in
quisition of Pons and Fleischmann, but
scientists and the press did not pay much
attention to Huggins, who announced
that his data strongly contradicted the
opponents and defended the accuracy of
his experiment.
Even though they threw a few trump
cards Monday night, the electrochemists
have yet to play the ace in the cold fusion
quest that will convince the physicists.
No convincing measurements of neutrons
or helium, two signatures of fusion, have
been reported.


Huggins
"[The meeting] was a kind of
let-down," according to Jacob
Jorne, a chemical engineer from
the University of Rochester who
spoke there. "There is nothing
new really."
Although the ante in this game
is low — cold fusion experiments
cost relatively little money — the
stakes are high. The fever for fu
sion has become a fever for
patents that could control the
market for this potential, but un
likely, source of virtually limitless,

clean energy.
At the center of the fusion
debate is whether researchers
have measured the heat correctly.
The calorimetry — the mea
surement of heat — is not as easy
as it might seem, say many sci
entists. Although it basically con
sists of putting a thermometer in
the experiment, the interpretation
of that temperature is the difficult
part.
"There are so many ways to
make mistakes," said Stanford
Chemistry Prof. James Collman.
Last week, physicists in a con

vention at Baltimore criticized
Huggins and the Utah scientists
for not stirring the water in their
fusion jar. By not doing that, they
did not have a uniform tempera
ture in their water bath, physi
cists said.
"They probably don't measure
the right temperature," Meyerhof
says.
Scientists who have performed
the experiment said that the large
number of bubbles formed at the
palladium electrode cause suffi
cient mixing. "This argument of
ineffective mixing really doesn't

hold water," Fleischmann told the
electrochemists in Los Angeles.
And now, Huggins says he has
performed experiments in which
he stirred the water at different
rates, demonstrating that the ef
fect continues.
Meyerhof argues, though, that
an even more significant source
of error might be present with
the calorimetry. "In principle, er
rors can be made in the calibra
tion," Meyerhof says.
Calibrating a calorimeter — de
termining how much heat a tem
perature reading corresponds to
— is tricky, he says. For any one
experiment, scientists can't seem
to agree on a uniform method for
calibration.
In light of his recent experi
ments, Huggins disagreed with as
sessments that the calorimetry
was in error. "[The experiments]
completely rebuff the charges that
people have made about the
calorimetry," concludes Huggins.
"The calorimetry is real."
Most impressive and harder to
refute, Huggins points out, is that
his controlled experiment demon
strated that hydrogen and deuter
ium, an isotope of hydrogen,
produce different amounts of heat.
Because fusion occurs with deu
terium and not hydrogen, that
finding is necessary, but by no
means sufficient, to prove that fu
sion is causing the heat.
Although Huggins is the only
one to have publicized his find
ings, at least one other team

quisition of Pons and Fleischmann, but
scientists and the press did not pay much
attention to Huggins, who announced
that his data strongly contradicted the
opponents and defended the accuracy of
his experiment.
Even though they threw a few trump
cards Monday night, the electrochemists
have yet to play the ace in the cold fusion
quest that will convince the physicists.
No convincing measurements of neutrons
or helium, two signatures of fusion, have
been reported.

"[The meeting] was a kind of
let-down," according to Jacob
Jorne, a chemical engineer from
the University of Rochester who
spoke there. "There is nothing
new really."
Although the ante in this game
is low — cold fusion experiments
cost relatively little money — the
stakes are high. The fever for fu
sion has become a fever for
patents that could control the
market for this potential, but un
likely, source of virtually limitless,

clean energy.
At the center of the fusion
debate is whether researchers
have measured the heat correctly.
The calorimetry — the mea
surement of heat — is not as easy
as it might seem, say many sci
entists. Although it basically con
sists of putting a thermometer in
the experiment, the interpretation
of that temperature is the difficult
part.
"There are so many ways to
make mistakes," said Stanford
Chemistry Prof. James Collman.
Last week, physicists in a con

vention at Baltimore criticized
Huggins and the Utah scientists
for not stirring the water in their
fusion jar. By not doing that, they
did not have a uniform tempera
ture in their water bath, physi
cists said.
"They probably don't measure
the right temperature," Meyerhof
says.
Scientists who have performed
the experiment said that the large
number of bubbles formed at the
palladium electrode cause suffi
cient mixing. "This argument of
ineffective mixing really doesn't

hold water," Fleischmann told the
electrochemists in Los Angeles.
And now, Huggins says he has
performed experiments in which
he stirred the water at different
rates, demonstrating that the ef
fect continues.
Meyerhof argues, though, that
an even more significant source
of error might be present with
the calorimetry. "In principle, er
rors can be made in the calibra
tion," Meyerhof says.
Calibrating a calorimeter — de
termining how much heat a tem
perature reading corresponds to
— is tricky, he says. For any one
experiment, scientists can't seem
to agree on a uniform method for
calibration.
In light of his recent experi
ments, Huggins disagreed with as
sessments that the calorimetry
was in error. "[The experiments]
completely rebuff the charges that
people have made about the
calorimetry," concludes Huggins.
"The calorimetry is real."
Most impressive and harder to
refute, Huggins points out, is that
his controlled experiment demon
strated that hydrogen and deuter
ium, an isotope of hydrogen,
produce different amounts of heat.
Because fusion occurs with deu
terium and not hydrogen, that
finding is necessary, but by no
means sufficient, to prove that fu
sion is causing the heat.
Although Huggins is the only
one to have publicized his find
ings, at least one other team
found a difference in the heat gen
erated by hydrogen and deuteri
um. In similar experiments, Digby
Mac Donald, an electrochemist at
SRI International in Menlo Park,
measured more heat in the deu
terium experiment than in the hy
drogen experiment.
However, the SRI scientists ig
nored their data because they felt
too many uncertainties and errors

could have crept into the meas
urements. Now they are trying to
measure neutrons emitted from
the jar; after one week they have
not seen any sign of the neutrons
that are needed to verify the ex
periment.
"The heat argument doesn't
impress me much," said Mac-
Donald, speaking of the Huggins'
findings.
Despite such criticism, Huggins
says helium and neutrons are not
important. Heat is the most im
portant thing to measure, he says.
Meyerhof disagrees. Over the
past few weeks, he has performed
calculations that he thinks can
easily explain the differences in
the measurements between the
hydrogen and deuterium reac
tions.
The differences are due to what
is called the "overvoltage effect,"
he says. When a current is passed
through an electrode, some energy
splits the heavy water — water
made of deuterium in the place
of hydrogen — and ideally the
rest produces heat directly related
to the current.
Overvoltage effects depend on
a number of factors, including the
current passed through the
electrode and the surface condi
tions of the electrode. "[Overvol
tage effects] are all those
processes you don't understand,"
Meyerhof explains.
The higher the overvoltage, the
greater the observed heat should
be. Using values for the overvol
tages for the hydrogen and the
deuterium published by Pons and
Fleischmann, Meyerhof says he
calculated that this effect could
easily account for the heat differ
ence Huggins was seeing.
But Huggins discounts the over
voltage effect too. "This is a red
herring," Huggins says.
Why are the physicists so
against cold fusion? Because, they

Many scientists have registered
objections to the measurements
of heat in Stanford's "cold fu
sion" experiment because of in

ments.
say, it violates everything they
have cherished about nuclear
physics for the last few decades.
Fusion powers the sun's 10-
million-degree furnace, and except
for what is known as muon
catalyzed fusion, it cannot occur
at room temperature — or at least
not often. So rare is fusion at
ordinary temperatures, that if the
entire Earth were deuterium, only
one pair of deuterium atoms
would likely fuse in about a mil
lion billion years.
Although they might not say it
directly, Pons and Fleischmann —
who were wedded to cold fusion
— now stop short of saying that
they are seeing fusion. Rather,
they say they see heat that cannot
be explained by chemical means.

Physics Prof. Walter Meyerhof demonstrates an example of a cold fusion experiment. Meyerhof said
he has performed calculations showing experimental errors that have deluded scientists into thinking
enormous amounts of heat are being created in tiny jars.
