# The
						fickle jar: Cold fusion experiment still draws fire and heat
## 
### Jock Friedly Editorial staff 
Frazzled from overwork but undaunted
by criticism, Materials Sciences Prof.
Robert Huggins says he still is getting
heat from his little jar of water.
While Huggins will not speculate
whether he is seeing cold fusion, he says
he thinks no chemical reaction could be
responsible for the heat he is seeing.
However, Huggins faces critics — par
ticularly Physics Prof. Walter Meyerhof
— who think he has fallen victim to
hidden difficulties in measuring the en
ergy put into the jar and measuring the
heat coming out.

Huggins discounts ob
jections to his experimen
tal procedures, but he
has been ruthless in
verifying his experi
ments. One by one,
Huggins has apparently
addressed the concerns
of physicists by contin
ued experiments.
However, the cold fu-

sion controversy still swirls around the
two principal players, Stanley Pons of
Utah and Martin Fleischmann of Eng
land, who first made the announcement
that they had found cold fusion.
Next to those two, who have achieved

both fame and infamy, Huggins is simply
a supporting actor. While physicists grill
the vulnerable Pons and Fleischmann,
relatively few have tried to find the weak
nesses in the Huggins results, which have
been the strongest confirmation of the
Utah findings yet.
"We stand convinced that we didn't do
anything wrong in our experiment," Hug
gins says confidently. "The heat effects
are well established."
If the scientists are generating heat,
they aren't generating any other convinc
ing evidence for cold fusion. Huggins,
though, has clearly separated himself
from the claims of cold fusion.
But for Huggins, who was previously

working on technology applicable to
making new batteries, heat energy is all
that matters. All he wants out of this,
he says, is a new kind of battery, whether
or not it happens to be from the process
of cold fusion.
Over the past few weeks, many other
physicists have criticized Huggins and
other electrochemists for claiming that
by connecting a car battery to a palladium
electrode, excess heat could be created.
What that heat may be — new physics,
new chemistry or just plain sloppy science
— has captivated scientists and the public
for weeks.
About 1,800 electrochemists gathered
for a big powwow in Los Angeles this

week at a meeting of the Electrochemical
Society. The meeting turned into an in
quisition of Pons and Fleischmann, but
scientists and the press did not pay much
attention to Huggins, who announced
that his data strongly contradicted the
opponents and defended the accuracy of
his experiment.
Even though they threw a few trump
cards Monday night, the electrochemists
have yet to play the ace in the cold fusion
quest that will convince the physicists.
No convincing measurements of neutrons
or helium, two signatures of fusion, have
been reported.
