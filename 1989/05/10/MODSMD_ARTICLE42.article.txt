• "Jim" is a senior and a member of a housed
fraternity that easily meets its Rush quota. He
says he's "seen quite a few women, including
some sorority girls. I dated them because I wanted
to." This year he had his first relationship with
another man, a friend from freshman year.
Jim joined the fraternity because he felt he
would build "closer and longer-lasting friendships
than in a regular dorm." He has never been
attracted to another man living in his house.
"It's kinda funny, but I never felt I could be
attracted to someone I lived with," he says.
• "Daniel" is a senior and a member of a housed
fraternity that sometimes has difficulty meeting
its Rush quota. He says he rushed "out of inse
curity, to prove to myself I could get in. I wanted
affirmation from a heterosexual environment so
I knew I wouldn't have to be gay." Daniel is
bisexual and says,"I never lied to myself about
being attracted to men. I never had a crush on
a straight guy. I wouldn't let myself; I always
had a girlfriend to focus on, to take the tension
off."

Daniel has had several relationships with men,
including a member of another fraternity.
• "Mark" is a member of an unhoused fraternity
He knows three other gays in his fraternity and
two in another. "None of us went up to the
others and said it, but it became known. I heard
someone was dating someone, or ran into sonie
one in the Stud (a San Francisco gay bar).
Mark says he leads a "double life, keeping
his social life in the fraternity separate from his
social life in the gay community. His gay frater
nity friends don't spend a lot of time together
at fraternity events, he says, but "call each other
on the weekends." Mark says,"I couldn t imagine
dating another (member of my fraternity); that s
too much cross-over."
• "Emily" is a senior and a member of a sorority.
She joined because she "wanted to meet other
girls," though she didn't yet know she was
bisexual. She has become less active in her
sorority because it "didn't feel like a woman
oriented thing."
