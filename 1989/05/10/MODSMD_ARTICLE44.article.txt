• Brent Danninger was a Sigma Alpha Epsilon
who came out to close friends during his years
living in the fraternity, 1977-80. He realized he
was gay the summer after accepting his bid, after
falling in love with a student who lived in his
fraternity room the first three months. He also
dated a Sigma Chi and a Phi Delta Theta. "At
one point (some friends and I) figured out we
knew at least one gay person in each fraternity
on campus," Danninger says. He has been
"married" to another man for two years.
• Cliff Colvin was an SAE from 1977-80 who
rushed because "I liked the activities. I liked the
fact that these people cared about each other,
and I liked the location of the house."
Colvin, Danninger and Rob Kinsey, another
gay SAE who was president of the College Re
publicans at Stanford, came out together and
have remained close friends.
Colvin wasn't sure he was gay when he joined
SAE, although he says he had experimented with
homosexuality.

• "Spencer" was a Phi Delt who graduated in
1985. He was a talented varsity athlete competing
in one of Stanford's most successful sports. Spen
cer wanted to let The Daily use his name, but
said he does not want former teammates to learn
he is gay through a newspaper article. He is open
with his friends and family. Spencer knew he
was gay his senior year of high school.
"When males bond there is a lot of awkward
ness," Spencer says. "When guys get really close,
a lot of people would think that it's homosexu
ality." To counter that perception, fraternity
members will act homophobic, he says.
• "Bill" was a Beta Theta Pi who reedized he
was gay freshman year. He rushed in part because
he was worried about housing; he drew 4997.
Bill lived in the house during 1979-80, his soph
omore year, and then went on to become a resident
assistant. He was out to all his close friends and
was involved in the gay community. He is now
a high-ranking Stanford administrator.
