# The
						Unseen Stanford: Gays & Lesbians in the Greek System
## Finding brotherhood, but hiding the truth 
### Elizabeth Howton Bob Michitarian Editorial staff 
Fraternities are said to be close
knit groups, bound by tradition
and secret rituals. Fraternity
brothers speak of bonding and
unity, and of being able to tell
fellow brothers anything. But
many brothers have a secret they
don't tell — they're gay.
No current member of any
Stanford fraternity has come out
to his group, according to a Daily
survey of all the presidents of
Stanford's 16 housed and un
housed fraternities.
But the gays are there.
Opening the community's eyes
Members of fraternities at all
levels of the Stanford system —
from among the most popular to

The Daily interviewed are largely
indistinguishable from non-gay
members. "I pretty much shared
the ideals and values of most
people in my house," said an
alumnus of Phi Delta Theta who
knew he was gay before he
rushed. U I was in the main
stream."
According to Fraternal Affairs
Adviser Joe Pisano, "We know
statistically that at least 10 per
cent of the population is gay; fra

temities are no different."
Telling only the closest friends
Most of those interviewed have
come out to a few close fraternity
brothers, who have been generally
supportive. "We didn't tell anyone
who we thought might have a bad

reaction," said Brent Danninger,
a gay member of Sigma Alpha
Epsilon who knew of five other
homosexual members of his house
by the time he graduated. "I only
