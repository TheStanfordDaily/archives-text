# The 						Unseen Stanford: Gays & Lesbians in the Greek System
## Finding brotherhood, but hiding the truth 
### Elizabeth Howton Bob Michitarian Editorial staff 
Fraternities are said to be close
knit groups, bound by tradition
and secret rituals. Fraternity
brothers speak of bonding and
unity, and of being able to tell
fellow brothers anything. But
many brothers have a secret they
don't tell — they're gay.
No current member of any
Stanford fraternity has come out
to his group, according to a Daily
survey of all the presidents of
Stanford's 16 housed and un
housed fraternities.
But the gays are there.
Opening the community's eyes
Members of fraternities at all
levels of the Stanford system —
from among the most popular to
the least, housed and unhoused,
past and present — have told The
Daily they are gay or bisexual. All
current students requested
anonymity, citing concern over
negative repercussions from fel
low fraternity members and
others.
Many said they agreed to talk
with The Daily because they
wanted to dispel the common
belief that there are no gays in
fraternities. "Maybe it will open
the (Stanford) community's eyes

'Maybe it will open

community's eyes

fraternities' eyes

types don't hold

— as well as the fraternities' eyes

The gay fraternity members
The Daily interviewed are largely
indistinguishable from non-gay
members. "I pretty much shared
the ideals and values of most
people in my house," said an
alumnus of Phi Delta Theta who
knew he was gay before he
rushed. U I was in the main
stream."
According to Fraternal Affairs
Adviser Joe Pisano, "We know
statistically that at least 10 per
cent of the population is gay; fra

temities are no different."
Telling only the closest friends
Most of those interviewed have
come out to a few close fraternity
brothers, who have been generally
supportive. "We didn't tell anyone
who we thought might have a bad

reaction," said Brent Danninger,
a gay member of Sigma Alpha
Epsilon who knew of five other
homosexual members of his house
by the time he graduated. "I only
told my closest friends. If someone

knows you and likes you, they
don't think it matters much," he
says.
Few turn to the Gay and Les
bian Alliance at Stanford, the so
cial and support arm of the Uni
versity's gay community, for fear
that word will get around campus.
"1 never went to GLAS," said one
alumnus. "They were too out, and
I wasn't ready for that then."
Some turn to University offi
cials. Director of the Row Diana
Conklin, who has overseen the
housed fraternities for nine years,
says she knows that a handful of
fraternity members have dis
cussed coming out to their houses
with resident assistants.
"Those are cases I know about
becase the RAs turned to me for
advice. Who knows how many
smaller, more private conversa
tions go on?" she said.
Others might turn to friends
outside the house or to gay sup
port groups, but many simply
remain silent.

Homophobic image
Several of the presidents The
Daily surveyed questioned why
gays would want to be part of a
fraternity.
The image of "fraternities in
general and of Sigma Chi is that
they are homophobic," said Sigma
Chi President Marty Hartigan.
That image is "unfair and unfor
tunate," Hartigan says, but "it
probably discourages gays from
rushing." None of the gay and
bisexual fraternity members in
terviewed, however, were deterred
from joining by the stereotype
that fraternities are homophobic.
Only one fraternity president
said he knows that some of his
members are gay, but he did so
on the condition that his frater
nity not be named in order to
protect their identities. Those
members are not out to the group,
he said.
Last year the Interfraternity
Council, the fraternities' govern
ing body, acknowledged that some
members of Stanford fraternities
are homophobic and encouraged
the fraternities to invite the Les
bian/Gay/Bisexual Speakers
Bureau to talk. Since then, about

half of the housed fraternities and
a few unhoused fraternities have
followed the recommendation.
'Homophobia is sad'
"Homophobia is sad," says IFC
President Chris Erlin.
Stressing the diversity of opin
ion in fraternities, Erlin said that
homophobia "is not an institu
tional problem in the fraternities;
it's an individual problem.
But there are no interfraternity
programs to deal with homopho
bia. The IFC is letting individual
groups address the problem them
selves.
The best way to combat homo
phobia in fraternities, Erlin says,
is for those gay members to come
out to their groups. "Ideally, if
someone who is already in the
house opened up to his best
friends, I think he would be much
better accepted,"
"It's kind of a Catch-22 situa
tion," Erlin says. His explanation:
Those fraternity members with
homophobic attitudes can't learn
about homosexuality until a gay
friend comes out, and gays in fra
ternities are unlikely to come out
as long as there are homophobic
attitudes.

a few unhoused fraternities have
followed the recommendation.
'Homophobia is sad'
"Homophobia is sad," says IFC
President Chris Erlin.
Stressing the diversity of opin
ion in fraternities, Erlin said that
homophobia "is not an institu
tional problem in the fraternities;
it's an individual problem.
But there are no interfraternity
programs to deal with homopho
bia. The IFC is letting individual
groups address the problem them
selves.
The best way to combat homo
phobia in fraternities, Erlin says,
is for those gay members to come
out to their groups. "Ideally, if
someone who is already in the
house opened up to his best
friends, I think he would be much
better accepted,"
"It's kind of a Catch-22 situa
tion," Erlin says. His explanation:
Those fraternity members with
homophobic attitudes can't learn
about homosexuality until a gay
friend comes out, and gays in fra
ternities are unlikely to come out
as long as there are homophobic
attitudes.
Fraternities are said to be close
knit groups, bound by tradition
and secret rituals. Fraternity
brothers speak of bonding and
unity, and of being able to tell
fellow brothers anything. But
many brothers have a secret they
don't tell — they're gay.
No current member of any
Stanford fraternity has come out
to his group, according to a Daily
survey of all the presidents of
Stanford's 16 housed and un
housed fraternities.
But the gays are there.
Opening the community's eyes
Members of fraternities at all
levels of the Stanford system —
from among the most popular to
the least, housed and unhoused,
past and present — have told The
Daily they are gay or bisexual. All
current students requested
anonymity, citing concern over
negative repercussions from fel
low fraternity members and
others.
Many said they agreed to talk
with The Daily because they
wanted to dispel the common
belief that there are no gays in
fraternities. "Maybe it will open
the (Stanford) community's eyes

The gay fraternity members
The Daily interviewed are largely
indistinguishable from non-gay
members. "I pretty much shared
the ideals and values of most
people in my house," said an
alumnus of Phi Delta Theta who
knew he was gay before he
rushed. U I was in the main
stream."
According to Fraternal Affairs
Adviser Joe Pisano, "We know
statistically that at least 10 per
cent of the population is gay; fra

temities are no different."
Telling only the closest friends
Most of those interviewed have
come out to a few close fraternity
brothers, who have been generally
supportive. "We didn't tell anyone
who we thought might have a bad

reaction," said Brent Danninger,
a gay member of Sigma Alpha
Epsilon who knew of five other
homosexual members of his house
by the time he graduated. "I only
told my closest friends. If someone

knows you and likes you, they
don't think it matters much," he
says.
Few turn to the Gay and Les
bian Alliance at Stanford, the so
cial and support arm of the Uni
versity's gay community, for fear
that word will get around campus.
"1 never went to GLAS," said one
alumnus. "They were too out, and
I wasn't ready for that then."
Some turn to University offi
cials. Director of the Row Diana
Conklin, who has overseen the
housed fraternities for nine years,
says she knows that a handful of
fraternity members have dis
cussed coming out to their houses
with resident assistants.
"Those are cases I know about
becase the RAs turned to me for
advice. Who knows how many
smaller, more private conversa
tions go on?" she said.
Others might turn to friends
outside the house or to gay sup
port groups, but many simply
remain silent.

Homophobic image
Several of the presidents The
Daily surveyed questioned why
gays would want to be part of a
fraternity.
The image of "fraternities in
general and of Sigma Chi is that
they are homophobic," said Sigma
Chi President Marty Hartigan.
That image is "unfair and unfor
tunate," Hartigan says, but "it
probably discourages gays from
rushing." None of the gay and
bisexual fraternity members in
terviewed, however, were deterred
from joining by the stereotype
that fraternities are homophobic.
Only one fraternity president
said he knows that some of his
members are gay, but he did so
on the condition that his frater
nity not be named in order to
protect their identities. Those
members are not out to the group,
he said.
Last year the Interfraternity
Council, the fraternities' govern
ing body, acknowledged that some
members of Stanford fraternities
are homophobic and encouraged
the fraternities to invite the Les
bian/Gay/Bisexual Speakers
Bureau to talk. Since then, about

half of the housed fraternities and
a few unhoused fraternities have
followed the recommendation.
