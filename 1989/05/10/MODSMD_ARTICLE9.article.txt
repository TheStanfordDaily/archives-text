# Supportive sisters?

Sisterhood.
It's a concept sororities and the
lesbian community have in com
mon — at least in theory. Soror
ities, as all-female institutions,
might be thought likely to be sup
portive of women's close relation
ships, including lesbianism.
Although this year's Rushbook
includes photographs of women
hugging each other and grinning
ecstatically, sororities at Stanford
Eire one area of campus life where
lesbianism is virtually invisible.
None of the six sorority presi
dents reached by The Daily knew
of any lesbian or bisexual women
in their sororities. Most did not
think there were any.
Five of the six said that if a
member came out to the group,
the reaction would be more pos
itive than negative. One said she
thought the members would be
"shocked" but that the gay woman
"would not be shunned."
Another president said, "We are
a support group."
Yet when "Emily," a senior who
is a member of a sorority, was a
sophomore, she heard just the op
posite.
There was a debate focusing on
whether the group's primary
function was to support one an
other or to meet men. The sorority
president settled the discussion by

Bringing sororities
back on campus
was 'a way to find
company and com
panionship with
other women in a
way that was ac
ceptable.'

saying, "We're not going to let
this be a women's support group."
Confusion and fear
Emily didn't think she was
bisexual when she rushed in her
freshman year.
"1 wanted to meet other girls,
to see what it was like, to see if
I could get a bid, to make friends
— all the usual reasons," she says.
Emily realized she was bisexual
about a year and a half later, and
has not come out to any of her
sorority sisters.
When the group hosted a
Gay/Lesbian/Bisexual Speakers
Bureau, "some women were cool,
but some were really shocked.
There's probably more homopho
bia in that sorority than the
average on campus. There's a lot
of confusion and fear (about les
bianism)," she said.
Emily has drifted away from
her sorority over the past few
years, not only due to her dis
covery that she is bisexual, but
also because of her feeling that
her sorority is far too "male
centered."
Women seeking women
"Caroline," a woman who was
involved in the movement to re
establish sororities here, feels that
it would be "sad" if the chapters
here became totally male-oriented.
"If it's about joining a group to
meet boys — yuck," she says.
For Caroline, who is lesbian,
bringing sororities back on
campus was "a way to find com
pany and companionship with
other women in a way that was
acceptable.... We didn't want it
to be like (the sororities at) USC,
but we wanted to attract women
who wouldn't go to the Women's
Center."

Mainly, she says, "We were
women seeking other women.
There were no labels." She thinks
there may have been other women
"grappling with the issue of
sexual identity ... we wouldn't
have defined ourselves as lesbians
at that point."
Caroline, an educator, is cur
rently in the third year of a rela
tionship with a woman. She has
not come out to any of her friends
from the sorority.
'Never went to formals'
"Sharon," a member of Kappa
Alpha Theta who was also active
in the Intersorority Council from
1980 to 1982, also feels that so
rorities were different in her day.
"I had had one relationship
with a woman, but she decided it
was all a giant mistake, and she
convinced me of that. So I decided
that the best way to get away
from her and her group of friends
was to rush," says Sharon.
"Sororities were very different
then, I think. There was no pres
sure to go to social functions with
men. ... I would go to the func
tions for women, not the formals."
She didn't come out to anyone
in her sorority; if she had, she

says, "They would have been very,
very surprised, but I doubt they
would have stopped talking to
me. . . . There wasn't as much fear
of lesbianism."
Closest friends
"Amy" also rushed a sorority,
Pi Beta Phi, after her first rela
tionship with a woman broke up.
"It was a devastating time, and I
needed something to fill the gap."
Amy hadn't defined herself as
lesbian when she rushed, and she
"didn't assume there were other
lesbians in the Greek system."
Amy has come out to her
group of friends from Pi Phi and
found them supportive. Although
she says "I've changed radically,"
she sees her sorority friends often
and adds, "some of them are still
my closest friends."

"It was a devastating time, and I
needed something to fill the gap."
Amy hadn't defined herself as
lesbian when she rushed, and she
"didn't assume there were other
lesbians in the Greek system."
Amy has come out to her
group of friends from Pi Phi and
found them supportive. Although
she says "I've changed radically,"
she sees her sorority friends often
and adds, "some of them are still
my closest friends."

Sisterhood.
It's a concept sororities and the
lesbian community have in com
mon — at least in theory. Soror
ities, as all-female institutions,
might be thought likely to be sup
portive of women's close relation
ships, including lesbianism.
Although this year's Rushbook
includes photographs of women
hugging each other and grinning
ecstatically, sororities at Stanford
Eire one area of campus life where
lesbianism is virtually invisible.
None of the six sorority presi
dents reached by The Daily knew
of any lesbian or bisexual women
in their sororities. Most did not
think there were any.
Five of the six said that if a
member came out to the group,
the reaction would be more pos
itive than negative. One said she
thought the members would be
"shocked" but that the gay woman
"would not be shunned."
Another president said, "We are
a support group."
Yet when "Emily," a senior who
is a member of a sorority, was a
sophomore, she heard just the op
posite.
There was a debate focusing on
whether the group's primary
function was to support one an
other or to meet men. The sorority
president settled the discussion by

Bringing sororities
back on campus
was 'a way to find
company and com
panionship with
other women in a
way that was ac
ceptable.'

saying, "We're not going to let
this be a women's support group."
Confusion and fear
Emily didn't think she was
bisexual when she rushed in her
freshman year.
"1 wanted to meet other girls,
to see what it was like, to see if
I could get a bid, to make friends
— all the usual reasons," she says.
Emily realized she was bisexual
about a year and a half later, and
has not come out to any of her
sorority sisters.
When the group hosted a
Gay/Lesbian/Bisexual Speakers
Bureau, "some women were cool,
but some were really shocked.
There's probably more homopho
bia in that sorority than the
average on campus. There's a lot
of confusion and fear (about les
bianism)," she said.
Emily has drifted away from
her sorority over the past few
years, not only due to her dis
covery that she is bisexual, but
also because of her feeling that
her sorority is far too "male
centered."
Women seeking women
"Caroline," a woman who was
involved in the movement to re
establish sororities here, feels that
it would be "sad" if the chapters
here became totally male-oriented.
"If it's about joining a group to
meet boys — yuck," she says.
For Caroline, who is lesbian,
bringing sororities back on
campus was "a way to find com
pany and companionship with
other women in a way that was
acceptable.... We didn't want it
to be like (the sororities at) USC,
but we wanted to attract women
who wouldn't go to the Women's
Center."

Mainly, she says, "We were
women seeking other women.
There were no labels." She thinks
there may have been other women
"grappling with the issue of
sexual identity ... we wouldn't
have defined ourselves as lesbians
at that point."
Caroline, an educator, is cur
rently in the third year of a rela
tionship with a woman. She has
not come out to any of her friends
from the sorority.
'Never went to formals'
"Sharon," a member of Kappa
Alpha Theta who was also active
in the Intersorority Council from
1980 to 1982, also feels that so
rorities were different in her day.
"I had had one relationship
with a woman, but she decided it
was all a giant mistake, and she
convinced me of that. So I decided
that the best way to get away
from her and her group of friends
was to rush," says Sharon.
"Sororities were very different
then, I think. There was no pres
sure to go to social functions with
men. ... I would go to the func
tions for women, not the formals."
She didn't come out to anyone
in her sorority; if she had, she

says, "They would have been very,
very surprised, but I doubt they
would have stopped talking to
me. . . . There wasn't as much fear
of lesbianism."
Closest friends
"Amy" also rushed a sorority,
Pi Beta Phi, after her first rela
tionship with a woman broke up.
"It was a devastating time, and I
needed something to fill the gap."
Amy hadn't defined herself as
lesbian when she rushed, and she
"didn't assume there were other
lesbians in the Greek system."
