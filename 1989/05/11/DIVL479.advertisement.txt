So, if you're student who can't wait to own a

Program.
It's a loan your parents can use to help you
acquire the Macintosh computer that best fits your

SE/30 or the Macintosh Ilex. And if you already own
a Macintosh, your parents can use the loan to equip
you with a Apple printer, hard disk, modem,
memory, or other peripherals.
Best of all, there are no appli-cation fees, no
collateral required, and no need to prove financial
hardship.*
