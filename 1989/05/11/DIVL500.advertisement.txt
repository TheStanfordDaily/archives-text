W. S. Di Piero, Associate Professor of English at
Stanford, will read poetry from his 1985
collection EARLY LIGHT and prose from his
latest work MEMORY AND ENTHUSIASM. The
poems of EARLY UGHT are finely crafted lyric
stories about the odd ways of grace and desire.
MEMORY AND ENTHUSIASM is a brilliant
collection of essays offering fresh encounters
with literary artists from both sides of the
Atlantic.
Please join us tonight at Kepler's for
an evening with W. S. Di Piero.
