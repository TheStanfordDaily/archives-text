## Noriega's men attack candidate Opposition leader Endara beaten as protests of election fraud rage 
### 
PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) — Op
position presidential candidate
Guillermo Endara was attacked and
beaten yesterday by a squad of civilian
supporters of Gen. Manuel Antonio Nor
iega, witnesses and victims said.
Officials said one of Endara's
bodyguards was killed and four soldiers
were wounded in an ensuing exchange
-of gunfire.
. Endara and his vice presidential can
didates were leading a motorcade
through the capital in a protest accusing
the government of stealing Sunday's
election when they were attacked by
civilians wearing "Dignity Battalion" T
shirts, witnesses and victims said.
Several opposition officials, including
the three candidates, were beaten and
injured, none seriously.
"They beat me in the head with an
iron bar," said Endara in a brief hospital
interview. "I saw Arias on the ground
with me."
He was referring to first vice presi
dential candidate Ricardo Arias Cal
deron.
Witnesses said some of the candi
dates' bodyguards leaped out of cars
and fired at the attackers.

The incident took place at a Defense
Forces blockade, and opposition
bodyguards shot four soldiers, said De
fense Forces spokesman Capt. Eduardo
Lim Yueng. He said a second lieutenant
was critically injured.
U.S. Ambassador Arthur Davis said
one of Endara's bodyguards was killed.
He condemned the attack and said U.S.
Embassy dependents will be moving on
to military bases today.
"By this action Noriega has demon
strated his contempt for the Panama
nian people," Davis said in a statement.
It was also the first time soldiers
suffered gunshot wounds since Noriega
took over as head of Defense Forces and
became the nation's de facto leader in
1983.
Armed civilian Noriega supporters, of
ten members of paramilitary "Dignity
Battalions," have frequently taken part
in breaking up opposition demonstra
tions.
Endara, sitting in a wheelchair, dis
played the stitches taken in the top of
his head. Behind him, supporters held
up a bloody shirt.
"I blame Noriega for everything bad
that has happened in the Republic of

Panama. I hope he leaves soon," said
Endara, who was released from Paitilla
Hospital after doctors put eight stitches
in his scalp.
Angry crowds broke windows and
burned at least six cars in the downtown
area. Police broke up scattered groups
of demonstrators with tear gas and gun
shots fired in the air.
Several people were arrested during
the melee.
The motorcade was part of an oppo
sition campaign to gain international
support and prevent an official victory
proclamation in favor of Noriega's hand
picked candidate, Carlos Duque.
Duque was ahead by a 2-1 ratio in
the secretive and slow official count of
the estimated 800,000 votes cast in Sun
day's election.
International observers, including
Europeans and U.S. congressmen as
well as former President Jimmy Carter,
called the election fraudulent and said
Endara actually won by a 3-to-l margin.
In the late afternoon, Duque visited
the Roman Catholic papal nuncio. He
told reporters he was the legitimate win
ner and that he asked the church to
talk to the opposition.
