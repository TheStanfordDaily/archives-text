# Iranian parliament speaker backs off call to kill Westerners
## 
### 
NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) — Iranian Par
liament Speaker Hashemi Rafsanjani
sought yesterday to distance himself from
an inflammatory call for Palestinians to
3ull Americans and other Westerners, say
ing his remarks were misinterpreted.
In an interview on Tehran Radio, Raf
fcaryani said he was "only analyzing" the
East situation, and did not "mean
to condone the killing of innocent
civilians."
• After the broadcast, Britain's Foreign
Dffice urged Iran last night to lift all
Heath threats unequivocally.
It said the interview, monitored in
Nicosia, "shows that the international
outrage which followed Mr. Rafsanjani's

call on May 5 to murder Westerners has
had some effect."
"But we want to hear this and all other
Iranian death threats lifted unequivocal
ly. We expect the Iranians to renounce
publicly the use or threat of terrorism
and violence in all its forms," the British
statement said.
In his prayer sermon at Tehran Uni
versity on Friday, Rafsanjani called on
Palestinians to kill Westerners, hijack
planes and bomb Western interests.
"Of course, maybe my tone was such
that it was taken to mean that I was
recommending such action. Maybe my
tone was such, but I meant it as an
interpretation," Rafsanjani said.

In Friday's sermon, Rafsanjani had
urged Palestinians to "declare open war
on American targets."
He had said: "If for every Palestinian
martyred in Palestine, they kill five
Americans, Britons or Frenchmen out
side, the Zionists would not dare continue
these wrongs."
"Why don't you hijack planes to swap
prisoners in Israeli hands, or blow up
prisoners?" advised Rafsanjani, who so
far is Iran's only presidential candidate
for summer elections.
His sermon was seen as an attempt to
distance himself from a clique that
sought to build bridges with the West
until recent weeks, when the Ayatollah

Ruhollah Khomeini moved decisively to
strengthen the hand of hard-liners.
Rafsanjani's remarks triggered strong
criticism in a West already incensed by
Khomeini's religious edict calling on Mos
lems to kill British writer Salman
Rushdie for his book, "The Satanic
Verses." Many Moslems say the book
blasphemes Islam.
The United States, France and Britain
accused Tehran of inciting murder
through Rafsanjani's sermon.
Rafsanjani told Tehran radio he found
the U.S., British and French reaction
"very interesting."
He said the West was looking for a
new issue "to make up for their defeat

in the Salman Rushdie affair." He
claimed an anti-Islamic campaign after
Khomeini's edict was foiled by the sup
port of Moslems all over the world.
Britain and its 11 European Commu
nity partners withdrew their ambas
sadors from Tehran after Khomeini's
Feb. 15 declaration. Some since have re
turned.
Rafsanjani told the radio Wednesday:
"The statements I made were my own
opinion. I presented an individual opinion
which wasn't new. Other officials may
or may not agree with my opinions."
Rafsanjani said the Israeli crackdown
on Palestinians in the occupied territories
"is the worst kind of terrorism."
