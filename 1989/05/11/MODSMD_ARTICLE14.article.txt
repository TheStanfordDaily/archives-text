I WASHINGTON (AP) - Exxon
Corp., under prodding from the
administration, announced
yesterday it plans to sharply in
crease the number of workers and
<)hips cleaning spilled oil from
fciore than 300 miles of Alaska
Jjhoreline.
5* Transportation Secretary
jftamuel Skinner called the move
•5a substantial increase" in man
power and resources by Exxon
?Bnd said it improves the likelihood
Jthat the oil company will meet its
Jcleanup goals for this summer.
; Nevertheless, said Skinner, the
•cleanup effort might still have to
•be continued in the spring of 1990.
tExxon said it is confident it can
Jclean the shoreline by September
;with the added manpower and
jships.

The tanker Exxon Valdez ran
aground in Alaska's Prince
William Sound on March 24, spill
ing nearly 11 million gallons into
the pristine waters of the sound.
Within days the oil spread down
the southern Alaska coast causing
environmental and economic
havoc.
The Coast Guard estimates that
more than 300 miles of rocky
shoreline needs to be cleaned by
hand and high-powered water
hoses. In recent weeks, cleanup
efforts have proven to be much
more difficult than Exxon had ex
pected on the soiled shoreline of
Smith Island, which was particu
larly hard hit.
In a revised cleanup plan sub
mitted to the Coast Guard, Exxon
said it will increase the number

of people to be involved in the
summer cleanup from a previ
ously planned 3,400 workers to
5,000. It also said it will bring in
seven additional barges and 17
more landing craft, bringing the
number of vessels to 70.
The additional manpower and
vessels "will allow the number of
people directly employed on the
battlefront — on the shoreline —
to increase by over 1,000 from
1,475 to 2,500," William Stevens,
president of Exxon Co. U.S.A.,
said in a statement.
Exxon executives met with
Skinner and John Sununu, Pres
ident Bush's chief of staff, at the
White House on Monday and were
told their earlier cleanup plan was
inadequate to meet the company's
announced cleanup goals.
