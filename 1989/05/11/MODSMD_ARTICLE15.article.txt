# Skysniper terrorizes Boston
## Murder suspect commandeers plane, sprays city with gunfire 
### 
BOSTON (AP) — A distraught
man who allegedly had just killed
his ex-wife commandeered a small
plane and held the city hostage
for three hours early yesterday,
firing a semiautomatic weapon
while flying within 50 feet of
motorists and buildings.
"We could do nothing but wait
and try to guess where he was
going to land," airport spokesman
Phil Orlandella said. "We could
only have made things worse by
going up and chasing him."
Traffic controllers at Logan In
ternational Airport said the pilot
buzzed them repeatedly, forcing
officials to close the airport for
an hour and reroute several late
night flights. Controllers fled the
tower twice.
"We have a very thick handbook
on the rules of air traffic control,
but there's nothing in there about
what to do if a maniac comes
shooting an AK-47 at you in the

control tower," said John Leyden,
a spokesman for the Federal Avi
ation Administration in Washing
ton.
"We didn't know if he was on
drugs, drunk or if he was
suicidal," said Orlandella of the
Massachusetts Port Authority,
which operates Logan. "We had
not one word of radio contact
throughout the whole flight."
Alfred Hunter, 42, pleaded in
nocent yesterday in Salem to one
count each of murder and grand
larceny after a midnight flight
that reportedly included a dip
beneath a harbor bridge. Essex
County District Judge John Doyle
ordered Hunter held without bail
at Bridgewater State Hospital for
20 days of psychiatric observation.
Hunter made no comments
when he was captured, police said.
Bullets struck a variety of tar
gets, including parked cars and
the Prudential tower's 50th-floor

skywalk.
One pedestrian was struck by
ejected casings from the spent
rounds.
FAA Field Manager Richard
Fontz said Hunter was not a
licensed pilot but had apparently
had some instruction from his
father.
"It obviously wasn't the first
time he flew an airplane," Fontz
said.
Hunter also repeatedly buzzed
the post office where he worked,
Fontz said. "The diving he was
doing among the buildings and
under the bridge was something."
The sniper flight began at 10:20
p.m. Tuesday and for the next
three hours ambulance services
tried to anticipate where the pilot
might land so they could prepare
for possible injuries.
Police in Boston received more
than 200 calls from people report
ing the sound of gunfire.
