## A 						classy re-Union 
### 
With some fine-tuning,
the new Tresidder will
be a real improvement

ONE SCORE AND nine
years ago, the founders of
this University committed
themselves to creating a mere
perfect Union "of the students,
by the students and for the stu
dents."
As it stands, the Union they
created — Tresidder Union —
looks more like a Howard
Johnson's than a student hang
out.
Things are changing, though.
The ongoing Tresidder renova
tion project moves in the right
direction, providing students with
a place they can rightfully call
their own.
Besides a few exceptions, the
plan works. The more than $2
million now being sunk into the
project will seem well worth it if
the Tresidder Board can modifiy
its plan and accommodate a few
more student needs.
Here's the concept the Tresid
der Board developed:
• A larger dining area with easy
access to the Grand Market
place, a hamburger/pizza court
and a patisserie/ice cream shop;
• An expanded Coffee House with
a real kitchen;
• A larger version of The Store
with a wider variety of items;
• A permanent Patio Grill stocked
with plenty of hamburgers,
chicken burgers and their original
Gorilla Sauce;
• The Camino Real Cafe, a pub
where students can "throw
peanuts on the floor;" and
• Eliminating the Corner Pocket,
but finding a spot for a dual

frozen yogurt/candy shop.
The board has focused on ex
panding ideas that work, such as
The Coffee House, The Store and
Patio Grill, while streamlining
others that have not experienced
total success.
In order for the conversion to
be a full success, though, some
concepts could use some fine
tuning or new thought.
First of zl} } night owis need a
place to gr. Currently, Tresidder
dies around midnight, tnough
much of the campus stays lit well
past then. The Tresidder Board
needs to think about what's
really missing here — a late-night
hangout. The Store and Coffee
House should open until at
least 2 a.m.
The Tresidder .ioard did, how
ever, recognize another big void
on this campus; and the idea for
a real newsstand deserves a def
inite thumbs up. But their pro
posal for a Tresidder flower shop
is not so sensible and seems like
a frivolous addition.
Also, students should have a
place to hang out separate from
the commercial enterprises, with
a television, couches and an at
mosphere conducive to conversa
tion. The upstairs lounge now
there could serve that purpose if
it were appropriately revamped.
Now it has the feel of an airport
waiting-room.
Overall, the Tresidder Board
has proposed some welcome
changes. The Board also wisely
made a point of giving students
a substantial say during the
decision-making process.
The student voice helped make
some solid suggestions for a
brand new Tresidder. And al
though Stanford lingo lovers may
be upset at losing the Co Po,
student coffee lovers can
anxiously await Mo Co Po.
With some fine-tuning,
the new Tresidder will
