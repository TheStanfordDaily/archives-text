# Banning the military and the CIA?
## CPPC recruiter policy challenged 
### Nathanael Cousins Staff writer 
As part of the Gay and Lesbian
Awareness Week activities, members of
Stanford's Gay and Lesbian Alliance
have chalked the words "We are every
where" in prominent campus locations.
But members of the gay community are
not allowed everywhere, being openly
discriminated against in some sectors
of the workforce.
Representatives for the Gay, Lesbian
and Bisexual Community Center are lob
bying Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons for a change in the non
discrimination policy of che Career Plan
ning and Placement Center, which cur
rently allows "legal" discrimination by
campus recruiters.
The current policy, now under review,
permits employers who legally discrim
inate on the basis of sexual orientation
to use CPPC facilities for student

recruitment. The Central Intelligence
Agency, armed forces and other federal
government agencies knowingly employ
on the basis of sexual orientation.
In April, following year-long debate
and investigation, CPPC Director Ruth
Schneider submitted a proposal to
Lyons which would have changed the
wording of the CPPC policy slightly,
while still allowing "lawfully" dis
criminating organizations to recruit on
campus. Schneider said the CPPC was
strongly committed to providing infor
mation to students about the various
groups recruiting on campus, but
projected, "My guess is the military will
still be coming on campus when this
whole thing is over."
Lyons said he fears that if the Uni
versity excludes government recruiters
from campus it will "put to peril" mil
lions of dollars in federal research dol
lars for the University. According to
Lyons, federal regulations introduced in

1966 would make the University in
eligible for federal funds if it restricted
on-campus military recruitment.
"Economics is a factor," said Lyons.
"Nobody likes it, but we shouldn't try
to hide it."
But members of Stanford's Lesbian,
Gay and Bisexual Community Center
point out that the Graduate School of
Business and the Law School both
prohibit even legal discrimination by re
cruiters, but the University still receives
funding.
Schneider said that the graduate
schools were exempted by a 1984
amendmenmt to the 1966 rule, and that
Stanford would lose extensive research
funding if the government were banned
from recruiting on campus. She added
that no other schools have challenged
the government.
"We are here to serve students,"
said Schneider. "Our primary role
is to help match the students up
with employers. We almost stand
on our heads to get employers in
here with the students," she
added.
Andrew Lisac, formerly on the
advisory board for the Gay and
Lesbian Alliance at Stanford, felt
that not enough student input
went into Schneider's recommen
dation. "I hope there will be more
discussion. The CPPC policy
doesn't link in with the University
non-discrimination policy like it
should," said Lisac, now assistant
director of the University summer
session.
Lisac said he talked with
Schneider about a compromise
which would have raised student
awareness of the "legal" discrim
ination at the CPPC, while still
allowing the government to
recruit on campus. However, this
compromise was not satisfactory
with the gay community, and was
not included in Schneider's report
to Lyons, according to Lisac.
Lisac, who is also a special as

sistant for the Irvine Foundation
Grant, which supports minority
employment, voiced concern that
affirmative action and the non
discrimination policy might be
confused with the new change.
"It really clouds the issue to have
affirmative action included in the
same clause," Lisac said.
But Schneider said that the part
of her proposal about affirmative
action had been changed because
affirmative action was already
covered in the non-discrimination
policy.
Hardie added that many other
companies utilize off-campus
hotels for University recruiting
and that moving government
recruiting out of the CPPC would
not significantly hamper employ
ment of Stanford students in the
government sector.
The ASSU Senate passed a bill
by a 17-2 vote in February 1988
that encouraged the University to
change its policy. The University
modified its recruitment policy in
December 1986 by adding a
"sexual orientation" clause, but
also qualified the clause with the
term "unlawful," allowing a loop
hole for legal discriminators.
"They are worried they will lose
money because of this," said Ted
Hardie, a graduate student who

is an officer in the LGBCC. "But
that is irrelevant and a toss-off.
The University has dedicated it
self to an equal process. There is
no method to make sure the Uni
versity will take this responsibil
ity, unless we have a strong non
discrimination policy."
Hardie argued that the CPPC's
exception to University policy on
non-discrimination throws open
the door for any University group
to have a narrow interpretation
of the guideline.
"Non-discrimination is the rule
that backs the Fundamental
Standard. Read broadly, it is very,
very good. Read narrowly, it is a
disaster," said Hardie.
"This issue is not limited to the
gay community," continued
Hardie. "Anyone who is concerned
about equality should be con
cerned by non-discrimination."
Lyons said that he has to con
sider how the CPPC policy fits
with the University policy on non
discrimination, the input of the
gay community and the economic
factors before he comes to a final
decision.
Lyons said he hoped to have a
decision made on the CPPC policy
by the end of the school year.
"Right now, we don't have a con
sensus for change," he said.
