# Banning the military and the CIA?
## CPPC recruiter policy challenged 
### Nathanael Cousins Staff writer 
As part of the Gay and Lesbian
Awareness Week activities, members of
Stanford's Gay and Lesbian Alliance
have chalked the words "We are every
where" in prominent campus locations.
But members of the gay community are
not allowed everywhere, being openly
discriminated against in some sectors
of the workforce.
Representatives for the Gay, Lesbian
and Bisexual Community Center are lob
bying Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons for a change in the non
discrimination policy of che Career Plan
ning and Placement Center, which cur
rently allows "legal" discrimination by
campus recruiters.
The current policy, now under review,
permits employers who legally discrim
inate on the basis of sexual orientation
to use CPPC facilities for student

recruitment. The Central Intelligence
Agency, armed forces and other federal
government agencies knowingly employ
on the basis of sexual orientation.
In April, following year-long debate
and investigation, CPPC Director Ruth
Schneider submitted a proposal to
Lyons which would have changed the
wording of the CPPC policy slightly,
while still allowing "lawfully" dis
criminating organizations to recruit on
campus. Schneider said the CPPC was
strongly committed to providing infor
mation to students about the various
groups recruiting on campus, but
projected, "My guess is the military will
still be coming on campus when this
whole thing is over."
Lyons said he fears that if the Uni
versity excludes government recruiters
from campus it will "put to peril" mil
lions of dollars in federal research dol
lars for the University. According to
Lyons, federal regulations introduced in

1966 would make the University in
eligible for federal funds if it restricted
on-campus military recruitment.
"Economics is a factor," said Lyons.
"Nobody likes it, but we shouldn't try
to hide it."
But members of Stanford's Lesbian,
Gay and Bisexual Community Center
point out that the Graduate School of
Business and the Law School both
prohibit even legal discrimination by re
cruiters, but the University still receives
funding.
Schneider said that the graduate
schools were exempted by a 1984
amendmenmt to the 1966 rule, and that
Stanford would lose extensive research
funding if the government were banned
from recruiting on campus. She added
that no other schools have challenged
the government.
