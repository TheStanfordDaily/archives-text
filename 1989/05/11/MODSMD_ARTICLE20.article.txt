THE DAILY TAKES a lot of flak
on this campus — far more than
it deserves. Liberals think that it
helps propagate the status quo, conser
vatives accuse it of liberal bias and every
one laughs at its occasional factual errors
or layout mistakes.
But comparing The Daily to The New
York Times is unfair: As a college news
paper, The Daily faces institutional ob
stacles to consistent excellence.
Recognizing these obstacles is a prere
quisite for informed critique. Here, based
on my time at The Daily — as an edit
board member, department editor and
now columnist — is my critique of The
Daily.
• Like a varsity athletic team, The
Daily loses its most senior and experi
enced people every year to graduation.
Unlike a varsity team, though, The Daily
is entirely student run, so its coaches
graduate as well as its players.
• Daily staffers can't get an extension:
The paper comes out every darpv-Often;
this pressure generates a tension between
getting enough copy to fill the paper on
the one hand pnd getting "quality" copy
on the other hand.
• This pressure to fill space also creates
a parallel pressure for shallow coverage.
The time between when a story breaks
and when the paper goes out to the
printer's is short, often too short for in
depth coverage.
• Senior editors (who are also full-time
students) are relentlessly overworked.
They are responsible for everything from
planning coverage to supervising page
layout. As a result, they have less time
to think about the stories they assign

and edit.
• The Daily is not just a newspaper;
it's a training center. The Daily has to
teach new staff as well as publish. Its
philosophy is that people learn by doing.
In practice, that means learning by
making mistakes.
• Perhaps most significantly, this
campus does not generate a paper's worth
of news every day. This paucity of real
news on campus leads staffers to spend
more time on small stories just to fill
the paper with news; this means less
time to do research on slow-moving, big
stories that a campus paper should focus
on.
Those institutional obstacles act as nat
ural breaks on The Daily's excellence.
Any fair judgment of The Daily must
take these problems into account. But
The Daily makes mistakes that are not
intrinsic to its enterprise and for which
criticism is just and deserved.
The papel-'s coverage is often less than
timely The* MeVcury News should never
scoop The Daily on campus issues, but
too often it does. Last week's story about
Stanford fundraising, for example, had
already been covered by the Mercury.
The Daily also takes its adversarial role
too seriously, resulting in bad coverage
that highlights supposed scandals, as ex
emplified by the coverage of the Robert
Bass and the American Savings "redlin
ing scandal."
The Daily gets caught in the media
trap of confusing the "new" with the
"important." Contrary to pervasive media
belief, the two concepts are not
synonymous. As a result, The Daily will
do a series of page-one stories on feral

cats (new) and never cover, say, the aging
of Stanford's faculty (important).
For all this, though, The Daily is an
outstanding college newspaper. It acts as
a purveyor of accurate information to
the Stanford community so consistently
that its failure to do so is a remarkable
event.
Despite what campus conservatives Hke
to say, The Daily's news coverage is raffely
biased. I was actively involved on the
"conservative" side of last year's Western
Culture debate, and I never felt that The
Daily's coverage of the issue was tainted
by political bias.
Like any newspaper, The Daily can be
manipulated by skillful political activists.
But that's a flaw intrinsic to a free press,
not The Stanford Daily.
Most importantly, The Daily is aware
of its problems and tries actively to com
bat them. Few other campus organiza
tions can say the same.
