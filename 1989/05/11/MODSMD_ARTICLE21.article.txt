## CPPC shouldn't invite employers who discriminate 
### 
WHILE STANFORD HAS been
engaged in deep, soul-searching
and raging debate over such
issues as the University Committee on
Minority Issues report and the Funda
mental Standard, a quiet change has
taken place that might ultimately have
a much more lasting effect on Stanford
students: The non-discrimination policy,
which is the cornerstone of students'
rights to fair treatment, has silently,
without fanfare, been gutted and left
for dead by the Career Planning and
Placement Center.
Non-discrimination is a clunky
phrase, and a concept that has a hard
time whipping up enthusiasm. Yet
non-discrimination translates into
equality, a goal central to virtually

every civil rights struggle of this or
any century.
Without a strong non-discrimination
policy, the University's commitment to
pluralism is a waste-paper sham, a
professed desire to listen without a
substantive promise of equal treatment.
The wording of Stanford's policy has
always been a little strange, as it
asserts that the University "admits
students to all programs without
regard to race, sex, national origin,
sexual orientation or religion."
Narrowly read, this might simply
mean that the University does not
discriminate in admissions, and is free
to do as it pleases thereafter.
Read more broadly, it means that all
students have equal opportunities to

take advantage of the educational
resources at Stanford.
In the past, the University has
maintained that it meant the policy
broadly, and since the Dean of Stu
dents Office has construed even student
housing to fall within the realm of
"educational resources," the actions
suited the words.
Now, all that has changed. The
CPPC has decided that its own policy
need not conform to the University's,
and has inserted in it a phrase except
ing employers which legally discrimi
nate; it thus extends its services, and a
considerable amount of the University's
resources, to employers which openly
discriminate. By so doing it invites
both employers and other University

departments to seek ways around the
non-discrimination policy; worse, it
forces the narrower reading.
Put simply, it takes away our rights.
The CPPC must conform to the
University policy for it to have any
meaning; if the University allows
exceptions, it reduces the policy to a
patchwork of half-measures and indi
vidual enforcements. Under such a
system, none of us could feel that our
rights were secure. I urge the adminis
tration to re-affirm its commitment to
equality by restoring the non
discrimination policy to its former
strength, with pride and without excep
tions.
