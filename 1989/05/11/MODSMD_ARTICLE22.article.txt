# Free speech fliers are snatched during the COP elections
## 
### 
The People's Platform, "your voice
in student government," has misrepre
sented its constituents and violated
their First Amendment rights. Last
Wednesday night (the runoff election
took place Wednesday and Thursday) I
noticed a flier in my dormitory which
quoted Council of Presidents and Stu
dent Conduct Legislative Council mem
ber Canetta Ivy, who is backed by the
People's Platform.
I found the flier enlightening; the
quotes, from the front page of The
New York Times, expressed Ivy's belief
that Stanford does not have to abide
by the First Amendment in creating a
disciplinary code. After reading the
flier, I walked down the hall.
A few minutes later several People's
Platform members, including Drew
Dixon, the top vote-getter in this

year's ASSU Senate race, came down
the hall putting up fliers for the COP
race. I spoke briefly with Dixon — she
asked if she could enter the men's
bathroom to post one of the fliers, and
I told her to go right ahead.
After the People's Platform members
left, I returned to the spot where the
Canetta Ivy flier was posted — and,
much to my dismay, the flier had van
ished.
I later discovered that more than 40
of the Canetta Ivy fliers were put up
in my dormitory. The following morn
ing, none remained. More than 300
fliers were put up in Florence Moore
Hall. The following morning, few, if
any, remained.
The issue at hand is not who printed
the fliers, as The Daily has stressed,
but rather who tore down the fliers
and why no investigation is taking
place.
The People's Platform had three
reasons for removing the fliers: They
believed them to be libelous; they
believed the Students' Choice slate
posted the fliers and was thus exceed

ing their campaign expenditures (how
they would know this is beyond me);
and/or they believed the fliers might
jeopardize their chances in the election
If the People's Platform thought the
fliers were libelous, they could have
appealed to the Stanford Federalist
Society (the group that printed the
fliers) or to the University administra
tion. If the People's Platform had
qualms concerning the origin of the
fliers, they could have appealed to the
Elections Commission. If the People's
Platform believed the fliers might
jeopardize their chances in the elec
tion. ..
The people who tore down the fliers
violated the Fundamental Standard and
the First Amendment rights of the
group responsible for the fliers. Has
the People's Platform made a habit
out of removing fliers which express
viewpoints contrary to their own?
Isn't this the same People's Platform
that refused to allow Adolfo Calero to
speak on campus because his view
points don't conform with theirs? Does
this People's Platform represent the

people?
It is distressing that the University
has failed to further investigate this
blatant violation of the Fundamental
Standard and of First Amendment
rights. If the University is attempting
to set a precedent through their inac
tion, then I am willing to follow it. I
am prepared to remove every People's
Platform flier from the face of this
campus.
But would I then be considered a
racist?
