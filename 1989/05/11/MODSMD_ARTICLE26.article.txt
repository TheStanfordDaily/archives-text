Flash! Cardinal women to seek
fourth-straight NCAA title.
The Stanford tennis team is in
Gainesville, Fla. trying to go
where no collegiate squad has
gone before. These nine young
women are attempting to win the
national championship for the
fourth year in a row.
Led by All-America sophomore
Tami Whitlinger, the 25-0 Cardi
nal will be heavily favored in the
championships. Whitlinger is the
No. 1-ranked player in the nation
and teams with her sister Teri to
form the top-rated doubles tan
dem.
Joining the Whitlingers are No.
5-ranked Sandra Birch, sixth
rated Lisa Green and superfrosh
Debbie Graham, the ninth-ranked
player in the land.
Teri Whitlinger, for her own
part, is No. 12. Freshman Kylie
Johnson rounds out the Stanford
singles lineup. She's not ranked
in the top 15, but loses very rarely,
nonetheless.
Flash! Tami in the midst of
"confidence crisis.
Tami Whitlinger suffered her
first defeat in dual-match play
about a month ago at the hands
of California's Karen Shin.
Since then, she has lost at the
hands of Graham during the
Pacific 10 Conference Champion
ships and fell to Shin again last
Friday.
"Tami's got a little confidence
crisis right now," Coach Frank
Brennan said. He believes all she
needs to snap out of it is a couple
of good wins in the opening
rounds.
It's fairly likely she'll get them.
Flash! Eleni will play.
Eleni Rossides, the oft-injured
mega-talent, will play doubles for
Stanford. The past two seasons
Rossides recovered from physical
problems just in time to help
Stanford at the NCAAs. This year
promises to be no different.
Rossides has worked out a great
deal lately and doesn't seem to
rusty. Her mobility isn't great, but
her shot-making appears solid. In
the past, she has shown the ability
to turn on her concentration when
it's counted.

Rossides will team with Green
at No. 3 doubles. That's important
for the Cardinal because . . .
Flash! Card has doubles trou
ble.
Last week's California match
left the Cardinal doubles situation
in doubt. Green has seen her
partners going through a revolv
ing door this year. It is hoped that
Rossides, Green's "normal" part
ner, will bring stability to a
season-long trouble spot at No. 3.
As far as the other two teams
go, the Cardinal's major concern
is lack of action. Since they've
clinched so many matches in
singles, Stanford's doubles teams
haven't played all that often.

Birch and Graham looked sharp
against Cal, which is good news;
the Whitlingers didn't, which is
bad news.
Overall, Brennan said, "The key
going into NCAAs is going to be
Tami. If she wins (in singles),
she's going to win singles and dou
bles."
Brennan believes that Whit
linger has a tendency to get down
on herself and it then affects her
doubles. If, as seems probable,
Tami is back on track in singles,
the duo of Tami and Teri Whit
linger could be back on track in
doubles as well.
Flash! Florida coach guaran

tees doubles sweep.
The uncertain state of Stan
ford's doubles has lead Florida
Coach Andy Brandi to make the
following prediction:
In a possible Stanford-Florida
final, if the Cardinal leads 4-2
after singles (or the match is tied
3-3), the Gators will sweep the
doubles and take the title.
Brennan seemed unimpressed
by the claim. He said everyone is
so excited about getting Stanford
into doubles because they believe
it gives them a chance to defeat
the Cardinal.
However, they have to win at
least two singles matches against
Stanford's all-star lineup which

Brennan notes is no small feat.
"With the reward of possibly
not playing doubles, you'd be sur
prised at how motivated [the Car
dinal women] get," Brennan said.
Flash! The road to the title.
Stanford opens today at 8:30
a.m. (EST) against San Diego
State, a team the Cardinal has
shut out twice. If the team wins,
they'll face the Oklahoma State-
BYU winner tomorrow at 10 a.m.
A theoretical semifinal will be
against the winner of a likely
Georgia-California showdown.
The semifinal will be played Sat
urday at 11 a.m.
The final is Sunday at 1 p.m.

If the Cardinal meets the Gators,
they'll have the difficult task of
beating Florida for the third time
this season.
Flash! More history in the
making?
In addition to going for an un
precedented team record, Stan
ford's individuals have a chance
to earn honors as well.
Tami Whitlinger, Birch, Green,
Graham and Teri Whitlinger have
all been selected for the 64-player
NCAA individual tournament that
begins Monday. Green, a junior,
has made the semifinals the past
two years.


Top-ranked Tami
Sophomore Tami Whitlinger starts the NCAA Women's Tennis Tournament today
ranked No. 1 in the nation. She has lost only one match this season.
