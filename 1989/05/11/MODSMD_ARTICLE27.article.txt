# Women golfers in for the amateur tourney of their lives
## 
### 
The best in women's amateur golf
will convene at the Stanford Golf
Course May 24-27 for the 1989
NCAA Championships.
Yesterday, the women's golf team
kicked off the championships with a press
luncheon and 18 holes with Stanford and
San Jose State players.
If anyone in the Bay Area was as yet
unaware that Stanford will be hosting so
auspicious an event, he or she won't be
for long.
The cast of characters at yesterday's
gathering represented almost every media
outlet in the region. San Jose Mercury
News columnist Dan Hruby, the
Chronicle's Pat Sullivan and the Exam
iner's Mark Soltau, among others, were
in attendance. Rick Chavez — weekend
sports anchor for KNTV-11 in San Jose
— even brought a camera crew to the
course. The top-10 Spartans will be very
competitive in the 17-team field.
After a terrific performance on their
home course last Sunday and Monday,

the Cardinal women are ensured of a
place in the tournament they will host
in two weeks.
As I negotiated my way around the
difficult Stanford course yesterday after
noon with freshman Audrey Wooding,
junior Stephanie Parel and fellow Daily
baseball writer Bruce Sarkisian, the
women reflected on the tension of the
previous week.
"A couple years ago, Ohio State hosted
the NCAA tournament and didn't get a

bid," Parel said. "I'm ecstatic. We weren't
in for sure until the last tournament.
I've been ranting for three days now."
According to Stanford Coach Tim
Baldwin, the Cardinal will be the 11th
or 12th-ranked team in the country in
the final standings. The top 17 teams in
the nation are invited to the tournament,
and Stanford had been on the bubble
prior to last weekend.
"It's the strongest women's amateur
tournament in the world. In the field of
102, 30 of them are foreign players who
are almost all national champions from
their countries," Baldwin said yesterday.
"They don't play in the U.S. amateur,
and usually about 30 seniors graduate
and turn pro and don't play in the U.S.
amateur."
The tourney will be one of the most
enjoyable experiences of the Cardinal
players' lives, but it will also be one of
the most demanding. Only time will tell
whether the home-course advantage or
the pressure of hosting the event will be

more significant.
The pomp and circumstance starts for
the golfers on Sunday, May 21. Visiting
teams will register at the Hyatt Palo
Alto, and at 6 p.m. that evening, the
Stanford women welcome them with a
barbecue.
From that night on, they won't have
a moment's rest till they hole out at No.
18 the following Saturday.
From the players, both Monday the
22nd and Tuesday the 23rd start at 8
a.m and end around 9 or 10 p.m. Each
day will be filled with all-important prac
tice rounds. Monday marks the long drive
and putting contests. Monday night the
players and coaches meet to discuss tour
nament rules. An EastAVest match will
be played among the teams at the course
on Tuesday. Tuesday night is the tour
nament banquet.
"Don't plan anything for that week,"
Parel lamented.
By the time they've caught their
breath, the players will awaken early to

tee it up in Wednesday's first round.
That's when the home-course advan
tage kicks in. Stanford's finish last Mon
day in the California Intercollegiate
proved what a help it can be. The jury
is still out, however, on how much effect
it will have in NCAAs.
"Most of the teams play in our fall
tournament (the Stanford Intercollegiate)
and know our course, so we won't have
a home-course advantage," Baldwin said.
Wooding isn't so sure. As she and part
ner Parel tamed Stanford's greens with
but a couple of three-putts yesterday, the
possible edge became readily apparent.
"We'll know the greens. They're pretty
tough here. Last week a lot of my oppo
nents were three-putting and I was get
ting down in two," Wooding said.
The other thing working in Stanford's
favor was summed up by Wooding in one
sentence.
"We don't have to travel," she said


ROBERT PORTNOY
happily.
Given all this conflicting infor
mation, what conclusions can be
drawn?
"We have the best ball-striking
team in the country. All five girls
can hit it. Other teams have two
or three and the rest fill in," Parel
said. "1 think we can (do it). Last

tournament we came so close to
shooting lights out every day."
"It will be a lot of work putting
[the tournamentl on. There will
be a lot of pressure on our players
to play well in front of all their
friends," Baldwin added.
The Cardinal has one sopho
more — Jodi Figley — and junior
Parel participating. Like Wooding,
Stephanie Davis and Adele Moore
are both freshmen. The team's
lack of experience will compound

the pressure it must face.
The Cardinal should acquit it
self quite well in the biggest tour
nament of the year.
It may not win on this anxiety
filled occasion, but one thing is
certain — Stanford's women gol
fers will assume the spotlight for
one very special week in May
when the best in the world come
to meet their challenge at the

it will have in NCAAs.
"Most of the teams play in our fall
tournament (the Stanford Intercollegiate)
and know our course, so we won't have
a home-course advantage," Baldwin said.
Wooding isn't so sure. As she and part
ner Parel tamed Stanford's greens with
but a couple of three-putts yesterday, the
possible edge became readily apparent.
"We'll know the greens. They're pretty
tough here. Last week a lot of my oppo
nents were three-putting and I was get
ting down in two," Wooding said.
The other thing working in Stanford's
favor was summed up by Wooding in one
sentence.
"We don't have to travel," she said


ROBERT PORTNOY
happily.
Given all this conflicting infor
mation, what conclusions can be
drawn?
"We have the best ball-striking
team in the country. All five girls
can hit it. Other teams have two
or three and the rest fill in," Parel
said. "1 think we can (do it). Last

tournament we came so close to
shooting lights out every day."
"It will be a lot of work putting
[the tournamentl on. There will
be a lot of pressure on our players
to play well in front of all their
friends," Baldwin added.
The Cardinal has one sopho
more — Jodi Figley — and junior
Parel participating. Like Wooding,
Stephanie Davis and Adele Moore
are both freshmen. The team's
lack of experience will compound

the pressure it must face.
The Cardinal should acquit it
self quite well in the biggest tour
nament of the year.
It may not win on this anxiety
filled occasion, but one thing is
certain — Stanford's women gol
fers will assume the spotlight for
one very special week in May
when the best in the world come
to meet their challenge at the
1989 NCAA Championships.
The best in women's amateur golf
will convene at the Stanford Golf
Course May 24-27 for the 1989
NCAA Championships.
Yesterday, the women's golf team
kicked off the championships with a press
luncheon and 18 holes with Stanford and
San Jose State players.
If anyone in the Bay Area was as yet
unaware that Stanford will be hosting so
auspicious an event, he or she won't be
for long.
The cast of characters at yesterday's
gathering represented almost every media
outlet in the region. San Jose Mercury
News columnist Dan Hruby, the
Chronicle's Pat Sullivan and the Exam
iner's Mark Soltau, among others, were
in attendance. Rick Chavez — weekend
sports anchor for KNTV-11 in San Jose
— even brought a camera crew to the
course. The top-10 Spartans will be very
competitive in the 17-team field.
After a terrific performance on their
home course last Sunday and Monday,

the Cardinal women are ensured of a
place in the tournament they will host
in two weeks.
As I negotiated my way around the
difficult Stanford course yesterday after
noon with freshman Audrey Wooding,
junior Stephanie Parel and fellow Daily
baseball writer Bruce Sarkisian, the
women reflected on the tension of the
previous week.
"A couple years ago, Ohio State hosted
the NCAA tournament and didn't get a

bid," Parel said. "I'm ecstatic. We weren't
in for sure until the last tournament.
I've been ranting for three days now."
According to Stanford Coach Tim
Baldwin, the Cardinal will be the 11th
or 12th-ranked team in the country in
the final standings. The top 17 teams in
the nation are invited to the tournament,
and Stanford had been on the bubble
prior to last weekend.
"It's the strongest women's amateur
tournament in the world. In the field of
102, 30 of them are foreign players who
are almost all national champions from
their countries," Baldwin said yesterday.
"They don't play in the U.S. amateur,
and usually about 30 seniors graduate
and turn pro and don't play in the U.S.
amateur."
The tourney will be one of the most
enjoyable experiences of the Cardinal
players' lives, but it will also be one of
the most demanding. Only time will tell
whether the home-course advantage or
the pressure of hosting the event will be

more significant.
The pomp and circumstance starts for
the golfers on Sunday, May 21. Visiting
teams will register at the Hyatt Palo
Alto, and at 6 p.m. that evening, the
Stanford women welcome them with a
barbecue.
From that night on, they won't have
a moment's rest till they hole out at No.
18 the following Saturday.
From the players, both Monday the
22nd and Tuesday the 23rd start at 8
a.m and end around 9 or 10 p.m. Each
day will be filled with all-important prac
tice rounds. Monday marks the long drive
and putting contests. Monday night the
players and coaches meet to discuss tour
nament rules. An EastAVest match will
be played among the teams at the course
on Tuesday. Tuesday night is the tour
nament banquet.
"Don't plan anything for that week,"
Parel lamented.
By the time they've caught their
breath, the players will awaken early to

tee it up in Wednesday's first round.
That's when the home-course advan
tage kicks in. Stanford's finish last Mon
day in the California Intercollegiate
proved what a help it can be. The jury
is still out, however, on how much effect
it will have in NCAAs.
