# Cardinal nine trips up Tigers, resurfaces finally to .500 mark
## 
### Bruce Sarkisian Senior staff writer 
The Stanford pitching staff,
which has been thin all year due
to injury, got a big lift for the
final weekend of the regular
season as freshman lefthander
Steve Worrell pitched a complete
game in a 9-4 win over Pacific in
Stockton.

Baseball
Cardinal 9, Tigers 4

The win improved the Cardinal
to 28-28, the first time Stanford
has seen the .500 threshold since
Feb. 28, when it was 10-10. UOP,
which has now lost 11 of its last
12 games, fell to 15-38.
Here's the reason why Worrell's
outing was so big: Stanford will
play Pepperdine this weekend and
will need to have its primary
starters and relievers in top form
to beat the Waves.
Pepperdine just clinched the
West Coast Athletic Conference
title with three wins over Loyola
Marymount. The Waves are 40-
14-1 overall and only rarely do
they lose at home.
Ideally, in order to be in ready
for the weekend, Stanford Coach

Mark Marquess' top guns: Stan
Spencer, Steve Chitren, Brian
Keyser and Scott Weiss could not
have come out of the bullpen yes
terday. Spencer pitched six in
nings against Santa Clara Tues
day while Weiss pitched two.
Chitren is coming off an injury
and must be handled delicately,
while Keyser's arm may still have
been a little worn out from his
yeoman's work of eight innings
against California Saturday.
By the weekend, all four of
those pitchers will have had
enough rest to be fresh, and that
gives Marquess much more
flexibility coming out of the bull
pen. If any of those pitchers had
come out of the pen yesterday,
their availability for the weekend
would have been in jeopardy.
On the other hand, Marquess
can not afford to lose even one
more game if he wants his squad
to be considered for postseason
play. Thus, if Worrell had gotten
in trouble, the skipper would have
had to bring his best out of the
bullpen.
Worrell (3-3) gave up 10 hits
and two walks while striking out
five batters on the afternoon.
Paul Carey helped Worrell's cause
by hitting two over the boards,
his 15th and 16th home runs of
the season. Carey is now one home
run short of tying Ed Sprague for

second place on Stanford's all
time homer list.
"P.C.'s" two-run shot in the top
of the first set the tone for Stan
ford. The Cardinal added two
more runs in the top of the third
on an RBI single by Troy Paulsen
and a run-scoring groundout by
David McCarty.
The Tigers battled back to make
the score 4-3 in favor of the Car
dinal until Stanford broke it open
with a four-run fifth inning.
Paul Carey led off with his sec
ond homer of the game, a solo
shot. Paulsen, batting in his
newly-traditional cleanup spot
singled and David Holbrook was
hit by a pitch.
Next, the Cardinal got two gifts
in the form of miscues by the
Tigers. The runners advanced to
second and third on a wild pitch
by D.J. Heller, the Tiger starter.
Then Roger Burnett reached base
on an error by shortstop Dan Den
cezek which also allowed Paulsen
to score with two out.
Yesterday's victory was the
streaking Cardinal's seventh in
eight games. After starting the
season poorly, Stanford has come
back in the last month, winning
three of its last four Pacific 10
Southern Division series over
USC, Arizona and Cal. "We've
played well the last three or four
weeks really," Marquess said.
