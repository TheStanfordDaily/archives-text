# All-American Purpur throws weight around
## 
### Ed Pike Staff writer 
Most people would be satisfied
to be second best in the country
in their chosen sport — but not
Stanford's Patty Purpur.
Purpur, who is ranked No. 2
nationally in both the shot put
and the discus, began a competi
tive weightlifting program this
year to help her throwing and
finished second in her weight
class at the National Women's
Weightlifting Championships.
Purpur, enjoying her last
season at Stanford, improved her
national ranking by throwing 53-
foot-3 at the Stanford Classic
April 15th.
Despite this success, Purpur
has still not realized how far her
talent could take her. "I tend to
doubt myself," Purpur said, but
"lifting has really helped my con
fidence".
Her lingering doubts are sur
prising until one considers the
transition she had to make at
Stanford three years ago — from
the best in the United States in

both the shot put and discus and
a local hero in her home state of
North Dakota to just one of a
crowd of talented freshman.
"It was kind of hard," Purpur
said, "when I came out here and
that recognition was not there"
— a predicament many Stanford
freshmen face.
Purpur also had to live up to
a tradition that includes throwers
like two-time Olympian Carol
Cady, and over the years it has
been a heavy burden. She started
off with a strong freshman
season, when she broke the 50
foot mark and threw 51-foot-8 Vi
to gain All-America honors at the
NCAA Indoor Championship
Meet. In the spring, she was
eighth in the NCAA Champion
ships in the discus with a throw
of 168-foot-11.
She was consistently among the
best in the nation, but was unable
to make the breakthrough that
would land her a top-three finish
at the NCAA meet. It was difficult
not to try too hard and lose con
fidence.
"No matter what you've got you

want more," she said. "If you
don't, there is no point in train
* _ 99
ing.
The big turnaround this year
has been marked by one word —
confidence. A successful weight
training program, her upcoming
marriage to former Stanford pole
vaulter John Gash, and a more
stable coaching situation have all
given her the confidence to try
new throwing techniques and
even new sports.
Weightlifting has also given her
a chance to offset a natural size
disadvantage while avoiding the
lure of steroids. As a 155-pound
freshman, she was the smallest
thrower on the team and at 165
today is sometimes frustrated in
going up against much bigger
competitors (read: Pacific 10
Conference and NCAA leader
Carla Garett of Arizona).
"If I didn't have other things
going well for me, steroids would
be a real temptation," Purpur
said. "I would never take steroids
because that's the way I feel."
The NCAA drug-testing pro
gram, which was successfully

challenged by two Stanford
athletes in the California Su
preme Court last fall, does not
seem to be effective in any case.
After four years of track and field
competition, Purpur claimed, "I
have never been drug tested in
track. I've been tested twice for
weightlifting."
Working her way up naturally
has also had benefits that are
more psychological than physical.
Purpur says,"I figure, if I can
put 255 pounds over my head,
why can't I put this little nine
pound shot further?" Her new
goals are 55 feet in the shot put
and 190 feet in the discus.
Achieving her goal of throwing
over 55 feet will also require flaw
less technique under the guidance
of throwing coach John Powell.
Half the relationship is refining
an improved throwing style, while
the other half seems to come down
to refining a sense of humor. "I
used to take him too seriously,"
she claims.
You can be sure, however, that
the competition will be taking
Patty Purpur seriously.
