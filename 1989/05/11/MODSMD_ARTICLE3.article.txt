# Kennedy recommends investigation of two alleged Standard violations

### Jonathan Eisenberg Staff writer 
Seeking to show how the unmodified
Fundamental Standard can be applied,
University President Donald Kennedy
has taken a personal stake in the debate
over free speech by urging investigation
of two alleged Standard violations.
Kennedy's unprecedented move was
in response to Philosophy Prof. John
Perry's claims in last Thursday's Fac
ulty Senate meeting that certain har
assment goes unpunished by the current
enforcement of the conduct code.
Perry, a resident fellow in Soto House,
cited two separate examples of racist
behavior on campus as evidence. He
recalled that a female student and a
faculty member were called "nigger"
and other epithets in two different ex
changes with students.

But Perry explained, in frustration,
that he advised the victims not to seek
disciplinary proceedings against the of
fenders because it would be futile.
Prosecution is "simply not what hap
pens at this University," said Perry.
However, in an interview yesterday,
Kennedy challenged Perry's claims. If
complaints are filed with the Judicial
Affairs Office, "there is no question over
whether they would be prosecuted," he
said.
On Monday, in an unusual action,
Kennedy sent a message to Judicial Af
fairs Officer Sally Cole encouraging her
to begin investigating the incidents.
But Cole was one step ahead of Ken
nedy, and had already started to look
into the incidents before she got his
message, she said yesterday. However,
she explained that she cannot prosecute
unless the victims file an official com

plaint.
These events arose in light of the
Student Conduct Legislative Council's
second proposed interpretation of the
Standard, which was presented for
debate at the senate meeting last week.
The senate had planned to vote on it
at today's meeting, but may not at Ken
nedy's request.
An incident in Ujamaa House last fall,
in which two freshmen students drew
a caricature depicting Beethoven as a
black man and posted it on the door of
a black student, prompted the SCLC to
make the provisions of the 94-year-old
Standard clearer for cases of harass
ment.
However, Kennedy said he believes
that the name-calling incidents cited by
Perry are prosecutable under the cur-
