# Kennedy recommends investigation of two alleged Standard violations
## 
### Jonathan Eisenberg Staff writer 
Seeking to show how the unmodified
Fundamental Standard can be applied,
University President Donald Kennedy
has taken a personal stake in the debate
over free speech by urging investigation
of two alleged Standard violations.
Kennedy's unprecedented move was
in response to Philosophy Prof. John
Perry's claims in last Thursday's Fac
ulty Senate meeting that certain har
assment goes unpunished by the current
enforcement of the conduct code.
Perry, a resident fellow in Soto House,
cited two separate examples of racist
behavior on campus as evidence. He
recalled that a female student and a
faculty member were called "nigger"
and other epithets in two different ex
changes with students.

But Perry explained, in frustration,
that he advised the victims not to seek
disciplinary proceedings against the of
fenders because it would be futile.
Prosecution is "simply not what hap
pens at this University," said Perry.
However, in an interview yesterday,
Kennedy challenged Perry's claims. If
complaints are filed with the Judicial
Affairs Office, "there is no question over
whether they would be prosecuted," he
said.
On Monday, in an unusual action,
Kennedy sent a message to Judicial Af
fairs Officer Sally Cole encouraging her
to begin investigating the incidents.
But Cole was one step ahead of Ken
nedy, and had already started to look
into the incidents before she got his
message, she said yesterday. However,
she explained that she cannot prosecute
unless the victims file an official com

plaint.
These events arose in light of the
Student Conduct Legislative Council's
second proposed interpretation of the
Standard, which was presented for
debate at the senate meeting last week.
The senate had planned to vote on it
at today's meeting, but may not at Ken
nedy's request.
An incident in Ujamaa House last fall,
in which two freshmen students drew
a caricature depicting Beethoven as a
black man and posted it on the door of
a black student, prompted the SCLC to
make the provisions of the 94-year-old
Standard clearer for cases of harass
ment.
However, Kennedy said he believes
that the name-calling incidents cited by
Perry are prosecutable under the cur-
rent Standard interpretation,
without further modification. He
has taken a stand on this issue
in an attempt to "clarify" the
reach of the conduct code.
"I was deeply worried about the
confusion I saw developing in dis
cussion of the issue," he said yes
terday.
Cole agreed that Kennedy used
"common sense" and correctly un
derstood the current interpreta
tion of the Standard.
"Perry's advice [telling the vic
tims not to file a complaint] was
erroneous," she said, explaining
that the image of the Judicial Af
fairs Office as inactive is partly
due to the lack of filed complaints
upon which action can be taken.

Further, Cole speculated that
the new SCLC proposal will not
dictate more action on the part
of the Judicial Affairs Office in
harassment cases.
Kennedy reiterated, "We should
use what we have [in the current
version of the Standard] and use
it actively. ... We are equipped to
deal with the cases described."
Law Prof. Thomas Grey, one of
the drafters of the SCLC proposal,
said that prosecuting a harass
ment case "mainly involves fact
finding, listening to what the
students say, and [deciding
whether to] believe them" rather
than following the letter of a con
duct code interpretation.
Vice President and General
Counsel John Schwartz has said
the proposal fails to clarify the
meaning of the Standard, espe
cially regarding difficult cases

such as that at Ujamaa. "(The
interpretation) doesn't make it be
cause of its own ambiguities."
Grey defended the SCLC pro
posal, saying "There is no human
language that does not have am
biguities. ... I don't think (the
proposal) is unreasonably ambig
uous."
However, he admitted that a
case like the Ujamaa one would
fall "on the borderline on almost
every issue" when evaluated un
der the proposed interpretation.
Cole said if the current proposal
passes, it will help her because
"all policy statements are educa
tional" and she will refer to it for
more specific guidelines
Wary of a hasty decision, Ken
nedy asked the senate last week
to postpone voting on the proposal
to "afford the community more
time" to study it.

to begin investigating the incidents.
But Cole was one step ahead of Ken
nedy, and had already started to look
into the incidents before she got his
message, she said yesterday. However,
she explained that she cannot prosecute
unless the victims file an official com

plaint.
These events arose in light of the
Student Conduct Legislative Council's
second proposed interpretation of the
Standard, which was presented for
debate at the senate meeting last week.
The senate had planned to vote on it
at today's meeting, but may not at Ken
nedy's request.
An incident in Ujamaa House last fall,
in which two freshmen students drew
a caricature depicting Beethoven as a
black man and posted it on the door of
a black student, prompted the SCLC to
make the provisions of the 94-year-old
Standard clearer for cases of harass
ment.
However, Kennedy said he believes
that the name-calling incidents cited by
Perry are prosecutable under the cur-
rent Standard interpretation,
without further modification. He
has taken a stand on this issue
in an attempt to "clarify" the
reach of the conduct code.
"I was deeply worried about the
confusion I saw developing in dis
cussion of the issue," he said yes
terday.
Cole agreed that Kennedy used
"common sense" and correctly un
derstood the current interpreta
tion of the Standard.
"Perry's advice [telling the vic
tims not to file a complaint] was
erroneous," she said, explaining
that the image of the Judicial Af
fairs Office as inactive is partly
due to the lack of filed complaints
upon which action can be taken.

Further, Cole speculated that
the new SCLC proposal will not
dictate more action on the part
of the Judicial Affairs Office in
harassment cases.
Kennedy reiterated, "We should
use what we have [in the current
version of the Standard] and use
it actively. ... We are equipped to
deal with the cases described."
Law Prof. Thomas Grey, one of
the drafters of the SCLC proposal,
said that prosecuting a harass
ment case "mainly involves fact
finding, listening to what the
students say, and [deciding
whether to] believe them" rather
than following the letter of a con
duct code interpretation.
Vice President and General
Counsel John Schwartz has said
the proposal fails to clarify the
meaning of the Standard, espe
cially regarding difficult cases

such as that at Ujamaa. "(The
interpretation) doesn't make it be
cause of its own ambiguities."
Grey defended the SCLC pro
posal, saying "There is no human
language that does not have am
biguities. ... I don't think (the
proposal) is unreasonably ambig
uous."
However, he admitted that a
case like the Ujamaa one would
fall "on the borderline on almost
every issue" when evaluated un
der the proposed interpretation.
Cole said if the current proposal
passes, it will help her because
"all policy statements are educa
tional" and she will refer to it for
more specific guidelines
Wary of a hasty decision, Ken
nedy asked the senate last week
to postpone voting on the proposal
to "afford the community more
time" to study it.
