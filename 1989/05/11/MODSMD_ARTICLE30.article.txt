# No. 3 women's crew begins Pac-10s

The men's and women's crew
seasons enter crunch time this
weekend when they will row for
the Pacific 10 Conference title
at the Pacific Coast Rowing
Championships (PCRC) in
Rancho Cordova, Calif.
While both the men and
women have a shot at winning
the competition, the women en
ter the championships as one of
the favorites.
They are ranked No. 2 in the
conference behind Washington,
who last weekend moved past
the Cardinal into the top spot
by virtue of a victory over Cal
ifornia. Although Stanford also
defeated California, Washington
achieved a greater margin of vic
tory and thus claimed first.
Coach John Davis is optimis
tic about the women's chances
this weekend. "I think we can
win it. If we row a very good
race we'll be awfully tough to

beat," he said.
Stanford, which is unofficially
ranked No. 3 in the nation be
hind Radcliffe and Washington,
figures to contend for the title
with the Huskies, California,
who will be seeking to avenge
their April 29 loss to the Car
dinal, and UCLA, according to
Davis.
Preparation for the PCRC has
been slowed by an injury to
sophomore Kim Walsh, who
rows in the boat's No. 7 posi
tion. This injury temporarily
threw the team for a loop, as
they could not practice together
as a boat for several days while
Walsh was out of action.
Sophomore Ellen Austin said
that although the boat's prog
ress has been frustratingly slow
lately, she feels the team will
be able to put these problems
behind them this weekend.
"We perform well under pres
sure but it will be tough. We'll
have to earn everything we get
this weekend," Austin said.

Walsh added that the key to vic
tory for Stanford will be rowing
a strong sprint over the last 250
meters of the race.
Although they rowed a
mediocre race against California
in their last competition, Davis
said that the boat should be
well-rested and "screaming"
fast.
The men's team, oddly
enough, considering the time of
the season, is currently under
going an adjusting period and
will feature a new look this
weekend.
The boat's lineup has been
reshuffled since the California
race, with only two people re
taining their original positions
in the lineup, according to
junior Scott Evans, who as the
coxswain is one of the original
two.
The racing opens Saturday at
Lake Natoma, which is near
Sacramento, with a six-team
heat for the women and a four
team heat for the men.
