INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) -
James Worthy scored 30 points,
and A.C. Green had 14 in the
third quarter when the Los An
geles Lakers took command on
their way to a 130-108 playoff vic
tory over the Seattle SuperSonics
Wednesday night.
The two-time defending NBA
champion Lakers now have a 2-0
lead in the best-of-7 Western Con
ference semifinal against the Su
perSonics.
The second-round series shifts
to Seattle for games Friday night
and Sunday afternoon.

The Lakers never trailed after
scoring the first five points of the
game.
The Sonics seemed to be
making a serious run at the lead
midway through the third quar
ter, when they trailed only 77-68.
But Los Angeles then went on
an 18-4 run to finish the quarter
and had a safe 95-72 advantage
heading into the final period.

night.
Ricky Pierce, who came off the
bench to lead the Bucks with 25
points, missed two free throws
with 42 seconds remaining.
Laimbeer, who scored Detroit's
final six points, sank four free
throws the rest of the way for
the final margin, giving Detroit
1-0 lead in the best-of-7 series
that resumes at The Palace Fri
