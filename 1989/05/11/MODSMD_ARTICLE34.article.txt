## THE 						STANFORD DAILY'S ENTERTAINING WEEKLY Hot Stuff 
### 
In our last episode, Pepsi-Cola had pulled its ad featuring
Madonna from the airwaves after negative backlash from
its similanty to her video. The video, you will recall, con
tained several violent/saxual/religious themes which were
offensive to prudes nationwide.
Now, after Pepsi pulled out of sponsonng Madonna's
tour, a grassroots coalition has pulled together to protest
this move. "Fundamentalists Anonymous, based out of New
York City, is fighting Fundamentalist censorship every
where. Their slogan. "No Madonna, No Pepsil 1
. . ."Since Pepsi is now- 'the Choice of ihe Fundamentalist
Generation,'" says FA co-founder Richard Yao, "people who
aren't Fundamentalists will stop dnnking Pepsi."
Yao emphasizes that "If we don't take a stand now, the
next victim of the Jimmy Swaggart crowd could be George
Michael, Michael Jackson, Barbra Streisand [that temptress,
pictured above] or even Frank Sinatra!"
As a first step, FA is sponsonng an amateur TV evangelist
impersonation contest. The winner, to be selected by the
national staff of FA, will be awarded $1000.
The contest is open to anyone who is not an employee
of FA. Contestants must send in a glossy black & white
or color entry of themselves imitating a Fundamentalist
enjoying Pepsi. Send em to FA Contest, P.O. Box 20324,
Greeley Square Station, New York, NY. 10001. Deadline
is June 15, 1989. We are not makino this up, although we
probably should be.

Dance Studio.
The concert features choreography by undergraduate
and graduate students, faculty of the Stanford Dance Di
vision and by guest choreographer Karl Schaffer.
Schaffer, whose work has been seen around the Bay
Area, has created a work in which the dancers accompany
themselves to rhythm and voice.
Tickets are $5 for normal folks, $3 for students and
seniors, and will be available at the door.
