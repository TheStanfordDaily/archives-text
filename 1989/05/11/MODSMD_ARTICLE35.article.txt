# Tinkling ivories to the top
## Marcus Roberts is a hit both solo and with Wynton Marsalis 
### Mia Manzulli Senior staff writer 
To listen to Marcus Roberts is
to hear jazz come alive — the
music is a part of him, and he a
part of its sound and history. This
gifted 25-year-old pianist, a mem
ber of trumpeter Wynton Marsalis'
jazz sestet, has an abundance of
natural talent and vitality as well
as a respect for the jazz tradition.
"I want to be thought of as a
complete pianist," Roberts says.
"The piano is a very noble, sophis
ticated instrument that many great
people have played. I want to pay
homage to those musicians by
being thorough and respectful of
the jazz tradition."
Roberts, a native of Jacksonville,
Fla. who has been blind since age
4, got his first taste of music from
the gospel sound at his mother's
church where he would often sneak
in to play the organ. Roberts' love
of music developed at an early age
and he taught himself to play the
piano. He began formal classical
studies at age 12.
Although Roberts was agile at
picking out melodies by ear, his
instructor insisted he read music.
Braille music is considerably more
complex than print sheet music.
"My teacher wanted me to have
access to the actual score, as the
composer had it in mind," he says.
But Roberts didn't need to read
music for his true love, jazz, "be
cause it isn't set up that way. You
should be able to read it, but you
don't need to."
For Roberts, the transition from
classical piano to jazz was a nat
ural one. "I always wanted to play
jazz. It always felt closest to my

personal identity." His early expo
sure to gospel music provided an
easy transition. "To me, gospel is
very soulful. To this day it has
had a profound effect on my style.
Jazz and gospel are related to each
other on a fundamental level."
Roberts claims more influences
on his music than just his gospel
upbringing. Louis Armstrong,
Duke Ellington, Thelomous Monk,
Dizzy Gillespie and Miles Davis
(to name just a few from Roberts'
"whole gigantic list!") are counted
among his heroes and influences.
Roberts loves their music and
wants to do his best to uphold
their inspiring tradition.
"I firmly believe that originality
can only exist if there is a strong
link to, and respect for, tradition."
Roberts' love for this tradition
paved the way for his career in
music. He said that if he couldn't
play the piano, he really doesn't
know what else he would do.
Aspiring to be a iazz pianist,
Roberts won several local Florida
competitions. By 1982 he had re
solved to someday play with Wyn
ton Marsalis.
"The first time I heard Wynton,
I was touring Europe with a little
high-school band," Roberts recalls.
"I didn't know who he was at the
time — he was working with the
Herbie Hancock Quartet — but
nobody had ever affected me the
way he did."
Roberts entered a competition at
a jazz-educator's convention in
Chicago in hopes of winning, and
end up performing with, his idol
Marsalis. Roberts won, but did not
get his chance with Marsalis. In
stead, he met the trumpeter's
father who eventually hooked

Roberts up with his son
In 1985, Marsalis invited
Marcus Roberts to replace depart
ing member Kenny Kirkland. For
Roberts, it was a dream come true.
And for Marsalis, it was better
than he had ever anticipated —
Roberts had learned, the group's
entire repertoire before even
joining them.
Roberts' respect and love for
Wynton Marsalis is obvious when
he speaks of his mentor. Although
Roberts recently released his own

album — "The Truth Is Spoken
Here," his inagural recording as a
leader — he has no plans to ven
ture from Marsalis' sestet.
"I still have many projects
planned with Wynton, and so
much to learn. I am very much a
part of the sestet," said Roberts.
"It's hard work being the leader,
on your own. I now have a new
level of respect for Wynton. On
your own, you have to set every
thing up, choose your musicians.
With Wynton, I'm spoiled -- we
already have great musicians in
the band."
Marcus Roberts has learned
well, for "The Truth Is Spoken
Here" reveals his amazing eclec
ticism both as a pianist and a com
poser, as well as his passion for
jazz. The collection includes five
original compositions as well as

ipation in Wynton Marsalis' core
of musucians, Marcus Roberts
seems to have a promising future
in store for himself. He is planning
another recording — more blues
this time.
"Ultimately, I want to be known

pianist," concluded Roberts. "I
want to be somebody who tried to
make things easier for everyone
else I knew and made people feel
good about themselves."

(to name just a few from Roberts'
"whole gigantic list!") are counted
among his heroes and influences.
Roberts loves their music and
wants to do his best to uphold
their inspiring tradition.
"I firmly believe that originality
can only exist if there is a strong
link to, and respect for, tradition."
Roberts' love for this tradition
paved the way for his career in
music. He said that if he couldn't
play the piano, he really doesn't
know what else he would do.
Aspiring to be a iazz pianist,
Roberts won several local Florida
competitions. By 1982 he had re
solved to someday play with Wyn
ton Marsalis.
"The first time I heard Wynton,
I was touring Europe with a little
high-school band," Roberts recalls.
"I didn't know who he was at the
time — he was working with the
Herbie Hancock Quartet — but
nobody had ever affected me the
way he did."
Roberts entered a competition at
a jazz-educator's convention in
Chicago in hopes of winning, and
end up performing with, his idol
Marsalis. Roberts won, but did not
get his chance with Marsalis. In
stead, he met the trumpeter's
father who eventually hooked

Roberts up with his son
In 1985, Marsalis invited
Marcus Roberts to replace depart
ing member Kenny Kirkland. For
Roberts, it was a dream come true.
And for Marsalis, it was better
than he had ever anticipated —
Roberts had learned, the group's
entire repertoire before even
joining them.
Roberts' respect and love for
Wynton Marsalis is obvious when
he speaks of his mentor. Although
Roberts recently released his own

"I still have many projects
planned with Wynton, and so
much to learn. I am very much a
part of the sestet," said Roberts.
"It's hard work being the leader,
on your own. I now have a new
level of respect for Wynton. On

Marcus Roberts (with sunglasses) is part of Wynton Marsalis* ensemble.
To listen to Marcus Roberts is
to hear jazz come alive — the
music is a part of him, and he a
part of its sound and history. This
gifted 25-year-old pianist, a mem
ber of trumpeter Wynton Marsalis'
jazz sestet, has an abundance of
natural talent and vitality as well
as a respect for the jazz tradition.
"I want to be thought of as a
complete pianist," Roberts says.
"The piano is a very noble, sophis
ticated instrument that many great
people have played. I want to pay
homage to those musicians by
being thorough and respectful of
the jazz tradition."
Roberts, a native of Jacksonville,
Fla. who has been blind since age
4, got his first taste of music from
the gospel sound at his mother's
church where he would often sneak
in to play the organ. Roberts' love
of music developed at an early age
and he taught himself to play the
piano. He began formal classical
studies at age 12.
Although Roberts was agile at
picking out melodies by ear, his
instructor insisted he read music.
Braille music is considerably more
complex than print sheet music.
"My teacher wanted me to have
access to the actual score, as the
composer had it in mind," he says.
But Roberts didn't need to read
music for his true love, jazz, "be
cause it isn't set up that way. You
should be able to read it, but you
don't need to."
For Roberts, the transition from
classical piano to jazz was a nat
ural one. "I always wanted to play
jazz. It always felt closest to my

personal identity." His early expo
sure to gospel music provided an
easy transition. "To me, gospel is
very soulful. To this day it has
had a profound effect on my style.
Jazz and gospel are related to each
other on a fundamental level."
Roberts claims more influences
on his music than just his gospel
upbringing. Louis Armstrong,
Duke Ellington, Thelomous Monk,
Dizzy Gillespie and Miles Davis
(to name just a few from Roberts'
"whole gigantic list!") are counted
among his heroes and influences.
Roberts loves their music and
