# Have tongue will travel: a lay person's guide to the history of English
## 
### 
Rcccntly there has been great interest
in the history of the English language
among scholars and lay people. For in
stance, historically speaking, nobody ever
used to use the phrase "lay people," except
for one of my ex-girlfriends who used it
as a job description
For many decades people assumed that
English had simply always existed. As an
example, in the fine documentary film
"The Ten Commandments," starring
Charleton Heston and co-starring God,
Heston (played by Moses) came down
from Mount Sinus carrying The Ten Com
mandments, which are WRI TTEN IN
ENGLISH. This, of course, is in direct
contrast to our current knowledge of the
biblical era, during which time the Is
raelites spoke a language which has never
been translated by modern linguists. An
excerpt is printed below:
Thou allshay otnay nvetcay thy eigh
borsnay ifeway
Nowadays we recognize that English
took hundreds of years to develop, chang
ing from a rather simple, unexprcssive
tongue into the dynamic, full-figured lan
guage that we can now use to express
such subtle concepts as: "Might as well
jump. Jump! Go ahead and jump! Jump!
lump! (guitar solo) Jump!"

The Story of English
To understand the history of English
we must go back more than 1,500 years
to England, which, coincidentally, is where
English originated. Back then the British
Isles were inhabited by a variety of differ
ent clans: the Scots, the Irish, the Welsh,
the Troj-enz and the Corndogs, to name
a few. Collectively, these Celtic tribes
spoke many different languages, most of
which arc now cxtinct except for Gaelic,
which is spoken in parts of Wales and by
Larry Bird
In the fifth century A.D., England was
invaded by the Angles and the Saxophones.
They came from the shores of what is
now modern-day Germany, although at
that point in history the Germans had
developed language only to the point of
being able to order beer.
The "Angled-Saxons," as they were later
to be called, introduced much of English's
current vocabulary to the Celtic tribes.
Often these introductions would be made
informally, in much the same manner as
modern Tupperware parties. ("Oh, Lady
Gwynicvere, forsooth check out that new
word for 'swine' — it's to DIE for, giggle,
:higgle")
During this period of intense language

change many new vocabulary items were
borrowed from Latin, Greek and Hebrew.
From Latin came words associated with
the church, including "monk," "bishop,"
"shrine" and "tclevangclist"; from the
Greeks, English borrowed words such as
"Buuuuurp!"; and from Hebrew we bor
rowed such words as "shalomatzoh,"
which literally translated means: "He who
eats Oscar Mayer weiners on the Sabbath."
In 793 A.D., England was invaded again,
this time by the Vikings, who sailed from
Minnesota. The Vikings spoke Norse, a
language of which we have no surviving
wnttcn records, except for the following
poem:
A Norse is a Norse
Of course, of course
The Vikings came to England to pillage
and plunder, and, in fact, had easily sacked
half the country before an offsides penalty
was called. Soon thereafter the Vikings
began to impose their Norse words on
English. For instance, any word in English
beginning with "sk-" was originally used
in Old Norse — words such as "skein,"
"skin," "skyhook" and "skateboard."
This was the final step in the develop
ment of what is now known as "Old Eng
lish." Texts from that period are not
intelligible to readers of modern English,

a fact which can be illustrated by the
following lines from the Old English epic
poem "Beowulf":
Heah heah hweorr thee Monkeys
and neoupel saye hwe monkye aronde
But nweorr to abuisy syringing
to poot eniboddy doun
The next major element in the devel
opment of English was the Norman in
vasion in 1066 A D. Surprisingly, the
Normans were warmly welcomed in Eng
land, and according to one set of records

were greeted upon entering with a collec
tive cry of "NORM!"
The Normans, of course, spoke French,
which is why modern English contains so
many French terms such as "mezzanine,"
"laissez-faire" and "Jacques Cousteau "
This new form of the language was known
as Middle English, which is best ex
emplified by the following well-known
prologue to "The Canterbury Tales," a
sweeping epic wntten by Leroy Chaucer:
Whan that Aprill with his shoures soote
Your taxxes due so sendeth the loote
This Middle English lasted until about
1500, after which we consider all English
to be modern English. Shakespeare, for
instance, WTOtc early in the period of
modern English, and while his vocabulary
is virtually identical to that which we use
today, his syntax was still based on the
archaic Middle English grammar:
[ulict: Oh Romeo, oh Romeo, wherefor
art thou, Romeo!
Romeo: Ooooh! Beautiful you are
Defeat Darth Vader you must.
All of these influences — the Celts, the
Anglo-Saxons, the Norse, the Normans
and the Beverly Hillbillies — worked to
gether to subtly shape English into the
dvnamic language it is today.
