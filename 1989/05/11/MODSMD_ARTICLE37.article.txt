# Animation arrives again

You see enough of these anima
tion festivals and your attention
span gets totally shot. Used to be
I could sit through two-hour lec
tures, no sweat. But after having
seen four different animation col
lections in the past year, I can't
make it more than five, 10 minutes
without expecting to see a profes
sor's head explode, or at least have
some alien lizard come slithering
out his nose.
The latest in Palo Alto's
seemingly never-ending parade of
these animated shorts is the "Fes
tival of Animation," a collection
of 20 new and old animated pieces
from all over the world. This year's
festival sold out in San Francisco
the past few weeks, largely on the
strength of "Tin Toy," a computer
animated piece made by San
Rafael's Pixar group (formerly of
Lucasfilm).
Despite its Oscar for best
animated short film, however,
"Tin Toy" isn't even the best
computer-animated piece in the
festival; that award goes to
"Particle Dreams," a simple, yet
amazing montage of particles
forming shapes in space, and just
one of several computer-animated
shorts in the festival.
Besides the newfangled com
puter pieces, several old traditional
favorites are back for this year's
festival including "The Cat Came
Back," a 100-year-old, tuba
accompanied tune about a kitty
that wreaks havoc on a innocent
man's home; and "Snookles," the

story of a beautiful singing duet
between a baby dragon and a baby
bird.
The new stuff is pretty good,
too, especially Academy Award
winner Bill Plympton's latest,
"How to Kiss," which graphically
illustrates kisses ranging from the
nibble kiss (chomp!) to the the
moist kiss (splash!).
The one useful social lesson, if
any, that this "Festival of Anima
tion" offers is that glasnost has
not quite reached the cartoon
makers of Eastern Europe. "The
Door" in particular, a 10-minute
yawner from the USSR, indicates
that the Soviets' sense of humor
isn't exactly parallel to ours here
in the States.
Unlike previous years' collec
tions, this festival is dedicated al
most solely to humor, a wise move
considering that the serious pieces
in previous festivals almost inevi
tably ended up being the most
boring. Some of the shorts in this
festival have subtle laughs, while
others bring down the house with
all-out yuks.
Ultimately, the main problem
with these animation festivals is
that after one or two of them it
all starts seeming the same. Still,
for those unfamiliar with the
genre, this year's "Festival of
Animation" is a good place to start.
Especially if you'd like to see an
alien lizard come slithering out of
your date's nose.
