# One man, one trumpet, eight Grammys

### Mia Manzulli Senior staff writer 
At age 6, Wynton Marsalis
was given his first trumpet.
Now, at 27, he is considered
one of America's finest jazz in
strumentalists. The trumpet
has taken Marsalis from his
hometown of New Orleans, the
city of so many significant jazz
musicians, all the way to the
top of his profession. Marsalis
won his eighth Grammy Award
in 1988, becoming the first art
ist in history to win jazz Gram
mys for five consecutive years.
On Sunday, Marsalis will per
form an outdoor jazz concert in
Frost Ampitheater. The Mar
salis ensemble will include
pianist Marcus Roberts, Herlin
Riley on drums, bassist
Reginald Veal, Todd Williams
on tenor and soprano sax, and
Wes Anderson on alto sax.
Marsalis' diversity and as
suredness as a musician place
him among the ranks of those
artists he admires most: Louis
Armstrong, Duke Ellington,
Billy Strayhorn, Wayne Shorter
and Thelonious Monk. He has
stuck with the fine tradition of
jazz, never giving in to the
trendy commercialism that has
compromised many a jazz art
ist.
At age 17, Marsalis began
studying at the Berkshire Music
Center at Tanglewood. He then
attended Julliard where he was
recognized as the school's most
impressive trumpeter.
"I studied classical music be
cause so many young musicians
were scared of this big monster
called classical music. I wanted
to know what it was that scared
everyone so bad," recalls Mar
salis.
"I think — I know — it's

harder to be a good jazz
musician at an early age than
a classical one. In jazz, to be a
good performer means to be an
individual, which you don't
have to be in classical music.
But because I've played with or
chestras and all that, some
people think I'm a classical
musician who plays jazz. They
have it backwards! I'm a jazz
musician who can play classical
music."
Certainly, his classical train
ing has boosted his musical
ability. Since his 1982 debut
album "Wynton Marsalis," he
has won wide respect in both
jazz and classical music fields
for his technical prowess and
diversity of repertoire. In 1984,
Marsalis became the first in
strumentalist ever to win
Grammy Awards in both jazz
(for best soloist on "Think of
One") and classical categories
(for best soloist with orchestra,
"Trumpet Concertos").
In addition to performing
with his sestet and recording,
Marsalis travels around the
country working with musicans
on the lecture circuit.
Wynton Marsalis is an artist
with a vision. His goal is to
match his technical gifts with
a conception comprehensive
enough to render all aspects of
life in the terms of the jazz
tradition to which he is whole
heartedly devoted. Check him
out on Sunday for a guaranteed
exciting afternoon of jazz.
