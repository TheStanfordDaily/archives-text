# Changing the guard: New IFC pres. stresses unified system
## 
### DJ Berinstein Senior staff writer 
Maintaining a steady stream of lead
ership, the Interfraternity Council last
night elevated its vice-president, junior
Todd Ortega, to its presidential post.
Ortega, a member of the Sigma Phi
Epsilon Fraternity, is the first member
of an unhoused fraternity to be elected
IFC president in recent years. Running
on a platform that stressed unity within
the entire system, Ortega said "We are
16 chapters, but we should try to act as
one cohesive body."
During his campaign speech to the IFC,
Ortega acknowledged that some housed

fraternity members might question his
commitment to the entire fraternal sys
tem.
But current IFC President Chris Erlin
brushed aside any such concern, stressing
that Ortega is "working for the whole
system.
"I've worked with Todd all year," said
Erlin, "and he's genuinely concerned with
housed fraternities maintaining their
houses.
Ortega said he was confident that "the
system should run like a well-oiled ma
chine.
"This is a new era," he said of his
unhoused status as president. "We can
demonstrate how to cross the housed and

unhoused lines to have a whole inter
grated unit. I want to put the system
ahead of the individual house."
As president, Ortega will lead the entire
IFC, act as its spokesman on campus and
to the community, establish and direct
existing IFC committees, and have the
tie-breaking vote in any IFC election.
According to Ortega, his main objective
is to unify the system as a whole and
strengthen alumni support through the
Alumni IFC as well as individual frater
nal alumni associations. He also wants
to increase outreach to the dormitories
and to the faculty.
Last night's annual elections were held
for the entire IFC Executive Board with

each candidate presenting his platform,
then leaving the room while IFC repre
sentatives debated their pros and cons.
Ortega was one of two candidates vying
for the presidential post, while the vice
president spot was a tighter one with
four candidates running.
After two run-offs, the IFC voted in
sophomore Eric Jorgensen, after Erlin
broke the tie with a deciding vote.
Jorgensen, a member of Sigma Chi,
ran on a platform echoing Ortega's. He
called for a "strong system" with sub
stantial cooperation between fraternal or
ganizations. As the former social chair
and assistant Rush chair to his own fra
ternity, Jorgensen has experience with

Rush, one of the main duties of the vice
president.
Jorgensen stressed fraternal outreach
in dormitories, and said he wants to unify
more of the different fraternities through
Rush. "It seems like we're all on different
teams during Rush," he added. "We
should work together to make the whole
system stronger."
Both Ortega and Jorgensen stressed
the importance of upcoming joint parties
hosted by two fraternities. Ortega said
he thinks the parties will strengthen ties
within the whole system, and wants to
