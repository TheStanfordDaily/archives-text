# Pint-sized Holly Hunter jazzes 'Miss Firecracker'
## 
### Alex Kostich Staff writer 
Beth Henley's 1984 off-Broadway play, "The
Miss Firecracker Contest," has been brought
to the screen with much success. It is a small
independent picture with a small independent
cast, and everything else about it is small,
including its pint-sized star, Holly Hunter.
Herein lies the charm of "Miss Firecracker;"
it has an exceptional performance by a likable
actress, and it never aspires to be a grand
overindulgence in social commentary or even
comedy. It's just a sweet, good-natured story
about a woman's preparation for a beauty
pageant, and the subsequent lessons she learns
from the experience.
The opening scene is shot in slow motion,
where 8-year-old Carnelle Scott watches her
glamorous cousin win the annual Yazoo City
"Miss Firecracker Contest." The little girl, all

freckles and gap teeth (with a bad case of
ringworm, to boot), watches the proceedings
with awe, wishing she could join in on the
pageant but suspecting that her looks will not
suffice. The scene is poignant as it hints that
with a little hope and a diehard attitude, even
Carnelle can be a "Miss Firecracker."
Sixteen years later, Carnelle decides she
wants to win the contest in spite of incredible
odds; while her looks have much improved,
her (reputation in tiny Yazoo City hasn't (the
flirtatious affairs she's had have earned her the
name "Miss Hot Tamale"). Carnelle wants to
leave the small Mississippi town in "a blaze
of glory," and then continue her life as a blue
collar worker.
Holly "Broadcast News" Hunter reprises her
stage role as Carnelle Scott and her Mississippi
twang is as authentic as ever. Her cherubic
looks and fragile build suggest a vulnerable,

sensitive girl-woman. But as Carnelle Scott,
Hunter is no "Miss Firecracker" â€” she's Miss
Dynamite.
She thrusts herself into the pageant prepa
ration with such a fierce desire to win that
losing seems impossible. Her high hopes and
aspirations can virtually be seen in her big
brown eyes as they gaze off in reverie. The
unexpected ending brings about an unexpected
change in Hunter's character, and it is this
change that deems her so endearing and real.
"Miss Firecracker" gets saccharine as it tries
to sneak its way into your heart; it's so sunny
and cheerful that it sometimes tends to look
like a Hallmark card come to life. But Hunter
DOES sneak her way into your heart, and her
performance carries the film past its feel-good
simplicity. Cute, humorous and full of heart,
"Miss Firecracker" isn't about winning or
losing. It's about one woman's discovery that
you don't need a crown to be a queen.
