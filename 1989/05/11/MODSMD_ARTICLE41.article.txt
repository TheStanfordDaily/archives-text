# Beach Blanket Aliens lots o' fun....

### Alex Kostich Staff writer 
I had quite a few reservations
about seeing a movie called "Earth
Girls Are Easy." Was it a soft-core
porn version of "E.T."? Or was it
a documentary on the female ge
ology students at USC? Just kid
ding. I was pleasantly surprised to
find that it was a musical fantasy
set in the San Fernando Valley
(Like, no way! You've GOT to be
kidding me!).
Geena Davis (a recent Oscar
winner for her performance in
"The Accidental Tourist") plays a
Valley Girl just about to be
married. Her plans change when
she finds her fiance "playing Doc
tor" with one of his colleague
nurses. Heartbroken, she goes sun
bathing in her backyard to tan
away her woes. Suddenly a huge

spaceship lands in her swimming
pool, and out walk three hairy mar
tians.
Julie Brown, who scored a comic
hit a few years ago with "The
Homecoming Queen's Got a
Gun," wrote the screenplay and
songs in "Earth Girls Are Easy."
She steals the show in her bit role
as a peppy beautician, and her
latest single, "Cuz I'm a Blond,"
is the funniest and best episode in
the film.
If Brown had Davis' starring
role, "Earth Girls Are Easy" could
have survived its last half. But the
movie runs out of steam (and
jokes) when the plot overtakes the
song-and-gag routine.
Anybody seeing the movie won't
care about whether or not the
aliens phone home — it's the mu
sical numbers that are fun.
Julian Temple, director of the

underrated musical "Absolute
Beginners," captures a cotton
candy look for his movie by
bathing it in fluorescent colors.
The characters wear bright cos
tumes and walk through slick plas
tic sets.
As the movie unfolds with its
wild designs it's hard to lose in
terest. But the spirit Temple begins
with seems to peter out towards
the end. Consequently, the spec
trum of colors and images
dwindles down and evaporates into
dull scenes that look taken from
a commercial.
"Earth Girls Are Easy" is a lot
like a wind up toy full of off-beat
gadgets. It starts out full of energy,
but ends up with a very dull thud.

"Earth Girls Are Easy" opens to
morrow at the Guild Theater in
Menlo Park.
