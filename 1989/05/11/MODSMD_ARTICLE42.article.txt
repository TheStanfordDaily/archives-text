# ....and baseball movie 'a home run'
## 
### Alex Kostich Staff writer 
"Field of Dreams" is a wonderfully original and
invigorating film with an unpredictability that sets
it apart from most of this year's releases. It's a fable
of one man's spiritual redemption through America's
favorite pastime, baseball.
Kevin Costner plays Ray Kinsella, an lowa farmer
who hears a voice in his cornfield urging him to
build a baseball diamond in the midst of his crops.
He knows it's crazy, but something tells him that
the outcome will be worthwhile.
Sure enough, when the field is complete, the eight
men of the Chicago Black Sox begin appearing. Ray
is stupefied but flattered to have his idols play ball
in his backyard. Flis wife and child see the goings-on
as well, but all other outsiders think Ray is crazy
because the field appears empty.
The strength of the film lies in Phil Alden Rob
inson's dreamy script and Costner's equally dreamy
performance. The dialogue is down to earth even

though the situation is not, thus making the story
much more believable (Ray's first observation of the
ghosts in his field: "Wow . . . this is so cool.").
Costner keeps getting better with each film, and
his performance here is much more worthy of an
Oscar than his "Bull Durham" portrayal. Amy
Madigan brings a spunky Midwestern charm to her
small role as Ray's wife, and she has a great scene
at her town's PTA meeting in which she condemns
a suggested book-burning session.
"Field of Dreams" is very much like a movie Steven
Spielberg would make, minus the blue light and
clouds of smoke. It takes a common American family
in a common American town and injects it with a
supernatural element. But the fact that it remains
so small-scale and down-to-earth is only an advantage
to the film. If it had elaborate special effects it would
lose all of its meat-and-potatoes charm.
Costner's rooted John Doe characterization and
Robinson's excellent screenplay take a far-fetched
story and transform it into a delicate tale of a man's
coming to terms with himself and his past.
