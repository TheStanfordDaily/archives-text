# Thumbs up on 'Upwardly Mobile'
## 
### Mia Manzulli Senior staff writer 
Plenty of freshmen stay up late
talking in the hallways. Majors
are chosen, gossip exchanged,
parties planned. Most of these
decisions are forgotten the next
morning. But for Jay Jay Kuo, a
freshman-year conversation with
close friend Diana Joseph gave
birth to the concept of a full-scale
musical production.
"I had the idea freshman year
to do a show about what our
generation represents," said Kuo,
now a junior resident assistant
at Otero House. "It was nothing
concrete at that point. 1 was more
interested in the idea."
"I wanted to write something
about people my age — we who
were born at the end of an era,
who went through puberty under
Ronald Reagan, who survived
disco and Brady Bunch re-runs,
who now try so desperately not
to rock the boat — or do we?"
Now, two years later, Kuo's
light opera, "Upwardly Mobile,"
takes what he calls "a slice of
life approach" to looking at the
college years. He began writing
the musical score in his fresh
man year, but it was a long proc
ess that was only completed this
past winter quarter.
Kuo says that 90 percent of
the show is sung, although there
are monologues interspersed
throughout. Not only does Kuo
produce "Upwardly Mobile" but
he also wrote the musical's 32
songs. He said that "the score is

163 pages long. I basically moved
into the computer room in Otero
and wore out the laser printer."
With the show heavily depen
dent on Kuo's score, he had to
find a strong vocal cast. And
"Upwardly Mobile" succeeded in
recruiting many singing talents.
Two Mendicants, one Fleet
Street Singer and a member of
Mixed Company are in the cast.
Even the show's vocal director
has roots in an a capella group
— sophomore Micah Freedman
sings with Fleet Street as well as
with the Stanford Chorale. Al
though the musical demands a
lot from its vocalists, Freedman
said that the score is fairly
straight-forward.
Originally, Kuo planned to do
"Upwardly Mobile" at Otero, but
then decided to present his idea
to Ram's Head. The theatrical
society liked his proposal and
decided to support his efforts.
"The show is about four people
who start off in college together.
And 'Upwardly Mobile' was con
ceived by a group of friends who
just pulled it all together," said
junior Diana Joseph, Kuo's
freshman-year friend who is now
directing the musical.
"'Upwardly Mobile' is a very
pertinent play for here — it has
a very Stanford point of view,"
said Joseph. She believes that the
show could be adjusted for a
wider audience because the lyrics
would fit in anywhere, but that
right now the dialogue "is fairly
specific to Stanford or a similar
elite institution."

"This play is particularly rel
evant for people our age to see,"
added Kuo. "Older audiences
might not understand it as well.
It is for and about us." He said
that "Upwardly Mobile" at
tempts to achieve a balance be
tween comedy and seriousness.
"It gets very emotional, because
being here is often very emotion
al."
Damian Marhefka, a sopho
more, plays "Barrett," a student
with a lot of ambition and a soft
spot for "Gloria," played by soph
omore Debbie Wicks. Gloria's
roommate "Nkechi," (junior
Sheeri Caldwell) who eventually
becomes president of the Black
Student Association, and her ad
mirer "Gregory" (junior Dan
Martin) are the other two leads.
All four do a good job of getting
their emotions across both in
song and in monologue.
As Barrett, Marhefka bnngs a
lot of spark and personality to
the stage. He has a powerful
voice that really shines in his
solo numbers. His heart-broken
lament "Maybe I'll Be Okay"
stands out in Act One.
As Gregory, Martin must cope
with falling in love with a black
woman who loves him but
doesn't want to. He is tender
and sweet in his solo numbers
and in his duets with Nkechi —
their voices blend beautifully in
"Away From Him/In My Arms."
Sadly for Gregory, there is a part
of Nkechi that he can never have.

Gloria (Debbie Wicks) sings with the chorus on "Queen," one of the many delightful student-written
songs in "Upwardly Mobile."
Kuo's lyrics are clever and conversational as songs
in a musical should be. Pay close attention to the
words of "Trash" in Act One — you can relive your
toy-playing days of the past. Remember Slinky, and
Lite-Brite and Etch-A-Sketch? This number is sure
to conjure up a memory or two.
"Upwardly Mobile" presents a realistic, if some
what disillusioning, view of today's generation. It
forces us to re-evaluate what really makes us happy.
It is an impressive production, however, with clever
(and sometimes corny) monologues that take on a
reminiscent quality. The show provides an entertain
ing retrospective, particularly for seniors about to
graduate and move on. Sad and depressing as that
may be....

"Upwardly Mobile" plays at the Christine Ricker
Dining and Performance Center (Crudpuck) tonight
through Saturday at 8 p.m. Tickets are S4 and are
available in White Plaza from Noon - 2 p.m. or at
the door. The Saturday show is already sold out,
and tickets for the other shows are going fast.

lot of spark and personality to
the stage. He has a powerful
voice that really shines in his
solo numbers. His heart-broken
lament "Maybe I'll Be Okay"
stands out in Act One.
As Gregory, Martin must cope
with falling in love with a black
woman who loves him but
doesn't want to. He is tender
and sweet in his solo numbers
and in his duets with Nkechi —
their voices blend beautifully in
"Away From Him/In My Arms."
Sadly for Gregory, there is a part
of Nkechi that he can never have.

Gloria (Debbie Wicks) sings with the chorus on "Queen," one of the many delightful student-written
songs in "Upwardly Mobile."
Kuo's lyrics are clever and conversational as songs
in a musical should be. Pay close attention to the
words of "Trash" in Act One — you can relive your
toy-playing days of the past. Remember Slinky, and
Lite-Brite and Etch-A-Sketch? This number is sure
to conjure up a memory or two.
"Upwardly Mobile" presents a realistic, if some
what disillusioning, view of today's generation. It
forces us to re-evaluate what really makes us happy.
It is an impressive production, however, with clever
(and sometimes corny) monologues that take on a
reminiscent quality. The show provides an entertain
ing retrospective, particularly for seniors about to
graduate and move on. Sad and depressing as that
may be....

"Upwardly Mobile" plays at the Christine Ricker
Dining and Performance Center (Crudpuck) tonight
through Saturday at 8 p.m. Tickets are S4 and are
available in White Plaza from Noon - 2 p.m. or at
the door. The Saturday show is already sold out,
and tickets for the other shows are going fast.
Plenty of freshmen stay up late
talking in the hallways. Majors
are chosen, gossip exchanged,
parties planned. Most of these
decisions are forgotten the next
morning. But for Jay Jay Kuo, a
freshman-year conversation with
close friend Diana Joseph gave
birth to the concept of a full-scale
musical production.
"I had the idea freshman year
to do a show about what our
generation represents," said Kuo,
now a junior resident assistant
at Otero House. "It was nothing
concrete at that point. 1 was more
interested in the idea."
"I wanted to write something
about people my age — we who
were born at the end of an era,
who went through puberty under
Ronald Reagan, who survived
disco and Brady Bunch re-runs,
who now try so desperately not
to rock the boat — or do we?"
Now, two years later, Kuo's
light opera, "Upwardly Mobile,"
takes what he calls "a slice of
life approach" to looking at the
college years. He began writing
the musical score in his fresh
man year, but it was a long proc
ess that was only completed this
past winter quarter.
Kuo says that 90 percent of
the show is sung, although there
are monologues interspersed
throughout. Not only does Kuo
produce "Upwardly Mobile" but
he also wrote the musical's 32
songs. He said that "the score is

163 pages long. I basically moved
into the computer room in Otero
and wore out the laser printer."
With the show heavily depen
dent on Kuo's score, he had to
find a strong vocal cast. And
"Upwardly Mobile" succeeded in
recruiting many singing talents.
Two Mendicants, one Fleet
Street Singer and a member of
Mixed Company are in the cast.
Even the show's vocal director
has roots in an a capella group
— sophomore Micah Freedman
sings with Fleet Street as well as
with the Stanford Chorale. Al
though the musical demands a
lot from its vocalists, Freedman
said that the score is fairly
straight-forward.
Originally, Kuo planned to do
"Upwardly Mobile" at Otero, but
then decided to present his idea
to Ram's Head. The theatrical
society liked his proposal and
decided to support his efforts.
"The show is about four people
who start off in college together.
And 'Upwardly Mobile' was con
ceived by a group of friends who
just pulled it all together," said
junior Diana Joseph, Kuo's
freshman-year friend who is now
directing the musical.
"'Upwardly Mobile' is a very
pertinent play for here — it has
a very Stanford point of view,"
said Joseph. She believes that the
show could be adjusted for a
wider audience because the lyrics
would fit in anywhere, but that
right now the dialogue "is fairly
specific to Stanford or a similar
elite institution."

"This play is particularly rel
evant for people our age to see,"
added Kuo. "Older audiences
might not understand it as well.
It is for and about us." He said
that "Upwardly Mobile" at
tempts to achieve a balance be
tween comedy and seriousness.
"It gets very emotional, because
being here is often very emotion
al."
Damian Marhefka, a sopho
more, plays "Barrett," a student
with a lot of ambition and a soft
spot for "Gloria," played by soph
omore Debbie Wicks. Gloria's
roommate "Nkechi," (junior
Sheeri Caldwell) who eventually
becomes president of the Black
Student Association, and her ad
mirer "Gregory" (junior Dan
Martin) are the other two leads.
All four do a good job of getting
their emotions across both in
song and in monologue.
As Barrett, Marhefka bnngs a
lot of spark and personality to
the stage. He has a powerful
voice that really shines in his
solo numbers. His heart-broken
lament "Maybe I'll Be Okay"
