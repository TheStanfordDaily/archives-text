# Alumni keeping Indian mascot alive
## 
### Quan Phung 
Trying to recapture the nostalgia and
spirit of the University mascot that was
discarded in the early 19705, the Indian,
an alumni group recently began selling
merchandise featuring the controversial
Indian logo.
Over the last year, the "Indians," an
organization headed by alumnus Robert
Fuller, class of 1960, have distributed
advertisements to various alumni mem
bers. These ads feature watches, decals,
key chains and buttons, all displaying
an angry, crossed-eye Indian wearing
an "S sweatshirt.
Fuller said the idea came to him years
ago, but he did not begin marketing his
products until recently, and has kept
his project fairly low-key because of the

controversy surrounding the mascot.
During the 1970-71 school year, then
University President Richard Lyman
abandoned the Indian as the official
mascot after a group of Native American
students expressed concern that the In
dian did not accurately depict Native
American people and culture. Further,
the group said ritual dances during
halftime shows were sacrilegious and
offensive.
But to many devoted Stanford alumni
and fans who adored the Indian,
Lyman's decision signified the Univer
sity's fall to pressure from "radical"
groups, according to Dean of Student
Affairs James Lyons. Consequently, con
servative groups such as the New Foun
ders League and the Friends of the
Stanford Indians emerged and fought

to reclaim the Indian mascot, Lyons
said.
According to Fuller, some of his cus
tomers have suggested that he spear
head a campaign to revive the Indian.
But Fuller said he does not want to be
associated with these groups. "I'm not
sure they ought to bring back the In
dian."
Fuller said he understands that Stan
ford today is nothing like the Stanford
of the late '50s and '60s. His only reason
for venturing into his little business is
to reminisce about his college days and
to have fun.
Since the release of the advertise
ments, Fuller has received back 10 per
cent of all order forms distributed. Of
