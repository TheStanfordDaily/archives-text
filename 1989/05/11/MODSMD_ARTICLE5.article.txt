# Alumni keeping Indian mascot alive
## 
### Quan Phung 
Trying to recapture the nostalgia and
spirit of the University mascot that was
discarded in the early 19705, the Indian,
an alumni group recently began selling
merchandise featuring the controversial
Indian logo.
Over the last year, the "Indians," an
organization headed by alumnus Robert
Fuller, class of 1960, have distributed
advertisements to various alumni mem
bers. These ads feature watches, decals,
key chains and buttons, all displaying
an angry, crossed-eye Indian wearing
an "S sweatshirt.
Fuller said the idea came to him years
ago, but he did not begin marketing his
products until recently, and has kept
his project fairly low-key because of the

controversy surrounding the mascot.
During the 1970-71 school year, then
University President Richard Lyman
abandoned the Indian as the official
mascot after a group of Native American
students expressed concern that the In
dian did not accurately depict Native
American people and culture. Further,
the group said ritual dances during
halftime shows were sacrilegious and
offensive.
But to many devoted Stanford alumni
and fans who adored the Indian,
Lyman's decision signified the Univer
sity's fall to pressure from "radical"
groups, according to Dean of Student
Affairs James Lyons. Consequently, con
servative groups such as the New Foun
ders League and the Friends of the
Stanford Indians emerged and fought

to reclaim the Indian mascot, Lyons
said.
According to Fuller, some of his cus
tomers have suggested that he spear
head a campaign to revive the Indian.
But Fuller said he does not want to be
associated with these groups. "I'm not
sure they ought to bring back the In
dian."
Fuller said he understands that Stan
ford today is nothing like the Stanford
of the late '50s and '60s. His only reason
for venturing into his little business is
to reminisce about his college days and
to have fun.
Since the release of the advertise
ments, Fuller has received back 10 per
cent of all order forms distributed. Of
those received, Fuller claims 99
percent of the alums were excited
at the prospects of rekindling
their Stanford Indian days.
Fuller said that "old alums
should have a right to be nostalgic.
They (the Indians) existed at one
point. My attitude is that there
isn't anjlhing racial about it. If
I thought there was, I'd stop doing
it."
Fuller said that even today he
and his classmates still identify
with the Indian rather than the
University's current mascot, the
Cardinal. "We (were) the Indians.
There's nothing negative about

that."
Members of the Stanford Native
American community today, how
ever, disagree. Tracey Leßeau,
chair of the Stanford American
Indian Organization, has seen this
seemingly harmless drive for nos
talgia too many times.
Citing an incident where an
alumni group asked the Band to
play an old Indian fight song dur
ing Big Game, Leßeau said these
requests and campaigns perpetu
ate stereotypes and a negative at
titude towards Native Americans.
"It's insulting and disrespectful,
not only to Native Americans, but
to the University since they have
already taken a stance on the
issue."
Jim Larimore, assistant dean of
Student Affairs and a resident fel

low at Lathrop House, the Amer
ican Indian theme house, also
disapproves of Fuller's venture.
He added that reviving the Indian
mascot in any form is "deterimen
tal to the ASSU and Stanford stu
dent body" because they voted the
mascot out years ago.
Larimore said this is "more
than an Indian issue. It's an issue
the entire community should have
strong views about." Larimore
does not see the logic of nostaglia
behind Fuller's intentions. "Value
of nostalgia aside, you can't use
blatantly stereotypical images for
•fun.' "
Rather, Larimore suggested
that alumni like Fuller are not in
touch with the struggle of Native
Americans.
