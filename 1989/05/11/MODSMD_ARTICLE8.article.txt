# Tresidder says, Bon Appetit

### Eric Young Editorial staff 
Tresidder Union officials are negotiating
with Bon Appetit Catering, looking to strike
a sweet deal as the San Francisco-based
food servers take over for outgoing Marriott
Corp. on Aug. 31.
Assoc. Director of Tresidder Paul
Szczesiul said negotiations started early
last week. Within the next two weeks he
said he hopes at least to have "an agreement
we can shake hands on."
Under contract as food service managers,
Bon Appetit will be responsible for buying,
preparing and serving food and staffing
the food services at Tresidder. The union's
food services include: the CofTee House,
Grand Marketplace, Corner Pocket, The
Patio Grill, Encina Station, Tresidder
Catering and The Store.
Bon Appetit has 18 other food service
accounts in California, according to Earnest
Collins, president of the 11-year-old com
pany.

While Collins was tight-lipped about Bon
Appetit's dealings with the University,
Szczesiul lauded the food service firm.
Tresidder decided Bon Appetit was "best
equipped" for the University after narrow
ing down their decision between them and
ARA Services Corp. in Philadelphia.
Tresidder officials said another deciding
factor was Bon Appetit's "attractive ap
proach to business" and impressive track
record in the food world.
And when it comes down to the bottom
line, Szczesiul said that with the new serv
ices "we hope to get a larger share of the
food market" on campus.
Szczesiul said it was also beneficial to
have Bon Appetit management just a short
drive north as opposed to having Marriott's
corporate offices 3,000 miles away in Bet
hesda, Md.
Tresidder announced April 12 a joint de
cision with Marriott not to continue Mar-
riott's contract to oversee food
service. Marriott management
blamed financial and logistical dif
ficulties for precipitating their de
cision to move out.
Greg Mount, a Marriott em
ployee and general manager of
Tresidder's food services was
quoted in April as saying, "We
felt that under the present con
tractual arrangements there was
no opportunity to make any
money."

Szczesiul said Tresidder ex
plored several options of ways to
organize their food services. They
thought of breaking it up into
smaller contracts, and even talked
with University Food Service, but
did not reach any substantial
agreement.
He added that Bon Appetit
"marketed themselves year
round" so it was easy to contact
them when Marriott announced
it was leaving.
Since they are still in early
stages of negotiations, Szczesiul
said he could not tell what type
of turnover in employee ranks to
expect. "Some people know what

to expect," he said, because they
had been through such a change
before. However, other newer
workers were a little worried
about what to expect with the
new bosses, he said.
He said all current employees
and management were encouraged
to stay.
He said he knew that plenty of
work lay ahead during the tran
sition period after Marriott moves
out at the end of August. There
is a lot of equipment to move and
"that transition period is over
Labor Day weekend . . . and you
can bet we won't be resting
much."
