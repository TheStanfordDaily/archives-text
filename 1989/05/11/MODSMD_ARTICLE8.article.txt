Tresidder Union officials are negotiating
with Bon Appetit Catering, looking to strike
a sweet deal as the San Francisco-based
food servers take over for outgoing Marriott
Corp. on Aug. 31.
Assoc. Director of Tresidder Paul
Szczesiul said negotiations started early
last week. Within the next two weeks he
said he hopes at least to have "an agreement
we can shake hands on."
Under contract as food service managers,
Bon Appetit will be responsible for buying,
preparing and serving food and staffing
the food services at Tresidder. The union's
food services include: the CofTee House,
Grand Marketplace, Corner Pocket, The
Patio Grill, Encina Station, Tresidder
Catering and The Store.
Bon Appetit has 18 other food service
accounts in California, according to Earnest
Collins, president of the 11-year-old com
pany.

While Collins was tight-lipped about Bon
Appetit's dealings with the University,
Szczesiul lauded the food service firm.
Tresidder decided Bon Appetit was "best
equipped" for the University after narrow
ing down their decision between them and
ARA Services Corp. in Philadelphia.
Tresidder officials said another deciding
factor was Bon Appetit's "attractive ap
proach to business" and impressive track
record in the food world.
And when it comes down to the bottom
line, Szczesiul said that with the new serv
ices "we hope to get a larger share of the
food market" on campus.
Szczesiul said it was also beneficial to
have Bon Appetit management just a short
drive north as opposed to having Marriott's
corporate offices 3,000 miles away in Bet
hesda, Md.
