Welcome to the world of Stan
ford women's swimming where
"tremendous" just isn't good
enough.
Two weeks ago, Cardinal Coach
Richard Quick announced that
three outstanding recruits had
signed letters of intent with Stan
ford, the defending national cham
pion. Speaking about his recruit
ing class, he then said, "Without
her it's a tremendous class and
with her it's the best recruiting
class in the nation ... It could
be the best ever."
The "her" is triple Olympic gold
medalist Janet Evans, who an
nounced yesterday that she will
enroll at Stanford this fall. Evans
chose Stanford over 1989 NCAA
runner-up Texas and third-place
finisher Florida.
"I think it's great for the entire
Athletic Department and the
women's swimming program, be
cause it does bring in an athlete
of very high visibility and will stir
interest in the program," Quick
said last night.
"She is a tremendous athlete
and will help us attain our team
goals, and along with that, we will
help her try to attain her indi
vidual goals. She wants to swim
faster than she's ever swum
before and that's saying a lot be
cause she has swum very fast,
with the emphasis on very," Quick
added.
Evans actually signed her letter
of intent Wednesday and called
Quick to tell him she wanted to
talk to him. Quick flew down yes
terday morning to pick up the
letter and talk with Evans, who
is competing in the three-day Cal
ifornia lnterscholastic Federation
Championships in Long
Beach.
Evans, i senior at El
Dorado High School in
Placentia, Calif., first came
to national prominence as a
15-year-old at the U.S. Long
Course Nationals in Clovis,
Calif., in the summer of
1987. She won four events
and set world records in the
800-meter freestyle and the
1500-meter freestyle in that
meet.
In the 1988 Olympics in
Seoul, Evans won the 400-
meter individual medley, the
400-meter freestyle and the
800-meter freestyle and set
a world record in the 400-
meter freestyle. She also
currently holds the world
record in the 800-meter and
1500-meter freestyles.
"The great thing about
Janet Evans," Quick said,
"is that she's a fabulous ath
lete but an even better per
son. Everyone on our team
will be better because she's
on the team. The things she
has accomplished are with
out precedent in United
States swimming. With all
her accomplishments, Janet
has not changed one iota.
She is gracious, humble and
just a great person to be
around "
Quick said he was some
what confident Evans would
choose the Farm ever since
her campus visit two weeks
ago. "She told me she en
joyed the school, enjoyed
everyone she met, ei\joyed
the team and 1 think she
liked me a little bit," he said
