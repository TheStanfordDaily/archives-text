Welcome to the world of Stan
ford women's swimming where
"tremendous" just isn't good
enough.
Two weeks ago, Cardinal Coach
Richard Quick announced that
three outstanding recruits had
signed letters of intent with Stan
ford, the defending national cham
pion. Speaking about his recruit
ing class, he then said, "Without
her it's a tremendous class and
with her it's the best recruiting
class in the nation ... It could
be the best ever."
The "her" is triple Olympic gold
medalist Janet Evans, who an
nounced yesterday that she will
enroll at Stanford this fall. Evans
chose Stanford over 1989 NCAA
runner-up Texas and third-place
finisher Florida.
"I think it's great for the entire
Athletic Department and the
women's swimming program, be
cause it does bring in an athlete
of very high visibility and will stir
interest in the program," Quick
said last night.
"She is a tremendous athlete
and will help us attain our team
goals, and along with that, we will
help her try to attain her indi
vidual goals. She wants to swim
faster than she's ever swum
before and that's saying a lot be
cause she has swum very fast,
with the emphasis on very," Quick
added.
Evans actually signed her letter
of intent Wednesday and called
Quick to tell him she wanted to
talk to him. Quick flew down yes
terday morning to pick up the
letter and talk with Evans, who
is competing in the three-day Cal
ifornia lnterscholastic Federation
