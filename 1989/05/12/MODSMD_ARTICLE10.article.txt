# Leary says think for yourself

### Rob Burwell Senior staff writer 
"Examine the chains and
shackles that authorities put on
you and keep you from thinking
for yourself."
These are the words of the man
who former President Richard
Nixon once called "the most dan
gerous man alive." Sporting a
jacket and tie instead of love
beads, Timothy Leary delighted a
near-capacity crowd in Annenberg
Auditorium last night.
Purporting to "perform philos
ophy", the former Harvard Uni
versity psychiatrist and 1960s
guru rambled through a number
of "original ideas" and "goofy
ideas" to get audience members
to think for themselves and ques
tion authority.
Rising to prominence in the late
19505, Leary was known for his
controversial first-hand studies of
the effects of psychadelic drugs.

His most famous moment oc
curred when he called on students
nationwide to "Tune in, turn on
and drop out."
He is now the president of a
computer software company.
Leary chronicled the history of
human subordination from the
origin of man and the Garden of
Eden through feudal societies to
industrial society and finally to
our present post-industrial infor
mation age.
"The philosophy of the 20th
century is linguistics," Leary said.
"Who controls language controls
the people. The 'haves' are not
just those with money; the 'haves'
are the ones with the informa
tion."
Comparing the act of people
thinking for themselves and doing
their own thing to a jazz jam ses
sion, Leary said that the best har
monies are those performed by
unrestricted individuals.
"Pretty soon we'll have millions

thinking for themselves, not lis
tening to Dan Rather on ABC
CBS-CIA," Leary said.
"Americans now watch an
average of 7.5 hours of TV a day,"
Leary said. "Now people are con
trolled by the boob toob. Watching
that much TV is like voluntarily
giving your brain to Big Brother."
Leary began his speech by say
ing a few words about Abbie Hoff
man â€” a man who he said,
"changed the course of human
politics forever." Hoffman died
two weeks ago.
According to Leary, Hoffman
was a leader whose politics were
not partisan, but politics of con
sciousness. He wanted people to
think and to laugh at the es
tablishment.
Hoffman "was not a classic left
ist," Leary explained. "Although
many people would like to think
that Abbie was a communist, he
did admit to being a Marxist ....
a Groucho Marxist."
