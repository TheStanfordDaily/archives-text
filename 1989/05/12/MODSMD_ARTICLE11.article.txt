## President Bush orders combat troops to Panama 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - President
Bush ordered 2,000 combat troops into
Panama yesterday "to protect the lives
of American citizens" and urged other
Latin American nations to exert diplo
matic pressure in retaliation for "the
bullying tactics" of military ruler
Manuel Antonio Noriega.
Acting in the first foreign policy crisis
of his presidency, Bush also recalled the
U.S. ambassador, Arthur Davis, and
reduced the embassy staff to essential
personnel.
The administration acknowledged
that Bush's action was not in response
to any immediate threat and said it was
unlikely Noriega would do anything to
provoke a military encounter with U.S.
troops. Bush's steps seemed more of a
measured response designed to encour
age Panamanians to force Noriega from
power.
The action comes in the wake of Wed
nesday's bloody attacks by Noriega's
supporters and troops against the op
position's presidential candidate and his
running mates, whom the United States
regards as the winners of Panama's
election.
Bush said U.S. government employees
and their dependents living outside of
military bases would be returned to the
United States or relocated for safety
reasons from Panama City and other
locations to U.S. bases in Panama.
"I'm worried about the lives of Amer
ican citizens," Bush said in announcing
his actions in the White House briefing
room.
"I will do what is necessary to protect
the lives of American citizens, and we

will not be intimidated by the bullying
tactics — brutal though they may be
— of the dictator Noriega," the presi
dent said.
Brent Scowcroft, the president's na
tional security adviser, said he doubted
Noriega would challenge the U.S. forces.
"He's a thug but he clearly operates
with some prudence when he has to,"
Scowcroft said.
Unlike the Reagan administration,
Bush said he would not consider drop
ping drug charges against Noriega as
an enticement for him to step down.
"But if there's something short of that,
the door is open to understand what it
is that would be required," Bush said.
The first soldiers headed south last
night as almost 1,000 infantry troops
began leaving Fort Ord, Calif. The
Army's 7th Light Infantry Division at
Fort Ord dispatched 880 combat troops
and 100 cooks, medics and other support
soldiers to Travis Air Force Base, 160
miles away, for the flight to Central
America.
Congressional leaders, briefed in ad
vance by the president, offered Bush
strong support. But some said there is
strong pressure on the president to
either invade Panama or to scrap the
treaties turning the Panama Canal over
to Panama by the end of the century.
Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., the Sen
ate's deputy Democratic leader, revealed
that at a meeting earlier yesterday with
members of Congress, Bush had
"rejected advice to invade Panama or
to break the treaty with Panama." He
did not say who gave that advice.
Bush said every neutral observer had

1 will do what is neces
sary to protect the lives
of American citizens, and
we will not be intimidated
by the bullying tactics of
the dictator Noriega.'
— Pres. Bush

agreed that Noriega's handpicked can
didate, Carlos Duque, had been
decisively defeated in Sunday's presi
dential election by the opposition's
Guillermo Endara, who was attacked
and beaten Wednesday by troops and
paramilitary agents loyal to Noriega.
The Panamanian government has
declared the election results "nullified."
"Efforts to overturn constitutional
regimes or steal elections are unaccept
able," Bush said. Yet, he said he had
not decided whether to recognize En
dara as the legitimate president-elect.
Asked to identify what kind of security
threats warranted the increase in
troops, Scowcroft, said, "It's precaution
ary as much as anything else." He said
it was "a prudent step to take" in view
of harassment of American personnel
and the beatings of Noriega's opponents.
Altogether, there are roughly 51,300
American in Panama. Aside from mili
tary and diplomatic personnel and their
dependents, there are about 21,300 busi
nessmen and U.S. retirees.

provoke a military encounter with U.S.
troops. Bush's steps seemed more of a
measured response designed to encour
age Panamanians to force Noriega from
power.
The action comes in the wake of Wed
nesday's bloody attacks by Noriega's
supporters and troops against the op
position's presidential candidate and his
running mates, whom the United States
regards as the winners of Panama's
election.
Bush said U.S. government employees
and their dependents living outside of
military bases would be returned to the
United States or relocated for safety
reasons from Panama City and other
locations to U.S. bases in Panama.
"I'm worried about the lives of Amer
ican citizens," Bush said in announcing
his actions in the White House briefing
room.
"I will do what is necessary to protect
the lives of American citizens, and we

will not be intimidated by the bullying
tactics — brutal though they may be
— of the dictator Noriega," the presi
dent said.
Brent Scowcroft, the president's na
tional security adviser, said he doubted
Noriega would challenge the U.S. forces.
"He's a thug but he clearly operates
with some prudence when he has to,"
Scowcroft said.
Unlike the Reagan administration,
Bush said he would not consider drop
ping drug charges against Noriega as
an enticement for him to step down.
"But if there's something short of that,
the door is open to understand what it
is that would be required," Bush said.
The first soldiers headed south last
night as almost 1,000 infantry troops
began leaving Fort Ord, Calif. The
Army's 7th Light Infantry Division at
Fort Ord dispatched 880 combat troops
and 100 cooks, medics and other support
soldiers to Travis Air Force Base, 160
miles away, for the flight to Central
America.
Congressional leaders, briefed in ad
vance by the president, offered Bush
strong support. But some said there is
strong pressure on the president to
either invade Panama or to scrap the
treaties turning the Panama Canal over
to Panama by the end of the century.
Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., the Sen
ate's deputy Democratic leader, revealed
that at a meeting earlier yesterday with
members of Congress, Bush had
"rejected advice to invade Panama or
to break the treaty with Panama." He
did not say who gave that advice.
Bush said every neutral observer had

1 will do what is neces
sary to protect the lives
of American citizens, and
we will not be intimidated
by the bullying tactics of
the dictator Noriega.'
— Pres. Bush

agreed that Noriega's handpicked can
didate, Carlos Duque, had been
decisively defeated in Sunday's presi
dential election by the opposition's
Guillermo Endara, who was attacked
and beaten Wednesday by troops and
paramilitary agents loyal to Noriega.
The Panamanian government has
declared the election results "nullified."
"Efforts to overturn constitutional
regimes or steal elections are unaccept
able," Bush said. Yet, he said he had
not decided whether to recognize En
dara as the legitimate president-elect.
Asked to identify what kind of security
threats warranted the increase in
troops, Scowcroft, said, "It's precaution
ary as much as anything else." He said
it was "a prudent step to take" in view
of harassment of American personnel
and the beatings of Noriega's opponents.
Altogether, there are roughly 51,300
American in Panama. Aside from mili
tary and diplomatic personnel and their
dependents, there are about 21,300 busi
nessmen and U.S. retirees.
