# Midgetman fails first test flight
## Air Force claims partial success but missile's future is in doubt

VANDENBERG AIH FORCE
BASE, Calif. (AP) â€” An unarmed
Midgetman missile malfunctioned
and was destroyed yesterday dur
ing the first test flight of the
much-debated weapon system, the
Air Force said.
The missile began tumbling
about 70 seconds after launch
while the second stage was firing.
A range safety officer issued a
command that destroyed the
Midgetman two minutes and nine
seconds into the flight.
The three-stage intercontinen
tal ballistic missile had already
arced westward out of sight of
ground observers when it was
destroyed over the Pacific Ocean.
The distance of the flight was not
revealed.
The missile was supposed to
have delivered its dummy war
head to a test range about 4,600
miles away in the Kwajalein Atoll
about 30 minutes after blastoff.
Maj. Gen. Ed Barry, the Midget
man program director, said at a
news conference that the launch
was a "qualified success" because
the flight test met about 50 per
cent of its objectives.

Excellent telemetry data was re
ceived on the first stage and most
of the second stage, Barry said.
The missile was destroyed 10 to
12 seconds before the third stage
was to ignite.
The telemetry data should
enable investigators to find the
problem and correct it before the
next Midgetman test, Barry said.
The missile is designed to be
fired from a mobile, truck-like
launcher if it becomes operational.
The Midgetman, formally the
Small Intercontinental Ballistic
Missile, is designed to carry a
single nuclear warhead to a target
up to 6,900 miles away.
The three-stage missile weighs
37,000 pounds, stands about 52
feet tall and is 46 inches in
diameter.
Its future is wrapped up in a
political controversy over whether
the United States should develop
one or two mobile missiles for its
nuclear arsenal. The Soviet Union
already has developed and begun
deploying two such "land-mobile"
missiles. The United States has
none.

Democratic leaders
say the Midgetman is
needed to deter the
Soviet Union from at
tempting a first strike
against silo-based
missiles.

missile that could be launched
from a railroad car is favored by
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney,
who says the Pentagon would be
hard pressed by the $25 billion
cost of 500 Midgetmans.
But President Bush recently
decided that both the MX and the
Midgetman should be developed.
On Capitol Hill, Democratic
leaders say the Midgetman, more
mobile than the rail-based MX, is
needed to deter the Soviet Union
from attempting a first strike
against silo-based missiles. Some
Democrats want to speed up
Midgetman development at the ex
pense of the MX.
