Secord faces charges of perjury
WASHINGTON (AP) - Richard Secord, the
retired general enlisted by Oliver North to run
arms to Nicaraguan rebels, was accused in an
indictment unsealed yesterday of lying to
Congress to cover up his profits from the Iran-
Contra affair.
The indictment alleges that more than $1 mil
lion was involved.
Secord, 56, a retired Air Force major general
who already faced one set of charges in the affair,
was accused of seven counts of perjury to
Congress and one count of obstructing the con
gressional Iran-Contra investigation in 1987.
A ninth charge accused him of making a false
statement to staff members for the congressional
panels by saying he wasn't aware that any money
generated by his Iran-Contra transactions had
benefited North.
Each charge carries a maximum sentence of
five years in prison and a $250,000 fine on con
viction.
Secord was the leadoff witness in the televised
hearings conducted in the spring and summer
of 1987 bv the House and Senate committees.

The latest charges by a federal grand jury were
handed up April 7, but weren't unsealed until
yesterday in order to avoid bringing them out
during the trial of North, who was convicted on
three of 12 Iran-Contra counts last Thursday.
Senate panel approves FSX deal
WASHINGTON (AP) - The Senate Foreign
Relations Committee voted narrowly yesterday
to approve the $7 billion FSX deal involving joint
U.S.-Japanese development and production of a
next-generation fighter for Japan.
On a 9-8 vote, the committee rejected a reso
lution to disapprove the deal, which has generated
sharp criticism on Capitol Hill over technology
and economic issues.
Action then shifted to the Senate floor, where
FSX opponents voiced hope they would be able
to muster majority support for the disapproval .
resolution despite their defeat in the committee. I
A companion resolution of disapproval has been
introduced in the House. Even if the resolutions *
were passed, however, a two-thirds majority of Â»
both houses would be needed to override a likely '
presidential veto.
