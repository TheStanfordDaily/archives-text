## Go and be a buddy 
### 
SOME SPECIAL athletes
will gun for the gold on the
Stanford campus this Sun
day.
The athletes are Santa Clara
residents with varying degrees of
mental retardation. On Sunday,
they'll be diving into deGuerre
pool, swimming their fastest and
feeling like winners at Stanford's
eighth annual Special Olympics.
But the special event can't hap
pen without community help.
More than 250 Stanford students
need to come out to deGuerre to
make the day work. Each athlete
is paired with a Stanford "buddy"
who cheers on and guides the
athlete through the day.
Besides the buddy system, stu
dents can help time the races or
lend physical support by pulling
swimmers along on kickboards.

Given that some of these athletes
live in wheelchairs but compete
in the swimming events by
wearing life vests, the help of
students is essential.
Volunteering your time is easy.
Just come to deGuerre pool by 7
a.m. and you'll officially be a part
of the Special Olympics crew.
Shifts go from 7 a.m. to noon or
7 a.m. to 3 p.m.
If you're not an early bird or
can't dedicate half a day, then
just drop by deGuerre for an hour
or so. Cheers and shouts will
psyche up the athletes and let
them know that their efforts are
not going unnoticed.
Sunday is a day for everybody
— athlete and student alike. So
come see what real winning is
all about.
