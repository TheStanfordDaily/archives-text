# An armpit saver

Try hobbling on
wooden crutches from your
class in the Quad, over to
the Post Office and then back to
your dorm room in Lagunita
Hall. Armpits would ache. You'd
be huffing and puffing all day.
Sounds rotten? Sounds pain
ful? Well, Stanford students with
a sprained ankle or a broken leg
used to have no choice. They
either had to shell out $130 a
week for privately owned rental
golf carts or resort to the hob
bling scenario.
But the Disability Resource
Center has come up with a new
service that eliminates the rental
costs yet keeps students off their
crutches.
The new service, headed by

junior Charles Day, provides stu
dents with free on-campus rides.
Rather than force the temporar
ily disabled to aquire a cart on
their own, the center itself now
rents the carts from private com
panies and has eight student
drivers on call to whisk injured
students to class.
Students need to call up the
drivers the day before they plan
on using the service and specify
the times and destinations of
where they need to go.
Sounds simple? It is.
The Disability Resource Center
has come up with a practical, con
venient way to help out injured
students. Those who need to take
advantage of the new service
should call Voice Mail number
725-2484.
