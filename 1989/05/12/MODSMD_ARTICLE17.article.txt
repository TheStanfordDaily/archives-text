Freedom of speech
has never implied
freedom to harass
In all of the concern over the spe
cific wording of the recent drafts of
the clarification of the Fundamental
Standard, we feel that the original
reason for the whole debate has been
lost.
Debates over terms such as "fighting
words" and "community standards,"
while important, have replaced discus
sion over how we can solve the real
problem: harassment of some students
in the dormitories. We hope that in
future weeks we can take on the issue
with renewed commitment, whatever
the specific course of our actions, so
that as a community we can move
forward to address the challenge of
building a diverse community.
Incidents such as those that took
place in Otero and Ujamaa caused
many students great pain, while chal
lenging all of us to reexamine our
values and our expectations.
We at Stanford have a commitment
to diversity and to multicultural under
standing. Students here felt that Stan
ford should not allow discriminatory
harassment of students of color, gay
students or women students.
We therefore sought an institutional
commitment to this goal — and we
found the Fundamental Standard,
which reads, "Students at Stanford are
expected to show both within and
without the University such respect for
order, morality, personal honor and the
rights of others as is demanded of
good citizens."
Yet, when incidents of harassment
occurred in the dormitories, the admin
istration took no action to protect the
rights of students of color.
Obviously, we value the right to
freedom of speech. People, especially
people of color, have historically fought
and died for this right in the United

States. We understand the need to
allow all opinions to flourish in open
discussion so that minority views are
not suppressed.
So we struggle to come to terms
with difficult questions: What protec
tion do we guarantee students to be
free from harassment? What does
"freedom of speech" really mean and
how do we protect it at a university?
When does someone's right to speak
infringe on someone else's right to
speak and to equally participate in the
Stanford community?
After discussing this issue with
many students, the ASSU Senate, in
cluding a broad spectrum of views and
perspectives, voted unanimously to
support the modification of the Funda
mental Standard to explicitly state that
acts that attack students on the basis
of race, religion, gender or sexual ori
entation are violations of our code of
conduct.
We value the right of every Stanford
students to be a fully participating
member of the community. When a
slur or epithet is directed against
someone in a way that deprives his or
her right to freedom of speech and
equal educational opportunity, then
something is wrong.
The University must do something
to uphold these rights against discrimi
natory attacks and to educate students
so that these attacks do not happen in
the future.
Some have charged, however, that in
pursuit of this goal of maintaining a
diverse community, we are infringing
on the right to freedom of speech. We
do not believe ourselves to be in viola
tion of the First Amendment.
Many constitutional scholars have
explained that the Supreme Court has
never explicitly held racist and sexist
forms of speech to be protected under
the First Amendment. In fact, the Su
preme Court has implicitly ruled that
the First Amendment does not protect
racist and sexist forms of speech by
recognizing that such comments made
in the workplace alone constitute ille
gal discrimination. This is true even if

the comments are not addressed di
rectly at a particular individual, but
are pervasive and severe enough to
create a "hostile environment" in the
workplace.
Thus there are two values here —
freedom of speech and freedom from
harassment. Often in the concern over
the First Amendment, those advocating
the status quo have completely ignored
the need to protect students from at
tacks which have a silencing and chill
ing effect on their freedom of speech.
We as a community will not stand
for this type of discriminatory harass
ment. We believe that we can develop a
policy which guarantees all students
protection from harassment while still
insuring freedom of speech. Stanford
must prevent discriminatory actions
which hinder some from fully par
ticipating in the educational, social,
cultural or political life of Stanford
University, and must make a commit
ment to educate those who resort to
such actions.

American Indians
are a vital part
of this community
By omitting any mention at all of
American Indian Greg Sarris' impres
sive speech at the Spring Action '89
march on Sacramento back in April,
The Daily made a very painful mis
take. By failing to report the whole
story, The Daily demonstrated how

unaware the Stanford community is of
the Native American community here
on campus and in society.
We are not as numerous as other
parts of the community — there are
over 55 staff people, 100 students and
one faculty member. However, here we
are! We are very active on campus! We
bring speakers and other cultural
events to Stanford at our community
center and at the Native American
theme dorm — Lathrop House.
In fact, our community is the only
source of Native American cultural
activities and programming on campus.
The University provides no program
ming — only a couple of courses on
Native Americans.
The Annual Stanford Powwow,
which brings traditional Native Ameri
can culture and 12,000 people to
campus, is another example of our
contributions to the Stanford communi
ty-
In fact, I would also like to take this
opportunity to inform all readers about
the 18th Annual Powwow that will be
taking place this Friday, Saturday and
Sunday at the intramural athletic
fields near Maples Pavilion.
We invite you to come and enjoy the
richness of traditional Native American
dancing, singing, arts, crafts and food.
The Stanford Powwow is the biggest of
its kind on the West Coast, and it is a
long tradition of the Stanford Native
American community, and we are
proud to put it on.
It is a rare opportunity for people to
experience a part of the cultures and
people that were here before the Euro
peans came: the people who made and
continue to make a very significant
contribution to our country.
We would appreciate some recogni
tion of our existence and of the contri
bution that we make to the Stanford
community through the Powwow and
other events.

In fact, I would also like to take this
opportunity to inform all readers about
the 18th Annual Powwow that will be
taking place this Friday, Saturday and
Sunday at the intramural athletic
fields near Maples Pavilion.
We invite you to come and enjoy the
richness of traditional Native American
dancing, singing, arts, crafts and food.
The Stanford Powwow is the biggest of
its kind on the West Coast, and it is a
long tradition of the Stanford Native
American community, and we are
proud to put it on.
It is a rare opportunity for people to
experience a part of the cultures and
people that were here before the Euro
peans came: the people who made and
continue to make a very significant
contribution to our country.
We would appreciate some recogni
tion of our existence and of the contri
bution that we make to the Stanford
community through the Powwow and
other events.

Freedom of speech
has never implied
freedom to harass
In all of the concern over the spe
cific wording of the recent drafts of
the clarification of the Fundamental
Standard, we feel that the original
reason for the whole debate has been
lost.
Debates over terms such as "fighting
words" and "community standards,"
while important, have replaced discus
sion over how we can solve the real
problem: harassment of some students
in the dormitories. We hope that in
future weeks we can take on the issue
with renewed commitment, whatever
the specific course of our actions, so
that as a community we can move
forward to address the challenge of
building a diverse community.
Incidents such as those that took
place in Otero and Ujamaa caused
many students great pain, while chal
lenging all of us to reexamine our
values and our expectations.
We at Stanford have a commitment
to diversity and to multicultural under
standing. Students here felt that Stan
ford should not allow discriminatory
harassment of students of color, gay
students or women students.
We therefore sought an institutional
commitment to this goal — and we
found the Fundamental Standard,
which reads, "Students at Stanford are
expected to show both within and
without the University such respect for
order, morality, personal honor and the
rights of others as is demanded of
good citizens."
Yet, when incidents of harassment
occurred in the dormitories, the admin
istration took no action to protect the
rights of students of color.
Obviously, we value the right to
freedom of speech. People, especially
people of color, have historically fought
and died for this right in the United

States. We understand the need to
allow all opinions to flourish in open
discussion so that minority views are
not suppressed.
So we struggle to come to terms
with difficult questions: What protec
tion do we guarantee students to be
free from harassment? What does
"freedom of speech" really mean and
how do we protect it at a university?
When does someone's right to speak
infringe on someone else's right to
speak and to equally participate in the
Stanford community?
After discussing this issue with
many students, the ASSU Senate, in
cluding a broad spectrum of views and
perspectives, voted unanimously to
support the modification of the Funda
mental Standard to explicitly state that
acts that attack students on the basis
of race, religion, gender or sexual ori
entation are violations of our code of
conduct.
We value the right of every Stanford
students to be a fully participating
member of the community. When a
slur or epithet is directed against
someone in a way that deprives his or
her right to freedom of speech and
equal educational opportunity, then
something is wrong.
The University must do something
to uphold these rights against discrimi
natory attacks and to educate students
so that these attacks do not happen in
the future.
Some have charged, however, that in
pursuit of this goal of maintaining a
diverse community, we are infringing
on the right to freedom of speech. We
do not believe ourselves to be in viola
tion of the First Amendment.
Many constitutional scholars have
explained that the Supreme Court has
never explicitly held racist and sexist
forms of speech to be protected under
the First Amendment. In fact, the Su
preme Court has implicitly ruled that
the First Amendment does not protect
racist and sexist forms of speech by
recognizing that such comments made
in the workplace alone constitute ille
gal discrimination. This is true even if

the comments are not addressed di
rectly at a particular individual, but
are pervasive and severe enough to
create a "hostile environment" in the
workplace.
Thus there are two values here —
freedom of speech and freedom from
harassment. Often in the concern over
the First Amendment, those advocating
the status quo have completely ignored
the need to protect students from at
tacks which have a silencing and chill
ing effect on their freedom of speech.
We as a community will not stand
for this type of discriminatory harass
ment. We believe that we can develop a
policy which guarantees all students
protection from harassment while still
insuring freedom of speech. Stanford
must prevent discriminatory actions
which hinder some from fully par
ticipating in the educational, social,
cultural or political life of Stanford
University, and must make a commit
ment to educate those who resort to
such actions.

American Indians

By omitting any mention at all of
American Indian Greg Sarris' impres

march on Sacramento back in April,
The Daily made a very painful mis
take. By failing to report the whole
story, The Daily demonstrated how

unaware the Stanford community is of
the Native American community here
on campus and in society.
We are not as numerous as other
parts of the community — there are
over 55 staff people, 100 students and
one faculty member. However, here we
are! We are very active on campus! We
bring speakers and other cultural
events to Stanford at our community
center and at the Native American
theme dorm — Lathrop House.
In fact, our community is the only
source of Native American cultural
activities and programming on campus.
The University provides no program
ming — only a couple of courses on
Native Americans.
