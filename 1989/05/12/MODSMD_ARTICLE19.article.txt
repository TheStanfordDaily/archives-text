## An (ex)superpower fades 
### 
WE ARE ENTERING a dangerous
era in international relations.
The United States' power ca
pabilities have been declining since the
Vietnam War while West Germany and
Japan are returning to their once confi
dent positions in the international polit
ical order.
What has been called the decline of
the U.S. empire provides an opportunity
for chauvinistic pontifications about the
good old days, when the United States
muscled around like King Kong in a china
shop.
That is not what this column is about.
The United States must accept the new
world order, give recognition to new
powers and at the same time tone down
its role in the world.
For better or worse the United States
no longer holds all the cards. One of the
concepts I learned in Political Science 35
was that periods of flux in power capa
bilities present dangerous opportunities
for conflict.
If the United States continues to try
to push other nations around, other na
tions will increasingly push back in an
aggressive manner.
Both leaders and citizens in our coun
try need to experience a fundamental
change in world view if we are to continue
living in peace.
The realization is beginning to dawn
in the United States that we are but one
element in a complex world system. The
"national interests" of the United States
will no longer be an overriding determin
ing factor in international politics.
Less flexing of muscle and more will

ingness to negotiate pragmatic com
promises should be forthcoming from
Washington.
The United States must be willing to
accomodate the desires of rising nations
that want influence commensurate with
their power.
And it seems our government may
indeed be tempering its rhetoric.
But what many people and nations
don't seem to realize is that less respon
sibilities go hand in hand with less power.
Especially with regards to economics, the
United States is no longer the world
leader.
For the past 40 years, the United States
has kept the international economic sys
tem running relatively smoothly with
generous applications of dollars when
required.
When developing countries sought
foreign economic aid, they looked to the
United States. When Europe needed
money to rebuild after the war, it was
the United States that footed the bill.
When disaster struck around the world,
nations looked to the United States for
relief.
Well, the doors are closed and the cof
fers empty.
Japan and West Germany are the new
economic superpowers, and they had bet
ter jump into the shoes the United States
once filled, perhaps in a less bombastic
way, and keep the system alive.
U.S. citizens must realize that the pres
tige accorded the United States in the
international system will eventually fade.
They also must realize that we can no
longer afford to support economic reform

around the world.
Countries like Poland, in which
profound possibilities for change do exist,
are still looking to the United States to
ease the path to reform with dollars.
The tack the Bush administration took,
combining verbal support with modest
economic awards, is a good model for
future policy. We must lend moral support
to positive change around the world, but
the free-and-easy spending must stop.
The United States very directly paid
to create a stable international system
that other nations have found very lucra
tive. It's time other nations take the lead
and let us drift for a while and catch our
breath.
The danger is that the United States
will step from the spotlight and no one
else will step forward to carry the tune.
The post-war system has required guid
ance and shock therapy at times.
And the danger remains that the
United States will refuse to allow the
new superpowers to satiate their desire
for muscle-flexing. In the past, the in
ternational system has utilized wars to
shuffle the pecking order of nations.
It is unclear whether nations have out
grown this playground mentality.
