## Training future Bridge peer counselors: D'Andrea stresses 'personal learning' 
### Paula Gani Staff writer 
As Medical School Prof. Vin
cent D'Andrea leans back in the
leather chair at his desk in the
Houston House counseling
room, it is easy to envision the
psychiatrist, the intellectual in
him. Yet, something in his spar
kling Italian eyes and fully
bearded face evokes a fatherly
image that makes students want
to reach out to him.

D'Andrea, a clinical psychia
trist, first came to Stanford in
the late 1950s as a resident at
the Stanford Medical School. A
little over a decade later, he was
part of a group of faculty and
students who founded The
Bridge.
The Bridge, a 24-hour coun
seling center, originally opened
in 1971 as a drug abuse center.
According to D'Andrea, it had
been the students who "were
really the energy for the place."
Now the associate director of
Student Health Services,
D'Andrea teaches Psychology
167 A, a course which trains stu
dents to be Bridge peer coun
selors.
D'Andrea emphasizes the im
portance of personal growth as
part of the learning process.

"College mental health is differ
ent from regular counseling
services," he explains. "Students
are young men and women going
through a lot of rapid changes
. . . social learning, personal
learning."
According to D'Andrea, this
type of learning goes hand-in
hand with intellectual learning.
"We (The Bridge and Counseling
and Psychological Services) feel
we're part of the educational
mission of the University."
D'Andrea carries his "personal
learning" concept into his own
life. "I have a lot of other inter
ests," he says. These include
music, art and literature â€” in
terests "one develops from being
educated," muses D'Andrea.
A lifelong interest in writing
and collecting poetry led to
D'Andrea's recently published
collection "Palimsest," a volume
including self-reflections and
several cantos sprinkled with
Italian phrases.
D'Andrea also pursues a
"serious hobby of winemaking"
as a member of the Stanford
Amateur Winemakers, and takes
time out to work on restoring
antique cars.
"I think it's really important
for people who do a lot of intel
lectual work to have an outlet
to do things with their hands,
real things," says D' Andrea. He
advises people to pursue their
special interests as an "antidote
to things in the head."
