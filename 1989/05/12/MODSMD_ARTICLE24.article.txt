# Bug inspects shorts at volleyball games
## 
### Mark Smoyer Senior staff writer 
Hi, and welcome to this week's
Bug Me. 1 have little space today,
which is A-OK with me.
Dear Bug,
Why docs the women's volleyball
team wear such small, tight shorts
and long sleeves, while the bas
ketball team wears big, baggy
shorts and no sleeves?
— Davy Crockett
A corollary question, but a far
more stupid one, would be, "Why
does women's volleyball tradition
ally get bigger crowds at Maples
Pavilion than men's volleyball?"
The Bug really has no idea. He's
got too much faith in the strong
moral character of our nation's
collegiate men to believe they
would go to volleyball games just
to see women jump around in
their underwear.
The embarrassing uniforms
have their origin overseas, accord
ing to Cardinal volleyball coach
Don Shaw. Shaw said they first
became a part of the Stanford
outfit in 1984, simply because the
company which equipped the
team with its uniforms adopted
that style.
Shaw noted that in many other
countries women's basketball
players also wear those shorts,
called buns.
Of the way the players feel
about wearing such unforgiving

uniforms, Shaw said, "They're
probably a little self-conscious at
first," and then assured the Bug,
"I really don't know, never having
worn them myself."
Team captain Laura Olesen
first wore buns for a club team
during high school. "It was really
emharrassing," Olesen said. "I felt
like I was wearing diapers."
Olesen's roommate, Cheri Den
nison, commented, "I think all
guys should have to walk around
in buns for a day or two and then
dive on the ground and roll
around with a volleyball."
Until next week, the Bun has
spoken.
