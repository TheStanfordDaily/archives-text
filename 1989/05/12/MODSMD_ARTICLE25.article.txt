## Netters cruise to 9-0 triumph over San Diego St. 
### Mark Rogowsky Editorial staff 
GAINESVILLE, Fla. -
Heading into the NCAA Women's
Tennis Championships, many ob
servers viewed the Stanford Car
dinal as an overwhelming, per
haps even invincible, favorite.
Yesterday's 9-0 win over the
San Diego State Aztecs — includ
ing seven straight-set victories —
did nothing to dispel that notion.
The win moved the Cardinal to
26-0 and set up a quarterfinal
matchup with Oklahoma State

Women's Tennis
Cardinal 9, Aztecs 0

this morning.
The 24-6 Cowgirls, seeded
eighth in the tournament, ad
vanced by defeating Brigham
Young 7-2.
Considering that Stanford had
already shut out San Diego State
twice this year, it would've been
easy for the Cardinal to let down.
Instead, they poured it on.

"I don't think we were overcon
fident," Coach Frank Brennan
said. "Everybody's going to be
tough (at NCAAs)."
That everybody includes Stan
ford, though, and the Cardinal
was tough indeed.
Ten Whitlinger, who has been
red hot lately, finished her singles
match first with a 6-1, 6-1 pasting
of Eva Olivarez.
"I feel really good about the
way I've been playing," Whitlinger
said. "I feel confident and I'm
having fun (on the court)."
Lisa Green, Debbie Graham and

Sandra Birch were nearly as im
pressive.
In matches ending within
minutes of each other, Green
knocked off Dorey Brandt 6-0, 6-
3; Graham buried Jessica Buss by
the same score; and Birch
thumped Kristin Hill 6-3, 6-2.
But the best news for Stanford
was yet to come. Tami Whitlinger
and Kylie Johnson, the Cardinal's
No. 1 and No. 6 players respec
tively, have both been mired in
confidence crises of late. Yester
day's results went a long way to
ending those crises.
Whitlinger said her troubles
began when her season-long win
ning streak was broken by Cali
fornia's Karen Shin a month ago.
"I started playing to avoid losing,"
she said. "Instead of going for the
big shot, [I was] just getting the
ball back.
"You can't win that way," she
added.
Today, Whitlinger was anything
but tentative, however. "Because
I didn't play last year (an injury
kept her out of the NCAAs), I
was so excited going into this,"
Whitlinger said.
Perhaps the excitement kept
Whitlinger's mind off her
troubles, for she pulled out to a
quick 5-1 lead over Sondra
Mitchell and ended up winning
the first set 6-2.
In the second set, Whitlinger
began to play even better. Her
forehand was superb and she

seemed very focused on the
match. In closing out Mitchell
with a 6-1 second-set victory,
Whitlinger looked like she did a
month ago.
"[lt's] back to the old Tami,"
she said.
Said Brennan: "That was really
good for her to go out and win
handily." About her confidence,
he added jokingly, "She seemed
to get a little bit of that Minnesota
swagger back." (Whitlinger, in
cidentally, is from Wisconsin.)
Johnson, on the other hand,

was battling her injured right
knee and what she described as
off-the-court distractions. She
tore some cartilage in the knee a
few weeks back and has run tenta
tively since.
"It's hard not to think about
the knee," Johnson said. "I hqrt
it again yesterday when I was hit
ting with L.G. (Green)."
But Johnson suggested her
"problem was mental. I was think
ing about tennis but everything
else was bothering me," she said.
Before she knew it, Johnson
had lost the first set to Michelle
Apra and was behind 3-0 in the
second. Then the match took a
180-degree turn.
Said Johnson: "I tried to block
everything out of my mind, which
is what I've got to do more of."
If the results are similar to yes
terday's, she should do more of
whatever it is she did.
Why? Because with her back to
the wall, Johnson took over the
match. She began to move Apra
around and, at Brennan's recom
mendation, began to pick on her
forehand. When all was said and
done, Johnson had captured 12
of the last 14 games to win the
match 3-6, 6-4, 6-1.
The good news continued for
Stanford in the doubles. The
Whitlingers rebounded from their
worst loss in recent history a week



Ken Beer — Daily *le
Freshman Debbie Graham coasted to a win at No. 4 singles yesterday, defeating San Diego State's
Jessica Buss 6-0, 6-3.
ago to post a 6-4, 6-3 win over
Hill and Brandt.
"Tami and Teri played very
well," Brennan said. "They had a
lot of high fives ... a high five's
worth two points," he joked.
At No. 2 doubles, Graham and
Birch buried Buss and Mitchell
6-4, 6-0. In that match, Graham
hit a down-the-line forehand win
ner that left observers agape.
Many felt it was as hard a shot
as they had ever seen in women's
tennis — at any level.
Green finally got a chance to
play with Eleni Rossides again at
No. 3 doubles. The duo was up
and down early but look especially

strong in the third set. They han
dled Susan Hawke and Claire
Bateman 6-2, 2-6, 6-2.
Card notes
Should Stanford defeat OSU, the
team will play the winner of the
California-Georgia Match tomorrow
in the semifinals.
Georgia is riding a 16-match win
ning streak. The Bulldogs No. 5
player, Jill Waldman has won 22
straight.
California came closer to beating
Stanford than anyone but Florida.
The Bears No. 1 player Shin has the
only two dual-match victories over
Tami Whitlinger all season.
So, Tami, you'd rather skip Cali
fornia?
"No," she said.
Revenge?
"Yes."
