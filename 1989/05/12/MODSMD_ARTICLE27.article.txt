# Paulsen isn't short about position changes
## 
### Bruce Sarkisian Senior staff writer 
If Troy Paulsen's baseball career doesn't
work out he could always get a job with
United Van Lines. He doesn't seem to mind
moving around at all.
Coming off an All-Pacific 10 Conference
Southern Division season at shortstop last
year, Paulsen has started at four different
positions this year: short, second base, left
field and right field. And he has handled
every one like he had been playing there
hi 9 whole life.
For example, take the game April 9 at
Arizona State. With Sun Devil catcher Dave
Robson on second, shortstop Anthony
Manahan singled to left. Paulsen instinc
tively charged the hall and threw a bullet
to Eric Cox at home to save a run.
"He's adjusted to the outfield well be
cause he's such a great athlete. What im
presses me most is that he has done what
ever it takes to help the team," Frank
Carey, the Cardinal second baseman, said.
Indeed, even at the plate, Paulsen has
taken matters into his own hands more
than once, with two game-winning home
runs coming in the late innings. As a result,
ironically, Paulsen's average has suffered
this year.
"I've been anxious a lot this year because
I'm looking for a pitch inside that I can
pull out of the park. With two strikes, I'm
looking for a pitch in a certain location
and that's wrong," Paulsen said.
The great thing about Paulsen is that
he is so versatile in the field and at the
plate. All Stanford Coach Mark Marquess
has to do is ask, and Paulsen delivers.
His freshman year, Paulsen was inserted
as a pinch hitter early in the season at
Fullerton State and he hit a home run. It
was only his third collegiate at bat.
After that game, he started the next six
games of the season, but in the sixth one,
at UC-Santa Barbara, he was running out
a sacrifice bunt and his knee "just flat
gave out."
The iryury forced Paulsen to have arthro
scopic surgery and sit out the rest of the
season. He watched his teammates win the
College World Series on ESPN. "I got
burned on a chance to go to the World

Series," he said.
The next year, however, Paulsen got his
chance and ran with it. He put together
one of the best seasons ever by a Stanford
player, including a school-record 28-game
hitting streak.
Paulsen's numbers for the season were
pretty astounding: a .342 batting average,
52 RBI and a school-record 22 doubles.
"What I'll remember most about him is
the amazing season he had last year,"
Carey said.
Unfortunately, this year has generally
been a disappointment for the Cardinal
utility man. "1 usually don't set goals for
myself, but I just wanted to be better in
all statistics than last year. I've got to
wonder where we'd be if 1 even hit .300
this year," Paulsen said.
With just two games left in the season,
Paulsen's numbers are way below his 1988
figures: a .267 batting average, 33 RBI and
only seven stolen bases.
year hurt me in that it makes this
year all the more frustrating because 1
know that I can play so much better,"
Paulsen said.
Like the Cardinal, however, Paulsen is
enjoying a late-season surge. He had a
season-high six-game hitting streak
snapped against California, but has hit
safely in 13 of his last 16 games with two
home runs and 10 RBI.
"The key to hitting well is being com
fortable in the box. If you're not, that's a
big strike against you.
"If I'm going well, they can throw that
first fastball in for a strike or a curveball

After an outstanding season last year, Troy Paulsen has struggled at the plate,
hlttlnq 267, but has contributed significantly on defense
in for a strike and I'll think 'Fine,
anything he throws up there over
the plate now I'll hit,' " Paulsen
said.
When the Cardinal's back is to
the wall, Paulsen always seems to
come through. Last year in the
NCAA Northeast Regional, the
Cardinal was one game from elim
ination when playing Kentucky. In
that game, Paulsen came through
for a home run and six RBI that
carried the Cardinal into the Col
lege World Series.
"I would like people to think
that I wasn't exceptional in any
one area, but I did a solid job. If

we needed a runner moved over
I moved him over, and I played
good | defense] when we needed
it," Paulsen said.
But he has done much more
than that. He has been one of the
stabilizing forces in a Cardinal
lineup that has been anything but
concrete this season. No matter
where he plays, Paulsen makes it
look easy. He has not committed
an error in 37 games.
In the clubhouse, he has also
been the consummate team
player. "His attitude has helped
the team a lot. He proved he was
a good shortstop last year and
when he got moved around it
could have caused tension. But
Troy has been great and I think
that says a lot about what kind
of a guy he is," Carey said.

stabilizing forces in a Cardinal
lineup that has been anything but
concrete this season. No matter
where he plays, Paulsen makes it
look easy. He has not committed
an error in 37 games.
In the clubhouse, he has also
been the consummate team
player. "His attitude has helped
the team a lot. He proved he was
a good shortstop last year and
when he got moved around it
could have caused tension. But
Troy has been great and I think
that says a lot about what kind
of a guy he is," Carey said.
If Troy Paulsen's baseball career doesn't
work out he could always get a job with
United Van Lines. He doesn't seem to mind
moving around at all.
Coming off an All-Pacific 10 Conference
Southern Division season at shortstop last
year, Paulsen has started at four different
positions this year: short, second base, left
field and right field. And he has handled
every one like he had been playing there
hi 9 whole life.
For example, take the game April 9 at
Arizona State. With Sun Devil catcher Dave
Robson on second, shortstop Anthony
Manahan singled to left. Paulsen instinc
tively charged the hall and threw a bullet
to Eric Cox at home to save a run.
"He's adjusted to the outfield well be
cause he's such a great athlete. What im
presses me most is that he has done what
ever it takes to help the team," Frank
Carey, the Cardinal second baseman, said.
Indeed, even at the plate, Paulsen has
taken matters into his own hands more
than once, with two game-winning home
runs coming in the late innings. As a result,
ironically, Paulsen's average has suffered
this year.
"I've been anxious a lot this year because
I'm looking for a pitch inside that I can
pull out of the park. With two strikes, I'm
looking for a pitch in a certain location
and that's wrong," Paulsen said.
The great thing about Paulsen is that
he is so versatile in the field and at the
plate. All Stanford Coach Mark Marquess
has to do is ask, and Paulsen delivers.
His freshman year, Paulsen was inserted
as a pinch hitter early in the season at
Fullerton State and he hit a home run. It
was only his third collegiate at bat.
After that game, he started the next six
games of the season, but in the sixth one,
at UC-Santa Barbara, he was running out
a sacrifice bunt and his knee "just flat
gave out."
The iryury forced Paulsen to have arthro
scopic surgery and sit out the rest of the
season. He watched his teammates win the
College World Series on ESPN. "I got
burned on a chance to go to the World

Series," he said.
The next year, however, Paulsen got his
chance and ran with it. He put together
one of the best seasons ever by a Stanford
player, including a school-record 28-game
hitting streak.
Paulsen's numbers for the season were
pretty astounding: a .342 batting average,
52 RBI and a school-record 22 doubles.
"What I'll remember most about him is
the amazing season he had last year,"
Carey said.
Unfortunately, this year has generally
been a disappointment for the Cardinal
utility man. "1 usually don't set goals for
myself, but I just wanted to be better in
all statistics than last year. I've got to
wonder where we'd be if 1 even hit .300
this year," Paulsen said.
With just two games left in the season,
Paulsen's numbers are way below his 1988
figures: a .267 batting average, 33 RBI and
only seven stolen bases.
year hurt me in that it makes this
year all the more frustrating because 1
know that I can play so much better,"
Paulsen said.
Like the Cardinal, however, Paulsen is
enjoying a late-season surge. He had a
season-high six-game hitting streak
snapped against California, but has hit
safely in 13 of his last 16 games with two
home runs and 10 RBI.
"The key to hitting well is being com
fortable in the box. If you're not, that's a
big strike against you.
"If I'm going well, they can throw that
first fastball in for a strike or a curveball

After an outstanding season last year, Troy Paulsen has struggled at the plate,
hlttlnq 267, but has contributed significantly on defense
in for a strike and I'll think 'Fine,
anything he throws up there over
the plate now I'll hit,' " Paulsen
said.
When the Cardinal's back is to
the wall, Paulsen always seems to
come through. Last year in the
NCAA Northeast Regional, the
Cardinal was one game from elim
ination when playing Kentucky. In
that game, Paulsen came through
for a home run and six RBI that
carried the Cardinal into the Col
lege World Series.
"I would like people to think
that I wasn't exceptional in any
one area, but I did a solid job. If

we needed a runner moved over
