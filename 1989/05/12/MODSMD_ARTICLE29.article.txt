# Evans overshadows netters; former Card Ballard excels
## 
### 
Yesterday was one of the most hectic
and electric days for the Stanford Ath
letic Department. With Janet Evans
; signing a letter of intent to join the NCAA
-champion women's swimming team, the En
cina Gym-Athletic Department complex was
buzzing with excitement.
In fact, with all the hoopla and phone
..calls about Evans, the women's tennis
achievement earlier in the day at
NCAAs was all but eclipsed. The Cardinal
_routed San Diego State 9-0, which is really
not that much of a surprise since Stanford
entered the tournament seeded first and the
Aztecs were unseeded.
Stanford had previously steamrolled San
Diego State 9-0 and 6-0, dropping nary a
' set. Thus, the 9-0 win was not all that
• significant compared to signing one of the
Igreatest swimmers in U.S. history.
But once the enthusiasm over Evans
wanes, the true importance of today's match
..may crawl to the surface in the form of an
NCAA title. Contrary to appearances, this
was a key contest.
Here's the thinking behind this:
1. This is a single elimination tournament.
Stanford was not eliminated.
2. The score was 9-0; not 8-1, 7-2 or 6-3,
but 9-0. To further insult readers' intelli
gence, this means that Stanford did not lose
a match in doubles.
Doubles, however, represent Stanford's
Achilles' heel and the only realistic weakness
for an upstart team to exploit. After crush
ing so many squads in singles, doubles have
been lackadaisical matches for most of the
year.
' For this reason, it is comforting to know
that the Cardinal was able to follow a jug
gernaut in singles with a strong doubles
showing. With renewed confidence in their
doubles ability, the players have gained some

momentum entering the more difficult
matches.
Incidentally, here are Inside Edge's pre
dictions for the pertinent parts of the tour
nament: Stanford over Oklahoma State 9-0
and Georgia over California 5-4 today, Stan
ford over Georgia 7-2 Saturday and Stanford
over Florida 6-3 (or better) on Sunday for
the title.
From the imminent title to the elusive,
it's time for men's volleyball and a
little dose of perspective. For all in
tents and purposes, Stanford has been
celebrating its NCAA runner-up finish for
a week.
By qualifying for the final match, the
Cardinal had already won. UCLA, with their
home court advantage and two-week vaca
tion before the Final Four, was the true
favorite by a large margin.
The teams were even all season long, but
it would have been a Herculean feat for
Stanford to whisk the championship away
from the Bruins, who had probably already
cleared space in their trophy case for their
13th piece of hardware well before the

opening serve.
Officially, UCLA is the national champion.
Realistically, Stanford had the finest season
of any team in the country, surpassing the
label of "a team with great potential" to
become a championship contender.
Now the really good news: recruiting. Fol
lowing what has been called the recruiting
class of the decade, Cardinal Coach Fred
Sturm has landed a trio talented enough to
boost Stanford over the top.
The three incoming freshmen — hitter
Jimmy Klein (brother of Stanford women's
volleyball Ail-American Kristin Klein), All-
America setter Jimmy Blackman (no rela
tion to teammates Duncan and Parker
Blackman) and hitter Frank Clark (familial
relations unknown) — will round out a
roster losing but two seniors to graduation.
Blackman is the key recruit. At 6-foot-3,
he is one of the tallest setters in Stanford
history and will therefore satisfy a con
spicuous need. Moreover, with the best set
ter in the country, Matt Sonnichsen of
UCLA, graduating, the Bruins' edge for the
past four years has evaporated.
Things look good for the Cardinal next
year. We'll keep you posted.

Gary Migdol: Jeff Ballard has become
one of the Cardinal's more successful ath
letic alums.
Yesterday afternoon, Ballard faced an un
defeated Dave Stewart of the A's. The Bal
timore starter was 5-1 before the game and
the first Oriole in 25 years to win his first
five starts; Stewart was 6-0.
True to fashion, Ballard chalked up an
other win. The American League's Pitcher
of the Month in April, Ballard has only
improved since his graduation in 1985.

one of the Cardinal's more successful ath
letic alums.
Yesterday afternoon, Ballard faced an un
defeated Dave Stewart of the A's. The Bal
timore starter was 5-1 before the game and
the first Oriole in 25 years to win his first
five starts; Stewart was 6-0.
True to fashion, Ballard chalked up an
other win. The American League's Pitcher
of the Month in April, Ballard has only
improved since his graduation in 1985.

Yesterday was one of the most hectic
and electric days for the Stanford Ath
letic Department. With Janet Evans
; signing a letter of intent to join the NCAA
-champion women's swimming team, the En
cina Gym-Athletic Department complex was
buzzing with excitement.
In fact, with all the hoopla and phone
..calls about Evans, the women's tennis
achievement earlier in the day at
NCAAs was all but eclipsed. The Cardinal
_routed San Diego State 9-0, which is really
not that much of a surprise since Stanford
entered the tournament seeded first and the
Aztecs were unseeded.
Stanford had previously steamrolled San
Diego State 9-0 and 6-0, dropping nary a
' set. Thus, the 9-0 win was not all that
• significant compared to signing one of the
Igreatest swimmers in U.S. history.
But once the enthusiasm over Evans
wanes, the true importance of today's match
..may crawl to the surface in the form of an
NCAA title. Contrary to appearances, this
was a key contest.
Here's the thinking behind this:
1. This is a single elimination tournament.
Stanford was not eliminated.
2. The score was 9-0; not 8-1, 7-2 or 6-3,
but 9-0. To further insult readers' intelli
gence, this means that Stanford did not lose
a match in doubles.
Doubles, however, represent Stanford's
Achilles' heel and the only realistic weakness
for an upstart team to exploit. After crush
ing so many squads in singles, doubles have
been lackadaisical matches for most of the
year.
' For this reason, it is comforting to know
that the Cardinal was able to follow a jug
gernaut in singles with a strong doubles
showing. With renewed confidence in their
doubles ability, the players have gained some

momentum entering the more difficult
matches.
Incidentally, here are Inside Edge's pre
dictions for the pertinent parts of the tour
nament: Stanford over Oklahoma State 9-0
and Georgia over California 5-4 today, Stan
ford over Georgia 7-2 Saturday and Stanford
over Florida 6-3 (or better) on Sunday for
the title.
From the imminent title to the elusive,
it's time for men's volleyball and a
little dose of perspective. For all in
tents and purposes, Stanford has been
celebrating its NCAA runner-up finish for
a week.
By qualifying for the final match, the
Cardinal had already won. UCLA, with their
home court advantage and two-week vaca
tion before the Final Four, was the true
favorite by a large margin.
The teams were even all season long, but
it would have been a Herculean feat for
Stanford to whisk the championship away
from the Bruins, who had probably already
cleared space in their trophy case for their
13th piece of hardware well before the

opening serve.
Officially, UCLA is the national champion.
Realistically, Stanford had the finest season
of any team in the country, surpassing the
label of "a team with great potential" to
become a championship contender.
Now the really good news: recruiting. Fol
lowing what has been called the recruiting
class of the decade, Cardinal Coach Fred
Sturm has landed a trio talented enough to
boost Stanford over the top.
The three incoming freshmen — hitter
Jimmy Klein (brother of Stanford women's
volleyball Ail-American Kristin Klein), All-
America setter Jimmy Blackman (no rela
tion to teammates Duncan and Parker
Blackman) and hitter Frank Clark (familial
relations unknown) — will round out a
roster losing but two seniors to graduation.
Blackman is the key recruit. At 6-foot-3,
he is one of the tallest setters in Stanford
history and will therefore satisfy a con
spicuous need. Moreover, with the best set
ter in the country, Matt Sonnichsen of
UCLA, graduating, the Bruins' edge for the
past four years has evaporated.
Things look good for the Cardinal next
year. We'll keep you posted.
Just a note in passing, courtesy of Stan
ford Sports Information Co-Director
Gary Migdol: Jeff Ballard has become
one of the Cardinal's more successful ath
letic alums.
Yesterday afternoon, Ballard faced an un
defeated Dave Stewart of the A's. The Bal
timore starter was 5-1 before the game and
the first Oriole in 25 years to win his first
five starts; Stewart was 6-0.
True to fashion, Ballard chalked up an
other win. The American League's Pitcher
