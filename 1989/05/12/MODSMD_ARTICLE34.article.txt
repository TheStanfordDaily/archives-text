# 'I'm at a transition point in my life anyway'

### Elizabeth Howton Bob Michitarian Editorial staff 
For "Shana," coming out has
not meant any declarations of
long-repressed secrets, but rather
a growing awareness of herself as
a person with the capacity to love
both men and women.
"[Coming out] has been easier
than I thought. ... I thought it
would be a big, dark time of sor
row in my life, but it's a time of
discovery. ... I'm surprised how
good it's been. It feels good to me
to finally be honest about these
things."
Dreams about women
Shana, a senior from a large
Western city, didn't consciously
think she might be gay until her
junior year at Stanford. She had
a boyfriend for about a year and
a half, but she would sometimes

have "very physical dreams about
women," and began to think she
might be bisexual.
"I tried to put it out of my
mind, but I felt like I had to talk
to someone about it. ... I told a
friend, and she said, 'Oh, don't
think that just because things
aren't going well with [Shana's
boyfriend]. Don't worry about it.'
"What really made me start
going to GLAS stuff was that I
had a crush on a woman. . . . That
was more intense than anything
I'd ever felt for a woman before.
For a while I thought she might
like me in that way, but it turned
out she's straight. I didn't want
to tell her I had a crush on her
when I didn't even know how I
felt about it myself."
'Not a big deal'
"It's sort of bad timing, because
I'm graduating, to finally be
dealing with this. . . but it's also

a good time because I'm at a tran
sition point in my life anyway,"
says Shana.
Recently, one of Shana's friends
told her she was bisexual. "I was
surprised, because she'd been
going out with a guy for a long
time, but when I told her I was
bi too, she was even more sur
prised," Shana says.
Through her friend, Shana
found out about a support group
at Counseling and Psychological
Services for lesbian and bisexual
women that she began attending
at the beginning of this quarter.
Although she has come out to
the straight friends "that 1
thought would be open to it,"
Shana doesn't feel ready to tell
many people at this point, partly
because she's so close to gradua
tion.
She says, "I'm open to a rela
tionship with a woman — for the
first time in my life I really could

have one. ... I don't think it
should have to be such a big deal.
If I were in a loving relationship
with a woman, I'd want to tell
people."
Shana, who has not yet gone
out with a woman, says she
"would like my next relationship
to be with a woman, but if I met
a great man, I wouldn't say no.
. . . But it's scary to think, what
if I like it a lot? The concept of
being lesbian is scarier than being
bisexual to me, and I think it
would be harder.
"There are probably a lot of
[bisexual] people like me who
wonder sometimes but don't take
any action because they don't
need to — but in a way that's
ignoring a part of yourself.
"I think being bisexual is more
natural than being either gay or
straight. It makes sense to me —
but maybe I'm biased."
