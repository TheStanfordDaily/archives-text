# Anti-gay graffiti mars GALA Week
## 
### Baldwin Lee Staff writer 
Anti-gay graffiti like "Goodbye
gays, hello AIDS" appeared
scrawled in chalk at more than
five campus sites yesterday morn
ing, an apparent response to
chalkings supporting the gay
community which were written
earlier this week in the same
areas.
Tom Henning, a member of the
Lesbian Gay Bisexual Community
Center, said he was upset at the
violent and negative nature of the
graffiti, which included "Go back
in the closet" and "Kill gays."
Henning said the graffiti — ap
pearing at Meyer Library, the

Post Office, White Plaza, Tresid
der Union, the Bookstore and
some engineering buildings — has
a similar effect on the gay com
munity as swastikas would have
on the Jewish community.
A witness, Petros Levounis, a
Medical School student who called
The Daily early yesterday morn
ing said he saw three males writ
ing with chalk in front of the Post
Office Wednesday night just after
midnight. The three, one of whom
was distinguishable by a large
sombrero, finished writing "No
butt-fuckers" and left when they
saw the witness at a distance.

of several found around campus.
