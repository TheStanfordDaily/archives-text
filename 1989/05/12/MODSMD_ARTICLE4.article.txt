# Anti-gay graffiti mars GALA Week
## 
### Baldwin Lee Staff writer 
Anti-gay graffiti like "Goodbye
gays, hello AIDS" appeared
scrawled in chalk at more than
five campus sites yesterday morn
ing, an apparent response to
chalkings supporting the gay
community which were written
earlier this week in the same
areas.
Tom Henning, a member of the
Lesbian Gay Bisexual Community
Center, said he was upset at the
violent and negative nature of the
graffiti, which included "Go back
in the closet" and "Kill gays."
Henning said the graffiti — ap
pearing at Meyer Library, the

Post Office, White Plaza, Tresid
der Union, the Bookstore and
some engineering buildings — has
a similar effect on the gay com
munity as swastikas would have
on the Jewish community.
A witness, Petros Levounis, a
Medical School student who called
The Daily early yesterday morn
ing said he saw three males writ
ing with chalk in front of the Post
Office Wednesday night just after
midnight. The three, one of whom
was distinguishable by a large
sombrero, finished writing "No
butt-fuckers" and left when they
saw the witness at a distance.

This anti-gay graffiti was scrawled on the steps of Meyer Library. The derogatory message was one
of several found around campus.
Judicial Affairs Officer Sally
Cole said yesterday that she
hadn't been informed about the
situation.
Senior Bobbi Bernstein, a mem
ber of the gay and lesbian com
munity, said, "The messages show
not everyone is welcome here. . . .
Messages like 'kill gays' show that
homophobia is a real threat to
students, and not just (a) pro
heterosexual [stance]."
Bernstein, who drew some of
the chalkings supporting the gay
community, said her graffiti, writ
ten between Sunday and Wednes
day night, was not sponsored by
Gay and Lesbian Awareness
Week-4t- was done in the jpirit
of the week by people of all sexual
orientations, she said.
She said the original graffiti
was not imposing or threatening
to heterosexuality. The messages
included statements like "We are
everywhere," or declared the
homosexuality of a sibling.
Other original chalkings in
cluded interlinking identical bio

logical sex symbols and slogans
like "Gay pride."
According to Harvey Portillo, a
Stanford paint shop employee, a
fellow worker and he were as
signed at 10 a.m. yesterday to re
move both the anti- and pro-gay
chalk messages after a request by
Susan Perry, chief librarian at
Meyer.
Portillo said the chalk was
easily removed with water, but
that water was difficult to acquire
and transport to the sites. Due to
the difficulty of getting water,
Portillo said he concentrated on
removing the anti-gay messages
first.
By 5 p.m. yesterday all the anti
gay messages had been removed.
Despite the anti-gay messages'
initial negative impact, Bernstein
said the messages may result in
some positive effect. She said it
is good to reveal the significant
homophobia that lies behind Stan
ford's image as an open-minded
community.
"I know homophobia abounds,
but I still find it really amazing
that people find it so threatening
that we are comfortable with our
sexuality," Bernstein said.
