# Students of Color rally, present revised demands
## 
### Sophia Shing Staff writer 
Rallying on the steps of Old Union yes
terday, about 150 members and supporters
of the Students of Color Coalition presented
an "Agenda for Action" consisting of revi
sions of demands nailed on University Pres
ident Donald Kennedy's door in October.
The noon ralliers chanted, "Self
determination for our education," and
demanded immediate University attention
to issues ranging from the hiring of a ten
ure track Asian-American history professor
to an increased budget for such under
graduate programs as Human Biology, the
C-hicano Fellows and International Rela
tions.
After receiving a copy of the coalition's
demands, Kennedy refused the coalition's
request for a meeting today.
Responding late yesterday in a letter,
Kennedy said he would not meet with the
students immediately because he plans to
deal with the issues raised by the coalition
at the May 18 meeting of the Academic
Council. He added that his schedule was
"already fuller than full" today and thus
he could not meet with coalition leaders
anyway.
The Agenda for Action differs from Oc
tober's Mandate for Change in two
respects. The agenda calls for establishment
of a discrimination grievances board to
review incidents of racial and other har
assment on campus. It asks the University
to hire more teaching assistants in order
to decrease class size.
At the rally, freshman Vince Ricci, speak
ing for the ASSU's Committee on Democ
racy in Education, said, "We do not seek
new administration committees to investi
gate these issues. We seek action. We
demand improvements."
Ricci asked students to question whether

Stanford benefits when "we lose many of
our most popular and qualified ethnic
studies instructors to other colleges be
cause Stanford doesn't offer positions for
them."
"We are constantly hearing from the ad
ministration about how they are working
hard to increase minority faculty here at
Stanford, but we have yet to see actions
that truly demonstrate this to us," added
MEChA member Leticia Valadez.
Describing his feelings as "irate, upset,
concerned and disgusted," senior William
McCabe, member of the Stanford American
Indian Organization, asked the adminis
tration to explain to him why the Univer
sity could afford new parking structures
and landscaping yet not be able to afford
any kind of support for American Indians
on campus.
"It is obvious that Stanford University
is growing and planning for the future
influx of a new generation of brighter, more
eager students. Why does it seem that we
are not a part of this plan?" McCabe asked.
Kennedy did not issue a direct response
to the coalition's demands but said the
report issued by the University Committee
on Minority Issues "should be the sole
mechanism for evaluating needs and
priorities in this area.
"For that reason I think it would be
poor policy to respond to requests for par
ticular consideration of priorities, or of new
demands, at the very time our response
to the whole report is underway," Ken
nedy's statement read.
In reaction to Kennedy's response, soph
omore Louis Jackson of the Black Student
Union said in an interview, "Kennedy is
talking to the Academic Council about the
UCMI report on May 18, but he has not
talked to us about our educational
priorities. He's talking about his priorities
on the 18th, not ours."
