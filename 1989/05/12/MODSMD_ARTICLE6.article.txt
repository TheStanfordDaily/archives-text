# The 						Unseen Stanford: Coming Out After 4 Years
## Coming out in style 
### Elizabeth Howton Bob Michitarian Editorial Staff 
Come out n. 1. To be disclosed
2. to make a debut.
Webster's almost has it
right. Coming out is
partly about making
a disclosure, and for
some it involves making a debut
in new social circles.
It is also a process of self
discovery and self-acknowledge
ment — and it can last a lifetime.
The gay, lesbian and bisexual
people in today's stories have all
gone through four years of Stan
ford without explicitly confronting
their sexuality, although they
were aware of it to varying
degrees. They heard and saw ho
mophobia in action and were af
fected by it, though they told al
most no one of their feelings.
The strategies they used to find
support during this difficult but
exciting process are only three ex
amples of ways people at Stanford
come out. Their stories are not
representative of the wide range
of coming-out experiences; many
undergraduates come out before
their senior year.
But all sought help and friend
ship from other gay people after
they had made the decision to
explore their sexuality. "Ed"
found two gay friends in his dorm.

Editor's note: This is the fourth
of a five-part series coinciding
with Stanford's Gay and lesbian
Awareness Week. The"The Un
seen Stanford" is edited by Nick
Anderson.

"Shana" found out that a
longtime friend was bisexual.
"Karen" sent an electronic mail
message to a woman she didn't
know who often posts announce
ments to the gay bulletin board
on LOTS.
Although challenging society's
and one's own preconception
about sexuality is almost always
somewhat traumatic, today's
stories are about three people who
are having relatively positive
coming-out experiences. The re
sources available on campus aim
to ensure that everyone will be
so fortunate.
Counseling is provided by the
Bridge, and by Counseling and
Psychological Services. Andrew
Gans, a facilitator of the Coming-
Out Group at the Bridge, es
timates that about 40 people have
attended the group this year.
About 15 percent of the Bridge's
calls are gay-related.
CAPS does not keep statistics
that indicate how often same-sex
issues arise in counseling there.
Noting that about 40 percent of
each class uses CAPS' services in
their four years at Stanford, I)r.
Douglas Daher says that "people's
same-sex experiences are much
more frequent than the general
population typically assumes."
For people who simply want to
know that they're not alone,
GLAS provides social opportuni
ties and access to a campuswide
network of friends and acquain
tances that can ease coming out.
One way students conveniently
— and anonymously — find out
what's going on in the gay/les
bian/bisexual community is by
reading bboard gay on LOTS.
