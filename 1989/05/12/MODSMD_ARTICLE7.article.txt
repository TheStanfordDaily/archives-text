# It's coming out for good, it's not so bad

On April 20, America learned
that 47 sailors had died when the
gun turret on the U.S.S. lowa
exploded, Stanford learned the
results of the ASSU elections, and
"Karen" learned that "coming out
isn't so bad."
That day, Karen, an Asian-
American who graduated from
Stanford last year, went to her
first gay social event. It was a
Thursday night "Coffee House"
sponsored by Stanford's Gay and
Lesbian Alliance.
"1 never went to GLAS before
because I had the idea that I

didn't want to come out in front
of a bunch of strangers," she says.
Hut recently "it dawned on me
that they may be strangers, but
we have a very important aspect
of our lives in common."
Karen earned her bachelor's
degree in engineering and is now
working with a medical company
in Silicon Valley. She is a classical
musician and describes herself as
"shy, giving and quite outgoing
with people I'm comfortable
with."
She lives in the South Bay with
her family, who she plans on com
ing out to eventually because "1
can't imagine keeping that part
of my life secret. I'd rather have
their support than have to evade
them."

4 1 like myself
For most of her life, Karei
didn't know whether she was ga>
even though she says,"I sort o
knew I was different. I notice*
that my friends would giggl
about boys, like 'that guy witl
the freckles is cute,' and I wa
completely uninterested."
She says,"I didn't want to ad
mit it to myself until college.'
Karen says she "began to accep
that I was gay sophomore year,'
and came out to an open-mindec
friend from her freshman dorm.
"She was very supportive,'
Karen says, "Rut she didn't want
to push me to come out. She sue
gested I go to GLAS, but I'm gen
erally a fairly conservative person,
and over the next couple of years
I wasn't comfortable with the idea
of going (there)."
Karen has never had a relation
ship with a woman, and hoped
through college that her homo
sexual feelings were "just part of
a phase." She came out to a few
more close friends, then graduat
ed.
Now, "I feel very comfortable
with myself. I like the way I think;
I like the way I dress; I like
myself. Right now everything is
going pretty well in my life. The
only thing is that I don't have a
romantic life, and I'd like to have
somebody special in my life."
Living in two worlds
Going to the coffee house at
GLAS "was something that I felt
I had to do. I'd felt moody for a
while (because of not dating), and
I decided I'd better go meet people
or just shut up about it."
Karen only met a few people
that night; only about 10 showed
up. That Sunday she went to the
coming out group at the Bridge
and met another half dozen
people, all in situations similar to
hers.
After the group discussion was
over, she says,"I felt like I was
in a dream â€” is this real? Up

until I came out socially, I'd been
living in two worlds but experi
encing only one."
'It's only been a few weeks'
Karen says she's enjoying her
new-found social life. She says her
gay friends "are just regular
people, but knowing that they are
gay makes them special because
it's much more comfortable
talking to them."
Their conversations range
"from talking about ordinary
things like tennis shoes to things
like relationships."
Asked if she's met anyone she's
interested in, Karen blushes.
"Nope, no dates yet. But it's only
been a few weeks."
Karen says she'd like to meet
someone who is "independent and
not too hung up on role playing.
I admire people who do what they
want; that's a very attractive
quality."
She hopes to meet someone who
can share her appreciation in clas
sical music. "I've been playing
various instruments since I was
eight, and most of my friends are
musicians. It's important to me
that someone's able to understand
that mind-set."
"My excuse for not dating guys
in high school and college always
was 'I'm picky.' Well, I'm still
picky."
