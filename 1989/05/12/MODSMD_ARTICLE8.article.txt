# 'Finally happy, dealing with everything'

### Elizabeth Howton Boh Michitarian Editorial staff 
"Ed" is a senior in human bi
ology, and like many of his class
mates, he is chilling a bottle of
champagne for Commencement
But graduation isn't the only
transition in Ed's life. He has al
ways known that he's gay but is
only now taking his first steps
out of the closet.
"I can't believe that it's come
down to my last quarter at Stan
ford, and I'm finally happy, finally
dealing with everything," he says.
In the last few weeks, Ed has
attended a few gay events on
campus. He's come out to two gay
friends in his dorm Since, they
have taken him dancing in San
Francisco and introduced him to

other gay people.
"It's fun, but it's scary, too,"
he says.
'I felt a bond'
Ed, who is from a small town
in Texas, says he had crushes on
other boys as early as elementary
school. In high school he had a
girlfriend at a neighboring school,
but she was "more like just a
friend. . . . Her parents were from
Mexico. They were very strict, so
we had chaperones with us
literally every time we went out.
Her grandmother came on our
first date. (But) I didn't really
mind too much."
Ed and his former girlfriend are
still good friends, and he plans to
come out to her eventually.
Ed's parents are Hispanic, con
servative and Catholic. He says

that sex and sexuality have never
been discussed in his family.
"Even now, it's like, 'Guess what
I learned in Hum Bio?' We never
talk about it on a personal level."
Ed plans to tell his parents he
is gay, possibly at Commencement
weekend. "I think they'll be sup
portive," he says, because "they're
very loving. My family is close
knit, and I hope it won't separate
us."
The first time Ed told anyone
he might be gay was in 1983. Ed
was a candystnper at the local
hospital when it had to care for
its first person with AIDS. He
remembers helping to transfer all
the other patients off the floor,
wearing full surgical gear.
Ed went and talked to the man

with AIDS often until he died. "I
was the only one who cared about
him. ... I felt a bond because he
was openly gay. I talked to him a
lot — I had no one else to talk
to (about homosexuality)."
'Not myself
More than external pressures,
Ed thinks his own "denial and
insecurity" kept him from dealing
with his sexuality until this year.
His years at Stanford have been
"really hard. . . . Even though 1
had all these (gay) feelings 1 just
really couldn't accept them
myself, and that was my biggest
problem. Looking back, I was
really depressed. ... I tried to be
a trooper, really gung-ho."
During his freshman year, a gay
friend of Ed's asked if he was gay.
"I denied it. . . . It was the first
time I was forced to realize that
anyone else suspected. That was
really a scary thing. . . . Maybe
someone was seeing more in me
than I could see in myself.
"Now I want to go back and
talk to him, tell him. There are
a lot of things I have to go back
and re-live, because I really wasn't
myself — I was repressing so
many things."
'Don't feel alone anymore'
When Ed was an advising as
sociate his junior year, one of his
advisees came out to him, bring
ing homosexuality to the forefront
of his mind. "I was scared, con

fused and isolated," he recalls.
Things were made worse by the
fact that he lived in a dorm that
had a very loud, homophobic res
ident. "He really drove a lot of
people under. . . . The RA picked
up on it and scheduled some pro
grams, but of course the one per
son she was trying to reach didn't
come."
Senior year, Ed made friends
with a guy down the hall who he
thinks might also be gay. "We
could tell each other everything
— but one thing was missing. . . .
I wasn't sure if I was the only
one feeling that way. We were
somewhat physically involved,
and then he went home for Christ
mas and found a girlfriend."
Ed says that after that friend
ship "went down the tubes," he
learned that a friend from his
dorm was openly gay. "He was
there and willing to listen and be
a friend.... It was the first time
I acknowledged myself as a gay
man."
Up to that point, "I was always
interested, I always wanted to go
to gay events, I just didn't have
the guts to deal with it. ... I don't
know how many times I just sat
alone reflecting on everything and
came to the conclusion that I
should simply accept my feelings.
Then something would happen
and I'd say 'No, no, no.' And I'd
start doing my homework again."
At his first Stanford gay dance,
Ed saw another one of his ad
visees from last year — "someone
I had no idea was gay. ... I didr.'t
feel alone anymore.
"It really is like a family."
