"Ed" is a senior in human bi
ology, and like many of his class
mates, he is chilling a bottle of
champagne for Commencement
But graduation isn't the only
transition in Ed's life. He has al
ways known that he's gay but is
only now taking his first steps
out of the closet.
"I can't believe that it's come
down to my last quarter at Stan
ford, and I'm finally happy, finally
dealing with everything," he says.
In the last few weeks, Ed has
attended a few gay events on
campus. He's come out to two gay
friends in his dorm Since, they
have taken him dancing in San
Francisco and introduced him to

other gay people.
"It's fun, but it's scary, too,"
he says.
'I felt a bond'
Ed, who is from a small town
in Texas, says he had crushes on
other boys as early as elementary
school. In high school he had a
girlfriend at a neighboring school,
but she was "more like just a
friend. . . . Her parents were from
Mexico. They were very strict, so
we had chaperones with us
literally every time we went out.
Her grandmother came on our
first date. (But) I didn't really
mind too much."
Ed and his former girlfriend are
still good friends, and he plans to
come out to her eventually.
Ed's parents are Hispanic, con
servative and Catholic. He says

that sex and sexuality have never
been discussed in his family.
"Even now, it's like, 'Guess what
I learned in Hum Bio?' We never
talk about it on a personal level."
Ed plans to tell his parents he
is gay, possibly at Commencement
weekend. "I think they'll be sup
portive," he says, because "they're
very loving. My family is close
knit, and I hope it won't separate
us."
The first time Ed told anyone
he might be gay was in 1983. Ed
was a candystnper at the local
hospital when it had to care for
its first person with AIDS. He
remembers helping to transfer all
the other patients off the floor,
wearing full surgical gear.
