Sunday is special for Olympians
The Sunday morning sun usually rises over a
slumbering campus, but this Sunday it will greet
perhaps more than 300 Stanford students awake
early to befriend a special athlete at this year's
Special Olympics.
More than 250 disabled athletes from Santa
Clara County, ranging in age from 12 to 60, will
be swimming in this year's competition at
deGuerre Pool.
According to senior Karen Schlepfer, co-chair
of the event, 70 students have signed up to vol
unteer for the day. But organizers are encouraging
anyone not yet signed up to show up anyway —
they need as many volunteers as possible.
Anyone interested in volunteering should meet
at deGuerre at 7 a.m. on Sunday No advance
registration is necessary.
"Volunteers can work with their friends, get a
free t-shirt and tan and have the most wonderful
experience," Schlepfer said.
Student volunteers can serve as lap swimmers
and timers, give out awards or be an athlete's
"buddy" for the day.
Stanford students who have previously volun
teered in this annual event rave about the day
and return year after year. Senior Jim Pitofsky,
who has been a volunteer each of his years at
Stanford, said, "Special Olympics stands out as
one of the happiest days of each year. I look back

at it that way and look forward to it that way."
In addition to the swimming events, the day
will include entertainment featuring dunking
booths, face painting and clowns. Both the Fleet
Street Singers and the Stanford Band will par
ticipate in the festivities as well.
Lunches donated from Togo's Eatery and
Burger King will be provided for athletes and
volunteers.

Powwow features tribal dancing
A flurry of tribal dancing, drumming and music
will fill the intramural fields near Stanford Sta
dium today through Sunday as Native Americans
from throughout the United States and Canada
congregate for the 18th Annual Stanford Pow
wow.
The Stanford Powwow was conceived and or
ganized by Stanford students in 1971 to promote
Native American pride and increase awareness
of that culture.
With representatives of more than 200 tribes
attending, an arts and crafts fair, dance and
drum competitions and food booths, it has grown
to become the largest of its kind on the West
Coast. It is free and open to the general public.
"It's the climax of our whole year," organizer
Marcy Harris said.
