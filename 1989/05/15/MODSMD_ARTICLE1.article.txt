### Mark Rogowsky Editorial staff 
GAINESVILLE, Fla. - One
hour and 34 minutes into the
NCAA women's tennis finals be
tween Stanford and UCLA yester
day, the Cardinal's Lisa Green hit
a low cross court forehand right
at the Bruins' Mamie Ceniza.

Stanford wins NCAA title
Ceniza was charging the net and
tried to make a volley. But Green's
shot was too good: The ball failed
to clear the net, and Stanford had
clinched its unprecedented fourth
straight national title with an
awesome 5-0 victory over the
Bruins.
The win also moved the Cardi
nal's record to 29-0 — the third
time the team has gone unde
feated en route to capturing a na
tional championship.
All season long, Stanford Coach
Frank Brennan was asked: "Is
this the best team you've ever
had?" Yesterday, he finally gave
his answer.
"I have to think it is at this
point. We won very convincingly
today and yesterday," Brennan

said. "We dominated like no other
team I've ever had."
They dominated to the extent
that the team didn't need to play
doubles in any matches at NCAAs
— and only needed to four times
all year. They dominated to the
extent that of the 26 individual
matches the team played in
Gainesville they won 25.
They dominated to the extent
that it seems ridiculous anyone
would've predicted differently. Yet
many of the other teams did just
that.
"I don't know where they came
up with this (that Stanford was
beatable)," Teri Whitlinger said.
"We were only tested a couple of
times and came through those
times."
Said Tami Whitlinger: "I
definitely believe our team rose
to the occasion. We never let any
thing anyone said bother us."
They agreed, as did all the Stan
ford players, that the key to their
season-long success was team
work. In a sport as individual as
tennis, what does teamwork have
to do with anything?
Firstly, it means accepting your
position in the lineup even if you
think you should be higher. Teri
