# Call it a dynasty: Women's tennis wins 4th in a row
## Stanford sweeps UCLA 5-0 to claim NCAA team title 
### Mark Rogowsky Editorial staff 
GAINESVILLE, Fla. - One
hour and 34 minutes into the
NCAA women's tennis finals be
tween Stanford and UCLA yester
day, the Cardinal's Lisa Green hit
a low cross court forehand right
at the Bruins' Mamie Ceniza.

Ceniza was charging the net and
tried to make a volley. But Green's
shot was too good: The ball failed
to clear the net, and Stanford had
clinched its unprecedented fourth
straight national title with an
awesome 5-0 victory over the
Bruins.
The win also moved the Cardi
nal's record to 29-0 — the third
time the team has gone unde
feated en route to capturing a na
tional championship.
All season long, Stanford Coach
Frank Brennan was asked: "Is
this the best team you've ever
had?" Yesterday, he finally gave
his answer.
"I have to think it is at this
point. We won very convincingly
today and yesterday," Brennan

said. "We dominated like no other
team I've ever had."
They dominated to the extent
that the team didn't need to play
doubles in any matches at NCAAs
— and only needed to four times
all year. They dominated to the
extent that of the 26 individual
matches the team played in
Gainesville they won 25.
They dominated to the extent
that it seems ridiculous anyone
would've predicted differently. Yet
many of the other teams did just
that.
"I don't know where they came
up with this (that Stanford was
beatable)," Teri Whitlinger said.
"We were only tested a couple of
times and came through those
times."
Said Tami Whitlinger: "I
definitely believe our team rose
to the occasion. We never let any
thing anyone said bother us."
They agreed, as did all the Stan
ford players, that the key to their
season-long success was team
work. In a sport as individual as
tennis, what does teamwork have
to do with anything?
Firstly, it means accepting your
position in the lineup even if you
think you should be higher. Teri
Whitlinger learned to be happy at

No. 5. Debbie Graham learned to
just win at No. 4.
Secondly, there's the belief the
players have in one another.
"Everyone on our team has so
much confidence in everyone
else," Green said.
Said Tami Whitlinger: "Before
my match, I know that Kylie's
going to win, Teri's going to win
land so on down the line] ... I
know they're not going to lose."
"We feel more comfortable. You
know the whole match does not
depend on you," Teri Whitlinger
added.
"You know (as a player) you
don't have to carry the weight of
the world on your shoulders,"
Brennan noted.
Finally, it didn't hurt that "We
got along better than any team
in Stanford's history," Tami
Whitlinger said.
It was that combination that
allowed the Cardinal to deal with
the surprise the NCAAs had in
store for them.
All along, it was expected Stan
ford and host Florida would be
playing in the finals and that the
Cardinal would capture the title.
Then Saturday, UCLA threw half
of the conventional wisdom for a
loop by unexpectedly upsetting
the Lady Gators.
The other half — the stuff
about the Cardinal winning — the
Bruins had no answer for. When
examining the singles matchups,
UClj\ realistically could only feel
confident about the No. 6 match
between Kylie Johnson and the
Bruins' Kirsten Dreyer.
Dreyer was ranked eighth in
the country in the preseason, then
suffered a shoulder injury that
kept her out of action until na
tionals. Johnson came to Stanford
as a relatively unheralded fresh
man.
So, as fate would have it,
Johnson came out like gang
busters and won the first set 6-2.
She opened the second set with a
service break and broke Dreyer
again in the seventh game to go
up 5-2.
Before Dreyer knew what hit
her, Johnson was serving for the
match at 40-15. Johnson hit an
errand forehand to make it 40-30.
On the next point, Dreyer hit a
short ball, Johnson stepped in and
snapped off one of her patented
cross-court forehand winners.
Stanford 1, UCLA 0.
So much for the Bruins' guar
antee.
"I didn't know I was supposed
to lose in their minds," Johnson
said after the match. "I played
her last year and beat her when
she was healthy."
But did losing the match they
felt they'd win hurt the Bruins
emotionally?
"I don't think my winning had
much of an impact," Johnson said.
Brennan noted, however, that
"It might've been fairly significant
to see Dreyer lose ... they started
falling after that."

Whether it was correlation or
casualty is moot, for the Bruins
did start falling.
Minutes after Johnson's win,
Iwalani McCalla put a backhand
in the doubles alley to give Teri
Whitlinger an impressive 6-4, 6-1
victory. Stanford 2, UCLA 0.
The crowd's attention quickly
shifted to Court 2, where Sandra
Birch was serving for the match
against Alysia May. Birch quickly
opened it up to 40-0, giving her
three match points.
May hung in and cut it to 40-30
before Birch put one away. With
that her 6-4, 6-2 drubbing of May
was complete. Stanford 3, UCLA
0.
Then, in perhaps the most tense
moment of the day, the Stanford
team and the crowd had to divide
their attention between the No. 3
and No. 4 matches to determine
who would clinch the champion
ship for Stanford.

'We dominated like
no other team I've
ever had.'

At No. 3, Green was receiving
up 5-3 in the second set. Mean
while at No. 4, Graham was serv
ing for the match at 5-2 against
Stella Sampras — it seemed au
tomatic.
It wasn't, though. Sampras
broke her on just four points to
cut it to 5-3. On the other court,
Ceniza held her serve, so Green's
lead was trimmed to 5-4.
While Green sat down during
the changeover Graham jumped
on Sampras' serve and took a 40-
15 lead. On the next point,
Graham let fly a rocket backhand
for a winner. Her 6-3, 6-3 victory
upped her season dual-match
record to a perfect 27-0. Stanford
4, UCLA 0.
Green was two points away
from clinching the national cham
pionship — but didn't realize it.
"I didn't know it was over until
I came to the sidelines," Green
said.
Still she held her serve and
finished off Ceniza 6-2, 6-4. Tami
Whitlinger, in midst of battling
Jessica Emmons at No. 1, pumped
her fists and said: "Yeah, Lisa
way to go."
Stanford 5, UCLA 0. Four in a
row. Six of the last eight. A
dynasty. The best team ever.
The Cardinal's dynastic form
was also on display Saturday in
the semifinals. Playing Georgia,
the only top team Stanford hadn't
faced this year, the Cardinal re
corded its 15th shutout of the
year.
Heading into the match Geor
gia's Jill Waldman and Caryn
Moss had 23- and 20- match win
streaks respectively — and the
Bulldogs had won 17 in a row as
a team.
Teri Whitlinger buried Wald
man 6-1, 6-2 and Green bested
Moss 7-5, 6-4. So much for their

winning streaks, and so much for
Georgia's.
Graham romped past Elizabeth
Alexander 6-0, 6-3. Johnson split
sets with Tonya Bogdonas before
dusting her in the third set. The
score there was 6-4, 6-7 (7-1) ,
6-0. That left the clincher up to
Birch or Tami Whitlinger.
Birch had lost her match Friday
against Oklahoma State. She then
dropped her third set in a row
over the two day period at the
start of her battle with Georgia's
Stecey Schefflin.
But Birch battled back to score
the 2-6, 6-2, 6-2 win. "I had a
hard day (Friday)," Birch said. "I
needed to come back strong."
Birch added her turnaround in
the second set was because she
"played more aggressive. I wasn't
afraid to lose ... I went out to
win."
With the team match decided,
Tami Whitlinger closed out Shan

nan McCarthy 6-2, 6 -7 (7-5), 6-4.
In Friday's quarterfinal, the
Cardinal beat Oklahoma State 5-1.
The Cowgirls put up a fight but
were outmatched.
Tami Whitlinger overcame
Tessa Price 6-3, 7-6 (7-4). Graham
crushed Sally Godman 6-3, 6-1.
Johnson sailed past Jackie Booth
7-6 (7-2), 6-1. Teri Whitlinger
trounced Caroline Delisle 6-1, 6-1.
Birch's 6-3, 6-3 loss to Monika
Waniek meant that Green had to
pull out her singles match to elim
inate the need for doubles.
The third set went to a tie
breaker Three times Danielle
Jones had match points; three
times she saved them. Finally, on
her third match point, Green won
the tiebreaker 12-10 for the 6-2,
2-6, 7-6 victory and the semifinal
berth.
Green said she wasn't thinking
about the possibility of going to
doubles when she served match

point. "I was just thinking, 'get
tb'<» one point,' " she said.
It was the same thought she
had with the national title on the
line.
Card notes
Saturday night, the entire Stanford
party went out for dinner — players,
coaches, family and fans. Despite
being over 3,000 miles from campus,
the party totaled 57.
Throughout the tournament, Green
wore a pair of lucky shoelaces given
to her by men's team member Jeff
Tarango. "I was guaranteed that we'd
win if I wore them. They're inspira
tional," Green said.
The individual singles and doubles
competitions begin today. Green,
Birch, Graham and both Whitlinger
twins will be competing. Tami Whit
linger is the No. 1 seed and all five
are among the top 16. The Whitlin
gers are entered in the doubles as are
Birch and Graham.

dropped her third set in a row
over the two day period at the
start of her battle with Georgia's
Stecey Schefflin.
But Birch battled back to score
the 2-6, 6-2, 6-2 win. "I had a
hard day (Friday)," Birch said. "I
needed to come back strong."
Birch added her turnaround in
the second set was because she
"played more aggressive. I wasn't
afraid to lose ... I went out to
win."
With the team match decided,
Tami Whitlinger closed out Shan

nan McCarthy 6-2, 6 -7 (7-5), 6-4.
In Friday's quarterfinal, the
Cardinal beat Oklahoma State 5-1.
The Cowgirls put up a fight but
were outmatched.
Tami Whitlinger overcame
Tessa Price 6-3, 7-6 (7-4). Graham
crushed Sally Godman 6-3, 6-1.
Johnson sailed past Jackie Booth
7-6 (7-2), 6-1. Teri Whitlinger
trounced Caroline Delisle 6-1, 6-1.
Birch's 6-3, 6-3 loss to Monika
Waniek meant that Green had to
pull out her singles match to elim
inate the need for doubles.
The third set went to a tie
breaker Three times Danielle
Jones had match points; three
times she saved them. Finally, on
her third match point, Green won
the tiebreaker 12-10 for the 6-2,
2-6, 7-6 victory and the semifinal
berth.
Green said she wasn't thinking
about the possibility of going to
doubles when she served match

point. "I was just thinking, 'get
tb'<» one point,' " she said.
It was the same thought she
had with the national title on the
line.

Freshman Kylie Johnson easily upset UCLA's Kirsten Dreyer 6-2, 6-2 In No. 6 singles to set the tone for the
Cardinal's ensuing five-match blowout of the Bruins yesterday in the finals of the NCAA Tournament
GAINESVILLE, Fla. - One
hour and 34 minutes into the
NCAA women's tennis finals be
tween Stanford and UCLA yester
day, the Cardinal's Lisa Green hit
a low cross court forehand right
at the Bruins' Mamie Ceniza.
Women's Tennis
Cardinal 5, Bruins 0
Stanford wins NCAA title
Ceniza was charging the net and
tried to make a volley. But Green's
shot was too good: The ball failed
to clear the net, and Stanford had
clinched its unprecedented fourth
straight national title with an
awesome 5-0 victory over the
Bruins.
The win also moved the Cardi
nal's record to 29-0 — the third
time the team has gone unde
feated en route to capturing a na
tional championship.
All season long, Stanford Coach
Frank Brennan was asked: "Is
this the best team you've ever
had?" Yesterday, he finally gave
his answer.
"I have to think it is at this
point. We won very convincingly
today and yesterday," Brennan

said. "We dominated like no other
team I've ever had."
They dominated to the extent
that the team didn't need to play
doubles in any matches at NCAAs
— and only needed to four times
all year. They dominated to the
extent that of the 26 individual
matches the team played in
Gainesville they won 25.
They dominated to the extent
that it seems ridiculous anyone
would've predicted differently. Yet
many of the other teams did just
that.
"I don't know where they came
up with this (that Stanford was
beatable)," Teri Whitlinger said.
"We were only tested a couple of
times and came through those
times."
Said Tami Whitlinger: "I
definitely believe our team rose
to the occasion. We never let any
thing anyone said bother us."
They agreed, as did all the Stan
ford players, that the key to their
season-long success was team
work. In a sport as individual as
tennis, what does teamwork have
to do with anything?
Firstly, it means accepting your
position in the lineup even if you
think you should be higher. Teri
Whitlinger learned to be happy at


Teri Whltlinger, Coach Frank Brennan, Kylie Johnson and Sandra Birch celebrate victory at the NCAA tournament.
No. 5. Debbie Graham learned to
just win at No. 4.
Secondly, there's the belief the
players have in one another.
"Everyone on our team has so
much confidence in everyone
else," Green said.
Said Tami Whitlinger: "Before
my match, I know that Kylie's
going to win, Teri's going to win
land so on down the line] ... I
know they're not going to lose."
"We feel more comfortable. You
know the whole match does not
depend on you," Teri Whitlinger
added.
"You know (as a player) you
don't have to carry the weight of
the world on your shoulders,"
Brennan noted.
Finally, it didn't hurt that "We
got along better than any team
in Stanford's history," Tami
Whitlinger said.
It was that combination that
allowed the Cardinal to deal with
the surprise the NCAAs had in
store for them.
All along, it was expected Stan
ford and host Florida would be
playing in the finals and that the
Cardinal would capture the title.
Then Saturday, UCLA threw half
of the conventional wisdom for a
loop by unexpectedly upsetting
the Lady Gators.
The other half — the stuff
about the Cardinal winning — the
Bruins had no answer for. When
examining the singles matchups,
UClj\ realistically could only feel
confident about the No. 6 match
between Kylie Johnson and the
Bruins' Kirsten Dreyer.
Dreyer was ranked eighth in
the country in the preseason, then
suffered a shoulder injury that
kept her out of action until na
tionals. Johnson came to Stanford
as a relatively unheralded fresh
man.
So, as fate would have it,
Johnson came out like gang
busters and won the first set 6-2.
She opened the second set with a
service break and broke Dreyer
again in the seventh game to go
up 5-2.
Before Dreyer knew what hit
her, Johnson was serving for the
match at 40-15. Johnson hit an
errand forehand to make it 40-30.
On the next point, Dreyer hit a
short ball, Johnson stepped in and
snapped off one of her patented
cross-court forehand winners.
Stanford 1, UCLA 0.
So much for the Bruins' guar
antee.
"I didn't know I was supposed
to lose in their minds," Johnson
said after the match. "I played
her last year and beat her when
she was healthy."
But did losing the match they
felt they'd win hurt the Bruins
emotionally?
"I don't think my winning had
much of an impact," Johnson said.
Brennan noted, however, that
"It might've been fairly significant
to see Dreyer lose ... they started
falling after that."

Whether it was correlation or
casualty is moot, for the Bruins
did start falling.
Minutes after Johnson's win,
Iwalani McCalla put a backhand
in the doubles alley to give Teri
Whitlinger an impressive 6-4, 6-1
victory. Stanford 2, UCLA 0.
The crowd's attention quickly
shifted to Court 2, where Sandra
Birch was serving for the match
against Alysia May. Birch quickly
opened it up to 40-0, giving her
three match points.
May hung in and cut it to 40-30
before Birch put one away. With
that her 6-4, 6-2 drubbing of May
was complete. Stanford 3, UCLA
0.
Then, in perhaps the most tense
moment of the day, the Stanford
team and the crowd had to divide
their attention between the No. 3
and No. 4 matches to determine
who would clinch the champion
ship for Stanford.

'We dominated like
no other team I've
ever had.'

At No. 3, Green was receiving
up 5-3 in the second set. Mean
while at No. 4, Graham was serv
ing for the match at 5-2 against
Stella Sampras — it seemed au
tomatic.
It wasn't, though. Sampras
broke her on just four points to
cut it to 5-3. On the other court,
Ceniza held her serve, so Green's
lead was trimmed to 5-4.
While Green sat down during
the changeover Graham jumped
on Sampras' serve and took a 40-
15 lead. On the next point,
Graham let fly a rocket backhand
for a winner. Her 6-3, 6-3 victory
upped her season dual-match
record to a perfect 27-0. Stanford
4, UCLA 0.
Green was two points away
from clinching the national cham
pionship — but didn't realize it.
"I didn't know it was over until
I came to the sidelines," Green
said.
Still she held her serve and
finished off Ceniza 6-2, 6-4. Tami
Whitlinger, in midst of battling
Jessica Emmons at No. 1, pumped
her fists and said: "Yeah, Lisa
way to go."
Stanford 5, UCLA 0. Four in a
row. Six of the last eight. A
dynasty. The best team ever.
The Cardinal's dynastic form
was also on display Saturday in
the semifinals. Playing Georgia,
the only top team Stanford hadn't
faced this year, the Cardinal re
corded its 15th shutout of the
year.
Heading into the match Geor
gia's Jill Waldman and Caryn
Moss had 23- and 20- match win
streaks respectively — and the
Bulldogs had won 17 in a row as
a team.
Teri Whitlinger buried Wald
man 6-1, 6-2 and Green bested
Moss 7-5, 6-4. So much for their

winning streaks, and so much for
Georgia's.
Graham romped past Elizabeth
Alexander 6-0, 6-3. Johnson split
sets with Tonya Bogdonas before
dusting her in the third set. The
score there was 6-4, 6-7 (7-1) ,
6-0. That left the clincher up to
Birch or Tami Whitlinger.
Birch had lost her match Friday
against Oklahoma State. She then
dropped her third set in a row
over the two day period at the
start of her battle with Georgia's

moment of the day, the Stanford
team and the crowd had to divide
their attention between the No. 3
and No. 4 matches to determine
who would clinch the champion
ship for Stanford.

'We dominated like
no other team I've
ever had.'

At No. 3, Green was receiving
up 5-3 in the second set. Mean
while at No. 4, Graham was serv
ing for the match at 5-2 against
Stella Sampras — it seemed au
tomatic.
It wasn't, though. Sampras
broke her on just four points to
cut it to 5-3. On the other court,
Ceniza held her serve, so Green's
lead was trimmed to 5-4.
While Green sat down during
the changeover Graham jumped
on Sampras' serve and took a 40-
15 lead. On the next point,
Graham let fly a rocket backhand
for a winner. Her 6-3, 6-3 victory
upped her season dual-match
record to a perfect 27-0. Stanford
4, UCLA 0.
Green was two points away
from clinching the national cham
pionship — but didn't realize it.
"I didn't know it was over until
I came to the sidelines," Green
said.
Still she held her serve and
finished off Ceniza 6-2, 6-4. Tami
Whitlinger, in midst of battling
Jessica Emmons at No. 1, pumped
her fists and said: "Yeah, Lisa
way to go."
Stanford 5, UCLA 0. Four in a
row. Six of the last eight. A
dynasty. The best team ever.
The Cardinal's dynastic form
was also on display Saturday in
the semifinals. Playing Georgia,
the only top team Stanford hadn't
faced this year, the Cardinal re
corded its 15th shutout of the
year.
Heading into the match Geor
gia's Jill Waldman and Caryn
Moss had 23- and 20- match win
streaks respectively — and the
Bulldogs had won 17 in a row as
a team.
Teri Whitlinger buried Wald
man 6-1, 6-2 and Green bested
Moss 7-5, 6-4. So much for their

winning streaks, and so much for
Georgia's.
Graham romped past Elizabeth
Alexander 6-0, 6-3. Johnson split
sets with Tonya Bogdonas before
dusting her in the third set. The
score there was 6-4, 6-7 (7-1) ,
6-0. That left the clincher up to
Birch or Tami Whitlinger.
Birch had lost her match Friday
against Oklahoma State. She then
dropped her third set in a row
over the two day period at the
start of her battle with Georgia's
Stecey Schefflin.
But Birch battled back to score
the 2-6, 6-2, 6-2 win. "I had a
hard day (Friday)," Birch said. "I
needed to come back strong."
Birch added her turnaround in
the second set was because she
"played more aggressive. I wasn't
afraid to lose ... I went out to
win."
With the team match decided,
Tami Whitlinger closed out Shan

nan McCarthy 6-2, 6 -7 (7-5), 6-4.
In Friday's quarterfinal, the
Cardinal beat Oklahoma State 5-1.
The Cowgirls put up a fight but
were outmatched.
Tami Whitlinger overcame
Tessa Price 6-3, 7-6 (7-4). Graham
crushed Sally Godman 6-3, 6-1.
Johnson sailed past Jackie Booth
7-6 (7-2), 6-1. Teri Whitlinger
trounced Caroline Delisle 6-1, 6-1.
Birch's 6-3, 6-3 loss to Monika
Waniek meant that Green had to
pull out her singles match to elim
inate the need for doubles.
The third set went to a tie
breaker Three times Danielle
Jones had match points; three
times she saved them. Finally, on
her third match point, Green won
the tiebreaker 12-10 for the 6-2,
2-6, 7-6 victory and the semifinal
berth.
Green said she wasn't thinking
about the possibility of going to
doubles when she served match

point. "I was just thinking, 'get
tb'<» one point,' " she said.
It was the same thought she
had with the national title on the
line.

Saturday night, the entire Stanford

being over 3,000 miles from campus,
the party totaled 57.
Throughout the tournament, Green

to her by men's team member Jeff
Tarango. "I was guaranteed that we'd

Freshman Kylie Johnson easily upset UCLA's Kirsten Dreyer 6-2, 6-2 In No. 6 singles to set the tone for the
Cardinal's ensuing five-match blowout of the Bruins yesterday in the finals of the NCAA Tournament
GAINESVILLE, Fla. - One
hour and 34 minutes into the
NCAA women's tennis finals be
tween Stanford and UCLA yester
day, the Cardinal's Lisa Green hit
a low cross court forehand right
at the Bruins' Mamie Ceniza.
Women's Tennis
Cardinal 5, Bruins 0
Stanford wins NCAA title
Ceniza was charging the net and
tried to make a volley. But Green's
shot was too good: The ball failed
to clear the net, and Stanford had
clinched its unprecedented fourth
straight national title with an
awesome 5-0 victory over the
Bruins.
The win also moved the Cardi
nal's record to 29-0 — the third
time the team has gone unde
feated en route to capturing a na
tional championship.
All season long, Stanford Coach
Frank Brennan was asked: "Is
this the best team you've ever
had?" Yesterday, he finally gave
his answer.
"I have to think it is at this
point. We won very convincingly
today and yesterday," Brennan

said. "We dominated like no other
team I've ever had."
They dominated to the extent
that the team didn't need to play
doubles in any matches at NCAAs
— and only needed to four times
all year. They dominated to the
extent that of the 26 individual
matches the team played in
Gainesville they won 25.
They dominated to the extent
that it seems ridiculous anyone
would've predicted differently. Yet
many of the other teams did just
that.
"I don't know where they came
up with this (that Stanford was
beatable)," Teri Whitlinger said.
"We were only tested a couple of
times and came through those
times."
Said Tami Whitlinger: "I
definitely believe our team rose
to the occasion. We never let any
thing anyone said bother us."
They agreed, as did all the Stan
ford players, that the key to their
season-long success was team
work. In a sport as individual as
tennis, what does teamwork have
to do with anything?
Firstly, it means accepting your
position in the lineup even if you
think you should be higher. Teri
Whitlinger learned to be happy at


Teri Whltlinger, Coach Frank Brennan, Kylie Johnson and Sandra Birch celebrate victory at the NCAA tournament.
No. 5. Debbie Graham learned to
just win at No. 4.
Secondly, there's the belief the
players have in one another.
"Everyone on our team has so
much confidence in everyone
else," Green said.
Said Tami Whitlinger: "Before
my match, I know that Kylie's
going to win, Teri's going to win
land so on down the line] ... I
know they're not going to lose."
"We feel more comfortable. You
know the whole match does not
depend on you," Teri Whitlinger
added.
"You know (as a player) you
don't have to carry the weight of
the world on your shoulders,"
Brennan noted.
Finally, it didn't hurt that "We
got along better than any team
in Stanford's history," Tami
Whitlinger said.
It was that combination that
allowed the Cardinal to deal with
the surprise the NCAAs had in
store for them.
All along, it was expected Stan
ford and host Florida would be
playing in the finals and that the
Cardinal would capture the title.
Then Saturday, UCLA threw half
of the conventional wisdom for a
loop by unexpectedly upsetting
the Lady Gators.
The other half — the stuff
about the Cardinal winning — the
Bruins had no answer for. When
examining the singles matchups,
UClj\ realistically could only feel
confident about the No. 6 match
between Kylie Johnson and the
Bruins' Kirsten Dreyer.
Dreyer was ranked eighth in
the country in the preseason, then
suffered a shoulder injury that
kept her out of action until na
tionals. Johnson came to Stanford
as a relatively unheralded fresh
man.
So, as fate would have it,
Johnson came out like gang
busters and won the first set 6-2.
She opened the second set with a
service break and broke Dreyer
again in the seventh game to go
up 5-2.
Before Dreyer knew what hit
her, Johnson was serving for the
match at 40-15. Johnson hit an
errand forehand to make it 40-30.
On the next point, Dreyer hit a
short ball, Johnson stepped in and
snapped off one of her patented
cross-court forehand winners.
Stanford 1, UCLA 0.
So much for the Bruins' guar
antee.
"I didn't know I was supposed
to lose in their minds," Johnson
said after the match. "I played
her last year and beat her when
she was healthy."
But did losing the match they
felt they'd win hurt the Bruins
emotionally?
"I don't think my winning had
much of an impact," Johnson said.
Brennan noted, however, that
"It might've been fairly significant
to see Dreyer lose ... they started
falling after that."

Whether it was correlation or
casualty is moot, for the Bruins
did start falling.
Minutes after Johnson's win,
Iwalani McCalla put a backhand
in the doubles alley to give Teri
Whitlinger an impressive 6-4, 6-1
victory. Stanford 2, UCLA 0.
The crowd's attention quickly
shifted to Court 2, where Sandra
Birch was serving for the match
against Alysia May. Birch quickly
opened it up to 40-0, giving her
three match points.
May hung in and cut it to 40-30
before Birch put one away. With
that her 6-4, 6-2 drubbing of May
was complete. Stanford 3, UCLA
0.
Then, in perhaps the most tense
moment of the day, the Stanford
team and the crowd had to divide
their attention between the No. 3
and No. 4 matches to determine
who would clinch the champion
