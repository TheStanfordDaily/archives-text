## Catholics condemn violence 
### 
PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP)
— Churchgoers applauded nation
wide yesterday when Roman
Catholic clergy read a letter con
demning electoral fraud and vio
lence, and opposition supporters
staged brief, peaceful protests.
The pastoral letter, which urged
Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega's
Defense Forces not to use arms
against "a defenseless people,"
also was read during a service
broadcast on state-run television.
At churches across the capital
and in other Panamanian cities,
worshipers waved white hand
erkerchiefs, paper, and Panama
nian flags.
Opposition supporters handed
out leaflets urging similar dis
plays during a general strike
called Wednesday to protest fraud
during the May 7 election and
violence by Noriega, the nation's
de facto ruler.
"We must say 'no' to all of this
corruption and 'yes' to liberty and
justice," said the Rev. Javier Vil
; lanueva at Cristo Rey church.
. The congregation chanted "Jus
\ tice, Justice" and waved white
' handkerchiefs when opposition
! vice presidential candiates Ricardo
' Arias Calderon and Guillermo
Ford walked in.
•
In brief comments to reporters
after services, Arias Calderon said
rumors were being spread about
a political settlement involving a
power-sharing junta.
However, he rejected the idea.
"Nothing doing. No playing with
the popular will of the people,"
he declared.
"The only solution begins with
recognition of the May 7 election.
Nothing more, nothing less," he
said.
The opposition has said it will
negotiate only with the military,
because it does not recognize the

current government. It has said
Noriega can join talks, but only
with the understanding that any
agreement will call for him to
leave.
The opposition's presidential
candidate, Guillermo Endara, re
mained hospitalized, recovering
from injuries sustained when he,
Arias Calderon and Ford were
beaten by Noriega supporters
Wednesday.
One leaflet being distributed
outside churches asked members
of the congregation to stop playing
the national lottery or going to
the race track, because that
money helps the government.
Opposition leaders say Endara
easily defeated Noriega's hand

picked candidate, Carlos Duque,
in the presidential race. Endara
and other opposition candidates
were severely beaten by Noriega
supporters during protests that
followed the election debacle.
The government nullified the
election results.
The pastoral letter was issued
Thursday by Archbishop Marcos
McGrath and other bishops of the
Roman Catholic Episcopal Confer
ence of Panama and was read by
Catholic clergy nationwide.
There had been some doubt the
government would permit it to be
read on the government-controlled
television's normal Sunday Mass
broadcast.
