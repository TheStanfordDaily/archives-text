## Sino-Soviet summit spurring goodwill toward Gorbachev 
### 
BEIJING (AP) - What some
people call "Gorbachev fever" has
yet to invade China, but the Chi
nese media and public are praising
the Soviet leader in connection
with this week's summit.
"We hope our leaders will learn
from him," said a middle-aged
man who lauded President Mik
hail S. Gorbachev's policy of glas
nost, or openness.
The Soviets "even had election
protests," the man said. "We ha
ven't come that far."
The summit symbolizes the end
of a 30-year rift between the two
communist giants.
The Chinese government, how
ever, has maintained a low-key
attitude toward the historic meet
ing. It appears determined to as
sure Western countries that China
has no intention of restoring the
close ties it had with the Soviets
in the 19505.
In the week leading up to the
summit, state-run newspapers
began publishing a few articles on
the Soviet Union and on Gorba

chev and his wife, Raisa, but little
was said of the summit.
The People's Daily, the Com
munist Party newspaper, carried
a glowing profile of Mrs. Gorba
chev on Sunday, writing of her
beauty, intelligence and "vivacious
personality."
National television broadcast a
program Sunday night on Gorba
chev and his family. But on the
national evening news, Gorba
chev's departure from Moscow fol
lowed reports on a steel confer
ence and a student hunger strike
at Beijing's Tiananmen Square.
Despite the lack of coverage
Beijing residents are aware of the
summit and the Soviet leader's
experiments in allowing greater
political and cultural debate.
Demonstrating students who
are demanding a free press and
greater political freedom view
Gorbachev's reforms with special
interest.
About 6,000 students signed a
letter delivered Saturday to the
Soviet Embassy inviting Gorba

chev to speak to them at Beijing
University. The embassy said it
would deliver the letter to Gor
bachev but his schedule during
the three-day Beijing visit is tight.
"The mainstream is moving
toward economic liberalization
and political democratization,"
they declared in a manifesto read
at the square. "The People's
Congress of the Soviet Union has
realized a relatively high level of
democracy compared to other
socialist countries."
There seems to be little public
animosity or suspicion toward the
country that the official Chinese
media lashed for many years as
a war-mongering territory grab
ber.
"If they demobilize some of the
troops from their border and we
demobilize some of ours, we'll
reduce the burden of military
spending," said a young man on
a bicycle.
"Of course, in foreign relations,
two countries always use each
other, don't they?" he added.
