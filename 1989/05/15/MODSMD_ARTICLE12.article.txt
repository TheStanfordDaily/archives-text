Aircraft carrier explosion kills two
NORFOLK, Va. (AP) — An explosion and fire
killed two crewmen on the aircraft carrier USS
America, the Navy said yesterday. It was the
third fatal fire aboard a U.S. warship in less
than a month.
The Norfolk-based carrier was in the Atlantic
several hundred miles off North Carolina when
the explosion occurred in a fuel pump room about
7 p.m. EDT Saturday, according to Lt. Cmdr.
Mike John, a Navy spokesman.
The ship, which left Norfolk on Thursday with
a crew of about 5,000, continued on its mission,
a six-month deployment to the Mediterranean
Sea and Indian Ocean.
The victims of Saturday's fire apparently were
working in the fuel pump room at the time of
the explosion, Jenkins said. Aircraft carriers have
"miles and miles of piping" through which jet
fuel is circulated by several pumps, he said.
The dead were identified as Petty Officer 3rd

Class Richard E. Childress, 22, of Ham Lake,
Minn., and Airman Recruit Larry J. Brunson,
19, of Akron, Ohio.
Burnett said the bodies of the victims were
flown back to Norfolk, where they arrived about
5:30 p.m. and were transported to the nearby
Portsmouth Naval Hospital.
