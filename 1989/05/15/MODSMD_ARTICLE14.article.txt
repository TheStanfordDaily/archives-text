Kennedy's letter sends
troubling message to
minority groups here

AS PRESIDENT of a world
renowned university,
Donald Kennedy bears a
special responsibility to pay at
tention to the possible impact and
implications of his actions. His
letter to the Harvard University
alumni warning of the dangers
of "special-interest" candidates
for the Harvard Board of Over
seers raises troubling questions.
Kennedy, who holds three
degrees from Harvard, told The
Daily that his letter was
prompted by the candidacy of
Archbishop Desmond Tutu and
four other candidates associated
with an alumni anti-apartheid
group, who are running for the
five opeinings on the Board.
The basic facts of the letter
are seemingly simple and
straightforward — Kennedy
voices concern about the time
commitment required for the po
sition and the importance of
having an all-sided loyalty to the
mission of Harvard.
However, Kennedy fails to use
a responsible and judicious selec
tion of words that avoids the pos
sibility of being construed as of
fensive.
Already, the media has por
tayed the letter as active opposi
tion to Tutu's candidacy on Ken
nedy's part.
And in the closing paragraph,
Kennedy says,"I have been
alarmed to watch the virus of
single-issue, special-interest
politics — already a serious in
fection elsewhere in our national
life — spread to Harvard." These

are strong words with serious
connotations that are offensive
to many people in this country.
In the "national life" that Ken
nedy refers to, the notion of
harmful special interests is most
often advanced by conservatives
who criticize the impact of blacks,
women, organized labor and
other minorities on the Demo
cratic Party. The conventional
wisdom in national politics is that
these groups have narrow
agendas which hinder the na
tional interest.
Kennedy's reference to special
interests as a "virus" and "a
serious infection" can easily be
interpreted as meaning that
blacks, women, organized labor
and other minorities are diseases
which need to be removed.
This impression is furthered by
the fact that black leaders have
been the driving force behind the
U.S. anti-apartheid movement.
For Kennedy to write a letter in
response to Tutu's candicacy and
then use such admittedly "blunt"
language without defining his
terms is irresponsible at best and
offensive at worst.
Obviously, Kennedy is entitled
to his political opinion about na
tional politics, but what do his
comments mean for Stanford?
Does he share the same view
about "special interests" at Stan
ford?
Does he think that the Black
Student Union, the United Stan
ford Workers, the Women's Cen
ter and other minority groups are
part of the same "serious infec
tion?" Do they need to be
removed for the overall body to
prosper?
These are questions which
arise from reading Kennedy's let
ter. Offended groups and the
Stanford community as a whole
deserve some answers.
