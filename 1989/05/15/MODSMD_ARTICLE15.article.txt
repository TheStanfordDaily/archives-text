## Homophobia hurts people of all sexual orientations 
### 
IN SEPTEMBER, the word "nigger"
scrawled across a flyer in Ujamaa
enraged people of all races and
ethnic backgrounds, and encouraged
the solidarity of those of us opposed to
bigotry. Most individuals in the Stan
ford community recognized that preju
dice — whether directed against them
or someone else — was not acceptable.
Last week "kill the gays" and "gays
hide!" (along with many other threat
ening homophobic commentaries) ap
peared around campus in response to
chalkings commemorating Gay and
Lesbian Awareness Week.
I am not writing this letter to berate
the vandals who showed so little re
spect for the gay and lesbian communi

ty, nor to encourage a witch-hunt to
track down and expel the homophobes,
but rather to point out the obvious
parallels between this incident and the
Ujamaa incident last fall, and to en
courage others to speak out in con
demnation of the oppression of gay
and lesbian people.
Silence on the issue of homophobia
serves to reinforce the status quo,
which legitimizes the persecution of
certain individuals. Homophobes, like
racists, form a minority on this
campus, but unfortunately, many
people are afraid to confront this
outspoken minority for fear of being
included among the ranks of the op
pressed.
The persection of gay and lesbian

people is no more acceptable than
racism, sexism or anti-Semitism. Yet
on campus, homophobia continues to be
tolerated.
In the two years since I came out as
a lesbian, I have been aware of numer
ous homophobic incidents: An openly
gay resident assistant repeatedly had
his door defaced with anti-gay senti
ments; at a party, I was threatened
with physical violence because a foot
ball player from a visiting team felt it
was his responsibility to beat into me
his sense of morality; the Career Plan
ning and Placement Center forbids
racial, ethnic or sex discrimination by
those who recruit on campus, but
welcomes homophobic hiring because it
is "legal discrimination;" and last

year's well-known "Otero incident"
became a hot issue because of a racist
vigil and not because of the homopho
bic encounters that inspired the vigil.
The homophobic chalking last night
is just one more example of the preju
dice that is alive and well today on the
Stanford campus — a campus that
professes to "celebrate diversity."
Just as racism threatens the freedom
of all, regardless of skin color, the
silent acceptance of homophobia threat
ens gay, lesbian, bisexual and hetero
sexual people alike. As long as one
people's oppression is tolerated, none
of us can be free.
