# Equality hurt by deadline extension
## 
### 
In the May 3 issue of The Daily,
there was ad for focus assistant posi
tions in Robinson House, the new
gender issues focus house.
The ad intimated anything but equal
opportunity employment. It announced
the extension of the application dead
line for men only, with the heading:
"Are you a man interested in gender
issues? I assume that this gender
specific extension means that not
enough qualified men applied for the
positions.
Perhaps this scarcity reflects a soci
ety which frightens men away from
feminist and gender issues. On an na
tional level, the absence of an equal
rights amendment to the Constitution,
combined with the presence of federally
funded child care in President Bush's
speeches rather than his budget, indi
cate the low priority of women's
equality in national policy.

At Stanford, the small number of
men enrolled in feminist studies classes
shows men's disinterest in gender is
sues. The lack of sensitivity and re
spect given to charges of sexism on
campus also suggests that these issues
are perceived as trivial.
These social realities seem to indi
cate men's aversion to feminist issues.
Stereotypes and stigmas prevent men
from seeing that the essence of
feminism is equality, mobility and au
tonomy for all members of society.
This campus needs to be educated
away from stereotypes, and I believe it
is fair to assume that those people best
qualified to relate the ideals of gender
equality are those who most support
and understand them.
Thus if men exhibit neither interest
in nor knowledge of gender issues, why
are they necessary to legitimize the
focus house? The only thing the house
needs to be legitimate is an involved,
competent staff.
