# All graffiti should be treated equally

### 
In celebration of Gay and Lesbian
Awareness Week at Stanford, several
students drew pink triangles and wrote
slogans, such as "We are everywhere,"
in chalk in White Plaza and in front of
Meyer Library. Many of us were elated
and inspired by their work as we
walked around campus last week.
Wednesday night, several other stu
dents also used chalk to write their
opinions on the ground. Their message
was different: "kill gays" and "homo?
no." On Thursday, University workers
promptly removed the homophobic
writings, while leaving the other
writings essentially untouched. I am
deeply troubled by this action.
All the chalked messages were a *
form of speech; they even used the
same medium, and they were all anon
ymous. As such, they should all be
equally covered by whatever protection

speech has on this campus.
Their removal should be governed by
whatever regulations this university
has regarding chalk marks on the
ground, not by what we may think of
the content of the messages. If chalk
on the ground is against University
rules, it should all be removed. Speech
should not be censored selectively be
cause of its content.
