Draw results are in — and key changes in the
housing assignment system have made the doors of
most residences much easier to unlock.
Undergraduates gained about 250 more spaces in
this year's annual Draw, according to Undergradu
ate Housing Supervisor Barb Kline-Schoder. She
cited the following reasons for dramatic changes in
this year's cut-off numbers:
• reopening Roble Hall;
• phasing out the Returning Resident Priority —
next year's seniors are the last class allowed a
priority to a house they previously lived in;
• opening additional spaces in Crothers Memorial,
Escondido Village and Manzanita Park to under
graduates; and
• including the Alpha Delta Phi House in the
Draw.
Bill Georges, assistant director of the Housing
Center, said, "This is the first year we have been
able to assign all guaranteed men in the First
Round."
Of those who are willing to live anywhere on
campus, including unguaranteed students, Georges
said, "we feel optimistic that we'll be able to assign
everyone."
This year, 1,907 women and 2,278 men entered
the Draw. Up from last year, 84 percent of the
women and 75 percent of the men received specifed
residence assignments.
