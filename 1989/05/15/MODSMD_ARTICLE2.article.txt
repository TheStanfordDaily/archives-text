# Draw unlocks 250 more spots

Draw results are in — and key changes in the
housing assignment system have made the doors of
most residences much easier to unlock.
Undergraduates gained about 250 more spaces in
this year's annual Draw, according to Undergradu
ate Housing Supervisor Barb Kline-Schoder. She
cited the following reasons for dramatic changes in
this year's cut-off numbers:
• reopening Roble Hall;
• phasing out the Returning Resident Priority —
next year's seniors are the last class allowed a
priority to a house they previously lived in;
• opening additional spaces in Crothers Memorial,
Escondido Village and Manzanita Park to under
graduates; and
• including the Alpha Delta Phi House in the
Draw.
Bill Georges, assistant director of the Housing
Center, said, "This is the first year we have been
able to assign all guaranteed men in the First
Round."
Of those who are willing to live anywhere on
campus, including unguaranteed students, Georges
said, "we feel optimistic that we'll be able to assign
everyone."
This year, 1,907 women and 2,278 men entered
the Draw. Up from last year, 84 percent of the
women and 75 percent of the men received specifed
residence assignments.
Although a final analysis of the
Draw will not be available until
after the Second Round, Georges
said that phasing out the return
ing residency priority "has had
the effect students wanted."
Taking away the special priority,
he explained, has given all stu
dents an equal chance to Draw
into the housing of their choice.
Roble grabbed the top spot for
both men and women this year.
"Almost everybody listed Roble as
their number one choice," draw
coordinator Jill Ostrager said.
Ostrager, a senior and a "Roble
refugee" from last year, attrib
uted the dorm's popularity — the
cut-off point was 222 for men and
242 for women — to a "mystique"
generated after the year-long

closure. Of the 169 students of
fered returning residency to
Roble, 54 chose to live there next
fall.
Storey House, which went for
178 last year and 366 two years
ago for men, fell in popularity this
year, drawing 945 for men. For
women, Kairos House plummeted
from 226 last year to 3552 in this
year's Draw.
Students pleased with their
First Round Choice should accept
their assignment by Thursday and
sign a residence agreement, Kline-
Schoder said. Those who do not
accept their assignments by then
will automatically continue into
Round Two of the Draw, after
which all assignments become per
manent. Entering the next round
will not jeopardize original assign
ments, she added, "the computer
will just try to assign students to
a higher choice."
