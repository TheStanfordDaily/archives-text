## To serve and protect? 
### 
POLICE RIDE-ALONG month is
upon us, and I'm missing it. I just
wonder how successful it will be,
given the attitude many Stanford stu
dents have toward the police.
My own experiences with the "boys in
blue" began when I was a freshman. I
worked at the Coffee House, and I lived
in Alondra. One night I made the mistake
of bringing a styrofoam cup of dark beer
home with me. As I was crossing
Mayfield, a patrol car drove up. The
passenger-side window rolled down and
a flashlight was shined in my face.
"What do you have there?"
"Uh, coffee."
"Really? Smells an awful lot like beer
from here. Or maybe' that's just your
breath. Are you old enough to be drink
ing? Let's see some 1.D."
I didn't have any, obviously, and I
ended up pouring my on the
ground. They drove away, warnmfr me
that they patrolled every night, and that
they would cite me if they caught me
with an open container again.
The following night, I had a paper to
do. It was a rough draft for SLE, and I
knew that I wouldn't have any time the
next day to work on it. I made myself a
huge cup of espresso, and loaded it down
with brown sugar and whipped cream.
The police saw foam, they saw the
same size cup I had had the previous
night, and they told me to dump it.
"Listen," I pleaded. "It's espresso, I
swear."
"You said that that beer was coffee
last night. Why should we believe you
tonight?"

"Smell it. Take a sip, I don't care. Just
don't ask me to dump it. I really need
this."
"Don't mouth off, young lady. Dump
it. Now."
I dumped it, and watched as the
whipped cream ran along the curb. The
police drove away, and I prayed that some
drunk with really bad body odor would
barf in their car.
I stopped carrying my drinks home
after I was stopped three more times.
They even made me dump a strawberry
soda, and after that, I gave up. I kept
carrying sandwiches home, but I wouldn't
have been surprised if they had ap
propriated them, too. And I was careful
never to bring home brownies.
I knew that they knew that after the
first night, I wasn't carrying an open
container of alcohol. If they hadn't
known, they would have cited me as
promised. Any force that lis so citation
happy as to chase bicyclists with two cars
just because they ride without a light
wouldn't hesitate to give an open
container citation.
Also during that year, I had to deal
with the police in another role — that
of victim. The first day of my first year
at Stanford, someone reached into our
room and stole my friend's wallet. The
police came by, took a description, and
left.
A couple of months later, as I was
watching television, someone reached into
the room again. I saw him before he took
anything, called the police, and they came
by. They told me that they had gathered
some suspects, and would I mind trying

to identify them?
I figured on something like a line-up
at the station. What they had in mind
is something like what the Ride-along
campaign does. I rode in the back of the
car and they drove by groups of people.
None of them was the person, and after
I got back, I realized that I knew who
the person waa anyway. He lived in our
house, and I will never forget his face. I
hope he's reading this.
The fact that I couldn't tell the police
might express my distrust of the depart
ment. The fact that I didn't call the de
partment the two times I was attacked
also says something. And when that
homeless man was in our parking lot at
the beginning of this year, I did nothing
about it for several weeks.
That some minor harassment affected
me this way may seem a little silly, but
when "To serve and protect" stops at
one incident, who is to say that it will
cover all the others?
Maybe if I had given the department
another chance, or tried to understand
them, I wouldn't be so bitter. But things
that happen your freshman year can af
fect the rest of your time at Stanford.
And if they happen often enough, they
can affect your entire life.

POLICE RIDE-ALONG month is
upon us, and I'm missing it. I just
wonder how successful it will be,
given the attitude many Stanford stu
dents have toward the police.
My own experiences with the "boys in
blue" began when I was a freshman. I
worked at the Coffee House, and I lived
in Alondra. One night I made the mistake
of bringing a styrofoam cup of dark beer
home with me. As I was crossing
Mayfield, a patrol car drove up. The
passenger-side window rolled down and
a flashlight was shined in my face.
"What do you have there?"
"Uh, coffee."
"Really? Smells an awful lot like beer
from here. Or maybe' that's just your
breath. Are you old enough to be drink
ing? Let's see some 1.D."
I didn't have any, obviously, and I
ended up pouring my on the
ground. They drove away, warnmfr me
that they patrolled every night, and that
they would cite me if they caught me
with an open container again.
The following night, I had a paper to
do. It was a rough draft for SLE, and I
knew that I wouldn't have any time the
next day to work on it. I made myself a
huge cup of espresso, and loaded it down
with brown sugar and whipped cream.
The police saw foam, they saw the
same size cup I had had the previous
night, and they told me to dump it.
"Listen," I pleaded. "It's espresso, I
swear."
"You said that that beer was coffee
last night. Why should we believe you
tonight?"

"Smell it. Take a sip, I don't care. Just
don't ask me to dump it. I really need
this."
"Don't mouth off, young lady. Dump
it. Now."
I dumped it, and watched as the
whipped cream ran along the curb. The
police drove away, and I prayed that some
drunk with really bad body odor would
barf in their car.
I stopped carrying my drinks home
after I was stopped three more times.
They even made me dump a strawberry
soda, and after that, I gave up. I kept
carrying sandwiches home, but I wouldn't
have been surprised if they had ap
propriated them, too. And I was careful
never to bring home brownies.
I knew that they knew that after the
first night, I wasn't carrying an open
container of alcohol. If they hadn't
known, they would have cited me as
promised. Any force that lis so citation
happy as to chase bicyclists with two cars
just because they ride without a light
wouldn't hesitate to give an open
container citation.
Also during that year, I had to deal
with the police in another role — that
of victim. The first day of my first year
at Stanford, someone reached into our
room and stole my friend's wallet. The
police came by, took a description, and
left.
A couple of months later, as I was
watching television, someone reached into
the room again. I saw him before he took
anything, called the police, and they came
by. They told me that they had gathered
some suspects, and would I mind trying

to identify them?
I figured on something like a line-up
at the station. What they had in mind
is something like what the Ride-along
campaign does. I rode in the back of the
car and they drove by groups of people.
None of them was the person, and after
I got back, I realized that I knew who
the person waa anyway. He lived in our
house, and I will never forget his face. I
hope he's reading this.
The fact that I couldn't tell the police
might express my distrust of the depart
ment. The fact that I didn't call the de
partment the two times I was attacked
also says something. And when that
homeless man was in our parking lot at
the beginning of this year, I did nothing
about it for several weeks.
That some minor harassment affected
me this way may seem a little silly, but
when "To serve and protect" stops at
one incident, who is to say that it will
cover all the others?
Maybe if I had given the department
another chance, or tried to understand
them, I wouldn't be so bitter. But things
that happen your freshman year can af
fect the rest of your time at Stanford.
And if they happen often enough, they
can affect your entire life.
