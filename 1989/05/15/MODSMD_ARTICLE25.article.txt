## Captain Cindy, freshman Kylie a perfect pair 
### Mark Rogowsky Editorial staff 
GAINESVILLE, Fla. - Senior
Cindy Buchsbaum, the captain of
the women's tennis team, was the
Cardinal's No. 6 singles player
last season.
This year, she was replaced in
the lineup by a freshman named
Kylie Johnson.
It's the kind of situation that
could easily create tension be
tween them. As a matter of fact,
hardly anyone would blame
Buchsbaum if she decided she
didn't particularly like Johnson.
Looking for some juicy contro
versy? If so, you better start
looking somewhere else.
See, Cindy Buchsbaum and
Kylie Johnson have been room
mates during the NCAA champi
onships this week. And, Captain
Cindy has become Coach Cindy
during the tournament, keeping
a vigil on the No. 6 singles match
es. You know, the ones being
played by Kylie Johnson.
They were also the ones being
won by Johnson as the very un
freshmanlike freshman showed
her poise, as well as her ability,
in posting a 4-0 record and help
ing Stanford win its fourth
straight national title.
The player-coach relationship
between the two good friends first
came into being at the National
Team Indoors in March. "[Cindy]
helped me in a couple of matches
at Indoors," Johnson said. "She
pulled me through them."
Faced with the difficult task of
trying to watch all six matches at
NCAAs, Brennan and Asst. Coach
Lele Forood decided to employ
their captain as a coach again.
"Frank asked me a little while
ago if I'd come out to Kylie's court
and help her," Buchsbaum said.
Buchsbaum was receptive to the
idea — and so was Johnson. When
Brennan asked her what he
thought about having her captain
out there, she said, "That would
be great."
And it's worked out great.
"She's really been supportive,"
Johnson said of Buchsbaum. "She
talks well .. . she makes a really
good coach, she really makes you
feel good."
Coach Buchsbaum had nothing
but kind words about Johnson.
"Kylie deserves a tremendous
amount of credit," Buchsbaum
said. "I think . . . she's the best
team player (at Stanford)."
But she beat you out of the
lineup, Cindy. Weren't you the
least bit angry, jealous .. . some
thing?
"Never once," Buchsbaum said,
but then added, "Maybe at the
beginning of the year." But
Buchsbaum quickly and gra
ciously accepted losing the No. 6
spot.
"To tell you the truth, she was
out there working harder; she was
more dedicated; she wanted it
more," Buchsbaum said.
"She was playing better,"
Buchsbaum added. "I've had my
opportunity to play when we were
winning."
Buchsbaum even went to bat
for Johnson when it seemed pos
sible that she'd be replaced in the
NCAA lineup by the oft-ir\jured
Eleni Rossides.
Buchsbaum went to Brennan
and told him it would be "totally
unjust" to take her out of the No.
6 spot. She said Brennan
responded by saying, "You have
to put the best people out there."
But, Buchsbaum noted, "Kylie,
as much as anybody, deserved to
be out there."
With that, Brennan has no ar
gument. "Kylie's had an amazing
year," Brennan said yesterday of
the Cardinal star who has com
piled a 23-2 record in dual match
es. "If I didn't have Kylie
Johnson, we could not have had
the kind of season we had.
"A lot of coaches, when I gave
her a scholarship, said 'Kylie
who?' "Little did I know she'd be
such an important part of the
team," Brennan added. "She's
sort of been our secret weapon."
Brennan pointed out that where
oivj plays in the lineup is irrele
vant in the big picture. "Tami

(Whitlinger, Stanford's No. 1
player), if she wins, we get one
point," Brennan said. "If Kylie
wins, we get one point." Just as
good.
And Brennan likes the way she
plays. "She's a strong player men
tally," he said.
Said Buchsbaum: "Kylie's a
great player. She just needs to
slow down and believe in herself.
"It's tough being part of a great
team. You try to raise your game
even if you don't need to,"
Buchsbaum said, adding that she
told Johnson to just "make the
shots she knows how to make."
Buchsbaum has been especially
helpful to Johnson because the
freshman has been undergoing a
confidence crisis lately.
But you wouldn't know it by
the way she played at NCAAs.
She credits the turnaround to her
faith in her teammates.
"I knew that I didn't have to
worry about the rest of the team,"
Johnson said. "I didn't feel a lot
of pressure to win, except for
myself.
"In the first couple of matches,
I played some close sets and was
able to pull my game up (to win
them). I gained confidence
knowing I could pull it out in the
end."
Indeed, as the tournament went
on, Johnson looked better and bet
ter. In the opener, she dropped
the first set to Michelle Apra of
San Diego State before pulling out
the match.
The next day, Johnson scored
a straight-set victory, 7-6 (7-2),
6-1, over Oklahoma State's Jackie
Booth She won 19 points in a
row — the last five points of the
tiebreaker and the first 14 points
of the second set (yes, you read
that right) before double-faulting.
Things promised to get tougher
in Saturday's semifinal with
Georgia. Johnson got tougher,
too.
She took the first set from
Tonya Bogdonas 6-4 then dropped
a tiebreaker 7-1 to lose the second
set. For Johnson, who loves tie
breakers — "they're mine," she
says often — it could have led her
down the road to defeat.
Instead, she picked up her game
a notch. Actually, two notches.

Johnson stormed through the
third set with a 6-0 shutout.
Goodbye, Tonya Bogdonas.
The final promised to be
Jonhson's tougnest test. UCLA s
Kirs ten Dreyer, the preseason No.
8 player in the country, was play
ing at No. 6 because she had just
come back from a season-long
shoulder injury.
From a UCLA perspective, it
was a match they had to have
and the match in which they
might have considered themselves
favorites.
Johnson saw it differently. "I've
played Kirsten before," Johnson
said.
"I didn't feel like she was going
to beat me," she added, explaining
that she felt she'd lose only if she
made the errors instead of taking
it to Dreyer. Under Buchbaum's
guidance, she did just that.
"Cindy kept telling me to slow
down," Johnson said. "She told
me to work the points."
Said Buchsbaum: "I had a tre
mendous amount of faith in Kylie.
I told her when she plays right,
stays calm, picks her shots —
she's capable of beating anybody."
Said Johnson: "I got into a good
rhythm ... [and] I felt I could
control the match; I could domi
nate it."
So Johnson jumped all over
Dreyer and won the first set 6-2
— she was the first Stanford
player to win a set.
Serving at 2-1 in the second set,
Johnson was down a break point.
It was a chance for Dreyer to pick
up some momentum. So what did
Johnson do?
She simply served back-to-back
aces, ripped off a backhand win
ner and took a 3-1 lead. Four
games later, she'd be serving for
the match.
She lost the first point and then
served yet another ace. Johnson
took the next two and had two
match points. Dreyer saved one;
Johnson won the match on the
next one.
Bolstered by Buchsbaum,
Johnson triumphed in the biggest
challenge of her career. It's a safe
bet that the opportunity to play
a part in that victory was a tri
umph for Buschbaum, too.

a tiebreaker 7-1 to lose the second
set. For Johnson, who loves tie
breakers — "they're mine," she
says often — it could have led her
down the road to defeat.
Instead, she picked up her game
a notch. Actually, two notches.

Johnson stormed through the
third set with a 6-0 shutout.
Goodbye, Tonya Bogdonas.
The final promised to be
Jonhson's tougnest test. UCLA s
Kirs ten Dreyer, the preseason No.
8 player in the country, was play
ing at No. 6 because she had just
come back from a season-long
shoulder injury.
From a UCLA perspective, it
was a match they had to have
and the match in which they
might have considered themselves
favorites.
Johnson saw it differently. "I've
played Kirsten before," Johnson
said.
"I didn't feel like she was going
to beat me," she added, explaining
that she felt she'd lose only if she
made the errors instead of taking
it to Dreyer. Under Buchbaum's
guidance, she did just that.
"Cindy kept telling me to slow
down," Johnson said. "She told
me to work the points."
Said Buchsbaum: "I had a tre
mendous amount of faith in Kylie.
I told her when she plays right,
stays calm, picks her shots —
she's capable of beating anybody."
Said Johnson: "I got into a good
rhythm ... [and] I felt I could
control the match; I could domi
nate it."
So Johnson jumped all over
Dreyer and won the first set 6-2
— she was the first Stanford
player to win a set.
Serving at 2-1 in the second set,
Johnson was down a break point.
It was a chance for Dreyer to pick
up some momentum. So what did
Johnson do?
She simply served back-to-back
aces, ripped off a backhand win
ner and took a 3-1 lead. Four
games later, she'd be serving for
the match.
She lost the first point and then
served yet another ace. Johnson
took the next two and had two
match points. Dreyer saved one;
Johnson won the match on the
next one.
Bolstered by Buchsbaum,
Johnson triumphed in the biggest
challenge of her career. It's a safe
bet that the opportunity to play
a part in that victory was a tri
umph for Buschbaum, too.
GAINESVILLE, Fla. - Senior
Cindy Buchsbaum, the captain of
the women's tennis team, was the
Cardinal's No. 6 singles player
last season.
This year, she was replaced in
the lineup by a freshman named
Kylie Johnson.
It's the kind of situation that
could easily create tension be
tween them. As a matter of fact,
hardly anyone would blame
Buchsbaum if she decided she
didn't particularly like Johnson.
Looking for some juicy contro
versy? If so, you better start
looking somewhere else.
See, Cindy Buchsbaum and
Kylie Johnson have been room
mates during the NCAA champi
onships this week. And, Captain
Cindy has become Coach Cindy
during the tournament, keeping
a vigil on the No. 6 singles match
es. You know, the ones being
played by Kylie Johnson.
They were also the ones being
won by Johnson as the very un
freshmanlike freshman showed
her poise, as well as her ability,
in posting a 4-0 record and help
ing Stanford win its fourth
straight national title.
The player-coach relationship
between the two good friends first
came into being at the National
Team Indoors in March. "[Cindy]
helped me in a couple of matches
at Indoors," Johnson said. "She
pulled me through them."
Faced with the difficult task of
trying to watch all six matches at
NCAAs, Brennan and Asst. Coach
Lele Forood decided to employ
their captain as a coach again.
"Frank asked me a little while
ago if I'd come out to Kylie's court
and help her," Buchsbaum said.
Buchsbaum was receptive to the
idea — and so was Johnson. When
Brennan asked her what he
thought about having her captain
out there, she said, "That would
be great."
And it's worked out great.
"She's really been supportive,"
Johnson said of Buchsbaum. "She
talks well .. . she makes a really
good coach, she really makes you
feel good."
Coach Buchsbaum had nothing
but kind words about Johnson.
"Kylie deserves a tremendous
amount of credit," Buchsbaum
said. "I think . . . she's the best
team player (at Stanford)."
But she beat you out of the
lineup, Cindy. Weren't you the
least bit angry, jealous .. . some
thing?
"Never once," Buchsbaum said,
but then added, "Maybe at the
beginning of the year." But
Buchsbaum quickly and gra
ciously accepted losing the No. 6
spot.
"To tell you the truth, she was
out there working harder; she was
more dedicated; she wanted it
more," Buchsbaum said.
"She was playing better,"
Buchsbaum added. "I've had my
opportunity to play when we were
winning."
Buchsbaum even went to bat
for Johnson when it seemed pos
sible that she'd be replaced in the
NCAA lineup by the oft-ir\jured
Eleni Rossides.
Buchsbaum went to Brennan
and told him it would be "totally
unjust" to take her out of the No.
6 spot. She said Brennan
responded by saying, "You have
to put the best people out there."
But, Buchsbaum noted, "Kylie,
as much as anybody, deserved to
be out there."
With that, Brennan has no ar
gument. "Kylie's had an amazing
year," Brennan said yesterday of
the Cardinal star who has com
piled a 23-2 record in dual match
es. "If I didn't have Kylie
Johnson, we could not have had
the kind of season we had.
"A lot of coaches, when I gave
her a scholarship, said 'Kylie
who?' "Little did I know she'd be
such an important part of the
team," Brennan added. "She's
sort of been our secret weapon."
Brennan pointed out that where
oivj plays in the lineup is irrele
vant in the big picture. "Tami

(Whitlinger, Stanford's No. 1
player), if she wins, we get one
point," Brennan said. "If Kylie
wins, we get one point." Just as
good.
And Brennan likes the way she
plays. "She's a strong player men
tally," he said.
Said Buchsbaum: "Kylie's a
great player. She just needs to
slow down and believe in herself.
"It's tough being part of a great
team. You try to raise your game
even if you don't need to,"
Buchsbaum said, adding that she
told Johnson to just "make the
shots she knows how to make."
Buchsbaum has been especially
helpful to Johnson because the
freshman has been undergoing a
confidence crisis lately.
But you wouldn't know it by
the way she played at NCAAs.
She credits the turnaround to her
faith in her teammates.
"I knew that I didn't have to
worry about the rest of the team,"
Johnson said. "I didn't feel a lot
of pressure to win, except for
myself.
"In the first couple of matches,
I played some close sets and was
able to pull my game up (to win
them). I gained confidence
knowing I could pull it out in the
end."
Indeed, as the tournament went
on, Johnson looked better and bet
ter. In the opener, she dropped
the first set to Michelle Apra of
San Diego State before pulling out
the match.
The next day, Johnson scored
a straight-set victory, 7-6 (7-2),
6-1, over Oklahoma State's Jackie
Booth She won 19 points in a
row — the last five points of the
tiebreaker and the first 14 points
of the second set (yes, you read
that right) before double-faulting.
Things promised to get tougher
in Saturday's semifinal with
Georgia. Johnson got tougher,
too.
She took the first set from
Tonya Bogdonas 6-4 then dropped
a tiebreaker 7-1 to lose the second

es. "If I didn't have Kylie
Johnson, we could not have had
the kind of season we had.
"A lot of coaches, when I gave
her a scholarship, said 'Kylie
who?' "Little did I know she'd be
such an important part of the
team," Brennan added. "She's
sort of been our secret weapon."
Brennan pointed out that where
oivj plays in the lineup is irrele
vant in the big picture. "Tami

(Whitlinger, Stanford's No. 1
player), if she wins, we get one
point," Brennan said. "If Kylie
wins, we get one point." Just as
good.
And Brennan likes the way she
plays. "She's a strong player men
tally," he said.
Said Buchsbaum: "Kylie's a
great player. She just needs to
slow down and believe in herself.
"It's tough being part of a great
team. You try to raise your game
even if you don't need to,"
Buchsbaum said, adding that she
told Johnson to just "make the
shots she knows how to make."
Buchsbaum has been especially
helpful to Johnson because the
freshman has been undergoing a
confidence crisis lately.
But you wouldn't know it by
the way she played at NCAAs.
She credits the turnaround to her
faith in her teammates.
"I knew that I didn't have to
worry about the rest of the team,"
Johnson said. "I didn't feel a lot
of pressure to win, except for
myself.
"In the first couple of matches,
I played some close sets and was
able to pull my game up (to win
them). I gained confidence
knowing I could pull it out in the
end."
Indeed, as the tournament went
on, Johnson looked better and bet
ter. In the opener, she dropped
the first set to Michelle Apra of
San Diego State before pulling out
the match.
The next day, Johnson scored
a straight-set victory, 7-6 (7-2),
6-1, over Oklahoma State's Jackie
Booth She won 19 points in a
row — the last five points of the
tiebreaker and the first 14 points
of the second set (yes, you read
that right) before double-faulting.
Things promised to get tougher
in Saturday's semifinal with
Georgia. Johnson got tougher,
too.
She took the first set from
Tonya Bogdonas 6-4 then dropped
a tiebreaker 7-1 to lose the second
set. For Johnson, who loves tie
breakers — "they're mine," she
says often — it could have led her
down the road to defeat.
Instead, she picked up her game
a notch. Actually, two notches.

Johnson stormed through the
third set with a 6-0 shutout.
Goodbye, Tonya Bogdonas.
The final promised to be
Jonhson's tougnest test. UCLA s
Kirs ten Dreyer, the preseason No.
8 player in the country, was play
ing at No. 6 because she had just
come back from a season-long
shoulder injury.
From a UCLA perspective, it
was a match they had to have
and the match in which they
might have considered themselves
favorites.
Johnson saw it differently. "I've
played Kirsten before," Johnson
said.
"I didn't feel like she was going
to beat me," she added, explaining
that she felt she'd lose only if she
made the errors instead of taking
it to Dreyer. Under Buchbaum's
guidance, she did just that.
"Cindy kept telling me to slow
down," Johnson said. "She told
me to work the points."
Said Buchsbaum: "I had a tre
mendous amount of faith in Kylie.
I told her when she plays right,
stays calm, picks her shots —
she's capable of beating anybody."
Said Johnson: "I got into a good
rhythm ... [and] I felt I could
control the match; I could domi
nate it."
So Johnson jumped all over
Dreyer and won the first set 6-2
— she was the first Stanford
player to win a set.
Serving at 2-1 in the second set,
Johnson was down a break point.
It was a chance for Dreyer to pick
up some momentum. So what did
Johnson do?
She simply served back-to-back
aces, ripped off a backhand win
ner and took a 3-1 lead. Four
games later, she'd be serving for
the match.
She lost the first point and then
served yet another ace. Johnson
took the next two and had two
match points. Dreyer saved one;
Johnson won the match on the
next one.
Bolstered by Buchsbaum,
Johnson triumphed in the biggest
challenge of her career. It's a safe
bet that the opportunity to play
a part in that victory was a tri
umph for Buschbaum, too.
