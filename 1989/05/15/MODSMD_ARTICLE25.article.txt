## Captain Cindy, freshman Kylie a perfect pair 
### Mark Rogowsky Editorial staff 
GAINESVILLE, Fla. - Senior
Cindy Buchsbaum, the captain of
the women's tennis team, was the
Cardinal's No. 6 singles player
last season.
This year, she was replaced in
the lineup by a freshman named
Kylie Johnson.
It's the kind of situation that
could easily create tension be
tween them. As a matter of fact,
hardly anyone would blame
Buchsbaum if she decided she
didn't particularly like Johnson.
Looking for some juicy contro
versy? If so, you better start
looking somewhere else.
See, Cindy Buchsbaum and
Kylie Johnson have been room
mates during the NCAA champi
onships this week. And, Captain
Cindy has become Coach Cindy
during the tournament, keeping
a vigil on the No. 6 singles match
es. You know, the ones being
played by Kylie Johnson.
They were also the ones being
won by Johnson as the very un
freshmanlike freshman showed
her poise, as well as her ability,
in posting a 4-0 record and help
ing Stanford win its fourth
straight national title.
The player-coach relationship
between the two good friends first
came into being at the National
Team Indoors in March. "[Cindy]
helped me in a couple of matches
at Indoors," Johnson said. "She
pulled me through them."
Faced with the difficult task of
trying to watch all six matches at
NCAAs, Brennan and Asst. Coach
Lele Forood decided to employ
their captain as a coach again.
"Frank asked me a little while
ago if I'd come out to Kylie's court
and help her," Buchsbaum said.
Buchsbaum was receptive to the
idea â€” and so was Johnson. When
Brennan asked her what he
thought about having her captain
out there, she said, "That would
be great."
And it's worked out great.
"She's really been supportive,"
Johnson said of Buchsbaum. "She
talks well .. . she makes a really
good coach, she really makes you
feel good."
Coach Buchsbaum had nothing
but kind words about Johnson.
"Kylie deserves a tremendous
amount of credit," Buchsbaum
said. "I think . . . she's the best
team player (at Stanford)."
But she beat you out of the
lineup, Cindy. Weren't you the
least bit angry, jealous .. . some
thing?
"Never once," Buchsbaum said,
