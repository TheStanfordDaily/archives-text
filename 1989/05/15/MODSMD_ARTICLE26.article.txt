# Playoff hopes alive for Cardinal
## Spectacular pitching buoys baseball's chances for NCAA berth 
### Robert Portnoy Senior staff writer 
What seemed an utter impossiblity
just one month ago may now be a reality
for the Stanford Cardinal.
The two-time defending national
champions yesterday completed a two
game sweep of No. 14 Pepperdine with
a 2-1 victory at Eddie I). Field Stadium
in Malibu, Calif. After streaking to nine
wins in its last 10 games — including
Saturday's 1-0 win over the Waves —
Stanford is now in excellent position for
serious postseason consideration.

The Cardinal finished its season at
30-28, 12-18 in the Pacific 10 Southern
Division. Pepperdine — champs of the
West Coast Athletic Conference at 20-4
— fell to 40-16-1 overall.
With UCLA's losses to USC on Friday
and Saturday, Stanford was assured of
sole possession of fourth place in the
Six-Pac. That fact, combined with the
phenomenal finish, has made the Car
dinal an appealing option for its ninth
straight playoff appearance when eight
NCAA Regionals are filled next Monday
Last season, the top four teams in the
Six-Pac were invited to postseason play.
"I think we have a great chance. This
is very important to beat Pepperdine.
They won their ieague," Stanford Coach
Mark Marquess said. "We beat the right
people at the right time. The strength
of our league and strength of our
schedule are going for us. H
Stanford's season-ending flame con
sumed some very hot teams. Three
weeks ago, the Cardinal narrowly
missed a three-game sweep of then-No.
2 Arizona, losing 6-5 before trouncing

the Wildcats 11-3 and 12-5. Stanford
took two of three from California the
following weekend, then notched a 6-4
win over powerful Santa Clara (40-22)
on May 9.
None of these teams, however, was
hotter than Pepperdine. The Waves had
just clinched the WCAC title by winning
three of four from Loyola-Marymount
and had won 23 of their last 25 games
entering the weekend.
Cardinal pitching was not intimidated
by the onrushing Waves.
Stan Spencer (4-7) yesterday hurled
a complete-game six-hitter while record
ing a career-high eight strikeouts. After
surrendering a run in the first inning,
Spencer settled down to shackle the
Waves for four hits and defeat Wayne
Helm (6-4), who allowed two runs on
six hits. Spencer's control was impec
cable — he threw only 97 pitches and
walked no one.
"He got in a real good groove. (After
the first inning) he started getting his
breaking ball over, and the umpire
seemed to open up a little bit for both
pitchers," Marquess said.
All of Stanford's run-production was
appropriately provided by senior leadoff
man Frank Carey, who launched his
second homer of the year, a solo shot
to right in the third inning. In the fifth,
after Roger Burnett led off with a single
and moved to third on Eric Cox's base
hit, Carey reached out and slapped a
single to left to plate Burnett.
"(The homerl wasn't cheap. He hit it
good," Marquess said.
Pepperdine threatened to tie in the
eighth. With one out, Rick Her
tensteiner singled and moved to second
on Jim Doyle's sacrifice bunt. Spencer
induced Matt Howard — he of six
homers and 45 RBI — to ground out
to Carey at second to end the inning.
Spencer set the Waves down in order

in the ninth to seal the critical win for
Stanford. Fittingly, Carey assisted on
the final out, a ground ball from Pep
perdine right fielder Jolal Leach.
Saturday's win was the first career
shutout of senior Brian Keyser's career
and the first 1-0 game for Stanford
since a win over Arizona State in 1980.
The Cardinal right-hander permitted
just three singles — he walked one and
fanned six. Keyser (7-3), like Spencer
yesterday, tossed 97 pitches to assume
the team lead in victories. Britt Craven
(10-3) suffered the loss for the Waves.
"Brian has been our hottest pitcher
of late, and [Saturday] he turned in one
of the best outings of his career," Mar
quess said. "With the injury to (Mike)
Mussina, we needed Brian to step up
and become a consistent pitcher. [Satur
day] he had a great breaking pitch and
he was really popping his fastball."
With two more weeks of rest ahead,
however, Marquess is betting Mussina
may appear if the Cardinal reaches post
season play.
"I think it would be hard to keep
Mike out of it two weeks from now,"
Marquess said.
Things remained scoreless on Satur
day until the Stanford ninth, when
freshman Steve Solomon reached base
on a one-out, bunt single off Craven.
With two gone, Solomon stole second
Another freshman, David Holbrook,
then singled him home off of Wave
reliver Randy Hacker.
Card notes
Holbrook got a scare in infield practice
before yesterday's game A ground ball
kicked up and hit him in the face — it also
happened in a game earlier in the year The
bump on the head was not serious enough
to keep "Hobie" from playing, however
Marquess has never had a losing season
in his 13 seasons on the Farm
