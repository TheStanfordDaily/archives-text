Stanford's Debbie Malueg
saved her best for last — the
very last.
Malueg's discus throw of 161-
foot-4 highlighted the Cardi
nal's otherwise "ordinary" af
ternoon at the Pre-Pac-10 Invi
tational at Berkeley yesterday.
With the hurl, Maleug quali
fied for Pacific 10 Conference
Championships in the discus.
She already has qualified in the
shot put. "This was the last
meet I could qualify at," Maleug
explained. "It actually came
down to the last throw. The
throw before I was four cen
timeters off. I didn't want to
get that close und not qualify."
The Pac-lOs, which take place
at Stanford Stadium, begin to
morrow with the heptathlon
and decathlon. Both events will
be spread out through Monday
and Tuesday and will last from
around 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.
D.D. Harris, who has been
hampered by injuries for much
of 1988-89, will compete for
Stanford in the decathlon. Ac
cording to Asst. Coach Scott
Chisam, Harris finished sixth
last year and "should be right
in there" tomorrow.
National qualifier Peggy
Odita will try to oust archrival
Tanya Sedgwick of UCLA in the
heptathlon. "Peggy has a really
good shot," Asst. Coach Betsy
Riccardi said.
