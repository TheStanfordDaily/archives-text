# 'There's nothing that can ruin this friendship'

They grew up a block away from each
other, played together in preschool, dressed
up as girls for Halloween in fourth grade,
were best friends in high school, marched
together at graduation and are now room
mates in their sophomore year at Stanford.
So when "Joe" told "Frank" he was gay
last January, he was fairly sure Frank would
react as he did — with surprise, but also
with understanding and acceptance.
Joe has known he is gay for about four
years. Frank, who is heterosexual, says he
"sometimes wondered," but "Joe did a good
job of covering it up. When you're not looking
for it, you don't find it."
When they decided to draw together last
year, Joe says,"I was going to tell him if
it came up — if I started going out with
someone seriously. Otherwise, I was going
to keep it on the back burner."
In October, Joe pasted a sticker for Na
tional Coming Out Day on their door. "Frank
saw it and asked, 'Why is this sticker on
the door?' " Joe recalls. "I thought, OK,
here it comes, the big confrontation. I said,
'Because yesterday was National Coming
Out Day.' And he said, 'OK, can we take it

down now?' I said, 'Sure.' And that was it."
"I didn't really think about it," recalls
Frank. "I'm the kind of guy who takes down
posters in the hall when the parties are
over. It seemed like the logical thing to do."
Because of that and other clues, though,
F rank was "pretty well sure Joe was gay
fall quarter." But Frank was wrapped up
in troubles he was having with his girlfriend,
so neither one of them broached the subject.
At one point, when Frank was pouring out
his troubles to Joe, he told him, "You can
tell me anything — there's nothing that can
ruin this friendship."
By January, Joe decided to put that pledge
to the test. He was coordinating a dance
for the Gay and Lesbian Alliance, and "there
were lots of strange people calling who
wouldn't leave messages, so I thought I'd
better tell him."
Frank remembers Joe saying, "'We need
to talk.' I was really tired that night, but
I thought, 'OK, here it comes, I'd better
stay awake for this.' " We had a long talk
about it. ... I was relieved — I had felt it
coming."
Frank briefly wondered if Joe was at
tracted to him, but both say there was little
possibility of that because they've known
each other since they were five. "We're like
brothers," says Frank.

Another problem Frank initially encoun
tered was that "I had this long-range image
of our kids and our wives all becoming close
friends . . . That's something that has to be
adjusted.
"I felt good that that he could come out
and tell me ... I also felt bad that I wasn't
one of the first people he told, but there
were reasons for that. Telling me was a big
step."
Joe agrees: "Once you tell your best friend,
there's no going back." Joe told Frank at
about the same time he stopped seeing the
therapist his parents had been sending him
to since he came out to them in high school.
Before Joe came out, Frank says, "There
was something between us. The whole truth
wasn't out.
"After he told me, all these things made
sense — why he was fighting with his par
ents in high school, for example. I could
never figure out why someone like Joe,
who's a good student, a nice guy, would
always be in fights with his parents.
One day Frank came home and found a
rose Joe had gotten from a guy he was going
out with. "I didn't know who it was for or
what it was doing in our room. I was going
to go give it to my girlfriend at first. ... I
guess that was the first time I realized that
this was for real."
