# 'I won't convert you if you won't convert me'

When "Tony" first moved into
a two-bedroom Escondido Village
apartment fall quarter, he and his
roommate had their share of or
dinary conflicts — windows open
or closed, whose dirty dishes were
left in the sink.
But when Tony came out to his
roommate, things got worse —
for a while.
Tony describes his roommate,
who declined to speak to The Dai
ly, as "a good student and a nice
guy who goes to church a lot and
studies in his room with the door
closed. We're both really picky."
For most of fall quarter, Tony,
who is gay, was dating a man.
"He slept over tons of times and
my roommate never noticed. Fi
nally I decided it was time for
him to know."
So Tony started leaving gay
books and magazines lying
around, but his roommate still
didn't say anything. "Eventually
I left a book called 'The Homo
sexual Matrix' lying on top of the
phone. I figured he couldn't miss
that," he said.
A few days later, Tony's new
boyfriend spent the night. "We
were in my room . . . with the
door shut, with the lights
dimmed, Anita Baker on the
stereo quietly, and wine. My
roommate knocked on the door
and came in to ask me something,
and saw us both with our shirts
off."
Tony went away for a few days,
and when he came back, there
was a letter on his desk. "It
started with something like, 'Even
though you were not loud, I think
I heard homosexual sounds com
ing from your room the other
night.' " Tony says,"I thought,
'What are homosexual sounds?
Are they different from heterosex
ual sounds?' "
Tony says the letter went on to
say, "If I'm correct in what I think
is going on, it better not ever
happen again. I will not tolerate
homosexual activities in my
house. And if it does ever happen
again I will report you to the
proper authorities."
Tony took the letter to the
Housing Center the next day and
met with Carmelite Ivery, the
graduate housing supervisor. "I

laid out the whole situation for
them: My girlfriend spent the
night and my roommate walked
in on us, but we weren't having
sex, and I wanted to find out what
the rules were."
Tony says,"I asked, 'Am I al
lowed to have sex in my room
with my girlfriend whenever I
want, or is that against Stanford's
rules?' She told me it was fine as
long as we weren't breaking any
noise codes and as long as we
were in my room."
Then Tony gave her the letter
and let her read it. He said,
"Nothing changes (because it was
a boyfriend), right? . . . She said
no, nothing changed."
"I didn't want to go in seeming
like a screaming whining fag, I
wanted equal treatment. Not spe
cial, just equal."

'I told him, Tm gay,
I'm going to be gay,
and there's nothing
you can do about it.''

Tony came back and confronted
his roommate. "I told him, 'I'm
gay, I'm going to be gay, and
there's nothing you can do about
it. ... If you promise not to try
and convert me, I promise I won't
try and convert you.' "
Tony says his roommate told
him that "when he saw me and
my boyfriend, he felt like taking
a baseball bat and coming into
my room and bashing some heads.
. . . Then he said he wasn't really
going to do it, he just was thinking
about it."
After about two hours of ar
guing, Tony says his roommate
"admitted that he didn't have a
right to say what was going on
in my room."
Tony believes, "You have to re
spect the rights of your room
mate. My roommate thought he
had the right to tell me what to
do in my bedroom, and I wanted
to find out whether he did. It
turned out he didn't."
Since Christmas break, rela
tions between Tony and his room
mate have improved to what Tony
characterizes as "civility" and "re
spect for each other's rights." But,
he says, "We're not best friends."
