# Hanging the CEO by his words
## Union members protest speech by Eastern Air's Lorenzo 
### Eric Young Editorial staff 
Embattled Eastern Airlines
owner Frank Lorenzo accused un
ion leaders of "brainwashing"
their members in his Friday
speech at Bishop Auditorium
while screaming protesters out
side hanged him in effigy.
About 200 people, yelling "Hey,
hey, ho, ho, Frank Lorenzo's got
to go!" marched around the Busi
ness School's auditorium. Mem
bers of the Pilots and Machinists

union at Eastern, along with
United Stanford Workers and
Webb Ranch workers, protested
for contract concessions as part
ot a 19-month management-labor
dispute.
Stanford police surrounded
Bishop to keep order, but there
were no arrests.
Lorenzo had a police escort
through an abusive human
gauntlet as he entered the
auditorium. Eggs tossed from the
crowd hit a few police officers and
a protester who tried to spit on

Lorenzo as he left Bishop hit a
policeman instead.
Inside Bishop, Lorenzo ad
dressed a capacity crowd of 320
students and others from the
Business School.
He said, "We have people here
who have been totally, completely
brainwashed. . . . This is brain
washing in the style of the 40s.
What is being put into their heads
gets them excited about giving up
their jobs and giving up their
careers."
He went on to slam union
leaders, saying, "You cannot have
a paricipative environment when
you have union leaders who . . .
aire using every resource at their
command to tell their members
that management is this and that,
and just literally fill them with a
pack of lies."
Lorenzo was not totally anti
labor in his address, however. He
acknowledged that they were
helpful "years back" when they
pushed for child labor laws and
occupational safety. But, he said,
unions today have a new face and
"have lost their place and they
are not out improving the lot of
the workers."
Lorenzo came to Stanford as
part of its MBA student-run
speakers series. Lorenzo was in
vited by the students to speak in
January, two months before East
ern Airlines came to a 90 percent
standstill due to striking mac
hinists.
