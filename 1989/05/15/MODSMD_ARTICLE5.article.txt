University Health and Safety
officials moved cautiously Friday
night to contain a chemical leak
in a basement laboratory at Mudd
Chemistry Building. Though re
sponse teams had to cl< e Campus
Drive near the Medical Center for
several hours, the leak resulted
in no injuries or damage.
A group of six researchers dis

covered the leak at 8 p.m. when
they returned from dinner and
smelled a strange odor in the lab
of Chemistry Prof. Richard Zare,
according to one member of the
group, postdoctoral student John
Black.
The researchers traced the odor
to a box containing a cylinder with
a corroded valve, through which
the chemical gas was leaking,
