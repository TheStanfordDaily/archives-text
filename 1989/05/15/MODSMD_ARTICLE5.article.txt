# Minor chemical leak blocks Campus Drive

University Health and Safety
officials moved cautiously Friday
night to contain a chemical leak
in a basement laboratory at Mudd
Chemistry Building. Though re
sponse teams had to cl< e Campus
Drive near the Medical Center for
several hours, the leak resulted
in no injuries or damage.
A group of six researchers dis

covered the leak at 8 p.m. when
they returned from dinner and
smelled a strange odor in the lab
of Chemistry Prof. Richard Zare,
according to one member of the
group, postdoctoral student John
Black.
The researchers traced the odor
to a box containing a cylinder with
a corroded valve, through which
the chemical gas was leaking,
Black said.
The group also noticed the top
of the cylinder was hot and the
bottom cold, indicating that the
gas inside was expanding. They
put the whole box, including
cylinders containing other chemi
cals, under a fume hood, called
the Health and Safety Depart
ment's emergency number.
At the scene, Richard Dauler of
the Palo Alto Fire Department
said the leaking chemical was
thionylfluoride, a colorless gas
that is moderately toxic at room
temperature.
The Fire Department blocked
off Campus Drive West at
Junipero Serra Boulevard and
Lomita Drive for about three
hours, according to Morrill.
