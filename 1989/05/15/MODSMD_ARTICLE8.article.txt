# University policy promotes tolerance

WHEN ASSIGNING ROOMMATES, Res
idential Education is sometimes a social
engineer. Mixing students with different
backgrounds encourages tolerance, the
theory goes. But sometimes theory runs into diffi
culties, as the case of Bill McKelvey shows.
Three years ago in Francos House, McKelvey and
several friends harassed his gay freshman roommate
for months, in one of Stanford's best-known inci
dents involving a gay roommate.
"They used my bed for an ashtray, and I'd find
half-full beer cans under the sheets," McKelvey's
former roommate said. Posters were ripped and
covered with anti-gay graffiti.
One night McKelvey urinated on his roommate's
clothes. His roommate said, "I took my sweater, on
a stick, to the RFV room and asked if they could
do anything. They gave him an hour to move out."
Most gay-straight pairings turn out better.
Usually the theory works, or at least it doesn't
raise insurmountable problems.
Each year, one or two students ask to move out
because their roommate is gay or lesbian, according
to the Housing Center. There has been one such
petition this year. "Those requests are routinely
denied," says Bill Georges, an assistant housing
director who reviews petitions.
Those one or two petitions are treated the same
as the 50 or so others the office receives annually
asking for roommate changes, he
said. "In most cases, the student
is just trying to get away from a
problem."
In a well-publicized case four
years ago, one student told Res
Ed he did not want to live with
a gay roommate the next year.
Jens MacHatzke, then a fresh
man, learned that he would be
assigned a gay roommate just
after drawing into Storey House.
"I never met him. Maybe I
should have, but I was scared,"
MacHatzke said at the time. "I
have nothing against him except
that he's homosexual. My attitude
toward gays is that as long as it
doesn't affect me, what they do
is their own business. If you room
together, though, your privileges

are shared, and it becomes your
business." The gay student
stopped out before the quarter
began, defusing the issue.
Today, MacHatzke, a co
terminal student in industrial en
gineering, has had a change of
heart. "If two people understand
each other and respect each
other's views, I don't see rooming
with a homosexual person as
being a problem," he said.
MacHatzke added that "No one
(from Res Ed) would talk to me.
That's what the main issue was
and why my reaction was exag
gerated."
Res Ed currently provides the
kind of support MacHatzke says
he deserved. According to Assoc.
Dean Alice Supton, Res Ed must
both "protect the rights of gays
and lesbians, and be supportive
of the roommate."
Those upset about living with
gay roommates are asked to talk

with their house's staff, who are
trained to "listen and try to hear
their beliefs, and, when it's ap
propriate, give them accurate in
formation (about sexuality) or
suggest someone with whom they
can talk," Supton said.
Most often, Supton says, this
helps "correct misperceptions
about gay people."
The Res Ed theory that tol
erance is learned in living situa
tions can prove valid in even the
most unexpected cases.
McKelvey, now a senior who
lives off-campus, says', "I'm sorry
about whatever problems arose
(in Trancos).
"I'm actually living with a gay
man right now," he said. "We bas
ically moved in together because
of financial necessity. I've since
found out that he is homosexual
and there is no problem. He's a
good guy."
