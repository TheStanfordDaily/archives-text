# University policy promotes tolerance

WHEN ASSIGNING ROOMMATES, Res
idential Education is sometimes a social
engineer. Mixing students with different
backgrounds encourages tolerance, the
theory goes. But sometimes theory runs into diffi
culties, as the case of Bill McKelvey shows.
Three years ago in Francos House, McKelvey and
several friends harassed his gay freshman roommate
for months, in one of Stanford's best-known inci
dents involving a gay roommate.
"They used my bed for an ashtray, and I'd find
half-full beer cans under the sheets," McKelvey's
former roommate said. Posters were ripped and
covered with anti-gay graffiti.
One night McKelvey urinated on his roommate's
clothes. His roommate said, "I took my sweater, on
a stick, to the RFV room and asked if they could
do anything. They gave him an hour to move out."
Most gay-straight pairings turn out better.
Usually the theory works, or at least it doesn't
raise insurmountable problems.
Each year, one or two students ask to move out
because their roommate is gay or lesbian, according
to the Housing Center. There has been one such
petition this year. "Those requests are routinely
denied," says Bill Georges, an assistant housing
director who reviews petitions.
Those one or two petitions are treated the same
as the 50 or so others the office receives annually
