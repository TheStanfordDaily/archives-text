## Best friends

. . was hell," says Jill. Both burst out laughing.
Why so bad?
Bobbi stops laughing: "Because the heterosexual
friend I was in love with didn't have a clue.
Who was she?
Bobbi looks at Jill. They crack up again.
Bobbi Bernstein, who is lesbian, became in
fatuated with Jili Pixley, who is straight, when
they were roommates in Branner Hall. At the
time, Bobbi hadn't come out to herself and was
confused about her feelings. "1 didn t recognize
it as love until a year later," she says.
Bobbi and Jill are now seniors. They're best
friends. And they're roommates again, this time
in the Manzanita Park trailers.
Jill — who recently played Sheila "the bitch"
in "A Chorus Line," the Ram's Head spring mu
sical — says that despite Bobbi's one-time in
fatuation with her, their friendship has lasted.
"We can laugh about it now, but then it was
tough," she says.
When they met, Bobbi and Jill became fast
friends. But as Bobbi's attraction to Jill increased,
the friendship deteriorated. Bobbi says she "was
intensely jealous" of Jill's boyfriend. "1 was always
really rude to him," she says.
"She made it clear she didn't approve of me
going out with him. She'd do things like —" Jill
stops and turns to Bobbi. "Should I tell about
the Infamous Pillow Incident?"

"Oh, what the hell, tell it," Bobbi says.
"OK. My boyfriend and 1 were sitting in my
room. We were just talking, leaning against this
big throw pillow. Bobbi comes into the room, and
she grabs the pillow out from under us, and she
leaves. She didn't say a thing."
Bobbi laughs. "God, 1 was miserable. 1 was
pathetic."

By spring quarter, Bobbi and Jill weren't speak
ing. Worse still, they ended up as roommates
sophomore year. "It was not by choice," says Bobbi.
They were part of a five-member group that drew
into Alpha Sig, a house in the Cowell Cluster that

only had doubles available.
Through the luck of the Draw,
Bobbi and Jill were stuck with
each other.
Living with Bobbi sophomore
year wasn't nearly as bad as the
year before, Jill says.
Bobbi explains that she had got
ten over Jill the previous summer,
when she had her first relation
ship with another woman.
"She was incredibly attractive,"
Bobbi says."It helped me get over

Jill. (Jill and 1) were still tentative
around each other, but I didn't
feel like my heart was in danger."
As the tension relieved, the friend
ship grew stronger.
Halfway through sophomore
year Bobbi, who Jill affectionately
calls "Dudie," decided to come out
to her. They were talking very
late one night in their room, sit
ting on the same throw pillow
that Bobbi had pulled out from
under Jill and her boyfriend a
year earlier.
Jill says,"I wasn't 100 percent
sure, but I pretty much knew she
was going to tell me."

Jill finally asked, "Is there any
thing I can say to make this
easier?" There was a long pause.
"I'm gay."
"That's cool, Dudie."
The next year Jill and Bobbi
lived in different houses. One af
ternoon they were "sitting around
with a friend from Branner,
talking about what ridiculous
freshmen we were," Jill says.
That was when Bobbi told Jill
she once had a crush on her. "It's
the only time I've literally floored
someone," Bobbi says. "She fell
on the floor. It was divine."
Jill says, "She said it like it was

so casual, it was this 'oh, by the
way' thing. I really hadn't figured
it out."
That revelation made things "a
little weird for a couple days,"
Bobbi says, but "now that it was
out, we could laugh about it."
As Bobbi and Jill near gradua
tion, they're spending a lot of time
reminiscing and "just talking,"
Jill says.
"We decided the other day that
it's great that I'm gay and she's
not," Bobbi says. "There's no
competition between us for
anyone. We can talk about rela
tionships and be completely

open.
Bobbi and her girlfriend have
gone out for "six months and a
day," she says.
Jill recently broke up with her
boyfriend of five months. "Just to
complete this cycle from hell," she
says, ' It was the same guy from
freshman year."
After Stanford, Jill, a drama
hopes to act professionally.
Next year she will attend The
Neighborhood Playhouse, a well
known theater school in New
York. Bobbi, an anthropology
has been applying to teach
in private high schools. Her wall,

she says, is "papered with rejec
tion letters."
Bobbi's and Jill's families are
throwing a picnic for them at
graduation, when they'll say good
bye. Before that, they'll spend a
little time alone, Bobbi says. "We
have a date on Thursday, before
our families get here, to go out
and cry."

under Jill and her boyfriend a
year earlier.
Jill says,"I wasn't 100 percent
sure, but I pretty much knew she
was going to tell me."

Jill finally asked, "Is there any
thing I can say to make this
easier?" There was a long pause.
"I'm gay."
"That's cool, Dudie."
The next year Jill and Bobbi
lived in different houses. One af
ternoon they were "sitting around
with a friend from Branner,
talking about what ridiculous
freshmen we were," Jill says.
That was when Bobbi told Jill
she once had a crush on her. "It's
the only time I've literally floored
someone," Bobbi says. "She fell
on the floor. It was divine."
Jill says, "She said it like it was

so casual, it was this 'oh, by the
way' thing. I really hadn't figured
it out."
That revelation made things "a
little weird for a couple days,"
Bobbi says, but "now that it was
out, we could laugh about it."
As Bobbi and Jill near gradua
tion, they're spending a lot of time
reminiscing and "just talking,"
Jill says.
"We decided the other day that
it's great that I'm gay and she's
not," Bobbi says. "There's no
competition between us for
anyone. We can talk about rela
tionships and be completely

open.
Bobbi and her girlfriend have
gone out for "six months and a
day," she says.
Jill recently broke up with her
boyfriend of five months. "Just to
complete this cycle from hell," she
says, ' It was the same guy from
freshman year."
After Stanford, Jill, a drama
hopes to act professionally.
Next year she will attend The
Neighborhood Playhouse, a well
known theater school in New
York. Bobbi, an anthropology
has been applying to teach
in private high schools. Her wall,

she says, is "papered with rejec
tion letters."
Bobbi's and Jill's families are
throwing a picnic for them at
graduation, when they'll say good
bye. Before that, they'll spend a
little time alone, Bobbi says. "We
have a date on Thursday, before
our families get here, to go out
and cry."

"Frosh year . . ." says Bobbi, starting to giggle.
. . was hell," says Jill. Both burst out laughing.
Why so bad?
Bobbi stops laughing: "Because the heterosexual
friend I was in love with didn't have a clue.
Who was she?
Bobbi looks at Jill. They crack up again.
Bobbi Bernstein, who is lesbian, became in
fatuated with Jili Pixley, who is straight, when
they were roommates in Branner Hall. At the
time, Bobbi hadn't come out to herself and was
confused about her feelings. "1 didn t recognize
it as love until a year later," she says.
Bobbi and Jill are now seniors. They're best
friends. And they're roommates again, this time
in the Manzanita Park trailers.
Jill — who recently played Sheila "the bitch"
in "A Chorus Line," the Ram's Head spring mu
sical — says that despite Bobbi's one-time in
fatuation with her, their friendship has lasted.
"We can laugh about it now, but then it was
tough," she says.
When they met, Bobbi and Jill became fast
friends. But as Bobbi's attraction to Jill increased,
the friendship deteriorated. Bobbi says she "was
intensely jealous" of Jill's boyfriend. "1 was always
really rude to him," she says.
"She made it clear she didn't approve of me
going out with him. She'd do things like —" Jill
stops and turns to Bobbi. "Should I tell about
the Infamous Pillow Incident?"

"Oh, what the hell, tell it," Bobbi says.
"OK. My boyfriend and 1 were sitting in my
room. We were just talking, leaning against this
big throw pillow. Bobbi comes into the room, and
she grabs the pillow out from under us, and she
leaves. She didn't say a thing."
Bobbi laughs. "God, 1 was miserable. 1 was
pathetic."

By spring quarter, Bobbi and Jill weren't speak
ing. Worse still, they ended up as roommates
sophomore year. "It was not by choice," says Bobbi.
They were part of a five-member group that drew
into Alpha Sig, a house in the Cowell Cluster that

only had doubles available.
Through the luck of the Draw,
Bobbi and Jill were stuck with
each other.
Living with Bobbi sophomore
year wasn't nearly as bad as the
year before, Jill says.
Bobbi explains that she had got
ten over Jill the previous summer,
when she had her first relation
ship with another woman.
"She was incredibly attractive,"
Bobbi says."It helped me get over

Jill. (Jill and 1) were still tentative
around each other, but I didn't
feel like my heart was in danger."
As the tension relieved, the friend
ship grew stronger.
Halfway through sophomore
year Bobbi, who Jill affectionately
calls "Dudie," decided to come out
to her. They were talking very
late one night in their room, sit
