"Frosh year . . ." says Bobbi, starting to giggle.
. . was hell," says Jill. Both burst out laughing.
Why so bad?
Bobbi stops laughing: "Because the heterosexual
friend I was in love with didn't have a clue.
Who was she?
Bobbi looks at Jill. They crack up again.
Bobbi Bernstein, who is lesbian, became in
fatuated with Jili Pixley, who is straight, when
they were roommates in Branner Hall. At the
time, Bobbi hadn't come out to herself and was
confused about her feelings. "1 didn t recognize
it as love until a year later," she says.
Bobbi and Jill are now seniors. They're best
friends. And they're roommates again, this time
in the Manzanita Park trailers.
Jill — who recently played Sheila "the bitch"
in "A Chorus Line," the Ram's Head spring mu
sical — says that despite Bobbi's one-time in
fatuation with her, their friendship has lasted.
"We can laugh about it now, but then it was
tough," she says.
When they met, Bobbi and Jill became fast
friends. But as Bobbi's attraction to Jill increased,
the friendship deteriorated. Bobbi says she "was
intensely jealous" of Jill's boyfriend. "1 was always
really rude to him," she says.
"She made it clear she didn't approve of me
going out with him. She'd do things like —" Jill
stops and turns to Bobbi. "Should I tell about
the Infamous Pillow Incident?"

"Oh, what the hell, tell it," Bobbi says.
"OK. My boyfriend and 1 were sitting in my
room. We were just talking, leaning against this
big throw pillow. Bobbi comes into the room, and
she grabs the pillow out from under us, and she
leaves. She didn't say a thing."
Bobbi laughs. "God, 1 was miserable. 1 was
pathetic."

By spring quarter, Bobbi and Jill weren't speak
ing. Worse still, they ended up as roommates
sophomore year. "It was not by choice," says Bobbi.
They were part of a five-member group that drew
into Alpha Sig, a house in the Cowell Cluster that
