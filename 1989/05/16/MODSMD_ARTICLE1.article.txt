# Students seize Kennedy's office, 55 arrested
## 
### Baldwin Lee Staff writer 
Police arrested at least 55 stu
dents yesterday after protesters
seized and occupied University
President Donald Kennedy's office
for almost 10 hours, demanding
a face-to-face meeting with Ken
nedy.
Senior Colin Hampton, a
protester who guarded the en
trance to Kennedy's office against
police, said that at 7:40 a.m.,
about 50 students entered the
first-floor windows of Building 10,
where the President's Office is lo
cated. The students ordered a sec
retary and Asst. to the President
Bob Hamrdla to leave.
The all-day protest climaxed at
3:55 p.m. when police moved in
to arrest the 21 protesters block
ing the back entrance to Ken
nedy's office. At 4:33, police broke
into the building through a win
dow and began arresting the 31
occupiers who remained. Police
arrested three more protesters
who blocked a sheriffs bus used
to hold students before they would
be taken to jail.
Student supporters outside the
police barriers blockaded the bus
exit with three cars, a mass of
bicycles, heavy trash containers
and themselves.
Herrington originally said that
the arrested protesters would be
taken to jail because of the
severity of the charges.
However, after facing the diffi
culty of getting the police bus
through the blockade, Herrington
dr l»>d around 6:30 p.m. to cite
and release the 40 arrested stu

dents in the bus.
Twelve other arrested protest
ers who could not fit in the bus
were taken to a trailer near the
Stanford Stadium where they
were processed and released
around 10:15 p.m., according to
two protesters.
The protesters have been as
signed different dates to appear
in court, most likely the Palo Alto
Municipal Court.
Police cited each protester from
the President's Office with one
count of trespassing and four
counts of unlawful assembly.
Junior Matt Price, a protester who
allegedly blocked police efforts to
arrest students, is being held over
night at San Jose County Jail with
charges of resisting arrest.
Gravest in 16 years
Calling the occupation the
gravest student protest in the last
16 years, Kennedy characterized
the initial confrontation as an
"eviction" of staff by the protest
ers.
Kennedy issued a statement late
in the afternoon, citing a Univer
sity policy not to negotiate on is
sues with students who unlawfully
occupy a building. Kennedy never
talked directly with protesters
yesterday, deferring the Univer
sity response to Vice President
and General Counsel John
Schwartz and Stanford Police
Chief Marvin Herrington.
Police first arrived at the
protest at about 9 a.m., setting
up barricades to keep onlookers
at a distance. Meanwhile, students

Police clashed with students at 6:02 p.m. on the street in front of the Political
Science Department. Despite student efforts to form a human chain and block the
road, police managed to forcibly clear a path so that a squad car holding three
student protesters could make it through. Police carted 12 of the protesters away
to Stanford Stadium where they were cited.
gathered outside the building to
observe or support the protest,
numbering from 100 to 500 at
different times.
In addition to the occupation,
protesters rallied students
throughout the day to support
their agenda. Students clapped
and cheered most of the time,
chanting slogans like "The stu
dents united will never be
defeated" and "Self-deter
mination for our education."
The student occupiers included
members of the Asian-American
Students Association, the Black
Student Union, MEChA (a
Chicano/Latino student organiza
tion) and the ASSU Committee
on Democracy in Education, Sen
ate and Council of Presidents.
Students demand meeting
The occupiers demanded a
meeting with Kennedy to discuss
their "Agenda for Action." The
agenda lists priorities for imple
menting the proposals in the Uni
versity Committee on Minority
Issues report, including the im
mediate hiring of a professor of
Asian-American history, the
hiring of a full-time Chicano com

munity dean and the establish
ment of a Discrimination
Grievance Board.
The demands dealt with other
student issues, including a call to
cancel the University's 8 percent
tuition increase and to increase
salaries for teaching assistants.
No compromise reached
Though the stated purpose of
the occupation was to secure a
meeting with Kennedy, protesters
refused a compromise, according
to Assoc. Dean of Student Affairs
Michael Jackson. Jackson said
Kennedy would agree to meet
with the protesters at "a mutually
agreeable time," but ralliers con
tinued to insist on an immediate
meeting.
"I even overstepped my bounds
and told them that I would ensure
a meeting with Kennedy (today),"
Jackson said.
However, COP member Miguel
Marquez, one of the occupiers,
said the concession was not ade
quate, explaining that Kennedy's
refusal for an immediate dialogue
was "disrespectful." Marquez said
the protesters expected at least a
conference phone call.
AASA member Julie Suh said
the refusal showed a "lack of com
mitment" on Kennedy's part.
After a 10 a.m. Human Biology
lecture, Kennedy said he was

aware of the student protest but
had no comment. After conferring
with aides for about 15 minutes,
Kennedy bicycled home, but still
did not comment.
Last night, Kennedy expressed
his regret that the protesters
acted before his Thursday meet
ing to discuss the UCMI report
with the Academic Council.
He noted that the UCMI report
was released just one month ago,
and the University has since re
quested and received responses
from more than 22 department
and committee heads.
Kennedy is scheduled to deliver
a report to the Academic Council
Thursday detailing the progress
of the UCMI interim task force,
which has collected more than 150
pages of response from other Uni
versity officials.
Although Students of Color rep
resentatives were concerned that
Kennedy was not including their
priorities in the University's
agenda, Kennedy insisted that
Thursday's report would not set
Stanford's priorities.
He said that mechanisms will
be laid down in his annual report
to the Academic Senate on how
students could express their
priorities for UCMI.
Students given options
Jackson and Dean of Student

Affairs Jim Lyons informed stu
dents of their available options
and Schwartz acted as Kennedy's
liaison. The administration offi
cials refused to discuss substan
tive demands, concentrating on
informing the protesters of the
possible consequences of their ac
tions.
Jackson warned students that
if they refused to leave the build
ing, they could be charged by the
Santa Clara District Attorney for
trespassing, unlawful assembly
and conspiracy to commit a crime
— the last a felony. Jackson also
said that student occupiers could
face expulsion from the Universi
ty-
At 3:20 p.m., Jackson made the
final University offer, guarantee
ing a meeting between six repre
sentatives of the occupiers and
Kennedy, Jackson, Lyons, and Al
bert Camarillo, chair of the
UCMI.
The occupiers rejected the offer,
demanding a direct meeting with
Kennedy.
Protesters blocked all entrances
to Kennedy's office with 2-by-4
blocks of wood, chains and rope.
Some of the original occupiers left
the building at 10:50 a.m. and
4:45 p.m. for various reasons.
Jackson had offered immunity to
occupiers who left the building
before police moved in, according
to one occupier who left at 3:45.
Police arrests began at 3:55. Ac
cording to Lyons, Herrington's
final decision to cite and release
the students "seemed best under
the circumstances." He explained

that the decision had to satisfy
"a number of tirec) cops" and "a
crowd that does not understand."
Students released to cheers
As students exited the bus to
receive their citations, the crowd
of about 200 students that sur
rounded it clapped and shouted
encouragement.
Some friends of those who had
been on the bus brought food, and
some others ran up to the tired
protesters, giving them hugs or
"high-fives."
Many of the students, who had
been on the bus for two hours,
said they considered the day-long
protest a success.
Freshman Joy St. John said she
considered the protest a "victory"
that showed student power.
Upon leaving the bus, COP
member Stacey Leyton said that
while she was on the bus, "she
was excited to see all the people
out there."
What happens now
History Prof. Clay Carson
issued a statement in the name
of 12 professors who "deplore the
use of police on campus as a first
resort in the current student dem
onstrations." The faculty called
on Kennedy to "negotiate in good
faith" with the students.
Kennedy said the earliest pos
sible meeting with the protesters
would be sometime next week,
rescinding the offer of a meeting
at the first mutually advanta
geous time, which was contigent
on protesters voluntarily leaving

the building.
As the last remaining students
cheered the bus's leaving, some
students held a meeting in the
front of Kennedy's office, using a
microphone to pronounce the
protest a success. They also an
nounced a rally that will take
place in White Plaza today at
noon.
Officials frustrated
University officials expressed
frustration that their actions were
not being recognized or taken
seriously by campus minority
communities. UCMI member Ray
Bachetti said the occupation
"denigrated" the two years of
work that he and other committee
members devoted to presenting a
"deep and thoughtful" response
to the problems campus minori
ties face.
Jackson said the University has
been "working at a breakneck
speed" in getting department re
sponses within two weeks of the
report's release. He added that
Kennedy's report Thursday will
include "very positive" responses
by most chairs and "specific
timetables" for implementing
change.
Vice President of Public Affairs
Bob Freelen said the protest
showed a "misperception of power
and process" on the part of the
student activists. Freelen ex
plained that departments are re
sponsible for developing their own
set of priorities; Kennedy does not
plan to make the decisions him
self.
