### Baldwin Lee Staff writer 
Police arrested at least 55 stu
dents yesterday after protesters
seized and occupied University
President Donald Kennedy's office
for almost 10 hours, demanding
a face-to-face meeting with Ken
nedy.
Senior Colin Hampton, a
protester who guarded the en
trance to Kennedy's office against
police, said that at 7:40 a.m.,
about 50 students entered the
first-floor windows of Building 10,
where the President's Office is lo
cated. The students ordered a sec
retary and Asst. to the President
Bob Hamrdla to leave.
The all-day protest climaxed at
3:55 p.m. when police moved in
to arrest the 21 protesters block
ing the back entrance to Ken
nedy's office. At 4:33, police broke
into the building through a win
dow and began arresting the 31
occupiers who remained. Police
arrested three more protesters
who blocked a sheriffs bus used
to hold students before they would
be taken to jail.
Student supporters outside the
police barriers blockaded the bus
exit with three cars, a mass of
bicycles, heavy trash containers
and themselves.
Herrington originally said that
the arrested protesters would be
taken to jail because of the
severity of the charges.
However, after facing the diffi
culty of getting the police bus
through the blockade, Herrington
dr l»>d around 6:30 p.m. to cite
and release the 40 arrested stu

dents in the bus.
Twelve other arrested protest
ers who could not fit in the bus
were taken to a trailer near the
Stanford Stadium where they
were processed and released
around 10:15 p.m., according to
two protesters.
The protesters have been as
signed different dates to appear
in court, most likely the Palo Alto
Municipal Court.
Police cited each protester from
the President's Office with one
count of trespassing and four
counts of unlawful assembly.
Junior Matt Price, a protester who
allegedly blocked police efforts to
arrest students, is being held over
night at San Jose County Jail with
charges of resisting arrest.
Gravest in 16 years
Calling the occupation the
gravest student protest in the last
16 years, Kennedy characterized
the initial confrontation as an
"eviction" of staff by the protest
ers.
Kennedy issued a statement late
in the afternoon, citing a Univer
sity policy not to negotiate on is
sues with students who unlawfully
occupy a building. Kennedy never
talked directly with protesters
yesterday, deferring the Univer
sity response to Vice President
and General Counsel John
Schwartz and Stanford Police
Chief Marvin Herrington.
Police first arrived at the
protest at about 9 a.m., setting
up barricades to keep onlookers
at a distance. Meanwhile, students

Police clashed with students at 6:02 p.m. on the street in front of the Political
Science Department. Despite student efforts to form a human chain and block the
road, police managed to forcibly clear a path so that a squad car holding three
student protesters could make it through. Police carted 12 of the protesters away
to Stanford Stadium where they were cited.
