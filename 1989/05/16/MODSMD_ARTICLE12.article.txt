# Gorbachev: Sino-Soviet rift is over
## Soviet leader apologizes for his nation's role as protests disrupt the summit 
### 
BEIJING (AP) - Mikhail Gor
bachev apologized yesterday for
the Soviet role in 30 years of sour
relations and opened the first
Chinese-Soviet summit since 1959
with the declaration: "This period
has come to an end."
His hosts revised the Kremlin
leader's schedule repeatedly,
changing sites of some events to
keep him away from thousands of
students calling for democracy.
Gorbachev meets today with Deng
Xiaoping, the 84-year-old leader
who launched the reforms that
spurred China's remarkable eco
nomic growth.
A Soviet spokesman said Gor
bachev would have to cancel a
traditional wreath-laying today at
a monument to communist revo
lutionaries in Tienanmen Square,
which was occupied by tens of
thousands of student demonstra
tors.
"We regard this with necessary
understanding," Foreign Ministry
spokesman Gennady Gerasimov
said of the schedule changes. "We
have similar experience and have
lived through some difficult
times."
Gorbachev's government has
encouraged greater freedom of ex
pression at home and has seen
mass demonstrations in recent
months, even ethnic violence.
At a meeting with President

'Sino-Soviet rela
tions traversed a
tortuous course in
the past. Today we
have come to a
new starting point.'
â€” Yeng Shangkun

Yang Shangkun, the ceremonial
head of state who played host on
Gorbachev's first day in China,
the Soviet leader expressed "sor
row and regret" about the long
period of animosity.
In a portion of his remarks
broadcast by Chinese television,
Gorbachev said: "Very probably
we are also responsible for that
period to a certain extent."
Gerasimov said the two sides
agreed at the outset they would
not examine the causes of old
wounds but would discuss the fu
ture and how to help with each
other's reform programs.
At first, Gerasimov said the
question of blame did not come
up, but when told at a midnight
briefing of the television broad

cast said he might have missed
hearing the remark.
He said Gorbachev was told that
Deng, Beijing's senior leader,
wanted to "finish with the past
and turn toward the future."
The Gorbachev visit is the first
by a Soviet leader since Nikita
Khrushchev left angrily in 1959
after a frosty meeting with Mao
Tse-tung that led to the break
down in relations.
China and the Soviet Union
fought border skirmishes in 1969.
They have been at odds over Af
ghanistan, Cambodia and what
the Chinese called Soviet
"hegemonism."
Both sides agree Gorbachev's
meeting with Deng, now frail and
semi-retired, will restore normal
government relations and ties be
tween the two Communist parties.
They also have expressed confi
dence about increased economic,
cultural and academic contacts.
In a banquet toast last night,
Gorbachev said: "The way toward
this meeting was not an easy one.
It required from both sides wis
dom, responsibility and persever
ance in removing the negative ag
gravations and prejudices that
marred our relations for so many
years."
Yang agreed "Sino-Soviet rela
tions traversed a tortuous course
in the past" and said: "Today we

have come to a new starting
point."
Gorbachev also said "improve
ment of Soviet-Chinese relations
is not directed against any third
country. In the final analysis, the
entire world community stands to
gain from that improvement."
The United States, which ben
efited strategically from the split
between the nations it once re
garded as its main adversaries,
now says improved Soviet-
Chinese relations contribute to
world stability.
Occupation of Tienanmen
Square by up to 150,000 student
hunger strikers, supporters and
bystanders disrupted the summit
schedule from the start. The
square is the symbolic center of
Chinese power and the customary
site for official welcoming cere
monies.
Authorities threatened to clear
it with force if the demonstrators
refused to leave, but were clearly
reluctant to risk bloodshed on the
visit by Gorbachev.
Officials moved the welcoming
ceremony to the airport and Gor
bachev's motorcade, which was to
have passed the square, took a
detour when thousands of people
surged past police lines onto the
broad boulevard in front of the
Forbidden City.
