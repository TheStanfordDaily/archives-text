# Los Angeles public schools paralyzed by teachers' strike
## 
### 
LOS ANGELES (AP) - More
than 20,000 teachers in the na
tion's second-largest school dis
trict went on strike yesterday, de
manding more pay and more say
in running schools.
As many as half the district's
594,000 students stayed home or
walked out of class at the 600
schools in the 700-square-mile Los
Angeles district. It was the first
strike in 19 years for the district,
which has five weeks of classes
remaining.
About 500 hastily hired sub
stitutes and another 500 admin
istrators joined teachers who
crossed picket lines and regular
substitutes.
Teachers were asked by their
union to withhold grades and at
tendance records from the dis
trict, which demanded the files
by yesterday or threatened to dock
pay.
Incidents such as blocked
entrances and a substitute teacher
running her car into a fence were
reported, but there were no ar
rests or injuries.
Students who reported to class
faced a slow day.

"We're going to be stuck in a
gym. All we're gonna do is sit and
vegetate," said Maureen Lim, a
15-year-old Hamilton High School
freshman, as teachers marched in
front of the building.
School board president Roberta
Weintraub said 20,000 to 22,000
teachers failed to report out of
32,000. With half the schools
reporting, there were 187,000 stu
dents absent, leading to a
projected absentee rate of at least
50 percent.
Weintraub said the district has
made the best offer, and"the ball
is in the union's court."
Wayne Johnson, president of
United Teachers-Los Angeles,
which represents 22,000 of the
district's teachers, nurses and
counselors, called administrators'
promises to keep schools operating
with substitutes "a joke, at best."
Johnson said more informal
talks would take place, but no
formal negotiations were set.
"I'm hopeful that it won't go
more than two or three days," he
said of the strike.
The district most recently of
fered a 21.5 percent raise over

three years. It also offered to set
up councils giving teachers a
greater role in the curriculum.
The union says administrators
would still have too much power
since teachers are the ones blamed
when students perform poorly.
Teachers' salaries range from a
beginning $23,440 to $43,319 for
those with doctorates, 98 extra
course units and 19 years' expe
rience.
The teachers want a 21 percent
raise over two years and relief
from unpaid duties such as play
ground patrol and staff meetings.
In March they overwhelmingly
rejected an offer for a 20 percent
pay raise over three years.
Negotiations by then had dead
locked and the dispute was sub
mitted to a state fact-finder, who
will present a report tomorrow.
State schools chief William
Honig accused the union of strik
ing too hastily in order to use
grades to force a settlement.
Senior David Stillman, sitting
idle on the steps of Hamilton
High, where he will be valedic
torian, said, "I am upset with the
teachers for using us a pawns."
