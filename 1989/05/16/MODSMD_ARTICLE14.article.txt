# PLO rejects peace plan

NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) - The exec
utive committee of the PLO said yes
terday a peace plan approved by the
Israeli Cabinet was a farce that ignored
Palestinians' right to a independent
homeland.
The 15-member committee also called
the plan flawed, saying it did not include
Israeli withdrawal from the occupied ter
ritories, addressed the plan to Jordan,
and ignored the Palestine Liberation Or
ganization as the representative of the
Palestinian people.
"The committee sees that this pro
posal does not concern the Palestinian
people because it fails to recognize their
existence as a nation," the committee
said in a statement after a meeting at
their headquarters in Tunis, Tunisia.
It said Palestinians in the occupied
West Bank and Gaza Strip would con
tinue their 17-month-old uprising. The
violence has killed 475 Palestinians and
21 Israelis.

The Arabic-language statement was
sent to The Associated Press in Nicosia.
The committee is lead by PLO chairman
Yasser Arafat and includes representa
tives from various Palestinian groups.
The plan rejected negotiations with
the PLO and sidestepped controversial
points such as foreign supervision of the
elections, participation of 140,000 Arabs
in east Jerusalem and a timetable for
the balloting.
Israel has been under world pressure
to adopt a peace plan since the PLO
decided last November to renounce ter
rorism and recognize Israel's right to
exist.
The PLO statement said Shamir's
plan did not take into account all the
international resolutions, including U.N.
Security Council resolutions 242 and
338, calling for withdrawal of Israeli
forces from Arab lands occupied since
the 1967 Arab-Israeli war.
