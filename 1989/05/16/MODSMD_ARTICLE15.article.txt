# Bush presents anti-crime agenda
## President bans imported assault weapons, calls for more prisons 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - President
Bush proposed a $1.2 billion anti-crime
plan yesterday to build more prison
cells, toughen sentencing for gun-relatt»d
crimes and ban semiautomatic ammu
nition clips of more than 15 rounds in
an effort to "take back the streets" from
criminals.
He declined to call for a ban on U.S.-
produced semiautomatic assault rifles
— a favorite weapon of drug traffickers
— but said he would make permanent
a ban on many of their imported coun
terparts.
In measures expected to be popular
with law enforcement officials, he called
for a minimum 10-year sentence for
using semiautomatic weapons during a
crime, and an end to the dropping of
gun-use charges through plea bargain
ing.
He also recommended more money
for federal law enforcement agents and
prosecutors and an expansion in the

number of federal crimes calling for the
death penalty.
Both sides in the gun-control debate
objected to parts of the package.
But Bush said it would send a message
to criminals: "We're going to take back
the streets."
"For far too long, a privileged class
of violent and repeat offenders have cal
culated that crime really does pay, that
our criminal justice system is a crap
shoot where the risks are worth the
rewards. Well, it's time we change the
odds and up the stakes enormously,"
the president said in a speech at a Na
tional Peace Officers' Memorial Service.
Bush stood in the rain at the Capitol
before an audience that included more
than 700 relatives of the 161 officers
killed in the line of duty nationwide
last year. Also present were uniformed
officers from around the country.
Two Democratic senators quickly
found fault with Bush's proposal,

Howard Metzenbaum of Ohio saying he
was "disappointed that the president
chose to limit his action" on semi
automatics to imported weapons, and
Ernest Hollings of South Carolina
declaring that if Bush were serious
about the recommendations he would
have said where the money was going
to come from.
The National Rifle Association, the
nation's largest gun lobby, applauded
Bush's proposals to get tougher on
criminals but criticized his steps to
restrict assault weapons.
An administration official, comment
ing on condition he not be named, said
some money was already in the budget,
for prison construction, and some would
be shifted from other law enforcement
areas, but most would have to come
from a cushion of "discretionary funds"
built into the budget compromise
worked out by the White House and
congressional leaders.
