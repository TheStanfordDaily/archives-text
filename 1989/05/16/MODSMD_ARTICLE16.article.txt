BUENOS AIRES, Argentina
(AP) — President-elect Carlos
Menem said yesterday he will not
press to take office ahead of
schedule, but his advisers worry
about how bad the economic crisis
will become by inauguration day
in seven months.
An 11 percent drop in the value
of Argentina's currency soon after
foreign exchange houses opened
yesterday was a reminder that
economic problems need atten
tion, but most of the loss was
regained during the day.
The austral has lost 86 percent
of its value against the dollar since
early February. Inflation was 9.6
percent in February, 17 percent
in March, 33.4 percent in April,
and is projected at 40 percent for
May.
Under the constitution, elec
tions must be held at least four
months before inauguration, and
the president has leeway in setting

the date. Critics said President
Raul Alfonsin chose May 14 be
cause he thought the economy
could be held together only until
then.
"We're respectful of the law"
on timing, said Menem, whose
Peronist Party defeated Alfon
sin's Radical Civic Union in the
elections Sunday and is to be in
augurated Dec. 10 for a six-year
term.
He said he would address the
nation within 15 days and an
nounce his Cabinet within a
month.
Speaking with reporters in La
Rioja province, where he is gover
nor, Menem said his aides "will
be in permanent contact with the
government," to make the transi
tion smooth, and he hoped his
election would end political cer
tainty and stabilize economic
markets.
Menem, 58, got 47.4 percent of

the vote compared with 37 percent
for Eduardo Angeloz of Alfonsin's
party, and 310 of the 600 presi
dential electors, the Interior Min
istry said
It said 99 percent of the votes
had been counted but did not give
totals or the turnout figure, wbich
was estimated at 82 percent of
those eligible.
Earlier yesterday the ministry
said Menem had 7,502,800 votes
and Angeloz 5,886,464 with 94
percent of the ballot boxes
counted, and candidates of several
smaller parties got a total of 1.4
million.
Peronists won 21 more Cham
ber of Deputies seats than in the
previous election for a total of
127, half the membership of 254-
member chamber, the ministry
said Alliances with the Christian
Democrats and leftist Intransigent
Party should provide regular
majorities.
