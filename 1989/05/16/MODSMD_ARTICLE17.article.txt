Soviet reformers win more seats
MOSCOW (AP) â€” Reformers won more seats
in the new Soviet parliament in a second round
of voting, according to results released yesterday,
with the most resounding victory going to a
criminal investigator who alleged corruption at
the highest levels.
Prosecutor Nikolai Ivanov won the Leningrad
seat in Sunday's election with 61 percent of the
vote against 33 opponents, two days after saying
in a televised debate that his investigation
touched on Politburo member Yegor Ligachev
He made no specific charge.
But pro-democracy activists in the Soviet Un
ion's second-largest city opposed Ivanov, saving
he used Stalinist methods in his investigations.
Other victors were reformers barred from the
ballot on their first try, including editor Vitaly
Korotich, whose magazine Ogonyok has infuriated
conservatives with sensational reports on the past
and present.
The reformers' success continued a trend
started in the first round of elections March 26,

which were the first nationwide multicandidate
elections in the Soviet Union in 70 years. Repeat
elections were held in 195 districts where voters
were given a choice of only one or two candidates?
on March 26, and more than 50 percent refused
to elect anyone
Nader wants Alar outlawed now
WASHINGTON (AP) - The Natural Resources
Defense Council and Ralph Nader called on the
Environmental Protection Agency and Congress
today to immediately ban use of the chemical
Alar on apples.
The International Apple Institute said the apple
industry is already taking action to rid the food
supply of the chemical, used to regulate growth
and extend the shelf life of the fruit.
Janet Hathaway, an attorney for the council,
said at a news conference that Alar will be applied
to this year's crop in June if the EPA does not
take emergency action. The apple industry, how
ever, says few of the nation's apples are sprayed
with the chemical.
