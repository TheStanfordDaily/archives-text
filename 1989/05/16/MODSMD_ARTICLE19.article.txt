CPPC should not allow
bigoted employers right
to recruit on campus

AN UGLY FORM of bigotry
has crept through Stan
ford's back door — and it
needs to be shut out for good.
Although Stanford's non
discrimination policy pledges to
admit "students to all programs
without regard to race, sex, na
tional origin, sexual orientation
or religion," things work a little
different when it comes time for
students to depart.
When seniors go to look for a
job at Stanford's Career Planning
and Placement Center, they enter
a branch of the University that
does not challenge all forms of
bigotry.
For years now, the CPPC has
allowed the Central Intelligence
Agency and the U.S. military to
use its facilities to recruit stu
dents. Both organizations openly
and "legally" discriminate
against homosexuals.
By opening campus facilities to
recruiters who discriminate, the
University seems to be interpret
ing its non-discrimination policy
in its narrowest sense — applying
it only to student admissions —
and foresaking the spirit behind
the policy.
When it comes to big-name and
big-money recruiters, the Univer
sity will turn the other way and
allow discriminatory practices to
go on.
University administrators fear
that if they ban the CIA and the
military from campus recruiting,
federal research dollars will be
"put into peril." While big sums
of money understandably play a

part in University decision
making, administrators should
consider that it's highly unlikely
the Defense Department would
foresake a prolific research insti
tution like Stanford. And in the
long-run, moral implications
should outweigh dollar signs.
Universities — especially
renowned ones like Stanford —
have the power to shake the na
tion, by challenging unfair prac
tices in the federal government.
While it is naive to think that
national policies will change over
night, it is still important for the
University to take a stand and
live up to its commitment of op
posing bigotry.
If University officials need a
precedent for barring the discrim
inatory employers, they need look
no further than Stanford's own
Law and Business Schools. Both
have vigorously ensured that
University resources do not go
toward bigoted employers.
CPPC Director Ruth Schneider
defends the University's tacit ap
proval of bigotry by stating that
no other university has chal
lenged government agencies that
discriminate in the recruiting
process.
But that does not seem a jus
tifiable argument for allowing
discrimination to continue on
this campus. Instead, Schneider's
statement demonstrates how im
portant it is for someone to take
a stand and challenge the norm.
All Stanford students should
have equal access to jobs offered
at the CPPC. Given that approx
imately 10 percent of the campus
is homosexual, the University has
an obligation to address their
needs — while living up to its
own pledge of maintaining a com
munity free of bigotry.
