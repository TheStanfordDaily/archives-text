What happens to a dream deferred?
Does it dry up like a raisin in the sun?
Or fester like a sore — then run?
Does is stink like rotten meat?
Or crust and sugar over — like a syrupy
sweet ?
Maybe it sags like a heavy load.
Or does it explode?
— Langston Hughes
They wouldn't listen to our
letter, is the phrase someone used
that best captures the spirit of the
students' takeover of University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy's office.
Yesterday, we, some 50 students,
baracaded ourselves in the President's
Office, refusing to leave until our de
mands as specified in the Students of
Color Coalition "Agenda for Action" were
met. What happens to a dream deferred?
As I sit at this desk inside the Presi
dent's Office, it is all I can do to fight
back the tears. The feeling is one which
cannot be sufficiently or adequately put
into words. My God, this is what all the
members of SNCC, CORE, the SCLC and
the like felt when they were protesting
the injustices suffered by people of color
in this country.
It is their struggle that enables me to
live the life I live today. It is now my
turn to leave a legacy for those who will
come after me, those who will come to
Stanford with high hopes and dreams.
Our struggle is for them, as well as for
ourselves. What happens to a dream
deferred?
The emotions that I am encountering
right now are hard to describe. I cannot
explain the tears. I cannot explain my

refusal to leave this place unless taken
out by force. I cannot explain the joy,
the desire for change, the fearlessness,
and yes, the pride that I and my col
leagues (fellow protesters) are feeling
right now. What happens to a dream
deferred?
Why are we acting outside of the sys
tem in order to promote change? Would
it not be better to try to go through the
"proper channels" in order to make our
demands known? Would not the Univer
sity be more apt to listen if we approached
them on this level?
Well, we tried it their way and no action
was taken. Black students are still making
the same requests they made some 20
years ago. We tried it their way; now it's
time for them to do it our way. What
happens to a dream deferred?
Let me describe the atmosphere right
now in the President's Office.
Downstairs, there are people communi
cating with police officers, press, stu
dents, faculty and the like, letting them
know what is going on and why we are
protesting. We are also communicating
with fellow protesters outside the doors
to the building via walkie-talkies and by
slipping paper beneath the doors and
through the windows. What happens to
a dream deferred?
Upstairs, we have people manning the
phones and mobilizing support for our
campaign. We are in contact with the
press, concerned students and faculty
members on the outside, and occasionally
we take messages for the secretaries.
What happens to a dream deferred?

You may wonder how we achieved en
trance into the building. Well, rest as
sured that we did not break anyone's
property or use illegal means to get into
the building. We simply walked through
the front doors and politely advised those
who were occupying the building to leave
because we were going to be taking it
over for a while.
No one was threatened. No physical
force was used.
I will not bore you with all the logistical
details, but I will say that when we all
ran to the President's Office and took
our seats (or stance) it was the most
tremendous feeling I think I have ever
felt. The best way to describe it would
be the word "YES." What happens to a
dream deferred?
As of right now, the phones are being
systematically cut off. Will this stop us?
NO! We have been here for more than
90 minutes. We are prepared to be here
for a while. We have food, blankets, pil
lows, books (Stanford students to the
end). What happens to a dream deferred?
It explodes!

Why are we acting outside of the sys
tem in order to promote change? Would
it not be better to try to go through the
"proper channels" in order to make our
demands known? Would not the Univer
sity be more apt to listen if we approached
them on this level?
Well, we tried it their way and no action
was taken. Black students are still making
the same requests they made some 20
years ago. We tried it their way; now it's
time for them to do it our way. What
happens to a dream deferred?
Let me describe the atmosphere right
now in the President's Office.
Downstairs, there are people communi
cating with police officers, press, stu
dents, faculty and the like, letting them
know what is going on and why we are
protesting. We are also communicating
with fellow protesters outside the doors
to the building via walkie-talkies and by
slipping paper beneath the doors and
through the windows. What happens to
a dream deferred?
Upstairs, we have people manning the
phones and mobilizing support for our
campaign. We are in contact with the
press, concerned students and faculty
members on the outside, and occasionally
we take messages for the secretaries.
What happens to a dream deferred?

You may wonder how we achieved en
trance into the building. Well, rest as
sured that we did not break anyone's
property or use illegal means to get into
the building. We simply walked through
the front doors and politely advised those
who were occupying the building to leave
because we were going to be taking it
over for a while.
No one was threatened. No physical
force was used.
I will not bore you with all the logistical
details, but I will say that when we all
ran to the President's Office and took
our seats (or stance) it was the most
tremendous feeling I think I have ever
felt. The best way to describe it would
be the word "YES." What happens to a
dream deferred?
As of right now, the phones are being
systematically cut off. Will this stop us?
NO! We have been here for more than
90 minutes. We are prepared to be here
for a while. We have food, blankets, pil
lows, books (Stanford students to the
end). What happens to a dream deferred?
It explodes!
