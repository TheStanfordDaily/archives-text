## Kennedy belittles issues in saying 'special' interest 
### 
UNIVERSITY PRESIDENT
Donald Kennedy feels that
Harvard University is in danger
of being harmed by a "virus of single
issue, special-interest politics," if anti
apartheid supporters are elected to
Harvard's Board of Overseers.
I wonder who exactly he considers to
be a "special interest":
• the thousands of people injured,
killed and left homeless by South-
African sponsored terrorism in
Namibia, Angola, Zimbabwe and
Mozambique?
• South African mothers and fathers,
who watch their children die in infancy

at a rate several times higher than
that of white babies?
• South African black workers, who
face severe restrictions on their right
to organize?
• the black political leaders, who are
tortured and executed in South African
jails?
• the entire adult black population of
South Africa, which is banned from
voting and thus has no say in deter
mining its own political future?
Kennedy's letter implies that com
mitment to a particular cause leaves
one unfit to administer a university.
But what, I wonder, is the quality
lacking in the anti-apartheid supporters

which make them so unfit?
Should we assume that someone like
Bishop Desmond Tutu is any less fit to
exercise a position of leadership than,
say, Kennedy himself?
(I might add that Kennedy's use of
metaphors of pathology such as
"virus," and "infection," and "disease"
to refer to a leader such as Tutu and
his fellow candidates is offensive.)
Are anti-divestment proponents any
less "special interest" than their pro
divestment counterparts?
Kennedy's letter, in essence, defines
objectivity, or what he calls a "broad
perspective," to mean anyone who
holds a position with which he dis-

agrees.
Such tactics should not be unfamiliar
to recent students of American politics.
Ronald Reagan made it a point to
label groups with whom he disagreed
— civil rights organizations, labor
unions, gay and lesbian rights organi
zations, women's rights groups — as
"special interests."
Such behavior was not surprising
coming from the former U.S. president.
Coming from the present president of
this university, however, the use of
such tactics is disturbing.
