# Current proposal by SCLC will end up polarizing students
## 
### 
I write to comment on the second
draft of the Student Conduct Legisla
tive Council's "Proposed Interpreta
tions of the Fundamental Standard."
Insofar as this draft considerably
narrows the scope of prohibited speech
as compared to its predecessor, it rep
resents progress. But I think it pro
vides further evidence that attempting
to reach the problems of racial and
ethnic slurs by this kind of legislation
is unproductive, or worse still, produc
tive mischief.
By the time the SCLC has finished
qualifying its statements, very little is
left. Introduction of the phrase "fight
ing words" doesn't help; something has
to be wrong when a term intended to
clarify meaning immediately requires
three complex paragraphs of explana
tion, most of them aimed at demon
strating that it does not mean what a

common-sense reading of it would
clearly suggest â€” it has nothing to do
with fighting.
Ironically, in the three concluding
paragraphs of the council's "Com
ments," the argument in favor of using
means of getting at this problem, other
than legislation followed by litigation,
is well presented.
Litigation must necessarily be carried
out through adversarial proceedings
before the Student Judicial Council.
Such proceedings have an inherent
tendency to polarize. Yet the problem
posed by episodes such as gave rise to
the SCLC's current effort cries out for
approaches that combat polarization
and bring people together.
As the SCLC's concluding para
graphs strongly suggest, education, free
discussion and airing of misun
derstandings and failures of sensitivity
towards the feelings of others are more
likely to produce progress in relations
among groups in the University than a
series of legal battles.
But promulgation of the council's
proposed new rules will produce just
that: a spate of litigation that will
keep the issue alive, all right, but at

the cost of shedding more heat than
light on these difficult and sensitive
questions.
