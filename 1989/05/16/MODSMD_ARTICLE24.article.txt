# Why do gays use pink triangle as a symbol of unity?
## 
### 
During Gay and Lesbian Awareness
Week, I was very surprised by the
portrayal of the homosexual identity
with pink triangles. It seems remark
able that the gay community feels
comfortable using the Nazi symbol of
homosexuality.
Just as Jewish people were oppressed
by the mandatory self-labeling of yel
low stars, homosexuals experienced
similar prejudices with the mark of the
pink triangles.
I was taken aback at lunch today
when confronting a group of peers with
this confusion. Not only were they

unaware of the connection, they
reacted ambivalently. I praise and re
spect the gay community for its open
ness and simply wish to support its
struggle for recognition as equals, but
I am confused.
Is the gay community merely per
petuating the oppression of the era
(which I doubt) or is it attempting to
inform those ignorant of the continuing
subjugation of fellow homosexuals? If
the intention is to inform, 1 suggest
that the gay community clarify its
motives for this symbolism.
