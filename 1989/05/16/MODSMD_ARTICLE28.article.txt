"Intimate Matters: A History of
Sexuality in America"
By John d'Emilio and Estelle B.

Harper and Row, $24.95
Reviewed by Kevin Mum ford
Long devoted to the study of
public life, American historians
have recently shifted their focus
toward the "private side of his
tory."
In an effort to understand con
temporary social problems —
such as domestic violence, divorce
and gender inequality — social
historians investigated the past
nature of family life, marriage and
the woman's sphere. But up until
now, social historians had not
produced a comprehensive study
of the most personal and often
problematic aspect of private life
— sexuality.
Neatly organized and delight
fully readable, John d'Emilio and
Estelle Freedman's "Intimate
Matters: A History of Sexuality
in America" is a welcome and
pathbreaking book. In my view
(which may be biased by the fact
that I'm a student of Stanford's
Freedman) it is also an ingenious,
work that redraws the boundaries
between the public and private
realms and in effect invites us to
reconsider our preconceptions
about sexuality.
Many understand today's
"sexual freedom" as the triumph
of sexual enlightenment and the
defeat of puritanical restraint.
They view our sexual past from
what historians term an essen
tialist perspective. Essentialists
range back in time in order to
measure sexual repression and to
discover if men and women en
joyed sex. They treat sexuality as
a fixed essence or a biological
drive, which unless repressed by
society, reaches its proper, nat ural
expression.

D'Emilio and Freedman chal
lenge the "naturalness" ascribed
to sexual expression and dispense
with the concepts of sexual free
dom and repression. They show
how over the past three and a
half centuries, sexuality has been
continually re-shaped by histori
cal change and invariably subject
to social regulation. In short, they
argue that sexuality is socially
constructed.
In the pre-industrial period,
sexuality was defined and reg
ulated within a "Reproductive
Matrix." The proper place for sex
was in the family, between
married men and women; its pri
mary goal was procreation.
Despite the hegemony of the
reproductive ideal, which was en
forced by a tripartite common
wealth of church, state and family,
sexual deviation occurred. Indis
creet acts of masturbation or
"buggery" received harsh punish
ment. Colonial law did not distin
guish between same-sex and het
erosexual sodomy, or between
either two and bestiality: all

Colonial law did not
distinguish between
same-sex and hetero
sexual sodomy, or be
tween these two and
bestiality: All 'spilling
of the seed' was
legally prohibited as
fornication.

"spilling of the seed" was legally
prohibited as fornication.
In sharp contrast to contempo
rary society — when sodomy
statutes are aimed exclusively at
gay men — colonial society pun
ished the non-procreative act,
rather than the individual. Ac
cording to D'Emilio and Freed
man, "colonial Americans had no
concept of homosexuality as a per
sonal condition or identity."
In the 19th century, industrial
ization gradually shifted produc
tion from the household to the
factory. And as the nuclear family
emerged, sexuality increasingly
became privatized. Victorians dis
played extreme reticence toward
the public display of the erotic
and internalized an ideal of sexual
self-control.
But in the haven of the domes
tic sphere, they experimented with
new forms of sexuality. Middle
class couples sharply limited their
fertility rates through methods
ranging from condoms to abor
tion, which remained legal until
the 1870s. They increasingly as
sociated sex with personal inti
macy more than with procreation.
Within the family, the traditional
link between sexuality and
reproduction steadily loosened.

By the 1920s, complex histori
cal change and bitter political con
flict had given rise to sexual
liberalism — "an overlapping set
of beliefs that . . . affirmed het
erosexual pleasure as a value it
self, and defined sexual satisfac
tions as a critical component of
personal happiness and successful
marriage."
In the early 1970s various
groups pushed sexual liberalism
to its logical extreme. "Swinging
singles" rejected the connection
between marriage and sex. Gays
and feminists challenged
heterosexism. And entrepeneurs
supplied the growing demand for
sexual commodties. America,
asserts Freedman and D'Emilio,
had become a "sexualized society."
Contemporary moral politics
can be seen as both a debate about
sexual liberalism itself and as a
symbolic discourse designed tc
serve ulterior political purposes
Hence, the New Right links its
attack on the liberal state to its
advocacy of a "New Chastity,'
which includes censorship, the
elimination of gay communities
and the return of women to tradi
tional sex roles.
However powerful the conser
vative backlash may seem
D'Emilio and Freedman per
suasively demonstrate the un
likelihood of a total retranchment
Our present sexual order is th(
result of profound structural anc
cultural change in American so
ciety. As they wryly note, "i
sexual system that harkens bad
to a vanished world cannot simplj
be wished into existence."
If "Intimate Matters" exposes
the flaws of New Right essen
tialism, it similarly (perhaps un
wittingly) critiques '70s sexua
radicalism. Radical feminists, foi
example, embraced essentialisn
when they amplified Susar
Brownmiller's idea that men's vi
olence against women was cause<

by an innate male sex drive.
Likewise, gay activists dispersed
essentialism throughout American
society when they based political
cohesion on a notion of fixed
sexual orientation.
Although Freedman and
D'Emilio note the influence of gay
liberation and feminism on their
work, they do not fully acknowl
edge the discrepency between
their view of sexuality as socially
constructed and the popular prac
tice of essentialism sexual politics.
The field of sexual history
which "Intimate Matters" has in
effect inaugurated remains lim
ited by its novelty. We need more
research on male sexuality, on
sexual stereotypes and cultural
racism and on the role of con
sumerism in shaping modern
sexuality. The field also could ben
efit from the insights of scholars
who study culture and the history
of science.
As social historians, Freedman

and D'Emilio tend to emphasize
broad structural change in
everyday life, rather than the de
velopment of sexual discourse. A
sustained analysis of culture, for
example, could further illuminate
the psychological and symbolic di
mensions of sexual history.
"Intimate Matters" nonetheless
stands as an important contribu
tion to American historical writ
ing. In treating sexuality as a so
cially and politically contigent
aspect of human experience,
D'Emilio and Freedman signifi
cantly advance our understanding
of how public events shaped
private life in the past. In so
doing, they have provided us with
the perspective and knowledge
necessary for making intelligent
and humane decisions about the
future place of sexuality in
America.

In sharp contrast to contempo

In the 19th century, industrial
ization gradually shifted produc

factory. And as the nuclear family
emerged, sexuality increasingly
became privatized. Victorians dis
played extreme reticence toward
the public display of the erotic
and internalized an ideal of sexual
self-control.
But in the haven of the domes
tic sphere, they experimented with
new forms of sexuality. Middle
class couples sharply limited their
fertility rates through methods
ranging from condoms to abor
tion, which remained legal until
the 1870s. They increasingly as
sociated sex with personal inti

Within the family, the traditional
link between sexuality and
reproduction steadily loosened.

By the 1920s, complex histori

flict had given rise to sexual
liberalism — "an overlapping set

erosexual pleasure as a value it
self, and defined sexual satisfac
tions as a critical component of
personal happiness and successful
marriage."
In the early 1970s various
groups pushed sexual liberalism
to its logical extreme. "Swinging
singles" rejected the connection
between marriage and sex. Gays
and feminists challenged
heterosexism. And entrepeneurs
supplied the growing demand for
sexual commodties. America,
asserts Freedman and D'Emilio,
had become a "sexualized society."

advocacy of a "New Chastity,'
which includes censorship, the
elimination of gay communities
and the return of women to tradi

Brownmiller's idea that men's vi
olence against women was cause<

by an innate male sex drive.
Likewise, gay activists dispersed
essentialism throughout American
society when they based political
cohesion on a notion of fixed
sexual orientation.

Long devoted to the study of
public life, American historians
have recently shifted their focus
toward the "private side of his
tory."
In an effort to understand con
temporary social problems —
such as domestic violence, divorce
and gender inequality — social
historians investigated the past
nature of family life, marriage and
the woman's sphere. But up until
now, social historians had not
produced a comprehensive study
of the most personal and often
problematic aspect of private life
— sexuality.
Neatly organized and delight
fully readable, John d'Emilio and
Estelle Freedman's "Intimate
Matters: A History of Sexuality
in America" is a welcome and
pathbreaking book. In my view
(which may be biased by the fact
that I'm a student of Stanford's
Freedman) it is also an ingenious,
work that redraws the boundaries
between the public and private
realms and in effect invites us to
reconsider our preconceptions
about sexuality.
Many understand today's
"sexual freedom" as the triumph
of sexual enlightenment and the
defeat of puritanical restraint.
They view our sexual past from
what historians term an essen
tialist perspective. Essentialists
range back in time in order to
measure sexual repression and to
discover if men and women en
joyed sex. They treat sexuality as
a fixed essence or a biological
drive, which unless repressed by
society, reaches its proper, nat ural
expression.

D'Emilio and Freedman chal
lenge the "naturalness" ascribed
to sexual expression and dispense
with the concepts of sexual free
dom and repression. They show
how over the past three and a
half centuries, sexuality has been
continually re-shaped by histori
cal change and invariably subject
to social regulation. In short, they
argue that sexuality is socially
constructed.
