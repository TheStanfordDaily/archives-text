The fear of rape paralyzes women, restrict
ing their expression and reinforcing their sub
jugation. Although men are more victimized
in every crime except rape (Criminal Vic
timization, 1986), women experience much
higher and more pervasive levels of fear over
all.
In"The Female Fear," researchers Mar
garet Gordon and Stephanie Riger conclude
that: "Learning to fear is a process that begins
at birth for women and continues throughout
their lives." Because of this fear, rape affects
all women â€” consciously or subconsciously.
The authors discover through extensive in
terviews that women learn to fear through
complex patterns resulting largely in self
blame and lowered self-esteem. All girls ex
perience early socialized paranoia and a large
number experience childhood and adolescent
abuse which deeply confirms distrust and fear.
Even women who do not admit to such fear,
Gordon and Riger found, still exhibit a great
number of restrictive cautionary measures in
their lives. By avoiding risk situations, women
try to avoid the realities of rape altogether.
Rape, however, is real. Anywhere from one
in five to one in three women are raped and
90 percent of rapes go unreported. Authors
Gordon and Riger attribute this to the lack
of legal responsiveness, the systematic "un
founding" of rapes (dropping them to lesser

charges), institutional insensitivity, and a deep
fear of not being believed. Tragically, after
the name of the survivor of the New Bedford
("Big Dan's Bar") rape case received national
publicity, hundreds of women across the coun
try immediately dropped their rape charges
fearing more humiliation and suffering. A cul
ture based on sexual coercion underlies most
of our interpersonal relationships and our con
spiracy of silence.
These coercions result in real emotional
damage. Rape Trauma Syndrome, character
ized by paranoia and withdrawal, is a resur
facing behavioral and psychological response
that, in many ways, never goes away. Further,
the shame of rape isolates and alienates
women from those who do want to help.
The authors' interviews with family and
friends of rape survivors indicates that many
feel helpless and ignorant in dealing with a
victim. Interpersonal tensions may increase
radically. In fact, up to 85 percent of husbands
of rape survivors are divorced from their wives
within two years of a rape; in the vast minority
of cases, it is the husband who initiates the
divorce.
The female fear is not unfounded, but it
sometimes results in actions that don't help.
Gordon and Riger state that "In many ways,
then, female fear is adaptive. . . . But the rela
tively high frequency with which women are
victimized within the home by known as
sailants raises the question of whether re
stricting their movement through public places
really keeps women safe." Simple avoidance
cannot suffice as a response. Indeed, it harms
women by giving them a false sense of security.

Gordon and Riger present an impressive
synthesis of their 12-year, interview-based
study of women's feelings about fear. Con
spicuously, they do not analyze the responses
of the men they surveyed, thus belittling the
real sexual abuse of men and their legitimate
fears.
Though they oversimplify the scholarly
debates over sexual violence to reach a wider
audience, they thoroughly illuminate a vital
area of rape: the fear that all women experi
ence simply for being women. When an entire
gender is terrorized, no one can live without
fear. Since we cannot eliminate this fear so
long as rape exists, what should be our re
sponse?
Gordon and Riger answer that our fears
and angers must become a new source of
strength, not debilitation. They found that
women who defended themselves best in rape
situations were assertive and active from their
first perceptions of danger. Further, these
same women live less restricted lives and coped
better if raped.
All humans can learn this message. Until
we undergo legal reform, education and com
munity involvement, we can best cope by
asserting ourselves as humans who will only
use fear as a source of empowerment.
