# Protesters may be charged with Standard violation

Calling yesterday's takeover of the Pres
ident's Office pre-emptive and unlawful,
high ranking University officials say they
will investigate whether the student oc
cupiers violated the Fundamental Stand
ard.
University President Donald Kennedy
called the occupation "unlawful" in an of
ficial statement.
Dean of Student Affairs James Lyons
told The Daily that he was "very sure that
some action will be taken because it's a
violation of the disruption policy and there
is no way this could be viewed otherwise."
"Folks will be identified and charged with
disruption," Assoc. Dean of Student Affair s
Michael Jackson said.
The Policy on Campus Disruption, which
is "an application of the Fundamental
Standard," explicitly states that any dis
ruption of University business is a violation
of University policy, according to Judicial
Affairs Officer Sally Cole.
The policy states, "It is a violation of
University policy for a member of the fac
ulty, staff, or student body to:
• Prevent or disrupt the effective carry
ing out of a University function or approved
activity, such as lectures, meetings, inter
views, ceremonies, the conduct of Univer
sity business in a University office, and

public events;
• Obstruct the legitimate movement of
any person about the campus or in any
University building or facility."
Vice President and General Counsel John
Schwartz said yesterday's takeover was
"clearly" a violation of this policy. "I don't
think there is any question about that,"
said Schwartz, who will act as an adviser
in the University's judicial process.
In addition to a possible Standard viola
tion, students who were arrested can be
tried under California criminal law.
Schwartz said that once students are ar
rested, their fate is out of University hands.
"Students who are arrested at Stanford
are on their own," Schwartz told students
at the protest. "Once students are arrested,
the University is not going to provide any
representation for students."
In past cases where students were ar
rested, the University has never taken ac
tion to help them, according to Schwartz.
"The students and their attorneys always
ask the University to urge the District
Attorney to drop the case," he explained.
"The University has never done this."
Yesterday, Kennedy asked Jackson, Asst.
Dean of Student AfTairs Keith Archuleta
and Anthropology Prof. Renato Rosaldo to
explain to the protesters that the occupancy
of the office posed more of a threat to

A group of student protesters join hands to show their strength and unity outside University President Donald Kennedy s
office, while other students kept the struggle going inside. Students occupied the President's Office for more than
nine hours. Police arrested 31 students inside the office and 23 students outside.
University activity than a sit-in
would.
"We tried to explain that there
is a difference between taking

over, occupying a building, bar
ricading it up and a sit-in," Jack
son said.
After listening to the three Uni
versity representatives, some stu
dents realized the consequences of
their actions and left the Presi
dent's Office, Jackson said, ex
plaining that "there were some

students in there who weren't sure
why they were there."
However, for those occupiers
who refused to leave, Archuleta
said, "we will do everything in
our power so that students are
not brought up on a Fundamental
Standard charge."
At a meeting with The Daily
last night, Director of University
Relations Stephen Peeps said yes
terday's events were "discourag
ing" for the administration
because it has diligently been
trying to implement proposals
from the University Committee
on Minority Issues' report.
In the past, infractions of the
disruption policy have led to
penalties ranging from censure —
a letter of reprimand to the stu
dent — to expulsion, according to
the University regulatory hand
book. Schwartz said most students
received some form of suspension,
although he remembers one ex
pulsion in the early 19705.
Written in 1967, the disruption
policy has been applied to a hand
ful of cases, including ones similar
to yesterday's take-over, such as
"refusal to leave a building which
has been declared closed" and
"obstructing the passage into or

out of buildings by sitting in front
of doorways," according to the
handbook.
Cole said she has never had to
apply the disruption policy to po
litical events like yesterday's dem
onstration in her six years at
Stanford.
"I would treat possible viola
tions in the same way as an Honor
Code violation," Cole said. "I
would juxtapose a description of
the event with the policy and see
if the policy was in fact violated."
Cole said the only case in which
she applied the disruption policy
occurred when four students en
tered a closed session of an ASSU
Senate meeting and caused a
fight.
In May, 1986, police were called
into the meeting to break up the
fight, which broke out when mem
bers of the Chaparral, Stanford's
humor magazine, threw pie tins
of whipped cream at the senators.
That incident, Cole said, was
very different than yesterday's
disruption. "There certainly
wasn't a lot of ambiguity there,"
she said. Cole said she could not
disclose the penalties given to the
three students who were punished
because the case is confidential.

During the late 1960s and early
19705, however, the University
publicly punished several students
who disrupted classes, lectures
and occupied buildings to protest
U.S. involvement in Vietnam and
to rally for racial equality.
Yesterday's protest marks an
unprecedented disruption of the
normal functioning of University
business since the early 19705,
according to University officials.
Some officials are likening the day
to the action during that tur
bulent time.
"When I saw the sheriffs van,
it sent a shiver right through me,"
said Raymond Bacchetti, a vice
provost and director of the Office
of Planning Management. "It was
just like 20 years ago. I remember
that van," said Bacchetti, who wit
nessed the anti-war protests and
violence of the 1960s at Stanford.
Schwartz cited violations of the
disruption policy in the early
1970s when on separate occasions
students occupied the Faculty
Club, the Computations Center
and the Career Planning and
Placement Center. Students also

interrupted a meeting of the Ac
ademic Council and in another
incident, students disrupted a
Board of Trustees' meeting.
In 1971, students disrupted a
speech by Ambassador Henry
Cabbott Lodge, Schwartz said.
In a well-known case, students
disrupted Electrical Engineering
Prof. William Shockley's class in
January, 1972. Three students
were suspended "indefinitely" as
a result.
Unlike yesterday's occupancy, a
March, 1988 sit-in at Vice Provost
James Rosse's office did not dis
rupt University business. In that
incident, a coalition of minority
students voiced their concern
about changes in Western Culture
legislation. This event, however,
did not disrupt the normal
workings of the office and judicial
action was not taken.
Marlene Wine, an assistant to
Kennedy, said yesterday's occupa
tion of the President's Office was
different from last year's sit-in.
This year "we were not allowed
access to the facility," explained
Wine, who witnessed both events.

Harkening back to the protests of the 19605, sophomore Hud
Hudacko passed out flowers to students and reinforced the theme
of non-violence that dominated the peaceful protest.

Several officers from the Stanford Police Department and the Santa
Clara County Sheriff's Department tried to keep the peace. Police
arrested 55 protesters and, at times, clashed with students as
tempers flared.
