Calling yesterday's takeover of the Pres
ident's Office pre-emptive and unlawful,
high ranking University officials say they
will investigate whether the student oc
cupiers violated the Fundamental Stand
ard.
University President Donald Kennedy
called the occupation "unlawful" in an of
ficial statement.
Dean of Student Affairs James Lyons
told The Daily that he was "very sure that
some action will be taken because it's a
violation of the disruption policy and there
is no way this could be viewed otherwise."
"Folks will be identified and charged with
disruption," Assoc. Dean of Student Affair s
Michael Jackson said.
The Policy on Campus Disruption, which
is "an application of the Fundamental
Standard," explicitly states that any dis
ruption of University business is a violation
of University policy, according to Judicial
Affairs Officer Sally Cole.
The policy states, "It is a violation of
University policy for a member of the fac
ulty, staff, or student body to:
• Prevent or disrupt the effective carry
ing out of a University function or approved
activity, such as lectures, meetings, inter
views, ceremonies, the conduct of Univer
sity business in a University office, and

public events;
• Obstruct the legitimate movement of
any person about the campus or in any
University building or facility."
Vice President and General Counsel John
Schwartz said yesterday's takeover was
"clearly" a violation of this policy. "I don't
think there is any question about that,"
said Schwartz, who will act as an adviser
in the University's judicial process.
In addition to a possible Standard viola
tion, students who were arrested can be
tried under California criminal law.
Schwartz said that once students are ar
rested, their fate is out of University hands.
"Students who are arrested at Stanford
are on their own," Schwartz told students
at the protest. "Once students are arrested,
the University is not going to provide any
representation for students."
In past cases where students were ar
rested, the University has never taken ac
tion to help them, according to Schwartz.
"The students and their attorneys always
ask the University to urge the District
Attorney to drop the case," he explained.
"The University has never done this."
Yesterday, Kennedy asked Jackson, Asst.
Dean of Student AfTairs Keith Archuleta
and Anthropology Prof. Renato Rosaldo to
explain to the protesters that the occupancy
of the office posed more of a threat to

A group of student protesters join hands to show their strength and unity outside University President Donald Kennedy s
office, while other students kept the struggle going inside. Students occupied the President's Office for more than
nine hours. Police arrested 31 students inside the office and 23 students outside.
