## Whitlinger out of NCAA singles, all others advance 
### Mark Rogowsky Editorial staff 
GAINESVILLE, Fla. — Tami Whitlinger's divum
of an NCAA individual title died hard yesterday
when the tournament's No. 1 seed was upset in the
first round by Pepperdine's Noelle Porter.
Things went much better for her teammates as
Sandra Birch, Lisa Green, Debbie Graham and Teri
Whitlinger all advanced to the round of 16. In
doubles action, the Whitlingers lost their first-round
match while Birch and Graham advanced.
"I started playing to avoid losing," said Tami
Whitlinger. "I'm incredibly disappointed. This is the
one tournament everyone gets up for.
"It's very difficult for me to deal with. It's so
upsetting that I have to choose now to get into a
bit of a slump."
Whitlinger actually started off well in the first
set, capturing it 6-1. "I played a real good first set,"
Whitlinger said. "[But] instead of taking charge, I
just sat back."
Whitlinger was actually up 4-2 in the second set
— and serving. But Porter broke her. The two then
traded games before Porter won the tiebreak 7-2.
When asked if that seventh game was pivotal, an
obviously ecstatic Porter was so overwhelmed by
the moment she said she didn't remember it.
"In fact, if you ask me the score (of the match)
right now, I don't think I could tell you what it
is," Porter said.
In the third set, the two traded service breaks
and Porter got an opportunity to serve for the
match at 5-3. She won the game in five points and
completed the 1-6, 7-6 (7-2), 6-3 shocker.
"I think I will say she was tired," Porter said.
"I think that was a big factor in the third set."
Said Whitlinger: "When 1 stopped putting any
thing on the ball, she got into a rhythm and started
to play fantastic."
"I tried to take a lot of her power away by taking
the ball early," Porter said. "To beat her you've
got to beat her.
"She doesn't beat herself. That's why she's such
a good player," Porter added.
"The problem was I wasn't able to make the big
shots and she was," Whitlinger said. "I didn't think
she would keep being able to play as well as she
did. . . . Instead she got better.
"I stopped being able to finish off points. When
I finally would go for the big shot, it wasn't there,"
Whitlinger added.
"In the third set, I was always behind and battling
back," she noted. "I wasn't hitting as deep and it
started to get tiring."
What got tiring, she said, was that Porter was
making her run back and forth just to get the ball.
For Whitlinger, who had all but announced her
decision to turn pro, the loss may lead to some
more thought on the subject.
"I have to sit down and decide what is going to
be best for me," she said. "I may be reevaluating
my decision to see if it's the best choice."
Whitlinger explained: "The only problem I have
with college is I'm almost at a point where I feel
like I'm having problems improving.
"I have to do a lot of thinking," she added. "I
put myself in a very difficult position now (as far
as the future is concerned)."
For Whitlinger's teammates, especially sister Teri,
it was a completely opposite day — nearly everything
went well.
• Teri Whitlinger was fortunate enough to draw
Florida's Andrea Berger in her opener. Berger had

a bitterly disappointing performance in the team
competition and it seemed unlikely she'd be able
to bounce back.
She certainly wasn't going to get any help from
Whitlinger. Stanford's No. 5 player has quietly been
on a roll for the past six weeks and it continued
yesterday.
Whitlinger had all the shots and Berger had none
of the answers. When it was done, Whitlinger had
a 6-1, 6-3 win and a second round berth against
BYU's Michelle Taylor.
In a match that was done in less than a hour,
Whitlinger made very short work of Taylor, winning
6-2, 6-2.
If she beats UCLA's Jessica Emmons today, the
tournament's No. 2 seed, Whitlinger could meet
fellow Stanford star Green in the quarterfinals later
in the afternoon.
Green started off slowly against USC's Lupita
Novelo in something of a grudge match. The two
had an argument over the score of a tiebreaker
when they last met at Stanford.
On that occasion, Novelo won. This time it was
all Green, though, as the junior took the match 1-6,
6-1, 6-1.
In the next round, Green's serve was superb as
she thumped Arizona's Banni Redhair 6-1, 6-1.
Green will meet Stacey Martin of Tennessee today
— the No. 5 seed.
Birch had two impressive wins as well. Her opener
was a rematch with Alysia May of UCLA. When
the two met at No. 2 singles in the team final,
Birch won 6-4, 6-2. Yesterday was a similar 6-2,
6-3 win.
Next up for Birch was Mary Beth Young of BYU.
She was also next down, losing by the same 6-2,
6-3 score. Birch has a showdown this morning with
the Lady Gators' Nicole Arendt — the only Florida
player to survive yesterday's action.
Graham also advanced without losing a set. Her
devastating power was too much for BYU's Susanna
Lee in a 6-2, 6-1 trouncing yesterday morning. In
the afternoon, Wisconsin's Wendy Gilles became
Graham's next victim.
She fared little better than Lee in a match of
roughly 45 minutes. Graham won 6-4, 6-0 to set
up a meeting with Tessa Price of Oklahoma State.
The winner of that match will probably meet SMU's
Jennifer Santrock.
Santrock is seeded fourth and was impressive
yesterday beating Jean-Marie Lozano of Cal and
Krista Amend of Arizona State.
Birch and Graham survived a tough battle with
Penn State's Kelly Evren and Claudia Karabedian
in doubles action. The final score was 7-5, 6-7 (7-5),
6-2. The pair now has the bad fortune of drawing
the UCLA tandem of Mamie Ceniza and Stella
Sampras, the No. 1 seed, today.
The Whitlingers battled another UCLA pair, Em
mons and May, for three sets before losing 6-2, 4-6,
6-2.
Card notes
There are two more rounds of singles today and one
round of doubles. Tomorrow winners will only have to
play one singles match — but two doubles.
The All-Name Team had better reserve a space for
Texas Christian University's Lady Frog duo of Tory Ann
Plunkett and Margot Van Overloop.

as the future is concerned)."
For Whitlinger's teammates, especially sister Teri,
it was a completely opposite day — nearly everything
went well.
• Teri Whitlinger was fortunate enough to draw
Florida's Andrea Berger in her opener. Berger had

a bitterly disappointing performance in the team
competition and it seemed unlikely she'd be able
to bounce back.
She certainly wasn't going to get any help from
Whitlinger. Stanford's No. 5 player has quietly been
on a roll for the past six weeks and it continued
yesterday.
Whitlinger had all the shots and Berger had none
of the answers. When it was done, Whitlinger had
a 6-1, 6-3 win and a second round berth against
BYU's Michelle Taylor.
In a match that was done in less than a hour,
Whitlinger made very short work of Taylor, winning
6-2, 6-2.
If she beats UCLA's Jessica Emmons today, the
tournament's No. 2 seed, Whitlinger could meet
fellow Stanford star Green in the quarterfinals later
in the afternoon.
Green started off slowly against USC's Lupita
Novelo in something of a grudge match. The two
had an argument over the score of a tiebreaker
when they last met at Stanford.
On that occasion, Novelo won. This time it was
all Green, though, as the junior took the match 1-6,
6-1, 6-1.
In the next round, Green's serve was superb as
she thumped Arizona's Banni Redhair 6-1, 6-1.
Green will meet Stacey Martin of Tennessee today
— the No. 5 seed.
Birch had two impressive wins as well. Her opener
was a rematch with Alysia May of UCLA. When
the two met at No. 2 singles in the team final,
Birch won 6-4, 6-2. Yesterday was a similar 6-2,
6-3 win.
Next up for Birch was Mary Beth Young of BYU.
She was also next down, losing by the same 6-2,
6-3 score. Birch has a showdown this morning with
the Lady Gators' Nicole Arendt — the only Florida
player to survive yesterday's action.
Graham also advanced without losing a set. Her
devastating power was too much for BYU's Susanna
Lee in a 6-2, 6-1 trouncing yesterday morning. In
the afternoon, Wisconsin's Wendy Gilles became
Graham's next victim.
She fared little better than Lee in a match of
roughly 45 minutes. Graham won 6-4, 6-0 to set
up a meeting with Tessa Price of Oklahoma State.
The winner of that match will probably meet SMU's
Jennifer Santrock.
Santrock is seeded fourth and was impressive
yesterday beating Jean-Marie Lozano of Cal and
Krista Amend of Arizona State.
Birch and Graham survived a tough battle with
Penn State's Kelly Evren and Claudia Karabedian
in doubles action. The final score was 7-5, 6-7 (7-5),
6-2. The pair now has the bad fortune of drawing
the UCLA tandem of Mamie Ceniza and Stella
Sampras, the No. 1 seed, today.
The Whitlingers battled another UCLA pair, Em
mons and May, for three sets before losing 6-2, 4-6,
6-2.
Card notes
There are two more rounds of singles today and one
round of doubles. Tomorrow winners will only have to
play one singles match — but two doubles.
The All-Name Team had better reserve a space for
Texas Christian University's Lady Frog duo of Tory Ann
Plunkett and Margot Van Overloop.

Junior Lisa Green advanced to the round of 16 in the NCAA women's tennis singles tournament
yesterday by downing Banni Redhair of Arizona 6-4, 6-1.
GAINESVILLE, Fla. — Tami Whitlinger's divum
of an NCAA individual title died hard yesterday
when the tournament's No. 1 seed was upset in the
first round by Pepperdine's Noelle Porter.
Things went much better for her teammates as
Sandra Birch, Lisa Green, Debbie Graham and Teri
Whitlinger all advanced to the round of 16. In
doubles action, the Whitlingers lost their first-round
match while Birch and Graham advanced.
"I started playing to avoid losing," said Tami
Whitlinger. "I'm incredibly disappointed. This is the
one tournament everyone gets up for.
"It's very difficult for me to deal with. It's so
upsetting that I have to choose now to get into a
bit of a slump."
Whitlinger actually started off well in the first
set, capturing it 6-1. "I played a real good first set,"
Whitlinger said. "[But] instead of taking charge, I
just sat back."
Whitlinger was actually up 4-2 in the second set
— and serving. But Porter broke her. The two then
traded games before Porter won the tiebreak 7-2.
When asked if that seventh game was pivotal, an
obviously ecstatic Porter was so overwhelmed by
the moment she said she didn't remember it.
"In fact, if you ask me the score (of the match)
right now, I don't think I could tell you what it
is," Porter said.
In the third set, the two traded service breaks
and Porter got an opportunity to serve for the
match at 5-3. She won the game in five points and
completed the 1-6, 7-6 (7-2), 6-3 shocker.
"I think I will say she was tired," Porter said.
"I think that was a big factor in the third set."
Said Whitlinger: "When 1 stopped putting any
thing on the ball, she got into a rhythm and started
to play fantastic."
"I tried to take a lot of her power away by taking
the ball early," Porter said. "To beat her you've
got to beat her.
"She doesn't beat herself. That's why she's such
a good player," Porter added.
"The problem was I wasn't able to make the big
shots and she was," Whitlinger said. "I didn't think
she would keep being able to play as well as she
did. . . . Instead she got better.
"I stopped being able to finish off points. When
I finally would go for the big shot, it wasn't there,"
Whitlinger added.
"In the third set, I was always behind and battling
back," she noted. "I wasn't hitting as deep and it
started to get tiring."
What got tiring, she said, was that Porter was
making her run back and forth just to get the ball.
For Whitlinger, who had all but announced her
decision to turn pro, the loss may lead to some
more thought on the subject.
"I have to sit down and decide what is going to
be best for me," she said. "I may be reevaluating
my decision to see if it's the best choice."
Whitlinger explained: "The only problem I have
with college is I'm almost at a point where I feel
like I'm having problems improving.
"I have to do a lot of thinking," she added. "I
put myself in a very difficult position now (as far
as the future is concerned)."
