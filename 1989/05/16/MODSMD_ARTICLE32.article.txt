# Balance of tennis, life suits Green

GAINESVILLE, Fla. - Stan
ford junior Lisa Green has found
the middle way.
The Cardinal's No. 3 singles
player has found incredible suc
cess on the court without letting
tennis become the be all and end
all of her life.
"Tennis is really important to
me," Green says. "But I went to
college to (also) get an education
and have fun."
In actuality, Green thought
seriously about not playing tennis
at all in college. Of course, she
did wind up playing, developed
her game and has been a key
member of the past three NCAA
championship teams.
Coincidentally, her love for the
game developed as well. "I've
started really enjoying tennis a lot
more since I've come to Stanford,"
Green says. "A lot of it has to do
with enjoying a balance (between
tennis and everything else)."
The balance has been with her

for some time. In high school, she
didn't practice all that much —
"maybe an hour a day, an hour
and a half," she says.
"I was into my friends," she
continues. "I didn't like missing
everything, missing parties and
(not) seeing my friends."
Green grew up just a hop, skip
and jump away from the Univer
sity. The San Jose resident says
despite Stanford's proximity she
almost wound up at USC.
"I really wavered," she says."I
wanted to go to L.A. I kind of
wanted to go further from home
. . . have a little more indepen
dence."
But there were a number of
things USC couldn't compete
with: academics, word of mouth
and Green's mom.
"Academics are really impor
tant to me," Green says."(And]
just living by Stanford I always
kind of wanted to go there."
Plus, "My mom completely
wanted me to go to Stanford," she
adds.
Green arrived on campus as one

of the top recruits in the nation
and enjoyed success immediately.
Playing No. 3 on a team led by
the great Patty Fendick, Green
helped Stanford win what was
then the team's second-straight
national title.
In the individual champion
ships that year, Green made it all
the way to the semifinals —
beating second-seeded Ronni Reis
along the way.
In her sophomore year Green
moved up a notch in the lineup,
Stanford successfully defended its
championship, and Green again
made it to the individual semi
finals.
At the moment, she's in the
Sweet 16 — just two steps away
from a third-straight appearance
in the semis.
Green says that indirectly the
team success leads to her individ
ual success. "The team (title) is
what we worked for all year," she
says. "My biggest goal is to win
for the team."
To that end, "We work on play
ing well for nationals," Green
says.
It also doesn't hurt her prepa
ration that in practice every day
she's playing with some of the
top players in the nation. But it
could produce other problems.
Green, like the four players
around her in the lineup, could
play No. 1 at almost any other
school.
"Everyone (at Stanford) is so
used to being the prima donna
and the No. 1," she says.
Green explains the possible
"clash of egos" just hasn't hap
pened. "Everyone has a lot of re
spect for everyone else. Through
the year everyone grew a little
bit and was more accepting (of
the situation)."

But Green adds it hasn't been
all smooth sailing. "At first, 1 was
having a hard time getting
psyched up," she says.
Meanwhile, everyone was gun
ning for her. "Playing 3, 4, 5 on
a college team, everyone gets so
psyched up to beat you. You'd be
a great win for them," Green
notes.
"If I lose, it's a terrible loss,"
she says, adding that she usually
doesn't need to concern herself
with losing because of her confi
dence in her teammates.
That attitude was certainly
helpful in allowing Green to post
a 24-3 record in dual matches this
year. Last season, she was almost
as good at 23-6.
One of her biggest wins came
Friday against Oklahoma State's
Danielle Jones. With Stanford
leading 4-1, Green needed to win
her match to obviate the need for
doubles.
The third set went to a tie

breaker and three times Jones
had a match point. But three
times Green saved them and, on
her third match point, won the
tiebreaker 12-10.
After the match, Coach Frank
Brennan praised his All-Amer
ican. "Lisa is a great athlete, a
great competitor," Brennan said.
"She's been the freshman female
athlete of the year at Stanford
. . . she was the sophomore female
athlete of the year.
"When she gets up at these
awards ceremonies, people look at
her like 'I thought she was a
cheerleader.' They're looking for
some big hulk who throws the
discus.
"They say 'That's Lisa Green?'
She's just a great athlete . . . un
der pressure I'll put my money
on her," Brennan said.
The Cardinal's money player is
a power-hitting baseliner who
frustrates opponents by returning
their hardest shots.

"I like playing against pace,"
Green says. "[But] I don't like to
be overpowered. I'm better if I'm
controlling the points."
Of her power, she says: "If I
hit easy, they don't go for it. I
have to hit hard."
Besides her strong game,
Green's other trademark on the
court is her tendency to show emo
tion by throwing her racquet or
beating it into the ground.
"I have a bad temper," Green
acknowledges. And if you look at
Green when she's frustrated, she
looks like her whole world is
caving in around her.
But don't be fooled. On the next
point, she's more than likely to
rip off an improbable winner and
demoralize her opponent.
That style of play has once
again put her right in the middle
of things at the NCAA individuals.
And if she keeps following the
middle way, maybe she'll come up
on top this time.
