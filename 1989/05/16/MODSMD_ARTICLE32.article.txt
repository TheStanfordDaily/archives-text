# Balance of tennis, life suits Green

GAINESVILLE, Fla. - Stan
ford junior Lisa Green has found
the middle way.
The Cardinal's No. 3 singles
player has found incredible suc
cess on the court without letting
tennis become the be all and end
all of her life.
"Tennis is really important to
me," Green says. "But I went to
college to (also) get an education
and have fun."
In actuality, Green thought
seriously about not playing tennis
at all in college. Of course, she
did wind up playing, developed
her game and has been a key
member of the past three NCAA
championship teams.
Coincidentally, her love for the
game developed as well. "I've
started really enjoying tennis a lot
more since I've come to Stanford,"
Green says. "A lot of it has to do
with enjoying a balance (between
tennis and everything else)."
The balance has been with her

for some time. In high school, she
didn't practice all that much —
"maybe an hour a day, an hour
and a half," she says.
"I was into my friends," she
continues. "I didn't like missing
everything, missing parties and
(not) seeing my friends."
Green grew up just a hop, skip
and jump away from the Univer
sity. The San Jose resident says
despite Stanford's proximity she
almost wound up at USC.
"I really wavered," she says."I
wanted to go to L.A. I kind of
wanted to go further from home
. . . have a little more indepen
dence."
But there were a number of
things USC couldn't compete
with: academics, word of mouth
and Green's mom.
"Academics are really impor
tant to me," Green says."(And]
just living by Stanford I always
kind of wanted to go there."
Plus, "My mom completely
wanted me to go to Stanford," she
adds.
Green arrived on campus as one

of the top recruits in the nation
and enjoyed success immediately.
Playing No. 3 on a team led by
the great Patty Fendick, Green
helped Stanford win what was
then the team's second-straight
national title.
In the individual champion
ships that year, Green made it all
the way to the semifinals —
beating second-seeded Ronni Reis
along the way.
In her sophomore year Green
moved up a notch in the lineup,
Stanford successfully defended its
championship, and Green again
made it to the individual semi
finals.
At the moment, she's in the
Sweet 16 — just two steps away
from a third-straight appearance
in the semis.
Green says that indirectly the
team success leads to her individ
ual success. "The team (title) is
what we worked for all year," she
says. "My biggest goal is to win
for the team."
