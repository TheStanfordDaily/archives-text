## Rowers place high at Pac-10s 
### 
The men's and women's crew
teams had lofty expectations
going into last weekend's Pacific
Coast Rowing Championships at
Lake Natoma in Rancho Cor
dova, the women hoping to cap
ture the Pacific 10 Conference
crown and the men seeking at
least a third-place finish.
However, it was not Stan
ford's weekend as neither team's
hopes were fulfilled. The women
finished in a respectable but
somewhat disappointing second
place, three and one-half seconds
behind Washington, while the
men came in fourth behind
UCLA, Washington, and Califor
nia.
The women's final turned into
a dogfight between Washington,
Stanford, and UCLA. All three
crews, along with California,
were almost dead even at the
500-meter mark.
Although California soon fell
back, the other three crews
stayed together and each made
a move for the lead at the race's
half-way point. Stanford and
UCLA were unable to match
Washington's surge, and the
Huskies moved into the lead for
good.
From here on out, the Cardi
nal boat jockeyed with UCLA
for second place. The surpris
ingly strong Bruins held a scant
six-foot edge with only 200
meters left in the race, and it
appeared Stanford might have
to settle for third.
However, the Cardinal rowers
somehow found an extra reserve
of energy where none seemed to
exist and surpassed the UCLA
boat at the wire to capture the
silver by a mere two-tenths of a
second.
"We are capable of beating
Washington but not with the
race we rowed. The rhythm of
the boat was not U P t0 P ar
we didn't row as well together
as we have before," junior Diana
Olson, who rows in the No. 6

position, said.
Coach John Davis added, "We
weren't as sharp as we have
been. We rowed a courageous
race, but it just wasn't our day."
The men's expectations were
not as high as the women's, as
UCLA and Washington were
clearly the conference's domi
nant crews. However, a bronze
finish seemed possible, espe
cially after the Cardinal men's
one-second victory over Califor
nia in one of Saturday's quali
fying heats.
The men rowed a solid race
with a time of 5:54.9, but had
to settle for fourth, well back of
UCLA, who turned in a phenom
enal 5:45 clocking. The Cardinal
boat opened up with an impres
sive first 1000 meters, trailing
UCLA and Washington but
leading California at the halfway
juncture.
However, the Cardinal's tradi
tional sore spot came back to
haunt them, as they slowed in
the third 500 meters and were
overtaken by California. A come
back effort in the race's final
stages fell short and Stanford
missed out on the bronze by
three seconds to the Golden
Bears.
"We rowed as well as we could
row. UCLA and Washington are
just extremely fast and we just
can t beat them right now,"
Coach Ken Dreyfuss said.
Junior Scott Evans, the
coxswain, said, "We're disap
pointed with not getting a
bronze, especially because third
was taken by Cal who we had
beaten the day before. We just
couldn't match their move in the
third 500."
The competition does not get
any easier for the men, who face
powerhouses Northeastern and
Pennsylvania this Saturday in
Boston in a race for the Burk
Cup. The women next compete
in the National Collegiate
Rowing Championships June 3-4

in Madison, Wis.

decathlon, heptathlon
Who was it who muttered,
"It's not over 'til it's over?"
Whoever it was pretty much

summed up the way senior
decathlete D.D. Harris and
junior heptathlete Peggy Odita
felt after the first day of com

ference Track and Field Cham
pionships at Stanford Stadium

Both Harris and Odita look
forward to tomorrow as a chance

The Stanford crew teams finished second and fourth (women
and men, respectively) at Pac-10s this past weekend.
to better their present positions.
At the moment, Harris stands in
fourth, while national qualifier
Odita sits in second.
Harris, who finished third last
year at the Pac-lOs, finished the
the first day of competition with
3689 points, around 300 points
behind the leader. "The competi
tion is a lot better this year," said

Harris, who celebrated his 22nd
birthday yesterday. "Tomorrow is
a matter of making sure I don't
flub anything up. If I can do that,
I should be able to hold onto
fourth and maybe squeeze into
third."
The 110 meter hurdles, discus,
pole vault, javelin, and 1500 meter
run are slated for tomorrow and
will kick off at around 11 a.m.
Presently, defending champion
Derek Huff of Arizona leads the
decathlon with 4021 points.
On the women's side, Odita has

been fighting it out with UCLA
superstar Tonya Sedwick. Sed
wick tallied up 3318 points, while
Odita sits at 3196.
"I should have probably done
better in the high jump and
definitely in the shot put," Odita
said. "I did well in the hurdles
and average in the 200. All the
events are important for tomor
row. All I can say is that I am
going to go out there and do the
best that I can."
