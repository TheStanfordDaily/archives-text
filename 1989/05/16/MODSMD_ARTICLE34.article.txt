# Scrimmage highlights a steady Steve Smith
## 
### David Earnest Editorial staff 
Freshman Steve Smith sent a
clear message to the football
coaches and players of the Pacific
10 Conference yesterday. He feels
more comfortable in his cardinal
jersey than he ever did in his red
shirt.
Bringing the offense within
three points of tying the defense
on the last series of Saturday's
Cardinal/White Scrimmage,
Smith amassed 126 yards on 18-
for-24 passing as the white
shirted offense squad lost to their
cardinal-clad teammates on de
fense in front of approximately
1,500 Stanford faithful.

Smith and the first-team of
fense strutted on to the field
before the eighth and final drive
of the scrimmage trailing 16-5 to
the defense. Starting at the 50
yard line, the offense drove inside
the 20 and Smith hit tight end
Turner Baur for a 14-yard touch
down to end the scrimmage.
The offense started the drive
when fullback Scott Eschelman
carried the ball wide left for an
eight-yard pickup, a rare run on
first-down for the offense. On sec
ond and two, Smith scrambled
and gained 11, then threw two
quick strikes to Eschelman and
running back Gary Taylor to pull
the white team to the 14 yard line.
On the ensuing play, Smith
rolled right out of the pocket and
found Baur open on a slant at the
two. Baur caught the ball and
bowled over two defenders for the
score.
Because of the scrimmage's
scoring system, the touchdown
wasn't enough for the offense to
come back from the 11-point def
icit they faced after seven series.
The scrimmage consisted of eight
series of downs, starting from

various points on the field, during
each of which both squads had
the chance to score. The offense
could score seven points on a
touchdown, three for advancing
the ball within the 20 yard line,
and a single point for three con
secutive first downs within a se
ries.
The defense had a variety of
different ways to score. Turnovers
were three points each, and a sack
or a tackle for a loss was worth
one point a piece. The defense also
received a point for stopping the
offensive drive without points
scored against them and two
points for stopping a drive in the
first three plays of the series.
The white team scored four of
their points on the second series
of downs after three-and-out
(there were no punts or kicks in
the scrimmage, however) on the
first series. After completing one
of two in the first series, Smith
went 7-for-ll before the drive
stalled on third-and-four from the
9 yard line.
Smith shined during the second
series. His first pass was incom
plete after second-team linebacker
Chuck Robinson put pressure on,
but the freshman responded on
the next down by taking a straight
drop and hitting Eschelman for a
gain of nine.
After a third-down conversion
pass to running back Charlie
Young, Smith took the first-down
snap at the offense's 45-yard line,
faked the handoff and dropped
back. Junior wide receiver Ed
McCaffrey, returning to the start
ing lineup after redshirting last
year with an injured hamstring,
was downfield two steps behind
his defender on the right side.
Smith aired it out, hitting McCaf
frey on the numbers at the 5-yard
line, but McCaffrey dropped it.
The error, however, was incon
sequential because the offense was
penalized for holding. On the en
suing second-and-20 play, Smith
went right back to McCaffrey,
firing him a bullet that gained 10
yards. On third down, Smith
dropped, took simultaneous hits
from two defenders and was
buried from view.
But out he popped, stood and
took two steps down field before
hitting Price for a 14-yard pickup
and the first down. From the car
dinal team's 33-yard line, Smith
hit Taylor for a gain of four, the
offense's third first-down of the
series and their first point of the
scrimmage. Two plays later he
found Jim Price over the middle
at the 15 and with the completion
scored three more for the white
team.
Coach Dennis Green's new pro
style offense, which replaces Jack
Elway's run-and-shoot system,
was the highlight of the day, with

Smith at the focus of its splendor.
"I'm better suited for this of
fense," Smith said after the game.
"It's not the run and shoot, it's
the straight drop back loffensel."
In spite of the offense's impres
sive movement of the ball, the
cardinal team won the game
purely with fundamental, hard
hitting defense.
The Cardinal/White scrimmage
and spring practice in general
have set the tone for the future
of Stanford football as well. About
the Cardinal's newest new quar
terback, who has yet to play a
down of college football, Berry
said "Smith is incredible. . . . Op
ponents better watch out because
he's going to be a great college
quarterback."
If Berry is right, Smith will be
the consistent quarterback that
has eluded Stanford the last two
vears.
