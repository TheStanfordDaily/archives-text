# 'Elmerosity' keeps firm of Birch and Graham solid
## Doubles partners also remain closest of friends 
### Evan Tuchinsky Senior staff writer 
Not even the most gifted
screenwriter could have scripted
a better beginning for the doubles
team of Sandra Birch and Debbie
Graham.
The scene: The 18-and-under
U.S. Hardcourt Championships.
Friends after playing in the same
tournaments for years, Birch and
Graham were roommates at this
one.
The story: Doubles competition
loomed in the near future. Birch
and Graham prepared to play —
but not together. Each already
had her own partner.
Until fate stepped in, that is.
"Both of our partners couldn't
play, so we didn't have anyone to
play with for the rest of the tour
nament," Graham recalled. "Then
someone said, 'Hey, why don't you
two play?' We said 'OK,' and then
we won the tournament."

A doubles team was born.
Forged by friendship and
solidified by success, Birch, a
sophomore, and Graham, a fresh
man, have become one of the most
feared doubles teams to emerge
from the junior ranks.
Over the summer, the tandem
won two professional tourna
ments. Continuing their winning
ways at Stanford, Birch-Graham
has successfully spent the year at
No. 2 doubles for the NCAA cham
pion Cardinal and has advanced
to today's second round at the
NCAA Tournament in Gainesville,
Fla.
The secret to all their success?
Elmerosity, of course.
"That started in a pro tourna
ment," Graham explained. "We
weren't seeded and weren't sup
posed to make it into the quar
terfinals, but we made it all the
way to the finals.
"After the match, the coach said
to us, 'You guys need some funny

nicknames.' Sandra went, 'Yeah,
you can be Elmer 1 and I'll be
Elmer 2, because we stuck to
gether like Elmer's glue!' It's so
gay, but now that's our little nick
name that no one ever knows."
More than a mere nickname,
the Elmer concept has evolved
into a unique rallying cry. Just
when things look bleakest, a cry
of "Elmerosity" can turn a match
around.
"Whenever the other person is
playing singles or doubles, it's like
'Think Elmerosity,' " Graham
said. "It's our psyche word. It
makes you chuckle a little bit and
not worry any more."
It is this cohesion, this friend
ship, that has transformed the
juniors team into a professional
and collegiate force. Capitalizing
on familiarity, Birch and Graham
have made the transition with rel
ative ease.
Their friendship began earlier
than their doubles partnership, on
the junior tournament circuit.
Since both were elite-level players,
they invariably encountered each
other at top tournaments nation
wide.
A friendship developed that en
dured the stresses of distance and
competition. Birch lived in Hunt
ington Bay, N.Y., while Graham
inhabited Fountain Valley, Calif.
Nonetheless, the pair remained
close friends and amicable room
mates at the fateful hardcourt
competition.
At Stanford, the pair has only
grown closer. With the luxury of
practicing together whenever nec
essary, Birch and Graham have
honed their game with increasing
success.
Including the team portion of
the NCAA Tournament, the pair
has earned an impressive 10-2
dual-match record. They may not
have the advantage of a high
seeding entering the heat of dou
bles competition this week, but
the pair has more than compen
sated with familiarity.
"We're really good friends,"
Graham said. "We tell each other
everything. Sometimes one of us
might get upset (at the other),
but we know we're doing it for

each other's good."
"I think we communicate well,"
Birch added. "When every point
is over, we always come together
and talk. We'll walk together to
go pick a ball up. It helps for the
team if you're together."
Unity has won many a match
for the duo, including the pair of
surprise victories in professional
tournaments this past summer at
Fayetteville, Ark., and Evansville,
Ind. Facing the same unlikely
odds as in their doubles debut,
the pair overcame the stigma of
youth and prevailed in a tough
field.
"I don't know how we beat
them," Graham laughed. "A lot
of pros just hook up at tourna
ments. But we had been playing
so long together and know each

other inside and out, so that made
it a lot easier."
A strong game plan and a
surplus of talent helped, as well.
With Birch enjoying the top junior
ranking in the U.S. and Graham
rating second, each has a strong
individual game that only im
proves in the doubles setting.
Rather than covering for the
other's weaknesses, each can just
go out and play aggressive serve
and-volley tennis. With ability,
strategy becomes simple.
"You hit the serve up the middle
and have the person at the net
try to pick off the return," Birch
explained. "We try to be aggres
sive and take over the net —
that's when we're playing our
best."
This week's tournament, per

haps more than any other they've
played in, will push the pair to
the brink of collapse. After four
days of emotional competition for
the team title, Birch and Graham
will have to play three matches
daily, including their individual
bids for the NCAA singles cham
pionship.
It is the kind of situation that
can easily drive a doubles team
into disarray. Birch has already
beaten Graham for the Pacific 10
Conference singles title, and the
pair may yet face each other again
in the NCAA singles draw.
With all the tension, disagree
ments are inevitable. The team of
Birch-Graham, as it has in the
past, will emerge unscathed.
Fate would not have it any
other way.
