### John Wagner Editorial staff 
The takeover of University
President Donald Kennedy's office
and rally for students' rights yes
terday was the work of a complex
web of student leaders and student
groups.
Staged primarily by the Stu
dents of Color Coaliton as a
protest against Kennedy's limited
response to demands made at a
rally last Thursday, several other
key players surfaced in yester
day's proceedings.
The coordinating force behind
the takeover and rally was a
"steering committee" comprised
of 10 students: two people from
each of the four ethnic student
groups which make up the Stu
dents of Color Coalition, and two
members of the ASSU's Commit
tee for Democracy in Education.
The Students of Color Coaliton
is made up of the Black Student
Union, the Asian American Stu
dents Association, the Stanford
American Indian Organization,
and MEChA, a Chicano/Latino
students group.
According to Colin Hampson, a
SAIO representative on the steer
ing committee, the committee was
responsible for the "logistics" of
the takeover and the coordination
between various groups.
David Brown and Ingrid Nava,
two members of the newly-elected
Council of Presidents slate, took
part in the demonstration as well
and were both arrested.
Although individual members of
the BSU participated in the sit-in
and rally, the organization did not
endorse the takeover of Kennedy's
office, according to newly-elected
BSU Chair Calvin Martin.
"I want to make it clear this is
not an official BSU-condoned ac
tivity," Martin told The Daily.
Martin said he was attending the
rally because he was "worried
about the welfare" of his commu
nity.
"Over these issues, at this state
in time, I am against it,"he said.

Martin said he tried to enter
Kennedy's office himself at one
point during the afternoon to
speak with BSU members taking
part in the sit-in, but, because he
was a "non-advocate," was
refused entrance by those occupy
ing the building.
Both Brown and Nava said they
chose to be advocates of the
takeover because of personal con
victions and out of an obligation
to their constituency.
"For me personally, I feel like
people who got us elected were
students of color," Nava said. "It
was really important for us to sup
port this effort."
"We feel that the people who
are really active, who are really
concerned about these changes,
are people who we are accountable
to, the people who elected us,"
Sh "We d as a COP felt like we
needed to be a part of this,"
Brown said. "We definitely felt it
was important. When students
take action, the COP really has
to be a part of that and help any
way we can."
The idea of a sit-in at Kennedy's
office surfaced at the end of last
quarter, according to Richard
Suh, an AASA representative on
the steering committee. AASA
members were frustrated in their
lobbying efforts for an Asian
American history professor, Suh
said, and thought a sit-in would
be a dramatic tactic.
At a recent meeting, the Stu
dents of Color Coalition adopted
a sit-in as a possible tactic for
furthering their "Agenda for Ac
tion."
Seven of the 10 members on
the steering committee were will
ing to be identified as of last night.
Richard Suh and Quynh Tran
represented AASA; Gina Hernan
dez and Leticia Valadez repre
sented MEChA; Colin Hampson
and one other person represented
SAIO; and Stacey Leyton and
Nadeem Hussain represented
CODE. The BSU representatives
were not identified.
