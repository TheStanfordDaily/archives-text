# Water to resume flowing through fountains within two weeks
## 
### Stacy Stern Staff writer 
After months of gathering dust, Stan
ford's fountains will again be a target
for fountain-hopping students, now that
water rationing restrictions have come
to a close.
Eight fountains, which have been dry
for about six months, will be "flowing in
full glory," within the next two weeks,
according to University Ground Shop
manager Herbert Fong.

Only the Terman Engineering fountain
remained in use throughout the dry spell.
Re-activating the fountains is possible
because the San Francisco Public
Utilities Commission last Tuesday lifted
a mandatory water rationing plan that
had been imposed on the San Francisco
Water Department for more than a year.
"All restrictions are dropped," said
John Mullane, manager of the Commer
cial Division of the Water Department.
Fong said that Stanford's water use
will remain conservative, even though the

fountains will soon go on. Fountains that
leak will be kept off, Fong added.
Although the utilities commission will
no longer impose fines for water overuse,
a 33 percent increase in water prices has
been proposed and will be approved or
rejected by the San Francisco Board of
Supervisors before June 8.
If the board approves the rate increase,
the prices will increase by July 1. If the
price increase is rejected, rates will be
determined by a system that existed
before the drought.

Prior to the drought, the price per
cubic foot decreased for each user as more
water was purchased. The older system
was "beneficial to a large user," Mullane
said. He said he doubts the board will
re-adopt this system because it "wasn't
very conducive to water conservation."
Cheryl Jensen, manager of Operations
and Maintenance, said she does not an
ticipate the price hike having a significant
impact on the University's budget be
cause water is a relatively small part of
the total budget. "There will be no sig

nificant changes at least as far as the
students are concerned," she said.
According to Jensen, water use cur
rently costs Stanford about $1 million a
year.
The commission lifted the rationing
plan because of the rain in March and
the extra snowfall this year, both of which
increased the water supply at local res
ervoirs, Jensen said.
"We can now use water without wor
rying about every drop," Jensen said.
"But we still shouldn't waste it."
