# New firm hired to expedite final Lomita Mall phase

Because of long construction
delays under the original contrac
tor, the University has hired a
new firm to complete the final
phase of the Lomita Mall con
struction project.
A return of chain-link fences
behind the Terman Engineering
Building signals the final phase
of the project.
The project's previous phase, fi
nally concluded in early April, was
carried out by independent con
tractor Pacific Underground Con
struction. The University did not
tu'ow Pacific to bid on the final
ph.tse of the work, however.

The decision to switch contrac
tors came in the wake of serious
scheduling problems with Pacific,
which finished work months be
hind schedule. The project was
originally slated for completion in
September, but officials moved
the deadline back to December
when the construction was not
done at the beginning of the school
year.
The reason for the contractor
switch "wasn't the quality of the
work, it was the scheduling," said
Michael Kuntz, a construction ad
ministrator for General Plant Im
provement, the University
