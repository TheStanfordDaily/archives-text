# New firm hired to expedite final Lomita Mall phase

### Jamie Dycus 
Because of long construction
delays under the original contrac
tor, the University has hired a
new firm to complete the final
phase of the Lomita Mall con
struction project.
A return of chain-link fences
behind the Terman Engineering
Building signals the final phase
of the project.
The project's previous phase, fi
nally concluded in early April, was
carried out by independent con
tractor Pacific Underground Con
struction. The University did not
tu'ow Pacific to bid on the final
ph.tse of the work, however.

The decision to switch contrac
tors came in the wake of serious
scheduling problems with Pacific,
which finished work months be
hind schedule. The project was
originally slated for completion in
September, but officials moved
the deadline back to December
when the construction was not
done at the beginning of the school
year.
The reason for the contractor
switch "wasn't the quality of the
work, it was the scheduling," said
Michael Kuntz, a construction ad
ministrator for General Plant Im
provement, the University
department responsible for the
work.
The new work, scheduled to
begin yesterday, will be carried
out by another independent firm,
West Valley Construction of
Campbell, Calif. Should West Val
ley not complete work on time,
the University has various con
tractual recourses ranging from
inaction to termination of the con
tract, Kuntz said.
The projected cost of West Val
ley's work is $242,750.
The purpose of the Lomita Mall
project is to install utilities which
will serve the Near West Campus,
currently under construction.
Conduits for chilled water and
electric and communications lines
were installed during the project's
previous phase. The new work,
which will conclude the project,
will tie these utilities into the Uni
versity's campus-wide utility sys
tem.
Work on the final phase is
scheduled to continue until the
end of July, Kuntz said. Construc
tion will be halted during the
week prior to Commencement to
cut down on congestion, he said.
Kuntz said that every effort will
be made to minimize noise from
the project.
