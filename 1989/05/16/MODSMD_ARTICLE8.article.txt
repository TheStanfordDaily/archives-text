# One in four undergrad women experienced sexual coercion, according to campus survey

### Craig Mallery 
A survey released yesterday by
the Stanford Rape Education
Project found that one in four
undergraduate women and one in
three graduate women at Stanford
were forced to have vaginal, anal
or oral intercourse.
The Stanford Survey on Atti
tudes, Awareness and Experience
of Sexual Violence is the first to
examine sexual activity for one
college campus on an extensive
scale — 1,250 students responded
to 70 questions — according to
Suzanne O'Brien, a survey coor
dinator.
Survey results indicate that ac

quaintance rape constitutes a
"shocking" problem among the
graduate and undergraduate stu
dent population, O'Brien said
Of the 26 percent of under
graduate women who had been
sexually coerced, 55 percent said
the incident took place here. Of
the 33.5 percent of female grad
uate students who had been
coerced, 26 percent said the inci
dents occurred at Stanford.
According to freshman David
Frazee, a member of the survey
team, the real problem with rape
is "not people jumping out of
bushes," but rape occurring in in
terpersonal relationships and be
tween acquaintances.

According to the survey, almost
55 percent of women were already
acquainted with the person who
had coerced them into sexual ac
tivity.
"The thing that was most
shocking to me was that nobody
was talking about it," said Ted
DesMaisons, a junior and member
of the Rape Education Project.
Only 9.5 percent of the female
undergraduates surveyed had
spoken with someone about their
experience.
Last spring, the project's ques
tions were sent out by the
Registrars Office to ensure that
a representative sampling of the
Stanford population was attained.
According to O'Brien, an out
side agency compiled the data to
maintain the objective status of
the survey.
Statistical analysis of the data
was done by O'Brien and Frazee,
so that it would reflect the Uni
versity community as a whole.
DesMaisons came up with the
idea for the survey last year. He
developed the questions in con
junction with Dr. Alejandro Mar
tinez, University manager of
student health services.
Yesterday's presentation of the
survey results was the first in a
week-long series of programs
making up the Stanford Rape Ed
ucation Project's Rape Awareness
Week.
Running until next Monday, the
project has organized a series of
lectures and programs designed
to increase the awareness of the
issue of rape, according to Vivian
Vice, spokesperson for the group.
The idea for the week came
after receiving the preliminary
results ol tne survey, Vice said.
"We were really shocked be
cause we had this belief that mem
bers at Stanford were a little more
educated and weren't so subject
to these misperceptions, but as it
turned out it was really shocking.
Women had been raped who really
didn't even know they had been
raped," she said.

The survey found that of the
women surveyed who had been
coerced into sexual activity, 10.6
percent "definitely" considered
their experience to be rape.
Vice cited the group's viewing
of "The Accused," a film based
upon the New Bedford rape case,
as "the emotional trigger needed
to start this project." The group
began organizing speakers last
quarter and conducted fundrais
ing this quarter.
Throughout the week, presen
tations will range from a lecture
by Joe Weinberg, president of Men
Stopping Rape, to Linda Mar
chiano otherwise know as "Linda
Lovelace," star of the porno
graphic film "Deep Throat" and
author of "Ordeal," a book about
her career as a pornography star.
One group concern with putting
on the awareness week was that
the project would not reach the
right audience. "We were con
cerned that we would be convert
ing the converted," Vice said.
To reach out to all, the project
tried to select speakers and pro
grams that would "mainstream
the issue without diluting it," Vice
said.
Based on the large turnout at
last week's special screening of
"The Accused," Vice expects a
large turnout for this week's
events. About 900 people attended
the screening. "This shows that
people on campus actually cared
or were interested in this issue"
she said.

was talking about it," said Ted
DesMaisons, a junior and member
of the Rape Education Project.
Only 9.5 percent of the female
undergraduates surveyed had
spoken with someone about their
experience.
Last spring, the project's ques
tions were sent out by the
Registrars Office to ensure that
a representative sampling of the
Stanford population was attained.
According to O'Brien, an out
side agency compiled the data to
maintain the objective status of
the survey.
Statistical analysis of the data
was done by O'Brien and Frazee,
so that it would reflect the Uni
versity community as a whole.
DesMaisons came up with the
idea for the survey last year. He
developed the questions in con
junction with Dr. Alejandro Mar
tinez, University manager of
student health services.
Yesterday's presentation of the
survey results was the first in a
week-long series of programs
making up the Stanford Rape Ed
ucation Project's Rape Awareness
Week.
Running until next Monday, the
project has organized a series of
lectures and programs designed
to increase the awareness of the
issue of rape, according to Vivian
Vice, spokesperson for the group.
The idea for the week came
after receiving the preliminary
results ol tne survey, Vice said.
"We were really shocked be
cause we had this belief that mem
bers at Stanford were a little more
educated and weren't so subject
to these misperceptions, but as it
turned out it was really shocking.
Women had been raped who really
didn't even know they had been
raped," she said.

The survey found that of the
women surveyed who had been
coerced into sexual activity, 10.6
percent "definitely" considered
their experience to be rape.
Vice cited the group's viewing
of "The Accused," a film based
upon the New Bedford rape case,
as "the emotional trigger needed
to start this project." The group
began organizing speakers last
quarter and conducted fundrais
ing this quarter.
Throughout the week, presen
tations will range from a lecture
by Joe Weinberg, president of Men
Stopping Rape, to Linda Mar
chiano otherwise know as "Linda
Lovelace," star of the porno
graphic film "Deep Throat" and
author of "Ordeal," a book about
her career as a pornography star.
One group concern with putting
on the awareness week was that
the project would not reach the
right audience. "We were con
cerned that we would be convert
ing the converted," Vice said.
To reach out to all, the project
tried to select speakers and pro
grams that would "mainstream
the issue without diluting it," Vice
said.
Based on the large turnout at
last week's special screening of
"The Accused," Vice expects a
large turnout for this week's
events. About 900 people attended
the screening. "This shows that
people on campus actually cared
or were interested in this issue"
she said.
