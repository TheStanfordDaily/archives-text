"He had oral sex with her.
She said she didn't consent, but
he said she did. I believe they
both told the truth," said Ken
neth Sullivan, a defense attor
ney for one of the men accused
in the 1983 "Big Dan's Bar"
rape case that occurred in New
Bedford, Mass.
As part of Rape Awareness
Week, Sullivan, joined by de
fense attorney Frank O'Boy,
spoke last night at Kresge Au
ditorium to a crowd of approx
imately 100 students, discussing
rape law and the other side of
the New Bedford case.
The case involved a young
woman who was raped on a pool
table by two men and allegedly
forced to have oral sex with a
third while five men stood by
and cheered on the rapists. Two
men were found guilty of rape.
Because she never expressed
any objections, "I think (the
third man) genuinely thought
she was willing. There is a prob
lem because if you're going to
be responsible for your actions,
you have to intend them," said
Sullivan.

According to Sullivan, the law
applying to the five men who
observed the assault states that
"being present is not a criminal
offense." He added that "if the
law finds you are aiding and
abetting (the aggressors), you're
just as guilty. This is a tenuous
distinction."
In criminal cases, only about
2 percent of those prosecuted
are found not guilty, according
to Sullivan.
However, O'Boy said that in
selecting the jury, many of the
individuals interviewed had al
ready made up their minds
against the victim. He attrib
uted this prejudice to the "fires
torm of publicity" the case re
ceived.
"This was the first case ex
tensively covered on cable tele
vision. The fact is there were
only five people besides those
charged but the media blew this
up and said 20 people (were
present). People heard false
facts (before the trial)," O'Boy
said.
According to O'Boy, this made
jury selection one of the most
difficult and intense of all the
cases in Massachusetts.
According to O'Boy, the trial

involved two juries: the "after
noon jury" trying the two al
leged rapists and the "morning
jury" for the other individuals
accused. The afternoon jury
convicted the two men on ag
gravated rape while the morn
ing jury acquitted the men who
were accused of cheering on the
aggressors.
According to Sullivan, one of
the most common questions he
is asked is how he can represent
someone who is guilty.
"Everyone is entitled to com
petent council," Sullivan said.
"There's another side to rape"
and under the Sixth ammend
ment to the U.S. Constitution,
the accused has the right to con
front his accuser and receive
council, O'Boy said. As defense
council, it is his job to point out
weaknesses in the prosecutor's
evidence which will sway the
jury in favor of his clients.
Torn clothing, a medical ex
amination, physical injuries or
an immediate report of the in
cident provide support for a vic
tim's allegations, O'Boy said.
According to Sullivan,
prosecutors have a key weapon
if a woman fails to report the
rape immediately.
