# Protesters rekindle fervor for agenda at noon rally
## 
### Brad Hayward Senior staff writer 
About 500 students and others
rallied in White Plaza yesterday,
seeking support for a minority
student coalition's "Agenda for
Action" and calling for charges to
be dropped against those arrested
in Monday's takeover of Univer
sity President Donald Kennedy's
office.
The noon rally, which included
at least 20 speeches by represen
tatives of campus and off-campus
groups, was followed by a march
to Kennedy's office, where dem
onstrators joined hands and
circled the building while chant
ing, "Hey hey, ho ho, the admin
istration's too damn slow."
The rally and march followed a
chaotic Monday in which mem
bers of the Students of Color Co
alition, ASSU Committee on De
mocracy in Education, Council of
Presidents and Senate took over
Kennedy's office and barricaded
it for nine hours. Police arrested
55 students late Monday after
noon, but later cited them for
trespassing and unlawful assem
bly and released them.
Ralliers yesterday declared
Monday's protest a success but
expressed personal anger toward
Kennedy for using police at the
scene.
"From the moment we took over
the administration building, we
were treated as criminals," said
freshman Mae Lee of the Asian-
American Student Association.
"We were threatened with felony
charges and with expulsion. The
administration showed absolutely
no respect for our voice."
"President Kennedy is person
ally responsible for our arrests
and for the mistreatment and
humiliation we suffered in cus
tody," said CODE co-chair Diana
Blank.
"The fact that Kennedy not only
wouldn't talk to the 50 of us in
side but that he would ignore the
500 others outside, too, is outra

geous. It was completely irrespon
sible, not just to the concerns of
the students protesting, but to
their physical safety, to call in
armed, helmeted riot police,"
Blank said.
Gina Hernandez, co-chair of the
Chicano/Latino group MEChA,
said Monday's protest neverthe
less accomplished its objectives.
"We did what we did [Monday]
to make it clear to the adminis
tration that we are serious about
securing student input, student
needs and student priorities at the
center of this University. . . . We
knew what we were doing," Her
nandez said.
At a rally last Thursday, the
coalition first presented its
"Agenda for Action," a list of 13

demands for hiring faculty of
color, improving multicultural ed
ucation, rescinding next year's 8
percent tuition hike and increas
ing funding for teaching assis
tants, among other issues.
At that time, Kennedy refused
to meet with coalition leaders,
saying the report issued last
month by the University Commit
tee on Minority Issues "should be
the sole mechanism for evaluating
needs and priorities in this area."
During the Monday protest, the
administration did offer a meeting
between Kennedy, six student rep
resentatives and three administra
tors, according to Assoc. Dean of
Student Affairs Michael Jackson.
