# Protesters rekindle fervor for agenda at noon rally
## 
### Brad Hayward Senior staff writer 
About 500 students and others
rallied in White Plaza yesterday,
seeking support for a minority
student coalition's "Agenda for
Action" and calling for charges to
be dropped against those arrested
in Monday's takeover of Univer
sity President Donald Kennedy's
office.
The noon rally, which included
at least 20 speeches by represen
tatives of campus and off-campus
groups, was followed by a march
to Kennedy's office, where dem
onstrators joined hands and
circled the building while chant
ing, "Hey hey, ho ho, the admin
istration's too damn slow."
The rally and march followed a
chaotic Monday in which mem
bers of the Students of Color Co
alition, ASSU Committee on De
mocracy in Education, Council of
Presidents and Senate took over
Kennedy's office and barricaded
it for nine hours. Police arrested
55 students late Monday after
noon, but later cited them for
trespassing and unlawful assem
bly and released them.
Ralliers yesterday declared
Monday's protest a success but
expressed personal anger toward
Kennedy for using police at the
scene.
"From the moment we took over
the administration building, we
were treated as criminals," said
freshman Mae Lee of the Asian-
American Student Association.
"We were threatened with felony
charges and with expulsion. The
administration showed absolutely
no respect for our voice."
"President Kennedy is person
ally responsible for our arrests
and for the mistreatment and
humiliation we suffered in cus
tody," said CODE co-chair Diana
Blank.
"The fact that Kennedy not only
wouldn't talk to the 50 of us in
side but that he would ignore the
500 others outside, too, is outra

geous. It was completely irrespon
sible, not just to the concerns of
the students protesting, but to
their physical safety, to call in
armed, helmeted riot police,"
Blank said.
Gina Hernandez, co-chair of the
Chicano/Latino group MEChA,
said Monday's protest neverthe
less accomplished its objectives.
"We did what we did [Monday]
to make it clear to the adminis
tration that we are serious about
securing student input, student
needs and student priorities at the
center of this University. . . . We
knew what we were doing," Her
nandez said.
At a rally last Thursday, the
coalition first presented its
"Agenda for Action," a list of 13

demands for hiring faculty of
color, improving multicultural ed
ucation, rescinding next year's 8
percent tuition hike and increas
ing funding for teaching assis
tants, among other issues.
At that time, Kennedy refused
to meet with coalition leaders,
saying the report issued last
month by the University Commit
tee on Minority Issues "should be
the sole mechanism for evaluating
needs and priorities in this area."
During the Monday protest, the
administration did offer a meeting
between Kennedy, six student rep
resentatives and three administra
tors, according to Assoc. Dean of
Student Affairs Michael Jackson.

Following a noon rally in White Plaza, at least 250 students march back to the scene of Monday's
protest. Once they reached the President's Office, ralliers joined hands and circled the building.
But, though the expressed in
tent of the office takeover was to
secure such a meeting, protesters
refused the offer, saying they
wanted an immediate face-to-face
meeting. Kennedy refused that,
citing a University policy against
negotiating with students who un
lawfully occupy a building.
Kennedy, who was away from
campus yesterday afternoon,
issued a statement "to confirm
my willingness, under proper cir
cumstances, to meet with student
representatives of the Agenda for
Action and discuss their views.
"For me, these circumstances
include recognition that this com
munity has for the better part of
two years engaged itself deeply in
a responsible, interactive and mul
ticultural process for addressing
minority issues. The important
work of the UCMI, which stu
dents, faculty and staff of color
were key participants, deserves
better than to be derailed at this
critical point in time."
Said Jackson: "What's getting
lost is that we made an offer for
a meeting and it was turned down.
But that offer is still on the
table. . . . We do want to sit down
and talk, not stonewall each
other."
Jackson added that the earliest

possible meeting time would be
early next week, due to Kennedy's
schedule. Monday's offer of a
meeting at "a mutually agreeable
time," which might have changed
Kennedy's schedule, was res
cinded because the protesters did
not voluntarily leave Kennedy's
office.
One coalition leader, Richard
Suh of AASA, said the adminis
tration's new meeting proposal is
"a good sign" and negotiations for
setting up the conference are
starting.
Kennedy will present his views
on the UCMI report at tomor
row's meeting of the Academic
Council. But at yesterday's rally,
students said the UCMI report
does not adequately address their
concerns.
"Yes, Kennedy will be making
his speech on Thursday," one ral
lier said. "But we've been asking
the same things for 20 years."
Coalition leaders announced
yesterday that another rally will
be held Thursday afternoon at the
Law School, when the Academic
Council meets.
About 35 members of the
United Stanford Workers, includ
ing laborers from Webb Ranch,
rallied with the coalition, holding
signs reading, "USW workers sup
port students" and "Webb Ranch
Solidarity."
"This university seems to
plague us as it plagues you," said

USW Vice President Michael
Mayo at the rally. "It's good that
we can stand here together as
one. As your quest to get recog
nized by Stanford goes on, we will
stand by you all the way."
USW Steward Linda Crouse
said, "Donald Kennedy, many of
us think you are the one, not the
students, who is offensive and
should be brought up on charges
of not sitting down and solving
these problems in a timely way."
Rally leaders also read a letter
of support from State As
semblywoman Teresa Hughes of
Los Angeles urging the University
"to seriously consider the de
mands expressed by its students
of color."
Several faculty members were
present at the rally, including An
thropology Prof. Renato Rosaldo,
who called on the University to
display more sensitivity to the stu
dents' concerns.
"We've got students who are
porcelain. The University should
no longer be a hammer," Rosaldo
said.
Representatives of the Stanford
American Indian Organization,
CODE, the COP and the Rape
Education Project addressed the
audience. Several black students
who occupied Kennedy's office
Monday also spoke, though not as
representatives of the Black Stu
dent Union. The BSU did not of
ficially condone the office

takeover.
Students from San Jose State
University, San Jose City College
and DeAnza College also spoke,
along with an organizer of recent
demonstrations at Howard Uni
versity.
During the rally, coalition mem

bers passed around a petition re
questing that charges against
Monday's protesters be dropped.
Each protester was charged with
one count of trespassing and four
counts of unlawful assembly and
assigned a court date.
Yesterday's ralliers repeatedly

said the protesters were released
because a crowd had blocked the
path of the bus that was to take
them to jail. But John Schwartz,
University vice president and gen
eral counsel, disputed that theory

last night.
"I understand that some stu
dents thought this was a great
victory, but that is the procedure
that has been followed on this
campus for years," Schwartz said.
At 1:10 p.m. yesterday, 250 to
300 of the ralliers marched from
White Plaza to the President's Of
fice, where they chanted and
taped up a banner displaying
signatures of student supporters.
Although the doors to Building
10, where Kennedy's office is lo
cated, were locked during the
demonstration, normal operations
continued inside, according to Bob
Hamrdla, an aide to Kennedy. The
demonstration dispersed at 1:45
p.m.
Jackson, though anxious for co
alition leaders to meet with Uni

versity officials, said: "It is im
portant that students be able to
express their voice. To the extent
that this rally was able to do that,
I'm glad. I'm glad it was peace
ful."
