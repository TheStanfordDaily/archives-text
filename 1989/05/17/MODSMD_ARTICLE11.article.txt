# Panama prepares for general strike

PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP)
— An Air Force plane evacuated
the first group of U.S. military
dependents yesterday on the eve
of a general strike that the Pan
amanian government has called
illegal.
The opposition vowed to go
ahead with the one-day strike,
which coincides with the opening
today in Washington of a confer
ence of the Organization of Amer
ican States on Panama's nullified
election.
President Bush telephoned
Guillermo Endara, the opposi
tion's presidential candidate in the
May 7 election who was severely
beaten a week ago by street gangs
from the pro-government "Dignity
Battalions."
Endara was released from a
hospital yesterday. An aide said
Bush spoke with Endara for about
seven minutes and told him U.S.
actions were aimed at Gen.
Manuel Antonio Noriega, com
mander of the nation's Defense
Forces, and not the Panamanian
people.
White House spokesman Ro
man Popadiuk said in Washington
that Bush called Endara "to ex
press sympathy over the assault
which Mr. Endara and his fellow
leaders of the democratic forces
in Panama suffered at the hands
of the Noriega regime.
"The president noted the wave

of outrage which has swept the
hemisphere in the wake of Nori
ega's effort to steal the election
by force and fraud."
At the U.S. Howard Air Force
Base, 238 Americans boarded a
chartered Air Force plane — the
first of hundreds of dependents
to be evacuated in the next few
weeks.
Air Force Msg. Joan Ferguson
said the group had 164 military
dependents, 71 active-duty per
sonnel and three dependents of
an armed forces civilian employee.
She said some of the active-duty
personnel had fewer than three
months left on their tours in
Panama and were vacating base
housing to make room for those
who had been living off the base.
She said others were going on
home leave and were taking ad
vantage of the special flight.
While some Americans were
being evacuated, the Bush admin
istration was sending 1,900 mili
tary personnel into Panama to
reinforce the more than 10,000
troopers stationed here.
The Noriega-controlled govern
ment said today's strike is
motivated by political goals, not
economic issues, and is an at
tempt to stain Panama's image
at the OAS meeting.
Both the government and oppo
sition say they will have repre
sentatives at the conference.
