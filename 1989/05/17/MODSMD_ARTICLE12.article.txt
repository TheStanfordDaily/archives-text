# Meese, ACLU join forces to back free expression at colleges

### 
WASHINGTON (AP) â€” Former Attor
ney General Edwin Meese and the Amer
ican Civil Liberties Union, bitter foes in
the past, joined forces yesterday to en
dorse freedom of expression on American
college campuses.
The unlikely alliance was prompted by
the settlement of a lawsuit pitting Cali
fornia State University at Northridge
against James Taranto, a conservative

former editor of the university's student
newspaper.
Taranto was suspended from the news
editor's job at the Daily Sundial in 1987
after he wrote an opinion piece criticizing
UCLA officials for their handling of a
controversy over affirmative action.
Taranto also reprinted a cartoon from
the UCLA student newspaper that
satirized affirmative action.

The journalism faculty contends the
suspension was the result of a dispute
between a teacher and a student over
behavior rather than a reaction to the
content of the opinion piece or cartoon.
Department Chairman Michael Emery
said yesterday that Taranto chose to ig
nore a policy which required key editors
to consult with the faculty publisher re
garding controversial material.

Meese, who once called the ACLU a
"criminals lobby," attended a news con
ference at the organization's headquar
ters here with Taranto and ACLU Direc
tor Morton Halperin.
"I disagree with the ACLU on many
of their policies," Meese said. "But I have
never said they should not be free to
espouse them. I don't see anything in
consistent with encouraging them when

they do what is right."
The university should be "a citidel of
free speech," Meese said, regardless of
whether the views expressed are liberal
or conservative.
Halperin said, "We're happy to have
any allies we can get on any issue. We're
delighted to have [Meesel come and ex
press support for First Amendment rights
on campuses."
