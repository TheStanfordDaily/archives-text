A helicopter used in filming the
Chuck Norris movie ' Strangle
hold: Delta Force II" crashed in
a ravine yesterday, killing four
people and injuring about 10,
most of them Americans, police

before the stunned crew on the
ground realized the crash was
real.
The crash occurred near a man
sion once owned by former Pres

Tagaytay, a mountain resort 30
miles south of Manila.
Norris was not on the set when
the crash occurred, but he was in
the Philippines, said Randy
Maiers, spokesman for Cannon
Entertainment of Beverly Hills,
Calif., maker of the movie. Maiers
spoke in Los Angeles.
Police and members of the film
crew said the single-rotor, 14-
passenger helicopter had just
taken off to film a scene when it
veered to the left and plunged
into a 40-foot ravine.
A fire truck stationed nearby
helped extinguish the blaze, Talay
said.

Authorities and the movie com
pany identified the three film
crew members killed as American
Don Marshall, the gaffer, or chief
electrician; Mike Graham, the key
grip, or head of the set handymen;
and cameraman Gadi Danzig, an
Israeli citizen. No home towns

perial, died a few hours later in
a hospital, officials said.
