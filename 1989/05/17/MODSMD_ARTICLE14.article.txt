Senate endorses jet fighter deal
WASHINGTON (AP) — The Senate voted 52-
47 yesterday to endorse the agreement for the
United States and Japan to co-produce the new
FSX jet fighter after an angry debate in which
Japan was denounced as plotting to end American
dominance of the aerospace industry.
But lawmakers then adopted, 72-27, an amend
ment by Sen. Robert Byrd, I)-W.Va., imposing
new and tougher conditions on the co-production
arrangement aimed at assuring Japan does not
receive vital U.S. aerospace technology.
The amendment was opposed by the adminis
tration and Senate Republican leader Bob Dole
dubbed it a "killer amendment" which would

require the reopening of negotiations with the
Japanese government.
Flight 103 costs Pan Am millions
WASHINGTON (AP) — Pan Am has lost more
than $60 million in revenue because of the bomb
ing of Flight 103 over Scotland last December,
the company's chairman said yesterday.
Thomas Plaskett said the worst losses appear
to be over but that the threat of terrorism against
U.S. and other government policies continues.
The U.S. government, Plaskett said in a speech
to an aviation industry group, should "stop put
ting the financial burden on the backs of either
the industry or the traveling public."
