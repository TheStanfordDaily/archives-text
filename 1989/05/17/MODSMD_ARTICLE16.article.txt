## United we fall 
### 
Educational democracy
and ethnic studies are
not about us vs. them

STUDENTS, UNITED, may
have defeated their own
goals on Monday.
And the bitter irony is that
they were fighting a false enemy.
Both the demonstrators and
the University administration
share the same goals that
sparked students to occupy the
President's Office and resulted in
55 student arrests.
But bad judgment and poor
communication by each side may
have stalled implementation of
the University Committee on Mi
nority Issues's recommendations.
The poorly planned student oc
cupation re-polarized campus
multicultural issues into a stu
dents vs. administration battle,
which the UCMI report had pur
ported to end.
The students were preaching
to the converted: The University
administration, through the im
pressive UCMI report and a con
tinuing follow-through, has
shown its commitment to build
ing a healthy multicultural com
munity and curriculum. Students
sparked this effort and have been
integral in the process.
Demonstrators claimed that
the University has been acting
too slowly to meet UCMI recom
mendations. But a month hardly
seems too long for a University
to spend distilling and reacting
to a 240-page report.
Why didn't the demonstrators
give University officials, includ
ing some who have devoted most
of the past year to this report, a
chance before slapping them in

the face? The students needed
only to wait three more days to
see what Kennedy plans to do
with the report's prescriptions.
But the protesters were not the
only misguided players in Mon
day's protest. The University
acted irresponsibly and with un
necessary harshness by calling in
the police early that morning. Im
mediately the demonstration was
charged with a violent atmos
phere of mutual intransigence.
In addition, University offcials
missed opportunities to defuse
the volatile situation. By never
publicly addressing the demon
stration, administrative officials
left the crowd confused and anx
ious.
Sure, administrators were
working behind the scenes trying
to negotiate, but by remaining
out of view and off the podium,
the the administration gave the
crowd reason to believe rumors
that it was ignoring the students.
No doubt, the students made
direct negotiation difficult. Their
demands left no back door for
Kennedy, who was caught be
tween appearing weak if he capit
ulated, and appearing tyrannical
if he refused.
Ignoring classic rules of sit-ins
proved needlessly dangerous for
the students. They should have
arranged for legal counsel to be
on hand. They should have
warned both the police and the
University administration of
their plans and set up unam
biguous lines of communication.
The students have legitimate
goals that deserve the devotion
shown on Monday. Their convic
tion is commendable, but their
tactics are not. Students and ad
ministrators should put this ugly
incident behind them and renew
cooperative efforts toward a com
mon goal.
