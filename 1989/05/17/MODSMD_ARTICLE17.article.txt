Alumnus who sells
'Indian' souvenirs
needs education
I am writing in response to a May
11 article in which Robert Fuller, a
1960 alumnus, defended his distribu
tion of watches, key chains, buttons,
etc., that depict the grotesque, cross
eyed, big-nosed, caricature of a Native
American. This sickly caricature is the
now-defunct Stanford Indian mascot.
What Fuller does makes me angry,
but not as much as his ignorance or
his pathetic justification for preserving
a patently offensive symbol.
Fuller stated that he doesn't think
there is "anything racial" about the
caricature. What about the caricature
of the "Negro," with big, red lips,
"kinky" hair and wide-open eyes?
Would Fuller see anything "racial" in
that?
Fuller states that he has a "right to
be nostalgic." Does this mean that he
has the right to demean and debase an
entire race of people just because he
wants to "reminisce about his college
days and to have fun?"
Fuller was correct in that he recog
nizes that the Stanford today is not
the Stanford of the '50s and '60s (for
which I am thankful), but he obviously
has no sense of the history or the
present plight of Native Americans.
Being a Stanford graduate, I am
sure that he is more than capable of
making an effort to educate himself in
an area such as this in which he is
obviously ignorant. Apparently, the
Stanford of the '50s and '60s could
have used a Native American Studies
Program or an ethnically diverse West
ern Culture Program, perhaps some
thing such as CIV.
Although the Stanford of the '50s
and '60s failed Fuller in this respect,
the Stanford of today would be more
than willing to give him a clue as to
what he is lacking. For example, he

could have visited the Annual Stanford
Powwow and gotten a look at and met
the people he parodies.
I am positive that with a little edu
cation Fuller will see the error of his
ways and stop perpetuating the stereo
type of Native American peoples and
perhaps be more aware of the
stereotypes that pervade our society.

Calling in police
was hasty response
to demonstration
We deplore the use of police on
campus as a first resort in Monday's
student demonstrations. We call on
University President Donald Kennedy
to negotiate in good faith with the
students supporting the "Agenda for
Action."

University should
prevent burnout
of support staff
The Stanford student body has
charged Stanford with spending unwar
ranted amounts of money on new
buildings, roads and landscaping in
stead of on scholarships, multicultural
education, stipends for teaching assis
tants and other educational needs.
On the other side of the coin, the
same "sad but true" reality exists.
Stanford's support staff is leaving in
droves. One might ask, "Why is this?"
The answer is simple.
Not only does Stanford prefer to
spend money on things rather than
people, most of the workers at all
levels are overworked and overstressed
resulting in a myriad of emotional,
mental and physical distresses.
Add to that a burgeoning bureau
cracy that either doesn't know or
doesn't care about people's needs, and
this will mark the beginning of the
end for what was once a great univer
sity.
History teaches us that when a na
tion or an entity fails to meet the
people's needs, that nation or entity
will have to change or be replaced by
one that will.

Changing score on
the Axe is not going
to change outcome
It is nice to see the Axe again after
18 months. It's about time!
It appears that somebody went to
considerable expense to re-engrave all
the game scores. But unfortunately
there seems to be an error in the score
of the 1982 game. According to the
official Stanford Athletic Department
publications, Cal won that game by a
score of 25-20.
When will this childishness ever end?
By whose authority does the Axe
Committee, most of whom were in
junior high school at the time, re
interpret history? The 1982 game was
a tragedy, but certainly not a victory.
