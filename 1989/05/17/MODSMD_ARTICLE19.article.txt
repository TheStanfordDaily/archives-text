THE PROBLEM WITH Mother's
Day is that we tend to celebrate it
as "Mother's Appreciation Day."
In the last quarter of the 20th century,
"appreciation" doesn't mean much any
more. Baseball teams "appreciate" their
fans by giving out souvenirs on a desig
nated day. That is what Fan Appreciation
Day is all about.
Analogously, should we merely "appre
ciate" our mothers, who are more than
just our fans cheering us on? They are
our pitchers, are central to the team.
They deserve more than a card on a
designated day in the year.
Just because Mother's Day passed by
three days ago doesn't mean that we
have to wait another 12 months before
we celebrate our mothers again.
Hell no. We should do something to
celebrate our mothers as early as we can,
as often as we can and at the least likely
time that we might. And we ought to do
so not just by appreciating them, but by
understanding them. The best way to
celebrate any holiday is to understand it.
We can then at least attempt to under
stand the essence of being a mother.
I think the essence of being a mother
involves a difficult balance between self
and family. One of the problems that
needs to be addressed is that of the work
ing mother, or the wanna-be-working
mother.
For example, my own mother is one
hell of a generous person. And the more
I think about her, the more I come to
the conclusion that until recently, she
was one hell of a tormented person.
It is a known fact that the young of
our species require quite a bit of attention

and raising by our parents. Compare our
species to some others whose young exist
almost independently of their progenitors.
Anyway, I feel as if I put particularly
stringent demands on my mother. Sad to
say, being my mother involved a lot of
sacrifice.
Because she had the responsibility of
raising three difficult kids, she gave up
a career. The problem is that although
you can give something up, you can al
most never give up the desire. And the
desire for what's missing burns slowly,
constantly.
Actually, I would not call that a prob
lem. Rather it is part of the essence of
being the wanna-be-working mother. She
wanted it, but she decided to give it up.
Every time I overheard my mom's com
plaints to my father about not liking
America, of missing Taiwan, of wanting
to go back to Taiwan, I would sit there
and continue listening, knowing that
what she really missed was a childhood
where there are no responsibilities of
being the mother. Compounding this pain
was her unfulfilled desire for a career.
What is so wonderful is that the desire
never went away, and now that I am
away at school, she is working again.
Contemplating my mother's sacrifice
makes me think about my friend in New
York. In school, he always stood out in
dress and in manner, wearing different
shoes and socks on each foot and wearing
sunglasses all the time, even in class. He
changed his name and stuck with it so
that no one knew his original name. Or
at least he'd deny the name his parents
gave him.

When 1 got to know him somewhat
better, it became apparent that his
strangeness was a result of parental ne
glect. Both parents worked — a lot —
and he always told people how he despised
them. The fact that both parents worked
contributed to the neglect.
His yearbook page did not contain a
single picture of himself. And at a school
awards ceremony, when his name was
called for a music award, he sat there,
ignoring the call, refusing to go up. I
know he did it just to embarrass his
parents.
After a semester in college, he stopped
out and was sent to a mental hospital.
In these two stories, we see two op
posing phenomenons: mothers and work
ing. How can the two be combined? How
can the balance of raising a family and
raising one's self through a career be
achieved?
I think a balance can be struck, though
not without a lot of organization and
hard work and commitment. And corpo
rate employers should take note: A moth
er s most valuable asset on her resume
is her managerial skills in coping with
her children and her job.
