# Demonstrators tap minority network
## 
### Jason Bloomstein Senior staff writer 
Less than an hour after junior
Quynh Tran helped barricade the
President's Office Monday, she
used Donald Kennedy's own
phone to call for reinforcements.
But Tran didn't just call Stan
ford students. As Stanford coor
dinator of the Asian and Pacific
Islander Student Union, she used
her wide array of APSU contacts
at about 10 other California uni
versities — and her long-distance
credit card — to plea for outside
support for the scores of students
who were demanding a face-to
face meeting with Kennedy to dis
cuss various issues.
A cavalry of at least 20 Asian-
American students from several
area colleges — many in the midst
of finals — heeded the calls, said
Tran, who was one of 55 protest
ers arrested for occupying Ken
nedy's office.

Stanford, it seems, is becoming
a beacon for minority students
statewide. When Stanford
rumbles, visitors say, far-reaching
issues are surely at stake.
An estimated 50 to 60 students
from schools such as UC-Santa
Cruz, UC-Berkeley, San Francisco
State University, San Jose State
University and Santa Clara Uni
versity attended Monday's
protest, many at the request of
Stanford minority organization
members who contacted them the
morning of the demonstration.
More outside supporters also at
tended yesterday's rally in White
Plaza; minority group leaders es
timate perhaps 40 were dispersed
in the crowd of about 500 Stan
ford students.
Tran said she called for support
from as far south as San Diego
State University and UC-San
Diego. None of her contacts made
the 485-mile road trip, but Tran
said they supported the protest
anyway.
Carmelita Gutierrez, a MEChA
coordinator at San Jose State and
one of six SJSU students who at
tended Monday's protests, said
Stanford's influence in shaping
educational policy, particulary in
California, is what attracted many
non-Stanford students to voice
their opinions.
"When something like this hap
pens at Stanford or Berkeley," she
said, "it sets the atmosphere for
students and administrators all
over."
She said, for instance, that last
year's Western Culture debate
and its aftermath had a profound
impact on other schools' educa
tional decisions.

Gutierrez said outside support
will help Stanford students and
at the same time "bring about
lessons we can use at San Jose
State."
Added Stanford protester Chris
Gonzalez Clark, of MEChA's
Chicano fellowship program:
"Stanford is an elite campus, and
anything that happens here has
an impact on all universities."
Word of the protest spread
through a vast phone tree between
chapters of minority organiza
tions at each California campus,
minority leaders said.
Tran said most of the people
she contacted from Kennedy's of
fice were members of other APSU
chapters she had previously met
at statewide coalition meetings.
The APSU is "very strong and
really powerful," Tran said, "and
the network is tight." Over 800
students from various California

schools attended an APSU confer
ence in Santa Cruz a few weeks
ago, said San Francisco State
junior Eugene Hayashi, who at
tended Monday's protest and yes
terday's rally.
Continual contact with Stan
ford's Black Student Union
resulted in the participation of a
delegation from Santa Clara, ac
cording freshman Yolanda Lewis.
Lewis said Stanford BSU mem
ber Cheryl Thomas called her
from Kennedy's office, and after
her last class she and eight Santa
Clara students motored up to
campus and stayed all day.
Gutierrez said she believes the
future role of non-Stanford stu
dents on campus depends on the
outcome of ensuing meetings be
tween University administrators
and minority leaders. "Then we
will see how we can help," she
said.
