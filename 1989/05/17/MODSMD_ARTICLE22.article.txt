Q. Why are most white
• babies born with blue
eyes which then change to
their permanent color?
A. Because the pigment in
• their eyes has not de
veloped fully, babies are
born with blue eyes, accord
ing to Ophthalmology Prof.
Peter Egbert.
The light eye color of most
newborn babies — com
monly not known as the
Paul Newman syndrome —
is the result of relatively
little pigment in the iris, the
part of eye that contains the
color. Also, the skin of babies
is lighter than its permanent
color. For example, black
babies are born with rela
tively light skin.
Since baby eyes are not
fully formed, the muscles
haven't developed and the
pupils appear to be small.
As the eyes develop, they get
longer and the cornea, the
outer membrane of the eye,
gets flatter. If these changes
don't coincide, the person
will eventually need glasses
or other corrective devices.
At about age 3, baby eyes
are 95 percent of their adult
size.
