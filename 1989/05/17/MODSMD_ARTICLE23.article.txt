# Scientists transform microscopes into writing devices
## Down to the atom: writing smaller than ever before 
### Vladimil Matijasevic 
Imagine storing all of human
knowledge on the surface of an
eggroll. That is how Jun Nogami,
research associate in the Applied
Physics Department, jokingly
describes the possibilities of a new
writing technique.
This technique, using a scan
ning tunneling microscope, can
create patterns on a scale only
slightly larger than the size of
individual atoms.
Although these microscopes are
already being commercially
produced for scientific purposes,
it will be many years before any
widespread applications are devel
oped, scientists say.
Previously, scientists have used

the scanning tunneling micro
scope to produce pictures showing
atomic-level detail of a surface.
But recently, a team of researchers
at Stanford under Applied Physics
Prof. Calvin Quate has extended
the instrument's capabilities.
In addition to producing images
of a surface, these researchers are
now able to write letters 1,000
times finer than the features in
even the most advanced electronic
devices being produced today.
Although writing on this scale
had been achieved earlier by other
techniques, these methods were
not practical for many applica
tions, due to the specially
prepared surfaces which were
needed.
Possible applications of fine

writing technologies are informa
tion storage and Ihe production
of electronic devices. However, in
order to be commercially useful
in these areas, the scanning tun
neling microscope still needs
faster writing and better data
retrieval, according to Fabian
Pease, professor of electrical en
gineering.
Despite its disadvantages, the
scanning tunneling microscope
can write letters so dense that
literally billions of pages of writ
ing would fit on one square inch.

Scientists can mag
nify features about
100 million times, so
they can see individ
ual atoms.

Information is stored in units
called bits, the smallest packet of
information that corresponds to
either 1 or 0. For example, it takes
at least 8 bits to store one letter.
In principle, the writing tech
nology is capable of storing one
trillion bits in a square centimeter.
The highest density of storage
commercially used today is only
one hundred million bits in a
square centimeter.
However, the bottleneck for the
technology appears to be its writ
ing speed. Currently, the scanning
tunneling microscope takes about
one-millionth of a second to write
one bit, one-tenth the speed a
home video cassette recorder can
write.
It would take years to write out
one square centimeter with a
scanning tunneling microscope,
according to Alex de Lozanne,
professor of physics at University
of Texas at Austin, who is also
working on this technology.
However, de Lozanne and
others see hope in overcoming this
problem, in part by making man)'
miniature scanning tunneling mi
croscopes that would write on one
surface at the same time.
The microscope — which won
the 1986 Nobel Prize for Gerd
Oinnig and Heinrich Rohrer of
IBM Research Labs in Zurich,
Switzerland — is a fairly simple
instrument by modern standards.
The scanning tunneling micro
scope is based on the phenomenon
called vacuum tunneling which
occurs when electrons pass
through a physical barrier, even
though they do not have enough

energy to overcome that barrier.
Tunneling is one of the results of
quantum mechanics, the physics
governing microscopic objects
which is different from the physics
governing ordinary-sized objects.
Electrons move around freely
within a metal, but they do not
normally leave the metal, because
there is a large barrier preventing
them from doing so.However,
when two metals are brought very
close together, electrons can tun
nel through the vacuum between
the two metals.
Although physicists understood
this phenomenon for a long time,
they did not appreciate that they
could create images of atoms on
i surface by tunneling electrons
in this way.
With the scanning tunneling
microscope, a sharp metal tip is
brought very close to a flat surface
so that the spacing between the
tip and the surface is kept at only
a few atomic diameters. Electrons
are then able to tunnel from the
tip onto the surface.
In order to keep the tip at the
same distance from the surface,
a current of electrons is passed
between the tip and the surface.
This current is very sensitive to
the size of the gap. As it is scanned
across the surface horizontally,
the tip is moved up and down to
keep constant the current, and

thereby the separation between
the tip and the sample. In this
way the tip maps out the surface.
By scanning the surface, scien
tists can magnify features about
100 million times, so that they
can see individual atoms. This
corresponds to enlarging a soccer
ball to the size of the Earth.
Only recently, Quate's group ex
tended the functions of the mi
croscope from just a microscope
to a writing tool as well. A small
voltage applied at a point on the
surface etches a hole that can be
scanned.
On a surface such as graphite,
a series of holes can be made to
form letters. The size of each hole,
or bit, is about 20 times the
diameter of a carbon atom. The
letters can be made about 10 times
larger than that, according to
graduate student Tom Albrecht, a
member of Quate's team who has
helped develop this technique.
The other graduate students
working in the group are Rob Bar
rett, Alison Baski, Moris Dovek,
Mike Kirk, Chris Lang, Marco
Tortonese and Tom VanZandt.
Although the applications of
this writing process are still not
clear, these researchers are very
excited about the new directions
that it promises. "It may not be
practical (yet), but it's fun," says
Albrecht.

ual atoms.

Information is stored in units
called bits, the smallest packet of
information that corresponds to
either 1 or 0. For example, it takes
at least 8 bits to store one letter.
In principle, the writing tech
nology is capable of storing one
trillion bits in a square centimeter.
The highest density of storage
commercially used today is only
one hundred million bits in a
square centimeter.
However, the bottleneck for the
technology appears to be its writ
ing speed. Currently, the scanning
tunneling microscope takes about
one-millionth of a second to write
one bit, one-tenth the speed a
home video cassette recorder can
write.
It would take years to write out
one square centimeter with a
scanning tunneling microscope,
according to Alex de Lozanne,
professor of physics at University
of Texas at Austin, who is also
working on this technology.
However, de Lozanne and
others see hope in overcoming this
problem, in part by making man)'
miniature scanning tunneling mi
croscopes that would write on one
surface at the same time.
The microscope — which won
the 1986 Nobel Prize for Gerd
Oinnig and Heinrich Rohrer of
IBM Research Labs in Zurich,
Switzerland — is a fairly simple
instrument by modern standards.
The scanning tunneling micro
scope is based on the phenomenon
called vacuum tunneling which
occurs when electrons pass
through a physical barrier, even
though they do not have enough

energy to overcome that barrier.
Tunneling is one of the results of
quantum mechanics, the physics
governing microscopic objects
which is different from the physics
governing ordinary-sized objects.
Electrons move around freely
within a metal, but they do not
normally leave the metal, because
there is a large barrier preventing
them from doing so.However,
when two metals are brought very
close together, electrons can tun
nel through the vacuum between
the two metals.
Although physicists understood
this phenomenon for a long time,
they did not appreciate that they
could create images of atoms on
i surface by tunneling electrons
in this way.
With the scanning tunneling
microscope, a sharp metal tip is
brought very close to a flat surface
so that the spacing between the
tip and the surface is kept at only
a few atomic diameters. Electrons
are then able to tunnel from the
tip onto the surface.
In order to keep the tip at the
same distance from the surface,
a current of electrons is passed
between the tip and the surface.
This current is very sensitive to
the size of the gap. As it is scanned
across the surface horizontally,
the tip is moved up and down to
keep constant the current, and

thereby the separation between
the tip and the sample. In this
way the tip maps out the surface.
By scanning the surface, scien
tists can magnify features about
100 million times, so that they
can see individual atoms. This
corresponds to enlarging a soccer
ball to the size of the Earth.
Only recently, Quate's group ex
tended the functions of the mi
croscope from just a microscope
to a writing tool as well. A small
voltage applied at a point on the
surface etches a hole that can be
scanned.
On a surface such as graphite,
a series of holes can be made to
form letters. The size of each hole,
or bit, is about 20 times the
diameter of a carbon atom. The
letters can be made about 10 times
larger than that, according to
graduate student Tom Albrecht, a
member of Quate's team who has
helped develop this technique.
The other graduate students
working in the group are Rob Bar
rett, Alison Baski, Moris Dovek,
Mike Kirk, Chris Lang, Marco
Tortonese and Tom VanZandt.
Although the applications of
this writing process are still not
clear, these researchers are very
excited about the new directions
that it promises. "It may not be
practical (yet), but it's fun," says
Albrecht.

Imagine storing all of human
knowledge on the surface of an
eggroll. That is how Jun Nogami,
research associate in the Applied
Physics Department, jokingly
describes the possibilities of a new
writing technique.
This technique, using a scan
ning tunneling microscope, can
create patterns on a scale only
slightly larger than the size of
individual atoms.
Although these microscopes are
already being commercially
produced for scientific purposes,
it will be many years before any
widespread applications are devel
oped, scientists say.
Previously, scientists have used

the scanning tunneling micro
scope to produce pictures showing
atomic-level detail of a surface.
But recently, a team of researchers
at Stanford under Applied Physics
Prof. Calvin Quate has extended
the instrument's capabilities.
In addition to producing images
of a surface, these researchers are
now able to write letters 1,000
times finer than the features in
even the most advanced electronic
devices being produced today.
Although writing on this scale
had been achieved earlier by other
techniques, these methods were
not practical for many applica
tions, due to the specially
prepared surfaces which were
needed.
Possible applications of fine

writing technologies are informa
tion storage and Ihe production
of electronic devices. However, in
order to be commercially useful
in these areas, the scanning tun
neling microscope still needs
faster writing and better data
retrieval, according to Fabian
Pease, professor of electrical en
gineering.
Despite its disadvantages, the
scanning tunneling microscope
can write letters so dense that
literally billions of pages of writ
ing would fit on one square inch.

Scientists can mag
