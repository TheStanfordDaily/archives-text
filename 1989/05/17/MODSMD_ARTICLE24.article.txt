## Harris, Odita finish high at Pac-10 tourney 
### Greg Gottesman Staff writer 
Senior decathlete D.D.
Harris and junior heptath
lete Peggy Odita did exactly
what they were supposed to
do.
For Harris and national
qualifier Odita, that meant
finishing third and fourth
respectively in the Pacific 10
conference Track and Field
Championships at Stanford
Stadium yesterday.
Harris, who took third in
the Pac-lOs last year, fin
ished this year's meet with
a score of 7,084, a personal
best. His fourth place finish,
however, was not secured
until the last event in the
decathlon, the 1,500 meters.
"I was very nervous going
into the 1,500," Harris said.
"I had to make sure one guy
did not beat me by two
seconds and another guy by
20 seconds. I actually ended
up with a personal best in
the 1,500 by two seconds."
"When I went out there,
I thought that there was no
way they were going to beat
me on my home track," he
said. "I guess there was a
little pride factor involved."
Harris will compete in the
pole vault competition on
Saturday.
For Odita, who has the
NCAA nationals to look for
ward to later this month,
the heptathlon competition
was an "up-and-down" ex
perience. Her score of 5,345,
which proved good enough
â€¢i third in the Pac-lOs, sits
below her NCAA
qualifying mark.
"Overall, I'm satisfied,"
Odita said. "Actually, I did
better than my last meet in
Texas, except for the javelin.
Some of the other people
just had good days. The girl
from Oregon had personal
bests in almost every event."
Odita will participate in
the long jump this weekend
during the regular competi
tion.
