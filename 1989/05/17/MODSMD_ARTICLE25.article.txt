# Birch, Green advance to NCAA semifinals

GAINESVILLE, Fla. - Sandra
Birch is five matches away from
making tennis history.
After the second day of NCAA
individual action, Birch was one
of two Stanford players to remain
alive while two others were
knocked out.
The Stanford sophomore Ail-
American advanced to the semi
finals of the NCAA individual
singles championships yesterday
with wins over Florida's Nicole
Arendt, 6-2, 7-6 (9-7), and Pep
perdine's Ginger Helgeson, 3-6,
6-2, 7-6 (7-4).
After battling through those
two matches, Birch came back
with Debbie Graham — who was
eliminated in singles competition
by Oklahoma State's Tessa Price
— to blow out No. 1-seeds Stella
Sampras and Mamie Ceniza of
UCLA in doubles 6-4, 6-1.
If Birch wins two more singles
matches and three more in dou
bles, she'll be the first woman to
capture the team, singles and dou
bles title in the same year.
In 1987, Patty Fendick came
closer than anyone ever has by
winning the team and singles
championships then losing in the
doubles final.
Birch's semifinal opponent is
none other than teammate Lisa
Green. The Cardinal junior scored
a hat trick with her third-straight
appearance in the NCAA semi
finals. Green defeated Tennessee's
Stacey Martin 6-4, 6-0 and
UCLA's Jessica Emmons 7-6 (8-
6), 3-6, 6-2 to advance.
Birch opened strong against
Arendt and captured the first set
6-2. In the second set, the two
traded games and went to a tie
breaker. Arendt opened up a 5-0
lead and seemed to have the set
in hand.
But she let it slip away. Even
tually squandering five set points,
Arendt — the last player from
host Florida in the draw —
couldn't halt Birch's comeback.
Arendt said she became "tenta
tive" when she had the set points
and that's why she was unable to
stay in the match.
Asked about Birch, Arendt said:
"She stayed on top of me the
whole match. She's very quick and
she's got a very wicked forehand.

If it takes three hours to win the
match ... [or] if takes 24 hours
she just does what it takes. The
only word I can think of is tough.
"It was a match I didn't mind
losing," Arendt said. "We didn't
play mind games with each other;
we just played tennis.
"You just don't see that much
anymore — just total tennis."
In her next match, Birch fell
behind Helgeson early and lost a
first set in which Helgeson did
not make a single unforced error
by a 6-3 score. "She was really,
really on," Birch said.
In the second set, Helgeson
broke Birch's serve to move up
1-0. Then came the strangest mo
ment in the tournament thus far.
Helgeson was slow coming off
the changeover. As she stepped
up to serve, chair umpire Fred
Tausig announced that she was
being assessed a time penalty for
committing a violation he later
called "too significant" to ignore.
A point penalty is given for a
first violation, but Helgeson's
time violation wasn't her first. In
the opening set, with Birch serv
ing a 2-3, Helgeson was penalized
for verbal obscenity. Thus, when
she got the time violation she was
assessed a game penalty given to
two-time rule breakers.
"I was very surprised," Birch
said of the umpire's ruling. "It
was a shame . . . (but) that's the
way it goes."
Suddenly it was 1-1 and Birch
was serving. At first, Helgeson
continued to play fairly well. Then
she began to falter and Birch
pounced, winning the set 6-2.
Helgeson gathered herself to
gether for the third set and
matched Birch at 4-4. The two
exchanged four service breaks and
headed for a breaker. Helgeson
had a 2-0 lead, but when Birch
pulled even, it would be Hel
geson's last gasp.
Birch served an ace to lead 3-2
and never looked back, winning
the tiebreaker 7-4.
Green's road to the final four
went a bit more smoothly — but
just a bit. She came out and
pounded No. 5-seed Martin into
submission.
Opening strtfng and continuing
to come up with some of the best
serves in her college career, Green
th umped Martin in impressive
fashion 6-4, 6-0.

Her next opponent was another
top seed, No. 2 Emmons. The
UCLA sophomore knocked an in
jured Teri Whitlinger out with a
6-2, 7-5 victory. Whitlinger's foot
has been hurting for several days
and she limped visibly during and
after the match.
Emmons moved out fast against
Green and seemed well on her
way to knocking out two Stanford
Ail-Americans in the same day.
She moved out to 5-1 in the first
set.
"When it was 5-1, I was just
trying to win one game to make
her think about it," Green said.
"Then I started keeping balls on
the court and playing better.
"Game by game, I came back,"
she added. Came back, indeed.
Before Emmons knew what hit
her, Green led 6-5 and was serving
for the set.
"I think I stopped playing the
way I was playing to get up 5-1,"
Emmons said. With the big lead,
she stopped making the wide va
riety of shots she had early on.
Still, Emmons broke Green
before fallne 8-6 in the tiebreaker.

UCLA's No. 1 player even
bounced back from a 2-3 deficit
to capture the second set 6-3.
"She loves the shots that are
low and hard instead of the high
topspins," Emmons noted, ex
plaining her strategy. But in the
end, it didn't matter what Em
mons did.
"[Green] was taking the shots
most people hate and just hitting
winners," Emmons said. "She just
played real well all around."
Green moved well and played
patiently in the final set. While
Emmons was able to counter
punch, her arsenal was empty of
any real weapons.
Eventually, Green overwhelmed
Emmons 6-2. "I think she may
not look very strong," Emmons
said of Green. "But she can hit
the ball hard. She's definitely one
of the country's top players."
The all-Stanford semifinal is a
rematch of October's ITCA Ail-
American Tournament. In that
contest, held in Pacific Palisades,
Calif., Birch won 7-5, 6-2.
Birch said the familiarity be
tween the two "might make it a

very tense match."
"If I don't win, I'll come out
with my head high if I give 100
percent."
Said Green: "It's always hard
to play your teammate. It would
be nice if I didn't have to do that
but I have to.
"We're both going to want to
win equally as much," Green
added.
In doubles action, Birch and
Graham were dominant. Display
ing the form that allowed them
to be so successful on the pro
tour last summer, they broke
Ceniza's serve at 5-4 to take the
first set.
In the second set, the UCLA
tandem played more like they had
a plane to catch than the top
seeds. The Stanford pair got a
break early to go up 2-0 and closed
out the second set dropping only
one game.
"We knew who we were play
ing," Birch said of her highly
touted opponents. "We just
happened to have an on day to

Birch and Graham will play as many

win their first contest. In that match,
they'll play Helgeson and Noelle

Helgeson and Porter beat Birch and
Graham in February 2-6, 6-2, 6-4 at
Stanford.
A hypothetical doubles semifinal

either California's Alissa Finerman

6-2. In the second set, the two

Green's road to the final four
went a bit more smoothly — but
just a bit. She came out and
pounded No. 5-seed Martin into
submission.
Opening strtfng and continuing
to come up with some of the best
serves in her college career, Green
th umped Martin in impressive
fashion 6-4, 6-0.

Her next opponent was another
top seed, No. 2 Emmons. The
UCLA sophomore knocked an in
jured Teri Whitlinger out with a
6-2, 7-5 victory. Whitlinger's foot
has been hurting for several days
and she limped visibly during and
after the match.
Emmons moved out fast against
Green and seemed well on her
way to knocking out two Stanford
Ail-Americans in the same day.
She moved out to 5-1 in the first
set.
"When it was 5-1, I was just
trying to win one game to make
her think about it," Green said.
"Then I started keeping balls on
the court and playing better.
"Game by game, I came back,"
she added. Came back, indeed.
Before Emmons knew what hit
her, Green led 6-5 and was serving
for the set.
"I think I stopped playing the
way I was playing to get up 5-1,"
Emmons said. With the big lead,
she stopped making the wide va
riety of shots she had early on.
Still, Emmons broke Green
before fallne 8-6 in the tiebreaker.

UCLA's No. 1 player even
bounced back from a 2-3 deficit
to capture the second set 6-3.
"She loves the shots that are
low and hard instead of the high
topspins," Emmons noted, ex
plaining her strategy. But in the
end, it didn't matter what Em
mons did.
"[Green] was taking the shots
most people hate and just hitting
winners," Emmons said. "She just
played real well all around."
Green moved well and played
patiently in the final set. While
Emmons was able to counter
punch, her arsenal was empty of
any real weapons.
Eventually, Green overwhelmed
Emmons 6-2. "I think she may
not look very strong," Emmons
said of Green. "But she can hit
the ball hard. She's definitely one
of the country's top players."
The all-Stanford semifinal is a
rematch of October's ITCA Ail-
American Tournament. In that
contest, held in Pacific Palisades,
Calif., Birch won 7-5, 6-2.
Birch said the familiarity be
tween the two "might make it a

very tense match."
"If I don't win, I'll come out
with my head high if I give 100
percent."
Said Green: "It's always hard
to play your teammate. It would
be nice if I didn't have to do that
but I have to.
"We're both going to want to
win equally as much," Green
added.
In doubles action, Birch and
Graham were dominant. Display
ing the form that allowed them
to be so successful on the pro
tour last summer, they broke
Ceniza's serve at 5-4 to take the
first set.
In the second set, the UCLA
tandem played more like they had
a plane to catch than the top
seeds. The Stanford pair got a
break early to go up 2-0 and closed
out the second set dropping only
one game.
"We knew who we were play

touted opponents. "We just

Birch and Graham will play as many
as two doubles matches today if they
win their first contest. In that match,
they'll play Helgeson and Noelle
Porter.
Helgeson and Porter beat Birch and
Graham in February 2-6, 6-2, 6-4 at
Stanford.

either California's Alissa Finerman
and Lisa Albano or Florida's Arendt

GAINESVILLE, Fla. - Sandra
Birch is five matches away from
making tennis history.
After the second day of NCAA
individual action, Birch was one
of two Stanford players to remain
alive while two others were
knocked out.
The Stanford sophomore Ail-
American advanced to the semi
finals of the NCAA individual
singles championships yesterday
with wins over Florida's Nicole
Arendt, 6-2, 7-6 (9-7), and Pep
perdine's Ginger Helgeson, 3-6,
6-2, 7-6 (7-4).
After battling through those
two matches, Birch came back
with Debbie Graham — who was
eliminated in singles competition
by Oklahoma State's Tessa Price
— to blow out No. 1-seeds Stella
Sampras and Mamie Ceniza of
UCLA in doubles 6-4, 6-1.
If Birch wins two more singles
matches and three more in dou
bles, she'll be the first woman to
capture the team, singles and dou
bles title in the same year.
In 1987, Patty Fendick came
closer than anyone ever has by
winning the team and singles
championships then losing in the
doubles final.
Birch's semifinal opponent is
none other than teammate Lisa
Green. The Cardinal junior scored
a hat trick with her third-straight
appearance in the NCAA semi
finals. Green defeated Tennessee's
Stacey Martin 6-4, 6-0 and
UCLA's Jessica Emmons 7-6 (8-
6), 3-6, 6-2 to advance.
Birch opened strong against
Arendt and captured the first set
6-2. In the second set, the two
traded games and went to a tie
breaker. Arendt opened up a 5-0
lead and seemed to have the set
in hand.
But she let it slip away. Even
tually squandering five set points,
Arendt — the last player from
host Florida in the draw —
couldn't halt Birch's comeback.
Arendt said she became "tenta
tive" when she had the set points
and that's why she was unable to
stay in the match.
Asked about Birch, Arendt said:
"She stayed on top of me the
whole match. She's very quick and
she's got a very wicked forehand.

If it takes three hours to win the
match ... [or] if takes 24 hours
she just does what it takes. The
only word I can think of is tough.
"It was a match I didn't mind
losing," Arendt said. "We didn't
play mind games with each other;
we just played tennis.
"You just don't see that much
anymore — just total tennis."
In her next match, Birch fell
behind Helgeson early and lost a
first set in which Helgeson did
not make a single unforced error
by a 6-3 score. "She was really,
really on," Birch said.
In the second set, Helgeson
broke Birch's serve to move up
1-0. Then came the strangest mo
ment in the tournament thus far.
Helgeson was slow coming off
the changeover. As she stepped
up to serve, chair umpire Fred
Tausig announced that she was
being assessed a time penalty for
committing a violation he later
called "too significant" to ignore.
A point penalty is given for a
first violation, but Helgeson's
time violation wasn't her first. In
the opening set, with Birch serv
ing a 2-3, Helgeson was penalized
for verbal obscenity. Thus, when
she got the time violation she was
assessed a game penalty given to
two-time rule breakers.
"I was very surprised," Birch
said of the umpire's ruling. "It
was a shame . . . (but) that's the
way it goes."
Suddenly it was 1-1 and Birch
was serving. At first, Helgeson
continued to play fairly well. Then
she began to falter and Birch
pounced, winning the set 6-2.
Helgeson gathered herself to
gether for the third set and
matched Birch at 4-4. The two
exchanged four service breaks and
headed for a breaker. Helgeson
had a 2-0 lead, but when Birch
pulled even, it would be Hel
geson's last gasp.
Birch served an ace to lead 3-2
and never looked back, winning
the tiebreaker 7-4.
Green's road to the final four
went a bit more smoothly — but
just a bit. She came out and
pounded No. 5-seed Martin into
submission.
Opening strtfng and continuing
to come up with some of the best
serves in her college career, Green

Santrock, the No. 4 seed.
GAINESVILLE, Fla. - Sandra
Birch is five matches away from
making tennis history.
After the second day of NCAA
individual action, Birch was one
of two Stanford players to remain
alive while two others were
knocked out.
The Stanford sophomore Ail-
American advanced to the semi
finals of the NCAA individual
singles championships yesterday
with wins over Florida's Nicole
Arendt, 6-2, 7-6 (9-7), and Pep
perdine's Ginger Helgeson, 3-6,
6-2, 7-6 (7-4).
After battling through those
two matches, Birch came back
with Debbie Graham — who was
eliminated in singles competition
by Oklahoma State's Tessa Price
— to blow out No. 1-seeds Stella
Sampras and Mamie Ceniza of
UCLA in doubles 6-4, 6-1.
If Birch wins two more singles
matches and three more in dou
bles, she'll be the first woman to
capture the team, singles and dou
bles title in the same year.
In 1987, Patty Fendick came
closer than anyone ever has by
winning the team and singles
championships then losing in the
doubles final.
Birch's semifinal opponent is
none other than teammate Lisa
Green. The Cardinal junior scored
a hat trick with her third-straight
appearance in the NCAA semi
finals. Green defeated Tennessee's
Stacey Martin 6-4, 6-0 and
UCLA's Jessica Emmons 7-6 (8-
6), 3-6, 6-2 to advance.
Birch opened strong against
Arendt and captured the first set
6-2. In the second set, the two
traded games and went to a tie
breaker. Arendt opened up a 5-0
lead and seemed to have the set
in hand.
But she let it slip away. Even
tually squandering five set points,
Arendt — the last player from
host Florida in the draw —
couldn't halt Birch's comeback.
Arendt said she became "tenta
tive" when she had the set points
and that's why she was unable to
stay in the match.
Asked about Birch, Arendt said:
"She stayed on top of me the
whole match. She's very quick and
she's got a very wicked forehand.

If it takes three hours to win the
match ... [or] if takes 24 hours
she just does what it takes. The
only word I can think of is tough.
"It was a match I didn't mind
losing," Arendt said. "We didn't
play mind games with each other;
we just played tennis.
"You just don't see that much
anymore — just total tennis."
In her next match, Birch fell
behind Helgeson early and lost a
first set in which Helgeson did
not make a single unforced error
by a 6-3 score. "She was really,
really on," Birch said.
In the second set, Helgeson
broke Birch's serve to move up
1-0. Then came the strangest mo
ment in the tournament thus far.
Helgeson was slow coming off
the changeover. As she stepped
up to serve, chair umpire Fred
Tausig announced that she was
being assessed a time penalty for
committing a violation he later
called "too significant" to ignore.
A point penalty is given for a
first violation, but Helgeson's
time violation wasn't her first. In
the opening set, with Birch serv
ing a 2-3, Helgeson was penalized
for verbal obscenity. Thus, when
she got the time violation she was
assessed a game penalty given to
two-time rule breakers.
"I was very surprised," Birch
said of the umpire's ruling. "It
was a shame . . . (but) that's the
way it goes."
Suddenly it was 1-1 and Birch
was serving. At first, Helgeson
continued to play fairly well. Then
she began to falter and Birch
pounced, winning the set 6-2.
Helgeson gathered herself to
gether for the third set and
matched Birch at 4-4. The two
exchanged four service breaks and
headed for a breaker. Helgeson
had a 2-0 lead, but when Birch
pulled even, it would be Hel
geson's last gasp.
Birch served an ace to lead 3-2
and never looked back, winning
the tiebreaker 7-4.
Green's road to the final four
went a bit more smoothly — but
just a bit. She came out and
pounded No. 5-seed Martin into
submission.
Opening strtfng and continuing
to come up with some of the best
serves in her college career, Green
th umped Martin in impressive
fashion 6-4, 6-0.

Her next opponent was another
top seed, No. 2 Emmons. The
UCLA sophomore knocked an in
jured Teri Whitlinger out with a
6-2, 7-5 victory. Whitlinger's foot
has been hurting for several days
and she limped visibly during and
after the match.
Emmons moved out fast against
Green and seemed well on her
way to knocking out two Stanford
Ail-Americans in the same day.
She moved out to 5-1 in the first
set.
"When it was 5-1, I was just
trying to win one game to make
her think about it," Green said.
"Then I started keeping balls on
the court and playing better.
"Game by game, I came back,"
she added. Came back, indeed.
Before Emmons knew what hit
her, Green led 6-5 and was serving
for the set.
"I think I stopped playing the
way I was playing to get up 5-1,"
Emmons said. With the big lead,
she stopped making the wide va
riety of shots she had early on.
Still, Emmons broke Green
before fallne 8-6 in the tiebreaker.

UCLA's No. 1 player even
bounced back from a 2-3 deficit
to capture the second set 6-3.
"She loves the shots that are
low and hard instead of the high
topspins," Emmons noted, ex
plaining her strategy. But in the
end, it didn't matter what Em
mons did.
"[Green] was taking the shots
most people hate and just hitting
winners," Emmons said. "She just
played real well all around."
Green moved well and played
patiently in the final set. While
Emmons was able to counter
punch, her arsenal was empty of
any real weapons.
Eventually, Green overwhelmed
Emmons 6-2. "I think she may
not look very strong," Emmons
said of Green. "But she can hit
the ball hard. She's definitely one
of the country's top players."
The all-Stanford semifinal is a
rematch of October's ITCA Ail-
American Tournament. In that
contest, held in Pacific Palisades,
Calif., Birch won 7-5, 6-2.
Birch said the familiarity be
tween the two "might make it a

very tense match."
"If I don't win, I'll come out
with my head high if I give 100
percent."
Said Green: "It's always hard
to play your teammate. It would
be nice if I didn't have to do that
but I have to.
"We're both going to want to
win equally as much," Green
added.
In doubles action, Birch and
Graham were dominant. Display
ing the form that allowed them
to be so successful on the pro
tour last summer, they broke
Ceniza's serve at 5-4 to take the
first set.
In the second set, the UCLA
tandem played more like they had
a plane to catch than the top
seeds. The Stanford pair got a
break early to go up 2-0 and closed
out the second set dropping only
one game.
"We knew who we were play
ing," Birch said of her highly
touted opponents. "We just
happened to have an on day to

gether."
As Birch did on her own.
Card notes
Birch and Graham will play as many
as two doubles matches today if they
win their first contest. In that match,
they'll play Helgeson and Noelle
Porter.
Helgeson and Porter beat Birch and
Graham in February 2-6, 6-2, 6-4 at
Stanford.
A hypothetical doubles semifinal
would pit Birch and Graham against
either California's Alissa Finerman
and Lisa Albano or Florida's Arendt
and Siobahn Nicholson.
Like Birch, Porter is also in the
singles semifinals. There she'll face
Southern Methodist senior Jennifer
Santrock, the No. 4 seed.
