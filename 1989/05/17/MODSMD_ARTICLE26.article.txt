# For Blackman, his pro tennis future is now
## 
### Cameron Macky Senior staff writer 
Tennis players who come to
Stanford can count on playing in
at least three, and often four,
NCAA Championship Tourna
ments during their careers.
Unless, of course, they plan on
calling it a career a little early.
For sophomore Martin Black
man, the Cardinal's No. 3 singles
player, next week's NCAA tour
ney will be his second — and last.
Blackman decided last fall that
1989 would be his final college
season.
"When I first came here out of
high school, there was about a 5
percent chance of it (turning pro
early), because I'd had a good
junior career," Blackman says.
"After coming to school, I put it
to the back of my mind. I was on
a two-year plan. I figured I'd
reconsider after two years, and I
really wouldn't think of it before
that."
As it turned out, though, Black
man did think about it before the
two years were up. "After last
summer, I had some good wins
and I felt like I was on the verge
of playing some really good ten
nis," Blackman says."I wasn't
sure if I could sustain that if I
came back to school.
"I thought about it, and I
decided to stick to the two-year
thing, just to give me a little se
curity coming out and work on
some things — without pressure
that I wouldn't get to work on
if I turned pro."
Blackman told Stanford Coach
Dick Gould in October that this
year would be his last. "(Gouldl
was really supportive about it,"
Blackman says."I was surprised.
I thought I'd get some type of
negative reaction from him. He
was really supportive. He said if
that's what I thought I had to do,
then we'd work toward that this
year."
The decision to leave, though,
was Blackman's. "Martin's been
very open with me," Gould says.
"He told me that was what he
was going to do. He didn't ask
for my advice, and I didn't feel it
was my place to give it to him.
He has my full support, though."
Gould was happy just to have
Blackman back for 1989. "There
was a question of whether or not
he'd be back at all this year,"
Gould says."He was probably our

MVP last year, in terms of
matches won . . . (and) he's cer
tainly been a key to our success
this season."
Of course, with the pro circuit
beckoning, any player might be
prone to concentration lapses at
points during the season. "That's
a tough situation (knowing that
you're going to turn pro)," Gould
says. "Even though his mind
might have wandered every now
and then, Martin's done a good
job focusing on our matches.
"I hope he can do it for one
more week," Gould says.
No matter how Stanford does
at the NCAAs, Blackman will
start the next stage of his tennis
career in June. Just how long it
will be before that career blos

soms, though, is another question.
David Wheaton, who played for
the Cardinal last year as a fresh
man and then turned pro, has
suffered through tough times dur
ing his first year on the tour.
Blackman says Wheaton's woes
might have affected his decision
to stay at Stanford this year, and
he also isn't surprised that
Wheaton had problems.
"It usually takes about a year,
or a year and a half, to start seeing
the kind of results that say 'I can
make a living off of this,' and
then people will say 'All right, he
did the right thing,' " Blackman
says. "It's taken Dave about a
year, but now he's moved into the
top 120."
Blackman has the potential to

do the same. "Martin has the abil
ity to be an outstanding profes
sional," Gould says.
Blackman feels he has enoug
dedication to get through the
tough early months he is bound
to face. "I'm not going to go out
there expecting to lose, but if I'm
working my butt off every day,
week in and week out, and I'm
not doing as well as I think I
should be, I'm just going to hang
in there," Blackman says.
And if the tough times con
tinue? "You can't really make a
judgment in less than two years,
so I'll give it some time," Black
man says. "If a guy's not winning
matches, and he's out of college
and that's his livelihood, that's
something to think about."

After feeling "like I was on the verge of playing some really good tennis" last summer, sophomore
Martin Blackman has decided two years of collegiate tennis is enough and will join the pro tour this
summer.
