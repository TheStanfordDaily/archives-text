# Women netters: good athletes, great people

Gainesville, Fla.
My answering machine
says something to the
effect of: "I'm sorry
I'm not here now, I'm in
Gainesville with nine beautiful
women ..."
The women are the Stanford
tennis team, and since I re
corded the message a week ago,
they've already captured the
national championship, as you
probably know.
With the individual champi
onships coming to a close to
morrow, I offer these thoughts.
This year's edition of the
Stanford Cardinal is not only
composed of great players, it's
composed of great people.
When I spoke to Cindy
Buchsbaum, a senior as well as
the team's captain, after the
final, I was impressed by the
things she had to say about
Coach Frank Brennan.
She didn't go on about how
much Brennan knows about
tennis or how great his record
was — it's 221-29, including
151-9 over the last 160 match
es, by the way. Instead she said
this:
"Frank, first and foremost,
tries to create and form quality
individuals. Quality individuals
before quality tennis players."
In this win-at-any-cost era
in athletics, it was so refresh
ing to hear those words. Espe
cially when one considers they
came from Buchsbaum, who
hardly had an opportunity to
play this year.
She added that it was "really
nice and pleasant to have some
one who has such perspective
in the midst of such greatness."
It seems to me that one of
Brennan's greatest gifts is his
ability to get the women on the
team to keep everything in per
spective as well.
In talking to them at various
times this year, almost every
one cited the importance of ac
ademics to them and how it
influenced their decision to at
tend Stanford
The attitude was exemplified
by Heather Willens, a high
school senior who'll join the
team next vear Willens — who

may not break into the starting
lineup next year — acknowl

basically said the opportunity
to go to Stanford was more
important than a guarantee of
playing tennis.
It's a notion that's anathema
to most coaches in big time
sports, but one that's heart
warming to those of us who
feel like the sports pages report
on almost as much scandal as
sports these days.
And it's got me to thinking
about all these people who
leave school to turn pro — es
pecially in light of the fact that
Jeff Tarango, Martin Black
man and, in all probability,
Tami Whitlinger are going to
do just that.
Whitlinger says she feels like
she's at the point where she
almost can no longer improve
in college She may be right, I
honestly don't know.
It's just that I sit here think
ing about the case of Patty Fen
dick and wonder. Fendick spent
four years at Stanford. Each
year she got better and even
went undefeated as a senior.
