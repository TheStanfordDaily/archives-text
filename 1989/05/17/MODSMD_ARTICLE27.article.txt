# Women netters: good athletes, great people

Gainesville, Fla.
My answering machine
says something to the
effect of: "I'm sorry
I'm not here now, I'm in
Gainesville with nine beautiful
women ..."
The women are the Stanford
tennis team, and since I re
corded the message a week ago,
they've already captured the
national championship, as you
probably know.
With the individual champi
onships coming to a close to
morrow, I offer these thoughts.
This year's edition of the
Stanford Cardinal is not only
composed of great players, it's
composed of great people.
When I spoke to Cindy
Buchsbaum, a senior as well as
the team's captain, after the
final, I was impressed by the
things she had to say about
Coach Frank Brennan.
She didn't go on about how
much Brennan knows about
tennis or how great his record
was — it's 221-29, including
151-9 over the last 160 match
es, by the way. Instead she said
this:
"Frank, first and foremost,
tries to create and form quality
individuals. Quality individuals
before quality tennis players."
In this win-at-any-cost era
in athletics, it was so refresh
ing to hear those words. Espe
cially when one considers they
came from Buchsbaum, who
hardly had an opportunity to
play this year.
She added that it was "really
nice and pleasant to have some
one who has such perspective
in the midst of such greatness."
It seems to me that one of
Brennan's greatest gifts is his
ability to get the women on the
team to keep everything in per
spective as well.
In talking to them at various
times this year, almost every
one cited the importance of ac
ademics to them and how it
influenced their decision to at
tend Stanford
The attitude was exemplified
by Heather Willens, a high
school senior who'll join the
team next vear Willens — who

may not break into the starting
lineup next year — acknowl
edged the team's strength ai:d
basically said the opportunity
to go to Stanford was more
important than a guarantee of
playing tennis.
It's a notion that's anathema
to most coaches in big time
sports, but one that's heart
warming to those of us who
feel like the sports pages report
on almost as much scandal as
sports these days.
And it's got me to thinking
about all these people who
leave school to turn pro — es
pecially in light of the fact that
Jeff Tarango, Martin Black
man and, in all probability,
Tami Whitlinger are going to
do just that.
Whitlinger says she feels like
she's at the point where she
almost can no longer improve
in college She may be right, I
honestly don't know.
It's just that I sit here think
ing about the case of Patty Fen
dick and wonder. Fendick spent
four years at Stanford. Each
year she got better and even
went undefeated as a senior.


MARK ROGOWSKY
She graduated, joined the pro
tour and has been remarkably
successful. Fendick has main
tained a top-25 ranking and made
a good deal of money. Right now,
she's taking time off because of
what I understand is a shoulder
injury.
Speaking about Fendick to Dr.
Peter Bing, former president of
the Board of Trustees, he noted
that if for some reason she
couldn't play again, she has her
degree and can move on.
When Fendick was in school,
Caroline Kuhlman of USC was
also one of the top young players
in the game. Kuhlman was the
last collegian to beat Fendick and
her tennis future seemed just as
bright.

Then she needed knee surgery
and had to stop playing for nearly
two years. She finished her under
graduate work, enrolled in busi
ness school at USC this year and
made her return to the team.
Watching Kuhlman on the court
this week, I saw a fantastic tennis
player who had the mind and all
the strokes. But she was also in
obvious pain at times and unable
to make a lot of shots because
she simply couldn't run them
down.
Her story is the kind that gets
to me and I found myself cheering
her on whenever she played. In
talking to her, I was impressed
with her as a person as well.
In life, Kuhlman, like Fendick,
will be a success.
Whitlinger, Tarango and Black
man may all go through their
careers free from injury and enjoy
great success. Then again, they
might not. Obviously, in making

the commitment to go to school
in the first place, they were not
unlike Willens in realizing the im
portance of education.
But now they're about to say
goodbye to Stanford — and to
their free education. I find myself
failing to understand their moti
vation.
I would think that in the secure,
steady world of Stanford, they'd
have an opportunity to even im
prove their tennis in ways they
can't in the helter skelter world
of the pro tour.
To Tami, Jeff and Martin: I
wish you the best of luck even
though I don't know why you're
doing what you're doing.
I guess I can find solace in the
fact that, despite the constant
pressure put on successful tennis
players to go pro by organizations
with questionable motives — like
the USTA — college tennis is alive
and well.

man and, in all probability,
Tami Whitlinger are going to
do just that.
Whitlinger says she feels like
she's at the point where she
almost can no longer improve
in college She may be right, I
honestly don't know.
It's just that I sit here think
ing about the case of Patty Fen
dick and wonder. Fendick spent
four years at Stanford. Each
year she got better and even
went undefeated as a senior.

She graduated, joined the pro
tour and has been remarkably
successful. Fendick has main
tained a top-25 ranking and made
a good deal of money. Right now,
she's taking time off because of
what I understand is a shoulder
injury.
Speaking about Fendick to Dr.
Peter Bing, former president of
the Board of Trustees, he noted
that if for some reason she
couldn't play again, she has her
degree and can move on.
When Fendick was in school,
Caroline Kuhlman of USC was
also one of the top young players
in the game. Kuhlman was the
last collegian to beat Fendick and
her tennis future seemed just as
bright.

Then she needed knee surgery
and had to stop playing for nearly
two years. She finished her under
graduate work, enrolled in busi
ness school at USC this year and
made her return to the team.
Watching Kuhlman on the court
this week, I saw a fantastic tennis
player who had the mind and all
the strokes. But she was also in
obvious pain at times and unable
to make a lot of shots because
she simply couldn't run them
down.
Her story is the kind that gets
to me and I found myself cheering
her on whenever she played. In
talking to her, I was impressed
with her as a person as well.
In life, Kuhlman, like Fendick,
will be a success.
Whitlinger, Tarango and Black
man may all go through their
careers free from injury and enjoy
great success. Then again, they
might not. Obviously, in making

the commitment to go to school
in the first place, they were not
unlike Willens in realizing the im
portance of education.
But now they're about to say
goodbye to Stanford — and to
their free education. I find myself
failing to understand their moti
vation.
I would think that in the secure,
steady world of Stanford, they'd
have an opportunity to even im
prove their tennis in ways they
can't in the helter skelter world
of the pro tour.
To Tami, Jeff and Martin: I
wish you the best of luck even
though I don't know why you're
doing what you're doing.
I guess I can find solace in the
fact that, despite the constant
pressure put on successful tennis
players to go pro by organizations
with questionable motives — like
the USTA — college tennis is alive
and well.
Gainesville, Fla.
My answering machine
says something to the
effect of: "I'm sorry
I'm not here now, I'm in
Gainesville with nine beautiful
women ..."
The women are the Stanford
tennis team, and since I re
corded the message a week ago,
they've already captured the
national championship, as you
probably know.
With the individual champi
onships coming to a close to
morrow, I offer these thoughts.
This year's edition of the
Stanford Cardinal is not only
composed of great players, it's
composed of great people.
When I spoke to Cindy
Buchsbaum, a senior as well as
the team's captain, after the
final, I was impressed by the
things she had to say about
Coach Frank Brennan.
She didn't go on about how
much Brennan knows about
tennis or how great his record
was — it's 221-29, including
151-9 over the last 160 match
es, by the way. Instead she said
this:
"Frank, first and foremost,
tries to create and form quality
individuals. Quality individuals
before quality tennis players."
In this win-at-any-cost era
in athletics, it was so refresh
ing to hear those words. Espe
cially when one considers they
came from Buchsbaum, who
hardly had an opportunity to
play this year.
She added that it was "really
nice and pleasant to have some
one who has such perspective
in the midst of such greatness."
It seems to me that one of
Brennan's greatest gifts is his
ability to get the women on the
team to keep everything in per
spective as well.
In talking to them at various
times this year, almost every
one cited the importance of ac
ademics to them and how it
influenced their decision to at
tend Stanford
The attitude was exemplified
by Heather Willens, a high
school senior who'll join the
team next vear Willens — who

basically said the opportunity
to go to Stanford was more
important than a guarantee of
playing tennis.
It's a notion that's anathema
to most coaches in big time
sports, but one that's heart
warming to those of us who
feel like the sports pages report
on almost as much scandal as
sports these days.
And it's got me to thinking
about all these people who
leave school to turn pro — es
pecially in light of the fact that
Jeff Tarango, Martin Black
man and, in all probability,
Tami Whitlinger are going to
do just that.
Whitlinger says she feels like
