The forum further suggested
that new minority staff should
have support groups and orienta
tion events in order to introduce
them to working at Stanford.
More training for minority staff

in other areas of expertise and
the development of an English
language instruction program
were also recommended to further
minority opportunities.
The forum also supported cre

some minority workers can ad

Also, the forum recommended
asking outside firms contracted
by the University about their af

to increase the number of minor

Other suggestions were to in

under the changes made by the
UCMI recommendations and to
further develop ethnic cultural
events.
