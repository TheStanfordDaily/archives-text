# Faculty Senate picks new, confident chair
## 
### Morgan Slain Staff writer 
History Prof. Carolyn Lougee
has been elected to lead next
year's Faculty Senate, becoming
the second woman to chair the
group in its 20-year history.
One of the most powerful
forces in University politics, the
55-member senate determines
academic, research and admis
sions policy and approves each
department's degree recommen
dations.
The senate was founded in
1968 to represent the more than
1,300 members of Stanford's
faculty.
In an interview with The Dai
ly, Lougee said her election is
"a good sign that there are a
number of women at Stanford
moving into positions of leader
ship."
Although Lougee said that
women brought to academics "a
different perspective, a sensitiv
ity to different issues," she
added that this perspective
would have less influence on her
senate leadership than her devo
tion to undergraduate educa

tion.
"It is always necessary to take
action, to keep attention on
undergraduate education," she
said. There are strong pulls
away from this attention, in
cluding graduate teaching and
research, she explained.
Lougee said she does not have
an agenda for next year but
plans to talk with many faculty
members to find out what issues
are important to them.
During the next year "proba
bly the biggest issue will be the
non-Western requirement," she
said. "A number of people have
wanted to see that requirement
strengthened."
Lougee started teaching at
Stanford in 1973 and was dean
of Undergraduate Studies from
1982-87. She helped to imple
ment the current system of
undergraduate distribution re
quirements, which the senate
passed in 1980.
Lougee is widely known for
her support of revamping the
old Western Culture program.
In a 1986 senate speech, she
called for a "new model of
shared freshman culture course
.. . to serve the more diversified

population that is now on our
campus and in the country's fu
ture."
The senate's work to resolve
the Western Culture debate and
implement the new Cultures,
Ideas and Values program is "a
really excellent example of how
the senate can adjudicate a
deeply divisive issue," she said.
Lougee is a strong believer in
the current faculty administra
tion system. Although there is
always a need to examine and
improve, Stanford has a "mar
vellous system of faculty gover
nance," she said.
