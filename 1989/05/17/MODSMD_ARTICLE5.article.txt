# New street signs add a sense of direction

### Jennifer Schmid Staff writer 
One hundred five new street
signs are sprouting up on Campus
Drive this week, in a project aimed
to make Stanford less confusing
to navigate.
Why was the $8,000 project in
itiated? Quite simply, "people
were getting lost all the time"
trying to find their way around
campus, said Project Manager
Tom Richman.
Richman said it strains commu
nity relations and is "a tremen
dous waste of money" when
people spend hours driving around
campus because the sign system
is outdated.
The sign project, which replaces
a 20- to 30-year-old system, has
a total budget of $320,000 and
consists of five parts:
• Street signs to help people
find Campus Drive,
• Directional signs to help
people find buildings and sections
of the campus,
• Campus directories — large
weather-proof maps — at all
campus entrances,
• Pedestrian directories at
various points on campus, and
• Small folding maps for
visitors, available at campus in

ting lost all the

formation centers and the Book
store for a quarter.
Of these five parts, the new
directional signs and the folding
maps are already in place, while
the street signs should be finished
soon.
Richman said a prototype of the
new pedestrian directory will be
set up next week, with the rest
of the directories to be finished
by next September.
He said $320,000 may seem like
a lot of money to spend on signs,
but the University has held down
costs as much as possible by using
wooden signs instead of fiberglass,
which is three times as expensive.
A few modifications will be nec
essary for the directional signs,
Richman said, because some
people were confused by signs
directing them to the Stern Hall
parking lot rather than the front
of the building.
