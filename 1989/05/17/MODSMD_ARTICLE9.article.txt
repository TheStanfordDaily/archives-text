ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP)
— The Marxist government
crushed a military coup attempt
yesterday, official radio said after
sporadic gunfire rattled through
the capital and troops sealed off
strategic points.
"A few generals and officers at
tempted to topple the government
and install a military regime
today, but their attempt failed,"
said the Addis Ababa radio broad
cast, attributed to the ruling State
Council.
It did not mention casualties or
arrests. The capital was quiet
early this morning.
Shooting erupted in downtown
Addis Ababa several hours after
President Mengistu Haile Mariam,
in power for nearly 15 years, left
the capital with his wife for a
visit to East Germany.
The State Council announce
ment was broadcast at 8:06 p.m.,
about four hours after gunfire
began.
"As the attempt made by the
few generals and officers to
quench their narrow-minded
thirst for power was dangerous
and created suitable conditions
for the anti-Ethiopia forces that
eagerly awaited internally and ex
ternally to divide the country and
to expose the society to immense
suffering, quick action was taken

and the attempt was foiled," it
said.
Troops and tanks rushed to po
sitions around the Defense Mini
stry, presidential palace and other
government buildings. Two air
force jet fighters and then a half
dozen military helicopters circled
the capital, but there were no in
dications they opened fire.
The international airport was
closed and communications were
cut.
Air traffic controllers at the air
port could be heard by radio
monitors diverting flights to the
small country of Djibouti about
200 miles to the northeast.
One controller told a pilot: "No
explanations. No explanations."
Addis Ababa radio broadcasted
the state council statement four
times, and at 8:39 p.m. it said,
"Listeners: The national service
of Voice of Ethiopia now winds
up its program for today. We say
goodnight until we meet during
our program tomorrow morning."
The broadcast was monitored
in Nairobi, Kenya, and by the
British Broadcasting Corp.
Reports conflicted of what hap
pened, but none of the accounts
reported casualties.
The shooting began at about 4
p.m. with gunfire at the Defense
Ministry.
