# Students refuse Kennedy's offer to meet next week
## 
### John Wagner Editorial staff 
Members of the Agenda for Action coalition and
University President Donald Kennedy have yet to
see eye to eye on when they will meet face to face.
Kennedy yesterday offered the coalition a choice
of three available meeting times, one each on Mon
day, Tuesday and Wednesday.
As of late last night, members of the coalition
which took over Kennedy's office for nine hours
Monday and rallied Tuesday for the right to have
a greater say in formulating the University's agenda
had not agreed on a meeting time with Kennedy.
The coalition demanded that they meet with Ken
nedy before he makes his address on the Under
graduate Committee on Minority Issues report this
afternoon to the Academic Council.
Kennedy is scheduled to address the council, which
is comprised of all tenure-track professors, at 4:30
p.m. The coalition plans to rally outside the Braun
Music Center while Kennedy makes his remarks.
Negotiations for a meeting time between the co
alition and Assoc. Dean of Student Affairs Michael
Jackson, who represented Kennedy yesterday, had
broken off by 11 p.m. last night.
Richard Suh, a coalition member, said Kennedy's
offer to meet on Monday was not satisfactory. "We
want to meet with him, but if it could be sooner,
it would be better," Suh said. "We'd like to break
the tensions and start negotiating as soon as pos
sible."
According to Stacey Leytoii, a coalition member
and current Council of Presidents member, "People
are really frustrated because they're wondering if
the administration is serious about working things
out."
Invitations were issued by the administration yes
terday to the chairs of the Asian-American Students
Association, the Black Student Union, MEChA and
the Stanford American Indian Organization to at
tend Kennedy's presentation this afternoon.
According to Director of University Relations
Stephen Peeps, the invitations were extended by
the administration in recognition of the student
leaders' commitment to the UCMI recommen
dations.
Members of the Agenda for Ac
tion coalition downplayed the sig
nificance of the invitations.
Suh said he considered the in
vitations a victory, but as a re
sponse from the administration
he said, "it is still not adequate."
"If (Kennedy) didn't invite (the
student leaders) at this point, he'd
be in trouble," Suh said. "He
would get a lot of people angrier."
According to David Brown, a
coalition member and a COP
member, the administration made
"a nice gesture, but it doesn't
mean anything at all."
The invitations were not issued
as a concession to demands made
during Monday's takeover of Ken
nedy's office by the Agenda for
Action coaliton, Peeps said.
According to Arthur Coladarci,
academic secretary to the Univer
sity, "It would be unseemly [for
the administration] to respond to
such an irrational protest."
According to Coladarci, the
charter of the Academic Council
says nothing about who can attend

the meetings. Traditionally, he
said, attendance has been limited
to professors and special guests
of the professors.
Peeps said he was not aware of
past precedents regarding student
invitations to the Academic Coun
cil. "It's fair to say that these
were special invitations," he said.
Peeps said it was "unclear" if
there would be a chance for stu
dents to speak with Kennedy
about their concerns at the Aca
demic Council meeting. A
dialogue is not included in the
meeting's formal agenda.
The Academic Council is com
prised of the 1,184 full professors,
assistant professors and associate
professors at the University. The
council holds one regularly sched
uled meeting annually, at which
the University president and Fac
ulty Senate chair issue progress
reports.
According to Coladarci, only 50
to 75 professors have attended the
council meetings in past years.
Due to the great anticipation sur
rounding Kennedy's address on
the UCMI report, the turnout
today may be much greater, he
said.
As part of the Academic Council

meeting, the University president
traditionally remarks on a subject
of current interest, according to
Coladarci. Kennedy's decision to
respond to recommendations
made by the UCMI report was
made several months ago,
Coladarci said.
In addition to the leaders of the
student minority groups, the ad
ministration has invited the full
UCMI and members of the UCMI
Interim Task Force to attend the
meeting. The UCMI includes four
students: Brian Kim of AASA, Da
vid Porter of the BSU, Jerilyn
Lopez Mendoza of MEChA, and
Joseph Thomas of SAIO.
Three students are also desig
nated as "permanent guests" of
Faculty Senate and Academic
Council and therefore have been
invited to attend today's Academic
Council meeting: Porter, as ASSU
Senate Chair; Leyton, as a COP
representative, and Tasha Cas
taneda, as a member-ai-large.
The meeting will begin at 4:30
p.m. in the Campbell Recital Hall
in Braun Music Center. Kennedy's
address will be carried live on
KZSU and broadcast in Dinkel
spiel Auditorium, which will be
open to the public.
