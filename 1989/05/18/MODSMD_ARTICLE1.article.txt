### John Wagner Editorial staff 
Members of the Agenda for Action coalition and
University President Donald Kennedy have yet to
see eye to eye on when they will meet face to face.
Kennedy yesterday offered the coalition a choice
of three available meeting times, one each on Mon
day, Tuesday and Wednesday.
As of late last night, members of the coalition
which took over Kennedy's office for nine hours
Monday and rallied Tuesday for the right to have
a greater say in formulating the University's agenda
had not agreed on a meeting time with Kennedy.
The coalition demanded that they meet with Ken
nedy before he makes his address on the Under
graduate Committee on Minority Issues report this
afternoon to the Academic Council.
Kennedy is scheduled to address the council, which
is comprised of all tenure-track professors, at 4:30
p.m. The coalition plans to rally outside the Braun
Music Center while Kennedy makes his remarks.
Negotiations for a meeting time between the co
alition and Assoc. Dean of Student Affairs Michael
Jackson, who represented Kennedy yesterday, had
broken off by 11 p.m. last night.
Richard Suh, a coalition member, said Kennedy's
offer to meet on Monday was not satisfactory. "We
want to meet with him, but if it could be sooner,
it would be better," Suh said. "We'd like to break
the tensions and start negotiating as soon as pos
sible."
According to Stacey Leytoii, a coalition member
and current Council of Presidents member, "People
are really frustrated because they're wondering if
the administration is serious about working things
out."
Invitations were issued by the administration yes
terday to the chairs of the Asian-American Students
Association, the Black Student Union, MEChA and
the Stanford American Indian Organization to at
tend Kennedy's presentation this afternoon.
According to Director of University Relations
Stephen Peeps, the invitations were extended by
the administration in recognition of the student
leaders' commitment to the UCMI recommen
dations.
