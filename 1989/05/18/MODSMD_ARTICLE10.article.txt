# One million Chinese march for reform
## Unprecedented pro-democracy rally coincides with Gorbachev's visit 
### 
BEIJING (AP) - More than
one million jubilant people
awarmed into central Beijing yes
terday to shout their support for
students who are fasting for de
mocracy. It was the largest show
of defiance in Communist China's
40-year history.
More than 75,000 students took
to the streets in more than two
dozen other cities, a clear sign the
pro-democracy movement has
taken on a nationwide scope after
being confined largely to Beijing.
The massive yet peaceful dis
plays of grass-roots unity put
more pressure on the government
to resolve an impasse with the
student-led movement, which has
gained broadening support among
the rest of the populace.
The catalyst for the demonstra
tions is the 3,000 students who
began staging a hunger strike Sat
urday in Beijing's sprawling
Tiananmen Square, timing their
protest to coincide with Soviet
President Mikhail Gorbachev's
historic trip to China.
"Delay means death," read one
of the hundreds of banners
carried through Tiananmen dur
ing the gigantic march, which was
dominated by workers rather than
students for the first time since
the pro-democracy rallies began
April 15.
Government and party officials
met yesterday with two student
representatives. The students said
later they were optimistic an
agreement would be reached
quickly on their demands, which
include a formal meeting with au
thorities broadcast live on televi
sion.
Students early yesterday .had
rejected an appeal by Communist
Party chief Zhao Ziyang for an
end to the strike, although he
promised "concrete measures" to
advance democracy.
A deluge of letters and petitions
demanding the goverment make

concessions poured into govern
ment offices from professors, art
ists, youth groups and China's
normally silent non-communist
parties. Some members of Parlia
ment joined the protest.
Astrophysicist Fang Lizhi, who
is China's most famous dissident
but has kept a low profile during
the protests, said in an interview
with Hong Kong television that
some leaders should step down.
He did not say who should resign
but indicated he felt it should be
Premier Li Peng and senior leader

Deng Xiaoping.
Beijing residents on foot,
bicycle, pedicab and bus flocked
throughout the day to Tianan
men, the symoblic center of power
in China, to support the hunger
striking students.
The protesters — whose num
bers included government employ
ees and even soldiers — filled the
100-acre square and marched
down the streets of central
Beijing, chanting slogans and
singing.
"The hearts of all the people

are linked together," said a
worker from the Beijing Jeep
Corp., a joint venture with U.S.-
based Chrysler Corp, as he
paraded down Changan Avenue,
the main boulevard of this capital
of 10 million people.
Police did not try to stop the
demonstration and even helped
clear the streets for ambulances
that shuttled weakened fasters to
the city's hospitals every few
minutes. They also guarded shops
against looting as the demonstra
tion extended into the night.
