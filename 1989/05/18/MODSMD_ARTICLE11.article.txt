FRANKFURT, West Germany
(AP) — A court yesterday con
victed Mohammed Ali Hamadi of
hyacking a TWA jetliner and kil
ling a U.S. sailor, then sentenced
him to life in prison for crimes
the murdered man's parents said
deserve death.
Chief Judge Heiner Mueck
enberger gave the Lebanese Shiite
Moslem the maximum penalty for
the 1985 hijacking and the brutal
beating and murder of Robert
Stethem, 23, of Waldorf, Md. West
Germany has no death penalty.
Hamadi's trial provided a rare
look into the planning and execu
tion of a major terrorist attack,
plus chilling witness testimony of
the terror and brutality aboard
the seized aircraft.
During the ordeal, 39 Ameri
cans were held hostage for 17
days.
The parents of the slain Navy
diver, breaking the silence they
had kept throughout the 10-
month trial, said death would
have been a more appropriate

penalty for the 24-year-old terror
ist.
"Our family maintains
Mohammed Ali Hamadi deserves
punishment more severe than al
lowable under German law," Rich
ard Stethem said.
But the couple said the West
German court conducted a fair
and impartial trial. They warned,
however, against the "possible po
litical commutation" of Hamadi's
sentence.
In Washington, White House
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said
that while "we would have
preferred extradition" to the
United States, "we were satisfied
and gratified by the outcome.
"We expect he will serve his full
sentence in accordance with Ger
man law," Fitzwater said.
Peter Korneck, one of the
prosecutors, said Hamadi will be
eligible for a parole review in 15
years. Hamadi's defense lawyers
said they expected to appeal the
sentence.
The Stethems attended all of

the trial's 65 sessions since it
began July 5, 1988.
"Our purpose for being there
was to represent our son. I
thought he deserved that. With
all his bravery I felt he deserved
more than that," Patricia Stet
hem said, her voice quaking with
emotion.
Mueckenberger announced the
verdict and sentence to a packed
courtroom inside the fortress-like
Preungesheim prison in
Frankfurt.
TWA Flight 847 was seized on
June 14, 1985, after the Boeing
727 took off from Athens for
Rome. The plane flew twice to
Algiers and three times to Beirut
on the hijackers' orders.
Stethem was shot and thrown
onto the runway to die when the
plane landed the second time in
Beirut on June 15, 1985.
Mueckenberger said the court
was unable to decide who actually
shot Stethem.
