Record exports cut trade deficit
WASHINGTON (AP) - The U.S. trade deficit,
benefiting from record export sales, shrank dram
atically to $8.86 billion in March. The government
report yesterday prompted some economists to
question their earlier assessment that the coun
try's trade improvement had stalled out.
The Commerce Department said the March
deficit was down 9.8 percent from the February
imbalance of $9.82 billion, a figure that was itself
lowered from an initial report a month ago, which
had put the February deficit at $10.5 billion.
The March improvement came from a 7.4 per
cent rise in exports, which hit a record $30.78
billion. Imports rose 3 percent to $39.64 billion,
pushed upward by rising oil prices.
Analysts, who had been looking for little or no
improvement in the March figure, noted that
sales of American manufactured goods and farm
products were up sharply, helping to lower the
deficit with all major U.S. trading partners.
The deficit with Canada, the country's largest
trading partner, declined to $248 million, its
lowest in almost eight years. The United States

ran a rare trade surplus of $397 million with
Western Europe, the best showing in six years.
Poland legalizes Catholic Church
WARSAW, Poland (AP) â€” Parliament brought
an official end to the communist government's
40-year-old struggle with Roman Catholicism by
passing laws yesterday that formally legalize the
church and guarantee freedom of worship.
Passage of the three bills is seen as clearing
the way for diplomatic relations between the
Vatican and this devoutly Roman Catholic nation,
which would be a first for a member of the Soviet
bloc.
The religion legislation was drafted in
protracted negotiations between the Polish
church hierarchy and officials of the government
and Communist Party.
It defines and guarantees the church's rights
to conduct religious, educational and charitable
activities and govern its own affairs, such as
making appointments to clerical offices. Citizens
are protected against discrimination for their
beliefs.
