## Make UCMI fly 
### 
TODAY COULD BE the day.
Students and administra
tors could resume con
structive communication on mi
nority issues. Or the current
counterproductive standoff could
continue.
Much depends on the "progress
report" University President
Donald Kennedy will deliver
today to the Academic Council.
The council's 4:30 p.m. meeting
will be broadcasted live in Dink
elspiel Auditorium for the public.
More than ever, in light of the
campus chaos and widespread
public scrutiny of the past week,
it is critical that Kennedy com
municate clearly and explicitly to
show how the University is set
ting goals, priorities and
timelines toward the achievement
of a better University for the en
tire student body.
Though Kennedy himself does
not have the power to implement
many recommendations — hiring
professors, for example — he

does have the symbolic leadership
authority to sway policy signifi
cantly. For example, Kennedy's
demonstrated personal interest
in an environmental studies
course sequence has been part of
the driving force behind its pos
sible implementation.
One of the motivations for
Monday's protest was that some
students — particularly students
of color — feel Kennedy has been
neither clear nor communicative
with them concerning the prog
ress of UCMI. It is essential that
his comments respond to the spe
cific concerns of these students,
and that he confine any con
demnation of them to their tac
tics, not their goals.
Kennedy has claimed to be an
ally of the students of color, and
has directed much attention in
the past few weeks to today's
speech. It is to be hoped that
those who have waited — some
less patiently than others — will
not be disappointed.
