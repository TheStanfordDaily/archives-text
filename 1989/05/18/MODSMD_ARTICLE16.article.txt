SOME STANFORD men are
treating some Stanford
women violently and the
women are at last speaking out.
Acquaintance or "date" rape,
not the stereotypical dark alley
assault, accounted for 98 percent
of rapes reported by 26 percent
of Stanford undergraduate wom
en, according to a survey released
this week.
That means rapists may live
in your dormitory, attend your
history class or play softball on
your intramural team.
The equality women have
struggled for is compromised by
interpersonal relationships
poisoned by attitudes of male

dominance expressed through
sexual assault. And this form of
relationship is evidently present
at Stanford.
The best way to shatter these
perverse attitudes is through ed
ucation and active discussion by
both men and women about the
real danger of sexual violence and
the inexcusable continuation of
sexism — regardless if it's in
private or in public. The human
ity of women does not end at the
bed cover.
Stanford needs escorts and im
proved lighting. But these meas
ures would only address the
symptoms, not the cause of the
problem.
