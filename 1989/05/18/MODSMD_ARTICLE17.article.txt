## Takeover necessary for progress toward diversity 
### 
WE ENTHUSIASTICALLY
applaud the takeover of Uni
versity President Donald Ken
nedy's office on May 15. It was a bold
and courageous action in the best
tradition of students and of America.
The students were criticized for not
waiting until Kennedy's speech on the
UCMI report today, but the students
took over the building precisely because
Kennedy was preparing to give his
UCMI address three days later.
Students wanted a say in the deci
sions about the report that they con
ceived and fought for, but Kennedy's
response was "send me your ideas" not
"you get a say on what gets imple
mented, and when it will happen."
Locked out of the decision-making

process, the students responded by let
ting themselves into Kennedy's office.
These demands are by no means
new. They have been around since
1968 when the Black Student Union
took the microphone from the Univer
sity provost and issued 10 demands for
Stanford to meet if it was serious
about fighting racism. More than 20
years later, that agenda remains essen
tially unfulfilled. A healthy dose of
skepticism about Kennedy's speech is
understandable.
It was also important to act dramati
cally in order to bring the issues at
Stanford into the national spotlight.
Traditionally, the University has been
more inclined to make changes when
the whole country is watching.

A careful reading of history will
show that Stanford has only made
progress toward diversity as a result of
the struggles of students of color.
Often, that pressure involved civil
disobedience. In fact, UCMI would not
even exist were it not for a sit-in in
the President's Office in 1987.
Monday's takeover was just the
beginning of what will be a protracted
struggle to change this University. And
it was a very successful beginning. The
reality of institutional racism at Stan
ford has been exposed to all.
Most of the good things about our
country have come about through civil
disobedience. America was founded as
an act of civil disobedience. Fleeing
slavery, riding in the front of the bus,

integration of schools, sitting at a
lunch counter and exercising the right
to vote were all acts of civil dis
obedience for people of color.
And now, demanding a truly multi
cultural college experience in return for
$19,000 a year is an act of civil dis
obedience.
This action has galvanized students
at Stanford like nothing else recently.
These issues are in the interests of
every student on campus. Lower tui
tion, more financial aid, more teaching
assistants and ethnic studies would
enrich all of Stanford.
