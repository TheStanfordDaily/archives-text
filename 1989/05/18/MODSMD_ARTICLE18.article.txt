Daily needs work
on Mexican history
As Mexican students at Stanford, we
were glad to see The Daily and the
Stanford community celebrate the
"Cinco de Mayo" holiday. However, the
May 5 articles inaccurately presented
the historical facts surrounding the
battle where the Mexican army
defeated Napoleon Ill's troops at
Puebla.
In the first place, Mexico's Indepen
dence Da> is celebrated on Sept. 16 in
commemoration of the 1810 proclama
tion of independence from Spain, and
not on May 5, as The Daily suggested.
Furthermore, the French army was not
driven out of Mexico after the 1862
Battle for Puebla, nor had Napoleon
111 invaded Mexico "years before" that
date.

We hope that The Daily will be more
careful in the future before recounting
historical events of this importance.

Why is Trudeau our
farewell speaker?
As Stanford approaches its 98th
Commencement address, little has been
said about the merits or qualifications
of Gary Trudeau. I suggest that no
one has raised much of an objection
about frudeau because to do so would

in some way reveal "close-mindedness"
(How, I don't know).
Granted, Trudeau is one of the most
popular comic writers of our day. So
what. While Stanford will introduce yet
another lame Commencement speaker,
supposedly "lesser" schools like Boston
University will introduce not only Pres
ident Bush, but President Francois
Mitterrand as well. Does anyone still
consider Trudeau a "coup," as The
Daily reported?
Mention the fact that Trudeau will
be speaking at graduation to family
and friends and the reaction is almost
universal: "What qualifies a comic
strip writer to address your class?"
And I have to be perfectly honest in
response: "Well, he follows a trend of
lame and liberal Commencement
speakers here; it's become somewhat of
a recent tradition."
Perhaps Stanford students are simply
spoiled by the routine great minds on

campus. But do we really have to be
so desperate in our quest to get some
one outside the Stanford community?
Stanford needs to seriously re
evaluate the purpose of the Commence
ment speaker, since it seems to be
re-evaluating everything else anyhow:
It is not to make a political statement,
as the two most recent speakers have
done. The graduating class should be
excited about the selection of the
speaker, not indifferent. Best of luck to
the class of '90.
