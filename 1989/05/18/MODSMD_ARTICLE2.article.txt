# Safety vs. expense: Office agendas clash
## 
### Jock Friedly Editorial staff 
The University plans to release
campus air quality studies tomor
row, the results of which officials
say will not be nearly as contro
versial as their history.
The air quality reports analyze
the problem of "re-entrainment"
— the process in which potentially
toxic fumes from exhaust vents
can filter back into a facility —
at buildings all over campus.
Project Management, which
commissioned the air quality
studies, tries to design aestheti
cally pleasing buildings — costing
nearly $100 million annually —
at the cheapest price and in the
shortest time possible. Health and
Safety, however, tries to add fea
tures to buildings that can be ugly,
costly and can delay construction,

but that can also save lives.
But past disruptions in the bal
ance between the two offices,
caused by occasional inter
departmental squabbles, can
sometimes mean that necessary
life-saving design features are for
gotten or ignored.
'Severe' re-entrainment
One study in particular — one
of two studies performed on re
entrainment at the Environmental
Safety Facility, where Health and
Safety employees work — gener
ated a storm of protest and hos
tility when it was completed last
fall. The heated dispute made its
way to the office of University
President Donald Kennedy.
The report, written by Fred
Shair of the California Institute


Kai Keasey—Daily
The Environmental Safety Facility has had problems with smoke from their infectious waste
incinerator re-entering the building, exposing Health and Safety workers to potentially
dangerous fumes.
of Technology, points to "severe"
problems of re-entrainment, ac
cording to several sources in Fa
cilities Project Management and
Health and Safety who have read
the report. Employees worry that
the smoke blowing back into the
building from the facility's infec
tious waste incinerator could
result in serious health problems.
But, the result of that "severe"
problem is open to interpretation
because risk-analysis is such an
inexact science. The Shair report
did not address the risk level of
the exposure to re-entrainment.
About the Shair report, The
Daily has found the following:
• When the report was com
pleted, project manager David
Cooper did not send copies of it
to Health and Safety workers who
were members of the committee
studying the problem. Only after
one committee member demanded
a copy did he receive one. The
report was stamped "Confiden
tial."
• At an October meeting atten
ded by more than 30 Health and
Safety workers at the Environ
mental Safety Facility, the audi
ence grilled Cooper, who led the
meeting, because many of them
thought he was concealing infor
mation about the Shair report.
• Some Health and Safety em
ployees say Cooper had a great
deal at stake because he was a
supervisor of the construction of
the Environmental Safety Facility,
a building found to have more
than 2,700 design flaws after it
was constructed two years ago.

• When the meeting ended, ad
ministrative assistant Gwen Cone
of Health and Safety rushed off
an electronic mail message to
Curt Williams, director of Facili
ties Project Management, who is
Cooper's supervisor. In the mes
sage, which she also sent to Ken
nedy, Cone wrote that Dennis
Leung, a project engineer who
commissioned the report, was
being pressured by Cooper into
remaining silent at the meeting.
• Within days after Kennedy re
ceived Cone's message, Cooper
resigned from the project.
Hot meeting
Although the meeting seemed
like a commonly occurring clash
of personalities, the implications
were possibly far-reaching: The
meeting did much to damage the
relationship between the two of
fices.
For the people involved, the
hour-and-a-half-long meeting
highlighted the clash between the
two offices.
Cooper told the audience they
would not get copies of the report
because they would not under
stand it. Further, Health and
Safety workers charge that
Cooper did not disclose important
details of the report at the meet
ing that would help workers
decide whether they were being
exposed significant hazards.
"For David to make the state
ment that [everything was fine],
that got me a little bit fired be
cause I have to live out here and
a lot of people I care about live
out here," said Gary Schell, a
Health and Safety employee who
was one of the most outspoken at

the meeting.
"They heard me wrong,"
Cooper said. "I never would have
said there was nothing [to worry
about]."
"I don't think it was anything
short of falsification of facts," one
person at the meeting said about
Cooper's interpretation of the
Shair report.
During the meeting, one Health
and Safety employee requested
that Shair be brought from Cal
tech to give a presentation on the
findings. Cooper refused, saying
that Shair was not easy to work
with and probably would not be
available to make the trip to Stan
ford.
"It would not have made sense
for him to come out until we had
analyzed the report ourselves,"
Cooper said in a recent interview.
But those present did not agree
with this assessment.
"David made an unfortunate
faux pas in meeting manage
ment," according to Peter Burnes,
a Health and Safety official at the
meeting. "He gave a hard-line an
swer to a question that was beg
ging communication." For the
most part, Cooper said he agreed
with Burnes' statement.
Although people present said
there was a general atmosphere
of mistrust of Cooper's presenta
tion throughout the meeting,
Cooper's negative answer to the
question sparked what some
workers called a "hostile" ex
change of words between Cooper
and the audience.
"It was a spin-out," Burnes
said. "The meeting ended on that
kind of note, with people feeling
as if they had been shut down."
Shortly after the meeting,
copies of the report were distrib

uted to Health and Safety
workers. Perhaps most ironic
about the incident, however, was
that Health and Safety workers
generally agreed after they read
the report that although it showed
a significant re-entrainment prob
lem, it wasn't very controversial.
"When people don't have infor
mation, people make a lot of as
sumptions," said Doug Brown,
who was associate director of
Health and Safety at the time.
Charges of 'intimidation'
But even after they were com
forted by reading the reports,
Health and Safety employees were
still left with a lingering feeling
of mistrust towards officials in
Project Management.
"It seemed to me that Dennis
was being overruled," Cone said
in a recent interview. "If I were
in his shoes, I would feel in
timidated."
"I think [he was] being in
timidated by the upper manage
ment," Schell agreed.
Leung told The Daily that he
did not agree with some of the
things Cooper said at the meeting,
but he did not comment on
whether he had been intimidated
by Cooper. Cooper also refused to
comment on this matter.
"It wasn't an intimidation
issue," said University auditor
David Fetterman, who authored
a report on charges made last year
by a Health and Safety worker
that some of his superiors in
timidated him. In the report, Fet
terman defined intimidation as
"the act of compelling or deterring
an individual by threat."
Whatever it be called, many
people interviewed by The Daily

expressed the belief that Cooper
had a great deal at stake with the
facility: He was one of the people
chiefly responsible for building
the Environmental Safety Facility
that one employee called a "bel
lyflop."
"David had a lot to do with the
construction of the facility," ac
cording to Schell. Schell and
several other employees expressed
the concern that he might have
wanted to conceal any possible
embarrassment about the facility.
"That's not true," Cooper
responded to the allegations.
"There were many people a lot
closer to the project than I was."
Personality conflicts
The Shair report incident dem
onstrates one of the mtyor diffi
culties with the relationship be
tween Health and Safety and Proj
ect Management in the last few
years: Personality conflicts some
times obscure more important
concerns.
Jon Moldestad, a former Health
and Safety employee who was per
haps the most vocal about em
phasizing safety issues, often was
upset about Project Manage
ment's handling of safety issues,

Moldestad's relationship to
Project Management was similar
to Cooper's relationship with
Health and Safety, one filled with
tension that often turned to hos
tility. Moldestad was one of the
chief opponents of many of the
design plans for the Environmen
tal Safety Facility.
Divergent goals
According to Fetterman, whose
report covered many of these is
sues, the Shair report incident is
"symptomatic of a much bigger
problem" than simple personality
problems.
In his report released in August
last year, Fetterman showed that
the interaction between the two
offices was poor.
"It's a general problem of not
having the same goals and mis
sions," Assoc. Director of Health
and Safety Alain Decleve said.
Despite problems in the past,
Health and Safety officials agree
that many changes in the rela
tionship between the two offices
have been made to facilitate in
teraction.
"I see the process changing be
cause they've learned some hard
lessons," Schell said.
