# Safety vs. expense: Office agendas clash
## 
### Jock Friedly Editorial staff 
The University plans to release
campus air quality studies tomor
row, the results of which officials
say will not be nearly as contro
versial as their history.
The air quality reports analyze
the problem of "re-entrainment"
— the process in which potentially
toxic fumes from exhaust vents
can filter back into a facility —
at buildings all over campus.
Project Management, which
commissioned the air quality
studies, tries to design aestheti
cally pleasing buildings — costing
nearly $100 million annually —
at the cheapest price and in the
shortest time possible. Health and
Safety, however, tries to add fea
tures to buildings that can be ugly,
costly and can delay construction,

but that can also save lives.
But past disruptions in the bal
ance between the two offices,
caused by occasional inter
departmental squabbles, can
sometimes mean that necessary
life-saving design features are for
gotten or ignored.
'Severe' re-entrainment
One study in particular — one
of two studies performed on re
entrainment at the Environmental
Safety Facility, where Health and
Safety employees work — gener
ated a storm of protest and hos
tility when it was completed last
fall. The heated dispute made its
way to the office of University
President Donald Kennedy.

The Environmental Safety Facility has had problems with smoke from their infectious waste
incinerator re-entering the building, exposing Health and Safety workers to potentially
dangerous fumes.
