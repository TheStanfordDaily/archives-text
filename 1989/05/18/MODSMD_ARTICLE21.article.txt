## Students do have a voice 
### 
A BIG LIE sits at the heart of the
student occupation of the Presi
dent's Office Monday, and demon
strators fed that lie to both the Stanford
community and local and national ob
servers.
The lie is that we students have no
say in University policy. The protesters
claimed that we have been denied access
to "legitimate" avenues of power, that
we have failed repeatedly to affect change
through University-sanctioned means,
and that therefore we must engage the
University through direct action and
large-scale civil disobedience.
Come on. Even the most superficial
examination of Stanford's policy and
recent history exposes those premises as
grossly and obviously false.
The engines of change at this school
are University committees, not adminis
trative declarations. These groups of 10
to 20 people oversee everything from
undergraduate curriculum to residential
education. They accumulate data, discuss
options and set policy. Mundane as it
seems, nothing important happens at
Stanford without passing through a com
mittee — look at the University
Committee on Minority Issues or the Stu
dent Conduct Legislative Council.
Student representation on University
committees is large, continual and
respected. In committees a student's vote
counts for as much as a faculty member's.
The administration has no voting power
in most committees. None. Zero.
Is committee service frustrating? Yes,
tremendously so; I've served on commit
tees for three years. Nobody at Stanford
enjoys working in a glacial bureaucracy.

But the simple fact is that committees
are the seats of power around here. If
we want power-sharing, we've already got
it with a vengeance.
God knows I've got gripes against this
University, but lack of student access is
not one of them. (In fact, I think that
students probably have too much control
over educational policy.) The Stanford ad
ministration seems to bend over back
wards to respond to perceived student
needs, especially on minority issues.
The school has made affirmative action
an extremely high priority. It plunged
into collective angst and action over the
Ujaama and Otero incidents. It created
an independent committee to issue policy
guidelines specifically on minority issues.
It is currently trying to implement that
committee's month-old recommen
dations.
Ironically, the administration seems to
have little substantive disagreement with
Monday's protesters. Take the Agenda
for Action's call for a full-time Chicano
dean. Agenda for Action wants one. But
wait, so does Stanford, which plans to
make that deanship a full-time position
starting in September.
So where's the beef? The only disa
greement on this point seems to be about
how much influence MEChA gets to exert
in the selection process — an issue of
political power and organizational influ
ence, not racial insensitivity.
There's a means-and-ends problem
here. Shutting down the administrative
center of the University is vastly out of
proportion to what the demonstrators
were trying to achieve, especially since
their goals were either based on lies (no

student input), angling for political
leverage (MEChA's influence in the se
lection of the Chicano dean), or couched
in vagaries ("Hey, hey, ho, ho, the ad
ministration's too damn slow.").
Nice slogan, but if all you're protesting
is the administrative calendar, then there
are more appropriate and effective ways
to express dissatisfaction than disrupting
classes and breaking the law.
Monday's demonstrators can pretend
to bask in the historical glow of the civil
rights movement — a la Tuesday's
column from"the front" — but all they
share with the heroes of that movement
are tactics and superficially similar rhet
oric.
To compare accelerating Stanford's
already-declared policies to granting black
Americans the rights guaranteed to them
under the Constitution — and to say it
with a straight face — trivializes and
demeans our historic, national struggle
for racial justice.
The real motive behind the latest
protests is almost certainly to influence
today's meeting between University Pres
ident Donald Kennedy and the Academic
Council. Tomorrow's Daily will tell us
how effective this tactic was.
