## Birch advances to the brink of making tennis history 
### Mark Rogowsky Editorial staff 
GAINESVILLE, Fla. - Three
down, two to go.
At the start of competition at
the NCAA Women's Tennis Cham
pionships yesterday, Sandra Birch
needed to win five matches to cap
ture the singles and doubles
championships. At day's end, she
needed to win only two more.
Birch opened with a singles win
against teammate Lisa Green and
came hack to score two impressive
doubles victories with partner
Debbie Graham.
If Birch wins the singles and
doubles — the singles begins at
5 p.m. (EDT) and the doubles will
follow — she'll be the first woman
in NCAA history to capture the
team title and both individual
titles in the same yeai.
The day began under the hot
noontime sun with the all-
Cardinal semifinal. In a rematch
of an October meeting at the
ITCA All-American Tournament
in which Birch beat Green, the
outcome was the same. The score
yesterday was 6-4, 6-2.
Green's serve was broken in the
first game and Birch came back
with a love game to move ahead
2-0. They then traded games to
3-2 and Green got a service break
to pull even at 3-3.
"I got up 2-0 and she started
to get really on," Birch said.
But, as so often happens, the
break was followed by a break,
and Birch led 4-3. The set re
mained on serve as Birch won it
6-4.
In the second set, Birch got a
break to move up 2-1 and never
looked back. She also broke Green
in the seventh game to take a 5-2
lead. After the changeover, Birch
served a love game to earn a spot
in the final.
Playing a teammate obviously
taxed both of the players mentally,
and perhaps Green a bit more.

"I was ready to play," said
Green, who has made the NCAA
singles semifinals in each of her
three years. "[But] 1 get really
nervous playing people on my own
team."
Said Birch: "It was hard (to
play Lisa). I try not to let it bother
me when I'm playing a teammate
[though], I try to block out who's
on the other side of the net."
Green, traditionally a baseliner,
tried a more aggressive, attacking
style of play against Birch. "I was
trying to come in (to net) a little
bit more," she said. "But I wasn't
making a very good first volley.
[And] my first serve wasn't very
good.
"I made a lot of unforced er
rors," Green added. "I didn't work
the points well enough."
The lack of coaching on both
sides may have also had more af
fect on Green than Birch. "It helps
me to have a coach out there,"
she noted.
"Sometimes I do get spacey,"
she added, explaining that the
little reminders she gets on how
to hit her groundstrokes and such
often get her back on track.
Birch said of Green: "She really
likes that bang-bang tennis . . .
When she's on, she can beat
anybody."
Yesterday, Green wasn't quite
on and Birch took advantage of
her opportunity to move to center
stage.
"I think everyone (on the team)
has had their turn (in the spot
light)," Birch said. "And I'm for
tunate enough to have my turn
this year. I'm just happy I could
be in the final."
Birch's opponent is Southern
Methodist senior Jennifer
Santrock. The No. 4 seed,
Santrock got her chance to meet
third-seeded Birch by besting Pep
perdine's Noelle Porter.
Porter had won eight sets in a
row after dropping the first one
in her upset over Tami Whit

linger. In her match today with
Santrock, no one brake serve in
the first set.
Santrock took the tiebreaker 7-3
and in so doing seemed to remind
Porter that indeed it is possible
for her to lose. The second set
was a 6-1 blowout.
"It would be nice to end the
year [with an NCAA title] and it's
nice to know I only have one col
lege match left," Santrock said.
"At times the rest of the year,
I've played better than I'm play
ing now," she said. "But I think
mentally . . .I'm tougher than
I have been all year."
Also tougher than at any time
this year is the Birch-Graham
doubles team.
Riding the strength of error
free play and the phenomenal
serving of Graham, the Stanford
tandem stormed into the finals
with two dominant wins over
teams that had beaten them ear
lier in the year.
In their quarterfinal, they beat
Porter and Ginger Helgeson 6-2,
6-2 to avenge an early-season
drowning by the Waves' tandem.
Helgeson and Porter managed
but one service break, that coming
at 4-1 in the second set.
Throughout the match, Graham
served well, but it was only a
preview of what was to come.
The semifinal pitted the Cardi
nal duo against Florida's Nicole
Arendt and Siobahn Nicholson,
who had advanced after knocking
off California's Alissa Finerman
and Lisa Albano 6-1, 4-6, 6-4.
The Lady Gators beat Birch and
Graham in a dual-match at
Gainesville in late March. The
payback they received today may
have made them wish they hadn't.
After earning a quick break of
Birch's serve to lead 1-0 in the
first set, Arendt and Nicholson
would never be on top again in
the match.
Arendt's serve was broken to
knot things at 1-1 and then

Graham stepped up to the service
line for the Cardinal.
In an awe-inspiring display,
Graham came up with two service
winners and two additional excel
lent serves. The only point for the
Lady Gators came on a double
fault.
Nicholson's serve was then bro
ken to give Birch and Graham a
3-1 lead. With Birch serving, the
two continued their superb exe
cution.

The Cardinal volleyer was con
sistently able to move to the center
of the court and pound the return
into the ground for an overhead
winner.
With the score 4-2, Graham was
again serving. One ace, two serv
ice winners. No points for the
Lady Gators.
The Cardinal closed out the set
6-3 and then broke Arendt to open
the second set. At 1-0, it was once
again Graham time.

First, a service winner. Next,
an Arendt topspin lob to get it to
15-15. Graham served a fault and
came back with a rocket on her
second one allowing Birch an easy
cross-court overhead winner.
In the next point, the same
thing happened on Graham's first
serve to move the score to 40-15.
Then another fault and a service
winner on the second serve.
