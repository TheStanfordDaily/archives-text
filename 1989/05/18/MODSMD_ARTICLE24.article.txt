# Assorted speculations as baseball awaits a call to regionals
## 
### 
Let's play the speculation game.
We shall consider whether the
Cardinal baseball team will be in
vited to an NCAA Regional next Monday.
It will.
Why, you ask? How can a team with
a 30-28 record be invited to post-season
play? Your point is well taken. Heck, if
it weren't for a great finish, Stanford
Coach Mark Marquess would've suffered
his first losing season in 13 years on the
Farm.
But the Cardinal truly deserves a
berth, amazing as that may seem. For
starters, that great finish — nine wins
in its last 10 games — is worth its weight
in gold. For a team that played spotty
baseball all year, nothing could be better
than a closing streak to convince the
selection committee Stanford belongs in
the post-season. A quick glance at those
10 games shows the Cardinal rolled over
some stiff competition.
The streak opened at home against
then-No. 2 Arizona. After Arizona rallied
to win the first game 6-5, Stanford routed
the Wildcats 11-3 and 12-5 in the next
two. That's two convincing victories over

the second-best team in the land — not
a bad way to start a hot streak. Had
relief ace Steve Chitren — who started
and won the third game — done his job
in game one, the Cardinal would have
swept the 'Cats.
Stanford's success against Arizona is
even more significant in light of its first
series against the Six-Pac champion.
Back in mid-March at Tucson, the 'Cats
thumped the Cardinal 17-3 and 13-7
before Stanford recovered to win the
third game 5-4. Now if the NCAA selec
tion committee wants to see improvement

over the course of the season, they need
look no further.
Stanford soundly thrashed a club that
totaled zero runs in two earlier meetings
between the teams. Needless to say, the
Cardinal has come quite a long way since
March.
Stanford also defeated a quality Santa
Clara team in the 10-game stretch. That
victory is significant for several reasons.
Santa Clara is one of the Cardinal's Bay
Area rivals competing for at-large spots
in the playoffs. Stanford opened its
season with back-to-back, 3-2 losses to
the Broncos.
Since then, the Cardinal has won two
straight: a 6-4 win at Santa Clara in
March and the May 9 victory that started
a season-ending, four-game winning
streak.
What's more, Santa Clara (40-22)
closed on a sour note, dropping three of
its last four to finish third in the West
Coast Athletic Conference behind Pep
perdine and Loyola Marymount. If the
choice is between Stanford and Santa
Clara, go with the Cardinal.
Stanford closed the year with two

straight wins over WCAC Champion Pep
perdine (40-16-1) in Malibu, Calif. In two
games, the Waves scored one run. This
is a team that was batting .311 entering
the series. The Cardinal won 1-0 and 2-1,
getting complete-game victories from
Brian Keyser and Stan Spencer. The
Waves were on a roll, having clinched
their league title to cap a year-end run
that included 23 wins in 25 games prior
to meeting Stanford.
If two impressive wins over that kind
of competition doesn't turn selection
committee heads, nothing will.
Earlier this week, Larry Cochell of Cal
State-Fullerton, the committee's West
Coast representative, seemed to turn his:
"Stanford has a little greater chance be
cause they are the two-time defending
champion; at the end they won nine of
10; two wins over a champion, Pepper
dine, to end their season; and they have
Mike Mussina back after he was out seven
weeks."
Now everything in there is just peachy
keen, except one thing. Doesn't it seem
a little strange that speculation on Car
dinal pitcher Mike Mussina's availability

would figure into the selection process?
Does to me. They don't hand out bids
to the NCAA basketball tournament be
cause a team might have its star player
back from an injury, do they? Nope. Don't
put Stanford in on spec, put 'em in be
cause they deserve it, which they clearly
do.
More evidence. Stanford finished alone
in fourth in the Six-Pac. The last two
seasons, the NCAA has chosen four teams
from the league. Why should this year
be any different? The league is still very
strong. Arizona and Arizona St. were just
so good, everyone else's conference record
suffered. Besides, the Cardinal also
surged in league play, taking four of its
last six and seven of its last 12 after
starting out just 5-13.
Now, for some more obscure tidbits.
After winning two straight last weekend,
Stanford Coach Mark Marquess men
tioned strength of schedule as working
in the Cardinal's favor.
Just how much is evidenced by a few
simple facts. Stanford played 58 games


ROBERT PORTNOY
this year. 31 were against teams
that appeared in last year's
regionals. Only 12 were against
teams that never appeared in the
national rankings this year. Take
a moment to digest that one.
When Stanford took the field this
season, it was playing a national
power 80 percent of the time. As
the two-time defending champion.
Think any of those quality teams
was gunning for the Cardinal?
You bet.
Let's go on. Of the 58 games,
32 times Stanford was battling a
team that at one time or another

occupied the country's top 10.
That's more than half. And Stan
ford went 6-4 against teams al
ready receiving berths in this
year's regionals, including Arizo
na, Fresno State and Pepperdine.
The Cardinal did not tear up
its non-league schedule, but it's
obvious this year's was tougher
than any before. Anything less
would not become a two-time
defending champ. You have to
take the challengers' best shots,
Stanford did, got back up and
fii.,shed strong to win the split
decision.
The pieces are all in place. All
Stanford needs is the chance it
deserves.
