# Athletes of the Week
## 
### 
With spring quarter heating up in
more ways than one, students are
taking the opportunity to work on
their tans these days. Some Stanford
students, however, have decided the
Farm isn't quite good enough for tan
ning and traveled to more exotic lo
cations such as Gainesville, Fla., and
Malibu, Calif. While there, they not
only collected tans, but they also
earned the honor of being named
Athletes of the Week.
This week's winners are the wom
en's tennis team and the baseball
team's Brian Keyser
The women netters ventured to
Gainesville in an effort to win the

school's fourth consecutive NCAA
title. Winning, however, is not a
strong enough word for what Frank
Brennan's troops did to the compe
tition as the Cardinal won 25 of 26
matches in dominating the field.
After completing the season at 29-0
to win the school's sixth title in the
past eight years, Brennan called this
year's squad the best he has ever
coached, including those five prior
national champions.
The best team ever — Sandra
Birch, Cindy Buchsbaum, Debbie
Graham, Lisa Green, Kylie Johnson,
Carina Rolley, Eleni Rossides, Tami
Whitlinger, Teri Whitlinger and
Valerie Wilson — began last Thurs
day by sweeping San Diego State 9-0.
Friday, Oklahoma State did what
no other team could do — win a
match. Monika Waniek defeated
Birch at No. 2 singles but Stanford
lost only one other set in the 5-1 win.
Georgia met the Cardinal in the
semifinals Saturday, and the Bull
dogs, like the Cowgirls, won exactly
three sets. Stanford six, Georgia zero.
Stanford then met UCLA in the
fined after the Bruins upset No. 2
Florida in the other semifinal. In the
final, UCLA's sole highlight was that
Jessica Emmons took a set from Tami
Whitlinger. All other Cardinal players
won in straight sets and the
Whitlinger Emmons match was
called off at one set all when the
Cardinal clinched the 5-0 win.

Keyser, a 6-foot-l senior from
Roseville, Calif., pitched a three-hit

shutout at Pepperdine Saturday to
move Stanford over .500 (29-28) for
the first time since the team was 9-8
Feb. 24. After teammate Stan Spen
cer threw a six-hit complete game
Sunday to beat the Waves 2-1, the
Cardinal ends the regular season 30-
28 and has a good shot at advancing
to regional play for the ninth con
secutive year.
Keyser did not allow a hit until
the sixth inning despite pitching
against a Pepperdine team that had
won 23 of its last 25 games. In the
process, Keyser threw the first
shutout of his career and won his
team-leading seventh game of the

season against only three losses.
Keyser has won his last three
starts and has not aliowed an earned
run over his last 22 innings. In his
last six outings he is 4-0 with a 2.14
ERA.
After taking two of two from the
formerly red-hot Waves, the Cardinal
ended the regular season winners of
nine of its last 10 games. Stanford
has won four of its last five weekend
series and ended the year 5-0 against
the top two teams in the West Coast
Athletic Conference: Pepperdine (2-0)
and Loyola Marymount (3-0). Re
gional hids will he announced Mon
day.
