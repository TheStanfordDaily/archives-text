# Swimming recruits cream of the crop

The Stanford men's swimming Class of' 92, touted
as the top recruiting class in the nation, merely
had amongst it first-, second- and fourth-place fin
ishers at the 1989 NCAAs, had one of its members
almost set a new American record, helped lead the
Cardinal to a national second-place finish, and had
four competitors conclude the season as Ail-
Americans.
The incoming freshmen class may be even better.
The Cardinal's top three recruits — Erik Mauer,
Chas Morton and J.J. Freitag — appear to have
even more potential than the current newcomers to
the Farm, not an easy group of athletes to outshine.
In addition to their All-American potential, the in
coming swimmers perfectly fill the few holes in the
already-strong Cardinal lineup.
"This is the best class I've ever seen since I've
been here — even better than last year. They not
only have prime talent but also have depth," co
captain John Witchel said.
The talent of the Class of '93 does not end with
the three top guns, however. Brad Budney, from
Upper Montclair N.J., is the third-ranked high school
butterflier this year. A 100 and 200 fly finalist at
the 1989 short-course nationals, he will be the Car
dinal's second fastest flier.
Local talent Jim Gardner, from Oakland's Bishop
O'Dowd High School, will add depth to Stanford's
already-talented distance freestyle corps as owner
of last season's fastest junior mile time. Southern
Californian Ron Scott brings more sprint expertise
to the team, while Cary McConolgue is a national
qualifier in the individual medley events
In addition the Cardinal is gaining two of the
nation's top diving prospects in Mark Kraus and
Brad Wightman.
"This class definitely gives us the firepower to
beat Texas next year — all it is going to be i*
making it work and putting it all together," Witchel
said.
