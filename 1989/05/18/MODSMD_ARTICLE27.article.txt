# Olympians provide competition at Pac-10s
## 
### Ed Pike Staff writer 
A question for trivia buffs —
who contributed 47 track and field
athletes to the Seoul Olympics ?
No matter what country you
picked, guess again — it was the
Pacific 10 Conference, considered
by Stanford Track and Field
Coach Brooks Johnson and many
others to be the nation's toughest.
Half a dozen returning 1988
Olympians and unknown num
bers of future stars will be
competing here this weekend at
the Pac-10 Championships at
Stanford Stadium.
The most famous will be Steve
Lewis, the 400 meter gold medal
winner from UCLA. Lewis, a mere
sophomore, represents the future
of a dynasty that has included
Florence Griffith-Joyner and
Jackie Joyner-Kersee.
Even a two-time NCAA Cham
pion team is not safe in this con
ference. With Lewis and fellow
Olympian Mike Marsh ailing from
hamstring injuries, UCLA Coach
Bob Larsen is conceding Oregon
a few points over his defending
champions.
Stanford has also had its share
of track and field Olympians with
six. This should come as no
surprise, however, as Stanford has
been represented in all but two
Olympiads dating back to 1908.

Stanford was particularly
strong in the distance events, with
1985 graduates Jeff Atkinson and
Regina Jacobs in the 1500 meters.
From the Class of 1984 were Patti
Sue Plummer in the 3,000 meters
and Carol Cady in the discus.
Atkinson, Cady and Plummer
all reached the finals in their
respective events, joining many
other Pac-10 athletes as the best
among U.S. athletes.
It may pay to watch some
promising athletes in the back of
the pack as well as the winners
this weekend. "If you ask how
many are willing to do what it
takes to go to the Olympics, it
eliminates 95 or 97 percent of the
contenders," Johnson said.
"Jeff Atkinson never won the
Pac-lOs," according to Johnson.
"He was fourth at Pac-lOs, fourth
at NCAAs and fourth at the TAC
Championships."
This has also bolstered
Johnson's belief that Stanford
competes in the toughest confer
ence in the country. "The Pac-10,
the Southwest and the Southeast
are the top three, and probably
in that order," Johnson said.
One could also look to the fact
that 25 collegiate or NCAA meet
records were set by Pac-10 ath
letes, or the fact that the Pac-10
has claimed 43 National Champi
onships (the second-place Big
Eight could catch-up by the year

2023).
Johnson sees several main fac
tors contributing to the number
of strong athletes. Weather and
good facilities are one advantage,
allowing year-round training.
Good recruiting follows good sea
sons — prep stars look for suc
cessful programs and thus success
breeds success.
According to Cady, the winners
at this weekend's meet will be
those who are the best "competi
tors." Being a good competitor is
"performing at your best when it
is most required," Cady said. "It's
doing something unexpected."
Last year, it was Stanford's
Carol Gray running the 10,000
meters for the first time of the
season. Gray not only won the
race but set a new meet record
of 33:41.8, as well as qualifying
for the U.S. Olympic Trials.
Add it up, and you have the
setting for serious competition
this weekend. In this conference,
there is no such thing as an easy
win.
