# Protesters face Fundamental Standard investigation
## 
### Nathanael Cousins Staff writer 
As business returned to normal in
the Office of the President, University
officials confirmed that a Fundamental
Standard investigation had been
launched immediately concerning stu
dents who participated in Monday's
protest.
Judicial Affairs Officer Sally Cole is
collecting information about the occu
pation of Kennedy's office, investigat
ing possible violations of the "campus
disruption" code in the Fundamental
Standard.
"The students will be charged by
the University; (they will be) found to
have violated the Fundamental Stand
ard and penalties will be enforced,"
predicted Vice President and General

Counsel John Schwartz.
"I will first proceed to decide who
to charge with what," Cole said. She
would not predict when the investiga
tion would be completed.
Kennedy called the occupation "un
lawful" in an official statement issued
Monday.
In the aftermath of Monday's occu
pation, things are back in order at
Kennedy's office. "Things were a
mess," said Mandy MacCalla, a recep
tionist in the office. "But our effects
were not disturbed."
MacCalla, who was one of the em
ployees ordered out of the building
Monday, said no damage was done by
the protesting students, although some
screws were taken out of a door by
law enforcement officials when they
removed the students.

The Policy on Campus Disruption,
which is applied under the Fundamen
tal Standard, explicitly states that any
disruption of University business is a
violation of University policy, Cole
said.
Cole said that of the 55 protesters
arrested, two were alumni and one
was not a Stanford student, so they
are excluded from the investigation.
Schwartz estimated that between 60
and 70 students might be investigated.
"The University does its own inves
tigation outside of law enforcement
reports," stressed Schwartz. "We are
going to look at the facts," he said.
In addition to possible Standard vi
olations, students who were arrested
may still be tried under California
criminal law.
Historically, penalties for violation

of the campus disruption policy have
ranged from presidential reprimand to
financial penalty, suspension and even
one expulsion, Cole said.
The policy was written in 1967 dur
ing the turbulent era of Vietnam
protest and has been applied to several
cases similar to Monday's occupation.
In the 19705, students occupied the
Faculty Club, Computations Center
and the Career Planning and Place
ment Center in separate incidents.
Students who disrupted a speech by
Ambassador Henry Cabot Lodge in
1971 received suspensions of one to
four quarters. In another case, stu
dents who disrupted a Board of Trus
tees luncheon at the Faculty Club in
1969 were docked with a one-year
suspension and $50 fines.
