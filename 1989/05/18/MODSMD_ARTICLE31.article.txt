Better than Bon Jovi
Stand by, ladies and gentlemen, because Amenca's No.
1 star is coming to the Circle Star Center in San Carlos
June 14. Nope, it's not Jon Bon Jovi. Not Eddie Murphy.
Not even Uma Thurman. We are very pleased to announce
that this special appearance will be made by none other
than Amenca's own Lt. Colonel Oliver North. Yea!!
This part-time Amencan hero and convicted felon will
be delivenng a prepared talk concentrating on the following
topics:
• Committment, Trust and Family
• Amenca's Social Values
• Conservative Issues
• Manuel Nonega — Your Buddy and Mine
After his approximately 45-minute speech, North will
participate in an open forum of questions and answers
with the audience.
According to North's biography, provided by the Wash
ington Speakers Bureau, Inc., North "has provoked great
controversy while gaming the respect of the vast majonty
of freedom-loving Amencans" (snicker). He also "was in
volved in planning the liberation of Grenada from the
Marxist tyranny" and left an endunng legacy because of
"the indispensible role he played in carrying out the Pres
ident's orders to support freedom and democracy in Central
Amenca.
Tickets for Oliver North in Concert are $17.50 and are
available at all BASS ticketmaster outlets.
