# Soviets discover sex

### Chris Barbour 
The release of the Soviet film
"Little Vera" was supposed to be
the dawn of a new glasnost-era
openness in Communist bloc
movie making. The advance
reviews made it out to be nothing
less than a "realistic" pornographic
look at Russian life — a sort of
"Raisa Does Dallas."
"Little Vera" star Natalya
Negoda didn't help dissuade people
of this notion when she posed for
a well-publicized nude spread in
Playboy Magazine — her and Hef
getting together to point out that
Soviet women aren't all the fat,
working-class toilers we make
them out to be
As it turns out, "Little Vera" is,
sexually speaking, fairly tame by
American standards; it's the fact
that Russians were doin' it at all
that got people all excited.
Nope, "Little Vera" is not the
Soviet sex flick that all the Amer
ican publicity has made it out to
be. Quite to the contrary, the film
is actually a grim tale of ordinary
life in an industrial town some
where in the Soviet Union, where
everyday crawls by with exactly the
same amount of agonizing
boredom and discontent. A place
where sex can bring only the
slightest bit of relief.
Vera, played by Natalya Negoda,
is a teenager not about to conform
to the lifestyle or values of her
parents or older brother. She has
no dreams for her future, but as
she sees it, anything would be bet
ter than what she'd have following
her parents' rules.
Though she's just out of school
and preparing to get a )ob with the
telephone company, she spends
most of her time dressed in her

one cool outfit, hanging out with
her girlfriends, just waiting around
for something to happen.
Something happens when she
meets a handsome young student
named Sergei after a riot at a public
dance. They end up falling into
bed and then falling in love.
At first, Vera's parents and Ser
gei politely hate each other, but
this mutual animosity soon esc
alates into an altercation between
Vera's father and Sergei which ul
timately threatens to destroy the
entire family.
I here is an appropriate amount
of rawness in the look of "Little
Vera," which, unfortunately, can
be only inadvertently attributed to
the direction of 28-year-old Vasily
Pichul. Pichul doesn't exactly have
the luxury of working in a
capitalist town like Hollywood
where he could have about $30

million to work with in order to
give his film that polished look.
However, along with lacking
capital, Pichul also lacks a consid
erable amount of directorial
imagination. He has no problem
with his actors, just his cameras.
There are often moments when
you would wish he'd just move
the camera around a bit, or cut to
a different angle. There are too
many times when there is a sense
that nothing is happening simply
because the scene itself is so stag
nant.
Yet, where the direction may fail
a bit, the screenplay by Pichul's
wife Maryia Khmelik and the per
formance of Natalya Negoda help
to make the film an overall suc
cess.
The brutally graphic detail with
which Khmelik portrays the hope
lessness and despair of Vera's life
is remarkable. Khmelik under
stands her subjects quite well, and
never stoops to simplify or explain
away the complexities and con
tradictions of her characters. The
world she depicts is ugly and often
cruel, and Khmelik realizes that it
would be wrong to try to somehow
make it more appealing.
Perhaps the only appealing
aspect to this horribly gray world
is Natalya Negoda's Vera. Negoda
gives Vera a wry, comic twist,
which allows her some protection
from her nearly unbearable cir
cumstances. Negoda definitely
possesses an intense sex appeal,
but to fixate on that, as the Amer
ican press has done, misses the
more important subtleties of her
performance. Negoda makes it pos
sible for us to care deeply about a
hopeless character

"Little Vera" starts Friday at the
Aquarius Theater in Palo Alto.
