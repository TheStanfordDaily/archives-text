# To boldly go where no man has gone before: shopping
## 
### 
I recently had occasion to return to the
wonderful world of clothes shopping. 1 say
"return" because I have been the same
height since 10th grade, and consequently
never saw any need to puchasc new cloth
ing, never nund the fact that the stuff I
was wearing had expired about two years
ago.
Luckily, this all changed when iny
girlfriend offered to take me shopping last
month. It had been quite some time since
I ventured into a store alone — I have
had a serious phobia about entering de
partment stores ever since 1 was attacked
by a gang of slacks as a child — so she
promised to hold my hand if I got scared
Also, she promised that we would do
the kind of shopping where one actually
purchases items, ratner than the type of
shopping popular with teenage girls in
which you visit a mall the size of Idaho
and put 700 different items on layaway.
Now at this point you are probably
thinking that this will be another one of
those columns where I make up imaginary
differences between men and women, but
I should point out that it is a scientifically
proven fact that women are genetically
superior shopping creatures:
New York (API — Scientists at the Na

tional Institutes of Health today success
fully isolated the elusive female shopping
gene from human patients and injected
it into laboratory rats.
A spokesman for the scientists said that
there appeared to he "no change" in the
rats' health, and he indicated that more
comprehensive tests would he completed
as soon as the rats returned from
Nordstrom.
We decided to shop at Macy's because
I still had a $500 gift certificate that I got
as a high school graduation present. It
seemed like as good a place as any to shop.
[You men are going to have to bear
with me as we pause for a moment. I'm
sure you didn't have any problem reading
the last paragraph, but I guarantee you
that every woman reading this column
just looked up from the page and screamed
"FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS!!" And they
say there's no difference between the
sexes. ..]
So we entered Macy's one Saturday
morning and immediately I began to feel
weak-kneed and faint. Tnis is all part of
Macy's plot. They put the perfume counter
right by the entrance to the store and hire
ladies to squirt vou with stuff called "Eau
dc Toilet" (English translation: "Oh, you

smell like a toilet"), which temporarily
paralyzes the pan of your brain that allows
restraint in making purchases. It's very
similar to the restraining bolt that Luke
Skywalker removed from R2D2 on the
planet Tatooinc. Come to think of it, I'm
kind of built like R2D2.
Eventually we reached the clothing pan
of the store, and I was immediately ac
costed by one of those pnstinely dressed,
commission-hungry sales clerks. You
know the type: hair perfectly slicked back,
dressed impeccably in a three-piece suit,
IQ of 18.
These sales clerks can't possibly be
human beings — nobody, not even Morton
Downey, Jr. — could be that annoying. I
think they're actually robots manufactured
by the Japanese.
"Ha ha ha," say the Japanese, "these
sales clerk-robots will take over the world "
Airline flight attendants are also manufac
tured by the Japanese
The sales clerk-robot spoke, the odors
of hairspray and mouthwash mixing with
what smclled like motor oil. "What can
I do for you folks?" he asked
"We're looking for clothes," I said.
"Error. Error. Tokyo 91435-3843A6.
WOOOOP! WOOOOOP! Would you like
the steak or chicken on today's flight?

OVERLOAD'!"
Just as I suspccted.
It turns out that since I last went shop
ping, "clothes" have officially disappeared
from stores. I discovered this quite by
accident when I informed a real human
sales clerk that I was looking to buy some
clothes, and he gave me a look that in
dicated I might just as well have asked
where I could purchase ground lizard parts.
Clothes, it turns out, has been myster
iously replaced by "apparel," except in ex
pensive stores where it is "attire." Cheap

things arc now "garments," and pants with
15 or 20 pockets, especially in ridiculous
places like the thighs, are "gear."
Anything that isn't part of the four basic
clothing groups — the shirt group, the
pants group, the underwear groun and the
meats/poultry group — is an "accessory."
James Bond is always being given cool
accessories by "Q" in his movies, but I
wouldn't consider ties and belts to be cool
accessories. Unless they shoot poison
darts.
Finally we managed to find the "Men's
apparel" section, and my girlfriend went
to work picking out clothes in my size —
I think the word "short" describes my size
the best, although you could also use the
word "rhombus."
The only rule 1 made regarding the
choice of clothes was that under no cir
cumstances was she to seek my opinion
on whether anything looked "good."
This was because on previous solo shop
ping excursions I had returned with many
unspeakable items, the crowning glory
being the horizontal-striped, bell-bottom
pants, which lasted only a month before
being destroyed in a mercy killing one
evening by the rest of the clothes in my
closet.
