# Fabulous sets boost 'Changeling'

### Mia Manzulli Senior staff writer 
Hmm ... a potion labled "M" that determines a
maiden's virginity is a clever tool. Slip an unsuspect
ing lass some liquid and wait for the results.
Does her mouth gape open? Does she sneeze three
times in succession? Does she lapse into a veritable
fit of laughter? Yes, and she's pure. No, and she's
trouble. . ..
In the Drama Department's production of "The
Changeling," a Jacobean tale of passion, intrigue and
murder, the beautiful Joanna must face the test of
the potion "M" or forfeit her marriage to the dashing
Alsemero.
You see, Joanna was once engaged to Alonzo de
Piracquo, but when she falls in love with Alsemero
she arranges Alonzo's murder. Her father's servant
DeFlores (who lusts obsessively after Joanna) eagerly
kills Alonzo in return for her virginity.
Now the deflowered Joanna must live in fear that
her new husband will discover that she's no longer
a virgin. "The Changeling" explores the danger of
immoral acts that inevitably lead to further duplicity.
Director Humphrey Gyde, a Ph.D. candidate in
the Drama Department, chose "The Changeling" for
his final thesis production. A lover of Shakespeare
and the Jacobean period, Gyde wanted to do "The
Changeling" because this type of play is rarely done
here at Stanford. Gyde said that there are no gimmicks
needed for a play like this one — "The Changeling"
stands by itself.
Written by Thomas Middleton, one of the greatest
comic dramatists of the Jacobean period, "The
Changeling" marks the playwright's departure into
drama.
The comic roots, however, have not been lost, for
"The Changeling" is a tragedy of misunderstanding.
Although the resulting confusion is fatal, the under
tones are often very comical.
"The Changeling" was written in collaboration with
the playwright William Rowley who was responsible
for the comic sub-plot. The Drama Department chose
to cut the Rowley sub-plot, however, to highlight
instead the contours of the main action.
Despite the humor underlying the action and
suspense of the play, "The Changeling" poses many
fundamental questions: whether character is what
we think of ourselves internally, or merely the sum
of our actions as others perceive them; and whether
our passions or reason govern our motives and be
havior.
Middleton seeks to draw the audience in by dis
secting his characters' motives and making the char
acters justify their actions. Each of the characters
steps out of the scenes and talks directly to the
audience in soliloquy, using these opportunities to
woo the audience to his or her point of view. Mid
dleton wants the audience to feel torn between the

characters and their goals, thus rendering simple
moral judgements problematic.
One of the problems in directing a play as complex
as "The Changeling" arises from the difficult language
in which is written. Because the play is in 17th
century verse, director Gyde spent long hours with
his cast getting them to understand the language
before they began to act it.
"The language is wordy," said Gyde. "Yet it creates
very powerful images. I wanted to express the beauty
of the language while getting across tne real character
emotions. We had to strike a balance between realsitic
conversations and a respect for the rhetoric."
"There is a great deal of passion driving the action
of the play," said Gyde and he realized that the
unfamiliar idiom might make it difficult to capture.
But with all of his painstaking preparation, "The
Changeling" maintains the intended passion and en
ergy.
The staging of the production is set deep within
the bowels of a castle that reflects the tortured mac
hinations and plotting of those trapped within it.
The wonderfully elaborate sets were created by the
award-winning designer John Wilson, a professor in
the Drama Department.
Wilson was also responsible for the very authentic
looking 17th-century costumes. Since Wilson de
signed both, the overall look of "The Changeling" is
very well coordinated. ,
Gyde has also assembled a fine cast to play the
wicked, lustful, loving and intriguing characters of
Middleton's tale. Sophomore Kristi Pado does a good
job as the manipulative yet vulnerable Joanna and
senior David Kurtz is convincing as the lustful and
slimy servant DeFlores.
The dashing Alsemero is played by law student
Steve Bend, who is appealing as the suitor-turned
husband of Joanna. Alsemero's sidekick Jasperino
(sophomore Matt Eldridge) provides clever comic
relief, particularly when flirting with Diaphanta
(junior Ellen Waggoner), Joanna's flirtatious waiting
woman.
Following Friday night's performance, Professor
David Riggs of the English Department will lead a
discussion of "The Changeling" with Humphrey
Gyde. Riggs, a specialist in Jacobean drama, will
place the play in its historical context. Gyde believes
that this type of discussion will be of interest to
members the community who want to learn more
about Middleton's period.

May 20, and May 24-27 in the Little Theater at

The debonair suitor Alsemero (Steve Bend) puts a bear hug on his suitee Joanna (Kristi Pado) in a scene
from the Department of Drama's presentation of 'The Changeling."
Hmm ... a potion labled "M" that determines a
maiden's virginity is a clever tool. Slip an unsuspect
ing lass some liquid and wait for the results.
Does her mouth gape open? Does she sneeze three
times in succession? Does she lapse into a veritable
fit of laughter? Yes, and she's pure. No, and she's
trouble. . ..
In the Drama Department's production of "The
Changeling," a Jacobean tale of passion, intrigue and
murder, the beautiful Joanna must face the test of
the potion "M" or forfeit her marriage to the dashing
Alsemero.
You see, Joanna was once engaged to Alonzo de
Piracquo, but when she falls in love with Alsemero
she arranges Alonzo's murder. Her father's servant
DeFlores (who lusts obsessively after Joanna) eagerly
kills Alonzo in return for her virginity.
Now the deflowered Joanna must live in fear that
her new husband will discover that she's no longer
a virgin. "The Changeling" explores the danger of
immoral acts that inevitably lead to further duplicity.
Director Humphrey Gyde, a Ph.D. candidate in
the Drama Department, chose "The Changeling" for
his final thesis production. A lover of Shakespeare
and the Jacobean period, Gyde wanted to do "The
Changeling" because this type of play is rarely done
here at Stanford. Gyde said that there are no gimmicks
needed for a play like this one — "The Changeling"
stands by itself.
Written by Thomas Middleton, one of the greatest
comic dramatists of the Jacobean period, "The
Changeling" marks the playwright's departure into
drama.
The comic roots, however, have not been lost, for
"The Changeling" is a tragedy of misunderstanding.
Although the resulting confusion is fatal, the under
tones are often very comical.
"The Changeling" was written in collaboration with
the playwright William Rowley who was responsible
for the comic sub-plot. The Drama Department chose
to cut the Rowley sub-plot, however, to highlight
instead the contours of the main action.
Despite the humor underlying the action and
suspense of the play, "The Changeling" poses many
fundamental questions: whether character is what
we think of ourselves internally, or merely the sum
of our actions as others perceive them; and whether
our passions or reason govern our motives and be
havior.
Middleton seeks to draw the audience in by dis
secting his characters' motives and making the char
acters justify their actions. Each of the characters
steps out of the scenes and talks directly to the
audience in soliloquy, using these opportunities to
woo the audience to his or her point of view. Mid
dleton wants the audience to feel torn between the

characters and their goals, thus rendering simple
moral judgements problematic.
One of the problems in directing a play as complex
as "The Changeling" arises from the difficult language
in which is written. Because the play is in 17th
century verse, director Gyde spent long hours with
his cast getting them to understand the language
before they began to act it.
"The language is wordy," said Gyde. "Yet it creates
very powerful images. I wanted to express the beauty
of the language while getting across tne real character
emotions. We had to strike a balance between realsitic
conversations and a respect for the rhetoric."
"There is a great deal of passion driving the action
of the play," said Gyde and he realized that the
unfamiliar idiom might make it difficult to capture.
But with all of his painstaking preparation, "The
Changeling" maintains the intended passion and en
ergy.
The staging of the production is set deep within
the bowels of a castle that reflects the tortured mac
hinations and plotting of those trapped within it.
The wonderfully elaborate sets were created by the
award-winning designer John Wilson, a professor in
the Drama Department.
Wilson was also responsible for the very authentic
looking 17th-century costumes. Since Wilson de
signed both, the overall look of "The Changeling" is
very well coordinated. ,
Gyde has also assembled a fine cast to play the
wicked, lustful, loving and intriguing characters of
Middleton's tale. Sophomore Kristi Pado does a good
job as the manipulative yet vulnerable Joanna and
senior David Kurtz is convincing as the lustful and
slimy servant DeFlores.
The dashing Alsemero is played by law student
Steve Bend, who is appealing as the suitor-turned
husband of Joanna. Alsemero's sidekick Jasperino
(sophomore Matt Eldridge) provides clever comic
relief, particularly when flirting with Diaphanta
(junior Ellen Waggoner), Joanna's flirtatious waiting
woman.
Following Friday night's performance, Professor
David Riggs of the English Department will lead a
discussion of "The Changeling" with Humphrey
Gyde. Riggs, a specialist in Jacobean drama, will
place the play in its historical context. Gyde believes
that this type of discussion will be of interest to
members the community who want to learn more
