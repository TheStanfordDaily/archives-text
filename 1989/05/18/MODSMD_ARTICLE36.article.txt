# Led Zeppelin rip-off Kingdom Come find new sounds to clone
## 
### Bill Fagelson Staff writer 
The members of Kingdom
Come, smarting fron} all of the
criticism they received for their
first album, wanted to issue a reply
to their detractors. "In Your Face"
is the result of these paranoid delu
sions. Apparently, they think a stu
pid title like that will evoke some
kind of respect from all of us who
hated the first album.
Kingdom Come entered the
music scene about a year ago with
"Get It On," a single that sounded
enough like a poor ripoff of Led
Zeppelin's "Kashmir" to earn them
the nickname "Kingdom Clone"
and 1.3 million in record sales.

To top that off, they were seen
by 1.5 million people during eight
months of touring. You have to
take into consideration, however,
that 40 of these dates were on the
Monsters of Rock tour. Many of
the people that saw them were not
exactly willing participants.
As a testament to this fact, the
sleeve has a picture of the band
waving to the Monsters crowd in
New Jersey. I was a member of
that audience, and as I remember
it, almost all of us were telling
them to get off die stage so that
we could get Dokken onstage and
tell them to get off.
"In Your Face" is their second
album, and before listening, I
couldn't imagine it being worse
than the first. I can now that I've

heard it. In an attempt to separate
themselves from the Led Zeppelin
clone image they created with "Get
It On," Kingdom Come starts the
album with "Do You Like It."
Now aside from the ddja vu I
feel hearing this line (from "Misty
Mountain Hop"), the song is lit
tered with inane phrases like "the
blazing heart of rock and roll." It
is probably the feeblest attempt I've
ever heara to create a rock anthem.
The rest of the songs are of about
the same caliber. "The Wind" is
perhaps the most interesting. It's
a ripoff of Whitesnake ripping off
Led Zeppelin. I suppose I should
be thankful that they've acknowl
edged their roots. "Gotta Go (Can't
Wage A War)" pretty much speaks
for itself. I guess on this one they're

supposed to be socially conscious.
The songs on this album don't
deserve the attention I'm forced to
give them. They are filled with just
about every overused rock and roll
cliche you can imagine. Lenny
Wolfe is trying his darnedest to
sing without letting out his Ger
man accent, but he just can't hide
it. It really can't be that hard; the
Scorpions do it. I think the band
has very little sense of what a joke
they are.
I've thought at great length about
the musical question Kingdom
Come asks with "Do You Like It."
My answer is (as I'm sure is ob
vious by now), no. They're much
better off stealing somebody else's
stuff.


Kingdom Come opted for the stereo effect on the cover of their latest album, "In Your Face." Frankly, the cover of Prince's "LovesexV^album
showed off a nicer woofer and cuter tweeters than this one.
