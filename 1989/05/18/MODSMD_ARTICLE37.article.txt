# New direction for John Mellen Cougarcamp
## 
### Bill Fagelson Staff writer 
Since "American Fool/' John
Cougar Mellencamp has proven
with each successive release that
he can play all forms of rock and
roll. He has gone from pop rocker
to musician in the course of several
albums.
His latest, "Big Daddy," is not
his best album, but he has shown
in the past that he can perfect a
new style in the course of a few
albums and move on. "Big Daddy"
is a good album on its own, and
even better as a starting point for
a musician who promises even bet
ter in the future.
Mellencamp has held on to the
accordion and violin from"The
Lonesome Jubilee," and even added
an oboe on one song. This album
is definitely the rawest music that
he has produced to date. The
music is much more acoustically
oriented than earlier albums. The
electric guitars play in the back
ground, while the fiddle, accordion,
acoustic guitars and Kenny
Aranoff's steady beat are the center
of the listener's attention.
The album seems to be about
the elusiveness of dreams. More
specifically, Mellencamp makes
the point that dreams are either
difficult to attain or not necessarily
what we expect once they have
been reached.
"Big Daddy of Them All" opens
the album with just that theme.
Mellencamp pities a man whose
dream has precluded his kindness:
"Bet you had no idea what your
dream would turn out to be." The
song paints a tragic picture of what
dreams can cost you.
A good example, "Jackie Brown,"
(the song with the oboe) addresses
the failure of the American dream.

Mellencamp asks, "Who gives a
damn about Jackie Brown / Just
another lazy man who couldn't
take what was his.." It's not just
the lyrics that are compelling.
Acoustic guitars, a violin and even
the oboe create an equally
melancholic background.
Other songs follow along these
same lines. In "Void in My Heart,"
"To Live" and "Mansions in Heav
en," Mellencamp sings about his
inability to find contentedness. He
isn't really lamenting his
shortcomings, but coming to terms
with them: "I have accomplish
ments / But I dream of more."
Mellencamp does, however, ap
proach other subjects. In "Country
Gentleman" he puts down politi
cians. In "J.M.'s Question" he
asks, "What kind of world do we
live in?" and points out that in
today's world you've "got to do it
to your buddy before he does it to
you." These aren't necessarily op
timistic positions, but at least he
is spreading his dissatisfaction
around.
"Theo and Weird Henry,"
"Sometimes a Great Notion,"
"Martha Say" and an unnamed
song (put at the end) round out
the album. The least pointed
pieces on the album, they are just
a few more looks at Mellencamp's
smalltown world. They keep the
album from being a complete
downer, especially the unnamed
song. In it, he repeatedly advises
us to "let it all hang out."
That's a pretty good sentiment
to end the album on. Mellencamp
does let it all hang out on "Big
Daddy," making yet another artis
tic leap. A few years ago he wrote
some good solid rock and roll. Now
he's writing smart lyrics with
smart music to match. And this
guy is on the same label as
Kingdom Come?
