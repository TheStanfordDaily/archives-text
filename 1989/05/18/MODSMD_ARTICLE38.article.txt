# The
						Cure's Robert Smith Finally discovers a cure

Marriage makes men mel
lower, but Robert Smith can still
pen a poignant line about love
and life.
The 30-year-old lead singer
of The Cure finally tied the knot
with his long-time girlfriend
Mary sometime last year. Then,
he released his latest brainchild,
"Disintegration," the band's
10th and possibly most intrigu
ing album. As the title and
many of the songs hint, this
could be The Cure's last album,
a fitting finale to a long, inno
vative career.
Smith has experienced exis
tential tendencies ever since he
read Albert Camus' "The
Stranger," which inspired the
song "Killing an Arab." This al
bum's existential qualities grow
more stark, as Smith weaves
imagery about death and "dis
integration" on nearly every
song.
But this album is different
than any in the past. Smith has
come to some sort of realiza
tion, much like the one that
occurred to him in real life, that
the continual struggle for mean
ing is the meaning of life. He
has decided to put his life on
hold no longer while he waits
for the answer; life must go on
without it.
The song "Closedown" traces
the realization: "I'm running
out of time I'm out of step and
closing down and never sleep
for wanting hours the empty

hours of greed and uselessly al
ways the need to feel again the
real belief of something more
than mockery if only I could
fill my heart with love."
He accepts the greatest
manifestation of that love in the
uncharacteristic "Lovesong,"
possibly the most simplistically
beautiful Cure song ever. The
lyrics get no more complex than
"Whenever I'm alone with you,
you make me feel whole again."
Contrast that with "Lullaby,"
a more characteristic song
where Smith faces his own
death to the figure of a spider
man, when he finally under
stands the hopelessness of his
fate. "There is nothing I can do
when I realize with fright that
the spiderman is having me for
dinner tonight!"
The title track explores and
deplores the base nature of
sexual desire in Smith's most
expressive statement yet on a
favorite subject. Smith's most
honest moment comes in the
second verse: "Oh I miss the
kiss of treachery the aching kiss
before I feed the stench of a
love for a younger meat."
He ends the song with a line
that seems to resolve the di
lemma inherent in feeding that
love, as well as explaining the
conclusion to his endless quest:
"Happiness murmured in
dreams when we both of us
know how the end always is."
Robert Smith has searched 10
years for the answer; he has
discovered that there is none.
And he seems happier for it.
