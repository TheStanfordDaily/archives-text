I saw Husker Dii in Seattle a
few years ago during their "Candy
Apple Grey" toiir. As the show
progressed, the slam-dancers near
the stage became increasingly
frenzied. At one point, a concert
goer riished the stage for a
customary dive into the swirling
pit of bodies below.
Guitarist Bob Moiild, not both
ering to wait for the security
guards, took the liberty of calmly
hurling the youth off the platform.
Moiild walked back to the micro
phone and reminded the aiidience
not to climb onto the stage, telling
them "You don't want to get in
volved." It was clear that he was
a serious individual.

Husker Dii, with song writers
Grant Hart and Moiild, was one
of the quality rock and roll bands
to come out of the early '80s Min
neapolis underground scene. Al
though Husker Dii recently
disbanded, Moiild has just released
a solo albiim called "Workbook."
"Workbook" was recorded with
drummer Anton Fier (from The
Golden Palaminos), bassist Tony
Maimone (from Pere Übii) and cel
list Jane Scarpantoni (from Tiny
Lights). The inclusion of the cello
should be the first clue that
"Workbook" is not a hardcore
album. Still, this toned-down ap
proach to music should come as
no surprise after Mould's final con
tributions to Hiisker Dii (consider
his songs "Hardly Getting Over It"

and "No Reservations").
Following Husker Dii's dissolu
tion, Moiild himself foresees the
inevitable comparisons between
his new music and his old music.
In a time when the words "em
barking on a solo career" are ap
plied by critics with laughable
predictability to people in Mould's
situation, Moiild understandably
wants to avoid being defined in
terms of his old band.
Of course, it is impossible for
Moiild to totally escape his past.
In the song "Poison Years," Moiild
seems to be addressing former
band-mate Grant Hart, stating
"You don't see eye to eye with
anyone ... I don't remember you
no more." This is problematic,
since the narrator obviously does

remember the "yoii" in the song
and seems to be dwelling on the
very past from which he is trying
to break.
Other songs on "Workbook" deal
with serious subjects and usually
have a first person narrator reflect
ing on his past. The narrator of
the song "Sinners and Their
Repentances" trivializes his own
past, stating: "All those things I've
done before. It doesn't matter any
more."
On "See A Little Light," Moiild
deals with not looking forward to
something but with the feeling of
loss often accompanied by
retrospection.
The often self-absorbed lyrics on
"Workbook" lead to problems. In
some songs, the language can be

friistratingly abstract. For example,
in "Poison Years," Moiild sings,
"Leaves are changing seasons of
my poison years." Obviously he is
writing about the passage of time,
biit the grammar is muddled and
the meaning of the lyrics is
unclear. We know the narrator
wants to break with his past, biit
we don't know why.
Although some of the lyrics are
not clearly expressed, they do not
distract the listener from enjoying
the miisic. The miisic, above all,
is entertainment, and Moiild
understands this. Some of the
songs near the end of the albiim
seen to be played with forced emo
tion and tend to drag a bit. Biit,
songs like "Wishing Well" and "See

A Little Light" are quite good and
should keep feet tapping for a
while.
Despite Mould's often unclear
lyrics, the making of "Workbook"
was clearly a painful emotional ex
perience. Much work must have
been necessary to create such a
well-produced, listenable albiim.
When I saw Husker Dii in
Seattle, Moiild did not "want to
get involved" with the frivolous
slam-dancers. The music that the
dancers were enjoying was not a
result of frivolity. The show was
entertaining because it was a result
of a commitment to the music
itself. The serious effort Moiild has
exerted in the making of
"Workbook" should amount to
pleasure for a wider audience.
