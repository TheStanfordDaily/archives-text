# Stanford to require strong anti-apartheid stance from companies
## 
### Brad Hayward Senior staff writer 
A special committee of the Board of
Trustees has approved a more stringent
set of guidelines for evaluating companies
doing business in South Africa.
The Special Committee on Investment
Responsibility (SCIR) voted by phone
Monday to support the new list of stand
ards drawn up by the University's Com
mission on Investment Responsibility
(CIR), an advisory group made up of
faculty, students and alumni.

The new "Standards for Corporate Be
havior" are the latest in a series of efforts
by the two committees designed to bring
increasing pressure on the South African
government by means of the University's
investment decisions.
The newly approved criteria differ in
two key ways from previous corporate
social responsibility measures used by the
University.
First, the new standards require that
companies the University holds stock in
take "an increasing public stance against
apartheid." Second, the standards man

date specific actions for companies to
follow, whereas previous guidelines have
allowed companies to choose from a va
riety of actions.
Mandatory corporate activities out
lined by the Standards include:
• Discontinuing sales used "to support,
promote or enforce apartheid";
• Taking public actions against apart
heid and pressuring public officials to do
the same;
• Offering legal assistance to South
African employees under political arrest

and financial support for their families;
and,
• Acting with other companies and in
stitutions to bring an end to apartheid.
The new criteria also outline a series
of recommended activities, including ex
ploring the possibility of funding a pro
fessional institute for black South
Africans.
According to Barbara Benjamin-
Trevino, assistant director of University
relations, the SCiR approved the new
CIR guidelines with one small caveat.

The CIR proposal would set a time
limit for companies to provide evidence
of positive activities in South Africa and
would penalize those unable to do so.
The SCIR decision, however, gives com
panies an experimental time period to
prove that their activities are in line with
the guidelines.
In other action Monday, the SCIR voted
to approve a shareholder resolution re
questing General Motors to ensure that
its products are not sold to the South
African military or police.
