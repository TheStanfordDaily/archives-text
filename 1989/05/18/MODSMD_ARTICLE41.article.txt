# Tom Petty the same after breaking with the Heartbreakers
## 
### Matthew Marx Staff writer 
It really wasn't my fault. Just
walking through White Plaza on
my way back from higher educa
tion I was minding my own busi
ness, only to be accosted by a
ravenous Daily editor who shall
remain anomymous [Gene
Anaya).
"Hey, Matt!" he said, "How're
ya doing? And by the way, WHEN
ARE YOU GOING TO WRITE
SOMETHING FOR US, DAM
MIT?!?"
Taken aback by Gene's unusual
display of graciousness, I leveled
him with a few choice words about
Intermission's Madonna issue —
"Bleeeech!" comes to mind — and
searched for an answer.
"Well, you know, I've got some
thing: 'Full Moon Fever,' the new
album by Tom Petty."
"Tom Petty?" shot back Gene.
"Isn't he dead yet?"
"Sorry, Gene, that's Roy Orbison
you're thinking of. You're getting
your no-longer-traveling Wilburys
mixed up."
"Oh, sure . . . Well I guess that
leads us to the standard question:
Is it better or worse than Van
Halen? If it's better than Van
Halen then everyone should buy
it."
"And what if it's not as good as
Van Halen, Gene?"
"Buy more Van Halen."
By then I had been thoroughly
underwhelmed by my superior's
mental faculties, and so I contin
ued on toward my paradisical Lag
single-turned-freshman-double to

start writing the review . . . then
it occured to me that "Full Moon
Fever" doesn't sound anything like
Van Halen.
Sorry, Gene. This is truly a horse
(okay, record) of a different color.
You might have noticed a reference
to Tom Petty and not the
Heartbreakers; sure enough, the
Heartbreakers are no more, only
to be found in the discarded
volumes of Western Culture
textbooks.

And although Tom Petty's name
appears along on the cover, in truth
there's a cornucopia (I'm using
that word as revenge on a partic
ularly loquacious Pro-Fro) of other
musicians. Perhaps it should be
Tom Petty and the Traveling Wil
burys (minus Bob Dylan) and Most
Anyone Tom Picked Up on the
Long Road of Life and Whatnot.
Jeff Lynne of ELO co-wrote half
the album, George Harrison plays
some guitar, and even Roy provides
posthumous backing vocals. The
"Most Anyone. . ." consists of a
lot of no-name musicians whom

I suspect were the former
Heartbreakers, but 1 don't feel like
chasing down an old album to find
out (besides, I'm not paid much
for this).
So there you have it (them). And
I say, Tom Petty must know it's
spring quarter at Stanford, because
"Full Moon Fever" is perfect relax
ing music for the times you write
gloating letters to friends at Arctic
colleges like Amherst and the Uni
versity of Chicago.
The album's best tracks come
back to back on the first side:
"Won't Back Down" is all over the
radio, and for good reason — it
has a casual atmosphere punctu
ated by a thrilling chorus you just
can't help humming during mid
term review (warning: this may
lead to solo midterm studying).
"Love is a Long Road" is more
serious, though still lots of fun to
sing along with. Also on the first
side, "Running Down a Dream"
rocks.
Nothing new here — every
thing's been done before, but
nobody cranks through the old for
mulas better than Tom Petty.
(Well, except maybe Van Halen,
Gene . . . without Sammy "Steroid
Scrotum" Hagar, that is.)
So there you have it: "Full Moon
Fever" is good for a cheap thrill,
cheaper still if you use your Rain
bow Records $2 discount from
your Axe Committee Desk Blotter.
(That's for both of you who saved
it.) Either way, you could do worse
for less than ten dollars — a
Madonna album, for instance.

Van Halen.
Sorry, Gene. This is truly a horse
(okay, record) of a different color.
You might have noticed a reference
to Tom Petty and not the
Heartbreakers; sure enough, the
Heartbreakers are no more, only
to be found in the discarded
volumes of Western Culture
textbooks.

And although Tom Petty's name
appears along on the cover, in truth
there's a cornucopia (I'm using
that word as revenge on a partic
ularly loquacious Pro-Fro) of other
musicians. Perhaps it should be
Tom Petty and the Traveling Wil
burys (minus Bob Dylan) and Most
Anyone Tom Picked Up on the
Long Road of Life and Whatnot.
Jeff Lynne of ELO co-wrote half
the album, George Harrison plays
some guitar, and even Roy provides
posthumous backing vocals. The
"Most Anyone. . ." consists of a
lot of no-name musicians whom

I suspect were the former
Heartbreakers, but 1 don't feel like
chasing down an old album to find
out (besides, I'm not paid much
for this).
So there you have it (them). And
I say, Tom Petty must know it's
spring quarter at Stanford, because
"Full Moon Fever" is perfect relax
ing music for the times you write
gloating letters to friends at Arctic
colleges like Amherst and the Uni
versity of Chicago.
The album's best tracks come
back to back on the first side:
"Won't Back Down" is all over the
radio, and for good reason — it
has a casual atmosphere punctu
ated by a thrilling chorus you just
can't help humming during mid
term review (warning: this may
lead to solo midterm studying).
"Love is a Long Road" is more
serious, though still lots of fun to
sing along with. Also on the first
side, "Running Down a Dream"
rocks.
Nothing new here — every
thing's been done before, but
nobody cranks through the old for
mulas better than Tom Petty.
(Well, except maybe Van Halen,
Gene . . . without Sammy "Steroid
Scrotum" Hagar, that is.)
So there you have it: "Full Moon
Fever" is good for a cheap thrill,
cheaper still if you use your Rain
bow Records $2 discount from
your Axe Committee Desk Blotter.
(That's for both of you who saved
it.) Either way, you could do worse
for less than ten dollars — a
Madonna album, for instance.

Tom Petty prepares to pick his nose in response to another question about his involvement with the Traveling
Wllburys. We ran this same photo back in October. Anyone notice? 9
