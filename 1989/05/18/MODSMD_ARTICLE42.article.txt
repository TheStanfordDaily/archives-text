# Indigo Girls are folksy, from Georgia, but not R.E.M.

The Indigo Girls are Amy Ray and Emily Saliers.
They'll be at the Coffee House at 9 p.m. this Friday.
You ought to think about being there, too.
It's that simple.
The Indigo Girls come out of the college-music
haven in and around Decateur, Ga. They met in
sixth grade and sang together through high school
under the moniker Saliers and Ray, switching names
to the less obvious Indigo Girls while at Emory
University. Their first album, "Strange Fire," was
released in 1987.
And if there seems to be an element of foreshad
owing in the Georgia reference, you've got it: Their
tour circuit included a monthly stop in Athens, Ga.
— home of R.E.M. After making connections with
R.E.M. vocalist Michael Stipe, the Indigo Girls ended
up touring with the band for three weeks as their
opening act.
Sure enough, R.E.M. has returned the favor. All
the band members show up somewhere on the Indigo
Girls' debut album — Michael Stipe pastes back
ground vocals onto "Kid Fears," and the trio of
guitarist Peter Buck, bassist Mike Mills and drummer
Bill Berry fill out the strong instrumental backup on
"Tried to be True."
And they're not the only guests. Ireland's Hothouse
Flowers add mandolin, Hammond Organ and a bit
o' bass to "Secure Yourself," and additional random
musicians pop up on vanous songs.
For the most part, however, the Indigo Girls like
to go it alone. The majority of their material gets
down to basics: guitars and vocals — that's their
forte. The result falls somewhere between easy lis
tening and folk rock, at once relaxing and compelling.

Ray and Saliers claim that their objective in making
the album was to capture their live sound. And like
Van Halen, the Indigo Girls played their songs all
the way through while recording them (no multiple
track mixing). But I'd be the last person on earth to
suggest that the Indigo Girls even remotely resemble
Van Halen.
It's tough to say exactly who they do resemble.
(That's meant as a compliment.) To me, they bring
a fresh, vibrant spirit to the college music scene.
Check your spine for chills as you experience the
melodic masterwork "Closer to Fine." lust try to sit
still during the exhilarating rock kick of 'Tried To
Be True." And see if you don't start humming "Land
of Canaan" or "Secure Yourself" after a long day of
even longer classes.
By no means do the Indigo Girls have operatic
voices — they're quite good, but not remarkable —
though in a way that's part of their appeal. As a
listener you feel that you, too, could be on stage
with an acoustic six-string, turning these ballads just
as well as they.
Such familiarity is re-inforced by the close-to-home
lyrics. "Closer to Fine" advocates a simple approach
to life, disdaining the need to quench the thirst for
knowledge: "There's more than one answer to these
questions pointing me in a crooked line/the less I
seek my source for some definitive/the closer I am
to fine."
Perhaps it's the attention to harmony and
musicianship,- perhaps it's the soul-searching, un
pretentious lyrics; perhaps it's the inescapable feeling
of familiarity with this female guitar and voice duo
that makes this album so satisfying.

The Indigo Girls play Friday at 9 p.m. at the Coffee
House. Admission is free.
