# Pisano will head south

After a four-year reign as Stan
ford's first Fraternal Affairs ad
viser, Joe Pisano's future includes
continued act'.ve participation in
student life, but this time as a
graduate student.
Pisano has opted to head south
to UC-Santa Barbara next year
for a master's degree in classics.
He said he might continue with
a doctoral degree at some later
date.
Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons and Assoc. Dean of Student
Affairs Michael Jackson have
begun a search for Pisano's re
placement by alerting other col
leges and universities of the va
cancy.
Jackson has begun "national
advertising" about the opening to
Student Affairs officers at other
institutions, as well as to national
fraternal and sororital associa
tions. Jackson also hopes to in
volve the leadership of the Inter
fraternity and Intersorority Coun
cils in screening potential job
holders.
Commenting on the state of
fraternal affairs before Pisano,
Lyons acknowledged Stanford's
"jaundiced view towards fraterni
ties in the past." Pisano has soft
ened that tendency, according to
Lyons.
"Joe has done a terrific job and
been very effective," said Lyons.
"He's had very good judgment and
rapport with both the staff and
the students through his job."
"He's fair, honest, open and
tries to keep a balanced view,"
said Jackson of Pisano. "We'll
miss him a great deal."
Pisano's role over the past four
years has been manifold: to work
actively and constructively with
the Greek organizations, to keep
the lines of communication open,
to repond to the needs of these
groups and to be a general adviser
and counselor.
But Pisano modestly denied

calling these areas of change his
own direct achievements. Most
importantly, there have been
fewer behavioral problems, which
Pisano sees more as a reflection
on the system itself and its mem
bers than his own work.
Second, more educational pro
grams have been created, which
constituted a large part of
Pisano's agenda. Although he ad
mitted "you can't force education
at people," Pisano stressed his use
of the "power of persuasion."
Third, Pisano has overseen the
emergence of more contact be
tween the Greek system and the
outside community, which he sees
as essential in breaking down
existing stereotypes about the sys
tem itself.
And finally, in 1986, Pisano
played a pivotal role in the es
tablishment of a collective leader
ship of the Black Greek Letter
System (now called The Afro-
Ainerican Fraternal and Sororal
Association).
Members of the black fraterni
ties and sororities came to Pisano
wanting their own voice distinct
from the one traditional voice of
the IFC/ISC. "They knew best
what their needs were," said
Pisano, who helped them get
recognition as their own govern
ing body.
"I'm more of the front-line kind
of person, but (Lyons) is pivotal
in the final decisions." Pisano
reports directly to Jackson, and
the two have more contact with
individual fraternities and its
members.
In recent years, Pisano has
branched out into other areas of
student life such as involvement
in new student orientation and
being a judicial affairs officer.
Throughout his time at Stan
ford, Pisano said he has seen the
system become stronger and its
members more responsible. He
also said he sees "the changing
standards within the system" as
