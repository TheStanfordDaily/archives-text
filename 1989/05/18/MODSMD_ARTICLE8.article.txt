# Campus detour does the work of three
## 
### Eric Pierce 
For the past few weeks, people
traveling Campus Drive between
Quarry Road and Jordan Way
have had to detour for a few
blocks because the West Campus
Infrastructure project is now
making its way through campus.
Lou a project manager
for Facilities Project Management,

is in charge of the $2.4 million
endeavor. He said that the com
plex project, which began April 17
at Quarry Road by the Stanford
Shopping Mall, is actually three
projects rolled into one.
One facet of the construction
concerns the University's master
storm drainage system. This new
system will help transfer storm
water from the West Campus area

into the San Francisco Bay The
water will travel through nt'wly
installed underground pipes on its
way to the Bay
A second sub-project is the in
stallation of the Medical Center
steam tunnel. Steam, a valued
commodity in any building be
cause it aids in the heating proc-
ess, is in larger demand due to
the recent expansions to the Stan
ford Hospital. The installation of
the tunnel is intended to keep
heating costs to a minimum.
The third project is the con
struction of a sanitary sewer that
will serve Stanford as well as its
neighboring communities.
The contractors behind the
project are MJB Construction lo
cated in Mt. Eden, a city just east
of the San Mateo Bridge.
Lane is pleased with the prog
ress being made and said that
"everything is running on
schedule."
Even though the entire project
will run several months into the
next school year, Lane said
Campus Drive travelers will not
notice the final phases of con
struction. "All the underground
piping should be finished by mid-
August and there should be no
more hassle with the detours," he
said.
