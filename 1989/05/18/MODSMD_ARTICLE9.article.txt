## Congress approves minimum wage bill Bush promises to veto the legislation 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - The
Democratic-controlled Con
gress gave final approval yes
terday to legislation raising the
minimum wage for the first
time in eight years, but Pres
ident Bush said it was "inevi
table" he would kill the mea
sure with the first veto of his
administration.
The vote was 63-37 to ap
prove the plan, which would
boost the minimum wage from
$3.35 an hour to $4.55 by Oc
tober 1991. That vote left sup
porters four votes shy of the
67 needed in the Senate to
override Bush's veto.
Only hours earlier Bush had
vowed anew that his first veto
awaits the bill.
"For me the choice is very
clear," Bush said. "If the
majority of the Congress
rejects my offer of a reasonable
compromise — and we have
made such a proposal — a veto
is going to be inevitable."
Majority Democrats are also
short of that two-thirds over
ride margin in the House,
which passed the bill earlier
this month, but sponsors have
promised a veto override at
tempt nonetheless as part of
an escalating political battle
over the minimum wage and a
larger symbolic clash for mo
mentum on domestic initia
tives.
Nonetheless, being able get
a minimum-wage bill out of
Congress was a symbolic vic
tory of sorts for its sponsors,
who for the past eight years
could not get their proposal
even that far because of then-
President Reagan's vehement

opposition.
And they vowed to advance
another bill if Bush quashes
the measure passed yesterday.
"We want to make it very
clear that this fight is not going
to go away and we are going
to continue this battle until we
get a fair and just increase in
the minimum wage," Sen. Ed
ward Kennedy, D-Mass., told
reporters after the vote.
Democratic congressional
leaders are planning a mock
signing ceremony before for
mally transmitting the mea
sure to the White House, and
plan to hold the bill until after
Congress returns from a
Memorial Day recess so that
Bush cannot veto it while spon
sors are away from Washing
ton.
Leading the GOP effort in
yesterday's debate, Sen. Orrin
Hatch, R-Utah, said the legis
lation "will translate into the
loss of hundreds of thousands
of jobs and job opportunities
for those who most need our
help."
But Kennedy, the measure's
Senate sponsor, rejected such
assertions and made a final call
for Bush to change his position.
"The fundamental issue, the
overriding issue is whether the
Congress of the United State
will once again make the min
imum wage a living wage and
thereby ease the burden of
poverty pressing down on mil
lions of our fellow citizens on
the lowest rung of the eco
nomic ladder," Kennedy said.
"The administration proposal
is a sham."
