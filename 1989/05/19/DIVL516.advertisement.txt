Report to the Academic Council
President Donald Kennedy
May 18,1989
Colleagues:
•
In this year's report to the Council, I intend to give an
interim response to the report of the University Committee
on Minority Issues. I hope to outline our general reactions
to the Report, our continuing process for getting its major
recommendations reviewed and ultimately implemented by
the cognizant sectors of the University, and a more particular
response to certain recommendations on which we think
immediate action can be, or already has been, taken. When
I say we or our in what follows, I mean to speak for the
Provost and the President in a single breath. Please bear in
mind that these are preliminary highlights, not a finished
product. Other forums will be available for the discussion
of specific responses by Deans, departments and committees.
INTRODUCTION
To begin with, I want to say how much the Provost
and I appreciate both the extent and the quality of effort
that has been expended by Professor Camarillo and his
colleagues on the University Committee on Minority Issues.
Students were heavily involved in this process at all stages.
Four students were UCMI members, students participated
in the selection, students were surveyed and participated
in focus groups. In the phases that follow there will be
more opportunities for involvement. There is student mem
bership on the key university committees that will be involved
in the next stage. Members of the faculty will likewise be
crucial to the enusing processes of evaluation, priority-setting
and implementation.
No doubt we could have done better on some aspects
of the process; we don't claim perfection, but we do assure
you of the sincerity of our effort to be inclusive and to
reach out for a wide array of views. The Report is, in our
judgment, a document of outstanding quality. It is based
on extensive research, some of it new and unique. It supports
its recommendations with good data and thoughtful argu
ment. And it provides a comprehensive view of minority
issues and problems in the University that all of us can
employ to enhance our understanding of the multicultural
community Stanford University is — and the even better
one it can become.
The Report took two years of hard work to produce,
and it contains approximately 120 recommendations. It was
received by us about six weeks ago. Therefore it must be
obvious to you that this response is only the first of what
will be a series of assignments and actions to give life to
the Committee's work. I should emphasize that at this time
we are not eliminating any proposition from consideration,
not rejecting any recommendation, not even attaching
priorities to different recommendations. We are taking note
of some recommendations on which we believe immediate
action is possible, and announcing a process through which
the complex task of reviewing, prioritizing, and implementing
will be undertaken. To that process I now turn.
PROCESS
Before receiving the Report, the Provost and I named
an Interim Task Force to direct the approximately 120
recommendations of the Report into the appropriate
decision-making channels. That Task Force is co-chaired by
Registrar Sally Mahoney and Vice Provost Raymond Bac
chetti. It has tne following additional members: Adrian Arima,
Doug Brown, Cecilia Burciaga, Michael Jackson, Stephen
Peeps, Jamie Willmes, Ellen Woods and Fernando de Necoc
hea.
The Interim Task Force identified 22 offices and com
mittees in the University to which various recommendations
were explicitly directed. I have attached to this Report a
list of those University officers and committee chairs to
which particular recommendations were referred. The Task
Force asked for preliminary responses from each by May
1. In three cases, deadlines beyond May 1 were established
for particular reasons. We have received 19 responses; they
total about 150 pages in length. I have us ed them in
preparing this preliminary report, and the Interim Task Force
has subjected them to careful analysis. The next step, which
begins next week, will see the Task Force sitting down with
particular respondents, finding out more about their plans,
and in some cases pushing for commitments. Where there
are major recommendations with significant resource re
mends.
There were also some less encouraging themes in the
responses to the report, and it is only fair to note these as
well.
• The balance between central and local responsibility
is uncertain with respect to some of the recommen
dations. Minority faculty recruitment and the use of
the faculty affirmative action fund is a good case in
point: Is the problem primarily one of budget, or of
local departmental initiative?
• More attention needs to be paid to the requirements
of graduate students. Part of the problem is that
some important issues weren't included in the UCMI
Report. There is also a need for coordination between
the Dean of Graduate Studies and DOSA. The Interim
Task Force will help form a collaboration between
these units in order to move forward, and students
will be involved as well.
Un no •11 ■ '•>' si ill 11
• There is not enough focus on the role of faculty
members as supervisors. This has implications not
only for the recommendations involving staff; it is an
important matter for student recruitment and reten
tion, and for faculty development as well.
Now to some highlights of the recommendations them
selves.
HIGHLIGHTS
A. FACULTY
The key recommendation in this area is to increase the
number of minority faculty by thirty over the next ten years.
The Provost has said that this target is "reasonable and
within reach given real effort on the part of the institution."
Thus the recommendation is accepted as a target, and we
are prepared to commit our full energies to reaching it.
There is, nevertheless, some difference of view between
UCMI on the one hand and the Provost and me on the
other. We do not believe that minority appointments have
failed because of lack of billets or funds available from the
Faculty Affirmative Action Fund. UCMI appears to believe
that the "pipeline problem" has been exaggerated, whereas
we believe that it is a real and serious limitation. In our
view, the relatively rapid gains in minority appointment
made in the early 1970's were due to "pent-up supply,"
i.e. the presence in higher education of minority scholars
who had received a Ph.D. and were already teaching, and
who had the credentials for appointment to the Stanford
faculty. Once this cohort was redistributed throughout higher
education, the supply stabilized — and is today inadequate
to the needs of all those institutions that wish to increase
minority faculty as we do.
By citing this difference, we do not mean to cast
reservations on the enthusiasm with which we approach
this recommendation. We would urge, however, that the
target of thirty new minority appointments over the next
decade be regarded as an ambitious goal that may be
attainable with commitment and hard work.
UCMI recommends the creation of an Executive Com
mittee on Faculty Affirmative Action, composed of senior
faculty members who will help the Provost extend the reach
of affirmative action and expand his expertise.
This recommendation is viewed by the Provost as an
excellent one. It is accepted, and will be implemented as
soon as feasible.
Additional proposals in this area recommend the es
tablishment of post-doctoral fellowship programs for minority
scholars, and junior faculty development leave programs.
These proposals will be considered by the Provost and the
Deans, since they obviously have significant resource impli
cations. Some version of these proposals may need to be
integrated with other kinds of mechanisms: the use of visiting
and other temporary positions, and the making of more
"target of opportunity" appointments. We may, in addition,
need to develop a special repertoire of responses to being
raided, since the kinds of enticements now being offered
to minority faculty are substantial.
B. UNDERGRADUATE CURRICULUM
Funds already exist to support curriculum development,
including curriculum development projects dealing with race,
ethnicity or gender. Funded projects have included the new
introductory course in American Race and Ethnicity, to be
offered for the first time in American Studies during 1989-90.
There are also new workshops for freshman writing instructors
on methods for the treatment of ethnicity and gender, and
new support for the involvement each spring of a small
number of Stanford students on the Zuni Pueblo.
These opportunities can be multiplied by the use of
quirements, a priority-setting process will be put in place
— either within the unit itself, or through the establishment
of consideration among the groups on the list of 22.
The next stages will be very important. Stanford Uni
versity is not a monolithic organization; it works in a de
centralized fashion, through effective organizations that exist
at human scale. The UCMI Report is for all of us, not just
for the President and Provost to realize. We gladly accept
the responsibility for leadership, but we urge understanding
of the proposition that everyone at Stanford is the target
for, and necessary to the success of, these recommendations,
and that appropriate and forthcoming responses will benefit
us all.
THEMES
We recognize four themes that are implicit and explicit
in the work of UCMI, and that should inform our response
to the recommendations just as they inform the recommen
dations themselves. The first of these is pluralism. We have
adopted a model here at Stanford that is quite different
from an "assimilation" model. While accepting the ultimate
importance of individual difference on the one hand, and
the strong feelings of collective membership in the Stanford
community on the other, we recognize at the same time
the validity of important group memberships. By validating
their importance we accept the basic design of a multicultural
community, and commit ourselves to the encouragement
and preservation of these groups so that their members can
gain in support from one another, and so that each of us
may learn from all of them.
The second theme is inclusion. We accept the notion
of group difference as part of the Stanford mission, as
belonging to the community. Thus we confirm that many
minority issues and concerns are not the special pleadings
of interest groups but are Stanford issues — ones that should
engage all of us.
The third theme is partnership. We cannot foster
pluralism and accomplish inclusion without broad-scale par
ticipation. Our progress toward the realization of Stanford's
goals in this area is everyone's vision, and if we can attain
it we will become the joint owners of our success. And if
we fail, it is our own expectations we shall disappoint, and
not some value or expectation someone else has imposed
on us.
The fourth and last is leadership. We believe that
building an interactive multicultural community calls on
Stanford's leadership in several ways: first, within the insti
tution itself to achieve the UMCI vision; second, as an
institution that demonstrates by example to others what is
possible; and third, as the place in which the next generation
of leaders will learn to extend the vision to other communities
in their own lives.
THE RESPONSES
Let me now turn to the responses we have received
from Deans, Directors, Committees, and various staff offices.
The first thing to be said about them is that they are positive,
on the whole accepting the Report and its arguments and
seeing the recommendations as well-supported.
Indeed, there is evidence everywhere that University
officers and committees have worked in parallel with the
UCMI effort already, taking ideas that developed from pre
liminary deliberations within the Committee and applying
them to the development of new programs or policies. Thus
some recommendations have already been implemented.
Among them are these examples:
• The Committee on Graduate Studies has revised its
Affirmative Action Policy Statement, and has set up
a subcommittee to facilitate and monitor affirmative
action policies regarding graduate student recruitment

Let me now turn to the responses we have received
from Deans, Directors, Committees, and various staff offices.
The first thing to be said about them is that they are positive,
on the whole accepting the Report and its arguments and
seeing the recommendations as well-supported.
Indeed, there is evidence everywhere that University
officers and committees have worked in parallel with the
UCMI effort already, taking ideas that developed from pre
liminary deliberations within the Committee and applying
them to the development of new programs or policies. Thus
some recommendations have already been implemented.
Among them are these examples:
• The Committee on Graduate Studies has revised its
Affirmative Action Policy Statement, and has set up
a subcommittee to facilitate and monitor affirmative
action policies regarding graduate student recruitment

Colleagues:
•
In this year's report to the Council, I intend to give an
interim response to the report of the University Committee
on Minority Issues. I hope to outline our general reactions
to the Report, our continuing process for getting its major
recommendations reviewed and ultimately implemented by
the cognizant sectors of the University, and a more particular
response to certain recommendations on which we think
immediate action can be, or already has been, taken. When
I say we or our in what follows, I mean to speak for the
Provost and the President in a single breath. Please bear in
mind that these are preliminary highlights, not a finished
product. Other forums will be available for the discussion
of specific responses by Deans, departments and committees.
INTRODUCTION
To begin with, I want to say how much the Provost
and I appreciate both the extent and the quality of effort
that has been expended by Professor Camarillo and his
colleagues on the University Committee on Minority Issues.
Students were heavily involved in this process at all stages.
Four students were UCMI members, students participated
in the selection, students were surveyed and participated
in focus groups. In the phases that follow there will be
more opportunities for involvement. There is student mem
bership on the key university committees that will be involved
in the next stage. Members of the faculty will likewise be
crucial to the enusing processes of evaluation, priority-setting
and implementation.
No doubt we could have done better on some aspects
of the process; we don't claim perfection, but we do assure
you of the sincerity of our effort to be inclusive and to
reach out for a wide array of views. The Report is, in our
judgment, a document of outstanding quality. It is based
on extensive research, some of it new and unique. It supports
its recommendations with good data and thoughtful argu
ment. And it provides a comprehensive view of minority
issues and problems in the University that all of us can
employ to enhance our understanding of the multicultural
community Stanford University is — and the even better
one it can become.
The Report took two years of hard work to produce,
and it contains approximately 120 recommendations. It was
received by us about six weeks ago. Therefore it must be
obvious to you that this response is only the first of what
will be a series of assignments and actions to give life to
the Committee's work. I should emphasize that at this time
we are not eliminating any proposition from consideration,
not rejecting any recommendation, not even attaching
priorities to different recommendations. We are taking note
of some recommendations on which we believe immediate
action is possible, and announcing a process through which
the complex task of reviewing, prioritizing, and implementing
will be undertaken. To that process I now turn.
PROCESS
Before receiving the Report, the Provost and I named
an Interim Task Force to direct the approximately 120
recommendations of the Report into the appropriate
decision-making channels. That Task Force is co-chaired by
Registrar Sally Mahoney and Vice Provost Raymond Bac
chetti. It has tne following additional members: Adrian Arima,
Doug Brown, Cecilia Burciaga, Michael Jackson, Stephen
Peeps, Jamie Willmes, Ellen Woods and Fernando de Necoc
hea.
The Interim Task Force identified 22 offices and com
mittees in the University to which various recommendations
were explicitly directed. I have attached to this Report a
list of those University officers and committee chairs to
which particular recommendations were referred. The Task
Force asked for preliminary responses from each by May
1. In three cases, deadlines beyond May 1 were established
for particular reasons. We have received 19 responses; they
total about 150 pages in length. I have us ed them in
preparing this preliminary report, and the Interim Task Force
has subjected them to careful analysis. The next step, which
begins next week, will see the Task Force sitting down with
particular respondents, finding out more about their plans,
and in some cases pushing for commitments. Where there
are major recommendations with significant resource re
mends.
There were also some less encouraging themes in the
responses to the report, and it is only fair to note these as
well.
• The balance between central and local responsibility
is uncertain with respect to some of the recommen
dations. Minority faculty recruitment and the use of
the faculty affirmative action fund is a good case in
point: Is the problem primarily one of budget, or of
local departmental initiative?
• More attention needs to be paid to the requirements
of graduate students. Part of the problem is that
some important issues weren't included in the UCMI
Report. There is also a need for coordination between
the Dean of Graduate Studies and DOSA. The Interim
Task Force will help form a collaboration between
these units in order to move forward, and students
will be involved as well.

• There is not enough focus on the role of faculty
members as supervisors. This has implications not
only for the recommendations involving staff; it is an
important matter for student recruitment and reten
tion, and for faculty development as well.
Now to some highlights of the recommendations them
selves.
HIGHLIGHTS
A. FACULTY
The key recommendation in this area is to increase the
number of minority faculty by thirty over the next ten years.
The Provost has said that this target is "reasonable and
within reach given real effort on the part of the institution."
Thus the recommendation is accepted as a target, and we
are prepared to commit our full energies to reaching it.
There is, nevertheless, some difference of view between
UCMI on the one hand and the Provost and me on the
other. We do not believe that minority appointments have
failed because of lack of billets or funds available from the
Faculty Affirmative Action Fund. UCMI appears to believe
that the "pipeline problem" has been exaggerated, whereas
we believe that it is a real and serious limitation. In our
view, the relatively rapid gains in minority appointment
made in the early 1970's were due to "pent-up supply,"
i.e. the presence in higher education of minority scholars
who had received a Ph.D. and were already teaching, and
who had the credentials for appointment to the Stanford
faculty. Once this cohort was redistributed throughout higher
education, the supply stabilized — and is today inadequate
to the needs of all those institutions that wish to increase
minority faculty as we do.
By citing this difference, we do not mean to cast
reservations on the enthusiasm with which we approach
this recommendation. We would urge, however, that the
target of thirty new minority appointments over the next
decade be regarded as an ambitious goal that may be
attainable with commitment and hard work.
UCMI recommends the creation of an Executive Com
mittee on Faculty Affirmative Action, composed of senior
faculty members who will help the Provost extend the reach
of affirmative action and expand his expertise.
This recommendation is viewed by the Provost as an
excellent one. It is accepted, and will be implemented as
soon as feasible.
Additional proposals in this area recommend the es
tablishment of post-doctoral fellowship programs for minority
scholars, and junior faculty development leave programs.
These proposals will be considered by the Provost and the
Deans, since they obviously have significant resource impli
cations. Some version of these proposals may need to be
integrated with other kinds of mechanisms: the use of visiting
and other temporary positions, and the making of more
"target of opportunity" appointments. We may, in addition,
need to develop a special repertoire of responses to being
raided, since the kinds of enticements now being offered
to minority faculty are substantial.
B. UNDERGRADUATE CURRICULUM
Funds already exist to support curriculum development,
including curriculum development projects dealing with race,
ethnicity or gender. Funded projects have included the new
introductory course in American Race and Ethnicity, to be
offered for the first time in American Studies during 1989-90.
There are also new workshops for freshman writing instructors
on methods for the treatment of ethnicity and gender, and
new support for the involvement each spring of a small
number of Stanford students on the Zuni Pueblo.
These opportunities can be multiplied by the use of
quirements, a priority-setting process will be put in place
— either within the unit itself, or through the establishment
of consideration among the groups on the list of 22.
The next stages will be very important. Stanford Uni
versity is not a monolithic organization; it works in a de
centralized fashion, through effective organizations that exist
at human scale. The UCMI Report is for all of us, not just
for the President and Provost to realize. We gladly accept
the responsibility for leadership, but we urge understanding
of the proposition that everyone at Stanford is the target
for, and necessary to the success of, these recommendations,
and that appropriate and forthcoming responses will benefit
us all.
THEMES
We recognize four themes that are implicit and explicit
in the work of UCMI, and that should inform our response
to the recommendations just as they inform the recommen
dations themselves. The first of these is pluralism. We have
adopted a model here at Stanford that is quite different
from an "assimilation" model. While accepting the ultimate
importance of individual difference on the one hand, and
the strong feelings of collective membership in the Stanford
community on the other, we recognize at the same time
the validity of important group memberships. By validating
their importance we accept the basic design of a multicultural
community, and commit ourselves to the encouragement
and preservation of these groups so that their members can
gain in support from one another, and so that each of us
may learn from all of them.
The second theme is inclusion. We accept the notion
of group difference as part of the Stanford mission, as
belonging to the community. Thus we confirm that many
minority issues and concerns are not the special pleadings
of interest groups but are Stanford issues — ones that should
engage all of us.
The third theme is partnership. We cannot foster
pluralism and accomplish inclusion without broad-scale par
ticipation. Our progress toward the realization of Stanford's
goals in this area is everyone's vision, and if we can attain
it we will become the joint owners of our success. And if
we fail, it is our own expectations we shall disappoint, and
not some value or expectation someone else has imposed
on us.
The fourth and last is leadership. We believe that
building an interactive multicultural community calls on
Stanford's leadership in several ways: first, within the insti
tution itself to achieve the UMCI vision; second, as an
institution that demonstrates by example to others what is
possible; and third, as the place in which the next generation
of leaders will learn to extend the vision to other communities
in their own lives.

Let me now turn to the responses we have received
from Deans, Directors, Committees, and various staff offices.

ticipation. Our progress toward the realization of Stanford's
goals in this area is everyone's vision, and if we can attain
it we will become the joint owners of our success. And if
we fail, it is our own expectations we shall disappoint, and
not some value or expectation someone else has imposed
on us.
The fourth and last is leadership. We believe that
building an interactive multicultural community calls on
Stanford's leadership in several ways: first, within the insti
tution itself to achieve the UMCI vision; second, as an
institution that demonstrates by example to others what is
possible; and third, as the place in which the next generation
of leaders will learn to extend the vision to other communities
in their own lives.
THE RESPONSES
Let me now turn to the responses we have received
from Deans, Directors, Committees, and various staff offices.
The first thing to be said about them is that they are positive,
on the whole accepting the Report and its arguments and
seeing the recommendations as well-supported.
Indeed, there is evidence everywhere that University
officers and committees have worked in parallel with the
UCMI effort already, taking ideas that developed from pre
liminary deliberations within the Committee and applying
them to the development of new programs or policies. Thus
some recommendations have already been implemented.
Among them are these examples:
• The Committee on Graduate Studies has revised its
Affirmative Action Policy Statement, and has set up
a subcommittee to facilitate and monitor affirmative
action policies regarding graduate student recruitment

Colleagues:
•
In this year's report to the Council, I intend to give an
interim response to the report of the University Committee
on Minority Issues. I hope to outline our general reactions
to the Report, our continuing process for getting its major
recommendations reviewed and ultimately implemented by
the cognizant sectors of the University, and a more particular
response to certain recommendations on which we think
immediate action can be, or already has been, taken. When
I say we or our in what follows, I mean to speak for the
Provost and the President in a single breath. Please bear in
mind that these are preliminary highlights, not a finished
product. Other forums will be available for the discussion
of specific responses by Deans, departments and committees.
INTRODUCTION
To begin with, I want to say how much the Provost
and I appreciate both the extent and the quality of effort
that has been expended by Professor Camarillo and his
colleagues on the University Committee on Minority Issues.
Students were heavily involved in this process at all stages.
Four students were UCMI members, students participated
in the selection, students were surveyed and participated
in focus groups. In the phases that follow there will be
more opportunities for involvement. There is student mem
bership on the key university committees that will be involved
in the next stage. Members of the faculty will likewise be
crucial to the enusing processes of evaluation, priority-setting
and implementation.
No doubt we could have done better on some aspects
of the process; we don't claim perfection, but we do assure
you of the sincerity of our effort to be inclusive and to
reach out for a wide array of views. The Report is, in our
judgment, a document of outstanding quality. It is based
on extensive research, some of it new and unique. It supports
its recommendations with good data and thoughtful argu
ment. And it provides a comprehensive view of minority
issues and problems in the University that all of us can
employ to enhance our understanding of the multicultural
community Stanford University is — and the even better
one it can become.
The Report took two years of hard work to produce,
and it contains approximately 120 recommendations. It was
received by us about six weeks ago. Therefore it must be
obvious to you that this response is only the first of what
will be a series of assignments and actions to give life to
the Committee's work. I should emphasize that at this time
we are not eliminating any proposition from consideration,
not rejecting any recommendation, not even attaching
priorities to different recommendations. We are taking note
of some recommendations on which we believe immediate
action is possible, and announcing a process through which
the complex task of reviewing, prioritizing, and implementing
will be undertaken. To that process I now turn.
PROCESS
Before receiving the Report, the Provost and I named
an Interim Task Force to direct the approximately 120
recommendations of the Report into the appropriate
decision-making channels. That Task Force is co-chaired by
Registrar Sally Mahoney and Vice Provost Raymond Bac
chetti. It has tne following additional members: Adrian Arima,
Doug Brown, Cecilia Burciaga, Michael Jackson, Stephen
Peeps, Jamie Willmes, Ellen Woods and Fernando de Necoc
hea.
The Interim Task Force identified 22 offices and com
mittees in the University to which various recommendations
were explicitly directed. I have attached to this Report a
list of those University officers and committee chairs to
which particular recommendations were referred. The Task
Force asked for preliminary responses from each by May
1. In three cases, deadlines beyond May 1 were established
for particular reasons. We have received 19 responses; they
total about 150 pages in length. I have us ed them in
preparing this preliminary report, and the Interim Task Force
has subjected them to careful analysis. The next step, which
begins next week, will see the Task Force sitting down with
particular respondents, finding out more about their plans,
and in some cases pushing for commitments. Where there
are major recommendations with significant resource re
mends.
There were also some less encouraging themes in the
responses to the report, and it is only fair to note these as
well.
• The balance between central and local responsibility
is uncertain with respect to some of the recommen
dations. Minority faculty recruitment and the use of
the faculty affirmative action fund is a good case in
point: Is the problem primarily one of budget, or of
local departmental initiative?
• More attention needs to be paid to the requirements
of graduate students. Part of the problem is that
some important issues weren't included in the UCMI
Report. There is also a need for coordination between
the Dean of Graduate Studies and DOSA. The Interim
Task Force will help form a collaboration between
these units in order to move forward, and students
will be involved as well.

• There is not enough focus on the role of faculty
members as supervisors. This has implications not
only for the recommendations involving staff; it is an
important matter for student recruitment and reten
tion, and for faculty development as well.
Now to some highlights of the recommendations them
selves.
HIGHLIGHTS
A. FACULTY
The key recommendation in this area is to increase the
number of minority faculty by thirty over the next ten years.
The Provost has said that this target is "reasonable and
within reach given real effort on the part of the institution."
Thus the recommendation is accepted as a target, and we
are prepared to commit our full energies to reaching it.
There is, nevertheless, some difference of view between
UCMI on the one hand and the Provost and me on the
other. We do not believe that minority appointments have
failed because of lack of billets or funds available from the
Faculty Affirmative Action Fund. UCMI appears to believe
that the "pipeline problem" has been exaggerated, whereas
we believe that it is a real and serious limitation. In our
view, the relatively rapid gains in minority appointment
made in the early 1970's were due to "pent-up supply,"
i.e. the presence in higher education of minority scholars
who had received a Ph.D. and were already teaching, and
who had the credentials for appointment to the Stanford
faculty. Once this cohort was redistributed throughout higher
education, the supply stabilized — and is today inadequate
to the needs of all those institutions that wish to increase
minority faculty as we do.
By citing this difference, we do not mean to cast
reservations on the enthusiasm with which we approach
this recommendation. We would urge, however, that the
target of thirty new minority appointments over the next
decade be regarded as an ambitious goal that may be
attainable with commitment and hard work.
UCMI recommends the creation of an Executive Com
mittee on Faculty Affirmative Action, composed of senior
faculty members who will help the Provost extend the reach
of affirmative action and expand his expertise.
This recommendation is viewed by the Provost as an
excellent one. It is accepted, and will be implemented as
soon as feasible.
Additional proposals in this area recommend the es
tablishment of post-doctoral fellowship programs for minority
scholars, and junior faculty development leave programs.
These proposals will be considered by the Provost and the
Deans, since they obviously have significant resource impli
cations. Some version of these proposals may need to be
integrated with other kinds of mechanisms: the use of visiting
and other temporary positions, and the making of more
"target of opportunity" appointments. We may, in addition,
need to develop a special repertoire of responses to being
raided, since the kinds of enticements now being offered
to minority faculty are substantial.
B. UNDERGRADUATE CURRICULUM
Funds already exist to support curriculum development,
including curriculum development projects dealing with race,
ethnicity or gender. Funded projects have included the new
introductory course in American Race and Ethnicity, to be
offered for the first time in American Studies during 1989-90.
There are also new workshops for freshman writing instructors
on methods for the treatment of ethnicity and gender, and
new support for the involvement each spring of a small
number of Stanford students on the Zuni Pueblo.
These opportunities can be multiplied by the use of
quirements, a priority-setting process will be put in place
— either within the unit itself, or through the establishment
of consideration among the groups on the list of 22.
The next stages will be very important. Stanford Uni
versity is not a monolithic organization; it works in a de
centralized fashion, through effective organizations that exist
at human scale. The UCMI Report is for all of us, not just
for the President and Provost to realize. We gladly accept
the responsibility for leadership, but we urge understanding
of the proposition that everyone at Stanford is the target
for, and necessary to the success of, these recommendations,
and that appropriate and forthcoming responses will benefit
us all.
THEMES
We recognize four themes that are implicit and explicit
in the work of UCMI, and that should inform our response
to the recommendations just as they inform the recommen
dations themselves. The first of these is pluralism. We have
adopted a model here at Stanford that is quite different
from an "assimilation" model. While accepting the ultimate
importance of individual difference on the one hand, and
the strong feelings of collective membership in the Stanford
community on the other, we recognize at the same time
the validity of important group memberships. By validating
their importance we accept the basic design of a multicultural
community, and commit ourselves to the encouragement
and preservation of these groups so that their members can
gain in support from one another, and so that each of us
may learn from all of them.
The second theme is inclusion. We accept the notion
of group difference as part of the Stanford mission, as
belonging to the community. Thus we confirm that many
minority issues and concerns are not the special pleadings
of interest groups but are Stanford issues — ones that should
engage all of us.
The third theme is partnership. We cannot foster
pluralism and accomplish inclusion without broad-scale par
ticipation. Our progress toward the realization of Stanford's
goals in this area is everyone's vision, and if we can attain
it we will become the joint owners of our success. And if
we fail, it is our own expectations we shall disappoint, and
not some value or expectation someone else has imposed
on us.

tution itself to achieve the UMCI vision; second, as an
