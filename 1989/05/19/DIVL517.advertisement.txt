and retention. The Dean of the Graduate School has
already, in this same connection, accepted the min
imum goal of doubling targeted minority enrollment
in Ph.D. programs within the next five years.
•The Committee on Undergraduate Studies and the
H & S Curriculum Committee have worked on prob
lems of student progress through the introductory
math and science courses. The result has been a
new program in mathematics (SEMAP) and a new
introductory chemistry sequence with a special in
troductory quarter (Chemistry 32) that will separate
students with unusually strong high school chemistry
backgrounds from the others. These programs, to
gether with a recent proposal to the Irvine Foundation,
have gone a long way to meeting a part of the
undergraduate curriculum recommendation.
• The Registrar is already committed to establish a way
of using the University student record data base to
record a more extensive array of awards and honors
achieved by Stanford students, as the report recom
these and additional funds that are available for general
curriculum development. Discretionary reserves, newly avail
able to the President and Provost, as well as a pending
foundation grant, will help provide support for these pur
poses.
It seems probable that faculty interest and time will be
more limiting than funding in governing the rate of new
course development in this area. If that is not that the case,
then new sources of funds will be considered. We shall
earnestly promote faculty interest in this area, and hope
that the target rate of new course development can be
reached.
Regarding post-doctoral fellows in teaching programs
and ethnic studies: Pending Foundation proposals request
support for the funding of nine post-doctoral fellows over
a six year period, a somewhat smaller number than is called
for in the recommendation. The Dean of Humanities and
Sciences has indicated that he intends to provide funding
for additional minority post-doctoral fellows in the School
of Humanities and Sciences; together, these two sources
may come quite close to meeting the recommendation.
With respect to the Ethnic Studies Curriculum Development
Task Force, the joint sponsorship by four different entities
will require collaborative consideration, and that will be
undertaken in the near future.
Regarding a course distribution requirement on ethnic
and racial minorities in the U.S.: the Subcommittee on
Distribution Requirements of the Committee on Undergradu
ate Studies has been considering this for the past several
months. It will report back to the parent committee by the
end of the academic year, and during 1989-90 the Senate
should be able to consider a CUS recommendation. Input
from student groups, through the student representatives on
the Cohnmittee on Undergraduate Studies, will be helpful
in shaping this outcome.
n A-senior visiting faculty member in Ethnic Studies has
rn a rrcenrfodrfrJatlcm
action on that request, we are also giving consideration to
the possibility that minority faculty from other institutions
might spend leave time at Stanford. The Dean of Under
graduate Studies has been in active discussions with Howard
University over such a program. We will be reporting soon
on the outcome of all these initiatives.
The review of specific curricular areas has already been
well begun. I mentioned earlier the SEMAP course in math
ematics, and the initiation of an alternative first-quarter
course in chemistry.
In summary, most of the recommendations in the section
on undergraduate curriculum can be implemented — in
substantial part if not in full. Work already in progress has
resulted in the fulfillment of many of them; as to most of
the rest, we are either awaiting news from grant requests,
or the results of consultation among appropriate groups.
C. STUDENT LIFE
There is a large array of recommendations under this
heading. The most general one challenges the Dean of
Student Affairs "to provide more visible and pro-active
leadership by articulating new values generating new ex
pectations and setting new standards for student life at
Stanford." The Dean responds that he has welcomed this
challenge, accepts the recommendation, and proposes to
take the lead in giving shape and substance to the goal of
"interactive pluralism" at Stanford.
Accordingly, DOSA will revise and then discuss with
students and others its current statement of philosophy, in
response to the UCMI recommendation to that effect. In
addition, the response to the specific recommendation that
DOSA "cease limiting ethnically related professional positions
to 50% of full-time appointments," the Dean has responded
that DOSA began to implement this recommendation last
year and expects to complete it by September 1, 1989. As
a consequence, every Center will have a full-time dean /
director with full-time support or the equivalent.
Further upward classification of the Assistant Deans /
Center Directors will be complete by September 1989.
Other recommendations with respect to the residence sys
tem, including recruitment and training of residence staff,
and multicultural educational activities, are being considered
and will be reported on during the coming year.
Major proposals for the redesign of graduate residential
education are included in the recommendations. These need
to be thought through carefully between DOSA and the
Office of the Dean of Graduate Studies; those considerations
would obviously benefit from input by graduate student
organizations, and we will seek it actively.
Recommendations in the area of student financial aid
and admissions are under active consideration; since these
will demand significant resources and coordination between
units, they will require some time.
Financial Aids accepts the recommendations regarding
training to enhance the multicultural skills of professional
staff.
D. STAFF
Staff issues, it will be noted, do not occupy a large
portion of the UCMI Report. In our view, that is because
Stanford's human resources philosophy, planning, and strat
egies are as yet underdeveloped in general. This area is
being actively addressed by the administration now, and
the SRI-administered questionnaire that contributed to other
parts of the Report has been given to staff and will be
analyzed this summer. Findings and recommendations re
sulting from it will be developed, reviewed by the UCMI
Chair and Editorial Committee, and published.
Of the recommendations that were included, we accept
those regarding the establishment of a Review Board, the
development of comprehensive plans in each Vice Presi
dential area to achieve pluralism, and aggressive recruitment
and advancement of minority staff. The latter initiative is
under development now.
The recommendation to establish a minority manage
ment fellowship program is under consideration, but we
think it presents some complexities that will need consid
erable work.
Finally, the report makes a major recommendation that
the President and Provost create a "University Committee
on the Status of Multiracial Affairs." This was to be a standing
committee that would follow up on UCMI recommendations,
appoint oversight committees, make periodic assessments,
and report annually.
We accept this recommendation in spirit, but would
propose a slightly different alternative: an Annual Review
Panel to be composed of individuals with strong credentials
in multicultural and / or Stanford affairs, including some
from outside the university, and a process, still to be de
termined, for enlisting consistent and informed student rep
resentation. It would meet annually, would have the power
to investigate as needed, and would give both a public
report to the community and a private report to the President
and Provost.
In addition, we would plan to lodge in the Senior
Associate Provost / Affirmative Action Officer continuing
responsibility to stimulate and to monitor the progress of
the UCMI recommendations. The Annual Review Panel and
the office headed by the Senior Associate Provost / Affirmative
Action Officer would play an interactive role at the center
of minority issues. They would work together in a format
rather like accreditation, in which the Senior Associate
Provost / Affirmative Action Officer would prepare for visits
by the Panel by developing analysis and reports on institu
tional action — so as to shape the important issues for the
Panel and present them in a way that permits the Panel to
render its best judgment about how we are doing, and how
we might do better.
Let me conclude this section of my report by saying
how glad we are to be able to respond positively to so
many major recommendations. The Provost and I — and
I believe that we speak for the institution as a whole —
are committed to the vision of the UCMI Report, and to a
steady, strategic attack on the work that needs to be done
to realize that vision. Remember, please, that the develop
ment of active pluralism at Stanford is an experiment, one
that will require the enthusiastic participation of all who
want it to succeed. There are those, here and elsewhere,
who hope it will fail. I hope we can deny them that victory.
It been rewarding to see the determination and enthu
siasm that underlies the response of our colleagues to this
important document. This report of mine has, accordingly,
been upbeat, and I hope you will all agree that its news
is good news.
Unfortunately, I now must turn to a more somber subject.
Even as I was preparing this report in my office on Sunday,
others were apparently preparing to seize that office early
Monday morning. My account of the subsequent events
naturally depends upon information and observations com
municated to me by others, mainly members of my staff.
At about approximately 7:45 a.m. on Monday, the
protestors gained entry by a well-planned ruse perpetrated
on a receptionist. A student leader known to, and trusted
by, the staff in Building Ten was admitted on the basis of
a misrepresentation of her intentions. She then helped others
force their way into the building. Later the receptionist and
another member of my staff were evicted in a way that
can only be described as menacing. Telephones were un
plugged and doors barricaded with two-by-fours and chains
brought for that purpose. Communications and work essential
to the function of the University were disrupted for more
than a day, and the confusion and discontinuity will take
much longer than that to repair. The direct cost to the
institution was great, though perhaps not so great as other
costs to which I shall refer in a moment.
Several principles governed our response to this disrup
tion. They are not new principles; they are the same ones
that were in force during the administration of President
Lyman, and that have been continued in this one. First,
institutional processes must be restored as soon as is con
sistent with the safety of students and others. Second, no
negotiation or discussion of substance will take place in'
response to unlawful coercion. Third, we do not suspend
our willingness to talk and work toward solutions when
those discussions have an origin outside the coercive context.
Fourth, we do discuss with protestors their options and the
consequences of their actions, so that they can make well
informed personal choices according to their own convic
tions. Fifth, the consequences of those choices follow —
that is, whatever sanctions are prescribed by outside laws
and by campus policies will proceed.
We followed these principles carefully in the present
case and will continue to do so. Vice President and General
Counsel John Schwartz and Director of Public Safety Marvin
Herrington directed the University's responses on the scene,
and I was in frequent communication with them. Several
concerned faculty and staff members were given access to
the occupied building, and numerous efforts were made to
persuade the occupants to leave. Commitments to later
discussions on my own part were offered and rejected. The
decision to make arrests was not a matter of first, but of
last resort; and the Stanford police handled a very difficult
task with admirable restraint and professionalism.
When the arrest protocols specified under the Sheriff's
policies had filled a police bus with arrestees, the bus was
illegally blockaded, and a potentially dangerous crowd sit
uation resulted. Arrangements were then made so that the
protestors could be cited and released at the scene rather
than at the jail or the police station. As a result the danger
was averted. The protestors have claimed that this result
was a "victory." Indeed it was — a victory of restraint and
of good sense.
I have told the press that I was surprised both by the
occurrence and by the style of this disruption. The occurrence
surprised me because it intercepted a process that was
consensual and that, I thought, deserved and enjoyed general
if not universal respect in the Stanford community. The
style surprised me because it suggested a willingness to
engage in threats and interference that I have not seen at
Stanford during this decade. And.l was also surprised at the
few individuals who, once the occupation was established
and public attention had been focused on it, were prepared
to ignore or forgive these facts, and to lend their direct or
tacit support to an unfortunate and illegal venture. Despite
these feelings, I have agreed to meet on Monday with ten
representatives of the student group supporting the Agenda
for Action in order to hear their views.
To all this I cannot help but add one more concern.
Over the past two years, pride in this community has put
energy and enthusiasm behind our representations, to the
world outside, of the Stanford community as one in which
an ambitious progressive spirit coexists with a commitment
to reason.
We have asserted that claim on Stanford's behalf in
response to various external attacks on our processes —
attacks in which we have been accused, for example, of
changing our curriculum in response to coercion. Many of
you on this faculty have been wholehearted participants in
a more reasoned process, including some who had deep
reservations themselves about the changes that were being
made. I thank you for that. But today, we have to ask
ourselves how much damage has been done to our
credibility. I fear that the events of this week have wrought
heavy damage, and may have rekindled doubts among our
friends as to whether we are a community dedicated to
rational process and deserving of their respect. And I think
particularly of other institutions that may have sought in us
a model for change, and may now wonder whether we are
worth imitating after all.
So, my friends, we now face a challenge: that of
repairing and restoring confidence, while still pressing ahead
with the vision I believe most of us share. I promise you
that I am ready to put aside my own disappointment and
begin, and I hope I will be joined in the task by all who
love Stanford.
