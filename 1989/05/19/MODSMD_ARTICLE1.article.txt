# The 						Kennedy response:
## Implementing UCMI, piecemeal 
### Ken Yew Staff writer 
University President Donald
Kennedy, responding yesterday
for the first time to the report of
the University Committee on Mi
nority Issues, accepted its recom
mendations with reservations.
Speaking before the Academic
Council, Kennedy said he accepted
the proposals in principle, but he
stated several reasons why the
goals set by UCMI may not be
fully implemented within the time
set by the committee.
Kennedy said that his response
was not affected by Monday's stu
dent occupation of his office. He
said, "every single element" of his
speech was "in place Sunday."
Faculty
Kennedy accepted the UCMI
recommendation to increase the
number of minority faculty by 30
over the next 10 years. However,
he stated that he and Provost
James Rosse disagree with the
UCMI report's finding that there
are an adequate number of qual
ified minority faculty candidates.
The dearth of good minority pro
fessors may prevent the full im
plementation of this recommenda
tion, Kennedy said.
Kennedy attributed the prob
lem to the long time needed to
obtain a doctorate. He said the
large number of minority doctoral
students who obtained tenure in
the 1970s are all currently estab
lished. He said that most of the
remaining qualified minority
scholars are still in graduate
school.
Kennedy added that the recom
mendation to establish post
doctoral fellowship programs for
minority scholars will be consid

ered further, since such a project
would "have significant resource
implications."
Kennedy also said he will create
an Executive Committee on Fac
ulty Affirmative Action, to over
see the hiring of more minorities.
History Prof. A 1 Camarillo,
UCMI chair, said he was pleased
with Kennedy's commitment to
hire 30 more minority faculty.
"We thought that was a very am
bitious, difficult goal," he said,
"We didn't think the University
would respond so quickly."
Undergraduate Curriculum
Kennedy attributed Stanford's
poor ethnic studies curriculum to
a lack of faculty interest. Without

giving any specifics, he said the
University will try to promote
greater faculty interest before al
locating more funds to course de
velopment.
Camarillo said he was disap
pointed by Kennedy's "lack of
specificity" in undergraduate cur
riculum recommendations.
Kennedy said there will also be
a program to obtain nine ethnic
studies post-doctoral teaching fel
lows in the next six years. This
is less than UCMI's recommended
four teaching fellows per year for
three years.

Kennedy added that the dean
of Humanities and Sciences has
committed to provide funding for
minority fellows which, together
with the nine teaching fellows,
"may come quite close to meeting
the recommendation."
According to Kennedy, the Uni
versity Subcommittee on Distri
bution Requirements has been
studying the possibility of an eth
nic studies DR for several months
and a recommendation should be
made to the Faculty Senate next
school year.
Kennedy also said efforts are
underway to secure visiting pro
fessors in ethnic studies from
Howard University, a predomi
nantly black institution, and other
colleges.

Student Life
Kennedy said Dean of Student
Affairs James Lyons has begun
implementing the UCMI proposal
to provide the four ethnic com
munity centers with full-time
deans.
Recommendations still under
consideration, either because of
time or cost, are multicultural
training for residence staff, an
ethnic residential education pro
gram for graduate students, and
all of UCMI's proposals concern
ing financial aid and admissions.
Staff
Kennedy accepted the recom
mendations to establish a Review

Hoard that will track minority
progress in University depart
ments and a commitment for "ag
gressive recruitment and advance
ment of minority staff."
He said that a proposed minor
ity management fellowship pro
gram is under consideration but,
he added without elaborating,
"presents some complexities that
will need considerable work."
UCMI Standing Committee
The UCMI recommended that
an ongoing University Committee
on the Status of Multicultural Af
fairs be formed to oversee the im
plementation of the recommen
dations.

Kennedy modified this propos
al, saying he wanted to create in
stead a review board that would
meet annually.
A new administrative position
would be created to continually
check on the progress of minority
issues.
This official would prepare data
and recommendations for the an
nual meeting.
Kennedy said that some of
UCMI's recommendations have
already been implemented, such
as a commitment by the dean of
Graduate Studies to double the
number of targeted minority doc
toral candidates within the next
five years.
Kennedy also said new intro

ductory math and chemistry
courses have been developed to
help minority students, who tradi
tionally have problems with these
courses because of inadequate
high school preparation.
In his introduction, Kennedy
emphasized the role of student in
volvement in bringing about
change through membership on
University committees and said
that more student involvement
through administrative channels
will be available.
Kennedy said the next step will
involve the UCMI Interim Task
Force discussing the specific plans
to be implemented with each of
the departments affected by the
report.

courses because of inadequate
high school preparation.
In his introduction, Kennedy
emphasized the role of student in
volvement in bringing about
change through membership on
University committees and said
that more student involvement
through administrative channels
will be available.
Kennedy said the next step will
involve the UCMI Interim Task
Force discussing the specific plans
to be implemented with each of
the departments affected by the
report.
University President Donald
Kennedy, responding yesterday
for the first time to the report of
the University Committee on Mi
nority Issues, accepted its recom
mendations with reservations.
Speaking before the Academic
Council, Kennedy said he accepted
the proposals in principle, but he
stated several reasons why the
goals set by UCMI may not be
fully implemented within the time
set by the committee.
Kennedy said that his response
was not affected by Monday's stu
dent occupation of his office. He
said, "every single element" of his
speech was "in place Sunday."
Faculty
Kennedy accepted the UCMI
recommendation to increase the
number of minority faculty by 30
over the next 10 years. However,
he stated that he and Provost
James Rosse disagree with the
UCMI report's finding that there
are an adequate number of qual
ified minority faculty candidates.
The dearth of good minority pro
fessors may prevent the full im
plementation of this recommenda
tion, Kennedy said.
Kennedy attributed the prob
lem to the long time needed to
obtain a doctorate. He said the
large number of minority doctoral
students who obtained tenure in
the 1970s are all currently estab
lished. He said that most of the
remaining qualified minority
scholars are still in graduate
school.
Kennedy added that the recom
mendation to establish post
doctoral fellowship programs for
minority scholars will be consid

ered further, since such a project
would "have significant resource
implications."
Kennedy also said he will create
an Executive Committee on Fac
ulty Affirmative Action, to over
see the hiring of more minorities.
History Prof. A 1 Camarillo,
UCMI chair, said he was pleased
with Kennedy's commitment to
hire 30 more minority faculty.
"We thought that was a very am
bitious, difficult goal," he said,
"We didn't think the University
would respond so quickly."
Undergraduate Curriculum
Kennedy attributed Stanford's
poor ethnic studies curriculum to
a lack of faculty interest. Without

giving any specifics, he said the
University will try to promote
greater faculty interest before al
locating more funds to course de
velopment.
Camarillo said he was disap
pointed by Kennedy's "lack of
specificity" in undergraduate cur
riculum recommendations.
Kennedy said there will also be
a program to obtain nine ethnic
studies post-doctoral teaching fel
lows in the next six years. This
is less than UCMI's recommended
four teaching fellows per year for
three years.

Kennedy added that the dean
of Humanities and Sciences has
committed to provide funding for
minority fellows which, together
with the nine teaching fellows,
"may come quite close to meeting
the recommendation."
According to Kennedy, the Uni
versity Subcommittee on Distri
bution Requirements has been
studying the possibility of an eth
nic studies DR for several months
and a recommendation should be
made to the Faculty Senate next
school year.
Kennedy also said efforts are
underway to secure visiting pro
fessors in ethnic studies from
Howard University, a predomi
nantly black institution, and other
colleges.

Student Life
Kennedy said Dean of Student
Affairs James Lyons has begun
implementing the UCMI proposal
to provide the four ethnic com
munity centers with full-time
deans.
Recommendations still under
consideration, either because of
time or cost, are multicultural
training for residence staff, an
ethnic residential education pro
gram for graduate students, and
all of UCMI's proposals concern
ing financial aid and admissions.
Staff
Kennedy accepted the recom
mendations to establish a Review

Hoard that will track minority
progress in University depart
ments and a commitment for "ag
gressive recruitment and advance
ment of minority staff."
He said that a proposed minor
ity management fellowship pro
gram is under consideration but,
he added without elaborating,
"presents some complexities that
will need considerable work."
UCMI Standing Committee
The UCMI recommended that
an ongoing University Committee
on the Status of Multicultural Af
fairs be formed to oversee the im
plementation of the recommen
dations.

Kennedy modified this propos
al, saying he wanted to create in
stead a review board that would
meet annually.
A new administrative position
would be created to continually
check on the progress of minority
issues.
This official would prepare data
and recommendations for the an
nual meeting.
Kennedy said that some of
UCMI's recommendations have
already been implemented, such
as a commitment by the dean of
Graduate Studies to double the
number of targeted minority doc
toral candidates within the next
five years.
Kennedy also said new intro

ductory math and chemistry
courses have been developed to
help minority students, who tradi
tionally have problems with these
courses because of inadequate
high school preparation.
