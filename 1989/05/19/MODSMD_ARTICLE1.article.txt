# The
						Kennedy response:
## Implementing UCMI, piecemeal 
### Ken Yew Staff writer 
University President Donald
Kennedy, responding yesterday
for the first time to the report of
the University Committee on Mi
nority Issues, accepted its recom
mendations with reservations.
Speaking before the Academic
Council, Kennedy said he accepted
the proposals in principle, but he
stated several reasons why the
goals set by UCMI may not be
fully implemented within the time
set by the committee.
Kennedy said that his response
was not affected by Monday's stu
dent occupation of his office. He
said, "every single element" of his
speech was "in place Sunday."
Faculty
Kennedy accepted the UCMI
recommendation to increase the
number of minority faculty by 30
over the next 10 years. However,
he stated that he and Provost
James Rosse disagree with the
UCMI report's finding that there
are an adequate number of qual
ified minority faculty candidates.
The dearth of good minority pro
fessors may prevent the full im
plementation of this recommenda
tion, Kennedy said.
Kennedy attributed the prob
lem to the long time needed to
obtain a doctorate. He said the
large number of minority doctoral
students who obtained tenure in
the 1970s are all currently estab
lished. He said that most of the
remaining qualified minority
scholars are still in graduate
school.
Kennedy added that the recom
mendation to establish post
doctoral fellowship programs for
minority scholars will be consid

ered further, since such a project
would "have significant resource
implications."
Kennedy also said he will create
an Executive Committee on Fac
ulty Affirmative Action, to over
see the hiring of more minorities.
History Prof. A 1 Camarillo,
UCMI chair, said he was pleased
with Kennedy's commitment to
hire 30 more minority faculty.
"We thought that was a very am
bitious, difficult goal," he said,
"We didn't think the University
would respond so quickly."
Undergraduate Curriculum
Kennedy attributed Stanford's
poor ethnic studies curriculum to
a lack of faculty interest. Without
