About 100 Stanford students and faculty held a
noontime rally yesterday in front of Old Union to
express their support for massive student demon
strations in China that are challenging that coun
try's communist leadership.
Rally organizers said they hoped the event might
add pressure on the Chinese government to imple
ment speedy democratic reforms.
On Wednesday in Bering, more than one million
protesters packed the city's central Tiananmen
Square to demand reform and to show support for
3,000 students who have been hunger-striking since
Saturday.
Speakers at yesterday's rally, which was organized
by the Association of Chinese Students and Scholars
at Stanford, said quick action was necessary because
many of the hunger strikers had already been taken
to the hospital for care. Students in China plan to
continue their hunger strike until their demands
are met.
Xu Yizi, a graduate student in applied physics,
said the demands of the Beijing protesters were for
freedom of the press, removal of corrupt government
officials, immediate release of political prisoners and
more direct dialogue with government leaders.
"We may seem to be naive, inexperienced and
perhaps even radical, but we have no other alter
natives," Xu said. "We have to give democracy a
chance."
Lu Jun Yin, graduate student in philosophy, said
it was exciting to be able to tell the Chinese gov
ernment what to do after 40 years of the government
always telling them what to do.
