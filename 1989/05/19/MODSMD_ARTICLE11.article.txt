# Greeks sponsor bed frolic for hospital philanthropy
## 
### DJ Berinstein Senior staff writer 
Greeks racing in beds? Sounds a little
nutty, but the Interfraternity and Inter
sorority Councils will be sponsoring the
First Annual Bedraces tomorrow to benefit
the Stanford Children's Hospital.
The bedraces will be conducted on
Mayfield Avenue in front of Florence Moore
Hall from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. Ten platform
dollies — the beds — will be raced by
teams of eight members; four students will
push the giant skateboards and four stu
dents will ride on top of them.
So far, 27 teams have paid the $35 reg
istration fee. These teams represent the
full spectrum of both dorms, fraternities
and sororities. The event is expected to
raise a total of $1,000 for the hospital.
Earlier this year, a Rainbow Records rep
resentative, Junior Jill Jurkowitz, con
tacted former IFC President Chris Erlin
saying the company would sponsor some
type of philanthropic event, but left it up
to Erlin to design the program.
In January, Jacqueline Wedge, assistant
director for Children's Day Around the Bay
contacted Erlin in hopes of re-involving
Greek members in the hospital. "Many fra
ternity and sorority members have been
involved in the hospital personally, but it
hasn't been since the 1960s that the entire
system has been involved," said Wedge.
As a result, Rainbow Records will spon
sor the event, radio station X-100 (FM 99.7)
will broadcast music, and KRON-TV will
videotape the participants as they fly down
the hill.

Four students will push the
giant skateboards and four
students will ride on top of
them.

The event is actually part of a larger
service event, Children's Day Around the
Bay, according to Erlin, which will be held
June 4 at eight meyor locations around the
Bay including the Monterey Bay Aquarium
and Marine World. KRON will tape those
events as well and then present the fined
broadcast including the Stanford clips.
As far as the races themselves, "the em
phasis will not be just on speed, but also
on creativity," said Erlin. "There will be
prizes for best theme, the most inventive
costume and both the fastest and the
slowest beds.
"The event combines competition, exer
cise, creativity, philanthropy and expo
sure," he said.
The newly created "beds" will be saved
for the event next year. "We want to make
it an invitational," said Wedge, who hopes
to include other schools such as UC-
Berkeley and San Jose State the following
year. "The Greek system has been really
eager to get involved, and we're really ex
cited about the renewal of the connection.
It's fantastic what they're doing," Wedge
said.
Any students wishing to get together a
team should contact Erlin by tonight at
322-2019.
