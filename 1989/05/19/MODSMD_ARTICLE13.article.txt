## Noriega refuses negotiations Government rejects mediation by Organization of American States 
### 
PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) â€” Of
ficial media said yesterday the Organ
ization of American States has neither
the right nor authority to negotiate a
change in Panama's government or the
departure of Gen. Manuel Antonio Nor
iega.
U.S. officials in Washington said the
Bush administration is prepared to urge
stepped-up pressure on Noriega if he
ignores an OAS call for a transfer of
power in Panama.
The Catholic Church in Panama ap
plauded the OAS call.
"This is a great step forward," said
Panamanian Archbishop Marcos
McGrath. "I'm gratified that the organ
ization has taken this seriously and that
it is bringing to bear its influence, coun
sel, exhortations and, to a certain extent,
threats."
Also yesterday, Luis Anderson, a
member of the nine-member directorate
of the Panama Canal Commission since
1983, resigned to protest what he said
was government brutality and violations

of civil rights.
In his resignation letter to acting
President Manuel Solis Palma, he con
demned "the actions of your government
against civilians and opposition leaders,
whose peaceful protests were met with
savage and bestial use of force."
Anderson was the second Panama
nian member to resign this year, after
Carlos Velarde. The directorate com
prises five U.S. citizens and four Pan
amanians.
Panama proposed Arnulfo Suarez to
replace Velarde, but the nomination is
subject to U.S. approval.
At a special meeting Wednesday night
in Washington, the OAS foreign minis
ters said power should be transferred
through democratic means in Panama.
They left the details to a mediation
team consisting of the foriegn ministers
of Guatemala, Ecuador and Trinidad
and Tobago.
Senior U.S. officials met with Latin
American diplomats yesterday to dis
cuss strategy for dealing with Noriega

if he refuses to cooperate with OAS
mediators.
Panamanian Foreign Minister Jorge
Ritter promised on Wednesday that his
government will cooperate fully with the
mediators, but there was little expecta
tion in Washington that negotiations
will go smoothly.
Opposition leaders interpreted the
OAS resolution as a demand for the
departure of Noriega, who has com
manded the 15,000 member Defense
Forces since 1983 and is de facto ruler
of Panama.
"It is important to note that the res
olution speaks of a transfer of power
and that it insists that Noriega must
retire," said Ricardo Arias Calderon, op
position candidate for first vice presi
dent in the May 7 election.
On the government's Radio Nacional,
commentator Rigoberto Paredes coun
tered that the ministers "must not come
with the proposal that Noriega leave,
because that is an internal Panamanian
affair."
