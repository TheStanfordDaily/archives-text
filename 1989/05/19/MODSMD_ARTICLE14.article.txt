BEIJING (AP) â€” Communist
Party chief Zhao Ziyang and Pre
mier Li Peng visited student
hunger strikers before dawn
today, praising their "good inten
tions" but urging them to end
their six-day protest.
Yesterday, nearly a million
people poured into central Beijing,
demanded that senior leader Deng
Xiaoping step down and expressed
support for the 3,000 students
who are fasting for democratic
reform.
"We've come too late," the of
ficial Xinhua News Agency quoted
Zhao as telling emaciated fasters
on Tiananmen Square early today.
"You have good intentions," the
party general secretary was
quoted as saying. "You want our
country to become better. The
problems you have raised will
eventually be resolved. But things
are complicated and there must
r be a process tor resntvp"thPS( T pTTrts' r "
I lems.
Xinhua said students cheered
. and clapped when Zhao and Li
made their unscheduled appear
ance. But it did not give the stu
dents' response to the leaders'
plea to end the protest.
Zhao, talking to fasters, said:
"The party and government
hope you will become calm and
stop the hunger strike immedi
i ately. The party and government
will not stop the dialogue with
i you when you put an end to the

hunger strike."
Yesterday, Li met with student
leaders and told them the hunger
strike has thrown China into
chaos. Students said no progress
was made in meeting their de
mands.
Government and party leaders
have been meeting representatives
from official student groups to dis
cuss the monthlong student cam
paign for a freer society and less
official society.
However, they have refused to
recognize newly formed indepen
dent student groups. The groups,
which have organized the
protests, say the government
must negotiate with them because
the official student groups are
controlled by the government.
Thousands of trucks, buses,
motorcyles and vans packed with
protesters inched into the central
city yesterday in the second
straight massive protest" fori a
freer China.
Undaunted by .two downpdurs,
the marchers chanted, sang,
banged on pots and pans, and
some acrobats did backflips as
they converged on the square.
Sparked by sympathy for the
striking students, the protests are
the most widespread in Commu
nist China's 40-year history.
Their broad appeal is reminiscent
of the People's Power movement
in the Philippines that ousted
President Ferdinand Marcos.
