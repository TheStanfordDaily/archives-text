SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -
The Legislature yesterday ap
proved a bill making California
the first state to restrict semi
automatic assault weapons, a
measure prompted by a school
yard shooting rampage that left
five dead.
The bill went to Gov. George
Deukejian, who has agreed to sign
it.
"This is an historic moment in
which the Legislature and gover
nor have come together to address
the violence on our streets every
day," said Senate President Pro
Tem David Roberti, a Los Angeles
Democrat.
Republican Sen. Ed Davis, a
former Los Angeles chief of police,
denounced the measure as "twist

ing the constitution out of shape."
"This is a sad day for liberty
in America," Davis said. "This is
the result of emotion and panic
thinking" and"it is not going to
work."
The legislation was introduced
in January after a deranged
drifter, Patrick Purdy, fired more
than 100 rounds with an AK-47
assault rifle into a Stockton
schoolyard, killing five students
and wounding 29 children and a
teacher.
The Senate approved the bill
27-1 1 .. The Assembly gave its ap
proval less than an hour later on
a 41-35 vote, a bare majority of
the 80-seat house.
The legislation is the second
half of a two-part package that

would restrict sale and possession
of more than 50 models of assault
weapons," including the AK-47.
The first bill passed earlier this
month, but Deukmejian refused
to sign it without compromise lan
guage inserted into the second
bill. It lowers the penalty in some
instances of failure to register
guns owned before the law took
effect.
Both bills would virtually ban
the sale of the affected weapons
after Jan. 1, 1990, but would al
low people who legally obtained
the weapons before June 1 of this
year to keep the firearms.
It would take a special permit,
like those required for machine
guns, to keep an assault weapon
obtained after the cutoff date.
