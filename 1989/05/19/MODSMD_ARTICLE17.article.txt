# Court lifts stay on minor's abortion
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - The
Supreme Court cleared the way
yesterday for a 15-year-old Florida
girl — and any other minor in
the state — to obtain an abortion
without the consent of her parents
or a judge.
The justices, without comment
or recorded dissent, lifted an order
Justice Anthony Kennedy had
issued two days earlier blocking
a Lake County girl identified only
as T.W. from having an abortion.
Thursday's action was a
procedural one, and not a ruling
on the merits of T.W.'s case or
the constitutionality of the
Florida law.
The court's action makes un
enforceable, at least until Septem
ber, a Florida law requiring some
girls to get permission from their
parents or a state judge before
having an abortion.
Florida ufliaaU,. reaulia* io Urn
high court's order, asked tne state
Supreme Court on Thursday to
expedite fts planned review of
T.W.'s case, or to allow the state
law to be enforced until the
Florida court's previously sched
uled September review of the case.
Kennedy's order had sparked
widespread speculation about his
views on abortion.
He is considered to hold a pivo
tal vote in a Missouri case asking
the justices to reverse or curtail
the court's 1973 decision in Roe
v. Wade legalizing abortion. A de

cision in that case is expected by
late June.
Anti-abortion and abortion
rights lawyers yesterday cau
tioned against reading too much
significance into Kennedy's ear
lier order.
"I don't believe his action lends
any real insight into his views on
Roe v. Wade," said James Bopp
of the National Right to Life Com
mittee. "It shows he takes the
Supreme Court cases on parental
involvement seriously but beyond
that, I don't think you can say
much more."
Bopp said he was disappointed
by the court's action yesterday.
Charlene Carres of the Ameri
can Civil Liberties Union in
Florida, hailed the court's action
and said it vindicates "our initial
impression that this was not any
Wnd of si«n that Justice Kennedy
would be an anti
dwiet'VOte in the [Missouri 1 case."
The Florida case began when
T.W., who is 12 weeks pregnant,
sought a judge's permission ear
lier this month for an abortion.
She said she feared physical and
emotional abuse if she told her
parents.
The judge struck down as un
constitutional a parental-consent
law enacted in February, and his
ruling was upheld by a state ap
peals court.
