## A 						definitive 'yes' 
### 
By urging probe of
racial cases, Kennedy
clarifies Standard

WOULD CALLING some
one a "nigger" at Stan
ford be punishable by the
current Fundamental Standard
without added interpretation?
This is a typical question
everyone has been asking, and
which no one had officially at
tempted to answer until Univer
sity President Donald Kennedy
did in the Faculty Senate's May
4th meeting. And his clear and
decisive answer comes as a great
relief after months of vacillating
on this delicate issue.
He says yes. And he wants to
prove it.
By urging Judicial Affairs Of
ficer Sally Cole to investigate two
instances of alleged harassment
cited by Philosophy Prof. John
Perry last week, he is finally ad
dressing the confusion.
Cole cannot prosecute any case
unless the victims file an official
complaint, but Kennedy's un
precedented action sends an im
portant and long-awaited signal:
The President's Office does not
want to allow racist acts to go
unpunished at Stanford.
Kennedy's stance on this issue,
long overdue in coming, does not
dictate University policy. But
presidential impetus and action,
even if only symbolic, carries
great weight.
His message to Cole carries a
broader message to students, say
ing that "harassment on this
campus concerns me." Rightfully
so.

Now concern may finally be
translated into enforcement; how
ever, a community consensus on
policy and application still needs
to be hammered out.
The form and wording of such
a policy on harassment are
very important. But far more im
portant are the implications and
the execution of the policy.
Kennedy sends the message
that name-calling based on race
violates the original Standard.
But what new bounds would an
added interpretation set?
And if a Standard allows judg
ment on a case-by-case basis,
without any bottom line regula
tion, then why have one at all?
In order to make the conduct
code a vital institution at Stan
ford, it must be usable. There
fore, it must be tested. This is
accomplished by Kennedy's un
precedented request to follow-up
on the alleged Standard viola
tions. Any interpretation or
policy is spineless unless it can
be consistently tested.
Kennedy appears to want to
reawaken a latent Fundamental
Standard and impart it with
greater significance in everyday
student life.
But his move reuses many ques
tions. For instance, particularly
how will past behavior, not
prosecuted, be treated? How
rigorously will the Judicial Af
fairs Office judge such violations?
What criteria will be required to
substantiate such claims?
Any good argument consists of
a thesis and then evidence to sup
port it. The University has
taught that for years. Now, at
last, Kennedy is putting the prin
ciple to work by advancing the
current Fundamental Standard
debate and supporting his thesis.
