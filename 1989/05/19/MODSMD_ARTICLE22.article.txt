## The 						protesting business 
### 
I HAVE YET TO completely make up
my mind about the demonstration
Monday.
But there are a few aspects of the event
that particularly disturb me.
• Some students apparently weren't
even sure exactly what was to come out
of the occupation. As the day dragged
on, the event created a carnival-like at
mosphere and students joined in without
knowing what they were agitating for.
In the late afternoon, many of the stu
dents involved outside were demonstrat
ing more against the police, I guess in
the spirit of light-hearted fun that goes
along with spring, than for the Students
of Color Coalition's demands.
• The people occupying the President's
Office were totally unreasonable in their
demands. From the accounts that I have
heard or read of the negotiating process
that took place during the event, I believe
the University bent over backwards to
find a compromise that would have gotten
the students out of the building without
arrests.
President Kennedy, through third par
ties, offered to meet with the leaders of
the Coalition at specific times later in
the week, or even the same day of the
demonstration, provided the occupation
was ended.
But the students refused. They wanted
a meeting "NOW," as they say in the
protest business. It is completely unclear
to me what difference a few hours would
make in the effect or content of any con
versation between Kennedy and the Co
alition.
All of this history leads me to believe

that the Students of Color Coalition does
not really want a substantive meeting
with Kennedy. What they really want is
to feel like they have the power to de
termine the agenda for the University.
• The San Jose Mercury News reported
Tuesday that the van used in the dem
onstration to block the police bus is
owned by the ASSU. And rumors have
circulated that ASSU funds were used
to support the demonstration.
I have a real problem with the ASSU
becoming a defense fund for the Students
of Color Coalition or in any way directly
supporting their efforts.
On whose authority and according to
what mandate does the ASSU — theoreti
cally a body that represents all students'
interests — support such activities?
I would be very interested to see the
results of a straw poll regarding students'
opinions of whether the ASSU should be
an agitative body.
Until such a straw poll is conducted,
I find it ridiculous for the ASSU to op
erate on the idea that they have a man
date to actively support building
occupations.
• The most humorous aspect of the oc
cupation was that students involved were
surprised that police were called in, and
that they were arrested.
It's funny how it works: you break the
law, and you get arrested.
The students involved were informed
that they were breaking the law. Uni
versity officials themselves informed the
protesters of this since there was some
concern on the part of the University
that the protesters didn't realize the

repercussions of their actions.
People who unlawfully assemble on
private property should be arrested.
I would respond differently if the stu
dents had conducted a sit-in, which is
entirely different than a building occupa
tion.
A building occupation is a serious ac
tion and it deserved a serious response.
Many of the issues the Students of
Color Coalition have included in their
list of demands are very positive. I think
my ambivalence about the Monday dem
onstration is more a result of the means
used to express those demands.
There are no doubt situations in which
building occupations are necessary and
appropriate responses.
But the University is working very
quickly relative to most institutions of
its size to address the concerns expressed
in the University Committee on Minority
Issues report.
In the time since the report was re
leased, the University has been gathering
information and formulating a response.
The fact that Kennedy gave his response
so quickly is a testament to his commit
ment to this issue.
