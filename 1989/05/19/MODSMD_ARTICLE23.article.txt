## Pink triangle symbolizes shame turned into pride 
### 
IN HER MAY 16 letter, Tasha
Soudah asks about the use of the
pink triangle as a symbol within
the gay community. I will attempt to
explain at least some of the aspects of
its use. However, a symbol means
many different things to different
people, and I can not capture them all.
The pink triangle, I suggest, is not
meant primarily for people outside the
gay community. Primarily it is a sym
bol meant for other gay people: a
symbol of pride. It is also a symbol of
struggle and a symbol of remembrance,
but most of all a symbol of pride.
What is meant by gay pride? It is

not the pride of accomplishments, that
sense of self-worth that comes from
having succeeded at doing something
noteworthy, like winning a competition
or graduating from Stanford. Being gay
is not something we do or have done;
it is something we are. In fact, for
many of us it is something we've
always been, without any apparent
turning point or decision.
Neither is gay pride the arrogance of
belonging to a favored elite, like a
country club or the majority race, to
which those who don't (and can't)
belong are second-class individuals.
Gay pride is more like this: After
being told by so many for so long that

we are sick or disgusting or sinful or
worthless for no other reason than
being gay, we respond "No! I am good,
my love is worthy, my life is important
not despite being gay, not because of
being gay, but because I am a whole
person which includes being gay."
For expressing this pride the pink
triangle is a powerful symbol. It was
used to brand people, to make all
other aspects of their life insignificant.
It was imposed — involuntarily — to
demand publicly that this person be
ashamed, disgraced, belittled. Today,
we hear people saying that gay people
shouldn't have rights, shouldn't have
children, should (unlike straight people)

"keep it to themselves." They should
be embarrassed; "dyke" or "faggot"
should be derogatory terms, shameful
epithets.
The pink triangle quietly but firmly
says "No! I am not ashamed. Before, it
was worn unwillingly to disgrace the
wearer; now, I accept this symbol
willingly, publicly. I am not disgraced. I
am confidant and proud. You cannot
make me ashamed of, or embarrassed
by, or accept injustice because I am
different from you."
