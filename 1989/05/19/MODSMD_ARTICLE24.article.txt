# University remains far too silent about homophobic graffiti
## 
### 
Last Wednesday some members of
the Stanford community acted in the
promotion of genocide. In the chalked
messages against gays, they expressed
the desire to exterminate an entire
segment of the community: "Kill
Gays," "Hello AIDS, Good-bye Gays,"
etc.
It is not this action that I wish to
discuss directly, for I believe most
people in the community feel morally
disgusted with the action and the indi
viduals who perpetrated it. Rather, I
wish to discuss the relationship be
tween the community and its members
I suggest that the individual in a
community is defined by both his or
her action and inaction. I also suggest
that inaction does not equal innocence.
Can a person truly be said to be
against racism if he or she lives in a
racist state and does not take any ac
tion to prevent it? Can a member of

the Stanford community truly be
against genocide if he or she takes no
direct action in response to last Wed
nesday's chalking?
Action should be taken by each mem
ber of the community, even if the ac
tion is only to start a conversation in
the dorm. It is important for us to
speak out if we feel that the action of
last Wednesday violated the norms of
the Stanford community.
The University administration, as
the formal policy makers, should take
action to proclaim that such events are
not acceptable at Stanford. Even
though the names of the individuals
may not be known, the administration
should clearly state the University's
position on this issue, perhaps by
stating what the consequences would
be if the individuals were identified.
In light of the present effort to
redefine the Fundamental Standard, it
is important to affirm that the incident
last Wednesday violates the right of all
members to freedom from discrimina
tory attack.
