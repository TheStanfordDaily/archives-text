# Triangle also serves as reminder of work remaining for gays

### 
While I cannot speak for all gay and
lesbian people, I wish to respond to
Tasha Soudah's request in her May 19
letter and provide my own explanation
for the use of the pink triangles in
fliers and graffiti during Gay and Les
bian Awareness Week.
In the Nazi concentration camps,
prisoners were labeled with a colored
triangle according to what undesirable
group they belonged to. Jews wore
yellow, political dissidents wore red,
and likewise other groups: gypsies,
trade unionists, homosexuals and
others.
The homosexuals wore pink tri
angles; several hundred thousand were
killed by the Nazis. When the camps
were "liberated" by allied forces, the
survivors wearing pink triangles re
mained imprisoned for they were con
sidered criminals.

Here in America in 1989 many gays
and lesbians display pink triangles
because we remain unliberated, and
because we ask, as do Jews, that the
world never forget what happened in
the camps.
It is terribly clear, though, that
many have already forgotten, or never
learned that history lesson. Today
people are beaten or killed because of
who they love, and governments and
individuals fail to respond to the
spread of a fatal disease that usually
only kills certain types of men and
women, most often the ones with the
pink triangles.
I look forward to the day that I no
longer need to wear this symbol.
