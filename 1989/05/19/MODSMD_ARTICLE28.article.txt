Women who work
still quite able to be
great moms as well
If John Chuang's point in his May
17 column was that we should appreci
ate the sacrifices our mothers make
for us, I agree wholeheartedly. But the
re√üt of his column disturbs me a bit.
Chuang tells how his mother
sacrificed a career to raise her three
children, and how he appreciates that
sacrifice. He then tells about a friend
whose parents both worked, and about
that friend's problems, which Chuang
thinks are due to parental neglect.
It's tempting to draw the conclusion
that women who give up their careers
to devote themselves to their families
are better mothers than those who

don't, isn't it?
Let me counter with some anecdotal
arguments of my own. My mother has
worked for most of her adult life.
Her children turned out fine. My
best friend's father left before she was
born; her mother has to work. They
have the closest mother-daughter rela
tionship I've ever seen.
What conclusion can we draw now?
The point is that it's impossible to
make any sweeping value judgments.
Some mothers work because they have
to; others work because they want to;
others choose not to work. None of
this says anything about whether they
are good mothers.
And then there's the question of
working fathers (do their children turn
out all right?), but that's another let
ter. . . .

Present system for
the Draw is product
of careful thought
We are writing in response to Nat
haniel Bletter's May 9 letter in which
he recommends that the Draw be
changed so that students can draw
their number before ranking their
housing preferences.
We currently ask students to list
their housing preferences before
drawing their number so that they will
list choices they want, not choices they
think their number will get them into.
Cut-off numbers for houses can
change dramatically from year to year.
They are affected by groups of stu
dents drawing into a house, Returning
Resident Priority (which is being

phased out), changes in the popularity
of a house and changes in the resi
dence options available in the Draw,
among other factors.
For example, the cut-off number for
men in Storey House rose from 178 in
1988 to 945 in 1989.
If Bletter had drawn 945 this year
before ranking his Draw choices, he
would likely have thought that he
could not get into Storey based on last
year's cut-off number, and conse
quently would not have listed it as a
choice even though he might want to
live there.
We advise students to list a range of
housing choices on their Draw card,
but to list only houses where they
want to live.
Students should not list houses sim
ply because the houses had a high or
low cut-off number last year.
The principles and procedures of the

Draw are examined closely each year
by University committees (with stu
dents' representation), the Stanford
Housing Center and other offices in
the Department of Residential Affairs
The change which Bletter recom
mends has been considered before, hut
the current policy has been consistently
supported and reinforced (as recently
as last year).
We realize that the uncertainty in
herent in a housing lottery can be
stressful, but given the broad range of
housing options at Stanford and the
limited number of students who can
live in a given house, the Draw pro
vides a necessary and fair means of
allocating housing.
