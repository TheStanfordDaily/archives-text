## Students driven to sit in because of University intransigence 
### 
ON MONDAY, STANFORD stu
dents were arrested. The arrests
were the culmination of a day
when students had occupied University
President Donald Kennedy's office since
7:40 a.m. Others joined in the protest
by blocking the door when the police
tried to enter to arrest the occupying
students; and hundreds rallied outside
in support.
After the arrests, Stanford students
blocked the path of the bus that was
taking the students to jail by creating
a barricade of locked bikes, leaving
cars with deflated tires in the bus'
path and by surrounding the bus and
refusing to move. Others tried to block
cars taking students to jail, some
sitting in front of cars that drove
towards them.
Why did Stanford students take such
actions on this day? What drove stu
dents to actions so unusual for this
campus? Those of us who were ar
rested, those who sat in and those who
supported the sit-in had no desire to
jrejv.u >r isun, yon
campus.
We were driven to sit in at the
President's Office out of a deep anger
at the treatment of students on this
campus, particularly students of color.
For example, Asian-American students
have been working for years to start
tOv Asian-American Studies prograra
here. All year long they have been
circulating petitions, holding programs
and discussions, meeting with the
History Department, meeting with the
provost, gaining ASSU support.

They've done just about everything
they could have. And yet instead of a
commitment to hiring an Asian-
American Studies professor, what do
they encounter? The claim that Asian-
American Studies is not a "legitimate"
field of study because Asians have not
been in this country long enough.
Basically, they have received nothing
but a slap in the face for their sincere
and sorious efforts. After a year of
working through channels and outside
channels, all in the hope of securing
just and legitimate goals, and after
encountering nothing but intransigence
and excuses, we felt the need to take
dramatic action.
With only a few weeks left in the
ve«r and virtually nothing to* show for
our efforts of working vrrth the admirv
istration, we decided to take an action
that would demonstrate our serious
ness of purpose and elicit a serious
response.
For years, students have been calling

for the same things: ethnic studies,
faculty of color, protection from dis
crimination, priority on teaching in
stead of research and more financial
aid, among others.
Many of today's students' demands
were first issued in 1968 by the Black
Student Union in the wake of Martin
Luther King, Jr.'s assassination. These
demands have been re-issued continu
ally throughout the 1970s and 1980s,
iiicy are not new and they are not
unreasonable. And yet our voice is
continually dismissed and ignored.
For example, MEChA has been
working for democratic governance of
El Centro Chicano all year long, pursu
ing this goal through numerous meet
ings with administrators. Their request
is simple: that the committees govern
ing the Chicano student center be
made up of students, staff and faculty
who are democratically elected, not
appointed by administrators.
Yet here we are in spring quarter,

and the administration still has not
made any commitment to remedying
this clearly unreasonable situation.
Why must change be so difficult 9 Why
must students spend hours upon hours
working for goals that are just, work
able and easy to implement?
Furthermore, much of the tension of
the day was brought on by the presi
dent's decision to call in the police to
arrest students immediately. He chose
to take this course instead of agreeing
to discuss issues with us and attempt
to resolve the situation.
This decision to arrest students
without negotiating on any of the
issues in the Agenda for Action further
illustrates their approach to students
— instead of asking themselves why 5C
students felt so frustrated with Univer
sity processes, administrative officials
quickly called in the riot police to
arrest and threaten us with felony
charges and expulsion.
This stands in sharp contrast to
schools across the country who have
responded to student takeovers with
negotiations, diplomacy and amnesty
for the students. Why must Stanford
be so unreasonable in contrast to other
universities?
Some have asked us why we took
the action when we did instead of
waiting for Kennedy's response to the
University Committee on Minority
Issues report. Yet the entire process of
dealing with UCMI has demonstrated
the lack of student input and democ
racy at this university.
After the release of the UCMI

report, the President's Office sought
out feedback from departments and
offices all over the University, but has
neglected to invite any student input
from the ASSU, resident assistants, |
advising associates, MEChA, the BSU,
the Asian-American Student Association
and the Stanford American Indian
Organization or any other student
group. Kennedy is setting his priorities
without asking students what our
priorities are!
In a university that values its
tuition-paying students, ignoring stu
dent priorities is absurd. Thus, we had
no reason to believe that Kennedy
would report he was implementing the
priorities of students. We sought to
make a difference in his report
beforehand. By sitting in, we feel that
we have let them know they must
listen to the student voice — we will
no longer be ignored.
But even then many would ask, why
sit in? Why not pursue other channels
before taking such a radical stand* 7 We•
chose to make a bold statement by
occupying Kennedy's office to express
the importance and urgency of our
demands.
The gesture symbolized students'
right to determine our education. We
have gone through the processes set
up by the administration for years
now, and have been met only with . ;
intransigence and excusospour frustra
tion at our treatment led us to such ao

ness of purpose and elicit a serious
response.
For years, students have been calling

for the same things: ethnic studies,
faculty of color, protection from dis
crimination, priority on teaching in
stead of research and more financial
aid, among others.
Many of today's students' demands
were first issued in 1968 by the Black
Student Union in the wake of Martin
Luther King, Jr.'s assassination. These
demands have been re-issued continu
ally throughout the 1970s and 1980s,
iiicy are not new and they are not
unreasonable. And yet our voice is
continually dismissed and ignored.
For example, MEChA has been
working for democratic governance of
El Centro Chicano all year long, pursu
ing this goal through numerous meet
ings with administrators. Their request
is simple: that the committees govern
ing the Chicano student center be
made up of students, staff and faculty
who are democratically elected, not
appointed by administrators.
Yet here we are in spring quarter,

and the administration still has not
made any commitment to remedying
this clearly unreasonable situation.
Why must change be so difficult 9 Why
must students spend hours upon hours
working for goals that are just, work
able and easy to implement?
Furthermore, much of the tension of
the day was brought on by the presi
dent's decision to call in the police to
arrest students immediately. He chose
to take this course instead of agreeing
to discuss issues with us and attempt
to resolve the situation.
This decision to arrest students
without negotiating on any of the
issues in the Agenda for Action further
illustrates their approach to students
— instead of asking themselves why 5C
students felt so frustrated with Univer
sity processes, administrative officials
quickly called in the riot police to
arrest and threaten us with felony
charges and expulsion.
This stands in sharp contrast to
schools across the country who have
responded to student takeovers with
negotiations, diplomacy and amnesty
for the students. Why must Stanford
be so unreasonable in contrast to other
universities?
Some have asked us why we took
the action when we did instead of
waiting for Kennedy's response to the
University Committee on Minority
Issues report. Yet the entire process of
dealing with UCMI has demonstrated
the lack of student input and democ
racy at this university.
After the release of the UCMI

report, the President's Office sought
out feedback from departments and
offices all over the University, but has
neglected to invite any student input
from the ASSU, resident assistants, |
advising associates, MEChA, the BSU,
the Asian-American Student Association
and the Stanford American Indian
Organization or any other student
group. Kennedy is setting his priorities
without asking students what our
priorities are!
In a university that values its
tuition-paying students, ignoring stu
dent priorities is absurd. Thus, we had
no reason to believe that Kennedy
would report he was implementing the
priorities of students. We sought to
make a difference in his report
beforehand. By sitting in, we feel that
we have let them know they must
listen to the student voice — we will
no longer be ignored.
But even then many would ask, why
sit in? Why not pursue other channels
before taking such a radical stand* 7 We•
chose to make a bold statement by
occupying Kennedy's office to express
the importance and urgency of our
demands.
The gesture symbolized students'
right to determine our education. We
have gone through the processes set
up by the administration for years
now, and have been met only with . ;
intransigence and excusospour frustra
tion at our treatment led us to such ao
action.

ON MONDAY, STANFORD stu
dents were arrested. The arrests
were the culmination of a day
when students had occupied University
President Donald Kennedy's office since
7:40 a.m. Others joined in the protest
by blocking the door when the police
tried to enter to arrest the occupying
students; and hundreds rallied outside
in support.
After the arrests, Stanford students
blocked the path of the bus that was
taking the students to jail by creating
a barricade of locked bikes, leaving
cars with deflated tires in the bus'
path and by surrounding the bus and
refusing to move. Others tried to block
cars taking students to jail, some
sitting in front of cars that drove
towards them.
Why did Stanford students take such
actions on this day? What drove stu
dents to actions so unusual for this
campus? Those of us who were ar
rested, those who sat in and those who
supported the sit-in had no desire to
jrejv.u >r isun, yon
campus.
We were driven to sit in at the
President's Office out of a deep anger
at the treatment of students on this
campus, particularly students of color.
For example, Asian-American students
have been working for years to start
tOv Asian-American Studies prograra
here. All year long they have been
circulating petitions, holding programs
and discussions, meeting with the
History Department, meeting with the
provost, gaining ASSU support.

They've done just about everything
they could have. And yet instead of a
commitment to hiring an Asian-
American Studies professor, what do
they encounter? The claim that Asian-
American Studies is not a "legitimate"
field of study because Asians have not
been in this country long enough.
Basically, they have received nothing
but a slap in the face for their sincere
and sorious efforts. After a year of
working through channels and outside
channels, all in the hope of securing
just and legitimate goals, and after
encountering nothing but intransigence
and excuses, we felt the need to take
dramatic action.
With only a few weeks left in the
ve«r and virtually nothing to* show for
our efforts of working vrrth the admirv
istration, we decided to take an action
that would demonstrate our serious
ness of purpose and elicit a serious
response.
