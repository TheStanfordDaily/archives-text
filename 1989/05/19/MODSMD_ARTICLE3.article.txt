# Condemning the protest
## 
### John Wagner Editorial staff 
Expressing concern for Stanford's
credibility, University President Donald
Kennedy yesterday publicly condemned the
actions of the student protesters who ille
gally occupied his office for nine hours
Monday.
Kennedy's condemnation, issued at the
Academic Council meeting and broadcast
over KZSU, followed his progress report
on the implementation of recommendations
made by the University Committee on Mi
nority Issues.
"I fear that the events of this week have
wrought heavy damage, and may have
rekindled doubts among our friends as to
whether we are a community dedicated to
rational process and deserving of their re
spect," Kennedy said.
"I think particularly of other institutions
that may have sought in us a model for

change, and may now wonder whether we
are worth following after all," he said.
Kennedy said the takeover surprised him
because it was disruptive to the UCMI
process — a process which he said "was
consensual and . . . deserved and enjoyed
general if not universal repect in the Stan
ford community."
Kennedy also said efforts at prosecution
of students under University and California
laws would continue. Investigations of pos
sible violations of the campus disruption
code in the Fundamental Standard were
launched following Monday's takeover of
Kennedy's office. In addition, each
protester has been charged with one count
of trespassing and four counts of unlawful
assembly.
Protesters are demanding that the Uni
versity drop all charges. But Kennedy said
yesterday that "whatever sanctions are
prescribed by outside laws and by
campus policies will proceed."
Stacey Leyton, a Council of
Presidents member and one of
those arrested Monday, told The
Daily that she thought Kennedy's
hard-line position was "insulting"
to the students who were strug
gling to improve the University.
"They're trying to scare
people," she said.
In his address, Kennedy also
commended the work of the police
involved in Monday's confronta
tion. "The decision to make ar
rests was not a matter of first,
but of last resort," he said. "The

Stanford police handled a very dif
ficult task with admirable
restraint and professionalism."
