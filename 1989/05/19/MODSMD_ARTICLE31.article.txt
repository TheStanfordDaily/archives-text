## Bug sheds light on sundial 
### Mark Smoyer Senior staff writer 
Occasionally events occur which
arouse in me the passion to cry
out, "This is a job for The Bug!"
What usually happens at this
point is that — to complete the
delusion that when I write this
dumb trash I really am a bug —
I leap into the nearest dumpster,
change into my Bug tights and
cape (a sequined B emblazoned
on my broad chest), and leap back
out, only to be mistaken for Jeff
Goldblum and mobbed by auto
graph hounds.

A totally boss combi
nation of form and
function, sort of
abstract but with clas
sical Roman
numerals, lots of
people will really dig
it.

Actually, what usually happens
at this point is that I retire to
my room and sit down to watch
UHF television.
Incidentally, as if my life isn't
already a living Chaos, my sister
is in town for a five-day stay.
Having recently finished her soph
omore year at Columbia, the bane
of my existence framed the dif
ference between going to school in
NYC and going to school at Stan
ford in this way:
"On the way to class in New
York, people on the streets are
always asking me for money.
Here, I feel like I should be the
one asking for money."
So far, she's managed to pan
handle about four dollars in
change.
.. .One more thing before we
get to some question answering:
I'm working on a "Where Are
They Now" column for one of the
upcoming weeks. Of the ex
celebrities for which I am search
ing, the mime duo Shields and
Yarnell has been the most difficult
to track down.
Any inforthation concerning
what these two might have been
up to since their show dropped
off the air in 1979 would be
greatly appreciated and ought to
be sent via Lots to B.bug-me or
dropped off in the Bug Me box
outside the Daily offices.

Dear Bug,
How do you read that sundial
thing hanging outside Terman?
— Louis XV
Read it any way you want. Un
less you get lucky it won't tell
you the time. Then again, the
same goes for the Clock Tower
clock, so try your luck.
The object of which you speak
does indeed lode like a sundial.
Right now, it's just a piece of art,
though. Located on the outside
wall of the Terman Engineering
building, facing Terman pond,
across from the Daily offices, on
the opposite end of campus from
Wilbur, south of San Francisco,
the fake sundial may be replaced
by a real sundial at some point
in the future.
Electrical Engineering Prof.
Ron Bracewell said he designed
the piece now on Terman as "a
mock-up to show the size, location
and color of a proposed (function
al) sundial."
According to Alette Farrell, the
School of Engineering's facilities
coordinator, the University's
Panel of Outdoor Art recently ap
proved the sculpture/time piece.
Bracewell's work now must be ap
proved by one more committee
and then receive funding before
it can become more than just a
"mock-up."
The chairman of The Bug's art
department says that if it's given
a chance, the sundial will reign
among the campus' finest artwork
— right up there with Rodin's
"Walking Man." A totally boss
combination of form and function,
sort of abstract but with classical
Roman numerals, lots of people
will really dig it.
I talked to Joe Bob Briggs about
the sundial, and he said, "Check
it out." Siskel and Ebert said,
"Thumbs down," which should be
further incentive.
Dear Bug,
I was wondering where the next
time capsule will go on the Quad.
Will it be straight, out towards
the outer Quad, or will it go
around the corner?
— Charles de Gaulle
This was actually one of the
first questions the Bug received
this academic year, but he decided
not to address' it until he really
needed a question that could be
answered with hardly any re
search. Also, with graduation but
a month away the question is a
little more topical now — not that
that's ever been a standard for
question answering before.

Two senior class presidents
were good enough to talk with
the Bug about this. Catherine
Jovicich and Dinesh Vazirani both
said the Capsule of the Class of
'89 will go around the corner of
the Inner Quad (which, inciden
tally, should always be stretched
before any exercise as it is ex
tremely susceptible to injury).

'Check it out.'
— Joe Bob Briggs

Both also said the senior class
presidents would be happy to hear
from classmates with suggestions
as to what should be stored in
the archives of '89. The capsule
is about the size of a shoe box
and its contents will be decided
upon in the next two'weeks. A
ceremony will be held during
Graduation Weekend when the
public may witness the capsule's
interment.
You're not going to believe this,
but The Bug has some sugges
tions on what oughta be in the
capsule:
A banana with one of those
"Let's Do Lunch" stickers on it;
a basketball commemorating this
year's Cardinal teams (preferably
deflated); a pack of Reed's root
beer suckers; some chalk; a pic
ture of Jerry Garcia (Dude, so
cool!); a little dish of ear wax and
toe jam; a chunk of concrete from
Roble (So totally symbolic, man!);
non-analgesic pain reliever; and
one of those award-winning Mit
subishi condoms (So sexually
liberated, camarado!).
Until next week, the Bug has
spoken (So what?).

According to Alette Farrell, the
School of Engineering's facilities
coordinator, the University's
Panel of Outdoor Art recently ap
proved the sculpture/time piece.
Bracewell's work now must be ap
proved by one more committee
and then receive funding before
it can become more than just a
"mock-up."
The chairman of The Bug's art
department says that if it's given
a chance, the sundial will reign
among the campus' finest artwork
— right up there with Rodin's
"Walking Man." A totally boss
combination of form and function,
sort of abstract but with classical
Roman numerals, lots of people
will really dig it.
I talked to Joe Bob Briggs about
the sundial, and he said, "Check
it out." Siskel and Ebert said,
"Thumbs down," which should be
further incentive.
Dear Bug,
I was wondering where the next
time capsule will go on the Quad.
Will it be straight, out towards
the outer Quad, or will it go
around the corner?
— Charles de Gaulle
This was actually one of the
first questions the Bug received
this academic year, but he decided
not to address' it until he really
needed a question that could be
answered with hardly any re
search. Also, with graduation but
a month away the question is a
little more topical now — not that
that's ever been a standard for
question answering before.

Two senior class presidents
were good enough to talk with
the Bug about this. Catherine
Jovicich and Dinesh Vazirani both
said the Capsule of the Class of
'89 will go around the corner of
the Inner Quad (which, inciden
tally, should always be stretched
before any exercise as it is ex
tremely susceptible to injury).

'Check it out.'
— Joe Bob Briggs

Both also said the senior class
presidents would be happy to hear
from classmates with suggestions
as to what should be stored in
the archives of '89. The capsule
is about the size of a shoe box
and its contents will be decided
upon in the next two'weeks. A
ceremony will be held during
Graduation Weekend when the
public may witness the capsule's
interment.
You're not going to believe this,
but The Bug has some sugges
tions on what oughta be in the
capsule:
A banana with one of those
"Let's Do Lunch" stickers on it;
a basketball commemorating this
year's Cardinal teams (preferably
deflated); a pack of Reed's root
beer suckers; some chalk; a pic
ture of Jerry Garcia (Dude, so
cool!); a little dish of ear wax and
toe jam; a chunk of concrete from
Roble (So totally symbolic, man!);
non-analgesic pain reliever; and
one of those award-winning Mit
subishi condoms (So sexually
liberated, camarado!).
Until next week, the Bug has
spoken (So what?).


Bug Me
Occasionally events occur which
arouse in me the passion to cry
out, "This is a job for The Bug!"
What usually happens at this
point is that — to complete the
delusion that when I write this
dumb trash I really am a bug —
I leap into the nearest dumpster,
change into my Bug tights and
cape (a sequined B emblazoned
on my broad chest), and leap back
out, only to be mistaken for Jeff
Goldblum and mobbed by auto
graph hounds.

A totally boss combi
nation of form and
function, sort of
abstract but with clas
sical Roman
numerals, lots of
people will really dig
it.

Actually, what usually happens
at this point is that I retire to
my room and sit down to watch
UHF television.
Incidentally, as if my life isn't
already a living Chaos, my sister
is in town for a five-day stay.
Having recently finished her soph
omore year at Columbia, the bane
of my existence framed the dif
ference between going to school in
NYC and going to school at Stan
ford in this way:
"On the way to class in New
York, people on the streets are
always asking me for money.
Here, I feel like I should be the
one asking for money."
So far, she's managed to pan
handle about four dollars in
change.
.. .One more thing before we
get to some question answering:
I'm working on a "Where Are
They Now" column for one of the
upcoming weeks. Of the ex
celebrities for which I am search
ing, the mime duo Shields and
Yarnell has been the most difficult
to track down.
Any inforthation concerning
what these two might have been
up to since their show dropped
off the air in 1979 would be
greatly appreciated and ought to
be sent via Lots to B.bug-me or
dropped off in the Bug Me box
outside the Daily offices.

Dear Bug,
How do you read that sundial
thing hanging outside Terman?
— Louis XV
Read it any way you want. Un
less you get lucky it won't tell
you the time. Then again, the
same goes for the Clock Tower
clock, so try your luck.
The object of which you speak
does indeed lode like a sundial.
Right now, it's just a piece of art,
though. Located on the outside
wall of the Terman Engineering
building, facing Terman pond,
across from the Daily offices, on
the opposite end of campus from
Wilbur, south of San Francisco,
the fake sundial may be replaced
by a real sundial at some point
in the future.
Electrical Engineering Prof.
Ron Bracewell said he designed
the piece now on Terman as "a
mock-up to show the size, location
and color of a proposed (function
al) sundial."
According to Alette Farrell, the
School of Engineering's facilities
coordinator, the University's
Panel of Outdoor Art recently ap
proved the sculpture/time piece.
