# Scaring people into safe sex
## Senior reaches out with AIDS education in local schools 
### Nathanael Cousins Staff writer 
When Stanford senior Chris
Hunt visits local high schools,
his intent is to scare the stu
dents. But he doesn't need to
wear a Halloween horror mask
or carry a gun.
Hunt is armed with informa
tion and statistics about Ac
quired Immune Deficiency
Syndrome. He directs the Stan
ford AIDS Educational Out
reach Program, a program he
started last spring after par
ticipating in Human Biology
142, "The Impact of AIDS."
"My first goal is to scare
them," said Hunt, who directs
more than 20 volunteers in the
local outreach program to junior
high schools, high schools and
Stanford residences.
"There is no cure to AIDS
and there isn't one seen in the
near future. If you get the HIV
virus, you're in big trouble.
Some scientists believe it is 100
percent deadly," Hunt said.
Hunt runs the program out
of his room in Schiff House, and
although he has been offered
payment from some high schools
and hard-to-find office space
from the University, he prefers
to keep the organization low
profile and all-volunteer.
"Chris does an incredible job,"
said Bob Siegel, Hunt's instruc
tor in Human Biology 142. "He
is not the kind of person who
takes too much credit for any
thing, but I have a lot of respect
for all the things he has done.
There are a lot of demands on
undergraduates.
"Chris has made this program
possible through an outburst of
energy," Siegel said.
Although Siegel directs all the
credit to Hunt, the idea for the
outreach program came from
Siegel's AIDS class, which Hunt
took last spring. As part of the
class requirement, students had
to participate in an additional
workshop or speak to students
at local schools.
However, Hunt did not think
the outreach should end when
the class did.
"We got such positive feed
back from the class I thought
it would be a real shame if it
didn't keep going," Hunt ex
plains. He spoke to his Human
Biology classmates about con
tinuing the work, and the pro

gram was bornV
"He expanded \t way beyond
class, and the program has been
a fabulous success," Siegel said.
"The schools have been very
pleased and keep asking him to
come back."
Hunt estimated that since the
program started this year his
group has given 50 presenta
tions, which usually last about
50 minutes. Most presentations
are given at health or biology
classes in high schools like
Woodside or Menlo, although
Hunt said he has also spoken to
eighth graders.

Hunt said he hopes that the
program can expand to more
freshman dorms next year. This
year volunteers spoke in Don
ner, Gavilan and Larkin
Houses.
Some schools, such as Palo
Alto High School, already have
comprehensive AIDS education
programs and say they do not
need his services. But more of
ten, Hunt is filling an educa
tional void. AIDS education is
a rapidly changing field, and
most public school teachers have
little background, he said.
"Having had an entire course
on AIDS, we know more than
any public school teacher," said
Hunt. "I always ask a few ques
tions at the beginning to see
how much the audience knows,
and often the teachers are
wrong."
Siegel said the the students
have had more than 40 hours
of training on the subject. "Plus,
they are Stanford students so
they are very articulate, and

they are close in age to the high
school students, which makes for
good teaching," he added.
Hunt said he has had little
problem with the explicit nature
of the presentations. Because of
the mature subject matter, par
ents must first give written per
mission for their son or
daughter to participate in the
outreach program.
"We tell them what is safe,
what isn't safe, and what might
be unsafe. We definitely tell
them that abstinence is the
safest thing," Hunt said.
Reactions to Hunt's presenta
tions have taught him more
about the subject. Many stu
dents presume he is gay, al
though he doesn't address that
issue in his presentations and
is in fact heterosexual. "I always
stress that AIDS is not a gay
disease. Any sex is a risk at
some level," Hunt said.
He said he has been impressed
by the general knowledge of stu
dents. "The public knows a heck
of a lot. I was impressed that
the eighth graders knew so
much," he said.
However, Hunt added, "This
affluent area is not representa
tive of the nation as a whole.
The people who need informa
tion the most — prostitutes and
IV drug users — still are uned
ucated."
Hunt said he fields a wide
range of questions at the out
reaches from "Can I get AIDS
from kissing?" to "How long will
it be until we find a cure?" He
said he tries to create an open
atmosphere.
Hunt said that there has been
some concern that the Stanford
AIDS Educational Outreach
Program, which is independent
from other campus groups,
might overlap with programs
put on by the Lesbian, Gay and
Bisexual Community Center.
But he said the two groups have
worked well together, and that
his organization has focused on
local schools, while the LGBCC
concentrates more on campus.
Hunt is graduating this spring
and moving on to medical school
at Vanderbilt University or UC-
San Diego, but he is confident
that the program will survive
and grow in scope. "It has gone
pretty smoothly. I just wish I
had more time to work on the
project," Hunt concluded.

and often the teachers are
wrong."
Siegel said the the students
have had more than 40 hours
of training on the subject. "Plus,
they are Stanford students so
they are very articulate, and

they are close in age to the high
school students, which makes for
good teaching," he added.
Hunt said he has had little
problem with the explicit nature
of the presentations. Because of
the mature subject matter, par
ents must first give written per
mission for their son or
daughter to participate in the
outreach program.
"We tell them what is safe,
what isn't safe, and what might
be unsafe. We definitely tell
them that abstinence is the
safest thing," Hunt said.
Reactions to Hunt's presenta
tions have taught him more
about the subject. Many stu
dents presume he is gay, al
though he doesn't address that
issue in his presentations and
is in fact heterosexual. "I always
stress that AIDS is not a gay
disease. Any sex is a risk at
some level," Hunt said.
He said he has been impressed
by the general knowledge of stu
dents. "The public knows a heck
of a lot. I was impressed that
the eighth graders knew so
much," he said.
However, Hunt added, "This
affluent area is not representa
tive of the nation as a whole.
The people who need informa
tion the most — prostitutes and
IV drug users — still are uned
ucated."
Hunt said he fields a wide
range of questions at the out
reaches from "Can I get AIDS
from kissing?" to "How long will
it be until we find a cure?" He
said he tries to create an open
atmosphere.
Hunt said that there has been
some concern that the Stanford
AIDS Educational Outreach
Program, which is independent
from other campus groups,
might overlap with programs
put on by the Lesbian, Gay and
Bisexual Community Center.
But he said the two groups have
worked well together, and that
his organization has focused on
local schools, while the LGBCC
concentrates more on campus.
Hunt is graduating this spring
and moving on to medical school
at Vanderbilt University or UC-
San Diego, but he is confident
that the program will survive
and grow in scope. "It has gone
pretty smoothly. I just wish I
had more time to work on the
project," Hunt concluded.


Chris Hunt
When Stanford senior Chris
Hunt visits local high schools,
his intent is to scare the stu
dents. But he doesn't need to
wear a Halloween horror mask
or carry a gun.
Hunt is armed with informa
tion and statistics about Ac
quired Immune Deficiency
Syndrome. He directs the Stan
ford AIDS Educational Out
reach Program, a program he
started last spring after par
ticipating in Human Biology
142, "The Impact of AIDS."
"My first goal is to scare
them," said Hunt, who directs
more than 20 volunteers in the
local outreach program to junior
high schools, high schools and
Stanford residences.
"There is no cure to AIDS
and there isn't one seen in the
near future. If you get the HIV
virus, you're in big trouble.
Some scientists believe it is 100
percent deadly," Hunt said.
Hunt runs the program out
of his room in Schiff House, and
although he has been offered
payment from some high schools
and hard-to-find office space
from the University, he prefers
to keep the organization low
profile and all-volunteer.
"Chris does an incredible job,"
said Bob Siegel, Hunt's instruc
tor in Human Biology 142. "He
is not the kind of person who
takes too much credit for any
thing, but I have a lot of respect
for all the things he has done.
There are a lot of demands on
undergraduates.
"Chris has made this program
possible through an outburst of
energy," Siegel said.
Although Siegel directs all the
credit to Hunt, the idea for the
outreach program came from
Siegel's AIDS class, which Hunt
took last spring. As part of the
class requirement, students had
to participate in an additional
workshop or speak to students
at local schools.
However, Hunt did not think
the outreach should end when
the class did.
"We got such positive feed
back from the class I thought
it would be a real shame if it
didn't keep going," Hunt ex
plains. He spoke to his Human
Biology classmates about con
tinuing the work, and the pro

gram was bornV
"He expanded \t way beyond
class, and the program has been
a fabulous success," Siegel said.
"The schools have been very
pleased and keep asking him to
come back."
Hunt estimated that since the
program started this year his
group has given 50 presenta
tions, which usually last about
50 minutes. Most presentations
are given at health or biology
classes in high schools like
Woodside or Menlo, although
Hunt said he has also spoken to
eighth graders.

Hunt said he hopes that the
program can expand to more
freshman dorms next year. This
year volunteers spoke in Don
ner, Gavilan and Larkin
Houses.
Some schools, such as Palo
Alto High School, already have
comprehensive AIDS education
programs and say they do not
need his services. But more of
ten, Hunt is filling an educa
tional void. AIDS education is
a rapidly changing field, and
most public school teachers have
little background, he said.
"Having had an entire course
on AIDS, we know more than
any public school teacher," said
Hunt. "I always ask a few ques
tions at the beginning to see
how much the audience knows,
and often the teachers are
wrong."
Siegel said the the students
have had more than 40 hours
of training on the subject. "Plus,
they are Stanford students so
they are very articulate, and
