## Identical twins identify own identities

Is two always better than one?
According to two sets of identi
cal twins at Stanford it definitely
is.
College is often considered a
time to forge one's own identity.
And, while the presence of an
identical twin might be considered
a hindrance to this goal, twins at
Stanford say they do not find
their siblings to be formidable ob
stacles to establishing in
dividuality.
According to senior Andrea
Ruman, an identical twin, the
Stanford campus is big enough to
allow both twins to develop inde
pendently and establish individual
sets of friends. Yet, the commu
nity is still small enough to enable
twins to see each other walking
around campus, she adds.
Establishing independence is a
multi-step process. "By making
our own friends and surrounding
ourselves with individuals who
know us, pursuing different dis
ciplines and never living together,
we have been able to establish our
own identities," Andrea says.
Her identical twin sister Angela
agrees, adding that having a twin
"doe* make it harder to establish
yourself as an individual, but

(nevertheless) it's an experience
that's very special."
Andrea says people often don't
understand the genetics of twins,
and believe they have special men
tal abilities. She says the most
common question she is asked is
whether she and her twin share
extra-sensory abilities.
"The e.s.p. idea is almost a joke.
If you live with someone a long
time, you can finish their sentence
(before they do) too," Andrea says.
People believe twins have special
powers because they "only read
about bizarre twins," she adds.
Identical twin Mark Mastalir, a
junior, says he has experienced
similar incidents in which people
expected him to be able to relate
with his brother more than reg
ular siblings do.
"We're like regular brothers,
not really closer than other broth
ers," he says."(We both) run track
and in training help each other,
but if in a meet, one does well
and the other doesn't, (people) ask
us to have reasons why.
"We don't have more insight
into the other sibling (just because
we're twins)."
Mark's twin brother Eric says
he has also found that people ex
pect more of twins than other
individuals. People assume that
because he is a twin, he should

be able to tell other twins apart,
he says.
Eric has identical twin friends
from high school who also attend
Stanford. "This is the first year
I can tell them apart, and I've
known them for eight years," he
says.
Eric and Mark both drew into
the same house this year, and last
year they lived together in the
suites. They also share a lot of
the same friends. While their close
friends have little trouble telling
them apart, other friends some
times do, Mark says.
People often mistake him for
Eric, Mark adds. "I talk to them
as if I'm Eric sometimes, and I
never correct them," he says. "It's
too much of a hassle, and I don't
want to burst their bubble."
It can be difficult to tell twins
apart on their college applications
as well.
According to Assoc. Dean of
Undergraduate Admissions John
Bunnell, when Stanford receives
applications from twins, the ad
missions office marks on each
folder that other members of the
family are applying and then tries
to review the two together.
"We look at each (twin) as an
individual. Twins have been split
up, but 70 to 80 percent of the

time they are almost identical in
grades, scores, interests and rec
ommendations, so splitting them
up is usually the exception," Bun
nell said.
Both the Rumans and Mastalirs
affirm that they share many of
the same interests.
Angela and Andrea were both
involved in the production of "A
Chorus Line" and are human bi
ology majors. However, Angela
says she hopes to become a clinical
psychologist while her sister plans
to go on to medical school.
According to Andrea, the large
number of interests she and An
gela share is a result of their
upbringing rather than genetic
make-up. "Our parents instilled
similar values (in us) and exposed
us to similar interests."
Mark and Eric also have similar
political, academic and extra
curricular interests. Both run
track and cross-country. Mark is
majoring in history, and his
brother is majoring in philosophy
and will also major in history.
"Our abilities are basically the
same," Eric says.
However, he adds that Mark
will probably serve as his advisor
in classes and concentration next
year since he has completed many
of the history classes.
