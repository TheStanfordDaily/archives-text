# This week in Stanford history

### 
Editor'B Note: The Features De
partment apologizes for any
undue stress which the absence
of TWISH caused our loyal
readers this week. Here it is,
four days late, yet infinitely
more comprehensive than it
would have been on Monday or
Tuesday. Thank you for your
support.
May 16, 1955
The Stanford Daily
The installation of small blue
and white "Air Raid Instruc
tions" signs marked the coming
of the Cold War to the Stanford
Quad.
The instructions, issued by
the Civil Defense Committee,
recommended that in the event
of an enemy air attack upon
the Stanford campus, students
should: "Drop to floor. Bury
face in arms."
However, Stanford Fire
Chief John Marston said that
in case of an air attack, "I'd
run, brother. Just run for cov
er."
A diagram of the radius of
an H-Bomb's fireball super
imposed over a cross section of
the Stanford campus accompa
nied the story on the new signs
in The Daily and illustrated the
irony of these instructions.
Using Hoover Tower as
ground zero for such an attack,
the diagram showed that the
blast area of complete destruc
tion would extend well into the
surrounding community of
Palo Alto.
TWISH's recommendation
for dealing with such an attack:
Put on some suntan lotion and
join the sunbathers on Wilbur
Field.
May 16-17, 1967
The Stanford Daily
A four to five-foot alligator
observed in Lake Lagunita was
dubbed the Lag Mess Monster
by students.
The monster was suspected

to be "Sam," an alligator kid
napped by Foothill College stu
dents from the outdoor biology
lab at Fremont High School in
Sunnyvale. Fremont science
teacher Frank Robinson organ
ized a search party to attempt
to capture Sam with nets and
ropes later in the week.
According to Robinson, "Sam
is not at all vicious and has
never bitten anybody."
However, a Stanford
lifeguard who spotted the alli
gator in question in the murky
depths of Lake Lag (back when
Lake Lag had depths to be
murky), said, "It was horrible
and big and slimy and . . . Oh,
it was horrible. I can't think
about it. Don't ask me about
it. Aaauuughhh!"
May 13, 1970
The Stanford Daily
Attempts by about 50 stu
dents to blockade the
Electronics Research Labora
tory and the on-campus ROTC
building prompted University
officials to declare that such
blockades violated the campus
disruption policy and would
result in the immediate suspen
sion of the participants.
On campuses around the
country, students demonstra
ted and refused to attend
classes in continued protests
against the spread of the Viet
nam War into Cambodia and
the deaths of four Kent State
University students killed by
National Guardsmen during an
anti-war protest.
The administration asked
student protesters to turn
themselves in to the Student
Judicial Council to be charged
for their actions. Administra
tors also studied photographs
of the blockades to determine
the identities of student pro
testers who refused to identify
themselves to University offi
cials.
