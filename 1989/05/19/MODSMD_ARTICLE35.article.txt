## Birch wins NCAA singles title Bid to be first-ever triple champion falls short in doubles final 
### Mark Rogowsky Editorial staff 
Sandra Birch knocked on the Door
of Tennis History last night.
The Door cracked open and she got
one foot inside — besting Southern
Methodist's Jennifer Santrock 6-3, 6-3
to capture the NCAA Women's Tennis
Championships individual singles title.
Then, while savoring the moment of
her great triumph, the Door closed and
the voice of History called out: "Not
this time." With that, Birch and partner
Debbie Graham were defeated in the
doubles final by Mississippi State's Jane
Holden and Claire Pollard 6-3, 7-6 (7-5).
That means for at least one more
year no one can claim to have won the
team, singles and doubles titles in the
same year.
"This was the icing (on the cake),"
Birch said of her singles title. "I think
the team title is the highlight."
The singles final opened with both
players feeling each other out. With
Birch serving the first game, neither
player went all out with their shots.
But the wily SMU senior gave notice
that she was not going to play her tradi
tional baseline game. Santrock planned
on being aggressive and coming to the
net often.
Santrock got a break point, but Birch
saved it and held on to win the game
and take a 1-0 lead. Santrock then
served a love game and began to estab
lish some solid serve-and-volley play.
An undaunted Birch — who felt pain
on every serve from a strained stomach
muscle — served a love game of her
own. She followed that up with four
straight points off Santrock's serve to
break her and take a 3-1 lead.
Santrock broke Birch back, however,
and then held her serve to draw even.
Continuing to play aggressively at the

net, it seemed the momentum might be
in her favor. But it wasn't. Birch held
serve, took a 4-3 lead and never trailed
again.
She broke Santrock and held her own
serve to win the set 6-3. Santrock was
clearly rattled as Birch began to get
more aggressive herself. Santrock began
to make a number of unforced errors
and Birch appeared able to put the pain
in the back of her mind.
In the second set, Birch took charge
and Santrock crumbled. Santrock
opened up a 40-15 lead on her serve.
Then she went for a winner and missed
it. She had an easy putaway on a short
ball and missed it. She netted a forehand
for no apparent reason. And she made
yet another unforced error to hand the
game to Birch.
Birch led 30-15 in the next game when
she came up with a sensational cross
court forehand into the corner. It was
one of several back-breaking shots Birch
came up with that clearly had an effect
on Santrock's spirit.
Birch held and took a 3-0 lead in the
set by picking up another break of
Santrock's serve. A young gentleman in
the crowd remarked, "I'd hate to see
her when she's healthy."
Still, Santrock had a bit of fight left
in her. She broke Birch back and held
on to pull close at 3-2.
Birch found enough on her serve to
follow it in and grab a 15-0 lead in the
sixth game of the set. "In the end of
the second set, I played some tough
games," Birch said. "I was very aggres
sive."
Her powerful play was too much for
Santrock, who made a major error on
the next point to move the lead to 30-0.
Birch ripped off a magnificent backhand
passing shot and won the next point by
following in a great serve. That gave
the Stanford sophomore a 4-2 lead.

Sandra Birch's road to
the NCAA Singles Title:
d. Alysia May, UCLA, 6-2, 6-3
d. Mary Beth Young, BYU, 6-2, 6-3
d. Nicole Arendt, Florida, 6-2, 7-6 (9-7)
d. G. Helgeson, Pepperdine, 6-2, 7-6
d. Lisa Green, Stanford, 6-4, 6-2
d. Jennifer Santrock, SMU, 6-3, 6-3

"Maybe she felt like she had to do a
little too much," Birch said of Santrock.
Santrock agreed. "I went for too many
shots," she said.
"She's the smartest player I've played
fill year," Santrock continued. "When
she was down, she'd hit winners, when
she was behind, she'd just push the
ball."
Santrock managed to hold serve and
pull to 4-3, but wouldn't win another
game. Birch served a love game and
needed only five points to break
Santrock for the match.
In Birch's 6-3, 6-3 win she made just
11 unforced errors while coming up with
13 outright winners, according to sta
tistics compiled by Leo Levin of Infor
mation and Display Systems, Inc.
Santrock, on the other hand, had 25
winners but a whopping 45 unforced
errors. She could convert but two of
her six break points while Birch con
verted five of the six she had.
In the doubles final, Holden and Pol
lard broke Birch's serve in the first
game and the Stanford duo eventually
returned the favor in the set's fourth
game.
At 2-2, however, the Bulldogs broke
Birch again and then Holden held. There
were no more breaks in the first set as


Michael Topdlovac—Daily
Sophomore Sandra Birch complemented Stanford's fourth consecutive tearh title by
winning the 1989 individual title yesterday, defeating Jennifer Santrock of SMU 6-3,
6-3.
Holden and Pollard took it 6-3.
The second set was entirely free
of service breaks and wound up
in a tiebreaker. Neither side could
draw any advantage until the Mis
sissippi State team pulled ahead
5-2 by taking both points off
Birch's serve.

The Cardinal, who never quite
got on track, got tough and
knotted it at 5-5. It appeared as
though they just might pull out
the set.
But on Graham's last serve,
Holden hit a winner to give her
team a match point. Pollard con
verted.
History would have its way in
1989, but Sandra Birch was the
NCAA champion and no one could
take that away.
