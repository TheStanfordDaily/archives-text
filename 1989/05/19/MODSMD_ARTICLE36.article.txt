# Men's tennis invades Athens as the No. 1 seed
## 
### Cameron Macky Senior staff writer 
For the first time all season, the rest of
the collegiate tennis world is looking up at
•the Stanford men's tennis team. For what
ever that's worth.
Stanford started 1989 ranked second in
the country before falling as low as sixth
in the middle of April. Since then the team
has slowly worked its way up to No. 2 in
the rankings, and has been seeded first in
the 105 th NCAA Championships, which
begin today in Athens, Ga.
The Cardinal will open tournament play
tomorrow at 8 a.m. against the winner of
today's Miami (Fla.)-Mississippi match.
And, while being seeded first is a nice
compliment, being the top team in the coun
try a week before the season is over isn't
worth much of anything. The only rankings
that matter will come out when the tour
nament is over.
Stanford Coach Dick Gould and Co. are
taking nothing for granted. "Right now,
the most important match of the year is
against either Miami or Mississippi," Gould
said.
As for the No. 1 seeding, Gould still isn't
sure his team is deserving (and, even if he
was, he certainly wouldn't say so). "We're
not a great team," Gould said, sticking to
the path of caution he has followed all

season. "Of course, we're not a bad
team. . . The team does legitimately have
a chance of winning the title." Way to go
out on a limb, coach.
If the Cardinal wins its first two matches
to advance to the semifinals, odds are it
will face either California or South
Carolina. And, if history is any indication,
a potential California-Stanford rematch will
be decided by the doubles contests — which
could spell trouble for the Cardinal.
"Our Achilles' heel is definitely doubles,"
Gould said. "We can't win without taking
two of the three doubles matches," which
is something Stanford hasn't done in its
first two 1989 meetings with the Bears.
The one benefit of the top seeding for
the Cardinal is that all four teams that
have beaten Stanford this season — Ken
tucky, Georgia, UCLA and USC — are in
the other half of the draw.
"That's nice, but there are some teams
in our half who can beat us too," Gould
said.
True, but they'll have to beat a squad
that will be running on all cylinders for
the first time this season. "Health-wise,
we're in as good a shape as we've been all
year," Gould said.
Jeff Catnrall is apparently recovered
from a sprained left wrist. He practiced all

week without having the wrist
wrapped, which means that Stan
ford's No. 2 singles player will be
healthy for the first time since
April 11.
As for the rest of the team,
Glenn Solomon has gotten over
both the flu and a minor back
ir\jury, and Alex O'Brien's shoul
der has improved so much that
"he's been serving bombs," ac
cording to Gould.
With everyone healthy, the Car
dinal does indeed have a
"legitimate" shot at Stanford's
sixth NCAA title of the decade.
"If we can keep our minds focused
on the present, and not look ahead
to the next match, we'll do well,"
Gould said.
Card note
After the team competition ends on
Tuesday, the individual singles and
doubles tournaments will begin. How
ever, those tourneys won't exactly be
a showcase for the Cardinal — there
is only one Stanford entrant in each
category.
