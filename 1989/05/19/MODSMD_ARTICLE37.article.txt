# Tarango entertains crowds with self-taunts and tennis
## 
### Cameron Macky Senior staff writer 
No matter how the Stanford men's
tennis team fares at the NCAA Cham
pionships, which begin today in Ath
ens, Ga., junior co-captain Jeff
Tarango's matches will be among the
most entertaining of the tourney. The
actual tennis should be pretty good,
too.
Tarango, who for the past three
years has built up a reputation as one
of the most exciting players in the
country, is trying to cap off his final
year at Stanford with a second
straight NCAA title for the school.
And, as usual, he'll be going about it
in a quite demonstrative fashion.
Actually, "demonstrative" doesn't
really do justice to the performance
Tarango puts on. His matches are a
showcase for his incredible talent, in
tense competitiveness and his self
scathing wit.
"1 just try to make things a little
more entertaining," Tarango says. "1
don't think tennis is always exciting,
especially college tennis, so I do what
I can to make it more interesting."
He certainly does. For those of you
who haven't seen (or heard) Tarango
play this year, here are a few exam
ples. From the home office in Agana,
Guam, this week's Top Ten List, the
top ten things Jeff Tarango has said
to himself when he's been disgusted
with the way he's playing:
10. "Oh, these are beautiful points!
Great tennis!!"

9. "Don't stand up on that shot!
"kntown that since setebfld
grade!"
8. "Great. Turn pro with that!"
7. "Monkey see, monkey do."
6. "Hit the damn thing in!"
5. "Can I double fault again?
Maybe?"
4. "Hello, McFly!"
3. "Was that a good shot?"
2. "Where'd you get your brain, K-
Mart?"
And, of course, the No. 1 phrase
Tarango yells at himself, the ever
popular:
"I'm wrestling with a snake!"
Not all the comments are sponta
neous. "The things 1 say that are fun
ny, I tend to think out more," Tarango
says."It depends on the situation. My
mind thinks a lot quicker when I'm
out on the court. I'm hyper, my mind's
racing. . . . Sometimes, if I don't think
enough, things may come out wrong."
Things "coming out wrong," along
with Tarango's tendency to question
calls and throw the occasional racket
to the ground, have contributed to
the perception that he is a spoiled
brat, which isn't entirely fair. One
man's complaining is another's com
petitiveness; intensity as much as im
maturity leads to thrown rackets.
In fact, no one who talks to Tarango
off the court has any reason to think
that he's something other than ma
ture, polite and friendly.
On the court? Well, Tarango feels
that he was quite the brat when he
was playing junior tennis, but times

have changed. "I've changed. . . . I was
more bratty and self-ceflWfM h W
juniors, in it for myself," he says.
"I've become a lot more personable,
and much more team-oriented.
"I've also tried to be more enter
taining. What it comes down to is
that I'm trying to be a better person
for the crowd, instead of better for
myself." i
No one who sees Tarango play,
though, is likely to let his "entertain
ing" overshadow the real reason
everyone comes to watch. When
Tarango's game is on, his array of
shots is on a level with anyone in
collegiate tennis. After last summer,
which he spent playing on the pro
circuit, Tarango was the top-ranked
amateur player in the world.
Early 1989 wasn't as kind. Tarango
struggled early in the season because
of an injury to his left wrist. The pain
kept him out of several matches, and
the missed time took something off
his game. He's been on a roll for the
last month, though, winning the last
eight of his dual-match contests.
"My wrist feels really good,"
Tarango said. "I'm getting better and
better each match. We'll just have to
see what happens."
The one thing that will definitely
happen is that Tarango will turn pro
after this year's NCAA tourney. "I
feel that this is the career I want to
dcj, so I should do it now," he says.
"A lot of people, especially in liberal

arts, really don't know what they
want to do, career-wise. I'm lucky,
because I know."
Not that he hasn't questioned
the decision, which he made after
his phenomenal summer on the
tour. "I've had a lot of second
thoughts about it,"he says. "Es
pecially when I was hurt. I won
dered if it was smart to turn [pro]
while I was hurting.
"I think about it all the time,
about leaving Stanford, but this
is what I want to do. I can always
get an education when I come
back."
He has some business to attend
to first, as the Cardinal begins its
title defense tomorrow. "The way
guys have been playing, it's going
to be hard for us to lose,"
says. "I'm not saying we definitely
will win, though. With (Stan
ford's) women, you can say 1 Yes,
they're going to win, ' but with
us you have to predict and hope.
Every day, it's going to be a cliff
hanger."

neous. "The things 1 say that are fun
ny, I tend to think out more," Tarango
says."It depends on the situation. My
mind thinks a lot quicker when I'm
out on the court. I'm hyper, my mind's
racing. . . . Sometimes, if I don't think
enough, things may come out wrong."
Things "coming out wrong," along
with Tarango's tendency to question
calls and throw the occasional racket
to the ground, have contributed to
the perception that he is a spoiled
brat, which isn't entirely fair. One
man's complaining is another's com
petitiveness; intensity as much as im
maturity leads to thrown rackets.
In fact, no one who talks to Tarango
off the court has any reason to think
that he's something other than ma
ture, polite and friendly.
On the court? Well, Tarango feels
that he was quite the brat when he
was playing junior tennis, but times

have changed. "I've changed. . . . I was
more bratty and self-ceflWfM h W
juniors, in it for myself," he says.
"I've become a lot more personable,
and much more team-oriented.
"I've also tried to be more enter
taining. What it comes down to is
that I'm trying to be a better person
for the crowd, instead of better for
myself." i
No one who sees Tarango play,
though, is likely to let his "entertain
ing" overshadow the real reason
everyone comes to watch. When
Tarango's game is on, his array of
shots is on a level with anyone in
collegiate tennis. After last summer,
which he spent playing on the pro
circuit, Tarango was the top-ranked
amateur player in the world.
Early 1989 wasn't as kind. Tarango
struggled early in the season because
of an injury to his left wrist. The pain
kept him out of several matches, and
the missed time took something off
his game. He's been on a roll for the
last month, though, winning the last
eight of his dual-match contests.
"My wrist feels really good,"
Tarango said. "I'm getting better and
better each match. We'll just have to
see what happens."
The one thing that will definitely
happen is that Tarango will turn pro
after this year's NCAA tourney. "I
feel that this is the career I want to
dcj, so I should do it now," he says.
"A lot of people, especially in liberal

arts, really don't know what they
want to do, career-wise. I'm lucky,
because I know."
Not that he hasn't questioned
the decision, which he made after
his phenomenal summer on the
tour. "I've had a lot of second
thoughts about it,"he says. "Es
pecially when I was hurt. I won
dered if it was smart to turn [pro]
while I was hurting.
"I think about it all the time,
about leaving Stanford, but this
is what I want to do. I can always
get an education when I come
back."
He has some business to attend
to first, as the Cardinal begins its
title defense tomorrow. "The way
guys have been playing, it's going
to be hard for us to lose,"
says. "I'm not saying we definitely
will win, though. With (Stan
ford's) women, you can say 1 Yes,
they're going to win, ' but with
us you have to predict and hope.
Every day, it's going to be a cliff
hanger."
No matter how the Stanford men's
tennis team fares at the NCAA Cham
pionships, which begin today in Ath
ens, Ga., junior co-captain Jeff
Tarango's matches will be among the
most entertaining of the tourney. The
actual tennis should be pretty good,
too.
Tarango, who for the past three
years has built up a reputation as one
of the most exciting players in the
country, is trying to cap off his final
year at Stanford with a second
straight NCAA title for the school.
And, as usual, he'll be going about it
in a quite demonstrative fashion.
Actually, "demonstrative" doesn't
really do justice to the performance
Tarango puts on. His matches are a
showcase for his incredible talent, in
tense competitiveness and his self
scathing wit.
"1 just try to make things a little
more entertaining," Tarango says. "1
don't think tennis is always exciting,
especially college tennis, so I do what
I can to make it more interesting."
He certainly does. For those of you
who haven't seen (or heard) Tarango
play this year, here are a few exam
ples. From the home office in Agana,
Guam, this week's Top Ten List, the
top ten things Jeff Tarango has said
to himself when he's been disgusted
with the way he's playing:
10. "Oh, these are beautiful points!
Great tennis!!"

9. "Don't stand up on that shot!
"kntown that since setebfld
grade!"
8. "Great. Turn pro with that!"
7. "Monkey see, monkey do."
6. "Hit the damn thing in!"
5. "Can I double fault again?
Maybe?"
4. "Hello, McFly!"
3. "Was that a good shot?"
2. "Where'd you get your brain, K-
Mart?"
And, of course, the No. 1 phrase
Tarango yells at himself, the ever
popular:
"I'm wrestling with a snake!"
Not all the comments are sponta
neous. "The things 1 say that are fun
ny, I tend to think out more," Tarango
says."It depends on the situation. My
