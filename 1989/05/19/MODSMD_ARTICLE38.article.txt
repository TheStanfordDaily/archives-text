They are invading Stanford
Stadium this weekend.
The fastest. The strongest.
The most agile.
Indeed, the Great Wes
tern/Pacific 10 Conference Track
and Field Championships this
Saturday and Sunday at Stan
ford Stadium will feature the
best of the best.
Reputed to be the top col
legiate track and field conference
in the nation, the Pac-10 boasts
No. 1-ranked and two-time
defending NCAA champion
UCLA, national powerhouse
Oregon, and, of course, Stanford
and California. In addition, the
Pac-10 produced more Olym
pians in 1988 than any other
conference. Saturday's field in
cludes such famed athletes as
UCLA's Steve Lewis, the 1988
Olympic 400-meter gold
medalist.

"There is not another meet in
the country like this one, except
maybe the NCAAs and the
Olympic Trials," Stanford Asst.
Coach Scott Chisam said. "There
are probably only one or two
nations that scored more points
in the Olympics last year than
our conference. And with the
weather like it is in the Bay
Area, it is undoubtedly going to
be a super weekend."
Stanford, although not ex
pected to win either the men's
or women's team competition,
showcases some exceptional ath
letes who hope to pick up titles
in several events.
On the women's side, Cardinal
hopes lie primarily with fresh
man sprinter Chryste Gaines
and senior Patty Purpur. Gaines
is favored in the 100 meters. She
will run in the 200 meters and
the sprint relay as well. Gaines
said she will use the qualifying
and final events on Saturday and
Sunday afternoon as an oppor

tunity to qualify for the NCAA
nationals later this month.
Purpur, who has already qual
ified for nationals in both the
shot put and discus, undoubtedly
will be a meyor scorer for the
Cardinal. The women's shot put
competition is scheduled for Sat
urday afternoon, while the dis
cus will be held Sunday.
"Everybody on the team has
to think in terms of personal
goals," Purpur said. "If we start
to think about who else is there,
that's when we start to get in
trouble. ... What I have to do
is just go in there and do the
best I can."
Freshman Jodie Bilotta and
sophomore Melanie Bloch also
have an opportunity to score in
the 1,500 and 3,000 meters,
respectively.
Peggy Odita, a national
qualifier in the heptathlon, will
try to garner a few more points
for the Cardinal in the high
jump. Odita took third last Tues

day in the heptathlon.
National qualifier Erica
Wheeler, on the other hand, will
try to outhurl No. 1 seed Jill
Smith of Oregon in the javelin
Saturday night.
Freshman Jackie Edwards
and junior Venessa Henlon
round out the group of highly
seeded Cardinal women. Each is
expected to long jump on Satur
day and triple jump on Sunday.
On the men's side, several ath
letes should shine. Sophomores
Dave Strang and Chris Rae will
try to score in the 800 meters.
At the moment, Strang has the
third-best time going into the
qualifying races on Saturday.
Sophomore Jim Cramton
stands as one of the favorites in
the 400 meters, while Bill
Crowley is the featured Cardinal
in the 1,500 meters.
Senior Glenn Schneider is ex
pected to score in the discus Sun
day, while juniors Brian Boggess
and Andy Papathanassiou high
light Cardinal hopes in the shot
put Saturday.
The 110-meter hurdles show
cases junior Peter Kolotouros. In
the long jump, sophomore Marcus
Hickerson is seeded fourth, while
senior Henry Green hopes to excel
in his last showing as a Cardinal
triple jumper.
The "splash brothers," Jason
Martin and Steve Miller, plan to
cross the finish line dry after Sat

urday's 3,000-meter steeplechase,
and John Hopkins kicks off Sun
day's competition in the high
jump.
"This is the biggest meet of the
year for us," co-captain James Al
borough said, who is seeded fifth
in the 10,000 meters. "The thing
about Pac-lOa this year is that
the meet is at home. Everyone
does better when we have support
out there. We really like it. We
need it."
The meet begins Saturday at
11 a.m. and ends at 6:30 p.m.
Sunday's competition starts at
12:30 p.m. and finishes at around
4 p.m. Tickets are now being sold
for the meet.
