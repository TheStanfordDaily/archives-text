WASHINGTON (AP) - Dex
ter Manley told a Senate panel
Thursday that he has finally
overcome childhood rejection
and gained self-respect since
seeking help three years ago to
learn to read and write.
Manley, a defensive end for the
Washington Redskins, graduated
from Houston schools and Okla
homa State University depite a
severe learning disability that ef
fectively rendered him illiterate.
He enrolled in night classes at
Washington's Lab School three
years ago after seeing teammate
Joe Theismann's career ended
by a broken leg in a game against
the New York Giants.
"I can recall that vividly,"
Manley told Sen. Paul Simon,

D-111., chairman of the Senate
education subcommittee. "I had
so much fear and insecurity. I
was saying, 'I hope to God this
never happens to me' because
what would I do?"
Manley, 30, was judged to have
a second-grade reading level
when he entered the Lab School.
He was diagnosed as having an
auditory channel problem that
makes it difficult for him to re
member what he hears, partic
ularly rote material like the
sounds that letters make.
"Somehow or another, you
have to find the will ... to come
forward and ask for help. That's
the most difficult thing for a
human being to do," Manley said
of his decision at 27 to face his

problem. "1 had to humble
myself. I had to walk into the
Lab School and not pretend.
Today 1 can read and write. I
have some self-respect."
Manley brought with him a
written statement, but with all
eyes on him in a hearing room
packed with spectators and tele
vision cameras, he began to
stumble from the first sentence.
Sweat rolled down his cheeks
and tears of frustration filled
his eyes by the time he had
reached the second paragraph.
There was a long pause. Then
Wally "Famous" Amos, the
cookie magnate and a spokesper
son for the Literacy Volunteers
of America, approached the wit
ness table, put his arm around

Manley and spoke softly to him.
"Just tell your story, how it
came about," Simon told Manley
after Amos had returned to his
seat. "Don't worry about that
prepared statement. This takes
more courage than anything
you've done on the football
field."
Manley, obviously relieved,
scrapped the statement and told
Simon and Sen. Barbara
Mikulski, D-Md., about receiving
19 grades of "F" in second grade
and being placed in a special ed
ucation class for four years.
"It was very difficult because
I felt I was normal, but I was
told I was dumb and stupid. I
had a lot of rejection in my life,"
Manley said.
