# Agenda coalition disappointed with generalities of response

### John Wagner Editorial staff 
As members of the Agenda for Action
coalition made efforts yesterday to clarify
their own objectives, they were disap
pointed in University President Donald
Kennedy's effort to do the same with the
UCMI report.
Members of the coalition — who have
now agreed to meet with Kennedy Mon
day morning — spoke to about 200 stu
dents and press members yesterday in
Dinkelspiel Auditorium about the
rationale behind Monday's nine-hour
takeover of Kennedy's office.
According to Gina Hernandez, a coali
tion member and co-chair of MEChA, the
protesters had hoped their actions would
show Kennedy the strength of their com
mitment to their agenda before he made

his long-awaited progress report on the
recommendations made by the University
Committee on Minority Issues.
"We wanted to have a real impact on
what Donald Kennedy was going to say,"
Hernandez said.
But, after listening to a radio broadcast
of Kennedy's address to the Academic
Council, members and minority student
leaders criticized Kennedy for failing to
make specific commitments to improving
minority life at Stanford.
Colin Hampson, a member of the co
alition and of the Stanford American In
dian Organization, said he thought Ken
nedy's speech "was good as far as the
overall goals," but said he was "disap
pointed about a lack of specifics."
"It's hard to implement vague recom
mendations," said Delia Ibarra, a coali
tion member and MEChA co-chair.

Hernandez said Kennedy's speech con
tained "nothing we hadn't heard else
where" and was indicative of why the
tactics used by the Agenda for Action
were necessary.
The speech "proved why we can't wait,"
she said. "It made me feel more right in
what I'm doing."
Brian Kim, chair of the Asian-
American Students Association and a stu
dent member of the UCMI, said Kennedy
was placing too much emphasis on gen
eral UCMI recommendations, thereby ig
noring more specific minority concerns
on campus.
Kennedy is treating the UCMI report
as "some mandate from God," Kim said.
William McCabe, a coalition member
and SAIO member, said, "The basic op
portunities to [increase multicultural
education 1 are ignored each year" by the

administration.
Stacey Leyton, a coalition member and
current Council of Presidents member,
said she thought Kennedy was using the
UCMI report to fend off more important
minority issues. She said the UCMI proc
ess was likely to produce very "watered
down" versions of changes that need to
be made to improve minority life at Stan
ford.
Students were especially critical of Ken
nedy's contention that "the pipeline prob
lem ... is real and a serious limitation"
in appointing minority faculty. Kennedy's
assertion contradicted the UCMI's find
ing that the pipeline problem has been
exaggerated.
Tracey Leßeau of SAIO said Kennedy's
argument was weak. The administration
tends to look for minority faculty in "con
ventional places," such as Ivy League

schools, she said. In order to find more
minority faculty, she said, the adminis
tration would have to look in more "un
conventional places."
Ibarra said she felt "there are a lot of
qualified minorities throughout the coun
try."
"It's more a commitment to finding
these people," she said.
Students who spoke at Dinkelspiel yes
terday were critical of Kennedy's efforts
to include student voices in the UCMI
process.
Kim said that being one of the four
student representatives on the UCMI was
frustrating. He said the student members
of the committee were repeatedly "voted
down" by staff and faculty committee
members when they pressed for "specific
