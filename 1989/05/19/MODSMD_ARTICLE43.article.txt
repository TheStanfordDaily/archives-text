# Exploring the roots of sexual violence
## 
### Stacy Stern Staff writer 
Rape hurts both men and wom
en, explained a rape awareness ed
ucator Wednesday night as he rec
ommended measures to end
sexual violence.
Rape is more than a stranger
jumping out of the bushes at
night, said Joe Weinburg, presi
dent of Men Stopping Rape, a com
munity based group of more than
100 men working to end sexual
violence. "Rape is a metaphor for
a range of relationships between
men and women. It's an interface
between power and 3ex."
Weinburg said the roots of rape
lie in societal myths. "It feels to
me like rape imagery is all around
us," Weinburg told 50 people in
Kresge Auditorium.
According to Weinburg, the
term "rule of thumb" comes from
an English common law that per
mitted men to beat their wives
with sticks no thicker than their
thumbs.
Weinburg went on to say that
the pornography he was exposed
to as a teenager taught him he
"could buy women," and neglect
communicating with them. "This
hurt me in interactions with live,
human women," he said.
Weinburg also expressed con
cern about advertisements. "At
least with porn you have to wear
a raincoat and go to a special
store, but ads are everywhere.

'Rape is a meta
phor for a range of
relationships be
tween men and
women.'

"Guess jeans is selling rape,"
he said, before he described an
advertisement of a woman on her
knees who appeared as though she
was giving her body to a man.
He said society judges men by
what they have and do, but judges
women by how they look. The sta
tistics say men die seven years
sooner than women, Weinburg
continued. "If we buy into that
masculinity stuff, we will die
seven years earlier," he added.
The process of stopping rape
should start "within the self and
then gently extend to others,"
Weinburg said. "Men need to take
off their armor" and recognize
their feelings in order to develop
full emotional relationships with
men and women, he said. They
need to take responsibility and
communicate. Weinburg added
that body language was not suf
ficient communication.
Weinburg's group is based in
Madison, Wis., and he said he
hopes to extend the program to
Stanford.
