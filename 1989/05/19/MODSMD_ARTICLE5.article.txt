A woman walks alone at
night, unafraid. It's an unusual
situation.
In the hope of making it com
monplace, nearly 150 men and
women marched by candlelight
through campus in last night's
"Take Back the Night" protest.
A group of women from
SWOPSI 17, "Issues in Self-
Defense for Women," as part of
their course requirements, or
ganized the hour-long march
around campus in coryunction
with Rape Awareness Week.
According to Cindy Yu,
spokesperson for the class, the

march highlighted the need for
women to fight against the ac
ceptance of nighttime fear by
learning self-defense techniques
and by raising consciousness
about rape.
The third annual march
began at the Cummings Art
Building and passed by sites
where rapes have occurred. The
march ended in the Quad where
the class members led the mar
chers in yelling "NO!" as part
of their assertion techniques
learned in the class to stop a
sexual assault.
The marchers, including stu
dents, faculty and residents of
the area, sang songs and

chanted slogans such as "Women
under attack. We say . . . fight
back" and "people unite take
back the night."
At one point during the
march, the people began chant
ing "Hey ho, Budweiser's got to
go," referring to the full-page
ad in The Daily yesterday in
which three womens' bodies
form the Budweiser logo.
"Take Back the Night"
marches are organized by
groups of people all over the
country, Yu said. The first
march was held in 1978 in San
Francisco, when 10,000 women
demonstrated against pornogra
phy.
