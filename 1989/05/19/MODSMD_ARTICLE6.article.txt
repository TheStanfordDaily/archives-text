# Cable links dangle indefinitely

Cable television may he hooked
up on campus by fall quarter â€”
but don't count on it.
Cable trunk lines to Stanford
were installed in January 1988
by Pacific Bell, but negotiations
to link the cable to student resi
dences have been complex and
mired in the bureaucratic process.
Stanford is negotiating with the
Cable Communications Coopera
tive of Palo Alto to extend cable
into residences.
"I'm not sure if we're the num
ber one priority in their book,"
said Hill Yundt, who heads the
negotiations for Stanford.

Cable Co-op president John Kel
ley declined comment on the ne
gotiations.
Yundt, who is director of the
Networking Academic Computing
and Information System at Stan
ford, would not predict when stu
dents might be able to watch
MTV, ESPN and the other "non
premium" channels of cable tele
vision, although he said it might
be as early as next fall if negoti
ations go well.
In December, Yundt told The
Daily that an agreement would
not be reached until "at least the
end of the winter quarter." The
key negotiating point at that time
was a technical "right of entry
permit" so that the cable co-op

could enter residences to install
the cable.
Since December, Kelley has pre
sented one proposal for the legal
permit and the University
negotiating team is in the process
of presenting a counter-proposal.
"The ball is really in their court
right now," Yundt said. "I'm not
sure if the delay is all their fault.
Things take time and people have
other things they are working on.
Lawyers are involved and they are
very busy too," he said.
Once the permit is agreed upon,
other negotiating snags may crop
up, Yundt warned. Asbestos in
some residences will create a case
