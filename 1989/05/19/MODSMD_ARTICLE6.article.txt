# Cable links dangle indefinitely
## 
### Nathanael Cousins Staff writer 
Cable television may he hooked
up on campus by fall quarter —
but don't count on it.
Cable trunk lines to Stanford
were installed in January 1988
by Pacific Bell, but negotiations
to link the cable to student resi
dences have been complex and
mired in the bureaucratic process.
Stanford is negotiating with the
Cable Communications Coopera
tive of Palo Alto to extend cable
into residences.
"I'm not sure if we're the num
ber one priority in their book,"
said Hill Yundt, who heads the
negotiations for Stanford.

Cable Co-op president John Kel
ley declined comment on the ne
gotiations.
Yundt, who is director of the
Networking Academic Computing
and Information System at Stan
ford, would not predict when stu
dents might be able to watch
MTV, ESPN and the other "non
premium" channels of cable tele
vision, although he said it might
be as early as next fall if negoti
ations go well.
In December, Yundt told The
Daily that an agreement would
not be reached until "at least the
end of the winter quarter." The
key negotiating point at that time
was a technical "right of entry
permit" so that the cable co-op

could enter residences to install
the cable.
Since December, Kelley has pre
sented one proposal for the legal
permit and the University
negotiating team is in the process
of presenting a counter-proposal.
"The ball is really in their court
right now," Yundt said. "I'm not
sure if the delay is all their fault.
Things take time and people have
other things they are working on.
Lawyers are involved and they are
very busy too," he said.
Once the permit is agreed upon,
other negotiating snags may crop
up, Yundt warned. Asbestos in
some residences will create a case
by-case installation, and other
aesthetic and engineering factors
will apply, he said.
"Our proposal sets up a process
in which we can address these
things. There are still a lot of
things that need to be worked
out," Yundt said.
Once an agreement is finally
reached, cable will be installed in
residence common rooms and
other general-use locations. "It
will be very similar to the way
the old phone system used to be.

The phones were an individual's
choice, and the cable will be a
dorm's decision," Yundt said.
Yundt estimated the system
would cost each student approxi
mately $1 per month if their dorm
subscribed to the cable service.
Some students, such as those in
Rains House, will be able to sub
scribe to the cable service on an
individual basis.
Yundt said that about 800
campus residences are already
prepared for cable. Roble will have
cable links in individual rooms
when it opens next fall, he said.
Faculty housing was connected to
the system at the beginning of
fall quarter this year.
