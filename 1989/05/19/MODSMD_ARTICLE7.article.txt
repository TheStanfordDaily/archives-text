# Empty spots remain on University committees
## 
### Quan Phung 
There is a backlog in student
appointments to University com
mittee positions due to a lack of
interest in the chair position of
the ASSU Nominations Commis
sion.
The Nominations Commission
is a seven-member board that
reviews student applications and
makes recommendations to the
ASSU Senate on appointments to
University committees — the
main channels through which stu
dents can voice their concerns
over University issues Students
sit on influential boards such as
the Committee on Undergraduate
Studies and the Board of Trus
tees' Committee on Academic Af
fairs and Development.

The ASSU is expected to fill
the position of Nominations Com
mission chair within the next two
days. However, it has taken all of
winter and most of spring quarter
to find enough applicants.
Junior Lloyd Metz, outgoing
Nominations Commission chair,
recalled that when applications
went out during winter quarter
to fill his position, "only three or
four people" showed interest. As
a result, the ASSU was forced to
extend the deadline to this quar
ter.
Metz said he did not understand
why students were not interested
in filling the position. In evaluat
ing student applicants, the
Nominations Commission chair
wields significant power, he said.
The commission virtually controls
the placement of student commit
tee members, since the subse
quent senate confirmation is
usually a mere formality.
The ASSU has followed its
original schedule for filling com
mittee positions. Since the May
10 deadline, the applications re
turned for the 120 University
committee positions have sat on
Metz's old desk.
The ASSU is leaving the re
sponsibility of sifting through the
pile of applications to the new

Nominations Commission chair.
Once a new chair is finally
named, it will take two weeks to
interview applicants and nominate
committee members to the senate
for confirmation. The final senate
meeting of the year will be June
1, just in time to confirm the new
University committee appointees.
Those positions not filled will
be advertised and will be open to
all students the first three weeks
of fall quarter next year.
Though he did not know the
precise numbers, ASSU Adminis
trative Manager William Faucette
stated that he was pleased with
the "good response" from stu
dents applying for University com
mittee positions.

However, Lloyd Mayer, the
committee staff assistant who
serves as the liaison for new Uni
versity committee members to the
ASSU, claimed that the numbers
could easily be misleading since
some University committee posi
tions consistently attract more
student applicants than others.
Mayer stated that last year,
more than 30 students sought
three positions in the Committee
of Undergraduate Admissions and
Financial Aids, attributing this
committee's popularity to
heightened awareness of minority
concerns on campus.
The committees students were
least interested in last year were
the Tresidder Union Board and

the Housing Operations Advisory
Committee. Mayer stated that the
ASSU had difficulty filling the
five student positions for both
committees.
Overall, Mayer noted a declin
ing interest in these University
committee positions.
Mayer said that not enough stu
dents realize the impact they can
have as members of University
committees. He attributed stu
dents' lack of interest to the num
ber of other Stanford activities
attracting students.
According to Mayer, the ASSU
has done all it can to generate
interest and awareness among
students as to the existence of
these important committees.
