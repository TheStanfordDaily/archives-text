HALBEI
*
Summer
of' 49
by David Halberstam
A Pulitzer prize-winning
author recreates one of
baseball's greatest rivalries
— the 1949 pennant race
between the Yankees and
the Red Sox. In this mag
nificent chronicle of the
season when those legen
dary rivals battled down to
the last game, Halberstam captures one of the final moments
of baseball's innocent time. He also explores the develop
ments that stood poised to transform the sport: commercial
exploitation, the coming of television, and a new generation
of black superstars.
