S. E. Harris
the Kenneth and Barbara Oshman
Professor of Enginerring
This lecture will describe the pre-history (1911-1930),
early history (1954-1960), and some basic ideas of present
day lasers. Professor Harris will then discuss the use of
ultra-short time scale lasers to make x-rays, which in turn
drive short wavelength lasers. A suggestion for lasers
which operate without a population inversion will
also be described.
