# Jackson advises coalition

### Susan McKean Editorial staff 
SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO -
Meeting in person with students
from the Agenda for Action co
alition, the Rev. Jesse Jackson
last night hailed them as leaders
in a worldwide movement of stu
dent action for educational
reform.
Jackson spoke to a highly en
ergetic group of more than 60
students and four faculty mem
bers in the Airport Hilton di
rectly after he flew into San
Francisco around 8:30 p.m. He
is in the area to deliver the com
mencement address tomorrow at
the Hastings School of Law in
San Francisco.
He linked the Stanford stu
dents' cause with the ranks of
the hundreds of thousands of
students protesting in Beijing
now, and credited the Stanford
student movement with great
clarity and maturity based on
an impressive history of student
activism.
With diplomatic forcefulness,
Jackson called for cooperation
between the students and the ad
ministration, following last Mon
day's occupancy of University
President Donald Kennedy's of
fice. Jackson expressed confi

dence in Kennedy's commitment
to student concerns and a global
trend toward multicultural edu
cation.
"(Kennedy) respects the stu
dents on this campus. He sees
the Tightness and soundness of
this struggle. We need not pos
ture him as an enemy. The stu
dents have sought dialogue and
he is willing to engage in
dialogue with them," he said.
Stanford is rocked more
visibly now than some other in
stitutions, Jackson suggested,
because Stanford is farther
ahead and more advanced in its
conciousness of and commitment
to the issues of multicultural ed

ucation and minority life than
elsewhere.
At Stanford, Jackson said, stu
dent involvement and multicul
tural education are far more
advanced than at other institu
tions nationwide. "There's a cer
tain maturity and clarity here
in this struggle that puts it at
the top of student leadership."
But his praise came with
hearty advice to keep up the mo
mentum and the pressure and
expand the movement to involve
even more students.
Jackson interrupted his infor
mal address to speak with Ken
nedy over the phone, in a show
of solidarity with the students'

cause. During the phone conver
sation, Jackson talked about
tolerence, consistancy and not
overreacting and plugged the
students' demands that will be
negotiated in this morning's
meeting between student protest
leaders and Kennedy.
The students are fighting for
funding of a professor of Asian-
American history, allowing dem
ocratic process in the selection
of the dean of El Centro Chicano,
establishing a racial grievance
board to handle charges of dis
crimination and harrassment
and several other demands.

The Rev. Jesse Jackson shows his support for the efforts of Stanford students working for a
multicultural education in a meeting at the San Francisco Airport Hilton last night.
The phone call was arranged
during the weekend by Agenda
leaders who worked with the Pres
ident's Office staff to contact Ken
nedy while he was away in
Chicago. Jackson took the call in
the lobby, after Keith Archuleta,
director of the Black Community
Services Center, called Kennedy
at home. Speaking in low tones,
Jackson turned his back, his
Guess jeans and Nike Airs to a
crowd of hotel guests, reporters,
photographers and a large contin
gent from an extravagant Pales
tinian wedding party that he later
visited.
Following the phone call, Jack
son told students he was confident
in Kennedy's commitment to the
goals and in the outlook for fur
ther progress. He did make clear,
however, that he will be on call
today lest today's meeting be
tween Kennedy and the students
fails to open up communication
and advance the University's com
mitment to work with students.
"Kennedy represents the kind
of leadership that can respond,
not just react ... he is ready to
discuss and dialogue, not resist
and repress," Jackson said.
In respect to the charges of
trespassing and disruption levied

against the protesters, Jackson
advised the students to devote
themselves to promoting the is
sues and the demands rather than
to fighting the charges.
"The first issue is to face the
changes, not drop the charges. . . .
It is the changes that are the pri
ority. If the changes are respected
and appreciated then the changes
will be made and the charges
dropped," Jackson said, later call
ing the action an example "in the
best tradition of non-violence."
He emphasized that there is
"never gain without some pain,"
but expressed the importance of
"turning to each other now, not
on each other."
He cast Stanford student activ
ism and the occupation last week
as part of a worldwide movement
for educational reform led chiefly
by students. "The drive for edu
cational reform by students
around the world is the modern
day civil rights movement,
whether in Beijing or at Stan
ford. . . . The fight for multicul
tural education is highly relevant,
because that is the broader issue
now."
Jackson went on to praise the
issues and the students, who he
said are at last, "fighting for ac
ademic expansion as opposed to
fighting for the right to take
drugs."
Jackson said he hopes his pres
ence carries some weight. As a
student leader of the civil rights
movement, Jackson said his activ
ism propelled him to prominence.
He said he sees the students' ac

tions last week as a continuation
of the '60s movement. In addition,
he has recently acted as a
mediator at other universities
where similar occupations were
staged.
After the speech, student
leaders said Jackson heartened
them and boost morale. Gina Her
nandez, MEChA co-chair, said he
encouraged the coalition's cause
by placing their actions in the
context of a broader movement
that deserves commitment and re
spect, as opposed to censure,
which they said they felt this
week.
"We are the next generation to
serve our nation. We want to make
Stanford better, we want to make
America better," Hernandez said,
adding that, "Students, Jackson
and I think, Kennedy himself sup
port our mission."
History Prof. Clay Carson, who
attended the speech last night and
was one of the faculty that met
with students as they occupied
Kennedy's office, said the greatest
obstacles to action on student de
mands lie in faculty resistance,
not in Kennedy's hands. "The
higher administration and the
students are leading the way, and
the faculty are tailing behind," he
said. Nonetheless, he added, "I
wish Kennedy had taken a more
understanding tone in response
to the protest last week, because
we need to get the process of
reform off to the best possible
start. Isolating a group of students
just doesn't set the right tone of
cooperation."

for educational reform led chiefly
by students. "The drive for edu
cational reform by students
around the world is the modern
day civil rights movement,
whether in Beijing or at Stan
ford. . . . The fight for multicul
tural education is highly relevant,
because that is the broader issue
now."
Jackson went on to praise the
issues and the students, who he
said are at last, "fighting for ac
ademic expansion as opposed to
fighting for the right to take
drugs."
Jackson said he hopes his pres
ence carries some weight. As a
student leader of the civil rights
movement, Jackson said his activ
ism propelled him to prominence.
He said he sees the students' ac

tions last week as a continuation
of the '60s movement. In addition,
he has recently acted as a
mediator at other universities
where similar occupations were
staged.
After the speech, student
leaders said Jackson heartened
them and boost morale. Gina Her
nandez, MEChA co-chair, said he
encouraged the coalition's cause
by placing their actions in the
context of a broader movement
that deserves commitment and re
spect, as opposed to censure,
which they said they felt this
week.
"We are the next generation to
serve our nation. We want to make
Stanford better, we want to make
America better," Hernandez said,
adding that, "Students, Jackson
and I think, Kennedy himself sup
port our mission."
History Prof. Clay Carson, who
attended the speech last night and
was one of the faculty that met
with students as they occupied
Kennedy's office, said the greatest
obstacles to action on student de
mands lie in faculty resistance,
not in Kennedy's hands. "The
higher administration and the
students are leading the way, and
the faculty are tailing behind," he
said. Nonetheless, he added, "I
wish Kennedy had taken a more
understanding tone in response
to the protest last week, because
we need to get the process of
reform off to the best possible
start. Isolating a group of students
just doesn't set the right tone of
cooperation."
SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO -
Meeting in person with students
from the Agenda for Action co
alition, the Rev. Jesse Jackson
last night hailed them as leaders
in a worldwide movement of stu
dent action for educational
reform.
Jackson spoke to a highly en
ergetic group of more than 60
students and four faculty mem
bers in the Airport Hilton di
rectly after he flew into San
Francisco around 8:30 p.m. He
is in the area to deliver the com
mencement address tomorrow at
the Hastings School of Law in
San Francisco.
He linked the Stanford stu
dents' cause with the ranks of
the hundreds of thousands of
students protesting in Beijing
now, and credited the Stanford
student movement with great
clarity and maturity based on
an impressive history of student
activism.
With diplomatic forcefulness,
Jackson called for cooperation
between the students and the ad
ministration, following last Mon
day's occupancy of University
President Donald Kennedy's of
fice. Jackson expressed confi

dence in Kennedy's commitment
to student concerns and a global
trend toward multicultural edu
cation.
"(Kennedy) respects the stu
dents on this campus. He sees
the Tightness and soundness of
this struggle. We need not pos
ture him as an enemy. The stu
dents have sought dialogue and
he is willing to engage in
dialogue with them," he said.
Stanford is rocked more
visibly now than some other in
stitutions, Jackson suggested,
because Stanford is farther
ahead and more advanced in its
conciousness of and commitment
to the issues of multicultural ed

ucation and minority life than
elsewhere.
At Stanford, Jackson said, stu
dent involvement and multicul
tural education are far more
advanced than at other institu
tions nationwide. "There's a cer
tain maturity and clarity here
in this struggle that puts it at
the top of student leadership."
But his praise came with
hearty advice to keep up the mo
mentum and the pressure and
expand the movement to involve
even more students.
Jackson interrupted his infor
mal address to speak with Ken
nedy over the phone, in a show
of solidarity with the students'

cause. During the phone conver
sation, Jackson talked about
tolerence, consistancy and not
overreacting and plugged the
students' demands that will be
negotiated in this morning's
meeting between student protest
leaders and Kennedy.
The students are fighting for
funding of a professor of Asian-
American history, allowing dem
ocratic process in the selection
of the dean of El Centro Chicano,
establishing a racial grievance
board to handle charges of dis
crimination and harrassment
and several other demands.

The Rev. Jesse Jackson shows his support for the efforts of Stanford students working for a
multicultural education in a meeting at the San Francisco Airport Hilton last night.
The phone call was arranged
during the weekend by Agenda
leaders who worked with the Pres
ident's Office staff to contact Ken
nedy while he was away in
Chicago. Jackson took the call in
the lobby, after Keith Archuleta,
director of the Black Community
Services Center, called Kennedy
at home. Speaking in low tones,
Jackson turned his back, his
Guess jeans and Nike Airs to a
crowd of hotel guests, reporters,
photographers and a large contin
gent from an extravagant Pales
tinian wedding party that he later
visited.
Following the phone call, Jack
son told students he was confident
in Kennedy's commitment to the
goals and in the outlook for fur
ther progress. He did make clear,
however, that he will be on call
today lest today's meeting be
tween Kennedy and the students
fails to open up communication
and advance the University's com
mitment to work with students.
"Kennedy represents the kind
of leadership that can respond,
not just react ... he is ready to
discuss and dialogue, not resist
and repress," Jackson said.
In respect to the charges of
trespassing and disruption levied

against the protesters, Jackson
advised the students to devote
themselves to promoting the is
sues and the demands rather than
to fighting the charges.
"The first issue is to face the
changes, not drop the charges. . . .
It is the changes that are the pri
ority. If the changes are respected
and appreciated then the changes
will be made and the charges
dropped," Jackson said, later call
ing the action an example "in the
best tradition of non-violence."
He emphasized that there is
"never gain without some pain,"
but expressed the importance of
"turning to each other now, not
on each other."
He cast Stanford student activ
ism and the occupation last week
as part of a worldwide movement
for educational reform led chiefly
by students. "The drive for edu
cational reform by students
around the world is the modern
day civil rights movement,
whether in Beijing or at Stan
