SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO -
Meeting in person with students
from the Agenda for Action co
alition, the Rev. Jesse Jackson
last night hailed them as leaders
in a worldwide movement of stu
dent action for educational
reform.
Jackson spoke to a highly en
ergetic group of more than 60
students and four faculty mem
bers in the Airport Hilton di
rectly after he flew into San
Francisco around 8:30 p.m. He
is in the area to deliver the com
mencement address tomorrow at
the Hastings School of Law in
San Francisco.
He linked the Stanford stu
dents' cause with the ranks of
the hundreds of thousands of
students protesting in Beijing
now, and credited the Stanford
student movement with great
clarity and maturity based on
an impressive history of student
activism.
With diplomatic forcefulness,
Jackson called for cooperation
between the students and the ad
ministration, following last Mon
day's occupancy of University
President Donald Kennedy's of
fice. Jackson expressed confi

dence in Kennedy's commitment
to student concerns and a global
trend toward multicultural edu
cation.
"(Kennedy) respects the stu
dents on this campus. He sees
the Tightness and soundness of
this struggle. We need not pos
ture him as an enemy. The stu
dents have sought dialogue and
he is willing to engage in
dialogue with them," he said.
Stanford is rocked more
visibly now than some other in
stitutions, Jackson suggested,
because Stanford is farther
ahead and more advanced in its
conciousness of and commitment
to the issues of multicultural ed

ucation and minority life than
elsewhere.
At Stanford, Jackson said, stu
dent involvement and multicul
tural education are far more
advanced than at other institu
tions nationwide. "There's a cer
tain maturity and clarity here
in this struggle that puts it at
the top of student leadership."
But his praise came with
hearty advice to keep up the mo
mentum and the pressure and
expand the movement to involve
even more students.
Jackson interrupted his infor
mal address to speak with Ken
nedy over the phone, in a show
of solidarity with the students'

cause. During the phone conver
sation, Jackson talked about
tolerence, consistancy and not
overreacting and plugged the
students' demands that will be
negotiated in this morning's
meeting between student protest
leaders and Kennedy.
The students are fighting for
funding of a professor of Asian-
American history, allowing dem
ocratic process in the selection
of the dean of El Centro Chicano,
establishing a racial grievance
board to handle charges of dis
crimination and harrassment
and several other demands.
