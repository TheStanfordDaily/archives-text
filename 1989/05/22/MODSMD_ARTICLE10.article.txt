# Protesters receiving global support for their demands
## 
### 
Thousands of native Chinese marched together
in Hong Kong, Paris, Tokyo and scores of other
cities yesterday in a worldwide show of solidarity
with their besieged brethren in Beijing.
President Bush likened the protests in China to
the civil rights marches led by Martin Luther King,
and the Nationalist Chinese government in Taiwan
condemned the actions of the rival communist
regime on the mainland.
The demonstrations came as hundreds of thou
sands of people in Beijing defied martial law for a
second day in a row and swarmed through the city
demanding democratic reforms. The army was re
portedly poised for a crackdown.
In Hong Kong, a British colony scheduled to
revert to Chinese rule in 1997, an estimated 400,000
people virtually paralyzed the city during a peaceful
march in support of the Beijing protesters.
Media were generally supportive. Even the staff
of the Xinhua News Agency, the unofficial repre
sentative of China in Hong Kong, wrote a banner
to support the marchers.
The crowd marched for three hours, then entered
a race track and listened to speeches by community
leaders, movie stars and lawmakers.
In the United States, Chinese students said in
an open telegram that they no longer recognize the
government led by Premier Li Peng.
"We 10,000 Chinese students in New York City
and the East Coast of the United States are on the
side of the Chinese people," the telegram said.
"We no longer recognize the Chinese government
led by Li Peng as a legal administration in China,
and we pledge our complete disobedience to such a
hostile government towards the whole Chinese na
tion."
About 300 students attended a demonstration at
the Chinese consulate in New York. Three students
met with officials of the Chinese consulate in New
York and delivered the telegram.
Other rallies were held in Lawrence, Kan; Hous
ton and Washington D.C.
Taiwan's Nationalist government condemned the
communist Chinese government for ordering mili
tary troops to crack down on the student-led
protests. It said it may take "effective measures"
to support the pro-democracy movement.
Government spokesman Shaw Yu-ming refused
to say what that might include, because "we don't
want to offer the mainland any excuse to take
retaliatory action against the students."
