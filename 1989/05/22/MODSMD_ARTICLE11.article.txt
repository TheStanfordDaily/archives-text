# Soviet lawmakers call for radical changes

### 
MOSCOW (AP) â€” Boris Yeltsin and
other lawmakers told cheering Mus
covites yesterday they have drafted their
own agenda for the Soviet congress call
ing for "radical" action on the economy
and contested elections for the
presidency.
To applause from tens of thousands,
Yeltsin, a Communist Party maverick,
also demanded that President Mikhail
Gorbachev give a public accounting of
the first four years of his reforms when
congress opens its inaugural session
Thursday.
Only after hearing such a report
should the congress decide whether Gor
bachev, Communist Party general sec
retary since March 1985, should again
be elected president, Yeltsin said.
Yeltsin and other deputies elected to

the new Congress of People's Deputies,
including human rights activist Andrei
Sakharov and two controversial anti
corruption prosecutors, spoke at an eve
ning rally in southern Moscow.
Some police officials estimated the
crowd at 30,000, but its size fluctuated
as people came and went.
The rally's radical tone was shown by
the loud cheers that greeted Congress
Deputy Alexander Tolstoukhov's sugges
tion that "we should elect true people's
power with a true people's president:
Yeltsin!"
Yeltsin told the rally that a group of
deputies elected to represent Moscow in
the new parliament have drafted their
own agenda for the session and that it
demands "radical decisions on the eco
nomy, social justice and glasnost."
