## Bush: NATO is growing complacent 
### 
BOSTON (AP) — President Bush,
facing disarmament pressure from Eu
rope, expressed concern yesterday about
"a growing complacency throughout the
West" and said America and her allies
must not drop their guard against the
Soviet Union.
He said that in an era of "extraordi
nary change" in the Soviet Union, "We
have an obligation to temper optimism
— and I am optimistic — with
prudence." His comments came in re
marks at Boston University, where he
shared commencement speaking duty
with French President Francois Mitter
rand.
Pointing to Moscow's threat to retain
some nuclear missiles banned by a 1987
treaty if NATO upgrades its short-range
arsenal, Bush said, "It is clear that So
viet 'new thinking' has not yet totally
overcome the old."
Later, in a two-language joint news
conference, Bush and Mitterrand both
expressed optimism that a rift within

NATO over short-range European mis
siles could be bridged before next week's
NATO summit.
A spokesman for the West German
government, Hans Klein, said Bonn also
is confident that a resolution can be
reached before the meeting. He said one
proposal forms a basis for a solution
but no agreement has yet been reached.
Bush said: "I think we could well
have this resolved before the summit."
He said American officials have been
in close touch with British Prime Min
ister Margaret Thatcher on the missile
issue, adding that he agrees with her
that "we can get together on this vexing
question."
"My role has been behind the scenes,
to be helpful in working this problem,
to iron out those differences," Bush said.
Mitterrand said NATO periodically
faces internal controversies such as the
current one, adding he was hopeful this
latest difficulty would be resolved before
the summit opens. "I'd be happy if the

views can be reconciled," the French
leader said.
Mitterrand fielded one news confer
ence question by dismissing a comment
from White House spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater that Soviet Leader Mikhail
Gorbachev was a "drugstore cowboy"
whose arms control proposals lack sub
stance.
"Mr. Gorbachev is worth very much
more than that," Mitterrand said, dis
missing "caricatures."
As the words were translated, Bush
laughed and said, "So much for Marlin."
He added, "I could defend Marlin" —
but he neither did that nor disavowed
the spokesman's earlier remark.
The two leaders flew here together
after a day of talks Saturday at Bush's
vacation estate overlooking the Atlantic
Ocean on a rocky point in Ken
nebunkport, Maine.
They spoke before a commencement
audience estimated at 31,000 people at
tending the ceremony.
