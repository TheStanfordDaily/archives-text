LIMA, Peru (AP) â€” A small
U.S. plane used in Peru's anti
drug effort crashed in the Andes
mountains, killing the six Amer
icans and three Peruvians aboard,
officials said yesterday.
U.S. Embassy spokesman
Charles Loveridge said the plane
went down Saturday afternoon,
after it had left the jungle town
of Tingo Maria. He said the
wreckage was spotted yesterday
morning.
Loveridge refused to provide
the names of the passengers. But
he said the dead Americans in
cluded a DEA agent, two helicop
ter pilots, the plane's pilot, a me
chanic and a security officer from
the embassy.
In Washington, Maurice Hill, a
DEA public information officer,
identified the dead DEA agent as
Rick Finley, 36, of Ft. Knox, Ky.
Interior Ministry spokesman

Fernando Yovera said all nine on
the single-engine plane died. He
said the three Peruvians were a
police captain, the 8-year-old son
of a police commander and the
chief of the U.S.-funded coca
eradication program.
Yovera said the U.S. plane was
flown by an American contract
pilot, and Hill said it was owned
by the U.S. State Department's
International Narcotics Matters
Bureau.
Yovera said there was no indi
cation of what had caused the
crash, but he discounted sabotage
because of strict security controls.
American personnel in two
Peruvian military helicopters
from Lima were recovering the
bodies yesterday, Yovera said. The
effort had been suspended last
night until the morning,
Ixjveridge said.
Yovera said the plane crashed

in a remote area on the arid west
ern slopes of the Andes, 65 miles
northeast of Lima.
Loveridge said rescue teams
aboard helicopters had spotted the
plane's wreckage and burned
bodies scattered nearby. He said
the plane was destroyed when it
apparently slammed into a moun
tainside 15,000 feet above sea
level and the largest piece visible
from the air was the engine.
Loveridge said the last contact
with the plane was when the
aircraft passed over Huanuco, 185
miles northeast of Lima.
The valley is the world's
greatest source of coca leaf, the
raw material for cocaine. The U.S.
government has assigned several
dozen agents to work with
Peruvian anti-drug police in cam
paigns against drug traffickers in
the violent region.
