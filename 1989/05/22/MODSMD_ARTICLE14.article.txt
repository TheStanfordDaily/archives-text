Britain expels Soviets for spying
MOSCOW (AP) â€” Britain ordered eight Soviet
diplomats and three journalists out of the country
for alleged espionage, and the Soviet Union
responded with an identical set of expulsions, the
British Embassy said yesterday.
"It's a mirror-image act of retaliation," Sir
Rodric Braithwaite, Britain's ambassador to Mos
cow, told a news conference.
Britain said its expulsions were legitimate and
that the Soviet response was unjustified. The
Soviet Union had no immediate comment on
either set of expulsions.
On Friday, Soviet Ambassador Leonid
Zamyatin was called to the British Foreign Office
in London and told that 11 Soviets were being
expelled for "activities incompatible with their
status," a Foreign Office spokesman said.
The spokesman would not detail the specific
allegations, but "incompatible activities" is dip
lomatic parlance for espionage.
The Foreign Office spokesman, speaking

anonymously in keeping with British custom,
said Britain had not planned to make public the
expulsions and did so only after the Soviets re
taliated.
Florida may help to buy Eastern
TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) - Gov. Bob Mar
tinez may try to use Florida's $17 billion pension
fund to back the purchase of Eastern Airlines
in an effort to protect jobs provided by the Miami
based airline, according to reports yesterday.
Two newspapers, The Miami Herald and the
Palm Beach Post, reported that an investment
of at least $50 million was being considered,
given the proper guarantees against loss.
Two high-ranking state aides were in New
York Friday for talks with officials of Eastern
Airlines' pilot union and financial and legal con
sultants.
One of them, Brian Ballard, Martinez' chief of
operations, confirmed the negotiations.
