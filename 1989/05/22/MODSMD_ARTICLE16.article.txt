## Heal, don't hurt 
### 
Charging those arrested
with Standard violation
won't further progress

IT IS A TIME for healing and
dialogue on campus, not
threats of punishment. The
wrenching drama of student
protest and University arrests
last week revealed serious prob
lems in the "Stanford family."
To address the underlying
causes of Monday's action, the
University must now seriously
consider the problems raised by
the protesters. Punishment by
the Fundamental Standard will
only exacerbate the situation.
Clearly, the members of the
Agenda for Action Coalition vio
lated the letter of the Policy on
Campus Disruption, but it will
be up to the University to decide
if it wants to charge students with
a Fundamental Standard viola
tion.
When students occupied the
President's Office last Monday,
they violated the part of the
campus disruption policy, drafted
in 1967, which states: Members
of the faculty, staff and student
body must not, "prevent or dis
rupt the effective carrying out of
a University function. . ."
Yet the policy does not man
date specific punishments, only
pointing out that in the past
penalties have ranged from "cen
sure to expulsion." The policy
states, "There is no 'ordinary'
penalty which attaches to viola
tions."

The University should consider
what will be best for the overall
community before it decides
whether or not to enforce the

policy. Punishing those whose
emotions reached a boiling point
last Monday will not solve the
problems the University must ad
dress regarding educational
priorities, nor will punishment
help reverse the increasing
polarization on campus.
As the University has shown
by its reluctance to deal with
other potential Fundamental
Standard violations this year, it
has the power to choose the cir
cumstances under which it will
apply the Standard.
It would be bitterly ironic if
the student protesters were pun
ished by a Standard that the Uni
versity found inapplicable to stu
dents who committed racist or
homophobic acts â€” incidents the
protesters were hoping to end
through educational means.
Regardless of what one thinks
of the tactics used by the Agenda
for Action Coalition last Monday,
the Stanford community must
not lose sight of the central is
sues.
From pushing for curriculum
changes to pressing for imple
mentation of the University Com
mittee on Minority Issues report,
students of color have been inte
gral in the University's work to
create a multicultural communi
ty. The Stanford community
should look at those protesting
for a better education as assets
to the progress of the University
and not as criminal disrupters.
In the final analysis, the Uni
versity must appreciate the fact
that the issues raised by the
Agenda for Action will benefit the
entire community. Teaching as
sistants, more faculty of color and
financial aid are important con
cerns for all students. The Uni
versity and students should now
work together to address these
important concerns.
