Idea of Standard
charges outrageous
The mere suggestion that the Uni
versity would try to charge the May 15
protesters under the Fundamental
Standard is deplorable and the Univer
sity is no less than hypocritical. Appar
ently, our administrators believe that
the Fundamental Standard exists to
serve the administration and not the
students.
When students violate this standard
by urinating on their roommate's
clothes, by writing "faggot" on their
resident assistant's door, by terrorizing
an entire dorm standing in an impas
sable circle with candles and masks at
midnight, by defacing posters in the
name of intellectual freedom, by steal
ing computers from the Bookstore, the
University cowers and rings its hands.
University President Donald Kennedy
should be ashamed. He will call in the
police to save a building, but when
individuals are threatened he does
nothing. He has given us a firsthand
lesson in the personalized fear that
characterizes all authority. When it is
himself on the line, he acts; when it is
someone else, all he can do is pretend
to sympathize.

Commit a crime, be
treated as criminal
I find it interesting that the student
protesters are complaining about being
treated as criminals. Isn't it standard
policy for the police to treat those who
commit crimes as criminals? It seems
to me that the label fits quite nicely.
I am also irritated, but not sur
prised, that several of our faculty com
plained about the use of the police at
the May 15 protest. Again, it is not
unusual — in fact, it's usually ex-

pected — that the police are called
when crimes are being committed.
One final legal note: Anybody with a
head on their shoulders knows that
University President Donald Kennedy
wasn't responsible for the arrests, as
claimed. Though they often whine and
try to shift their blame to others,
clearly those who commit crimes are
ultimately responsible for their own
actions.

Asking for amnesty
hurts the cause
Last week a number of Stanford
students express their strongly held
beliefs by violating a campus regulation
prohibiting the uninvited occupation of
a University building.
How one assesses the moral worth of
an act of protest such as this depends
heavily on one's evaluation of the pro
testers' motivations, methods and
goals. Rut it also depends on whether
a protester is willing to accept the
personally harmful consequences of
breaking the law.
If a student occupying the Presi
dent's Office says, in effect, "I am
willing to pay the penalty of disrupting
my own education in exchange for the
manner in which I choose to dramatize
my beliefs and attempt to influence

University policy," even those who do
not share the student's goals will ac
knowledge that the act of protest pos
sesses a certain morally compelling
quality.
On the other hand, if a protester
knowingly violates a longstanding
campus regulation and then demands
that no punishment be imposed for
doing so, the moral force of the indi
vidual's actions is dramatically
diminished — even in the eyes of
many people who share the concerns
generating the initial protest.
Unless the protesters are prepared to
claim — and able to convince the rest
of the University community — that
the regulation banning occupation of a
University building is unjust, I believe
they risk doing harm to their own
cause by arguing that they should not
be punished.

BSU supports all
demands of protest
The Black Student Union strongly
agrees with the demands of the Stu
dents of Color Coalition protest. The
13 demands are all valid; the adminis
tration has been extremely insensitive
to the needs of the communities of
color.
There are those who believe that
support of these demands will lower
the level of education at Stanford. This
is ironic since the communities of color
provide the University with a diverse
cultural experience. Each community is
responsible for programming to help
educate the other communities as well
as to enrich ourselves.
While the black community truly
understands the frustration and the
feeling of urgency of the other commu
nities, and our history here at Stan
ford has been filled with this sentiment
as well, at this moment the BSU as a
body does not officially endorse the

occupation of the President's Office.
However, there are black students
who have decided that these issues are
worthy of such a drastic action. These
students have the BSU's full support,
especially with respect to the discipli
nary action that may be employed
against them due to the Fundamental
Standard. The BSU will staunchly sup
port amnesty for all the protesters
involved in the occupation.

University lawyer
spoke too quickly
I am appalled that University Gen
eral Counsel John Schwartz would
brazenly predict that the protesters
arrested on May 15 "will be found to
have violated the Fundamental Stand
ard." So much for being innocent until
proven guilty.
Such flagrant disregard for due proc
ess is inappropriate at any time from a
lawyer, but especially from the Univer
sity's general counsel at this severe
juncture.

Balanced editorial
didn't take sides
Instead of taking the easy path of
choosing aides, the May 17 Daily edito
rial, "United we fall," was a balanced
presentation of the events, detailing
errors made by both sides during the
occupation of the President's Office.
The rash actions of the protesters
and the overreaction of the administra
tion must not be allowed to prevent
efforts towards implementing the
UCMI recommendations.

13 demands are all valid; the adminis
tration has been extremely insensitive
to the needs of the communities of
color.
There are those who believe that
support of these demands will lower
the level of education at Stanford. This
is ironic since the communities of color
provide the University with a diverse
cultural experience. Each community is
responsible for programming to help
educate the other communities as well
as to enrich ourselves.
While the black community truly
understands the frustration and the
feeling of urgency of the other commu
nities, and our history here at Stan
ford has been filled with this sentiment
as well, at this moment the BSU as a
body does not officially endorse the

occupation of the President's Office.
However, there are black students
who have decided that these issues are
worthy of such a drastic action. These
students have the BSU's full support,
especially with respect to the discipli
nary action that may be employed
against them due to the Fundamental
Standard. The BSU will staunchly sup
port amnesty for all the protesters
involved in the occupation.

spoke too quickly
I am appalled that University Gen
eral Counsel John Schwartz would
brazenly predict that the protesters
arrested on May 15 "will be found to
have violated the Fundamental Stand
ard." So much for being innocent until
proven guilty.
Such flagrant disregard for due proc
ess is inappropriate at any time from a
lawyer, but especially from the Univer
sity's general counsel at this severe
juncture.

Balanced editorial
didn't take sides
Instead of taking the easy path of
choosing aides, the May 17 Daily edito
rial, "United we fall," was a balanced
presentation of the events, detailing
errors made by both sides during the
occupation of the President's Office.
The rash actions of the protesters
and the overreaction of the administra
tion must not be allowed to prevent
efforts towards implementing the
UCMI recommendations.

Idea of Standard
charges outrageous
The mere suggestion that the Uni
versity would try to charge the May 15
protesters under the Fundamental
Standard is deplorable and the Univer
sity is no less than hypocritical. Appar
ently, our administrators believe that
the Fundamental Standard exists to
serve the administration and not the
students.
When students violate this standard
by urinating on their roommate's
clothes, by writing "faggot" on their
resident assistant's door, by terrorizing
an entire dorm standing in an impas
sable circle with candles and masks at
midnight, by defacing posters in the
name of intellectual freedom, by steal
ing computers from the Bookstore, the
University cowers and rings its hands.
University President Donald Kennedy
should be ashamed. He will call in the
police to save a building, but when
individuals are threatened he does
nothing. He has given us a firsthand
lesson in the personalized fear that
characterizes all authority. When it is
himself on the line, he acts; when it is
someone else, all he can do is pretend
to sympathize.

Commit a crime, be
treated as criminal
I find it interesting that the student
protesters are complaining about being
treated as criminals. Isn't it standard
policy for the police to treat those who
commit crimes as criminals? It seems
to me that the label fits quite nicely.
I am also irritated, but not sur
prised, that several of our faculty com
plained about the use of the police at
the May 15 protest. Again, it is not
unusual — in fact, it's usually ex-

pected — that the police are called
when crimes are being committed.
One final legal note: Anybody with a
head on their shoulders knows that
University President Donald Kennedy
wasn't responsible for the arrests, as
claimed. Though they often whine and
try to shift their blame to others,
clearly those who commit crimes are
ultimately responsible for their own
actions.

Asking for amnesty
hurts the cause
Last week a number of Stanford
students express their strongly held
beliefs by violating a campus regulation
prohibiting the uninvited occupation of
a University building.
How one assesses the moral worth of
an act of protest such as this depends
heavily on one's evaluation of the pro
testers' motivations, methods and
goals. Rut it also depends on whether
a protester is willing to accept the
personally harmful consequences of
breaking the law.
If a student occupying the Presi
dent's Office says, in effect, "I am
willing to pay the penalty of disrupting
my own education in exchange for the
manner in which I choose to dramatize
my beliefs and attempt to influence

University policy," even those who do
not share the student's goals will ac
knowledge that the act of protest pos
sesses a certain morally compelling
quality.
On the other hand, if a protester
knowingly violates a longstanding
campus regulation and then demands
that no punishment be imposed for
doing so, the moral force of the indi
vidual's actions is dramatically
diminished — even in the eyes of
many people who share the concerns
generating the initial protest.
Unless the protesters are prepared to
claim — and able to convince the rest
of the University community — that
the regulation banning occupation of a
University building is unjust, I believe
they risk doing harm to their own
cause by arguing that they should not
be punished.
