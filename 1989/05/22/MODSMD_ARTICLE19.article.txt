## Anti-abortion, pro-choice 
### 
ROE V. WADE," the movie, aired
last Monday night. It was preceded
by lots of hype about how much
money NBC lost, about how biased it
would be and about how Pampers wasn't
exactly running to get in line for 30-
second spots.
In the end, it turned out to be a mildly
dry but very well-acted movie about an
ordinary Texas woman who could not
afford to keep the child she was carrying.
She is not so unusual. In my own high
school in Texas, at any given time, there
was at least one 16-year-old who was
sporting a tummy that no amount of
sit-ups would diminish. And Texas isn't
alone in that department.
I told a male friend once that I would
never have an abortion unless I was
raped. He told me to remind him never
to date him. Abortion, whether it is legal
or not, is a fact of life that will never
leave us. The mere fact that this movie
was aired nearly two decades after the
actual case took place shows its continu
ing bearing on life.
The pro-choice rally in Washington
demonstrates abortion's importance as
well, but some people would rather not
deal with the issue. Or better put, they
would rather not deal with its acceptance
by a large portion of society. The news
media stated that there were 300,000
people in attendance at that rally. People
who were there say it approached double
that number.
As far as the drop in advertisers for a
movie that boasted hot box office star
Holly Hunter, as well as notables like
Amy Madigan and Terry O'Quinn, what
else could be the cause but fear of

dealing? It isn't a topic people want to
deal with, so they avoid it.
Pro-life people refer to their opposition
as pro-abortion to further avoid dealing.
I am not pro-abortion, as I said, but
pro-choice. No one can dictate what I or
anyone else should do in our bedrooms
or with our bodies, but they want to
paint us as murderers.
Maybe a fetus is a soul, a life as valu
able as its mother, but tell a woman that
if she cannot take care of the child she
should put it up for adoption, and you
are almost denying the importance of
that life.
Tell a woman that she must carry
within her body a life for nine months,
a life that will affect her everyday expe
rience to the extent that she will be unable
to differentiate her needs from her child's,
and then it will be taken away.
Tell her she will watch her body change
to meet the appetite of the child when
it emerges, but will never feed her child.
Unless you are going to be the one to
tell her these things and comfort her
after it's all over, should you really be
the one to tell her not to abort her baby?
That wasn't a question I was address
ing to anyone in particular, but to myself
as well. I don't believe that abortion
should be an alternative to or a last-ditch
attempt at birth control. I believe that
responsible people should take their
precautions beforehand.
But because I could never tell a woman
to give up her baby knowing that I myself
would be utterly incapable of doing so,
I cannot condemn people who wish to
have abortion as an option.
About the movie, though. I liked it. I

didn't think it was too biased because it
appealed to both sides of my ambivalence.
It dealt with all the arguments and when
it provoked one response with "Jane
Roe's" suicide attempt, it provoked an
other with the defending attorney's soul
searching about when life really begins.
My father says I didn't find it biased
because I'm biased in the same direction,
and it is true that this is a difficult
subject on which to be objective. But I
think, if anything, my bias is away from
the portrayed woman's cause. Unless that
cause is the right to choose, and for her,
that really wasn't the point.
So when people tell me that I'm pro
abortion, they're wrong. I think that
abortion is better than the abuse some
children have to go through because they
were unwanted, I think it is better than
destroying a young woman's life because
she made a mistake, and I think that it
is better than forcing a woman to go
through a pregnancy with no hope of
seeing her child.
It isn't the best thing, but until we
come up with infallible birth control or
infallible people, it is inescapable. As Amy
Madigan said, "Making abortion illegal
doesn't make it stop, it just makes it
dangerous."
