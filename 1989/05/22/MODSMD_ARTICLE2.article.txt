# COP lends skills, money to Agenda
## 
### John Wagner Editorial staff 
Over the course of the last
week, the Council of Presidents
has thrown its full weight behind
the Agenda for Action coalition,
offering not only the commitment
and support of individual COP
members — but also extending
its financial resources.
Using avenues sanctioned by
past precedent and not prohibited
by ASSU Bylaws, the COP has
contributed the following assets
to the fight for greater student
involvement in setting educational
priorities:
• A $1,500 cash loan from the
COP expense account, authorized
last Monday afternoon by COP
member Miguel Marquez, to be
used if needed as bail for students
arrested in the May 15 takeover
of University President Donald
Kennedy's office;
• A "temporary" allowance of
$285 from the COP expense ac
count to cover towing and repair
costs of a van used by students
to block the police bus containing
the arrested students last Mon
day;
• At least $75 from the COP
expense account for production
and photocopying of Agenda for
Action fliers; and
• The arrests of two current
COP members, David Brown and
Stacey Leyton, and the arrests of
two COP-elect members, Brown
and Ingrid Nava.

"It's not like it's any surprise
that the COP is supporting [the
Agenda for Action]," Brown said
in an interview yesterday. "We got
elected to do everything in our
power to advance these issues. I'm
proud of us using our resources."
According to Brown, all the cur
rent and newly elected COP mem
bers support the goals of the
Agenda for Action coalition. As
representatives of the student
body, Brown said, "We'd be ir
responsible and unaccountable if
we didn't take a stand."
Brown cited a straw poll taken
earlier in the year as an example
of general student support behind
the issues advocated by the coa
lition. For instance, Brown said,
80 percent of the student body
surveyed said they supported the
development of ethnic studies.
According to Leyton, "The main
thing is you've got to be account
able to the students." Leyton said
her COP slate ran on a platform
which was very clear about its
political agenda.
The COP, Brown said, is willing
to do "whatever it takes" to bring
such changes about.
Getting the bail money
While 40 of the students who
had been arrested in the takeover
last Monday sat handcuffed on
the police bus, Marquez ran to
the COP business office, where
