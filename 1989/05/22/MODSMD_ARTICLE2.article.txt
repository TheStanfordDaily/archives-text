# COP lends skills, money to Agenda
## 
### John Wagner Editorial staff 
Over the course of the last
week, the Council of Presidents
has thrown its full weight behind
the Agenda for Action coalition,
offering not only the commitment
and support of individual COP
members — but also extending
its financial resources.
Using avenues sanctioned by
past precedent and not prohibited
by ASSU Bylaws, the COP has
contributed the following assets
to the fight for greater student
involvement in setting educational
priorities:
• A $1,500 cash loan from the
COP expense account, authorized
last Monday afternoon by COP
member Miguel Marquez, to be
used if needed as bail for students
arrested in the May 15 takeover
of University President Donald
Kennedy's office;
• A "temporary" allowance of
$285 from the COP expense ac
count to cover towing and repair
costs of a van used by students
to block the police bus containing
the arrested students last Mon
day;
• At least $75 from the COP
expense account for production
and photocopying of Agenda for
Action fliers; and
• The arrests of two current
COP members, David Brown and
Stacey Leyton, and the arrests of
two COP-elect members, Brown
and Ingrid Nava.

"It's not like it's any surprise
that the COP is supporting [the
Agenda for Action]," Brown said
in an interview yesterday. "We got
elected to do everything in our
power to advance these issues. I'm
proud of us using our resources."
According to Brown, all the cur
rent and newly elected COP mem
bers support the goals of the
Agenda for Action coalition. As
representatives of the student
body, Brown said, "We'd be ir
responsible and unaccountable if
we didn't take a stand."
Brown cited a straw poll taken
earlier in the year as an example
of general student support behind
the issues advocated by the coa
lition. For instance, Brown said,
80 percent of the student body
surveyed said they supported the
development of ethnic studies.
According to Leyton, "The main
thing is you've got to be account
able to the students." Leyton said
her COP slate ran on a platform
which was very clear about its
political agenda.
The COP, Brown said, is willing
to do "whatever it takes" to bring
such changes about.
Getting the bail money
While 40 of the students who
had been arrested in the takeover
last Monday sat handcuffed on
the police bus, Marquez ran to
the COP business office, where
he authorized the removal of
$1,500 from the COP expense ac
count.
He said he intended to use the
money "as a last resort," if bail
needed to be posted for arrested
students and enough money could
not be collected from other
sources.
"I didn't want to see the stu
dents spend the night in jail be
cause they're not criminals," Mar
quez said. "People didn't deserve
to be where they were at."
Marquez said he and COP
member Canetta Ivy felt particu
larly obliged to bail out Brown
and Leyton, who had both been
arrested.
Marquez participated in the oc
cupation of Kennedy's office, but
he said he left the building before
police began making arrests.
The COP expense account from
which Marquez withdrew the
$1,500 is a specified line-item ac
count which covers various COP
expenditures, including office sup
plies, photocopying expenses, tele
phone service and COP project ex
penses. The ASSU budgeted
$4,325 into the account at the
beginning of the year, according
to ASSU records. ASSU Admin
istrative Manager Sheilon King
said yesterday that about $3,000
currently remains in the account.
'Free reign' over account
According to ASSU Senate
Chair David Porter, COP mem
bers have "pretty much free
reign" over their expense account.
According to King, members are
"allowed to do anything they want
[with their account] as long as
it's benefitting the ASSU/'
The ASSU Bylaws contain no
explicit restrictions on use of the
COP expense account.
According to King, while remov
ing such large amounts from the

COP expense account is not a com
mon practice, Marquez "went
through the right procedures" in
obtaining the $1,500.
According to Marquez, the
money he took from the COP ac
count was considered a loan,
which he would have returned to
the account even if it had been
used as bail. Because the students
on the bus were released on site
and not taken to jail, bail was not
needed.
If the money had been used for
bail, Marquez said, the COP
would have conducted a fund
raiser or collected personal con
tributions to replace what was
taken from the COP account.
"(The money) was expected
back and came back," Marquez
said.
Marquez returned the money
the following day.
An additional precaution in
ASSU policy wo; Id have held
Marquez personally responsible
for the funds if they were not
returned, he said.
According to Brown, the COP
has made it a general policy this
year to loan student groups money
from the COP expense acount.
"Maybe we're too trusting or
whatever," Brown said. "We've
gotten the money back every time,
though."
The general practice, Brown
said, is to grant loans "since we
have access to the money."
Marquez said he arrived at the
ASSU business office at about
4:30 p.m., 30 minutes before the
business office closed for the day.
According to sophomore David
Kaufman, an assistant financial
manager who approved the with
drawal, Marquez was in a rush
to get the money and made it
clear that he was taking out a
"short-term loan."
According to Kaufman, "When
a student group needs a check
processed immediately due to cir
cumstances beyond its control, the
ASSU financial office will fre
quently go out of its way to help

that group."
Marquez removed the money
from the account with a financial
advance request form. According
to the ASSU Treasurer's Hand
book, "If circumstances preclude
the use of a purchase order or
payment," a financial advance
enables an individual to withdraw
money from his account before
turning in receipts.
According to Porter, the ASSU
used to have an account ear
marked for student bail costs.
Porter said the fund was set up
during the 1960s and eliminated
about three years ago because it
was not regarded as necessary.
Paying for van towing
The COP has taken $285 out
of its expense account — at least
temporarily — for towing costs of
a red Ford Club Wagon van which
was used to block the police bus
containing students arrested in
last Monday's protest.
The van is owned by the Uni
versity and used on a regular basis
by both the Stanford Safe Trans
portation Program (STOP), which
provides rides home for intox
icated passengers, and Barrio As
sistance, a tutoring program
which brings local youths to Stan
ford.
The van was also used by the
ASSU for its shuttle service prior
to spring break.
According to both Marquez and
Matthew Pretzer, the organizer
of STOP, how the van ended up
in the Quad last Monday is a mys
tery.
According to Pretzer, there are
three sets of keys for the van:
one which belongs to STOP, one
which belongs to Barrio Assis
tance, and a back-up set of keys
in his possession. Pretzer said he
"pretty much" has the final say
over who uses the van. Those who
do use it, he said, must check out
the set of keys from him.
Pretzer, a Sigma Chi Fraternity
member, said the STOP program
is run primarily by fraternity and

sorority members.
According to Marquez, a set of
van keys in the Sigma Chi house
was easily accessible to almost
anyone. Someone most likely took
the keys from Sigma Chi, drove
the van over to the Quad and ran
away, Marquez said. During the
protest, the air was let out of the
van's tires in an effort to make
it more difficult to move.
The STOP van was taken out
of concern for the students, Mar
quez said. "I don't blame that
person," Marquez said. The whole
thing was "obviously a spontane
ous reaction," he added.
The van was towed from the
Quad to Ellison's Towing, located
on Alma and Forest streets in Palo
Alto.
Pretzer said he was not aware

of the van's absence until Wed
nesday night, when it was sched
uled to be used for STOP. Pretzer
said Marquez offered to retrieve
the van the following day, and he
gave him the keys to do so.
Marquez said he offered to
retrieve the van so it would be
available for normal use by STOP
and Barrio Assistance on the
weekend.
Marquez said he paid for the
van with his own money, adding
that he has subsequently received
a temporary reimbursement from
the COP expense account. If funds
cannot be raised through other
means to pay the towing costs,
the COP may be stuck with the
costs, Marquez said.
According to Brown, "We were
just being responsible. We had the

resources available."
Charging: copying; costs
Both Brown and Leyton
charged photocopying costs of
Agenda for Action fliers to the
COP expense account last week,
according to ASSU records. Last
Tuesday, Brown made 2,000
copies at a cost of $60; two days
later Leyton made 500 copies at
a cost of $16.25. All copies were
made on ASSU copying machines.
According to Leyton, it is a reg
ular practice for individual COP
members to "do fliers for things
you support." She said that dur
ing the past year she produced
fliers on behalf of the Food Service
Task Force and against the Uni
versity's cutback of teaching as
sistants.

Stacey Leyton, and the arrests of
two COP-elect members, Brown
and Ingrid Nava.

"It's not like it's any surprise
that the COP is supporting [the
Agenda for Action]," Brown said
in an interview yesterday. "We got
elected to do everything in our
power to advance these issues. I'm
proud of us using our resources."
According to Brown, all the cur
rent and newly elected COP mem
bers support the goals of the
Agenda for Action coalition. As
representatives of the student
body, Brown said, "We'd be ir
responsible and unaccountable if
we didn't take a stand."
Brown cited a straw poll taken
earlier in the year as an example
of general student support behind
the issues advocated by the coa
lition. For instance, Brown said,
80 percent of the student body
surveyed said they supported the
development of ethnic studies.
According to Leyton, "The main
thing is you've got to be account
able to the students." Leyton said
her COP slate ran on a platform
which was very clear about its
political agenda.
The COP, Brown said, is willing
to do "whatever it takes" to bring
such changes about.
Getting the bail money
While 40 of the students who
had been arrested in the takeover
last Monday sat handcuffed on
the police bus, Marquez ran to
the COP business office, where
he authorized the removal of
$1,500 from the COP expense ac
count.
He said he intended to use the
money "as a last resort," if bail
needed to be posted for arrested
students and enough money could
not be collected from other
sources.
"I didn't want to see the stu
dents spend the night in jail be
cause they're not criminals," Mar
quez said. "People didn't deserve
to be where they were at."
Marquez said he and COP
member Canetta Ivy felt particu
larly obliged to bail out Brown
and Leyton, who had both been
arrested.
Marquez participated in the oc
cupation of Kennedy's office, but
he said he left the building before
police began making arrests.
The COP expense account from
which Marquez withdrew the
$1,500 is a specified line-item ac
count which covers various COP
expenditures, including office sup
plies, photocopying expenses, tele
phone service and COP project ex
penses. The ASSU budgeted
$4,325 into the account at the
beginning of the year, according
to ASSU records. ASSU Admin
istrative Manager Sheilon King
said yesterday that about $3,000
currently remains in the account.
'Free reign' over account
According to ASSU Senate
Chair David Porter, COP mem
bers have "pretty much free
reign" over their expense account.
According to King, members are
"allowed to do anything they want
[with their account] as long as
it's benefitting the ASSU/'
The ASSU Bylaws contain no
explicit restrictions on use of the
COP expense account.
According to King, while remov
ing such large amounts from the

COP expense account is not a com
mon practice, Marquez "went
through the right procedures" in
obtaining the $1,500.
According to Marquez, the
money he took from the COP ac
count was considered a loan,
which he would have returned to
the account even if it had been
used as bail. Because the students
on the bus were released on site
and not taken to jail, bail was not
needed.
If the money had been used for
bail, Marquez said, the COP
would have conducted a fund
raiser or collected personal con
tributions to replace what was
taken from the COP account.
"(The money) was expected
back and came back," Marquez
said.
Marquez returned the money
the following day.
An additional precaution in
ASSU policy wo; Id have held
Marquez personally responsible
for the funds if they were not
returned, he said.
According to Brown, the COP
has made it a general policy this
year to loan student groups money
from the COP expense acount.
"Maybe we're too trusting or
whatever," Brown said. "We've
gotten the money back every time,
though."
The general practice, Brown
said, is to grant loans "since we
have access to the money."
Marquez said he arrived at the
ASSU business office at about
4:30 p.m., 30 minutes before the
business office closed for the day.
According to sophomore David
Kaufman, an assistant financial
manager who approved the with
drawal, Marquez was in a rush
to get the money and made it
clear that he was taking out a
"short-term loan."
According to Kaufman, "When
a student group needs a check
processed immediately due to cir
cumstances beyond its control, the
ASSU financial office will fre
quently go out of its way to help

that group."
Marquez removed the money
from the account with a financial
advance request form. According
to the ASSU Treasurer's Hand
book, "If circumstances preclude
the use of a purchase order or
payment," a financial advance
enables an individual to withdraw
money from his account before
turning in receipts.
According to Porter, the ASSU
used to have an account ear
marked for student bail costs.
Porter said the fund was set up
during the 1960s and eliminated
about three years ago because it
was not regarded as necessary.
Paying for van towing
The COP has taken $285 out
of its expense account — at least
temporarily — for towing costs of
a red Ford Club Wagon van which
was used to block the police bus
containing students arrested in
last Monday's protest.
The van is owned by the Uni
versity and used on a regular basis
by both the Stanford Safe Trans
portation Program (STOP), which
provides rides home for intox
icated passengers, and Barrio As
sistance, a tutoring program
which brings local youths to Stan
ford.
The van was also used by the
ASSU for its shuttle service prior
to spring break.
According to both Marquez and
Matthew Pretzer, the organizer
of STOP, how the van ended up
in the Quad last Monday is a mys
tery.
According to Pretzer, there are
three sets of keys for the van:
one which belongs to STOP, one
which belongs to Barrio Assis
tance, and a back-up set of keys
in his possession. Pretzer said he
"pretty much" has the final say
over who uses the van. Those who
do use it, he said, must check out
the set of keys from him.
Pretzer, a Sigma Chi Fraternity
member, said the STOP program
is run primarily by fraternity and

sorority members.
According to Marquez, a set of
van keys in the Sigma Chi house
was easily accessible to almost
anyone. Someone most likely took
the keys from Sigma Chi, drove
the van over to the Quad and ran
away, Marquez said. During the
protest, the air was let out of the
van's tires in an effort to make
it more difficult to move.
The STOP van was taken out
of concern for the students, Mar
quez said. "I don't blame that
person," Marquez said. The whole
thing was "obviously a spontane
ous reaction," he added.
The van was towed from the
Quad to Ellison's Towing, located
on Alma and Forest streets in Palo
Alto.
Pretzer said he was not aware

of the van's absence until Wed
nesday night, when it was sched
uled to be used for STOP. Pretzer
said Marquez offered to retrieve
the van the following day, and he
gave him the keys to do so.
Marquez said he offered to
retrieve the van so it would be
available for normal use by STOP
and Barrio Assistance on the
weekend.
Marquez said he paid for the
van with his own money, adding
that he has subsequently received
a temporary reimbursement from
the COP expense account. If funds
cannot be raised through other
means to pay the towing costs,
the COP may be stuck with the
costs, Marquez said.
According to Brown, "We were
just being responsible. We had the

resources available."
Charging: copying; costs
Both Brown and Leyton
charged photocopying costs of
Agenda for Action fliers to the
COP expense account last week,
according to ASSU records. Last
Tuesday, Brown made 2,000
copies at a cost of $60; two days
later Leyton made 500 copies at
a cost of $16.25. All copies were
made on ASSU copying machines.
According to Leyton, it is a reg
ular practice for individual COP
members to "do fliers for things
you support." She said that dur
ing the past year she produced
fliers on behalf of the Food Service
Task Force and against the Uni
versity's cutback of teaching as
sistants.

COP member David Brown directs protesters Monday. Brown, current COP member Stacey Leyton
and future COP member Ingrid Nava were three of the 55 protesters arrested.
Over the course of the last
week, the Council of Presidents
has thrown its full weight behind
the Agenda for Action coalition,
offering not only the commitment
and support of individual COP
members — but also extending
its financial resources.
Using avenues sanctioned by
past precedent and not prohibited
by ASSU Bylaws, the COP has
contributed the following assets
to the fight for greater student
involvement in setting educational
priorities:
• A $1,500 cash loan from the
COP expense account, authorized
last Monday afternoon by COP
member Miguel Marquez, to be
used if needed as bail for students
arrested in the May 15 takeover
of University President Donald
Kennedy's office;
• A "temporary" allowance of
$285 from the COP expense ac
count to cover towing and repair
costs of a van used by students
to block the police bus containing
the arrested students last Mon
day;
• At least $75 from the COP
expense account for production
and photocopying of Agenda for
Action fliers; and
• The arrests of two current
COP members, David Brown and
Stacey Leyton, and the arrests of
two COP-elect members, Brown
and Ingrid Nava.

The COP, Brown said, is willing
to do "whatever it takes" to bring
such changes about.
Getting the bail money
While 40 of the students who
had been arrested in the takeover
last Monday sat handcuffed on
the police bus, Marquez ran to
the COP business office, where
he authorized the removal of
$1,500 from the COP expense ac
count.
He said he intended to use the
money "as a last resort," if bail
needed to be posted for arrested
students and enough money could
not be collected from other
sources.
"I didn't want to see the stu
dents spend the night in jail be
cause they're not criminals," Mar
quez said. "People didn't deserve
to be where they were at."
Marquez said he and COP
member Canetta Ivy felt particu
larly obliged to bail out Brown
and Leyton, who had both been
arrested.
Marquez participated in the oc
cupation of Kennedy's office, but
he said he left the building before
police began making arrests.
The COP expense account from
which Marquez withdrew the
$1,500 is a specified line-item ac
count which covers various COP
expenditures, including office sup
plies, photocopying expenses, tele
phone service and COP project ex
penses. The ASSU budgeted
$4,325 into the account at the
beginning of the year, according
to ASSU records. ASSU Admin
istrative Manager Sheilon King
said yesterday that about $3,000
currently remains in the account.
'Free reign' over account
According to ASSU Senate
Chair David Porter, COP mem
bers have "pretty much free
reign" over their expense account.
According to King, members are
"allowed to do anything they want
[with their account] as long as
it's benefitting the ASSU/'
The ASSU Bylaws contain no
explicit restrictions on use of the
COP expense account.
According to King, while remov
ing such large amounts from the

COP expense account is not a com
mon practice, Marquez "went
through the right procedures" in
obtaining the $1,500.
According to Marquez, the
money he took from the COP ac
count was considered a loan,
which he would have returned to
the account even if it had been
used as bail. Because the students
on the bus were released on site
and not taken to jail, bail was not
needed.
If the money had been used for
bail, Marquez said, the COP
would have conducted a fund
raiser or collected personal con
tributions to replace what was
taken from the COP account.
"(The money) was expected
back and came back," Marquez
said.
Marquez returned the money
the following day.
An additional precaution in
ASSU policy wo; Id have held
Marquez personally responsible
for the funds if they were not
returned, he said.
According to Brown, the COP
has made it a general policy this
year to loan student groups money
from the COP expense acount.
"Maybe we're too trusting or
whatever," Brown said. "We've
gotten the money back every time,
though."
The general practice, Brown
said, is to grant loans "since we
have access to the money."
Marquez said he arrived at the
ASSU business office at about
4:30 p.m., 30 minutes before the
business office closed for the day.
According to sophomore David
Kaufman, an assistant financial
manager who approved the with
drawal, Marquez was in a rush
to get the money and made it
clear that he was taking out a
"short-term loan."
According to Kaufman, "When
a student group needs a check
processed immediately due to cir
cumstances beyond its control, the
ASSU financial office will fre
quently go out of its way to help

that group."
Marquez removed the money
from the account with a financial
advance request form. According
to the ASSU Treasurer's Hand
book, "If circumstances preclude
the use of a purchase order or
payment," a financial advance
enables an individual to withdraw
money from his account before
turning in receipts.
According to Porter, the ASSU
used to have an account ear
marked for student bail costs.
Porter said the fund was set up
during the 1960s and eliminated
about three years ago because it
was not regarded as necessary.
Paying for van towing
The COP has taken $285 out
of its expense account — at least
temporarily — for towing costs of
a red Ford Club Wagon van which
was used to block the police bus
containing students arrested in
last Monday's protest.
The van is owned by the Uni
versity and used on a regular basis
by both the Stanford Safe Trans
portation Program (STOP), which
provides rides home for intox
icated passengers, and Barrio As
sistance, a tutoring program
which brings local youths to Stan
ford.
The van was also used by the
ASSU for its shuttle service prior
to spring break.
According to both Marquez and
Matthew Pretzer, the organizer
of STOP, how the van ended up
in the Quad last Monday is a mys
tery.
According to Pretzer, there are
three sets of keys for the van:
one which belongs to STOP, one
which belongs to Barrio Assis
tance, and a back-up set of keys
in his possession. Pretzer said he
"pretty much" has the final say
over who uses the van. Those who
do use it, he said, must check out
the set of keys from him.
Pretzer, a Sigma Chi Fraternity
member, said the STOP program
is run primarily by fraternity and

sorority members.
According to Marquez, a set of
van keys in the Sigma Chi house
was easily accessible to almost
anyone. Someone most likely took
the keys from Sigma Chi, drove
the van over to the Quad and ran
away, Marquez said. During the
protest, the air was let out of the
van's tires in an effort to make
it more difficult to move.
The STOP van was taken out
of concern for the students, Mar
quez said. "I don't blame that
person," Marquez said. The whole
thing was "obviously a spontane
ous reaction," he added.
The van was towed from the
Quad to Ellison's Towing, located
on Alma and Forest streets in Palo
Alto.
Pretzer said he was not aware

of the van's absence until Wed
nesday night, when it was sched
uled to be used for STOP. Pretzer
said Marquez offered to retrieve
the van the following day, and he
gave him the keys to do so.
Marquez said he offered to
retrieve the van so it would be
available for normal use by STOP
and Barrio Assistance on the
weekend.
Marquez said he paid for the
van with his own money, adding
that he has subsequently received
a temporary reimbursement from
the COP expense account. If funds
cannot be raised through other
means to pay the towing costs,
the COP may be stuck with the
costs, Marquez said.
According to Brown, "We were
just being responsible. We had the

resources available."
Charging: copying; costs
Both Brown and Leyton
charged photocopying costs of
Agenda for Action fliers to the
COP expense account last week,
according to ASSU records. Last
Tuesday, Brown made 2,000
copies at a cost of $60; two days
later Leyton made 500 copies at
a cost of $16.25. All copies were
made on ASSU copying machines.
According to Leyton, it is a reg
ular practice for individual COP
members to "do fliers for things
you support." She said that dur
ing the past year she produced
fliers on behalf of the Food Service
Task Force and against the Uni
versity's cutback of teaching as
sistants.

COP member David Brown directs protesters Monday. Brown, current COP member Stacey Leyton
and future COP member Ingrid Nava were three of the 55 protesters arrested.
Over the course of the last
week, the Council of Presidents
has thrown its full weight behind
the Agenda for Action coalition,
offering not only the commitment
and support of individual COP
members — but also extending
its financial resources.
Using avenues sanctioned by
past precedent and not prohibited
by ASSU Bylaws, the COP has
contributed the following assets
to the fight for greater student
involvement in setting educational
priorities:
• A $1,500 cash loan from the
COP expense account, authorized
last Monday afternoon by COP
member Miguel Marquez, to be
used if needed as bail for students
arrested in the May 15 takeover
of University President Donald
Kennedy's office;
• A "temporary" allowance of
$285 from the COP expense ac
count to cover towing and repair
costs of a van used by students
to block the police bus containing
the arrested students last Mon
day;
• At least $75 from the COP
expense account for production
and photocopying of Agenda for
Action fliers; and
• The arrests of two current
COP members, David Brown and
Stacey Leyton, and the arrests of
two COP-elect members, Brown
and Ingrid Nava.

"It's not like it's any surprise
that the COP is supporting [the
Agenda for Action]," Brown said
in an interview yesterday. "We got
elected to do everything in our
power to advance these issues. I'm
proud of us using our resources."
According to Brown, all the cur
rent and newly elected COP mem
bers support the goals of the
Agenda for Action coalition. As
representatives of the student
body, Brown said, "We'd be ir
responsible and unaccountable if
we didn't take a stand."
Brown cited a straw poll taken
earlier in the year as an example
of general student support behind
the issues advocated by the coa
lition. For instance, Brown said,
80 percent of the student body
surveyed said they supported the
development of ethnic studies.
According to Leyton, "The main
thing is you've got to be account
able to the students." Leyton said
her COP slate ran on a platform
which was very clear about its
political agenda.
The COP, Brown said, is willing
to do "whatever it takes" to bring
such changes about.
