UCMI report should
not limit change

I was one of the students who partic
ipated in the civil disobedience action
May 15. I chose to act because of the
sense of frustration I felt as the chair
of the Asian-American Students Associ
ation and as a member of the Univer
sity Committee on Minority Issues.
As AASA chair, I know of the 18-
year-long struggle for Asian-American
Studies to be included in the curricu
lum. This year I have listened to his
tory professors tell me that my history
is not legitimate, that my people have
not been important on a national level
and have not been in the country long
enough to warrant the study of our
history.
Administrators have told us that
they support the idea of Asian-
American Studies, but that they do not
support it enough to give the money to
create a tenure-track Asian-American
history professorship.
Other members of the UCMI com
mittee and I have worked for two
years to complete the report. We had
hopes that our efforts on this report
would be taken seriously as the first
step towards implementing a multicul
tural, inclusive community, and that
the UCMI report would serve as a
stepping stone for further changes.
The UCMI report was not meant to
be perfect. However, University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy has used the
UCMI Report as a means to limit
change, claiming that it should be the
"sole mechanism" for change.
Our intent was to get our needs and
demands heard by the administration.
However, the administration chose to
shut out our voice from the process of
prioritizing the UCMI recommen
dations and the process of prioritizing
our education at Stanford.

Agenda ignored 20
years of changes
In their May 18 viewpoint, Steve
Phillips and Danzy Senna began by
declaring the action "in the best tradi
tion of students and America,"and
comparing it to the civil rights protests
of the 19605. It is insulting to the
legacy of the civil rights struggle to
say that needlessly breaking the law to
"enrich all of Stanford" is as signifi
cant and worthy as trying to exercise
basic American freedoms such as the
right to 1 vote.
They exaggerated unfairly when they
said that the agenda set by students of
color 20 years ago "remains essentially

unfulfilled." The advances made since
then — the doubling of minority repre
sentation on campus, the creation of
the Program in Afro-American Studies
and the Chicano Fellows Program, the
establishment of the four ethnic theme
houses, to name but a few — are tre
mendous, and ignoring them belittles
the commendable efforts the people of
this University have made over the
last 20 years to bring about real and
lasting change at Stanford.
But Phillips and Senna went further
to make the untenable claim the"the
reality of institutional racism at Stan
ford has been exposed to all." The only
thing which has been exposed by this
incident is the brazen irresponsibility of
some students in our community.

Freshman, undeclared
Occupation hurt
multicultural cause
The occupation of University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy's office May 15
was a deplorable incident which under
mined an otherwise well-intentioned
cause. During the May 16 noon rally
in support of changes regarding multi
cultural education and faculty, several
of the demonstrators spoke of the
"power" which students had displayed
to the administration.
No doubt this is the same "power"
which a guerrilla feels upon taking
control of a jetliner, or the "power"
which any individual can acquire sim
ply by breaking the laws which other
members of the community rely on
and choose to respect.
By turning a set of reasonable issues
into the occasion for a miniature coup
d'etat, the demonstrators undermined
their credibility. No administrator in
his or her right mind would be willing
to concede to anything phrased as a
"demand" in such circumstances. Doing
so would only encourage the use of
similar tactics in the future, any time
students desire change.
We all chose Stanford as a partner,
not an adversary, when we freely
decided to enroll here.

Jackson supports
students' actions
Let me express my sincere congratu
lations to the students of Stanford on
their bold and dramatic action to make
multicultural education a reality. Over
the past few years, I have been contin
ually impressed with the courage, vi
sion and tenacity of the students at
Stanford University.
Their struggle to divest the Univer
sity from South Africa and their na-

tionally acclaimed efforts to change
their curriculum have inspired the
entire nation. The students are proving
that when young America comes alive,
America moves forward.
All across the country, students are
challenging the status quo and pushing
America into the future. From Howard
University, to the City University of
New York, to the University of Massa
chusetts at Amherst, young America
has come alive, and America is better
for it.
Keep up the struggle and fight the
good fight. Never surrender to pes
simism and despair. Keep on struggling
to make Stanford better. I am with the
students 100 percent. The Rainbow
Coalition supports them. The entire
nation salutes and is inspired by them.

4 Fanatic' protesters
wanted publicity
I am greatly disturbed by last week's
seizure of University President Donald
Kennedy's office. These students aren't
happy with the orderly, systematic
(though sometimes slow) way in which
great universities implement change.
No, these students want attention —
they want to be on TV, they want to
be heroes. Maybe they see themselves
as the next Dr. Martin Luther King,
Jr. They can't find a problem to
protest so they fabricate a problem.
If these students want to make a
contribution to society, then why don't
they spend their spare time feeding the
poor or running a shelter for the
homeless? The answer's quite simple.
That won't get them on the evening
news.

University officials should be free to
spend their time improving curriculum,
facilities, research programs, etc., in
stead of negotiating with a small group
of fanatics who locked the officials out
of their offices.

COP members took
advantage of ASSU
In all of the discussion about the
Agenda for Action's May 15 protest,
The Daily and others have so far ne
glected to report the fact that Council
of Presidents members David Brown
and Stacey Leyton abused the privilege

and trust awarded them by the stu
dents.
The protesters published fliers at
ASSU expense and commandeered the
University van (used by the ASSU and
STOP) to block the sheriffs bus. The
van was impounded, and STOP was
forced to use private cars for its safe
ride service Wednesday night.
It is conceivable that Brown, Leyton
and the others felt that the students,
having elected them, support their
actions and have no problem with the
agenda's use of ASSU resources. How
ever, I believe the protesters took ad
vantage of the ASSU and the students
to stage a divisive, disruptive event.
I urge students to require the

What if you were in
Kennedy's shoes?
What would you do if the following
sequence of events happened to you?
Monday: Your academic adviser calls.
He is concerned about your poor aca
demic performance. You agree to meet
on Thursday. In the days preceding
your meeting, you will prepare a re
sponse to his concerns.
Tuesday: University President Donald
Kennedy, Dean of Student Affairs
James Lyons, all your current and past
professors, various other administrators
and support staff, and your teaching
assistants all enter your dorm room,
not to sit in, but to "take over for a
while." They ask your roommate to
leave. Their demands are specific:
• You must attend all classes
• No more drinking on weekends
• You must turn in your homework
on time
• You must pay all outstanding
parking tickets
You explain that you will be meeting
with your adviser on Thursday to dis
cuss most of these matters, but the
group complains you are not acting
fast enough. You offer to meet with
them at a later time if they agree to
leave, but they want to meet immedi
ately, on their terms only. You decline
to meet on an emotional level, espe
cially with no time to prepare. Your
visitors refuse to leave.
What would you do? I know what I
would do: I'd call the police.
