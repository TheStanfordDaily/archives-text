According to accounts in
The Daily, "panty fever" hit
Stanford as more than 200
male students, predomi
nantly freshmen, staged a
panty raid on Roble Hall,
then an all-women's dorm.
The crowd surrounded
Roble at about 10 p.m., and
gained access to the dorm
through dining hall win
dows. After entering the
dorm, the men "stormed
through the corridors and
ransacked rooms in search
of lingerie." Meanwhile,
members of the crowd out

panties."

resented only one of dozens
