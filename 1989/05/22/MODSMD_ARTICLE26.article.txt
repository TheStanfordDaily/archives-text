# Making music with a different kind of keyboard
## Composers and engineers create melodies on computers at Knoll 
### Jim Hsu 
With its imposing architecture
and isolated hilltop location, the
Knoll at night emanates all the
spookiness of a haunted mansion.
One can almost envision mad sci
entists lurking within its shadowy
walls, unleashing mighty electri
cal forces and playing eerie music
on NeXT computers.
Music? NeXT computers?
The Knoll is, in feet, the head
quarters of CCRMA (pronounced
like "karma"), which might sound
like some secret James Bond
esque organization, but actually
is an acronym for the Center for
Computer Research in Music and
Acoustics.
Since its founding in 1975,
when it opened at a power lab
near the Stanford Linear Ac
celerator Center, the center has
been on the leading edge of tech
nological innovation in computer
music.
Progress in the computer music
field at Stanford actually began

earlier, in 1964, when Prof. John
Chowning, director of the center,
and Prof. Max Matthews, head of
research, started pioneering re
search.
The center is recognized inter
nationally, with visiting research
ers from as far away as Israel and
Poland. The French government
enlisted the aid of Chowning and
other center personnel in estab
lishing its own institution for
computer music studies.
A number of specialized music
courses are taught at the center.
While interested students can take
the classes through Stanford's
Music Department, the center it
self is interdisciplinary. The most
active departments at the center
are Music, Electrical Engineering,
Computer Science and Psychology.
One of the most exciting aspects
of the center is the active involve
ment of students in both indepen
dent and cooperative research.
According to administrative direc
tor Patti Wood, about 30 graduate
students work at the center.

"I wouldn't have come to Stan
ford had CCRMA not been here
for me to do my research in com
puter music," said Perry Cook, a
graduate student working towards
a Ph.D. in electrical engineering.
Code's projects have included
simulating human vocal produc
tion on the NeXT computer,
studying sound reverberations in
rooms and building custom brass
instruments.
There is a close relationship be
tween engineering developments
made at the Knoll and commercial

applications by co^ftfiiuaes.
Complies that are 7 7fidustrial
affiliates" of the centsiLincluding
Apple 'Computers, THrfiaha,
and Panasonic, support
through funding.
E|k"Fn* two years I was funded by
an affiliate. There's a direct link
in that direction," Cook said. "It
used to be a five year lag, now
the lag is even shorter for the
to turn our develop
ments into progress.
"NeXT has about six CCRMA
people employed, working on

music and signal processing
software, although they're not ac
tually an affiliate," Cook added.
An informational pamphlft
describes the center as "an inter
disciplinary facility where com
posers and researchers work
together using computerised
technology as a new musical and
artistic medium, and as a relearch
tool."
Todd Winkler, a graduate stu
dent completing a doctorate of
musical arts in composition, is one
of the composers. In April n9
premiered some of his electronic
pieces at a solo concert in New
York City, and haa also provided
demonstrations at Yale University
and Dartmouth College.
According to Winkler, "With
computer music there's an added
level of exploration, where you
find out what the computer can
do and how the technology
works."
Like the engineering students,
Winkler has at his disposal nu
merous synthesizers, terminals,
computers and electronic
equipment, although his foctfll is
more artistic than technical.
Still, the technical details, es
pecially knowledge of computer

programming, are essential to
Winkler's compositions. "My last
two pieces were written in MIDI
(Musical Instrument Digital Inter
face, a standard language used in
digitally processing music)," he
Vttftnkler is composing his third
piece, in assembly language on the
i titer's mainframe computer, a
process which he said is "more
time-con mming and a little less
spontaneq|ls" but more sophisti
cated than writing in MIDI on a
WacintoA.
ItoCl'va thought orchestrally, in
fftrrna awustic instruments, for
years. Now I'm learning to think
algoljlthmically, for mainframe
comptiters," Winkler said.
EJtery summer the center holds
a concert featuring original works
written by composers at the Knoll.
TJ>is year the concert will be held
Jttly 19 and 20 in Frost Amphi
theater. The music includes taped
>$hd live electronics.
,;> Four-week summer workshops
lire also offered at the center. This
summer the courses will be
"MIDI-Based Synthesis and Com
position" and "Synthesis and
Composition on a Large Com
puter System."

An informational pamphlft
describes the center as "an inter

posers and researchers work
together using computerised
technology as a new musical and
artistic medium, and as a relearch
tool."
Todd Winkler, a graduate stu

musical arts in composition, is one
of the composers. In April n9
premiered some of his electronic
pieces at a solo concert in New
York City, and haa also provided
demonstrations at Yale University
and Dartmouth College.
According to Winkler, "With
computer music there's an added
level of exploration, where you
find out what the computer can
do and how the technology
works."
Like the engineering students,
Winkler has at his disposal nu
merous synthesizers, terminals,
computers and electronic
equipment, although his foctfll is
more artistic than technical.
Still, the technical details, es
pecially knowledge of computer

programming, are essential to
Winkler's compositions. "My last
two pieces were written in MIDI
(Musical Instrument Digital Inter
face, a standard language used in
digitally processing music)," he
Vttftnkler is composing his third
piece, in assembly language on the
i titer's mainframe computer, a
process which he said is "more
time-con mming and a little less
spontaneq|ls" but more sophisti
cated than writing in MIDI on a
WacintoA.
ItoCl'va thought orchestrally, in
fftrrna awustic instruments, for
years. Now I'm learning to think
algoljlthmically, for mainframe
comptiters," Winkler said.
EJtery summer the center holds
a concert featuring original works
written by composers at the Knoll.

Jttly 19 and 20 in Frost Amphi

With its imposing architecture
and isolated hilltop location, the
Knoll at night emanates all the
spookiness of a haunted mansion.
One can almost envision mad sci
entists lurking within its shadowy
walls, unleashing mighty electri
cal forces and playing eerie music
on NeXT computers.
Music? NeXT computers?
The Knoll is, in feet, the head
quarters of CCRMA (pronounced
like "karma"), which might sound
like some secret James Bond
esque organization, but actually
is an acronym for the Center for
Computer Research in Music and
Acoustics.
Since its founding in 1975,
when it opened at a power lab
near the Stanford Linear Ac
celerator Center, the center has
been on the leading edge of tech
nological innovation in computer
music.
Progress in the computer music
field at Stanford actually began

earlier, in 1964, when Prof. John
Chowning, director of the center,
and Prof. Max Matthews, head of
research, started pioneering re
search.
The center is recognized inter
nationally, with visiting research
ers from as far away as Israel and
Poland. The French government
enlisted the aid of Chowning and
other center personnel in estab
lishing its own institution for
computer music studies.
A number of specialized music
courses are taught at the center.
While interested students can take
the classes through Stanford's
Music Department, the center it
self is interdisciplinary. The most
active departments at the center
are Music, Electrical Engineering,
Computer Science and Psychology.
One of the most exciting aspects
of the center is the active involve
ment of students in both indepen
dent and cooperative research.
According to administrative direc
tor Patti Wood, about 30 graduate
students work at the center.

"I wouldn't have come to Stan
ford had CCRMA not been here
for me to do my research in com
puter music," said Perry Cook, a
graduate student working towards
a Ph.D. in electrical engineering.
