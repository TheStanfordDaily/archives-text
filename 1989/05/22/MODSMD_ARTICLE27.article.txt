# Archives document highlights of black history at Stanford
##

A visitor to the Ujamaa House lounge
these days will find far more than a few
sofas and a T.V. Displayed alongside fliers
advertising the latest campus party are
old issues of black student newspapers
and books by noted black faculty mem
bers.
These items are part of the Ujamaa
Archives which was established in the
black theme dorm last year to "enhance
the presence of blacks here and augment
the lack of black role models at Stanford,"
according to Ujamaa Resident Fellow Mi
chael Britt.
"We're hoping that the archives cele
brate the black community here at Stan
ford," Britt said.
The idea to establish the archives began
winter quarter last year. According to
Britt, it was conceived as a way for the
black community to be involved in the
Stanford Centennial celebration of the
University's accomplishments.
Britt and other residents of Ujamaa

submitted a proposal to the Centennial
Program Fund committee, and last spring
received approval and $6,000 from the
committee to start the archives.
The archives will be divided up into
various parts, including an audio-visual
room, a library and displays.
The library will include several books
written by black faculty members, such
as St. Clair Drake, professor emeritus of
anthropology, and James Gibbs, chair of
the Anthropology Department.
In addition, the library will contain
back issues of the black community news
papers, "The Real News" and"The
Colonist." These papers, donated by Ken
nell Jackson, associate professor of his
tory and African-Afro American Studies,
began as weekly papers published in the
1960s by black Stanford students. Today,
"The Real News" comes out once a quar
ter.
One item in the display case is a plaque
entitled "The Academic Wall of Fame"
which cites outstanding members of the
black community at Stanford.
According to Britt, "At the end of the

year there is an award ceremony. The
black students and advisers who are listed
on the plaque are then recognized for
their contributions to the University."
Ujamaa has more award recipients for
such things as public service than any
other dorm, Britt added.
"We hope that our Wall of Fame will
continue to fill some of the gaps that
currently exist at Stanford of what is
really happening in the black communi
ty," Britt said.
Past award recipients include sopho
more Raina Jackson, who completed a
linguistics research project with Prof.
John Rickford.
"We hope the archives will encourage
black students to give something back,"
Britt said. "No one can celebrate our
successes as well as we will."
As intern to the archives last summer,
sophomore Louis Jackson visited campus
departments and talked with black faculty
members to see what they wanted to
donate to the archives.
"In addition, I went to the University
archives at Green (Library) and asked if

they had anything to donate on black
history," said Jackson, an Ujamaa theme
assistant and vice-chair of external affairs
for the Black Student Union.
From these donations "a list was gen
erated to figure out what could go into
an archive," Jackson said. During fall
quarter, Jackson and other Ujamaa house
members collected the donated items
from black faculty, alumni members and
the Green Library Archives.
Although the Ujamaa Archives had its
opening ceremony last winter quarter,
there is still a lot of work to be done on
the project. "Right now we have all this
great stuff, but we have to make it very
professional," Jackson said.
A small fraction of the materials
donated to the archives are on display in
glass cases in the Ujamaa lounge, but
most are stored in upstairs closets at
Ujamaa.
"We're in the process of getting a room
(in Ujamaa) and fixing it up with several
of the donations," Jackson said. "Hope
fully that will be done by next fall."
Besides aiding in the establishment of

the archives, Britt and his wife, Rosalyn
have helped enhance the strong sense of
community within Ujamma during their
four years as the dorm's RFs.
According to junior Kevin Anderson, a
resident assistant in Ujamaa, Britt has
"made the dorm a part of his family,"
and was integral in establishing the ar
chives and"The Academic Wall of Fame."
The creation of Ujamaa, which means
"familihood" in Swahili, was meant to
provide an environment in which black
students could maintain some type of psy
chological and academic well-being.
The house's first location was in Wilbur
Hall, but there were problems with space
inadequacy. In 1970 it moved to the base
ment of Roble Hall. However, again there
were problems and the house finally
moved to its present location in Lagunita
Hall in 1975.
The Britts, who both studied at Stan
ford, will be leaving their post as RFs
next year and will be replaced by Rachel
Bagby, assistant director of the Martin
Luther King Jr. Papers Project.
