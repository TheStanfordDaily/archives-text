## Netters advance to semifinals 
### Cameron Macky Senior staff writer 
ATHENS, Ga. — Dan Turbow
watched and waited for almost six hours
yesterday, rooting for his teammates
during the men's tennis team's NCAA
quarterfinal match against Louisiana
State.
Finally, after all the singles matches
were done, Turbow got his chance to
play. The score was Stanford 4, LSU 3,
and Turbow, along with doubles partner
Barry Richards, was about to face his
first NCAA test.
And he passed — with flying colors.
Turbow and Richards' 6-4, 6-4 win at
No. 3 doubles gave Stanford a 5-3 vic
tory and a berth in the NCAA semifinals
today against South Carolina at 10 a.m.
EDT.

"Dan just played tremendously,"
Stanford Asst. Coach John Whitlinger
said. "This was his first NCAA match,
and he just did everything right."
The wait for the match to start,
though, almost did Turbow in."I was
super-nervous watching," Turbow said.
"I don't think I'll watch the singles
tomorrow, because at the start of my
match today I was just drained."
Turbow had good reason to be
drained, because the Cardinal-Tiger
singles matches were a showcase of ex
citing tennis — for the most part. The
schools split the six contests, with Stan
ford scoring three straight-set wins and
LSU winning three tense marathons.
Martin Blackman continued his
NCAA excellence — the sophomore was
4-0 at the championships last season —
with a 6-4, 7-6 (8-6) win over Donni
"Mr. Intensity" Leaycraft at No. 2.
Leaycraft, who's going to have a heart
attack before he's 30 if he's not careful,
spent almost as much time yelling at
himself as playing against Blackman.
In the first set, Blackman was serving
so well that Leaycraft couldn't even get
the ball back across the net most of the
time. "Put the serve in play!" he yelled
in the middle of one game.
After falling behind 5-3 in the first,
Leaycraft turned to the crowd and asked
"What do I have to do?" Apparently no
one had an answer. Leaycraft came on
in the second set, but Blackman was

able to hold him off with some incredible
shots.
Alex O'Brien and Glenn Solomon had
no problems in their matches. O'Brien,
facing Tom Furukrantz at No. 4, cruised
to a 6-2, 6-1 win, while Solomon was
bothered more by some dust on a con
tact lens than by Steve Vasquez.
Leading 4-1 in the first set, Solomon
had to call time to wash his contact out.
"That's never happened to me
before," Solomon said. If he's super
stitious, he'd better hope it happens
again, because he went on to win 6-1,
6-0.
The other three matches turned into
drawn-out, three-set battles, all of which
were won by LSU. Jeff Tarango, Jeff

Cathrall and Richards each took one-set
leads in their respective matches, but
couldn't hold on.
Tarango was on fire during his first
set against Johan Kjellsten, serving
beautifully and not giving the Swede a
chance to get in the match. Tarango
went to pieces in the second, though,
and found himself serving down 1-2 in
the final set.
A drop shot just out of Kjellsten's
reach gave the game to Tarango, who
then fell to his knees and pounded the
ground twice. "I can't believe it's two-all
in the third," he 1 said to Stanford Coach
