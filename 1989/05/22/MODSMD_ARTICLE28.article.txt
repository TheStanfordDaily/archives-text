## Netters advance to semifinals 
### Cameron Macky Senior staff writer 
ATHENS, Ga. — Dan Turbow
watched and waited for almost six hours
yesterday, rooting for his teammates
during the men's tennis team's NCAA
quarterfinal match against Louisiana
State.
Finally, after all the singles matches
were done, Turbow got his chance to
play. The score was Stanford 4, LSU 3,
and Turbow, along with doubles partner
Barry Richards, was about to face his
first NCAA test.
And he passed — with flying colors.
Turbow and Richards' 6-4, 6-4 win at
No. 3 doubles gave Stanford a 5-3 vic
tory and a berth in the NCAA semifinals
today against South Carolina at 10 a.m.
EDT.

"Dan just played tremendously,"
Stanford Asst. Coach John Whitlinger
said. "This was his first NCAA match,
and he just did everything right."
The wait for the match to start,
though, almost did Turbow in."I was
super-nervous watching," Turbow said.
"I don't think I'll watch the singles
tomorrow, because at the start of my
match today I was just drained."
Turbow had good reason to be
drained, because the Cardinal-Tiger
singles matches were a showcase of ex
citing tennis — for the most part. The
schools split the six contests, with Stan
ford scoring three straight-set wins and
LSU winning three tense marathons.
Martin Blackman continued his
NCAA excellence — the sophomore was
4-0 at the championships last season —
with a 6-4, 7-6 (8-6) win over Donni
"Mr. Intensity" Leaycraft at No. 2.
Leaycraft, who's going to have a heart
attack before he's 30 if he's not careful,
spent almost as much time yelling at
himself as playing against Blackman.
In the first set, Blackman was serving
so well that Leaycraft couldn't even get
the ball back across the net most of the
time. "Put the serve in play!" he yelled
in the middle of one game.
After falling behind 5-3 in the first,
Leaycraft turned to the crowd and asked
"What do I have to do?" Apparently no
one had an answer. Leaycraft came on
in the second set, but Blackman was

able to hold him off with some incredible
shots.
Alex O'Brien and Glenn Solomon had
no problems in their matches. O'Brien,
facing Tom Furukrantz at No. 4, cruised
to a 6-2, 6-1 win, while Solomon was
bothered more by some dust on a con
tact lens than by Steve Vasquez.
Leading 4-1 in the first set, Solomon
had to call time to wash his contact out.
"That's never happened to me
before," Solomon said. If he's super
stitious, he'd better hope it happens
again, because he went on to win 6-1,
6-0.
The other three matches turned into
drawn-out, three-set battles, all of which
were won by LSU. Jeff Tarango, Jeff

Cathrall and Richards each took one-set
leads in their respective matches, but
couldn't hold on.
Tarango was on fire during his first
set against Johan Kjellsten, serving
beautifully and not giving the Swede a
chance to get in the match. Tarango
went to pieces in the second, though,
and found himself serving down 1-2 in
the final set.
A drop shot just out of Kjellsten's
reach gave the game to Tarango, who
then fell to his knees and pounded the
ground twice. "I can't believe it's two-all
in the third," he 1 said to Stanford Coach

Martin Blackman defeated Donni Leaycroft of LSU 6-4, 7-6 (8-6) in yesterday's NCAA
quarterfinals in Athens, Ga. Blackman and his teammates will play South Carolina
today in the semifinals.

Dick Gould, obviously less than
thrilled with his play.
Six games later, still on serve,
Tarango probably couldn't believe
he was down a match point. And
he also probably couldn't believe
it when his next forehand sailed
wide, giving a break and the 2-6,
6-2, 6-4 win to Kjellsten.
Just minutes before, Cathrall
had dropped a 2-6, 7-6 (8-6), 6-4
decision to Roland So. The match
was marked by some extracurric
ular activity (see accompanying
story), but had at least one good
sign for Stanford.
"I didn't feel my wrist at all,"
Cathrall said, referring to the in
jury that has bothered him for
the last month. Cathrall was more
animated than he has been in a
while, but it wasn't enough.
Richards, who has been solid at
No. 6 all year, finally suffered a
letdown, squandering two match
points before falling 2-6, 6-4, 7-6
(7-5) to Mario Pacheco.
Like Cathrall and Tarango, Ric
hards didn't have his serve broken
until midway through the second
set, when Pacheco broke for a 4-3
lead. Richards broke right back,
but then lost eight straight points
and the set.
Richards broke Pacheco in the
fourth game of the third set and
went up 4-1, but gave the break
back two games later.
After holding for 5-4, Richards
had two match points at 3-2. His
first chance was gone when a
forehand shot missed the right
corner by, oh, a centimeter, and
he put a backhand in the net on
his next try.
In the tiebreaker, Pacheco rode
two huge serves to his first match
point, and when Richards hit a
shot wide, LSU had a singles split.
Cathrall and Blackman worked
Kjellsten and Furukrantz 6-1, 7-6
(7-1) to set up Turbow and Ric
hards' clincher.
So Dan, how nervous were you?
"I was just hyperventilating in the
final game," Turbow said. Oh, no
big deal. The match was marred
by an incident in the third set
(again, see related story) but was
never in doubt. In fact, the only
time the Cardinal pair came close
to being broken was in the final
game, with Turbow serving.
LSU was up 3-1, but a Richards
winner and a wide service return
gave Stanford its first match
point. After a rally that saw Tur
bow make five volleys and race
back to the baseline twice to run
down lobs, So put a backhand in
the net, and Stanford was in the
semis.
The Cardinal earned its quar
terfinal berth on the strength of
a 5-1 win over Miami that was
noteworthy only for the thun
derstorm that sent the match in
doors with Stanford up 2-1.
Blackman and Cathrall had
both won in straight sets before
the rain came, and O'Brien was
up 4-1 in his first set when
Miami's Tommy Phanco de
faulted because of a shoulder in
jury.
With the score 3-1, Solomon and
Richards clinched the victory with
a pair of three-set wins. Solomon's
6-2, 1-6, 6-3 decision was his first
NCAA win in four tries.
Card notes
The other three top seeds — UCLA,
California, and UC-Irvine — all bit
the red Georgia clay yesterday. The
remaining semifinal schools are South
Carolina, Texas Christian and host
Georgia. Georgia and TCU will meet
at 2:00 p.m. today. Don't look for the
Horned Frogß to overcome several
thousand woofing Dawg fans.

first NCAA test.
And he passed — with flying colors.
Turbow and Richards' 6-4, 6-4 win at
No. 3 doubles gave Stanford a 5-3 vic
tory and a berth in the NCAA semifinals
today against South Carolina at 10 a.m.
EDT.

"Dan just played tremendously,"
Stanford Asst. Coach John Whitlinger
said. "This was his first NCAA match,
and he just did everything right."
The wait for the match to start,
though, almost did Turbow in."I was
super-nervous watching," Turbow said.
"I don't think I'll watch the singles
tomorrow, because at the start of my
match today I was just drained."
Turbow had good reason to be
drained, because the Cardinal-Tiger
singles matches were a showcase of ex
citing tennis — for the most part. The
schools split the six contests, with Stan
ford scoring three straight-set wins and
LSU winning three tense marathons.
Martin Blackman continued his
NCAA excellence — the sophomore was
4-0 at the championships last season —
with a 6-4, 7-6 (8-6) win over Donni
"Mr. Intensity" Leaycraft at No. 2.
Leaycraft, who's going to have a heart
attack before he's 30 if he's not careful,
spent almost as much time yelling at
himself as playing against Blackman.
In the first set, Blackman was serving
so well that Leaycraft couldn't even get
the ball back across the net most of the
time. "Put the serve in play!" he yelled
in the middle of one game.
After falling behind 5-3 in the first,
Leaycraft turned to the crowd and asked
"What do I have to do?" Apparently no
one had an answer. Leaycraft came on
in the second set, but Blackman was

able to hold him off with some incredible
shots.
Alex O'Brien and Glenn Solomon had
no problems in their matches. O'Brien,
facing Tom Furukrantz at No. 4, cruised
to a 6-2, 6-1 win, while Solomon was
bothered more by some dust on a con
tact lens than by Steve Vasquez.
Leading 4-1 in the first set, Solomon
had to call time to wash his contact out.
"That's never happened to me
before," Solomon said. If he's super
stitious, he'd better hope it happens
again, because he went on to win 6-1,
6-0.
The other three matches turned into
drawn-out, three-set battles, all of which
were won by LSU. Jeff Tarango, Jeff

Cathrall and Richards each took one-set
leads in their respective matches, but
couldn't hold on.
Tarango was on fire during his first
set against Johan Kjellsten, serving
beautifully and not giving the Swede a
chance to get in the match. Tarango
went to pieces in the second, though,
and found himself serving down 1-2 in
the final set.
A drop shot just out of Kjellsten's
reach gave the game to Tarango, who
then fell to his knees and pounded the
ground twice. "I can't believe it's two-all
in the third," he 1 said to Stanford Coach

Martin Blackman defeated Donni Leaycroft of LSU 6-4, 7-6 (8-6) in yesterday's NCAA
quarterfinals in Athens, Ga. Blackman and his teammates will play South Carolina
today in the semifinals.

Dick Gould, obviously less than
thrilled with his play.
Six games later, still on serve,
Tarango probably couldn't believe
he was down a match point. And
he also probably couldn't believe
it when his next forehand sailed
wide, giving a break and the 2-6,
6-2, 6-4 win to Kjellsten.
Just minutes before, Cathrall
had dropped a 2-6, 7-6 (8-6), 6-4
decision to Roland So. The match
was marked by some extracurric
ular activity (see accompanying
story), but had at least one good
sign for Stanford.
"I didn't feel my wrist at all,"
Cathrall said, referring to the in
jury that has bothered him for
the last month. Cathrall was more
animated than he has been in a
while, but it wasn't enough.
Richards, who has been solid at
No. 6 all year, finally suffered a
letdown, squandering two match
points before falling 2-6, 6-4, 7-6
(7-5) to Mario Pacheco.
Like Cathrall and Tarango, Ric
hards didn't have his serve broken
until midway through the second
set, when Pacheco broke for a 4-3
lead. Richards broke right back,
but then lost eight straight points
and the set.
Richards broke Pacheco in the
fourth game of the third set and
went up 4-1, but gave the break
back two games later.
After holding for 5-4, Richards
had two match points at 3-2. His
first chance was gone when a
forehand shot missed the right
corner by, oh, a centimeter, and
he put a backhand in the net on
his next try.
In the tiebreaker, Pacheco rode
two huge serves to his first match
point, and when Richards hit a
shot wide, LSU had a singles split.
Cathrall and Blackman worked
Kjellsten and Furukrantz 6-1, 7-6
(7-1) to set up Turbow and Ric
hards' clincher.
So Dan, how nervous were you?
"I was just hyperventilating in the
final game," Turbow said. Oh, no
big deal. The match was marred
by an incident in the third set
(again, see related story) but was
never in doubt. In fact, the only
time the Cardinal pair came close
to being broken was in the final
game, with Turbow serving.
LSU was up 3-1, but a Richards
winner and a wide service return
gave Stanford its first match
point. After a rally that saw Tur
bow make five volleys and race
back to the baseline twice to run
down lobs, So put a backhand in
the net, and Stanford was in the
semis.
The Cardinal earned its quar
terfinal berth on the strength of
a 5-1 win over Miami that was
noteworthy only for the thun
derstorm that sent the match in
doors with Stanford up 2-1.
Blackman and Cathrall had
both won in straight sets before
the rain came, and O'Brien was
up 4-1 in his first set when
Miami's Tommy Phanco de
faulted because of a shoulder in
jury.
With the score 3-1, Solomon and
Richards clinched the victory with
a pair of three-set wins. Solomon's
6-2, 1-6, 6-3 decision was his first
NCAA win in four tries.

The other three top seeds — UCLA,
California, and UC-Irvine — all bit
