## 
### Greg Gottesman Staff writer 
Everything went pretty much as expected
this weekend in the 1989 Great
Western/Pacific-10 Track and Field Cham
pionship at Stanford Stadium.
Only problem was "everything as ex
pected" saw Stanford finishing eighth out
of eight teams in the men's competition
and seventh in the women's bracket.

"It was a great meet," Stanford Coach
Brooks Johnson said. "It's too bad we came
to spectate and not to participate. Next
year we are going to try to go from spec
tating to participating."
Despite the low finish, the Cardinal did
see some bright spots. Junior Brian
Boggess became the only Stanford male to
qualify for this year's NCAA nationals with
a throw of 59-BV2 in the shot put. The
toss, a personal record for Boggess, earned
him fifth place and two team points. Junior
Andy Papathanassiou's throw of 58-4 Vi
gave him seventh in the competition.
Junior Peter Kolotouros, who was ex
pected to come in last in the 110-meter
hurdles, took a surprising third with a time
of 14.15. "It always nice to come in as the
underdog and do well," Kolotouros said.
"No one ever takes me into account. 1 hey
haven't all year. Overall, I was just really
happy to have one of my best meets here
at Stanford."
Along with Kolotouros' third-place
finish, sophomore Dave Strang's second
place finish in the 800 meters highlighted
the second day of competition for the ( ar
dinal. Strang crossed the finish line at
1:49.91, ahead of defending Pac-10 cham
pion Doug Herron of Arizona and just be
hind Olympic semi-finalist Ibrahim Okash
of USC.
Strang, however, was not totally
satisified, guessing that a strong wind
might have kept him from qualifying for
NCAA nationals. "I wanted to qualify
today," Strang said. "But the first lap was
too slow, and there was no way 1 was going
to go out there in the wind alone.
Strang picked up eight points for the
Cardinal, which finished the meet with 37.
UCLA won the men's team title with 153.
In the 3,000 meter steeplechase, Steve
Miller took fifth with a time of 8:48.52,
just .52 seconds away from an NCAA qual
ifying time. Jason Martin came in ninth
at 9:03.49.
With a jump of sophomore John
Hopkins showed why he is considered a
part of Stanford's track future. Hop
kins' leap gave him third in the high jump
and the team six points.
Sophomore Marcus Hickerson met ex
pectations with a fourth-place finish in the

long jump. "I jumped well, but I was ex
pecting to I'R (set a personal record),"
Hickerson said. "1 also wanted to qualify
for nationals. What 1 wasn't expecting was
the two guys in front of me to PR by over
a foot."
Senior I).D. Harris, who finished fourth
in the decathlon this past Tuesday, took
seventh in the pole vault with a mark of
14-IVV
In the discus, senior Glenn Schneider
hurled his way to sixth with a mark of
183-4. I'apathanassiou, who took seventh
in the shot put, took seventh in the discus
as well.
Also of mention, junior Bill Crowley took
ninth in the 1,500 meters while senior
Henry Green placed eighth in the triple
jump. The men's 400-meter relay team of
sophomore James Cramton, Strang,
Kolotouros and Hickerson finished fourth
with a time of 3:12.38, only .26 seconds
behind the second place team, Oregon.
On the women's side, the story was
pretty much the same. "We did not exceed
our expectations," Johnson said. "We could
have at least done better at home. It is
usually worth about 15 or 20 points when
you are sitting in your own bedroom and
eating your own food. This time it swung
the wrong way."
Freshman sensation Chryste Gaines, who
had the best time in the 100 meters en
tering the meet, ran well but finished third.
Her time of 11.77 was slightly over her
entering mark of 11.54. Gaines, who has
not yet met the NCAA qualifying mark for
the 100 meters, said she might attempt
again at the Jenner Meet next weekend in
San Jose.
Senior Patty Purpur, national qualifier
in the shotput and discus, grabbed second
in the shotput and fifth in the discus.
Sophomore Debbie Malueg garnered
eighth and ninth in the shotput and discus,
respectively.
In the triple jump and long jump, fresh
man Jackie Kdwards and junior Venessa
Henlon traded third place finishes. Kd
wards took third in the long jump with a
personal best of 20-Vi and also grabbed an
impressive fifth in the triple jump with
another personal best of 39-Vfc. Henlon, on
the other hand, finished third in the triple
jump with a leap of 39-7V4.
In the high jump, juniors Wendy Allen
and Peggy Odita tied for sixth with a mark
of 5-7. Odita took third in the heptathlon
earlier in the week.
Senior Krica Wheeler, last year's javelin
I'ac-10 champion, took fourth this year with
a throw of 165-6. Wheeler already had
qualified for nationals, which will be held
in Provo, Utah early this June.
Freshman distance runner Jodie Billotta
grabbed sixth in the 1,500 meters, while
sophomore Melanie Bloch took seventh in
the 3,000 meters and 10th in the 5,000
meters.
Also of note, the 400-meter relay team
of Henlon, Kdwards, D'Layne Kerr and
Gaines finished sixth.
