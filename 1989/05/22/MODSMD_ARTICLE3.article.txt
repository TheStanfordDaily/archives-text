## 
### Frank Quaratiello Editorial staff 
SAN FRANCISCO - More
than 100 Stanford students joined
other student protesters here in
a non-violent demonstration Sat
urday morning to show their sup
port for the students in Beijing
who are demonstrating for democ
racy.
After hearing that the Chinese
government declared martial law
in sections of Beijing Friday, Stan
ford Chinese students gathered
and signed a petition declaring
that they would no longer recog
nize or cooperate with the current
communist regime in China under
Deng Xiaoping and Li Peng.
The declaration asks Chinese
students and scholars, foreign gov

ernments and the People's Liber
ation Army to band together and
refuse to cooperate with the Chi
nese government "unless the
regime lifts the martial law and
unconditionally accepts students'
demands."
It further demands that the
Deng-Li regime resign and that a
coalition government be formed
consisting of pro-democratic and
pro-reform leaders from both in
side and outside the Chinese Com
munist Party.
Yin Lujun, a religious studies
graduate student who drafted the
declaration, said, despite media
speculation, students in Beijing
know what they want.
"The students are mature. They
understand what democracy
means and they are fighting for

their basic human rights," Lujun
said.
Students presented this decla
ration along with other letters of
protest to consulate officials here
Saturday.
The protest began in front of
the consulate and six student
protest leaders were quickly led
inside by consulate officials to
voice their concerns.
Xueguang Zhou, a sociology
graduate student who presented
the Stanford declaration to con
sulate officials, said the officials
were very reserved.
Just before the student repre
sentatives entered the consulate,
a report buzzed through the
crowd that the Houston, Texas

Deng-Li government.
Zhou said he suggested to the
San Francisco consulate officials
that they do the same, but that
the officials remained silent. The
officials did, however, accept the
Stanford declaration and other

The officials said they under
stood the protesters' position, but
the officials did not take any ac
tion.
The consulate here is particu
larly crucial because San Fran
cisco has the largest Chinese-
American population in the
United States.

After meeting with consulate
officials, the students marched
down Post Street to Chinatown
for a rally.
About 500 students, from as far
away as the University of Utah
and the University of Oregon,
converged for one of a series of
demonstrations in major U.S.
cities such as Los Angeles, Wash
ington, D.C., Chicago and New
York.
For many students in the crowd,
protesting was a new experience.
Also, the protest was unique be
cause Chinese students from
Taiwan, Hong Kong and Sin
gapore as well as students from
the People's Republic of China
joined together.
The enthusiastic marchers said
they could feel a big change on
the horizon.

"The Chinese government is
digging its own grave. It may take
two or three years, but the gov
ernment will go down. Declaring
martial law was a stupid deci
sion," Daqing Zhao, a chemistry
graduate student, said.
Lujun said, "the days of Deng's
regime are numbered."
If this prediction does not come
true, Chinese Stanford students
could be in over their heads.
"I don't think the government
can last, but if it does, students
who signed the declaration are
prepared to endure sufferings and
punishments when they return to
China," Lujun said.
Weijia Wang, an electrical engi
neering graduate student, agreed.
His brother, a sophomore at
Beijing University, is one of the
3,000 hunger strikers in Tianan
men Square.
