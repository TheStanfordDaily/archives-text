# Talented freshmen compete well, give teams a bright future

Most freshmen spend the big meets
watching from the sidelines.
Last weekend, however, several
freshmen on Stanford's women's track
team turned conventional logic on its
head with strong efforts at the Pacific
10 Conference Championships despite
the Cardinal's seventh place finish.
Successfully making their Pac-10
debuts were Chryste Gaines and
Jackie Kdwards, who had third place
finishes in the 100 meters and long
jump, respectively. Both also ran a leg
on the sixth place 400-meter relay
team.
Other freshmen on the women's
Pac-10 team included Jodi Bilotta,
sixth in a competitive 1,500-meter

race, and d'Layne Kerr, who ran the
400 meters and the 400-meter relay.
Between them, they accounted for
a large share of the team's 42.66 total
points. Looking to the future, this
talented group will be expected to con
tribute even more.
Jackie Kdwards led the freshman
with a third place finish in the long
jump and fifth in the triple jump.
Kdwards broke her previous best in
the long jump by an inch and a half,
catching a barely legal breeze and sail
ing 20-Vi.
This year has not always been easy,
however, as many encountered the
usual pitfalls that freshmen encounter
the first time around â€” a strong head
wind, a bad start or a tactical battle.
For Bilotta, this meant getting out
maneuvered in the 1,500-meter race

with one lap to go. "I made two mis
takes," she said. "I got boxed in with
400 meters to," and"I didn't go with
the winner" on the final kick.
"I think it's a pretty big adjustment
from high school," she said. The com
petition is faster, she said, and also
has more experience timing a dramatic
finishing kick.
Last year as a freshman, David
Strang started fast to win the trials
in the 800-meter dash and finish third
in the finals. Tim Manson of Wash
ington State finished behind Strang
in the trials, but improved his time
to win the final event.
This year, Strang ran a more con
servative race to get to the finals. He
was rested for a strong second-place


Freshman Chryste Gaines finished a disappointing third in the women's 100 meters after holding the event's
best time this year coming into the Pac-10s.
