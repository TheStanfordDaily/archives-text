# Tigers still growling about losses
## 
### Cameron Macky Senior staff writer 
ATHENS, Ga. — Louisiana State men's
tennis Coach Jerry Simmons finally got
his wish. Unfortunately for him, it was
granted almost a year too late.
Last May, after Stanford had defeated
Simmons' Tigers 5-2 in the NCAA finals,
Simmons wasn't exactly the picture of the
graceful loser. The match had been played
indoors because of inclement weather, and
that gave Simmons the excuse he needed.
"Playing indoors hurt us," he said. "We
probably would have won the No. 4, 5 and
6 singles matches outside — and maybe 2
and 3, too."
Well, yesterday the Tigers had the Car
dinal right where they wanted — outside
— and it didn't do them much good.
This time, Simmons was a little more
gracious. "Stanford played a great match,
they're a great team," Simmons said. "We
took one more match this year than last,
but it still wasn't good enough."
The Tigers didn't exactly go quietly,
though. Most of the LSU players — and
the coaches — came into the match with
an attitude problem, and that feeling
manifested itself in finger-pointing, fist
pumping, some tactical "delays" and argu
ments with umpires.
Johan Kjellsten got things off to a bad
start in his very first game with Jeff
Tarango. Serving with the score 3-2, Kjel
lsten stepped to the line and bounced the
ball, preparing to serve. Then he bounced
it again. And again.
After 10 bounces, Kjellsten was set. He
swayed his racket. Left. Right. Again. And
again.
Tarango didn't need this. He turned his
back and walked away. After a few seconds,
Kjellsten tried again. This time he only
bounced the ball six times, but then stood
looking at Tarango for a good five seconds.
Tarango called time, and when Kjellsten
complained, Tarango yelled, "Will you just
serve the damn ball?" Kjellsten picked up
his pace after that, but the tone had been
set.
Roland So of LSU got so demonstrative
with his celebrations after each point that
Jeff Cathrall, his opponent at No. 3 singles,
responded by setting a personal record for
fist-pumps of his own. The two also may

have set an NCAA record for the number
of yeahs yelled during a match.
Of course, there's nothing wrong with
getting excited, but things boiled over in
the second set. Cathrall had just held for
five-all and had three break points on So
when Simmons started complaining to the
umpire about an incident that had allegedly
occurred during the previous changeover.
"The coach thought Jeff had bumped
into [So] on purpose," Stanford Asst. Coach
John Whitlinger said. "I didn't see it, the
umpire didn't see it, but everyone from
LSU saw it."
Simmons was so sure he saw it that he
called a tournament official in to talk to
the umpire. No one asked why Simmons
just happened to be complaining at a time
when his player was about to be broken
and in danger of losing the match. And,
as anyone who knows Cathrall can attest,
accusing him of getting violent is ludicrous
at best.
Cathrall thought the whole incident was
so ridiculous that he had no comment after
the match. Simmons continued to harp on
it, though, and exchanged words with Whit
linger several times during the rest of the
match, which was won by So.
Meanwhile, Tom Furukrantz was busy
celebrating winning the first point of his
match against Alex O'Brien by yelling,
"Yeah!" and shaking his fist at the fresh
man.
It's a good thing Furukrantz was able
to get excited over one point, because he
didn't win too many more. O'Brien let his
tennis do the talking and ran Furukrantz
into the ground, 6-2, 6-1.
The rest of the match had its share of
small incidents — balls hit right at opposing
players (by both schools), line disputes and
all the other things that make tennis such
a great sport. But the best was saved for
last.
During the No. 3 doubles match, which
was won by Stanford's Barry Richards and
Dan Turbow, So and Donni Leaycraft were
being coached by one of LSU's assistants.
During the second set, Simmons decided
he had some advice to give his players and
came over to the court, violating an NCAA
rule which states that only one coach may
be present at each court.
The umpire warned Simmons to stay
away, and he moved to a side court and

sat against the fence, still watching the
action. Two games later, though, he appar
ently did a little more than just watch.
"She (the umpire) caught him signalling
to the players, and gave them a point
penalty," said Turbow, who was serving at
the time. "Then their coaches started get
ting pretty hot, and she gave them a game
penalty.
"They (the LSU coaches) were really
trying to f— us over."
That penalty made it 4-2 Stanford, and
also made Simmons stalk off the court
looking for a tournament official. "After

she gave us the point penalty, I told her I
wanted to see the tournament referee, and
she gave me a game penalty," Simmons
said. "I told her again that I wanted the
ref, and she said she was going to default
us, so I figured I'd better leave."
Not that it mattered. "The game just
meant that Stanford held serve, and we
hadn't broken them yet anyway," Simmons
said. "If we had been serving, it would
have been different. If anything, my guys
played better after that."
Which raises the question of why such
a fuss was made in the first place.


One of yesterday's losers in Stanford's 5-3 defeat of LSU was Jeff Cathrall, who
was defeated by Roland So. Cathrall and So taunted each other continuously during
the match.
