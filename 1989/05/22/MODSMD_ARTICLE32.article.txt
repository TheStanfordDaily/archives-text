# Frosh Cevaer's lofty goals are never out of reach
## 
### David Hirning Staff writer 
Goals. Every student at Stan
ford has them. In particular,
many Cardinal athletes have
specific goals. Team goals, indi
vidual goals, long-term and
short-term.
But Christian Cevaer of the
NCAA regional-bound Stanford
men's golf team doesn't have
goals. He has goals. A bunch of
them. Big ones. Big, serious
ones. And the scary thing is, he
is starting to fulfill them with
methodic regularity.
Cevaer is a freshman on a
team primarily composed of up
perclassmen. The 19-year-old
has finished with the top score
on the Stanford squad at every
tournament this year. That was
one of his goals.
From the beginning of the
year, Cevaer made it known to
the rest of the team and whoever
else would listen that he planned
on winning a tournament during
his freshman campaign. After
coming close and failing on
several occasions (once on his
home course on the Farm), one
would think that he would have
put this goal aside as unrealistic.
Nope. At the final tournament
of the year, at the Pacific 10
Championship, Cevaer shot a
final-round 65 to win by three

full strokes. After the tourna
ment, he talked calmly of
"keeping things in perspective."
Apparently, he has been able to
do exactly what he sets out to
do with this mindset.
But knowing what he wants
to do and then going out and
doing it are second nature to the
soft-spoken young Parisian who
grew up in the South Pacific.
Already 12 years old when he
first ventured onto a golf course
(his previous home island didn't
have one), he didn't take long
to figure out what he wanted.
"Once I got better, I knew I
wanted to play pro," Cevaer said,
almost as if it was just a matter
of wanting to.
Then again, for Cevaer, maybe
it is just a matter of wanting to.
What followed this decision was
simply an awe-inspiring string
of successes. He came to the
U.S., learned English and atten
ded Robert Louis Stevenson
High School, where he was Cen
tral Coast Section champion for
three straight years. Then he
was Northern California high
school champion his senior year.
In the summers, he would
return to France, where he was
French junior champion at age
16, and a member of the French
junior national team. Last sum
mer he won the British Youth
Open (21 and under), the Junior

World Amateur Championship
and his team won the European
Junior Team Championship.
So, Christian, you were basi
cally recruited by every golf
power in the country, right?
"I was basically recruited by
no one else and (Stanford Coach)
Wally Goodwin," the Junior
World Champion said. "The rest
of the coaches, I had to write
them letters."
Cevaer explained the egre
gious oversight due to the fact
that he didn't play the American
Junior Golf Association tourna
ments in the summer. The only
reason that Goodwin even knew
about Cevaer was that, while the
coach at Northwestern, Goodwin
took his team to practice at
Cevaer's school. Goodwin had
been athletic director at the
school many years earlier.
"I sure didn't feel great about
going to Northwestern, where it
snows all the time," Cevaer
remembered. "When I heard
Coach Goodwin was coming to
Stanford, it was the greatest
news I ever heard."
"I kept track of him through
(Cevaer's professional coach)
Ben Doyle," Goodwin said.
"Junior year, we started writing
letters — he told me Stanford
was his first choice, and he was
always my first choice."
And so, when the good word

came from the admissions office,
another Cevaer goal was accom
plished. "My goal was to play
NCAA golf. Most PGA tour pros
had gone through that system.
It's a good tour to prepare for
the pros because the competition
is tremendous."
Tremendous would be a good
word to describe Cevaer's fresh
man campaign. Over half of his
finishes were in the top five. A
stroke average of 72.52. The vic
tory at Pac-lOs. All-Pacific 10
First Team. And now, leading
the Cardinal to their first post
season play in three years.
But is Cevear himself satisfied
with the year? "Maybe I played
just as well my senior year of
high school . . . but it's different.
The travel, longer season, the
competition is much tougher —
adjusting to a new type of com
petition. I've got to be satisfied
with what I've done."
After a pause, he said, "I am
satisfied."
But not satisfied enough to
stop striving for his lofty goals,
which seem to have no limits.
"Well, I think a 59 is out of
my reach," he said with a laugh,
still a freshman who has a hard
time studying when the sun is
shining. But someday this golf
player may even make breaking
60 one of his goals. If he does,
you can bet he'll get it.

But Christian Cevaer of the
NCAA regional-bound Stanford
men's golf team doesn't have
goals. He has goals. A bunch of
them. Big ones. Big, serious
ones. And the scary thing is, he
is starting to fulfill them with
methodic regularity.
Cevaer is a freshman on a
team primarily composed of up
perclassmen. The 19-year-old
has finished with the top score
on the Stanford squad at every
tournament this year. That was
one of his goals.
From the beginning of the
year, Cevaer made it known to
the rest of the team and whoever
else would listen that he planned
on winning a tournament during
his freshman campaign. After
coming close and failing on
several occasions (once on his
home course on the Farm), one
would think that he would have
put this goal aside as unrealistic.
Nope. At the final tournament
of the year, at the Pacific 10
Championship, Cevaer shot a
final-round 65 to win by three

full strokes. After the tourna
ment, he talked calmly of
"keeping things in perspective."
Apparently, he has been able to
do exactly what he sets out to
do with this mindset.
But knowing what he wants
to do and then going out and
doing it are second nature to the
soft-spoken young Parisian who
grew up in the South Pacific.
Already 12 years old when he
first ventured onto a golf course
(his previous home island didn't
have one), he didn't take long
to figure out what he wanted.
"Once I got better, I knew I
wanted to play pro," Cevaer said,
almost as if it was just a matter
of wanting to.
Then again, for Cevaer, maybe
it is just a matter of wanting to.
What followed this decision was
simply an awe-inspiring string
of successes. He came to the
U.S., learned English and atten
ded Robert Louis Stevenson
High School, where he was Cen
tral Coast Section champion for
three straight years. Then he
was Northern California high
school champion his senior year.
In the summers, he would
return to France, where he was
French junior champion at age
16, and a member of the French
junior national team. Last sum
mer he won the British Youth
Open (21 and under), the Junior

World Amateur Championship
and his team won the European
Junior Team Championship.
So, Christian, you were basi
cally recruited by every golf
power in the country, right?
"I was basically recruited by
no one else and (Stanford Coach)
Wally Goodwin," the Junior
World Champion said. "The rest
of the coaches, I had to write
them letters."
Cevaer explained the egre
gious oversight due to the fact
that he didn't play the American
Junior Golf Association tourna
ments in the summer. The only
reason that Goodwin even knew
about Cevaer was that, while the
coach at Northwestern, Goodwin
took his team to practice at
Cevaer's school. Goodwin had
been athletic director at the
school many years earlier.
"I sure didn't feel great about
going to Northwestern, where it
snows all the time," Cevaer
remembered. "When I heard
Coach Goodwin was coming to
Stanford, it was the greatest
news I ever heard."
"I kept track of him through
(Cevaer's professional coach)
Ben Doyle," Goodwin said.
"Junior year, we started writing
letters — he told me Stanford
was his first choice, and he was
always my first choice."
And so, when the good word

came from the admissions office,
another Cevaer goal was accom
plished. "My goal was to play
NCAA golf. Most PGA tour pros
had gone through that system.
It's a good tour to prepare for
the pros because the competition
is tremendous."
Tremendous would be a good
word to describe Cevaer's fresh
man campaign. Over half of his
finishes were in the top five. A
stroke average of 72.52. The vic
tory at Pac-lOs. All-Pacific 10
First Team. And now, leading
the Cardinal to their first post
season play in three years.
But is Cevear himself satisfied
with the year? "Maybe I played
just as well my senior year of
high school . . . but it's different.
The travel, longer season, the
competition is much tougher —
adjusting to a new type of com
petition. I've got to be satisfied
with what I've done."
After a pause, he said, "I am
satisfied."
But not satisfied enough to
stop striving for his lofty goals,
which seem to have no limits.
"Well, I think a 59 is out of
my reach," he said with a laugh,
still a freshman who has a hard
time studying when the sun is
shining. But someday this golf
player may even make breaking
60 one of his goals. If he does,
you can bet he'll get it.
Goals. Every student at Stan
ford has them. In particular,
many Cardinal athletes have
specific goals. Team goals, indi
vidual goals, long-term and
short-term.
