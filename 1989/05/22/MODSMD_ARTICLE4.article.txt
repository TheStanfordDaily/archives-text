# Fumes emitted from Biology Quad found virtually harmless

Emissions of toxic fumes from Stan
ford's Biology-Chemistry Quadrangle are
so low that they pose virtually no public
health risk, according to a report released
Friday by the University.
The report, which contains the findings
of a five-month independent study, con
cludes that risks from toxic emissions
are well below required safety levels and
adds that re-entrainrnent does not con
tribute significantly to the already low
long-term health risks in the area. Re
entrainment is a condition in which po

tentially dangerous fumes emitted from
a building can filter back into the building
or others nearby.
The study was commissioned following
a review conducted by SRI International
that found no "clear and present" health
and safety dangers at the University, but
suggested that re-entrainment studies be
undertaken at various sites.
The Biology-Chemistry Quad, consist
ing of seven facilities including the Her
rin, Keck, Mudd and Stauffer buildings,
was selected as the first area to be studied
because the numbers and volumes of
chemicals used in the area are among
the highest at Stanford.

Buildings in the quad house facilities
for the departments of biological sciences,
chemistry and chemical engineering â€”
including undergraduate labs.
The Los Altos-based firm Decision
Focus Inc., which conducted the recently
released study, interviewed 50 research
ers in the quad to determine what chemi
cals are used in the area and in what
quantities. The firm also used computer
models and a tracer gas study, in which
a harmless gas, sulfur hexafluoride, was
released from quad exhaust stacks to see
where the gas was dispersed.
Results showed that a person living 24
hours a day in the quad for 70 years

would have at most a one-in-a-million
chance of developing cancer due to in
haling emissions of carcinogens.
According to the report, this figure is
"about one hundred times less than the
average Californian's risk of dying in an
earthquake and about 3,000 times less
than an average individual's chances of
being killed in an auto accident."
The risk for undergraduates spending
four years on campus is reduced by 98
percent, and the risk is reduced 76 percent
for an average worker spending 40 hours
per week on campus for 40 years.
Facilities Project Management Director
Curt Williams said the report "told us

what we needed to know"and contained
"very much what we expected."
John Joynt, president of the Barron
Park Association, a local community
group active in monitoring environmental
issues at Stanford, said yesterday that
the report "sends a good signal to the
community that Stanford is looking at
the risks."
But Joynt added that, since the Uni
versity does not intend to repeat the
study, a regional air monitoring unit
should be secured to perform an ongoing
audit of emissions from the quad.
