After months of flooding the
Czechoslovakian government with
letters and petitions of demand,
Stanford members of Amnesty In
ternational finally feel that their
efforts to secure the freedom of
two writers there paid off.
In September 1987, at least 10
Stanford students "adopted" Jiri
Wolf, a Czechoslovakian activist
and writer who was sentenced for
subversion in collusion with
foreign agents. This year, Stan
ford members of Amnesty Inter
national also took up the cause
of Faclav Havel, the Czechoslo
vakian opposition leader and in
ternationally renowned play
wright who was found guilty in
February of incitement.
The Czechoslovakian govern
ment released both writers from
prison last Wednesday. While Wolf
served his full six-year term,
Havel was parolled for "good be

havior" after serving only four
months of an eight-month sen
tence.
Amnesty International believed
the two men were convicted "for
the nonviolent exercise of their
right to freedom of expression.
For several months now, Stan
ford students as well as other Bay
Area members of Amnesty Inter
national — including local high
school students — had been send
ing letters to Czechoslovakian gov
ernment officials on behalf of the
activists.
"It's definitely exciting to know
we actually have an impact," said
junior Dean Bochner, a second
year member of Amnesty Inter
national.
"Everyone sent letters so that
they know that people are aware
of what is going on," Bochner said,
adding that the mailings not only
put "international pressure" on
the government but also "let the
prisoners know that people care."
