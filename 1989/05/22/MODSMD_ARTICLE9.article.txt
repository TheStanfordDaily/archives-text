## Deadline passes in China without military action 
### 
BEIJING (AP) â€” Students oc
cupied Tiananmen Square in
violation of martial law for a third
day today as a reported ultimatum
by Premier Li Peng passed. Hun
dreds of thousands of people filled
the streets to defend the students
from a feared military crackdown.
City residents surrounded troop
convoys with thousands of people
and blocked major roads with
public buses, trucks and garbage
cans. Protesters drove buses up
to subway entrances on the square
to block any emerging troops.
Supporters also formed a
human cordon around the pro
testers at Tiananmen, while
motorcyclists and bicyclists sig
naled their support by circling the
square in a noisy procession.
The Beijing citizens, angered by
Li's hard-line stance, vowed
defiantly to continue their support
until the premier resigns. Many
also demanded the resignation of
senior leader Deng Xiaoping,
believing Li acted on Deng's or
ders.
"Li and Deng are stopping
China from advancing," said a
worker from a machine factory.
"They should step down and let
China become a powerful coun
try."
As the political situation be
came increasingly murky, rumors
swirled around the city. One un
confirmed report broadcast by
students in Tiananmen claimed
Deng and Li had resigned.
At the vast square, students
sang the "Internationale" and the
Chinese national anthem as the
reported 5 a.m. (4 p.m. Sunday
EDT) deadline for leaving the
square went by without incident.
"We will not retreat from the
square," student leader Wang Dan
said over a loudspeaker. He led
the 200,000 students and support
ers in a pledge: "We won't give
up until we reach our goals."
There were no reports of move
ment by soldiers who on Saturday

occupied state-run news or
ganizations and sealed off some
roads leading into the capital.
Chinese sources said 1,500 sol
diers armed with automatic weap
ons had moved into the train sta
tion about a mile east of the
square, but the troops did not
appear during the night.
The independent student union
that has led the protests an
nounced it received a message
from Li saying the military would
clear Tiananmen by force by 5
a.m.
The student loudspeaker an
nounced that the union had
rejected Li's ultimatum and called
on the protesters to remain calm
and restrained.
Beijing Radio and national tele
vision denied an ultimatum had
been given and read a statement
that the troops' goal was to res
tore order, not suppress the stu
dents. But it was clear order could
not be restored without ending
the occupation of Tiananmen, the
focus of five weeks of pro
democracy protests.
The students are demanding a
nationally televised dialogue with
the government, recognition of
their independent student unions
and government measures to en
sure freedom of the press and an
end to official corruption.
Li called in the 27th and 28th
armies Friday night and declared
martial law in central Beijing on
Saturday. However, his inability
to enforce martial law made it
clear an intense political struggle
was going on behind the scenes.
The status of relatively liberal
Communist Party General Secre
tary Zhao Ziyang, said by Chinese
sources to have resigned in
protest, remained unclear. There
was no official statement.
The exact number of soldiers
called in was not immediately
known.
