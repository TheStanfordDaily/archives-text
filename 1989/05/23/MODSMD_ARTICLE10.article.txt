# Greeks to attend diversity discussion groups
## Fraternity, sorority pledges will discuss racism, sexism, homophobia 
### Suzanne Corkins Staff writer 
In an effort to add a new di
mension to pledge training, many
sororities and fraternities will this
week require about 250 new mem
bers to attend workshops focused
on discussing racism, sexism and
homophobia.
Senior Don Burdette, the Inter
fraternity Council liaison to the
black community, organized the
workshops, which will be led by
the student group Students Speak
ing About Race and Culture. Each
workshop will include a one- hour
screening of a film in which stu
dents discuss personal experiences
with controversial issues such as
racism, sexism and homophobia.

After the film, the pledges will
participate in two hours of smaller
group discussions led by SSpARC
members.
"The impetus behind the pro
gram is a combination of past
problems and challenges from
campus groups and the adminis
tration, but more than anything,
an increasing awareness in the
Greek community about these is
sues and their relevance to the
community," said Burdette, who
is a member of Kappa Sigma.
At the beginning of this quar
ter, Burdette proposed to the IFC
that SSpARC discussions become
a mandatory part of all fraternity
pledge programs. Currently, the
IFC does not require pledges to
attend such a program, but some
sororities and fraternities do hold

workshops dealing with racism,
sexism and homophobia.
Because he found the IFC re
luctant to issue such a mandate,
he contacted each of the fraternity
and sorority presidents with his
proposal, Burdette said. When the
groups responded enthusiastically,
Burdette scheduled a series of
three workshops with SSpARC, he
explained. The first program will
be held tonight and the programs
will continue through Thursday
night.
As of yesterday, nine fraterni
ties and five sororities had con
firmed they are either requiring
or strongly encouraging their
pledges to attend one of the
workshops.
For SSpARC, a group organized
at the beginning of this year by

students interested in facilitating
group discussions on sensitive so
cial issues, this week's discussions
will be the largest held to date.
SSpARC has held its discussions
with as few as seven and as many
as 30 participants.
Sophomore Andrew Kassoy,
who has taken over Burdette's po
sition as liaison for the coming
year, hopes that the workshop's
popularity will lead the IFC to
require it for all fraternities by
next year's Rush.
"We want to get a membership
of Greeks who realize the merits
of this program, and from that
foundation we can establish the
program as a permanent struc
tural change," said Kassoy, a
member of Kappa Sigma.
