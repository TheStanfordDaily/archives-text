## Chinese military leaders refuse to attack protesters 
### 
BEIJING (AP) - More than
100 military leaders said yester
day they would not send their men
into Beijing to confront or sup
press the masses of people who
have seized control of the capital
to demand democratic reform.
A brief clash between soldiers
and populace did occur yesterday,
but no shooting was reported.
The promise not to attack pro
testers represented a serious blow
to Premier Li Peng and other
hardliners who have tried to quell
the huge demonstrations.
Sources said members of the
National People's Congress,
China's legislature, began gather
ing signatures needed to convene
a special session on the legality
of martial law, indicating a fur
ther erosion of Li's support.
In Washington, the Voice of
America said Chinese authorities
were jamming its broadcasts, ap
parently trying to cut off one of
the demonstrators' main sources
of information. It was the first
reported case of jamming since
before diplomatic relations were
restored in 1979.
Wan Li, head of the National
People' 3 Congress, told Vice Pres
ident Dan Quayle while visiting
Washington that the government

agreed at the start of demonstra
tions not to use violence, a Bush
administration official said.
But Wan also said restoring or
der was China's first priority, and
no progress can be made toward
promised reforms during the up
heaval, said the official, speaking
on condition of anonymity.
Soldiers withdrew from streets
in southern Beijing to end stan
doffs with residents who had sur
rounded military convoys for the
last three days.
Army trucks and armored
vehicles remained deployed else
where in western and southern
parts of the city, but the mood
was generally relaxed. State tele
vision quoted an officer as saying
he was told to withdraw because
of the widespread opposition to
martial law.
Residents and soldiers clashed
briefly in one area when the sol
diers tried to move to a nearby
army storage facility.
People surrounding the trucks
tried to block their path and a
battle with rocks and bricks
began.
An unconfirmed report said a
soldier was killed, and one report
said 15 residents were injured. A

Chinese journalist said about
2,000 soldiers participated in the
clash.
The confrontation, which ended
at about 1 a.m. today, occurred
15 miles southwest of Tiananmen
Square in central Beijing, where
tens of thousands of students have
held round-the-clock vigils in
defiance of martial law.
Citizens have set up barricades
throughout the city to keep sol
diers from moving on the stu
dents.
What caused the clash was not
clear. Witnesses said soldiers hit
people with sticks and belts but
did not open fire. The witneses
said some soldiers pushed through
throngs of residents trying to
block their way but that military
vehicles did not advance.
There were new signs of inter
nal political struggle.
The letter from military
leaders, which was sent to the
People's Daily, the mouthpiece of
the ruling Communist Party, was
drafted by seven prominent mili
tary figures, a source at the
People's Daily said. The seven in
clude former Defense Minister
Zhang Aiping and former army
Chief of Staff Yang Dezhi.
