WASHINGTON (AP) - Sec
retary of State James Baker
urged Israel yesterday to stop
settling Jews on the West Bank
and in Gaza and to give up any
aspirations of annexing ter
ritories captured from Jordan
and Egypt in the 1967 Six-Day
war.
Baker, in a speech to an
American Jewish group, said,
"Now is the time to lay aside,
once and for all, the unrealistic
vision of a greater Israel."
He also called on Prime Min
ister Yitzhak Shamir's govern
ment to reopen schools on the
West Bank and in Gaza closed
by Israeli authorities attempt
ing to cope with a Palestinian
uprising.
"Reach out to the Palestini
ans as neighbors who deserve
political rights," Baker said in
the speech to the American Is
rael Public Affairs Committee,
a private research and lobbying
group holding a convention
here.
At the same time, Baker
called on Palestinian Arabs to
abandon "the illusion of control
over all of Palestine" — mean
ing Israel apart from the West
Bank and Gaza.
He also urged the Arab world
to end its economic boycott of
the Jewish state and to recog

nize Israel "as a neighbor and
partner in trade and human
contact."
Baker's speech, which he
gave before meeting with Is
raeli Defense Minister Yitzhak
Rabin, represented a hardened
U.S. stance toward Jerusalem
while also appealing for con
cessions from radical Arabs.
He said the United States
would not "dictate an outcome"
to the negotiations Baker hopes
will spring from a proposal by
Shamir to hold elections among
Palestinians on the West Bank
and Gaza.
But, Baker said, "we do have
an idea about the reasonable
middle ground to which a
settlement should be directed."
He said Palestinian self
government in the territories
would provide "ample protec
tion" for Israel's security.
Baker did not explicitly rule
out retention by Israel of some
of the territory, as Rabin and
several other leading Israelis
say is essential to deter another
Arab attack.
But Baker stressed that Is
raelis ought to get used to the
idea of a negotiated settlement
that "will in all probability in
volve territorial withdrawal
and the emergence of a new
political reality."
