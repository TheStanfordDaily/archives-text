# Panamanian opposition leaders defy ban

### 
PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) — Hundreds
of workers cheered opposition leaders who
defied a government ban on demonstrations
and appeared yesterday at factories to seek
support for their claim to the presidency.
The opposition's three top candidates,
seeking recognition of their victory in the
May 7 general election, shook hands and
passed out leaflets welcoming a delegation
from the Organization of American States due
today.
"The OAS will not solve all our problems,
but it will create the environment. They have
come to investigate," said presidential candi
date Guillermo Endara. Workers greeted him
at factories in Panama City with chants of
"Endara is my president!" and "Justice! Jus
tice!"
International observers say the opposition
won the elections by a 3-1 margin. The gov
ernment and its de facto ruler, Gen. Manuel
Antonio Noriega, nullified the vote after it
was apparent their candidates were losing.
Monday was the third straight day that
Endara and his two vice presidential candi
dates, Ricardo Arias Calderon and Guillermo
Ford, defied the ban on demonstrations that
will last until the OAS delegation files its
report June 5.
The delegation is made up of the foreign
ministers of Ecuador, Guatemala and Trinidad
and Tobago, and OAS Secretary-General Joao
Baena Soares.
A pro-government party Monday criticized
the OAS for adopting a resolution condemning
Noriega and said its delegation could not
mediate among Panamanians.
"We call on the OAS to adopt a virile attitude
toward aggression against our people by the
United States," said a statement issued by
the Revolutionary Democratic Party, the lar
gest pro-government group.
After touring factories yesterday, Endara
said, "We want a transfer of power from the

Defense Forces to a civilian government."
Noriega holds power because he commands
the Defense Forces. He has been indicted on
federal drug trafficking charges in the United
States but says the charges are part of a U.S.
plot to retain control of the Panama Canal,
due to be turned over to Panama at the end
of 1999.
U.S. troops sent to augment security at U.S.
canal installations continued exercises yester
day, including special jungle training and live

firing.
Yesterday the opposition candidates,
pursued by a caravan of journalists, left party
headquarters without revealing their exact
destination.
Ford said the opposition is not calling for
large, announced demonstrations in order to
avoid "butchery."
"We're going to visit all 2 million of our
supporters, one by one," Ford said after
sharing a cup of coffee with a few workers.
