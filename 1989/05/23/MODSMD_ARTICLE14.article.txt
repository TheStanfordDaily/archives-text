# San Francisco passes partners bill
## New law will allow live-in lovers to register relationships 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - The
city Board of Supervisors yester
day unanimously approved the
nation's first law allowing live-in
lovers to register their partner
ships publicly.
The law, which also would ex
tend health benefits to "domestic
partners" of city workers, was op
posed by the Roman Catholic
Church but hailed by homosexual
couples, who cannot legally marry,
and heterosexual lovers who don't
want to wed.
The law, which passed on a 10-0
vote with one supervisor absent,
requires a routine second vote
lay 30 before going to Mayor Art
Agnos, who has promised to sign
it.

A few other cities have adopted
policies extending health benefits
to live-in lovers of municipal em
ployees. But San Francisco would
be the first to allow any non
married couples in the county to
register their relationships like
traditional couples file marriage
licenses.
The "Declaration of Domestic
Partnership" form would be filed
with the county clerk for a $35 fee.
"This will let people love as they
will," said Harry Britt, president
of the Board of Supervisors, au
thor of the measure and a leader
of the city's politically powerful
gay community.
In addition to health benefits,
live-in lovers of the 25,000 city

workers would be entitled to
bereavement leave and hospital
visitation rights.
"This is long overdue," said
Scott Smith, who was the lover
of Harvey Milk, San Francisco's
first gay supervisor, who was as
sassinated in 1978. "Our relation
ships are just as valid as non-gay
relationships."
The law, which defines domes
tic partners as any "two people
who have chosen to share one an
other's lives in an intimate and
committed relationship," is not
binding on private businesses. But
proponents say the city's policy
could lead to changes in many
areas.
