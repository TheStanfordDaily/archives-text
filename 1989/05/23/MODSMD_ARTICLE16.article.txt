Trump won't raise Eastern offer
NEW YORK (AP) — Donald Trump said yes
terday he will not raise his $365 million offer
for Eastern Airlines' Northeast shuttle after a
federal bankruptcy judge gave the strikebound
carrier another day to consider a higher offer.
U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton Lifland ad
journed until this afternoon a hearing at which
attorneys for Eastern, its unions and its major
creditors were to discuss rival offers for the
shuttle by Trump and America West Airlines.
Miami-based Eastern and a committee repre
senting its creditors asked for more time to con
tinue evaluating the bids and whether America
West could get financing for its purchase.
Eastern already has agreed to sell the shuttle
to Trump for $365 million, but last week Lifland
gave the airline until yesterday to consider a

higher bid from America West.
"The price I am paying is already too high,"
Trump said in a statement. "If my deal is not
approved by the end of this week, I will take my
$8 million fee and go home."
