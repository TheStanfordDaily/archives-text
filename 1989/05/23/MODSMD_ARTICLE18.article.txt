## Underwhelming 
### 
Kennedy's response has
silver lining, but leaves
too much to be desired

Students waited with
bated breath last Thursday
for a clearly articulated
presidential plan of action for bol
tering Stanford's commitment to
a multicultural education. Uni
versity President Donald Ken
nedy's response to the University
Committee on Minority Issues
failed to live up to most expec
tations.
The UCMI report offers 120
recommendations. Kennedy, in
his broadcasted address to the
Academic Council, commented on
24 of them. Of those 24, nine
were accepted without qualifica
tion; 10 are "under considera
tion"; three are pending founda
tion requests; and two were ac
cepted with qualifications. But 96
were left unaddressed.
On a better note, Kennedy did
take some positive steps. Most
significant is the commitment to
strive toward increasing the
number of minority faculty by
30 over the next 10 years. The
increase will have a qualitative
impact on the curriculum and on
student life.
Kennedy also committed to up
grade the staffing of the ethnic
centers by September and to es
tablish full-time deans at the
University's four centers.
On the whole, however, the of
ficial response falls short of what
is needed. Creating a multicul
tural community will require far
reaching changes, comprehensive
initiatives and bold leadership.
Of the recommendations he ad
dressed, Kennedy did not spell

out his priorities. Students
needed to hear what needs are
most pressing for the Stanford
community and how he intendes
to implement those priorities.
Instead, the Thursday address
sounded more passive than ac
tive. Kennedy needed to establish
some sort of concrete timeline
and goals for action. As it stands,
the only issue that does have a
solid schedule for implementation
is the ethnic centers. For the rest,
the Stanford community has to
wait for more information "in the
future."
When UCMI came out last
month the University requested
and received feedback from more
than 22 University departments.
Unfortunately, Kennedy did
not hit on the specifics outlined
by the departments. If the Uni
versity could release these com
ments to the public, then the com
munity could better gauge the
UCMI report's limitations and
potential.
In the past, Kennedy has ex
plained that his influence is lim
ited given the often decentralized
workings of a university. If the
community knew more about
why these limitations exist then
it would have a better conception
of the amount of effort coming
from the President's Office.
However, such information
was not forthcoming last Thurs
day. In this context, mounting
frustration is understandable.
Rather than lose itself in
generalities, the University must
strive to ground UCMI in
specifics.
Granted, UCMI itself is not a
comprehensive blueprint for a
multicultural institution. But it
is a positive attempt at under
standing and improving life for
minority students and for the
Stanford community at large.
