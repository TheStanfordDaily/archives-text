## Columnist off base on issue of student involvement 
### 
I WRITE TO challenge Isaac
Barchas' unfair assessment of the
Agenda for Action Coalition.
Barchas implies that students have
no reason for dissatisfaction, both
because students exert influence in
University committees and because the
"administration seems to bend over
backwards to resond to . . . minority
issues." His claims stem from ignor
ance of the minority situation and an
arrogant belief that he can assess the
significance of the issues better than
the coalition members themselves.
Barchas begins with a very shallow
understanding of the issues. The coali
tion never claimed to have been denied
access to the legitimate avenues of
power. Far from it. We accessed every
University-sanctioned means available.

With Asian-American studies we circu
lated petitions, posted fliers, wrote
letters, researched other universities,
led rallies, held discussions, sponsored
programs and called meeting after
meeting with key faculty and adminis
trators.
Our input was tremendous; the
outcome was nil. Yes, there is opportu
nity for student input, but we have
learned that little comes of input.
Barchas next makes a big point of
students involvement in University
committees. The Agenda for Action
Coalition is fully aware of these com
mittees, and of the fact that most of
them have nothing to do with the
issues on the Agenda for Action.
One that does — the University
Committee on Minority Issues — had

four students members. One of these
students sat in Kennedy's office May
15 precisely because of his experiences
with that committee — his specific
recommendations to the report were
lost in the conservative and vague
generalizations of the final UCMI
recommendations. Once again, student
input was solicited, only to be
promptly neutralized.
Perhaps Barchas unwittingly reveals
the true problem when he speaks of
Stanford responding to "perceived
students needs." The key word is
"perceived." The May 15 occupation
occurred because despite massive stu
dent efforts, Stanford didn't perceive
student needs and didn't understand
how gravely important were these
needs to the people who voiced them.

It was out of the seriousness of our
convictions that we engaged in civil
disobedience, and we couldn't wait
until May 18 because we had long
realized Kennedy's response to the
UCMI would not address our most
pressing concerns. How could it, when
none of these concerns were articulated
meaningfully in the UCMI in the first
place?
Our purpose was to get through to
Kennedy before he made a public
statement that he might later have to
amend. The occupation was the last
resort of a completely frustrated and
disillusioned student community.
