# Students, Kennedy open dialogue
## 
### Baldwin Lee Staff writer 
All faces came out smiling after
yesterday's meeting between Uni
versity President Donald Ken
nedy, administrators, faculty and
12 students from the Agenda for
Action coalition.
The hour-long meeting opened
up friendly channels for future
action on coalition concerns, ac
cording to those who attended the
meeting.
The meeting — a direct result
of the coalition's occupation of
Kennedy's office May 15 — was
scheduled last Thursday after stu

dents reluctantly agreed to accept
Kennedy's offer of Monday as the
earliest available meeting time.
During the meeting, coalition
members articulated the frustra
tions which led to the takeover.
The meeting participants then
moved on to discuss the coalition
members' priorities for the Uni
versity Committee on Minority Is
sues report.
Kennedy said the participants
of the meeting agreed to put the
events of the May 15 takeover of
his office "behind them" and
decided not to discuss possible dis
ciplinary action. Kennedy added
that he had "no hard feelings"

regarding the occupation.
Black Student Union Chair Cal
vin Martin, who attended the
meeting although he is not a part
of the Agenda for Action, said in
an interview with University
News Service that while no solid
commitments were made at the
meeting, "It's safe to say [ad
ministration officials] are willing
to commit to start the movement
towards changing things."
Kennedy said he felt "very pos
itive" about the meeting. He said
that after listening to coalition
members' concerns about minor
ity issues, he gained a better
understanding of what is best for

students. Coalition members
voiced their priorities for the im
plementation of the UCMI report
and articulated the frustrations
which led to the occupation, ac
cording to Assoc. History Prof. A 1
Camarillo, who is the UCMI chair.
Kennedy said he reassured co
alition members that his com
ments on the UCMI report to the
Academic Senate last Thursday
"set aside no particular prioritiza
tions."
Camarillo said all meeting par
ticipants were involved in devel
oping a good context for working
