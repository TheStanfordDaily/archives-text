# Men integral part of successful house for gender studies
## 
### 
I feel quite frustrated by Scott
Walker's May 15 letter concerning the
gender studies focus house. Walker
writes: "The ad intimated anything but
equal opportunity employment. It an
nounced the extension of the applica
tion deadline for men only ..." (refer
ring to applications for theme associate
positions).
A simple application of reasoning (or
a phone call to the resident fellows)
would have informed him that the
deadline was extended because there
were already enough female applicants
and not enough male applicants.
The idea is to have a balance of men
and women as theme associates. One
might think from reading the first
part of Walker's letter that Walker

does not realize this.
As we read further, however, it be
comes apparent that Walker in fact
does realize this. Even though he
clearly identifies issues that frighten
many men away from gender-related
studies, he goes on to say, "... if men
exhibit neither interest in nor knowl
edge of gender issues, why are they
necessary to legitimize the focus
house? The only thing the house needs
to be legitimate is an involved, com
petent staff."
Leaving aside the fact that the issue
is not legitimacy but awareness, what
Walker is really arguing for is not
equality, but exclusion. I don't think
he is really arguing for the exclusion
of men, but for the exclusion of men's
studies from the focus house,
The field of men's studies owes a
great deal to feminist studies for many
things, including a heightened aware
ness and a starting vocabulary; and
indeed, most students of men's studies
are feminists. Nevertheless, men's
studies is not a subgroup of feminist

studies, nor is gender studies. Feminist
studies and men's studies are both
subgroups of gender studies.
The idea behind the gender studies
focus house is to provide a place for
both genders. We need men as well as
women to help men overcome the fear
of the issues that Walker has so ac
curately identified. Further, the exten
sion of the deadline could be seen as a
form of affirmative action, intended to
allow for the reality of those fears.
