# Conflict between ad and editorial policy a sign of hypocrisy
## 
### 
Is it possible that the editors at The
Daily are unaware that media images
which objectify women contribute to a
social environment which condones
sexual violence?

Thursday's full-page Budweiser ad,
which attempts to sell beer by equat
ing it with sex, was in frightening con
trast to the accompanying editorial on
sexual violence at Stanford, with its
particular focus on "aquaintance rape."
Editors, make up your minds: Either
you truly believe a change of attitudes
is needed to combat sexism and sexual
violence, or you think it's okay to ac
cept money for this kind of advertis
ing.
Editorializing with one hand and
accepting dollars in the other is the
ultimate hypocrisy.
