## Victims' double jeopardy 
### 
IT HAPPENED IN Michigan at Lake
Superior State University. A sopho
more woman went to a bar with her
roommate and roommate's boyfriend,
where she was introduced to David
Caballero. Caballero was one of the top
wrestlers in the state, a fraternity mem
ber, handsome, well-liked and a criminal
justice major with hopes of one day be
coming a police officer.
She had a beer; he got drunk and made
passes at her. The coed left with her
roommate hoping to be rid of the both
ersome young man. But Caballero invited
himself to accompany the group to a
party on campus. At the end of the eve
ning, he insisted on walking the young
woman to her door.
She refused, but he was very persistent.
The coed, knowing that the hall doors
would be locked and no men were allowed
in the dorm past 12 a.m. on weeknights
(it was a weeknight, after 2 a.m.), allowed
Caballero to walk her to the outer doors
of the complex.
Caballero insisted on walking her to
her room. She refused. They argued, dur
ing which time Caballero accused her of
being afraid of him. He simply wanted
to walk her to her room to make sure
she got there safely.
Finally, she agreed to let him walk her
to her room, "thinking that the resident
assistant would be nearby" and wanting
to prove to Caballero that "she was not
afraid."
There was no resident assistant nearby.
Caballero forced himself into the sopho
more's room, where he brutally raped
her.

Why aren't most rapes reported? The
obvious answer is that the victim does
not want the judicial system to rape her
again.
A second crime is committed when the
woman goes to court (if indeed the dis
trict attorney decides to prosecute),
where she relives the entire experience
over and over again, is badgered by a
defense attorney who alludes to the fact
that her being raped was somehow her
fault; and all this is going on while she
is trying to deal with the psychological
trauma of what has happened to her.
Most ol the time it does not even cul
minate in the conviction of her assailant.
So, what happened to the college soph
omore in Michigan? A little over a week
after the incident, with the encourage
ment of her friends and family, she re
ported the rape.
She decided to report the rape when
she began to think about how David
Caballero would someday become a police
-officer, "a cop with a gun. Who's to say
he won't just blow a girl away if she
won't do what he thought she should?"
The court's response was one which
no self-respecting member of the
judiciary should be proud. The assailant
was found guilty of two counts of criminal
sexual conduct (rape) which carries a
minimum sentence of five years in prison,
a maximum of life; however Caballero
received no jail time.
Under an unapplicable act called the
Michigan Holmes Youthful Trainee Act,
the judge sentenced Caballero to three
years probation, $875 in court fees and
$200 in compensation to the victim. If

She reported the rape
when she began to think
about how David Caballero
would someday become a
police officer, a cop with a
gun. Who's to say he won't
just blow a girl away if she
won't do what he thought
she should?'

the terms of probation are met, after the
three years are completed, Caballero's
record will be clear, and there will be no
evidence of a rape conviction on his crim
inal record.
In response to the court's decision in
this case, a nationwide letter-writing
campaign was started in Michigan and
has spread to many college campuses
across the country. Students Against
Sexism have brought it to ours.
I encourage everyone to show their sup
port for this cause and demonstrate their
outrage over the treatment of rape vic
tims in the judicial system.
