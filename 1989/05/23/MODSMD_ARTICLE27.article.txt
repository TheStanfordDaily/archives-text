## Discrimination and hardships in the '30s 80-year-old graduate shares glimpse of campus during the Depression 
### Ken Yew Staff writer 
Eighty-year-old Bill Rubens, a
Stanford student during the Great
Depression, knows that Stanford
wasn't always like Disneyland.
For students in the 19305, fi
nancial pressure made it hard to
stay in school and to find work
afterward, he said.
Rubens said simply going to col
lege was an unusual and expensive
endeavor for someone coming
from his neighborhood. He grew
up in New York's East Side.
He said he found a way out of
his neighborhood by becoming a
cub reporter on the New York
World when he was 16. Friends
he made at the newspaper helped
him both to prepare and pay for
college, he said.
"The staff writers there gave
me lots of help to go to school,
including money," he recalled.
Upon arriving at Stanford,
Rubens said that his Jewish back
ground caused him to be singled
out as a minority. "I didn't really
fit in,"he said. "Though I had
friends all over, the only people I
could go with were the 20 to 25
people on campus who were
Jewish."
Jews weren't the only minority
on campus, according to Rubens.
Out of about 3,000 undergradu
ates, he said there were only 500
women at Stanford at the time
— referred to simply as "the 500."
"I was a learner, not a drinker,"
he said. "I couldn't get a date
with any of the 500."
Rubens said he found the
campus itself "so much smaller"
than it is today. But, he said, Stan
ford still possessed a "wide ex
panse" of undeveloped land.
Stanford was much less selec
tive school in the 30s, Rubens said.
"Anyone who passed any kind of
SAT got in,"he explained. How
ever, "Stanford was still rated
among the best schools on the
West Coast. They were always
competing with UCLA and UC-
Berkeley," he said.
Tuition costs at Stanford were

high relative to the standard of
living in the '30s, just as they are
today, Rubens said. He received a
scholarship that paid the $99 per
quarter tuition cost, but he spent
much of his spare time working
to pay for his living expenses.
There was a great deal of pressure
at the time to pay for college in
a depressed economy, Rubens
said.
He took several jobs to pay his
expenses, including waiting tables

at a French restaurant and
making deliveries in his automo
bile. "1 didn't know how to drive,"
he said. "The guy I bought it from
showed me, and I was driving
around in two to three weeks."
According to Rubens, many of
his classmates couldn't even grad
uate because of the financial pres
sure. "They were forced into other
things," he said. Rubens said the
situation was so bad that he saw
professors on breadlines.

Upon graduating, Rubens tried
to go back to New York to find
a job in journalism, but found
that many newspapers had gone
bankrupt. He then took jobs as a
cab driver and a longshoreman to
support his family. Rubens said
the New York docks where he
worked were loaded with corrup
tion. "The docks were run by
Mafia-type people with a phony
union," he said.
Rubens joined the Army during
World War 11. Using his veteran's
benefits to pay for college, he re
ceived two master's degrees in
labor economics and social work.
In 1960, Rubens, at the age of
50, started working to treat the
mentally ill in New York. "I was
twice as old as anybody there
starting out," he said.
Rubens and others helped
schizophrenics through tech
niques using photographs that
gave the patients a context in
which to perceive reality. "We
were kind of like pioneers,"
Rubens said. He stayed on as a
social worker until reaching the
mandatory retirement age of 65.
Rubens is now retired and lives
with his wife in Palo Alto. His
current ambition is to learn how
to play the concertina to play a
Hanukkah recital in honor of his
father.
"I'm hoping (to) honor my
father to relieve this sense of
guilt," he said. His father died in
1935.
"I felt terrible about it. I didn't
have the money to put him in a
nice Jewish cemetary. I later
found out a nephew of his placed
him in holy ground in Long Is
land," he said. "That was such a
relief to me."
Rubens now spends his time
reading and auditing philosophy
classes at Stanford.
