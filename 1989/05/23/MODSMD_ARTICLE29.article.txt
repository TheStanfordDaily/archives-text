If you're interested in books
about the 19605, you've probably
had very mixed feelings about the
last two years. Although publish
ers have flooded the market with
writings about that important
decade, most of them haven't been
very good.
Sometimes, of course, you've
been delighted by truly outstand
ing works of scholarship, such as
Taylor Branch's "Parting the
Waters: America in the King
Years." You've also been intruiged
by the writings of former New
Left leaders, particularly Todd
Gitlin's "The Sixties: Years of
Hope, Days of Rage." (See inset.)
But for the most part, reflec
tions on the 1960s have done
more to obscure than they have
to enlighten, and you've watched
Time magazine and other more
explicitly ideological publications
threaten our understanding of the
past. Such "histories" consist
more of visually-fragmented, non
interpretive glitz than of scholarly
analysis.
The last 24 months have proved
that not all self-examination is
beneficial and that indeed some
times it can be absolutely perni
cious.
W.J. Rorabaugh's "Berkeley at
War" ranks among the better of
these recent national self
examinations — probably because
his subject is arguably one of the
more significant an historian of
the '60s can discuss.
Author of the widely acclaimed
"The Alcoholic Republic" and
"The Craft Apprentice,"
Rorabaugh (who attended Stan
ford from 1964-1968) examines
Berkeley in the '60s with an his
torical perspective. His narrative
describes the "entangled histories
of the student movement, race re
lations, the New Left, and the
counterculture" as they developed
in Berkeley particularly after
World War 11.
Through his local study,
Rorabaugh argues that the '60s
marked a turning point in United
States history, a period in which
American society crossed an his
torical chasm.
According to Rorabaugh, that
shift essentially represented a
revolt against political liberalism
and its trust of concentrated gov
ernment authority to a belief in

grassroots, local autonomy and
political action.
"The social turmoil of the
sixties was really a battle over
power," he writes. "College stu
dents, young blacks, members of
the New Left, and hippies (all)
believed that power should flow
from the bottom up rather than
the top down."

Ronald Reagan, Ed
win Meese and Jerry
Brown all launched
their political careers
in 1960s Berkeley.

Drawing on extensive primary
sources, and focusing precisely on
those "at the bottom," "Berkeley
at War" chronicles this battle for
power as it occurred on the local
level in the city that has come to
symbolize social unrest.
Rorabaugh aptly begins his nar
rative in 1962, when then-
President John Kennedy gave UC-
Berkeley's annual Charter Day
address. The Cuban Missile Crisis
still seven months in the future,
Rorabaugh uses Kennedy's pres
ence to personify widely
supported, unfractured liberalism
as it generally existed across the
country at that time.
On the University campus, this
triumph of liberalism was repre
sented in the now infamous Uni
versity President Clark Kerr. With
his vision of the "multiversity" —
a truly large-scale public institu
tion that would both dutifully
serve the needs of government and
de-emphasize traditional under
graduate education — "no man
was a better liberal" than
Berkeley's much maligned
figurehead.
The first chapter of "Berkeley
at War" chronicles student chal
lenge to this figurehead and the
educational system he represented
by following the history of the
free speech movement. Born in
1964 when the University at
tempted to ban political groups
from distributing literature on the
edge of Bancroft and Telegraph
avenues, the free speech move
ment's exciting protests set the
mood of what Rorabaugh calls "a
restless probing of life" that
animated Berkeley throughout
the '60s. The author refers back
to this mood in his description of
student unrest throughout his

book.
But "Berkeley at War" is far
from another work solely about
movements for student empower
ment. Its strength lies in the au
thor's description of the intercon
nections between struggles for
student power, the New Left, the
counter-culture and particularly
movements for Afro-American lib
eration. In addition to the free
speech movement, Rorabaugh
turns his scholarly eye to the Viet
nam Day Committee, life among
the hippies, the riots surrounding
People's Park and the Black Pan
ther Party. He places all these
movements in the context of
Berkeley's social history,
describes their shape and details
their connections.
At its best, "Berkeley at War"
offers an excellent description of
these problematic relationships
on a local level, from the perspec
tive of those at the bottom.
Rorabaugh is able to show the
connections between white
liberals' failure to deliver on their

promises to Berkeley's black com
munity, student frustration with
university bureaucracy, protest
against the war in Vietnam and
counter-culture militancy. With
lucid writing, Rorabaugh's detail
weaves a rich fabric of local
people, places and events, many
of which histories of the '60s in
general do not mention.
In doing so, he admirably
achieves his task of showing
precisely that the protest of the
'60s was in essence an attempt to
wrestle power down to the local
level. By focusing on those "at the
bottom," Rorabaugh shows how
the '60s were characterized not
by the "anarchy" that mainstream
social commentators would have
us believe, but rather by a sense
of rebirth, a sense of growing self
determination.
For all its strengths, however,
"Berkeley at War" is not a book
for readers unfamiliar with post
war American history. Rora
baugh's description of Berkeley in
the '60s will seem too fast to those

who do not already know the na
tional social phenomenon in the
context of which events there took
place. In particular, Rorabaugh
should have made far more clear
the connection between the south
ern civil rights movement of the
'50s and '60s and the first ex
pression of political dissent on the
Berkeley campus.
Still, Rorabaugh's book cer
tainly has much to offer the in
terested reader, and is a welcome
addition to literature about the
'60s. Stanford students in partic
ular will benefit from its descrip
tion of the historical roots of our
collegiate neighbor.
Indeed, many of today's impor
tant cultural and political faces
launched their careers in Berkeley
in the '60s, including Ronald
Reagan, Edwin Meese and Jerry

Brown. What one thought of
Berkeley then has become a sort
of touchstone for one's current
political disposition. This is as
true for Stanford academics as for
Washington, D.C. politicos.
"Berkeley at War" thus can help
readers better understand both
Berkeley in the 1960s and our
contemporary historical circum
stances as well. It is a book about
the past, but also one very much
about the present. With it and the
other rare worthwhile studies
about the '60s published recently,
we will be able to place our own
lives in context, in proper perspec
tive.

When the American government sent trains carrying Vietnam-bound
troops through Berkeley in August 1965, the Vietnam Day
Committee organized several anti-war protests.
