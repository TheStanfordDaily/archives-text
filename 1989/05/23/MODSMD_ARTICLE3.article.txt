# Moon may go down on Dead shows

Although the Grateful Dead
"never stopped rockin," Univer
sity officials may tell the ageless
rock band, "Don't you come
around here anymore."
Citing the widespread drug use
that typically accompanies Grate
ful Dead concerts, Dean of Stu
dent Affairs James Lyons said yes
terday that he has placed a hold
on the Concert Network's plans
to ask the band back to Frost
Amphitheater next year.
Lyons said that University of
ficials plan to use the next few
months to investigate what can
be done to address the drug prob
lems that accompany the shows.
However, he said, "We're under
the operating assumption that the

shows may not continue."
Both Lyons and University
President Donald Kennedy have
received copies of a report from
Stanford Police Chief Marv Her
rington which outlines the prob
lems that accompanied this year's
shows.
"It is disturbing to see the wide
ness and openness of drug usage
at the concerts," Herrington said
in an interview last Friday. "The
Grateful Dead represent a return
to the '60s drug culture. They
bring with them more and more

people who sell drugs every year."
Most of the problems cited by
Lyons and Herrington occurred
in the eucalyptus grove directly
across from Frost Amphitheater
where "Dead heads," people who
follow the band around the coun
try, typically camp and sell their
wares during the weekend of the
Grateful Dead shows.
Herrington said the Stanford
Police have been trying to elimi
nate the use of the grove for the
past five years, but they haven't
been able to decide where to let

people park and how to keep them
from setting up camp.
Lyons said the University may
look into the possibility of allow
ing the Grateful Dead to continue
playing concerts in Frost without
letting people use the grove.
Steve Cramer, director of the
Concert Network, said that he
hopes solutions can be found to
the problems in the grove. "It's
a great show with great student
support. We want it to be contin
ued," he said.
The concert annually sells out
two shows in Frost, which holds
approximately 9,500 people.
Although the network gets the
bulk of its revenue from profits
from the Grateful Dead concerts,
Cramer said the network does not
"depend on the funds generated
by the Grateful Dead shows," but
the additional revenues help the
network subsidize "riskier" cul
tural and ethnic shows.
According to Cramer, if the
University decides to ban the
Grateful Dead, the network would
still put on two or three shows a
quarter, but the events would not
be as diverse.
According to Herrington, the 40
arrests made by the Stanford
Police outside of the May 6 and
7 concerts only represent "the
most egregious offenses. There
were things we couldn't deal with
because we simply didn't have the
manpower."
Herrington said although the
drug use was high inside the con
cert, the police focused most of

their energies on what was hap
pening in the grove. "As long as
there was no fighting or no one
collapsed (inside Frost), my people
had all they could handle with
what was going on outside the
concert."
Herrington said that a number
of people had to be taken to Stan
ford Hospital to be treated for
drug overdoses and three people
were arrested on charges of
driving drunk or under the influ
ence of drugs.
If the University decides to ban
the Grateful Dead, Frost will join
a growing list of venues that have
just said no.
Red Rocks, an amphitheater in
Colorado, banned the Grateful
Dead after a man died of a heroin
overdose. Irvine Meadows amphi
theater in southern California
nixed future Dead shows after a
local politician called for police to
crack down on drug sales and
usage at a concert there.
