Although the Grateful Dead
"never stopped rockin," Univer
sity officials may tell the ageless
rock band, "Don't you come
around here anymore."
Citing the widespread drug use
that typically accompanies Grate
ful Dead concerts, Dean of Stu
dent Affairs James Lyons said yes
terday that he has placed a hold
on the Concert Network's plans
to ask the band back to Frost
Amphitheater next year.
Lyons said that University of
ficials plan to use the next few
months to investigate what can
be done to address the drug prob
lems that accompany the shows.
However, he said, "We're under

shows may not continue."
Both Lyons and University
President Donald Kennedy have
received copies of a report from
Stanford Police Chief Marv Her
rington which outlines the prob
lems that accompanied this year's
shows.
"It is disturbing to see the wide
ness and openness of drug usage
at the concerts," Herrington said
in an interview last Friday. "The
Grateful Dead represent a return
to the '60s drug culture. They
bring with them more and more

people who sell drugs every year."
Most of the problems cited by
Lyons and Herrington occurred
in the eucalyptus grove directly
across from Frost Amphitheater
where "Dead heads," people who
follow the band around the coun
try, typically camp and sell their
wares during the weekend of the
Grateful Dead shows.
Herrington said the Stanford
Police have been trying to elimi
nate the use of the grove for the
past five years, but they haven't
been able to decide where to let

people park and how to keep them
from setting up camp.
Lyons said the University may
look into the possibility of allow
ing the Grateful Dead to continue
playing concerts in Frost without
letting people use the grove.
Steve Cramer, director of the
Concert Network, said that he
hopes solutions can be found to
the problems in the grove. "It's
a great show with great student
support. We want it to be contin
ued," he said.
The concert annually sells out
two shows in Frost, which holds
approximately 9,500 people.
Although the network gets the
bulk of its revenue from profits
from the Grateful Dead concerts,
Cramer said the network does not
