"The Sixties: Years of Hope,
Days of Rage"
By Todd Gitlin
Bantam Books, $24.95
Reviewed by Mark Weiner
Of the many histories of the
1960s being written recently,
one of the better is Todd Git
lin's "The Sixties: Years of
Hope, Days of Rage," now re
issued in paperback. Once an
early president of Students for
a Democratic Society (SDS),
Gitlin is now a professor of
sociology at UC-Berkeley and
a well-known social commenta
tor on the left.
Although "The Sixties" is far
from the definitive account of
the decade — and certainly
cannot replace more specific
histories of the black liberation
movement or the women's
movement — Gitlin's book
nevertheless offers a rich, well
written and serious meditation
on the course and meaning of
those 10 years as a whole.
Focusing particularly on the
history of SDS and white stu
dent protest, Gitlin's narrative
derives its particular strength
from its fusion of personal
recollections and historical
analysis and from its broad
scope and interpretive vision.

In addition, Gitlin's book
contains an understanding
which most status quo his
torians of the '60s lack: an
awareness and an emphasis
that one of the most critical
influences on white political
commitment was black protest
in the South and later the ur
ban North.
Gitlin's concerns in"The
Sixties" are largely autobiogra
phical. Having been raised by
an affluent, liberal family who
sent him to Bronx High School
of Science and Harvard Uni
versity, Gitlin looks back upon
his years of activism (in which
he traveled from peace organ
ization work in the early '60s
to fantasies about "The Revo
lution" at their end) — and
wonders how he and others like
him made such a radical tran
sition. How, he asks, did a
movement that began with
such idealism and hope grow
to such national prominence
but ultimately end largely in
fragmentation, despair and
retreat?
Examining both the internal
dynamics and the historical
context of the New Left, Gitlin
attempts to answer this ques
tion in a succesful effort of both
personal and national self
examination.
