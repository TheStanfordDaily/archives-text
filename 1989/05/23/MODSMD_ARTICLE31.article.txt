# Pivot, literary France's media star, talks to The Daily
## 
### James Mokhiber 
Americans would call him the host of
a book show and leave it at that. But
writer/editorlcritic Bernard Pivot holds
the keys to the scrappy world of writing
in France through "Apostrophes," his
Paris-based literary program that can
mean life or death to an emerging author.
Each week a huge and diverse group of
viewers in France and now throughout
Europe turn on the show to watch the
high-brow elite deconstruct and debate
each other's books.
Two weeks ago, Pivot was here at Stan
ford to film an episode to be aired in
France on July 21. The Daily interviewed
him during the filming in the Rodin
sculpture garden. Excerpts of Pivot's
views on intellectuals, Kirk Douglas and
comic books follow.
Daily: Permit us a little bit of narcissism:
Why have you come to Stanford Univer
sity to film your show?
Pivot: We're here because of Michel
Serres and Rene Girard who are two fa
mous French philosophers who teach here
. . . The real title of this show is "Two
French Philosophers in California." So
it's not a documentary on Stanford, it's
a show about two French philosophers
teaching here.
Daily: Stanford is expanding its Western
Culture program to include, for example,
more books by women, blacks and Puerto
Ricans. What do you think of the idea?
Pivot: You see, for me, writers, whether
they are Puerto Rican, women, near
sighted, homosexual, Jewish — what's
important to me is whether they have
talent . . . You have to teach everything.
You have to teach the classics, including
Greek and Roman literatures but you
also have to teach them (students) about
today's literature, American literature,
European literature, Japanese literature
and all the literatures. (But) 1 find that
the more time that goes by, the more
there is to know and the more difficult
it is to know everything . . .
Daily: Why do you think there isn't a
show like "Apostrophes" here in America?
Pivot: I think that it's because there is
practically nothing but private television
channels here. And private television
channels search for the largest audiences
during the best times in order to obtain
the most from their advertising. Any in
tellectual broadcast consisting only of
writers has trouble finding a very large
audience. It's the privilege of a television

station, like Antenne 2,
owned by the state . . .
Daily: You don't think
that it's because your
show reflects a typically
French mentality?
Pivot: On the contrary,
"Apostrophes" is a show
that is typically Latin. The
Latin people love to talk
— think of the Italians
and their commedia
dell'arte — the French are
Gauls who love to debate,
pound their fists on the
table . . . There is a certain
reserve in the Anglo-
Saxon countries, and the
Anglo-Saxons seem to lend
themselves a bit less to
this type of show than the
Latin peoples. I would say
that my show is very
French, but I'd also say
that it's very Latin.
But this doesn't keep us
from inviting Anglo-
Saxons, and a good deal of
great American writers
have appeared on my
show, like Norman Mailer,

Isaac Bashevis Singer, Tom Wolfe. Next
week I'm going to have John Irving . . .
Daily: Recently you did a show on Amer
ican actor Kirk Douglas, who had just
published his book "The Son of the Rag
Man" in French —
Pivot: No, it wasn't on Kirk Douglas, he
was one of four guests on "Apostrophes"
that night.
Daily: Yes, but all the same he definitely
made a splash in Paris .. .
Pivot: Oh yes, because he was very funny,
sarcastic, racy and he speaks French very
well since he is married to a French wom
an. He was so radiant that his book has
become a big bestseller in France.
Daily: Why? Does he symbolize some
thing to the French people, something
about America?
Pivot: Well, first of all he symbolizes the
grand Hollywood cinema and the big Hol
lywoodian actor. (Also) he symbolizes the
success of the immigrant from Russia
who arrives with his poor family, knows
nothing about the culture, doesn't even
know the American language and who in
one generation becomes someone rich and
famous . . . it's somebody who makes the
French dream because he represents the
exceptional success of a very poor person
in a country that is said to be very hard,
and very difficult.

Daily: In France it seems like you see
your intellectuals in the way that we
Americans look at our movie stars. Is
there a difference between French and
American intellectuals?
Pivot: Yes, it's a French tradition to make
stars of its writers. Voltaire was a great
"star" in his time, and the French people
practically organized a coronation for him
as the biggest star of his time. You have
to realize that France had a national
funeral for Victor Hugo. He was an im
mense writer.
In France there has always been a huge
respect for the writers, and not just the
philosopher, but also for the novelist and
the poet. Thus at the base there is a
tradition that makes the writer a socially
superior being of uncommon intelligence.
So it's true in a way that a show like
"Apostrophes" perpetuates this kind of
admiration for the writer.
Daily: Yes, in fact you were recently
named one of the most influential intel
lectuals in France. Does this give you
some kind of social responsibility?
Pivot: No, no, not really, my responsibil
ity is to make sure I propose interesting
books to the French people. But it's a
perversion of the French media — which
certainly has its disadvantages ~ making
French television people like myself more

popular than the creators
themselves.
I was just saying to Mi
chel Serres, that if I were
to walk along the Champs
Elysees with him people
would ask me for my au
tograph and not him. And
I would be embarassed,
very embarassed! Because
it is obviously the creator,
the philosopher, that
pushes the world forward.
He is the one that moves
the world, not me.
Daily: Yes, but you are
still the director, the met
teur en scene.
Pivot: No, no, I'm not the
metteur en scene, I'm just
an intermediary. I am the
intermediary between he
that creates and the per
son who listens and
watches at home. But you
can't make the inter
mediary more important
that the creator. It's just
a perversion of the French
media system.
Daily: You are also the

editor of the magazine Lire. Do you have
a theory, a method of reading?
Pivot: No, not at all. I read with my
pencil and I start with the beginning,
pass through the middle and end at the
end. I read in the same way that I was
taught in the French primary school.
Daily: And you never tire of it?
Pivot: Oh yes, sometimes yes. Sometimes
we grow weary because a book we were
hoping would be excellent disappoints us.
I wouldn't say that there haven't been
times when I haven't been a bit chagrined
to have to spend a whole afternoon
reading a book. But as a general rule, as
I am not a masochist, I find a lot of
pleasure in reading 10, 12, 14 hours a day.
Daily: The French seem to have adopted
the comic book, "8.D." (bande dfssinte),
as a new kind of cultural art. Can you
explain why?
Pivot: Yes, it is completely different and
interesting. The B.D. was for a long time
disparaged in France, reserved for
children, considered like a minor art. Per
sonally, within the realm of books I still
consider it to be something of a minor art.
But it is true that there are still greatly
talented people who express themselves
through the B.D. format. Tintin,
for instance ... I can't recount offhand

all the well-known personalities. But it
is true that a great number of people
express themselves though the 8.D., and
sometimes they are even great artists.
Myself, I think that the B.D. is without
doubt an art, but in my point of view it
is all the same a minor art.
Daily: Can you foresee a day when
"Apostrophes" will do a show on the 8.D.?
Pivot: I have, I have already! Certainly
they are not the ones I invite the most
often, but that doesn't keep me from
inviting B.D. authors, of course.
Daily: In Paris, the Centre Georges Pom
pidou (a large art and open-stacks library
complex open to the general public) has
been an enormous success. Now the
French are considering building an im
mense new state-of-the-art library in the
capital, the so-called "TGB" (for Trts
Grande Ribliothdque). Is the idea of the
library as a meeting point for intellectuals
changing now? Are the libraries perhaps
becoming more Americanized or
"democratized"?
Pivot: Well, I think that the French fell
enormously behind in their libraries,
which is rather unfortunate, considering
the fact that, as you know, writers are
"stars" in France. We have libraries that
are old, outdated, not adapted to the
modern world. So when I see the ex
traordinary library, or rather the libra
ries, here, and I see the libraries that
the unfortunate Parisian student uses,
it's crazy.
So I think that it is urgent to build
not only a very large library, but above
all a library where the student can get
a book quickly and consult it, not like
the Bibliothdque Nationale where it takes
hours and hours. In France we must not
only build a "Tr£s Grande Bibliothdque,"
we must also renovate the ones that exist.
Daily: And if you were to recommend a
single new French book to an American,
which would you choose?
Pivot: I would say "Elements de l'Histoire
de Science" by Michel Serres, and, in the
area of fiction I would recommend the
latest book by Rachid Mimoumi, a
French-speaking Algerian. Both are in
French and haven't yet been printed in
English, however.

Michel Serres and Bernard Pivot pose for their eager Stanford fans
while filming a recent episode of France's literary TV show
"Apostrophes."
Americans would call him the host of
a book show and leave it at that. But
writer/editorlcritic Bernard Pivot holds
the keys to the scrappy world of writing
in France through "Apostrophes," his
Paris-based literary program that can
mean life or death to an emerging author.
Each week a huge and diverse group of
viewers in France and now throughout
Europe turn on the show to watch the
high-brow elite deconstruct and debate
each other's books.
Two weeks ago, Pivot was here at Stan
ford to film an episode to be aired in
France on July 21. The Daily interviewed
him during the filming in the Rodin
sculpture garden. Excerpts of Pivot's
views on intellectuals, Kirk Douglas and
comic books follow.
Daily: Permit us a little bit of narcissism:
Why have you come to Stanford Univer
sity to film your show?
Pivot: We're here because of Michel
Serres and Rene Girard who are two fa
mous French philosophers who teach here
. . . The real title of this show is "Two
French Philosophers in California." So
it's not a documentary on Stanford, it's
a show about two French philosophers
teaching here.
Daily: Stanford is expanding its Western
Culture program to include, for example,
more books by women, blacks and Puerto
Ricans. What do you think of the idea?
Pivot: You see, for me, writers, whether
they are Puerto Rican, women, near
sighted, homosexual, Jewish — what's
important to me is whether they have
talent . . . You have to teach everything.
You have to teach the classics, including
Greek and Roman literatures but you
also have to teach them (students) about
today's literature, American literature,
European literature, Japanese literature
and all the literatures. (But) 1 find that
the more time that goes by, the more
there is to know and the more difficult
it is to know everything . . .
Daily: Why do you think there isn't a
show like "Apostrophes" here in America?
Pivot: I think that it's because there is
practically nothing but private television
channels here. And private television
channels search for the largest audiences
during the best times in order to obtain
the most from their advertising. Any in
tellectual broadcast consisting only of
writers has trouble finding a very large
audience. It's the privilege of a television

station, like Antenne 2,
owned by the state . . .
Daily: You don't think
that it's because your
show reflects a typically
French mentality?
Pivot: On the contrary,
"Apostrophes" is a show
that is typically Latin. The
Latin people love to talk
— think of the Italians
and their commedia
dell'arte — the French are
Gauls who love to debate,
pound their fists on the
table . . . There is a certain
reserve in the Anglo-
Saxon countries, and the
Anglo-Saxons seem to lend
themselves a bit less to
this type of show than the
Latin peoples. I would say
that my show is very
French, but I'd also say
that it's very Latin.
But this doesn't keep us
from inviting Anglo-
Saxons, and a good deal of
great American writers
have appeared on my
show, like Norman Mailer,

Isaac Bashevis Singer, Tom Wolfe. Next
week I'm going to have John Irving . . .
Daily: Recently you did a show on Amer
ican actor Kirk Douglas, who had just
published his book "The Son of the Rag
Man" in French —
Pivot: No, it wasn't on Kirk Douglas, he
was one of four guests on "Apostrophes"
that night.
Daily: Yes, but all the same he definitely
made a splash in Paris .. .
Pivot: Oh yes, because he was very funny,
sarcastic, racy and he speaks French very
well since he is married to a French wom
an. He was so radiant that his book has
become a big bestseller in France.
Daily: Why? Does he symbolize some
thing to the French people, something
about America?
Pivot: Well, first of all he symbolizes the
grand Hollywood cinema and the big Hol
lywoodian actor. (Also) he symbolizes the
success of the immigrant from Russia
who arrives with his poor family, knows
nothing about the culture, doesn't even
know the American language and who in
one generation becomes someone rich and
famous . . . it's somebody who makes the
French dream because he represents the
exceptional success of a very poor person
in a country that is said to be very hard,
and very difficult.

Daily: In France it seems like you see
your intellectuals in the way that we
Americans look at our movie stars. Is
there a difference between French and
American intellectuals?
Pivot: Yes, it's a French tradition to make
stars of its writers. Voltaire was a great
"star" in his time, and the French people
practically organized a coronation for him
as the biggest star of his time. You have
to realize that France had a national
funeral for Victor Hugo. He was an im
mense writer.
In France there has always been a huge
respect for the writers, and not just the
philosopher, but also for the novelist and
the poet. Thus at the base there is a
tradition that makes the writer a socially
superior being of uncommon intelligence.
So it's true in a way that a show like
"Apostrophes" perpetuates this kind of
admiration for the writer.
Daily: Yes, in fact you were recently
named one of the most influential intel
lectuals in France. Does this give you
some kind of social responsibility?
Pivot: No, no, not really, my responsibil
ity is to make sure I propose interesting
books to the French people. But it's a
perversion of the French media — which
certainly has its disadvantages ~ making
French television people like myself more

popular than the creators
themselves.
I was just saying to Mi
chel Serres, that if I were
to walk along the Champs
Elysees with him people
would ask me for my au
tograph and not him. And
I would be embarassed,
very embarassed! Because
it is obviously the creator,
the philosopher, that
pushes the world forward.
He is the one that moves
the world, not me.
Daily: Yes, but you are
still the director, the met
teur en scene.
Pivot: No, no, I'm not the
metteur en scene, I'm just
an intermediary. I am the
intermediary between he
that creates and the per
son who listens and
watches at home. But you
can't make the inter
mediary more important
that the creator. It's just
a perversion of the French
media system.
Daily: You are also the

editor of the magazine Lire. Do you have
a theory, a method of reading?
Pivot: No, not at all. I read with my
pencil and I start with the beginning,
pass through the middle and end at the
end. I read in the same way that I was
taught in the French primary school.
Daily: And you never tire of it?
Pivot: Oh yes, sometimes yes. Sometimes
we grow weary because a book we were
hoping would be excellent disappoints us.
I wouldn't say that there haven't been
times when I haven't been a bit chagrined
to have to spend a whole afternoon
reading a book. But as a general rule, as
I am not a masochist, I find a lot of
pleasure in reading 10, 12, 14 hours a day.
Daily: The French seem to have adopted
the comic book, "8.D." (bande dfssinte),
as a new kind of cultural art. Can you
explain why?
Pivot: Yes, it is completely different and
interesting. The B.D. was for a long time
disparaged in France, reserved for
children, considered like a minor art. Per
sonally, within the realm of books I still
consider it to be something of a minor art.
But it is true that there are still greatly
talented people who express themselves
through the B.D. format. Tintin,
for instance ... I can't recount offhand

all the well-known personalities. But it
is true that a great number of people
express themselves though the 8.D., and
sometimes they are even great artists.
Myself, I think that the B.D. is without
doubt an art, but in my point of view it
is all the same a minor art.
Daily: Can you foresee a day when
"Apostrophes" will do a show on the 8.D.?
Pivot: I have, I have already! Certainly
they are not the ones I invite the most
often, but that doesn't keep me from
inviting B.D. authors, of course.
Daily: In Paris, the Centre Georges Pom
pidou (a large art and open-stacks library
complex open to the general public) has
been an enormous success. Now the
French are considering building an im
mense new state-of-the-art library in the
capital, the so-called "TGB" (for Trts
Grande Ribliothdque). Is the idea of the
library as a meeting point for intellectuals
changing now? Are the libraries perhaps
becoming more Americanized or
"democratized"?
Pivot: Well, I think that the French fell
enormously behind in their libraries,
which is rather unfortunate, considering
the fact that, as you know, writers are
"stars" in France. We have libraries that
are old, outdated, not adapted to the
modern world. So when I see the ex
traordinary library, or rather the libra
ries, here, and I see the libraries that
the unfortunate Parisian student uses,
it's crazy.
So I think that it is urgent to build
not only a very large library, but above
all a library where the student can get
a book quickly and consult it, not like
the Bibliothdque Nationale where it takes
hours and hours. In France we must not
only build a "Tr£s Grande Bibliothdque,"
we must also renovate the ones that exist.
Daily: And if you were to recommend a
single new French book to an American,
which would you choose?
Pivot: I would say "Elements de l'Histoire
de Science" by Michel Serres, and, in the
area of fiction I would recommend the
latest book by Rachid Mimoumi, a
French-speaking Algerian. Both are in
French and haven't yet been printed in
English, however.

only build a "Tr£s Grande Bibliothdque,"
we must also renovate the ones that exist.
Daily: And if you were to recommend a
single new French book to an American,
which would you choose?
Pivot: I would say "Elements de l'Histoire
de Science" by Michel Serres, and, in the
area of fiction I would recommend the
latest book by Rachid Mimoumi, a
French-speaking Algerian. Both are in
French and haven't yet been printed in
English, however.

Michel Serres and Bernard Pivot pose for their eager Stanford fans
while filming a recent episode of France's literary TV show
"Apostrophes."
Americans would call him the host of
a book show and leave it at that. But
writer/editorlcritic Bernard Pivot holds
the keys to the scrappy world of writing
in France through "Apostrophes," his
Paris-based literary program that can
mean life or death to an emerging author.
Each week a huge and diverse group of
viewers in France and now throughout
Europe turn on the show to watch the
high-brow elite deconstruct and debate
each other's books.
Two weeks ago, Pivot was here at Stan
ford to film an episode to be aired in
France on July 21. The Daily interviewed
him during the filming in the Rodin
sculpture garden. Excerpts of Pivot's
views on intellectuals, Kirk Douglas and
comic books follow.
Daily: Permit us a little bit of narcissism:
Why have you come to Stanford Univer
sity to film your show?
Pivot: We're here because of Michel
Serres and Rene Girard who are two fa
mous French philosophers who teach here
. . . The real title of this show is "Two
French Philosophers in California." So
it's not a documentary on Stanford, it's
a show about two French philosophers
teaching here.
Daily: Stanford is expanding its Western
Culture program to include, for example,
more books by women, blacks and Puerto
Ricans. What do you think of the idea?
Pivot: You see, for me, writers, whether
they are Puerto Rican, women, near
sighted, homosexual, Jewish — what's
important to me is whether they have
talent . . . You have to teach everything.
You have to teach the classics, including
Greek and Roman literatures but you
also have to teach them (students) about
today's literature, American literature,
European literature, Japanese literature
and all the literatures. (But) 1 find that
the more time that goes by, the more
there is to know and the more difficult
it is to know everything . . .
Daily: Why do you think there isn't a
show like "Apostrophes" here in America?
Pivot: I think that it's because there is
practically nothing but private television
channels here. And private television
channels search for the largest audiences
during the best times in order to obtain
the most from their advertising. Any in
tellectual broadcast consisting only of
writers has trouble finding a very large
audience. It's the privilege of a television

station, like Antenne 2,
owned by the state . . .
Daily: You don't think
that it's because your
show reflects a typically
French mentality?
Pivot: On the contrary,
"Apostrophes" is a show
that is typically Latin. The
Latin people love to talk
— think of the Italians
and their commedia
dell'arte — the French are
Gauls who love to debate,
pound their fists on the
table . . . There is a certain
reserve in the Anglo-
Saxon countries, and the
Anglo-Saxons seem to lend
themselves a bit less to
this type of show than the
Latin peoples. I would say
that my show is very
French, but I'd also say
that it's very Latin.
But this doesn't keep us
from inviting Anglo-
Saxons, and a good deal of
great American writers
have appeared on my
show, like Norman Mailer,

Isaac Bashevis Singer, Tom Wolfe. Next
week I'm going to have John Irving . . .
Daily: Recently you did a show on Amer
ican actor Kirk Douglas, who had just
published his book "The Son of the Rag
Man" in French —
Pivot: No, it wasn't on Kirk Douglas, he
was one of four guests on "Apostrophes"
that night.
Daily: Yes, but all the same he definitely
made a splash in Paris .. .
Pivot: Oh yes, because he was very funny,
sarcastic, racy and he speaks French very
well since he is married to a French wom
an. He was so radiant that his book has
become a big bestseller in France.
Daily: Why? Does he symbolize some
thing to the French people, something
about America?
Pivot: Well, first of all he symbolizes the
grand Hollywood cinema and the big Hol
lywoodian actor. (Also) he symbolizes the
success of the immigrant from Russia
who arrives with his poor family, knows
nothing about the culture, doesn't even
know the American language and who in
one generation becomes someone rich and
famous . . . it's somebody who makes the
French dream because he represents the
exceptional success of a very poor person
in a country that is said to be very hard,
and very difficult.

Daily: In France it seems like you see
your intellectuals in the way that we
Americans look at our movie stars. Is
there a difference between French and
American intellectuals?
Pivot: Yes, it's a French tradition to make
stars of its writers. Voltaire was a great
"star" in his time, and the French people
practically organized a coronation for him
as the biggest star of his time. You have
to realize that France had a national
funeral for Victor Hugo. He was an im
mense writer.
In France there has always been a huge
respect for the writers, and not just the
philosopher, but also for the novelist and
the poet. Thus at the base there is a
tradition that makes the writer a socially
superior being of uncommon intelligence.
So it's true in a way that a show like
"Apostrophes" perpetuates this kind of
admiration for the writer.
Daily: Yes, in fact you were recently
named one of the most influential intel
lectuals in France. Does this give you
some kind of social responsibility?
Pivot: No, no, not really, my responsibil
ity is to make sure I propose interesting
books to the French people. But it's a
perversion of the French media — which
certainly has its disadvantages ~ making
French television people like myself more

popular than the creators
themselves.
I was just saying to Mi
chel Serres, that if I were
to walk along the Champs
Elysees with him people
would ask me for my au
tograph and not him. And
I would be embarassed,
very embarassed! Because
it is obviously the creator,
the philosopher, that
pushes the world forward.
He is the one that moves
the world, not me.
Daily: Yes, but you are
still the director, the met
teur en scene.
Pivot: No, no, I'm not the
metteur en scene, I'm just
an intermediary. I am the
intermediary between he
that creates and the per
son who listens and
watches at home. But you
can't make the inter
mediary more important
that the creator. It's just
a perversion of the French
media system.
Daily: You are also the

editor of the magazine Lire. Do you have
a theory, a method of reading?
Pivot: No, not at all. I read with my
pencil and I start with the beginning,
pass through the middle and end at the
end. I read in the same way that I was
taught in the French primary school.
Daily: And you never tire of it?
Pivot: Oh yes, sometimes yes. Sometimes
we grow weary because a book we were
hoping would be excellent disappoints us.
I wouldn't say that there haven't been
times when I haven't been a bit chagrined
to have to spend a whole afternoon
reading a book. But as a general rule, as
I am not a masochist, I find a lot of
pleasure in reading 10, 12, 14 hours a day.
Daily: The French seem to have adopted
the comic book, "8.D." (bande dfssinte),
as a new kind of cultural art. Can you
explain why?
Pivot: Yes, it is completely different and
interesting. The B.D. was for a long time
disparaged in France, reserved for
children, considered like a minor art. Per
sonally, within the realm of books I still
consider it to be something of a minor art.
But it is true that there are still greatly
talented people who express themselves
through the B.D. format. Tintin,
for instance ... I can't recount offhand

all the well-known personalities. But it
is true that a great number of people
express themselves though the 8.D., and
sometimes they are even great artists.
Myself, I think that the B.D. is without
doubt an art, but in my point of view it
is all the same a minor art.
Daily: Can you foresee a day when
"Apostrophes" will do a show on the 8.D.?
Pivot: I have, I have already! Certainly
they are not the ones I invite the most
often, but that doesn't keep me from
inviting B.D. authors, of course.
Daily: In Paris, the Centre Georges Pom
pidou (a large art and open-stacks library
complex open to the general public) has
been an enormous success. Now the
French are considering building an im
mense new state-of-the-art library in the
capital, the so-called "TGB" (for Trts
Grande Ribliothdque). Is the idea of the
library as a meeting point for intellectuals
changing now? Are the libraries perhaps
becoming more Americanized or
"democratized"?
Pivot: Well, I think that the French fell
enormously behind in their libraries,
which is rather unfortunate, considering
the fact that, as you know, writers are
"stars" in France. We have libraries that
are old, outdated, not adapted to the
modern world. So when I see the ex
traordinary library, or rather the libra
ries, here, and I see the libraries that
the unfortunate Parisian student uses,
it's crazy.
So I think that it is urgent to build
not only a very large library, but above
all a library where the student can get
a book quickly and consult it, not like
the Bibliothdque Nationale where it takes
hours and hours. In France we must not
only build a "Tr£s Grande Bibliothdque,"
we must also renovate the ones that exist.
Daily: And if you were to recommend a
single new French book to an American,
which would you choose?
Pivot: I would say "Elements de l'Histoire
