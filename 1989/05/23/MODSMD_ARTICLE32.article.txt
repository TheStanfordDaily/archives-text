## Men's tennis forges to final against host Georgia 
### Cameron Macky Senior staff writer 
ATHENS, Ga. - If the South
Carolina Gamecocks were looking
for a way to upset the Stanford
men's tennis team yesterday, spot
ting the Cardinal a 4-0 lead prob
ably wasn't the best way to do it.
Unfortunately for the Game
cocks, that's exactly what they
did, and their strong performance
in the doubles couldn't prevent
Stanford from posting a 5-2 win
to advance to today's NCAA
Championship match.

Cardinal 5, Gamecocks 2

Stanford is now 21-4, and meets
host Georgia today at 1 p.m.
(EDT) for the NCAA title. The
Bulldogs advanced to the finals
with a 5-1 thrashing of Texas
Christian yesterday afternoon.
The Gamecocks started the
match well, but then fell apart in
four of the six singles matches.
At No. 5, Johan Karlen broke
Glenn Solomon's serve twice in
the early going for a 4-0 lead, but
then fell victim to the 90-plus
degree heat and an ankle injury.
Karlen had been racing all over
the court from the word go, and
apparently just exhausted himself.
Solomon, down 5-1, took the next
five games and was serving for
the set when Karlen defaulted.
"[Karlen] was on crutches two
weeks ago," South Carolina Coach
Kent DeMars said. "We knew he
was hurting going in. I don't think
he would've stopped because of
the heat alone."
Whatever the reason, Karlens'
loss gave Stanford a 1-0 lead,
which went to 2-0 minutes later
when Jeff Tarango finished his
6-3, 6-1 trouncing of Steve
Longley. It was Tarango's first
win of the tournament.
"I thought the team had held
me up enough this week,'
Tarango said. "I was fired up
today. This guy (Longley) plays a
game that was much more

suitable to mine — he didn't hit
any of that heavy Swedish junk,"
a reference to LSU's Johan Kjel
lsten.
Jeff Cathrall made it 3-0 when
he finished off Ken Diller 6-1, 6-4,
and Alex O'Brien took the last 11
games of his match with Dave
Herman for a 7-5, 6-0 win.
The first four contests were all
over less than 80 minutes after
the match started, leaving only
Barry Richards and Martin Black
man to finish. At sixth singles,
Richards did something he hadn't
done all season — he lost a match
for the second day in a row. In
fact, Richards had lost only twice
all season before this week.
After dropping one break and
the first set 6-3 to Louie Gloria,
Richards was receiving serve
down 6-5 in the second. Gloria
hit a forehand wide to give Ric
hards a break point, and then
double-faulted to bring on a tie
breaker.
Up 4-1, Richards gave Gloria a
break with two unforced errors,
and that was all the Gamecock
needed. He took the last six points
of the match for a 6-3, 7-6 win
and South Carolina's first point.
In the final match, Martin
Blackman and Stephane Simian
were putting on a power-vs-power
display. Simian's huge serve kept
Blackman off balance throughout
the first set, and Blackman's did
the same.
"He's got a big lefty serve, and
that bothered me at first," Black
man said. "Later on, though, I
got into a groove." He didn't get
into it soon enough to take the
first set — neither player could
break the other in the first, and
Simian took the tiebreaker 7-5.
In the second set, Simian broke
Blackman twice for a 4-1 lead, but
Blackman finally solved Simian's
serve in the next game for 4-2,
and four games later took advan
tage of three Simian volleying er
rors to get back on serve.
Like Richards, Blackman went
up 4-1 in the subsequent tie
breaker, but Simian took the next
two points behind a strong pair
of serves, and pulled even on a
missed volley by Blackman.

An ace made it 5-4 Blackman,
but Simian put his next two
serves down Blackman's throat
for his first match point. Black
man then came up with two rocket
serves of his own (is there a pat

tern here?) to go up 7-6, but a
Simian volley knotted the score
again.
Simian missed a lob to give
