# Rabid Dawgs await Cardinal

ATHENS, Ga. - Woof, woof,
woof for the home team.
Four thousand barking Geor
gia fans will be on hand at
Henry Feild Stadium this af
ternoon, trying to root their
Bulldogs to the team's third
NCAA men's tennis title in the
last five years.
And, while the crowd has
been noticeably more subdued
this year than in years past —
probably because of a new
regulation banning alcohol in
the stadium — co-No. 8 Geor
gia's home-court advantage is
still nothing to be laughed at,
as No. 7 USC, No. 3 UC-Irvine
and co-No. 8 TCU have all dis
covered.
The Bulldogs, the 1985 and
1987 NCAA champions, are
trying today to give their fans,
and the NCAA, a going-away
present. The NCAA tourna
ment, which has been held in
Athens ever since the current
format was adopted in 1977,
will move to Indian Wells,
Calif., next year and will then
rotate to different schools in
following years.
All of which hasn't made the
Georgia fans very happy. It also
hasn't made Southern Califor
nia Coach Dick Leach an ex
tremely popular man here.
Ever since the Dawgs upset
Leach's top-ranked Trojans in
the semifinals two seasons ago,
Leach has been a strong
proponent of moving the tour
nament to a new location.
During that 5-4 loss, there

were several incidents betwen
Dawg fans and the Trojan
players, and Leach made com
plaints to the NCAA after the
tourney, saying it should be
held somewhere else.
The NCAA acquiesced, much
to the chagrin of Georgia, and
Leach became Public Enemy
No. 1. The NCAA's decision to
let USC host the tournament
in 1990 didn't help Leach's
popularity, either.
The decision to leave Athens
also hasn't thrilled one other
group of people. There happens
to be one team which, over the
13 years that the NCAA tour
nament has been held here, has
enjoyed more success than the
homestanding Dawgs.
"This (Athens) is Dick
Gould's place," Leach said. And
how. Defending champion
Stanford has won seven NCAA
titles in 10 tries at Athens, has
a 7-1 record in championship
matches, and, if the Cardinal
wins today, will have won three
of the last four team titles.
Stanford has won 11 tourna
ment contests in a row —
dating back to a 1985 quarter
final loss to the Bulldogs.
That meeting is the only pre
vious time the two teams have
met in NCAA play. Today, in
Athens' last championship
match (at least for the foresee
able future), the underDawgs
are shooting for their fourth
straight upset win of the tour
nament.
And, as the home team meets
the top-seeded defending
champs, there's only one thing
that's certain.
It's gonna be loud.
