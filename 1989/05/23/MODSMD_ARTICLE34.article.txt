With apologies to Sports ll
lustrated's Rick Reilly (who did
this with uniform numbers),
here are my picks for the all-time Stan
ford University Alphabet Squad — the
best athletes in school history, letter by
letter. Thanks to Chris Crader for helping
to fill in a couple of gaps.
A — Jennifer Azzi (women's basketball)
over Frankie Albert (football).
B — Bob Boone (baseball) over Sandra
Birch (women's tennis) and Kimberly Bel
ton (men's basketball).
Belton, class of 1980, is the unsung
hero of the B-team. He was Stanford's
all-time leading scorer before Todd Lichti.
C — Paul Carey (baseball).
The grand slam for the ages. Other
candidates: Jody Campbell (water polo),
Kim Carlisle (women's swimming), Toi
Cook (baseball) and Kay Cornelius (wom
en's golf).
D — Howie Dallmar.
Dallmar is perhaps the most familiar
face to anyone who has gone to school
here since the 19305. He was the 1942

NCAA tournament Most Valuable Player,
coached men's basketball for 21 years,
and is now invaluable as Director of In
tramurals.
E — John Elway (football, baseball)
F — Tie: Patty Fendick (women's tennis)
and Scott F irtune (men's volleyball).
G — Dan < Idie (men's tennis) over Mar
jorie Gesting (diving).
Goldie won the NCAA singles champi
onship in 1986 as Stanford swept the
team and singles titles in both men's and

women's tennis. Gesting, years before she
would enroll on the Farm, was a 13-year
old Olympic springboard champion in the
1936 Olympic Games in Berlin. Watch
out for up-and-coming Chryste Gaines
(track and field).
H — Steve Hug (men's gymnastics)
Needing a gymnast for the list, I gave
the nod to the national champion in the
all-around (1972-74) and parallel bars
(1973-74) over Eric Hardgrave (baseball),
Dan Hanan (men's volleyball), Sonja Hen
ning (women's basketball), Tony Hill
(football), Ceci Hopp (cross country) and
Herbert Hoover (football).
I — Dave Imbernino (water polo) over
Susan Inge (Dollie).
J — Jenna Johnson (women's swimming)
over Kathy Jordan (women's tennis).
K — Morris Kirksey (track and field).
Kirksey was the first Stanford athlete
to win track-and-field gold in the Olympic
Games, taking a leg on the 400-meter
relay. Earlier, Kirksey lost by a nose in
the 100 when, using that Stanford intel
ligence, he turned to look to see where

his opponent was.
L — Hank Luisetti (men's basketball).
M — Pablo Morales (men's swimming).
One of the toughest categories to
choose. Other worthy candiates include
baseball player and coach Mark Mar
quess, two-time Olympic decathlon cham
pion Bob Mathias, and the combined ef
forts of John and Patrick McEnroe.
N — Ernie Nevers (football) over Darrin
Nelson (football).
Perhaps the two greatest running
backs in Stanford history. Nelson was
the first player in college football history
to catch 50 passes and rush for 1,000
yards in the same season. But 1 don't
think that would have changed Sports
Illustrated's mind in 1962 when it named
Nevers the greatest college football player
of all time.
O — Kim Oden (women's volleyball) over
A 1 "8%" Osuna (baseball).
When you say O, you say Kim Oden.
But no one should ever forget that aside
from Paul Carey's grand slam, Osuna's

8% innings of shutout relief in the Col
lege World Series is probably the single
most important individual performance
in Stanford baseball history.
P — Jim Plunkett (football).
Q — Larry Questad (track and field)
Oh, what a coup at Q. Questad holds
the Stanford record for the 100-yard dash
(9.3) and 200 (20.6), both set in 1963.
R — Wendi Rush (women's volleyball)
over Mark Rogowsky (intramurals).
S — Ed Sprague (baseball) over Charles
Schwager (men's basketball).
T — Todd the God (men's basketball).
U _ Joseph C. Urban (football).
U be the judge: Urban was a four-year
letterman from 1912-1915.
V — The Vow Boys (football) over Conrad
Voorsanger (men's gymnastics).
Voorsanger's Voorhanger seems a nat
ural at this spot, but I have to go with
the Boys, who appeared in three-straight
Rose Bowls from 1934-36, went 25-4-2


JON WEISMAN
overall and allowed only 99 points
in 31 games.
W — Tom Watson (men's golf)
over Pop Warner (football).
Warner was an innovator, but
Watson was a Master.
X — Xactly no one.
Here's your chance for immor
tality. Put an X in front of your
last name and become the first
and greatest such Stanford ath
lete ever.
Though X may have been a dis
appointment, we end with a
bang. ..
Y — George Yardley (men's bas
ketball).
Yardley holds the 31st best
single-season scoring mark in
Stanford history, 423 points in
1950.
Z — Pete Zagar (track and field).
Three-time national champion
in the discus, 1937-39.
Well, that's the end. Go nuts.

ning (women's basketball), Tony Hill
(football), Ceci Hopp (cross country) and
Herbert Hoover (football).
I — Dave Imbernino (water polo) over
Susan Inge (Dollie).
J — Jenna Johnson (women's swimming)
over Kathy Jordan (women's tennis).
K — Morris Kirksey (track and field).
Kirksey was the first Stanford athlete
to win track-and-field gold in the Olympic
Games, taking a leg on the 400-meter
relay. Earlier, Kirksey lost by a nose in
the 100 when, using that Stanford intel
ligence, he turned to look to see where

his opponent was.
L — Hank Luisetti (men's basketball).
M — Pablo Morales (men's swimming).
One of the toughest categories to
choose. Other worthy candiates include
baseball player and coach Mark Mar
quess, two-time Olympic decathlon cham
pion Bob Mathias, and the combined ef
forts of John and Patrick McEnroe.
N — Ernie Nevers (football) over Darrin
Nelson (football).
Perhaps the two greatest running
backs in Stanford history. Nelson was
the first player in college football history
to catch 50 passes and rush for 1,000
yards in the same season. But 1 don't
think that would have changed Sports
Illustrated's mind in 1962 when it named
Nevers the greatest college football player
of all time.
O — Kim Oden (women's volleyball) over
A 1 "8%" Osuna (baseball).
When you say O, you say Kim Oden.
But no one should ever forget that aside
from Paul Carey's grand slam, Osuna's

8% innings of shutout relief in the Col
lege World Series is probably the single
most important individual performance
in Stanford baseball history.
P — Jim Plunkett (football).
Q — Larry Questad (track and field)
Oh, what a coup at Q. Questad holds
the Stanford record for the 100-yard dash
(9.3) and 200 (20.6), both set in 1963.
R — Wendi Rush (women's volleyball)
over Mark Rogowsky (intramurals).
S — Ed Sprague (baseball) over Charles
Schwager (men's basketball).
T — Todd the God (men's basketball).
U _ Joseph C. Urban (football).
U be the judge: Urban was a four-year
letterman from 1912-1915.
V — The Vow Boys (football) over Conrad
Voorsanger (men's gymnastics).
Voorsanger's Voorhanger seems a nat
ural at this spot, but I have to go with
the Boys, who appeared in three-straight
Rose Bowls from 1934-36, went 25-4-2


JON WEISMAN
overall and allowed only 99 points
in 31 games.
W — Tom Watson (men's golf)
over Pop Warner (football).
Warner was an innovator, but
Watson was a Master.
X — Xactly no one.
Here's your chance for immor
tality. Put an X in front of your
last name and become the first
and greatest such Stanford ath
lete ever.
Though X may have been a dis
appointment, we end with a
bang. ..
Y — George Yardley (men's bas
ketball).
Yardley holds the 31st best
single-season scoring mark in
Stanford history, 423 points in
1950.
Z — Pete Zagar (track and field).
Three-time national champion
in the discus, 1937-39.
Well, that's the end. Go nuts.
With apologies to Sports ll
lustrated's Rick Reilly (who did
this with uniform numbers),
here are my picks for the all-time Stan
ford University Alphabet Squad — the
best athletes in school history, letter by
letter. Thanks to Chris Crader for helping
to fill in a couple of gaps.
A — Jennifer Azzi (women's basketball)
over Frankie Albert (football).
B — Bob Boone (baseball) over Sandra
Birch (women's tennis) and Kimberly Bel
ton (men's basketball).
Belton, class of 1980, is the unsung
hero of the B-team. He was Stanford's
all-time leading scorer before Todd Lichti.
C — Paul Carey (baseball).
The grand slam for the ages. Other
candidates: Jody Campbell (water polo),
Kim Carlisle (women's swimming), Toi
Cook (baseball) and Kay Cornelius (wom
en's golf).
D — Howie Dallmar.
Dallmar is perhaps the most familiar
face to anyone who has gone to school
here since the 19305. He was the 1942

NCAA tournament Most Valuable Player,
coached men's basketball for 21 years,
and is now invaluable as Director of In
tramurals.
E — John Elway (football, baseball)
F — Tie: Patty Fendick (women's tennis)
and Scott F irtune (men's volleyball).
G — Dan < Idie (men's tennis) over Mar
jorie Gesting (diving).
Goldie won the NCAA singles champi
onship in 1986 as Stanford swept the
team and singles titles in both men's and

women's tennis. Gesting, years before she
would enroll on the Farm, was a 13-year
old Olympic springboard champion in the
1936 Olympic Games in Berlin. Watch
out for up-and-coming Chryste Gaines
(track and field).
H — Steve Hug (men's gymnastics)
Needing a gymnast for the list, I gave
the nod to the national champion in the
all-around (1972-74) and parallel bars
(1973-74) over Eric Hardgrave (baseball),
Dan Hanan (men's volleyball), Sonja Hen
ning (women's basketball), Tony Hill
(football), Ceci Hopp (cross country) and
Herbert Hoover (football).
