# Staying home
## Baseball won't get postseason bid 
### Robert Portnoy Senior staff writer 
The 48-team field for this
year's NCAA Division I Base
ball Championship was com
pleted yesterday, and two-time
defending national champion
Stanford was not included.
For the first time in three
years, the selection committee
did not choose the top four
teams from the highly
competitive Pacific 10 Confer
ence Southern Division. The
fourth-place Cardinal's 30-28
overall record contributed to its
downfall.
"We feel we got burned a
little bit, but with our overall
record, we didn't deserve to
go," Stanford leftfielder Troy
Paulsen said.
Stanford closed the season
in top form, winning nine of
its last 10 games and beating
nationally-ranked Arizona, the
Six-Pac champion, and Pepper
dine, winner of the West Coast
Athletic Conference, in the
process.
"We dug our own grave early
in the year. We did a good job
to try and get out of it at the
end, but it wasn't enough. It's
disappointing, but it's not like
we deserve it," senior second
baseman Frank Carey said.

Stanford's record against Di
vision I opponents was another
troublesome area. The Cardi
nal was just 27-28 against Di
vision I teams, making it very
difficult to secure an at-large
bid to post-season play.
"There are so many games
we can look back on and say,
'One play here, one play there,
and we might have won.'
That's why it's so important
to win the [non-conference
games]," Paulsen said.
Except for an early three
game sweep of Loyola Mary
mount — which received an
at-large bid as the second-place
team in the WCAC — and a
season-ending two-game sweep
of Pepperdine, Stanford's per
formance outside the Six-Pac
was subpar.
The Cardinal dropped two of
three to UC-Santa Barbara and
Cal State-Fullerton, two to San
Jose State and two of four to
Santa Clara. Included in Stan
ford's non-conference losses
was an embarassing 6-4 defeat
at the University of San Fran
cisco.
"If we could have just won
two or three more non-league
games, we might have gotten
in. They've taken fourth-place
Six-Pac teams before, but
they've had good overall records.
We didn't this year," Paulsen said.
Nonetheless, several teams that
otherwise may not have received
invitations got into the NCAA
Regionals by way of year-end con
ference tournaments. Included in
this group are Hawaii (40-25) in
the Western Athletic Conference,
Auburn (42-18) in the Southeast
ern Conference and Indiana State
(46-19-1) in the Missouri Valley
Conference. Each of these teams
sport better records, but tiny
Rider College of Lawrenceville,
N.J., won the East Coast Athletic
Conference tournament to get in
with a 25-21-2 record.
"There were three or four up
sets in conference tournaments.
It's like the basketball tourna
ment. You have to judge a team
by the entire season. We didn't
have a good year, but at the same
time there are teams in [the
regionals] that don't belong on
the same field as us," Carey said.
