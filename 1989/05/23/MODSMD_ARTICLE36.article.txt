# 'Talented three' boost women's golf into NCAAs
## 
### David Hirning Staff writer 
When the Stanford women's
golf team failed to make the cut
for the NCAA tournament last
spring, Coach Tim Baldwin knew
he needed to bring in some impact
players or be faced with the
prospect of spectating at his own
party the next season.
Star senior Kay Cornelius was
graduating, and to wind up in the
17-team NCAA tournament that
would be held at Stanford Golf
Course in May 1989 seemed a tall
order. Enter Stephanie Davis,
Adele Moore, and Audrey
Wooding.
The tournament starts tomor
row, and thanks largely to those
three freshman golfers, the Car
dinal will be in there swinging for
an NCAA title. But the Road to
the Final 17 was by no means a
walk in the park, and along the
way there have been a few strange
twists and turns. For instance,
would you believe. . .a pick-up
game of HORSE?
Actually, a large part of this
road winds through the Evergreen
state of Washington, where two
of the three players grew up.
Davis and Wooding come from
Bainbridge Island and Tacoma,
respectively, and they have known
each other since they were 11
years old.
The two became interested in
attending Stanford for different
reasons: Davis because two of her
brothers and her parents attended

the school, and Wooding because
her sister was recruited by
Baldwin but was not admitted.
But each knew Stanford was her
first choice, and each was nervous
about getting in.
"I didn't know if we both could
get in — 1 thought one of us
would get bumped, and Steph had
the edge because her whole family
had gone here," Wooding said.
"Senior year we were both kind
of nervous, and we didn't keep in
contact as much."
But, apparently, there were no
quotas on female golfers from
western Washington, and
Wooding and Davis became team
mates last fall. There they were
joined by the No. 1 recruit in the
nation, Adele Moore. Or was that,
Adele "No More"?
The unpleasant nickname was
planted on the Dallas Tex. golf
prodigy after she broke her ankle
playing basketball in March of her
senior year. "It was six days after
I had committed to Stanford, and
I was scared to tell Coach
(Baldwin)," she remembered.
Moore had a back problem earlier
in her career, and now her ankle
was, as Baldwin put it,
"smashed."
Although many had their
doubts as to her ability to come
back completely, Moore was de
termined. "I think a lot of people
underestimated my ability to
rehabilitate," she said.
"No one thought 1 could, and

collegiate Tournament May 8 at the Stanford Golf Course, site of
the NCAA Women's Golf Championships that begin Wednesday.
no one really knew. But I was so
determined to get back that I
started really working. It turned
out fine."
Those same skeptics told
Baldwin that he had lost his best
recruit, that she'd never play golf
again. But Baldwin said then, and
says today, "I would take Adele
Moore in a wheelchair."
Of course, Stanford fans know
the rest of the story. Moore
showed up at Stanford sans wheel
chair and teamed with Davis,
Wooding, sophomore Jodi Figley
and junior Stephanie Parel to
reestablish the team as an NCAA
factor. Moore leads the team with
a stroke average of 77.3 and has
three top-10 finishes to her name.
Davis and Wooding have not ex
actly stood by to watch Moore and
wait until next year. "I don't feel
at all like I'm living in a shadow.
I don't feel like she's out of my
reach ," Wooding said.
"I expected to play. I missed

one trip this year, and it really
ticked me off. It motivated me. I
figured if I worked hard enough,
I could play."
And play she has. She came
back after missing that trip to
finish first on the Stanford team
at the University of Arizona tour
nament. Her last two finishes
were an 11th and an eighth place.
Davis, a bit more mild

mannered, was not as confident
that she would be a steady con
tributor this year. "Almost every
one on our team is a top recruit,
so I knew the competition was
going to be tough. I really didn't
expect to play in every tourna
ment."
But Davis has indeed been"the
rock" this year, playing and
scoring well in every tournament
and leading the team with a 233
at the Lady Sun Devil Invitation
al. Baldwin has marveled at the
performance of his two "un
known" freshmen. "Adele Moore
had the experience (on the junior
tour). Audrey and Stephanie have
really gained it."
But with all this success, one
might think that the freshmen
would become the Three Mus
keteers and fail to blend with the
rest of the team. Not true, says
veteran sophomore Jodi Figley.
"They fit in with the team so
well," Figley says."And I don't
know where we'd be without the
three of them. They've started on
the team from the beginning, and
they've been a real surprise."
Baldwin is the genius behind

this class, a class that is the pres
ent but also must be the future,
as no recruit was admitted this
year. Did he expect all this from
the trio? "I expected them to play,
but I didn't expect us to rely on
them as much as we have. They'vfe
become mainstays of the team, all
three of them."
The three are just starting to
realize how good they can be, an<J
as the whole team gets to know
one another, good things happen,
"We're all different, distinct per.
sonalities, and it took about half
the year to figure that out, *
Moore said. "The past two of;
three tournaments have been
great. We're really unified, and
we're pulling a lot more for each
other."
And, as Figley reports, this is
a big change from last year's team
that didn't make the postseason
"I can honestly say last year thai
the unity was not there. It couic
be the three freshmen, their per
sonality." And just maybe, tha'
combination of unity and golf wil
give Figley and her young team
mates the NCAA crown in their
own backyard.

this class, a class that is the pres
ent but also must be the future,
as no recruit was admitted this
year. Did he expect all this from
the trio? "I expected them to play,
but I didn't expect us to rely on
them as much as we have. They'vfe
become mainstays of the team, all
three of them."
The three are just starting to
realize how good they can be, an<J
as the whole team gets to know
one another, good things happen,
"We're all different, distinct per.
sonalities, and it took about half
the year to figure that out, *
Moore said. "The past two of;
three tournaments have been
great. We're really unified, and
we're pulling a lot more for each
other."
And, as Figley reports, this is
a big change from last year's team
that didn't make the postseason
"I can honestly say last year thai
the unity was not there. It couic
be the three freshmen, their per
sonality." And just maybe, tha'
combination of unity and golf wil
give Figley and her young team
mates the NCAA crown in their
own backyard.


Adele Moore
When the Stanford women's
golf team failed to make the cut
for the NCAA tournament last
spring, Coach Tim Baldwin knew
he needed to bring in some impact
players or be faced with the
prospect of spectating at his own
party the next season.
Star senior Kay Cornelius was
graduating, and to wind up in the
17-team NCAA tournament that
would be held at Stanford Golf
Course in May 1989 seemed a tall
order. Enter Stephanie Davis,
Adele Moore, and Audrey
Wooding.
The tournament starts tomor
row, and thanks largely to those
three freshman golfers, the Car
dinal will be in there swinging for
an NCAA title. But the Road to
the Final 17 was by no means a
walk in the park, and along the
way there have been a few strange
twists and turns. For instance,
would you believe. . .a pick-up
game of HORSE?
Actually, a large part of this
road winds through the Evergreen
state of Washington, where two
of the three players grew up.
Davis and Wooding come from
Bainbridge Island and Tacoma,
respectively, and they have known
each other since they were 11
years old.
The two became interested in
attending Stanford for different
reasons: Davis because two of her
brothers and her parents attended

the school, and Wooding because
her sister was recruited by
Baldwin but was not admitted.
But each knew Stanford was her
first choice, and each was nervous
about getting in.
"I didn't know if we both could
get in — 1 thought one of us
would get bumped, and Steph had
the edge because her whole family
had gone here," Wooding said.
"Senior year we were both kind
of nervous, and we didn't keep in
contact as much."
But, apparently, there were no
quotas on female golfers from
western Washington, and
Wooding and Davis became team
mates last fall. There they were
joined by the No. 1 recruit in the
nation, Adele Moore. Or was that,
Adele "No More"?
The unpleasant nickname was
planted on the Dallas Tex. golf
prodigy after she broke her ankle
playing basketball in March of her
senior year. "It was six days after
I had committed to Stanford, and
I was scared to tell Coach
(Baldwin)," she remembered.
Moore had a back problem earlier
in her career, and now her ankle
was, as Baldwin put it,
"smashed."
Although many had their
doubts as to her ability to come
back completely, Moore was de
termined. "I think a lot of people
underestimated my ability to
rehabilitate," she said.
"No one thought 1 could, and

Freshman Audrey Wooding finished eighth at the California Inter
collegiate Tournament May 8 at the Stanford Golf Course, site of
the NCAA Women's Golf Championships that begin Wednesday.
no one really knew. But I was so
determined to get back that I
started really working. It turned
out fine."
Those same skeptics told
Baldwin that he had lost his best
recruit, that she'd never play golf
again. But Baldwin said then, and
says today, "I would take Adele
Moore in a wheelchair."
Of course, Stanford fans know
the rest of the story. Moore
showed up at Stanford sans wheel
chair and teamed with Davis,
Wooding, sophomore Jodi Figley
and junior Stephanie Parel to
reestablish the team as an NCAA
factor. Moore leads the team with
a stroke average of 77.3 and has
three top-10 finishes to her name.
Davis and Wooding have not ex
actly stood by to watch Moore and
wait until next year. "I don't feel
at all like I'm living in a shadow.
I don't feel like she's out of my
reach ," Wooding said.
"I expected to play. I missed

one trip this year, and it really
ticked me off. It motivated me. I
figured if I worked hard enough,
I could play."
And play she has. She came
back after missing that trip to
finish first on the Stanford team
at the University of Arizona tour
nament. Her last two finishes
were an 11th and an eighth place.
Davis, a bit more mild

mannered, was not as confident
that she would be a steady con
tributor this year. "Almost every
one on our team is a top recruit,
so I knew the competition was
going to be tough. I really didn't
expect to play in every tourna
ment."
But Davis has indeed been"the
rock" this year, playing and
scoring well in every tournament
and leading the team with a 233
at the Lady Sun Devil Invitation
al. Baldwin has marveled at the
performance of his two "un
known" freshmen. "Adele Moore
had the experience (on the junior
tour). Audrey and Stephanie have
really gained it."
But with all this success, one
might think that the freshmen
would become the Three Mus
keteers and fail to blend with the
rest of the team. Not true, says
veteran sophomore Jodi Figley.
"They fit in with the team so
well," Figley says."And I don't
know where we'd be without the
three of them. They've started on
the team from the beginning, and
they've been a real surprise."
