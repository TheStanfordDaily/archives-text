# 'Talented three' boost women's golf into NCAAs
## 
### David Hirning Staff writer 
When the Stanford women's
golf team failed to make the cut
for the NCAA tournament last
spring, Coach Tim Baldwin knew
he needed to bring in some impact
players or be faced with the
prospect of spectating at his own
party the next season.
Star senior Kay Cornelius was
graduating, and to wind up in the
17-team NCAA tournament that
would be held at Stanford Golf
Course in May 1989 seemed a tall
order. Enter Stephanie Davis,
Adele Moore, and Audrey
Wooding.
The tournament starts tomor
row, and thanks largely to those
three freshman golfers, the Car
dinal will be in there swinging for
an NCAA title. But the Road to
the Final 17 was by no means a
walk in the park, and along the
way there have been a few strange
twists and turns. For instance,
would you believe. . .a pick-up
game of HORSE?
Actually, a large part of this
road winds through the Evergreen
state of Washington, where two
of the three players grew up.
Davis and Wooding come from
Bainbridge Island and Tacoma,
respectively, and they have known
each other since they were 11
years old.
The two became interested in
attending Stanford for different
reasons: Davis because two of her
brothers and her parents attended

the school, and Wooding because
her sister was recruited by
Baldwin but was not admitted.
But each knew Stanford was her
first choice, and each was nervous
about getting in.
"I didn't know if we both could
get in — 1 thought one of us
would get bumped, and Steph had
the edge because her whole family
had gone here," Wooding said.
"Senior year we were both kind
of nervous, and we didn't keep in
contact as much."
But, apparently, there were no
quotas on female golfers from
western Washington, and
Wooding and Davis became team
mates last fall. There they were
joined by the No. 1 recruit in the
nation, Adele Moore. Or was that,
Adele "No More"?
The unpleasant nickname was
planted on the Dallas Tex. golf
prodigy after she broke her ankle
playing basketball in March of her
senior year. "It was six days after
I had committed to Stanford, and
I was scared to tell Coach
(Baldwin)," she remembered.
Moore had a back problem earlier
in her career, and now her ankle
was, as Baldwin put it,
"smashed."
Although many had their
doubts as to her ability to come
back completely, Moore was de
termined. "I think a lot of people
underestimated my ability to
rehabilitate," she said.
"No one thought 1 could, and
