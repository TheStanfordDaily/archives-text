# Fundamental Standard interpretation put on hold until fall
## 
### Jonathan Eisenberg Staff writer 
With the end of the academic year
closing in on them, members of the Stu
dent Conduct Legislative Council decided
to postpone any more action on their
second proposed interpretation of the
Fundamental Standard until next year.
"The clock starts over" in the fall for
debates over the current proposal, SCLC
Chair George Parker told The Daily after
the 12-person council opted May 12 to
stop work on the second proposal, made
public April 19.
There is "no time to proceed with it
this year," he said.
Judicial Affairs Officer Sally Cole, a
non-voting council member, said the de

cision to stop the legislative process
"reflects the belief of . . . some members
that the current draft needs more work."
Parker, a Graduate School of Business
professor, said he cannot predict whether
next year's council will build on the pres
ent proposal but said he hopes they will
continue to look at the Standard.
The goal of the council's deliberations,
which began last fall, was not necessarily
to enact legislation. Rather, the council
aimed to heighten consciousness about
the Fundamental Standard and the elim
ination of racism, sexism and homophobia
on campus, according to Parker.
Throughout the year, the council has
taken an in-depth look at the 83-year-old
Fundamental Standard. The council's
debate pitted First Amendment rights of

free expression against the sometimes
conflicting interest of prohibiting discrim
inatory harassment on campus.
According to the University's legisla
tive process, the council could have
rushed to enact the second proposal with
revisions before the end of June, but at
a Faculty Senate meeting University
President Donald Kennedy urged the
council to allow more time for community
discussion of the proposal.
Law Prof. Thomas Grey, who helped
the council draft its second proposal,
could not predict whether the new pro
posal has a chance of passing next year.
"It depends on who's on the SCLC and
campus dynamics," he said.
The six faculty members and five stu
dents on the council are all appointed to

one-year terms. The only permanent
member of the SCLC is Cole.
Parker said the present council has
encouraged next year's group to continue
the attempt to draft an acceptable inter
pretation.
Parker added, "My guess is that they
will generate numerous ideas of their
own, conceivably incorporating ideas of
ours."
Council member Eric Li, a sophomore,
said next year's council will make the
issue of interpreting the Standard a pri
ority because it is "the only thing we've
been working on this year."
At this point, the make-up of next
year's council is uncertain.
Parker said he will not head the council
next year and that no faculty member

of the council has expressed a desire to
serve again.
Things are also unclear as to who next
year's five student members will be. Of
the five students, three are elected by
the student body and two are ex-officio
members representing the Council of
Presidents and the ASSU Senate.
Tino Pena and Perry Friedman were
elected to the council this spring. Senior
Leonard Adler, who may go to graduate
school in the East, was the top vote-getter
in the council race but will be ineligible
to serve on the council if he does not
enroll here in the fall. Alternate Ravi
Bellur, a freshman, will join Pena and
Friedman on the coucil if Adler does not
serve.
