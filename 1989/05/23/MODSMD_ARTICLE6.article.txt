### Pam Weisz Staff writer 
Since authorities in Beijing im
posed a total news blockade on
Friday, much of China has been
kept in the dark about protests
in the country's capital. As of last
night, one source of information
for the troubled country is a fax
machine located in Stanford's
Rains apartment complex.
The faxing project is the work
of one group in the Association
of Chinese Students and Scholars
at Stanford, which is made up of
11 task force groups currently
working together on a variety of
projects. In addition, Chinese stu
dents at Stanford have responded
to the unrest in China with rallies
and donations of money.

Due to the news blockade, "We
know more" than most of the Chi
nese population does about what
is happening in Beijing, according
to Huang Jingsheng, who is the
coordinator of the association.
Huang, a graduate student in
sociology, said the primary pur
pose of the fax machine will be
to send news of protests in Beijing
to other provinces in China.
The Stanford group currently
has 90 fax numbers in China, ac
cording to Charlie Xiao, a gradu
ate student in mechanical
engineering who is in charge of
the faxing operation. Most of
these are numbers of businesses
in China, according to Huang.
The group will also use the fax
machine to send messages of sup
port to the protesters in Beijing.
