# Popular poli sci class canceled
## 
### DJ Berinstein Senior staff writer 
Despite its renowned
popularity, Political Science 180,
Civil Rights and Civil Liberties,
will not be offered next year due
to financial constraints within
the department.
Jim Steyer, the lecturer for
the 250-student class, has not
decided whether he will con
tinue lecturing at Stanford or
discontinue teaching. He also
says he is unsure if he will con
tinue to teach a seminar dealing
with the same subject.
"I think it's a shame there's
no money to teach these issues,"
said Steyer. "I also think it's
dissappointing in the general
context for the future of under
graduate education. There have
been classes on this for years."
Political Science 180 is one of
the few classes in the Political
Science Department that deals
directly with minority discrimi
nation and gender issues. Over
the course of Steyer's four years
of teaching the class, enrollment
has almost quadrupled. The
class started with 103 students;
the next year it grew to 260,
then 400.
This year, however, the class
was sliced to 220, after close to
100 students had to be turned
away, according to Political Sci
ence Department secretary
Elizabeth Rafferty.
Steyer's class will be replaced
by a different political science
class taught by a law student
from another university. The
new course will focus on con
stitutional law, incorporating
civil rights as well as other areas
of law.
The cutting of the class came
about after Senior Assoc. Dean
of Humanities and Sciences Wal
ter Falcon told the Political Sci
ence Department it would have
limited funding for large lecture

classes. The department then
voted to add the new constitu
tional law class, thus ousting
Steyer's civil rights class.
A delegation of political sci
ence professors then went to Fal
con requesting to keep Steyer
on. As a result of this effort,
Steyer will still be allowed to
teach a seminar on the same
subject if he wants.
During his four years here,
Steyer has taught both a sem
inar and a lecture class. He says
he would have preferred to teach
the lecture class rather than the
seminar.
While The Daily tried to con
tact Political Science Chair
Steve Krasner. He has not re
turned any calls.
The University claims that
Steyer's class was too costly in
years past due to its volume of
teaching assistant s. Since Steyer
is a lecturer, not a professor,
the only cost of the class is his
teaching fee and the salaries of
his teaching assistants. In rela
tion to the number of students
last spring, Steyer hired no
more teaching assistants than
in other political science classes.

In addition, his TAs took pay
cuts to allow the class to be
taught at that size, according
to Rafferty. Most of the TAs are
from the Law School.
Steyer, who received his
undergraduate and law degree
from Stanford, is not in a tenure
track position, and he says he
does not want tenure. He does
not have a doctorate in political
science as does his successor.
The department claims that a
Ph.D. in political science is a
requisite for teaching in the de
partment, according to profes
sors in the department, includ
ing David Brady, David Danelski
and John Man ley.
"We've had a long-standing
desire to have a constitutional
law class taught by academic
faculty," said Brady, who ex
plained a need for a political
scientist teaching political sci
ence.
Steyer took the class over
from Danelski, currently the
head of the Stanford-in-
Washington program. Like
Steyer, Danelski is a lawyer, but
he has a doctorate in political
science. "Steyer is an adjunct
professor," Danelski said, "as
such, he's not a regular part of
the teaching faculty, and Stan
ford should have a regular mem
ber of the faculty teach the
class."
"We've always preferred to of
fer a constitutional law class
from our department," said
Brady. "It's what political sci
entists do, not what lawyers do.
We want someone with a long
publishing record."
Though Steyer has not pub
lished scholarly material, he en
joys the reputation of being a
dynamic teacher. Ninety-six per
cent of past student evaluations
have rated Steyer in the "excel
lent" or "good" category in


James Steyer
terms of the course, the content
and instructor's teaching, accord
ing to the compiled statistics on
student evaluations. Steyer also
received the Gores Teaching
Award.
Steyer was told that his teach
ing was difficult to evaluate, and
that student evaluations are
meaningless in terms of actual
ability, according to a source in
the Political Science Department.
"Student evaluations are
suspect," said Brady. "Someone
can be popular and not demand
ing." But Brady said he recog
nized Steyer's popularity, and ad
mitted that his popularity "was
taken into consideration."
However, Danelski said that
student evaluations are "the prin
ciple data" for evaluating teaching
since Stanford has no formal pro
gram of faculty visitation, "nor
would anyone want that."
Political Science Prof. David
Abernethy agreed that student
evaluations "are the standard way
to evaluate teaching."
Falcon was unavailable for com
ment on the budget cuts.
"People are not concerned with
teaching undergraduates here,"
said Bill Jackson, a third-year law
student who is a teaching assistant
for Steyer and was also an under
graduate at Stanford. "People
have been taking this class be
cause of word of mouth. If he
doesn't teach, the enrollment will
definitely go down."
"This is really sad," Jackson
continued. "It's the best class I've
ever TAed. I guess most univer
sities don't want teachers any
more."
"Not offering the class is a

travesty," Manley said. "It makes
for a very large hole in the cur
riculum, and the decision is awful.
A class that draws that many stu
dents ought to be offered, and the
money should be made available."
"I teach because these issues
need to be taught and because I
really love working with stu
dents," said Steyer, who has a full
time job as president of a state
wide children's advocacy organi
zation called Children Now.
"The class covers issues of great
importance to the realm of polit
ical science in the U.S. and issues
[the Undergraduate Committee
on Minority Issues] says should
be covered and where the number
of courses should be expanded,"
Steyer explained.
The UCMI released its report
last month, calling for an increase
in ethnic studies courses.
"UCMI should not be just about
hiring minorities, it should be
about hearing voices of minorities
and a civil rights class does exactly
that," said Shauna Jackson, who
took Steyer's class as an under
graduate. "I'm embarrassed that
as an a poli sci I only had
the opportunity to take one class
on the most relevant political
issue to my generation â€” that
being the 14th Amendment."
Brady admitted there are "cer
tain questions this University
needs to address, and we do need
to teach such courses." However,
according to Brady, the civil rights
class will be replaced by a class
that "will address some racial and
gender issues, although not as
much as Steyer's."
Despite the loss of funding for
his class, Steyer said he continues
to respect Stanford. "I really ap
preciate Stanford giving me the
opportunity to teach these very
important classes. Stanford has
been wonderful to me."
