# Two in a row: Men's netters are champs again
## Card knocks off Georgia for ninth title in 13 years 
### Cameron Macky Senior staff writer 
ATHENS, Ga. — At 4:35 Geor
gia time yesterday afternoon,
Martin Blackman wouldn't have
traded places with anyone in the
world.
Blackman was crouching at the
net, waiting for partner Jeff Cath
rall to serve to Georgia's A 1
Parker. The Cardinal pair had a
6-4, 5-4 lead in the No. 2 doubles
contest of the NCAA Champion
ship match, and Cathrall was
serving at three-all.
On two previous occasions in
the game, Blackman had crushed
Georgia service returns for Stan
ford points. Apparently, Parker
hadn't been paying attention.
After Cathrall fired, the Bulldog
sophomore hit his return right at
Blackman, and the lights went out
for Georgia. Game, set, match and
national championship, Stanford
Cardinal.
"That sure wasn't the loosest
shot I've ever hit," Blackman said
after his forehand volley gave the
Cardinal its second straight title
(and third of the last four years).
"I just tried to angle it off, to
make sure it wasn't close."
The shot wasn't close — the
Georgia players didn't have a
chance of getting to the ball —

but the rest of the match certainly
was. "At the start, we were in
pretty big trouble," Stanford
Coach Dick Gould said. "Things
change so quickly ... a couple of
matches could have gone either
way."
Fortunately for the Cardinal
players, most of the matches went
their way — including all of the
doubles contests. After the teams
split the six singles matches, Stan
ford's Alex O'Brien and Jeff
Tarango posted a quick 6-2, 6-2
win at No. 1 doubles to set up
Blackman and Cathrall's clincher.
"I'm really proud of our doubles
teams," Gould said. And with
good reason — Stanford lost ex
actly zero doubles matches during
the tournament (see related
story).
Just getting to the doubles
against the Bulldogs was an ac
complishment of sorts. In its three
previous wins, Georgia had
finished off its opponents in
singles. Not yesterday.
The marquee match of the day

was supposed to have been Geor
gia's Parker, who is ranked
seventh in the nation, against
Tarango, who is No. 11. However,
the supposed duel never devel
oped. Tarango fell apart early and
never came together — Parker
broke his serve three times in the
first set to go up 5-0.
With Parker serving for the set,
Tarango tried a new approach.
"Can we play again tomorrow?"
he asked. Nope. Parker cruised,
6-0, 6-3. Stanford 0, Georgia 1.
While Tarango was getting his
head handed to him, his doubles
partner was busy crushing Geor
gia senior T.J. Middleton at No.
4. O'Brion, who finished the week
as the only Stanford player to go
undefeated (see related story),
had no trouble at all with Mid
dleton, who bit the dirt 6-0, 6-1.
Stanford 1, Georgia 1.
At sixth singles, Barry Richards
had won his first set against Jack
Frierson, but dropped a break
early in the second to fall behind
2-0. He then broke back in the
seventh game and held for four
all, and went up 3-1 on Frierson's
serve in the next game.
Then the problems started. Ric
hards, who has been the Cardi
nal's most consistent player in
1989, sent a backhand wide and
then put another in the net for
three-all. The shots were reminis
cent of Richards' play the two pre
vious days, when he dropped back
to-back matches for the first time
all year.
"I had played aggressively
against Miami when we were in
doors (because of rain)," Richards
said. "But then the last two days,
after coming outside, 1 was more
tentative. That cost me
confidence-wise."
With the score knotted, Ric
hards finally got a break —
figuratively and literally — when
Frierson double-faulted.
Richards got to match point
when Frierson hit a service return
long, but Frierson tied the score
at three-all with a clutch volley
to the left corner. On the next
match point, both players played
it safe, exchanging shots from the
baseline.
Finally, after almost 45 seconds,
Richards had had enough. From
the left line, he hit a patented
forehand crossing shot just barely
inside the opposite sideline, out
of Frierson's reach.
"(Before) I had been playing not
to lose, instead of playing to win,"
Richards said. "Today, I did what
I should do, I came out and played
a little more aggressively." Stan
ford 2, Georgia 1.
The Cardinal's lead was short
lived, for Glenn Solomon fell 6-2,
6-2 to Jim Childs at No. 5. It was
Solomon's first loss of the week.
Stanford 2, Georgia 2.
That left Blackman and Cath
rall. Blackman broke Stephen
Enochs twice in the first set for
a 6-2 win, but couldn't hold serve
in the second. Enochs went up

4-1, gave back a break, but then
broke in the final game for a 6-3
win.
In the third set, the two were
on serve until Blackman came up
with a spectacular passing shot
that sent Enochs sprawling and
gave Blackman a 3-2 lead. He then
held and broke again for 5-2. Serv
ing for the match, he aced Enochs
for 2-1, crushed a volley for 3-1,
and, on match point, came up with
a huge serve that Enochs hit
straight into the ground. Stanford
3, Georgia 2.
Minutes later, Cathrall had
Bulldog Francisco Montana on the
ropes. The two had split the first
two sets, and with Montana serv
ing at one game each in the third,
Cathrall got to break point when
Montana hit a forehand wide.
After a short exchange, Cathrall
hit a gorgeous backhand shot from
the baseline that crossed to Mon
tana's left and nicked the sideline.
Cathrall leapt for joy, and the
break and a 2-1 lead were his.
Cathrall's celebration was pre
mature. Montana broke right
back, held and broke again when
he hit a racing crosscourt shot
right in front of Cathrall. Mon
tana held for 5-2, and broke yet
again when Cathrall put an over
head smash into the net. Stanford
3, Georgia 3.
The momentum had swung to
the Georgia side, but Tarango and
O'Brien stole it right back.

The members of the men's tennis team celebrate their championship shortly after the doubles team of Martin
Blackman and Jeff Cathrall clinched the title.
O'Brien opened the match against
Childs and Middleton by holding
serve, and the Cardinal pair then
broke at love. That was all they
needed in the first, as Tarango
put a forehand right down the
middle for a 6-2 win.
In the second set, O'Brien got
to a break point with three spec
tacular volleys, and Middleton hit
his next forehand long to give
away the break. Stanford broke
again in the fourth game and was
up 5-1 with Tarango serving.
First point: volley slam by
O'Brien. Second point: Georgia
hits the service return long. Third
point: long return again. Fourth
and final point: return straight
into the net, 6-2, 6-1. Stanford 4,
Georgia 3.
"We came out knowing what
we had to do," O'Brien said. "We

stayed out there and just fought."
With their fight over, Tarango
and O'Brien watched the other
two doubles matches. Richards
and Dan Turbow won their first
set 6-2 and were on serve down
4-3 in the second, but Cathrall
and Blackman won the race to
clinch the title — the Cardinal's
sixth of the decade.
Card notes
In the awards ceremony after the
match, Gould mentioned a Daily
column that had predicted which
Stanford teams had shots at national
championships this year. Men's tennis
wasn't one of the sports named. The
word here is that if said columnist
knows what's good for him, he'll print
a full retraction this Friday.
