# Two in a row: Men's netters are champs again
## Card knocks off Georgia for ninth title in 13 years 
### Cameron Macky Senior staff writer 
ATHENS, Ga. — At 4:35 Geor
gia time yesterday afternoon,
Martin Blackman wouldn't have
traded places with anyone in the
world.
Blackman was crouching at the
net, waiting for partner Jeff Cath
rall to serve to Georgia's A 1
Parker. The Cardinal pair had a
6-4, 5-4 lead in the No. 2 doubles
contest of the NCAA Champion
ship match, and Cathrall was
serving at three-all.
On two previous occasions in
the game, Blackman had crushed
Georgia service returns for Stan
ford points. Apparently, Parker
hadn't been paying attention.
After Cathrall fired, the Bulldog
sophomore hit his return right at
Blackman, and the lights went out
for Georgia. Game, set, match and
national championship, Stanford
Cardinal.
"That sure wasn't the loosest
shot I've ever hit," Blackman said
after his forehand volley gave the
Cardinal its second straight title
(and third of the last four years).
"I just tried to angle it off, to
make sure it wasn't close."
The shot wasn't close — the
Georgia players didn't have a
chance of getting to the ball —

but the rest of the match certainly
was. "At the start, we were in
pretty big trouble," Stanford
Coach Dick Gould said. "Things
change so quickly ... a couple of
matches could have gone either
way."
Fortunately for the Cardinal
players, most of the matches went
their way — including all of the
doubles contests. After the teams
split the six singles matches, Stan
ford's Alex O'Brien and Jeff
Tarango posted a quick 6-2, 6-2
win at No. 1 doubles to set up
Blackman and Cathrall's clincher.
"I'm really proud of our doubles
teams," Gould said. And with
good reason — Stanford lost ex
actly zero doubles matches during
the tournament (see related
story).
Just getting to the doubles
against the Bulldogs was an ac
complishment of sorts. In its three
previous wins, Georgia had
finished off its opponents in
singles. Not yesterday.
The marquee match of the day
