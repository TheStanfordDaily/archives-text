# Wright's lawyer moves for dismissal

WASHINGTON (AP) -
Lawyers for House Speaker Jim
Wright and the ethics committee
clashed yesterday over whether
the panel had stretched the rules
when it charged the nation's high
est elected Democrat with 69 eth
ics violations.
Wright's Houston lawyer, Step
hen Susman, pleaded with the
committee to "stand in the way
of a lynch mob" seeking to oust
Wright and asked that the panel
reject what he termed the
speaker's persecution by the
panel's special outside counsel,
Richard Phelan.
"To say Jim Wright should be
condemned because he went close
to the line is not fair," Susman
said ir. arguing that the panel
should dismiss the most serious
charges against his client.

But Phelan, a
Chicago attorney,
declared that
Wright is resting
his case on
"legalisms," and
he said ethics
rules should be
interpreted
not treated like
tax laws where

searching for loopholes is an ac
cepted practice.
"We are dealing with the con
fidence of the American public,"
Phelan said. "Are we to look at
the rules through the prism of
the most nearsighted, myopic per
son that we can?"
The unusual trial-like proceed
ing was held in a House hearing
room before TV cameras, with
Wright's counsel and the ethics

committee's team, led by Phelan,
on opposite sides. Wright himself
watched on television and did not
attend, but his wife Betty sat in
the front row.
A decision on the motion was
expected as early as today.
It was just the first open skir
mish in the nearly year-long eth
ics probe of Wright which has
thrown his political survival into
doubt. The speaker is still likely
to face a disciplinary hearing
before the ethics panel to deter
mine whether charges against him
have been clearly and convincingly
proven, and possible punishment
by the full House.
Another member of Wright's le
gal team, William Oldaker, had
conceded in advance of yester
day's hearing that motions to dis

miss charges are routinely denied,
and that chances that the com
mittee would rule in Wright's fa
vor when it meets today were less
than even. Wright's motion essen
tially asks the panel to reverse an
interpretation of the rules it made
last month.
But Susman, pleading for the
panel to reconsider, read a pas
sage from Wright's book which is
the basis for some of the charges
and asked each member of the
committee to "doubt a little of his
own infallibility."
Whatever the legal outcome,
some in the House were already
writing Wright's political
obituary, saying he had been so
tainted by the charges that he
could no longer serve effectively
as the Democrats' most visible na
tional spokesman.
