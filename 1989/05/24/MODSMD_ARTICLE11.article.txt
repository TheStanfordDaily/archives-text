CASABLANCA, Morocco (AP)
â€” King Hassan II yesterday wel
comed Egypt back to the Arab
League after 10 years of ostracism
as he opened a summit conference
focusing on sharp divisions over
Lebanon and the Palestinians.
Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak urged greater solidarity
among the league's 22 member
nations and said the Arab world
hopes this conference will mark a
"new dawn."
Hassan said he was happy to
see the Egyptian leader "here
among us, representing his people,
the people of Arab Egypt who have
fought and struggled for a half
century in support of Arab
rights."

Twenty-one Arab leaders are at
tending the two-day summit, in
cluding Col. Moammar Gadhafi
of Libya, who had threatened to
boycott the meeting in protest
over Egypt's readmission.
Only Lebanon, ruled by rival
Christian and Moslem govern
ments, was not represented for the
first time since the Arab League
was formed in 1945.
Hassan greeted his guests at
the entrance to the palace as they
began arriving separately at 6
p.m. in bulletproof limousines.
The king did not embrace Gad
hafi, as he had the other leaders.
The leaders held a two-hour in
formal session and convened again
behind closed doors after speeches

by Hassan and Mubarak. Confer
ence sources said the main topic
was Lebanon.
Mubarak, reading from a
prepared text, called the gathering
"an historical conference, conven
ing in an atmosphere of brother
hood." He warned against "was
ting time and opportunities."
Inter-Arab difference, Mubarak
said, are "inevitable," but "disa
greement should not lead to quar
rel."
He called for a wider Arab role
in international efforts for global
peace and for closer cooperation
with the 12-nation European Eco
nomic Community.
Mubarak said the crisis in
Lebanon "has truly become an im

mense problem, exhausting us
and exhausting our consciences."
"We must all work for the one
aim of overcoming this crisis
before the fire bums us all," he
said.
He said Arabs should start by
backing a six-man Arab panel that
has been trying to defuse the
crisis so it could "arrange national
reconciliation, ensure the with
drawal of all foreign forces and
revive the constitutional bodies so
they can carry out their duties."
Lebanon's seat remained vacant
after a preparatory meeting of
foreign ministers failed to agree
on which leader should represent
the country, torn by 14 years of
civil war.
