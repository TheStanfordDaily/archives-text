PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP)
— A Latin American mission to
help resolve Panama's political
crisis arrived to a mixed reception
yesterday and took a conciliatory
tone.
"We are going to try to facilitate
dialogue among Panamanians.
This is a situation that only Pan
amanians can resolve," said
Foreign Minister Diego Cordovez
of Ecuador, one of four delegates
from the Organization of Ameri
can States.
They are investigating charges
that Panama's de facto ruler, Gen.
Manuel Antonio Noriega, nullified
national elections to prevent an
opposition victory.
In Washington, defense officials
said the United States was send
ing armed military convoys on

trips across Panama to "flex our
muscles" and draw a line against
Panamanian harassment.
Two convoys of 10 or so vehicles
carrying armed soldiers have
crossed without incident in either
directions under escort by Pana
manian soldiers, as provided in
the canal treaties, the officials
said on condition of anonymity.
Rafael Vargas Santos, ambassa
dor to Haiti, said in Port-au-
Prince the government would
destroy the Panama Canal in the
event of a U.S. invasion.
"We will not be taken by
surprise because we are already
prepared," he said on Radio Haiti
Inter. "The first thing we will do
is blow up the canal."
Opposition leaders in Panama,
who want their May 7 president ial

election victory recognized, wel
comed the delegation and said the
Pan-American organization "has
understood the urgent need to
act."
But the government proclaimed
it would not accept any inter
ference in Panama's internal af
fairs. Government-controlled
media accused the organization of
prejudging the case.
The Latin American organiza
tion last week denounced Noriega
and called for a swift transfer of
power.
Solis Palma's government
issued a proclamation night say
ing parts of the organization's res
olution violate its charter, includ
ing the "ill-willed" mention of
Noriega.
