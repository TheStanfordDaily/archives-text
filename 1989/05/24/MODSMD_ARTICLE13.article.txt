NATO dispute remains unresolved
WASHINGTON (AP) - The United States is
not satisfied with a new West German proposal
for resolving a NATO dispute over short-range
missiles and "there is still a gap to bridge,"
Secretary of State James Baker 111 said yesterday.
Baker said he hoped the disagreement could
be settled before Monday's opening of a 16-
member NATO summit in Brussels but said
there's no assurance that will happen.
He said the "stumbling block" was how to draft
a compromise plan that would take into account
the new mood in Western Europe for greater
disarmament while preserving an "adequate
deterrence."
"The alliance has survived many greater
threats to its existence than this and we remain
quite hopeful that we'll get his resolved and that

we'll get it resolved before the summit," Baker
said. "We may not get it resolved before the
summit."
World population growth surges
WASHINGTON (AP) — Humankind's growth
is accelerating again as the world adds the equiv
alent of another Mexico every year, the Popula
tion Reference Bureau reported yesterday.
The private research group said that the
world's population growth, after having slowed
in the 19705, is speeding up once more. As of
mid-1989, the world will contain about 5.24 billion
people, nearly a quarter-billion more than in
1987.
The world is adding about 90 million people
per year, slightly more than the current Mexican
population estimated at 87 million.
