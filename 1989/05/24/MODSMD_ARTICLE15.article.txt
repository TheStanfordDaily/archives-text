## Struggling students 
### 
Those here on campus
are helping students in
China keep up the fight

ON APRIL 27, university
students first broke
through lines of soldiers
and police in Beijing, boldly chal
lenging a totalitarian govern
ment. The students' cause has
rapidly snowballed. In the past
two weeks more than one million
citizens have occupied Tianan
men Square, squaring off against
Chinese troops.
Outside the San Francisco con
sulate last Sunday, more than
100 Stanford students also
banded together, declaring their
own break from the country's 40-
year-old communist regime.
The cry for basic human and
educational rights in China is
resounding on this campus. And
the community here has mobil
ized to support the students'
cause.
Although the battle in Beijing
is 17,000 miles away, the effort
to send food, clothing, news —
and demands — to China has
kept the fight for the country's
democracy alive at Stanford.
Jeopardizing their own lives,
Stanford Chinese students pre
sented a petition to the San Fran
cisco consulate demanding the

resignation of the communist
regime and the establishment of
a pro-democratic leadership. If
the Li-Deng regime does not
topple, these students might face
punishment and suffering once
they return home.
Communist leaders have called
in their soldiers to quell the mas
sive street demonstration and
have also imposed a news block
ade to keep the rest of China in
the dark.
By setting up a facsimile ma
chine operation that will send
news of the protest to other Chi
nese provinces, a group of Stan
ford students hopes to keep as
many as 90 different Chinese
businesses informed about the
movement.
While the presence of the Chi
nese army threatens a violent
suppression of the tens of thou
sands of Bejing protesters, Stan
ford students have helped keep
the protesters strong by contri
buting $9,000 to the cause.
But protesters' funds are dwin
dling and contributions must
keep coming in. Money from Chi
nese citizens, who earn about $30
a month, is thinning down. The
demonstrators need an estimated
$40,000 daily to cover food costs
and medical expenses.
Members of this community
can send checks to ACSSS, P.O.
Box 8827, Stanford, CA 94309
or call 494-8399 for more infor
mation.
