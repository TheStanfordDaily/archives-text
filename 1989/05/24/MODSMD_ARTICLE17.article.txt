## Genetic discrimination ? 
### 
ANEW AGE in medical science, and,
I hope, in policy-making, is near.
The recent revolution in
molecular biology and genetics has al
lowed scientists to gather a wealth of
information about the origins of human
disease, and it is now known that more
than 3000 diseases, including cancer,
have genetic components.
Ongoing research and a current project
proposal to map the entire human
genome, now in Congress trying to get
some $3 billion in funding, will provide
even more information about the human
individual. The benefits of such efforts
would significantly improve current dis
ease diagnosis and therapy.
In the future, ever-improving technol
ogy could revolutionize medicine. Instead
of administering preventive drugs to a
diseased patient, doctors could essentially
replace a defective gene with a normal
copy of the gene, getting down to the
core or origin of the problem.
Prenatal diagnosis could be improved
to the extent that doctors could identify
a genetic defect and treat the fetus while
in the womb. These are real possibilities.
But the same wealth of information
that may allow for these new possibilities
for life may also lead to the of
such technology and information, and it
could provide the basis of the new pos
sibility for discrimination.
The results of human genome mapping
and other current studies will clearly lead
to the development of genetic tests in
which a company or an insurance agency
will be able to screen an applicant for
potential genetic diseases.
Picture this scenario.

It is the year 2000, and you are married
and pretty comfortable (and in your 30s).
For the sake of family security, you decide
to purchase a life insurance policy
It shouldn't be a problem because you
are healthy and athletic. At Stanford,
you started a good habit of running the
Dish three times a week and you often
swam at Roble pool. You still swim and
run regularly, you don't smoke, and you
eat right. What could be more perfect
for those insurance companies?
But when you are genetically tested,
the computer finds that you have a de
fective copy of a gene, and the chance of
getting a certain disease is doubled. No
one will offer you life insurance or health
insurance, no matter who you are.
It's also easy to imagine a similar sort
of rejection based on genetic testing when
you are applying to a company for a job.
For example, consider the widespread
screening of sickle-cell anemia in the
United States in the early '70s.
Sickle-cell anemia is an inherited blood
disease that predominantly affects blacks.
Heterozygous carriers of the disease —
who only carry the gene but are not
adversely affected by it — were still
denied jobs as airline pilots and other
positions. This example shows that ge
netic technology has some potential
hazards.
Obviously, the coming of the new age
in medical science will have to be followed
by a new era in policy-making. Law
makers will have to weigh the rights of
the individual against the rights of the
insurance company or employer.
Decisions of voluntary or mandatory

testing will have to be made carefully,
and we'll need to put certain constraints
upon the way genetic information is used.
A whole new aspect of policy will have
to be considered. The U.S. Constitution
does not protect U.S. citizens from dis
crimination based upon one's genome.
But employers, by law, cannot discrimi
nate against the handicapped.
Will applicants found to have defective
genes only leading to the increased risk
of disease be protected under law? The
definition of handicapped in the lawbooks
may have to l>e redefined.
Theoretically, it will one day be possible
to have every person's unique DNA "fin
gerprint" stored on computer. A single
strand of hair from a crime scene can be
analyzed and traced to the criminal. This
technique would be powerful, but incred
ibly frightening — it conjures up images
of Big Brother.
But I am not trying to instill fear in
you. I am just reminding the humanist
as well as the scientist that the coming
advances in science will continue to chal
lenge everyone — scientifically and
humanistically.

hazards.
Obviously, the coming of the new age
in medical science will have to be followed
by a new era in policy-making. Law
makers will have to weigh the rights of
the individual against the rights of the
insurance company or employer.
Decisions of voluntary or mandatory

testing will have to be made carefully,
and we'll need to put certain constraints
upon the way genetic information is used.
A whole new aspect of policy will have
to be considered. The U.S. Constitution
does not protect U.S. citizens from dis
crimination based upon one's genome.
But employers, by law, cannot discrimi
nate against the handicapped.
Will applicants found to have defective
genes only leading to the increased risk
of disease be protected under law? The
definition of handicapped in the lawbooks
may have to l>e redefined.
Theoretically, it will one day be possible
to have every person's unique DNA "fin
gerprint" stored on computer. A single
strand of hair from a crime scene can be
analyzed and traced to the criminal. This
technique would be powerful, but incred
ibly frightening — it conjures up images
of Big Brother.
But I am not trying to instill fear in
you. I am just reminding the humanist
as well as the scientist that the coming
advances in science will continue to chal
lenge everyone — scientifically and
humanistically.
