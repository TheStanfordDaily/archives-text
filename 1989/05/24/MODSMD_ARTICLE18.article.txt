## Fraternity party sign betrayed lack of sensitivity 
### 
I AM PLEASED to have taken part
in the Rape Education Project's
Rape Awareness Week during the
past week. My hopes for a rape-free
culture were especially buoyed during
the May 18 Take Back the Night
March when we turned off Campus
Drive onto Mayfield Avenue heading
towards the Braun Music Building.
Each of the student houses there had
candles in windows or on porches as a
statement of support for the march.
Given the sometimes unfair indict
ment that fraternities are given on
rape, I was especially pleased to see
both the Beta Fraternity and Sigma
Chi Fraternity houses visibly support
ing the march. Members of the two
fraternities came outside to greet us as

we marched by their respective houses.
Unfortunately, however, not all
Stanford fraternities seem to have
taken Rape Awareness Week to heart
as well as the Betas and Sigma Chis.
On May 19, the Theta Xi house spon
sored a Greek-style toga party. Above
the front door all evening was a ban
ner which read "Vidi, vici, veni."
At first I thought the Taxis had
misquoted Julius Caesar's famous
words of war "Veni, vidi, vici" ("I
came, I saw, I conquered"). I did not
understand why anyone would have a
theme party glorifying war. Later,
however, I realized the misquote must
have been a sex-oriented play on words
with the sign intentionally reading "I

saw, I conquered, I came."
Apparently, some members of Taxi
Fraternity believe sex ("I came")
should be a natural and progressive
outcome of objectification ("I saw")
and domination ("I conquered"). Or if
they do not believe that this is the
way sex should be, they apparently
think considering sex in this way is
cleverly humorous.
Either way, the Taxi members re
sponsible for this sign need to be
aware of how deeply saturated our
culture is with the dynamics of rape
and how such dynamics simply are not
humorous to those who have experi
enced the terror, the violation and the
humiliation of rape. Making light of
rape should be seen as grossly inappro

priate at the least.
As Catharine MacKinnon claimed
before Thursday's march, just as ac
tions can be understood as expressed
thoughts, so can expressed thoughts (or
words) be understood as action. In this
case, the action of the Taxi house, as
interpreted through the use of their
words, trivializes and condones rape.
Women are not objects. Sex is not
about conquest. Rape is not a laughing
matter. Especially on the heels of Rape
Awareness Week, I would have ex
pected members of Taxi to have acted
more sensitively in the decoration of
their theme party.
