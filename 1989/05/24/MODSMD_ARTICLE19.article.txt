# Republicans defeat their own cause by mocking Shorts Day
## 
### 
I am writing this letter in regard to
a flier which has been posted all over
campus announcing an "event" called
Stanford College Republicans Apprecia
tion Day.
The flier goes on to say "Show your
support for this oppressed minority.
Ride a bike to class. Show the adminis
tration you care." This flier seems to
have been prompted by this month's
Shorts Day in celebration of GALA
week.
I am hoping that the flier was put
out in ignorance and not to be inten
tionally callous and insensitive to is
sues and problems both this campus
and our country face.
People seem to believe the flier was
posted to "do the same thing GLAS

did, to trick people into supporting a
cause."
If this is the case, then Shorts Day
has been misunderstood. GLAS's pur
pose in having a shorts day is not to
trick anyone into showing support for
a cause they don't believe in.
The purpose is to make people ques
tion something that is completely "nor
mal" for them to do, like putting on a
pair of shorts.
When we wake up in the morning
and leave our rooms, most of us feel
completely comfortable wearing what
we wear and doing what we do
Imagine, however, if everyday you
woke up and something that was in
nately a part of you made you feel
estranged from the society you were
walking into.
We all take for granted the ability to
hold hands with our boyfriends or
girlfriends, to give them a kiss when
we see them, but gays and lesbians do
not have this privilege.
Thus the purpose of Shorts Day was

to make people think about something
they take for granted that other people
cannot do.
By trivializing Shorts Day, the Re
publicans trivialize their own cause. To
be a Republican is to believe some
thing; to be gay is to be something.
I doubt very much that a political
ideology — the ruling political ideology
of a country which lauds democracy
and equality so highly — would want
to alienate a group of people for what
they are, whether they be black, white,
short, tall, heterosexual or homosexual.
Republicans can go most places and
feel comfortable; gays and lesbians
cannot. I truly wonder whether the
administration would really want us to
show them we care about supporting
the College Republicans and the ideas
in this flier.
I hope that this flier, which at
tempted to be humorous, was produced
without much thought and that with
this new knowledge, the College Re
publicans understand and are disturbed
about the insensitivity they demonstra-

ted by distributing this flier.
