# Reports reveal safe levels of backflow from waste incinerator
## 
### Brad Hayward Senior staff writer 
Two University reports released yes
terday reveal that emissions from Stan
ford's waste incinerator blow back into
staff offices at the Environmental Safety
Facility, but at levels within established
safety standards.
The reports include specific recommen
dations that may propel the University
to make structural changes in the facility
— though workers there have been com
plaining about re-entrainment since the
facility opened early last year.
Re-entrain ment is the condition in
which potentially dangerous fumes
emitted from a building filter back into
it or others nearby.
The first of the two reports included
the results of a study conducted on
campus last summer by Fred Shair of

the California Institute of Technology.
Using harmless doses of sulfur hexa
fluoride as a tracer gas, Shair quantified
for the first time the levels of incinerator
emissions re-entrained into staff areas at
the facility, where employees of the De
partment of Health and Safety work.
However, the Shair report did not ad
dress whether that level — two parts per
billion per gram mole released per hour
— is hazardous to those exposed to re
entrained emissions.
Though the report was completed last
October, the University did not want to
release it until both studies were com
pleted, according to Pete Sidebottom, a
Public Affairs official.
The second study, conducted by the
Brown and Caldwell consulting engineer
ing firm of Pleasant Hill, was commis
sioned by the Office of Facilities Project
Management to provide further data on

exposure risk. Using physical facility
reviews and computer modeling, the con
sultants calculated a low risk to workers
exposed to each of 25 chemicals used at
the safety facility.
Brown and Caldwell found that most
emissions fell below quantities estab
lished by the State of California as hazar
dous. One chemical of some concern, how
ever, was hexavalent chromium. Expo
sure to this chemical was equal to the
state's level of "no significant risk," while
other emissions were at least one
thousand times below the state's stand
ard.
The state's standards are based on an
exposure time of 70 years, living 24-
hours-a-day in the same location.
In a press release yesterday, John
Hughes, assistant provost in the Office
of Planning and Management, said the
University intends "to move at once" to

implement some of the report's recom
mendations, including increasing the
stack height of the incinerator and
making some modifications to the build
ing design.
Facilities Engineer Terry Vernon said
the Brown and Caldwell report was "the
most comprehensive analysis that you
can do on an environmental waste facil
ity."
Vernon, who said he was not surprised
by the findings of the reports, said the
studies were commissioned because of
concerns voiced by employees at the fa
cility.
The Brown and Caldwell report in
cludes a list of 23 employee complaints
collected over a five-month period in late
1988 and early 1989. Entries range from
concerns about "odor from incinerator
exhaust" to incinerator emissions "hit
ting air intakes of building A with dense

plumes of smoke."
Gary Schell, a Health and Safety en
gineer who works at the facility, told The
Daily, "I've had times when it's like
walking through a fog to get to the front
door."
Another employee at the facility, Gwen
Cone, said she was fitted for a respirator
because of her concerns about re
entrained emissions.
In addition, a University official
familiar with the facility called it "a to
tally botched mess."
The Shair report created a storm of
protest among Health and Safety staff
when it was completed but not released
last October.
Members of the department alleged
that project manager David Cooper, who
supervised construction of the facility,
was withholding information from
them about re-entrainment at the
facility. Cooper did not release the
Shair report to them and did not
disclose important details of the
report that would reveal whether
Health and Safety workers were
being exposed to significant
health hazards.
Cooper eventually distributed
copies of the report to Health and
Safety staff but resigned from the
project.
Facilities Engineer Dennis
Leung said many of the recom
mendations coincide with the rec
ommendations — then ignored —
of Jon Moldestad, a Health and
Safety engineer who resigned be
cause of alleged intimidation and
mismangement by University of
ficials.

release it until both studies were com
pleted, according to Pete Sidebottom, a
Public Affairs official.
The second study, conducted by the
Brown and Caldwell consulting engineer
ing firm of Pleasant Hill, was commis
sioned by the Office of Facilities Project
Management to provide further data on

exposure risk. Using physical facility
reviews and computer modeling, the con
sultants calculated a low risk to workers
exposed to each of 25 chemicals used at
the safety facility.
Brown and Caldwell found that most
emissions fell below quantities estab
lished by the State of California as hazar
dous. One chemical of some concern, how
ever, was hexavalent chromium. Expo
sure to this chemical was equal to the
state's level of "no significant risk," while
other emissions were at least one
thousand times below the state's stand
ard.
The state's standards are based on an
exposure time of 70 years, living 24-
hours-a-day in the same location.
In a press release yesterday, John
Hughes, assistant provost in the Office
of Planning and Management, said the
University intends "to move at once" to

implement some of the report's recom
mendations, including increasing the
stack height of the incinerator and
making some modifications to the build
ing design.
Facilities Engineer Terry Vernon said
the Brown and Caldwell report was "the
most comprehensive analysis that you
can do on an environmental waste facil
ity."
Vernon, who said he was not surprised
by the findings of the reports, said the
studies were commissioned because of
concerns voiced by employees at the fa
cility.
The Brown and Caldwell report in
cludes a list of 23 employee complaints
collected over a five-month period in late
1988 and early 1989. Entries range from
concerns about "odor from incinerator
exhaust" to incinerator emissions "hit
ting air intakes of building A with dense

plumes of smoke."
Gary Schell, a Health and Safety en
gineer who works at the facility, told The
Daily, "I've had times when it's like
walking through a fog to get to the front
door."
Another employee at the facility, Gwen
Cone, said she was fitted for a respirator
because of her concerns about re
entrained emissions.
In addition, a University official
familiar with the facility called it "a to
tally botched mess."
The Shair report created a storm of
protest among Health and Safety staff
when it was completed but not released
last October.
Members of the department alleged
that project manager David Cooper, who
supervised construction of the facility,
was withholding information from
them about re-entrainment at the
facility. Cooper did not release the
Shair report to them and did not
disclose important details of the
report that would reveal whether
Health and Safety workers were
being exposed to significant
health hazards.
Cooper eventually distributed
copies of the report to Health and
Safety staff but resigned from the
project.
Facilities Engineer Dennis
Leung said many of the recom
mendations coincide with the rec
ommendations — then ignored —
of Jon Moldestad, a Health and
Safety engineer who resigned be
cause of alleged intimidation and
mismangement by University of
ficials.
