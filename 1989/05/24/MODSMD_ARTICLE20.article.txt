# Indian will never make a comeback as Stanford's mascot
## 
### 
The May 11 article reporting the
efforts of a class of 1960 alumnus to
distribute merchandise bearing the old
Stanford Indian logo failed to report
my statement that "There is absolutely
no chance that the 'Indian Symbol'
will return.
"That has repeatedly been made
clear by me and by Presidents Lyman
and Kennedy for almost two decades."
I always make that point when the
matter comes up in a Daily interview
lest anyone get the false impression
the matter could be re-opened.
It cannot.
