. Condoms are usually
Vy • labeled, as electronically
tested. Does this mean they are
tested with robots?
A. The vague, but strangely
• satisfying phrase "elec
tronically tested" guarantees
that a condom has no holes or
tears.
Condoms are not tested by
robots in heat, but rather are
tested with an electric current,
according to Ron Davis of
Safetex Corporation, a manu
facturer of condoms.
Electronic testing is part of
the manufacturing process.
After they are molded, con
doms are placed on stainless
steel rods known as "man
drils." The condoms on the
mandrils are passed through a

tank of hot water containing a
"wetting agent" that allows the
water to pass through holes in
the condoms better.
After they are removed from
the water bath, the condoms
are passed by an electrical con
tact, and a current is sent
through the stainless mandril.
If there is a hole in the con
dom, the water touching the
mandril will conduct the cur
rent to the contact. Since the
condom is an "insulator," and
normally does not conduct elec
tricity, the computer will auto
matically reject a condom if it
detects the current.
According to Davis, this proc
ess is very accurate. The fit
condoms that are not elimi
nated by this selection process
continue on to get lubricated,
packaged and placed on an or
ganic mandril.
Q, Why does my dog,
• Fido, like fire hydrants
ana stop signs so much?
A. Domestic dogs' affinity
• for fire hydrants is an in
stinct left over from their wild
origins, according to Dr.
Brugette, a veterinarian at
Stanford's Division of Labora
tory Animal Medicine.
Wild dogs and cats urinate
on vertical markers in order to
stake out their breeding
grounds. The urine has a dis
tinct odor that warns other
animals to stay away. If Fido
shys away from a fire hydrant,
that means another dog has
beat him to it.
Cats and dogs also have scent
glands on their body. When
they rub up on objects they
mark it as their territory. For
example, when a cat rubs up
against your leg, it is marking
you as its property, not showing
you affection.
