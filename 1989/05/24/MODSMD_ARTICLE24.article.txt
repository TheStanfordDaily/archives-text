# Fears grow in sleepy world of narcolepsy
## 
### Mara Winokur 
"I'll be having a conversation
and I'll start to struggle to
pronounce words," says Marilyn
Wilder, a Los Gatos resident who
is a patient at the Stanford Sleep
Disorders Center. "I'll be watching
myself do this, like my mind
wants to do something but it just
can't."
"After all these years, it still
frightens me," she says.
Wilder has narcolepsy, a
debilitating disease few people
know much about. First observed
in 1880, narcolepsy is a genetic
disorder of REM sleep, the phase
of the sleep cycle in which dreams
take place. The cause of the dis
order is unknown, as are its spe
cific genetic links.
Narcoleptics often encounter ex
cessive daytime sleepiness and a
sudden loss of muscle control
known as cataplexy. Narcoleptics
may also experience a condition
called sleep paralysis, which is an
inability to move similar to that
which occurs during normal REM
sleep.
Some narcoleptics have even re
ported having hypnogogic hal
lucinations, dream-like images
that occur during consciousness.
When Wilder first developed
symptoms of narcolepsy 48 years
ago, it was virtually unheard of.
Consequently, Wilder was not
completely diagnosed until 1977
when she read an article about
the Sleep Center and went for con
sultation.
"There was one doctor I saw in
the early '70s who said it sounded
like I had a condition called nar
colepsy," says Wilder. "He then
told me of a surgeon friend of his
who also had it and didn't even
know it. He told me not to worry
about it. He laughed it off."
Narcolepsy, however, cannot be
laughed off. "I worked for almost

19 years with volatile chemicals.
No one knew I had narcolepsy,
but I lived in terror of dropping
something, or goofing," says
Wilder. "For me, it was the most
painful experience trying to stay
awake. It was beyond endurance."
Narcoleptic attacks of sleepi
ness and cataplexy are unpredict
able and, for the most part,
uncontrollable. No cure has yet
been discovered.
There has, however, been some
progress in treating narcolepsy.
Several anti-depressants and
amphetamines have been found
somewhat successful in reducing
both the occurrences of cataplexy
and the level of sleepiness in nar
coleptic patients, says Dr. Em
manuel Mignot, an assistant
professor of psychiatry at Stan
ford.
Mignot, who has studied nar
colepsy for several years, adds
that though helpful, these medica
tions sometimes have side effects
and are not a cure for the disease.
He and other Stanford faculty
members, such as Biological
Sciences Prof. Craig Heller, are
currently trying to find alterna
tive solutions.
"We are hoping for treatments
to act specifically on narcoleptic
molecules, and not just on the
symptoms of narcolepsy," says
Mignot. To find a treatment, the
researchers have bred a colony of
narcoleptic dogs, the only one in
existence. Researchers observe be
havior and brain wave patterns
in the animals and try to apply
their findings to human beings.
"It is easier to quantify a
cataplectic attack in canines than
it is in humans," explains Mignot.
"In humans subjectivity is a key
factor; each person is different. In
dogs, there is a more standardized
measure."
Until a cure or more effective
treatment is discovered, however,

narcoleptics must find other ways
to cope with their illness. One
such way is to sleep it away.
Wilder takes a nap about every
three hours or after any physical
activity. "Even a 10 minute rest
can recharge me," she says. "If I
don't rest, though, (an attack)
happens abruptly — very abrupt
ly."
Even more helpful to Wilder
than preventive measures or
medication, however, is a support
group at the Sleep Center. Started
five years ago, the group is headed
by Sue Cohen and meets once
every month. Meetings are open
to narcoleptics, their families and
their friends.
"We get together and talk about
what it's like to have narcolepsy,"
Cohen says. "We discuss employ
ment problems, discrimination,
medications, etc."
The group also lets narcoleptics
know they are not alone. Many
narcoleptics are recluses. They are
terrified of showing their

debilitating disease to others be
cause they aren't aware there are
others with the same problem.
"I didn't know any other person
in the whole world felt the way I
did," Wilder says."It was remark
able that after all those years of
suffering I found that others were
suffering too," she says of joining
the group several years ago.
Wilder adds that the support
has made the most change in her
life. "It is because of the group
that I have accepted it after all
these years. And that is the crux
of the whole thing — accepting
yourself."
"It blows me away when I think
of what a difference having sup
port makes, after all those years,"
Wilder said. "I am forever grateful
to the group for what they have
done for me. They are truly in
credible people."

treatment is discovered, however,

narcoleptics must find other ways
to cope with their illness. One
such way is to sleep it away.
Wilder takes a nap about every
three hours or after any physical
activity. "Even a 10 minute rest
can recharge me," she says. "If I
don't rest, though, (an attack)
happens abruptly — very abrupt
ly."
Even more helpful to Wilder
than preventive measures or
medication, however, is a support
group at the Sleep Center. Started
five years ago, the group is headed
by Sue Cohen and meets once
every month. Meetings are open
to narcoleptics, their families and
their friends.
"We get together and talk about
what it's like to have narcolepsy,"
Cohen says. "We discuss employ
ment problems, discrimination,
medications, etc."
The group also lets narcoleptics
know they are not alone. Many
narcoleptics are recluses. They are
terrified of showing their

debilitating disease to others be
cause they aren't aware there are
others with the same problem.
"I didn't know any other person
in the whole world felt the way I
did," Wilder says."It was remark
able that after all those years of
suffering I found that others were
suffering too," she says of joining
the group several years ago.
Wilder adds that the support
has made the most change in her
life. "It is because of the group
that I have accepted it after all
these years. And that is the crux
of the whole thing — accepting
yourself."
"It blows me away when I think
of what a difference having sup
port makes, after all those years,"
Wilder said. "I am forever grateful
to the group for what they have
done for me. They are truly in
credible people."

"I'll be having a conversation
and I'll start to struggle to
pronounce words," says Marilyn
Wilder, a Los Gatos resident who
is a patient at the Stanford Sleep
Disorders Center. "I'll be watching
myself do this, like my mind
wants to do something but it just
can't."
"After all these years, it still
frightens me," she says.
Wilder has narcolepsy, a
debilitating disease few people
know much about. First observed
in 1880, narcolepsy is a genetic
disorder of REM sleep, the phase
of the sleep cycle in which dreams
take place. The cause of the dis
order is unknown, as are its spe
cific genetic links.
Narcoleptics often encounter ex
cessive daytime sleepiness and a
sudden loss of muscle control
known as cataplexy. Narcoleptics
may also experience a condition
called sleep paralysis, which is an
inability to move similar to that
which occurs during normal REM
sleep.
Some narcoleptics have even re
ported having hypnogogic hal
lucinations, dream-like images
that occur during consciousness.
When Wilder first developed
symptoms of narcolepsy 48 years
ago, it was virtually unheard of.
Consequently, Wilder was not
completely diagnosed until 1977
when she read an article about
the Sleep Center and went for con
sultation.
"There was one doctor I saw in
the early '70s who said it sounded
like I had a condition called nar
colepsy," says Wilder. "He then
told me of a surgeon friend of his
who also had it and didn't even
know it. He told me not to worry
about it. He laughed it off."
Narcolepsy, however, cannot be
laughed off. "I worked for almost

19 years with volatile chemicals.
No one knew I had narcolepsy,
but I lived in terror of dropping
something, or goofing," says
Wilder. "For me, it was the most
painful experience trying to stay
awake. It was beyond endurance."
Narcoleptic attacks of sleepi
ness and cataplexy are unpredict
able and, for the most part,
uncontrollable. No cure has yet
been discovered.
There has, however, been some
progress in treating narcolepsy.
Several anti-depressants and
amphetamines have been found
somewhat successful in reducing
both the occurrences of cataplexy
and the level of sleepiness in nar
coleptic patients, says Dr. Em
manuel Mignot, an assistant
professor of psychiatry at Stan
ford.
Mignot, who has studied nar
colepsy for several years, adds
that though helpful, these medica
tions sometimes have side effects
and are not a cure for the disease.
He and other Stanford faculty
members, such as Biological
Sciences Prof. Craig Heller, are
currently trying to find alterna
tive solutions.
"We are hoping for treatments
to act specifically on narcoleptic
molecules, and not just on the
symptoms of narcolepsy," says
Mignot. To find a treatment, the
researchers have bred a colony of
narcoleptic dogs, the only one in
existence. Researchers observe be
havior and brain wave patterns
in the animals and try to apply
their findings to human beings.
"It is easier to quantify a
cataplectic attack in canines than
it is in humans," explains Mignot.
"In humans subjectivity is a key
factor; each person is different. In
dogs, there is a more standardized
measure."
Until a cure or more effective
treatment is discovered, however,

narcoleptics must find other ways
to cope with their illness. One
such way is to sleep it away.
