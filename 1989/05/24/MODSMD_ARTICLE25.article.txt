## O'Brien dominates opponents 
### Cameron Macky Senior staff writer 
ATHENS, Ga. — Alex O'Brien
had a relatively quiet week at the
NCAA Championships. He didn't
do anything spectacular — as
, anyone who has seen him play
knows, O'Brien isn't the world's
flashiest player. All he did was
completely destroy each and every
one of his opponents.
' "Alex has done a great job at
No. 4 all year," Stanford Coach
g Dick Gould said after the title
•{, match, which the Cardinal won
I 5-3. True enough, but "great"
doesn't adequately describe
O'Brien's performance over the
last four days.
O'Brien's first opponent of the
championship tournament was
Miami's Tommy Phanco. Playing
on the stadium courts, O'Brien
' fired the first serve of the match
right through the Hurricane, won
the first game four-zip, and was
»;up four games to one when
Phanco defaulted.
The next day, O'Brien faced
. Louisiana State's Tom Furuk
*rantz on the back courts.
».Furukrantz won the first point
celebrated with a fist pump.
£ O'Brien responded with a curt
r'look, and then took the Tiger to
\ school, 6-2, 6-1.

South Carolina's Dave Herman
provided O'Brien with his only
test of the week. Sort of. Herman
broke O'Brien's serve in the
match's first game and was up
5-3 in the first set.
How did O'Brien respond?
Simple: He wiped Herman off the
court, 7-5, 6-0. Finally, yesterday
against Georgia senior T.J. Mid
dleton, the Cardinal freshman
wrapped up his phenomenal run
with a 6-0, 6-1 romp.
The common denominator in
each of the four wins was
O'Brien's nearly unbreakable
serve. Herman's break on Monday
was the only time in the four
matches that O'Brien failed to
hold serve.
Not bad for a guy who had
struggled with his serve in the
middle of the season, as a result
of a shoulder ir\jury.
"It (the resurgent serve)
definitely helped," O'Brien said.
"I was mixing up my serve pretty
well, and that helped me a lot.
[The shoulder] is a little sore right
now, but I'll be fine.
"I think the key (this week)
was that I concentrated really
hard every match," O'Brien said.
If he keeps concentrating, O'Brien
just might have a heck of a career
in front of him.
