# After shaky year, doubles teams come through for champions

### Cameron Macky Senior staff writer 
ATHENS, Ga. — "The major issue
[Stanfordl will have to face this year,
however, is not the singles lineup but the
doubles tandems."
— The Stanford Daily,
Feb. 7, 1939
"And thus the 'new' Cardinal, like the
old Cardinal, still isn't exactly sure how
its doubles lineup will stack up when the
NCAA Tournament rolls around."
— The Daily, April 14, 1989
Needless to say, Stanford's doubles

teams went undefeated at the NCAA
Tournament this week. The Cardinal
came up with two dou£>lep wins to beat
Louisiana State in the quarterfinals, one
to down South Carolina in the semis,
and two more to defeat Georgia in the
finals.
"I'm very proud of our doubles teams,"
Gould said after Jeff Cathrall and Martin
Blackman's 6-4, 6-4 win at No. 2 doubles
gave the NCAA title to the Cardinal for
the second year in a row.
It was the pair's third straight win of
the tourney, which isn't bad for a team
that was almost broken up last week.
"We had discussed breaking up Cath

rail and Blackman because they hadn't
been playing well," Gould said. Other
possible shifts were pondered as well.
However, several team members didn't
think that would be a wise move.
"Coach asked what I thought, and I
told him 'I definitely think it would hurt
to split up now,' " co-captain Barry Ric
hards said. "We had confidence in each
other."
"We had some thoughts (about chang
ing the lineup), but just decided to stick
with it," Stanford Asst. Coach John Whit
linger said. Good idea. In fact, the deci
sion to stick with the status quo was
almost as astute as, say, the pairing of

Alex O'Brien and Jeff Tarango at No. 1
doubles.
"I honestly have to thank chicken pox
for our doubles success (this season),"
Whitlinger said. Blackman had played
with Tarango for the first half of the
season, but when Blackman came down
with chicken pox, O'Brien was paired with
Tarango "for lack of anything else to
do," Gould said. "Now that's good coach
ing."
It certainly is: Tarango and O'Brien
destroyed Jim Childs and T.J. Middleton
6-2, 6-2 yesterday, and still have yet to
lose a match.
The Cardinal's doubles teams had one

advantage over the Bulldogs going into
yesterday's match: Georgia had wrapped
up all three of its tourney wins in singles,
which meant their doubles teams hadn't
gotten much practice.
"I think it definitely helped us to get
the doubles in yesterday and the day
before," Gould said. "Our teams haven't
been together that long, and frankly, we
haven't been sterling. We needed the prac
tice."
"I'm not really surprised we did so
well," Whitlinger said. "Our doubles
(play) wasn't bad this season. It wasn't
great, but it's gotten better and better."
And then some.
