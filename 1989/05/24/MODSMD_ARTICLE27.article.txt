# Three titles isn't enough? How about six next year?
## 
### 
With the men's tennis team's vic
tory in Athens, Ga. yesterday,
Stanford University can claim to
have captured 14 national championships
over the past four years.
While that number is rather impressive
— especially for a school with top-tier
academic standards and an undergradu
ate population of under 6,500 — it is
not a record.
After unscientifically researching the
subject, the Rogo Sports Trivia Desk has
determined that UCLA holds the marks
for total championships won over a
three-, four- and five-year period with
14, 17 and 19 respectively (all the records
coming between 1969 and 1973.)
With that, I lay down the following
challenge to the gifted men and women
who wear the Cardinal and White: Win
six national titles next year and the five
year record will be yours.
Looking up and down the list of varsity
squads, one finds at least 10 with a shot
at grabbing that piece of wood with the
bronze NCAA logo in the coming season.
In no particular order (and with apologies
to anyone left out or anyone who may

feel overhyped), they are the following:
basketball (women), water polo, gymnas
tics (men), tennis (both), baseball, swim
ming (both) and volleyball (both).
In my final days at the NCAA Women's
Championships, people kept asking,
"What about next year?"
That is to say, after going 29-0 and
romping through the NCAA field to cap
ture their fourth-straight NCAA title,
what can the Cardinal women do for an
encore in 1990? And, come on, can they
really be as good?
The answer to the first question is
simple: Duplicate the wondrous feats of

the best collegiate tennis team ever and
you will be considered alongside them in
the history books.
Does that mean yet another undefeated
season? Afraid so. Impossible? No. Diffi
cult 0 Yes, but . . .
What a nice segue into the answer to
question two. The 1990 team loses Eleni
Rossides and Cindy Buchsbaum to grad
uation — and No. 1 player Tami Whit
linger to the pro ranks in all likelihood.
Rossides and Buchsbaum are two of
the classiest acts you'll come across and
will be sorely missed — but not for their
exploits on the court. Remember, neither
was a starter for this year's team.
The loss of Whitlinger might be a
devastating blow to your average,
everyday national championship squad.
Of course, there's nothing average about
the Cardinal. Consider the possibilities
for No. 1 next year:
• Sandra Birch: The NCAA singles
championship has front-runner status at
the moment. Birch has a great competi
tive spirit, a solid all-around game and
a strong desire to play No. 1.
• Lisa Green: The three-time NCAA

If Coach Frank Bren
nan drew the names
out of a hat for the top
five spots, put Kylie
Johnson in at No. 6,
and smiled, the team
might go undefeated.

singles semifinalist served notice that her
serve is much improved. If the volley
comes along as far, Green — who'll be
the team's lone senior — will make a
strong hid for the top spot.
• Debbie Graham: Undefeated in dual
matches as a freshman. Florida's Siobhan
Nicholson compared her serve to a "thun
derbolt." Her forehand's just as hard
NufT said.
• Teri Whitlinger: Tami's multitalented
sister added a number of shots to her

repetoire in the second half of the season.
The team's best athlete would make a
worthy successor at the top of the lineup.
• Meredith McGrath: One of the best
high schoolers ever to decide to play col
lege tennis. Her serve-and-volley game is
polished well beyond her years. A fresh
man at No. 1? See Fendick, Patty (who
is the best Stanford athlete ever with a
last name beginning with F).
Now, consider that four of these women
will fill spots two through five. If Coach
Frank Brennan drew the names out of
a hat for the top five spots, put Kylie
Johnson in at No. 6, and smiled, the
team might go undefeated.
In case they do, here's an added chal
lenge: This year's team was forced into
doubles four times in 29 matches, the
'90 team could go for "no doubs" all
season long.
And what of Brennan? Isn't he getting
a little bored 0 "John Wooden didn't get
tired," remarked the coach last Sundav.
