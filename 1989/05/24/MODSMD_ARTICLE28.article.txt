# Women golfers host NCAA tournament
## 
### David Hirning Staff writer 
If you are a golf fan, then you
know already. If you are not, and
you don't, now would be a good
time to consider becoming one.
Because, as far as college golf goes,
it doesn't get any bigger or more
exciting than this.
There will be 102 women golfers
out on the Stanford Golf Course
today as the 17 best teams in the
nation begin a four-day quest for
the NCAA Championship. Stan
ford will host this, the biggest
women's tournament outside the
Ladies' Professional Golf Associ
ation, for the second time in the
event's eight year history. The in
augural event was here in 1982.
But Stanford Coach Tim
Baldwin must do more than drive
the welcome wagon and practice
his etiquette this week. His Car
dinal squad is considered a potent
dark horse and he will try to keep
the team trophy from leaving its
current home in Palo Alto.
"We're going to have to be lucky
to win, based on the strength of
the teams," Baldwin said. "But
we just have to play our own
games."
Stanford, seeded 11th, will tee
it off tomorrow at 9:28 a.m. But,
based on the pre-season rankings,
Stanford was supposed to be in
the gallery at this one. Three
freshmen, led by No. 1 player
Adele Moore, have spurred the
Cardinal into contention this
season.
"We were preseason ranked

'This is what we've been waiting for. It's
a once in a lifetime thing — the NCAAs,
at Stanford, at home. We have to put all
our effort in and just go for it.'

19th by all these coaches,"
Baldwin said. "But we didn't play
in an easy tournament all year or
on an easy golf course. It will be
interesting to see how we stack
up against all these top teams."
Those top teams include defend
ing national champ Tulsa, which
may feel more comfortable than
most on the Stanford course at
this tournament. The Golden Hur
ricane won their first NCAA title
at Stanford in '82 and is trying
to become the only team ever to
win three titles. Florida will join
them in the attempt.
Tulsa's foremost competition
will come from top-ranked Ari
zona State, Texas and Oklahoma
State. Individually, the heavily an
ticipated showdown between Pearl
Sinn of ASU and Texas' Michiko
Hattori promises to be interest
ing.
To keep up with the big guns,
Stanford will have to maintain
consistency all the way down the
line. In college golf, as in tennis,
often it is your last two players
rather than your first two that
provide the winning margin.
Stanford is a young team, with

sophomore Jodi Figley the only
member with NCAA experience
(as an individual last year). As if
the pressure of their first NCAAs
— which just happens to be in
front of their friends and home
crowd — weren't enough, add the
fact that Stanford is one of the
few schools still in session.
"I'm kind of bummed we're still
in school," Figley said. "To be
honest, this is a time to put school
aside and concentrate on golf."
But if the five women can forget
everything extraneous and play
their home course like only they
know how, who knows what may
happen? The home course advan
tage is undeniably there. As Figley
observed, hosting the NCAAs is
something to take advantage of.
"This is what we've been
waiting for. It's a once in a
lifetime thing — the NCAAs, at

Stanford, at home. We have to
put all our effort in and just go
for it."
For the freshmen, it simply caps
a roller-coaster-ride of a season
in which all three started and
played above just about every
one's expectations. Not surpris
ingly, they are decidedly optimis
tic about their team's chances.
"I think we're going to win it,"
Moore said, who has seen a lot of
winning in her junior days. "We
seriously think we can. We are
probably one of the best ball
striking teams in the country and
we have five players who can play
No. 1 at any time. Not too many
teams can say that."
Audrey Wooding, the Stanford
freshman who has a sister that
will compete individually in the
tournament, is similarly unawed
by the event. "They try to put so
much mystique around the
NCAAs, which bothers me. If you
just treat it like another tourna
ment, you play well. If you start
to disrupt your routine, you put
too much pressure on yourself and
it doesn't go."
If the freshmen are. to be
believed, then the Cardinal just
might win the whole thing. Only
four days and 72 holes of golf will
tell.
