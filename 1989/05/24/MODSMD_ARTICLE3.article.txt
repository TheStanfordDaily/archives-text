# Divergent views of the occupation
## Senators-elect consider COP role 
### Martha Brockenbrough Staff writer 
The Council of Presidents' involve
ment in the May 15th student protest
has generally divided the incoming
members of the ASSU Senate along
party lines even before they have taken
office.
A number of senators-elect endorsed
by the People's Platform agreed with
the COP's decision to support the
Agenda for Action's occupation of Uni
versity President Donald Kennedy's of
fice last Monday.
But many of next year's senators en
dorsed by the opposition platform, Stu
dents First, said the move violated the
COP's campaign promises. And amidst
the fallout, a new student group has

used the event to call for reform within
the ASSU.
The controversy revolves around
three counts of COP involvement:
• Nearly $2,000 from the COP expense
account was lent to the protest;
• A University-owned van — used for
the ASSU airport shuttle service, safe
transportation from parties and for Bar
rio Assistance — was used to block the
bus holding arrested students; and
• COP members and members-elect
were arrested for occupying the Presi
dent's Office.
Senators-elect endorsed by the
People's Platform argued that their
platform's victory in this spring's COP
election entitled the council to pursue
its expressed political goals in any way
it deemed necessary.

Senator-elect Noel Bravo, a freshman,
said the arrests of the current COP
members David Brown and Stacey
Leyton, as well as COP member-elect
Ingrid Nava, reflected "their commit
ment to making tangible gains" towards
multicultural education.
Bravo said the COP was elected be
cause the majority of Stanford students
agreed with their strong political stance.
Also, the funding from the ASSU "was
done within the process" determined by
ASSU Bylaws, he added.
Senators supported by Students First
generally condemned the role taken by
COP members in the protest.
"ASSU funds should not be used for
criminal activities," said freshman John
Abbot, a senator-elect. Freshman
Kevin Warsh, also a senator-elect,
said, "They are alienating some
of their constituents." The voters
"thought the COP would be
dealing with the issues through
(the Committee on Democracy in
Education)," Warsh said. "They
didn't want their COP to be ar
rested."
Members of the Association for
Student Government Reform, a
student group founded after this
spring's election, said they also
want to address what they per
ceive as the COP overstepping its
bounds.
Senior Leonard Adler, former
COP member and acting adviser
to the fledgling, five-member
group, called the loans "an im
proper use of COP accounts."

Adler's group is also advocating
the prosecution of the protesters
for violating the Fundamental
Standard. Member Scott Christof
ferson, a freshman, said, "The
Fundamental Standard is the
closest thing to law we have on
this campus."
He added, there "could not have
been a more blatant violation" of
the Standard than the occupation.
Adler said he thinks a petition
for a recall election of the new
COP may circulate sometime
soon. But about 1,800 signatures
would be required in order to hold
a recall vote, he said.
Although it would take a two
thirds majority vote to oust the
Slate of the Times from office,
junior Frank Quaratiello — who
ran on the Students' Choice plat
form — said a petition alone
would be a message to the COP
that "students don't want them
to be involved in activist politics."
