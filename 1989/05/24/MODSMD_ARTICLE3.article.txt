# Divergent views of the occupation
## Senators-elect consider COP role 
### Martha Brockenbrough Staff writer 
The Council of Presidents' involve
ment in the May 15th student protest
has generally divided the incoming
members of the ASSU Senate along
party lines even before they have taken
office.
A number of senators-elect endorsed
by the People's Platform agreed with
the COP's decision to support the
Agenda for Action's occupation of Uni
versity President Donald Kennedy's of
fice last Monday.
But many of next year's senators en
dorsed by the opposition platform, Stu

COP's campaign promises. And amidst
the fallout, a new student group has

used the event to call for reform within
the ASSU.

three counts of COP involvement:
• Nearly $2,000 from the COP expense
account was lent to the protest;
• A University-owned van — used for

bus holding arrested students; and
• COP members and members-elect
were arrested for occupying the Presi

Senators-elect endorsed by the
People's Platform argued that their
platform's victory in this spring's COP
election entitled the council to pursue
its expressed political goals in any way
it deemed necessary.

Senator-elect Noel Bravo, a freshman,
said the arrests of the current COP
members David Brown and Stacey
Leyton, as well as COP member-elect
Ingrid Nava, reflected "their commit
ment to making tangible gains" towards
multicultural education.
Bravo said the COP was elected be
cause the majority of Stanford students
agreed with their strong political stance.
Also, the funding from the ASSU "was
done within the process" determined by
ASSU Bylaws, he added.
Senators supported by Students First
generally condemned the role taken by
COP members in the protest.
"ASSU funds should not be used for
criminal activities," said freshman John
