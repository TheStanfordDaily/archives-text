BANG!
That's what the Stanford cycling team
finished up its season with last weekend at
National Championships in Colorado
Springs, Co. Despite intense competition and
the high altitude, the Cardinal finished third
in the nation, an improvement over its
seventh-place finish last year.
Although this year's championships was
only the second true national championships
ever held, the competition was fierce. The
four California schools represented at na
tionals placed in the top seven out of 25
teams, confirming the toughness of Stan
ford's league, the western division of the
United States Collegiate Cycling Association.
In fact, although Colorado took first place
overall, Stanford's archrival and perennial
competitor California bested Stanford by
winning second place.
The championships consisted of three
races: a road race on Saturday and a team
time trial and criterium on Sunday. The
road race event was held on "a tough course
with a lot of hills," according to co-captain

Vit Henisz. And the event was made even
more difficult by the altitude, even though
the Stanford team arrived in Colorado
Springs the preceding Tuesday so that the
cyclists could become acclimated.
The women's team consisted of Tasha
Brubaker, Shannon Price and Liz Moyer.
Tom Moyer (Liz's brother), Steve Miller,
Art Walker, Ken Zimmerman and Coulter
Richardson made up the men's team.
In the men's 77-mile road race, co-captain
Miller placed 15th and teammate Walker
took 18th out of a starting field with more
than 100 riders. "Most of the field was
dropped pretty early," Zimmerman said. The
remaining pack ended up sprinting for
fourth place on.
Stanford rider Brubaker took 15th place
in the women's 45-mile race. Liz Moyer
labeled the race "hard" and said that the
field of women shattered right away into
one small lead pack and many more chasers.
In the team time trial the next day the
Stanford team garnered more spectacular
placings. The men's team hammered to third
place behind Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo and
Texas Tech on the 15-mile, rolling course.
Because of a severe crosswind the Stanford
team "had to echelon at a really strong

angle," Zimmerman said. The wind condi
tions favored teams like the Cardinal that
worked well together.
The women's team rolled its way to fourth
place after Colorado, California and Cal
Poly-SLO. "Tasha really pulled that one in,"
Liz Moyer said. "It was her race."
The criterium that afternoon raised the
Cardinal from sixth to third in the overall
standings. "We had a strong placing in the
criterium," Liz Moyer said. Although two
Stanford riders crashed, the Cardinal still
managed to place all but one of its riders.
In the men's field the hero of the Stanford
team was Miller, who wiped out at the be
ginning of the race and then jumped back
in. Although he had a concussion, Miller
still placed 27th, just inside the cutoff for
receiving points. "He gets some hard man
points" for that, Henisz said. Stanford cyclist
Tom Moyer, the leading scorer in Stanford's
league during the regular season, finished
well as usual. Moyer sprinted to fifth place,
followed by teammates Richardson, Walker
and Zimmerman in 15th, 16th and 21st
places.
"It was a good finish" to the season, Liz
Moyer said. Henisz concurred, saying "Over
all we had a great year."
