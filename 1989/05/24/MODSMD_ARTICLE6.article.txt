# French House dryer fire serves up towels flamb√©

About 20 students evacuated the La
Maison Francaise yesterday when a mal
functioning dryer on the second floor
caught fire.
Six fire units and 18 fireman responded
within five minutes to the house's auto
matic alarm system, which sounded at 11
a.m., to extinguish the three-foot flames.
No injuries were reported.
Captain Bruce Hallberg, from Palo Alto
Fire Station Number 6 on Serra Street,
said they arrived just before the house's
sprinklers activated. "If the sprinklers go
off, 100 to 300 gallons of water would be
dumped on the house," causing serious
water damage, he said.
But he praised the effectiveness of the
sprinkler system because "It's like having
a fireman glued to the ceiling every 10
feet."
Resident Assistant Alex Perez was con
cerned about the damage such flooding
would have caused because "there's a Mac
intosh in every room."

Hallberg said the firefighters had to use
a pressurized water extinguisher on the
dryer when a dry powder extinguisher
failed to quench the electrical fire.
Only the laundry room was damaged,
Perez said. "It looks like the dryer threw
up," he noted. The flame blackened the
dryer, and ashes from the towels in the
dryer were littered over the floor. Damages
to the laundry room totaled less than $500,
according to Hallberg. "It looks like the
dryer malfunctioned."
Row House Facilities Manager Lucy Wil
liams said that Web Services Company,
which owns all dormitory washers and
dryers, will be billed for the damage.
At 11:50 a.m., just after Hallberg
finished praising Perez for the speed of
the evacuation, sophomore Robert Armas
came out of his room in a towel, having
slept through the entire event.
"So much for the perfect record," Hal
lberg said.
Sophomore Cliff Goldmacher, who loaded
the dryer at 9 a.m. with wet kitchen towels,
said, "I feel no guilt."
