## Activists demand Premier's ouster 
### 
BEIJING (AP) â€” One mil
lion people in Beijing and tens
of thousands in other cities
marched yesterday to demand
that Premier Li Peng resign,
and there were signs he might
be losing a power struggle with
liberals in the leadership.
Foreign Minister Qian Qic
hen, in the first official reve
lation of the backstage contest
since Li declared martial law
Saturday in parts of the capital,
said Communist Pa r ty chief
Zhao Ziyang remained in office.
Zhao, a comparative liberal,
favored meeting with univer
sity students who occupied
Tiananmen Square on May 13
demanding talks on democratic
reforms. He was said to have
offered his resignation just
before Li ordered soldiers into
the city.
Wan Li, head of the Chinese
People's Congress, cut a U.S.
visit short yesterday after
meeting with President Bush
and American officials said
they expected him to press for
Li's ouster. The Congress is the
national legislature.
Qian's comment to European
Community ambassadors, re
ported by diplomatic sources,
was the first official word on
Zhao's status.
In other indications Li may
be losing his power struggle
with Zhao's faction, a military
officer was quoted as saying
troops ordered into Beijing

Li's failure to en
force martial law
seemed to indicate
he lacked adequate
support within the
government and
party.

have been told to withdraw. He
did not say how far.
The official Xinhua News
Agency also reported public de
mands for Li's ouster for the
first time in its report on yes
terday's march in Beijing. "The
overwhelming majority of the
slogans of the parade were di
rected against the chief leader
of the State Council," Xinhua
said, referring to Li but not by
name. The State Council is
China's cabinet.
Hong Kong commercial radio
reported the party Politburo
decided to strip Li of both his
government and party posts
and that Zhao would resume
his duties.
However, Li's failure to en
force martial law four days
after declaring it in a harsh
speech broadcast nationwide
seemed to indicate he lacked
adequate support within the
government and party.
