#6-Teamwork
You may have noticed the signs posted in Whole Foods Market referring
to "team members" rather than "employees." That's because we believe
in a team-oriented approach to our business, one that directly involves our
people in the management of the store and promotes a strong commitment
to customer service.
At Whole Poods Market, decision making is decentralized among team leaders
responsible for each area within the market. Each month, we have mandatory
team meetings to share ideas and discuss suggestions for improvement.
And our unique form of profit-sharing, called gain-sharing, bases bonuses
on activities that team members have actual control over, like productivity and
reducing waste, rather than overall profits.
We also share financial information about the store with every team member.
So, all salaries are published, from the newest hire to the CEO. You see, we
believe that for our team to win, everyone must know the score.
