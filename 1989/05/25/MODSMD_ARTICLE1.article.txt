The establishment of an inter
departmental search committee
for an Asian-American studies
professor was announced during
yesterday's Agenda for Action
meeting with University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy.
Incoming Asian-American Stu
dent Association chair Richard
Suh said yesterday's announce
ment was the first time AASA
members had heard of a plan to
set up such a committee because
all earlier meetings with the ad
ministration had produced no
firm result.
"AASA members view (the an
nouncement) as a victory
for the Asian-American commu
nity" at Stanford, Suh said.
Humanities and Sciences Dean
Ewart Thomas, who will establish
the committee, said appointing an
Asian-American studies professor
has aJways been one of his objec
tives, but he had not intended to
pursue it this academic year. How
ever, when the suggestion was
raised for an interdepartmental
committee in a History Depart
ment meeting last Sunday, "it
made a lot of sense to have such
a committee," Thomas said.
Suh said the Agenda for Action
protest called attention to AASA's
request for an Asian-American
studies professor, but AASA mem
bers have worked toward this goal
for 18 years.
AASA members were naturally
"very pleased", but "there's still
a lot to be done," he said.
AASA member Quynh Tran
said the next step for members
is to push professors to join the
search committee.
Thomas said the search com
mittee should be established
before fall quarter, with the in
tention to appoint a candidate in
the fall of 1990.
The search committee will have
three objectives to consider
while searching for a faculty can
didate:
• Stanford's needs in Asian-
American studies;
• The availability of outstand
ing scholars in particular disci
plines; and,

• The departments' interest in
appointing such scholars.
Thomas said the reason for
having an interdepartmental
search committee is that, "people
doing good work could be many
kinds of scholars" and members
of many different departments,
"might be in a better position to
judge the quality of academic
work."
Provost James Rosse added that

having an interdepartmental com
mittee, "will give us a better shot
at getting someone good."
According to Thomas' written
statement, committee member
ship may be offered to faculty in
the departments of anthropology,
English, history, political science
and sociology because "these are
the departments that our prelim
inary assessment indicates are the
most likely academic homes for
such an appointment."
AASA's efforts this year have
been directed towards obtaining
a faculty appointment in the His
tory Department. Suh said AASA
would like to see a history pro
fessor appointed because "(his
tory) is a fundamental basis on
which you start any interdiscipli
nary program."
He added however, "we can live
with (a non-history professor
being appointed). It's more impor
tant for us to have the position
created."
Suh said Stanford's Asian-
American community is assuming
the announcement means there
are specific funds allocated for an
Asian-American faculty appoint
ment.
