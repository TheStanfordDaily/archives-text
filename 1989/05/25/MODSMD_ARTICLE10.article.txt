An article last Wednesday failed
to mention that the Filipino-
American Community at Stanford
responded jointly with the Asian
Staff Forum to the UCMI report.
Also, an article yesterday incor
rectly reported that the Associa
tion for Student Government
Reform was Leonard Adler's
group. Furthermore, the group
did not advocate that the Univer
sity take action against the ASSU
and Council of Presidents.
In the same article, Scott Chris
tofferson refered to the policy on
campus disruption, not the Fun
damental Standard when he said,
there "could not have been a more
blatant violation."
