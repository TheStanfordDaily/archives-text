# Marklein wins runoff election
## 
### 
Timothy J. Marklein was
elected editor in chief for Volume
196 of The Stanford Daily last
night.
Marklein, a sophomore major
ing in political science, has worked
at The Daily for two years and is
a basic News Department god.
Last year, as a senior staff
writer, Marklein, just an innocent
frosh, covered the tricky ASSU
beat. Because of the problems that
surfaced during the ASSU elec
tions last year, Marklein had to
do his homework and now he can
comfortably say that he is the
only person on campus who knows
what the ASSU Bylaws actually
say
For Volume 194, the jovial
Marklein worked as a news pro
duction editor and his hard work
helped The Daily achieve
amazingly early times off the
table. This volume Marklein has

worked as a news assignment
editor, bomb-scare reporter, Edi
torial Board member, proof
reader, Features Department ad-

viser and all
around nice
guy.
Marklein is a
Wisconsin na
tive and he
responds to a
variety of nick
names, includ
ing "the big fat
bear."
"Timmer" is
obsessively neat
and he likes to
make lists and
lists and lists.
Politically,
Marklein is a
calculated
thinker who
does not vote

the party line. Unlike several past
Daily editors, Marklein leans a
little bit to the right.


Cheesehead Marklein
