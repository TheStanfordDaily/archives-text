## Wright likely to resign Struggle for successor begins among Democrats 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - House
Speaker Jim Wright, his political
career of 35 years in shambles,
bargained through lawyers yester
day to resign his leadership post
in exchange for the dismissal of
ethics charges, according to
congressional sources close to the
negotiations.
Wright denied that he was con
sidering stepping down and issued
a statement saying he would
"press ahead" with his case.
But his representatives shuttled
through a daylong series of meet
ings with key members of Con
gress in what sources described
as a bid to nail down an agreement
stripping Wright of his post as
leader of the House and second
in line of succession to the
presidency. The extraordinary
drama overwhelmed normal busi
ness at the Capitol, even though
it was played out almost exclu
sively behind closed doors, and
lawmakers could talk of little else.
Wright's resignation could set
off a struggle for succession
within the ranks of House Dem
ocrats, and already the jockeying
appeared to be under way.
Mfyority Leader Thomas Foley
of Washington seemed to be first

in line, but Hep. Richard Gephardt
of Missouri was careful not to
dampen speculation that he was
prepared to make a fight for a
leadership position.
"I don't want to answer hypo
thetical questions," he said when
asked if he was interested in
Wright's job.
Wright spent his day in a series
of meetings with his supporters
and his leadership team.
The speaker also issued a terse
statement saying: "I very firmly
believe that my position is right.
I hope and trust that the com
mittee will consider the matter
on its merits and dismiss the
charges.
"I eagerly await the time and
opportunity when my side of this
whole question may be heard
clearly by my colleagues and the
American people. To this end, I
shall press ahead."
Rep. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J.,
a member of Wright's defense
team, met with ethics committee
counsel Richard Phelan and made
the initial offer, the sources said.
The proposal ran into opposition
from ethics committee Republi
cans and still was being
negotiated, said the sources, who

commented only on condition they
not be named.
The ethics committee — made
up of six Democrats and six Re
publicans — met for much of the
day in private, deliberating
Wright's motion to dismiss the
two most serious allegations. The
chairman, Rep. Julian Dixon, D-
Calif., promised a "fresh look,"
but there was no indication any
of the committee members had
been persuaded.
Other signs were ominous for
Wright, as fellow Texas Demo
crats began to talk openly of
growing odds against his keeping
his post.
The most serious allegations
facing Wright are that he used
bulk sales of an autobiographical
book to evade rules limiting out
side income and that he im
properly took gifts from a
developer friend who had a direct
interest in legislation.
Earlier yesterday, entering a
luncheon with Texas Democrats,
Wright was asked about wide
spread speculation that he was
considering stepping aside as
speaker until the ethics case is
resolved.
"No, I'm not," he answered.
