NEW YORK (AP) — Navy inves
tigators have found evidence to support
the possibility that murder or suicide was
involved in the explosion that killed 47
sailors aboard the battleship USS lowa,
NBC News reported yesterday.
NBC quoted unidentified Navy sources
as disclosing "some disturbing facts"
about a surviving sailor who stands to
collect $100,000 from the insurance policy
of a gunner's mate killed in the explosion
April 17.
Investigators found gunpower and

blasting caps in a search of the belongings
of Gunner's Mate 3rd Class Kendall
Truitt, 21, NBC said. They also found
at his home one of the burlap patches
that gunners insert between bags of pow
der to clean the barrels of the battleship's
huge guns during firing, the network
said.
Truitt was quoted in published reports
last week as saying the Navy created
homicide or suicide scenarios involving
him and Clayton Hartwig, 25, to make
them scapegoats for an explosion inves

tigators cannot otherwise explain.
Truitt has denied any blame for the
explosion, and has said that in response
to investigators' questions, he denied a
homosexual relationship with Hartwig.
NBC said that because the Navy has
failed to find an accidental cause for the
explosion, it believes it may have been
caused deliberately through placement of
a detonating device in one of the burlap
patches, which normally would have been
handled by Hartwig.
Hartwig's family told NBC that he was

depressed when his friendship with Truitt
broke down last year. The family also
said that at age 17, Hartwig threatened
suicide when another relationship ended,
NBC said.
NBC said other sources, which it did
not identify, have learned that before the
lowa went on maneuvers off Puerto Rico,
Hartwig wrote several letters that could
be construed as farewell messages.
Earlier yesterday, Hartwig's sister,
Kathleen Kubicina, told The Associated
Press in Cleveland that she is contesting

the fairness of Truitt collecting $100,000
from her brother's insurance policy.
A Naval Investigative Service agent told
Kubicina that Hartwig's insurance policy,
which listed Truitt as its beneficiary,
would not be paid until the Navy com
pletes its investigation of the explosion.
Earl Hartwig said his son and Truitt
took out $50,000 policies from the Navy
credit union just before their battleship
left Norfolk for the Persian Gulf in 1987.
The policies carried double indemnities
for accidental death.
