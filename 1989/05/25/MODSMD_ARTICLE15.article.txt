BEIJING (AP) — The top army
command published a letter yes
terday strongly supporting con
servative Premier Li Peng, who
is locked in a bitter battle for
power with rival factions opposing
his crackdown on student protest
ers.
Foreign Minister Qian Qichen
told diplomats a meeting of the
ruling Communist Party's policy
making Politburo would be called
today or tomorrow, perhaps sig
naling the behind-the-scenes
power struggle between Li and
Communist Party chief Zhao
Ziyang was coming to a head.
Wan Li, head of China's parlia
ment, cut short a visit to the
United States and flew home yes
terday for what he said were

"health reasons." But U.S. offi
cials thought he was hurrying
back to demand Li's ouster.
Li declared martial law in
Beijing on Saturday to restore or
der to the city where more than
1 million residents have demon
strated in support of the students.
The crackdown, apparently
made with the approval of senior
leader Deng Xiaoping, triggered
widespread calls for Li's ouster.
Troops deployed on the out
skirts of Beijing since Friday were
prevented from moving on the
square by throngs of people who
surrounded the convoys and built
street barricades. The crowds
pleaded with the soldiers not to
attack and they retreated into bar
racks, leading to speculation that

Li could not control the military.
However, the army Headquar
ters of General Staff and General
Political Department published a
letter yesterday in the military
newspaper strongly supporting
Li's hard-line position against the
students.
The letter was dated Monday,
the same day more than 100
senior army officers called for an
end to martial law, and it indi
cated an apparent split in the mil
itary.
"In this serious political
struggle that affects the future
fate of the nation, the troops will
face every kind of difficulty and
test in their task of ending the
disturbance and restoring normal
order," the letter said.
