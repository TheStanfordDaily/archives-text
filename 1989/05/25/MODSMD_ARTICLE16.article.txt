Deukmejian signs gun ban hills
SACRAMENTO (AP) — California enacted the
nation's first statewide restrictions on the pos
session or sale of assault weapons yesterday when
Gov. George Deukmejian signed two bills sparked
by a schoolyard massacre.
The bills ban the sale of 55 semiautomatic
assault rifles, pistols and shotguns beginning Jan.
1. But they allow people who currently own those
weapons lawfully to keep them if they register
with the state.
The legislation was prompted by a Jan. 17
attack at a Stockton elementary school in which
a deranged man with an AK-47 assault rifle killed
five children and wounded 30 other people before
taking his own life.
The attack prompted similar bills in several

states, including Rhode Island, Louisiana, Mich
igan and Colorado, but California's are the first
to be passed and signed into law.

WASHINGTON (AP) — In a further signal of

leading South Africans both in and out of gov
ernment.
A senior U.S. official, asking not to be identi
fied, said the mood between the two countries
has improved.
