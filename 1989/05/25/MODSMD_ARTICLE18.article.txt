## Give me Liberties 
### 
Lack of funds is not
reason enough to cancel
needed and lauded class

Enrollment has nearly
quadrupled in its four
years here. The course
hones in on specifics, paying close
attention to the rights of women
and minorities. The lecturer is
energetic, committed, and his
first love is teaching.
But Jim Steyer's perennially
popular lecture class, Civil Rights
and Civil Liberties, got canned
anyway.
The Political Science Depart
ment has opted to replace
Steyer's course that takes a close
look at American law and politics
and how both impact our notions
of freedom, equality and privacy
with a class that more closely
examines constitutional law.
Due to a cost crunch, the Po
litical Science Department says it
cannot afford to offer both large
lecture courses. While money is
an understandable consideration,
scrapping such a popular course
sends out a scary message to stu
dents: Vibrant teaching and stu
dent input just don't matter.
Certainly a class that takes an
in-depth look at constitutional
law deserves funding, but does it
warrant replacing a relatively
cost-effective civil rights class?
While the class does require a
sizable number of teaching assis
tants, Steyer's class does not re
quire an unusually large number
of TAs when compared to other
political science classes. And ac
cording to one course TA,
Steyer's TAs actually took pay
cuts to allow for a bigger class.
The Political Science Depart

ment needs to rethink its budget,
finding some way to keep this
valuable class, while including
the constitutional law course as
well.
Student input seems to have
gotten lost in the department's
decision-making process. The
course consistently receives solid
reviews from student course
evaluations; almost all the com
ments are "good" or "excellent.
While Steyer does not not have
a doctorate, a degree does not
always mean excellence in teach
ing.
Steyer, the president of a
statewide children's advocacy or
ganization, has clearly demon
strated a commitment to under
graduate teaching.
Stanford needs to acknowledge
that such commitment is a prio
rity, rewarding rather than
penalizing those who bring life
into the classroom.
Great research universities of
ten develop the reputation that
teaching is of secondary impor
tance to professors. Overall,
Stanford has managed to avoid
this pitfall.
But letting someone like Steyer
go signals a step in the wrong
direction.
The decision to scrap a civil
rights course seems ironic given
that the Undergraduate Commit
tee on Minority Issues report, re
leased last month, calls for in
creases in ethnic studies courses.
Civil Rights and Civil Liberties
studies race and sex discrimina
tion and affirmative action.
Before cutting a course that
deals head-on with issues of mi
nority discrimination in the con
text of law, the Political Science
Department should remember
what the UCMI report and stu
dents at large are calling for.
