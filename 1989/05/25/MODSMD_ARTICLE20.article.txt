## Interdisciplinary blues 
### 
IMAGINE THAT YOU are an ex
tremely bright, well-respected and
creative professor at a major univer
sity that encourages interdisciplinary
work and innovative academic programs.
After a couple of years, you and a few
of your colleagues take advantage of that
academic latitude and set up a new pro
gram in a non-traditional area. Let's say
that the program enjoys smashing success
among undergraduates and critical ac
claim among your peers.
But running the program turns into
mission impossible. You can't get any
faculty appointments of your own. You
are low on the totem pole for University
fundraising. You have to spend most of
your time begging established depart
ments for resources instead of either
doing research in your field or teaching
all the undergraduates that sign up for
your classes.
Welcome to Stanford.
Stanford has an elaborate but schizo
phrenic approach to interdisciplinary
programing. On the one hand the school
strongly encourages extra- and inter
departmental work.
But on the other hand, the school pro
vides no adequate mechanism to support
these programs once they are born. The
programs have almost no resources of
their own and little access to the means
of acquiring those resources. They have
got to beg, borrow or steal the tools of
their trade from established departments.
Most seriously, the ID programs have
no way of providing faculty-level positions
to their staff. If you don't have faculty
billets to dispose of, then you are at the

mercy of the established departments who
do — and who may not take kindly to
their faculty being used in your program.
And without a mechanism for granting
faculty-level appointments, programs can
not build. A full professor at Harvard is
not going to take the untenured, low
prestige post of a senior associate in any
ID program at Stanford. That means that
the ID programs cannot recruit the best
people.
Take the case of Theodore Postol, a
senior research associate at the Center
for International Security and Arms Con
trol. Postol is an acknowledged expert in
his field, but the center had no way of
offering him a faculty appointment under
existing University policy.
So next year Postol will not be at Stan
ford. He'll be a full professor with tenure
at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
When he was at Stanford, he was not
even allowed to be the principle inves
tigator on his grant applications.
As Postol's case illustrates, Stanford
can't build interdisciplinary programs
based on patchwork appointments and
precarious good will. Fortunately, Stan
ford has four very different in-house
models of functioning ID programs, each
of which provides access to faculty billets.
The first two are the Stanford Linear
Accelerator Center and Hoover Institu
tion. Both are set up as centers or in
stitutes with effective departmental
power — including the power of appoint
ment — even though they take no stu
dents and confer no degrees.
The third is the Comparative Litera
ture Department. Comp Lit used to be

Indeed, the distinction between a "de
partment" and a "program" — a distinc
tion that the school seems intent on main
taining — is more than a little confusing,
arbitrary and unfair. For further reading,
see James Adams' eloquent essay in the
most recent issue of Techne magazine,
the undergraduate journal for Values,
Technology, Science and Society.
The final model is the Human Biology
Department. Unique among ID programs,
Hum Bio has four half-billets provided
by the Dean's Office. These half-billets
give Hum Bio a mechanism for hiring
faculty jointly with other departments —
these faculty teach primarily in Hum Bio
and do reserach primarily in the associ
ated department.
Stanford has an obligation to the people
who staff these programs, to the students
who enroll in them, and most importantly
to the faculty who try to build them. It
is not fair for the school to milk the
effort and creativity of so many of its
best faculty without giving them an
honest chance to build a lasting program.
