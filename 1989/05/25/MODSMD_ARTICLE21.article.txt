## Chinese students justified in battling government 
### 
AS I WRITE, the lives and fu
tures of more than one billion
people, a fifth of the world's
population, hang in the balance.
This is a sobering thought, and it is
accompanied by a natural frustration
because at the same time that Chinese
students and workers are risking their
lives and futures for the sake of their
country, we at Stanford who care
about China cannot physically be at
their sides.
I ask myself what I can do here at
Stanford to support the student move
ment in China, and one answer is that
I can try to explain to as many poeple
as possible what the movement is
about.
What I believe to be at the heart of
this movement, and what I believe is
underlying the call for democracy in

China, is the fundamental human need
of people to have some measure of
control over their lives. In China today,
this is largely absent.
High-ranking Communist Party
officials are simply not bound by laws,
and this being the case, they have
absolute power over the average per
son. They can and do decide, for exam
ple, where one lives, where one works
and how many children one can have.
What is most frightening is not
these rules, however unreasonable they
may seem to Americans, for most
Chinese are remarkably adaptable and
have gotten used to them. But rather
what is frightening is that these rules
can change at any time, and at the
whim of party officials. For example, a
person may have made an agreement
with the government that if he paid a

certain fee for 20 years he would
"own" a particular apartment at the
end of that time.
But if after 19 years of payment
some party official decides that he
wants to live in that apartment, the
original agreement is just thrown out.
Think about living like that, always
with the uncertainty that anything
could happen the next day and that
you would have no power over it. It is
this state of affairs that really leads to
a loss of control over one's life and
which affects all Chinese people.
Thus the present movement is less a
protest about political philosophy and
more a movement springing from the
people's basic dissatisfaction with their
lives and their helplessness to change
them. As such, the movement is not
confined to students and intellectuals,

and this is evidenced by the tremen
dous support the students have re
ceived from factory workers, bus
drivers, journalists, ordinary people
young and old, and even police and
soldiers.
Just like the little boy who pointed
out that the Emperor wore no clothes,
the Chinese students have finally
stated what has been apparent to the
large majority of the Chinese people
for the longest time, but which has
never been publically voiced for fear of
reprisal; that corruption is rampant in
the Communist Party, that the Com
munist Party is not "serving the
people," and that the People's Republic
of China is not yet a true people's
republic of China.
