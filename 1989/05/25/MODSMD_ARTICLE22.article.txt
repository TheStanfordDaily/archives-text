# Strip was offensive in its portrayal of incoming freshman
## 
### 
This is a letter in response to the
May 22 Strip Search. The comic strip
featured incoming freshman swimmer
Janet Evans. On behalf of Evans, who
we hope never sees this comic strip, we
found the depiction of Evans insensi
tive and tasteless.
It is an ignorant decision to depict
her in this manner. Evans is a super
star, but she is also a humble, 17-year
old girl, who, like every other incoming
freshman, is excited about attending
Stanford next year.
To prejudice the Stanford community
in this manner is unfair to Evans and
those who haven't met her. In the fu
ture, we hope The Daily will exercise

better judgment.
