# MEChA does not live up to its own ideal of democracy
## 
### 
Here is MEChA's idea of democratic
control of El Centro: "All students will
be elected by a democratic vote at a
special meeting called by MEChA, in
which any Chicano students can run."
Through Barrio Assistance I have
used the resources at El Centro every
week for the last two years. MEChA
seems to think that because I am not
Chicano, I am not entitled to a say
concerning these resources. Clearly,
MEChA aims not at democracy as they
claim, but at sole control over the
most enviable student center on
campus. I remind them that Chicano
students are not the only ones paying
tuition.
