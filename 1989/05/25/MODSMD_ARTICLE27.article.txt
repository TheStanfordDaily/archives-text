## Tarango, Blackman fall in NCAA singles competition 
### Cameron Macky Senior staff writer 
ATHENS, Ga. — History repeated itself
one too many times for the Stanford men's
tennis team yesterday when, for the second
year in a row, no Cardinal player survived
the first day of play in the NCAA singles
tournament.
Both Jeff Tarango and Martin Blackman,
Stanford's only entrants in the tourney, fell
in first-round matches that were hardly show
cases for the two players' talent.
"I don't think either player played to their
ability," Stanford Coach Dick Gould said.
Like last year, the early dismissals might
be partly a result of a serious letdown after
the euphoria of taking the team title, but,
according to Gould, that's not a good enough
explanation.
"Yes, 1 think there is a letdown, but you
can rise above it," Gould said. "It has to be
done, and a great player can do that. A good
player will lose in the first round the next
time he plays after winning a tournament. It
happens time and again.
"I hope guys don't get in the habit of saying
you can't do well (in the individuals) after
winning the team title," Gould continued.
"The problem letdown Tarango, who fell
1-6, 6-4, 6-4 to SMU's Brian Devening. He
just wasn't able to adjust his game to Deven
ing's.
"(In the first set) I was hitting out, hitting
loose, and returning his serve pretty well,"
Tarango said. "I was playing like I probably
should play all the time.
"After that, I got a little tight, but I didn't
try to change my game. I still tried to hit the
same shots."
It didn't work. Serving at 2-3 in the second
set, Tarango was up 3-1 in the game when
Devening hit a forehand approach shot just
inside the left line. "Nice shot," Tarango said.
Devening would hit several more before the
match was over, but didn't need to in this
game. Tarango put a backhand in the net,
then hit another long, and Devening was up
4-2.
Tarango sandwiched an unforced error be
tween two long service returns in the next
game, then watched an ace whiz by for a 5-2
Devening lead. After holding serve (saving a
set point with a smash on three-all), Tarango
was down three-zip in the next game.
He could have folded right then, but didn't

even think of it. He battled back to three-all
and was back on serve when a Devening back
hand ended up in the net.
Devening got the break — and the set —
right back with the help of four unforced
errors by Tarango. It was the third straight
game to go to three-all before being decided.
"I knew the kind of game I wanted to play
to try and win the tournament, and I didn't
want to change that for anyone," Tarango said.
"I figured I'd keep playing my game. That's
a little stupid — not changing."
Three of the next four games also went to
three-all, after which the set was tied 2-2.
Devening held serve on four points for 3-2,
and then, with Tarango serving, got to a 2-3
break point.
Devening hit a forehand approach deep in
the left corner. Tarango, who was running
the other way, turned and slipped, and could
barely get his racket on the ball. Devening
had a break, and Tarango slammed his racket
against the fence in disgust.
Things seemed to get worse in the next
game when Devening threw an ace right by
Tarango. "What am I supposed to do about
that?" he yelled. Not much. Devening did it
again two points later and was up 3-1 before
a double fault and an errant volley knotted
the score.
After a short rally, Tarango came up with
a sizzling forehand that landed just inside the
baseline. Back on serve, Tarango came up
with two huge serves to close out game eight,
and, when Devening sprayed a mishit wide,
had two break points. Devening saved one on
a serve and volley, and took the game when
Tarango couldn't handle the next serve.
At one-all in the next game, Tarango just
missed the deep left corner, and then Devening
had a match point after a sweet topspin lob

left Tarango frozen in his tracks. Tarango
then sent a forehand wide, and the match was
history.
"(Jeff) played well in the first set. He didn't
let Devening play well," Stanford Asst. Coach
John Whitlinger said. "After that, he got a
little tight.
"Once you get to four-all in the third set
anything can happen, and, unfortunately, it
did."
"Devening's a good player, but this certainly
isn't a match I thought Jeff would lose," Gould
said. "In the last two sets, it seemed he was
out there just swinging at the ball, instead
of playing with a purpose."
"I didn't do what I had to do to win the
match," Tarango said. "I was a little stub
born. . . He (Devening) started hitting a few
good shots, and I just lost."
So did Blackman, who dropped a 6-3, 6-2
decision to Clemson's John Sullivan. "1
couldn't really get into it, couldn't get a good
rhythm," Blackman said. "He played pretty
well."
He did indeed, especially when he was serv
ing. Sullivan converted a break point with a
topspin lob in the match's fourth game, then
served two games at love for a 5-2 lead.
Blackman held, but then, leading 2-0 on
Sullivan's serve, hit a forehand into the net,
a volley into the net, a service return into the
net, and a service return — long. Good guess,
though. First set, 6-3.
Sullivan broke again to take a 2-1 advantage,
and the match was all but over. He served
another love game for 4-2, broke again, and
served — yup — a love game for the match.
"The other guy served really well," Gould
said. "He also hit his backhand great. I was
hoping [Blackman] would play a little more
solidly, though."
Blackman and Tarango had probably hoped
the same.

Devening got the break — and the set —
right back with the help of four unforced
errors by Tarango. It was the third straight
game to go to three-all before being decided.
"I knew the kind of game I wanted to play
to try and win the tournament, and I didn't
want to change that for anyone," Tarango said.
"I figured I'd keep playing my game. That's
a little stupid — not changing."
Three of the next four games also went to
three-all, after which the set was tied 2-2.
Devening held serve on four points for 3-2,
and then, with Tarango serving, got to a 2-3
break point.
Devening hit a forehand approach deep in
the left corner. Tarango, who was running
the other way, turned and slipped, and could
barely get his racket on the ball. Devening
had a break, and Tarango slammed his racket
against the fence in disgust.
Things seemed to get worse in the next
game when Devening threw an ace right by
Tarango. "What am I supposed to do about
that?" he yelled. Not much. Devening did it
again two points later and was up 3-1 before
a double fault and an errant volley knotted
the score.
After a short rally, Tarango came up with
a sizzling forehand that landed just inside the
baseline. Back on serve, Tarango came up
with two huge serves to close out game eight,
and, when Devening sprayed a mishit wide,
had two break points. Devening saved one on
a serve and volley, and took the game when
Tarango couldn't handle the next serve.
At one-all in the next game, Tarango just
missed the deep left corner, and then Devening
had a match point after a sweet topspin lob

left Tarango frozen in his tracks. Tarango
then sent a forehand wide, and the match was
history.
"(Jeff) played well in the first set. He didn't
let Devening play well," Stanford Asst. Coach
John Whitlinger said. "After that, he got a
little tight.
"Once you get to four-all in the third set
anything can happen, and, unfortunately, it
did."
"Devening's a good player, but this certainly
isn't a match I thought Jeff would lose," Gould
said. "In the last two sets, it seemed he was
out there just swinging at the ball, instead
of playing with a purpose."
"I didn't do what I had to do to win the
match," Tarango said. "I was a little stub
born. . . He (Devening) started hitting a few
good shots, and I just lost."
So did Blackman, who dropped a 6-3, 6-2
decision to Clemson's John Sullivan. "1
couldn't really get into it, couldn't get a good
rhythm," Blackman said. "He played pretty
well."
He did indeed, especially when he was serv
ing. Sullivan converted a break point with a
topspin lob in the match's fourth game, then
served two games at love for a 5-2 lead.
Blackman held, but then, leading 2-0 on
Sullivan's serve, hit a forehand into the net,
a volley into the net, a service return into the
net, and a service return — long. Good guess,
though. First set, 6-3.
Sullivan broke again to take a 2-1 advantage,
and the match was all but over. He served
another love game for 4-2, broke again, and
served — yup — a love game for the match.
"The other guy served really well," Gould
said. "He also hit his backhand great. I was
hoping [Blackman] would play a little more
solidly, though."
Blackman and Tarango had probably hoped
the same.

Sophomore Martin Blackman lost in the first round of the NCAA
singles bracket yesterday.
ATHENS, Ga. — History repeated itself
one too many times for the Stanford men's
tennis team yesterday when, for the second
year in a row, no Cardinal player survived
the first day of play in the NCAA singles
tournament.
Both Jeff Tarango and Martin Blackman,
Stanford's only entrants in the tourney, fell
in first-round matches that were hardly show
cases for the two players' talent.
"I don't think either player played to their
ability," Stanford Coach Dick Gould said.
Like last year, the early dismissals might
be partly a result of a serious letdown after
the euphoria of taking the team title, but,
according to Gould, that's not a good enough
explanation.
"Yes, 1 think there is a letdown, but you
can rise above it," Gould said. "It has to be
done, and a great player can do that. A good
player will lose in the first round the next
time he plays after winning a tournament. It
happens time and again.
"I hope guys don't get in the habit of saying
you can't do well (in the individuals) after
winning the team title," Gould continued.
"The problem letdown Tarango, who fell
1-6, 6-4, 6-4 to SMU's Brian Devening. He
just wasn't able to adjust his game to Deven
ing's.
"(In the first set) I was hitting out, hitting
loose, and returning his serve pretty well,"
Tarango said. "I was playing like I probably
should play all the time.
"After that, I got a little tight, but I didn't
try to change my game. I still tried to hit the
same shots."
It didn't work. Serving at 2-3 in the second
set, Tarango was up 3-1 in the game when
Devening hit a forehand approach shot just
inside the left line. "Nice shot," Tarango said.
Devening would hit several more before the
match was over, but didn't need to in this
game. Tarango put a backhand in the net,
then hit another long, and Devening was up
4-2.
Tarango sandwiched an unforced error be
tween two long service returns in the next
game, then watched an ace whiz by for a 5-2
Devening lead. After holding serve (saving a
set point with a smash on three-all), Tarango
was down three-zip in the next game.
He could have folded right then, but didn't
