# Men's crew splashed by Eastern rowers
## 
### Andrew Wilcox Staff writer 
The men's crew team got a taste
of what rowing tradition is all
about last weekend, facing two of
the nation's elite crews, Pennsyl
vania and Northeastern, at the
mecca of American rowing, the
Charles River in Boston, Mass.
In the process, they also got a
reminder of how much ground
Stanford must make up before
moving into crew's upper echelon,
as Pennsylvania and Northeast
ern thrashed the Cardinal varsity
eight boat in the Burk Cup regat
ta, which wound up Stanford's
season.
Stanford, with a 6:08 clocking,
finished a staggering 18 seconds
behind Pennsylvania, who
finished third in the prestigious
Eastern Sprint Championships
earlier this month. Northeastern,
which recently beat top-ranked
Harvard, pulled in at 5:52 to cap
ture second.
As the times indicate, Stanford
was outclassed, falling behind

from the first stroke and rowing
in a distant third throughout the
race.
"I'm disappointed with our race
â€” it's not the way I wanted to
end my rowing career at Stanford.
Everyone expected to do better,
but Penn and Northeastern are
among the best," senior captain
Tyler Simonton said.
"These eastern teams are still
bigger, stonger, fitter and more
experienced than we are. It's hard
to gain on them when they do
every single thing well. They get
much more rowing time than we
do because of the way the season
is set up," Coach Ken Dreyfuss
said.
Despite the humbling defeat in
the race, the East Coast trip,
which was the first for Stanford
crew in years, was a learning ex
perience for the team, Dreyfuss
said.
"We were able to measure our
selves against the very best. This
pointed out our needs for next
year," Dreyfuss added.
