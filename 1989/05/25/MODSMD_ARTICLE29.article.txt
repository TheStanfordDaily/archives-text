# The 						worst and best of the '89 baseball season

Fellow Daily baseball writer
Bruce "The Shark"
Sarkisian and I have come
up with a list of lowlights and
highlights from the 1989 Cardi
nal baseball season.
Since the season ended on the
lowest of notes — no bid to the
NCAA Regionals — we'll start
with the season's low points.
Lowlights, in order of ugli
ness:
• The 13-inning, 5-hour mar
athon at ASU when Stanford
blew a 7-4 lead in the ninth and
one-run leads in both the 11th
and 13th innings. Relief ace
Steve Chitren could not do the
job. Rightfielder Paul Carey's er
ror set up the tying run in the
11th and shortstop Roger Bur
nett's allowed the winning run
in 13th.
• In the first game of the
season against Santa Clara,
Chitren gave up back-to-back
homers to tie it 2-2 in the eighth
and surrendered the winning
run in the 11th. The Cardinal
followed that up with two more
losses to start the season, setting
the tone for a hard-luck year.
• Arizona State swept a three

game set from the Cardinal at
Sunken Diamond, just the third
time that has happened since the
Six-Pac was formed in 1979 and
the first since 1984. The Devils
totaled 27 runs to the Cardinal's
10.
• In game one of a three-game
set at home against Arizona, the
Cardinal wasted a 5-3 lead in
the ninth. An excellent perform
ance from starter Stan Spencer
went for naught. A wild pitch
scored the winning run from
third.
• Spencer was knocked out in
the first inning of a 17-3 shel

lacking at Arizona, setting the
tone for a series that saw the
'Cats score 34 runs — 30 in the
first two games.
• The injury to a tendon in
the elbow of ace starting pitcher
Mike Mussina. Without him
anchoring the starting rotation,
the Cardinal pitching staff could
not get on track until it was too
late.
• For the first time in three
years, Stanford dropped a game
to lowly USF. Enough said.
Highlights, in order of great
ness:
• Stanford's thrashing of
conference-leading Arizona in
the final two games of the series
at Sunken Diamond. The Cardi
nal took two straight by a com
bined score of 23-8, avenging the
earlier embarassment at Tucson.
The two wins started Stanford's
nine of 10 streak to end the year,
the only blemish being a 7-6 loss
to California.
• Stanford took two straight
from West Coast Athletic Con
ference champion Pepperdine to
close the season, allowing just
one run in the process and win
ning by scores of 1-0 and 2-1.

Frank Carey won the second
game for Stanford with a solo
home run and an RBI single.
Brian Keyser's complete game
shutout against the Waves was
the first of his career.
• Keyser's 8% innings of relief
to get the win in a Saturday
game at USC. That was the start
of his awesome streak that in
cluded a complete-game victory
over Arizona here and eight full
innings to get a win at Cal
• Paul Carey's great second
half of the season in which he
batted over .400 and clubbed 12
homers in 23 games to finish
with 16 on the season. He now
has 40 for his career, third on
the all-time Stanford list behind
Ed Sprague's 41 and Rick
Lunblade's 42. The top homer
of the year for Carey was a gar
gantuan shot onto the parking
structure beyond the right field
fence at USC.
° Speaking of mammoth shots,
designated hitter Tim Griffin
clubbed one over the "Green
Monster" in center field at Pack
ard Stadium in Tempe, Ariz. It

was only the second time an op
position player had ever launched
one over the wall.
• Second baseman Frank Carey
finished his Cardinal career with
247 games played, one shy of
Ruben Amaro's school record. He
banged out 49 doubles while on
the Farm, one shy of Mark Davis'
school record.
• Chitren's start at Arizona to
salvage a game of the series after
no one else on the staff could get
an Arizona batter out. It was
Chitren's first start of the season,
as he was pushed into that role
by the injury to Mussina.
• Mussina, in his last start

before his injury, shut out the
Bears at Berkeley 2-0, fanning 12
and allowing just two hits. It was
without question the best regular
season performance of his career.
• Spencer finished the year
strongly with a complete-game
victory against Cal and allowed
one run on eight hits in going the
route against Pepperdine, that
after picking up win in a Tuesday
game against Santa Clara. He was
often the victim of little run sup
port — a measly average of 2.3
runs in his seven losses.
• Freshman highlights: Roger
Burnett and David Holbrook both
had terrific seasons in establish
ing themselves at shortstop and
third for the future. Holbrook was
the team's most consistent hitter
this season and led the club in

batting average most of the year.
Burnett gave us a look at the
shortstop of the future, making
only 8 errors and providing un
expected power with six homers.
David McCarty showed the prom
ise that he'll be a more than ad
equate replacement — offensively
and defensively (he had one error
on the year) — for former Cardi
nal first baseman Ron Witmeyer.
In retrospect, a team that
started five freshmen much of the
season did quite well to recover
from a dismal start, but it wasn't
quite enough to gain a postseason
berth. We got a glimpse of what
the Cardinal will be like next
season with the nine of 10 finish,
but the team will have large gaps
to fill as seniors Frank Carey,
Keyser and Chitren look to the
mtyor league draft in June.
