# Police on prowl for assailant
## 
### Kathy Lachenauer Editorial staff 
The Stanford Police Depart
ment is in pursuit of an uniden
tified man suspected of assaulting
a female Stanford student 9 p.m.
May 16 outside a campus dorm.
The assailant, who has black
hair, green eyes and is about 6-
feet tall and weighs 170 pounds,
struck the woman on the back of
her head with an object. The
woman sustained injuries and was
treated at Cowell Student Health
Center. The police would not give
any other specifics about the in
cident, at the victim's request.
Police Sgt. Philip Love said the
detective division is having some
difficulties with the week-old case
because they are "working with
a limited amount of evidence."
Police do not have the object
used on the victim, but they do

have a composite picture of the
suspect who is believed to be in
his mid-20s. The victim spent
about four hours working with a
police artist who sketched the
composite, Love said.
The suspect goes by the name
"Brent" and has been spotted
around Tresidder Union within
the last week, he said.
While the police do not think
the assailant is a Stanford stu
dent, they have not ruled out the
option.
Police have requested public as
sistance in identifying the suspect.
Those who have any information
about him should contact the
Police Department's detective di
vision at 723-9633.
Love does not believe that last
week's assault has led to any
others. "I haven't seen an up
surge. We hope there isn't," he
said.
