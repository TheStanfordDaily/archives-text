# Athletes of the Week
## 
### 
With the NCAA tennis championships
going on this past week, it seemed inevitable
The Daily's Athletes of the Week would do
their business with a racket.
Given that, the crack sports staff has cho
sen two Cardinal stars who are firm believers
in the old adage "What goes around, comes
around." They are Sandra Birch and Alex
O'Brien.
Birch, a 5-foot-6 sophomore from Hunt

ington Bay, N.Y., hardly seemed to be on
the road to an NCAA individual title when
she dropped three straight sets early on in
the team competition.
But even before the Cardinal had captured
its fourth straight title, Birch was already
returning to form. And, on the first day of
singles competition, she scored two impres
sive 6-2, 6-3, wins over UCIJVs Alysia May
and BYU's Mary Beth Young.
The next day, the Cardinal duo knocked
off the doubles competition's top seeds,
Stella Sampras and Mamie Ceniza, and Birch
continued her strong play in singles. She
bested Florida's Nicole Arendt 6-2, 7-6, and
Pepperdine's Ginger Helgeson 6-2, 7-6.
Weary and fighting the pain of a pulled
stomach muscle, Birch came back 24 hours
later to take out teammate Lisa Green 6-4,
6-2, and score two more doubles wins.
Finally, Thursday, Birch won the cham
pionship by beating SMU's Jennifer
Santrock 6-3, 6-3.

O'Brien, a 6-foot freshman from Amarillo,
Tex., has struggled with his serve all season
long due to a shoulder iryury.
And so, with the Cardinal in desperate
need of a strong performance from its No.
4 singles player, O'Brien storms through
the team competition allowing his serve to
be broken exactly once.
He didn't lose a set.
In Stanford's first-round match against
Miami, O'Brien opened a 4-1 lead when his

opponent, Tommy Phanco, defaulted.
The Cardinal advanced to meet LSU and
O'Brien drew Tom Furukrantz. The Tiger
provided little challenge as O'Brien blew him
off the court 6-2, 6-1.
In the final, Georgia's T.J. Middleton went
meekly and auickly 6-0, 6-1. O'Brien's big
time Dlay helped Stanford bring home its
second title in a row.
