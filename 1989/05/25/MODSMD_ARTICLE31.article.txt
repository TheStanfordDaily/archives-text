## 
### David Hirning Staff writer 
While the women's golf team
basks in the national spotlight by
hosting the NCAA tournament,
the men's squad is down in sultry
El Paso, Tex. taking care of some
business. Namely, the linksters
are in the Regionals, trying to
advance to the NCAA tournament
for the first tune in three years
Second-year Coach YVally Good
win took his five players down to
Texas on Monday, to help them
get accustomed to the playing con
ditions — read, "heat." Yes, the
temperatures will be high when
the first of three rounds begins
today at the El Paso Country
Club, but then so are the team's
expectations.
Even the coach, who as a rule
must downplay confidence when
ever possible, spares any words
of caution. "I will be very, very
disappointed if we don't get to the
finals," Goodwin said last week.
In all truth, the odds are very
good that the Cardinal will move
on to the 30-team NCAA tourna
ment held in early June. Of the
16 teams that are in the regional,
more than half — nine, to be exact
— will stay alive.

It may have been more of test
for the Cardinal simply to qualify
for the regional. It was not
decided until the final tournament
of the season if Stanford, Califor
nia, or maybe neither would In
one of the 10 teams chosen >ut
of District 8.
After failing to defeat UC Sant«
Barbara or Cal in a dismal eighth
place showing at the Brigham
Young tournament, it came down
to the Pacific-10 championships
May 1-3. There, the Cardinal had
its best tournament of the year,
finishing third, with the field's
low-round on the third day. Fresh
man Christian Cevaer won the
tournament by three strokes.
And so, early last week, (lo<>d
win heard from the selection com
mittee that the team would l>e or
its way to El Paso soon
The one pitfall for Stanford may
be the middle-round le'dowi th<»t
has plagued them recently I
don t know * hy we haven't played
well the second day," Goodwin
said
"We just have to face up to it
as a problem. We will have team
meetings every night during the
tournament, similar to the psych
up session we had before the final
round at Pac-lOs "
