# Golfers still in the hunt at NCAAs
## 
### David Hirning Staff writer 
"It was unbelievable what was
going through my mind the first
two holes."
Freshman Cardinal golfer
Stephanie Davis summed up the
general mood at the first day of
the NCAA 1989 Women's Golf
Championships. A nervous Stan
ford squad managed to pull
enough shots out of the hat to
place eighth overall in the 17 team
field, but Jodi Figley's par round
was the only score to be proud of.
The jitters were evident to Stan
ford Coach Tim Baldwin. "I could
see it in their swings," he said
with a laugh. "They we're pretty
quick going back. But we're young
— Jodi Figley is the only member
who has played in the NCAAs
before."
Defending champion Tulsa ran
away with the team lead, firing
a two-over 294 to lead second
place Florida by six strokes.
"That's a magnificent round,"
Baldwin said. "Tulsa's team prob
ably knows the course better than
our team. They have intense prep
aration, and they know the places
to stay away from."
It was a day when good scores
were rare and one-putts were
rarer. With only six of the 102
golfers at par or better, Figley's
solid 73 was good enough for a
share of third place with three
others. San Jose State's Pat Hurst

lead the field with a three-under
70.
"I started off with a birdie and
thought 'today's a good day,"'
Figley said. "Then I went double
bogey, bogey. ... I missed three
3-putts, little ones. That's not like
me.
Not that she was complaining.
"I'm happy," Figley said. "An even
par on the first day, I'll take it.
I'll take it four days in a row."
As it stands, four pars may be
enough to win, given the very
average scores that were turned
in by some very above-average
players. In one prime example,
the threesome of No. 1 players
from Stanford, New Mexico State
and Ohio State shot a combined
29-over-par on the day.
That Stanford player was Adele
Moore, the stalwart freshman who
has a 77.3 stroke average on the
season. Moore, who said before
the tournament that she used to
rely on her short game to keep
her score low, ironically had her
putting fail her on this day. She
ended with an 81, the low score
for the Cardinal.
But that was, if you'll pardon
the pun, "par for the course" yes
terday, as almost every player
commented on the difficulty of the
greens.
"The greens are scary-fast,"
said Stephanie Parel, the junior
who was third for Stanford with
a 79. "It was a confidence thing
— I was too tentative (on my

putts)."
But Stanford Coach Tim
Baldwin defended the course.
"The greens were smooth and
fast, like they're supposed to be
at the national championships.
They'll accept good shots well, but
if you get it above the hole you're
going to have problems."
Baldwin was also positive about
his team's performance, although
freshman Davis' 78 was the next
lowest score after Figley. "I set a
persona] goal of the top five, and
to be in the top 10 after the first
day.. .we feel good about that."
One bright spot for the Cardinal
was Audrey Wooding, whose
seven-over par 80 is impressive
considering she had to card a 10
on the par-five fourth hole.
Wooding was the only player who
didn't seem to mind the greens.
"My putting was very good — I
was confident on the grass. Other
than the fourth hole, I played
well."
The best finish of the day for
Stanford goes to Figley, who
birdied three of the last four holes.
"I really haven't had any strong
finishes this year," said the soph
omore. As for nervousness, Figley
wasn't immune. "It's the national
championship. It wouldn't be
right if you weren't nervous."
Stanford was joined in the top
10 by a few surprise teams, as
the "feeling-out" day was not

this week.
without its casualties. Top-ranked
Texas shot 313 to tie with 3rd
ranked USC in 12th place. Con
versely, the lowest seeded team,
Minnesota, was tied with Arizona
for third at 308.
Individually, the expected two
way battle for the NCAA title may
become a free-for-all. Texas' Mic

hiko Hattori and ASU's Pearl
Sinn, whom Baldwin calls "the
two world class golfers" on the
college tour, both had difficult
rounds and finished well down in
the pack.
Sinn, the No. 1-ranked amateur
in the world, blamed her putting
for the four-over 77. "The course
played very fair today, but I
couldn't sink any putts. I had two
3-putts and one 4-putt. Putting
was my worst nightmare."
Hattori was rather uncon

cerned with her and her team's
sub-par performance. "We still
have three days — it'll hopefully
get better. Last year, I had 78-
68-77-69,1 think. I had a7B today,
so hopefully. ..."
Texas may be feeling the effects
of limited experience on the Stan
ford course. They were the one
team Baldwin singled out as not
having played the course much.
Hattori backed him in that obser
vation: "This golf course is pretty
tough," he said.
