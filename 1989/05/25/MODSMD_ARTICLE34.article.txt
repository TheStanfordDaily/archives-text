# 'Last Chance' for Strang and Miller
## 
### Greg Gottesman Staff writer 
Sophomore distance run
ner Dave Strang and senior
steeplechaser Steve Miller
will take a final stab at qual
ifying for the NCAA cham
pionships at the Last
Chance Twilight Invita
tional in Eugene, Ore., to
morrow.
Strang will make his final
attempt in the 800 meters.
The NCAA qualifying time
of 1:47.86 sits only slightly
below Strang's best time
this year of 1:48.36.
Also of note, Strang
finished higher than any
other Cardinal male in last
week's Pacific 10 Conference
Championships at Stanford
Stadium, taking second in
the 800 meters with a time
of 1:49.91. According to
Strang, the wind and a slow
first lap were the only thing
that kept him from qualify
ing.
Miller, on the other hand,
met heartbreak last week
end in the Pac-lOs when he
failed to qualify for NCAAs
by just 0.52 seconds. Miller
finished fifth in the race.
