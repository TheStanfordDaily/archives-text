# Raiders of the lost plot
## Bad script, special effects make 'Last Crusade' a lost crusade 
### 
By Alex Kostich
Staff writer
In a summer film season that
is rapidly shaping up to be a slug
fest of tired sequels ("Ghostbusters
2," "Karate Kid 3," "Lethal Weapon
2") and paper-thin concepts
("Young Einstein," "Honey, I
Shrunk the Kids"), "Indiana Jones
and the Last Crusade" has the best
advance word by Hollywood insid
ers.
Many fans also eagerly await the
last installment of Steven Spiel
berg's adventure series. So it puts
me in a very precarious position
to try and convince anyone that
"The Last Crusade" is a bad movie.
But it is.
Now this will not stop anyone
from seeing it, and the film will
probably crack $100 million at the
box office by mid-July; but take
my word for it — be prepared for
a big disappointment.
The movie starts off on the
wrong foot in a perfect example of
gross miscasting. River Phoenix
(who is nonetheless a fine actor)
is plunked into the role of a young
Indiana Jones for the film's 16-
ininute prologue. Unfortunately,
with his fashionable haircut and
pinched features, Phoenix does not
resemble Harrison Ford in the
slightest way, nor does he have
any of Ford's ragged charm
As the young Indy encounters

his first adventure on a Boy Scout
expedition gone awry, it is clear
that the scene bears no comparison
to the opening of "Raiders of the
Lost Ark." In "Raiders" there was
an unpredictable charm which ac
companied each scene, whereas
here the outcome of every situation
is virtually spelled out by the
preceding shot.

In any case, I was prepared to
love the rest of "The Last Crusade"
— after all, I had only seen the
prologue. Starting out in America
circa 1938, the adventure begins
with Indiana Jones being con
fronted by a museum collector who
has found a mysterious piece of
sandstone. An inscription on the
relic indicates the location of the
Holy Grail.
But part of the stone is missing,
and the collector asks Jones to find
it. Our hero refuses until he learns
that the disappearance of his father
is somehow connected with the
search for the Holy Grail. So before
you can say "adventure," Jones is
whisked off to Venice, Ankara, Jor-

INDIANA JONES

dan and Spam in search of the
rock, the Grail and his father.
Luckily, Jones finds his father
first, in the form of Sean Connery,
and the film is briefly salvaged.
The chemistry between Connery
and Harrison Ford is one of the
few charming aspects of "The Last
Crusade." Together they bicker
through the dangerous pratfalls

that they encounter, bringing a bit
of lighthearted spunk to an other
wise bland plot.
Connery is great, but he is stuck
with campy dialogue ("If the Grail
is found by the Nazis, armies of
darkness shall march over the face
of the earth!"). Ford tries hard: re
quired to act like an adolescent in
the presence of his father, he rolls
his eyes a lot and puts on his
trademark "Why me!" expression.
It's a throwback to his "Raiders"
days, but it doesn't capture the
spirit of the earlier film. Watching
these two good actors struggle with

a lame script is not amusing —
it's sad.
I was also prepared to be stunned
by the elaborate action sequences
and Spielbergian effects. Instead, I
witnessed an embarrassingly fake
blimp scene followed by an even
worse fighter-plane battle (in al
most every aerial shot, a thin blue
line was visible around the planes
where they were pasted on to an
artificial backboard). There is also
a ship-in-a-storm scene where the
bales of water blown on deck look
dumped from above.
Granted, there are a few exciting
moments where danger and peril
seem inevitable, but compared to
"Raiders" and even "Temple of
Doom" (which was unjustly criti
cized), there is nothing extraordi
nary. A brief motorcycle chase and
the final climax are highlights in
this remarkably tame action/ad
venture.
Particularly offensive (even to
me) is "The Last Crusade's"
misogynist attitude. There is one
woman in the entire film, a blond
bombshell (Alison Doody), who
manages to be a bimbo and a bitch
at the same time. Not only is she
an unlikable character, but she
foils every attempt Jones makes to

reach the Holy Grail. The message
here seems to be that women are
just a burden to the all-male
human race, and if you're looking
for treasure, leave the broad behind
(perhaps this is Spielberg's bitter
in-joke about his recent split with

Amy Irving).
Whereas many expensive films
showcase their waste of money
with elaborate sets and effects (see
"Ishtar" and "Rambo III"), "The
Last Crusade" looks like it cost
about a sixth of its $36 million

budget. Since the money obviously
wasn't spent on effects, my guess
is that it was spent on flying the
cast and crew to the seven different
shooting locations. They should've
stayed in one place (namely the
FX lab).

Sean Connery plays Indiana Jones' father In "Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade."
By Alex Kostich

In a summer film season that
is rapidly shaping up to be a slug
fest of tired sequels ("Ghostbusters
2," "Karate Kid 3," "Lethal Weapon
2") and paper-thin concepts
("Young Einstein," "Honey, I
Shrunk the Kids"), "Indiana Jones
and the Last Crusade" has the best
advance word by Hollywood insid
ers.
Many fans also eagerly await the
last installment of Steven Spiel
berg's adventure series. So it puts
me in a very precarious position
to try and convince anyone that
"The Last Crusade" is a bad movie.
But it is.
Now this will not stop anyone
from seeing it, and the film will
probably crack $100 million at the
box office by mid-July; but take
my word for it — be prepared for
a big disappointment.
The movie starts off on the
wrong foot in a perfect example of
gross miscasting. River Phoenix
(who is nonetheless a fine actor)
is plunked into the role of a young
Indiana Jones for the film's 16-
ininute prologue. Unfortunately,
with his fashionable haircut and
pinched features, Phoenix does not
resemble Harrison Ford in the
slightest way, nor does he have
any of Ford's ragged charm
As the young Indy encounters

his first adventure on a Boy Scout
expedition gone awry, it is clear
that the scene bears no comparison
to the opening of "Raiders of the
Lost Ark." In "Raiders" there was
an unpredictable charm which ac
companied each scene, whereas
here the outcome of every situation
is virtually spelled out by the
preceding shot.

In any case, I was prepared to
love the rest of "The Last Crusade"
— after all, I had only seen the
prologue. Starting out in America
circa 1938, the adventure begins
with Indiana Jones being con
fronted by a museum collector who
has found a mysterious piece of
sandstone. An inscription on the
relic indicates the location of the
Holy Grail.
But part of the stone is missing,
and the collector asks Jones to find
it. Our hero refuses until he learns
that the disappearance of his father
is somehow connected with the
search for the Holy Grail. So before
you can say "adventure," Jones is
whisked off to Venice, Ankara, Jor-

INDIANA JONES

dan and Spam in search of the
rock, the Grail and his father.
Luckily, Jones finds his father
first, in the form of Sean Connery,
and the film is briefly salvaged.
The chemistry between Connery
and Harrison Ford is one of the
few charming aspects of "The Last
Crusade." Together they bicker
through the dangerous pratfalls

that they encounter, bringing a bit
of lighthearted spunk to an other
wise bland plot.
Connery is great, but he is stuck
with campy dialogue ("If the Grail
is found by the Nazis, armies of
darkness shall march over the face
of the earth!"). Ford tries hard: re
quired to act like an adolescent in
the presence of his father, he rolls
his eyes a lot and puts on his
trademark "Why me!" expression.
It's a throwback to his "Raiders"
days, but it doesn't capture the
spirit of the earlier film. Watching
these two good actors struggle with

a lame script is not amusing —
it's sad.
I was also prepared to be stunned
by the elaborate action sequences
and Spielbergian effects. Instead, I
witnessed an embarrassingly fake
blimp scene followed by an even
worse fighter-plane battle (in al
most every aerial shot, a thin blue
line was visible around the planes
where they were pasted on to an
artificial backboard). There is also
a ship-in-a-storm scene where the
bales of water blown on deck look
dumped from above.
Granted, there are a few exciting
moments where danger and peril
seem inevitable, but compared to
"Raiders" and even "Temple of
Doom" (which was unjustly criti
cized), there is nothing extraordi
nary. A brief motorcycle chase and
the final climax are highlights in
this remarkably tame action/ad
venture.
Particularly offensive (even to
me) is "The Last Crusade's"
misogynist attitude. There is one
woman in the entire film, a blond
bombshell (Alison Doody), who
manages to be a bimbo and a bitch
at the same time. Not only is she
an unlikable character, but she
foils every attempt Jones makes to

reach the Holy Grail. The message
here seems to be that women are
just a burden to the all-male
human race, and if you're looking
for treasure, leave the broad behind
(perhaps this is Spielberg's bitter
in-joke about his recent split with

Amy Irving).
Whereas many expensive films
showcase their waste of money
with elaborate sets and effects (see
"Ishtar" and "Rambo III"), "The
Last Crusade" looks like it cost
about a sixth of its $36 million

budget. Since the money obviously
wasn't spent on effects, my guess
is that it was spent on flying the
cast and crew to the seven different
shooting locations. They should've
stayed in one place (namely the
FX lab).
