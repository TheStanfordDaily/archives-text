# It's the turn-of-the-decade — time to come to your census
## 
### 
It's time to stand up and be counted!
No, this isn't another one of those goofy
Students of Color Coalition slogans like
"Hey hey, ho ho, COP provides our
dough." Nope, it's the return of every
body's favorite once-in-a-decade activity,
the U.S. census.
As you may recall, the 1980 census was
criticized for being too long and containing
too many ridiculous, prying questions,
such as "is that your real hair?"
Well fear not, because under the new
waste-cutting, budget-streamlining pro
grams implemented by President C.eorge
Bush and National Mascot Dan Quaylc,
this year's census is EVIN LONGER. So
long, in fact, that the U.S. Census Bureau
isn't able to handle the questionnaire by
itself. Instead, so they can complete the
census by the end of 1990, the Census
Bureau is letting other agencies help to
compile the census information.
To prepare you for the census, here are
a few excerpts from the questionnaire as
compiled by the various agencies which
will be implementing it:
1990 U.S. Census as compiled by the IRS
1) The total number of persons in your

household, except those teenagers claimed
as non-persons on Schedule A

mined by Worksheet C (most households
may exempt one person—we'd recom

nuated granulated income of your
