# Kennedy: Charges won't be dropped
## 
### John Wagner Editorial staff 
University President Donald
Kennedy told members of the
Agenda for Action coalition yes
terday that he will allow judicial
process to run its course.
Coalition members had
demanded that Fundamental
Standard charges be dropped
against the protesters who occu
pied Kennedy's office May 15 on
grounds that the students in
tended to better the University.
But, Kennedy said yesterday
that formal charges will be levied
against individual students by the
end of next week.
"There are obviously questions
of how one takes motives (and)
other possible mitigating factors
into account," Kennedy told The
Daily. However, he said, "That
comes at the end of proceedings
like this â€” not at the beginning."
Kennedy explained his position
to coalition members yesterday
during their second meeting of
the week. Following the meeting,
both sides said some tough issues
had been put on the table, and
that dialogue had been open and
constructive.
Besides discussing judicial
proceedings, Kennedy, the stu
dents and several faculty and ad
ministrators addressed some of
the coalition's demands, including
the establishment of a minority
grievance board, the democratic
selection process for a full-time
dean of El Centro Chicano and a
greater commitment to the Afro-
American Studies Department.
Protesters are being charged
under the campus disruption code
of the Fundamental Standard,
which explicitly states that any
disruption of University business
is a violation of University policy.
Under the code, punishment is
based upon past precedent.
Last night, coalition members
issued a press release stating that
Kennedy "asserted that 'different
people played different roles [in
the protest].' " and should be pun
ished accordingly.

His lack of commitment to
pursue "equal charges and equal
penalties" represented "a tactic
meant to derail student activism
through fear and intimidation,"
the statement read.
"If they make a few of us scape
goats, that's unacceptable," Black
Student Union and coalition mem
ber Cheryl Taylor told The Daily.
"All of us are fighting for the
same goals."
According to the statement,
"The tactic of singling out leaders
for excessive punishment is a com
mon method used by those resist
ing change. In the the civil rights
movement of the 19605, the gov
ernment sought to destroy move
ments for equality by dividing
people through unequal prosecu
tion."
Many coalition members, in
cluding BSU member Louis Jack
son, said they were disappointed
that Kennedy did not see the "hy
pocrisy and irony" in the Univer
sity's application of the Funda
mental Standard.
"We did what we did because
we wanted Stanford to change and
because we care about the insti
tution," Jackson said. Those who
defaced a poster in Ujamaa House
with racial caricatures were not
trying to better the University
and escaped punishment, he said.
Kennedy said the analogy ex
pressed by Jackson and others is
not accurate. "I can see that there
are some ambiguities in the Fun
damental Standard as it applies
to racial harassment," he said.
"But the issue here primarily has
to do with the policy on campus
disruptions, which is a carefully
articulated set of policies and is
just as plain as can be."
Kennedy also defended the
amount of discretion given to the
administration in determining
punishments for campus disrup
tion code violations. In the past,
penalties have ranged from pres
idential reprimand to financial
penalty, suspension and even one
explusion.
"Penalties are determined after
taking into account a number of
factors," Kennedy said. "The pres
ident, who is the final decider of
penalties, is free to do that."
Kennedy said that once current
investigations are completed and
charges are formalized students
will have a choice of two processes.
They may agree to the facts from
the investigation and have the
dean of Student Affairs recom
mend a penalty, or they may con
test the facts, go to a hearing
officer and then have the Stanford
Judicial Council recommend a
penalty.
According to Dean of Student
Affairs James Lyons, students
who go through the first channel
most likely will be able to com
plete the process this spring.

Going through the Judicial Coun
cil will delay the process until fall
quarter, he said.
"Time is obviously an issue for
some," Lyons said. Seniors under
investigation will not be allowed
to receive their diploma until the
investigation has been completed,
he said.
During the meeting between
Kennedy and the coalition yester
day, the administration agreed to
look at the possibility of establish
ing a racial grievance board, which
is one of the coaltion's demands.
Asst. Dean of Student Affairs Mi
chael Jackson said the possibility
would be explored over the sum
mer.
According to Jackson, many of
the coaltion's proposals are di
rected toward the dean of Hu
manities and Sciences. "The pres
ident said he will encourage both
the provost and the dean of Hu
manities and Sciences to make
sure that those issues get to their

attention and are dealt with,"
Jackson said.
Kennedy said he will meet again
with members of the coalition
sometime next week.
