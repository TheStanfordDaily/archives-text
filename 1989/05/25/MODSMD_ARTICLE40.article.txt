# Even hard rockers can enjoy 10,000 maniacs

know everything that they've ever
recorded, you probably won't
notice any difference between this
album's filler songs and those from
"In My Tribe," and 1985's "The
Wishing Chair." . ,
The similarity between their al
bums, though, is due to the fact
that they have developed a unique
sound based on singer Natalie

I like my music hard and fast.
I stick to the basics: Van Halen,
Ozzy Osboume, Scorpions, Metal
lica. You get the picture.
With the noted exceptions of
Belinda Carlisle and Madonna, if
it isn't heavy metal, it isn't played
on my stereo. So, it may surprise
you that I have found a new ex
ception to my no non-heavy metal
bands rule in the form of 10,000
Maniacs.
As you can probaly guess, I have
found no noticeable similarities be
tween the new 10,000 Maniacs al
bum, "Blind Man's Zoo," and say,
Metallica's "And Justice For All."
At no point while listening to
"Blind Man's Zoo" will you have
the urge to bang your head against
a metal railing.
However, "Blind Man's Zoo"
does sound a lot like 10,000
Maniacs' 1987 release, "In My
Tribe." If you are not a hard core
10,000 Maniacs fan and don't

10,000 MANIACS

Merchant's phenomenal voice, and
the other band members' talent on
their respective instruments. It is
not because they are a bunch of
losers and everything they play
sounds the same, as is the case
with Bon Jovi.
Continuing the 10,000 Maniacs'
tradition, which began in 1982

with their self-produced EP,
"Human Conflict #5," many of
the new songs address current so
cial issues. All the big topics, ex
cept the Agenda for Action
Coalition's demands, are covered:
unwanted pregnancy, American
military assistance abroad, Viet
nam, friendship, racial integration,
poisoning the environment, the

plight of the poor, lower tuition,
blah, blah, blah....
If the songs weren't as well
written and produced as they are,
it would be enough to make me
want to barf. In the end, though,
it is Merchant's soothing voice that
saves the band from sounding
really annoying and pretentious,

like Ttacy Chapman.
Instead, 10,000 Maniacs prove
their diversity and talent lyrically
as well as musically throughout
the album. From "Trouble Me," a
refreshing ballad about friendship,
to the somber tale of a poor mother
in "Dust Bowl/' Merchant's dis
tinctive voice blends perfectly with
the equally listenable music.
Although the music isn't exactly
as charged with energy as, say Van
Halen's, it proves to be an enjoy
able listening experience. Since
Merchant has both a fine voice
and a flair for writing poignant
lyrics, it is a pleasant surprise to
find her writing equally creative
music along with her fellow band
mates.
I think it's safe to assume that
if you like 10,000 Maniacs, you'll
probably be interested in picking
this one up, even though side two
drags on a little. It's worth it just
to see how Merchant can sing the
line, "For Christ's sake, he's been
dead over 20 years," and not have
it come out sounding apathetic.
