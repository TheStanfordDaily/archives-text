# The 						looniest monsters
## 
### Matthew Marx Staff writer 
You heard them at Rincadelt,
you've seen their name scrawled
on the bathroom stalls of Meyer
Library, and — admit it —
they've appeared repeatedly in
some of your most pleasurable
fantasies. Who could this be but
Thelonious Monster?
Remember "Sammv Hagar
Weekend," their kickoff at Rin
cadelt? Lead singer Bob Forrest
wailed, "Gonna drink some
beer/smoke some pot/snort
some coke/and drive, drive over
55," as his dangling dirty-blonde
mop shielded his clandestine at
tempts to perform oral sex with
his microphone.
Such profound, introspective
lyrics make Plato and Dante
seem so much less significant.
Maybe we should trade-in those
dead, outdated writers for the
more up-to-date, relevant men
tal perambulations of the Mon
ster.
Truth be told, Thelonious
Monster's "Stormy Weather" al
bum is sure to sate even the
most destructive appetite. The
music walks a crooked line be

twcen heavy metal-wannabe
and folk rock with Marshall
amplifiers; in fact, it's probably
a bit too acoustic for the band's
image.
Never mind that Forrest has
the vocal capacity of a sixth
grader on steroids; he more than
fills the nominal requirements
of Thelonial Monsterdom.
Likewise, the rest of the band
members' performances are
fairly interchangeable. Case in
point: Guitar riffs are particu
larly underwhelming, pre
sumably originating in the Bon
lovi school of six-string tech
nique.
I hope you haven't gotten the
idea that I don't like "Stormy
Weather." The album is so
much fun you can't help but
laugh along.
So volunteer for a couple paid
psych department experiments,
and with your proceeds head on
down University Avenue and
pick up a copy of "Stormy
Weather." Just one problem: I
bought the one and only copy
Rainbow Records had in stock,
so we may have to stage a sit-in
demanding the availability of
enough copies for everyone.
