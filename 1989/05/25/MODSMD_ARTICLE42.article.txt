# Patrick Swayze, his butt, make dramatic return in 'Road House'
## 
### Bill Fagelson Staff writer 
Tom Cruise made bartending hip in
"Cocktail." Patrick Swayze tries to do
the same for life on the other side of
the bar in "Road House."
No, this is not "Dirty Dancing II." It
has a few features that distinguish it
from that. For one, Swayze only dances
once, unless you count the sex scene
that follows. There is also a lot more
blood in "Road House" to enhance your
movie-going experience.
It draws on every cliche imaginable.
It's about Dalton (Swayze) who stands
up to an evil rich guy, Brad Wesley (Ben
Gazzara). The evil guy has 10 thugs who
are armed with machine guns and can
beat the crap out of just about everybody.
Naturally, this evil person wants the
good guy to die. The bad people go
around terrorizing the town and eventu
ally the good guy kills them off one by
one. I wonder why nobody ever thought
of a plot like this before.
Swayze plays Dalton, one of the best
"Cciolers" in the business with a B.A. in
Philosophy. Apparently, a cooler is not
the same thing as a bouncer. Dalton
moves from bar to bar, turning them

into peaceful operations.
He gets hired by a man who owns a
rural Missouri road house in desperate
need of cleaning up. Just by coincidence,
Dalton's a good friend of the band that
plays there. It shows you just how much
these cooler guys get around.
Dalton's first order of business is to
get the bad elements off the staff. These
include a drug-dealing waitress, a hot
tempered bouncer and a bartender skim
ming a few dollars off the top. This only
creates a larger problem. It so happens
that the bartender is a nephew of the
"Bigfoot" truck driver, Wesley. What
starts as an attempt to clean up the
Double Deuce bar ends up as a one man
effort to clean up the town.
In another of those strange coin
cidences, Dalton also starts dating Wes
ley's old girlfriend. Kelly Lynch plays
Doc, the blond, tan girlfriend, which has
led me to seriously consider a major in
cooling (listed in the fall quarter time
schedule under Philosophy). She is a doc
tor at a hospital that is populated with
young beautiful nurses. No, these
women were not a part of the story, but
it would have been nice if they had been.
Dalton eventually calls in Wade Gar
rett (Sam Elliot), his mentor, buddy and

all around nice guy. Wade is the best
cooler in the business, but his age is
beginning to show. Elliott does about as
good a job here as he did in "Shakedown"
(that's a compliment). Wade also knows
the band, further convincing me that
there is something wrong with me be
cause I've never even heard of "coolers"
much less met one.
The Jeff Healey Band is the band at
the Double Deuce, as well as the sup
pliers of half the soundtrack. They are
the main reason I wanted to see this
movie, but it would probably be better
to just buy the record.
Swayze manages to make a mess on
the screen as well as on the soundtrack.
I didn't count the number of times he
bled, much less the number of times
others bled. I have a feeling that this
will be the onlv movie ever created where
teenage girls can get their kicks watching
people die.
This movie has got something for
everybody. Where else can you see blood,
a striptease, annoyingly large pickup
trucks, Patrick Swayze's bare bottom and
a stuffed polar bear all in one sitting?
That's what makes our country great.
You can create something utterly idiotic
and people will eat it up.
