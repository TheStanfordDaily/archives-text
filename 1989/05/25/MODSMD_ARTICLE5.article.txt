# Sexual misconduct allegations levied against Cowell director
## 
### Jason Bloomstein Senior staff writer 
A Massachusetts medical board
last week released an allegation
against the director of Cowell Stu
dent Health Service for sexual
misconduct when he worked at
the Harvard University Health
Services.
The Boston Globe reported yes
terday that a female patient told
the Massachusetts Board of Reg
istration in Medicine that Dr. Paul
Walters, who said he will retire

from Stanford
June 14, had sex
in his office —
sometimes twice
a week — with
her while she was
undergoing psyc
hoanalytic treat
ment with him
between 1972 and
1981.

Walters refused to discuss the
allegation with the Boston Globe
and could not be reached for com
ment last night.

The board has ordered Walters
to respond to the allegation within
21 days from yesterday according
to his lawyer, Marshall Simonds
of Goodwin, Procter and Hoar in
Boston. After that the board has
the right to schedule a hearing in
Massachusetts.
Stanford Psychiatry Prof. Da
vid Spiegel, who said he has no
knowledge of Walters' case and
did not wish to comment on the
specifics, said patients often have
irrational feelings toward their
therapists, and the physician "has

an obligation not to exploit these
irrational positive feelings."
Walters' supervisor, Dean of
Student Affairs James Lyons, said
Walters informed him of the al
legation in November 1988, four
years after Walters became head
of Cowell.
Walters also informed Califor
nia's state board of medical
quality assurance of the allega
tion. It was subsequently agreed
that Walters would limit his direct
patient contact, according to the
Globe.

Lyons said he would not spec
ulate if Walters' retirement is
linked to the allegations. Walters
first informed Lyons of his retire
ment in January and the Cowell
staff in March, Lyons said.
There have been no complaints
against Walters at Stanford, ac
cording to Lyons.
"There have never been any
questions of his practices," he
said. "He has brought a special
philosophy to the University
health service."
Walters became director of

Cowell in 1984 after 10 years as
chief of mental health services at
Harvard.
Walters has been hailed by
many as an innovative director of
Cowell. He has said one of his
main goals is to dispel rumors of
poor treatment at the health cen
ter.
In addition, Walters has been
active in sponsoring health edu
cation programs in dormitories,
mainly focusing on information
on AIDS and mental health.
