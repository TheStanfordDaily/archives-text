# Local residents voice health and safety concerns to University
## 
### Jock Friedly Editorial staff 
At a public hearing last night, the Uni
versity Committee on Health and Safety
listened to community members who
voiced concerns that recent reports on
campus air quality were incomplete and
potentially misleading.
Speakers at the hearing in Cubberley
Education Building — including a lawyer,
a toxicologist, an engineer and the Palo
Alto Fire chief — also pointed to past
problems in health and safety at Stan
ford.
The committee, which intends to hold
annual public hearings, was appointed
last year by University President Donald
Kennedy after recommendations made by

a University-sponsored report on health
and safety.
The Fetterman report came after the
resignation of Jon Moldestad, a former
official in the Department of Health and
Safety, who alleged the University was
involved in cover-up, intimidation and
mismanagement with health and safety
issues. Moldestad later sued the Univer
sity for wrongful termination, harass
ment and intimidation. The case was
settled out of court in March for
$200,000.
Most vocal at the meeting was John
Shaffer, the lawyer representing Moldes
tad in his lawsuit. Shaffer said the re
cently released reports on air quality near
science facilities and the Environmental
Safety Facility have deficiencies notice

able in even a brief reading of the doc
uments. Shaffer received the reports on
the Environmental Safety Facility yester
day morning.
Bob Wall, Palo Alto Fire chief, agreed
with Shaffer. He quoted from the report
on the Biology and chemistry Quad
rangle: "This study did not specifically
address potential occupational risk to lab
workers ... or risk due to unusual or
transient conditions such as risks at
tributable to an accident or spill situation
or to short-term, meteorological events."
Shaffer was most critical of the Uni
versity for operating an incinerator at
the Stanford Medical Center for years
even though there was ample evidence
pointing to severe problems with burning
incinerator contents.

"There are potentially people at the
Medical Center who have been forced to
resign because of Stanford's own ac
tions," Shaffer said.
Shaffer pointed out that in the years
that Stanford officials knew about the
problem, they never once studied whether
serious health problems had occurred.
According to Wall, "The only way you
are going to have a safer environment is
by having a very strong inspection, per
mitting and enforcement program."
"The county does not have the person
nel nor the funds to provide the enforce
ment," Wall said.
Shaffer extended the invitation to the
members of the committee to review hun
dreds of documents and slides he obtained

in litigation procedures.
Faculty members of the committee
present were Biolgical Sciences Prof. Bob
Simoni, chair of the committee; Statistics
Prof. Bill Brown; Radiology Prof. Bill
Northway; Chemistry Prof. Paul Wender;
Organizational Behaviour Prof. Eupene
Webb.
Other members of the committee are
undergraduate Greg Cumberford, a
junior in environmental studies; at-large
member John Hughes, associate provost
for facilities; Lee Thompson, associate
staff counsel; Larry Horton, associate
vice president for public affairs; Patricia
Devaney, associate dean of research; and
Victor Calvo, at-large member of the com
mittee.
