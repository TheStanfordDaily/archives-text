# For Native American students, Lathrop House is a real home

### Paula Gani Staff writer 
When the Native American
community asked for a theme
house in 1984, the University of
fered them Roble Hall. But with
a small population in a huge
dorm, the community lacked uni
ty.
So, the American Indian theme
house moved to Robinson House
in Sterling Quad and spent two
years there, trying to make a
name for itself. But the same
problem remained: The dorm was
too big.
Two years ago the group moved
again. With 29 residents now —
half of whom are Native American
— the American Indian theme
house is finally at home in 343

Lasuen Mall, Lathrop House.
According to Edwin Cooka, res
ident assistant at Lathrop, "We're
still a small community." But, for
the American Indian theme
house, it's been a year of growing.
After the house's transition
year in 1987-88, the goal of this
year's staff was to create an
awareness about Native Ameri
cans at Stanford and "to get
people to take that extra step to
ask about American Indians,"
says Cooka.
Have they been successful in
stirring the interest of fellow stu
dents'' The statistics are encour
aging. This year, 18 people applied
for the single RA position there,
and six sought theme associates
positions. By the end of the first
week of the Draw, more than 300

priorities were given out — a tre
mendous increase over the 16
priorities requested last year.
"People are aware this is the
American Indian theme house and
want to learn more ... it encour
aged us, that we've made our pres
ence on this campus," says Cooka.
Last quarter, Lathrop spon
sored a film series, open to all
students, highlighting the diver
sity among different Native Amer
ican tribes. This quarter, the
house held a dinner for residents
featuring various types of Native
American foods.
Events like these attracted stu
dents like sophomore Janine Jones
to Lathrop. "I'm an American In
dian, and I thought it would help
me to learn a bit more about the
culture, which was something I

didn't know anything about," says
Jones.
Cultural education isn't the
only feature of Lathrop. The
house also functions as a center
of support for many Native Amer
ican students.
For Cooka, the essence of the
house is "friends hanging out with
friends."
However, this may not be
enough for some members of the
Native American community. Ac
cording to Jones, though the
house has been "on the whole,
successful" in its first year, its
small size is sometimes a draw
back.
"A small house is good because
everybody knows each other and
so you are confronted with other
people and their experiences," she

says. "But it's such a small house
that I don't think it has the power
of a large dorm like Casa Zapata."
Even so, according to Cooka,
the Native American community's
efforts to expand and strengthen
its support network have not gone
unnoticed Native American en
rollment at Stanford is slowly in
creasing, says Cooka. One reason
for this increase is that "they
(other Native Americans) know
there is a support system here."
The staff is optimistic about
Lathrop's future. Says Colin
Hampson, next year's RA at
Lathrop, "It's just really exciting
There's just so little Native Amer
ican stufT provided by the Uni
versity that we can do anything
and it will be important and
good."
