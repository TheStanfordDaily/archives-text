# Cowell chief also settled out of court
## 
### Jonathan Eisenberg Staff writer 
Dr. Paul Walters, director of Cowell Student
Health Services, who has been accused of sexual
misconduct with a female patient, settled a separate
out-of-court medical malpractice claim with the
same patient last year, the Boston Globe revealed
yesterday.
A Massachusetts medical board accused Walters
last week of having sex with a patient while she
was undergoing psychoanalysis in his Harvard Uni
versity office between 1972 and 1981. The board
was acting on information from a source other than
the patient.
According to Stanford News Service Director Bob
Beyers, Walters walked into Beyers' office yesterday
morning and announced that he would not be avail
able for comment.
According to the Globe, the patient levied a sep
arate charge through her lawyers against Walters
in 1986. The case was settled out of court in July
1988 for over $200,000.
The Massachusetts Board of Registration in
Medicine stated last week that it had "reason to
believe" that Walters "engaged in conduct which
calls into question his ability to practice medicine."
The 1988 case does not preclude the current case
because it was settled out of court.
According to the Globe, the board gave Walters
21 days to respond to the charges, after which it
can schedule a hearing and ultimately revoke his
Massachusetts medical license permanently.
Walters opted not to renew his medical license in
1987 during the malpractice case, but he is currently
eligible to reapply for a license at any time.
He cannot be prosecuted under criminal charges
in Massachusetts because it is not against the law
for a therapist to have sex with his or her patient.
However, the American Medical Association, the
American Psychiatric Association and the American
Psychological Association have all said that sexual
relations between therapists and clients is unethical
and actionable in every state.
Walters left Harvard University Health Services
in 1984 to become director of Cowell. He will retire
from the Cowell position in June.
According to Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons, no one has made any accusations against
Walters or other doctors at Stanford.
California's Board of Medical Quality Assurance
has known about the case since November 1988
when Walters informed them himself, some four
years after he became head of Cowell, Lyons said.
According to the Globe, Walters and the California
board agreed that he would limit his direct contact
with patients, and he remains officially licensed to
practice medicine in California.
Lyons said yesterday that Walters personally in
formed him of the incidents and the possibility of
an accusation by the Massachusetts board last No
vember "just a few days" before Harvard alerted
Stanford.
Lyons commended Walters for coming to him and
reporting himself to the California board because
he said Walters felt "this information, if left un
responded to in some way, could be deleterious to
the University."
