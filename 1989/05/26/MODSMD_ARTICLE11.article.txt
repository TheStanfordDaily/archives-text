## Chinese hardliners hang on Politburo to decide outcome of power struggle with liberals 
### 
BEIJING (AP) — Premier Li
Peng's hardliners gained new
provincial and military support
yesterday, and the all-powerful
Politburo was deciding the out
come of Li's power struggle with
liberals.
Beijing residents again showed
their colors when more than
100,000 marched through the
streets demanding democracy and
the resignation of Li and senior
leader Deng Xiaoping.
Li made his first public appear
ance since declaring martial law
on Saturday and said soldiers will
enter the capital as soon as resi
dents realize they are needed to
restore order.
The Cabinet ordered local police
and governments to adopt "force
ful measures" to keep students
from reaching Beijing to join a
13-day-old sit-in for democracy by
tens of thousands of students at
Tiananmen Square.
The Communist Party's 17-
member Politburo reportedly
began meeting yesterday to decide
between Li and party General Sec

retary Zhao Ziyang, a relatively
liberal reformer who favored
negotiating with student protest
ers instead of cracking down on
them.
State-run radio said 27 of 29
provinces have backed Li's mar
tial law order in central Beijing.
Li sought to end nearly six weeks
of student-led protests for a free
press and other democratic re
forms.
A supportive letter from the
army headquarters general staff
and general political department
appeared in all major newspapers
and was broadcast on television
and radio, indicating the military
was closing ranks behind Li.
The letter claimed that an uni
dentified "minority of people" was
trying to end Communist Party
rule and added, "If we let their
plot succeed, then the results of
10 years of struggle to reform
China will be for naught."
Six of China's seven military
regions have messaged support
for martial law, as have some
units of the seventh region,

Beijing.
The protests are the biggest
spontaneous political movement
in Communist China's 40-year
history. Li's hardline stance ap
parently reflects the views of
Deng, who has tried to reduce cen
tral controls of China's economy
but refuses to relax tight political
control.
Foreign Ministry spokewoman
Li Jinhua told a weekly briefing
that both Zhao and Li held their
posts as of yesterday afternoon.
Conflicting rumors over the past
week said one or both were
ousted.
Li said yesterday that "anyone
with common sense" should
realize the army could enter
Beijing if it wanted to.
"But our government is a
people's government and our
army is a people's army," the
state-run TV news showed Li tell
ing ambassadors from Mexico,
Burma and Liberia.
He said troops would enter after
citizens understood the reason for
the martial law order.
