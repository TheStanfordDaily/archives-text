# Newly elected Soviet deputies grill Gorbachev on ethnic strife
## 
### 
MOSCOW (AP) — The Soviet Union's
new elected officials pulled no punches
yesterday in demanding to know how
their president handled ethnic strife and
whether he built himself a lavish villa
on the Black Sea.
Mikhail Gorbachev's responses were
equally blunt in some cases but ap
proached evasion in others.
The inaugural session of the Congress
of People's Deputies put the Kremlin
leader for the first time on the parliamen
tary firing line, with elected representa
tives of the Soviet people demanding he
justify his past conduct or explain his

views.
It was a role the Communist Party
chief handled with aplomb, and at times
with visible zest. And thanks to live tele
vision, both the grilling of Gorbachev and
his answers were seen nationwide.
Asked by Estonian People's Front
leader Marju Lauristin when he learned
of plans to bring in the army to break
up a pro-independence demonstration in
Soviet Georgia last month, Gorbachev
said he had not been informed until the
morning after the bloody clash, in which
19 people died.
"I found out only at 10 in the morning

the next day," Gorbachev said.
In his first direct denial that he played
any part in the decision to send in the
troops, Gorbachev said he had considered
dispatching two Politburo members to
the Caucasus republic the day before the
clash, but had been assured the situation
was in hand.
In answer to Lauristin's more general
question about his position on whether
the Red Army should be used to handle
civilian protests, Gorbachev said, "The
army should do its own work," implying
it should be used strictly for military
functions.

But then, apparently thinking out loud,
Gorbachev noted that troops had been
brought in to another southern republic,
Azerbaijan, to quell ethnic rioting in
which 32 people were killed.
The use of the army and police to quell
protests "needs to be thought through,"
he finally said.
The lives of Kremlin leaders were once
outside public criticism, but a deputy
from Leningrad dared to ask Gorbachev
about rumors that surfaced last year that
he was having a plush dacha built for
himself in the Crimea on the sundrenched
coast of the Black Sea.

"I have already said that in my whole
life, neither I nor a member of my family
has owned a dacha," Gorbachev shot back.
However, Gorbachev acknowledged
that a set of "state dachas given to acting
leaders" had been built in the Crimea,
and that although some have been given
to organizations providing health care,
leaders were using the rest.
"These perquisites are everywhere,"
Gorbachev said, adding that even miners
and retirees get special government and
union benefits in the Soviet Union. But
he proposed a commission be set up to
oversee the use of such benefits.
