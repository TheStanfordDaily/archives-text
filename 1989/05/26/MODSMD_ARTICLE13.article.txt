California pipeline fire kills two
SAN BERNARDINO, Calif. (AP) - A geyser
of gasoline erupted from a ruptured pipeline yes
terday and exploded into flame, engulfing the
neighborhood where a runaway train earlier this
month demolished a row of houses. At least two
people were killed.
There was a "very good possibility" the 14-inch
pipeline was damaged by the earlier train acci
dent, said Ken Seal, manager of the Las Vegas
office of the Calnev Pipeline Co.
At least 28 people were injured, three critically.
Ten homes and 18 cars were destroyed and five
homes were damaged in the blaze that radiated
so much heat that pets and garden corn stalks
were singed two blocks away.

"It's like a nightmare," said Delores Jones,
whose house was destroyed by the fire. "I haven't
slept since the train wreck. It's come back to
haunt me."
Arab leaders split over Lebanon

50,000 Syrian troops in the war-plagued country.
Syria, resisting pressure from its traditional foe,
is refusing tu pull out even from Beirut, where
its soldiers and Christian Lebanese troops battled
again yesterday.
