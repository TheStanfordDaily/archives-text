MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) —
Nicaragua yesterday ordered two
U.S. diplomats expelled for al
legedly instigating wildcat teach
ers' strikes.
"This shows the United States
government is committed to dis
obeying the norms of civilized co
existence and is pledged to desta
bilizing governments, such as the
one in Nicaragua, that demand
respect," Foreign Minister Miguel
D'Escoto said.
In Washington, State Depart
ment press officer Dennis Harter
said the charges were "totally
false and without any credible
foundation."
He said the two diplomats had

been engaged in normal activities
fully compatible with their posi
tions.
"Clearly the government of Nic
aragua is embarrassed by the fact
that teachers in Nicaragua are on
strike against conditions in that
country," Harter said.
He added the action was an at
tempt to divert attention from the
fact that the teachers' strike is
being waged by a traditionally
pro-Sandinista trade union.
Dionisio Marenco, a spokesman
for the ruling Sandinista party,
identified the diplomats ordered
expelled as Kathleen Williamson
Barmon, U.S. attache for Central
American labor affairs, and Joel

Franklin Cassman, economic at
tache at the U.S. Embassy in Nic
aragua.
Barmon was given 48 hours to
leave, and Cassman was given 72
hour 9.
Barmon is based in Honduras
but had been in Nicaragua for
two days, Marenco said. Cassman
arrived in Nicaragua last week
along with six other U.S. officials
to replace seven American
diplomats expelled last year.
Marenco said the two "were ex
pelled for interfering in the inter
nal affairs of the country. They
went around distributing money
and exhorting the teachers to
strike."
