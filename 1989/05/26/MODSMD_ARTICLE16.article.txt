## Game, set, match 
### 
WHEN THE MEN'S ten
nis team captured the
NCAA title Tuesday, the
news was greeted with excite
ment, but hardly any surprise.
After all, it was the seventh
time in the '80s that the squad
ventured across the country to
Athens, Ga. and came back as
national champions. A week ago,
the women's team captured their
seventh title in this decade as
well.
Consider how remarkable those
achievements truly are for a mo
ment. Between them, Stanford's
tennis teams hold 14 of the 20
national crowns awarded over the
past 10 years. Unlike basketball
or football — where there are a
number of national powerhouses
— Stanford is the tennis school.
Yet, despite the support the
Stanford community gave to the
men's basketball team this
season, relatively few people have

attended even a single tennis
match. Maybe they figure the
team will win even without
crowds cheering them on. Or per
haps winning has become routine
for them and is no longer inter
esting.
Fortunately, there is a cadre of
individuals who know that a win
ning tradition is no guarantee of
future success — Athletic Direc
tor Andy Geiger, men's Coach
Dick Gould and women's Coach
Frank Brennan. To them: A sin
cere thank you for working tire
lessly to make all these wonderful
championships possible.
And, of course, there are the
athletes themselves. A group of
young men and women with an
intense competitive desire and a
willingness to make sacrifices for
their sport. To our national
champions: Congratulations for
winning — again. We know you'll
be in the hunt for years to come.
