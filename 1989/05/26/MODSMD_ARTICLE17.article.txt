# Keep Dead alive
## 
### 
UNCLE JIM has put a hold
on "Uncle John's Band,"
a hold that must be lifted
to keep a Stanford tradition alive.
The Grateful Dead have played
here for years, but Dean of Stu
dent Affairs James Lyons has
declared that plans for next
year's concert weekend must wait
for University approval. The
hesitation focuses on the large
number of arrests, mostly drug
related, at the concert in Frost
Amphitheater.
The Dead draw a generally
peaceful crowd, many of whom
bring "peace, love and drugs"
with them to the concert. But
they do not generate an atmos
phere of violence, as some other

bands tend to do.
Police and administrative con
cern might be merited if the
bands involved had the concert
history of Run-D.M.C., Public
Enemy or Black Sabbath. The
Dead concerts, however, are
notorious for drug use but no
violence. They do not directly
threaten the overall peace of the
campus.
Outside insurance is available
to cover potential problems any
way. According to Concert Net
work director Steve Cramer,
promoter Bill Graham Presents
provides $1 million of coverage
just for the shows.
If the University prevents fu
ture concerts, the Grateful Dead
will get by. Their fans may not.
