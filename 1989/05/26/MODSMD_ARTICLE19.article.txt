## Debate instead of censor 
### 
DENYING THE EXISTENCE of a
difficult problem is not a produc
tive response.
Yet that is precisely the response many
at Stanford advocate when faced with
unpleasant realities.
For instance, in response to a recent
Budweiser advertisement in The Daily, a
number of people complained that The
Daily should unilaterally refuse to run
ads which they consider sexist.
I would ask anyone who advocates such
a response to sexist or controversial ad
vertising to flip through a few other pub
lications circulated nationally.
Whether in women's or men's
magazines or newspapers, one would be
hard pressed not to find an ad that is
sexist by the standards used to judge the
Budweiser ad.
Even if I were willing to accept that
advertisements featuring good-looking
men or women represent a great social
problem, I do not see how you could
advocate somehow banning such ads from
the Stanford campus.
Many of the modern social architects
who people Stanford seem to think that
if we eradicate all those evil "isms" from
campus the whole problem will be solved.
But wait, there is a real world out
there. These problems are deep-seeded
and can not be simply swept away like
so many grains of sand.
It is irresponsible to create an unreal
istic environment at Stanford â€” given
the pervasiveness of problems of sexism.
Only through extended discussion and
debate can any real solution come about.
And it seems the Budweiser ad of last

week has sparked debate. The discussion
about whether or not the ad should be
censored has been evocative, and such
debate produces more benefits than pull
ing the ad would have.
Removing the ad from the Stanford
environment would also remove this op
portunity for debate.
A more productive and entirely proper
response to ads deemed offensive is sim
ply to not buy the product.
After all, the purpose of ads is to in
crease sales. And the moment an adver
tisment detracts from rather than adding
to sales, it will be pulled by the company.
In the past, groups have campaigned
against advertising campaigns by lobby
ing companies. Letter-writing or petition
campaigns can and do convince compan
ies to pull campaigns.
Advertising is a profit-driven business,
and the fact ia that attractive models add
more to the bottdrn line than unattractive
models.
In the marketing business it is very
hard to pinpoint the precise affect of the
various elements of an advertisement. But
it does seem that sex sells.
The most efficient way to make "sexist"
ads extinct womB be to reverse this sit
uation. Address the problem at the
source: the cowmmer.
Very few national advertisers can af
ford to ignore the fact that sex sells. So
make sure that sex doesn't sell, and the
problem will be solved.
Also realize that the problem is not
restricted to the male gender. I find more
borderline ads in magazines directed
toward women than in magazines di

rected towards men.
Clearly, the consuming public tends to
respond to such ads; otherwise they
would not appear.
A totalitarian dictate against ads con
sidered in poor taste borders on telling
people what to think. The basic message
from such a statement would be, "The
consuming public is made up of a bunch
of sexists who have no right to respond
to this type of ad."
I really don't want to live in a society
in which I am told how I can respond to
external stimuli.
Just think, if Operation Rescue con
trolled The Daily we would not be able
to run ads from Planned Parenthood or
similar concerns, which members of that
organization would find highly offensive.
Anytime subjective criteria are intro
duced as prerequisites for freedom of ex
pression, the potential for abuse exists.
Any advocate who assumes that his or
her viewpoint should be actively enforced
doesn't appreciate the possibilities for
reverse enforcement.
1 would like to emphasize my belief
that sexism is a problem that needs to
be addressed. But to force sexism under
ground does not eliminate it.
