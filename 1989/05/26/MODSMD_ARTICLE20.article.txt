Stanford can learn
from those with far
harsher conditions
In nine years as an inmate of Cali
fornia prisons, from Soledad to San
Quentin, and the last five years at the
California Medical Facility, I have seen
far more examples of racial cohesive
ness and understanding than prejudice
and divisiveness. We are as ethnically
mixed a population as one could imag
ine, and we are not the brightest lot of
men on the planet, either.
Surprisingly, all things considered,
we get along very well. Some of us
mix, some stay to ourselves, and some
even run in gangs, but overall there is
peace.
When I watch the disturbances at
Stanford, I am puzzled. Don't we have
our milieus backwards? This is not a
huggy "love one another letter," but it
does suggest that even a population of
psychologically disturbed criminals can
learn to treat others with respect and
themselves with dignity.

Offensive flier not
indicative of most
members of GOP
We cannot agree more with Glen
Rosenbaum's response to a College
Republican flier which seemed to
ridicule Gay and Lesbian Awareness
Week's "Shorts Day." We would like to
make it clear that not all of Stanford
College Republicans' officers, ourselves
included, knew of the "Ride a bike . ..
support a Republican" flier.
As Mexican-American and Chinese-
American students, we especially be
lieve that prejudice of any nature

threatens the spirit of our democracy.
We sincerely hope that all people who
were offended by that insensitive flier
understand that such boorishness does
not and never will represent all Repub
licans.
Adhering to the philosophy that po
litical parties should represent differing
but constructive beliefs, and not ge
netic or cultural differences, President
Bush and other moderate Republicans
continue to work towards a more di
verse G.O.P. It disgusts us to see the
President's noble objectives com
promised by a few thoughtless individ
uals within his own party.
In support of freedom, we apologize
for those among us who cling to out
dated intolerance.

Meeting successful
thanks to students'
constructive input
Monday's meeting with student
leaders of the Agenda for Action and
minority student organizations was
extraordinarily productive. I credit that
particularly to the attitude and great
care with which the students undertook
their presentations.
All of us who listened were im
pressed by their expressions of deep
commitment to Stanford's welfare and
to helping make this an even better
University.
As to substance, we discussed a
number of main concerns and agreed
to resume that discussion shortly. No
formal agreements were possible within
the timeframe available, but my sense
is that constructive action is feasible
on a number of the issues. For our
part, I believe we were helpful in sug
gesting means for students to partici
pate in some of the interim steps that

will be critical in carrying decisions
forward.
This was the beginning — not the
finish — of a partnership between
students, administrators and faculty on
multicultural objectives that correspond
with those of the University Commit
tee on Minority Issues.
I believe we all left with a renewed
imperative to build consensus in this
community, as well as a renewed ap
preciation for the complexity of that
task.

Top officials ought
to take up cause of
civil liberties class
Front page stories in the May 23
Daily brought both good news and bad
news.
The good news was that the meeting
between students from the Agenda for
Action Coalition and University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy had gone well,
with commendable concentration on the
substance of the concerns raised by the
coalition last week rather than their
form (in contrast to most campus reac
tion).
The bad — and not unrelated —
news was that Jim Steyer's class,
"Civil Rights and Civil Liberties," had
been canceled "due to financial con
straints."
The fact that this was done despite
the course's focus on minority discrim
ination and gender issues, and despite
the evidence that it was popular with
students and well-taught, raises doubts
about some of the very issues students
are addressing: whether we are really
committed to strengthening the cover
age of minority and gender issues and
whether we really care about good
teaching and student input.
Part of the problem, of course, is
that while the University administra-

tion makes most of the verbal as
surance and promises with respect to
such issues, it is the individual depart
ments which make most of the relevant
decisions and take most of the relevant
actions.
I sincerely hope that the administra
tion, deploying the curriculum develop
ment and discretionary reserves which
Kennedy mentioned in his Academic
Council address last week, will be able
to assure the continuation of Steyer's
lecture course and to encourage all
departments to increase rather than
decrease their coverage of minority and
gender issues.
