Daily's Hud ad was
offensive since it
objectified women
We wish the May 18 full-page Bud
weiser advertisement in The Daily had
not appeared. Although the ad's osten
sible purpose is to promote sales of
Budweiser, an additional function it
has is that it makes us, and many
other Daily readers, angry.
Why are we angered? Because we
don't see the necessity of a connection
between selling beer and ogling women
Because we don't like the prevalence
and apparent acceptance of the practice
of using sexualized images of women
as "bait" to attract money.
That this ad literally objectifies
women is appalling. We don't expect to

change the world, but we expect The
Daily to show evidence of understand
ing what the woman'rfknvement has
strived for during the last century.
We thought that, at the very least,
the party-poster issue would have
taught you why it isn't good to use
sex to sell or to link sex with beer as
this ad so obviously does.
Some of us have seen re-prints of
this ad in graduate student offices. It
bothers us that students who need help
with their studies are helped by people
who feel that a Stanford office is an
appropriate place to display informa
tion about the kinds of female bodies
they like to look at.
When The Daily prints this ad or
others like it, The Daily helps foster
the attitude that postering such images
is acceptable.
We imagine that some Daily readers
were not bothered by this ad. We only
ask that you risk offending them by

omitting it, rather than offending us
and like-minded others by including it.
Consider it a favor, and we'll owe
you one. Heck, maybe we'll even buy
you a beer. A root beer.

Trudeau has more
going for him than
a liberal viewpoint
In a letter several weeks ago, Mike
Mueller suggested that no one has
questioned the choice of Gary Trudeau
for this year's commencement speaker
for fear that this would be construed
as close-mindedness.

Is it close-minded to believe that the
only people qualified to address us are
the likes of George Bush and Francois
Mitterand (or maybe Dan Quayle)?
Does being a popular comic strip
writer necessarily make someone
"lame"?
Mueller claims a Commencement
speaker should not make a political
statement, but does he really believe a
big-name politician will do anything
other than that? Finally, what evidence
does Mueller have that the Class of
1989 is waiting with indifference?
