## Zinfandel, mud baths, pinot noir and mineral jacuzzis California wine country provides ideal weekend escape 
### Mia Manzulli Senior staff writer 
A bottle of white zinfandel, a loaf of
French bread and a wedge of Brie do a
romantic picnic make. But, just don't
settle for a jaunt up to the Dish this
Memorial Day weekend when you could
be in the Napa Valley in about two hours.
California's wine country provides the
perfect backdrop for a simple picnic or
a relaxing weekend getaway. Hundreds
of wineries producing some of the world's
finest Chardonnay, Cabernet Sauvignon,
Merlot and Pinot Noir dot the area!
Charming bed and breakfast inns, spas
complete with mud baths and mineral
jacuzzis, and excellent restaurants make
Napa Valley a wonderful and accessible
destination for those needing to escape
academics, jobs or suburbia.
For many people, the wine is reason
enough to visit Napa. Not only can you
learn about the actual wine making proc
ess at one of many wineries, but you can
taste a wide variety of California wines
on the premises. The St. Helena Highway
(29) and the parallel Silverado Trail run
north/south through the 35-mile-long
Napa Valley and everywhere you look
along these two roads are vineyards and
wineries, many within walking or biking
distance of one another.
For a comprehensive tour, (a good idea
for newcomers) make your first stop at
the Robert Mondavi Winery in Oakville,
on the St. Helena Highway. Down the
road a few miles is the fairytale castle-like
Inglenook Vineyard Co. in Rutherford.
The European atmosphere might inspire
you to take another tour — they are
offered every hour on the hour until 4
p.m.
In the mood for tasting and eating?
Then head down Highway 29 to the Sut
ter Home Winery in St. Helena. Home
of the ever-popular White Zinfandel, Sut
ter Home offers a wide variety of wines,
and the tasting is free. You might want
to try some pretzels or crackers with
their special mustards or tomato sauces

— all made with Sutter Home wines.
One of the most beautiful wineries is
Chateau Montelena, located north of St.
Helena atop a hill in Calistoga. The Eu
ropean style castle is located on Tubbs
Lane off Highway 29. Tasting the fine
wines at Chateau Montelena is free. You
might want to wander around the exten
sive Japanese-style gardens that sur
round the winery or make reservations
for a picnic site — it's really a picturesque
spot.
There are two other wineries in Calis
toga worth a visit. Just south of Chateau
Montelena on Dunaweal Lane (accessible
from Highway 29 or the Silverado Trail)
are the Sterling Vineyards and Clos
Pegase.
At the end of a tree-lined drive a tram
waits to take passengers to the gothic
hilltop Sterling winery. There is a $5 fee

at Sterling, but the view of the Napa
Valley from the top is worth the price
of admission.
Clos Pegase is a stunning example of
post-modern architecture which stands
in stark contrast to the surrounding vine
yards. Designed by Michael Graves for a
design competition sponsored by the San
Francisco Museum of Modern Art, Clos
Pegas makes a unique architectural state
ment. Three dollars buys you a pretty
wine glass and lets you taste 'til your
heart's content. Check out the fine art
collection housed in Clos Pegas where
even wine labels are a work of art — one
Merlot label boasts a Picasso.
If champagne appeals to you more than
wine, then be sure to stop off at Domaine
Chandon, one of Napa's premier cham
pagne houses. Located on California
Drive, off Highway 29 in Rutherford,
Domaine Chandon offers an interesting
look at the champagne making process.
After a day of vigorous wine tasting,
you'll probably be weary and drowsy. So
what better way to unwind than with a
mud bath and a professional massage?
With its geysers, hot springs and lava
deposits, the small country town of Calis
toga is known for its mineral water (yes,
they bottle Calistogas here!) and mud
baths. Many of the resorts in this town
offer spa facilities and while you don't
need to be a registered guest, reservations
for the spa treatments are necessary.
One of the more modern spas is Le
Spa Francais on Lincoln Avenue, with its
healing atmosphere and New Age music.
Located behind the low motel units, the
spa is much nicer than you might judge
from the outside.
A variety of treatment packages are
available: You can mix and match mud
baths, mineral jacuzzis, salt scrub skin
glows . . . the list goes on. Or, for $40,
you can try the hour long "Mud Bath
Treatment" which includes a mud bath
(an incredibly odd sensation of being
suspended in mud!), a mineral jacuzzi, a
stay in the steam cabinet and a half-hour
massage.

Chances are, after a spa treatment
you'll be ready for a nice meal and a
good night's sleep. First things first.
There are a number of good restaurants
in Napa Valley for dinner.
In Calistoga, try Checkers, a cute and
inexpensive pizza and pasta place on Lin
coln Avenue that makes its own frozen
yogurt. Hack in St. Helena, the romantic
Tra Vigne (on 29) gets rave reviews for
its innovative cuisine at slightly higher
prices. And in Rutherford, stop in at
Mustard's Grill, the Napa Valley cousin
to San Francisco's Fog City Diner — lots
of fresh fish, interesting soups and great
shoestring onion rings.
Well-fed and comfortably sleepy from
Napa wine, the weary can head to one
of the many charming bed and breakfast
inns found in the valley.
In Yountville, is The Webber Place, a

red farmhouse built in the 1850s. Webber
Place is charmingly restored with beau
tiful quilts and antiques in each of the
four guest rooms. A double with a shared
bath (no shower) is $69 or $79 for one
night. Lodgings include wine and home
baked goodies on arrival as well as a
huge (and delicious) homemade breakfast
in the downstairs dining room with other
guests. The biscuits with jam are exqui
site!
In Calistoga, two inexpensive options
are a Comfort Inn and the Calistoga Inn,
where doubles with shared baths and a
continental breakfast are only $40 a
night. Although the atmosphere of a bed
and breakfast is missing, these alterna
tives are affordable getaways.
For those in need of a real retreat,
head to the very private Scarlett's Coun
try Inn. Slightly off the beaten track in
the countryside of Calistoga, Scarlett's is
on Bale Lane off the Silverado Trail. You
can relax by the pool, pick fresh fruit
from the trees or sip wine in your room.
The Arrowhead Room, a double, goes for
$85. Scarlett herself brings breakfast to
you in your room, outside on a patio or
in the family dining room.
Refreshed from a good night's sleep in
the country air, you're ready once again
to head back to real life. Before you pack
up and leave, why not take a hot air
balloon or glider ride above the Napa
Valley?
At the Calistoga Soaring Center, 20
minute glider rides are a popular attrac
tion. And Once in a Lifetime Balloon
Rides takes off from the Hans Kornell
Champagne Cellars in St. Helena. High
above the vineyards, you'll get a spectac
ular view and have ample opportunity to
wave farewell to the beautiful wine coun
try spread out below.
To get to Napa Valley, take 101 North
through San Francisco and into Marin
County. Pass San Rafael and get on High
way 37. Take 37 to Highway 121 which
goes into Sonoma. 121 becomes Highway
12. From 12 go to 29 North which runs
directly through Napa Valley.
