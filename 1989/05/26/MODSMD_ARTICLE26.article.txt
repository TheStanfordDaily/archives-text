# Bug digs for life's answers up the noses of the world
## 
### Mark Smoyer Senior staff writer 
Now more than ever before,
Stanford students are committed
to carrying out an agenda of
awareness and are forcing the
community to face up to the
reality of this troubled planet.
Always one to jump on the
bandwagon, the Bug this week ex
amines an issue which effects each
and every American whether he
or she acknowledges it or not.
That's right, my craven underl
ings, it's time to talk about
boogies.
Dear Bug,
What are "boogers" made of,
and are they the same as what
you cough up when you have a

cold (They taste the same!)?
— Jimmy Durante
Back in those special "Welcome
Back, Kotter" years, the most
common come-back was "Up your
nose with a rubber hose." And,
of course, there was the corollary:
"Up your nose where the green
grass grows." Then again, there
were "Happy Days" losers who
just said, "Sit on it."
However, boogers (or boogies or
snot or boogersnot) are not green
grass. But everybody has 'em,
even Vinnie Barbarino, and so Dr.
Gene Phillips of Cowell Student
Health Center understood the im
portance of my question when I
contacted him.
"When one is sick, and then of
course is coughing up stuff, like
colored mucus, that is indeed in-

fected mucus," Phillips said. "And
one can have the same sort of
thing from the nose when there
is an infection in the nose or in
the sinuses. What that is actually
that collects in the nose periodi
cally — 1 never thought of the
question frankly."
Phillips went on to say, "The
nose acts as a filtering system
and (snot) is just dirt and other
pollutants in the air that are
trapped by that normal mucus."
And then, a startling revelation:
"I've never heard of [a technical
name for it] and the word,
boogers, I've never seen in a med
ical text."
Although it has been neglected
by the medical community,
boogersnot does have a celebrated
spot in our society, particularly
as a part of one's body which can

be removed and eaten.
Indeed, from important roles in
two landmark American films,
"Caddyshack" and "Willy Wonka
and the Chocolate Factory," to
convivial cafeteria conversation in
elementary school, nose-picking is
a compelling topic and, with the
fading of baseball's popularity, the
Great American Pastime.
But, of course! Ask yourself
these revealing questions:
• What's more pleasant than
pulling up at a stoplight and
watching the guy in the car next
to you dig in?
• Where is the conflict between
primal desire and constricting
consciousness better epitomized
than in the decision to pick or
not to pick in a public area?
• How can the frustration of a
man or woman's thirsty soul

by the chains of civilization
De better exemplified than by the
struggle to flick a sticky little snot
off the end of one's finger?
And there is, always, the ques
tion of etiquette. Here, then, is
The Bug's Brief Book of Boogie
Etiquette.
I)There are only two acceptable
pickin' tools: the finger and the
eyeglass stem (No coke spoons,
please!). Small build-up near the
nostril may be removed with the
knuckle or the pinch-'n-roll meth
od.
2)Always check for evasive
boogers (a.k.a. "boogers incon
nu") which may locate on the
cheek or the upper lip.
3)The Copenhagen method
("Just a pinch between the cheek
and gum for long-lasting plea
sure") is prohibited.
