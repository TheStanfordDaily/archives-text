## O'Brien-Tarango team wins, faces test today 
### Cameron Macky Senior staff writer 
No doubles team has figured
out a way to beat Stanford's Alex
O'Brien and Jeff Tarango this
season, but Tim Donovan and
Mircea Morairu of Brown still
gave it their best shot yesterday.
Unfortunately for them, that
shot — along with most of their
volleys and a large portion of their
forehands and backhands —

ended up in the net, as O'Brien
and Tarango romped, 6-3, 6-2.
The 75-minute win put the Car
dinal pair in the second round of
the NCAA doubles tournament.
They will face UCLA's Billy Bar
ber and Mark Quinney, the Pacific
10 Conference champions, today
at noon.
"They were just doing what
they've done all season long,"
Stanford Asst. Coach John Whit
linger said. "They hit some good

returns and played a few loose
games."
"We didn't have that many
problems today," O'Brien said. To
say the least. The Brown pair
broke serve once in each set, but
wasn't exactly overpowering when
the Cardinal was receiving.
The first break was partly a
gift — Tarango double-faulted on
break point in the match's fifth
game to let the Brown pair pull
to 3-2. Morairu held serve to tie

the score.
O'Brien held, and then Donovan
put the Cardinal tandem up 5-3
when he sent two volleys into the
net. Tarango then served a game
at love, acing Morairu on set
point.
In the second, Donovan missed
a volley to give the Cardinal a
break and a 2-1 lead. In the next
game, Tarango was serving with
a 2-1 point advantage when he
missed a volley wide to the left.
The reason? "Bug in the ear!" he
yelled.
"Now I've heard it all," Whit
linger said. Tarango got 10 points
for originality, but no more points
in the game, as Donovan smashed
a crosscourt backhand for the
break.
O'Brien and Tarango got the
break right back on a beauty of
a forehand cross by Tarango, and
that was that. O'Brien served a
love game, and Donovan missed
three volleys for another break,
giving Tarango the chance to
serve out the match.
With the score 2-1, Morairu
mishit a service return, turning
it into an impromptu moonball.
Tarango raced back to return the
sort-of-intentional lob, but his
answering lob landed wide.
"I have to say that was an in
teresting return," Tarango said.
"I'm working on it," Morairu
replied. He's got all summer to
do so. Tarango fired an ace past
Donovan, and then Morairu hit a
return long on match point.
Card notes
Jim Hodges, who played on Stan
ford's national championship teams
of 1977, 1978 and 1980, was on hand
to watch Tarango and O'Brien play

'They were just
doing what they've
done all season
long. They hit
some good returns
and played a few
loose games.'

yesterday. Now a pilot for Delta Air
lines, Hodges asked O'Brien, a Texas
native, the question of the year: "Alex,
how the hell did you learn to play
tennis in Amarillo?"
For trivia buffs, the runway at the
Amarillo airport is tres long at 13,500
ft. No one knows why.
From the Athens Guide to Fine
Dining: Watch your step when eating
at The Varsity. "The food is fine when
you're eating it,"says Tarango, "but
then an hour later, ..." You get the
picture. The chocolate shakes get a
thumbs up, though.
One of the local sights highlighted
in "Let's Go: Athens" is a double
barreled cannon located outside City
Hall. The cannon was designed during
the Civil War to simultaneously fire
two cannonballs connected by a chain
"in order to cut through the enemy
like a scythe."
The cannon failed to catch on be
cause its brilliant inventors couldn't
make a firing mechanism that could
fire the two balls at the same time.
There's a lesson here somewhere, but
it has temporarily escaped the
chronicler's mind.
You know you're in a small town
when the parking meters say "Nickels
and pennies only, please."

The tandem of Jeff Tcrango and Alex O'Brien cruised through their opening-round match against
Brown's Tim Dononvan and Mircea Morairu, winning 6-3, 6-2.
No doubles team has figured
out a way to beat Stanford's Alex
O'Brien and Jeff Tarango this
season, but Tim Donovan and
Mircea Morairu of Brown still
gave it their best shot yesterday.
Unfortunately for them, that
shot — along with most of their
volleys and a large portion of their
forehands and backhands —

ended up in the net, as O'Brien
and Tarango romped, 6-3, 6-2.
The 75-minute win put the Car
dinal pair in the second round of
the NCAA doubles tournament.
They will face UCLA's Billy Bar
ber and Mark Quinney, the Pacific
10 Conference champions, today
at noon.
"They were just doing what
they've done all season long,"
Stanford Asst. Coach John Whit
linger said. "They hit some good

returns and played a few loose
games."
"We didn't have that many
problems today," O'Brien said. To
say the least. The Brown pair
broke serve once in each set, but
wasn't exactly overpowering when
the Cardinal was receiving.
The first break was partly a
gift — Tarango double-faulted on
break point in the match's fifth
game to let the Brown pair pull
to 3-2. Morairu held serve to tie

the score.
O'Brien held, and then Donovan
put the Cardinal tandem up 5-3
when he sent two volleys into the
net. Tarango then served a game
at love, acing Morairu on set
point.
In the second, Donovan missed
a volley to give the Cardinal a
break and a 2-1 lead. In the next
game, Tarango was serving with
a 2-1 point advantage when he
missed a volley wide to the left.
The reason? "Bug in the ear!" he
yelled.
"Now I've heard it all," Whit
linger said. Tarango got 10 points
for originality, but no more points
in the game, as Donovan smashed
a crosscourt backhand for the
break.
O'Brien and Tarango got the
break right back on a beauty of
a forehand cross by Tarango, and
that was that. O'Brien served a
love game, and Donovan missed
three volleys for another break,
giving Tarango the chance to
serve out the match.
With the score 2-1, Morairu
mishit a service return, turning
it into an impromptu moonball.
Tarango raced back to return the
sort-of-intentional lob, but his
answering lob landed wide.
"I have to say that was an in
teresting return," Tarango said.
"I'm working on it," Morairu
replied. He's got all summer to
do so. Tarango fired an ace past
Donovan, and then Morairu hit a
return long on match point.
Card notes
Jim Hodges, who played on Stan
ford's national championship teams
of 1977, 1978 and 1980, was on hand
to watch Tarango and O'Brien play

'They were just
doing what they've
done all season
long. They hit
some good returns
and played a few
loose games.'

yesterday. Now a pilot for Delta Air
lines, Hodges asked O'Brien, a Texas
native, the question of the year: "Alex,
how the hell did you learn to play
tennis in Amarillo?"
For trivia buffs, the runway at the
Amarillo airport is tres long at 13,500
ft. No one knows why.
