# Golfers tied for 6th after first round
## 
### David Hirning Staff writer 
Brad Benbrook of the
Stanford men's golf team
once quoted legendary pro
golfer Sam Snead: "Never
bet on a sick man, because
he has too many other
things to do besides work
on his golf swing."
Benbrook took that motto
to heart yesterday, as he
fought off a bad case of
stomach flu to lead his team
with a two-under-par 69.
The Cardinal didn't have
any player card higher than
a 74 and cruised into a tie
for sixth after one round at
the NCAA regionals in El
Paso, Tex.
"I couldn't really worry
about each shot," Benbrook
said. "I was just trying to
stand up out there."
Freshman All-America
candidate Christian Cevaer
had what can be considered
an off day for him, firing a
73 on the afternoon. But his
score did not indicate how
well he played. His prob
lems, in fact, were very
similar to those suffered by
the Cardinal women at their
NCAA tournament.
"Christian really played
well," Stanford Coach Wally
Goodwin said. "He just
couldn't make a putt. He
had about five or six chances at
birdie. ... He finished with 16
pars and two bogeys for a 73."
Stanford junior Mark Funseth
followed Cevaer's lead with a 73,
while Brad Geer and Don Chris
tensen both made the tour in 74.
Stanford stands 13 shots out of
the lead after shooting a 289 in
the first of three rounds at the
El Paso Country Club. Washing
ton and UCLA matched the Car
dinal with identical marks, while
USC leads the field with a slightly
unreal 273.
Host team UTEP, termed a
shoe-in by Christensen before the
tournament, struggled and
finished the day in 13th.
Benbrook, unlike Cevaer, had
no problems with his short game.
He called it"the best chipping
round of my career." The problem
instead seemed to be the elevation
and dry atmosphere, which al
lowed the ball to carry too far.
"I missed eight greens," he said,
"but 1 got up and down each time.
It was a fitting end to the round
that I chipped in from the sand

on 18."
Benbrook has to find the round
especially satisfying, after fight
ing simply for a spot on the team
all year long. He was determined
to make this trip, however.
"I told Wally two weeks ago I
was going on this trip whether I
had to qualify or not," the junior
from Chesterfield, Mo. said. "I'm
not usually like that — bragging
— but I've been thinking about
NCAAs for three years, and I
wasn't going to blow it."
As it turned out, a qualifier was
avoided when junior Josh Zander
decided he was not playing NCAA
caliber golf and withdrew. That
left Benbrook time to work a lot
on his chipping and putting.
It paid ofT, and put Stanford in
a position to reserve a berth in
the NCAA finals if it can avoid
the patented middle-round col
lapse. "Our problem all year has
been consistency — we have one
bad round every tournament,"
said Benbrook. "We're definitely
golfing well, we just need two
more rounds like this."
To qualify, Stanford needs only
to finish in the top nine of the
17 teams. Goodwin cautioned that
his team is not there yet, however.
