# Charges negligence, cover-up
## Student files suit for health injury 
### Brad Hayward Senior staff writer 
A Stanford postdoctoral stu
dent, claiming he has sustained
serious health problems because
of University negligence and
cover-up, has filed a legal suit

International.
In a complaint filed yesterday

Wisner allege that Wisner has suf

Quadrangle.

that SRI, a Menlo Park consulting
firm, "falsely published and
publicly disseminated a report
[last year] . . . indicating that
there was 'no clear and present
danger' at the facilities in which
the plaintiff worked."

The suit charges Stanford and
SRI with negligence, fraudulent
misrepresentation, fraudulent
concealment and conspiracy,

Assoc. Staff Counsel Debra
Zumwalt, in a statement released
late yesterday, said the University
legal office had not yet seen the
complaint. But Zumwalt added,
"So far, we are unable to verify
that conditions at Stanford were
the cause of [Wisner's] problems."
Acting Director of Health and
Safety Ralph Buchanan is out of
town and could not be reached
for comment yesterday.
Wisner, a postdoctoral student
in chemistry, came to Stanford in
January 1987 and began research
"involving the use of exotic and
highly toxic chemicals and hazar
dous biological agents," according
to the complaint.
Wisner worked in Stauffer
Building 11, a facility in which
