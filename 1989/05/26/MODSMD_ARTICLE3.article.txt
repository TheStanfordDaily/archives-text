# Charges negligence, cover-up
## Student files suit for health injury 
### Brad Hayward Senior staff writer 
A Stanford postdoctoral stu
dent, claiming he has sustained
serious health problems because
of University negligence and
cover-up, has filed a legal suit
against the University and SRI
International.
In a complaint filed yesterday
in the Santa Clara County Supe
rior Court, attorneys for Daniel
Wisner allege that Wisner has suf
fered nose, throat, lung and
gastrointestinal damage as a
result of exposure to toxic chemi
cals in the Biology-Chemistry
Quadrangle.
The complaint further alleges
that both defendants "concealed
and misrepresented data" and
that SRI, a Menlo Park consulting
firm, "falsely published and
publicly disseminated a report
[last year] . . . indicating that
there was 'no clear and present
danger' at the facilities in which
the plaintiff worked."

The suit charges Stanford and
SRI with negligence, fraudulent
misrepresentation, fraudulent
concealment and conspiracy,
among other things.
Assoc. Staff Counsel Debra
Zumwalt, in a statement released
late yesterday, said the University
legal office had not yet seen the
complaint. But Zumwalt added,
"So far, we are unable to verify
that conditions at Stanford were
the cause of [Wisner's] problems."
Acting Director of Health and
Safety Ralph Buchanan is out of
town and could not be reached
for comment yesterday.
Wisner, a postdoctoral student
in chemistry, came to Stanford in
January 1987 and began research
"involving the use of exotic and
highly toxic chemicals and hazar
dous biological agents," according
to the complaint.
Wisner worked in Stauffer
Building 11, a facility in which
health and safety hazards have
been diagnosed many times, at
least as far back as 1972.
According to Wisner's attorney
John Shaffer, Wisner began dis
playing significant symptoms of
health problems in the fall of last
year.
Wisner told The Daily yesterday
that these symptoms included
bleeding in the throat and nose
and breathing difficulty.
"My sickness always developed
after I went to the lab," Wisner
said. "The relationship got pretty
clear."
Wisner was diagnosed to have
a fungal infection of Candida al
bicans. This organism is very
common and "is all around us,"
according to Edward Shortliffe,
associate professor of general in
ternal medicine.

The fungus can become an in
fection in people who are immune
suppressed through diseases such
as diabetes, Shortliffe said.
Wisner's research was moved
from Stauffer to the Keck Science
Building, where he has not expe
rienced the same problems.
But the infection, which af
fected Wisner's nose, throat,
lungs and gastrointestinal system,
still plagues him; he continues to
take antifungal medication.
Wisner's adviser, Chemistry
Prof. Harden McConnell, said he
knew Wisner was "unwell" but
never discussed the problem with
him.
"My loyalties are with the Uni
versity until I am told otherwise,"
McConnell said yesterday.
Shaffer said Wisner's infection
was likely a result of exposure to
several problems in the Stauffer
building.
One source •of the infection,
Shaffer said, was a chemical spill

in a refrigerator located in the
lab where Wisner worked. Shaffer
said University officials maintain
that the spill occurred in March
1986, and documents do reveal
that such an event occurred at
that time.
Wisner said he thought the spill
occurred only "one or two
months" before he arrived at the
lab in January 1987.
Shaffer said the effect of the
chemical spill was probably "ag
gravated and exacerbated" by
Wisner's exposure to other toxic
chemicals used in the lab. In ad
dition, he said "there is no ques
tion in my mind" that Wisner's
infection was related to problems
of re-entrainment in the area.
Re-entrainment is a condition
in which potentially dangerous
fumes emitted from a building are
filtered back into it or others
nearby. A study released by the
University last Friday indicated
that toxic emissions in the

Biology-Chemistry Quad are well
below required levels, but Shaffer
and others in the Stanford com
munity have questioned the meth
ods and completeness of the study.
SRI is named in the suit be
cause of a separate study it con
ducted last year that found no
significant health and safety dan
gers in the buildings it studied —
including Stauffer.
The complaint alleges that SRI
"failed to discover, publish and
reveal data available to it, or
which should have been available
to it, regarding the seriousness of
the hazards it found." It claims
further that SRI "participated
with Stanford in an intentional
effort to cover up and mis
represent the true nature and ex
tent of the health hazards."
Though the SRI study found
"no clear and present danger," the
report itself notes that informa
tion on Stauffer was gained from
six interviews and a walk-through

audit.
"The purpose of the walk
through was not to conduct a
health and safety inspection, but
U» arrive at a general overview of
tne building," the SRI report read.
Wisner added that when his
symptoms appeared he got little
help from the Cowell Student
Health Center and the Depart
ment of Health and Safety.
"[Cowell physicians] weren't
very responsive to me," Wisner
said. "I didn't think death was
upon me, but I felt it was an
emergency. They told me I was
having a panic attack or some
thing like that. I felt very trapped,
but they wouldn't give me any
types of referrals to a specialist."
Cowell officials could not be
reached for comment last night.
Wisner added that though he
brought his health problems to
the attention of Health and Safety
officials in December 1988, they
did not respond until March of

this year.
Zumwalt's statement said that,
during that time, the refrigerator
in which the spill occurred was
tested by an independent agency.
"No traces of the chemical were
found," the statement said.
Shaffer said, however, that the
refrigerator was washed with an
ammonia solution before the test
was performed — which would
eliminate traces of the chemical.
"I was extremely reluctant to
do this (sue the University)," Wis
ner said. "I am afraid Stanford is
not very enlightened about health
and safety. It is highly unlikely
that I would be in this situation
if Stanford was just a little con
cerned for my situation."
The suit asks an unspecified
amount for medical expenses, loss
of earnings and punitive damages,
among others.
