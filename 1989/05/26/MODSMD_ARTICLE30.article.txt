The atmosphere at the Stanford Golf
Course this week has been no dif
ferent than any other week. Over
100 golfers have taken the course each day,
looking for the elusive sub-par round. The
sky is blue, the grass is green and the
people are pleasant.
Just like any other week . . . except for
the fact that the national championship in
women's collegiate golf will be awarded
tomorrow after four grueling days of play
at the same course where tranquility has
reigned supreme.
It's all quite strange. Imagine Glen Rice
at the men's basketball Final Four waltzing
over to the opposing bench and casually
chatting with P.J. Carlesimo before the
opening whistle of the title game. Fven
more unlikely, picture Mike Tyson strolling
to Michael Spinks corner and apologizing
for pummeling him so badly.

It just doesn't work that way, but the
NCAA golf field has rewritten the rules of
sports etiquette. Sure, team loyalty is still
manifest, but the camaraderie is shared
with friends regardless of what team they
play for, regardless of what color golf bag
they carry or what uniform they wear.
After a weekend at the Pacific 10 Con
ference Track and Field Championships,
where sour faces apparently lowered the
qualifying standards, the congenial compe
tition at the NCAA Golf Championships is
refreshing and invigorating.
The first two days of competition, how
ever, have been far from placid.
Defending NCAA champion Tulsa
and San Jose State's Pat Hurst have ripped
up the Stanford Golf Course more
thoroughly than a runaway bulldo7.er.
Led by Cathy Mockett, who is one stroke
behind Hurst entering today's round, the
Golden Hurricane has blown through the
site of Tulsa's first NCAA championship
— the first ever awarded, in 1982 — with
low scores across the board. Tulsa is so
consistent that the team threw out a <9
on Wednesday as its high score.
Hurst, ranked third in the final NCAA
computer poll, has surprised everyone with
her four-under-par two-day performance.
Common knowledge predicted a dual for
the individual title between Texas' Michiko
Hattori and Arizona State's Pearl Sinn —
the top two collegians and international
amateurs — yet Hurst, with her knowledge
of the local Stanford course, has quietly
surpassed both.
Her team has also emerged as a quiet
favorite. The Spartans posted the low
round yesterday and similar performances
may whittle away Tulsa's nine-stroke ad
vantage.
As for Stanford, the young Cardinal is
holding steady at eighth place, just a solid

round away from top-five status. A national
title may not be in the cards (inane pun
unintended), but a respectable finish seems
guaranteed.
With the exception of Jodi Figley's blis
tering even-par 73 Wednesday, none of
Stanford's golfers has had an exceptional
day. With some weU-placed shots, keener
putting and more thnrt a modicum of luck,
the Cardinal could exploit its home-course
edge and vault up the leader board.
Putting has progrn to be the most
important facotll not only for Stan
ford but for ever*y team in contention.
The greens on the course are virtually im
possible to navigate, as evidenced by the
frequency of three-putts tournament wide.
The trouble falls into two categories: con
dition and design. Thanks to the warm
winds early in the week, the greens are
hard and, consequently, fast.
Making the players' lives even more
stressful is the befuddling topography of
each green. Stanford Coach Tim Baldwin
calls them "undulating," but that is an
articulate understatement.
The greens here defy the laws of physics.
A ball heading upwards will suddenly ac
celerate exactly where it should halt,
thanks to imperceptible dips and valleys.
A five-foot putt may have to travel around
a seven- or eight-foot arc in order to reach
the hole. Pretty weird.
The result is that many players, even
after two practice rounds and two days of
competition, are still befuddled. Only Mock
ett and Hurst have remained consistently
solid, but each has saved many strokes due
to bullseye approach shots.
Putting will win this tournament. Period.
End of item.
Along with ambiance and excitement,
the NCAA tournament has produced
its share of anecdotes. Two human
interest items in particular deem mention.
The first is the Hattori fan club, which
is perhaps the largest in the world. It's
membership: the population of Japan.
It seems that Hattori is a national hero
in her native land. As a result, five separate
televsion stations and several newspapers
have sent cameramen and journalists to
cover the tournament.
Actually, they only cover her. Closely.
Every step she takes is recorded by at least
one of the cameras, usually several, as the
entourage of 20 trails her down the fair
ways.
It's quite a spectacle that should be seen.
The other item of interest: the Wooding
sisters, Audrey and Michelle. Playing for
different schools — Michelle is a senior at
New Mexico, Audrey a freshman at Stan
ford — have infused the tournament with
a needed touch of zaniness.
Examples will speak louder than words,
so here are a few:
• Yesterday, Audrey strolled around with
a small rose stuck to the top of her hair.
• Michelle has become a mainstay at the
18th green, invoking laughter with most
every comment. I don't remember any
remark in particular, but I do remember
much revelry.
The list is sadly incomplete, but the
image is clear enough. Personifying the
entire tournament, the Woodings have com
bined fun with competition, making the
event that much more rewarding.
That completes our broadcast day.
