# Ultimate team looks for second title
## 
### Debbie Rubenstein Senior staff writer 
Memorial Day weekend may include
an hour or two of frisbee throwing
on the beach for some Stanford stu
dents, but that's almost all the Stan
ford Men's Ultimate Frisbee Team will
be doing this weekend at the National
Collegiate Ultimate Championships,
organized by the Ultimate Players As
sociation.
Seeded first in this weekend's tour
nament in Wilmington, N.C., Stanford
won the West Coast Regional Ultimate
Tournament two weekends ago at San
Jose State, upsetting California and
UC-Santa Barbara, the Nos. 1 and 2
seeds. This is Stanford's fifth appear
ance since 1984, the first year of the
national championship. The team has
made it to the finals two of those
years, and won it all once.
Depsite Stanford's dominance of the
West Coast region, this year's team
is happy just to have qualified for
nationals.
"This year we had only eight re
turning players, about half the team.
Placing third in this year's regional
tournament would have marked a suc
cessful season," said graduating senior
and former captain Keith Sarkisian.
Stanford's secret weapon during
this year's regional tournament was
the wind, which was ironically the
source of the team's demise last year
at nationals when it lost unexpectedly
in the semifinals to Texas.
"We worked hard on improving our
zone Idefense] this year," said gradu
ating senior and co-captain David
Lipscomb. "We learned a lesson from
last year. [The zonel works well
against collegiate teams that don't
have a lot of experience."
It is much easier to score downwind
than upwind, Lipscomb expained. It
takes at least five forward throws and

what we were supposed
to do last year. 1

generally at least 25 throws total to
score upwind, while in a strong wind
going downwind, one throw could
reach the end zone. An ultimate fris
bee field is 70 yards by 40 yards with
end zones 25-yards deep.
"Most teams don't have patience
against our zone," Sarkisian ex
plained. Most of the time, defense in
ultimate frisbee is played man-to
man. "And if [a team does have the
patiencel, we just switch to our second
zone. We are the only team in the
West that has two zones."
Lipscomb said a crucial reason be
hind the team's surprising late season
success is the addition of six "more
promising rookies than expected."
At the beginning of the year, the
Stanford team had no depth. Although
only seven players are allowed on the
field at a time, about 16 are usually
necessary to play an effective game.
A player must start to run after he
or she passes the disc because anyone
is elegible to receive the disc at
anytime. The game is one ongoing
play, with only injury substitutions
allowed, until a point is scored.
Rookies Wren Wescoatt and Allan
Padgett, both juniors and former com
petitive runners, are two valuable ad
ditions to the team, Lipscomb said.
To have an effective scoring drive,
speed is necessary for the "deeps,"
who play down by the end zone. And
although only his first year on the
team, sophomore Mike Novotny, a
former water polo player here, "can
play defense on anyone," he added.
But the team would have been lost

without its veterans, most of them in
their final collegiate season. "Hand
ler" Heyward Robinson, a graduate
studem, in material science, is "the
experience that guides the team," ac
cording to Sarkisian.
Handlers act as quarterbacks and
weave the frisbee down the field until
they find an open player in the end
zone. Robinson is also a member of
the current national champion ultim
ate team in the UPA's open division,
South Bay Tsunami.
Other solid returning handlers in
clude graduating seniors Sarkisian,
Will Debello and co-captain Wes San
ford, and junior Dan Harrington.
Patience was key in the young
team's success, Lipscomb explained.
The fall was designated to working
on fundamentals with the new players.
It was an unusual season from the
start in that rookies were playing with
the A Team from day one.
During the winter the team entered
several open tournaments to gain ex
perience for the rookies, which cul
minated in the team's first tourna
ment victory at Stanford's own tour
nament. "This was the first time we
realized we could beat any team in
the West," Lipscomb said.
Stanford's stiffest competition this
weekend will include State University
of New York-Purchase, Columbia,
Penn, Indiana, Texas and Santa Bar
bara, last year's champion who also
upset California this year and placed
second at the West Coast regional
tournament.
The top-two teams from each divi
sion qualify for nationals, and based
on past performance, two regions can
enter a third team to the national
tournament.
"We're going to do what we were
supposed to do last year," Sarkisian
said.
