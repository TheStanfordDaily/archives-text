# Linksters hold eighth after second round
## 
### David Hirning Staff writer 
After a first-round score of 310
put the Stanford women's golf
team in eighth place yesterday,
the Cardinal needed an eye
opening second round to serve
notice that it was ready to contend
for its first NCAA championship.
The team didn't get it. A dis
appointing home stretch by two
Stanford players turned great
rounds into good ones, and the
resulting 309 left the Cardinal in
eighth place for the second day
in a row at the NCAA Champi
onships, being held at the Stan
ford Golf Course.
While the Cardinal hasn't gone
under yet, it will be hard pressed
to catch Tulsa, which extended its
lead to nine shots over the nearest
competitor. San Jose State, led by
tournament front-runner Pat
Hurst, vaulted into second with
a 296, the low score of the day.
"To stay competitive in this
field, you need strong perform
ances by your Nos. 1 and 2
players," Stanford Coach Tim
Baldwin said. "San Jose State has
a golfer who's really hot — it's a
big difference."
Baldwin was referring to the
ups and downs of his two standout
women, freshman Adele Moore
and sophomore Jodi Figley. Moore
had trouble with her swing Wed
nesday and shot an 81 while
Figley shot a 73. Yesterday, Figley
saw her game go awry with the
81 while Moore dropped five
strokes on her total.
"Today I felt more pressure to
play well," said Figley, who was

tied for third after the first round.
"I was nervous, but I parred the
first three holes and I relaxed. I
guess I should have stayed ner
vous."
Moore denied any nervousness
in the first two NCAA rounds of
her career. "I just didn't play
well," she said. "Yesterday I
couldn't hit much of anything,
and today I was getting a lot of
weird shots with my driver. I
couldn't put two shots together."
Overall, the scores dropped a
bit in the 17-team field, with a
few exceptions. New Mexico State
and San Jose State showed the
most improvement, shaving 15
and 12 strokes off Wednesday's
respective totals. Highly-regarded
USC and Texas continued to wal
low on the bottom of the board,
and Florida seemed to lose its hold
on the course and went from 300
to 311.
Individually for Stanford, it was
a tear-jerker ending as both
Audrey Wooding and Stephanie
Parel let their games unravel late
in the round. Wooding needed a
birdie on 18 for a par round, but
instead double-bogeyed to finish
with 76. Parel had a one-over 37
on the front nine, but bogeyed
three of the last four holes and
turned in a 78.
"I felt really good," said fresh
man Wooding, who again had little
to show for a great round of golf.
Yesterday it was a 10 on the
fourth hole that proved her
downfall. "I concentrated harder,
and I played well. I just couldn't

bring it in."
On the other hand, Moore was
a model of consistency after early
trouble, parring every hole from
seven on. Stephanie Davis contin
ued to have putting problems, and
golfed much better than her 79.
"I two-putted 16 out of 18 holes
. . . kind of frustrating," she said.
"Nothing would fall in. I've been
able to rely on my putting all my
life. . . . Right now, I just want to
get revenge on the course."
According to Baldwin, the third
round will be pivotal if Stanford
is to make a run at the leaders.
"We're playing at the 70 percent
level. The girls know that they're
going to have to come out here
and play like hell [on Friday]. The
shadowboxing is over. We've got
to go after it tomorrow and really
play. We haven't played yet."
But he didn't count his team
out quite yet, with 36 holes still
to play. "We're on the verge. You
know, today we could've very
easily been six or seven shots
lower. Hopefully we'll get more
efficient."

to go after it tomorrow and really
play. We haven't played yet."
But he didn't count his team
out quite yet, with 36 holes still

know, today we could've very

After a first-round score of 310
put the Stanford women's golf
team in eighth place yesterday,
the Cardinal needed an eye
opening second round to serve
notice that it was ready to contend
for its first NCAA championship.
The team didn't get it. A dis
appointing home stretch by two
Stanford players turned great
rounds into good ones, and the
resulting 309 left the Cardinal in
eighth place for the second day
in a row at the NCAA Champi
onships, being held at the Stan
ford Golf Course.
While the Cardinal hasn't gone
under yet, it will be hard pressed
to catch Tulsa, which extended its
lead to nine shots over the nearest
competitor. San Jose State, led by
tournament front-runner Pat
Hurst, vaulted into second with
a 296, the low score of the day.
"To stay competitive in this
field, you need strong perform
ances by your Nos. 1 and 2
players," Stanford Coach Tim
Baldwin said. "San Jose State has
a golfer who's really hot — it's a
big difference."
Baldwin was referring to the
ups and downs of his two standout
women, freshman Adele Moore
and sophomore Jodi Figley. Moore
had trouble with her swing Wed
nesday and shot an 81 while
Figley shot a 73. Yesterday, Figley
saw her game go awry with the
81 while Moore dropped five
strokes on her total.
"Today I felt more pressure to
play well," said Figley, who was

tied for third after the first round.
"I was nervous, but I parred the
first three holes and I relaxed. I
guess I should have stayed ner
vous."
Moore denied any nervousness
in the first two NCAA rounds of
her career. "I just didn't play
well," she said. "Yesterday I
couldn't hit much of anything,
and today I was getting a lot of
weird shots with my driver. I
couldn't put two shots together."
Overall, the scores dropped a
bit in the 17-team field, with a
few exceptions. New Mexico State
and San Jose State showed the
most improvement, shaving 15
and 12 strokes off Wednesday's
respective totals. Highly-regarded
USC and Texas continued to wal
low on the bottom of the board,
and Florida seemed to lose its hold
on the course and went from 300
to 311.
Individually for Stanford, it was
a tear-jerker ending as both
Audrey Wooding and Stephanie
Parel let their games unravel late
in the round. Wooding needed a
birdie on 18 for a par round, but
instead double-bogeyed to finish
with 76. Parel had a one-over 37
on the front nine, but bogeyed
three of the last four holes and
turned in a 78.
"I felt really good," said fresh
man Wooding, who again had little
to show for a great round of golf.
Yesterday it was a 10 on the
fourth hole that proved her
downfall. "I concentrated harder,
and I played well. I just couldn't

bring it in."
On the other hand, Moore was
a model of consistency after early
trouble, parring every hole from
seven on. Stephanie Davis contin
ued to have putting problems, and
golfed much better than her 79.
"I two-putted 16 out of 18 holes
. . . kind of frustrating," she said.
"Nothing would fall in. I've been
able to rely on my putting all my
life. . . . Right now, I just want to
get revenge on the course."
According to Baldwin, the third
round will be pivotal if Stanford
is to make a run at the leaders.
"We're playing at the 70 percent
level. The girls know that they're
going to have to come out here
and play like hell [on Friday]. The
shadowboxing is over. We've got
to go after it tomorrow and really
play. We haven't played yet."
But he didn't count his team
out quite yet, with 36 holes still
to play. "We're on the verge. You
know, today we could've very
easily been six or seven shots
lower. Hopefully we'll get more
efficient."
