# Long-jumper Hickerson reaches for NCAA bid
## 
### Greg Gottesman Staff writer 
Sophomore Marcus Hickerson
has just about everything an
NCAA championship caliber
long jumper needs.
He has the confidence, the de
termination, the self-assured —
some might even say cocky —
smile.
He has the build, the long
legs, the incredible speed.
Indeed, he has just about
everything — except an NCAA
qualifying mark.
Hickerson's best jump of 25-2
sits slightly below the qualifying
one of 25-10. Last week at the
Pacific-10 Conference Champi
onships, Hickerson leaped to a
mark of 25-1%, winning him a
fourth place finish but not a

berth at the NCAAs.
Despite his failure to reach
the NCAA mark thus far, Hick
erson feels extremely optimistic
about his chances this weekend
at the Jenner Meet in San Jose.
"I know I can do it," Hicker
son said. "It's just a matter of
getting all the things together
at the same time, getting all the
mechanics down. I don't even
think I need a perfect jump to
qualify. No, it's definitely not
out of reach."
According to Hickerson, his
problem this year has not been
his consistency but his inability
to make the "big" jumps. "I was
expecting to do more this year."
Hickerson said. "I didn't im
prove much last year because of
an injury. This year I have been
consistent; it's just the big

jumps that 1 have been lacking.
"My training right now is bet
ter than it has been all year.
I'm expecting to at least PR
I make a personal record]. But 1
wouldn't be the least bit sur
prised if I made the mark."
If Hickerson were to qualify,
he would join junior Brian
Boggess, junior Peggy Odita,
senior Patty Purpur and senior
Erica Wheeler, who already have
qualified for the NCAAs.
Boggess, a shot putter, won an
NCAA spot last weekend in the
Pac-lOs with a throw of 59-BV2.
Odita will compete in the hep
tathlon, Wheeler in the javelin
and Purpur in the discus and
shot put.
The NCAA championships
will be held at Brigham Young
in Provo, Utah, May 31-June 4.
