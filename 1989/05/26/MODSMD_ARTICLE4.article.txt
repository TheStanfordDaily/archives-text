# Tabulating charges on occupation bill
## 
### Andrew Wilcox Staff writer 
While attention has turned to
the negotiations resulting from
the Agenda for Action coalition's
occupation of University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy's office May
15, the Stanford Police Depart
ment has been quietly tabulating
the estimated $11,134 charges in
curred for their services.
The preliminary bill to the Uni
versity consists almost entirely of
overtime and standby pay for the
50 deputies called in from the
Santa Clara County Sheriffs De
partment and from the Stanford
Police Department, according to
Stanford Police Captain Raoul
Niemeyer.
About $8,800 of the bill will go
toward the 274 total hours of
time-and-one-half and double
time pay, which averages about
$30 an hour for each officer,
Niemeyer said. The figure also
encompasses the costs of 12 ad
ditional civilian community serv
ice officers, he noted.
Additional expenses include

$1,800 of compensation for offi
cers who were kept on standby
the day following the occupation
in the event of further unrest and
$534 of miscellaneous costs,
Niemeyer said.
In contrast to the police ex
penses, damage costs in Ken
nedy's office itself were minimal.
"The only damage to the office
we know of is to the front and
back doors, which was done when
the police were trying to break
in," Asst. to the President Bob
Hamrdla said.
No physical damage to the of
fice was inflicted by the students,
Hamrdla said. "In fact, they were
quite careful not to hurt any
thing," he added.
The main harm to the office
resulting from the occupation was
the loss of a day's work for the
building's 20 employees, accord
ing to Hamrdla.
Some extra work was created
by the occupation, such as
answering phone calls and letters
regarding the matter, but "it
didn't throw a major wrench" into
office proceedings, Hamrdla said.
