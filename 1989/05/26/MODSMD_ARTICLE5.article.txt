# On KZSU, Kennedy stresses penalty according to participation
## 
### Craig Mallery Staff writer 
University President Donald Kennedy
said yesterday that the different roles
played by students who took part in the
May 15 takeover of his office will affect
the severity of the penalties they might
receive.
In an interview on KZSU, Kennedy
said, "There isn't going to be selective
prosecution, but everybody needs to un
derstand that different facts obviously
suggest different penalties."
Kennedy said his assessment was
prompted by a statement released Wed
nesday by the Agenda for Action coalition
in which they accused Kennedy and the
administration of "plans to single out

There isn't going to be selective prosecution,
but everybody needs to understand that differ
ent facts obviously suggest different penalties.'
— Donald Kennedy

'leaders' for different charges or for more
excessive penalties, such as suspension
or expulsion."
It would not be proper to speculate on
the penalties students involved in the
takeover will receive, Kennedy said.
The KZSU interview focused primarily
on recent events surrounding the occu-

pation of Kennedy's office by members
of the Agenda for Action coalition.
The occupation of his office has not
hampered discussion about the Under
graduate Committee on Minority Issues
report, Kennedy said. "We don't say be
cause you occupied a building we're never
going to speak to you again, but we do

not negotiate as a direct consequence of
an unlawful action while it's in progress."
Students had demanded a face-to-face
meeting with Kennedy during their oc
cupation of his office.
Kennedy said important concerns were
voiced by coalition members in meetings
with him Monday and Wednesday. Due
to the number of students who supported
the protesters, "We think they deserve
to be taken seriously," Kennedy said.
The students' occupation of his office
was due in large part to a lack of com
munication between students and the ad
ministration, Kennedy said. "I think
some students felt that the Thursday
report to the Academic Council last week
was going to be preemptive, that is that
it was going to close a lot of doors on

some UCMI recommendations or estab
lish low priorities for some.
"I don't think that communication got
across and so I think that some people
felt pressed to do a major action," he
added.
.Although Kennedy called the takeover
of his office an "unfortunate episode,"
he said the dialogue resulting from it has
been beneficial.
"The most exciting and rewarding di
mension of campus life at Stanford this
year has been the degree to which we
have been able to taclde difficult issues
and maintain our sense of community,"
Kennedy said. "This latest unfortunate
episode . . . has led to some really good
conversations and I think we're well un
derway with the healing process. I'm very
gratified by that."
