# ASSU senators-elect pick chair
## 
### Clarisse Perrette 
Although the spotlight is no
longer on the ASSU elections, the
newly elected senators are still
performing.
In its first meeting Tuesday
night, the ASSU Senate-elect
voted law student Edwin Sasaki
in as the new senate chair. Sasaki
will take over for outgoing chair
David Porter, who will step down
June 1.
Junior Dana Klapper, who is
presently a senator, ran against
Sasaki. Although neither candi
date was present during the
senate-elect's closed-door
selection meeting, both agreed
that it was a tight race.
Sasaki comes to the senate chair
after a year as a graduate senator
and chair of the senate's admin
istration and rules committee. Al
though he was elected to the
senate again this year as a grad
uate senator endorsed by the

People's Platform, Sasaki will
relinquish his seat in order to take
the role of chair.
Sasaki ranked cooperation as
his top goal for the senate next
year. "If there is no cooperation
between the senators, nobody can
get anything" [dojie]. He added
that he hopes to use his position
as chair to "open lines of commu
nication between the faculty and
the students" as well as between
the People's Platform and Stu
dents First parties in the senate.
Distinct from the COP, the sen
ate chair works to facilitate and
advise the individual senators as
they undertake and implement
their various projects.
According to Klapper, the "sen
ate chair does not steer the senate;
he basically serves it."
Though the chair has no voting
power, the position is influential
since the chair controls the agenda
and makes committee assign
ments and procedural decisions.

The senators chose
law student Edwin
Sasaki.

Although Sasaki is endorsed by
the People's Platform, he said he
feels confident that his affiliation
will not pose problems of par
tiality in the two-party senate.
The position of senate chair is
open to any member of the student
body who applies. However, since
a strong knowledge of the ASSU
Constitution and Bylaws is nec
essary to perform the role prop
erly, the chair has traditionally
had previous ASSU experience.
Officially, the changing of the
guard in the ASSU senate takes
place next Thursday when this
year's senate disbands. But it will
not be until the fall that Sasaki
assumes the full duties of senate
chair.
