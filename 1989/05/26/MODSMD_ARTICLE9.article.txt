# Water ordinance dams fountain flow for now

An emergency water conserva
tion ordinance adopted April 20
by the Santa Clara County Board
of Supervisors has delayed the op
eration of Stanford's fountains
and may prevent the fountains
from functioning for the
remainder of the school year.
The ordinance prohibits the op
eration of decorative fountains in
unincorporated areas of Santa
Clara County, including Stanford.
University lawyers are trying
to work out an exemption for
Stanford "in time for Commence
ment," according to Andrew Doty,
director of Community Relations
at the Office of Public Affairs.
Doty said he was optimistic
about working out an exemption
for Stanford because the Univer
differs from most of the areas
* by (he ordinance. Unlike

other areas, Stanford buys its
water from the San Francisco
Water Department and "is more
like a city," he said.
"Everyone involved seems to
agree that the situation should be
resolved," he added.
Supervisor Board Aide Alice
Sicular said the board will prob
ably consider an exemption for
Stanford on their agenda as soon
as they receive a formal request
from Stanford.
According to Cheryl Jensen,
manager of Operations and Main
tenance, University officials orig
inally intended to resume opera
tion of the fountains two weeks
after the May 9 lifting of a man
datory water rationing plan by
the San Francisco Water Depart
ment.
Jensen said the Santa Clara or
dinance came to her attention
about a week ago.
