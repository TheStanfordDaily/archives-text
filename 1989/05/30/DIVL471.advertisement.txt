PROPOSED GUIDELINES FOR LARGE
INTERDISCIPLINARY RESEARCH PROJECTS
Large interdisciplinary research projects differ significantly from the faculty/graduate student
research teams which are the norm at Stanford. In particular, the former often consist of col
leagues from different disciplines who perform different, specialized functions, ft is possible for
participants to have little knowledge or understanding of parts of the work performed by their
colleagues. Sometimes there is no single person who understands all the research.
Under such circumstances participants in large interdisciplinary group efforts are vulnerable to
the impacts of sloppiness or misconduct on the part of their co-workers. They may not notice, or
have the means to detect, such behavior. With this in mind, the Committee on Research has
drawn up the following guidelines for authorship in interdisciplinary research. We have endeav
ored to keep these simple and fundamental. As a consequence, the guidelines appear applicable
to all scientific collaborations in which multiple authorship is anticipated.
1. Principal investigators have special responsibilities to assure the overall cohesiveness
and validity of the publications on which they appear as coauthors.
2. All authors in a group effort have a shared responsibility for the published result and
should have the opportunity to review all data and all data acquisition or sample preparation
procedures.
3. Each author in a group effort should have access to the manuscript prior to its being
submitted for publication, and should agree to his or her inclusion as a coauthor. All the
participants in the program should know that the paper is being prepared for publication.
4. Early in the project, each research group should define appropriate practices for the main
tenance of data.
