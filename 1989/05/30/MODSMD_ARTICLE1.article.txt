# Kinko's sued for copyright law violations

Eight mtgor publishing houses are suing Kinko's
copying service in a $1 million suit that could draw
the line as to how much published material can be
included in course readers.
The dispute involves two New York Kinko's
copying centers that have allegedly violated
copyright laws when they copied "substantial por
tions" of 12 books and included them in course
readers.
In response to the publishers' charges, Kinko's
said the copies were within legally defined limits
that allow works to be copied for educational pur
poses without permission from the publisher.
The eight publishers suing Kinko's are: Basic
Books, Harper and Row, John Wiley and Sons,
McGraw-Hill, Penguin Books, Prentice-Hall, Richard
D. Irwin, and William Morrow and Co.
The lawsuit against Kinko's could have a serious
impact on the University's own course readers.
About 42 different Stanford classes this quarter had
course readers produced at Kinko's.
UC-Berkeley Law Prof. Stephen Barnett said the
lawsuit revolves around the interpretation of the
"fair-use" provisions in the copyright laws. Accord
ing to federal copyright laws, photocopying of
protected material is allowed without permission
when used for "criticism, comment, news reporting,
teaching (including multiple copies for classroom
use), scholarship or research."
Describing the fair-use laws as "a very gray area,"
Barnett said. "It's clearly illegal to copy an entire
book for an entire class. When you get into excerpts
of books, that's a closer question."
There has never been a case clearly establishing
how much an excerpt of a book can be included in
course readers, Barnett said. If the suit against
Kinko's is decided in court, it would set an important
precedent, according to Barnett.
Barnett pointed out, however, that previous cases
have been settled out of court and "there's a good
chance this one will be settled as well."
A representative from a publishing industry lob
bying group said the "fair use" provisions are a
"limited doctrine."
Carol Risher, director of copyright and new tech
nology at the Association of American Publishers,
cited a U.S. House of Representatives report that
accepted a series of guidelines written by publishers
and universities that defined limits to the fair use
provisions. According to Risher, these guidelines
specifically prohibit the making of anthologies for
classroom use.
Risher said that because the House accepted these
guidelines, they are the correct interpretation of
the fair-use laws and are thus legally binding.
Barnett said, however, the Congressional report
was not very specific as to whether these guidelines
represented the maximum or minimum restrictions
of the fair-use laws and are not legally binding.
Kurt Koenig, Kinko's vice president and copyright
and trademark counsel, said the publishers them
selves wrote these guidelines to prevent any copying
without permission. He said there is no incentive
