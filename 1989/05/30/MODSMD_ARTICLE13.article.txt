## Bush startles NATO with troop reduction proposal 
### 
BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) — Presi
dent Bush challenged Soviet leader Mik
hail Gorbachev yesterday to make good
on his arms control "rhetoric" and com
plete an accord within a year to limit
American and Soviet troops in Europe
to 275,000 each.
Bush said the comprehensive plan for
across-the-board reductions that he sub
mitted at a summit meeting of the 16
NATO countries and then announced
at a news conference was designed for
implementation by 1993 at the latest.
In a clear attempt to seize the initi
ative from the Soviet leader, whose eye
catching proposals to reduce both con
ventional and nuclear armories have
dazzled Europe, Bush called his own
proposals "bold" and said he wanted to
put Gorbachev's initiatives "to the test."
Meanwhile, NATO foreign ministers
who worked late into the night came
up with language on the divisive short
range nuclear missile question, two
delegations reported.
A British foreign ministry spokesman
called it "a text close to an agreement."
West German Foreign Minister Hans-
Dietrich Genscher, who has been prod
ding the alliance to move quickly on
the missile talks, told reporters early
today, "It has to be confirmed by the
prime ministers, but it includes the
comprehensive concept and short-range
forces negotiations."
Jurgen Chrobog, a West German
spokesman, called it an agreement "with
a reservation" by the British. The
British spokesman, who asked not to be
identified, refused to comment on that.
A White House spokesman, Roman
Popadiuk, declined to confirm that an
agreement had been reached, but said,
"Progress is being made."
The ministers canceled a formal din
ner and met until 1 a.m. Brussels time
(7 p.m. EDT) before producing langauge

Chrobog said the Germans were "very
satisfied" with.
Bush sent a letter to Gorbachev on
Sunday outlining the proposal and he
told reporters he would make Secretary
of State James Baker 111 available for
talks with the Soviet leader or Foreign
Minister Eduard Shevardnadze to be
held "the sooner the better."

Bush's conventional
weapons plan 'trans
formed the summit.'
— Margaret Thatcher

Having dismissed some of the Soviet
leader's measures as showy but insub
stantial, Bush said to Moscow: "We're
out there now with a proposal that the
United States puts forward, and that
has widespread alliance support. Now
test it. How serious are you? Do you
really want to reduce the imbalances
that exist in all these categories, or do
we want rhetoric?"
Bush and the other heads of state
proceeded as planned with their own
formal dinner at the Val Duchesse, an
estate owned by the Belgian royal fam
ily. Bush earlier found 20 minutes to
jog around the grounds of the Stuyven
berg Palace where he is staying.
British Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher said Bush's conventional
weapons plan "transformed the sum
mit." West German Chancellor Helmut
Kohl, who differed with the United
States over the short-range nuclear
weapons, congratulated Bush for a "far
sighted" proposal on non-nuclear forces.
At the end of the afternoon working
session, officials from various countries
said the leaders had adopted the Bush

initiative in principle and would endorse
it in their final statement today.
Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mul
roney's proposal, accepted by the
leaders, calls for NATO experts to con
sider the Bush offer for 60 to 90 days
and work out a detailed negotiating po
sition before putting it before the War
saw Pact in negotiations in Vienna.
There was no formal response from
the Soviet government but the Soviet
news agency Tass issued a brief dispatch
saying "the new proposals were made
by Washington after the Bush admin
istration came under serious criticism
from the public for the lack of any
disarmament initiatives at a time when
the Soviet Union has launched a 'peace
offensive.'"
As the two day-summit opened yes
terday, NATO Secretary General
Manfred Woerner warned the allies
against putting their trust in Gorbachev
and his proposals. "We cannot build our
security on the assumption of his per
manent good will," he said. "Only if we
remain united will we determine
events."
With his proposal, Bush deflected at
tention from the differences within the
alliance.
He said his plan involves a 20 percent
cutback in U.S. combat troops. It would
reduce overall U.S. troop strength in
Europe by about 10 percent. There are
about 150,000 U.S. combat troops in
Europe and more than 150,000 support
forces.
The Soviets have an estimated
625,000 troops in Eastern and Central
Europe. Gorbachev has already offered
to cut down to 350,000 and proposed
equal ceilings of NATO and Warsaw
Pact forces of 1.35 million.
To reach 275,000, the Soviets would
have to cut 350,000, or about 57 percent.
