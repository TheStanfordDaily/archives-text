# Reformer wins seat in Soviet legislature
## 
### 
MOSCOW (AP) — Maverick
communist Boris Yeltsin, defeated
by fellow deputies in a bid for the
new Soviet legislature, was sud
denly handed a seat yesterday and
celebrated with a noisy victory
parade through central Moscow.
In a parliamentary maneuver
that had President Mikhail Gor
bachev's blessing, a place was
opened for the former Moscow
party boss when a winner in the
elections to the full-time legisla
ture, the Supreme Soviet,
resigned on condition that Yeltsin
take his place.
An exuberant Yeltsin said the
move indicated the Congress of
People's Deputies, which elected
the members of the legislature,
"is gradually becoming more dem
ocratic. If it goes further along
this road, there is hope it will
justify the hopes of the people."
Also yesterday, Gorbachev
pushed his choice for vice presi
dent — Anatoly Lukyanov —
through the Congress, but not
before the deputies subjected the
little-known schoolmate of Gorba
chev's to tough questioning on his
views and fitness for the job.
The 2,250-seat Congress, em
powered to elect the national pres
ident from among its own mem

bers and to confirm the presi
dent's choice of vice president, let
Omsk University law professor
Alexei Kazannik vacate his spot
in the bicameral Supreme Soviet
in order to.have Yeltsia take his
place.
The decision, reached in
minutes without a direct vote on
Yeltsin's candidacy, defused a
tense situation that developed
when the outspoken opponent of
official privilege finished last on
a list of 12 candidates for 11 Rus
sian federation seats in the
legislature's Soviet of Nationali
ties in results announced Satur
day.
Tens of thousands of Muscovites
chanting "Shame!" rallied Sunday
in a stadium parking lot to protest
the defeat of Yeltsin, their stand
ard bearer, and other outspoken
Moscow progressives running for
the legislature.
Leaflets circulated through the
crowd proposed a one-hour strike
Thursday if Yeltsin were not
named to some high post by the
Congress. State-run TV said Sun
day a poll found 49 percent of
Soviets surveyed were unhappy
with how the elections had been
run.
Yeltsin, the top vote-getter in

March's popular elections for the
Congress, received 1,185 votes
from fellow deputies for a seat in
the Supreme Soviet, while 964
voted against him. But despite
that majority, he was defeated by
11 other candidates, including
Kazannik, who got more votes
than Yeltsin.

"Inasmuch as Comrade Yeltsin
received a majority of the vote,
the open place can be filled by
him," Gorbachev ruled from the
dais. "Naturally, it does not re
quire a repeat vote."
Gorbachev told Kazannik the
Congress "welcomed his initia
tive."
