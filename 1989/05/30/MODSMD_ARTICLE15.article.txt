### 
JERUSALEM (AP) - Israeli
settlers rampaged through a West
Bank village yesterday and shot
a 16-year-old Palestinian girl to
death, residents said. She was the
500 th Arab to die in the uprising
against Israeli rule of the occupied
lands.
Residents said the settlers beat
townspeople, smashed cars and
set fire to wheat fields and olive
trees.
The settlers became enraged
and opened fire when they were
attacked by Palestinian stone
throwers as they were hiking near
the village, Israel radio quoted se
curity sources as saying.
The army confirmed a Pales
tinian teen-ager was killed and
two youths were wounded at Kifil
Harith, about 10 miles southwest
of Nablus. The village is about
100 yards from the Jewish settle
ment of Ariel.
An army spokesman said Israeli
troops were not responsible and
he was checking reports settlers
did the shooting. He said the army
clamped a curfew on the village
of 3,000 to aid its investigaton.
It was the worst incident in a
recent outbreak of vigilante
reprisal raids by Jewish settlers
on Arab communities. The set

tiers have said they are frustrated
by what they consider to be army
complacency in the face of Arab
stoning and firebomb attacks.
Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir
denounced vigilantism, saying on
Israel radio, "In Israel, it's for
bidden to take justice into your
own hands, even if you have
reasons, because it damages the
foundations of the state."
His deputy, Finance Minister
Shimon Peres, declared, "There
cannot be a situation where
people decide how the law is en
forced."
The death raised to 500 the
number of Palestinians killed
since the uprising began in De
cember 1987 against Israeli occu
pation of the West Bank and Gaza
Strip. Settlers killed 19 of the
Arabs. Twenty-two Israelis also
died.
Legislator Yossi Sarid told Par
liament yesterday that the Pales
tine Liberation Organization has
conditionally accepted Israel's
proposal for elections in the oc
cupied lands to choose delegates
for peace talks with Israel.
"The PLO has already agreed
to elections and passed this on to
Washington," said Sarid, of the
left-wing Citizens Rights Move
ment.
