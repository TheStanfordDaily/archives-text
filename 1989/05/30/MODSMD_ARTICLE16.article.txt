BEIJING (AP) — Student pro
testers yesterday erected a 33-
foot-high "Goddess of Democra
cy" statue inspired by the Statue
of Liberty in an effort to unify
their divided and weakening pro
democracy movement.
More than 100,000 cheering
supporters swarmed into the
city's central Tiananmen Square
last night to watch the statue
being wheeled in.
Firecrackers burst overhead as
students from the Central Acad
emy of Fine Arts brought three
sections of what they called the
"Goddess of Democracy" — a
woman in flowing robes clutching
a torch with both hands — into
the square.
China's leaders, meanwhile,
continued efforts to put down the

popular movement that has
spawned a power struggle and left
hardliners in control. A Commu
nist Party elder yesterday blasted
the "vicious intentions of the very
few people to create turmoil."
"This statue represents democ
racy that is in the hearts of all
Chinese," said Zhao Shaoruo, a
student who helped build the
sculpture. "It will stand here on
Tiananmen Square as an expres
sion of democracy."
Zhao said the statue, made of
plaster of Paris and Styrofoam,
was inspired by the Statue of
Liberty.
Students set up the statue be
tween a monument to revolution
ary heroes and a portrait of Com
munist China's founding father,
Mao Tse-tung. The protest leaders

said they hope it will serve as a
rallying point for their campaign.
The students have been holding
regular protests since April 15 to
demand democratic reforms and
an end to corruption by officials.
They have been occupying
Tiananmen Square, the symbolic
heart of China, since May 13.
Peng Zhen, former chairman of
China's legislature, told a political
forum that while students' inten
tions were to help the government
correct mistakes, "conspirators
and bad elements" were manipu
lating the students, the official
Xinhua News Agency reported.
Peng, 86, was the latest mem
ber of China's old guard to back
the hard-line position of senior
leader Deng Xiaoping and Premier
Li Peng.
