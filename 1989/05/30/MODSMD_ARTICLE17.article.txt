Filipinos launch general strike
MANILA, Philippines (AP) — Thousands of
workers nationwide went on strike for higher
pay yesterday, defying an appeal by President
Corazon Aquino who said labor unrest would
discourage needed foreign investment.
The government said the general strike affected
169 companies employing more than 137,000
workers.
Unions said, however, that workers from 800
affiliates nationwide walked off the job, including
110 at foreign companies based in the Philippines.
They said half a million workers on central Luzon
island alone stayed home.
Yesterday's strike was called by the militant
Labor Advisory Consultative Council, a union
umbrella group that claims a nationwide mem
bership of 900,000 workers.

Council spokesman Crispin Beltran called the
strike a success.

INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — A trial that starts
this week pitting an Indianapolis art dealer
against the rival Greek and Turkish governments
of Cyprus could have repercussions throughout
the world for claims to national art treasures.
Art dealer Peg Goldberg is being sued over
four sixth-century mosaics that some call the
most important Christian antiquities ever to come
on the market. Cypriot authorities claim they
were ripped from the walls of a village church.
If U.S. District Judge James Noland rules for
Goldberg, millions of dollars worth of plundered
antiquities could pour into this country, some
analysts predict.
