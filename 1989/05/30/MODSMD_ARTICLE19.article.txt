## A 						blank check? 
### 
Lax financial system
does not adequately
check COP funding

WHEN THE POLICE
handcuffed them, Coun
cil of Presidents member
Miguel Marquez rushed to find
bail money to keep demonstra
tors out of prison. The COP
wanted to protect students who
on May 15 protested for a better
university — but loaning out the
student body's money as emer
gency bail was not the way to do
it.
Through bold leadership, mem
bers of this year's COP has ful
filled their pledge to give a voice
to students of color. While their
commitment to the Agenda for
Action's goals is admirable, the
COP's decision to use the student
body's financial resources at its
discretion shows serious flaws in
the ASSU's system of checks and
balances as well as problems with
the COP's judgment.
The system gives elected stu
dent leaders too much leeway;
and this year's COP took advan
tage of the lax controls when de
ciding to take out $1,800 from
its expense fund for bail money
and $285 to cover repair cost for
a University van used to block
police during the protest.
COP members say the money
was a loan that they would return
the next day through prear
ranged faculty donations. But
nowhere on the ASSU expense
forms was it noted that this
money was in fact a loan that
they would repay. If COP mem
bers have the power to take out
money at their discretion, then

some sort of stipulation for
repayment should appear on the
ASSU loan forms.
Better yet, rather than loan
out the student body's money, the
COP could have avoided the issue
altogether by collecting faculty
donations before the protest as
bail security. Building takeovers
mean arrests, and the COP
should have anticipated the need
for this cash.
As student leaders who have
clearly stated their commitment
to a political agenda, the COP
had the complete right to protest
and force the University to ac
knowledge the depth of student
frustration — frustration that
they said had been documented
through ASSU straw polls.
By the same token, when it
came time to decide that they
would use the student body's
money to bail out the protesters
did the COP really know how the
student body would react? Where
was the accountability then?
During the actual protest, COP
members acted as true student
leaders: Stacey Leyton took the
initiative to turn herself in for
arrest before the other students
sitting in so they would know
what to expect. And by distribut
ing informational fliers and or
ganizing a campus-wide march,
David Brown tried to alert the
rest of the student body to the
goals the protesters were fighting
for.
With two weeks to go before
its term is up, the COP needs to
take just one more step forward
as effective student leaders: Re
think the ASSU's system of
checks and balances, so that fu
ture COP members don't have
to face the same financial dilem
ma.
