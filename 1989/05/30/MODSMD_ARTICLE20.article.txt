Today's activists are
backed by history
As one of the organizers of the
recent reunion of Stanford activists
from the late 1960s and early 19705, I
find University President Donald Ken
nedy's reported assertion that today's
campus activists lack historical perspec
tive incredibly inaccurate and self
serving.
There is no question that Stanford
has more non-white students than it
did in the 19605, but that move for
ward was primarily the result of
protest actions considerably less
popular than the recent sit-in at the
President's Office. If students had not
risked their careers two decades ago,
demanding that the University keep up
with changes going on throughout soci
ety, undergraduate Stanford would still
be an isolated country club for the
nation's white elite.
However, some things never seem to
change. When a panel from the current
generation of Stanford activitsts de
scribed, to our reunion participants,
the administration's response to pres
sure for change — committees, delays,
support in principle but not principal,
etc. — the "progressive alumni" recog
nized old patterns of institutional iner
tia. We faced and overcame similar
reluctance to change years ago.
And the University must change.
Our society — at least California — is
entering a new demographic watershed,
in which the term "minority" is be
coming meaningless because there will
soon be no ethnic or racial majority.
But Stanford, ruled in the final anal
ysis by self-perpetuating bodies such as
the faculty and Board of Trustees, is
not structured to adapt to such
change. It needs help. I have no doubt
that Stanford needs to be dragged,
kicking and screaming, into the next
century, and for this reason, I person
ally applaud those who sat in at Ken
nedy's office.

More important, the 250 or so pro
gressive alumni (we include faculty and
staff, as well as students in our defini
tion of the Stanford community) unan
imously endorsed a proposal by
current activists that we form a organ
ization of alumni to support — per
haps as part of a broader program —
the efforts of the current activists.
In their proper historical perspective,
recent demonstrations — moderate in
both tone and tactics by historical
standards — are but one more skir
mish over the future of the University.
Will Stanford reinforce obsolete social
relationships, or will it lead the way
toward a more democratic and egalitar
ian society?

Being a Republican
is difficult, too
I am writing to voice my concern
about the misperception that Glen
Rosenbaum's May 24 letter reinforces
about Republicans on campus. Con
trary to Residential Education and
others' propaganda, we are not ignor
ant, callous or insensitive. What we are
is sick and tired of being abused, in
timidated or just plain ignored.
Minority groups frequently take the
occasion to remind us that Stanford is
their school also and that they have
the right to demand that Stanford act
to make them feel comfortable. We, the
28 percent of campus who are Republi
cans, also demand this right and
refuse to be silent until conservative
thoughts and speakers are free from
harassment and welcome to present
new and different ideas.
Our flier proclaiming "Republican
Appreciation Day" had two objectives.
The satire of GALA Week's Shorts Day
was not an attack on homosexuals but
rather a questioning of the gay com
munity's tactics. The Les
bian/Gay/Bisexual Community Center
not only receives recognition from the

University, but starting this year fi
nancial support, and it occupies pre
cious office space that many other
campus groups desperately desire.
Is there anybody that believes such
decisions were based upon purely ra
tional arguments? By taking advantage
of the publicity surrounding "homopho
bic" incidents, and the use of
"supporf'-demonstrating tactics like
Shorts (or is it Jeans?) Day, the gay
community has helped create an at
mosphere where the University must
make concessions. Res Ed, for example,
gives special preference to gay resident
assistant applicants.
There's nothing unusual about these
strategies — the People's Platform, the
Council of Presidents and other minor
ity groups use all the time. The Re
publicans were trying to demonstrate
how any group can use such tactics to
"establish" an artificial support that
doesn't really exist (the occupation of
the President's Office is a typical ex
ample).
The second objective was to demon
strate truly how difficult it is to be a
conservative on this campus. Quite
simply, "we can't go most places and
be comfortable." There is a liberal
fascism that pervades our community
that directs that any views that chal
lenge leftist assumptions must be
silenced — Adolfo Calero, party fliers
with women on them, Republican fliers
quoting the New York Times, etc.
It is very intimidating to express
conservative values and ideas at Stan
ford — whether in a dorm, in a forum
or even in section. Thus, the secondary
purpose was to have the approximately
2,064 students who rode bikes to class
May 18 be forced to ride around think
ing that someone might actually think
they were a Republican. I know some
were scared — so the event must have
worked.
It's too bad that we go to a Univer
sity where coercion and yelling are
more effective than rational argument.

Cutting class ignores
needs of students
I am dismayed and surprised that
James Steyer's Civil Rights and Civil
Liberties course has been cut from the
Political Science curriculum. Although
a new and similar course will be
added, the reasons for and implications
of the change bear some examination.
The primary reason for the change
is the desire to broaden the scope of
the course. However, this must be
balanced against the loss of a great
teacher. It is noteworthy that with the
exception of Political Science Prof. Da
vid Brady, no one quoted, student or
faculty, denies Steyer's teaching ability.
In the three years in which Steyer
taught, interest in Poli Sci 180 soared
to 20 percent of a given class-year, or
335 people, a four-fold increase. In
other words, Steyer's reputation as a
teacher induced 15 percent of a given
class year to explore an area they nor
mally might not have. This is exactly
the sort of academic diversification
Stanford claims to desire of its stu
dents.
The cost of teaching assistants for
the course was cited as a second rea
son. A quick analysis, however, reveals
that Stanford stands to save at most
$35,000 (seven TAs at $5,000 each) at
the educational expense of 20 percent
of its undergraduate class.
The last point voiced in defense of
the change was the desire to have the
course taught by publishing academic
faculty. Even this goal has not been
achieved; Steyer's replacement will be
only a law student.
The clear implication is that the
University truly does not care about
undergraduate education. I doubt that
this is actually the case, and hope that
those responsible for this decision will
reconsider.
