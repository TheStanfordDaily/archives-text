## Protest means progress 
### 
You may well ask: 'Why direct action?
Why sit-ins, marches, and so forth ? Isn't
negotiation a better path?' You are quite
right in calling for negotiation. Indeed,
this is the very purpose of direct action.
Nonviolent direct action seeks to create
such a crisis and foster such a tension
that a community which has constantly
refused to negotiate is forced to confront
the issue. It seeks so to dramatize the
issue that it can no longer be ignored.
— Martin Luther King, Jr.,
"Letter from a Birmingham Jail"
MANY PEOPLE HAVE asked,
"Why couldn't the protesters
simply negotiate with the admin
istration? Why did they have to occupy
a building? Why didn't they just do the
regular type of 'sit-in' ?"
Things do not simply happen by asking
those in power nicely for your demands,
though this is the first course of action.
Sometimes, after having asked for rea
sonable demands to be met and being
denied, maybe even being told that your
request is insignificant, drastic measures
need to be taken.
Had it not been for the sit-ins of the
'60s, the bus boycotts, refusal to buy
goods at places that did not serve its
customers equally, where would we be
today? It is unclear whether or not much
action would have been taken by the gov
ernment in the area of civil rights had
it not have been for leaders such as King.
Though John Kennedy was a Democrat
and did give his word that he would
address the issue of civil rights, it took
the black community putting pressure

on him and demanding that he live up
to his word before he ever took action.
Many times it takes struggle to promote
change.
Another myth that has been floating
about concerning the May 15 protesters
is that they are radical leftist individuals
who are never satisfied and constantly
impatient. ("Damn it! Why couldn't they
have waited until the response to
UCMI?")
These so called "protesters" that many
people speak about are students of this
University. We are dedicated to this uni
versity and want to see that it is made
better. We are among the "best and the
brightest" of this nation.
What separates us from the general
population of Stanford is that we cared
so much about this University that we
were willing to make sacrifices — jail,
expulsion, suspension, whatever. Such
punishments would only serve as badges
of honor, not of shame. If such actions
were to be taken against any individual
involved it would be the University that
would and should be ashamed.
It is important that we all realize that
the protest that took place May 15 is not
just the struggle of this campus, it is the
fight of every university, of every student,
of every person struggling for democracy
in the world. This protest is a show of
support for some and an example for
others, just as the protests at Cornell,
CUNY, Howard, Michigan and Beijing
have been examples and support for us.
The reason why the protest was an
occupation as opposed to a sit-in was

because sit-ins at this University have
been tried before and have made little
progress. By changing the dynamics of
the protest, it sent a clear message to
the University as to the seriousness of
the demands and the concern of the stu
dents. It. would appear that these students
thought right.
The University has initiated a dialogue
between the various ethnic communities
and demands are being met — MEChA
has its democratic process by which to
choose their dean; a search is beginning
to find a tenure-track professor of Asian-
American history; there is discussion
about the founding of a harassment griev
ance board and there is progress being
made in finding the resources needed to
fill the position of Afro-American Studies
Department chair.
It is clear that the University now
realizes that these things are important
to Stanford and its students. The ques
tion remains: Would the University have
addressed these issues if students had
not protested, or would it have continued
to refuse meetings and discussions on
such topics? Clearly, protest means prog
ress.
