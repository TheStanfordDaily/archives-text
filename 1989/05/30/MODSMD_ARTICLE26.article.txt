## Profiles in struggle: the students behind the protest Fighting for a major, to understand her people 
### 
Cheryl Taylor hopes to become
a professor of Afro-American
studies and share her people's his
tory with future generations.
"The neat thing is to really un
derstand your people," she said,
"where you come from, and how
we've been able to accomplish so
much in this nation, and under
stand how there is still so much
that plagues us, like drugs and
AIDS."
But, for Taylor, who is a junior,
just completing her major in Afro-
American studies has become a
struggle.
"I was just looking at the time
schedule for next year," she said.
"I probably won't be able to finish
my major because the courses
aren't even offered anymore that
are supposed to fulfill my major."

Taylor, who will be a theme
associate in Ujamaa House next
year, said her participation in the
May 15 takeover of University
Presdient Donald Kennedy's office
was due in large part to the
clogged channels she and other
students have encountered while
trying to strengthen the Afro-
American Studies Department
and build other ethnic studies de
partments.
"Throughout the years, there's
been different meetings and pro
posals, and meetings and propos
als, and forums on this and that,
and that and this," she said. "The
response has been pretty vacuous.
There's been no real firm com
mitment."
Stanford flaunts its high minor
ity enrollment figures, Taylor

said, but fails to educate all its
students. The administration, she
explained, "wears [the minoirty
enrollment figures] like a badge,
but we would like to be educated
about our own people as well."
While other schools, such as San
Francisco State, have made great
strides in building their ethnic
studies programs, Stanford has
lagged behind, Taylor said.
Stanford's lack of progress is
perplexing, she said. "It could be
part of this arrogance," she ex
plained, "that this stuff isn't im
portant, that it isn't a legitimate
field of study. We're going to deal
with the real stuff like history.
Maybe we'll talk about black
people for a week."

While students were working
through traditional channels to
build ethnic studies programs,
Taylor said, the administration
continued to present "mythical
barriers."
The takeover of Kennedy's of
fice, she said, represented an ef
fective use of students' collective
power.
"Universities such as Stanford
respond to pressure," she said.
"We as students can't threaten to
pull out a billion dollars from this
institution or we can't donate a
billion dollars to set up a program.
We don't have that power, but
there is power in organizing our
selves."
The takeover has forced the
University to look more closely at
the roots of its problems, Taylor
said.
"They really have to regard this
in a larger light," she said."lt's
not just about students who took
over a building for one day. It's
about racism on this campus and
the lack of education."
