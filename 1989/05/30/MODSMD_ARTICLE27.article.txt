# Unseen anger, complete breakdown
## 
### 
The May 15 takeover of Uni
versity President Donald Ken
nedy's office resulted from a
"complete breakdown of commu
nications between the administra
tion and students," according to
Jay Jay Kuo, a junior and a res
ident assistant in Otero House.
"Students felt they needed to
be pre-emptive," Kuo said. "The
administration thought that
everything was going okay. They
didn't see any of the anger or
frustration that we had."
According to Kuo, the ugliness
of the takeover could have been
avoided if the administration had
been aware of students' feelings
and had agreed to discuss the is
sues.
"I think the administration is
basically working for the same
goals as we are," Kuo said. "If
we could have sat down and talked
to Kennedy prior to [the
takeover], the Monday demon
stration wouldn't have been nec
essary and people would have said
[the changes] were the results of
peaceful negotiations between

students and Kennedy."
Although he supported the is
sues of the Agenda for Action co
alition, Kuo said he had not
planned to get arrested in the
protest. He had been demonstrat
ing outside of Kennedy's office
and trying to gather student sup
port when he realized "about a
dozen" freshmen from Otero were
involved in the protest.
"As an RA, I felt especially re
sponsible and especially angry at
the use of police force on campus,"
Kuo said. "My getting arrested
was sort of an ad-hoc decison. I
stood by it."
During the takeover itself, Kuo
said, "There was a lot of confusion
on the part of the administration.
They weren't prepared for it. Ob
viously both sides didn't do their
homework as well as they could
have."
As an RA, Kuo said he has tried
to turn dorm discussions on the
protest into an educational expe
rience.
"People have generally been
very supportive, and they under

stand my position," he said. "A
lot of people don't agree with the
tactics and I understand that."
In fact, Kuo said, the contro
versial tactics served to make the
protest successful. "If everybody
was in agreement with the tactic,
then the tactic wasn't extreme
enough," he said.
