# A 						chance to express her convictions
## 
### 
For Marisa Nordstrom, the
decision to participate in the
takeover of Univeristy President
Donald Kennedy's office was a
decision to make a firm com
mitment to issues about which
she cares deeply.
Nordstorm, a sophomore, had
not been involved in the plan
ning stages of the Agenda for
Action, but she felt the time
was right to express her views.
"Something inside me was
telling me it was time for me
to stand up for what I believe
in strongly," she said. "I felt
moved by my own convictions."
The week prior to the occu
pation of Kennedy's office,
Nordstrom had decided she
wanted to get involved with
MEChA, a Chicano/Latino stu
dent group, and the ASSU's
Committee on Democracy in Ed
ucation, both of which are part
of the Agenda for Action coali
tion.
When she heard of plans for

the takeover, she decided to join
in solidarity with many of her
friends who had been fighting
for issues on the coalition's
agenda.
"I feel like a lot of it was faith
and trust in my friends who

were involved in a lot of these
groups and had told me what
they had been through," Nord
strom said.
Many students who have been
critical of the tactics used by
the coalition have not fully un
derstood the frustrations of
those protesting, Nordstrom
said.
"I was amazed when I heard
what my friends in (the Asian-
American Students Association)
had gone through just this year
. . . to hire a tenured Asian-
American history professor."
Although Nordstrom said she
has no regrets about her par
ticipation in the takeover, she
does regret that many of the
real issues have been over
shadowed during the last week.
"[The takeover] brought all
the issues to the limelight," she
said. "The sad thing is that most
of the focus has been more on
the consequences of the actions
and not the issues."
