# Facing the administrative brick wall
## 
### 
Although Nat Sheidley was not
a member of any of the Student
of Color coalition groups or the
Committee on Democracy in Ed
ucation, he could empathize with
those who chose to takeover Uni
versity President Donald Ken
nedy's office May 15.
Sheidley, a junior who was ar
rested outside Building 10 for
blocking police access, said he un
derstands the frustration the co
alition had experienced in trying
to work with the administration.
As a member of Students for a
Free South Africa, Sheidley said
he has been frustrated in his
dealings with the administration
as well.
"I know what it feels like to be
hitting your head against a brick
wall when you're talking to the
administration and you're trying
to get the University to do some
thing," Sheidley said.
Students for a Free South
Africa had tried to meet with Ken
nedy earlier in the year about the
University's divestment policy,
Sheidley said. The group sent a
letter to Kennedy, which he then

referred to a Board of Trustee
member rather than answering it
himself, Sheidley said.
Sheidley's personal commit
ment to the coalition's issues also
played a role in his decision to
get arrested, he said. "I knew
what was going on in terms of
the issues."

According to Sheidley, the coa
lition's "smaller demands are very
important and they're very basic
and I'm very committed to those.
I think those are things the Uni
versity can do and should do."
Sheidley said he particularly en
dorsed the coalition's broader vi
sion of a diverse multicultural ed
ucation. "If the vision that these
people represent is taught
throughout high school and
throughout college, I think the
world would be a better place for
it,"he said.
According t® Sheidley, the ad
ministration devalued the stu
dents' cause during the week fol
lowing the takeover. "I think
there was huge damage done be
cause the administration tried to
sever these students from the
widespread support that was
visible when the actual thing was
going on," Sheidley said.
Nevertheless, Sheidley is en
couraged by the lines of commu
nication that appear to have been
opened between students and the
administration as a result of the
takeover.
