# Unfulfilled Orientation promises
## 
### 
Upon arriving at Stanford last
fall, Mae Lee was impressed by
the commitment the University
proclaimed it had to diversity
and ethnic pluralism.
"During Orientation, we con
stantly had this idea impressed
upon on us about how this Uni
versity is committed to multi
cultural education," she said. "I
thought that was great and that
it was really sincere."
Two weeks ago, Mae Lee
joined the protesters who occu
pied University President
Donald Kennedy's office for
nine hours.
"The reality wasn't exactly
equal to what they were saying,"
Lee said.
As a member of the Asian
American Students Association
and the Students of Color Coa
lition, Lee said she has been
frustrated in efforts to imple
ment the vision espoused by
Kennedy and others during
freshman Orientation.
While some have criticized the

Agenda for Action coalition for
incorporating too many fresh
men who might not have been
aware of the consequences of
their actions, Lee said she
believes this is not a fair attack.
"I knew what I was getting
into prior to the protest and
actual sit-in," she said. She said
she hasn't had any regrets since
the takeover of Kennedy's of
fice.
Lee said she has found her
freshman dorm, Otero House,
to be a very supportive environ
ment.
There have been ample oppor
tunities to discuss the issues
surrounding the takeover, she
said. "Even if people don't agree
with us whole-heartedly over
our tactics, they're willing to
listen. . . . There are some
people who disagree with the
teactics and are very vocal about
it, and I guess that's to be ex
pected."
Students in general have fo
cused too much on the tactics

of the coalition and not their
goals, Lee said. "People are still
stuck on the tactics and they
use that as an excuse. If they
agree with the issues, now is
the time to come behind us and
support us. We'll take responsi
bility for what we did."
