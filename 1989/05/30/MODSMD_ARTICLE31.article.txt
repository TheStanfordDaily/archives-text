# Political duty, personal convictions motivate COP member

### 
Ingrid Nava made both a per
sonal decision and a political de
cision.
Her resolution to participate in
the May 15 takeover of University
President Donald Kennedy's office
was based both on personal con
viction and on her commitment
to representing those who recently
elected her as a member of the
Council of Presidents.
"I had personal reasons — my
connection to MEChA and their
struggle," she said, "but I also
felt like the Students of Color Co
alition is the origin of the People's
Platform, and I felt responsible
to them and also to the student
body at large."
Nava, a junior, said she had
been involved in the early plan
ning stages of the Agenda for Ac
tion as a member of MEChA, a
Chicano/Latino student group and
one of the groups in the coalition.
"If I had not been a COP mem
ber, I probably would have gone
in [Kennedy's office] anyway, be
cause of my involvement with
MEChA," she said. "What pushed
me over to feeling like I had to

do it was being a COP member."
Nava said her involvement in
the May 15 protest was a reflec
tion of the commitment voiced by
her slate during the COP cam
paign.
"I think during the campaign
we made a decision that we were
committed to the goals which we
thought most of the student body
supported us on," she said. "We
decided we were going to be very
clear about what we thought we
should be doing."
Nevertheless, Nava said, prior
to the occupation of Kennedy's
office, she knew some people
would not endorse the takeover
tactic used by the coalition. "I
knew most people would agree
with the things we were going in
for," she said, "but I felt like in
the end, especially if we won
things, most people would come
around to support us."
As an individual, Nava said, she
did have second thoughts about
getting arrested.
"It's a pretty scary thing," she
said. "I knew my mom would be
freaked out."

Her mother turned out to be
relatively accepting, though, Nava
said. "She was more concerned
about me going to jail. But I think
she agrees with me politically and
I know she supports me."
During the week following the
takeover, Nava said, she began to
doubt the effectiveness of the
takeover as plans to set up an
immediate meeting with Kennedy
did not materialize.
Nava said she had hoped Ken
nedy would immediately attend to
some of the coalition's concerns.
"We didn't really start to get
any results until about seven days
later, and during that week all
we kept hearing was, 'You're
going to get charged with the Fun
damental Standard.' "
Nava said her doubts were
shared by many members of the
coalition. "During that week when
I was the most demoralized,
everybody was," she said. "Usual
ly, with the group of people that
we're with it's very uplifting and
supportive. . . . But during that
time everybody was so upset."
But, following the coalition's

meetings Monday with Kennedy
and Dean of Student Affairs
James Lyons, most doubts had
evaporated, Nava said.
For her personally, Lyons' ap
proval of the democratic selection
process for El Centro Chicano was
uplifting, Nava said. She said she
views the approval "very much of

a direct response" to the takeover.
Relations between students and
the administration have been
quite positive since the takeover,
Nava said.
"They are listening to students
now," she said. "I think if that
continues, the kind of action that
was taken May 15 will not be
necessary [again]. I think that
was really the culmination of
several years of frustration."
According to Nava, the takeover
of Kennedy's office resulted from
a failure on the part of the ad
ministration to keep in touch with
students. "They were out of touch
with what we are doing and what
we wanted because they don't lis
ten to us," she said. "Because of
that, they were also out of touch
with our frustrations."
It is not yet evident whether
the common ground now being
shared by the two sides will be
come permanent, Nava said. "I
think it depends on whether at
titudes are changed. . . . The fun
damental change really has to be
in attitudes and that's hard to
predict."

"I had personal reasons — my
connection to MEChA and their
struggle," she said, "but I also
felt like the Students of Color Co
alition is the origin of the People's
Platform, and I felt responsible
to them and also to the student
body at large."
Nava, a junior, said she had
been involved in the early plan
ning stages of the Agenda for Ac
tion as a member of MEChA, a
Chicano/Latino student group and
one of the groups in the coalition.
"If I had not been a COP mem
ber, I probably would have gone
in [Kennedy's office] anyway, be
cause of my involvement with
MEChA," she said. "What pushed
me over to feeling like I had to

do it was being a COP member."
Nava said her involvement in
the May 15 protest was a reflec
tion of the commitment voiced by
her slate during the COP cam
paign.
"I think during the campaign
we made a decision that we were
committed to the goals which we
thought most of the student body
supported us on," she said. "We
decided we were going to be very
clear about what we thought we
should be doing."
Nevertheless, Nava said, prior
to the occupation of Kennedy's
office, she knew some people
would not endorse the takeover
tactic used by the coalition. "I
knew most people would agree
with the things we were going in
for," she said, "but I felt like in
the end, especially if we won
things, most people would come
around to support us."
As an individual, Nava said, she
did have second thoughts about
getting arrested.
"It's a pretty scary thing," she
said. "I knew my mom would be
freaked out."

Her mother turned out to be
relatively accepting, though, Nava
said. "She was more concerned
about me going to jail. But I think
she agrees with me politically and
I know she supports me."
During the week following the
takeover, Nava said, she began to
doubt the effectiveness of the
takeover as plans to set up an
immediate meeting with Kennedy
did not materialize.
Nava said she had hoped Ken
nedy would immediately attend to
some of the coalition's concerns.
"We didn't really start to get
any results until about seven days
later, and during that week all
we kept hearing was, 'You're
going to get charged with the Fun
damental Standard.' "
Nava said her doubts were
shared by many members of the
coalition. "During that week when
I was the most demoralized,
everybody was," she said. "Usual
ly, with the group of people that
we're with it's very uplifting and
supportive. . . . But during that
time everybody was so upset."
But, following the coalition's

meetings Monday with Kennedy
and Dean of Student Affairs
James Lyons, most doubts had
evaporated, Nava said.
For her personally, Lyons' ap
proval of the democratic selection
process for El Centro Chicano was
uplifting, Nava said. She said she
views the approval "very much of

a direct response" to the takeover.
Relations between students and
the administration have been
quite positive since the takeover,
Nava said.
"They are listening to students
now," she said. "I think if that
continues, the kind of action that
was taken May 15 will not be
necessary [again]. I think that
was really the culmination of
several years of frustration."
According to Nava, the takeover
of Kennedy's office resulted from
a failure on the part of the ad
ministration to keep in touch with
students. "They were out of touch
with what we are doing and what
we wanted because they don't lis
ten to us," she said. "Because of
that, they were also out of touch
with our frustrations."
It is not yet evident whether
the common ground now being
shared by the two sides will be
come permanent, Nava said. "I
think it depends on whether at
titudes are changed. . . . The fun
damental change really has to be
in attitudes and that's hard to
predict."
