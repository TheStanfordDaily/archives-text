## Foiling the Wittgenstein mystique 
### The World As I Found It" By Bruce Duffy 
Tuckner, $8.95
Reviewed by John Taylor
Studying philosophy often leads one to
reflect on the relations between thought and
life. Once you know something about Hegel
and Nietzsche as philosophers, you may begin
to wonder what it would be like to have them
over for dinner.
This kind of curiosity is particularly acute
among students of Ludwig Wittgenstein, ar
guably the greatest philosopher of our century.
His elliptical prose invites us to look behind
his writings to the man who produced them.
Indeed, Wittgenstein wrote that "Genius is
talent in which character makes itself heard. . .
The greatness of what a man writes depends
on everything else he writes and does."
Wittgenstein's character shows itself with
unusual force in the "Philisophical Investiga
tions" (1953) and other collections of
"philisophical remarks." As Stanley Cavell
points out, these writings are not a report of
"results" achieved in previous works, but a
trail of footprints left behind by one who
"traveled over a wide field of thought criss
cross in every direction." Wittgenstein claimed
that he thought with his pen, so in a sense
we experience a part of his life in reading his
works.
It's important to stress "part" here, for
Wittgenstein's life included a great deal be
sides philosophy. He was, among other things,
an architect, a gardener, a soldier and a teacher
in a poor Austrian village. If we want to
understand the special nature of Wittgen
stein's genius, we need to know more about
his life.
Fortunately, in the last two years, such
information has become more accessible than
ever. Last year Brian McGuiness published
the first volume of his "Wittgenstein: A Life,"
the first full-scale biography of its subject.
McGuiness's book is a treasure house of in
formation for the Wittgenstein buff, but some
what more academic than a rather different
"source": Bruce Duffy's wonderful first novel,
"The World As I Found It."
Duffy builds his plot from the lives of Witt
genstein, his Cambridge colleagues Bertrand
Russell and G.E. Moore, and a cast of minor
characters both real and imagined. The ven
ture is unusual in its self-conscious blurring
of the boundaries between biography and fic
tion.
When I first sat down to read the book, I
was skeptical about the prospect of "historical
fiction." The term does seem, as the saying
goes, something like "military intelligence."
However, I soon found that Duffy's book
does more than "bring the facts to life" in
the manner of a "dramatic re-enactment" for
television. {"You were there at Wittgenstein's
lectures on the problem of other minds. . .")
At the same time, Wittgenstein's dialogue
seems exactly right, a natural extension of
his philisophical style.
In an article for the New York Times Book
Review, Duffy offers a few reflections on the
"fictionalizing" of historical figures: "The fic
tion writer enjoys a rare authority — the
authority of an assumed omniscience. No need
for the writer to speculate dutifully as a biog
rapher or historian would about what the
historical figure might have said or felt in a
given instance. By transforming that figure
into fiction — a character — the writer says
in effect, It was like this, thereby putting the
reader inside that character, body and soul.
The curious result is that . . . the fiction may
seem more 'true' than any historical or bio

graphical account: (readers) trust history but
believe fiction."
Whatever the accuracy of Duffy's charac
terizations, he moved me to believe in this
way; and that, certainly, is an important part
of successful fiction.
The novel begins with a prologue, a glimpse
of Wittgenstein in the late 19405. At this time,
Wittgenstein was already something of a
legend. His ideas were communicated through
typescripts and by word of mouth, but he did
not publish. He did not give "lectures" or
teach classes in the normal sense, but held
sessions in his room that have become an
important part of the Wittgenstein mystique.
Here is Duffy's description: "The door
would be open, and his students would enter
as into a chapel this room furnished solely
with an army cot, a shelf of books and
manuscripts and the folding card table on
which he wrote. Seated near the window, deep
in a funk of thought, Wittgenstein would be
lacing partly away , like a figure posing for
a life study. . . . Perched on the folding gunme
tal chairs on which he expected them to remain
for two or three hours without talking (the
students) were not to talk, smoke, raise their
hands or, in short, do anything that might
distract him. The session would 'begin'
promptly at four o'clock, but another 10 or
15 minutes might pass before, without warn
ing, he erupted into words."
After evoking the Wittgenstein made
familiar by student memoirs',' Duffy spends
relatively little time on the period in the '30s
and '40s when Wittgenstein taught at
Cambridge. Instead, he moves backwards in
time to open the first of the novel's four
books, beginning with Wittgenstein's decision
to abandon aeronautical engineering for logic
and philosophy. He travels to Cambridge and
meets Russell and Moore, who are so im
pressed by his talents that he quickly becomes
more colleague than student. Duffy chronicles
Wittgenstein's and Russell's efforts to solve
a variety of foundational problems in logic, a
collaboration made uneasy by Russell's in
securities and Wittgenstein's impossibly high
strung personality.
The account of life at Cambridge before the
first World War is interspersed with snapshots
of Wittgenstein's childhood in turn-of-the
century Vienna. His father Karl was a wealthy
industrialist and a domestic tyrant. Three
Wittgenstein sons committed suicide. Duffy

writes, "Wittgenstein's sister Gretl once said
she felt like a lump of coal, living under such
a mountain of a father. The mountain
produced some diamonds, she said, but they
were brittle diamonds and some had shattered,
or very nearly shattered. Wittgenstein very
nearly shattered several times. Music and
philanthropy weren't the only traditions in
the Wittgenstein family."
Book 2 mainly treats Wittgenstein's expe
riences as a soldier on the Russian front in
World War I. Amazingly, this is also the period
when Wittgenstein produced his first master
work, the "Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus."
We also learn something of Russell's trans
formation from philosopher to political activist
and noted philanderer. Duffy provides a
hilarious account of Russell's affair with Doris
Dudley, an aspiring (but wholly untalented)
writer from the American Midwest.
The main locale for Book 3 is Beacon Hill
School, an educational experiment founded and
operated by Russell and his second wife, the
socialist Dora Black. Wittgenstein, Moore and
Russell are reunited at Beacon Hill in 1931,
the first time all three have been together
since before the war.
After a decade in which he taught school,
gardened in a monestary and designed a
modernist home for his sister, Wittgenstein
has decided to return to philosophy. Russell
and Moore are to examine him for his doc
torate so that he can assume a chair at
Cambridge. Duffy gives us vivid portraits of
how all three have changed since their last
meetings.
On the whole, I think "The World As I
Found It" is an enormously successful novel.
It is sometimes deeply moving, often funny,
and always lively and enjoyable. Though Witt
genstein is the book's narrative center, Russell,
Moore and others receive far more attention
than I have been able to indicate here. For
example, the account of Moore's relationship
with his wife Dorothy is one of the places
where Duffy is at his best. Even minor figures
are usually characterized in a memorable fash
ion.
Another testimony to Duffy's skill is his
ability to handle certain artistic problems
unique to his subject matter. One cannot write
about philosophers without saying something
about their ideas. This dilemma threatens to
turn a novel into an uneasy mix of narrative
and textbook, but Duffy integrates abstrac
tions into his story without letting the seams
show.
Unlike the McGuiness biography mentioned
above, Duffy does not avoid discussing Witt
genstein's tortured sexual identity. Although
many of Wittgenstein's English colleagues and
admirers deny to this day that he was homo
sexual — or indee3~ha'd sexual relations of
any kind — others have presented substantial
evidence to the contrary.
Duffy treats the whole matter with both
sensitivity and a sense of humor. Wittgen
stein's self-doubts about his sexual identity
are portrayed as being of a piece with his
troubled relationships with his family (espe
cially his father), his neurotic doubts about
the quality of his work, and his ambivalence
about his Jewish ancestry.
"The World As I Found It" will be a special
treat for philosophy students, but it holds up
well on its own merits as a work of art. Unlike
many contemporary writers, Duffy writes con
vincingly about large ideas and grand figures.
People like Wittgenstein are gripped by
thought in a way that few of us can under
stand, but Duffy's language is equal to the
grandeur of his subjects. He summons up
Wittgenstein's passion with great eloquence,
only rarely trespassing over the thin line be
tween the poetic and the overwrought.
In the book's closing paragraphs, Duffy of
fers the following reflections: "There is a cer
tain palette of approaching death,a vividness
one sees in the late work of the great masters,
when a last few things work themselves free
and colors come fluid and true without much
effort. There was something of this radiant,
brooding clarity in Wittgenstein's late work.
Wittgenstein was writing a series of remarks
about the nature and perception of color —
of colors as subtle as odors and as mysterious,
in a discontinuous light, as the mind's efforts
to discern them. To discern: This finally is
the holy work of the mind." This last remark,
it seem to me, captures the spirit of Wittgen
stein's life and thought.

ture is unusual in its self-conscious blurring
of the boundaries between biography and fic
tion.
When I first sat down to read the book, I
was skeptical about the prospect of "historical
fiction." The term does seem, as the saying
goes, something like "military intelligence."
However, I soon found that Duffy's book
does more than "bring the facts to life" in
the manner of a "dramatic re-enactment" for
television. {"You were there at Wittgenstein's
lectures on the problem of other minds. . .")
At the same time, Wittgenstein's dialogue
seems exactly right, a natural extension of
his philisophical style.
In an article for the New York Times Book
Review, Duffy offers a few reflections on the
"fictionalizing" of historical figures: "The fic
tion writer enjoys a rare authority — the
authority of an assumed omniscience. No need
for the writer to speculate dutifully as a biog
rapher or historian would about what the
historical figure might have said or felt in a
given instance. By transforming that figure
into fiction — a character — the writer says
in effect, It was like this, thereby putting the
reader inside that character, body and soul.
The curious result is that . . . the fiction may
seem more 'true' than any historical or bio

graphical account: (readers) trust history but
believe fiction."
Whatever the accuracy of Duffy's charac
terizations, he moved me to believe in this
way; and that, certainly, is an important part
of successful fiction.
The novel begins with a prologue, a glimpse
of Wittgenstein in the late 19405. At this time,
Wittgenstein was already something of a
legend. His ideas were communicated through
typescripts and by word of mouth, but he did
not publish. He did not give "lectures" or
teach classes in the normal sense, but held
sessions in his room that have become an
important part of the Wittgenstein mystique.
Here is Duffy's description: "The door
would be open, and his students would enter
as into a chapel this room furnished solely
with an army cot, a shelf of books and
manuscripts and the folding card table on
which he wrote. Seated near the window, deep
in a funk of thought, Wittgenstein would be
lacing partly away , like a figure posing for
a life study. . . . Perched on the folding gunme
tal chairs on which he expected them to remain
for two or three hours without talking (the
students) were not to talk, smoke, raise their
hands or, in short, do anything that might
distract him. The session would 'begin'
promptly at four o'clock, but another 10 or
15 minutes might pass before, without warn
ing, he erupted into words."
After evoking the Wittgenstein made
familiar by student memoirs',' Duffy spends
relatively little time on the period in the '30s
and '40s when Wittgenstein taught at
Cambridge. Instead, he moves backwards in
time to open the first of the novel's four
books, beginning with Wittgenstein's decision
to abandon aeronautical engineering for logic
and philosophy. He travels to Cambridge and
meets Russell and Moore, who are so im
pressed by his talents that he quickly becomes
more colleague than student. Duffy chronicles
Wittgenstein's and Russell's efforts to solve
a variety of foundational problems in logic, a
collaboration made uneasy by Russell's in
securities and Wittgenstein's impossibly high
strung personality.
The account of life at Cambridge before the
first World War is interspersed with snapshots
of Wittgenstein's childhood in turn-of-the
century Vienna. His father Karl was a wealthy
industrialist and a domestic tyrant. Three
Wittgenstein sons committed suicide. Duffy

writes, "Wittgenstein's sister Gretl once said
she felt like a lump of coal, living under such
a mountain of a father. The mountain
produced some diamonds, she said, but they
were brittle diamonds and some had shattered,
or very nearly shattered. Wittgenstein very
nearly shattered several times. Music and
philanthropy weren't the only traditions in
the Wittgenstein family."
Book 2 mainly treats Wittgenstein's expe
riences as a soldier on the Russian front in
World War I. Amazingly, this is also the period
when Wittgenstein produced his first master
work, the "Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus."
We also learn something of Russell's trans
formation from philosopher to political activist
and noted philanderer. Duffy provides a
hilarious account of Russell's affair with Doris
Dudley, an aspiring (but wholly untalented)
writer from the American Midwest.
The main locale for Book 3 is Beacon Hill
School, an educational experiment founded and
operated by Russell and his second wife, the
socialist Dora Black. Wittgenstein, Moore and
Russell are reunited at Beacon Hill in 1931,
the first time all three have been together
since before the war.
After a decade in which he taught school,
gardened in a monestary and designed a
modernist home for his sister, Wittgenstein
has decided to return to philosophy. Russell
and Moore are to examine him for his doc
torate so that he can assume a chair at
Cambridge. Duffy gives us vivid portraits of
how all three have changed since their last
meetings.
On the whole, I think "The World As I
Found It" is an enormously successful novel.
It is sometimes deeply moving, often funny,
and always lively and enjoyable. Though Witt
genstein is the book's narrative center, Russell,
Moore and others receive far more attention
than I have been able to indicate here. For
example, the account of Moore's relationship
with his wife Dorothy is one of the places
where Duffy is at his best. Even minor figures
are usually characterized in a memorable fash
ion.
Another testimony to Duffy's skill is his
ability to handle certain artistic problems
unique to his subject matter. One cannot write
about philosophers without saying something
about their ideas. This dilemma threatens to
turn a novel into an uneasy mix of narrative
and textbook, but Duffy integrates abstrac
tions into his story without letting the seams
show.
Unlike the McGuiness biography mentioned
above, Duffy does not avoid discussing Witt
genstein's tortured sexual identity. Although
many of Wittgenstein's English colleagues and
admirers deny to this day that he was homo
sexual — or indee3~ha'd sexual relations of
any kind — others have presented substantial
evidence to the contrary.
Duffy treats the whole matter with both
sensitivity and a sense of humor. Wittgen
stein's self-doubts about his sexual identity
are portrayed as being of a piece with his
troubled relationships with his family (espe
cially his father), his neurotic doubts about
the quality of his work, and his ambivalence
about his Jewish ancestry.
"The World As I Found It" will be a special
treat for philosophy students, but it holds up
well on its own merits as a work of art. Unlike
many contemporary writers, Duffy writes con
vincingly about large ideas and grand figures.
People like Wittgenstein are gripped by
thought in a way that few of us can under
stand, but Duffy's language is equal to the
grandeur of his subjects. He summons up
Wittgenstein's passion with great eloquence,
only rarely trespassing over the thin line be
tween the poetic and the overwrought.
In the book's closing paragraphs, Duffy of
fers the following reflections: "There is a cer
tain palette of approaching death,a vividness
one sees in the late work of the great masters,
when a last few things work themselves free
and colors come fluid and true without much
effort. There was something of this radiant,
brooding clarity in Wittgenstein's late work.
Wittgenstein was writing a series of remarks
about the nature and perception of color —
of colors as subtle as odors and as mysterious,
in a discontinuous light, as the mind's efforts
to discern them. To discern: This finally is
the holy work of the mind." This last remark,
it seem to me, captures the spirit of Wittgen
stein's life and thought.

Reviewed by John Taylor
Studying philosophy often leads one to
reflect on the relations between thought and
life. Once you know something about Hegel
and Nietzsche as philosophers, you may begin
to wonder what it would be like to have them
over for dinner.
This kind of curiosity is particularly acute
among students of Ludwig Wittgenstein, ar
guably the greatest philosopher of our century.
His elliptical prose invites us to look behind
his writings to the man who produced them.
Indeed, Wittgenstein wrote that "Genius is
talent in which character makes itself heard. . .
The greatness of what a man writes depends
on everything else he writes and does."
Wittgenstein's character shows itself with
unusual force in the "Philisophical Investiga
tions" (1953) and other collections of
"philisophical remarks." As Stanley Cavell
points out, these writings are not a report of
"results" achieved in previous works, but a
trail of footprints left behind by one who
"traveled over a wide field of thought criss
cross in every direction." Wittgenstein claimed
that he thought with his pen, so in a sense
we experience a part of his life in reading his
works.
It's important to stress "part" here, for
Wittgenstein's life included a great deal be
sides philosophy. He was, among other things,
an architect, a gardener, a soldier and a teacher
in a poor Austrian village. If we want to
understand the special nature of Wittgen
stein's genius, we need to know more about
his life.
Fortunately, in the last two years, such
information has become more accessible than
ever. Last year Brian McGuiness published
the first volume of his "Wittgenstein: A Life,"
the first full-scale biography of its subject.
McGuiness's book is a treasure house of in
formation for the Wittgenstein buff, but some
what more academic than a rather different
"source": Bruce Duffy's wonderful first novel,
"The World As I Found It."
Duffy builds his plot from the lives of Witt
genstein, his Cambridge colleagues Bertrand
Russell and G.E. Moore, and a cast of minor

which he wrote. Seated near the window, deep
in a funk of thought, Wittgenstein would be
lacing partly away , like a figure posing for
a life study. . . . Perched on the folding gunme
tal chairs on which he expected them to remain
for two or three hours without talking (the
students) were not to talk, smoke, raise their
hands or, in short, do anything that might
distract him. The session would 'begin'
promptly at four o'clock, but another 10 or
15 minutes might pass before, without warn
ing, he erupted into words."
After evoking the Wittgenstein made
familiar by student memoirs',' Duffy spends
relatively little time on the period in the '30s
and '40s when Wittgenstein taught at
Cambridge. Instead, he moves backwards in
time to open the first of the novel's four
books, beginning with Wittgenstein's decision
to abandon aeronautical engineering for logic
and philosophy. He travels to Cambridge and
meets Russell and Moore, who are so im
pressed by his talents that he quickly becomes
more colleague than student. Duffy chronicles
Wittgenstein's and Russell's efforts to solve
a variety of foundational problems in logic, a
collaboration made uneasy by Russell's in
securities and Wittgenstein's impossibly high
strung personality.
The account of life at Cambridge before the
first World War is interspersed with snapshots
of Wittgenstein's childhood in turn-of-the
century Vienna. His father Karl was a wealthy
industrialist and a domestic tyrant. Three
Wittgenstein sons committed suicide. Duffy

writes, "Wittgenstein's sister Gretl once said
she felt like a lump of coal, living under such
a mountain of a father. The mountain
produced some diamonds, she said, but they
were brittle diamonds and some had shattered,
or very nearly shattered. Wittgenstein very
nearly shattered several times. Music and
philanthropy weren't the only traditions in
the Wittgenstein family."
Book 2 mainly treats Wittgenstein's expe
riences as a soldier on the Russian front in
World War I. Amazingly, this is also the period
when Wittgenstein produced his first master
work, the "Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus."
We also learn something of Russell's trans
formation from philosopher to political activist
and noted philanderer. Duffy provides a
hilarious account of Russell's affair with Doris
Dudley, an aspiring (but wholly untalented)
writer from the American Midwest.
The main locale for Book 3 is Beacon Hill
School, an educational experiment founded and
operated by Russell and his second wife, the
socialist Dora Black. Wittgenstein, Moore and
Russell are reunited at Beacon Hill in 1931,
the first time all three have been together
since before the war.
After a decade in which he taught school,
gardened in a monestary and designed a
modernist home for his sister, Wittgenstein
has decided to return to philosophy. Russell
and Moore are to examine him for his doc
torate so that he can assume a chair at
Cambridge. Duffy gives us vivid portraits of
how all three have changed since their last
meetings.
On the whole, I think "The World As I
Found It" is an enormously successful novel.
It is sometimes deeply moving, often funny,
and always lively and enjoyable. Though Witt
genstein is the book's narrative center, Russell,
Moore and others receive far more attention
than I have been able to indicate here. For
example, the account of Moore's relationship
with his wife Dorothy is one of the places
where Duffy is at his best. Even minor figures
are usually characterized in a memorable fash
ion.
Another testimony to Duffy's skill is his
ability to handle certain artistic problems
unique to his subject matter. One cannot write
about philosophers without saying something
about their ideas. This dilemma threatens to
turn a novel into an uneasy mix of narrative
and textbook, but Duffy integrates abstrac
tions into his story without letting the seams
show.
Unlike the McGuiness biography mentioned
above, Duffy does not avoid discussing Witt
genstein's tortured sexual identity. Although
many of Wittgenstein's English colleagues and
admirers deny to this day that he was homo
sexual — or indee3~ha'd sexual relations of
any kind — others have presented substantial
evidence to the contrary.
Duffy treats the whole matter with both
sensitivity and a sense of humor. Wittgen
stein's self-doubts about his sexual identity
are portrayed as being of a piece with his
troubled relationships with his family (espe
cially his father), his neurotic doubts about
the quality of his work, and his ambivalence
about his Jewish ancestry.
"The World As I Found It" will be a special
treat for philosophy students, but it holds up
well on its own merits as a work of art. Unlike
many contemporary writers, Duffy writes con
vincingly about large ideas and grand figures.
People like Wittgenstein are gripped by
thought in a way that few of us can under
stand, but Duffy's language is equal to the
grandeur of his subjects. He summons up
Wittgenstein's passion with great eloquence,
only rarely trespassing over the thin line be
tween the poetic and the overwrought.
In the book's closing paragraphs, Duffy of
fers the following reflections: "There is a cer
tain palette of approaching death,a vividness
one sees in the late work of the great masters,
when a last few things work themselves free
and colors come fluid and true without much
effort. There was something of this radiant,
brooding clarity in Wittgenstein's late work.
Wittgenstein was writing a series of remarks
about the nature and perception of color —
of colors as subtle as odors and as mysterious,
in a discontinuous light, as the mind's efforts
to discern them. To discern: This finally is
the holy work of the mind." This last remark,
it seem to me, captures the spirit of Wittgen
stein's life and thought.

Ludwig Wittgenstein
Tuckner, $8.95
Reviewed by John Taylor
Studying philosophy often leads one to
reflect on the relations between thought and
life. Once you know something about Hegel
and Nietzsche as philosophers, you may begin
to wonder what it would be like to have them
over for dinner.
This kind of curiosity is particularly acute
among students of Ludwig Wittgenstein, ar
guably the greatest philosopher of our century.
His elliptical prose invites us to look behind
his writings to the man who produced them.
Indeed, Wittgenstein wrote that "Genius is
talent in which character makes itself heard. . .
The greatness of what a man writes depends
on everything else he writes and does."
Wittgenstein's character shows itself with
unusual force in the "Philisophical Investiga
tions" (1953) and other collections of
"philisophical remarks." As Stanley Cavell
points out, these writings are not a report of
"results" achieved in previous works, but a
trail of footprints left behind by one who
"traveled over a wide field of thought criss
cross in every direction." Wittgenstein claimed
that he thought with his pen, so in a sense
we experience a part of his life in reading his
works.
It's important to stress "part" here, for
Wittgenstein's life included a great deal be
sides philosophy. He was, among other things,
an architect, a gardener, a soldier and a teacher
in a poor Austrian village. If we want to
understand the special nature of Wittgen
stein's genius, we need to know more about
his life.
Fortunately, in the last two years, such
information has become more accessible than
ever. Last year Brian McGuiness published
the first volume of his "Wittgenstein: A Life,"
the first full-scale biography of its subject.
McGuiness's book is a treasure house of in
formation for the Wittgenstein buff, but some
what more academic than a rather different
"source": Bruce Duffy's wonderful first novel,
"The World As I Found It."
Duffy builds his plot from the lives of Witt
genstein, his Cambridge colleagues Bertrand
Russell and G.E. Moore, and a cast of minor
characters both real and imagined. The ven
ture is unusual in its self-conscious blurring
of the boundaries between biography and fic
tion.
When I first sat down to read the book, I
was skeptical about the prospect of "historical
fiction." The term does seem, as the saying
goes, something like "military intelligence."
However, I soon found that Duffy's book
does more than "bring the facts to life" in
the manner of a "dramatic re-enactment" for
television. {"You were there at Wittgenstein's
lectures on the problem of other minds. . .")
At the same time, Wittgenstein's dialogue
seems exactly right, a natural extension of
his philisophical style.
In an article for the New York Times Book
Review, Duffy offers a few reflections on the
"fictionalizing" of historical figures: "The fic
tion writer enjoys a rare authority — the
authority of an assumed omniscience. No need
for the writer to speculate dutifully as a biog
rapher or historian would about what the
historical figure might have said or felt in a
given instance. By transforming that figure
into fiction — a character — the writer says
in effect, It was like this, thereby putting the
reader inside that character, body and soul.
The curious result is that . . . the fiction may
seem more 'true' than any historical or bio

graphical account: (readers) trust history but
believe fiction."
Whatever the accuracy of Duffy's charac
terizations, he moved me to believe in this
way; and that, certainly, is an important part
of successful fiction.
The novel begins with a prologue, a glimpse
of Wittgenstein in the late 19405. At this time,
Wittgenstein was already something of a
legend. His ideas were communicated through
typescripts and by word of mouth, but he did
not publish. He did not give "lectures" or
teach classes in the normal sense, but held
sessions in his room that have become an
important part of the Wittgenstein mystique.
Here is Duffy's description: "The door
would be open, and his students would enter
as into a chapel this room furnished solely
with an army cot, a shelf of books and
manuscripts and the folding card table on
which he wrote. Seated near the window, deep
in a funk of thought, Wittgenstein would be
lacing partly away , like a figure posing for
a life study. . . . Perched on the folding gunme
tal chairs on which he expected them to remain
for two or three hours without talking (the
students) were not to talk, smoke, raise their
hands or, in short, do anything that might
distract him. The session would 'begin'
promptly at four o'clock, but another 10 or
15 minutes might pass before, without warn
ing, he erupted into words."
