# John Hawkes reads from new novel
## 
### 
John Hawkes, the internationally ac
claimed experimental novelist, will read at
Stanford from a forthcoming novel today
at 8 p.m. in Room 2 of History Corner.
From"The Cannibal" of 1949 to
"Whistlejacket" published in 1988, Hawkes
has worked to find poetic and mythical
alternatives to the conventions of main
stream realist fiction. His stated commit
ment has been to vision, imagination and
language — not to theme, structure, plot.
In France, where he has twice won the
prize for the best foreign novel of the year,
Hawkes is considered the heir of Faulkner.

He has also been seen as anticipating the
comic audacities of Garcia Marquez and
other Latin American "magic realists."
Hawkes retired last year after many years
as a professor at Brown University. In 1966-
67, he was at Stanford directing "Voice
Project," a three-quarter experiment in
teaching freshmen to discover and write in
their own unique authorial voices.
Hawkes' reading, jointly sponsored by the
School of Humanities and Sciences, the
English Department, the Creative Writing
Program and Modern Thought and Litera
ture, is open and free to the public.
