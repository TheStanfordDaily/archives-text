The British have always been avid travelers. Perhaps, as
some critics are fond of saying, this is because they used to
own most of the world.
Or, as historian Paul Fussell suggests, maybe it stems fron
their fantasies about the tropics, born in the brutal cold of
the World War I trenches. A popular postcard that soldiers
sent back from the front reads "Greetings from the
Trenches"; above the words, a palm tree and sun are

emblazoned.
Whether motivated by im
perialism or cold, the British
have established a tradition of
travel writing that is uncom
monly literate, independent
and interesting. So it comes as
little surprise that the British
travel series "The Rough
Guides," (recently re-issued in

America as "The Real Guides") share these
admirable qualities. What is a welcome and
distinct deviation from British tradition is
that these guides are also seriously commit
ted to women, and to the financially im
poverished.
The "Rough Guides" began in 1981,
when Mark Ellingham, a recent graduate of
Bristol University, decided to go to Greece
rather than look for a job. Sounding
remarkably similar to many American uni
versity graduates, he says of this decision,
"We (the author and his friends) had a
series of deadened jobs and were looking for
something to do."
With a (very) small advance from the
British publishers Routledge & Kegan Paul,
Ellingham and three friends traveled
through Greece for nine months. In 1982,
they produced the first of the series, the
very popular "Rough Guide to Greece."
The success of this first guide was
largely due to the Ellingham and Co.'s re
jection of everything previous guide books
had said and done. Ellingham says,"It was
very important to us that we write the
kind of guidebook we would find useful. . . .
Up until that point, the books that were
available were either stuffy 'Blue Guide'
types which didn't acknowledge the exis
tence of culture beyond the Byzantine era,
or crass, budget-is-all things that didn't
acknowledge that Greece had any culture at
any time. I thought that this was the time
to write a guide which vaguely appeared as
a 20th century object, taking in the idea
that modern culture and politics are just as
important as everything else."
Ellingham's words have proved a success
ful formula. Since the Greece guide book,
no fewer than 22 other "Rough Guides"
have come into print. In addition to these,
the series has released a special travel book
for women (co-published with Pandora
Press) entitled "Half the Earth: Women's
Experiences of Travel Worldwide."
These are not like Fodor's, or even the
"Let's Go" series. These guides cover every
thing from history to contraception, from
sexual harrassment to drug laws.
This description of the music scene in
Mexico City is characteristically incisive:
"Rock survives on a very small but pas
sionate scale. To impart flavor, suffice it to
say that Pink-Floyd-The-Wall is a single,
hallowed word . . . fans, generally older
than their counterparts elsewhere, affect a
style that hovers darkly between beatnik
and post-punk."
"The Real Guides" will answer the
prayers of many traveling students this
summer. Except, of course, those of the
students who had planned to write guide
books of their own.
