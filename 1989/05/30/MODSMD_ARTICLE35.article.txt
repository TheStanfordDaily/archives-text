## Women's golf fades late to take 10th at NCAAs 
### David Hirning Staff writer 
Heading into the final 18 holes
of the NCAA Championship at the
Stanford Golf Course, the Cardi
nal women's golf team was laugh
ing in the face of inexperience and
stood poised to storm into the top
five. Coming off a third-round
299, Stanford was in sixth, only
six shots behind third-place Ari
zona.

Cardinal 10th at NCAAs
But when when the wind kicked
up on a cloudy Saturday, the
young team's high hopes were
blown away by a final-round 322.
Instead of climbing further, Stan
ford fell back into 10th place.
"I think our team doesn't know
how to play in the wind," said
sophomore Jodi Figley, who
finished 19th overall in the tour
nament with a 304. "We were ex
cited and ready to play really well
on Saturday, but the weather just
killed us."
Defending champion Tulsa also
had its position torn from its
grasp, as San Jose State snuck
up on the Golden Hurricane and
stole the title by one stroke, 1208-
1209.
Sophomore Pat Hurst, who
birdied 18 to win it for the Spar
tans, won the individual title by
two strokes over freshman Susan
Slaughter of Arizona.

As far as the Cardinal was con
cerned, the tournament should
have been three rounds. Stanford
had knocked 10 strokes off its pre
vious day's total on Friday, and
had moved from eighth to sixth
place.
"Today was moving day," Stan
ford Coach Tim Baldwin said after
Friday's sub-300 round. "We
wanted to move, and we did. We're
shooting for a top five finish,
which will take about a 297."
But after a very consistent
round by the team — 73, 73, 76,
77, 78 — on Friday, Figley was
the lone Cardinal player to crack
80 on the fateful Saturday. The
wind served an omen early when
Audrey Wooding and Stephanie
Davis both went out of bounds
off the first tee.
"The course played tougher
than I've ever seen it," said Davis,
a freshman from Bainbridge Is
land, Wash., who carded an 84
Saturday. "It didn't help when I
went out of bounds (to start off).
I triple-bogeyed the first hole. The
wind was bad — I hit a ball
straight at the pin and the wind
took it 20 yards away."
Wooding had simply a phenom
enal tournament, despite her final
round 81. Consider that the 81
was her highest round even
though she carded a 10 on the
fourth hole on Wednesday. An
even-par 73 on Friday was, in
Baldwin's words, "her best round
ever."
"She had some bad breaks (Sat

urday), but she just played ter
rific," Baldwin said of Wooding.
"This was definitely her best tour
nament. She's a team leader, both
on and off the golf course. There's
no quit in that girl."
Indeed, just as Wooding did not
give up after the bad fourth hole
on Wednesday (she recovered to
shoot 37 on the back nine and
finish with 80), she bounced back
from a double-bogey on 18 Thurs
day. On Friday she birdied the
hole to finish with the par round,
and then on Saturday she holed
a breaking five-foot putt on 18 to
preserve the top-10 finish for the
Cardinal.
"If we hadn't finished in the
top 10, I think we'd be pretty
upset," said Figley. "We're disap
pointed, but people didn't even
expect us to qualify for NCAAs."
"Tying (the score of) the top
ranked team in the country
(Texas) is certainly nothing to be
ashamed of," Baldwin said. "We
played even all week with teams
like Oklahoma State, Florida,

Georgia and Arizona State.
"Our goal was to finish in the
top five, and I honestly feel that
if the weather (on Saturday) was
like it was the last three days, we
would have. We just haven't
played in wind like that all year."
Stanford had to do without the
usually stellar performance of
freshman Adele Moore, who had
problems with her swing that she
could never quite resolve. Despite
a disappointing tournament, she
was named honorable mention All-
America for her freshman-year
achievements.
Figley, who was awarded the
same honor last year, was one
Cardinal member who hoped to
make up for a down year at
NCAAs. After a par round on
Wednesday she was on her way,
but then a second-round 81
epitomized the pattern of her
year.
Instead of writing the tourna
ment off, Figley had a meeting
with Baldwin and came back to
shoot just four over for the last
36 holes. If not for a four-putt on
the wind-swept 11th hole, she
would have finished in the top 10
for the tournament.

was named honorable mention All-

Figley, who was awarded the
same honor last year, was one
Cardinal member who hoped to
make up for a down year at
NCAAs. After a par round on
Wednesday she was on her way,
but then a second-round 81
epitomized the pattern of her
year.
Instead of writing the tourna
ment off, Figley had a meeting
with Baldwin and came back to
shoot just four over for the last
36 holes. If not for a four-putt on
the wind-swept 11th hole, she
would have finished in the top 10
for the tournament.
Heading into the final 18 holes
of the NCAA Championship at the

299, Stanford was in sixth, only
six shots behind third-place Ari

Cardinal 10th at NCAAs
But when when the wind kicked
up on a cloudy Saturday, the
young team's high hopes were
blown away by a final-round 322.
Instead of climbing further, Stan
ford fell back into 10th place.
"I think our team doesn't know
how to play in the wind," said
sophomore Jodi Figley, who
finished 19th overall in the tour
nament with a 304. "We were ex
cited and ready to play really well
on Saturday, but the weather just
killed us."
Defending champion Tulsa also
had its position torn from its
grasp, as San Jose State snuck
up on the Golden Hurricane and
stole the title by one stroke, 1208-
1209.
Sophomore Pat Hurst, who
birdied 18 to win it for the Spar
tans, won the individual title by
two strokes over freshman Susan
Slaughter of Arizona.

As far as the Cardinal was con
cerned, the tournament should
have been three rounds. Stanford
had knocked 10 strokes off its pre
vious day's total on Friday, and
had moved from eighth to sixth
place.
"Today was moving day," Stan
ford Coach Tim Baldwin said after
Friday's sub-300 round. "We
wanted to move, and we did. We're
shooting for a top five finish,
which will take about a 297."
But after a very consistent
round by the team — 73, 73, 76,
77, 78 — on Friday, Figley was
the lone Cardinal player to crack
80 on the fateful Saturday. The
wind served an omen early when
Audrey Wooding and Stephanie
Davis both went out of bounds
off the first tee.
"The course played tougher
than I've ever seen it," said Davis,
a freshman from Bainbridge Is
land, Wash., who carded an 84
Saturday. "It didn't help when I
went out of bounds (to start off).
I triple-bogeyed the first hole. The
wind was bad — I hit a ball
straight at the pin and the wind
took it 20 yards away."
Wooding had simply a phenom
enal tournament, despite her final
round 81. Consider that the 81
was her highest round even
though she carded a 10 on the
fourth hole on Wednesday. An
even-par 73 on Friday was, in
Baldwin's words, "her best round
ever."
"She had some bad breaks (Sat

urday), but she just played ter
rific," Baldwin said of Wooding.
"This was definitely her best tour
nament. She's a team leader, both
on and off the golf course. There's
no quit in that girl."
Indeed, just as Wooding did not
give up after the bad fourth hole
on Wednesday (she recovered to
shoot 37 on the back nine and
finish with 80), she bounced back
from a double-bogey on 18 Thurs
day. On Friday she birdied the
hole to finish with the par round,
and then on Saturday she holed
a breaking five-foot putt on 18 to
preserve the top-10 finish for the
Cardinal.
"If we hadn't finished in the
top 10, I think we'd be pretty
upset," said Figley. "We're disap
pointed, but people didn't even
expect us to qualify for NCAAs."
"Tying (the score of) the top
ranked team in the country
(Texas) is certainly nothing to be
ashamed of," Baldwin said. "We
played even all week with teams
like Oklahoma State, Florida,

Georgia and Arizona State.
"Our goal was to finish in the
top five, and I honestly feel that
if the weather (on Saturday) was
like it was the last three days, we
would have. We just haven't
played in wind like that all year."
