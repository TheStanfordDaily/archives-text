## Women's golf fades late to take 10th at NCAAs 
### David Hirning Staff writer 
Heading into the final 18 holes
of the NCAA Championship at the
Stanford Golf Course, the Cardi
nal women's golf team was laugh
ing in the face of inexperience and
stood poised to storm into the top
five. Coming off a third-round
299, Stanford was in sixth, only
six shots behind third-place Ari
zona.

Cardinal 10th at NCAAs
But when when the wind kicked
up on a cloudy Saturday, the
young team's high hopes were
blown away by a final-round 322.
Instead of climbing further, Stan
ford fell back into 10th place.
"I think our team doesn't know
how to play in the wind," said
sophomore Jodi Figley, who
finished 19th overall in the tour
nament with a 304. "We were ex
cited and ready to play really well
on Saturday, but the weather just
killed us."
Defending champion Tulsa also
had its position torn from its
grasp, as San Jose State snuck
up on the Golden Hurricane and
stole the title by one stroke, 1208-
1209.
Sophomore Pat Hurst, who
birdied 18 to win it for the Spar
tans, won the individual title by
two strokes over freshman Susan
Slaughter of Arizona.

As far as the Cardinal was con
cerned, the tournament should
have been three rounds. Stanford
had knocked 10 strokes off its pre
vious day's total on Friday, and
had moved from eighth to sixth
place.
"Today was moving day," Stan
ford Coach Tim Baldwin said after
Friday's sub-300 round. "We
wanted to move, and we did. We're
shooting for a top five finish,
which will take about a 297."
But after a very consistent
round by the team — 73, 73, 76,
77, 78 — on Friday, Figley was
the lone Cardinal player to crack
80 on the fateful Saturday. The
wind served an omen early when
Audrey Wooding and Stephanie
Davis both went out of bounds
off the first tee.
"The course played tougher
than I've ever seen it," said Davis,
a freshman from Bainbridge Is
land, Wash., who carded an 84
Saturday. "It didn't help when I
went out of bounds (to start off).
I triple-bogeyed the first hole. The
wind was bad — I hit a ball
straight at the pin and the wind
took it 20 yards away."
Wooding had simply a phenom
enal tournament, despite her final
round 81. Consider that the 81
was her highest round even
though she carded a 10 on the
fourth hole on Wednesday. An
even-par 73 on Friday was, in
Baldwin's words, "her best round
ever."
"She had some bad breaks (Sat
