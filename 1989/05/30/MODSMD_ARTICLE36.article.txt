# SJSU's Hurst wins two titles with one putt
## 
### Evan Tuchinsky Senior staff writer 
Golf is often viewed by those
who don't play the game as one
of the more unexciting sports to
watch.
Saturday afternoon, however,
in the final round of the NCAA
Women's Golf Championship at
the Stanford Golf Course, San
Jose State sophomore Pat Hurst
allayed the misconception in gran
diose fashion.
Entering Saturday's competi
tion, Hurst held a fragile two
stroke lead over Cathy Mockett,
whose Tulsa team had a three
stroke advantage over San -lose
State.
After the first nine holes, Tulsa
increased the margin to six
strokes. Hurst had extended her
lead over Mockett by another
stroke, but neither player re
corded particularly fine scores.
Hurst sat at a three-over-par 39,
Mockett at 40.
Susan Slaughter of Arizona,
however, fared much better. With
a blistering front nine, she closed
to within one stroke of Hurst by
the 16th hole.
Then the drama began.
Status quo remained through
the 17th hole. Mockett slowly self
destructed, falling quickly out of
the running for the individual
title. Hurst parred the 17th, but
so did Slaughter.
In terms of the team competi
tion, San Jose State Coach Mark
Gale conceded defeat after the
17th hole, thinking his team was
five strokes out as the last group
— Hurst, Mockett and Slaughter
— approached the 18th tee. He
congratulated Tulsa Coach Dale
McNamara and informed Hurst
of the perceived deficit.
Fortunately for Gale, Hurst
possesses an undeflatable compet
itive spirit.
For the tournament, the 18th
hole was designated a par 5, even
though the green can be reached
without much difficulty in two
shots. This left a wrenching deci
sion for the players: play it safe
and reach the green in two shots,
or take a risk and try to make it
in one, knowing that three large
bunkers eagerly await an errant
shot.
Though she risked losing the
individual title, she threw safety
to the blowing wind and set her
sights on cutting the margin.
Her tee shot landed right in the

middle of the fairway, a long drive
away from the green. The pin was
placed to the left of the green,
leaving little margin for error.^
Slaughter, whose initial drive
fell within feet of Hurst's, played
it safe, guiding her shot within
chipping range of the green.
Hurst took the chance, risking
the pre-eminent position she held
since the opening round. Her ap
proach shot went wide to the right,
landing 10 feet to the right of the
green and 40 from the pin.
She needed two shots for birdie
and three for par, as did
Slaughter. Slaughter took the lat
ter route, finishing the hole with
par.
Mockett, meanwhile, bogeyed
the hole and finished with a seven
over-par 81, setting defending
NCAA champion Tulsa's four
round total at 1209.
That left Hurst. Her chip shot
rolled gracefully to within four
feet of the pin. One birdie putt
later, she sealed her first NCAA
individual championship.
The putt also sealed the team
title, a fact that became evident
five minutes later. Instead of con
gratulating, Gale was congrat
ulated. With Hurst's round, San
Jose State had bridged the
seemingly insurmountable six
stroke gap and finished with a
title-winning 1208.
One stroke decided the tourna
ment. Who says golf can't be ex
citing?
