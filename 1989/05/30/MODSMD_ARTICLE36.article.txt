# SJSU's Hurst wins two titles with one putt

Golf is often viewed by those
who don't play the game as one
of the more unexciting sports to
watch.
Saturday afternoon, however,
in the final round of the NCAA
Women's Golf Championship at
the Stanford Golf Course, San
Jose State sophomore Pat Hurst
allayed the misconception in gran
diose fashion.
Entering Saturday's competi
tion, Hurst held a fragile two
stroke lead over Cathy Mockett,
whose Tulsa team had a three
stroke advantage over San -lose
State.
After the first nine holes, Tulsa
increased the margin to six
strokes. Hurst had extended her
lead over Mockett by another
stroke, but neither player re
corded particularly fine scores.
Hurst sat at a three-over-par 39,
Mockett at 40.
Susan Slaughter of Arizona,
however, fared much better. With
a blistering front nine, she closed
to within one stroke of Hurst by
the 16th hole.
