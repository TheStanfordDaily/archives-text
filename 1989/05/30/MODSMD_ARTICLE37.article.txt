# Voices from the field speak prophecies of NBA playoffs
## 
### 
"If you write it, it will run."
— a little voice heard en route to The
Daily.
Field of Dreams may have been a
bit too sentimental, but it's had a
profound effect on a lot of people.
Already, my father has blown out our
living room and erected 50-foot stadium
lights above the remnants.
But it seems unlikely that Kevin
Costner and Co. are the only ones that
are hearing whispers wafting out of the
cornfield. Rather, judging by the latest
happenings in the sports world, those
nameless voices are also lilting through
NBA arenas. . .
"If you build it, he will come."
This is the lesson the Detroit Pistons
are learning, the same lesson that mem
bers of the New York Knicks and
Cleveland Cavaliers are writing on
chalkboards 100 times. Build a lead, and
Michael Jordan will come.
Monday, Jordan didn't bring the Bulls
all the way back, as Detroit held on to
tie the NBA Eastern Conference cham

pionship series at 2-2. But Jordan was
having (for him) an off, off game — only
three points in the middle two quarters
— and still came through midway in the
fourth with a prototypical in-your-face
thunder dunk that sparked Chicago's
final rally.
Meanwhile, Jordan's performance in
Saturday's Game 3 was one for the ages,
one that, even with all his 1989 heroics,
may only have been exceeded in his career
by his 63 points against Boston a few
years ago.

When Detroit enlarged its lead in the
fourth quarter Saturday, Pat O'Brien of
CBS told viewers that he had just over
heard Chicago Coach Doug Collins tell
his team during a timeout that they are
not quitters. For those of us in the aur
dience who were in fact aware that Mi
chael Jordan was on the Bulls, this was
not a news flash.
Jordan came out of that timeout and,
more or less, eagled every hole and bowled
a strike on every frame. Now maybe Ar
nold Palmer and Don Weber had streaks
like that, but not with five guys guarding
them.
How did Jordan make that last shot?
"Ease his pain."
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar played 10
minutes in the Los Angeles Lakers' West
ern Conference-clinching win over the
Phoenix Suns Sunday.
Yet of the eight Lakers that played in
that game, none of them contributed
more to the win than Abdul-Jabbar.
Abdul-Jabbar is the Lakers' sole mo
tivation for winning now. What their
"guarantee" was to the Lakers last year,

Abdul-Jabbar is the
Lakers' sole motivation for
winning now. What their
guarantee' was to the
Lakers last year, Abdul-
Jabbar is to them this
year.

Abdul-Jabbar is to them this year.
Clearly, though he has shown more
flashes of his former self than, say, Fer
nando Valenzuela, the Lakers will not
miss Abdul-Jabbar's presence on the
court next year. Indeed, his performance
often looks pa m ful. During the regular
season, it was hard for Los Angeles Coach
Pat Riley and the Lakers to justify Abdul-
Jabbar's playing at all.
This is the justification. If the Lakers
fail to threepeat, the most prolific NBA
player ever will end his career on a down

note. But the Lakers know that Kareem
doesn't deserve that pain.
"Go the distance."
Wait. . .1 know who's been making
those whispers.
With Larry Bird on the shell' this
season, the NBA's list of deluxe-super
elite attractions was reduced to two
Jordan and the Lakers' Magic Johnson.
Who else would be whispering "Go the
distance," but CBS.
Brad Daugherty and Kevin Johnson
are among the many great young players
that have arrived, but a Cleveland-
Phoenix series would not exactly be tan
talizing to the upper brass at CBS. It
makes sense that they would want Jordan
and Johnson to play as many games as
possible.
Therefore, before each seven-game
playoff, you can hear the powerful, om
niscient voice of CBS exhorting to prolong
the series as long as possible.
But if I may be so bold, I'd like to
venture something from out of my own
cornfield, specifically for the Lakers.
"If you play it, you will win."

fourth with a prototypical in-your-face
thunder dunk that sparked Chicago's
final rally.
Meanwhile, Jordan's performance in
Saturday's Game 3 was one for the ages,
one that, even with all his 1989 heroics,
may only have been exceeded in his career
by his 63 points against Boston a few
years ago.

When Detroit enlarged its lead in the
fourth quarter Saturday, Pat O'Brien of
CBS told viewers that he had just over
heard Chicago Coach Doug Collins tell
his team during a timeout that they are
not quitters. For those of us in the aur
dience who were in fact aware that Mi
chael Jordan was on the Bulls, this was
not a news flash.
Jordan came out of that timeout and,
more or less, eagled every hole and bowled
a strike on every frame. Now maybe Ar
nold Palmer and Don Weber had streaks
like that, but not with five guys guarding
them.
How did Jordan make that last shot?
"Ease his pain."
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar played 10
minutes in the Los Angeles Lakers' West
ern Conference-clinching win over the
Phoenix Suns Sunday.
Yet of the eight Lakers that played in
that game, none of them contributed
more to the win than Abdul-Jabbar.
Abdul-Jabbar is the Lakers' sole mo
tivation for winning now. What their
"guarantee" was to the Lakers last year,

Abdul-Jabbar is the
Lakers' sole motivation for
winning now. What their
guarantee' was to the
Lakers last year, Abdul-
Jabbar is to them this
year.

Abdul-Jabbar is to them this year.
Clearly, though he has shown more
flashes of his former self than, say, Fer
nando Valenzuela, the Lakers will not
miss Abdul-Jabbar's presence on the
court next year. Indeed, his performance
often looks pa m ful. During the regular
season, it was hard for Los Angeles Coach
Pat Riley and the Lakers to justify Abdul-
Jabbar's playing at all.
This is the justification. If the Lakers
fail to threepeat, the most prolific NBA
player ever will end his career on a down

note. But the Lakers know that Kareem
doesn't deserve that pain.
"Go the distance."
Wait. . .1 know who's been making
those whispers.
With Larry Bird on the shell' this
season, the NBA's list of deluxe-super
elite attractions was reduced to two
Jordan and the Lakers' Magic Johnson.
Who else would be whispering "Go the
distance," but CBS.
Brad Daugherty and Kevin Johnson
are among the many great young players
that have arrived, but a Cleveland-
Phoenix series would not exactly be tan
talizing to the upper brass at CBS. It
makes sense that they would want Jordan
and Johnson to play as many games as
possible.
Therefore, before each seven-game
playoff, you can hear the powerful, om
niscient voice of CBS exhorting to prolong
the series as long as possible.
But if I may be so bold, I'd like to
venture something from out of my own
cornfield, specifically for the Lakers.
"If you play it, you will win."
