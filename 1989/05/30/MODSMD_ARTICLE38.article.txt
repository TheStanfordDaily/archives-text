# Tarango-O'Brien tandem tumbles in semifinal
## 
### Cameron Macky Senior staff writer 
ATHENS, Ga. — Trevor Kronemann and
Jeff Tarango really don't like each other.
Actually, "don't like each other" isn't
strong enough.
How's this — when Stanford's Tarango
and UC-Irvine's Kronemann end up on the
same court, it's amazing how many times
the ball is "accidentally" hit at either
player's head — or other body parts.
In doubles, where the chances to inflict
major injury crop up, oh, every other point,
the action is even more intense. And things
were quite intense in Athens Saturday af
ternoon, when Kronemann and partner
Mike Briggs ended Tarango and Alex
O'Brien's dream of an undefeated season
by downing the Cardinal pair 6-3, 6-7, 6-3
in the NCAA doubles semifinals.
Things got heated early. With O'Brien
serving in the match's second game, the
score was 3-1 Irvine when Kronemann sent
a backhand return past Tarango. The ball
looked like it nicked the line, but Tarango
called it wide — the first of several close
calls that the crowd would disagree with.
Kronemann apparently begged to differ
as well — when Tarango lobbed on the
next point, Kronemann smashed the ball
off O'Brien's ankles, and then proceeded
to give the freshman a nice long stare and
a fist pump.
The Cardinal broke right back, and the
teams traded holds until O'Brien was serv
ing again. Tarango mishit a forehand on
the first point, and then fired a volley at
Kronemann's head. He missed, and the
ball landed out. Kronemann was wide on
the next service return, and then Briggs
fired a return at Tarango's head. He
missed, too. With the score tied, Tarango
missed two straight volleys to give the An
teaters a 4-2 lead.
Kronemann held to take the first set
three games later, coming back from a 3-0
deficit to do so. In the second set neither
team could break the other, but each side
did get in a few good shots. Among them:
Game 1: O'Brien serves at 2-0 to
Kronemann, who hits the hardest forehand
of the tournament right by Tarango. No
setup, no preparation, just "I'm-gonna-hit
the-living-hell-out-of-this-ball-and-
there's-nothing-you-can-do-about-it." Two
serving one.

Game 10: After a Kronemann ace, the
two sides stage a fantastic point, racing to
get to balls, volleying cleanly and playing
superb tennis — until Briggs finishes it
off with a forehand volley that smacks
Tarango right in the derriere. Five games
each.
Game 12: Briggs, serving to stay in the
set, climbs the proverbial ladder to smash
a Tarango lob. Three-one, and then O'Brien
nets a forehand for a tiebreaker.
In the breaker, Stanford took a 2-0 lead,
and then O'Brien made it 3-0 with a
screaming backhand volley that just missed
Kronemann's nose. The two were only
inches apart at the net, and Kronemann
did well just to get his face out of the way.
On the next point, O'Brien hit a weak
lob back to the net — right where
Kronemann was standing. Tarango hap
pened to be about two feet away at the
time. Does it take a nuclear physicist to
figure out what happened next? Tarango
ducked and rolled into the net, and
Kronemann smashed it home, right over
Tarango's head.
The 3-1 lead went to 6-3, and the set
was over when Tarango came up with a
serve that Briggs couldn't handle.
Kronemann had his serve broken for the
first (and only) time in the next game,
and, when Tarango blew a serve by Briggs
to go up 3-1 in game two, it looked like
Stanford was about to take a 2-0 lead.
However, Kronemann scored on a return,
and then again with a backhand into the
deep left corner. At three-all, Tarango gave
the break back when he put a backhand
in the net.
Breaking Briggs, which Stanford then
did, would turn out to be small consolation.
"That [second] game was the critical one,"
Stanford Coach Dick Gould said.
"They broke again, and if they had gone
up 4-0. . . ." But they didn't. O'Brien held
serve to make it 3-1, but that was the last
hurrah.
Kronemann held, and then Tarango was
broken to get back on serve. Briggs held,
and then, with O'Brien serving on a three
all point, Kronemann killed a service
return. The answering volley hit the net,
and Irvine was up 5-3.
Kronemann, serving for the match,
crushed a volley to go up three-zip, and

Card notes
Just up the road a piece from Ath
ens is the town of Between. Would
Abbott and Costello die for this place,
or what?
So, Lou, where do you live?
I live in Between.
In between what?
In Between, Georgia.

In between Georgia and what?
I only live in one place, Bud —
Between.
1 realize that. But between what and
what?
Just Between, Georgia.
You can't be between one thing!
You've gotta be between two things!
Not if there's only one town.
Where?
Between.
I'm not starting that again. How
many people live in your hometown?
There are 835 people in Between.
Now stop that, Lou! In between what
and what?
In Between, Georgia, and nowhere
else. Y'know, Bud . . .
The possibilities are infinite.
