They had good meets;
they needed great ones.
Indeed, track and field
stars Marcus Hickerson,
Steve Miller and Dave
Strang came within breath
ing distance of qualifying for
the NCAA championships
this past weekend. Breath
ing distance, however, was
not good enough.
Strang and Miller, who
both participated in the Last
Chance Twilight Invitation
al, missed qualifying by a
matter of seconds. Strang
ran a 1:49.00 in 800 meters,
missing the NCAA qualify
ing mark of 1:47.86 bv a
little over a second.
"1 was on time with just
'200 meters to go," Strang
said. "My body just decided
it didn't want to go any 112 ur
ther."
Miller, who was trying to
qualify in the 3000-meter
steeplechase, ran a 8:56.00.
He just had come off a
Pacific 10 Conference Cham
pionship meet in which he
hurdled to a time of 8:48.52,
just 0.52 over the NCAA
qualifying mark
"I guess I was tired com
ing off the race on Saturday
in the Pac-lOs," Miller said
Hickerson, on the other
hand, participated in the
long jump of the world-class
Jenner Meet this past week
end.
Hickerson finished the
meet with a best jump of
25-Vb.
"I was pleased with the
meet but was expecting to
do better," Hickerson said
"Next year I definitely plan
on qualifying. I will keep
trying over the summer."
