## Only finicky students will not get housed

Officials at the Housing Center predict
clear skies ahead for students seeking
on-campus residency next fall based on
Round Two Draw results.
Up 8 percent from last year, 89 percent
of undergraduates secured residency on
campus after the second round of the
annual lottery system for University
housing. In addition, 84 percent of grad
uate students received an assignment.
Director of Housing Roger Whitney
said he is optimistic that the Housing
Center will assign any graduate or
undergraduate student — even those not
guaranteed housing — to an on-campus
residence early next September if the
student is willing to live anywhere on
campus.
Cut-off numbers show the dramatic
results of this year's Draw. Last year,
only women who drew under 3,892
gained housing, while this year those
who drew as high as 4,475 received an
assignment. The men's cutoff point
jumped from 3,676 last year to 4,169
this year.
Of the 2,500 students entering the
one-round lottery for graduate housing,
400 remain unassigned. Whitney said
most of those unassigned were "very
restrictive" in their choice of residences.
All first-year graduate students, families
and women who said they would live
anywhere were assigned to housing, as
were most married students without
children.

As usually happens, Whitney said, 400
undergraduates dropped out of One
Round of the Draw to join fraternities,
become resident assistants, go overseas
or stop out, creating vacancies after
Round One assignments were made.
There are still seven spaces for women
in the Alpha Sig House after Round
Two. "That's an unusual number for
that house, but we usually have 25-30
vacancies in this system," Whitney said.
Terra House and Haus Mitteleuropa
each have one vacant spot, for women
and men respectively.
Because students got priorities be
tween rounds, certain houses — such as
ZAP House — were harder to get into
during the second round, but this af
fected women only.
Most houses opened up during the
second round. For men, Faisan House
drew 2,468, while it fell to 3,608 in
Round Two. Faisan also opened up for
women in the second round, falling from
2,720 to 2,964.
The increase in the number of stu
dents assigned to housing this year is
due to several changes in the housing
system.
Next year's seniors make up the last
class to be offered a priority for a res
idence in which they previously lived.
"The cloud of inequality has been lifted
from the Draw," Whitney said of the
elimination of the Returning Residency
Priority.
