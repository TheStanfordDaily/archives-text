# Sloppy final day halts golfers' advance
## 
### David Hirning Staff writer 
It was very simple. All that the
Stanford men's golf team had to
do Saturday was golf as well as
it had the previous two rounds at
the NCAA West Regional and it
would be in the NCAA Champi
onships.
But, somehow, the plans went
awry. The wind kicked up at the
El Paso Country Club, and the
Cardinal went down, falling six
places and finishing 12th in the
16-team field. The top nine teams
qualified. It was a hard pill to
swallow.
"It was just like what has been
happening all year," said Brad
Geer, who will be back for his
final year of eligibility next year.
"We have one bad round that kills
us, and I don't know why. Golf
is not a team sport; there's no
reason the scores should fluctuate
together."
Usually the bad round has fal
len in the middle of a tournament,
but Stanford Coach Wally Good
win was aware of this and took
preventive measures. But what he
could not prevent was the 30 mph
winds that blew on Saturday, be
cause of an NCAA rule restricting
travel before the NCAAs.
"I knew we had to prepare for
the wind," he said, "but because
of (the rule) I couldn't take the
guys to Pleasanton or places
where the wind really blows."
The wind had only been a factor
in the afternoons on Thursday
and Friday, and the Cardinal man
aged to escape this period and
come out with rounds of 289 and
287 to put it in the middle of
things at 576. Fresno and UTEP
were tied with Stanford, while
BYU was a shot back at 577.
"Sixth place — that was really

good for us," junior Don Chris
tensen said. "I thought that if we
played well we might sneak in
eighth or ninth, but for two days
there we were playing right with
the best teams in the country. We
should take credit for that."
Brad Benbrook certainly has to
take credit for a great tourna
ment. After the first two rounds,
the junior (playing at No. 5 for
Stanford) had a pair of 69s and
was only two shots out of the lead
in second place.
Stanford's strategy was not to
come out tentative and just try
to keep from falling. "We were
aiming at the teams directly ahead
of us," junior Mark Funseth said.
"We didn't want just a mediocre
round."
But the wind put an end to this
strategy. "On a calm day, we
would have qualified because it
would have been easier to play
aggressively," Geer said. "But we
had a bad start and we couldn't
make up the strokes on the way
in because of the wind."
The greens on the course were
not much of a help in this situa
tion. "The greens were small and
so severe, if you missed them you
were in trouble," Funseth said.
"It put a lot of pressure on the
long game, because I thought 'If
I don't hit the green, I'm going
to make a bogey.'"
Of course, the long game was
what was affected by the wind
the most. "The guys had a hell
of a time keeping tee shots on the
fairway," Goodwin said.
"They had to adjust for the
wind, and manufacture shots
around trees. .. . The teams that
are used to playing in the wind
— the Arizona schools, BYU —
have the advantage."

pressure at last weekend's Western Regionals, finishing in the
middle of the pack.
