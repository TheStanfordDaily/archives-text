## 
### Ed Pike Staff writer 
The suspensions of Stanford
Asst. Track Coach John Powell
and former Stanford star Carol
Cady for competing in track
meets in South Africa last Oc
tober were upheld Thursday by
a federal judge in San Fran
cisco.
Powell had been suspended
from amateur competition for
six years and Cady for four by
The Athletic Congress along
with 14 others in January. The
athletes had defied the TAC's
ban on competition in South
Africa.
According to the TAC's
newsletter The Record, "Com
peting in South Africa violates
LAAF (International Amateur
Athletic Foundation) rules . . .
and TAC rules."
Powell is a four-time Olym
pian and Stanford's throwing
coach. As a coach, he was sub
ject to a heavier penalty.
Cady, a two-time Olympian,
graduated in 1984 and works
at the Medical Center as a re
searcher and still trains at
Stanford. The American record
holder in the women's discus,
she had already been disquali
fied from meets during her ap
peal and will be out until Oc
tober 15, 1993, if forced to
serve the entire suspension.
The TAC had denied a pre
vious appeal on March 12 by
a vote of 67-4. Powell and Cady
hoped to be reinstated in time
for the TAC outdoor champi
onships in Houston.
Cady defended her participa
tion, as the multi-racial com
petitions were open to both
black and white athletes in
violation of South African
apartheid laws. "We broke their
laws" by fielding an inter-racial
team and competing against

South African black and white
athletes on an equal footing,
Cady said before the decision.
Powell and Cady had hoped
to be reinstated in time for the
TAC Championships in Hous
ton, and brought legal action
against the TAC ruling.
However, U.S. District Court
Judge Samuel Conti, a former
Stanford athlete, denied their
claim that the suspensions il
legally violated their constitu
tional liberties. According to
the ruling, the TAC cannot be
held liable for alleged violations
because it is not a government
entity.
In addition, the decision said
that the TAC had not acted in
violation of its by laws in hand
ing down the suspension.
Cady has advocated a policy
that could be described as con
structive engagement, to bring
blacks and whites together in
sporting competition and dem
onstrate to the South Africans
the fallacy of apartheid.
"We need to educate their
athletes," she said.
According to Cady's Novem
ber 6th viewpoint in the New
York Times, reprinted in the
South African press, financial
considerations also played a
part in the decision.
"In addition to a substancial
payment for making the trip,
there was a free trip to South
Africa, a bonus of $2,000 for
breaking a South African
record and a prize of $300 for
first place in all events," the
viewpoint stated.
Similar opportunities to sup
port one's training are not
available in the United States,
Cady said later.
Powell has already had a long
throwing career, but Cady is
still close to her prime. Still,
she expressed a feeling that
perhaps it was time to move
on even before the ruling.
