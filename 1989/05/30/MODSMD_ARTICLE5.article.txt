# Chinese community raises funds, rallies support
## Students pledge to continue their support of university protesters in Beijing 
### Jennifer Schmid Staff writer 
Stanford Chinese students have been
busy raising money and rallying sup
port for their fellow students back
home.
And despite the government crack
down in Beijing that may lead to the
arrest of hundreds of student protest
leaders, the Stanford Chinese commu
nity pledges to continue its fund
raising efforts.
According to Xueguang Ghou, a
sociology graduate student, students
here must "wait and see how severe
the Chinese government crackdown is,
but we won't stop our support. . . . We
will still send donations and informa
tion, and organize activities to show
our support."
Douglas Pan, a graduate student
who is coordinating the Stanford fund

raising efforts, said the Chinese com
munity here has raised about $26,000
so far.
Stanford students have held a mul
titude of fund-raising and other activ
ities to support the student protesters.
Activities in the past week have in
cluded:
• A benefit concert at the Chinese-
American Cultural Center in Sunny
vale last Friday with performances by
both students and Chinese artists who
have settled in the Bay Area.
• Two demonstrations in San Fran
cisco in order to raise money and show
support. More than a hundred stu
dents attended a rally Sunday in front
of the Chinese consulate. The rally
was timed to coincide with demonstra
tions across the country and in Beijing.
• Full-page advertisements in the
Center Daily News and the World Jour

nal, the two major Chinese language
newspapers in the United States. The
ads request donations for student sup
port and list student organizational
contacts across the country.
• Individual soliciting by members
of Stanford's Chinese community. This
includes requests for donations at
members' workplaces and at Chinese-
American businesses.
Pan said that while fund-raising ef
forts so far have focused on individual
contributions, he plans to concentrate
more on corporate donations in the
future as part of a long-term fund
raising effort.
In additon to fund-raising efforts,
students have sent letters to Congress
to urge "that force not be used by the
Chinese government against student
protesters," according to graduate stu
dent Weijia Wang.
Wang said letters signed by about

1,000 students and members of the
Stanford community were sent Thurs
day to Sen. Alan Cranston and Sen.
Pete Wilson, among others.
Graduate student Jun Li said a
group of students also tried unsuccess
fully to arrange a meeting with Uni
versity President Donald Kennedy last
week in order to report their concerns
and to ask Kennedy to express his
support for a peaceful resolution of
the conflict.
Li said he wasn't sure if the students
will still meet with Kennedy at this
point because student protesters are
withdrawing from Tiananmen Square
peacefully and the Chinese govern
ment has not used force against them.
Ghou said future plans for support
activities include another benefit con
cert to be held this weekend in San
Francisco and more coordinated ef
forts with other universities.
