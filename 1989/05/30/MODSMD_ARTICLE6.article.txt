# University digs in to fight Foothills erosion
## 
### Mike Habata 
Although nature lovers and hard-core
runners may be upset, the University
began overturning trails in the Dish
area several weeks ago in an effort to
halt the erosion caused by human traffic
and help prepare for restoring the nat
ural vegetation next fall.
According to Doug Williams, the
horse-riding ranger who patrols the
Stanford Foothills where the Dish is
located, the Lands Management Depart
ment plowed two kinds of 15- to 20-foot
wide tracks in the foothills region.
The first — firebreaks — slow the
spread of potential wildfires among the
dry grasses in the foothills. Though the
department plows such firebreaks an
nually, they were made wider this year
because of the particularly dry condi
tions due to the drought.
In addition, the smaller trails created
over the years by runners and hikers
were overturned to prevent further ero
sion of the land. According to Williams,
who is popularly known as the "foothills
ranger," the erosion is caused by "all

kinds of people: bikers, joggers, hikers,
general traffic."
After the plowing the former paths
will be reseeded in the fall and the
vegetation slowly restored.
The foothills region lies in an un
developed area bounded by Junipero
Serra Avenue and Interstate 280 on the
east and west, and Alpine Boulevard
and Page Mill Road on the north and
south.
The region is particularly valued be
cause so many other open areas in the
Bay Area have been closed for develop
ment during the past 10-15 years, Wil
liams said. He added that "generally,
the University's policy is to keep the
(foothills) area undeveloped."
The University's work in the foothills
coincides with a new policy implemented
several months ago restricting public
use of the region.
During spring break, the University
decided to enforce a policy banning
bicycles from the area, claiming that
the the bikes caused substantial envi
ronmental damage by eroding the foot
hills. In addition, smoking is now

prohibited and dogs must be leashed.
Another significant development is
that all users of the foothills must stay
on the established trails, which are
properly marked by signs at the
entrances to the region. It is largely for
this reason that the non-traditional
paths were overturned.
Before the new policies were intro
duced, the University officially required
foothills users to have permits. But,
because very few people were aware of
such regulations, the policy was not very
effective, Williams said. With the new
clearly marked signs, "We could start
citing people ... if we don't get coopera
tion," he added.
According to John Hagen, co
representative for the Stanford Students
for Environmental Action, students and
community members have been working
to plant and care for young oak trees
on several thousand acres.
"I think it's important to preserve
the foothills area ... to give people a
different perspective away from the ur
banization of the main campus," he
said
