### Paula Gani Staff writer 
Finding a new full-time Chicano dean
and making El Centro Chicano more
student-oriented are the main issues facing
Ana Mata and Leticia Valadez, who were
elected co-chairs of MEChA last night.
For Valadez, a sophomore, a theme of
continuity underlies her plans for next
year's Chicano/Latino community.
"Basically, we're just going to continue
with gains made this year," Valadez said.
"We've been working toward increasing
who MEChA is and what we represent."
Mata, a freshman, hopes to "work with
the new full-time dean and strengthen El
Centro Chicano with improved program
ming . . . making it a center for Chicano
students."
Valadez and Mata will replace current
chairs senior Gina Hernandez and sopho

more Delia Ibarra.
Valadez is currently MEChA's social/cul
tural committee chair and next year's
Chicano/Latino Orientation Committee co
ordinator. Mata has served as the co-chair
for the education rights committee.
Other officers elected last night include
freshman Noel Bravo, El Aguila coordina
tor; senior Julie Martinez, his
torian/secretary; freshman Alma Medina,
publicity coordinator; and senior Raul Al
varez and sophomore Moira Hernandez,
treasurers.
Expectations toward MEChA's future
are mixed among other members of the
Chicano/Latino community. Some Chicano
students said last night that MEChA does
not fully represent the concerns of all those
in the community.
According to junior Armando Cano, not
a member of MEChA, "As far as
MEChA goes, the goals are great.
But what we want is open
mindedness for the whole commu
nity so that more than one
viewpoint is taken into account."
Sophomore Miguel Canales, co
ordinator of Project Motivation â€”
a Chicano/Latino service group
that encourages youngsters to
continue schooling through col
lege, agreed. "I would like to see
more respect toward contribu
tions of other organizations such
as Project Motivation, Chicanos
in Health Education, etc., and
recognizing that there are other
Latino organizations working
towards building the Latino com
munity."
According to Valadez, many of
these concerns have already been
addressed. "I think we have done
that this year. We've done a lot
of talking to people. It's just con
tinuing with what we've done."
"Our role is to continue fighting
for the rights of Chicano stu
dents," said Valadez.
