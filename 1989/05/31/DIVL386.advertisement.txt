DON'T BE LEFT OUT
Daily staffers: Today is the last, that's right LAST,
day to sign up and pay for the banquet. You
cannot have the money taken out of your check,
you must pay cash. Up front. To B.K. or Alex. So
drop in and drop off a tenspot for Friday's fete.
Your spot at the banquet if you
don't pay by today.
