We
grow more
in two years
than most
companies grow
in 10.
In fact, we've doubled our revenues
for 10 of the past 11 years. We're
already larger in relational data
base that all our competitors
combined —including IBM. And our
goals for the future are equally
breathtaking. In five years we intend
to be the sole supplier of software to
the Fortune 50, and more. Our
overall aim is to be the world's top
software firm. So, if you're looking
for growth, look into Oracle.
We are currently recruiting for entry
level opportunities in Finance, Ad
ministration, Human Resources,
Technical Support, International
and other areas.
Oracle is the ideal place for bright,
self-motivated, visionary people to
begin their career. Please send your
resume for consideration to:
