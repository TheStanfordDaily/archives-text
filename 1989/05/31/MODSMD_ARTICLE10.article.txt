Hunger film premieres Sunday
"No Hunger in My Home," a new film
by graduate student Nancy Brink, will have
its premiere screening Sunday at Fairchild
Auditorium in the Stanford Medical Center.
In addition, the film will receive the Student
Academy Award Documentary Merit Award
the following week in Los Angeles.
The film profiles the experience of hunger
in the United States through three women's
stories: Nevida Butler, the director of the
Ecumenical Hunger Program; Donna, a pro
gram client and former community worker;
and Dr. Maxine Hayes, of the Physician
Task Force on Hunger in America.
"No Hunger in My Home" was filmed
primarily in East Palo Alto, Palo Alto and
Menlo Park, and features the Ecumenical
Hunger Program, the primary independent
emergency food program for East Palo Alto.
Additional filming was done at the Second

Harvest Food Bank of Santa Clara County
in San Jose, and at the Odessa Brown
Children's Clinic in Seattle.
Hospital displays art exhibit
An extensive — and expanding — art col
lection is adorning the walls of Stanford
Hospital for public and patient viewing.
The collection, which already numbers
more than 400 paintings and prints, has
four new irayor works by New York artist
Miriam Schapiro just installed in the atrium
lobby of the new wing of the hospital.
Schapiro's paper cut-out figures with a
collage overlay range in size from 4-by-6
feet to 5-by-7 feet, and were donated by
Linda and Tony Meier of Atherton. Linda
Meier is a member of the Board of Trustees
and the Board of Hospital Directors.
