# Bush calls summit a success
## NATO finally united on the short-range missiles issue 
### 
BONN, West Germany (AP) —
President Bush exulted yesterday
in the success of a NATO summit
that produced a united Western
front on both conventional and
nuclear weapons and smoothed
over a dispute with West Germany
in the process.
Bush flew to Bonn from Brus
sels where the 16-nation North
Atlantic Treaty Organization had
just forged a compromise on
short-range nuclear missiles. The
deal will keep some of the NATO
weapons deployed indefinitely
while providing a framework for
eventual negotiations with the
Soviets to reduce the stockpiles
once conventional weapons in Eu
rope are cut.
Bush met one-on-one in Bonn
with West German Chancellor
Helmut Kohl, who called the pres
ident "a friend among friends."
Bush said he was "very pleased
with the reaction to the NATO
decision."
In a triumphant mood, Bush
said the alliance had scored a

"double hit" with its decision on
the nuclear issue and its endorse
ment of his proposal for wide
spread reductions in troops and
conventional weapons based in
Europe.
The communique winding up
the 40th anniversary summit
meeting specified that only a "par
tial reduction" in battlefield nu
clear weapons would be pursued.
Bush said most people do not
realize the Soviets have a numer
ical advantage in such weapons,
and he challenged Soviet Presi
dent Mikhail Gorbachev to order
a unilateral cutback.
The call for only a "partial re
duction" was a setback for Kohl,
who had sought swift U.S.-Soviet
negotiations with the possible aim
of eliminating the missiles both
in NATO and the Warsaw Pact.
"There will be no third zero,"
Bush said. "Partial means par
tial."
The two other "zeroes" were in
the 1987 U.S.-Soviet treaty ban
ning two categories of

intermediate-range missiles.
Despite the tilt toward the U.S.
position, Kohl did not leave the
summit empty-handed. On a
related issue, Bush and British
Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher agreed to postpone
modernization of the U.S.-built
Lance launchers that are deployed
mostly in West Germany.
Bush and Thatcher had wanted
to more than triple the range of
the Lances, but at West Ger
many's urging the allies decided
to postpone any modernization
until 1992. At that point, the com
munique said, "the introduction
and deployment of a follow-on sys
tem for the Lance will be dealt
with in 1992 in the light of overall
security developments."
Kohl used remarks at a state
dinner yesterday evening to reas
sure the West that his country is
not "romantically and dreamily
looking toward the East." Affirm
ing West Germany's solid support
for NATO, Kohl said: "We are not
wanderers between two worlds."
