TOKYO (AP) - A Marine
helicopter crashed at sea during
night training operations off
Okinawa, and 14 of the 22
Marines aboard are missing, a
U.S. military spokesman said
today.
Of the eight Marines rescued,
four were reported injured.
The CH-46 Sea Knight helicop
ter, based in Kaneohe Bay,
Hawaii, had just taken off shortly
before midnight Tuesday from the
USS Denver off Okinawa, said

Marine Master Sgt. Jake
Rodrigues, spokesman for U.S.
Forces, Japan.
He said the crash occurred at
about 11:55 p.m. Tuesday local
time about 33 miles south of
Kadena Air Force base in Okinawa
during a routine amphibious
training exercise.
Rodrigues said the helicopter
was carrying a crew of four and
18 Marine passengers. The 18
being transported were assigned
to 2nd Battalion, 3rd Marine Regi

ment, Okinawa, for six months as
part of a unit rotation program.
In Washington, Marine Corps
spokesman Lt. Col. Fred Peck said
the helicopter "pitched over to the
right and went into the water in
verted, upside down. I have noth
ing to indicate why it did that."
Peck said the four injured men
were being treated aboard the
Denver, an amphibious transport
dock designed for use in am
phibious assaults and capable of
carrying up to six CH-46 helicop

ters. The CH-46 is built by
Boeing.
The cause of the crash was un
der investigation, the Navy said
in a statement. The helicopter was
assigned to Marine Medium
Helicopter Squadron 265.
The victims' names were with
held pending notification of next
of kin, the Navy said.
Rodrigues said recovery opera
tions were being conduct by the
Denver.
The helicopter went down 9U

miles southeast of Kiyan Cape,
said Nagatoshi Naruse, spokes
man for the Maritime Safety
Agency, Japan's coast guard.
He said three Japanese aircraft
and six Maritime Safety Agency
patrol boats joined two U.S. ves
sels and three U.S. aircraft in the
search.
Searchers marked the crash site
with green dye in the water, but
there was no sign of the helicopter
on the surface, Naruse said.
The latest tragedy came after
fires aboard three U.S. warships

killed 55 sailors in a 25-day period
earlier this spring.
On April 19, an explosion and
fire in a gun turret killed 47
sailors aboard the Norfolk-based
battleship lowa off Puerto Rico.
Six sailors died in an engine
room fire on the supply ship
White Plains in the South China
Sea on May 9.
On May 13, an explosion and
fire in a jet fuel pump room killed
two sailors aboard the aircraft
carrier America as it cruised in
the Atlantic Ocean.
