## Unequal justice 
### 
EQUAL OFFENSES war
rant equal punishment.
University President
Donald Kennedy demonstrated
flawed logic Thursday on KZSU
by saying the different roles
played by the students who occu
pied his office will affect the
severity of penalties they might
receive.
Kennedy has already said that
everyone will be investigated un
der the same University policy:
violating the campus disruption
code. So it is odd that he should
now look to distribute distinctly
different punishments to different
students.
If he proceeded with his plan,
it would mean playing pick and
choose with the application of the
University's legal system, be
cause the occupation was the
result of collective planning and

execution.
Most logically, Kennedy — who
will ultimately decide what
punishments are levied against
students — should look at the
protesters as equals who merit
equal treatment.
He should also keep in mind
that they were demonstrating be
cause of their commitment to the
Agenda for Action, 13 demands
they believe will improve educa
tion for everyone at Stanford.
It logically follows, then, that
students who are only trying to
improve their situation at the
University should be allowed to
do so without fear of reprisals
that would hurt their education.
Thus the only fair treatment for
these protesters — all of them
— is to not levy any penalties
against them.
