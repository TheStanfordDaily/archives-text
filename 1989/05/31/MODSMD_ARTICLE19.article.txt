CONGRATULATIONS TO
the Asian American Stu
dents Association on the
successful resolution of its long
and frustrating struggle to bring
a professor of Asian-American
studies to Stanford.
The announcement last week
that the provost was committing
the money for a tenure-track po
sition is a tribute to the Asian-
American community at Stan
ford.
In 1985, a group of Asian-
American students developed and
taught a SWOPSI class on Asian-
American history. The following
year, they overcame the initial
objections of faculty and con
vinced the History Department
to offer such a class on a one-time
basis. In 1987, the department

committed to full recognition of
the class and inclusion of it in
"Courses and Degrees."
In the course of their most
recent efforts, AASA members
collected 1,000 signatures on
petitions and met several times
with faculty and administrators.
But they still had to watch the
popular and well-qualified pro
fessor Gordon Chang leave be
cause he was granted a ten
ure-track position at UC-Irvine
and not at Stanford.
No education can be complete
without some understanding of
the importance of the struggles,
literature and culture of Asian-
Americans. Because of AASA, we
are on the way to incorporating
that body of knowledge into our
curriculum.
