# Protesters face charges outside the Standard
## 
### John Wagner Editorial staff 
Formal charges of violating the Univer
sity's policy on campus disruption will be
mailed today to about 60 students who
participated in the May 15 takeover of
University President Donald Kennedy's of
fice, Judicial Affairs Officer Sally Cole told
The Daily yesterday.
However, the students are not being
charged with violating the Fundamental
Standard, Cole said.
Since the takeover, protesters have been
demanding amnesty from Fundamental
Standard charges, arguing that it is
hypocritical for the University to use the
Standard to punish students working for
change, and not use the Standard to punish
students who committed racist acts earlier
this year.
But Cole said yesterday that the entire
judicial investigation of the takeover has
focused on the campus disruption policy
— a policy which she said is "distinct"
from the Fundamental Standard.
Cole is the University official responsible
for charging students with conduct viola
tions.
According to junior David Brown, a
Council of Presidents member and a
protester, by divorcing the disruption policy

from the Fundamental Standard, the ad
ministration is trying to duck the charges
of hypocrisy they have faced for using the
Standard against the protesters.
Brown said that in discussions with stu
dents, the administration had said protest
ers were facing Fundamental Standard
charges.
According to COP member and protester
Stacey Leyton, students had been told that
the campus disruption policy was "part of
the Fundamental Standard."
"Now all of a sudden it's different,"
Brown said. "The administration is making
up the rules as they go along."
Kennedy: 'No surprise'
Kennedy told The Daily last night that
he had "repeatedly" told students involved
in the takeover that they would be facing
charges stemming from the campus dis
ruption policy. "I can't imagine it comes
as a surprise," he said.
"Of course there has been no change in
tactics."
Dean of Student Affairs James Lyons
said he was not sure why students even
thought they would be charged under the
Fundamental Standard. "Nobody that I'm
aware of ever said they would be," he said.
The policy on campus disrup
tion states that it is a violation
of University policy to "prevent
or disrupt. . . the conduct of Uni
versity business in a University
office."
Those charged under the policy
are subject to the same judicial
process as those charged under
the Fundamental Standard, and
both carry the same broad range
of possible punishments — from
a letter of reprimand to expulsion.
But the disruption policy con
tains a list of explicit violations,
while the Standard serves as a
more general code of conduct, ac
cording to Lyons.
Furthermore, Lyons said, the
Fundamental Standard is applica
ble only to students, while the
policy on campus disruption ap
plies to faculty, staff and students.
Kennedy said that although the
disruption policy can be consid
ered "a particularization" of the
Standard when applied to stu
dents, "in the strict sense it's not
part of the Fundamental Stand
ard."
According to Lyons, "The dis
ruption policy stands solely on its

own feet."
On the day of the takeover, May
15, Cole told The Daily that the
policy on campus disruptions was
"an application of the iNindamen
tal Standard."
Yesterday, she said the two
were technically distinct policies
and that the "relationship be
tween them is more philosophi
cal."
Semantics not important
According to Leyton, a senior,
the semantics of the charges are
not that important. "It doesn't
really matter to us that much
what they call it," she said. "It's
still hypocritical and it's still
wrong."
Sophomore Louis Jackson, a
Black Student Union member and
a protester who was not arrested
in the takeover, agreed with
Leyton that the precise charges
were not that significant. "I
doesn't make a whole lot of dif
ference," he said. "I'm not even
sure what the distinction is."
Jackson said his main concern
was that the administration take
"motivating factors" into account
when distributing penalties.
Kennedy said last week that
students' motives would be taken
into account in assessing
penalties. "There are obviously

questions of how one takes mo
tives (and) other possible mitigat
ing factors into account," he said.
"That comes at the end of
proceedings like this — not the
beginning."
Singling out students
The Agenda for Action coalition,
which staged the takeover of Ken
nedy's office, will hold a press con
ference 6 p.m. today. According to
a statement released yesterday by
the coalition, the group will urge
the administration not to single
out students for punishment.
According to the statement,
"Kennedy has said that the Uni
versity will issue different punish
ments for different actions. This
tactic many view as unacceptable
and see as a move to further in
timidate and isolate the partici
pants in the action."
Cole said yesterday that differ
ent students had been charged dif
ferently under the campus disrup
tion policy. "The letters [the stu
dents will receivel are not identi
cal," she said.
Kennedy told The Daily that
the different actions of those in
volved in the takeover would be
taken into consideration during
the judicial process.
"If Student A and Student B
did different things, they will be

treated differently," he said.
Kennedy said that students
would not be differentiated on the
basis of their leadership roles in
the organizations which partici
pated in the takeover. "Action, not
status," will be used to differen
tiate the protesters, he said.
Two judicial options
According to Lyons, students
charged under the campus disrup
tion policy are being granted two
options under the judicial process:
They may agree to the facts from
the investigation and have the Of
fice of Student Affairs recommend
a penalty, or they may contest the
facts, go to a hearing officer and
then have the Stanford Judicial
Council recommend a penalty.
Lyons said seniors who went
through the first channel could
have their cases decided before
Commencement. He said his office
would be willing to handle the
cases of graduating seniors first
at their request.
Other students going through
the first channel should be given
a decison by the end of June,
Lyons said.
If students choose to go through
the Judicial Council, he said, the
process would not even begin until
next fall.
Formal charges of violating the Univer

Formal charges of violating the Univer
sity's policy on campus disruption will be
mailed today to about 60 students who
participated in the May 15 takeover of
University President Donald Kennedy's of
fice, Judicial Affairs Officer Sally Cole told
The Daily yesterday.
However, the students are not being
charged with violating the Fundamental
Standard, Cole said.
Since the takeover, protesters have been
demanding amnesty from Fundamental
Standard charges, arguing that it is
hypocritical for the University to use the
Standard to punish students working for
change, and not use the Standard to punish
students who committed racist acts earlier
this year.
But Cole said yesterday that the entire
judicial investigation of the takeover has
focused on the campus disruption policy
— a policy which she said is "distinct"
from the Fundamental Standard.
Cole is the University official responsible
for charging students with conduct viola
tions.
According to junior David Brown, a
Council of Presidents member and a
protester, by divorcing the disruption policy

from the Fundamental Standard, the ad
ministration is trying to duck the charges
of hypocrisy they have faced for using the
Standard against the protesters.
Brown said that in discussions with stu
dents, the administration had said protest
ers were facing Fundamental Standard
charges.
According to COP member and protester
Stacey Leyton, students had been told that
the campus disruption policy was "part of
the Fundamental Standard."
"Now all of a sudden it's different,"
Brown said. "The administration is making
up the rules as they go along."
Kennedy: 'No surprise'
Kennedy told The Daily last night that
he had "repeatedly" told students involved
in the takeover that they would be facing
charges stemming from the campus dis
ruption policy. "I can't imagine it comes
as a surprise," he said.
"Of course there has been no change in
tactics."
Dean of Student Affairs James Lyons
said he was not sure why students even
thought they would be charged under the
Fundamental Standard. "Nobody that I'm
aware of ever said they would be," he said.
The policy on campus disrup
tion states that it is a violation
of University policy to "prevent
or disrupt. . . the conduct of Uni
versity business in a University
office."
Those charged under the policy
are subject to the same judicial
process as those charged under
the Fundamental Standard, and
both carry the same broad range
of possible punishments — from
a letter of reprimand to expulsion.
But the disruption policy con
tains a list of explicit violations,
while the Standard serves as a
more general code of conduct, ac
cording to Lyons.
Furthermore, Lyons said, the
Fundamental Standard is applica
ble only to students, while the
policy on campus disruption ap
plies to faculty, staff and students.
Kennedy said that although the
disruption policy can be consid
ered "a particularization" of the
Standard when applied to stu
dents, "in the strict sense it's not
part of the Fundamental Stand
ard."
According to Lyons, "The dis
ruption policy stands solely on its

own feet."
On the day of the takeover, May
15, Cole told The Daily that the
policy on campus disruptions was
"an application of the iNindamen
tal Standard."
Yesterday, she said the two
were technically distinct policies
and that the "relationship be
tween them is more philosophi
cal."
Semantics not important
According to Leyton, a senior,
the semantics of the charges are
not that important. "It doesn't
really matter to us that much
what they call it," she said. "It's
still hypocritical and it's still
wrong."
Sophomore Louis Jackson, a
Black Student Union member and
a protester who was not arrested
in the takeover, agreed with
Leyton that the precise charges
were not that significant. "I
doesn't make a whole lot of dif
ference," he said. "I'm not even
sure what the distinction is."
Jackson said his main concern
was that the administration take
"motivating factors" into account
when distributing penalties.
Kennedy said last week that
students' motives would be taken
into account in assessing
penalties. "There are obviously

questions of how one takes mo
tives (and) other possible mitigat
ing factors into account," he said.
"That comes at the end of
proceedings like this — not the
beginning."
Singling out students
The Agenda for Action coalition,
which staged the takeover of Ken
nedy's office, will hold a press con
ference 6 p.m. today. According to
a statement released yesterday by
the coalition, the group will urge
the administration not to single
out students for punishment.
According to the statement,
"Kennedy has said that the Uni
versity will issue different punish
ments for different actions. This
tactic many view as unacceptable
and see as a move to further in
timidate and isolate the partici
pants in the action."
Cole said yesterday that differ
ent students had been charged dif
ferently under the campus disrup
tion policy. "The letters [the stu
dents will receivel are not identi
cal," she said.
Kennedy told The Daily that
the different actions of those in
volved in the takeover would be
taken into consideration during
the judicial process.
"If Student A and Student B
did different things, they will be

treated differently," he said.
Kennedy said that students
would not be differentiated on the
basis of their leadership roles in
the organizations which partici
pated in the takeover. "Action, not
status," will be used to differen
tiate the protesters, he said.
Two judicial options
According to Lyons, students
charged under the campus disrup
tion policy are being granted two
options under the judicial process:
They may agree to the facts from
the investigation and have the Of
fice of Student Affairs recommend
a penalty, or they may contest the
facts, go to a hearing officer and
then have the Stanford Judicial
Council recommend a penalty.
Lyons said seniors who went
through the first channel could
have their cases decided before
Commencement. He said his office
would be willing to handle the
cases of graduating seniors first
at their request.
Other students going through
the first channel should be given
a decison by the end of June,
Lyons said.
If students choose to go through
the Judicial Council, he said, the
process would not even begin until
next fall.
