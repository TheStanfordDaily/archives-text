# Protesters face charges outside the Standard

### John Wagner Editorial staff 
Formal charges of violating the Univer
sity's policy on campus disruption will be
mailed today to about 60 students who
participated in the May 15 takeover of
University President Donald Kennedy's of
fice, Judicial Affairs Officer Sally Cole told
The Daily yesterday.
However, the students are not being
charged with violating the Fundamental
Standard, Cole said.
Since the takeover, protesters have been
demanding amnesty from Fundamental
Standard charges, arguing that it is
hypocritical for the University to use the
Standard to punish students working for
change, and not use the Standard to punish
students who committed racist acts earlier
this year.
But Cole said yesterday that the entire
judicial investigation of the takeover has
focused on the campus disruption policy
â€” a policy which she said is "distinct"
from the Fundamental Standard.
Cole is the University official responsible
for charging students with conduct viola
tions.
According to junior David Brown, a
Council of Presidents member and a
protester, by divorcing the disruption policy

from the Fundamental Standard, the ad
ministration is trying to duck the charges
of hypocrisy they have faced for using the
Standard against the protesters.
Brown said that in discussions with stu
dents, the administration had said protest
ers were facing Fundamental Standard
charges.
According to COP member and protester
Stacey Leyton, students had been told that
the campus disruption policy was "part of
the Fundamental Standard."
"Now all of a sudden it's different,"
Brown said. "The administration is making
up the rules as they go along."
Kennedy: 'No surprise'
Kennedy told The Daily last night that
he had "repeatedly" told students involved
in the takeover that they would be facing
charges stemming from the campus dis
ruption policy. "I can't imagine it comes
as a surprise," he said.
"Of course there has been no change in
tactics."
Dean of Student Affairs James Lyons
said he was not sure why students even
thought they would be charged under the
Fundamental Standard. "Nobody that I'm
aware of ever said they would be," he said.
