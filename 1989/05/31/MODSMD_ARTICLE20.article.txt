## COP involvement in protest was a breach of trust 
### 
THE PURPOSE OF this letter is
not to criticize or support the
actions which have been taken by
the new Agenda for Action Coalition.
We find that, like most students on
campus, we have mixed feelings about
the various goals and actions the group
promotes. In this letter we wish to
focus upon the actions taken by the
People's Platform Council of Presi
dents.
The May 22 article revealed many
little-known facts about the COP's
actions in the May 15 takeover. It has
become evident that the COP has used
its access, funding and visibility in a
manner that is more than questiona
ble.
Current COP member Stacy Leyton
exploited her familiarity with the
President's Office, a familiarity that
arises from frequent communication
with the administration despite griev
ances of lack of accessibility, to
facilitate the takeover.

The COP further illustrated its
willingness to utilize its ASSU accounts
to provide bail money for the protest
ers, pay for impoundment and repairs
to a van used in the protest and to
print the fliers publicizing the event.
As The Daily pointed out, the
utilization of ASSU funding for these
causes is not a breach of the ASSU
Bylaws. The manner in which the COP
gained access to Building 10 was,
however, a breach of the trust that
had been invested in the COP by the
administration.
The utilization of ASSU funds to
support unlawful activities was a
breach of the trust invested in the
COP by the students. It is through
trust and willingness to work together,
not as adversaries, that progress can
be made.
The takeover has seriously shaken
the COP's credibility in a way which
will take a great while to mend. The
fact that next year's People's Platform

COP members were among those
planning and participating in the
incident assures that this rift will
remain through next year.
COP member David Brown's state
ment that the group is willing to do
"whatever it takes" to implement the
demands made implies that the group
may be willing to go beyond just
breaking the law and diverting ASSU
funds to champion their cause.
Statements like this and attempts to
coerce the administration do not reflect
the COP's willingness to work as the
liason for constructive dialogue be
tween the students and the administra
tion.
Ingrid Nava, People's Platform COP
member-elect, states, "I feel like people
who got us elected were students of
color . . . We feel that the people who
are really active, who are really con
cerned about these changes are the
people who we are accountable to, the
people who elected us."

It is important that the COP realize
that they are "accountable" not just to
the 2,500 who voted for them, but also
to the 9,500 who did not. We gladly
support positive change in this impor
tant area, but hope the People's Plat
form realizes that its actions are repre
sentative of the entire student body and
their responsibility is to be accountable
to all of us.
We recognize and respect the rights
of individuals and groups to stand up
for what they believe in. We are dis
mayed, however, by the apparent lack
of responsibility to the student body
and to their elected position the
People's Platform COP members, old
and new, have shown.
