# COP's agenda is valid and benefits all of Stanford
## 
### 
This year's Council of Presidents has
proven its commitment to serving the
Stanford community. The numerous
service projects that the members initi
ated and the issues they supported
stemmed from a vision of a better
Stanford.
The decision of two of the COP
members to take part in the May 15
Agenda for Action Coalition sit-in fur
ther illustrates the COP commitment
to supporting issues that concern the
Stanford community. All of the major
demands of the Agenda for Action in

volved the simple principles of democ
racy and better education.
Moreover, the COP took action on
May 15 confident that most of the
Stanford community would support the
struggle for ethnic studies, faculty of
color and a democratic full-time dean
selection process. They took a stand for
what they knew was right and for
what the Stanford community believed
in.
The COP has been accused of having
a political agenda, and indeed it does
â€” an agenda committed to making
Stanford better. They've worked hard
to make the COP an important
resource that can serve the entire
Stanford community. In so doing,
they've done an excellent job in reach
ing out to the communities of color.
Their efforts have been greatly ap
preciated, especially in light of the

problems that had existed between the
communities of color and other COPs
of the recent past. The service projects
they administered, the issues they sup
ported and events they participated in
were all founded on the vision of a
multicultural, more inclusive, better
Stanford.
