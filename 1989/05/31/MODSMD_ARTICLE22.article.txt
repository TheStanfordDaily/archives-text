# This year's COP gets high marks for responsibility
## 
### 
I am writing to express my full sup
port of our COP members and
members-elect who participated in the

May 15 peaceful takeover of the Presi
dent's Office.
Throughout this year of commitment
to the ASSU, the COP has been con
sistently accountable and responsible
and has held firm to the convictions of
the platform on which they were
elected by the student body.
At the same time, they have main
tained strong communication with the
student body through their establish
ment of dorm contacts and surveys.
I feel that their stand on the issues
of the Agenda for Action and their
participation in the takeover is an
other example of their consistent per
formance throughout this year. I am
also very confident in next year's COP
after seeing their firm conviction on
May 15.
