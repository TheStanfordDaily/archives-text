## To strive, care and see 
### 
I'M THINKING ABOUT a Peace
Corps internship application I didn't
fill out, thinking about one of the
essay questions I didn't answer.
The question asks you to list and to
comment on five qualities or values which
are most important to you. What is im
plied in the question is that everyone
has a unique "dictionary" of words and
basic themes upon which they base their
life and actions. A person can almost be
"defined" by their few words.
I try to think of words and three verbs
immediately come to mind: to strive, to
care and to see.
To strive: The most relevant verb in
the world. "To strive" encompasses a lot
of territory Almost all of the great virtues
— determination, hard work, achieve
ment — can be summed up into this one
action, this one verb. Striving is not just
mere effort, it is human effort, what has
driven progress all along. When I think
of greatness, I picture someone who has
struggled and succeeded in going beyond
expectations.
Striving is not a mellow, comfortable
term. It's intense and discomforting, be
cause it implies a great effort beyond
simple happiness. But the reward of
seeing such a struggle bring about a won
derful result is unrivaled.
To care: This is the basic driving force
behind the whole concept of striving, be
hind anything important. What good is
anything — any goal, any class, any cause
— if you don't care about it? Care can
alleviate the pain of doing anything dif
ficult or exhausting, like studying, work
ing or just living, because it places great
worth on what you aim toward.

On the contrary, when you don't care
about something — a class you're taking
or a job you're doing — but you have to
continue, life becomes hellish misery.
Why? Because in the absence of care,
your "efforts" are focused on something
you place no value on, something that
is, to you, worthless. For example, when
ever I've tried to write about something
I didn't care about for this column, it
became a difficult and slow process.
Caring for a class is only possible if
you see it as an end in itself, and not as
a means to fulfilling a distribution re
quirement, degree requirement or a
career where you can get rich. "Do we
have to know this for the test? (If not,
I'll turn off my attention)."
My parents, unfortunately, sometimes
see my four years at this school in that
way. It seems to me that in their view,
Stanford is a means to a career. In fact,
they have a career in mind — medicine.
I told them that since I honestly care
about what I'm studying, which is sci
ence, I'm bound to end up OK no matter
what I end up doing. And because I care
about what I do now, I don't worry about
what my future life looks like, because
it will be based upon the strongest foun
dation — caring for what I do.
To see: And what good is it all, "it"
being what you care for and strive for,
if you can't see? What 1 mean by seeing
is not the literal, visual, of-themoment
sense, but rather the lasting sense of
understanding. Maybe the word should
be "to understand" instead of "to see."
But for some reason, the association be
tween understanding and seeing is very
strong for me.

Whenever I've tried to
write about something I
didn't care about for
this column, it became
a difficult and slow
process.

The importance of seeing is that by
opening your eyes to everything, you gain
an expansive view of the world and what
you care for. If you think about it, seeing
is indeed an art to be mastered. Perhaps
this seeing is something that we strive
for.
So much for that. To strive, to care,
to see. There's no way the Peace Corps
would have wanted me if I had answered
that essay question. Being capable of list
ing and defining your words really shows
an understanding of what you are made
of.
It's obvious that I am unclear about
the definitions of my words. But I do
believe that each person has a specific
set of words and themes that defines
him or her.

John Chuang is an undeclared sopho
more. This is his final column.
