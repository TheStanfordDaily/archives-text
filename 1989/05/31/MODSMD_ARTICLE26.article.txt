## Awareness of sexism in advertisements crucial 
### 
THE WOMEN ARE smiling. Three
of them in swimsuits are
stretched out full length on a
beach blanket. The one in the center
looking up at us (a ravishing blonde)
has "Africa, America, Asia" emblazoned
across her breasts like a banner in a
beauty contest.
The ones on either side of her have
been carefully placed so that their rear
ends are exposed to our scrutiny.
Great: We now have a front, back and
side view (pity, though, that the one in
the center has crossed her legs slight
ly).
No wonder they are smiling; they've
got it all — great looks, bodies men
kill for, the time and money to end
lessly bask in the sun with suntan
lotion, cool shades and CD Walkmans.
They even use their bodies to sell beer.
And thus they have the privilege of
having an enormous black "Budweiser,
King of Beers" stamped across their
collective abdomen, groin and buttocks
so that they have to remain perfectly
motionless like so many slabs of frozen

meat in order that the Bud logo be
aligned just so.
The full-page Budweiser advertise
ment hit me full force out of the pages
of the May 18 Daily, especially since
only two days before I had attended
Anne Simonton's powerful slide-and
talk presentation "Sex, Power and the
Media," part of Rape Awareness Week.
This ad exemplifies everything
Simonton had talked about: the
degradation and dehumanization of
women's bodies in the media, the
reduction of women to mere objects
who are obsessively concerned with
their own looks and who are always
sexually available, and perhaps most
dangerous of all, the portrayal of
women as passively accepting, even
welcoming, a suffocating male domi
nance.
It's not that a man who sees this ad
will go out and rape a woman; it's not
that simple. Rather, ads like this
create a climate in which both men
and women are desensitized to the
extent of their actually believing that

women are nothing more than passive
sexual objects to be manipulated for
any number of reasons.
And turning a human being into a
thing is almost always the first step
toward justifying violence against that
person.
The objectifying and stereotyping of
the male body in a small number of
advertisements is not threatening to
men to the same extent, since men
already hold the reins of power in
society; it's women who get the brunt
of it if they are exploited in the media.
Just as rape doesn't only involve
men jumping out of the bushes at
night, sexist images around us are by
no means confined to violent pornogra
phy. Sexism exists in everyday life:
using "he" for an unknown professor,
doctor or editor; labeling a "promis
cuous" woman a "slut" (a man is a
"stud"); creating fliers and advertise
ments that are demeaning to women;
tolerating and keeping silent about
fliers and advertisements around us
that are demeaning to women.

Of course, outright censorship and
the suppression of all sexuality is not
the ultimate solution to the problem.
Awareness is crucial. We should be
aware of the harmful cumulative im
pact of seemingly innocuous ads like
these as they constantly bombard us,
insidiously working their way into cur
psyches until they benumb our very
centers of respect and dignity for
others and for ourselves.

We feel confident that The Daily would
not print a blatantly racist advertise
ment. The Daily should give the same
consideration to blatantly sexist ads.
