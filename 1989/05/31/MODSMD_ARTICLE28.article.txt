Q # What is the foam on
• the rocks at the coast ?
is it caused by pollutants or
does it come from beaten
seagull eggs?
A. Unlike other foams
• such as styrofoam, the
foam along the California
coast is 100 percent organic
and contains neither beaten
seagull eggs nor pollutants.
According to Richard Bar
ber, director of the Monterey
Bay Aquarium and a Stan
ford graduate, organic ma
terials — mostly from kelp
— combine with the sea
water to form "natural sea
foam." The molecules of
these "surface active" or
ganic materials attach to the
water bubbles produced by
the breaking waves and
form the stable bubbles of
the foam.
On days of rough weather,
the bubbles last from one to

two days. On these days, the
crashing waves produce more
bubbles than usual. Also, the
foam might have a brownish color
because the waves beat out the
brownish pigment from the kelp.
Unlike some of the foam on
other coasts around the world,
caused by man-made pollutants,
the foam on the California coast
is a detergent and actually cleans
and washes skin.
The molecules cleanse the skin
because one end of the molecule
is attracted to oil and grease and
the other end has an affinity to
water. The tiny little molecules
get the grime and wash it away
in the water.
Penny-pinching college students
should stock up some "natural sea
foam" before health food stores
market it as "100 percent natural
soap."
Q.J don't mean to be disgust
• ing, but why is urine yellow,
as opposed to any other color ? And
why is it always yellow, regardless
of what you've consumed?
A. The distinct amber color of
• urine and yellow snow is a
pigment known as "urochrome,"

according to Nephrology Prof. Roy
MafTly.
If urine — commonly known as
"pee," "pee pee," or "number one"
— were packaged as food, the
label would read: water, products
of metabolism (e.g. urea and uric
acid, inorganic salts and yellow
coloring).
The source of the yellow pig
ment and its exact composition
are not well-known, Maffly said.
Urine tends to be lighter in
color when a person is over
hydrated, or has drunk a lot of
beer. Urine is darker when a per
son is dehydrated. The difference
in color is a result of the concen
tration of water in the urine, ac
cording to Dr. George Daniels, a
physician at the Stanford School
of Medicine.
According to obstetrician,
gynecologist and my very own
dad, Dr. Enrique Gutman, urine
sometimes gets mistaken for beer
or apple juice because of its yellow
coloring.
