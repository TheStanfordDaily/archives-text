## Stanford professor vies for most efficient solar cell 
### Brenda Hamilton 
In a hard-driven race, Electrical
Engineering Assoc. Prof. Richard
Swanson is vying with researchers
at Varian Associates to design the
world's most efficient solar cell.
"It's been a neck-and-neck com
petition with Varian," said Swan
son.
Until six months ago, Swanson
had held a two-year record with
a solar cell — also known as a
photovoltaic cell — boasting a 28.5
percent efficiency rating. Then,
Varian'B researchers designed a
cell that topped Swanson's by a
mere half-percent.
Now, Swanson's research team
has set its sights on a 30 percent
efficient cell to take the lead again,
which would approach the theo
retical limit of 33 percent.
The pieces necessary for creat
ing such a cell already exist, said
Swanson. He must only assemble
them in the right way to reduce
the heat lost when solar energy
is converted into electrical energy.
Smaller than a thumbnail and
costing about a dollar to produce,
Swanson's cell can be mounted
under a magnifying glass which
concentrates the sun's rays 500
times.
Such a cell, made of crystalline
silicon, can generate about six
watts of power, not yet enough
to power an ordinary light bulb.
Clusters of these cells can be
grouped together — each with a
lens and a mount — onto a tilting
panel that tracks the sun's move
ment across the sky.
Photons, or particles of light,
hit electrons in the silicon of each
cell. If the photons have enough
energy, depending on the
wavelength of the light, they can
knock electrons from the silicon
atoms. Known as the photoelectric
effect, this process was first ex
plained by Albert Einstein in
1905.
The electrons jolted loose leave
a "hole," a region of positive
charge, which can move just like
the electron.
If the electron makes its way
to one end of the solar cell and
the positive "hole" makes its way

to the other end, an electrical cur
rent is created.
Scientists hope that someday
this electric current can be har
nessed so large solar plants can
be created to provide a much
cleaner form of electricity than
coal-burning plants.
At present, the most useful ap
plications for solar cells are in
areas far from the reach of electric
plants.
For example, in developing na
tions these cells are the best en
ergy alternative to generate small
amounts of electricity which can
in turn be used to pump water.
Here, solar cells can be cheaper
than the expense of bringing in
electric lines from a distant city.
Swanson said local applications
include powering lights for high
way signs, parking lots, real estate
signs, home walkways and Coast
Guard buoys floating in the bay.
Some boats and recreational
vehicles now use these cells to
keep their batteries charged, while
powering lamps, radios and televi
sions.
Solar cells are commonly used
in watches and calculators, saving
consumers money by eliminating
the need to replace worn-out bat
teries.
Photovoltaics could be even
more useful during the hottest
months of the California summer,
he said, to help respond to the
peak demand for air conditioning
and prevent brown-outs.
The newest market for solar
cells has been for communication
stations on mountaintops, Swan
son said. Powered by photovolta
ics, microwave transmitters
permit people to make phone calls
across the Sierras while saving
phone companies the cost of put
ting up and maintaining telephone
poles in desolate, blizzard-prone
areas.
Phone booths in remote areas
of the Australian outback are even
powered by photovoltaic panels on
their roofs.
In addition, car shoppers can
buy the option of having a
photovoltaic panel built into the
sunroof of a new Volvo automo
bile. This panel would keep the

battery charged while simultane
ously operating a small fan to help
keep the car cool by circulating
the air inside.
Although the number of appli
cations for solar power have in
creased in the past few years, the
big impediment to widespread
photovoltaic use has been its cost,
Swanson said.
"The efficiency (of solar cells)
is limited by the laws of physics,"
Swanson said. "The big gains have
to come in reducing the cost of
the system."
"It's a chicken-or-egg problem,"
he said. "Many people feel that if
solar cells were cheap enough,
there would be a demand for
them. Others think if the demand
was high enough, they would be
cheap."
Civil Engineering Prof. Gil
Masters, an expert in energy tech
nologies, said he thinks the small
market and rapidly-changing
technology are the problems pre

venting more people from using
photovoltaic cells.
But, as engineers like Swanson
invent more efficient cells and as
their price gradually comes down,
a larger number of public utilities
will support the construction and
development of solar plants, he
said. This will increase the
demand for solar energy, and
photovoltaic cells in particular.
Already, Swanson's research
has catalyzed the interest of
utilities, many of which are plan
ning to invest in his design if they
find it easy to manufacture.
Luz, a privately-owned solar
power plant outside of Los An
geles, is only one example of solar
energy's potential, Masters said.
Applying a different solar technol
ogy than Swanson's photovoltaic
method, Luz uses light collectors
to concentrate the sun's energy,
which is used to boil water. The
steam from the boiling water then
drives a turbine generator for elec

tricity.
The power plant, located in the
small desert town of Boron, is the
largest solar power plant in the
world, producing about 200
megawatts worth of power or one
fifth the power of a nuclear plant.
By 1993, the plant will produce
enough electricity to service one
quarter million homes and busi
nesses. The plant is able to
provide uninterrupted electricity
by using natural gas when its
solar field shuts down after sun
set.
The advantage to the plant's
large size is that it can be more
cost-efficient, Masters said, gen
erating power at only 7 cents per
kilowatt-hour. This cost is com
petitive with nuclear and coal
fired power plants which produce
the same amount of energy for 5
to 8 cents.
"With its advancing technology,
the field of photovoltaics is likely
to bloom like it never has before,"
Masters said.

geles, is only one example of solar
energy's potential, Masters said.
Applying a different solar technol
ogy than Swanson's photovoltaic
method, Luz uses light collectors
to concentrate the sun's energy,
which is used to boil water. The
steam from the boiling water then
drives a turbine generator for elec

tricity.
The power plant, located in the
small desert town of Boron, is the
largest solar power plant in the
world, producing about 200
megawatts worth of power or one
fifth the power of a nuclear plant.
By 1993, the plant will produce
enough electricity to service one
quarter million homes and busi
nesses. The plant is able to
provide uninterrupted electricity
by using natural gas when its
solar field shuts down after sun
set.
The advantage to the plant's
large size is that it can be more
cost-efficient, Masters said, gen
erating power at only 7 cents per
kilowatt-hour. This cost is com
petitive with nuclear and coal
fired power plants which produce
the same amount of energy for 5
to 8 cents.
"With its advancing technology,
the field of photovoltaics is likely
to bloom like it never has before,"
Masters said.

When sunlight hits the solar cell, a negatively charged electron and a positively charged "hole"
separate to create an electric current.
In a hard-driven race, Electrical
Engineering Assoc. Prof. Richard
Swanson is vying with researchers
at Varian Associates to design the
world's most efficient solar cell.
"It's been a neck-and-neck com
petition with Varian," said Swan
son.
Until six months ago, Swanson
had held a two-year record with
a solar cell — also known as a
photovoltaic cell — boasting a 28.5
percent efficiency rating. Then,
Varian'B researchers designed a
cell that topped Swanson's by a
mere half-percent.
Now, Swanson's research team
has set its sights on a 30 percent
efficient cell to take the lead again,
which would approach the theo
retical limit of 33 percent.
The pieces necessary for creat
ing such a cell already exist, said
Swanson. He must only assemble
them in the right way to reduce
the heat lost when solar energy
is converted into electrical energy.
Smaller than a thumbnail and
costing about a dollar to produce,
Swanson's cell can be mounted
under a magnifying glass which
concentrates the sun's rays 500
times.
Such a cell, made of crystalline
silicon, can generate about six
watts of power, not yet enough
to power an ordinary light bulb.
Clusters of these cells can be
grouped together — each with a
lens and a mount — onto a tilting
panel that tracks the sun's move
ment across the sky.
Photons, or particles of light,
hit electrons in the silicon of each
cell. If the photons have enough
energy, depending on the
wavelength of the light, they can
knock electrons from the silicon
atoms. Known as the photoelectric
effect, this process was first ex
plained by Albert Einstein in
1905.
The electrons jolted loose leave
a "hole," a region of positive
charge, which can move just like
the electron.
If the electron makes its way
to one end of the solar cell and
the positive "hole" makes its way

to the other end, an electrical cur
rent is created.
Scientists hope that someday
this electric current can be har
nessed so large solar plants can
be created to provide a much
cleaner form of electricity than
coal-burning plants.
At present, the most useful ap
plications for solar cells are in
areas far from the reach of electric
plants.
For example, in developing na
tions these cells are the best en
ergy alternative to generate small
amounts of electricity which can
in turn be used to pump water.
Here, solar cells can be cheaper
than the expense of bringing in
electric lines from a distant city.
Swanson said local applications
include powering lights for high
way signs, parking lots, real estate
signs, home walkways and Coast
Guard buoys floating in the bay.
Some boats and recreational
vehicles now use these cells to
keep their batteries charged, while
powering lamps, radios and televi
sions.
Solar cells are commonly used
in watches and calculators, saving
consumers money by eliminating
the need to replace worn-out bat
teries.
Photovoltaics could be even
more useful during the hottest
months of the California summer,
he said, to help respond to the
peak demand for air conditioning
and prevent brown-outs.
The newest market for solar
cells has been for communication
stations on mountaintops, Swan
son said. Powered by photovolta
ics, microwave transmitters
permit people to make phone calls
across the Sierras while saving
phone companies the cost of put
ting up and maintaining telephone
poles in desolate, blizzard-prone
areas.
Phone booths in remote areas
of the Australian outback are even
powered by photovoltaic panels on
their roofs.
In addition, car shoppers can
buy the option of having a
photovoltaic panel built into the
sunroof of a new Volvo automo
bile. This panel would keep the

battery charged while simultane
ously operating a small fan to help
keep the car cool by circulating
the air inside.
Although the number of appli
cations for solar power have in
creased in the past few years, the
big impediment to widespread
photovoltaic use has been its cost,
Swanson said.
"The efficiency (of solar cells)
is limited by the laws of physics,"
Swanson said. "The big gains have
to come in reducing the cost of
the system."
"It's a chicken-or-egg problem,"
he said. "Many people feel that if
solar cells were cheap enough,
there would be a demand for
them. Others think if the demand
was high enough, they would be
cheap."
Civil Engineering Prof. Gil
Masters, an expert in energy tech
nologies, said he thinks the small
market and rapidly-changing
technology are the problems pre

venting more people from using
photovoltaic cells.
But, as engineers like Swanson
invent more efficient cells and as
their price gradually comes down,
a larger number of public utilities
will support the construction and
development of solar plants, he
said. This will increase the
demand for solar energy, and
photovoltaic cells in particular.
Already, Swanson's research
has catalyzed the interest of
utilities, many of which are plan
ning to invest in his design if they
find it easy to manufacture.
