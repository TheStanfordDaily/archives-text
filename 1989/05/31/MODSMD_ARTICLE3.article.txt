# Filling the whole: Housed fraternities meet pledge quota
## 
### Pam Weisz Staff writer 
Housed fraternities met their collec
tive quota for new pledges this spring
for the first time in at least eight years,
according to Dave Pickett, the Rush
coordinator for housed fraternities on
the Row.
The University sets a quota of pledges
for each housed fraternity and the In
terfraternity Council as a whole in order
to determine which fraternities qualify
for housing.
This year, the housed fraternity sys
tem exceeded the quota of 154 points
by 4 points, with a total of 158. The
quotas are based on a point system in
which each point represents a pledge
with two guaranteed years of housing.
Each pledge with only one guaranteed
year left counts as half a point.
The results show a marked improve
ment over past efforts in meeting
quotas. In 1988, the housed fraternities
missed their quota by 5 points, and in
1987 they fell 35 points short.
Although the housed fraternity sys-

tem as a whole met its quota, four fra
ternities did not meet their individual
quotas. Delta Kappa Epsilon, Delta Tau
Delta, Phi Delta Theta and Theta Delta
Chi Fraternities all fell short. Of these
houses, the Dekes and the Theta Delts
also failed to meet their quotas last year.
These houses still have until Oct. 6
to meet their quotas, Pickett said. If
an individual house fails to meet its
quota for three out of four years, Uni
versity officials may place the house in
the Draw, as they did with the Alpha
Delta Phi house this year.
If the IFC as a whole misses its quota
for two consecutive years, the fraternity
which missed quota by the greatest
number of points for the previous two
years can be placed in the Draw.
The Dekes and Theta Delts could have

their houses placed in the housing Draw
next year if they fail to meet their
quotas by Oct. 6. Row officials were
not available for comment yesterday on
the fates of these houses.
Todd Ortega, incoming president of
the IFC, attributed the fraternity sys
tem's overall success to "a more positive
attitude" this year on the part of the
IFC. The placing of the Alpha Delt house
in this year's Draw "shook people up,"
giving an added incentive to hold a more
active Rush, Ortega said.
A few fraternities dramatically im
proved their performance in meeting
quotas this year. Beta Theta Pi Frater
nity turned last year's shortfall of 9.5
points into a 9.5 surplus this year. Theta
Xi Fraternity fell short by 2 points last
year, but this year they exceeded quota
by v 4.5 points.
Pickett, who is also the resident as
sistant at the Beta House, said that the
Betas "are pretty happy" about this
year's successful Rush.
Rush results for sororities and un
housed fraternities were not available
as of yesterday.
