# Astronomer turns UFO search into science
## 
### Michael Lenz 
You wouldn't expect Stanford
scientists to spend large amounts
of time worrying about uniden
tified flying objects and the Loch
Ness Monster.
However, when Applied Physics
Prof. Peter Sturrock takes a break
from his research in astronomy
and plasma physics, he does just
that.
Sturrock is the president and a
founding member of the Society
for Scientific Exploration, a group
of 250 scientists worldwide which
focuses on the study of
"anomalous phenomena."
The society, established in 1982,
set out to publish a journal which
would fill a significant gap in sci
entific investigation of unusual,
but potentially significant, events
such as close encounters with
UFOs.
"You can find books in the book
store, but they're likely to be low
quality work," Sturrock says.
"There's no refereed journal that
carries articles on these fringe
subjects."
To true scientists, refereed jour
nals are a must. Scientific peers
review the articles submitted to
the journal to determine whether
they are valid scientific investiga
tions.
The society's journal, The Jour

nal of Scientific Exploration, has
published articles on UFO sight
ings, telekinesis and the Loch
Ness Monster, among other top
ics.
Sturrock, who has been at Stan
ford for 28 years, became inter
ested in such "fringe" topics
through his study of UFOs in the
19705. He found that "the unclas
sified work was not very good . . .
and the scientists who were doing
research couldn't get it pub
lished."
Psychology Prof. Roger
Shepard, also a founding member
of the society, says he was in
trigued by Sturrock's work be
cause he felt paranormal
phenomena were not receiving
enough serious study. Says
Shepard: "I had some feeling that
scientists should keep an open
mind" about these subjects.
Sturrock says he hopes the so
ciety will foster more in-depth
coverage of unusual events. One
recent article published in the
journal examined a UFO sighting
off the coast of New Zealand in
1978.
"The newspaper was full of ex
planations [immediately]" Stur
rock recalls, "but it took years
before any consensus emerged"
among scientists. The author of
the article analyzed a film of the
pulsing lights but came to no solid

conclusion as to their origin.
"It sounds dull, but a lot of
science is dull," Sturrock says.
The society has, however,
helped shed light on a number of
mysterious incidents. Sturrock
recounts the case of an air crew
over the Pacific which saw a
bright cloud on the horizon
rapidly expand to several miles in
diameter.
"The pilot thought it was a nu
clear explosion," Sturrock says. A
member of the society, however,
uncovered 20 examples of similar
occurrences ail over the world.
Still, no one knows what causes
the effect.
Before scientists can pass infor
mation on to the public, "We first
need to educate ourselves," Stur
rock says. "These are not ques
tions with simple answers."
Sturrock says he is ambivalent
about the popular interest in
astrology and the paranormal. "I

don't know what real harm it
does," he says. "Cigarettes do
worse harm."
"I wouldn't bet on horses
myself, because I'd lose," Stur
rock jokes. He says he would wor
ry, however, if someone holding a
"responsible public office" took
the advice of an astrologer. He
didn't cite any specific examples.
Although the society has not
yet solved any long-standing
riddles, Sturrock says he hopes it
will do so in the future. He
declines to speculate, however, on
what phenomena such as UFOs
may turn out to be.
"There are a lot of strange
things going on that turn out to
have natural explanations," he
says, although he does not rule
out that some UFOs may be secret
experiments or even alien visitors.
"We are novices in areas like
this," he says.
