## Track athletes head for NCAAs 
### Greg Gottesman Staff writer 
Most people wouldn't go to
Provo, Utah, on a bet.
Yet, there is no place Stanford
track and field stars Brian
Boggess, Peggy Odita, Patty Pur
pur and Erica Wheeler would
rather be than in Provo the next
few days. For them, Provo repre
sents challenge, possible glory and
the end of long, hard-fought
season.
More specifically, Brigham
Young is the sight of the 1989
NCAA Track and Field Champi
onships and Boggess, Odita, Pur
pur and Wheeler represent Stan
ford's only entrants in the meet,
to be held today through Satur
day.
Boggess, a junior, qualified for
the shotput competition in the
Great Western/Pacific 10 Confer
ence Championships earlier this
month at Stanford Stadium. His
throw of 59-BVi, a personal best,
put him just over the NCAA qual
ifying mark of 59-7Vi. Boggess'
throw gave him fifth in the Pac-10
meet.
The first qualifying round of
the shotput event will take place
Thursday at 7:30 p.m.
"I'm not nervous yet," Boggess
said. "I have been feeling pretty
consistent and much more confi
dent lately. I was in a bit of a
slump for a while, but somehow
I just worked my way out of it,
culminating with my throw at the
Pac-lOs.
"My ambition would be to get
All-American status at the
NCAAs. The top eight guys get
that title. That would definitely

be the next thing I would like to
do. That's what I'll push for."
Odita, a junior heptathlete,
qualified for the NCAAs and set
a school record at the Texas Relays
in early April with a score of
5,439. In the Pac-lOs, Odita
finished third with a score of
5,435.
"I am just going to go in there
and take it one event at a time,"
Odita said. "I can't look at the
overall picture because anything
can happen.
"There's a lot of competition
there, but you never know who's
going to have an awesome day.
Personally, I am feeling very
rested. I have not done a whole
lot of practicing and feel really
fresh going into the meet."
Odita's main competition un
doubtedly will come from UCLA's
Tonya Sedwick, this year's Pac-10
heptathlon champion.
The heptathlon at the NCAAs
kicks off today and ends on Thurs
day.
Purpur, a three-time All-
American, has qualified for the
NCAAs in two events, the shotput
and discus. Her personal best in
the shotput this year sits at 53-3,
well over the qualifying mark of
49-7. Her best discus throw of
179-9 bests the necessary NCAA
mark by more than 10 feet. Pur
pur finished second in the shotput
and fifth in the discus at the Pac
lOs but was disappointed with her
performance. Arizona's Carla
Garrett, the Pac-10 champion, is
presently Purpur's major obstacle
in terms of an NCAA title in the
shotput and in the discus as well.
"This is basically Patty's last
chance," Asst. Coach Scott

'I am just going to
go in ttiere and take it
one event at a time.'

Chisam said. "Garrett is definitely
beatable, but Patty's got to throw
well. If Patty can get off a 51-foot
throw and press Carla, she can
win it.
"She should finish in the top
three of the discus and shot put
regardless," he said. "They are
hers if she wants them."
Purpur will begin the meet on
Wednesday as she attempts to
qualify in the discus.
Wheeler, a senior javelin
thrower, qualified for the NCAAs
with a toss of 178-4 at the Texas
Relays. Despite coming into this
year's meet as the defending Pac
-10 champion, an "average day"
caused her to finish fourth at the
Pac-lOs. Wheeler had the top
throw in the country in 1988.
"Erica has beaten the Pac-10
and defending NCAA champion
this year," Chisam said. "She just
had a bad day at the Pac-lOs. If
she can just get out there, have
a great first throw and make some
people think, she's got a great
chance."
According to Chisam, the Stan
ford women's team has a shot at
finishing in the top 10, while the
men's team, with only one
entrant, does not look to finish as
high. "All three of our women
who are competing should finish
very high," Chisam said. "They
definitely should put the women's
team in the top 10."
