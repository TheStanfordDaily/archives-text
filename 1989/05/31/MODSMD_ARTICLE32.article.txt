# In the 1989 season, good pitching beats lousy hitting
## 
### 
With mfyor league batting averages
currently hovering around in
Moonlight Graham's range, it's
in vogue among the self-proclaimed base
ball pundits to state that pitchers today
are — by and large — superior to the
hitters.
These are the very same pitchers —
by and large — who were allegedly at
fault for the record home run barrage
m two years ago.
It can thus be concluded that the hur
lers of the Great Gopher Ball Year of
'87 have suddenly discovered some magi
cal new pitch and turned the tables on
those nasty batsmen.
The theory being advanced of late sug
gests that the pitchers' new magic bullet
is offspeed stuff, specifically the split
finger fastball. The Bill Jamesians ex
plain that Roger Craig invented the pitch
around the turn of the decade, taught it
to Jack Morris and revolutionized the
game for time immemorial.
Or straight from the horse's (i.e.
Craig's) mouth: "So many pitchers have
come up with outstanding changeups,
split-finger fastballs and cut fastballs.
Hitting is tougher right now than it's
been in two decades."
Well ...
First off, Craig invented nothing. If
anyone is to be credited with the fingers-

far-apart fad, it's Bruce Sutter. Second,
this wunderpitch is really nothing more
than a hard forkball — a pitch invented
around the time of prohibition.
Third, everyone was throwing the
damn thing two years ago and it was
flying out of the park faster than a seagull
in Toronto making a mad-dash escape
from a Dave Winfield throw.
And now, the counterexamples:
If changeups, et al. are so incredibly
difficult to hit, why is American League
Cy Young Award winner Frank Viola get
ting pounded into the middle of next
week? Most agree he has one of the three
best changes in the game.
If hitting has become a lost art in
general, why are Rafael Palmeiro and
Will Clark hitting in the .360-plus range?
Both are good hitters, to be sure, but

neither has established their ability to
hit that well for that long.
I know what you're thinking. The
counter-counterexamples: Wade Boggs is
hitting 50 points below his career aveage.
Half the league is barely hitting its
weight. Jeff Ballard has an ERA under
two. As does Kirk McCaskill.
My response? The counterexamples ad
mittedly prove nothing. But neither do
Hie counter-counterexamples.
The one thing that can be stated almost
for certain is that the majority of pitchers
in the league have been around since
1987. There are basically throwing the
same stuff. And, there was no Dead
Pitchers Society meeting over the winter
where they all agreed to become junk
balling slowballers.
"Okay, hot shot," you're thinking,
"then why is hitting so poor?"
I thought you'd never ask. Reason No.
1: The weather. Two years ago, there
were hardly any rainouts in April, May
and June. It was balmy across the United
States. This year, there is cold (Green
house Effect, where are you when we
need you?), rain and even snow wreaking
havoc with the flight of the ball.
Batting averages and run totals will
pick up in the dog days — especially as

the half-season phenoms begin to get
tired arms (Can you say Greg Maddux
'88? Nice try.)
Reason No. 2: (Hold on to your hats,
you're not going to like this one.) Hitters,
in a word, suck. Some are sitting on their
multi-year contracts and getting fat (So
what else is new?). Some, in an era where
there are few strikeout artists on the
hill, are whiffing at record rates (Are you
listening 80, Inky, Cory?).
Finally, it's trendy to smack at the first
offering a pitcher delivers these days.
That pitch was once a fastball down the
middle. A rookie named Mark McGwire
even drove 30 of them out of the park
two years ago en route to a rookie record
49 homers.
Do you think it occurred to the pitchers
that people might follow McGwire's lead?
Do you think maybe they've increased
the variety of first pitches so they don't
get taken downtown more often than a
prostitute on New York's 42nd Street?
1 offer but one example to support this
unscientifically researched claim. In
1987, Bert Blyleven gave a record number
of round trippers. In 1989, he's one of
the best pitchers on one of the league's
best pitching staffs — the California An
gels. He's giving up a little over two
earned runs a game.

Blyleven's turnaround may not have
required a single new pitch, just a mod
ification in when he threw his old ones.
One final note. Baseball suffered a
great loss Monday with the retire
ment of Mike Schmidt. When I
was growing up as a Mets fan, Schmidt
was always the big stick of the hated
Phillies.
But,' becailse of Ms 'superb play and
his class, Schmidt had the respect of this
writer from day one. His tearful farewell
was a classic example of that old line
you're parents used to throw at you: "It's
all right to cry."
Schimdt retires as arguably the finest
third baseman of all time and will cer
tainly be a first-ballot electee to the Hall
of Fame once he becomes eligible.
Mike, baseball mourns your loss. May
the transition to normal life be an easy
way and may you have nothing but fond
memories of living out your dream come
true.
