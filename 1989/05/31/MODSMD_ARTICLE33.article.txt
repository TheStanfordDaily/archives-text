AUBURN, Ala. (AP) - San
Diego Charger Lionel James,
who returned to Auburn Uni
versity in the offseason to
prepare for life after profes
sional football, picks up his di
ploma June 9.
"I enjoy football, but I've
planned for the future," the
former Auburn running back
said. "The average career in
pro football lasts three years,
but the average life span of a
human is between 68 and 72
years. When I'm not piaying
football anymore, what will I
do with the rest of my life?
"I want to be a math teacher
because I like kids and math
is something I'm good at."
James, who has juggled pro
fessional football and college
classes for five years, said com
pleting his degree in math ed
ucation at Auburn was a long
time goal.
"Graduating is one of the
things I've always wanted to
do," he said. "It's taken a while
because I've only been able to
be in school one quarter out of
the year, but finishing was im
portant for me, and I always
planned to.
"Getting a college degree
compares with being drafted in
the NFL."
The 27-year-old native of Al
bany, Ga., will begin his sixth
season with the Chargers this
year.
At running back and wide
receiver in the National Foot
ball League, James has

averaged 10.9 yards per catch
and 4.6 yards per carry rush
ing. His 1985 performance
against the Los Angeles
Raiders set the Chargers'
record for the most combined
yards in a game, with 51 rush
ing, 168 receiving and 126 in
kickoff returns for a total of
345 yards.
He was a four-year letterman
at halfback for Auburn from
1980 to 1983. Despite his 5-
foot-7, 166-pound size, James
ended up ranked fifth on
Auburn's career rushing list.
This quarter, James has
served a teaching internship at
nearby Opelika Junior High
School.
"The hardest thing I've ever
had to face is in the classroom,
because there I've got to face
people head on, when usually
on the football field I'm trying
to run away from people,"
James said.
In addition to his work in
professional football and the
classroom, James promotes
literacy programs, speaks out
against alcohol and drug abuse
and makes public service an
nouncements for the United
Way and youth job programs.
"I feel if I'm a role model
and I'm benefitting from being
a role model, then it's my duty
to put something back into the
community," James said. "If I
can help somebody or encour
age them to do their best, I
want to."
