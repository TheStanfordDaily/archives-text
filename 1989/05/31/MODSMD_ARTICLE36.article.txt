# Pitino leaves New York for Kentucky

### 
NEW YORK (AP) — Rick Pitino is fol
lowing his heart to Kentucky.
Pitino was released from his contract as
coach of the New York Knicks yesterday,
freeing him to become the basketball coach
at Kentucky, which is on a three-year NCAA
probation.
"I'm a college basketball coach and I think
that's where my heart is," Pitino, 36, said
at an impromptu news conference outside
Madison Square Garden yesterday."And 1
think that's in the best interest of everyone."
Pitino ended his two-year association with
the New York team by reaching agreement
on terms for the termination of his contract,
the Knicks said. Those terms were not re
leased.
Pitino is expected to be named the coach
at Kentucky this week. He was offered the
job last week by Wildcats athletic director
C.M. Newton and said he did not use the
meeting with Knicks general manager A 1
Bianchi and Madison Square Garden exec
utive Jack Diller as a negotiating ploy.
"No, that wasn't the intent of the meet
ing," Pitino said. "That decision was made
to go to Kentucky [Monday]."
Pitino coached the Knicks to a 52-win

season this year, but he reportedly was not
getting along with Bianchi, the man who
hired him away from Providence College.
"There is no dispute and there hasn't
been a dispute in two years with A 1 Bianchi,"
Pitino said. "A 1 Bianchi is an outstanding
general manager and I think under his guid
ance we will see a banner — and I say 'we
will' because I'm part of New York — hang
ing in Madison Square Garden sometime
down the road."
Bianchi was not upset or bitter about
Pitino's decision.
"No, why should I be mad?" Bianchi said.
"Since after his first year here, Rick and I
have had conversations about professional
versus college basketball. I've known all
along where his heart was."
Pitino led Providence to the 1987 Final
Four. He won't be able to do that at Ken
tucky for the next two years because the
Wildcats will be barred from postseason play.
"I've always gone in with one thing in
mind, that we were obviously going to go
in there and do it the right way and win
and build a very entertaining style of play,"
Pitino said.
Kentucky finished last season at 13-19,

its first losing record in 62 years. The NCAA
penalties announced earlier this month in
clude a ban on postseason tournament play
for two years and a ban on live television
for next season.
The Knicks' search for a new coach will
begin immediately. Among those mentioned
for the job are Dallas Mavericks Coach John
McLeod; North Carolina State Coach Jim
Valvano; Atlanta Hawks Coach Mike Fratel
lo, who came under fire when the Hawks
lost in the first round of the playoffs this
year; Dick Motta, the man McLeod replaced
in Dallas; and Chicago Bulls assistant Phil
Jackson, an former Knick player.
Bianchi gave Pitino permission to discuss
the Kentucky job, but the Knicks have said
they expected to get back the money they
spend in searching for a new coach. That
hurdle apparently was overcome at Tues
day's meeting.
Pitino also said he had alerted the Knicks
players that he was talking with Kentucky.
Pitino was offered the position held for
four seasons by Eddie Sutton, who resigned
in March in the midst of the NCAA inves
tigation.
