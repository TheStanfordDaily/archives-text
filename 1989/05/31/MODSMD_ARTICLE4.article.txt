# Stanford air quality adviser charged with conflict of interest
## 
### Jock Friedly Editorial staff 
Assemblyman Tom Hayden has
charged that Warner North, who per
formed a study of campus air quality
released two weeks ago, is involved in
conflicts of interests for receiving money
from chemical companies.
North — who draws a salary from
Stanford as a consulting professor of
engineering-economic systems — is a
member of Gov. George Deukmejian's
Proposition 65 scientific advisory panel,
a group that decides whether individual
chemicals are listed as carcinogens.
The Democratic assemblyman from
Santa Monica charged last week that
North profited from chemical companies
with interests in some of the chemicals
the scientific panel has discussed. North's
involvement with these companies comes
from his work at Decision Focus, a Los

Altos-based firm of which North is vice
president and part owner.
"I am surprised by Mr. Hayden's alle
gations," North told The Daily last night
from Pittsburgh, where he is on a busi
ness trip. Despite North's objections,
Hayden is calling for North and the chair
of the panel to resign from his position
on the scientific panel.
Allegations of North's conflict of inter
est with chemical companies has raised
questions about the propriety of North's
other dealings including his relationship
with Stanford and the selection of his
company to perform air quality studies
on the Biology-Chemistry Quadrangle.
North receives a annual salary between
$1,000 and $10,000 from the University,
according to his financial disclosures.
North said he welcomes anyone to review
his financial records.
Also, North and University President
Donald Kennedy are personal friends.

instance in which he broke
the law. What we do have
is a pattern.'

"You could say there is a conflict of in
terest issue because we are acquain
tances," Kennedy said last week.
However, Kennedy said he was not in
volved in hiring Decision Focus for the
study. Furthermore, North said he had
"very little personal involvement" in the
study. The two other employees of Deci
sion Focus named on the study were
more involved, he said.
Due to a lack of companies able to
perform the study, Stanford did not hold

open bidding for the contract and instead
chose Decision Focus directly. "There just
aren't enough players," Kennedy said. "I
think they are excellent."
The Daily's review of transcripts from
the advisory panel meetings reveals that
North has on several occasions requested
to sit out of votes because of potential
conflicts of interest. On one occasion,
North stated that he had a potential con
flict of interest with one chemical he ex
amined because of consulting he per
formed for Monsanto Corp.
North did not disqualify himself from
that particular vote but voted that the
chemical should be placed on the list of
carcinogens under Proposition 65. Even
though North voted for a position con
trary to his financial benefit, Paul Van
Dyke, a spokesperson for Hayden, said,
"The fact is, he can't be involved either
way."

Van Dyke cited a state law preventing
North from participation in the discus
sions.
That law. Government Code Section
87100, states: "No public official at any
level of state or local government shall
make, participate in making or in any
way attempt to use his official position
to influence a governmental decision in
which he knows or has reason to know
he has a financial interest."
North is not a public official since he
is only a member of an advisory panel.
"We don't have a single instance in
which he broke the law," said Van Dyke.
"What we do have is a pattern.
North disagreed that he has anything
to gain from any of his decisions on the
panel. He said that all money he has
received recently for consultation work
has gone to Decision Focus.
"I'm surprised and puzzled by the proc
ess," North said.
