# Study shows more traffic, more speeding
## Fast moves on campus drives 
### Tim Marklein Editorial staff 
There's a lot of fast-moving
traffic on Junipero Serra Boule
vard, Peter Coutts Road and Stan
ford Avenue, but future campus
growth will not make the situa
tion significantly more hazardous,
a new survey predicts.
The final environmental impact
report needed for Stanford's gen
eral use permit from Santa Clara
County shows current problems
with speeding on all three roads.
The average driving speed on
Peter Coutts and Stanford is 35
miles per hour, topping the speed
limit by 10 miles per hour. The
average on Junipero Serra is 42
miles per hour, seven over the
maximum speed allowed by law.
The speeds do not make the
roads "significantly less safe"
than other streets, according to
the report. However, excessive
speed was a factor in more than
half of the accidents reported on
the avenues from 1983-87, accord

ing to data obtained for the
report.
The report concludes that Stan
ford, Palo Alto and the county
should team up to boost enforce
ment, in addition to finding speed
reducing "roadway design fea
tures."
The University already plans to
alleviate the increased volume
through its traffic demand man
agement program, which hopes to
reduce peak period trips by 5 per
cent. The program includes a
number of proposals: using the
Marguerite shuttle system; pro
viding carpool incentives and in
formation; creating a telephone
information service about public
transit and ridesharing; and pro
viding facilities for bicyclists and
walkers.
Campus growth may play a part
in reducing the speed of traffic,
as the report projects an 11 per
cent increase in Peter Coutts
volume and 4 and 5 percent rise
in Stanford and Junipero Serra
use. Sand Hill Road will also face

a 4 percent riBe in use.
The report concluded, though,
that the small increases "will not
materially affect the safety" of the
byways.
The 2-inch thick report
responds in detail to questions
posed by community members in
the past nine months. The plan
ning commission heard concerns
from 27 speakers at a hearing last
August and received 47 letters
since then.
The first of four public hearings
on the document will occur
tonight at 7:30 in the Palo Alto
City Hall Council Chambers.
The new use permit will replace
the more general one in effect
since 1962.
In order to facilitate quicker re
sponse to changing conditions, the
new permit establishes "triggers"
for new reviews if projected
growth levels are exceeded before
the year 2000.
The county's Planning Commis
sion will hold an official certifica
tion hearing July 6.
