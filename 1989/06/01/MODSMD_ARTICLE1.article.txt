# Ralliers: Charges hurt healing
## 
### John Wagner Editorial staff 
After receiving formal charges for
breaking the campus disruption policy
yesterday, several students involved in
the takeover of University President
Donald Kennedy's office said the
charges would severely disrupt the
healing process that had begun with
the administration.
"I've really lost any faith that I had
for any healing process," protester Gina
Hernandez said during a press confer
ence held last night by the Agenda for
Action coalition, the group which or
ganized the takeover.
"There's no due process for us here
at this university," said Hernandez, a
senior.
About 50 students, faculty members,
staff members, alumni and family mem
bers of arrested students attended the
coalition's press conference.
Assoc. Dean of Student Affairs Mi
chael Jackson was also present. Jackson
declined to comment after the press con
ference.

Formal charges of violating the Uni
versity's policy on campus disruption
were scheduled to be mailed yesterday
to 53 students involved in the takeover
of Kennedy's office. According to Stacey
Leyton, a protester and an outgoing
Council of Presidents member, several
of the students who anticipated finding
charges in their mailboxes later this
week picked up copies of their charges
yesterday afternoon at the Judicial Af
fairs Office.
Leyton said coalition members believe
the administration has issued three var
iations of the charges to protesters.
Copies of three different notification let
ters were made available to the press
by the coalition yesterday.
The first variation of the letter —
which Leyton said she believes has been
issued to most students who occupied
Kennedy's office — charges that the
student took possession of Building 10
(the Office of the President) and refused
access to persons with "legitimate Uni
versity business to conduct in it."
A second variation of the letter
charges the student with three counts

of violating the campus disruption code:
for blocking entrance to Building 10,
for interfering with University officials'
attempts to gain access to the building,
and for assisting those who had taken
possession of the building.
The name of protester and COP mem
ber David Brown appears on the copy
of the second variation of the charges
given to the press by the coalition. In
the May 15 protest, Brown was one of
21 students arrested for blocking police
access to Buidling 10.
The third variation of the letter —
which Leyton said was sent to those the
administration believes played larger
roles in the takeover — charges the
student with two counts of violating the
disruption code: for taking possession
of Building 10 and for having "forced
or intimidated two staff members
employed in Buidling 10 into leaving
their legitimate place of work."
Leyton's name appears on the copy
of the third variation of the letter dis
tributed by the coalition. The letter con-

eludes that Leyton's participation
"constitutes an especially
egregious violation of the Policy
on Campus Disruption."
Punishments for violating the
disruption code are based on past
precedent and mitigating circum
stances. In the past, punishments
have ranged from a letter of rep
rimand to expulsion.
Investigations are considered
confidential, according to Judicial
Affairs Officer Sally Cole, the Uni
versity official responsible for is
suing charges of student conduct
violations. However, students are
free to release any information
about their cases, she said.
At the press conference, coali
tion members said they were out
raged by the administration's tac
tic of charging different students
under different charges.
"They're trying to single people
out, practicing classic divide and
conquer Itacticsl that have been
used against . . . people of color
. . . for centuries," Hernandez
said.
On Tuesday Kennedy told The
Daily that such arguments by the
students were unfounded. "You
begin to wonder if the concerns
aren't invented for someone's pur
poses," he said.
Hernandez also said the admin
istration had been slandering in
dividual students. The adminis
tration, she said, has been "de
scribing us in analogies that liken
us to drunks and conspirators,"
she said. "We feel like this is really
wrong."
Coalition members also contin
ued to voice concern yesterday
about the relationship between
the campus disruption code and
the Fundamental Standard.
Leyton said students had been
told prior to the release of the
disruption charges that the
campus disruption policy was
"part of the Fundamental Stand

ard."
Administrators said Tuesday
that this was not the case.
Cole said the campus disruption
policy and the Fundamental
Standard are "distinct policies."
The "relationship between them
is more philosophical," she said.
Two weeks ago Cole told The
Daily that the policy on campus
disruptions was "an application
of the Fundamental Standard."
Coalition member Judy Wu said
at the press conference that pro
testers believe the disruption
policy "is really part of the Fun
damental Standard although the
administration is saying it's some
thing different."
Since the takeover, protesters
had been demanding amnesty
from Fundamental Standard
charges, arguing that it is
hypocritical for the University to
use the Standard to punish the
students working for change, and
not use the Standard to punish
students who committed racist
acts earlier this year. , . , ,«n m
Brown said Tuesday that by
divorcing the disruption policy
from the Fundamental Standard,
the administration is trying to
duck charges of hypocrisy they
have faced for using the Standard
against the protesters.
According to Hernandez, the
administration will not be able to
escape its hypocrisy. "Whatever
the administration wants to call
their policies doesn't matter," she
said. "Those policies have [protec
ted! racists all year and free
speech of racists. . . . We don't
have any of those rights."
Several faculty, staff members,
alumni and family members of
protesters spoke at yesterday's
press conference, offering support
for the students.
Susan Hayase, an Asian-
American Stanford alumna, said
she was "outraged and disgusted
by the actions of the University."
The administration's treatment
of the students "is very heavy
handed and it's unnecessary, in
appropriate and out-of-step with

reality," Hayase said. "We think
these students should be sup
ported and not prosecuted."
According to Hayase, the stu
dents' May 15 actions were part
of a growing movement for em
powerment by people of color.
"It's something that Donald
Kennedy would have known if he
had taken an Asian-American
studies class years ago," she said.
Sandra Viera, a secretary in the
Career Planning and Placement
Center, said she was frustrated by
the University's actions. "I see the
University as trying to separate
the campus disruption policy from
the Fundamental Standard as an
attempt to get away from looking
hypocritical," she said.
According to Viera, "Stanford
has shown through it's actions
that it will punish those who try
to make this University a truly
multicultural education."
Anthropology Prof. Renato
Rosaldo said he wanted to voice
his support for the students. Ac
, cording
the-adminiatration share the same
vision of a multicultural educa
tion and the administration
should avoid taking any actions
that would jeopardize the fulfill
ment of that vision.
Cecil Taylor, the father of
protester Cheryl Taylor, said his
entire family backed the efforts
of those who occupied Kennedy's
office. "The family really does
support Cheryl and the people
that were arrested and feel they
should stand tall against intimi
dation," he said.
Carol Brown, the mother of Da
vid Brown, also voiced support for
the students. "Our family was
proiyd that David was involved in
the action," she said. "Students
should be allowed to protest."
Carol Brown said she thought
the response of the administra
tion to the takeover had been in
appropriate for a "progressive in
stitution."
According to University policy,
disciplinary records do not appear
on students' transcripts.
