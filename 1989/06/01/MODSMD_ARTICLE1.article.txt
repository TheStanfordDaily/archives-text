### John Wagner Editorial staff 
After receiving formal charges for
breaking the campus disruption policy
yesterday, several students involved in
the takeover of University President
Donald Kennedy's office said the
charges would severely disrupt the
healing process that had begun with
the administration.
"I've really lost any faith that I had
for any healing process," protester Gina
Hernandez said during a press confer
ence held last night by the Agenda for
Action coalition, the group which or
ganized the takeover.
"There's no due process for us here
at this university," said Hernandez, a
senior.
About 50 students, faculty members,
staff members, alumni and family mem
bers of arrested students attended the
coalition's press conference.
Assoc. Dean of Student Affairs Mi
chael Jackson was also present. Jackson
declined to comment after the press con
ference.

Formal charges of violating the Uni
versity's policy on campus disruption
were scheduled to be mailed yesterday
to 53 students involved in the takeover
of Kennedy's office. According to Stacey
Leyton, a protester and an outgoing
Council of Presidents member, several
of the students who anticipated finding
charges in their mailboxes later this
week picked up copies of their charges
yesterday afternoon at the Judicial Af
fairs Office.
Leyton said coalition members believe
the administration has issued three var
iations of the charges to protesters.
Copies of three different notification let
ters were made available to the press
by the coalition yesterday.
The first variation of the letter —
which Leyton said she believes has been
issued to most students who occupied
Kennedy's office — charges that the
student took possession of Building 10
(the Office of the President) and refused
access to persons with "legitimate Uni
versity business to conduct in it."
A second variation of the letter
charges the student with three counts

of violating the campus disruption code:
for blocking entrance to Building 10,
for interfering with University officials'
attempts to gain access to the building,
and for assisting those who had taken
possession of the building.
The name of protester and COP mem
ber David Brown appears on the copy
of the second variation of the charges
given to the press by the coalition. In
the May 15 protest, Brown was one of
21 students arrested for blocking police
access to Buidling 10.
The third variation of the letter —
which Leyton said was sent to those the
administration believes played larger
roles in the takeover — charges the
student with two counts of violating the
disruption code: for taking possession
of Building 10 and for having "forced
or intimidated two staff members
employed in Buidling 10 into leaving
their legitimate place of work."
Leyton's name appears on the copy
of the third variation of the letter dis
tributed by the coalition. The letter con-
