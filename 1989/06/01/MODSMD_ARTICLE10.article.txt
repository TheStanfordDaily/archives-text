1. That on Monday, May 15, 1989, (name)
individually or together with others, knowingly
or intentionally sat or stood in front of the
doors of Building 10 (the Office of the Pres
ident), or otherwise physically refused or
blocked normal entrance by Building 10 staff
members and others with legitimate University
business to conduct in it. I believe that
(name's) participation in these actions vio
lated the Policy on Campus Disruption.
2. That on Monday, May 15, 1989, (name)
individually or together with others, knowingly
or intentionally interfered with attempts by
members of the University community, acting
in official roles and identified as such, to gain
access to the exterior back door of Building
10 in an effort to bring an end to a disruption

within the building. The interference was
caused by refusing to discontinue blocking
or obstructing the doorway after being asked
to do so by these identified University officials.
I believe that such interference violated the
Policy on Campus Disruption.

in it. I believe that such assistance violated
the Policy on Campus Disruption.
