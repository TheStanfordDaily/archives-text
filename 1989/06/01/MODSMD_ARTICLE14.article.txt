## Wright resigns as speaker amidst ethics charges Successor less partisan 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Jim
Wright said today he will resign
as speaker of the House.
Wright devoted most of his
speech to a detailed defense
against the ethics charges and ap
pealed to the House to end a pe
riod of "mindless cannibalism"
against some lawmakers.
"All of us are prone to human
error," said Wright from the well
of the House to national television
audience and a chamber packed
with lawmakers.
He added, "I love this institu
tion. I want to assure each of you
that under no circumstances
would I ever knowingly or inten
tionally do or say anything to vi
olate its rules or detract from its
standards."
House members, reacting to
Wright's emotional resignation
speech, said yesterday they sup
ported the speaker's decision to
step down because charges of eth
ics violations had ended his chance
to be an effective leader.
"The price paid was so dis
proportional, but he did the only
thing he could do," said Wright
defender Charles Wilson, D-Texas,
citing an "emotional burden" that
made it "impossible to go on."
Wright "correctly recognized
the utility of his speakership was
over," said Rep. David Obey, D-
Wis., who was chairman of a panel
that wrote many of the ethics
rules.
President Bush praised Wright,
a fellow Texan, saying in a state
ment, "In spite of the present sit
uation, I believe the Wright ten
ure was one of effectiveness and
dedication to the Congress of the
United States."
Rep. Martin Frost, D-Texas,
said he hoped members listened
carefully to Wright's urging that

Democrats refrain from thoughts
of avenging the resignation, and
that Republicans not try to
retaliate for the defeat earlier this
year of the nomination of John
Tower for secretary of defense.
"He did an awful lot of good as
speaker," Frost added.
Immediately after Wright made
his announcement, Rep. Jack
Brooks, D-Texas, stood at the
same podium on the House floor
and expressed his fears about the
"evil wind blowing in the halls of
Congress."
Rep. Louis Stokes, D-Ohio,
former chairman of the ethics
committee, warned that if the
present mood remains "the end
result will be to destroy this in
stitution as we know it today."
House Minority Leader Bob Mi
chel, R ill., said Wright's resigna
tion was a sad time for the House
and for Wright, but added, "It is
also an unprecedented opportu
nity for the House to begin a bi
partisan, comprehensive reforma
tion of this institution and its
rules."
And Rep. Bill Richardson, D-
N.M., said the House is "like a
war zone right now where you
don't know when the next bomb
is going to drop." He said a time
for healing is needed, but warned
that if House Republican Whip
Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., who filed
the original charges against
Wright, "wants to engage in open
warfare, there will be a Democra
tic response."
Rep. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J.,
who was involved in Wright's de
fense, said Wright's "parting gift
was a warning to stop" the ven
geance.
Torricelli said Wright had no
choice but to resign rather than
fight the charges.

WASHINGTON (AP) - The burden of ending
what House Speaker Jim Wright called "this season
of bad will" now rests with Thomas Foley, the
Washington Democrat who will inherit Wright's job
next week. And virtually no one thinks there's a
better man for the challenge.
Foley, who presided over the House yesterday as
Wright defended his honor and abdicated his office,
will lay full claim to the gavel when he is formally
elected to Congress' most powerful job. He will
bring to the speakership a less partisan style that
fits perfectly with President Bush's call for accom
modation between the executive and legislative
branches.
As House majority leader, Foley, 60, has won
admiration from both sides of the aisle for his
command of issues and tireless negotiating skills.
He is a master at finding consensus and striking
compromise.
Wright acknowledged in his farewell address that
"perhaps" he had been "too partisan, too insistent,
too abrasive, too determined to have my way." Foley
is none of those things.
Like Wright, Foley's political roots trace to the
New Deal of Franklin Roosevelt, but he is no knee
jerk liberal — and wouldn't have lasted in the
House if he were. Unlike most leaders whose seats
are "safe," he is from a distinctly Republican and
conservative district that has put him through many
close elections.
Though hand-picked for the House's elite by
Wright and his predecessor, former Speaker Thomas
"Tip" O'Neill, Foley never shared their penchant
for bashing the Reagan-Bush administration or
other Republican opponents. O'Neill admired Foley
most for qualities he admittedly didn't possess him
self — meticulous craftsmanship of legislation, thor
ough command of the issues, attention to organi
zational detail.
"Tom Foley," O'Neill once said, in both exaspera
tion and respect, "is a man who can see three sides
of every issue."
"The reality is that in a modern, participatory
Congress the responsibility of leadership and the
necessity of leadership is to constantly involve mem
bers in the process of decision and consensus," Foley
says.

jerk liberal — and wouldn't have lasted in the
House if he were. Unlike most leaders whose seats
are "safe," he is from a distinctly Republican and
conservative district that has put him through many
close elections.
Though hand-picked for the House's elite by
Wright and his predecessor, former Speaker Thomas
"Tip" O'Neill, Foley never shared their penchant
for bashing the Reagan-Bush administration or
other Republican opponents. O'Neill admired Foley
most for qualities he admittedly didn't possess him
self — meticulous craftsmanship of legislation, thor
ough command of the issues, attention to organi
zational detail.
"Tom Foley," O'Neill once said, in both exaspera
tion and respect, "is a man who can see three sides
of every issue."
"The reality is that in a modern, participatory
Congress the responsibility of leadership and the
necessity of leadership is to constantly involve mem
bers in the process of decision and consensus," Foley
says.

House Speaker Jim Wright of Texas addresses the House of Representatives yes
terday, offering his resignation as speaker of the House.
WASHINGTON (AP) - Jim
Wright said today he will resign
as speaker of the House.
Wright devoted most of his
speech to a detailed defense
against the ethics charges and ap
pealed to the House to end a pe
riod of "mindless cannibalism"
against some lawmakers.
"All of us are prone to human
error," said Wright from the well
of the House to national television
audience and a chamber packed
with lawmakers.
He added, "I love this institu
tion. I want to assure each of you
that under no circumstances
would I ever knowingly or inten
tionally do or say anything to vi
olate its rules or detract from its
standards."
House members, reacting to
Wright's emotional resignation
speech, said yesterday they sup
ported the speaker's decision to
step down because charges of eth
ics violations had ended his chance
to be an effective leader.
"The price paid was so dis
proportional, but he did the only
thing he could do," said Wright
defender Charles Wilson, D-Texas,
citing an "emotional burden" that
made it "impossible to go on."
Wright "correctly recognized
the utility of his speakership was
over," said Rep. David Obey, D-
Wis., who was chairman of a panel
that wrote many of the ethics
rules.
President Bush praised Wright,
a fellow Texan, saying in a state
ment, "In spite of the present sit
uation, I believe the Wright ten
ure was one of effectiveness and
dedication to the Congress of the
United States."
Rep. Martin Frost, D-Texas,
said he hoped members listened
carefully to Wright's urging that

Democrats refrain from thoughts
of avenging the resignation, and
that Republicans not try to
retaliate for the defeat earlier this
year of the nomination of John
Tower for secretary of defense.
"He did an awful lot of good as
speaker," Frost added.
Immediately after Wright made
his announcement, Rep. Jack
Brooks, D-Texas, stood at the
same podium on the House floor
and expressed his fears about the
"evil wind blowing in the halls of
Congress."
Rep. Louis Stokes, D-Ohio,
former chairman of the ethics
committee, warned that if the
present mood remains "the end
result will be to destroy this in
stitution as we know it today."
House Minority Leader Bob Mi
chel, R ill., said Wright's resigna
tion was a sad time for the House
and for Wright, but added, "It is
also an unprecedented opportu
nity for the House to begin a bi
partisan, comprehensive reforma
tion of this institution and its
rules."
And Rep. Bill Richardson, D-
N.M., said the House is "like a
war zone right now where you
don't know when the next bomb
is going to drop." He said a time
for healing is needed, but warned
that if House Republican Whip
Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., who filed
the original charges against
Wright, "wants to engage in open
warfare, there will be a Democra
tic response."
Rep. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J.,
who was involved in Wright's de
fense, said Wright's "parting gift
was a warning to stop" the ven
geance.
Torricelli said Wright had no
choice but to resign rather than
fight the charges.

WASHINGTON (AP) - The burden of ending
what House Speaker Jim Wright called "this season
of bad will" now rests with Thomas Foley, the
Washington Democrat who will inherit Wright's job
next week. And virtually no one thinks there's a
better man for the challenge.
Foley, who presided over the House yesterday as
Wright defended his honor and abdicated his office,
will lay full claim to the gavel when he is formally
elected to Congress' most powerful job. He will
bring to the speakership a less partisan style that
fits perfectly with President Bush's call for accom
modation between the executive and legislative
branches.
As House majority leader, Foley, 60, has won
admiration from both sides of the aisle for his
command of issues and tireless negotiating skills.
He is a master at finding consensus and striking
compromise.
Wright acknowledged in his farewell address that
"perhaps" he had been "too partisan, too insistent,
too abrasive, too determined to have my way." Foley
is none of those things.
Like Wright, Foley's political roots trace to the
New Deal of Franklin Roosevelt, but he is no knee
jerk liberal — and wouldn't have lasted in the
House if he were. Unlike most leaders whose seats
are "safe," he is from a distinctly Republican and
