BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) — Super
market owners reportedly shot and killed two
looters yesterday as provincial governments
opened soup kitchens and Congress increased so
cial benefits in bids to end food rioting and
looting.
The independent news agency Diarios y Noticias
quoted police as saying they arrested the shop
owners but did not say how many were involved
in the shooting, which would bring the death toll
from more than a week of unrest to 13.
President-elect Carlos Menem met outgoing
President Raul Alfonsin and indicated he will
work closely with the government on the eco
nomic crisis that sparked the looting, but he
again refused to take office early.
"I don't want to interfere with the desire of
President Alfonsin to serve out his mandate,"

the winner of May 14 national elections told
reporters. Alfonsin is to step down Dec. 10.
The two agreed to review the 1989 budget and
put more money into health and nutrition pro
grams, increase state revenue from customs taxes,
and coordinate policy on public salaries, utility
rates and the $59 billion foreign debt, Menem
said.
Small-scale looting was reported in a couple
of Buenos Aires suburbs.
Police fired rubber bullets and tear gas to
disperse a crowd trying to break into a super
market in western Mendoza, Argentina's fourth
biggest city.
"I had hoped to live what's left of my life in
peace and quiet, but now it seems more likely
that I'll die in the middle of a war," said Buenos
Aires resident Matilde Alvarez.
