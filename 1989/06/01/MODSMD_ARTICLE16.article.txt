# Takeshita picks replacement
## Japanese Foreign Minister to become next Prime Minister 
### 
TOKYO (AP) — Foreign Min
ister Sousuke Uno agreed yester
day to become Japan's next prime
minister, at the behest of a
governing party crippled by scan
dal and divided by the choice.
The Liberal Democrats turned
to Uno, 66, after elder statesman
Masayoshi Ito refused the job.
Uno was attending a meeting
in Paris and agreed by telephone,
apparently with some reluctance,
to become head of the party and
to replace Prime Minister Noboru
Takeshita.
Ryutaro Hashimoto, deputy
secretary-general of the party, ap
peared at a news conference and
quoted Uno as saying: "I am not

confident I can handle the job
when the party is facing such a
difficult time, but now that the
party is in an unprecedented crisis
I will commit myself for the
party."
Hashimoto said party leaders
decided Uno was "currently the
most suited candidate as succes
sor" to Takeshita. The prime min
ister is resigning to take respon
sibility for the Recruit influence
buying scandal, which stained the
top ranks of politics, business and
the bureaucracy.
Opposition within the party in
dicated Uno may have a difficult
time even if gets the expected ap
proval from Parliament, where

the Liberal Democrats have a
large majority.
Some oppose the foreign min
ister because he is a senior mem
ber of the party faction of former
Prime Minister Yasuhiro
Nakasone.
"I am outraged by this nonsense
of giving the country's highest of
fice, which only one person can
assume, to a sort of managing
director of the Nakasone compa
ny," former Prime Minister Takeo
Fukuda told reporters. "I am to
tally amazed."
Fukuda, 84, had lobbied against
Uno. His own name was one of
many mentioned as possible can
didates during the long search.
