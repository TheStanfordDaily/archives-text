# Bush makes call for unified Europe
## 
### 
MAINZ, West Germany (AP) — Pres
ident Bush told cheering Germans on
Wednesday that the time is right to
make Europe "whole and free" and he
called on Soviet leader Mikhail Gorba
chev to open up "the rusting Iron Cur
tain."
The president did not directly endorse
the reunification of Germany, but he
renewed a demand that the Berlin Wall
be dismantled.
"The world has waited long enough,"
Bush declared. "We seek self
determination for all of Germany and
all of Eastern Europe. We will not relax.
We must not waver."
The president flew to London for a
private evening meeting with Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher after a day
in West Germany arranged for maxi
mum publicity.
The events included a colorful cruise
on the Rhine River and a visit to Am
bassador Vernon Walters' home, where
hundreds of American children whose
parents work in the country were as
sembled to wave paper flags and cheer
the president.
But the centerpiece was clearly the

speech in Mainz. Showing the confi
dence that marked his performance ear
lier in the week at a NATO summit
meeting in Brussels, Bush challenged
the Soviet Union to dismantle the
barbed wire-topped wall erected 28
years ago to divide the old German cap
ital.
Throwing Gorbachev's use of the term
"glasnost," or openness, back at the So
viet leader, he said Berlin should be "a
place of cooperation, not a point of con
frontation."
As he did during a visit to Bonn as
vice president in June 1987, Bush in
Mainz called for expanded air access to
Berlin and the staging of more inter
national meetings and sports events
there.
Bush said as minefields and barbed
wire fences are being removed between
Hungary and Austria, "so must they
fall through Eastern Europe."
He added: "Let Berlin be next."
The crowd assembled in a hall in this
Rhineland city vigorously applauded
every reference to erasing the division
of Europe that followed the defeat of
Nazi Germany in World War 11.

He praised Germany as a cradle of
democracy, made no reference to the
war or its atrocities and said:
"The passion for freedom cannot be
denied forever. The world has waited
long enough. The time is right. Let Eu
rope be whole and free."
In contrast, Bush gave the crowd at
the ambassador's residence a brief,
campaign-style speech.
"I hope what happened in NATO
guarantees the future," he said of the
decision taken by the 16 allied govern
ments Tuesday to challenge Gorbachev
with a new proposal for reductions in
troops, tanks, artillery and combat
aircraft.
Bush has called for completion of a
conventional forces agreement within a
year, but Secretary of State James
Baker acknowledged yesterday that the
timetable may be too optimistic.
"A lot is going to depend, quite frank
ly, on the Soviet response," Baker said.
"The ball now is clearly in their court."
Warsaw Pact representatives at the
Vienna arms reduction talks were up
beat yesterday about Bush's proposals.
