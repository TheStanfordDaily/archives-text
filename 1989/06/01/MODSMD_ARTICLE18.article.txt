# Koop declares war on alcohol ads
## 
### 
WASHINGTON IAP) - Sur
geon General C. Everett Koop,
standing on a stage yesterday with
ads featuring beer-promoting dog
Spuds MacKenzie and Miller Lite
beach parties, called for restric
tions on alcohol advertising to
help curb drunken driving.
Koop urged Congress to support
the effort and also proposed much
tougher state blood-alcohol stand
ards to determine when a driver
is legally drunk, increased taxes
on all alcoholic beverages, and a
series of voluntary restraints from
the industry and advertising
media.
The recommendations, which
arose from e conference Koop or
ganized in December to combat
drunken driving, brought imme
diate protests from distillers and
the National Association of
Broadcasters. A spokesman for
Anheuser-Busch said the propos

als would "dramatically increase
government intrusion into our
lives" without stopping alcohol
abuse.
Koop, in what he said would be
his last news conference before
leaving office July 13, said he did
not support bans on or prohibition
of alcohol advertising. But he did
ask for some advertising restric
tions and bans on some promo
tional efforts involving alcoholic
products.
He proposed that alcohol adver
tising be matched with pro-health
and safety messages, financed by
the industry or by federal and
state government, if necessary.
Tax deductions for alcohol adver
tising promotions other than price
and product advertising should be
eliminated, he said.
Pointing to ads featuring Bud
weiser's well-known Spuds MacK
enzie and Miller Lite beer beach

parties, Koop said, "These prac
tices tell youth that alcohol con
sumption leads to athletic, social
and sexual success."
Stephen Lambright, a spokes
man for Anheuser-Busch which
produces Budweiser, said the dog
ads have been used extensively to
promote responsible drinking. He
said the overall market for beer
has been flat for several years and
denied that Budweiser aims its
ads at young people or tries to
encourage people to drink who
don't already imbibe.
Beer prices would double under
Koop's proposals, Lambright said.
F.A. Meister, president of the
Distilled Spirits Council, said the
surgeon general's panel was
trying to solve drunken driving
by eliminating drinking rather
than working to make drunken
driving socially unacceptable.
