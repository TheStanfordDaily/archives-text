North wants convictions dropped
WASHINGTON (AP) — Oliver North says a
judge should set aside his convictions in the Iran-
Contra affair because the prosecution made cri
tical errors, including failure to show any prin
cipal figure "intended to violate the law."
In court papers filed late Tuesday, North said
the government neglected to show that anyone
intended to obstruct Congress when North, in
November 1986, assisted in assembling a false
chronology of an arms shipment to Iran.
North was convicted of aiding and abetting the
obstruction, but "a fundamental requirement of
any conviction for aiding and abetting is that
the jury first find a guilty principal," the court
papers said.
The government "did not demonstrate that any
principal intended to violate the law and to
obstruct Congress in November 1986," North's
lawyers said in their filing in U.S. District Court.
Former national security adviser John Poin
dexter is charged with obstruction and making

false statements to Congress in connection with
the chronology Poindexter is expected to go on
trial later this year.
Californians rush to beat £un ban
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - Sales of semi
automatic weapons boomed in California as the
June 1 deadline for the state's mandatory permit
application drew near, and gun dealers said the
meaner-looking the gun the better the sales.
Customers bought "anything that looks ugly,
that looks like an assault weapon anything that
may look military," said Tony Cucchiara, presi
dent of Trader Sports in San Leandro, the state's
largest retail gun dealer.
Buyers of the weapons included collectors, in
vestors, "yuppies," and others who hoped to es
cape the more restrictive buying process going
into effect today.
Most of Cucchiara's customers were older men,
and many shoppers were "buying the more ex
pensive guns and buying more than one."
