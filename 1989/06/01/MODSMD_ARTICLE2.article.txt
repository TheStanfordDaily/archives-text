# Marchers find doors locked
## Webb Ranch workers head for President's office 
### Mike Habata Staff writer 
Calling on University President
Donald Kennedy to assume moral
responsibility for living and work
ing conditions at Webb Ranch,
about 60 students and community
members marched with Webb
Ranch farm workers to Kennedy's
office yesterday.
The marchers had intended to
deliver a petition signed by almost
1,200 Stanford students and com
munity members, but their plan
was thwarted when they found
the doors to Building 10, where
Kennedy's office is located, locked.
The march followed a noon rally
in White Plaza to show support
for the workers' struggle to im
prove their living conditions at
Webb Ranch, a 250-acre private
berry farm located on Stanford
land along Interstate 280 near Al
pine Road.
Among the speakers at the rally
were workers from Webb Ranch,

representatives of the United
Stanford Workers and faculty
members. Several students who
were arrested at the May 15
takeover of Kennedy's office spoke
of a common struggle for basic
human respect and dignity.
Political Science Prof. John
Manley, a longtime supporter of
the Webb Ranch workers, scolded
Kennedy for his "unconscionable
stand" on the situation.
"No self-respecting university
takes profits from the labor of
those living in poverty," he told
the crowd at the rally. "That
money is tainted and has no busi
ness here."
After the speeches, the crowd
marched through White Plaza and
the Quad to Kennedy's office,
chanting slogans and clapping.
The rally leaders planned to
present the petition to Kennedy
and obtain his signature as "lan
downer" on a document which au
thorizes an independent
Community Action Agency to

begin work improving housing
conditions at Webb Ranch.
However, when they attempted
to enter the building, the rally
leaders found the doors were
locked. Although they knocked re
peatedly, the doors were never
opened.
According to Linda Crouse,
chief steward for the USW, Ken
nedy had been notified of their
intentions several days earlier.
Bob Hamrdla, assistant to the
president, said he and Kennedy
were eating lunch in Otero House
with Kennedy's advisees, and had
not left instructions for the doors
to be locked.
After waiting unsuccessfully
until 1 p.m. for Kennedy to return
from his lunch hour, the crowd
slowly dispersed. Crouse said the
action "reflects a stand [by the
Universityl on Stanford students
and the USW.
"We'll be back," she promised.

Webb Ranch farm workers rally In White Plaza to show their strength after almost 1,200 students
signed a petition supporting their cause.
English Prof. Ronald Rebholz,
a leader of the rally, called the
response "a mean-spirited affront
that has been characteristic of this
administration." Calling through
the window of Building 10 to
Stanford Police Chief Marvin Her
rington, Rebholz asked "Why are
the doors locked, Marv?"
Marlene Wine, special secretary

to Kennedy, said Herrington
decided to lock the doors, but she
would not discuss his reasons for
this decision.
Herrington was unavailable for
comment last night.
Rebholz later speculated that
the staff feared the rally members
would sit in or take over the of
fice, although he added "there was
certainly no threat to sit in."
On April 6 the Webb Ranch
workers fulfilled their first goal
of joining the USW.
