## One dandy Draw 
### 
FOUR YEARS of guaranteed
housing has almost become
a dream come true this
year: Results for Round Two of
the Draw revealed that 89 percent
of undergraduates were assigned
campus housing.
Much of the success can be at
tributed to the hard work and
creativity of the Housing Center,
which has turned the unfortu
nate closing of Roble Hall into a
boon for students seeking
housing.
Upon the emergency closure of
Roble last winter, housing offi
cials scrambled to create new
spaces in the Draw for under
graduates left high and dry by
the sudden dearth of available
rooms. The opening of Rains
apartments for graduate students
created more spaces for under
graduates in Manzanita Park,
Crothers Memorial and Escon
dido Village.

When the Housing Center
added those spaces with the
opening of Roble next year, it
was able to allocate housing to
all but 424 undergraduates.
Although the Housing Center's
achievement should not be
downplayed, those 424 students
must feel awful.
Housing Center Director
Rodger Whitney predicted that
all students could receive an as
signment next fall, provided they
are willing to live anywhere on
campus.
Anywhere? The options are
tantalizing indeed: ant-infested
tin can trailers, cinder blocks
Stern Hall and decrepit Row
houses.
If Stanford is committed to cre
ating a cohesive community and
offering a true residential educa
tion, then four years of guaran
teed housing must become a
reality.
