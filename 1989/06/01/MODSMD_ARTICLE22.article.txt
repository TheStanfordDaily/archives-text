# A trashy trend
## 
### 
SPRING CLEANING is
looming before all of us who
will soon rush to pack it up
before heading home. But rather
than unload all unwanteds in the
garbage it's time for students to
think before they trash their ex
tras.
Someone else could probably
use that old sweater or broken
bike that you are about to chuck.
And a couple of campus services
make it simple to make a differ
ence.
In the past and again this year
Goodwill has set up a trailer,
open today through June 23, lo
cated in the Wilbur Parking lot.
Goodwill accepts almost anything
you're willing to give, with a spe
cial need for old clothes and

bikes.
For those too busy to make the
trek to Wilbur, a new campus
service, Project Sharing, has set
up big cardboard collection boxes
in almost all campus residences.
The project is looking for dona
tions including clean, usable
clothing, blankets, clean linens,
books, bikes and small appliances
in working order.
If you are graduating or just
don't need or want your bike any
more, don't cast it away on
campus.
Goodwill and Project Sharing
will gratefully accept all bikes. In
recent years, Goodwill has re
ceived about 100 bikes which
have in turn been fixed up and
sold.
