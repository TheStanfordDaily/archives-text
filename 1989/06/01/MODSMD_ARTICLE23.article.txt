## Republicans aren't threatened like most minorities 
### 
WE ARE WRITING in response
to Keith Rabois' letter concern
ing the "abuse" and "intimida
tion" that Republicans at Stanford
experience. His letter is a slap to
minorities and undermines the injus
tices they face daily as well as the
legacy of their oppression.
Although some Stanford Republicans
may feel uncomfortable, they do not
experience institutional discrimination.
To equate the two experiences is in
sulting and disrespectful to truly op
pressed minority groups.
It is highly unlikely that Rabois will
ever be denied a job because of his
party or, once he had a job, be paid
less.

Also he misrepresents the liberal
movement on campus by calling it
"liberal fascism." Use of the word
fascism is highly ironic considering it
connotes right-wing aggressive
nationalism and racism.
Although in his letter he disagrees
with appealing to emotions to gain
support for liberal causes, he resorts to
this same technique by indiscriminately
throwing a word like "fascism" around
to gain support for his cause.
A further misrepresentation is his
assertion that Residential Education
grants special preference to gay resi
dent assistant applicants. According to
the Res Ed office, this is untrue, and
in fact in most cases, the applicant's

sexual preference is unknown.
Also, initially Rabois asserts that the
purpose of the Republican flier
[promoting ride-a-bike-in-support-of-
Republicans day] was "not an attack
on homosexuals but rather a question
ing of the gay community's tactics."
Later, he cites the "secondary purpose"
of the Republican flier as having "the
approximately 2,064 students who rode
bikes to class May 18 be forced to ride
around thinking that someone might
actually think they were a Republi-
W
can.
He continues, "I know some were
scared — so the event must have
worked." This was the same tactic and
purpose for which he criticized Gay

and Lesbian Awareness Week. So it
seems that Rabois does in fact endorse
those tactics.
In conclusion, Rabois claims that
fliers "with women on them" challenge
leftist assumptions and by criticizing
such fliers we silence robust discourse.
Fliers which depict women as the
implied bonus of a party are not leftist
or rightist, but sexist. Rabois' letter
belittles the plight of minorities and
women on this campus and in society;
in doing so his letter smacks of ar
rogance.
