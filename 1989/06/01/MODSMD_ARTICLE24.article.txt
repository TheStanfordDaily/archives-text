# Daily's editorial asks University to forgo idea of justice
## 
### 
Why is it so difficult for the Daily's
editorial staff to understand a simple
concept? Under the outrageous head
line "Unequal justice," the Daily ac
cuses me of demonstrating "flawed
logic" by stating that "different roles
played by the students who occupied
(my) office will affect the severity of
penalties they might receive."
Flawed? I invite everyone to consider
what I have said, not only on KZSU
but in a dozen other places during the
past week. There are different penalties
for different behaviours. In the very
first line of its editorial, the Daily says
"equal offenses warrant equal punish
ment." Just so.
And, in addition, unequal offenses
warrant unequal punishment. To give
the broadest possible statement to the
principle, in case it still isn't clear,

consequences are determined by ac
tions.
Finally, to those who agree with The
Daily that students who are "only
trying to improve their situation at the
University" deserve no penalties at all
— presumably for any action they
might care to undertake — I have one
suggestion. Please read Prof. David
Abernethy's letter in the May 22 Daily
on the subject of civil disobedience. I
could not possibly improve on it.
