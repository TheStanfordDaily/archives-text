# Stanford students abet cycle of crime by purchasing drugs
##

The director of the Ecumenical
Hunger Program said in a panel dis
cussion: "Before Stanford divests from
South Africa, divest from East Palo
Alto."
She means that the Stanford stu-

dents who purchase recreational drugs
such as pot and crack directly finance
the drug trafficking and poverty.
It doesn't matter who Stanford stu
dents buy the drugs from; all peddlers
are involved in the drug circle. And so
are their families. Many children are
neglected and abused because their
parents are peddling and abusing
drugs.
They may enter prostitution or be
come drug peddlers themselves to sup
port their drug habit which they pick
up in their teens. They will have
children at age 14 because there was
no parent to teach them otherwise.
They will also abuse and neglect their
own kids.
Drug trafficking undoubtedly causes
this cycle of poverty because two to
three decades ago when drugs were not
in demand, East Palo Alto was a much
better neighborhood.
So the next time some of you decide
to use drugs, please at least acknowl
edge that you are directly responsible
for ruining a child's life.
