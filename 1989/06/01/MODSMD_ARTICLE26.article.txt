# Gays and lesbians don't get a break in RA selections
## 
### 
I would like to address a point made
by Keith Rabois in his May 30 letter.
He states that Residential Education
gives special preference to gay resident
assistant applicants.
This has no basis in fact. Gay, les
bian and bisexual applicants are en
couraged to apply because Res Ed
seeks to have the full range of student
diversity (including Republicans)
reflected in the residence staffs. Once
the process is underway, however, no
preference is given to any candidate
Candidates are not considered on the
basis of what they believe, but rather
on the basis of how effectively they
present their views and how they dem
onstrate that they are open to views
other than those they hold.
