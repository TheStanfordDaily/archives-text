## The bull behind CIV
### 
IT'S TIME TO CALL the bluff of the
Cultures, Ideas and Values require
ment.
Last month the faculty who teach CIV
met to decide what would constitute the
mandated shared intellectual content for
the requirement. (Although CIV scrapped
Western Culture's famous 15-book
reading list, the CIV legislation still man
dates that the tracks contain "shared in
tellectual content.") What they produced
is neither radical nor surprising.
Unfortunately, it is also too vague to
be meaningful.
The CIV teachers have proposed to
satisfy the "shared intellectual content"
clauses with three authors and three
vague "categories": The Bible, "a Classi
cal Greek philosopher," "an early Chris
tian thinker (may include Aquinas)," "a
Renaissance playwright," Marx and
Freud.
Get real. These categories are not a
means by which to satisfy the shared
intellectual content clauses; they are a
means by which to evade them.
Unlike "the Vienna circle" or "the
Bloomsbury group," "Classical Greek
philosophers" are not a coherent intellec
tual unit. The only thing that unites
Plato, Parmenides, Thales, Heraclitus et
al is the accident of birth â€” they are all
very dead, somewhat white guys who
spake dialects of the same basic language
and lived somewhere in the Mediter
ranean basin.
And how about "an early Christian
thinker (may include Aquinas)"? I don't
want to belabor the obvious, but Paul (c.
100 AD) is very different in both context

and thought from Augustine (c. 500 AD)
who is very different from Aquinas (c.
1200 AD) who is the antithesis of an
"early" Christian thinker.
This category, which spans a time pe
riod that covers roughly a third of re
corded history, rests on the bogus
proposition that these thinkers are so
interchangeable that if you read Paul and
I read Aquinas we will have had a "shared
intellectual experience."
Bullshit.
But let's close our minds to the intel
lectual lies that emanate from these
categories and focus instead on the repug
nant abdications of pedagogical respon
sibility at the core of this lowest common
denominator approach to higher educa
tion.
The reason that we have "a Classical
Greek philosopher" instead of Plato and
"a Renaissance dramatist" instead of
Shakespeare is that some tracks claim
that Plato and Shakespeare do not "fit"
into their planned curricula.
Well, tough luck. The point of the Area
One requirement is not to feed freshmen
into whatever course an instructor feels
like teaching, but rather to provide the
foundations of a culturally diverse liberal
education.
And as for the assertion that Plato or
Shakespeare won't "fit" in a particular
track: such a statement is so shallow as
to be almost beneath contempt.
One of the factors that makes a great
book from any culture a great book in
all cultures is flexibility. Neither Shake
speare nor Plato talks about one subject
from one perspective, unlike many of the

not-so-great works of modernity which
are touted, ironically, as remedies for
"closed-mindedness."
Shakespeare and Plato are amenable
to a variety of approaches, perspectives
and disciplines, and have been throughout
Western intellectual history. But if an
instructor really thinks Plato can't bring
out a subject as well as Aristotle, no one
is saying the class can't read Aristotle
as well.
Any set of common texts, themes or
authors provides only a bare minimum
of readings designed to ensure some
degree of equal footing, not a ceiling be
yond which no track shall rise.
This early adoption of vague categories
in lieu of concrete texts or authors or
themes signals the disintegration of CIV.
Without significant shared intellectual
content, there is no mechanism to insure
educational coherence in CIV except the
goodwill of the instructors in the various
tracks.
CIV was designed to be a serious re
quirement. Stanford should either take
it seriously or get rid of it and allow
students to spend their 15 units more
productively.
