# Pipe burst causes ASSU office flood
## 
### Janine DeFao Staff writer 
Although the rest of California is experiencing a
drought, Tresidder Union was hit by a flash flood
yesterday morning.
At about 10 a.m., water began to rush from a
pipe in the loft of the second-floor ASSU office.
According to Jeanette Smith-Laws, building services
manager at Tresidder, the pipe is part of a sprinkler
system being installed for the new addition to the
student union.
The pipe burst when United Fire Systems, the
subcontractor in charge of the installation, was test
ing the system to see if it met the fire code, she
said. Water continued to pour from the pipe until
the subcontractor and the University Plumbing Shop
responded 10 minutes later.
The floors of the Ad Agency office in the loft, a
second-floor conference room and the ASSU Lecture
Notes, Dry Cleaning and Legal Counseling offices
were covered with 3 inches of water.
Jack and Cohen, the contractor in charge of the
sprinkler installation, will be held responsible for
any lost or damaged items, Smith-Laws said.
The water pressure was so great that it "blew
the legs off' a desk in the Ad Agency, according to
senior Cindy Wurtenberg, Lecture Note manager.
"It rained on everything," she added.
Temporary receptionist Sheila McNerney said the
water was "really loud. It sounded like a waterfall."
Junior Sheilon King, ASSU administrative man
ager, was one of the first to discover the flood. "I
was in the business office and we heard a gushing
sound," she said.
She and her assisitant Kent Bressi ran out to see
water rushing into the hallway and offices. They
were met by Council of Presidents members David
Brown, Canetta Ivy and Stacey Leyton who were
in the midst of being interviewed by the Peninsula
Times Tribune.
Together they moved papers from Lecture Notes
