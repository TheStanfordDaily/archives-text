# Pipe burst causes ASSU office flood
## 
### Janine DeFao Staff writer 
Although the rest of California is experiencing a
drought, Tresidder Union was hit by a flash flood
yesterday morning.
At about 10 a.m., water began to rush from a
pipe in the loft of the second-floor ASSU office.
According to Jeanette Smith-Laws, building services
manager at Tresidder, the pipe is part of a sprinkler
system being installed for the new addition to the
student union.
The pipe burst when United Fire Systems, the
subcontractor in charge of the installation, was test
ing the system to see if it met the fire code, she
said. Water continued to pour from the pipe until
the subcontractor and the University Plumbing Shop
responded 10 minutes later.
The floors of the Ad Agency office in the loft, a
second-floor conference room and the ASSU Lecture
Notes, Dry Cleaning and Legal Counseling offices
were covered with 3 inches of water.
Jack and Cohen, the contractor in charge of the
sprinkler installation, will be held responsible for
any lost or damaged items, Smith-Laws said.
The water pressure was so great that it "blew
the legs off' a desk in the Ad Agency, according to
senior Cindy Wurtenberg, Lecture Note manager.
"It rained on everything," she added.
Temporary receptionist Sheila McNerney said the
water was "really loud. It sounded like a waterfall."
Junior Sheilon King, ASSU administrative man
ager, was one of the first to discover the flood. "I
was in the business office and we heard a gushing
sound," she said.
She and her assisitant Kent Bressi ran out to see
water rushing into the hallway and offices. They
were met by Council of Presidents members David
Brown, Canetta Ivy and Stacey Leyton who were
in the midst of being interviewed by the Peninsula
Times Tribune.

Water burst from a pipe yesterday on the second floor of the ASSU offices in
Tresidder Union. The water blasted out, forcing this table apart and damaging much
of this room.
and covered the copier, removed
clothes from Dry Cleaning and
took the computer out of Legal
Services.
Damages have yet to be deter
mined, according to Smith-Laws.
It had appeared that Lecture
Notes' $40,000 copier might be
damaged because water got inside,
but a check yesterday afternoon
by Kodak showed no problems.
In addition, some copies of
printed lecture notes had to be
discarded because of water
damage. Lecture Notes, which
closed in the morning, reopened
late yesterday afternoon.
Dry Cleaning may not have
fared as well. All the clothes that
were in the office were drenched
by the downpour. Dry Cleaning
Manager Cliff Ye said that every
thing would be sent out to be
recleaned.
"We don't expect too much
damage," he said, but added that
if any clothes were ruined, the
owners would be reimbursed.
Ye added that he informed
Tresidder officials late last week
that water had been dripping from
the ceiling of the office for about
a week, but nothing had been
done.
Dry Cleaning closed yesterday
after the accident, but will reopen
today at 4 p.m. The service will
still send clothes out tomorrow
and will close for the year tomor
row as scheduled, Ye said.
John Black of the Ad Agency
said there was "paint and water
splattered all over" when he en
tered the office at noon. Some
artwork in the office was also
damaged by water and some fliers
were soaked, Black added.
"It's more of an inconvenience
than anything. It's hard to be up
set," Black said. "I'm not even
sure who to be upset at." He
added, however, that if anyone
had been in the office they prob
ably would have been hurt. Be
sides the broken desk, there was
also "a glass jar that got blown
against a wall," he said.
