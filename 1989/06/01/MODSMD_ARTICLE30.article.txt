Letter misportrayed
case of gay students
on Stanford campus
As both a homosexual and a resident
assistant for '89-'90, I would like to
respond to some of the statements
made in Stanford College Republicans
President Keith Rabois' May 30 letter.
With regard to the hiring of RAs,
I'm not sure where Rabois obtained
his information, but I can assure him
from personal experience that there is
no "special preference" given to gay
applicants. I found it just as difficult
to obtain interviews with resident fel
lows as did many of my straight
friends, and at no time was it ever
stated or implied that my homosexu
ality would make anything easier for
me.
The only part of the entire applica
tion process which could be grossly
misinterpreted as favoring homosexual
RA applicants was a small program at
the beginning of the process which was
put together to try to ease some of the
fears gay and lesbian applicants might
have about dealing with homophobic
residents.
It was made very clear at this meet
ing that homosexual applicants had no
more of a chance of becoming an RA
than did any other student and that

applicants harboring such ideas
shouldn't apply.
As Deputy Director of the ASSU
Publications Board, the body charged
with assigning office space in the
Storke Student Publications Building, I
can sympathize with Rabois' concern
over the lack of student space available
on this campus, especially since no
new spaces have been created in over
25 years.
At the same time, however, I do feel
the Lesbian/Gay/Bisexual Community
Center serves a very important pur
pose.
Approximately 1,300 students on
campus are gay or lesbian, and the
numbers grow even larger if you add
in bisexuals. Unlike the Republicans,
however, who find it "very intimidating
to express conservative values and
ideas at Stanford" r or reasons Rabois

does not describe, the recent anti
homosexual chalkings which appeared
across campus point out the very real
threats to the homosexual community.
I cannot remember any recent inci
dents of residents attacking their RAs,
urinating on a roommate's possessions
or asking for a room change simply
because their RA or roommate was a
Republican. Nor can I recall the last
time government agencies such as the
CIA, FBI and armed forces (all of
which recruit on campus) actively dis
criminated against Republicans; or
when the President's cabinet drew up
proposals to make it easier for govern
ment agencies to selectively discrimi
nate against Republicans without
giving a reason; or when the rate of
violent crimes reported against Republi
cans was over three times the national
average; or, more simply, when two

Republicans were ridiculed for showing
affection towards one another in White
Plaza.
All of these apply to homosexuals.
With this in mind, then, I do not
feel that the space utilized by the
LGBCC in the Firetruck House is
being wasted. The lesbian, gay and
bisexual community at Stanford faces
an uphill battle against both verbal
and physical abuse.
To say that the community is
"taking advantage of the publicity sur
rounding 'homophobic' incidents" in
order to coerce the University into
giving them office space is ludicrous. If
these "homophobic incidents" did not
exist, there would be no need for the
LGBCC.

CAPS maintains
ethical standards
despite recent news
In light of recent allegations concern
ing Dr. Paul Walters and events that
may have occured at Harvard Universi
ty, it is inevitable that concerns will be
raised about the potential for abuse of
patients by psychotherapists and coun
selors.

The staff of Counseling and Psycho
logical Services would like to assure
the Stanford community of our firm
belief that sexual behavior between
patients and therapists cannot be con
doned at any time or under any cir
cumstances.
Sexual or other exploitation of
patients violates all the ethical norms
that govern the conduct of the mental
health professions. The basic principle
of the medical profession, primum non
nocere— "first, do not harm," —
guides all of us in our practice.
The same holds true for the conduct
of every health care practitioner at the
Cowell Student Health Center. We are
not aware of any situations in which a
Stanford student has been sexually
exploited by anyone at Cowell, either
currently or in the past.
We pledge ourselves to provide Stan
ford students with a quality of health
care services that not only reflects
good medical care but also treats stu
dents with respect, honesty and com
passion.

despite recent news
In light of recent allegations concern
ing Dr. Paul Walters and events that
may have occured at Harvard Universi

raised about the potential for abuse of
patients by psychotherapists and coun
selors.

The staff of Counseling and Psycho

the Stanford community of our firm
belief that sexual behavior between
patients and therapists cannot be con
doned at any time or under any cir
cumstances.
Sexual or other exploitation of
patients violates all the ethical norms
that govern the conduct of the mental
health professions. The basic principle
of the medical profession, primum non
nocere— "first, do not harm," —
guides all of us in our practice.
The same holds true for the conduct
of every health care practitioner at the
Cowell Student Health Center. We are
not aware of any situations in which a
Stanford student has been sexually
exploited by anyone at Cowell, either
currently or in the past.
We pledge ourselves to provide Stan
ford students with a quality of health
care services that not only reflects
good medical care but also treats stu
dents with respect, honesty and com
passion.

Letter misportrayed
case of gay students
on Stanford campus
As both a homosexual and a resident
assistant for '89-'90, I would like to
respond to some of the statements
made in Stanford College Republicans
President Keith Rabois' May 30 letter.
With regard to the hiring of RAs,
I'm not sure where Rabois obtained
his information, but I can assure him
from personal experience that there is
no "special preference" given to gay
applicants. I found it just as difficult
to obtain interviews with resident fel
lows as did many of my straight
friends, and at no time was it ever
stated or implied that my homosexu
ality would make anything easier for
me.
The only part of the entire applica
tion process which could be grossly
misinterpreted as favoring homosexual
RA applicants was a small program at
the beginning of the process which was
put together to try to ease some of the
fears gay and lesbian applicants might
have about dealing with homophobic
residents.
It was made very clear at this meet
ing that homosexual applicants had no
more of a chance of becoming an RA
than did any other student and that

applicants harboring such ideas
shouldn't apply.
As Deputy Director of the ASSU
Publications Board, the body charged
with assigning office space in the
Storke Student Publications Building, I
can sympathize with Rabois' concern
over the lack of student space available
on this campus, especially since no
new spaces have been created in over
25 years.
At the same time, however, I do feel
the Lesbian/Gay/Bisexual Community
Center serves a very important pur
pose.
Approximately 1,300 students on
campus are gay or lesbian, and the
numbers grow even larger if you add
in bisexuals. Unlike the Republicans,
however, who find it "very intimidating
to express conservative values and
ideas at Stanford" r or reasons Rabois

does not describe, the recent anti
homosexual chalkings which appeared
across campus point out the very real
threats to the homosexual community.
I cannot remember any recent inci
dents of residents attacking their RAs,
urinating on a roommate's possessions
or asking for a room change simply
because their RA or roommate was a
Republican. Nor can I recall the last
time government agencies such as the
CIA, FBI and armed forces (all of
which recruit on campus) actively dis
criminated against Republicans; or
when the President's cabinet drew up
proposals to make it easier for govern
ment agencies to selectively discrimi
nate against Republicans without
giving a reason; or when the rate of
violent crimes reported against Republi
cans was over three times the national
average; or, more simply, when two

Republicans were ridiculed for showing
affection towards one another in White
Plaza.
All of these apply to homosexuals.
With this in mind, then, I do not
feel that the space utilized by the
LGBCC in the Firetruck House is
being wasted. The lesbian, gay and
bisexual community at Stanford faces
an uphill battle against both verbal
and physical abuse.
To say that the community is
"taking advantage of the publicity sur
rounding 'homophobic' incidents" in
order to coerce the University into
giving them office space is ludicrous. If
these "homophobic incidents" did not
exist, there would be no need for the
LGBCC.
