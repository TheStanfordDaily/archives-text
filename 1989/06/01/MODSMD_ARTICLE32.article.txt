## It'll be Lakers-Pistons II: Championship series matchups 
### 
Just so you know how certain I am
that the Detroit Pistons will meet
the Los Angeles Lakers for NBA
title, 1 finished this diatribe before the
start of last night's game five of the
Eastern Conference finals.
I figured there would be the annual
rush to analyze the various matchups in
the championship series, and I wanted
to get a jump on the competition.
It's hard to imagine a series that will
provide more excitement than last year's
battle between Detriot and L.A. The Pis
tons, up 3-2 in the series, led by three
with a minute left in game six at the
Forum. A 15-footer by Byron Scott, an
ill-advised Dennis Rodman jumper and
two free throws by The Captain, Kareem
Abdul-Jabbar, kept L.A. from extinction.
Game 7 was a Laker blowout for over
three stanzas, but Detroit still made L.A.
sweat with a truly remarkable fourth
quarter comeback.
This year's war promises to be equally
scintillating. People used to get bored
with the constant Laker-Celtic finals, ar
guing that nothing ever changed.
Well, they were right, to an extent.
While the players didn't change,
there were very subtle differences that
made each series unique. One year it was
Cedric "Cornbread" Maxwell's garbage on

the offensive glass that doomed the
Lakers.
Another, Mitch Kupchak's pounding on
the Celtic big people helped bury the men
in green. Each year a different player
would come to the fore, while the stars
— mainly Magic and Bird — went about
their proverbial business.
The pending Laker-Piston bout can be
seen as an extension of last season's grand
finale. The changes, some more subtle
than others, are quite significant and will
alter the complexion of this series. Here
is a position-by-position rundown of the
coming NBA foray:
Center — Bill Laimbeer and James
Edwards vs. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and
Mychal Thompson : Teams have ex
ploited Kareem on the offensive glass all

season, but Laimbeer's favorite spot, the
top of the key, will prevent him from
taking full advantage, and that's fine with
the Lakers. Edwards, forever known as
a softie in the paint, has had some of
the Eastern Conference rub off on him.
He still would rather shoot a fadeaway
15-footer than bang inside, but he loves
the baseline, and thus will challenge and
beat Kareem for weakside caroms.
Kareem's lateral movement is gone and
he barely gets off his toes when the ball
comes off the iron.
Mychal Thompson, who now sees much
more action than the Franchise — boy
is that nickname a misnomer these days
— provides special problems for both
Laimbeer and Edwards. In three words,
he can run. Both Piston centers will be
hard-pressed to chase a converted power
forward on the break. And Thompson is
quicker than both as well, which means
some sneaky offensive boards at the most
opportune moments.
When he's in the game, Thompson's
performance on the defensive glass is cri
tical. Look for Detroit to pull Laimbeer
and Edwards way out to make rebound
ing difficult for Thompson. By clearing
the paint, Detroit can send crashers John
Salley and Dennis Rodman in full bore.
For the scheme to be successful, Laim

beer must hit his bombs and Edwards'
rainbow turnarounds must fall.
Power forward — Rick Mahorn and
John Salley vs. A.C. Green and Orlando
Woolridge : Mahorn's intrinsic value is
a mystery to me. He is a thug through
and through. No diamond-cutter inside,
Mahorn's only worth is in grabbing
rebounds and hurling bodies. Maybe
that's why he starts, plays several un
productive minutes and then gives way
to John Salley. At any rate, if Mahorn
miraculously learned discipline in less
than a week, he could be a real factor
in the series. Realistically, he will cause
most of his problems on the offensive
glass against the smaller Green.
Figure on Salley logging a lot of
minutes against both Green and Wool
ridge. This will be one of the most in
teresting matchups to watch and may
decide the series. Salley slinks to the
offensive glass as few can, and Green is
almost as successful in the same depart
ment because, simply, he works his butt
off. Salley's offensive game is a little more
versatile than Green's, but neither is
asked to score much. Both love to fill
the lane on the break, but not at the
expense of defensive boards. They must
pick and choose when to release with the
utmost prudence.

Things may get even more interesting
when Woolridge enters the game. He is
stronger than Salley, much stronger. Just
look at the man's arms. Though mainly
a shot blocker and rebounder in the
Lakers' scheme, Woolridge has been find
ing ways in the playoffs to get into L.A.'s
offense without being obtrusive.
He can get out in transition, loves to
drive in the half-court set and puts back
misses with authority. And with his
physique, Woolridge has no reason to
back down to anyone. He has found him
self at just the right time and may be
the difference between a "Three-peat"
and a long summer for the Lakers. When
Woolridge and Green briefly played side
by-side against Phoenix to rest James
Worthy, the alignment was quite effective.
Small forward — Mark Aguirre and
Dennis Rodman vs. James Worthy: Just
as Woolridge has assumed the departed
Kurt Rambis' spot in the Laker rotation,
Aguirre has replaced the irrepressible
Adrian Dantley in the Piston scheme.
Dantley carried the Pistons in the half
court set against L.A. in last year's finals.
No one on the Laker roster could touch
his patented fall away. Dantley's awkward
release makes it impossible to defense.


ROBERT PORTNOY
Aguirre uses a quick release to
get his shot off and can be equally
effective. Aguirre's modest beef
poses some problems for Worthy
on the offensive glass in particu
lar, and Aguirre gets up and down
the floor better than Dantley. But
Aguirre will find himself bushed
as he sprints to keep up with will
o'-the-wisp Worthy, and Worthy's
post-up game is as good as any
in the game. Both players will get
their points — whoever contri
butes the most defensively may
be the winner of this classic
matchup.
When Rodman is in the game,
everything is thrown out of kilter.
The 6- foot-4-inch leaper will play
small forward but spend much of
his time hounding Magic Johnson.
There were times in last year's
finals when Rodman appeared to
actually shut down Buck, as
Magic's teammates like to call
him.
Rodman's unique athletic abil
ity allows him to shut down pass

ing lanes that are open to Magic
against almost any guard in the
league. On offense, Rodman will
make Worthy — and any other
Laker forward — do hard time
on the defensive glass. You can't
defense Rodman with a guard be
cause he rebounds so big. He
hauled down 18 in Detroit's game
four win over Chicago.
If Detroit is to win this series,
it may be on second shots, and
Salley and Rodman are the key
elements. The Lakers looked most
frustrated last year when Piston
put-backs were most frequent.
Point guard — Isiah Thomas
vs. Magic Johnson and Michael
Cooper: It's almost unfair to talk
about these two together because
they often don't guard each other
— Magic's height advantage is
around eight inches — but it
would also be an injustice not to
mention the best of friends in the
same breath. No one will forget
the smooches before the games
last year, nor Magic's body block
that sent an ailing Thomas to the
hardwood.
Whether or not they guard each
other, Magic and Isiah will always
be in direct confrontation. Each

prides himself on his ability to
command the flow of a game, and
whenever their teams get in trou
ble, look for them to take over.
Isiah's 40-plus point effort in
game six last year was a perfect
example, and Magic's history of
big-game heroics is headed by his
42-point effort when Jabbar was
hurt to beat the Sixer 3 in 1980,
his rookie year. He looks
rejuvenated with close-shaven
head and new baby face and has
played the first 11 Laker playoff
victories at a frenetic pace.
Cooper will be a defensive test
for Thomas when he relieves
Magic. Cooper was left off the
all-defensive team this season, but
he has turned it up a notch in
the playoffs. "Coop" had a signa
ture, high-flying block of a Jeff
Hornacek breakaway layup in the
final game of the Phoenix series.
He, like many of the Lakers,
seems to have saved something
extra this year just for the
playoffs. Thomas may have trou
ble getting off his jumper against
the taller Cooper, but a few
Thomas dribble-drives could force
Cooper to back off and let him
fire from long range.

Just as Woolridge has assumed the
departed Kurt Rambis' spot in the Laker
rotation, Aguirre has replaced the irre
pressible Adrian Dantley in the Piston
scheme. Aguirre uses a quick release to
get his shot off and can be equally
effective.

Shooting guard — Joe Dumars
and Vinnic Johnson vs. Byron
Scott: Scott is a proven scorer in
the Laker lineup and punished
the Suns with a 30-plus point per
formance in game four against the
Suns. Byron's outside shooting is
streaky but very predictable.
When he's on the move, he's
money in the bank — that in
cludes pull-ups on the break, off
screens in the half-court offense,
and the like. When he's wide open
and has too long to set himself,
forget it. The three-pointer is the
only shot he does better with extra
time. Also, you'll never see a Scott
drive end with a pull-up. He's

going to the hoop, period.
Dumars will not have as great
a visible impact as Scott, but his
role is just as crucial. Dumars is
the one who takes the pressure
off Thomas. Isiah carries the huge
burden of bringing the ball up,
running the break, running the
offense and providing backcourt
scoring. Dumars has to help in
one of those areas, and scoring is
where he can help most.
Dumars is a solid outside
shooter and won't be threatened
on defense by Scott, who is rarely
more than adequate in that de
partment. If the outside shot falls,
Scott won't be able to lay off, and

then both Piston guards can pen
etrate. Dumars gets a few calls
in the set offense, but most of the
plays for the off-guard are run
when Vinnie Johnson enters the
game.
Johnson, nicknamed the "Mi
crowave," is as savvy as they come
at getting off shots, even when he
gets only a phantom screen.
Johnson can shoot off balance on
the turnaround like few others.
If Scott is a streak shooter, then
Johnson may as well be naked. If
he hits a couple early, feed him.
If not, he may never surface the
entire ballgame. It's amazing that
a veteran player can still be so
hot and cold, but Johnson without
his trademark would be like
McDonald's without the arches.
Also, Johnson occasionally
handles the point duties to spell
Thomas.
What do we make of all this?
The most significant difference is
Woolridge. Early in the year, he
was a non-entity. No more. Like
almost everyone, I picked the Pis
tons to defeat L.A. before the start
of the year. I've changed my mind.
Forget the home-court advantage
— L.A. in six.
Just so you know how certain I am
that the Detroit Pistons will meet
the Los Angeles Lakers for NBA
title, 1 finished this diatribe before the

they often don't guard each other
— Magic's height advantage is
around eight inches — but it
would also be an injustice not to
mention the best of friends in the
same breath. No one will forget
the smooches before the games
last year, nor Magic's body block
that sent an ailing Thomas to the
hardwood.
Whether or not they guard each
other, Magic and Isiah will always
be in direct confrontation. Each

prides himself on his ability to
command the flow of a game, and
whenever their teams get in trou
ble, look for them to take over.
Isiah's 40-plus point effort in
game six last year was a perfect
example, and Magic's history of
big-game heroics is headed by his
42-point effort when Jabbar was
hurt to beat the Sixer 3 in 1980,
his rookie year. He looks
rejuvenated with close-shaven
head and new baby face and has
played the first 11 Laker playoff
victories at a frenetic pace.
Cooper will be a defensive test
for Thomas when he relieves
Magic. Cooper was left off the
all-defensive team this season, but
he has turned it up a notch in
the playoffs. "Coop" had a signa
ture, high-flying block of a Jeff
Hornacek breakaway layup in the
final game of the Phoenix series.
He, like many of the Lakers,
seems to have saved something
extra this year just for the
playoffs. Thomas may have trou
ble getting off his jumper against
the taller Cooper, but a few
Thomas dribble-drives could force
Cooper to back off and let him
fire from long range.

Just as Woolridge has assumed the
departed Kurt Rambis' spot in the Laker
rotation, Aguirre has replaced the irre
pressible Adrian Dantley in the Piston
scheme. Aguirre uses a quick release to
get his shot off and can be equally
effective.

Shooting guard — Joe Dumars
and Vinnic Johnson vs. Byron
Scott: Scott is a proven scorer in
the Laker lineup and punished
the Suns with a 30-plus point per
formance in game four against the
Suns. Byron's outside shooting is
streaky but very predictable.
When he's on the move, he's
money in the bank — that in
cludes pull-ups on the break, off
screens in the half-court offense,
and the like. When he's wide open
and has too long to set himself,
forget it. The three-pointer is the
only shot he does better with extra
time. Also, you'll never see a Scott
drive end with a pull-up. He's

going to the hoop, period.
Dumars will not have as great
a visible impact as Scott, but his
role is just as crucial. Dumars is
the one who takes the pressure
off Thomas. Isiah carries the huge
burden of bringing the ball up,
running the break, running the
offense and providing backcourt
scoring. Dumars has to help in
one of those areas, and scoring is
where he can help most.
Dumars is a solid outside
shooter and won't be threatened
on defense by Scott, who is rarely
more than adequate in that de
partment. If the outside shot falls,
Scott won't be able to lay off, and

then both Piston guards can pen
etrate. Dumars gets a few calls
in the set offense, but most of the
plays for the off-guard are run
when Vinnie Johnson enters the
game.
Johnson, nicknamed the "Mi
crowave," is as savvy as they come
at getting off shots, even when he
gets only a phantom screen.
Johnson can shoot off balance on
the turnaround like few others.
If Scott is a streak shooter, then
Johnson may as well be naked. If
he hits a couple early, feed him.
If not, he may never surface the
entire ballgame. It's amazing that
a veteran player can still be so
hot and cold, but Johnson without
his trademark would be like
McDonald's without the arches.
Also, Johnson occasionally
handles the point duties to spell
Thomas.
What do we make of all this?
The most significant difference is
Woolridge. Early in the year, he
was a non-entity. No more. Like
almost everyone, I picked the Pis
tons to defeat L.A. before the start
of the year. I've changed my mind.
Forget the home-court advantage
— L.A. in six.
Just so you know how certain I am
that the Detroit Pistons will meet
the Los Angeles Lakers for NBA
title, 1 finished this diatribe before the
start of last night's game five of the
Eastern Conference finals.
I figured there would be the annual
rush to analyze the various matchups in
the championship series, and I wanted
to get a jump on the competition.
It's hard to imagine a series that will
provide more excitement than last year's
battle between Detriot and L.A. The Pis
tons, up 3-2 in the series, led by three
with a minute left in game six at the
Forum. A 15-footer by Byron Scott, an
ill-advised Dennis Rodman jumper and
two free throws by The Captain, Kareem
Abdul-Jabbar, kept L.A. from extinction.
Game 7 was a Laker blowout for over
three stanzas, but Detroit still made L.A.
sweat with a truly remarkable fourth
quarter comeback.
This year's war promises to be equally
scintillating. People used to get bored
with the constant Laker-Celtic finals, ar
guing that nothing ever changed.
Well, they were right, to an extent.
While the players didn't change,
there were very subtle differences that
made each series unique. One year it was
Cedric "Cornbread" Maxwell's garbage on

the offensive glass that doomed the
Lakers.
Another, Mitch Kupchak's pounding on
the Celtic big people helped bury the men
in green. Each year a different player
would come to the fore, while the stars
— mainly Magic and Bird — went about
their proverbial business.
The pending Laker-Piston bout can be
seen as an extension of last season's grand
finale. The changes, some more subtle
than others, are quite significant and will
alter the complexion of this series. Here
is a position-by-position rundown of the
coming NBA foray:
Center — Bill Laimbeer and James
Edwards vs. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and
Mychal Thompson : Teams have ex
ploited Kareem on the offensive glass all

season, but Laimbeer's favorite spot, the
top of the key, will prevent him from
taking full advantage, and that's fine with
the Lakers. Edwards, forever known as
a softie in the paint, has had some of
the Eastern Conference rub off on him.
He still would rather shoot a fadeaway
15-footer than bang inside, but he loves
the baseline, and thus will challenge and
beat Kareem for weakside caroms.
Kareem's lateral movement is gone and
he barely gets off his toes when the ball
comes off the iron.
Mychal Thompson, who now sees much
more action than the Franchise — boy
is that nickname a misnomer these days
— provides special problems for both
Laimbeer and Edwards. In three words,
he can run. Both Piston centers will be
hard-pressed to chase a converted power
forward on the break. And Thompson is
quicker than both as well, which means
some sneaky offensive boards at the most
opportune moments.
When he's in the game, Thompson's
performance on the defensive glass is cri
tical. Look for Detroit to pull Laimbeer
and Edwards way out to make rebound
ing difficult for Thompson. By clearing
the paint, Detroit can send crashers John
Salley and Dennis Rodman in full bore.
For the scheme to be successful, Laim

beer must hit his bombs and Edwards'
rainbow turnarounds must fall.
Power forward — Rick Mahorn and
John Salley vs. A.C. Green and Orlando
Woolridge : Mahorn's intrinsic value is
a mystery to me. He is a thug through
and through. No diamond-cutter inside,
Mahorn's only worth is in grabbing
rebounds and hurling bodies. Maybe
that's why he starts, plays several un
productive minutes and then gives way
to John Salley. At any rate, if Mahorn
miraculously learned discipline in less
than a week, he could be a real factor
in the series. Realistically, he will cause
most of his problems on the offensive
glass against the smaller Green.
Figure on Salley logging a lot of
minutes against both Green and Wool
ridge. This will be one of the most in
teresting matchups to watch and may
decide the series. Salley slinks to the
offensive glass as few can, and Green is
almost as successful in the same depart
ment because, simply, he works his butt
off. Salley's offensive game is a little more
versatile than Green's, but neither is
asked to score much. Both love to fill
the lane on the break, but not at the
expense of defensive boards. They must
pick and choose when to release with the
utmost prudence.

Things may get even more interesting
when Woolridge enters the game. He is
stronger than Salley, much stronger. Just
look at the man's arms. Though mainly
a shot blocker and rebounder in the
Lakers' scheme, Woolridge has been find
ing ways in the playoffs to get into L.A.'s
offense without being obtrusive.
He can get out in transition, loves to
drive in the half-court set and puts back
misses with authority. And with his
physique, Woolridge has no reason to
back down to anyone. He has found him
self at just the right time and may be
the difference between a "Three-peat"
and a long summer for the Lakers. When
Woolridge and Green briefly played side
by-side against Phoenix to rest James
Worthy, the alignment was quite effective.
Small forward — Mark Aguirre and
Dennis Rodman vs. James Worthy: Just
as Woolridge has assumed the departed
Kurt Rambis' spot in the Laker rotation,
Aguirre has replaced the irrepressible
Adrian Dantley in the Piston scheme.
Dantley carried the Pistons in the half
court set against L.A. in last year's finals.
No one on the Laker roster could touch
his patented fall away. Dantley's awkward
release makes it impossible to defense.


ROBERT PORTNOY
Aguirre uses a quick release to
get his shot off and can be equally
effective. Aguirre's modest beef
poses some problems for Worthy
on the offensive glass in particu
lar, and Aguirre gets up and down
the floor better than Dantley. But
Aguirre will find himself bushed
as he sprints to keep up with will
o'-the-wisp Worthy, and Worthy's
post-up game is as good as any
in the game. Both players will get
their points — whoever contri
butes the most defensively may
be the winner of this classic
matchup.
When Rodman is in the game,
everything is thrown out of kilter.
The 6- foot-4-inch leaper will play
small forward but spend much of
his time hounding Magic Johnson.
There were times in last year's
finals when Rodman appeared to
actually shut down Buck, as
Magic's teammates like to call
him.
Rodman's unique athletic abil
ity allows him to shut down pass

ing lanes that are open to Magic
against almost any guard in the
league. On offense, Rodman will
make Worthy — and any other
Laker forward — do hard time
on the defensive glass. You can't
defense Rodman with a guard be
cause he rebounds so big. He
hauled down 18 in Detroit's game
four win over Chicago.
If Detroit is to win this series,
it may be on second shots, and
Salley and Rodman are the key
elements. The Lakers looked most
frustrated last year when Piston
put-backs were most frequent.
Point guard — Isiah Thomas
vs. Magic Johnson and Michael
Cooper: It's almost unfair to talk
about these two together because
they often don't guard each other
— Magic's height advantage is
around eight inches — but it
would also be an injustice not to
mention the best of friends in the
same breath. No one will forget
the smooches before the games
last year, nor Magic's body block
that sent an ailing Thomas to the
hardwood.
Whether or not they guard each
other, Magic and Isiah will always
be in direct confrontation. Each

and Edwards way out to make rebound
ing difficult for Thompson. By clearing
the paint, Detroit can send crashers John
Salley and Dennis Rodman in full bore.
For the scheme to be successful, Laim

beer must hit his bombs and Edwards'
rainbow turnarounds must fall.
Power forward — Rick Mahorn and
John Salley vs. A.C. Green and Orlando
Woolridge : Mahorn's intrinsic value is
a mystery to me. He is a thug through
and through. No diamond-cutter inside,
Mahorn's only worth is in grabbing
rebounds and hurling bodies. Maybe
that's why he starts, plays several un
productive minutes and then gives way
to John Salley. At any rate, if Mahorn
miraculously learned discipline in less
than a week, he could be a real factor
in the series. Realistically, he will cause
most of his problems on the offensive
glass against the smaller Green.
Figure on Salley logging a lot of
minutes against both Green and Wool
ridge. This will be one of the most in
teresting matchups to watch and may
decide the series. Salley slinks to the
offensive glass as few can, and Green is
almost as successful in the same depart
ment because, simply, he works his butt
off. Salley's offensive game is a little more
versatile than Green's, but neither is
asked to score much. Both love to fill
the lane on the break, but not at the
expense of defensive boards. They must
pick and choose when to release with the
utmost prudence.

Things may get even more interesting
when Woolridge enters the game. He is
stronger than Salley, much stronger. Just
look at the man's arms. Though mainly
a shot blocker and rebounder in the
Lakers' scheme, Woolridge has been find
ing ways in the playoffs to get into L.A.'s
offense without being obtrusive.
He can get out in transition, loves to
drive in the half-court set and puts back
misses with authority. And with his
physique, Woolridge has no reason to
back down to anyone. He has found him
self at just the right time and may be
the difference between a "Three-peat"
and a long summer for the Lakers. When
Woolridge and Green briefly played side
by-side against Phoenix to rest James
Worthy, the alignment was quite effective.
Small forward — Mark Aguirre and
Dennis Rodman vs. James Worthy: Just
as Woolridge has assumed the departed
Kurt Rambis' spot in the Laker rotation,
Aguirre has replaced the irrepressible
Adrian Dantley in the Piston scheme.
Dantley carried the Pistons in the half
court set against L.A. in last year's finals.
No one on the Laker roster could touch
his patented fall away. Dantley's awkward
release makes it impossible to defense.


ROBERT PORTNOY
Aguirre uses a quick release to
get his shot off and can be equally
effective. Aguirre's modest beef
poses some problems for Worthy
on the offensive glass in particu
lar, and Aguirre gets up and down
the floor better than Dantley. But
Aguirre will find himself bushed
as he sprints to keep up with will
o'-the-wisp Worthy, and Worthy's
post-up game is as good as any
in the game. Both players will get
their points — whoever contri
butes the most defensively may
be the winner of this classic
matchup.
When Rodman is in the game,
everything is thrown out of kilter.
The 6- foot-4-inch leaper will play
small forward but spend much of
his time hounding Magic Johnson.
There were times in last year's
finals when Rodman appeared to
actually shut down Buck, as
Magic's teammates like to call
him.
Rodman's unique athletic abil
ity allows him to shut down pass

ing lanes that are open to Magic
against almost any guard in the
league. On offense, Rodman will
make Worthy — and any other
Laker forward — do hard time
on the defensive glass. You can't
defense Rodman with a guard be
cause he rebounds so big. He
hauled down 18 in Detroit's game
four win over Chicago.
If Detroit is to win this series,
it may be on second shots, and
Salley and Rodman are the key
elements. The Lakers looked most
frustrated last year when Piston
put-backs were most frequent.
Point guard — Isiah Thomas
vs. Magic Johnson and Michael
Cooper: It's almost unfair to talk
about these two together because
they often don't guard each other
— Magic's height advantage is
around eight inches — but it
would also be an injustice not to
mention the best of friends in the
same breath. No one will forget
the smooches before the games
last year, nor Magic's body block
that sent an ailing Thomas to the
hardwood.
Whether or not they guard each
other, Magic and Isiah will always
be in direct confrontation. Each

prides himself on his ability to
command the flow of a game, and
whenever their teams get in trou
ble, look for them to take over.
Isiah's 40-plus point effort in
game six last year was a perfect
example, and Magic's history of
big-game heroics is headed by his
42-point effort when Jabbar was
hurt to beat the Sixer 3 in 1980,
his rookie year. He looks
rejuvenated with close-shaven
head and new baby face and has
played the first 11 Laker playoff
victories at a frenetic pace.
Cooper will be a defensive test
for Thomas when he relieves
Magic. Cooper was left off the
all-defensive team this season, but
he has turned it up a notch in
the playoffs. "Coop" had a signa
ture, high-flying block of a Jeff
Hornacek breakaway layup in the
final game of the Phoenix series.
He, like many of the Lakers,
seems to have saved something
extra this year just for the
playoffs. Thomas may have trou
ble getting off his jumper against
the taller Cooper, but a few
Thomas dribble-drives could force
Cooper to back off and let him
fire from long range.

Just as Woolridge has assumed the
departed Kurt Rambis' spot in the Laker
rotation, Aguirre has replaced the irre
pressible Adrian Dantley in the Piston
scheme. Aguirre uses a quick release to
get his shot off and can be equally
effective.

Shooting guard — Joe Dumars
and Vinnic Johnson vs. Byron
Scott: Scott is a proven scorer in
the Laker lineup and punished
the Suns with a 30-plus point per
formance in game four against the
Suns. Byron's outside shooting is
streaky but very predictable.
When he's on the move, he's
money in the bank — that in
cludes pull-ups on the break, off
screens in the half-court offense,
and the like. When he's wide open
and has too long to set himself,
forget it. The three-pointer is the
only shot he does better with extra
time. Also, you'll never see a Scott
drive end with a pull-up. He's

going to the hoop, period.
Dumars will not have as great
a visible impact as Scott, but his
role is just as crucial. Dumars is
the one who takes the pressure
off Thomas. Isiah carries the huge
burden of bringing the ball up,
running the break, running the
offense and providing backcourt
scoring. Dumars has to help in
one of those areas, and scoring is
where he can help most.
Dumars is a solid outside
shooter and won't be threatened
on defense by Scott, who is rarely
more than adequate in that de
partment. If the outside shot falls,
Scott won't be able to lay off, and

then both Piston guards can pen
etrate. Dumars gets a few calls
in the set offense, but most of the
plays for the off-guard are run
when Vinnie Johnson enters the
game.
Johnson, nicknamed the "Mi
crowave," is as savvy as they come
at getting off shots, even when he
gets only a phantom screen.
Johnson can shoot off balance on
the turnaround like few others.
If Scott is a streak shooter, then
Johnson may as well be naked. If
he hits a couple early, feed him.
If not, he may never surface the
entire ballgame. It's amazing that
a veteran player can still be so
hot and cold, but Johnson without
his trademark would be like
McDonald's without the arches.
Also, Johnson occasionally
handles the point duties to spell
Thomas.
What do we make of all this?
The most significant difference is
Woolridge. Early in the year, he
was a non-entity. No more. Like
almost everyone, I picked the Pis
tons to defeat L.A. before the start
of the year. I've changed my mind.
Forget the home-court advantage
— L.A. in six.
Just so you know how certain I am
that the Detroit Pistons will meet
the Los Angeles Lakers for NBA
title, 1 finished this diatribe before the
start of last night's game five of the
Eastern Conference finals.
I figured there would be the annual
rush to analyze the various matchups in
the championship series, and I wanted
to get a jump on the competition.
It's hard to imagine a series that will
provide more excitement than last year's
battle between Detriot and L.A. The Pis
tons, up 3-2 in the series, led by three
with a minute left in game six at the
Forum. A 15-footer by Byron Scott, an
ill-advised Dennis Rodman jumper and
two free throws by The Captain, Kareem
Abdul-Jabbar, kept L.A. from extinction.
Game 7 was a Laker blowout for over
three stanzas, but Detroit still made L.A.
sweat with a truly remarkable fourth
quarter comeback.
This year's war promises to be equally
scintillating. People used to get bored
with the constant Laker-Celtic finals, ar
guing that nothing ever changed.
Well, they were right, to an extent.
While the players didn't change,
there were very subtle differences that
made each series unique. One year it was
Cedric "Cornbread" Maxwell's garbage on

the offensive glass that doomed the
Lakers.
Another, Mitch Kupchak's pounding on
the Celtic big people helped bury the men
in green. Each year a different player
would come to the fore, while the stars
— mainly Magic and Bird — went about
their proverbial business.
The pending Laker-Piston bout can be
seen as an extension of last season's grand
finale. The changes, some more subtle
than others, are quite significant and will
alter the complexion of this series. Here
is a position-by-position rundown of the
coming NBA foray:
Center — Bill Laimbeer and James
Edwards vs. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and
Mychal Thompson : Teams have ex
ploited Kareem on the offensive glass all

season, but Laimbeer's favorite spot, the
top of the key, will prevent him from
taking full advantage, and that's fine with
the Lakers. Edwards, forever known as
a softie in the paint, has had some of
the Eastern Conference rub off on him.
He still would rather shoot a fadeaway
15-footer than bang inside, but he loves
the baseline, and thus will challenge and
beat Kareem for weakside caroms.
Kareem's lateral movement is gone and
he barely gets off his toes when the ball
comes off the iron.
Mychal Thompson, who now sees much
more action than the Franchise — boy
is that nickname a misnomer these days
— provides special problems for both
Laimbeer and Edwards. In three words,
he can run. Both Piston centers will be
hard-pressed to chase a converted power
forward on the break. And Thompson is
quicker than both as well, which means
some sneaky offensive boards at the most
opportune moments.
When he's in the game, Thompson's
performance on the defensive glass is cri
tical. Look for Detroit to pull Laimbeer
and Edwards way out to make rebound
ing difficult for Thompson. By clearing
the paint, Detroit can send crashers John
Salley and Dennis Rodman in full bore.
For the scheme to be successful, Laim

beer must hit his bombs and Edwards'
rainbow turnarounds must fall.
Power forward — Rick Mahorn and
John Salley vs. A.C. Green and Orlando

on defense by Scott, who is rarely
more than adequate in that de
partment. If the outside shot falls,
Scott won't be able to lay off, and

then both Piston guards can pen
etrate. Dumars gets a few calls
in the set offense, but most of the
plays for the off-guard are run
when Vinnie Johnson enters the
game.
Johnson, nicknamed the "Mi
crowave," is as savvy as they come
at getting off shots, even when he
gets only a phantom screen.
Johnson can shoot off balance on
the turnaround like few others.
If Scott is a streak shooter, then
Johnson may as well be naked. If
he hits a couple early, feed him.
If not, he may never surface the
entire ballgame. It's amazing that
a veteran player can still be so
hot and cold, but Johnson without
his trademark would be like
McDonald's without the arches.
Also, Johnson occasionally
handles the point duties to spell
Thomas.
What do we make of all this?
The most significant difference is
Woolridge. Early in the year, he
was a non-entity. No more. Like
almost everyone, I picked the Pis
tons to defeat L.A. before the start
of the year. I've changed my mind.
Forget the home-court advantage
— L.A. in six.
