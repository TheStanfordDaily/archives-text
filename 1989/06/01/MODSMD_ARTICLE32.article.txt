## It'll be Lakers-Pistons II: Championship series matchups 
### 
Just so you know how certain I am
that the Detroit Pistons will meet
the Los Angeles Lakers for NBA
title, 1 finished this diatribe before the
start of last night's game five of the
Eastern Conference finals.
I figured there would be the annual
rush to analyze the various matchups in
the championship series, and I wanted
to get a jump on the competition.
It's hard to imagine a series that will
provide more excitement than last year's
battle between Detriot and L.A. The Pis
tons, up 3-2 in the series, led by three
with a minute left in game six at the
Forum. A 15-footer by Byron Scott, an
ill-advised Dennis Rodman jumper and
two free throws by The Captain, Kareem
Abdul-Jabbar, kept L.A. from extinction.
Game 7 was a Laker blowout for over
three stanzas, but Detroit still made L.A.
sweat with a truly remarkable fourth
quarter comeback.
This year's war promises to be equally
scintillating. People used to get bored
with the constant Laker-Celtic finals, ar
guing that nothing ever changed.
Well, they were right, to an extent.
While the players didn't change,
there were very subtle differences that
made each series unique. One year it was
Cedric "Cornbread" Maxwell's garbage on

the offensive glass that doomed the
Lakers.
Another, Mitch Kupchak's pounding on
the Celtic big people helped bury the men
in green. Each year a different player
would come to the fore, while the stars
— mainly Magic and Bird — went about
their proverbial business.
The pending Laker-Piston bout can be
seen as an extension of last season's grand
finale. The changes, some more subtle
than others, are quite significant and will
alter the complexion of this series. Here
is a position-by-position rundown of the
coming NBA foray:
Center — Bill Laimbeer and James
Edwards vs. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and
Mychal Thompson : Teams have ex
ploited Kareem on the offensive glass all

season, but Laimbeer's favorite spot, the
top of the key, will prevent him from
taking full advantage, and that's fine with
the Lakers. Edwards, forever known as
a softie in the paint, has had some of
the Eastern Conference rub off on him.
He still would rather shoot a fadeaway
15-footer than bang inside, but he loves
the baseline, and thus will challenge and
beat Kareem for weakside caroms.
Kareem's lateral movement is gone and
he barely gets off his toes when the ball
comes off the iron.
Mychal Thompson, who now sees much
more action than the Franchise — boy
is that nickname a misnomer these days
— provides special problems for both
Laimbeer and Edwards. In three words,
he can run. Both Piston centers will be
hard-pressed to chase a converted power
forward on the break. And Thompson is
quicker than both as well, which means
some sneaky offensive boards at the most
opportune moments.
When he's in the game, Thompson's
performance on the defensive glass is cri
tical. Look for Detroit to pull Laimbeer
and Edwards way out to make rebound
ing difficult for Thompson. By clearing
the paint, Detroit can send crashers John
Salley and Dennis Rodman in full bore.
For the scheme to be successful, Laim

beer must hit his bombs and Edwards'
rainbow turnarounds must fall.
Power forward — Rick Mahorn and
John Salley vs. A.C. Green and Orlando
Woolridge : Mahorn's intrinsic value is
a mystery to me. He is a thug through
and through. No diamond-cutter inside,
Mahorn's only worth is in grabbing
rebounds and hurling bodies. Maybe
that's why he starts, plays several un
productive minutes and then gives way
to John Salley. At any rate, if Mahorn
miraculously learned discipline in less
than a week, he could be a real factor
in the series. Realistically, he will cause
most of his problems on the offensive
glass against the smaller Green.
Figure on Salley logging a lot of
minutes against both Green and Wool
ridge. This will be one of the most in
teresting matchups to watch and may
decide the series. Salley slinks to the
offensive glass as few can, and Green is
almost as successful in the same depart
ment because, simply, he works his butt
off. Salley's offensive game is a little more
versatile than Green's, but neither is
asked to score much. Both love to fill
the lane on the break, but not at the
expense of defensive boards. They must
pick and choose when to release with the
utmost prudence.

Things may get even more interesting
when Woolridge enters the game. He is
stronger than Salley, much stronger. Just
look at the man's arms. Though mainly
a shot blocker and rebounder in the
Lakers' scheme, Woolridge has been find
ing ways in the playoffs to get into L.A.'s
offense without being obtrusive.
He can get out in transition, loves to
drive in the half-court set and puts back
misses with authority. And with his
physique, Woolridge has no reason to
back down to anyone. He has found him
self at just the right time and may be
the difference between a "Three-peat"
and a long summer for the Lakers. When
Woolridge and Green briefly played side
by-side against Phoenix to rest James
Worthy, the alignment was quite effective.
Small forward — Mark Aguirre and
Dennis Rodman vs. James Worthy: Just
as Woolridge has assumed the departed
Kurt Rambis' spot in the Laker rotation,
Aguirre has replaced the irrepressible
Adrian Dantley in the Piston scheme.
Dantley carried the Pistons in the half
court set against L.A. in last year's finals.
No one on the Laker roster could touch
his patented fall away. Dantley's awkward
release makes it impossible to defense.
