# Daily sluggers thwarted in IM softball playoffs

Unlike the Los Angeles Lakers
— who are still alive in the NBA
playoffs — The Daily softball
team will be unable to "threepeat"
in 1989.
Despite a dramatic comeback
attempt, The Daily nine, thought
invincible by many, dropped their
first-round C-league intramural
playoff game Tuesday to the Hard
Hats, 14-13.
Things started off with a bang
for the scribes as they opened with
a four-run first inning. All the
fans in Mudville believed glory
was soon to follow.
A second-inning, nine-run rally
by the Hard Hats quickly damp
ened the spirits of The Daily's 150
fans. The Hats swung mighty
bats, and The Daily's defense
proved not to be the Rock of
Gibraltar it had been in years
past.
More shots to the power alleys
by Hat sluggers and Daily fielding
miscues followed. By the top half
of the fifth inning, the gallant
reporters faced a 13-4 deficit,
their dreams of a third consecu
tive championship in jeopardy.
But mighty tradition reared its
head and the scrappers from
Storke struck back with two runs
in the fifth and seven in the sixth
to tie the score. Crucial hits by
Daily seniors Mark "Rogo" Ro

gowsky, Jon "Shifty" Weisman,
Russell "No nickname" Korobkin,
and Bruce "Shark" Sarkisian and
coterminal students "Shoeless"
Mark Lawrence and "Smokin' "
Brendan Healey kept the rally
alive.
That set the stage for senior
Rob Portnoy, who delivered the
big blow of the comeback, a bases
loaded triple that brought the
Daily to within a run of tying the
score and nearly brought the
shell-shocked Hats to their knees.
Senior hurler Chris Crader fol
lowed with a sacrifice fly to drive
in Portnoy and even the score.
But what seemed like destiny
was not to be. Following a con
troversial Daily decision not to
issue an intentional walk with a
Hat runner on second and two
out in the bottom of the sixth,
Crader served up a siAglelo center
that proved to be the margin of
victory for the Hats.
The Daily opened the seventh
with a leadoff single by Rogowsky,
but got no more. When the Hats
second baseman forced a Daily
runner for the final out Editor in
Chief Kathy "Gopher" Lac
henauer burst into tears and
declared her tenure at the helm
of the paper a failure.
The Daily will renew its quest
for an unprecedented third C
league crown next season. The
farm teams are well stocked and
a core of returning veterans prom
ise to keep the '90 squad in con
tention.
