# 'Neon Deion' called up by Yankees

### 
NEW YORK (AP) - "Neon
Deion" Sanders, the brash corner
back chosen fifth in last month's
NFL draft, started in center field
for the New York Yankees last
night after being called up from
Class AA.
Sanders, who was drafted out
of Florida State by the Atlanta
Falcons and is considered a better
prospect in football than in base
ball, could become the subject in
another bidding war between the
sports.
An outfielder, he was hitting
.286 with 17 stolen bases and had
a .380 on-base percentage for
Albany-Colonie of the Eastern
League.
"I felt like I had my mind all
made up," Sanders said. "I was
prepared to leave July 3 for train
ing camp. That was until 1 got
that call last night. Now, I'll have
to look the situation over.
"They said they didn't bring me
up to sit on the bench. I don't
want a look, I want to stay."
Sanders started in center field
for the Yankees against Seattle
and went l-for-4, starting a five
run seventh-inning rally with an
infield single. He also drove in a
runner with a groundout and
threw out a runner at third base
in the Yankees' 9-5 victory.
The callup gave the man also
known as Prime Time" more
negotiating leverage than he al
ready had. Right after the draft,
he said he would seek a $10 mil
lion, six-year contract that would
make him the NFL's highest paid
defensive player ever before he
has played a game.
"This will put a lot of pressure
on the Falcons," he said. "I'm
sure they're sweating now."
