# Boggess weighs in at NCAAs
## 
### Ed Pike Staff writer 
Brain Boggess is not just a
member of the men's team at the
NCAA Track and Field Champi
onship Meet at Brigham Young
— he is the team.
Hoping to to turn around the
bad luck that Stanford has suf
fered this season, Boggess will be
throwing in the shot put trials
tonight in the climax of what has
been a tremendous season for
him. Boggess made a jump of over
two feet in the shot put this year
to 59 feet 8 V2 inches and qualified
for the NCAA meet at the Pacific
10 Conference Championships.
Asst. Coach Scott Chisam at
tributed the low Stanford NCAA
turn-out to the fact that "we had
several people off by a couple
inches or a few milliseconds."
Boggess, a junior, was on the
other side of that line, throwing
his best in the Pac-10 Meet to
qualify for the NCAAs.
He has been helped by another
year of experience and a decision
to concentrate on the spin tech
nique of throwing. "I think I've
matured as a thrower and that's
helped me more than anything,"
Boggess says.
This year is also the first that
he has been freed from a nagging

groin injury. "It has affected my
training before," he says."It had
kept me out of the discus," his
favorite event coming out of high
school."
Boggess was tagged as an ath
lete to watch by the coaching staff
after a strong fall training season.
The first big jump came early in
the year — in fact, the first of
the indoor season.
He hit 58-feet-6 back in Febru
ary, adding nine inches to his per
sonal best. This mark also qual
ified him for the Pac-10 Outdoor
Championships, leaving him free
to set his sights on the next goal
— qualifying for the NCAA Cham
pionship Meet.
Tonight the goal will be quali
fying for the finals on Friday,
which will take a top-12 finish.
Boggess says:"I need to do what
other people do" to be successful.
If he can do that, the focus will
shift to placing in the top eight
to win All-America honors.
Throwing Coach John Powell
would love to see Boggess finish
strong. It would take his mind off
his recent battles with The Ath-

letic Congress. "I'd say that would
make a real good season," he said.
"Just through willpower, deter
mination and hard work he
blasted through at the Pac-lOs,
our biggest meet of the year,"
Powell said.
Many of those same competitors
will be present tonight, as the Pac
-10 will furnish six of the 22 put
ters at the NCAA Meet. Three of
those will be UCLA throwers who
all placed in the top four at the
Pac-10 Meet.
Next year the future looks even
brighter for Boggess, as he may
become a three event specialist.
That would mean improving in
the discus (where he threw 174
feet against California to qualify
for Pac-lOs) as well as taking up
the hammer throw.
As always, he looks solid.
