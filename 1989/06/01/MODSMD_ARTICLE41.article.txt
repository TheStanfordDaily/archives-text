# INTERMISSION THE STANFORD DAILY'S ENTERTAINING WEEKLY
## The 						Lively Arts at Stanford: Going strong after 20 years 
### Mia Manzulli Senior staff writer 
Last year The Lively Arts
brought five actors from the Lon
don stage to the Stanford stage,
but almost didn't send them back
to England.
It seems that the Student Com
mittee designated to transport the
perfomers in two different vehicles
to the airport got a few signals
crossed. One group headed to San
Francisco Airport while the other
drove to San Jose. The actors al
most missed their planes, but the
mistake was realized with iust
enough time to spare.
So goes a day in the life of The
Lively Arts, one of the nation's
premier arts performance
presenters. Although The Lively
Arts offers between 40 and 50
performances a season, a relatively
small staff makes such mishaps a
real possibility. Despite the diffi
culties the group must face, The
Lively Arts at Stanford has made
a lasting mark on the Bay Area
and on the national arts scene.
The Lively Arts celebrates its

20th season, with a line-up of
performances very different from
the original schedule in 1969. The
first Lively Arts series concentrated
predominantly on chamber music,
but that limited schedule has since
expanded to present many inter
nationally renowned groups and
solo artists in a variety of fields.
In addition, The Lively Arts has
emphasized ethnic events in recent
years in response to the cultural
diversity in the Bay Area.
"A real effort is made to hit all
areas," said publicity director Doug
Case. "Dance is hard, because we
can't depend solely on ballet
performances which are too large
and expensive for one- or two-night
engagements." Case said that for
theater performances, "we try to
choose from popular plays, ethnic
productions, more formal pieces
and the new side of theater."
This season, for instance, The
Lively Arts presented "Yellow
Fever," a touring production of a
play by the Pan Asian Repertory
Theater.
The ambitious Lively Arts
schedule is put together years in

advance under the guidance of di
rector Lois Wagner. "We put in a
list now for the following season,"
said Case. "Our programming
committee makes its recommen
dations depending on who's
touring. We get a significant break
in price if we can work into the
tour and do block booking."

In addition, The Lively Arts has
made an effort to present one per
formance in the South Bay every
season. Since the events at Stan
ford pull more of an audience from
the South Bay than from the
North, bookings at the Flint Center
in San Jose are part of a larger
visiblity effort.

wide audience. In fact, community
members make up 70 percent of
the Lively Arts audience. And al
though the 30 percent student rep
resentation is well above the
national average for students at
tending arts performances, The
Lively Arts would like to see a
significant increase in student in
terest.
Some performances appeal to
the Stanford audience more than
others. Sweet Honey and the Rock,
with its activist leanings, attracted
a lot of students as did Iso and
the Bobs. Case said that more
performances were sold out this
year than any prior season. Other
popular events were comic Mark
Russell, jazz great Wynton Mar
salis, and the Nutcracker perform
ances.
Students at Stanford are priv
leged to have an opportunity to
see so many internationally ac
claimed artists. Several chances for
ticket price reductions make The
Lively Arts events affordable: In
the first few weeks of fall quarter
Residential Education offers half
price tickets for most events to all
interested dorms through their res
ident assistants; and rush tickets
are available at the door at a sig
nificant discount.

A very active Lively Arts student
committee is formed each year,
providing opportunities for student
involvement. Every year 15 stu
dents are chosen to help transport
artists, work backstage and
facilitate publicity. The success of
Lively Arts depends on the drive
of this busy committee which
meets every two weeks. Students
interested in participating on next
year's committee should contact
The Lively Arts at 723-2551.
Coming off of this year's suc
cesses, The Lively Arts looks for
ward to an exciting future. The
coming season "fufills a lot of rny
visions for the future," said Case.
"We are presenting 10 more events
than last year. It's the heftiest
season ever endeavored." More
recognizable names, solo recitalists
— all household names — can be
anticipated.
One of the most rewarding
aspects for The Lively Arts
presenters is when a certain event
broadens an audience. The Kronos
String Quartet, which came to
campus for the 1987-88 season,
was an exciting addition to the
schedule. A new wave string quar
tet, the Kronos is a cutting-edge
ensemble. They performed to a
sold-out audience of traditional
chamber music patrons. "The
audience really surprised us," said
Case. "It was so non-traditional
and they loved it!"

chamber music patrons. "The
audience really surprised us," said
Case. "It was so non-traditional
and they loved it!"
Last year The Lively Arts
brought five actors from the Lon
don stage to the Stanford stage,
but almost didn't send them back
to England.
It seems that the Student Com
mittee designated to transport the
perfomers in two different vehicles
to the airport got a few signals
crossed. One group headed to San
Francisco Airport while the other
drove to San Jose. The actors al
most missed their planes, but the
mistake was realized with iust
enough time to spare.
So goes a day in the life of The
Lively Arts, one of the nation's
premier arts performance
presenters. Although The Lively
Arts offers between 40 and 50
performances a season, a relatively
small staff makes such mishaps a
real possibility. Despite the diffi
culties the group must face, The
Lively Arts at Stanford has made
a lasting mark on the Bay Area
and on the national arts scene.
The Lively Arts celebrates its

20th season, with a line-up of
performances very different from
the original schedule in 1969. The
first Lively Arts series concentrated
predominantly on chamber music,
but that limited schedule has since
expanded to present many inter
nationally renowned groups and
solo artists in a variety of fields.
In addition, The Lively Arts has
emphasized ethnic events in recent
years in response to the cultural
diversity in the Bay Area.
"A real effort is made to hit all
areas," said publicity director Doug
Case. "Dance is hard, because we
can't depend solely on ballet
performances which are too large
and expensive for one- or two-night
engagements." Case said that for
theater performances, "we try to
choose from popular plays, ethnic
productions, more formal pieces
and the new side of theater."
This season, for instance, The
Lively Arts presented "Yellow
Fever," a touring production of a
play by the Pan Asian Repertory
Theater.
The ambitious Lively Arts
schedule is put together years in

advance under the guidance of di
rector Lois Wagner. "We put in a
list now for the following season,"
said Case. "Our programming
committee makes its recommen
dations depending on who's
touring. We get a significant break
in price if we can work into the
tour and do block booking."

In addition, The Lively Arts has
made an effort to present one per
formance in the South Bay every
season. Since the events at Stan
ford pull more of an audience from
the South Bay than from the
North, bookings at the Flint Center
in San Jose are part of a larger
visiblity effort.
With such diverse programming,

wide audience. In fact, community
members make up 70 percent of
the Lively Arts audience. And al
though the 30 percent student rep
resentation is well above the
national average for students at
tending arts performances, The
Lively Arts would like to see a
significant increase in student in
terest.
Some performances appeal to
the Stanford audience more than
others. Sweet Honey and the Rock,
with its activist leanings, attracted
a lot of students as did Iso and
the Bobs. Case said that more
performances were sold out this
year than any prior season. Other
popular events were comic Mark
Russell, jazz great Wynton Mar
salis, and the Nutcracker perform
ances.
Students at Stanford are priv
leged to have an opportunity to
see so many internationally ac
claimed artists. Several chances for
ticket price reductions make The
Lively Arts events affordable: In
the first few weeks of fall quarter
Residential Education offers half
price tickets for most events to all
interested dorms through their res
ident assistants; and rush tickets
are available at the door at a sig
nificant discount.

A very active Lively Arts student
committee is formed each year,
providing opportunities for student
involvement. Every year 15 stu
dents are chosen to help transport
artists, work backstage and
facilitate publicity. The success of
Lively Arts depends on the drive
of this busy committee which
meets every two weeks. Students
interested in participating on next
year's committee should contact
The Lively Arts at 723-2551.
Coming off of this year's suc
cesses, The Lively Arts looks for
ward to an exciting future. The
coming season "fufills a lot of rny
visions for the future," said Case.
"We are presenting 10 more events
than last year. It's the heftiest
season ever endeavored." More
recognizable names, solo recitalists
— all household names — can be
anticipated.
One of the most rewarding
aspects for The Lively Arts
presenters is when a certain event
broadens an audience. The Kronos
String Quartet, which came to
campus for the 1987-88 season,
was an exciting addition to the
schedule. A new wave string quar
tet, the Kronos is a cutting-edge
ensemble. They performed to a
sold-out audience of traditional
chamber music patrons. "The
audience really surprised us," said
Case. "It was so non-traditional
and they loved it!"
