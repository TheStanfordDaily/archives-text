# INTERMISSION THE STANFORD DAILY'S ENTERTAINING WEEKLY
## The
						Lively Arts at Stanford: Going strong after 20 years 
### Mia Manzulli Senior staff writer 
Last year The Lively Arts
brought five actors from the Lon
don stage to the Stanford stage,
but almost didn't send them back
to England.
It seems that the Student Com
mittee designated to transport the
perfomers in two different vehicles
to the airport got a few signals
crossed. One group headed to San
Francisco Airport while the other
drove to San Jose. The actors al
most missed their planes, but the
mistake was realized with iust
enough time to spare.
So goes a day in the life of The
Lively Arts, one of the nation's
premier arts performance
presenters. Although The Lively
Arts offers between 40 and 50
performances a season, a relatively
small staff makes such mishaps a
real possibility. Despite the diffi
culties the group must face, The
Lively Arts at Stanford has made
a lasting mark on the Bay Area
and on the national arts scene.
The Lively Arts celebrates its

20th season, with a line-up of
performances very different from
the original schedule in 1969. The
first Lively Arts series concentrated
predominantly on chamber music,
but that limited schedule has since
expanded to present many inter
nationally renowned groups and
solo artists in a variety of fields.
In addition, The Lively Arts has
emphasized ethnic events in recent
years in response to the cultural
diversity in the Bay Area.
"A real effort is made to hit all
areas," said publicity director Doug
Case. "Dance is hard, because we
can't depend solely on ballet
performances which are too large
and expensive for one- or two-night
engagements." Case said that for
theater performances, "we try to
choose from popular plays, ethnic
productions, more formal pieces
and the new side of theater."
This season, for instance, The
Lively Arts presented "Yellow
Fever," a touring production of a
play by the Pan Asian Repertory
Theater.
The ambitious Lively Arts
schedule is put together years in

advance under the guidance of di
rector Lois Wagner. "We put in a
list now for the following season,"
said Case. "Our programming
committee makes its recommen
dations depending on who's
touring. We get a significant break
in price if we can work into the
tour and do block booking."

In addition, The Lively Arts has
made an effort to present one per
formance in the South Bay every
season. Since the events at Stan
ford pull more of an audience from
the South Bay than from the
North, bookings at the Flint Center
in San Jose are part of a larger
visiblity effort.
With such diverse programming,
The Lively Arts tries to attract a


Violinist itzhak Periman headlines the 1989-90 Lively Arts at Stanford schedule, which will be officially
announced today. The complete schedule is listed on page 2.
