From time to time The Daily sets letters
from my "fans." Last ye«r I got letters toi
"Bug Me"; this year I got letters for "Tips
on Adulthood." Since tlus is my last
column of the year, I thought 1 should
print excerpts from a few of the most
favorable letters. As always, the usual ca
veat: I am not making any of these up.
To start with, one reader was just simply
impressed with the breadth of knowledge
my column covered:
Dear Editor.
Andrew Berkowitz's column is shocking
for its complete lack of sensitivity and its
trivialization of important political and
social issues.
— 8.F.. sophomore
OK, I admit it, I missed out on some
of the important economic issues. But
c'mon, what do you think I am, an in
vestigative journalist?
Dear Andrew Berkowitz.
>four article had some of the facts correct
and was a nifty piece of investigative jour
nalism . . but your presentation bordered
on being defensive and heavy handed.
- 8.K., senior

Actually, 8.K., heavy-handed requires a
hyphen, but who's keeping track? And
while we're talking about body parts, I
should mention that I am a short person.
For some reason, most people who look
at the picture for my column think that
1 am really, really tall. My girlfriend's
roommate thought I was 8-foot-tf until
she met me. Sorry to disappoint y'all, but
I'm 5-4 with my clothes on.
My favorite group to poke fun at is
sororities. Of all the groups on campus,
they are the quickest to recognize that my
column is all one big joke:
Dear Editor.
Don't get me wrong here — 1 appreciate
(Berkowitz's) "insightful" observations as
much as he seems to appreciate sororities.
But he seems to have forgotten the first
rule of journalism: just the facts.
As a reporter he should know how to
get them.
— M.S., senior
REPORTER?!? Give me a break. I'm
about as much of a reporter as Superman.
You ever notice that Clark Kent works
for the Daily Globe, but he never does
anything but stand around and look dopey.
Don't the editors at the Daily Globe ever

get just a teeny bit suspicious? just once
I'd like to see him go out on an assignment
and write a news story. I mean, the guy's
got powers from beyond this galaxy, 1 bet
he could find out if Elvis were still alive
And speaking of beyond this galaxy:
Dear Editor,
Berkowitz thinks nothing of writing his
"Tips on Adulthood" article solely for het
erosexual or bisexual men. This implies
either that women (as well a s gov men)
are not adults, or that they are peripheral
to the student body, and the article was
written for "people who count" {i.e. het
erosexual or bisexual men).
— R.S.. sophomore
But at least it didn't make you mad:
Dear Andrew Berkowitz,
Your approach to this subject, your tone,
your style, the very publication of the
article, made me very upset and extremely
embarassed for you.
At the moment 1 am too upset and
angry to point out to you just where you
are so offensive. I am enclosing your ar
ticle. though, and I have underlined those
sentences I thought were particularly cal
lous.

I hope you will read through your articlc
one more time and think very carefully
about what you have written. Pause at
each sentence and think hard.
— M.W., junioi
So, you're saying, you didn't find my
column funny?
Dear Editor,
If Berkowitz is going to use h/s column
to attack idealism, he doesn't deserve a
soapbox to stand on. He certainly is in
no position to hand down "Tins on Adult

hood His article has just one thing to
offer Tips on Cheap Bigotry — and no
one wants it.
— 8.H., junior
And so comes to an end another year
of columns Thanks to everyone, including
the above letter writers, for your input.
As with last year, this has been loads of
fun.
Most of all I would like to thank you,
the reader. As a writer, my goal is to be
read, and 1 truly appreciate your taking
the time to read my column. It means a
lot to me.
Dear Editor,
1 am writing to say thank you for
Andrew Berkowitz's columns Last year's
Bug Me and this year's Tips on Adulthood
have consistently been the best part of
The Daily.
R.M., Master's student
P.S. 1 know this is not profound or
controversial or anything, so you don't
have to print it. 1 iust wanted to show
my appreciation.
Andrew Berkowitz will return to The Daily
next year.

But he seems to have forgotten the first
rule of journalism: just the facts.
As a reporter he should know how to
get them.
— M.S., senior
REPORTER?!? Give me a break. I'm
about as much of a reporter as Superman.
You ever notice that Clark Kent works
for the Daily Globe, but he never does
anything but stand around and look dopey.
Don't the editors at the Daily Globe ever

get just a teeny bit suspicious? just once
I'd like to see him go out on an assignment
and write a news story. I mean, the guy's
got powers from beyond this galaxy, 1 bet
he could find out if Elvis were still alive
And speaking of beyond this galaxy:
Dear Editor,
Berkowitz thinks nothing of writing his
"Tips on Adulthood" article solely for het
erosexual or bisexual men. This implies
either that women (as well a s gov men)
are not adults, or that they are peripheral
to the student body, and the article was
written for "people who count" {i.e. het
erosexual or bisexual men).
— R.S.. sophomore
But at least it didn't make you mad:
Dear Andrew Berkowitz,
Your approach to this subject, your tone,
your style, the very publication of the
article, made me very upset and extremely
embarassed for you.
At the moment 1 am too upset and
angry to point out to you just where you
are so offensive. I am enclosing your ar
ticle. though, and I have underlined those
sentences I thought were particularly cal
lous.

I hope you will read through your articlc
one more time and think very carefully
about what you have written. Pause at
each sentence and think hard.
— M.W., junioi
So, you're saying, you didn't find my
column funny?
Dear Editor,
If Berkowitz is going to use h/s column
to attack idealism, he doesn't deserve a
soapbox to stand on. He certainly is in
no position to hand down "Tins on Adult

hood His article has just one thing to
offer Tips on Cheap Bigotry — and no
one wants it.
— 8.H., junior
And so comes to an end another year
of columns Thanks to everyone, including
the above letter writers, for your input.
As with last year, this has been loads of
fun.
Most of all I would like to thank you,
the reader. As a writer, my goal is to be
read, and 1 truly appreciate your taking
the time to read my column. It means a
lot to me.
Dear Editor,
1 am writing to say thank you for
Andrew Berkowitz's columns Last year's
Bug Me and this year's Tips on Adulthood
have consistently been the best part of
The Daily.
R.M., Master's student
P.S. 1 know this is not profound or
controversial or anything, so you don't
have to print it. 1 iust wanted to show
my appreciation.
Andrew Berkowitz will return to The Daily
next year.


Tip* on Adulthood
Andrew Berkowitz
From time to time The Daily sets letters
from my "fans." Last ye«r I got letters toi
"Bug Me"; this year I got letters for "Tips
on Adulthood." Since tlus is my last
column of the year, I thought 1 should
print excerpts from a few of the most
favorable letters. As always, the usual ca
veat: I am not making any of these up.
To start with, one reader was just simply
impressed with the breadth of knowledge
my column covered:
Dear Editor.
Andrew Berkowitz's column is shocking
for its complete lack of sensitivity and its
trivialization of important political and
social issues.
— 8.F.. sophomore
OK, I admit it, I missed out on some
of the important economic issues. But
c'mon, what do you think I am, an in
vestigative journalist?
Dear Andrew Berkowitz.
>four article had some of the facts correct
and was a nifty piece of investigative jour
nalism . . but your presentation bordered
on being defensive and heavy handed.
- 8.K., senior

Actually, 8.K., heavy-handed requires a
hyphen, but who's keeping track? And
while we're talking about body parts, I
should mention that I am a short person.
For some reason, most people who look
at the picture for my column think that
1 am really, really tall. My girlfriend's
roommate thought I was 8-foot-tf until
she met me. Sorry to disappoint y'all, but
I'm 5-4 with my clothes on.
My favorite group to poke fun at is
sororities. Of all the groups on campus,
they are the quickest to recognize that my
column is all one big joke:
Dear Editor.
Don't get me wrong here — 1 appreciate
(Berkowitz's) "insightful" observations as
much as he seems to appreciate sororities.
But he seems to have forgotten the first
rule of journalism: just the facts.
As a reporter he should know how to
get them.
