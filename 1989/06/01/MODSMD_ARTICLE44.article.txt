# Introducing The Lively Arts at Stanford 1989-90 season schedule
## 
### Mia Manzulli Senior staff writer 
The Lively Arts at Stanford will
announce its 1989-90 season
today, celebrating the series' 20th
year as a major Bay Area presenter
of performing arts events. Fifty-five
performances of 46 different events
will come to the Stanford, a
schedule which promises to
surpass all previous seasons in its
diversity and quality.
Director Lois Wagner has
brought in many premiers includ
ing a very exciting Bay Area ex
clusive — Itzhak Perlman in
concert. Normally San Francisco
would get such an exclusive, but
Wagner worked hard to bring
Perlman to Stanford.
Another coup for Stanford is the
appearance of Take 6. This black
a capella group recently won two
Grammy awards for its wonderful
inspirational/jazz singing. The
group, which is currently touring
with A 1 Jarreau, will be a big draw
for Stanford students.
The Theater Series, sponsored
by Apple Computer, Inc., is high
lighted by Hal Holbrook's Tony
Award-winning "Mark Twain
Tonight!" and three performances
by Actors From the London Stage.
Events of cross-cultural interest in
clude Masters of the Folk Violin,
and Kodo, taiko drummers from
Japan's Sado Island.
These performances, and all the
rest, promise to make The Lively
Arts' 20th Anniversary year a
season to remember. Publicity di
rector Doug Case says that this
season "is a feather in our cap.
The Lively Arts is Stanford's and
we are doing our best to uphold
the Stanford name."
