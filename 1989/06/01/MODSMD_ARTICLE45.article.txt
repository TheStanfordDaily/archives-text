# A few of the liveliest arts...

Among the performers scheduled for the 1989-90 Lively Arts at Stanford season are Take 6 (facing page), a Grammy
winning a capella singing group; Hal Holbrook in "Mark Twain Tonight!" (left), a Tony-winning one-man show that
characterizes Mark Twain better than any other attempt; the Kronos Quartet (center), a quirky quartet that introduces
a style of music that is new â€” and something you either love or hate; and the Sydney Dance Company (right), an
innovative, and sometimes weird Australian dance troupe. These performers and many more highlight the coming season.
