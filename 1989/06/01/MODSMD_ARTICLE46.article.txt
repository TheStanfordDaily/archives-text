# A 						yummy taste of French 'Chocolat'
## 
### Evan Tuchinsky Senior staff writer 
All the telltale signs for a bad
movie were present: subtitles but
no plot, an exotic locale with un
recognizable context, a well
developed cast of unsympathetic
characters.
Yet, somehow, director/writer
Claire Dolan juxtaposes them all
to create "Chocolat," one of the
more intriguing pictures to grace
the silver screen this year. Explor
ing the racial tensions in colonial
Cameroon, "Chocolat" presents an
unbiased pictoral collage of
Dolan's childhood home, Africa.
"Chocolat" is basically a film
about not belonging. Every char
acter in the film seems out of place:
The Europeans don't fit into the
African nation they have settled,
and the Africans do not belong in
the restrictive, alien society that
the French have established.
This awkward coexistence of
cultures pervades "Chocolat" from
the opening frames until the con
clusion, providing a thread of con
tinuity which tightly stiches an
otherwise-fragmented film.
The picture opens with a young
European woman, aptly named
France, traveling alone through
Cameroon. A black man with his
young son, driving down the same
deserted tropical road she
traverses, stops his car and offers
the hesitant France a ride, a jour
ney which quickly fades into an

extended glimpse of the woman's
childhood.
End of plot, beginning of story.
Until the final few minutes, Dolan
guides the audience through the
sometimes placid, often tumultous
life of a French foreign service fam
ily in the waning era of the French
Empire.
The experience is akin to sitting
in a raft adrift in a steadily flowing,
wide river. The sights are mag
nificent and eye-catching, but the
tide provides no chance to slow
the trip and savor any particular
view.
Fortunately, Dolan is a capable
navigator. Using the 6-year-old
France as a focal point, Dolan un
covers the growing resentment be
tween the black servants and their
white employers with alacrity.
At the outset of the flashback,
all is calm in France's household.
Her father, District Officer Marc
Dalens, leaves on one of his fre
quent journeys, leaving France and
her mother Aimde in the custody
of the family's servant Prot6e.
But the apparent Utopia soon
cracks, then crumbles, then col
lapses. idiosyncracies be
come neuroses, inciting conflict
with all of the household staff and
enlarging the gap between settler
and native.
A series of unexpected visitors
only makes the situation more un
tenable. As the scenes flow by, it
becomes only too obvious that
Prot6e and the other blacks do not

fit into the transplanted culture.
The message is serious, and so
is the film. Enjoyable moments
abound, ranging from witty
dialogue to amusing images, but
the overriding emotion "Chocolat"
conveys is uneasiness.
What makes the film especially
interesting is that none of the char
acters truly command sympathy.
The young France is the film's
protagonist, but even she seems
affected by her privileged status.
As for Prot6e, he remains too
enigmatic to identify with.
Whether he should be pitied, ap
plauded or scorned is never defined
by Dolan, leaving his role open for
individual interpretation.
Shot entirely in the town of Min
dif in northern Cameroon,
"Chocolat" is aesthetically beauti
ful, blending National Geographic
like portraits with the montages.
The lighting is often overstated,
and the emphasis on earth tones
in the costumes and settings en
hances the subdued tone of the
flashback.
"Chocolat" is hardly novel or
earth-shattering, but is definitely
excellent. Sensitively exploring a
fiery era, the film allows the au
dience to draw its own conclusion
without laying blame on the indi
viduals involved. Undoubtedly,
"Chocolat" is worthy of its ac
claim.

"Chocolat" opens tomorrow at the
Aquarius Theater in Palo Alto.

Whether he should be pitied, ap
plauded or scorned is never defined
by Dolan, leaving his role open for
individual interpretation.
Shot entirely in the town of Min
dif in northern Cameroon,
"Chocolat" is aesthetically beauti
ful, blending National Geographic
like portraits with the montages.
The lighting is often overstated,
and the emphasis on earth tones
in the costumes and settings en
hances the subdued tone of the
flashback.
"Chocolat" is hardly novel or
earth-shattering, but is definitely
excellent. Sensitively exploring a
fiery era, the film allows the au
dience to draw its own conclusion
without laying blame on the indi
viduals involved. Undoubtedly,
"Chocolat" is worthy of its ac
claim.

"Chocolat" opens tomorrow at the
Aquarius Theater in Palo Alto.
