## Ramones back from the grave 
### Bill Fagelson Staff writer 
In the 15 years of their existence,
the Ramones have held on to their
original style, names and clothes.
Granted, they've gone through
several drummers, but that's rock
and roll.
The newest offering from the
Ramones, "Brain Drain," follows
in this tradition by giving us more
of the same; I'm not complaining.
The Ramones are still the same
rock and roll cartoon they were
when they started, pumping out
solid music that doesn't take itself
too seriously.
Songs like "Zero Zero UFO" and
"Learn To Listen" draw on the loud
and fast playing style that inspired
the punk revolution. Dee Dec,
Marky and Johnny provide a grind
ing beat that sounds like it could
even be heavy metal. They aren't
playing crap, though. Unlike many
of their punk followers, the
Ramones can actually play their
instruments.
And Joey can actually sing. Al
though many Ramones songs don't
rely on more than deep talking,
others showcase Joey's able voice
box. "All Screwed Up," "Can't Get
You Out Of My Mind" and "Come
Back, Baby" let Joey do what he
does best. His singing has such an

urgent whining quality to it that
it might even be called crooning,
It's not surprising that he had a
hand in the writing of these three
songs.
Another song written by Joey
that utilizes his sinking is "Merry
Christmas (I Don't Want To Fight
Tonight)," definitely the funniest
track on the album. After hearing
a song like this, it's clear that they
have lived up to the cartoon image
that was pinned on them at the
very beginning.
"Pet Sematary," a song that was
used for the movie but not put on
the soundtrack, makes its appear
ance here. Stephen King showed
again that he is able to pick music
to fit the mood of his films. He
used AC/EXT for "Maximum Over
drive," creating an ample setting
for the onslaught of living trucks.
The Ramones were an obvious
choice for "Pet Sematary" since it
was clearly a movie that was not
completely serious.
The songs that remain are all
solid pieces, including a speeded
up version of "Palisades Park." I
have no idea where they came up
with this one, but it sounds pretty
good.
I have seen them twice in con
cert, and you can be sure that in
their current tour they will be play
ing their music twice as fast and

20 times as loud. Ramones con
certs consist of deafening noise,
violence and four ugly guys up on
stage â€” some definitely bad crazi
ness. I was nearly killed when I
saw them, and it imbued a deep
respect in me for their showman
ship
The scene at these concerts is
a lot like that at a punk rock con
cert. It's kind of ironic that they
are lumped in with talentless
bands because the Ramones have
always relied on rock as a base;
they even took their name from a
Paul McCartney pseudonym. This
wasn't Malcom McClaren throw
ing four schmucks together, teach
ing them three chords and calling
them a band.
Unfortunately, the Ramones
have gone the way of a few great
bands (the Kinks, for example) who
are loved by so many people, but
never achieve the status deserved
of them. They approachcd it with
the release of "Ramones Mania,"
but the fact that most people prob
ably didn't know they had a new
album out is a good sign that they
haven't hit the top.
The Ramones just keep moving
along, though. Their music is bas
ically the same style, but they have
managed to stay on that narrow
path between burning out and
fading away.
