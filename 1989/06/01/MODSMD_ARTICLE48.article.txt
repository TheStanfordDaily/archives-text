# Dust off the negative superlatives Alphaville's just released a new album
## 
### Matthew Marx Staff writer 
Aaaaarrrrrggggghhhhh!!!!
Whew. Sorry about that — just
had to let off a little steam after
agonizing through what is pos
sibly the worst album I've ever
heard: Alphaville's "The Breath
taking Blue."
It seems to me that if you're
nothing more than a pop music
band destined never to be any
thing more than a pop music
band, you might as well admit
it. That's why I don't mind early
'80s Duran Duran as well as
Debbie Gibson (OK, there are
other reasons on the latter).
That's what annoys me to no
end about Alphaville. You'd fig
ure that alter a couple oi i>rup,
crackle and pop hits like "Forever
Young" ana "Big in Japan" the
band would settle for what it
does best: over-orchestrated, hy
perdramatic, intensely rhythmic,
quick ballads which work,
thanks to lead singer's Marian
Gold's magnificent vocals. Who
cared that "Forever Young" rode
a sixth-grade reading level and

strived for Madonnalike melodic
complexity? It was a good song.
But Alphaville seems to have
lost that ability; their new music
is pretentious, effortless drivel
which (to quote Pink Floyd's The
Wall) "leaves me with the urge
to defacate."
"The Breathtaking Blue" vacil
lates between annoying and in
sufferable. The kickoff track,
"Summer Rain," run* a es
chatological lyric line around a
plodding infantry of synthesized
drum beats. "Ariann " though it
carries a cute (almost too cute)
melody, falls flat. Claiming to
be some social commen
tary, thejsong offers oh-so
profound insights into the appeal
of SfiX (now I've got your atten
tion) in today's society: "We're
goin' nutz for Ariana / We're
goin' car-razy for her / Everything
glows, wherever she goes / She
got sex from her lips to her toes."
Yawn.
But it gets worse. The in
strumental "Patricia's Park" is
just about as close to elevator
music as you're going to get.
And, finally, "Anyway" sounds

like — and I'm not kidding on
this one — an attempt to recreate
Frank Sinatra ballads for the turn
of the decade.
Perhaps the problem is just the
band itself: While Marian Gold
has a normal enough assignment
on "vocals," Bernhard Lloyd as
sumes the dubious task of han
dling the "Machines" and
Echolette (no last name) gets
his/her (I can't tell) jollies from
playing the "Instruments." No
kidding — I'm quoting from the
album jacket.
I guess I'm most annoyed by
the egregious waste of Gold's
magnificent voice. Or maybe I
just have a bias against men who
sing at higher pitches than dog
whistles can produce. Still, he
did do some wonderful work on
"Forever Young" et al. What
went wrong?
In one song Alphaville exhorts
us to explore the "Mysteries of
Love." Maybe they should inves
tigate the Realities of Rotten
Music instead. Here's to an early
breakup for this underachieving
trio.
