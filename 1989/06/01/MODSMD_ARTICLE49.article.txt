# Unusual Cyndi Lauper still not like R.E.M.
## 
### Andrew Berkowitz Editorial staff 
Before we proceed with this review of the
new Cyndi Lauper album there are a couplc
things you should know up front.
First of all, I've never written a music review.
I mean, I've read a lot of reviews, but this
here represents my first time so I'm kinda
nervous. But hey, we're all friends here, so if
you'll bear with me we'll just sort of wing it
from here on in.
Second of all, I think music reviews are really
stupid. Every music review always contains the
following completely irrelevant pieces of infor
mation:
• A long description of the neo-radical, po
litical organizations that the performer thanks
on the album liner notes, in the lyrics of the
songs and during charity concerts with names
such as "Live Aid" or "Artists for Amnesty"
or "Singers United Againsts Those Little Sub
cription Cards That Fall Out Of Magazines
When You Pick Them (the magazines) Up."
• A complete analysis of every song on every
album ever released by the performer, just in
case the reader wasn't paying attention.
• A serious, heartfelt discussion of the lyrics
of the music.
This last point irks me the most. Who in
the world chooses their favorite music because
of the lyrics? Yeah, I know all you Tracy Chap
man fans are moved by the deep messages in
her "songs," but I should point out that Tracy
Chapman is actually just a poet who somehow
got her mitts on a guitar. Our lawmakers oughta
ban acoustic guitars along with semiautomatic

assault rifles while they're at it.
But I digress.
Anyway, when people want to know if a
new album is any good they aren't asking about
the lyrics. Walt Whitman isn't exactly quivering
in his grave faced with "Don't Worry, Be Hap
py."
But returning to the topic at hand, I am
listening to the Cyndi Lauper album right now
as I write this, which could very well be an
indication that I like the album, but more
likely an indication that you should not leave
me alone with your children.
OK, I admit it, I like Cyndi Lauper. Back in
10th grade I was your basic nerd who thought
"Mandy," by Barry Manilow, was about the
hippest thing on the planet. Then I discovered
girls, and realized that it would behoove me
to get "with it." ("With it" people don't or
dinarily use the word "behoove," but I'm
making an exception here.)
So I started listening to pop music, and
Cyndi Lauper was my first favorite artist. This
was a period in musical history when Nena's
"99 Luftbaloons" was competing with Frankie
Goes To Hollywood's "Relax" for the top spots
on the charts — can you blame me for turning
to Cyndi Lauper?
So Cyndi Lauper has bounced back with her
new album, which is titled "A Night To Re
member." It has 10 songs plus a strange psuedo-
Indian, chantcd poetic song thingymabob at
the beginning and end of the album. Cyndi L.
always seems to have one of these weird thingys
on her albums, which conclusively demon
strates her Vision As An Artist. Or else she's
lust weird.

As on her first two albums — "She's So
Unusual" (1984) and "She's Really, Really
Quite Unusual" (1986) — Lauper shows off
her nifty vocal range and talents. 1 know some
people complain that she sounds like Betty
Boop, but hey, Tracy Chapman sounds like
Mr. Goodwrench and nobody ever mentions
that.
Unfortunately, the melodies on "A Night To
Remember" are weakest where Lauper does the
writing. The best songs on her first album were
written by established songwriters — Jules
Shear's "Time After Time," for example — and
such diverse writers as Marvin Gaye and Prince
contributed material to the first two albums.
None of the songs are bad on this album, but
then again there aren't any blockbusters like
on the first two albums.
A mixed bag this time around, but all in all
I like the album. Let's face it, if you're not a
Cyndi Lauper fan you aren't going to buy it,
and if you are a Cyndi Lauper fan you already
own the album. The album cover is too silly
looking to cause anyone to buy a copy in a
spasm of impulse, and the fact that Eric Clap
ton plays guitar on most of the songs isn't
going to tip the scales in Cyndi's favor.
Finally, in keeping with our tradition here
at The Daily, I will end this review by placing
the album in one of the following two all
encompassing musical categories:
Category 1: Albums that sound like R.E.M.
(10,000 Maniacs, Indigo Girls, anything else
reviewed in The Daily)
Category 2: Albums that don't sound like
R.E.M. (Cyndi Lauper, Mozart, R.E.M.)
