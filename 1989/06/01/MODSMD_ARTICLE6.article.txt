# Students may soon need a C- to pass

Students taking their classes on
a Pass/No Credit basis will have
to buckle down and work a little
harder if the Faculty Senate ap
proves a new proposal about the
grading option in its meeting
today.
. Long popular among students
experimenting with difficult
courses, the pass/no credit option
may lose some of its attraction
with the new proposal, which
raises the "minimal pass" grade
to a C-. Under the present system,

established in 1973, students
taking courses pass/no credit
must perform at the D- level or
above to receive a passing grade.
There are currently two forms
of pass/no credit grading: student
elected, which happens in courses
that allow the letter grade option
also, and instructor-elected, which
occurs in courses where no per
manent letter grades are given.
A passing grade in a student
elected course is recorded by a
" + " on the student's transcript,
while instructor-elected passes
are represented by a P. The new

proposal would retain the "+"
but change the P to an S for
"satisfactory" to indicate that the
student had no choice in the
grading option.
The proposed change is
motivated primarily by doubts
about whether a D- performance
deserves a passing grade.
"It does not constitute a signif
icant exploration of a subject to
get a D in it," said German Prof.
Orrin Robinson, chair of the Com
mittee on Academic Appraisal and
Achievement, the senate commit
tee making the proposal.
Another issue raised in the pro
posal is a perceived misuse of the
pass/no credit option. Although
the option is intended to allow
students to experiment with
courses outside their msyors, stu
dents frequently use it for courses
within their majors, Robinson
said. Presently, the only restric
tions on use of the pass/no credit
option within a mtyor are those

enacted by individual depart
ments.
Finally, Robinson said there
was "confusion among the facul
ty" about the pass/no credit sys
tem. In a faculty survey conducted
by the committee, nearly half of
all respondents indicated they al
ready believe C to be the mini
mum passing grade.
Angela Kim, a student member
of the committee, said she is not
sure how the student body will
react, but she is confident of the
proposal's merit. "I think it's
going to work out for everybody's
benefit," she said. "It's a good
compromise."
