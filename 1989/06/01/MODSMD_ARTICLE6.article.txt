# Students may soon need a C- to pass

Students taking their classes on
a Pass/No Credit basis will have
to buckle down and work a little
harder if the Faculty Senate ap
proves a new proposal about the
grading option in its meeting
today.
. Long popular among students
experimenting with difficult
courses, the pass/no credit option
may lose some of its attraction
with the new proposal, which
raises the "minimal pass" grade
to a C-. Under the present system,

established in 1973, students
taking courses pass/no credit
must perform at the D- level or
above to receive a passing grade.
There are currently two forms
of pass/no credit grading: student
elected, which happens in courses
that allow the letter grade option
also, and instructor-elected, which
occurs in courses where no per
manent letter grades are given.
A passing grade in a student
elected course is recorded by a
" + " on the student's transcript,
while instructor-elected passes
are represented by a P. The new

proposal would retain the "+"
but change the P to an S for
"satisfactory" to indicate that the
student had no choice in the
grading option.
The proposed change is
motivated primarily by doubts
about whether a D- performance
deserves a passing grade.
"It does not constitute a signif
icant exploration of a subject to
get a D in it," said German Prof.
