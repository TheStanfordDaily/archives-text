# Seniors can now pledge money for new housing
## 
### Jennifer Schmid Staff writer 
It's Commencement time once
again. But before seniors pack up
and head off to new jobs or grad
uate school, Stanford has one
more request.
It's a request that a pair of
seniors hope will contribute to
building a new dorm in the near
future. The Senior Pledge coordi
nators are asking graduates to
earmark their donations for a
fund for new undergraduate
housing, which will become the
Class of '89's Senior Gift.
As in the past several years,
graduating seniors are being
asked to sign a Senior Pledge,
which will commit them to con
tributing time or money or both
to their alma mater.
In the past, the pledge simply
asked seniors to commit to con
tributing a certain amount of
money over a period of four or
five years.
This year, however, seniors are
asked to pledge any combination
of any of the following: a $100
donation to the University to be
payable over a period of five years;
eight hours per year of volunteer
work at Stanford; and a promise
to keep the University informed
of his or her current address.
This final request was added
because in the past, up to one
third of recent graduate addresses
have been incorrect or missing.
According to Senior Pledge
chair David Kim. designating
donations for undergraduate
housing "makes a statement to
large donors that undergraduate
housing is something that stu
dents really want."
Students may not realize that
the way money is spent at any
university is a large reflection of
donors' wishes, so pledging money
would be "a good way to make
some positive changes," he said.
Kim added that seniors can ac
tually earmark donations for any
purpose of their choosing, such as
funds for an ethnic dean or fi
nancial aid.
According to committee adviser
Laurel Theodore, the long-term
Senior Pledge goal is to raise
$50,000 for housing, which will
be matched dollar-for-dollar by

ra a gdl each year totalling at least
JV $100 by our sth Reunion In M.

Anderson.
Although $100,000 is only a
small fraction of the amount
needed to construct new housing,
Theodore said a fund started by
recent Stanford graduates would
still send a signal to other donors
that housing is an important stu
dent concern.
Senior class president Julie
Lythcott said incorporating the
Senior Gift with the Senior Pledge
is a good idea because "donations
are constantly needed (by Stan
ford) . . . and this sets students
up to give in the future."
Since some graduating seniors
may have a lot more time than
money, the opportunity to con
tribute both is an important fea
ture of the updated pledge.
Kim said last year very few
funds were raised through the
Senior Pledge, possibly because
graduating seniors were short on
funds or "they felt insulted that
the University was asking them
for more money" after four years
of tuition bills.
A random sampling of one grad
uating senior reveals that Kim's
suspicion may be well-founded.
When asked what he thought
of the pledge this year, the anon
ymous student replied, "Are you
kidding 9 I'm not going to give
more money after giving $80,000
in tuition!"
