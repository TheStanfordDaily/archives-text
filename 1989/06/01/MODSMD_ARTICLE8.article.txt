# Three different charges
## 
### 
These are the specific charges outlined in three different letters sent to participants in the May
15 takeover of University President Donald Kennedy's office. The copies were released at
yesterday's Agenda for Action press conference. All letters began by stating the Policy on
Campus Disruption, but three different versions of the letter followed. The names were deleted
by the coalition. Other versions of the letter with different charges may have been sent to other
students, but all the letters compiled yesterday fell into one of these three categories.
