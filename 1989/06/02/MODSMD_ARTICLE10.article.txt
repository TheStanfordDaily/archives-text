# Stanford appoints Schaffer as first woman vice president
## 
### Jason Bloomstein Senior staff writer 
Su Schaffer first saw Stanford
in the summer of 1981 when she
attended the Graduate School of
Business' eight-week executive
program as vice president of in
flight services at United Airlines.
"I loved it," she said. "I have
never seen any place like Stan
ford."
Schaffer, 48, will start Monday
as the University's vice president
of administration. She will be the
first woman to ever become vice
president here, just as she was
the first woman to hold such a
post at United.
Her main duty will be to direct
the 1,200 University employees in
most of the non-academic func
tions such as operations and

maintenance, personnel, facilities,
food and housing, and health and
safety.
"This just seems like the per
fect, perfect job," she said. "It
combines my experience in oper
ations and services at United with
my interest to be a part of a well
planned, thoughtful organization
like Stanford."
As for being the first woman
vice president here, Schaffer said
she hopes to be received at Stan
ford "the same way I was at
United."
"I understand that it takes a
long time for some institutions to
change the image of their high
positions, but while I'm here I
hope to be very supportive of
women and minorities," she said.
The post opened last December
when Business and Education

Prof. Bill Massy, then vice presi
dent of finances and administra
tion, wanted to devote more time
to teaching and so the University
created a separate vice presidency
for adminstration. Massy is still
vice president of finances, which
includes overseeing endowments
and investments.
While Massy said the role of
vice presidents in affecting policy
is limited because their role is to
support the president and provost,
he said he is looking forward to
working with Schaffer and feels
confident she will have a strong
impact on the operations manage
ment of the University.
Schaffer said she has no definite
plans for what she will do as vice
president and will spend the first
one or two months studying the
departments she will direct.

"I will come to Stanford with
a pretty open mind," she said.
"I'm going to spend the first few
months developing for myself
some ideas."
University President Donald
Kennedy led the search for the
new vice president, and Massy
said "dozens" of candidates ap
plied. Though he could not cite
specific figures, he said a "signif
icant" number of women applied
and Kennedy made a "special ef
fort to attract minorities," he said.
Schaffer received two degrees
in education, a bachelor's from
the University of Wisconsin and
a master's from Michigan State
University. She worked for United
for 18 years until 1987 and in
September of 1982 became vice
president of the airline's western
region office. In moving from

Chicago to take the California po
sition, Schaffer decided to live in
Menlo Park in order to be close
to Stanford â€” not because she
thought she would work here but
because of her initial attraction
to the campus.
She has also been a partner in
a Sonoma residential design-and
construction firm and has been
president of Women's Forum West,
a Bay Area organization of 100
women who hold high positions in
academia industry. The forum,
the western chapter of the na
tional organization, provides re
sources and professional connec
tions for the members and is in
the process of establishing a fund
to provide leadership opportuni
ties for young women in the Bay
Area.
