## Bush, Thatcher mend fences 
### 
LONDON (AP) â€” President
Bush sought to ease strains with
Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher yesterday and maintain
a special relationship with her
conservative government as he
wrapped up his four-nation Eu
ropean tour.
While Bush mended fences after
a tough session with Thatcher,
Secretary of State James Baker
challenged the Soviet Union to
resond to the latest U.S. proposal
for cutting American and Soviet
troops in Europe to 275,000 on
each side.
Brushing aside a cool reaction
from Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze as only prelimi
nary, Baker said "the ball is in
their court and a response by
them is now clearly called for."
He said Western experts will
meet for three months at NATO
headquarters in Brussels to flesh
out Bush's arms-reduction initia
tives, which include the projected
troop cuts, so they can be formally
presented by the Western alliance
to the Warsaw Pact in Vienna on
Sept. 7.
Bush, who will fly home today,
lunched with Queen Elizabeth II
on duck with honey and brandy
sauce in the chandeliered second
floor Music Room of Buckingham
Palace after meeting with
Thatcher.
"It's only with friends that you
can take off the gloves and talk
from the heart," Bush told
reporters at the conclusion of his
session with the prime minister
at heavily guarded 10 Downing
Street. "And I felt that I was with

a friend today."
As the day wore on, the two
leaders put the emphasis on the
centuries' old ties that bind their
nations.
At a gala dinner at 10 Downing
Street where both Thatcher and
Bush regaled the guests with jokes
and anecdotes, each spoke
seriously of what the Anglo-
American relationship means.
"You always will be able to
count on Britain when there is
danger, when you need us. That's
why the relationship is so special,"
Thatcher told Bush.
He called Thatcher a seasoned
leader and said Americans look to
the prime minister "with great
admiration for all you have done
for Britain and all you have done
for the alliance."
He said that with NATO's new
arms control initiative, "we seek
to free Western Europe from the
shadow of Soviet military power."
The special relationship forged
under former President Reagan
was tested a bit at the NATO
summit meeting this week in
Brussels over how the Western
allies should respond to arms con
trol initiatives by Soviet President
Mikhail Gorbachev.
Led by Bush, the 16 allied
leaders forged a compromise that
blended Thatcher's hard-line
views with the more dovish posi
tion of West German Chancellor
Helmut Kohl.
That problem resolved, Baker
acknowledged at a news confer
ence a continuing U.S.-British dis
agremement over South Asian
"boat people."
