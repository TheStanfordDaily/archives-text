# Gingrich attacks Wright farewell

WASHINGTON (AP) - House
Speaker Jim Wright's chief ac
cuser charged yesterday that
Wright's condemnation of ethics
investigations as "mindless can
nibalism" in his resignation
speech was "an insult to the ethics
committee and every decent per
son in the House."
Rep. Newt Gingrich, the Geor
gia Republican who was elected
GOP whip in large part because
of his attacks on Wright, said he
initially refused to comment after
Wright's resignation speech Wed
nesday because "I was so angry
at the tone of the speech and some
of the things he said."
"I thought the whole thing was
designed to blame the institution
and to blame the press," Gingrich
said of Wright's speech.
Gingrich said there is no
"feeding frenzy" on ethics in the
House, as Wright alleged. Instead,
he said, there is only an effort to
ensure that House standards are
upheld.
"Why is it wrong to insist that
the current rules be enforced
against gross violations?" he said.
"Not against nitpicking, or clerical
error."
He said Wright and Majority
Whip Tony Coelho, D-Calif., who
announced last Friday he was
resigning rather than face an eth
ics probe of his personal finances,
are "the first two guys I know of
to have resigned from high office
for corruption in modern times."
House Democrats filed an eth
ics complaint against Gingrich in
April, alleging that he violated

House rules when a group of
wealthy political supporters
formed a partnership in 1984 to
promote his bode, "Window of Op
portunity."
That complaint is still pending
before the committee, and
Gingrich acknowledged yesterday
that he might be the next target
of a House ethics investigation.
"I'm counting on the same eth
ics committee," he said. "I trust
their judgment to be honest.
They'll have a good measurement
â€” they can take my book case,
and they can compare it to Jim
Wright's book case.
"They're totally different.
Where Jim Wright was the exam
ple of how to do it wrong, I think
we're the example of how to do
it right," he said.
Part of the ethics committee's
case against Wright involved al
legations that he used bulk sales
of his book, "Reflections of a
Public Man," to evade the House
limit on outside income.
Gingrich said he does not be
lieve the investigation of Wright
and the allegations of ethical
wrongdoing by other members
has distracted the House from its
real business.
"If you have a speaker with
enough violations that he has to
resign, I think that's important,"
he said. "Isn't having an honest
House part of the real business
of the House?"
Asked if Republicans are plan
ning to take advantage of Demo
cratic ethics problems for political
ends.
