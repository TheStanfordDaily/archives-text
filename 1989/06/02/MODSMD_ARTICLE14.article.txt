# Chinese troops flex muscle
## Government intensifies war of nerves with protesters 
### 
BEIJING (AP) — More than
1,000 helmeted soldiers jogged
near a city train station today in
the third straight day of muscle
flexing aimed at unnerving pro
democracy protesters holed up in
Tiananmen Square.
The People's Liberation Army
troops came out of the station,
ran through the surrounding
neighborhood and returned to
their camp in the station. But
they did not approach Tiananmen
Square just over a mile away
The square, the symbolic heart
of China, has been occupied by
up to 200,000 students since they
launched their protests more than
six weeks ago. About 10,000 stu
dents are massed there now in
defiance of martial law orders to
leave.
The students, who have gained
considerable support from ordi
nary citizens, are demanding

more democracy, an end to cor
ruption among officials, and a
dialogue with the government.
Instead, the government has en
gaged them in a war of nerves,
and this week's shows of force
indicated that officials are poised
to enforce martial law and put
down the protest movement.
Yesterday, about 300 army
troops marched within a block of
Tiananmen Square. National tele
vision showed hundreds of sol
diers fast-stepping out of the city
railroad station.
The previous day, a large
procession of military motorcycles
roared through the capital.
Beijing citizens, in a show of
support for the students, blocked
troops from entering the city after
the government declared martial
law on May 20.
But residents for the moment

are subdued as the government
wages a propaganda campaign
warns that participants in pro
democracy rallies face pay cuts
and other punishment.
A city spokesman issued a stern
warning yesterday to foreign jour
nalists, saying they were banned
from covering student protests
and that all media coverage in the
capital must receive prior ap
proval by city officials.
Ding Weijun also said foreign
journalists are not allowed to in
vite Chinese citizens to their of
fices, residences or hotels "for in
terviews on activities prohibited"
under martial law.
The Foreign Correspondents
Club of China said the regulations
were a "deplorable case of press
censorship and harassment" and
urged the Beijing government to
rescind the restrictions.
