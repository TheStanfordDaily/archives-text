Soviets question Baltic history
MOSCOW (AP) — In another attack on official
history, two deputies told the Soviet Congress
yesterday the Baltic republics were taken by force
and the approved version that they joined the
Soviet Union voluntarily is a lie.
Other stinging commentary during the session
included an attack on Poliburo member Yegor
Ligachev, who was accused of being incompetent
to run Soviet agriculture and end chronic food
shortages.
Dissident historian Roy Medvedev took the
podium during nationally televised debate and
said the official version of Soviet absorption of
the three Baltic republics in 1940 was not true.
"Up to now, in our history books, we have
said Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania voluntarily
joined the Soviet Union and that it was a popular
revolution, there was no violence and it was a
declaration of free will," he told the deputies.
That, Medvedev said, was "a lie."
Many deputies reacted with noisy anger and
denials. Then President Mikhail Gorbachev

declared his support for an investigation of the
allegations, and the 2,250-member Congress of
People's Deputies assented without a vote.
30 injured in jumbo jet nose-dive
DARWIN, Australia (AP) — A Qantas Airways
jumbo jet with 325 people aboard inexplicably
pitched upward at 30,000 feet yesterday and then
nose-dived, catapulting passengers around the
cabin so hard they left dents. As many as 30
people were injured.
A Qantas official today described the effect as
like a "roller coaster ride" for the 305 passengers
and 20 crew members bound for Singapore. The
plane, a 747-200, left from Sydney and was
diverted to Darwin, far northern Australia.
Fleet Manager Capt. Les Hayward said he did
not know whether air turbulence or a fault in
the autopilot could have caused the malfunction.
He said 61 people were taken to Royal Darwin
Hospital, but more than half of them were rela
tives of the injured.
