Real leadership can
turn year's upheavals
into chance for change

WE'RE WAITING FOR
the phoenix of an im
proved Stanford to rise
out of the ashes of the past year's
fires.
Beginning last spring in Otero,
the University has been forced
to re-examine itself from the in
side. Instances of racism, sexism
and homophobia have consumed
students' lives, scorched admin
istrators' intentions and generally
burned down much of the good
relations between the three.
So we're left with ashes of cer
tain students' disillusionment,
disobedience and outrage. The
administration is discouraged
and dispensing heavy-handed
punishment. The Fundamental
Standard confusion is tossed up
in the air until next fall like a
hot coal. Lots of promises and
accusations glow in the embers.
But out of this could rise an
enduring dialogue between stu
dents and faculty and adminis
tration. A well-defined and mean
ingful code for student conduct
could emerge. And Stanford ed
ucation could fly up above others
who have yet to feel the heat
generated by progressive change.
This will take renewed open
community interaction. It will
mean getting on with the issues
rather than dwelling on the
events of May 15.
The debates, the forums, the
protests, the full-page ads, the
appeals for community involve
ment on the interpretation of the
Fundamental Standard, free

speech and minority life this year
have opened up veins of deep in
tellectual and personal meaning.
This should continue. But
clearer words, priorities and time
tables would make the process
far more fruitful.
University President Donald
Kennedy would best serve his
University now by continuing to
be a visible actor in the drama
of justice and educational reform
at Stanford. He needs to be a
leader, not just a reactor. And as
a leader of students, he needs to
more forcefully represent and lis
ten to them, as well as the faculty
that support them.
As the last flames of this year
lap around campus, particularly
as the strife between the Agenda
for Action and Kennedy contin
ues, it's a good time to see exactly
what's burning.
It's the explosive combination
of desire for change and resis
tance to change, specifically the
desire for multicultural educa
tion at Stanford and opposition
to it. Perhaps some of the oppo
sition has been as invisible as a
gas, but that makes it no less
volatile.
Regrettably, faculty have not
yet imitated students' eagerness
to serve on the Student Conduct
Legislative Council next year.
Kennedy himself could take
some initiative to encourage fac
ulty participation. In the fall he
should maintain his involvement
by corresponding with the council
regularly and perhaps even sit
ting in on one of their meetings
to outline his own stand.
It's time to rebuild. And after
this year's smoke and fire finally
clear, it's a chance to build better
structures than before: ones that
incorporate more voices in Uni
versity decision-making.
