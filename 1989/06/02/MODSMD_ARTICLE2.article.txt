# Selecting electors of new dean
## Chicano community picks students within, outside MEChA 
### Paula Gani Staff writer 
Division between MEChA and
students opposed to or unaffil
iated with the Chicano/Latino or
ganization marked last night's
election of four students to serve
on a selection committee for a
new Chicano community dean.
In the end, however, an un
precedented turnout of more than
200 students elected four students
representing various aspects of
the community.
Sophomore Adan Ramirez,
seniors Gina Hernandez and Jon
Inda, and graduate student
Manuel Arellano were chosen to
serve on a search commitee for a
dean to replace Asst. Dean of Res
idential Affairs and El Centro Chi
cano Director Juan Yniguez, who
announced his resignation May
22.
Also serving on the committee
will be representatives appointed
by the El Centro staff, two mem
bers to be elected by Chicano fac

ulty and two staff members.
Mediated by officials from the
Student Affairs Office, the elec
tion was intended to be indepen
dent of any partisan or
organizational alignments, allow
ing any undergraduate or gradu
ate Chicano student to run for
office.
However, the candidates had
been pre-selected on two unoffi
cial platforms. Four of the candi
dates — Hernandez, Inda,
freshman Ana Mata and graduate
student Ivan Murillo — repre
sented MEChA.
Ramirez, who received the most
votes, said he was "pleased with
the turnout. It was a good repre
sentation of the community." He
added that "it's unfortunate that
there were two platforms, but I
think people saw through that
and that it was a democratic elec
tion."
As a response to this alignment,
several non-MEChA members of
the Chicano community gathered
Wednesday night and selected

Ramirez, Arellano, and juniors
Armando Cano and Rebecca
Flores to balance the representa
tion of the community.
"There are no sides," claimed
Hernandez, who served as
MEChA co-chair this year, in her
allotted one-minute candidacy
speech. "We have moved forward
together."
However, Flores said that it was
"the first time in a long time that
a wide perspective of views got
voiced and people came together
that aren't necessarily aligned
with an organization." She added
that it was "a good opportunity
to bring the community together."
At least 10 non-Chicano stu
dents were present at the meeting,
which was open to anyone con
cerned with the Chicano commu
nity.
Prior to candidate nominations,
Assoc. Dean of Student Affairs Mi
chael Jackson made a plea to all
present to "vote with your con-
science" and examine their
eligibility as voting members of
the community.
There was concern by members
of both sides that non-Chicano
students had been called in to
"stack" the voting. Of the 204
ballots distributed prior to the
meeting, 190 were completed, re
flecting students who ultimately
refrained from voting.

In his opening remarks at the
meeting, Jackson outlined the
committee's responsibilities as a
four-fold task. The committee will
decide on the governing process
of El Centro, work with Student
Affairs in Chicano activities,
develop a job description for the
Chicano dean and constitute its
efforts as a search committee, ac
cording to Jackson.
Jackson was "very pleased"
with the results. "I'm very proud
of the Chicano community . . .
(they) proved they care about each
other, they care about the com
munity," he said.
