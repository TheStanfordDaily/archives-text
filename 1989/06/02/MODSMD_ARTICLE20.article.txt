## Just a few parting shots 
### 
I HAVE LOST ALL respect for the
participants in the occupation of
Donald Kennedy's office.
Most of the Agenda for Actions' stated
goals would be positive improvements
that Stanford should make.
However, the methods used by the
demonstrators were unproductive and
relatively useless: The University has
moved quickly to address the concerns
put forth in the UCMI report.
But until recently, poor timing, disor
ganization and bad methodology of the
demonstration were counter-balanced in
my mind by a certain amount of respect
for people who believe strongly in what
they were doing.
People who have the strength and are
committed enough to an issue to go to
jail deserve respect.
There is something very impressive
about the protesters of the '60s who
believed strongly enough to face down
the system and accept what it has to
offer, good and bad.
In the present case, however, we are
bombarded daily by participants in the
occupation whining about the fact that
they are being punished.
Protesters seem to expect the Univer
sity to drop all charges and pretend noth
ing ever happened.
The fact is that the people who occupied
President Kennedy's office broke a clearly
defined University policy. They were told
during the protest that they would face
possibly severe repercussions as a result
of their actions.
By maintaining that all punishments
should be withheld, the people involved

in the protest have detracted from the
strength of their statement.
Apparently, the demonstraters believe
in furthering their goals, but not enough
to face the consequences of their actions.
Presently there appears to be more con
cern about vitiating any punishment than
furthering the goals of the Agenda for
Action.
They have strengthened the image that
a bunch of kids decided to play the '60s
one sunny May day.

This year's COP has dealt an incredible
blow to the credibility of the entire ASSU
government.
By supporting the demonstration fi
nancially, the COP has made it clear that
they do not represent the student body.
What is the point of having a student
government that simply mirrors the ac
tions of other existing student groups?
The COP should be pursuing more gen
eral student goals that are not already
covered by a student lobbying group.
Members of the People's Platform have
said in the past that they feel they were
elected through the support of minority
students and should act on their agenda.
What they don't seem to realize is that
regardless of who specifically elected
them, the COP must represent the entire
student body.
I have heard more people than the
norm complaining about the ASSU and
the way the Peoples' Platform seems to
be twisting the institution.
By fragmenting the student body, the
COP has essentially transformed the

ASSU into a group that represents the
interests of some while alienating others.

In a move that might send shivers
through many students' spines, the Fac
ulty Senate will be considering a proposal
to raise the minimum passing grade for
the pass/no credit option to a C- from a
D-.
As a person who has taken a few classes
pass/no credit, I think it is about time
the standards be raised somewhat.
Presently, it is just too easy to squeak
by with a D- and get that passing grade.
I don't believe that the majority of Stan
ford students enroll in classes with the
idea of doing as little work as possible.
But some do.
The pass/no credit option has given
many students a needed breather from
the pressure of letter grading. Undoubt
edly, though, a minority of students do
take advantage of the option to get easy
units.
A C- standard still allows enough
leeway for a student to not worry too
much about a grade while still maintain
ing a certain amount of credibility and
the possibility of getting something out
of the class.
