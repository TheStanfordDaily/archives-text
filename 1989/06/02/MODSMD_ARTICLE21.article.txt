## Columnist did not think through issue of sexism 
### 
AFTER READING Burke Smith's
May 26 column, I felt that he
had failed to see the"the big
picture" once again.
Smith began his column by implying
that because some people took offense
to the full-page Budweiser ad and
asked The Daily not to run it that
they were denying the existence of
sexism. But in fact when The Daily
was asked not to run ads that they
consider sexist, the opponents of such
ads were facing the existence of sexism
and sending the message that it should
not be tolerated.
Next Smith reminds us that there is
a "real world" outside of Stanford in
which "isms" abound and that "it is
irresponsible to create an unrealistic
environment at Stanford."

It seems to me that Smith is saying
that simply because something exists
outside of Stanford, we should allow it
to exist on campus. In other words,
there is racism, sexism, homophobia
and anti-Semiticism in the "real
world," and they should exist at Stan
ford as well, so as not to rock the
status quo.
I refuse to buy that load. Stanford is
an extension of the real world, not a
world in and of itself. By not allowing
sexism at Stanford, we are saying that
it shouldn't exist outside of Stanford.
Smith then says that the only way
to change something is to talk about
it; talk, I guess, until it disappears.
Smith fails to realize that the only
way change comes about is through
action.

I believe most people at Stanford
realize that sexism exists. Those who
are asking The Daily to remove certain
ads are saying that we have moved
past debate; now is the time for posi
tive action.
Smith contends that if a person
deems an ad offensive, he or she
should not buy the product. Things are
not that simple. Since a majority of
the ads appearing on TV and in print
are sexist, among other things, con
sumers would have a hard time find
ing anything to purchase.
Smith believes that sexist ads appear
because of consumers. I must agree
that consumers should take the blame
for allowing such ads to persist, but
not all the blame. Due to the power of

the advertising media, consumers really
do not control much of what appears
in ads. However, they can influence
advertisers and that's what happened
in the case of the Bud ad.
Am I to believe that we should allow
sexism, racism, homophobia, etc. to
exist so that people can respond to
them; or, should we not tolerate such
things because they interfere with
humans' abilities to understand one
another?
I believe by the response to this Bud
ad and others like it, that a lot of
people are saying that sexism and the
other "isms" should not and will not
be tolerated.
