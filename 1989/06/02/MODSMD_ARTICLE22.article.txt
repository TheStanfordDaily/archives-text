# A 						logical extension of Daily's logic has scary implications
## 
### 
Given my tangential involvement in
the events of May 15, I have up to
now refrained from public comment,
not wishing to have my own remarks
confused with the University's policy.
But your editorial of May 31 exhausts
my patience and compels me to make
the following, strictly personal observa
tions.
Your editorial says, . . they were
demonstrating because of their commit
ment to the Agenda for Action, 13
demands they believe will improve
education for everyone at Stanford. .. .
It logically follows, then, that students
who are only trying to improve their
situation at the University should be
allowed to do so without fear of
reprisals. ..."

I have rarely encountered such falla
cious reasoning. The operative words
are "they believe," and The Daily com
mits the same mistake that countless
others have made in the past and will
make in the future: justifying any act
which the perpetrator asserts piously is
motivated by sincere belief.
The gravity of the fallacy can easily
be illustrated by considering instances
in history when the same tactic has
been used to justify anything from
tomfoolery to heinous atrocities.
Unless one wants to assert that
Nazis should not have been punished
for breaking windows on Kristallnacht
(they believed, after all, that what they
were doing was making a better Ger
many for everyone), one cannot swal
low the line that you promote without
indulging in hypocrisy of the crassest
sort. Both The Daily and everyone who
reads it ought to have a better sense
than to fall into this slipshod way of
thinking.
