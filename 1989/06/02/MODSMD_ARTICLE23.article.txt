# Editor's celebration shouldn't have been centered on alcohol
## 
### 
Congratulations to Timothy J.
Marklein for his election to editor in
chief. This is indeed an event worthy
of comment in the May 25 Daily. How
ever, 1 would like to question the use
of the picture that went alongside the
article.
According to your picture, it appears
as if "Cheesehead Marklein" reads
"proofs" other than those for the Daily
Project Risk Reduction of Intoxicants
in the Stanford Community (R2ISC)
has been working hard this year to
reduce the prevalence of rifiky drinking
on campus. Part of this involved
raising awareness in the community
about the impact of the media and the
pressure of the media toward drinking.
Your picture of "Timmer" downing a

bottle of Andre champagne clearly
demonstrates the mixed message that
celebrations demand the presence of
alcohol.
We understand that it was a time of
celebration. However as a news publi
cation, you certainly understand the
power of images to promote messages.
Perhaps next time, a more appropriate
photograph could be used.
