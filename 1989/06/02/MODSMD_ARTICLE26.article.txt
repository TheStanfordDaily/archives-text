Gays have right to
open-mindedness, if
not total approval
As Gay and Lesbian Awareness week
came to a close, I felt compelled to
write this letter. As a member of Stan
ford's black community, I can empat
hize with what the gay community has
been dealing with. It is unfortunate
that minority groups can be the object
of ridicule, jokes, prejudices and
stereotypes without any justification.
As homophobia continues to be
visible, I feel that all individuals on
the Farm should assess their viewpoint
of the gay movement. My intent here is
to be both inquisitive and informative.
I am only giving the limited perspec
tive of a black, Christian male who has
come to understand the gay movement.
How one feels about the gay move
ment is often interlinked to how one
perceives the long range goals of the
gay movement. This is a question that
I pose to Stanford's gay community. Is
your movement aiming for social ap
proval or social open-mindedness?
There is a distinction between the
two, and I feel that the gay movement
should strive for open-mindedness be
cause of the difficulties of fully accept
ing homosexuality.
By open-mindedness, I mean being

fair and having an objective attitude
towards differing opinions, practices,
races and religions. By approval, I
mean regarding an opinion, attitude or
practice as proper and good. The thing
in question would receive a personal
stamp of approval, and you would rec
ommend it to someone else.
Using these definitions, I want to
show how I have adopted an open
minded view of the gay movement
without fully accepting and approving
of homosexuality.
When I first came to Stanford, I had
never been in a community with a
sizable gay and lesbian population.
This was something new, and I could
have responded in one of the following
ways: I could be actively homophobic
and thus seek to publicly demean indi
viduals who are homosexual through
psychological or physical tactics; I could
be passively homophobic and pass
judgement on gays without making any
abusive comments, I could be open
minded about the whole thing; or I
could fully accept everything the gay
movement stands for.
I decided to be a passive homophobe
for a long time until I went to several
Residential Education programs, Gays
and Lesbians at Stanford presentations,
talked with several members of the gay
community and took Katchadourian's
Human Sexuality course. I became
aware of the fact that gays and les
bians are individuals who are entitled
not only to their civil rights, but to

their human rights as well.
Yet this creates a dilemma for me.
How do I come to grips with myself
and my personal value system when I
fully accept what rights the gay com
munity wants, but I don't fully accept
their practice of homosexuality?
To fully accept homosexuality is too
difficult for me because it undermines
the basic principles of my Christianity.
It is something that I simply cannot
do. Yet my religion also instructs me
to treat all others as equals and accept
them as human beings.
Because I believe that homosexuality
is wrong does not give me a free
license to pass moral judgements on
the members of the gay community
and be hostile towards them. What I've
learned to do it disassociate the prac
tice from the person. I have come to
view the practice of homosexuality as a
"choice" (this is a controversy in itself
but for the sake of simplicity I will use
this term).
I believe that the gay movement is
asking all other groups to recognize
their right to exercise freedom of
choice. When someone informs me that
he or she is a homosexual, I can nei
ther condemn nor condone their choice.
I can only say that it is not for me.
Sexual preference and sexual orienta
tion are only facets of what constitutes
a person. We must not be obsessed by
one aspect of a person; instead, we
must put things in their proper con
text. Being openminded allows me to

enjoy a wonderful friendship with any
gay student in an atmosphere that is
free of bigotry.

We write in regard to Keith Rabois'
May 30 letter. As moderate Republi
cans, we believe his views do not rep
resent those held by the majority of
Republicans at Stanford and elsewhere.
We speak for many silent Republi
cans here on campus when we say we
are behind the stated objectives of such
groups as the People's Platform and
the Agenda for Action. Just as Chinese
students fight for more democracy in
Beijing, on a smaller scale those Stan

the leadership of College Republicans
can see the light and do the same.

Let's clean it up
before parents get
here for graduation
This year I have suffered through
the rancid odors of rotten White Plaza,
the ugly droppings of ripped-up White
Plaza and the empty fountains of deso
late White Plaza.
Tresidder was blockaded and noisily
reconstructed, disrupting my lunch.
One afternoon I was reading short
stories at the Poli Sci Cafe and riot
police walked through to get donuts.
Through the open door I could hear
students chanting democratic values.
This hellish cacaphony must stop!
You see, my parents are arriving at
San Francisco Airport on Friday, June
16 on the 6:45 a.m. non-stop from
Cleveland. They're coming to see their
Tommy graduate.
Tommy has used many K's of Dad's
money. Dad goes to work selling
automobiles thinking of his hard
working scholar son. Mom gets up on
blizzardy morning to drive to the
Junior High to "substitute" (babysit
while teaching geometry).
Please accept my humble request to
keep things pretty and well-groomed
for graduation.

judgement on gays without making any
abusive comments, I could be open
minded about the whole thing; or I
could fully accept everything the gay
movement stands for.
I decided to be a passive homophobe
for a long time until I went to several
Residential Education programs, Gays
and Lesbians at Stanford presentations,
talked with several members of the gay
community and took Katchadourian's
Human Sexuality course. I became
aware of the fact that gays and les
bians are individuals who are entitled
not only to their civil rights, but to

their human rights as well.
Yet this creates a dilemma for me.
How do I come to grips with myself
and my personal value system when I
fully accept what rights the gay com
munity wants, but I don't fully accept
their practice of homosexuality?
To fully accept homosexuality is too
difficult for me because it undermines
the basic principles of my Christianity.
It is something that I simply cannot
do. Yet my religion also instructs me
to treat all others as equals and accept
them as human beings.
Because I believe that homosexuality
is wrong does not give me a free
license to pass moral judgements on
the members of the gay community
and be hostile towards them. What I've
learned to do it disassociate the prac
tice from the person. I have come to
view the practice of homosexuality as a
"choice" (this is a controversy in itself
but for the sake of simplicity I will use
this term).
I believe that the gay movement is
asking all other groups to recognize
their right to exercise freedom of
choice. When someone informs me that
he or she is a homosexual, I can nei
ther condemn nor condone their choice.
I can only say that it is not for me.
Sexual preference and sexual orienta
tion are only facets of what constitutes
a person. We must not be obsessed by
one aspect of a person; instead, we
must put things in their proper con
text. Being openminded allows me to

enjoy a wonderful friendship with any
gay student in an atmosphere that is
free of bigotry.

Let's clean it up
before parents get
here for graduation
This year I have suffered through
the rancid odors of rotten White Plaza,
the ugly droppings of ripped-up White
Plaza and the empty fountains of deso
late White Plaza.
Tresidder was blockaded and noisily
reconstructed, disrupting my lunch.
One afternoon I was reading short
stories at the Poli Sci Cafe and riot
police walked through to get donuts.
Through the open door I could hear
students chanting democratic values.
This hellish cacaphony must stop!
You see, my parents are arriving at
San Francisco Airport on Friday, June
16 on the 6:45 a.m. non-stop from
Cleveland. They're coming to see their
Tommy graduate.
Tommy has used many K's of Dad's
money. Dad goes to work selling
automobiles thinking of his hard
working scholar son. Mom gets up on
blizzardy morning to drive to the
Junior High to "substitute" (babysit
while teaching geometry).
Please accept my humble request to
keep things pretty and well-groomed
for graduation.

Gays have right to
open-mindedness, if
not total approval
As Gay and Lesbian Awareness week
came to a close, I felt compelled to
write this letter. As a member of Stan
ford's black community, I can empat
hize with what the gay community has
been dealing with. It is unfortunate
that minority groups can be the object
of ridicule, jokes, prejudices and
stereotypes without any justification.
As homophobia continues to be
visible, I feel that all individuals on
the Farm should assess their viewpoint
of the gay movement. My intent here is
to be both inquisitive and informative.
I am only giving the limited perspec
tive of a black, Christian male who has
come to understand the gay movement.
How one feels about the gay move
ment is often interlinked to how one
perceives the long range goals of the
gay movement. This is a question that
I pose to Stanford's gay community. Is
your movement aiming for social ap
proval or social open-mindedness?
There is a distinction between the
two, and I feel that the gay movement
should strive for open-mindedness be
cause of the difficulties of fully accept
ing homosexuality.
By open-mindedness, I mean being

fair and having an objective attitude
towards differing opinions, practices,
races and religions. By approval, I
mean regarding an opinion, attitude or
practice as proper and good. The thing
in question would receive a personal
stamp of approval, and you would rec
ommend it to someone else.
Using these definitions, I want to
show how I have adopted an open
minded view of the gay movement
without fully accepting and approving
of homosexuality.
When I first came to Stanford, I had
never been in a community with a
sizable gay and lesbian population.
This was something new, and I could
have responded in one of the following
ways: I could be actively homophobic
and thus seek to publicly demean indi
viduals who are homosexual through
psychological or physical tactics; I could
be passively homophobic and pass
judgement on gays without making any
abusive comments, I could be open
minded about the whole thing; or I
could fully accept everything the gay
movement stands for.
