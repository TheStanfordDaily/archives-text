Leen's desire to investigate
Miami's cocaine traffic seems nat
ural for an aspiring journalist
working in the city that is the

For many fans of "The Godfat
her," organized crime is a fantasy.
It is the Mafia, a glamorous relic
of the past associated with
Chicago streets, wealth, excite
ment, danger, murder and un
equivocal Italian family loyalty. It
reads like a best-selling suspense
thriller and is viewed as a Holly
wood saga of love, greed and
revenge.
For Jeff Leen, however, organ
ized crime is a reality, and this
reality is found not in the streets
of Chicago but in the mountains
of Colombia. For it is in these
mountains that the city of Medel
lin is found: Home to the world's
largest cocaine producing and
smuggling operation, the subject
of Leen's recently published bode,
"Kings of Cocaine: Inside the
Medellin Cartel: An Astonishing
True Story of Murder, Money and
International Corruption."
Leen is an investigative reporter
with the Miami Herald who has
been covering the drug trade in
that city since 1985. He is pres
ently attending Stanford under
the Knight Fellowship Program,
a program that sponsors 12 top
journalists in the nation to come
here for a year to audit classes,
share their experiences and ex
plore personal interests.
Growing up in St. Louis, Leen
gained journalism experience
writing for both his high school
and community papers. His inter
est then shifted toward fiction
writing, and he graduated from
Washington University with a
degree in creative writing and
drama.
Unsatisfied with the opportu
nities in that field, he returned
to reporting and received his

"hub" of the American drug
world. In 1985, his stories were
usually among the most exciting
of the week, as he covered local
busts and drug-related deaths.
As the year progressed, how
ever, he began to notice some pat
terns in his stories and to make

some links between them, leading
him to discover the true force
driving the Miami trade.
The cocaine trade can be de
scribed as a big hierarchical
pyramid, with the top of the
pyramid holding the most power
and earning the most money.
What Leen discovered was that
the top of this cocaine pyramid
was not located in Miami, as some
might think, but in the mountains
of Medellin.
This Medellin Cartel, as Leen
named it, was found to have four
leaders governing the operation,
with the smugglers, traders and
street dealers working on different
tiers below them.
In 1986, Leen's story heated up
as the drug trade escalated, in
volving much larger shipments of
cocaine and much greater violence
and intimidation. The Cartel
leaders were indicted by a federal
grand jury for producing and
smuggling 58 tons of cocaine, ac
cording to Leen a "staggering
amount"; a Drug Enforcement
Agency informant was murdered
in Baton Rouge by a Cartel hit
team; 25 people died cocaine
related deaths in six months in
Miami.
The magnitude of this cocaine
industry began to be realized by
the public, and Leen approached
Guy Gugliotta, a Herald reporter
who had been covering stories in
Central and South America for the
past 12 years, with the idea of
"joining forces" and doing a major
series on the trade.
Leen's work in Miami and
Gugliotta's work in Colombia cul
minated in a 10-part series that
ran in 1987, detailing the charac
ters, history, politics and mecha
nisms involved in the trafficking
of cocaine from Colombia to the
United States.
This series revealed to the

For Jeff Leen, organized crime is a
reality, and this reality is found not in
the streets of Chicago, but in the moun
tains of Colombia.

world the intricacies of the Medel
lin Cartel and was reproduced in
28 Colombian newspapers. This
reproduction of the series in
Colombia was a retaliation against
the drug traffickers who had in
the past five years terrorized the
Colombian press, killing 19 jour
nalists and harassing many
others.
After the series ran, Leen and
Gugliotta received a contract from
Simon and Schuster to expand the
series into a book, resulting in
"Kings of Cocaine." The book
traces the history of the Cartel,
beginning in 1974 with the arrest
of Carlos Lehder, an eventual Car
tel leader, for smuggling marijua
na, and ending with Lehder's
conviction in 1987 after the 1986
indictment. It follows the devel
opment of cocaine from a rare,
elite, expensive drug of the '70s
to the cheap, accessible, 80 percent
pure street drug it is today.
The book also stresses the
American involvement in the
trade as well as the Colombia !,
and as Leen puts it,"(The) bock
is about how the cocaine trade
grew and expanded in this coun
try."
Certainly, the Medellin Cartel
could not have grown to such a
massive and dangerous size with
out the increased demand for
cocaine. Leen estimates that there
are six million regular users of
cocaine in the United States, and
he asserts that "the reason the

trade grew so fast was because
there was such a demand (for it)
in this country."
"Kings of Cocaine" is not a
story with a happy ending, nor is
it a policy manual; instead it is a
well-documented coverage of an
industry that has created bil
lionaires out of drug dealers, and
billionaires who do not appear to
be getting any weaker.
The trade has terrorized Medel
lin, making it one of the most
dangerous cities in the world, once
recording nine murders a day and
76 killings of police officers in
1984. The Cartel leaders, in their
well-protected mansions and ex
travagant limousines manage to
stay one step ahead of the police
at all times, and therefore, only
Lehder has been captured and
convicted.
"It's a thriller," Leen says of
the recently released book, "we
tell it like a thriller." Whether or
not it will become a classic thriller
like "The Godfather," "Kings of
Cocaine" has gotten excellent
reviews and is probably bound to
be a best seller. Leen, however,
feels that there is much left out
of the book that has yet to be told.
This book marks only the be
ginning of the unravelling of the
cocaine trade, a trade that will
continue to grow as long as the
demand for cocaine remains high.
Besides, Leen admits, "I'm never
satisfied (with my work) — that's
what drives me."

who had been covering stories in
Central and South America for the

"joining forces" and doing a major
series on the trade.

Gugliotta's work in Colombia cul

ran in 1987, detailing the charac
ters, history, politics and mecha

of cocaine from Colombia to the
United States.
This series revealed to the

world the intricacies of the Medel
lin Cartel and was reproduced in
28 Colombian newspapers. This
reproduction of the series in
Colombia was a retaliation against
the drug traffickers who had in
the past five years terrorized the
Colombian press, killing 19 jour
nalists and harassing many
others.
After the series ran, Leen and
Gugliotta received a contract from
Simon and Schuster to expand the
series into a book, resulting in
"Kings of Cocaine." The book
traces the history of the Cartel,
beginning in 1974 with the arrest
of Carlos Lehder, an eventual Car
tel leader, for smuggling marijua
na, and ending with Lehder's
conviction in 1987 after the 1986
indictment. It follows the devel
opment of cocaine from a rare,
elite, expensive drug of the '70s
to the cheap, accessible, 80 percent
pure street drug it is today.
The book also stresses the
American involvement in the
trade as well as the Colombia !,
and as Leen puts it,"(The) bock
is about how the cocaine trade
grew and expanded in this coun
try."
Certainly, the Medellin Cartel
could not have grown to such a
massive and dangerous size with
out the increased demand for
cocaine. Leen estimates that there
are six million regular users of
cocaine in the United States, and
he asserts that "the reason the

trade grew so fast was because
there was such a demand (for it)
in this country."
"Kings of Cocaine" is not a
story with a happy ending, nor is
it a policy manual; instead it is a
well-documented coverage of an
industry that has created bil
lionaires out of drug dealers, and
billionaires who do not appear to
be getting any weaker.
The trade has terrorized Medel
lin, making it one of the most
dangerous cities in the world, once
recording nine murders a day and
76 killings of police officers in
1984. The Cartel leaders, in their
well-protected mansions and ex
travagant limousines manage to
stay one step ahead of the police
at all times, and therefore, only
Lehder has been captured and
convicted.
"It's a thriller," Leen says of
the recently released book, "we
tell it like a thriller." Whether or
not it will become a classic thriller
like "The Godfather," "Kings of
Cocaine" has gotten excellent
reviews and is probably bound to
be a best seller. Leen, however,
feels that there is much left out
of the book that has yet to be told.
This book marks only the be
ginning of the unravelling of the
cocaine trade, a trade that will
continue to grow as long as the
demand for cocaine remains high.
Besides, Leen admits, "I'm never
satisfied (with my work) — that's
what drives me."

of the past associated with
Chicago streets, wealth, excite

For Jeff Leen, however, organ

reality is found not in the streets
of Chicago but in the mountains
of Colombia. For it is in these
mountains that the city of Medel

largest cocaine producing and
smuggling operation, the subject
of Leen's recently published bode,
"Kings of Cocaine: Inside the
Medellin Cartel: An Astonishing
True Story of Murder, Money and

Leen is an investigative reporter

journalists in the nation to come

usually among the most exciting
of the week, as he covered local
busts and drug-related deaths.
As the year progressed, how
ever, he began to notice some pat
terns in his stories and to make

some links between them, leading
him to discover the true force
driving the Miami trade.
The cocaine trade can be de
scribed as a big hierarchical
pyramid, with the top of the
pyramid holding the most power
and earning the most money.
What Leen discovered was that
the top of this cocaine pyramid
was not located in Miami, as some
might think, but in the mountains
of Medellin.
This Medellin Cartel, as Leen
named it, was found to have four
leaders governing the operation,
with the smugglers, traders and
street dealers working on different
tiers below them.
In 1986, Leen's story heated up
as the drug trade escalated, in
volving much larger shipments of
cocaine and much greater violence
and intimidation. The Cartel
leaders were indicted by a federal
grand jury for producing and
smuggling 58 tons of cocaine, ac
cording to Leen a "staggering
amount"; a Drug Enforcement
Agency informant was murdered
in Baton Rouge by a Cartel hit
team; 25 people died cocaine
related deaths in six months in
Miami.
