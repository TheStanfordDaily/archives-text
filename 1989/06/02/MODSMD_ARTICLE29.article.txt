# Bug gropes for updates on lost heroes of the past
## 
### Mark Smoyer Senior staff writer 
Folks, there's only one more
Bug Me after this one, so treasure
it. It's long and haphazard, but
so is the Bible.
Some people know when to stop.
Most don't.
Bob Hope doesn't. James Dean
did.
J.D. Salinger did. James Mic
hener did not.
My parents did not (thus my
two younger sisters).
David Letterman will. Johnny
Carson never will.
Of course, why should anybody
stop what he or she is doing as
long as he or she enjoys it?
(raise voice here) I'LL TELL
YOU WHY! 'CAUSE IT'S DAMN
ANNOYING AND YOU'RE
MAKING A FOOL OF YOUR
SELF; THAT'S WHY!
Why then haven't I rid this
planet of myself, you ask. Well,
my parents would be a little irked,
and, as well, I provide a readily
available standard of worthless
ness by which others can prove
themselves somewhat significant.
But, most importantly for
today's "Where Are They Now"
column, Bobby Fischer knew
when to stop. Shields and Yarnell
and Billy Squier haven't learned
yet.
Dear Bug,
Where are Shields and Yarnell ?
— Edna St. Vincent Millay
(Warning: A tirade is approach
ing.) I assume you're asking so
you know where not to ever go
under any circumstances. I mean
it's nice that two mutes made it
on to TV and everything, but I
still hate Shields and Yarnell, and,
for that matter, anybody who
doesn't talk a lot and loudly.
And now, back to our regularly
scheduled doldrum . . . Robert
Shields and Lorene Yarnell were
married in the mid-1970s in a
mime wedding ceremony in Union
Square where they started their
careers as street performers. In
1978 and 1979, the "Shields and
Yarnell Show" was run on CBS.
Then ... DISASTER!
Shields and Yarnell appeared on
the cover of Dynamite and soon
thereafter fell prey to the dreaded

Dynamite cover jinx, wherein po
tentially long and fruitful careers
mysteriously fall apart (see the
toothy Erik Estrada, the haunting
Parker Stevenson, the feverish
Bay City Rollers, and the car
cinogenic Rick Springfield).
The two were soon divorced and
each is involved in a solo career.
In fact, Shields' management
agency, Irvin Arthur Associates,
says The Silent One will be per
forming during the last week of
June at San Francisco's Fairmont
Hotel. Too bad school will be over,
it'd be a beautiful Res Ed field
trip.
Incidentally, the Bug will pay a
contract killer top dollar to mur
der the members of Mum
menschanz — slowly.
Dear Bug,
Whatever happened to Bobby
Fischer.
— Boris Spassky
It's not surprising that you've
asked this question, Boris. The
last public chess match Bobby Fis
cher played was against you in
1972. It was from you that he
took the world championship to
become the first non-Soviet title
holder since 1948, and the first
American title holder in over a
century.
And then he sort of dropped off
the face of the earth.

Robert James Fischer made
chess part of America's popular
culture for one year, or rather,
Bobby Fischer himself was a part
of America's popular culture —
he has since risen out of that mire,
into cult status.
A good place to trace a person's
progress is in the Reader's Guide
to Periodical Literature, which
keeps track of who was written
about when and in which
magazines. Fischer's record of
coverage is very telling.
From March 1966 to February
1971 four articles are cited. Then
in one year, from March '71 to
February '72, there are 10 articles
on Fischer. Unbelievably, a total
of 33 magazine stories about a
single chess player were written
between March '72 and February
'73. Then he interred himself and
since 1973, only 10 articles on
Bobby Fischer are cited.
None of this is quite scientific,
but you get the idea. By compar
ison, the second most documented
sports figure in '72 was Billie Jean
King, with only six articles.
The last trace of Fischer was
recorded in 1985, when there were
two articles written about him.
As far as anyone knows, he is
still alive. The most recent article
on him appeared in Sports Il
lustrated July 29, 1985. Written
by William Nack, it is must
reading for anybody into myste
rious, obsessed, ingenius, or
alienated human beings.
In case you haven't figured it
out yet, I have no idea what has
happened to Fischer since '85,
when Nack spotted him at the
Los Angeles Public Library's main
branch but was too much in awe
to actually approach the guy. His
awe is understandable.
Three decades ago, "The Sweat
shirt Kid" won the American
chess championship, at the age of
14. That year, 1958, he also be
came the youngest International
Grand Master of all-time
anywhere.
Twenty years ago he was on his
way to the world championship.
He lost the crown by forfeit in
1975 after repeatedly refusing to
defend it because of disputes with
the chess powers-that-be.
In the last decade or so, he's
spent time reading Nazi litera
ture, having his fillings removed

to avoid electronic takeover of his
brain, and making claims that the
KGB is after him. To his credit,
however, there is no record of his
ever having watched "thir
tysomething" or "The Wonder
Years."
It seems he had a more normal
outlook on life while he was going
to high school in Brooklyn, when
he told the press that his teachers
were "all mental cases."
Before we move on, the Bug
will pass on his favorite chess
strategies. The principle behind
them is that most chess players
are unable to handle it when rules
from two different board games
are combined.
One of these tactics is simply
to move a pawn all the way across
the board, say "King me" and then
jump all of your opponent's pieces,
thereby forcing him or her to for
feit in confusion.
The other tactic is great for
combatting check-mate, an other
wise gloomy predicament. What
you do is you move one of your
pieces onto a square occupied by
the other guy, then say "Sorry!",
and move all his pieces back to
their original position. At this
point, yell "Mexicali!" and force
him to drink lots of grain alcohol
before play resumes.

Bobby Fischer took
the world champion
ship to become the
first non-Soviet title
holder since 1948,
and the first American
title holder in over a
century. And then he
sort of dropped off
the face of the earth.

Dear Bug
Billy Squier! Where have you
gone from our lives?!
— Loverboy
Ahh, yes! Billy Squier, a regular
guy with a big rockin' heart!
The albums: five solo releases
selling over ten million copies!
The singles: "My Kinda
Lover," "Lonely is the Night"!
Also, two Top 10 hits: "Everybody
Wants You" and "Rock Me
Tonite"! The man, the music, the
inability to spell.
Of course, his greatest hit was
1981's "The Stroke." Who can for

get the Boston rocker's call to a
generation of frustrated youth?
. . . "Strooooke me, stroke me,
stroke, stroke."
For those of you who were able
to forget, bad news lurks just a
couple of words away. . . . Billy is
alive and well and has a new al
bum coming out soon, entitled
"Hear & Now."
To find out what's going on with
Big Bill, the Bombastic Bug had
Capitol Records fax a press bio
directly to the Daily orifices. I'd
never had fax before, but it was
everything I'd always dreamed it
could be.
What kinda guy is Billy Squier?
"A rebel. A loner. A man who
plays by his own rules."
But don't take it from the press
agents, take it from Billy: "I have
basically done things my own
way," says Squier, who has
spurned the rock 'n roll Establish
ment by refusing to use the con
junction I've. "That reflects a
rebellious side, but I'm not a rebel
because I choose to be. I don't
make a conscious effort."
A video is now in the works for
the first "Hear & Now" single,
"Don't Say You Love Me." All
right, if you insist.
Until next week, the Bug has
stroken.
