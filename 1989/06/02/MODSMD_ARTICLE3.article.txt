# Coalition members label charges as diversion tactic
## 
### John Wagner Editorial staff 
Following an emotional meeting
with University President Donald
Kennedy yesterday, Agenda for
Action coalition members called
the campus disruption charges
issued against them a tactic to
prevent the development of mul
ticultural education at Stanford.
Emerging from Kennedy's of
fice in tears, coalition member
Julie Martinez said the Universi
ty's commitment to ethnic diver
sity was "nothing but a big lie."
By relentlessly pursuing the dis
ruption charges against students
who participated in the May 15
takeover of Kennedy's office, the
administration is condemning
more than the students' actions,
said Stacey Leyton, a member of
the coalition and the outgoing
Council of Presidents.
"We feel like they're going after
us," she said. "[They are going]
after what we represent, which is
the movement to make this a more
multicultural institution. That's
what we feel like is being threat
ened by these charges."
Kennedy told The Daily yester
day that the judicial charges had
been issued against those who oc

cupied his office as a matter of
University policy. "We're fully
committed to multicultural edu
cation," he said.
Formal charges of violating the
University's Policy on Campus
Disruption were issued Wednes
day to 53 students involved in the
takeover of Kennedy's office,
which was organized by the
Agenda for Action coalition.
In addition to the judicial proc
ess, the creation of a University
discrimination grievances board,
the hiring of a Native American
Studies professor and the institu
tion of a Chicano Fellows program
were discussed at the meeting yes
terday.
Coalition members said after
the meeting that they were out
raged by the judicial process the
University had launched against
them. The system is biased, they
said, because it will allow admin
istrators who have harshly criti
cized their actions to judge their
intentions and issue punishments.
"(Since) the day after the
takeover, we've been told by dif
ferent administrators that we're
guilty, that they're going to take
us to the wall," said Judy Wu, a
coalition member. "They don't
have a fair process set up for us.

The University's com
mitment to ethnic di
versity is 'nothing but
a big lie.'
— Julie Martinez

The people who are deciding are
definitely biased."
Students charged under the
campus disruption policy are
being granted two options under
the judicial process: They may
agree to the facts presented in the
charges and have the Office of
Student Affairs recommend a
penalty, or they may contest the
facts, go to a hearing officer and
then have the Stanford Judicial
Council recommend a penalty.
Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons said his office could com
plete the first procedure by the
end of June, while the second
channel would not begin until fall.
Students have until 10 a.m.
June 7 to choose between having
their cases heard by Lyons or by
the judicial council.
According to Leyton, students
are reluctant to submit them
selves to Lyon's mercy.
"Dean Lyons is supposed to be
the person who is hearing this
and he's one of the people who
students have the most problems
with," Leyton said. "We don't
want [the judicial process] to hang
over our head all summer. But,
we feel like we are being forced
to choose the other path."
Lyons told The Daily yesterday
that he was not unfairly biased
against the students involved in

the takeover. "1 don't believe
that's the case and I'm sorry they
feel that way," he said.
Lyons added that the judicial
process includes several
safeguards that would protect stu
dents against the bias of individ
ual administrators.
Kennedy said that the students'
argument about Lyons' objectivity
was undermined by the fact that
the president of the University,
not the dean of student affairs,
has the final say on student con
duct punishments.
"I determine the punishment,"
Kennedy said.
Martinez, a senior, expressed
deep concern after the meeting

with Kennedy that graduating
seniors will not receive their
diplomas until after the judicial
process has been completed.
"My mother and father take ex
tra jobs so they can get money to
come here [from San Antonio] and
see me graduate, and they don't
even know if I'm going to be able
to or if I will get my diploma
because this school can't decide
whether me standing up for more
Chicano faculty . . . was right or
wrong," she said.
Junior Cheryl Taylor, a coaliton
member, said she had been misled
by false promises of multicul
turalism when she decided to at
tend Stanford three years ago.
"I can't believe (the adminis
tration) has the gall to parade
around the country with those
badges of multiculturalism," she
said. "When it comes to really
respecting our presence here in a
really profound and deep way,

they just shit on us."
Gina Hernandez, the former co
chair of MEChA, a Chicano/
Latino student group, said stu
dents of color were being denied
the opportunity to contribute to
building a multicultural universi
ty • u
"We are not partners in this
partnership that Kennedy nation
ally proclaims," she said. "We are
still backed into a dark corner of
this University [due to] this Uni
versity's unwillingness to include
minorities."
According to Judicial Affairs Of
ficer Sally Cole, as of yesterday,
53 students had been charged with
violating the University's policy
on campus disruptions. Of these,
50 were among the 56 arrested
on misdemeanor charges in the
takeover of Kennedy's office.
According to Cole, it is
"probable" that more students
will be charged within the next

few days. She said she will receive
"a large number" of photos today,
which will help to identify some
students who have not yet been
charged.
Cole, the University official re
sponsible for issuing charges of
student conduct violations, said
she hopes to have all charges
related to the takeover mailed
within a week.
Cole confirmed yesterday that
students charged so far fail into
three categories:
• Those who were inside the
president's office;
• Those who first entered the
building, allegedly forcing or in
timidating two staff members into
leaving their legitimate place of
work; and
• Those who blocked the
entrances or provided assistance
from outside the building.
Jay Jay Kuo, a coalition mem
ber who did not participate in yes

terday's meeting with Kennedy,
said the differentiated charges
forced him to question the admin
istration's commitment to creat
ing a multicultural university.
"How can (the administration)
be for our cause when they plan
to remove from the cause its
strongest supporters? The cause
will suffer if student leaders are
suspended," he said.
Administrators have refused to
speculate on what punishments
will be given to those charged un
der the disruption policy.
The policy prescribes no specific
punishment, but rather allows
punishments to be determined on
the basis of mitigating circum
stances and past precedent.
The campus judicial proceed
ings are the largest since May 1,
1969, when 78 students were sub
ject to immediate temporary
suspension following the occupa
tion of Encina Hall.
