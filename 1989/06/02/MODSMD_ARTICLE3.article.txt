# Coalition members label charges as diversion tactic
## 
### John Wagner Editorial staff 
Following an emotional meeting
with University President Donald
Kennedy yesterday, Agenda for
Action coalition members called
the campus disruption charges
issued against them a tactic to
prevent the development of mul
ticultural education at Stanford.
Emerging from Kennedy's of
fice in tears, coalition member
Julie Martinez said the Universi
ty's commitment to ethnic diver
sity was "nothing but a big lie."
By relentlessly pursuing the dis
ruption charges against students
who participated in the May 15
takeover of Kennedy's office, the
administration is condemning
more than the students' actions,
said Stacey Leyton, a member of
the coalition and the outgoing
Council of Presidents.
"We feel like they're going after
us," she said. "[They are going]
after what we represent, which is
the movement to make this a more
multicultural institution. That's
what we feel like is being threat
ened by these charges."
Kennedy told The Daily yester
day that the judicial charges had
been issued against those who oc

cupied his office as a matter of
University policy. "We're fully
committed to multicultural edu
cation," he said.
Formal charges of violating the
University's Policy on Campus
Disruption were issued Wednes
day to 53 students involved in the
takeover of Kennedy's office,
which was organized by the
Agenda for Action coalition.
In addition to the judicial proc
ess, the creation of a University
discrimination grievances board,
the hiring of a Native American
Studies professor and the institu
tion of a Chicano Fellows program
were discussed at the meeting yes
terday.
Coalition members said after
the meeting that they were out
raged by the judicial process the
University had launched against
them. The system is biased, they
said, because it will allow admin
istrators who have harshly criti
cized their actions to judge their
intentions and issue punishments.
"(Since) the day after the
takeover, we've been told by dif
ferent administrators that we're
guilty, that they're going to take
us to the wall," said Judy Wu, a
coalition member. "They don't
have a fair process set up for us.

The University's com
mitment to ethnic di
versity is 'nothing but
a big lie.'
â€” Julie Martinez

The people who are deciding are
definitely biased."
Students charged under the
campus disruption policy are
being granted two options under
the judicial process: They may
agree to the facts presented in the
charges and have the Office of
Student Affairs recommend a
penalty, or they may contest the
facts, go to a hearing officer and
then have the Stanford Judicial
Council recommend a penalty.
Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons said his office could com
plete the first procedure by the
end of June, while the second
channel would not begin until fall.
Students have until 10 a.m.
June 7 to choose between having
their cases heard by Lyons or by
the judicial council.
