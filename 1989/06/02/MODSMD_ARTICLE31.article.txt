## Stanford seesaws at NCAAs 
### Greg Gottesman Staff writer 
Track and field is a sport of "ups and
downs."
Junior heptathlete Peggy Odita came
to this realization yesterday after her
14th place finish in the NCAA Track
and Field Championships at Brigham
Young.
"The meet had its ups and downs,"
Odita said. "It started ofT really horrible.
I was running to one of my best times
ever in the 110-meter hurdles. But I
caught the seventh hurdle and almost
fell. It took at least a second and a half
off what would have been a great time."
Despite her ominous start, Odita
ended the heptathlon with 5,270 points,
her third best score ever. The high score
came as a result of a seasonal best in
the 800 meters and personal records in
the javelin and 200 meters.
Odita attributed her personal record
in the 200 meters to a Snickers bar —
yes, a Snickers bar. "I had just shot
putted pretty bad," Odita said. "I didn't
feel it in my legs. So, I went and grabbed
a quick candy bar. I ended up having
a PR (personal record) in the 200."
Odita's 14th-place finish put her
ahead of five other women competitors.
Although her score did not equal her
NCAA qualifying mark of 5,439 or her
third-place Pac-10 score of 5,345, Odita
still was pleased with her performance.
"For all the downs that I had during

the meet, I thought that overall it was
pretty good," Odita said. "Besides, that's
my third highest score ever."
Jolanda Jones of Houston, the NCAA
heptathlon champion in 1986 and 1987,
won the event with a score of 6,022.
Tonya Sedwick of UCLA, the Pacific-10
conference champion, took home third
with a score of 5,765.
Junior shotputter Brian Boggess, the
only Cardinal male at the NCAAs,
finished his qualifying round in 11th
place yesterday, guaranteeing him a spot
in the 12-man shotput finals on Satur
day. The original competition consisted
of 22 men.
His throw of 58-8 gave Boggess third
place in his individual heat. Boggess, a
surprise story of sorts, made the NCAAs
earlier this month with a personal best
shotput of 59-BV£. The mark earned
Boggess fifth in the Pac-lOs and a spot
at the NCAAs.
Senior Patty Purpur, the only one of
the four Cardinal entrants to be com
peting in two events, kicked off her meet
yesterday with a fifth-place finish in
the qualifying round of the discus. Pur
pur, however, stressed that her throw
of around 162 feet did not matter. "It's
just qualifying," Purpur said.
Purpur will finish the discus event
on Friday. The shotput finals will be
held on Saturday. Purpur is seeded sec
ond in the shotput.
"I'm just going to go out there and

Tm just going to go out

do my best," Purpur said. "I am not
going to worry c 1 out who else is there.
As long as I do what I'm capable of
doing, I'll be just fine."
Senior Erica Wheeler, last Pac
-10 champion in the javeli , diu i c fare
as well as her Stanford pe«.r c respite
having beaten the defend;..*' NCAA
champion and this year's Par-10 title
holder in head-to-head competition,
Wheeler failed to make the final round
of the javelin yesterday. Wheeler
finished second at last year's NCAAs.
According to Purpur, Wheeler's throw
of 157 feet was the result of an off day.
"She had a bad day," Purpur said. "This
was not representative of what she is
able to do."
Odita, who will probably spend the
rest of the meet watching Boggess and
Purpur compete, said she looks forward
to next year. "It's going to be a lot of
work," Odita said. "I need to get con
sistent in the high jump and long jump.
I also need to work on my strength for
the shotput and javelin."

able to do."
Odita, who will probably spend the
rest of the meet watching Boggess and
Purpur compete, said she looks forward
to next year. "It's going to be a lot of
work," Odita said. "I need to get con
sistent in the high jump and long jump.
I also need to work on my strength for
the shotput and javelin."

After finishing second in the 1988 NCAA Track and Field Championships javelin
event, Senior Erica Wheeler failed to qualify yesterday for this year's final round.
Track and field is a sport of "ups and
downs."
Junior heptathlete Peggy Odita came
to this realization yesterday after her
14th place finish in the NCAA Track
and Field Championships at Brigham
Young.
"The meet had its ups and downs,"
Odita said. "It started ofT really horrible.
I was running to one of my best times
ever in the 110-meter hurdles. But I
caught the seventh hurdle and almost
fell. It took at least a second and a half
off what would have been a great time."
Despite her ominous start, Odita
ended the heptathlon with 5,270 points,
her third best score ever. The high score
came as a result of a seasonal best in
the 800 meters and personal records in
the javelin and 200 meters.
Odita attributed her personal record
in the 200 meters to a Snickers bar —
yes, a Snickers bar. "I had just shot
putted pretty bad," Odita said. "I didn't
feel it in my legs. So, I went and grabbed
a quick candy bar. I ended up having
a PR (personal record) in the 200."
Odita's 14th-place finish put her
ahead of five other women competitors.
Although her score did not equal her
NCAA qualifying mark of 5,439 or her
third-place Pac-10 score of 5,345, Odita
still was pleased with her performance.
"For all the downs that I had during

the meet, I thought that overall it was
pretty good," Odita said. "Besides, that's
my third highest score ever."
Jolanda Jones of Houston, the NCAA
heptathlon champion in 1986 and 1987,
won the event with a score of 6,022.
Tonya Sedwick of UCLA, the Pacific-10
conference champion, took home third
with a score of 5,765.
Junior shotputter Brian Boggess, the
only Cardinal male at the NCAAs,
finished his qualifying round in 11th
place yesterday, guaranteeing him a spot
in the 12-man shotput finals on Satur
day. The original competition consisted
of 22 men.
His throw of 58-8 gave Boggess third
place in his individual heat. Boggess, a
surprise story of sorts, made the NCAAs
earlier this month with a personal best
shotput of 59-BV£. The mark earned
Boggess fifth in the Pac-lOs and a spot
at the NCAAs.
Senior Patty Purpur, the only one of
the four Cardinal entrants to be com
peting in two events, kicked off her meet
yesterday with a fifth-place finish in
the qualifying round of the discus. Pur
pur, however, stressed that her throw
of around 162 feet did not matter. "It's
just qualifying," Purpur said.
Purpur will finish the discus event
on Friday. The shotput finals will be
held on Saturday. Purpur is seeded sec
ond in the shotput.
"I'm just going to go out there and

Tm just going to go out
there and do my best. I
am not going to worry
about who else is there.'

do my best," Purpur said. "I am not
going to worry c 1 out who else is there.
As long as I do what I'm capable of
doing, I'll be just fine."
Senior Erica Wheeler, last Pac
-10 champion in the javeli , diu i c fare
as well as her Stanford pe«.r c respite
having beaten the defend;..*' NCAA
champion and this year's Par-10 title
holder in head-to-head competition,
Wheeler failed to make the final round
of the javelin yesterday. Wheeler
finished second at last year's NCAAs.
According to Purpur, Wheeler's throw
of 157 feet was the result of an off day.
"She had a bad day," Purpur said. "This
was not representative of what she is
able to do."
Odita, who will probably spend the
rest of the meet watching Boggess and
Purpur compete, said she looks forward
to next year. "It's going to be a lot of
work," Odita said. "I need to get con
sistent in the high jump and long jump.
I also need to work on my strength for
the shotput and javelin."
