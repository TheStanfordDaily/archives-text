# Cardinal sports spawn sweet memories of the Farm

But it is not nights spent on papers
and problem sets that will be remembered.
It is winning Big Game, beating
and running onto the court at Maples,
and hopefully winning the College World
Series. It is sunny afternoons spent in
Stanford Stadium and Sunken Diamond
and the friends we spent them with.
â€” John Lis, columnist
The Stanford Daily, June 3, 1987
The dreaded time has finally arrived.
After four long (endless?) years,
the University is at last sending
me on my way, a non-stop flight into the
reed world.
Immediate implication: This is my final
column.
Looking back over the quadrennium I
spent at Stanford, I have certainly been
blessed with an abundance of fond mem
ories and rewarding experiences. Since
fell quarter of freshman year, many of
my most enjoyable moments have coin
cided with Stanford sports and many of
the closest friendships I have made trace
their roots into athletics.
All this for one who hated sports in
high school and maneuvered his way out
of P.E. classes.
It's been quite a metamorphosis. Four
years ago, Lis' comment would have been
totally irrelevant to my lifestyle. Now
fewer words ring truer.
Forgive the self-indulgence and any
lapses of sentimentality which may ensue,
but it's time for an extended walk down
memory lane. From the home office in
Palo Alto, it's time for Evan's Top 10
Stanford Sports Memories.
10. Women's volleyball Final Four,
1985. My first national championship
event and the closest I've come to athletic
glory.

The location was Kalamazoo, Mich.
Stanford, behind senior captain Kim
Oden, entered the Final Four as the fa
vorite after spending the second half of
the season as the No. 1 team in the
nation. I was the team manager at that
point, so a spot was reserved for me on
the bench.
This was back in the old days when
the top four teams in the country were
part of the Final Four, rather than two
championship-caliber teams and two
regional bids. In *85, UCLA, USC and
Pacific joined Stanford for the festivities.
Stanford blew its way into the final
and faced UOP for the title. Elaina Oden's
UOP.
It was an Oden versus Oden final, and
the younger sister came out on top.
Pacific won its first of two straight cham
pionships. But, judging by the tears in
Elaina's eyes after overturning her
Player-of-the-Year sister's dream season,
it is hard to call it a triumphant win.
Not all poignant memories are happy.
9. Stanford women's tennis vs. USIU,
1987. Just one in a series of blowouts
for the NCAA-championship-bound Car
dinal.
But that's not why I remember the
day. The reason this home match has

stuck in my mind is because of one in
cident in the No. 1 doubles match when
Patty Fendick really got mad.
For those who have not seen her play,
Fendick is a fierce competitor who fought
her way to two straight NCAA singles
titles. Personality-wise, however, she is
a mild and congenial person, difficult to
anger.
But on this fine day, in the middle of
a doubles match, USIU's Kefi Binyamini
pushed Fendick a bit too far.
The trouble started over questionable
line calls. Perhaps my bias was as strong
as Fendick's, but it seemed that
Binyamini periodically became near
sighted, especially when she was calling
balls long.
One call was particularly ridiculous,
but Fendick remained quiet. On the next
play, Binyamini accused Fendick of miss
ing a call, as if the No. 1 player in the
country needed to cheat in a blow-out
doubles match.
Fendick was bitter. Her partner Steph
anie Savides stepped back to serve, and
Fendick waited eagerly at the net.
The serve went to Binyamini's partner
(whose name, unfortunately, has been
washed from my mind by the tide of
time), who sent the ball straight at Fen
dick. Two seconds later, a Fendick over
hand sent the ball rocketing at
Binyamini's heels, missing them by
inches.
"Sorry," Fendick said with complete
indifference as she walked away from the
net.
Lesson of the day: Don't get Patty mad.
8. Big Game, 1985-88. Big Game is
perhaps the weirdest event in all of sports.
The UCLA-USC rivalry is intense; the
Stanford-Cal rivalry borders on the
bizarre.

All this for one who
hated sports in high
school and maneu
vered his way out of
P.E. classes.

For one week of the year, everyone at
Stanford suddenly remembers we have a
rival. Alums get excited, students get
their tickets, and Lady Luck flips a coin
to see who will win.
It's almost an unwritten rule, the 11th
Commandment: Thou shalt not be able
to predict the Big Game winner. It does
not matter in the least which team has
more talent or a better record; Big Game
is a one-game season.
In my four years, the team that was
supposed to win didn't. Freshman year,
when Stanford was average, the Cardinal
won. Sophomore year, when the team
was invited to the Gator Bowl and had
a rare winning season (and even broke
the top 20 for a week!), Stanford didn't.
Last year, we did. This year, we tied.
It's all too weird.
7. Stanford men's gymnastics vs.
UCLA at Maples, 1989. One of the most
exciting gymnastics meets I've been to,
but a less-than-ideal Maples finale for
captain Andy Ropp and All-American
Scott Schaffer.
Through five rotations, it seemed that
Stanford would knock UCLA off of the
No. 1 pedestal the Bruins precariously
rested on. The Cardinal had a one-point
advantage going into the final event, and

UCLA needed career performances to
best the home team.
The Bruins got them.
Not all poignant memories are happy.
6. NCAA Women's Golf Champion
ships, 1989. Better known as "What Evan
did last week."
What a thriller. It all came down to
one shot by a golfer not predicted to win
the championship, playing for an un
heralded team.
But what will stick with me is the
congeniality behind the competition.
Stanford finished 10th; but from the
smiles on the faces of Jodi Figley, Steph
anie Davis, Audrey Wooding, Stephanie
Parel and Adele Moore once the final
round was played, you would think the
Cardinal won the whole thing.
The whole team will be back next year.
If Figley and Moore stay on track, and
if Wooding shines even half as brightly
as she did last week, Stanford may yet
be on track for a national championship.
Just a last gasp of speculation. Now
back to memories.
5. Paul Carey's grand slam at the
College World Series, 1987. An immortal
swing that brought the first of two
straight baseball trophies to the Farm.
Only Kirk Gibson's prayer in the first
game of this past major "league World
Series can compare to the magnitude of
Carey's homer.
In the word of my colleague Mark Ro
gowsky, "Awesome."
4. Sandra Birch at the NCAA Women's
Tennis Championships, 1989. Who says
the nice guy always finishes last?
Birch, who won a team trophy and
individual title in one week and came
close to winning doubles as well, is clearly
