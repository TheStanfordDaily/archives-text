In a somewhat unexciting end to their season,
Stanford's women sailors tacked to an 11th place
finish at this year's national championships, hosted
by the Chicago Yacht Club during the first half of
this week.
Finishing first overall was the squad from Brown,
followed by Tufts, Navy, Old Dominion and Charles
ton. UC-Irvine, the other West Coast team, finished
eighth in the 16-boat fleet.
For the Cardinal, inconsistent starts and trouble
handling Lake Michigan's heavy winds meant
finishes in the back half of the fleet. Because Stan
ford's women sailors were the lightest teams at the
regatta, they had difficulty keeping their speed as
the wind built to over 25 knots.
The team did have its moments, however. Fresh
man Cathy Petzold sailed from second-to-last into
first place at the finish of Tuesday's last race.
Petzold, who hails from Detroit, had an eye for
wind shifts throughout the regatta.
Starting in A Division for the Cardinal were junior
Kim Grose and senior Amy Baltzer. Petzold came
in midway through the event, after eleven of the
16 races had been sailed. In B Division, senior Buff
Wendt sailed with two crews, freshman Chris Li
and junior Tracy Turner.
All six Stanford sailors had high hopes going into
the regatta after a second place finish at the Pacific
Coast Championships and a ninth place finish at
the Navy Women's Regatta.
Still, Coach Blake Middleton was proud of his
team.
"The competition was intense, and our team did
well to stay in every race. We shouldn't forget that
we've established ourselves as the 11th best team
in the whole country," Middleton said.
Already, the team has turned its eye toward next
year. Though Wendt will be graduating this month,
Grose and Petzold both have another chance to sail
in the national championships. Of course, they will
have to earn the chance by sailing against a star
studded class of freshman recruits.
At the same time the women are looking forward
to next year, however, Stanford's team-racing squad
is looking forward to next week, when it gets another
chance to sail in Chicago. The team hopes that the
second try will be the charm.
