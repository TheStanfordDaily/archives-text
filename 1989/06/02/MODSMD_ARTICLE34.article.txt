# Women rowers vie for national crown
## 
### Andrew Wilcox Staff writer 
The women's crew team will try
to join Stanford's growing list of
national champions Sunday at the
U.S. Collegiate Rowing Champi
onships in Madison, Wis.
The team will have a good shot
at its first-ever national title
against a small but tough field
consisting of Washington, Cornell
and Wisconsin.
Washington, which has cap
tured six of the last seven national
titles, figures to be the team to
beat, according to coach John
Davis. But Stanford will have the
revenge factor on its side, after
the Huskies defeated the Cardinal
three weeks ago for the Pacific-10
Conference championship.
"I think we can beat Washing
ton," Davis said. "The boat has
improved a lot since Pac-lOs, and
if we continue to row with poise,
we could win."
As for the Cardinal's other op
ponents, Stanford topped Wiscon
sin by three and one-half seconds
at the Redwood Shores Rowing
Classic in April. By virtue of that
win, the Cardinal would appear
to have an edge, but Wisconsin
will be in its own backyard. The
crowd might play a factor in a
tight race.
Stanford has not faced Cornell
this season but judging from com
parative times the two crews are
about even, Davis said.
This year's field includes two
fewer '.'..an the typical six

team championship because two
of the expected participants,
Radcliffe and Princeton, declined
their invitations. Radcliffe, which
is ranked number one in the na
tion, will travel to a regatta in
England.
Davis was critical of Radcliffe's
choice not to pursue the national
title after finishing the regular
season in the top spot. "I think
they're hurting the sport," Davis
said. "There are lots of ways to
lose a championship, and the best
way is not to come."
The Cardinal rowers, after
struggling for several weeks in the
middle of the season, appear to
be surging in time for the cham
pionship. "We're looking a lot bet
ter in the boat and our
smoothness in the water is coming
back. We're starting to show signs
of peaking, and it looks like we've
been putting on speed," Davis
said.
Davis attributed the team's sud
den turnaround to a return to
fundamentals in practice.
The Stanford boat is anchored
by three all Pac-10 rowers, junior
coxswain Keri Simmons, sopho
more Audrey Barnett and junior
Diana Olson.
On the men's side, only one Car
dinal was named to the all
conference team, senior captain
Tyler Simonton. Simonton and
junior Scott Evans have been in
vited this summer to the U.S. pre
elite heavyweight training camp,
a preparation camp for the U.S.
national team.
