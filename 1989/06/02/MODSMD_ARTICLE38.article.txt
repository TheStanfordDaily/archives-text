# Fac Sen unanimously votes for C- minimum satisfactory grade
## 
### 
The Faculty Senate voted
unanimously last night to alter
Stanford's 16-year-old student
elected grading option, raising
the minimal pass grade from
a D- to a C-, and renaming it
the satisfactory/no credit sys
tem.
The change was mostly
prompted by concerns among
some faculty that earning a D
did not deserve a passing grade.
Also, there were concerns
that the grading option was
being misused. According to
some faculty, too many stu

dents use the grading option in
their majors, although it is pri
marily intended for students ex
perimenting with courses.
There are two forms of satis
factory/no credit grading:
student-elected, when instruc
tors offer the letter grade op
tion also, and instructor
elected, when instructors do
not give letter grades.
Student-elected passing
grades are recorded on tran
scripts with a" + while
instrucor-elected passing
grades are recorded with a P.
