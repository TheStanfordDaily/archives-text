# The 						president and judicial process
## Kennedy claims detachment 
### Morgan Slain Staff writer 
University President Donald Kennedy said yes
terday he has not had a role in the charges brought
against more than 50 students who participated in
the May 15 takeover of his office.
Speaking at a Faculty Senate meeting, Kennedy
also fielded questions from students and professors
critical of his administration's prosecution of the
students, who have been charged with violating the
University's Policy on Campus Disruption.
In his opening remarks, Kennedy stressed that,
in accordance with University policy, he did not
know what charges are being brought against the
students, nor which students are being charged.
Kennedy — who ultimately has the power to
decide which penalties will be levied against which
students — emphasized throughout the afternoon
that he is separated from the current judicial proc
ess.
Later, answering a question about the charges,
Kennedy repeated, "I have not seen them. 1 did not

participate in drafting them."
So far, 53 students have been charged with violat
ing the University's campus disruption policy in the
wake of the student seizure of Kennedy's office May
15.
Kennedy told the senate that he had since par
ticipated in three meetings with leaders of the
protest. He called the sessions "constructive," but
added that the first two had been more successful
than the last, which took place yesterday.
Responding to claims that "people are being sin
gled out" by prosecutors, Kennedy said, "Different
actions can produce different penalties," but if ac
tions are equivalent, differing charges are unrea
sonable.
Outgoing Council of Presidents member Stacey
Leyton, one of the students arrested at the protest,
was the first to speak after Kennedy completed his
remarks. She complained that students could not
receive a fair hearing and that students promised
amnesty for leaving the seized builing early had
been issued charges anyway.
Kennedy said Leyton, and
anyone else who sees a problem
with the University charges,
should discuss their concerns with
Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons.
Kennedy then reiterated that he
could not comment on the charges
since he did not know about them,
but he said students would receive
a fair hearing when the case even
tually reaches him. "I have al
ready made a commitment that I
will not differentiate based on (the
students') history" or any other

external criteria, he said.
Spanish and Portuguese Prof.
Mary Pratt then told Kennedy
that delivering the charges con
flicted with the goal of working
toward multicultural concerns.
Kennedy replied that the con
flict was challenging, but said not
dealing with multicultural con
cerns until the judicial process has
run its course would be worse.
English Prof. Ronald Rebholz
said that the arrested students
would be punished by both the
state and campus authorities,
meaning they would be punished
twice. "Doesn't this bother your
conscience?" he asked Kennedy,
who was sitting just a few feet in
front of him.
Kennedy criticized Rebholz for

prematurely assuming the stu
dents would be found guilty and
punished. Then he said that for
more than two decades, campus
judicial policy has been indepen
dent of outside judicial policy.
ASSU Senate Chair David
Porter said there remained a pos
sibility that more campus charges
would be brought up, and this
created uncertainty for students
involved in the protest, especially
graduating seniors. "When will
the process of making charges
end?" asked Porter.
Kennedy said he did not know,
since he was not part of the in
vestigation. Kennedy then said he
would press his colleagues work
ing on the case for a quick "ter
mination of ambiguity."
