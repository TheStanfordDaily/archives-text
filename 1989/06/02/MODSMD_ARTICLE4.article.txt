## Kennedy claims detachment 
### Morgan Slain Staff writer 
University President Donald Kennedy said yes
terday he has not had a role in the charges brought
against more than 50 students who participated in
the May 15 takeover of his office.
Speaking at a Faculty Senate meeting, Kennedy
also fielded questions from students and professors
critical of his administration's prosecution of the
students, who have been charged with violating the
University's Policy on Campus Disruption.
In his opening remarks, Kennedy stressed that,
in accordance with University policy, he did not
know what charges are being brought against the
students, nor which students are being charged.
Kennedy — who ultimately has the power to
decide which penalties will be levied against which
students — emphasized throughout the afternoon
that he is separated from the current judicial proc
ess.
Later, answering a question about the charges,
Kennedy repeated, "I have not seen them. 1 did not

participate in drafting them."
So far, 53 students have been charged with violat
ing the University's campus disruption policy in the
wake of the student seizure of Kennedy's office May
15.
Kennedy told the senate that he had since par
ticipated in three meetings with leaders of the
protest. He called the sessions "constructive," but
added that the first two had been more successful
than the last, which took place yesterday.
Responding to claims that "people are being sin
gled out" by prosecutors, Kennedy said, "Different
actions can produce different penalties," but if ac
tions are equivalent, differing charges are unrea
sonable.
Outgoing Council of Presidents member Stacey
Leyton, one of the students arrested at the protest,
was the first to speak after Kennedy completed his
remarks. She complained that students could not
receive a fair hearing and that students promised
amnesty for leaving the seized builing early had
