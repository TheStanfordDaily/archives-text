History Prof. Kennell Jackson is step
ping down as chair of the Program in
African and Afro-American Studies
after what he calls nine "frustrating"
years of trying to build a solid program.
Jackson, who will resign at the end
of this quarter, said the biggest problem
with the program is that Stanford lacks
faculty capable of teaching Afro-
American studies. Most notably, he said
the program lacks professors who teach
political science and sociology. According
to Jackson, there are only about five
professors in the program who teach
mostly Afro-American literature and
history.
Jackson said that the dearth of faculty
in Afro-American studies has meant
fewer courses for students who wish to
become exposed to the subject. He said

there are about 13 students mtyoring
in the program and many more students
taking introductory courses.
Underscoring Jackson's criticisms, a
University report released in yesterday's
Faculty Senate found Afro-American
studies needs more faculty. The report
recommended that the School of Hu
manities and Sciences "actively pursue
the recruitment of faculty in fields
related to the interests of lAfro-
American studies! that are currently un
derrepresented at Stanford."
Jackson said the report doesn't put
enough blame on the University admin
istration which has not committed itself
to minority faculty hiring. He added
that the University practices "discrim
ination on funding" for the program.
Humanities and Sciences Associate
Dean Ted Andersson, the liason between
the administration and the Afro-
American program, said there is a gen

eral agreement in the administration
that the program should be improved.
He said, however, administration inertia
isn't the problem.
Andersson said the pool of qualified
ethnic studies professors is a "tough
market." He disagreed with Jackson
that there is a lack of committment to
minority faculty hiring, citing efforts
made in the last two years to attract
Afro-American studies professors. The
new appointments weren't made, An
dersson said, because of the lack of pro
fessors in those fields.
Andersson said the department has
had "a fair share" of funding and there
is much disagreement as to whether the
program needs more money. The issue
will be "discussed more," he said.
Andersson said that ideally there
would be at least three new appoint-
