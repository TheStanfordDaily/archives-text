# Jackson resigns Afro-American chair
## 
### Ken Yew Staff writer 
History Prof. Kennell Jackson is step
ping down as chair of the Program in
African and Afro-American Studies
after what he calls nine "frustrating"
years of trying to build a solid program.
Jackson, who will resign at the end
of this quarter, said the biggest problem
with the program is that Stanford lacks
faculty capable of teaching Afro-
American studies. Most notably, he said
the program lacks professors who teach
political science and sociology. According
to Jackson, there are only about five
professors in the program who teach
mostly Afro-American literature and
history.
Jackson said that the dearth of faculty
in Afro-American studies has meant
fewer courses for students who wish to
become exposed to the subject. He said

there are about 13 students mtyoring
in the program and many more students
taking introductory courses.
Underscoring Jackson's criticisms, a
University report released in yesterday's
Faculty Senate found Afro-American
studies needs more faculty. The report
recommended that the School of Hu
manities and Sciences "actively pursue
the recruitment of faculty in fields
related to the interests of lAfro-
American studies! that are currently un
derrepresented at Stanford."
Jackson said the report doesn't put
enough blame on the University admin
istration which has not committed itself
to minority faculty hiring. He added
that the University practices "discrim
ination on funding" for the program.
Humanities and Sciences Associate
Dean Ted Andersson, the liason between
the administration and the Afro-
American program, said there is a gen

eral agreement in the administration
that the program should be improved.
He said, however, administration inertia
isn't the problem.
Andersson said the pool of qualified
ethnic studies professors is a "tough
market." He disagreed with Jackson
that there is a lack of committment to
minority faculty hiring, citing efforts
made in the last two years to attract
Afro-American studies professors. The
new appointments weren't made, An
dersson said, because of the lack of pro
fessors in those fields.
Andersson said the department has
had "a fair share" of funding and there
is much disagreement as to whether the
program needs more money. The issue
will be "discussed more," he said.
Andersson said that ideally there
would be at least three new appoint-
ments in Afro-American literature
and the social sciences. The diffi
culty in attracting ethnic studies
faculty, however, may prevent that
goal, he said. Andersson said the
earliest a new Afro-American
studies professor will be hired is
the fall of 1990.
Jackson speculated that Lin
guistics Prof. John Rickford may
be the next Afro-American studies
chair. Rickford said he was work
ing closely with the program's de
velopment for next year, but did

not confirm whether he would be
the next chair.
Rickford said Jackson "provided
great leadership" through the
years both within and outside of
Afro-American studies. He cited
the Undergraduate Scholars Pro
gram that Jackson started three
years ago which allows students
to work closely with faculty on
research projects in Afro-
American studies.
In reference to the Afro-
American program, Rickford said
Jarkson did a good job "allowing
the program to remain viable."
He said the fact that there are a
number of students in Afro-
American studies gives "good

evidence he was holding it to
gether."
Afro-American studies mcgor
Louis Jackson, unrelated to Ken
nell Jackson, said the professor's
departure will be a significant loss
to the program. He said the al
ready overworked faculty who
teach Afro-American courses
won't be able to fill Prof. Jack
son's position, predicting that the
next chair will be "burned out in
another year or two."
Louis Jackson pointed out that
Afro-American studies only
receives $60,000 a year, leaving
only $10-12,000 for the program
after paying for salaries.
