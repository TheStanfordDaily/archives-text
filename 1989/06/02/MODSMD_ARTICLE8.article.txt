# ASSU splits over salary hike; next year's budget undecided
## 
### Baldwin Lee Staff writer 
The 1988-89 ASSU Senate left next
year's senate without an operating budget,
but the controversial budget rejected last
night still stands a chance in next year's
senate, where it may pick up further
People's Platform support.
The two primary reasons for the downfall
of the proposed budget were the debate
surrounding a 33 percent increase in the
salaries of the Council of Presidents, senate
chair and deputy chair, and a last-minute
arrival of the budget to the Budget and
Finance committee. Each COP member and
senate chair would have been paid about
$6,000 each if the budget passed.
The budget did not reach the committee
until 6:30 p.m. last night, one half hour
before the regular senate meeting was to
begin.
ASSU Financial Manager Valerie Huang
attributed the delay to several factors, in
cluding University delay in submitting

their part of the budget and the inability
of the committee to achieve a quorum last
Monday.
The voting yesterday showed a conflict
between People's Platform party members,
who supported pay raises, and more con
servative senators, who voted for lesser pay
raises.
Because of the great minority People's
Platform senators enjoy in next year's sen
ate, the proposed budget faces a good
chance of passing.
Discussion in the 1988-89 senate's final
meeting — the senate voted to dissolve
itself at the end of yesterday's meeting —
focused on the current and proposed
salaries of the COP members and senate
chair.
Senate Chair David Porter, a key author
of the proposed budget, said the disparity
in salary increases — most other salaries
were increased by five percent — was due
to a senate policy to keep COP and senate
chair salaries at one-half of Uni
versity tuition.
Porter said the other five per
cent salary increases were de
signed to keep up with cost-of
living adjustments.
COP member David Brown, a
member of next year's COP as
well, said that he felt the COP
salary increase was too much, and
that COP members should work
because of a commitment to Stan
ford. Brown said he felt a $5,000
salary, an 11 percent increase, was
adequate.
Graduate student senator Ed
Sasaki, next year's senate chair,
also disagreed with the pay hike.
Sasaki said students would per
ceive the 33 percent raise nega
tively, recalling this year's at
tempted U.S. Congressional pay
raise.
The senate, however, voted
down a motion to amend the
budget to pay the COP members
and senate chair salaries of
$5,000.
Opponents of the $5,000 salary
cited the lack of a policy in de
ciding the arbitrary amount.
At 10 p.m., the senate voted to
reject the entire budget for a sec
ond time, and adjourned.
