# ASSU splits over salary hike; next year's budget undecided

### Baldwin Lee Staff writer 
The 1988-89 ASSU Senate left next
year's senate without an operating budget,
but the controversial budget rejected last
night still stands a chance in next year's
senate, where it may pick up further
People's Platform support.
The two primary reasons for the downfall
of the proposed budget were the debate
surrounding a 33 percent increase in the
salaries of the Council of Presidents, senate
chair and deputy chair, and a last-minute
arrival of the budget to the Budget and
Finance committee. Each COP member and
senate chair would have been paid about
$6,000 each if the budget passed.
The budget did not reach the committee
until 6:30 p.m. last night, one half hour
before the regular senate meeting was to
begin.
ASSU Financial Manager Valerie Huang
attributed the delay to several factors, in
cluding University delay in submitting

their part of the budget and the inability
of the committee to achieve a quorum last
Monday.
The voting yesterday showed a conflict
between People's Platform party members,
who supported pay raises, and more con
servative senators, who voted for lesser pay
raises.
Because of the great minority People's
Platform senators enjoy in next year's sen
ate, the proposed budget faces a good
chance of passing.
Discussion in the 1988-89 senate's final
meeting — the senate voted to dissolve
itself at the end of yesterday's meeting —
focused on the current and proposed
salaries of the COP members and senate
chair.
Senate Chair David Porter, a key author
of the proposed budget, said the disparity
in salary increases — most other salaries
were increased by five percent — was due
to a senate policy to keep COP and senate
