The Good Times
by Russell Baker
The long-awaited sequel
to Growing Up.
In this wonderful work of
autobiography, a man
writes in valedictory to his
striving and achieving
twenties and thirties and to
this nation's sunny years
under Truman, Eisenhower,
and Kennedy. That man is Russell Baker. He invites the
reader to share his pitfalls and triumphs, his joys and hard
lessons, from the mean and often homicidal streets of
Baltimore to coverage of the coronation of Queen
Elizabeth 11, and from watching Ike fishing to sharing the
wry and calculating secrets of LBJ. Morrow, $19.95
