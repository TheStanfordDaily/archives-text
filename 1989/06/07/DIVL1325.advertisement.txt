In the real world,
money is no object.

Unfortunately, in the academic world money can
be quite an object indeed - even with an investment
as important as a computer.
So, if you're student who can't wait to own a
Macintosh computer, and can't afford to pay for it all
at once, Apple presents the Student Loan-to-Own
Program.
It's a loan your parents can use to help you
acquire the Macintosh computer that best fits your
needs: Macintosh Plus, Macintosh SE, Macintosh
SE/30 or the Macintosh Ilex. And if you already own
a Macintosh, your parents can use the loan to equip
you with a Apple printer, hard disk, modem,
memory, or other peripherals.
Best of all, there are no appli-caiion fees, no
collateral required, and no need to prove financial
hardship.*
To get your Student Loan-to-Own application and
complete details stop by Stanford Bookstore s
Microdisc Center.
But we suggest you do it soon.
Because in the real world, opportunities like
don't come around very often.
