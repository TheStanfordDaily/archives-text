A Statement from the
Student Conduct Legislative Council
JUNE 1, 1989
During 1988-89, the Student Conduct Legislative Council (SCLC) has considered the application of the
Fundamental Standard of student conduct in the context of the diverse student community of today.
Recent campus incidents of racial harassment and homophobic behavior by students raised the question of
whether the Fundamental Standard speaks adequately to the need for an environment that is equally
hospitable to all students. In addressing this question, we studied the interaction between two core values of
the University: one's right to express opinions freely and one's right not to be subjected to acts of bigotry.
The SCLC offered two draft interpretations of the Fundamental Standard to the campus community for
comment. Reaction to the first was swift and largely negative. Letters, newspaper articles and electronic mail
suggested that the proposed interpretation was not adequately sensitive to the protection of free speech.
Several weeks later, a second draft was released which received significant support, but concerns were still
evident from those who felt it went too far and from those who felt it did not go far enough. The SCLC
wishes to thank those who provided extensive and thoughtful comments on all sides of the issue.
It is clear that the SCLC cannot resolve this issue before the end of the current academic year. More time is
needed. This year's Council recommends in the strongest terms that the 1989-90 SCLC continue the work
begun this year. The goal of improving the Stanford campus environment to make it respectful of human
diversity is too important to allow the momentum of this year to be lost.
SCLC members are:
FACULTY George Parker (Chair), Tom Kane, John Perry, Alan Schwettman, Kdward Solomon
STUDENTS Sam Kim, Eric Li, Janie Yen
EX-OFFICIO Canetta Ivy, David Porter, Sally Cole
