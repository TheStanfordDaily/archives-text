Four hard and sometimes pleasurable years
and you made it as a proud S rANFORD
ALUMNI. We are so very proud of you as
are the friends and family. Continue on your
main heading with the same dogged
determination of the past four years and
nothing will stop you.
We are in love with a wonderful daughter.
