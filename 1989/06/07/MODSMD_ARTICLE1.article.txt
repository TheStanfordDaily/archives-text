# Lyons says suspension unlikely
## Protesters involved in takeover may receive a 'lesser' punishment 
### John Warner Editorial staff 
Student protesters most likely will not be
suspended for their participation in the May
15 takeover of University President Donald
Kennedy's office, Dean of Student Affairs
James Lyons said yesterday.
Based on examination of two of the four
cases he plans to use in determining precedent
for punishments, Lyons said the 53 students
charged under the University Policy on
Campus Disruption are likely to be given "les
ser" punishments than suspension.
"Suspensions don't look likely based on the
cases I've read so far," Lyons said.
Punishments under the campus disruption
policy are based on past precedent and mitigat
ing circumstances. In the past, punishments
have ranged from a letter of reprimand to
expulsion.
Lyons also said yesterday it is unlikely that
any more students will be charged in addition
to the 53 who have already been notified.
Judicial Affairs Officer Sally Cole, the Uni
versity official responsible for issuing the dis
ruption charges, said she had set a 5 p.m.
deadline for charging additional students un
der the disruption policy.
Cole said she is still attempting to identify
some students who took part in the protest.
If the students cannot be identified by 5 p.m.
today, she said, they will not be charged.
According to Cole, charges may be amended
for some of the eight students who have been
charged for "especially egregious" violations
of the disruption policy. Any such amendments
will be made by 5 p.m. today as well, she said.
According to Lyons, the decision to lessen

some of the "especially egregious" violation
charges is probably a result of the adminis
tration's efforts to hasten the judicial process.
In an effort to complete as much of the
judicial process as possible by the end of the
year, some of the process has been "com
pressed," Lyons said.
"The Judicial Affairs officer didn't have the
usual amount of time to look into things," he
said.
Students charged under the campus disrup
tion policy have until 10 a.m. tomorrow to
determine if they wish to agree to the facts
presented in their charges and would like their
penalty to be determined by the dean of Stu
dent Affairs, or if they prefer to have their
case heard by the Stanford Judicial Council.
Students who opt for the first channel will
most likely have their cases resolved by the
end of the month, while the process for those
who go through the Judicial Council will not
begin until next fall, Lyons said.
Once cases are decided, unsatisfied students
can appeal to Kennedy for alterations.
The original deadline for determining which
judicial route students wanted to take was 10
a.m. today, but Lyons said he pushed it back
due to poor dissemination of information.
According to Ingrid Nava, a coalition mem
ber and incoming COP member, the coalition
will meet tonight to discuss which judicial
route members want to take.
According to a statement released yesterday
by the coalition, neither route is acceptable:
"We must either admit to their facts that the
eight students charged with 'especially
egregious' violations did in fact force and in
timidate the staff. Or we must wait until the
fall and go before the Stanford Judicial Coun

cil. This will mean graduating seniors will not
receive their diplomas, it will jeopardize stu
dents' fellowships and scholarships, and it will
cause all of us and our families to worry all
summer about the resolution of these
charges."
Coalition members have said they feel the
issuing of "especially egregious" charges is a
tactic to single-out coalition leaders and un
dermine the movement.
Students who wish to have his office assign
their penalty may sign up for hearing times
beginning at 9 a.m. today, Lyons said. By
choice of the student, hearings may take the
form of a meeting or a written statement, in
which the student presents whatever informa
tion the student believes may be relevant to
the dean's evaluations of the person's actions.
In addition to Asst. Dean of Student Affairs
Diana Conklin and himself, Lyons has desig
nated three faculty members to hear cases
and recommend punishments: Asst. Law
School Dean Sally Dickson, Law Prof. Thomas
Grey, and Assoc. Law School Dean Robert
Weisberg.
Students may choose which dean or dean
designate they would prefer to hear their case.
Lyons said the administration may also al
low students to have their cases heard in
groups if the students prefer.
If the four seniors being charged wish to
go through his office, their cases will probably
be resolved by Commencement, Lyons said,
but the process will be rushed.
Because suspension "is not a strong
likelihood" for any of the students, Lyons said,
seniors will probably have the opportunity to
at least walk through graduation.

suspended for their participation in the May
15 takeover of University President Donald
Kennedy's office, Dean of Student Affairs
James Lyons said yesterday.
Based on examination of two of the four
cases he plans to use in determining precedent
for punishments, Lyons said the 53 students
charged under the University Policy on
Campus Disruption are likely to be given "les
ser" punishments than suspension.
"Suspensions don't look likely based on the
cases I've read so far," Lyons said.
Punishments under the campus disruption
policy are based on past precedent and mitigat
ing circumstances. In the past, punishments
have ranged from a letter of reprimand to
expulsion.
Lyons also said yesterday it is unlikely that
any more students will be charged in addition
to the 53 who have already been notified.
Judicial Affairs Officer Sally Cole, the Uni
versity official responsible for issuing the dis
ruption charges, said she had set a 5 p.m.
deadline for charging additional students un
der the disruption policy.
Cole said she is still attempting to identify
some students who took part in the protest.
If the students cannot be identified by 5 p.m.
today, she said, they will not be charged.
According to Cole, charges may be amended
for some of the eight students who have been
charged for "especially egregious" violations
of the disruption policy. Any such amendments
will be made by 5 p.m. today as well, she said.
According to Lyons, the decision to lessen

some of the "especially egregious" violation
charges is probably a result of the adminis
tration's efforts to hasten the judicial process.
In an effort to complete as much of the
judicial process as possible by the end of the
year, some of the process has been "com
pressed," Lyons said.
"The Judicial Affairs officer didn't have the
usual amount of time to look into things," he
said.
Students charged under the campus disrup
tion policy have until 10 a.m. tomorrow to
determine if they wish to agree to the facts
presented in their charges and would like their
penalty to be determined by the dean of Stu
dent Affairs, or if they prefer to have their
case heard by the Stanford Judicial Council.
Students who opt for the first channel will
most likely have their cases resolved by the
end of the month, while the process for those
who go through the Judicial Council will not
begin until next fall, Lyons said.
Once cases are decided, unsatisfied students
can appeal to Kennedy for alterations.
The original deadline for determining which
judicial route students wanted to take was 10
a.m. today, but Lyons said he pushed it back
due to poor dissemination of information.
According to Ingrid Nava, a coalition mem
ber and incoming COP member, the coalition
will meet tonight to discuss which judicial
route members want to take.
According to a statement released yesterday
by the coalition, neither route is acceptable:
"We must either admit to their facts that the
eight students charged with 'especially
egregious' violations did in fact force and in
timidate the staff. Or we must wait until the
fall and go before the Stanford Judicial Coun

cil. This will mean graduating seniors will not
receive their diplomas, it will jeopardize stu
dents' fellowships and scholarships, and it will
cause all of us and our families to worry all
summer about the resolution of these
charges."
Coalition members have said they feel the
issuing of "especially egregious" charges is a
tactic to single-out coalition leaders and un
dermine the movement.
Students who wish to have his office assign
their penalty may sign up for hearing times
beginning at 9 a.m. today, Lyons said. By
choice of the student, hearings may take the
form of a meeting or a written statement, in
which the student presents whatever informa
tion the student believes may be relevant to
the dean's evaluations of the person's actions.
In addition to Asst. Dean of Student Affairs
Diana Conklin and himself, Lyons has desig
nated three faculty members to hear cases
and recommend punishments: Asst. Law
School Dean Sally Dickson, Law Prof. Thomas
Grey, and Assoc. Law School Dean Robert
Weisberg.
Students may choose which dean or dean
designate they would prefer to hear their case.
Lyons said the administration may also al
low students to have their cases heard in
groups if the students prefer.
If the four seniors being charged wish to
go through his office, their cases will probably
be resolved by Commencement, Lyons said,
but the process will be rushed.
Because suspension "is not a strong
likelihood" for any of the students, Lyons said,
seniors will probably have the opportunity to
at least walk through graduation.
