## Some Chinese troops evacuate city center, still firing 
### 
BEIJING (AP) — Thousands of the
troops responsible for the violent crack
down on the movement for freedom
evacuated the city center today, spraying
gunfire as they passed Chinese and dip
lomatic residential areas.
Most of the troops from the 27th
Army, riding in a convoy of hundreds
of trucks and support vehicles, appeared
to be shooting into the air, although
some were seen aiming at an apartment
complex where hundreds of diplomats
and other foreigners live.
Some of the troops were crouched low
and others were behind boards, appar
ently seeking cover from possible return
fire. Rival military factions are reported
stationed inside the city and on the
outskirts.
The troops chanted, "Down with cor
ruption, we love the people, we love the
capital, we love youth, long live the
Communist Party," as they left their
positions in Tiananmen Square, the
symbolic center of China.
People along the sidewalks initially
cheered when they heard the chanting,
but one office worker said, "They can
sing any slogan they want but then they
start shooting."
Other troops and tanks of the 27th
Army remained in and around Tianan
men Square. It was not known if the
army was conducting a complete evacua
tion.
It was the 27th that drove pro
democracy demonstrators from the cen

Soldiers continued firing into crowds
around Beijing yesterday and early
today. Witnesses said a small boy was
killed and a girl wounded in the head
yesterday. Police in riot gear cruised

Fitzwater said the United States has
been in contact with midlevel Chinese
officials but failed to contact top-level

officials. "It's like the place is closed
down," he said. "There's no indication
who the leadership is."
Yesterday, in the first appearance of
a top official since the crackdown began,
government spokesman Yuan Mu said
China is "not afraid" of the universal
condemnation that greeted its action
against the pro-democracy campaign.

injured and 400 soldiers were missing.
