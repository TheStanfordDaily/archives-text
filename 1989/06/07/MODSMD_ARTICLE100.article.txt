# Snuffed out as fireman, sizzles as starter
## 
### Robert "Port" Portnoy 
Steve Chitren finished second
on the baseball team in victories
behind Brian Keyser. The senior
reliever notched six wins against
four defeats. In just 89 innings
of work, Chitren struck out 94
while walking but 39.
Chitren's 3.94 ERA was tops on
the club among pitchers who were
healthy all season. (Mike Mus
sina's was 3.55 in innings.)
Chitren finished with one com
plete game and had a pair of saves
before becoming a starter.
While Chitren's second-half
starts were crucial to Stanford's
furious charge, earlier this season
he displayed the form out of the
bullpen that will be etched in the
minds of Cardinal baseball fans
for years to come.
For three years running,
Chitren has been the ultimate
fireman — putting out nearly
every blaze he encountered, even
dousing a few he started himself.
In an April 14 appearence at
USC, Chitren relieved Spencer in
a 4-4 ballgame. USC loaded the
bases with nobody out. "Chit," as
his teammates like to call him,
bore down to get two huge strike
outs, retired the side, and Stan
ford prevailed in the ninth.
"I just seem to concentrate
more with guys on base. That's
something I need to work on,
maintaining that level of concen-

Moving from bullpen stopper to successful starter, Steve Chitren
helped the Cardinal make its charge at the end of the season.
tratiOn, if I want to move on (to
pro ball)," Chitren said.
"When we played Miami last
year (at the College World Series),
he had guys all over the place. In
the short span he was in there,
he had five or six walks," Dunton
said.
But "Houdini" again escaped
unscathed, just as he did in the
final game of each of the Cardi
nal's two title years.
"Even if he doesn't (make it to
the pros), he's done something
nobody else has ever done —
pitched the final out in two con
secutive College World Series,"
Dunton said.
Dunton isn't kidding. You know
this great sports image: The final
out is made, the pitcher turns to
greet his onrushing catcher who
hoists him high in the air, crown
ing their team the new champion.
Imagine being that pitcher, twice.
"There's some kind of fate or
destiny that's followed me in my
career here. I'm hoping it contin
ues. But I don't sit in the dugout
between innings and sing hymns,"
Chitren quipped.
In his stint on the Farm,
Chitren flourished in the role of
"closer," the most nerve-racking,
mind-numbing, pressure-filled job
a hurler can have. When a tempest
hits in the late innings, Chitren
is asked to calm the storm.
"He's extremely competitive.
He thrives on that situation
where you either do it or you
don't," Dunton said.
"I've liked relieving because

I've had so much success doing
it. My first couple starts here I
wasn't prepared and got knocked
around," Chitren said. "Now it
doesn't really matter to me. I like
coming in with the game on the
line, but when you're starting
you're in control of the game."
Selected in the ninth round of
last year's msgor league draft,
Chitren decided he was not yet
ready to take the next step.
"1 wasn't sure where I was con
cerning baseball and I wanted to
finish school. With that out of the
way, I'll be able to concectrate on
pro ball," Chitren said.
Chitren will get his wish, as the
Oakland A's made him their sixth
round selection in this month's
draft.
Once settled in the A's farm
system, Chitren's ability to re
spond under pressure will be
tested every time he takes the
mound. He has given no indica
tion he wo i't be able to handle it.
