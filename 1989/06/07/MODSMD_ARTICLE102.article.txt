# Senior meets final deadline by a hair
## 
### 
I thought Orel Hershiser was
really cute even before his
career skyrocketed. Actually,
I'm still probably the only one
who thinks he's really cute.
"Lynnie," my mom interjected
between bites of hamburger soup
two years ago, "if I had one wish,
just one wish, do you know what
it would be?" She had singled me
out in front of the rest of my
sisters, so I knew the wish in
volved only me.
"I'm sure I couldn't guess," I
responded cooly. She's looking at
my hair. It has something to do
with my hair, I thought. She's
mad because I blew it dry.
She had just given me my an
nual permanent. "Just a little curl
to give it some lift," she always
said. For some reason, when she
said this I envisioned myself with
30ft, luxurious waves — waves of
a sultry starlet, like Jean Harlow
or Kelly McGillis.
I don't know why I thought this.
I've never even come close to
looking like Jean Harlow. Gene
Wilder, yes. Jean Harlow, never.
And so, every year I spent hours
blow-drying and clipping back and
spraying my newly-permed hair,
much to my mother's chagrin, in
a frantic attempt at creating some
semblance of order out of the Top
Ramen which rested on my skull.
I knew my mom wanted me to
let my hair dry naturally. But for
that to be her one greatest wish
in the world ... no. It had to be
something more profound. I had
to have violated a greater crime
to provoke such a question.
My sense of fashion would prob-

ably do it. I've never been a tradi
tional dresser. I've always
preferred 75-cent thongs to
Espadrilles and cut-off sweats to
Esprit shorts. At my high school
senior prom, I sported a dress
which I had purchased at the
Salvation Army for $9.95 (a deal
at twice the price!).
In college, I found comparable
bargains at local Peninsula thrift
stores — a fishing vest for $1.98,
a gas station shirt bearing the
name "Ron" for a low $2.50, and
my favorite fashion accessory, a
beautiful pair of bowling shoes,
compliments of Camino Bowl (of
course I had to trade in a 37Vfc
cent thong).
My mom has never come right
out and said anything about my
apparel. She often buys me
clothes. Her most blatant hint oc
curred two years ago when I found
a bag of old clothes, which I had
instructed her to give to Goodwill,
on the front porch with a tag. It
simply read, "For retarded
children."

At least she's never complained
th*t I spend too much money on
clothes. Then again, I've never
been an overly thrifty person, and
as I sat across from my mom (who,
oy this point in the article, was
frozen, Bewitched style, spoon in
hand), pondering her wish for me,
I began to think that it had some
thing to do with money. Specifi
cally, with the money I had been
spending.
Money has always been an issue
with my mom. My sisters and 1
never ordered large drinks at
McDonald's, and we always split
the fries. On those occasions when
we dined at expensive establish
ments (any place with cloth nap
kins), my mom would quickly scan
the menu and then suggest,
"Girls, the chicken looks good."
I admit, she had good foresight.
Years of extra fries and prime rib
might have kept us from attend
ing Stanford. Of course my par
ents were proud to send four
daughters to Stanford, and they
justified spending their life
savings by considering it an in
vestment. Naturally, there's a
catch to that.
She wants me to make a prac
tical decision about my future, I
thought. At the time, I was taking
acting classes, and I'm sure vi
sions of her third daughter in a
pink-and-orange polyester knit
dress serving up grand slam
breakfasts kept her awake at
night. Once she asked me what
"all of these writing and acting
classes" were going to do for me.
"Stanford's not necessarily a

vocational school," I replied.
"For people like us it is," she
retorted. She always had an an
swer.
"If I could have one wish," she
continued, "just one wish, it
would be to open up The Stanford
Daily and see an article written
by you."
I know you never really ex
pected your wish to come true,
Mom. I'm a dreamer, and my
mistake is that I talk as big as I
dream and so I end up sounding
insincere. But I wanted to make
this one dream of yours come
true, Mom, so that you never stop
dreaming. I want to thank you
and Dad for making my biggest
dream come true. I know we both
wish that Dad could be here on
Sunday to see me graduate, but
I think if we both believe, he'll
be there with us, somewhere. I
love you, Mom.

happy to play fairy godmother to
her. Lynn: If the glass slipper fits
— wear it. Even if Mom thinks
you look better in the red pumps.
