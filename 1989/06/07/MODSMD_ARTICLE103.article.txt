# Sweet send-off: Stanford seniors succeed swimmingly
## 
### C.S. Crader 
A funny thing about sports is
that only one team can win. Two
hundred ninety-four Division I
college basketball teams play to
crown one national champion.
Twenty-six mcyor league baseball
teams play for one World Series
title. And so on.
Of all the athletes competing
on various levels throughout the
world, only a few go out on top.
Dana Anderson, Aimee Berzins,
Michelle Donahue, Jenna Johnson
and Susan Lenth did.
Those five, all seniors, closed
out their collegiate careers by
leading Stanford to victory at the
1989 NCAA Women's Swimming
and Diving Championships in
March in Indianapolis, Ind. It was
the Cardinal's first title in the
sport since 1983 and, for the five
seniors competing, well worth the
four years of work.
After coming in with a recruit
ing class numbering well into
double figures, only seven seniors
remained at the beginning of this
year. Jenny Shannon badly cut a
finger before the Pacific 10 Con
ference Championships in Febru
ary and was thus unable to com
pete at the NCAA meet. A back
injury kept Bethanne Lambert
from competing the final two
months of the season but she has
one year of eligibility remaining
due to redshirting her freshman
year.
"We're the survivors," Berzins
said. "It's been frustrating to see
my friends have to stop, because
of injuries or other things. ... I
think we all have something very
special now in common to hang
on to. To end with the champion
ship makes it satisfying to say we
stuck it out and hung with it —
and we did it."

Coach Richard Quick, who came
to Stanford in October after
coaching Texas to the last five
NCAA titles, feels this year's Car
dinal squad may not have been
the most talented team around,
but when the chips were down,
they came through. The biggest
part of that, he feels, is the close
ness of the team, exemplified by
the seniors.
"I don't think there's a team
that can be successful without
outstanding senior leadership," he
said. "I really admire this group
because they really handled the
coaching change and they really
handled their senior year, which
is the last page in a chapter of
their life. I really admire that
commitment on their part."
Of the five seniors, Johnson was
perhaps the most valuable in the
pool, winning six individual
NCAA titles in her four years,
second on the Stanford women's
all-time list to Marybeth
(Linzmeier) Dorst's eight.
Johnson was also a key relay
swimmer and served as co-captain
this season.
"Jenna Johnson has been a
mainstay, just a tremendous
swimmer at Stanford, all four
years," Quick said.
"Jenna Johnson has been the
cornerstone of the Stanford team.
She swims three great individual
events and four tremendous relays
in every NCAA meet. She's called
on in every dual meet, in every
NCAA meet... and she responds
every time. Jenna will be ranked
with all the great swimmers in
Stanford history."
And out of the pool, Johnson
lived up to the standard she set
in the water. "She's so caring,"
Anderson said. "She's got time for
anyone. She's a great person and
a great swimmer."

Berzins was another key cog of
four Stanford relays, and one of
the Cardinal's top point-scorers
every year.
"Aimee Berzins will always be
real special to me," Quick said.
"Her senior year, she had the best
year of her swimming career. I
just have extreme admiration for
Aimee."
Donahue was also a top scorer
for the Cardinal in the backstroke
all four years.
"Michelle Donahue is one of the
hardest-working and nicest girls
I've ever worked with," Quick
said. "Her quiet, solid leadership
will be sorely missed but at the
same time will be a standard for
others for a long time.
"Susan Lenth again had the
best year of her swimming
career," Quick continued. "She
did a lot more in and out of the
pool to lead this team to vic
tory. .. . Her swimming will be
missed but her character will be
missed more.
"Dana Anderson probably had
one of the toughest assignments
because her swimming was not
going as well as it had. But she
. . . was able to put her individual
results behind her and support
the team. I'll admire her for not
once bringing other people down
in any way."
Quick's special feelings toward
this class are shared by the swim
mers themselves.
"We have a bond that is so
close," Anderson said. "We came
in with a class of 15 and there
were only five of us left. ... I feel
so close to all of them.
"When I first came here I
couldn't believe a team could care
so much. . . . Everyone is so sup
portive. Everyone cares for you
out of the pool.
"It was probably my toughest

yet most rewarding year.... It
was definitely worth it. I'm so
glad I stuck it out."
Anderson, who, like Berzins and
Lenth, has retired from competi
tive swimming, is already looking
forward to the first reunion. "I
can't wait for that," she said,
"when you can really enjoy spend
ing time with them not as a swim
mer but as a person."
Lenth feels the same closeness.
"I'll have to admit it was probably
the best year of my career," she
said, "not just because we won,
but because of all the people. This
is the closest I've been to a team
in 11 years (of swimming).
"I'll remember being a captain

as the highlight of my swimming
career. It's a real honor for me to
be the leader of that type of
group."
The others will also have many
fond memories: cheering at the
top of their lungs after winning
the title, Quick, Asst. Coach Mike
Chasson, graduate Asst. Stacy
Shupe, former Coach George
Haines.
"I'm not going to miss the 6
a.m. workouts," Anderson said;
"I'm not going to miss the
stadiums. It's going to be being
with the people I'm closest to
here."
The five came to Stanford in
1985 with dreams of winning a

national title someday. They al
most got their wish as sopho
mores, coming up a scant 17
points short.
"Sophomore year we just did
phenomenally well and surprised
ourselves," Berzins said. The fol
lowing year, however, the team
finished a disappointing third.
"After last year, having the
tools and the potential, it came
together this year," Berzins said.
"I think each year our desire grew
stronger. I think it accumulated
and finally this year it was re
leased.
"I guess not many people say
they've been able to achieve their
goals."

NCAA titles in her four years,
second on the Stanford women's
all-time list to Marybeth
(Linzmeier) Dorst's eight.
Johnson was also a key relay
swimmer and served as co-captain
this season.
"Jenna Johnson has been a
mainstay, just a tremendous
swimmer at Stanford, all four
years," Quick said.
"Jenna Johnson has been the
cornerstone of the Stanford team.
She swims three great individual
events and four tremendous relays
in every NCAA meet. She's called
on in every dual meet, in every
NCAA meet... and she responds
every time. Jenna will be ranked
with all the great swimmers in
Stanford history."
And out of the pool, Johnson
lived up to the standard she set
in the water. "She's so caring,"
Anderson said. "She's got time for
anyone. She's a great person and
a great swimmer."

Berzins was another key cog of
four Stanford relays, and one of
the Cardinal's top point-scorers
every year.
"Aimee Berzins will always be
real special to me," Quick said.
"Her senior year, she had the best
year of her swimming career. I
just have extreme admiration for
Aimee."
Donahue was also a top scorer
for the Cardinal in the backstroke
all four years.
"Michelle Donahue is one of the
hardest-working and nicest girls
I've ever worked with," Quick
said. "Her quiet, solid leadership
will be sorely missed but at the
same time will be a standard for
others for a long time.
"Susan Lenth again had the
best year of her swimming
career," Quick continued. "She
did a lot more in and out of the
pool to lead this team to vic
tory. .. . Her swimming will be
missed but her character will be
missed more.
"Dana Anderson probably had
one of the toughest assignments
because her swimming was not
going as well as it had. But she
. . . was able to put her individual
results behind her and support
the team. I'll admire her for not
once bringing other people down
in any way."
Quick's special feelings toward
this class are shared by the swim
mers themselves.
"We have a bond that is so
close," Anderson said. "We came
in with a class of 15 and there
were only five of us left. ... I feel
so close to all of them.
"When I first came here I
couldn't believe a team could care
so much. . . . Everyone is so sup
portive. Everyone cares for you
out of the pool.
"It was probably my toughest

yet most rewarding year.... It
was definitely worth it. I'm so
glad I stuck it out."
Anderson, who, like Berzins and
Lenth, has retired from competi
tive swimming, is already looking
forward to the first reunion. "I
can't wait for that," she said,
"when you can really enjoy spend
ing time with them not as a swim
mer but as a person."
Lenth feels the same closeness.
"I'll have to admit it was probably
the best year of my career," she
said, "not just because we won,
but because of all the people. This
is the closest I've been to a team
in 11 years (of swimming).
"I'll remember being a captain

as the highlight of my swimming
career. It's a real honor for me to
be the leader of that type of
group."
The others will also have many
fond memories: cheering at the
top of their lungs after winning
the title, Quick, Asst. Coach Mike
Chasson, graduate Asst. Stacy
Shupe, former Coach George
Haines.
"I'm not going to miss the 6
a.m. workouts," Anderson said;
"I'm not going to miss the
stadiums. It's going to be being
with the people I'm closest to
here."
The five came to Stanford in
1985 with dreams of winning a

national title someday. They al
most got their wish as sopho
mores, coming up a scant 17
points short.
"Sophomore year we just did
phenomenally well and surprised
ourselves," Berzins said. The fol
lowing year, however, the team
finished a disappointing third.
"After last year, having the
tools and the potential, it came
together this year," Berzins said.
"I think each year our desire grew
stronger. I think it accumulated
and finally this year it was re
leased.
"I guess not many people say
they've been able to achieve their
goals."

The senior class of the Stanford's women's swim team (from left, Dana Anderson, Aimee Berzins,
Michelle Donohue, Jenna Johnson, Susan Lenth and Jenny Shannon) takes a bow. The Cardinal won
the national championship this year in Indianapolis, Ind.
A funny thing about sports is
that only one team can win. Two
hundred ninety-four Division I
college basketball teams play to
crown one national champion.
Twenty-six mcyor league baseball
teams play for one World Series
title. And so on.
Of all the athletes competing
on various levels throughout the
world, only a few go out on top.
Dana Anderson, Aimee Berzins,
Michelle Donahue, Jenna Johnson
and Susan Lenth did.
Those five, all seniors, closed
out their collegiate careers by
leading Stanford to victory at the
1989 NCAA Women's Swimming
and Diving Championships in
March in Indianapolis, Ind. It was
the Cardinal's first title in the
sport since 1983 and, for the five
seniors competing, well worth the
four years of work.
After coming in with a recruit
ing class numbering well into
double figures, only seven seniors
remained at the beginning of this
year. Jenny Shannon badly cut a
finger before the Pacific 10 Con
ference Championships in Febru
ary and was thus unable to com
pete at the NCAA meet. A back
injury kept Bethanne Lambert
from competing the final two
months of the season but she has
one year of eligibility remaining
due to redshirting her freshman
year.
"We're the survivors," Berzins
said. "It's been frustrating to see
my friends have to stop, because
of injuries or other things. ... I
think we all have something very
special now in common to hang
on to. To end with the champion
ship makes it satisfying to say we
stuck it out and hung with it —
and we did it."

Coach Richard Quick, who came
to Stanford in October after
coaching Texas to the last five
NCAA titles, feels this year's Car
dinal squad may not have been
the most talented team around,
but when the chips were down,
they came through. The biggest
part of that, he feels, is the close
ness of the team, exemplified by
the seniors.
"I don't think there's a team
that can be successful without
outstanding senior leadership," he
said. "I really admire this group
because they really handled the
coaching change and they really
handled their senior year, which
is the last page in a chapter of
their life. I really admire that
commitment on their part."
Of the five seniors, Johnson was
perhaps the most valuable in the
pool, winning six individual
NCAA titles in her four years,
