# Solidarity won't form coalition
## 
### 
WARSAW, Poland (AP) - The
Communist government,
demoralized by its crushing elec
tion defeat, again urged victorious
Solidarity yesterday to join a
governing coalition — a proposal
the union has turned down.
"It is time for a broad post
election coalition, a kind of pact
for economic reforms and democ
racy," government spokesman
Zbyslaw Rykowski told a news
conference. A Communist Party
spokesman said Monday that
Solidarity should show "co
responsibility for the country."
Politburo member Marian Or
zechowski later told Polish radio,

"The voters' verdict shows all po
litical forces, that is my (Commu
nist) Party, other coalition par
ties, groups and Solidarity must
undertake responsibility for
Poland's future."
But Solidarity leader Lech
Walesa said earlier: "We did not
fight for chairs (in the Cabinet)
for ourselves. We fought for a dif
ferent system of wielding power
in this country."
In Sunday's election, the inde
pendent union movement won an
overwhelming majority in the new
100-member Senate and virtually
all of the 161 seats available to
the opposition in the 460-seat

Sejm, the existing lower house.
But the most bitter defeat dealt
to the Communists was with the
"national list." That list had 35
top party and government leaders
running unopposed for the Sejm,
but the candidates had to receive
a least 50 percent of the vote.
It appeared that many ranking
officials on the list, including
Prime Minister Mieczyslaw
Rakowski, would not receive 50
percent.
The victorious union said ear
lier that the Communists and
their allies could have all of the
299 Sejm seats allotted to them
under the April agreement.
