TEHRAN, Iran (AP) - Ayatol
lah Ruhollah Khomeini was
buried yesterday after a day of
tumult in which frenzied mourn
ers snatched the shroud from
their revered leader's body and
tore it to shreds for holy relics.
Thousands of Revolutionary
Guards and civilians jostled
around the grave at the Baheshte
Zahra cemetery, raising clouds of
dust, as Khomeini's body was fi
nally laid to rest at 4:45 p.m.
A television announcer, his
voice hoarse with emotion,

chanted "Father, don't leave your
children! Oh father don't leave
your beloved!" as the crowd
surged toward the grave. People
wept and beat their heads and
chests with clenched fists in the
Shiite Moslem expression of
bereavement.
Soldiers passed concrete slabs
over the sea of mourners and laud
them across the grave, a shallow
pit in a 100-square-yard section
of the vast cemetery where men
who died in the Islamic revolution
and the 8-year war with Iraq are

buried.
A crane lowered a metal freight
container onto the grave to
prevent people from grabbing
handfuls of dirt from it and pos
sibly unearthing the body.
Earlier in the day, mourners
blocked the path of a van carrying
the body in an open coffin from
the square where it had lain.
Mourners scrambling for
mementos grabbed the tightly
wrapped white shroud in which
Moslems are buried and tore it
to shreds.
