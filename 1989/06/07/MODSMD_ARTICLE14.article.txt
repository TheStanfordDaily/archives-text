House picks Foley as new speaker
WASHINGTON (AP) - The House of Repre
sentatives elevated Thomas Foley of Washington
to be the 49th speaker in its history yesterday,
and he immediately appealed to both parties to
"put away bitterness" after months of turmoil
that led to the forced resignation of Speaker Jim
Wright.
Foley promised to help return tranquility to a
House that has been ripped by charges and
counter-charges of ethical impropriety, and to put
ethics reform on his list of priorities for the year.
"I am a proud Democrat," Foley declared to
the full House after he was elected and sworn
in. He appealed to Republicans as well as his

own party to "come together and put away bit
terness and division and hostility."

to drive the British out of Northern Ireland,
claimed responsibility in telephone warnings to
local businesses, police said.
