# The 						Year in Review:
## 
### 
FROM THE FIRST MONTH of the school year until the final
weeks, the local and national media turned their critical
eyes to Stanford. Racial incidents, First Amendment rights,
workers unionizing and student arrests made the front page of
newspapers and appeared on televison news broadcasts across
the country.
Through it all, the Stanford community was challenged to debate
the issues and personalities affecting the intriguing, beguiling and
sometimes vexing campus events.
What follows is a summary of the big news stories of the year
that helped keep such debate alive and well.

Sunday
UJAMAA INCIDENT
Just two weeks into the school
year, racial tensions ignited after
two white freshmen admitted to
posting a racially offensive flier
near the door of a black student
living in Ujamaa House.
Residents of the black theme
house, where the flier was posted,
and members of the black com
munity were shocked and
traumatized after an emotional
house meeting when the freshmen
admitted to defacing a poster by
drawing a crude caricature depict
ing Beethoven as a black man with
wild hair, big lips and red, crazed
eyes.
The freshmen were immedi
ately removed to a guest house in
Florence Moore Hall and contin

ued to live there through winter
quarter because of a later suspen
sion from University housing.
The word "Niggers" was
scrawled across a second poster
advertising a black fraternity
party at UC-Berkeley, but the two
freshmen deny responsibility for
this poster.
A backlash of events erupted
following reports of the first racial
incident, including threats to the
freshmen and other non-black res
idents in Ujamaa, the defacing of
the non-black pictures on the
house picture board, and the pos
ting of anti-white bumper stickers
around campus. It is still un
known who is responsible for
these acts.
Based on free speech rights
protected under the First Am
mendment, the University did not
charge the two freshmen with a
Fundamental Standard violation.
The incident still plagues the

Stanford community, however, as
many question the applications of
the Fundamental Standard to of
fensive acts and expression.
Sunday
USW CONTRACT SIGNED
Threats of a campuswide
workers' strike were quelled after
three months of negotiations
when the United Stanford
Workers and the University
reached a contract agreement by
the skin of their teeth, less than
12 hours before the contract dead
line.
The next day, employees of the
USW, who had been working with
out a contract for two months,
overwhelmingly ratified the con
tract agreement which provided a

three-year wage increase, a full
pension plan after five years of
employment, increased medical
supplements and stand-by pay for
time on call.
The settlement ended a 96-day
ordeal of tense and rocky negoti
ations during which both sides
called foul play and a federal
mediator had to be called in to
keep negotiations from ending.
More than 400 workers and stu
dent supporters marched all over
campus on Oct. 5, demanding the
University to recognize their call
for a "just labor contract."

While most students were un
aware of the negotiations, some
members of the ASSU Senate,
Council of Presidents and minor
ity student groups actively cam
paigned to show their support for
the workers plight to gain a con
tract. Three students participated
in the contract negotiations as
"neutral observers" for the USW.
Tuesday
EXODUS TO WASHINGTON
With the election of George
Bush as the 41st president, three
Stanford professors would soon
follow him to Washington, D.C.
to serve in his adminstration.
After months of rumor and
speculation, Economics Prof. Mi
chael Boskin was appointed in the
first week of December to chair
Bush's chief economic policy
group, the Council of Economic
Advisers. Self-described as a
"mainstream conservative," Bos
kin, a 43-year-old senior fellow at
the Hoover Institution, advised
Bush during his presidential cam
paign and his appointment came
as no surprise for his colleagues.
In late January, Political Sci
ence Assoc. Prof. Condoleezza
Rice joined the Bush administra
tion as the National Security
Council's Soviet and East Euro
pean specialist. As a well
recognized expert in Soviet and
East European military policy,
Rice, 34, was offered her choice
of two positions but chose the
NSC position over a State Depart
ment post because she preferred
the small, intimate structure of
the NSC.
At the end of March, Economics
Prof. John Taylor was appointed
to serve on the three-member
Council of Economic Advisers
alongside Boskin. Taylor said he
thought he would make his
greatest contributions in macro
economic policy, dealing with the
Federal Reserve, coping with the
Savings and Loan crisis and for
mulating policy on Third World
debt.

Monday
DRELL QUITS ARMS CENTER
When world-renowned arms
control expert and physicist Sid
ney Drell announced he would
resign from his post as co
director, Stanford's Center for In
ternational Security and Arms
Control was left floundering.
Drell left his position at the
arms control center after years of
frustration trying to convince the
University to give the center the
power to make its own profes
sorial appointments.
Drell's resignation sparked the
announcements that physicist Ted
Postol and former astronaut Sally
Ride would leave. Even Political
Science Prof. John Lewis, the cen
ter's other co-director, thought
about leaving the center he helped
establish but said he now plans
to stay.
The research center, recognized
as one of the world's finest for
the study of arms control, was
left in severe jeopardy with the
loss of these three key research
ers. Many of its financial
supporters threatened to with
draw research grants unless the
University restored the pre
eminence of the center.
William Perry, undersecretary
of defense for research and engi
neering in the Carter administra
tion, will take the helm of the
center with Lewis when Drell of
ficially leaves his position in Au
gust.
Perry's technical background
and experience in arms control
have been lauded by arms control
experts who believe he can help
save the center from crumbling.
As yet, the University has said
it will not change its appointment
policy.
