### 
tation, the University community
grappled with a decision of where
it draws the line when free speech
conflicts with the rights of others.
The 12-member council went to
work on the 83-year-old supreme
code of conduct at the end of Feb
ruary, just weeks after Judicial
Affairs Officer Sally Cole decided
not to charge two freshmen for
drawing a racially offensive poster
with a Standard violation.
Cole's decision surprised and
angered many at the University)
and served as a driving force be
hind the council's desire to make
the Standard more clear-cut, so
as to explicitly make racially of
fensive acts a violation.
Before the SCLC came out with
its first proposed interpretation,
the Committee for First Amend
ment Rights formed in opposition
to what they feared might be an
interpretation that was too
restrictive of free speech.
Although the SCLC will not
devise a finalized proposal by the
end of this school year, the two
proposals it formulated generated
a considerable amount to ponder
over the summer.
Their first proposal stated that
students may maintain any
opinions they want so long as they
did not personally abuse individ
uals with "obscenities, epithets
and other forms of expression that
by accepted commumity stand
ards degrade, victimize, stig
matize or perjoratively charac
terize them on the basis of per
sonal, cultural or intellectual di
versity."
Then, influenced by the com
munity's nearly unanimous rejec
tion of the first proposal, the
SCLC went back to the drawing
board and came up with its second
offering, which adheres more
closely to current judicial inter
pretation of the First Amendment.
For example, to be a Funda
mental Standard violation, the ex
pression must be "intended to in
sult or stigmatize an individual
or small number of individuals"
on the basis of sex, race, color,
handicap, religion, sexual orienta
tion, or national and ethnic origin.
The faculty membership of next
year's SCLC is still in question,
as is the focus and direction of

any debate on the Standard, but
having set such a precedent this
year, the formerly obscure council
may very well be at the center of
debate once again.

MINORITY ISSUES REPORT
The long-awaited, thorough
report by the University Com
mitte on Minority Issues —
charted to relieve the underlying,
subtle racial tensions at Stanford
— is released. But severe
shortages of funds coupled with
other bureaucratic setbacks are
forcing a cautious implementation
of the report's recommendations.
Some of the major recommen
dations are:
• Hiring 30 new minority fac
ulty over the next 10 years;
• Doubling the number of mi
nority Ph.D. graduates within the
next eight years;
• Instituting a new University
Distribution Requirement for the
study of U.S. minority groups.
University President Donald
Kennedy made his first public re
marks on the report almost three
weeks ago and accepted its rec
ommendations with reservations.
Other department officials cited
the universal excuse for not being
able to quickly move on the rec
ommendations: lack of money.
The necessary funds, according to
University administrators, have
to be built into departmental op
erating budgets.
After reading the report, many
minority students, already anx
ious for change, heard the Uni
versity response and saw that the
report is far from a do-all, end-all
cure. They said after Kennedy's
address that they were dis
enchanted with his lack of
specifics concerning implementa
tion.
And so, not close enough to
many minority students' demands
nor to the funding that adminis
trators say is necessary to bring
about some big changes, a tem

porary UCMI Task Force has just
handed over to Assoc. Dean of
Graduate Studies Cecilia Burciaga
the charge of implementing the
report's more than 100
recomendations.

WEBB WORKERS UNIONIZE
From a quiet, 250-acre
vegetable and berry farm on Uni
versity land emerged a classic saga
of labor versus management, cul
minating in a vote to unionize
and laborer's hopes to finally lead
a better life.
On one side was the United
Stanford Workers, a union repre
senting more than 1,000 technical
and service workers on campus,
at the Stanford Medical Center
and the Stanford Linear Ac
celerator Center. Gathering sup
port through media-grabbing ef
forts, the USW eventually suc
ceeding in adding the more than
50 resident laborers on Webb
Ranch to their membership list.
On the other side were Stanford
and Webb Ranch management
who kept busy trying to fight off
the label of exploitation. The Uni
versity, which owns the land,
maintained that it was not re
sponsible for overseeing the living
and working conditions of the
ranch, but that it would look into
any reports of health violations.
Meanwhile, Webb Ranch manag
ers spent most of their time steer
ing clear of the media, except for
an occasional comment saying
they ran a safe place to live and
work.
Claiming in February that the
University was not sympathetic
to its case, the USW went to the
state Agriculture Labor Relations
Board, attempting to bring about
elections for the laborers.
Following failed negotiations
and a mysterious fire on the ranch
in the home of the director, ranch
workers voted to unionize. Two
weeks later the state recognized
the USW as the workers' repre
sentatives.

COLD FUSION
Stanford Materials Science
Prof. Robert Huggins found heat
coming from his picnic cooler cold
fusion experiment in what was the
first controlled cold fusion exper
iment ever.
After the dubious results found
by two Utah electrochemists, who
claimed they had found fusion at
room temperature, the Stanford
discovery electrified scientists.
The March 23 Utah discovery
meant big bucks if they were right
and big embarrassment if they
were wrong.
Chemists cheered for their col
leagues at Utah; physicists just
spat at them.
Huggins had measured heat
from a palladium electrode soaked
in "heavy water," water composed
of deuterium instead of hydrogen.
Huggins found no heat from pal
ladium soaked in ordinary tap
water. Huggins did not claim he
had found cold fusion, but he ex
plained that the control experi
ment proved it was not just "weird
chemistry."
Not so, said Physics Prof. Wal
ter Meyerhof. Meyerhof said Hug
gins had made some crucial mis
takes in his calorimetry, the mea
sure of heat. Also, Meyerhof said
that another effect, known as
"overvoltage," was making Hug
gins see things.
1 did not see things, Huggins
said emphatically. The debate con
tinued for a while. Did too. Did
not. Did too. Did not.
The verdict is still out on what
Huggins was actually seeing.
Tuesday
COMPUTERIZED VOTING
Armed with computer smarts
and political savvy, a pair of soph
omores not only helped to speed
up the infamously slow ballot
counting of past ASSU general
elections, their computerized

voting system provided what may
be a glimpse of what is to come
in future government polling.
Using Macintosh computers by
Apple Computer Inc., a record
number of students sat and used
a "mouse" to mark their choice
for the Council of Presidents race,
along with all the other ASSU
positions and fee requests.
But students were not the only
ones watching the computer
screens.
Attracted by the novelty of the
largest completely computerized
voting system in the nation,
several state and local voting of
ficials came out to see what the
high-tech balloting was all about.
Like the majority of student
voters who took part, the officials
went away impressed, noting only
a few glitches with the system.
They also said this futuristic
voting process is a little too novel
and is going to remain a part of
the future — for now at least.
For all the accolades and smiles
surrounding Stanford's computer
ized voting, it was not greeted
with open arms when first pro
posed by Elections Commissioner
Steve Krauss to the ASSU senate
in February.
Fearing a computer "crash" and
arguing that there were not
enough planned polling sites
around campus, graduate
senators rejected Krauss' voting
proposal.
Bat this was Krauss' "baby."
Lobbying hard and altering his
proposal, Krauss assuaged the
graduate senator's fears and won
a unanimous second senate vote.
Monday
STUDENTS OCCUPY OFFICE
Police in riot gear arrested more
than 50 students after protesters
took over University President
Donald Kennedy's office and bar
ricaded all entrances for almost
eight hours, demanding an imme
diate face-to-face meeting with
Kennedy.
Three hours later Stanford
police, after conferring with
various University administrators

who were in communication with
the occupiers, decided to cite and
release the students. They were
charged with trespassing and un
lawful assembly, both mis
demeanors, and they are currently
under investigation by the Santa
Clara County District Attorney's
Office.
Members of the multi-racial
Agenda for Action Coalition, after
long meetings the following week
with Kennedy, said they feel the
same animosity toward him and
others in the administration that
led to the illegal occupation.
The University has ilready sent
letters to 53 members of the co
alition, stating they violated the
University's policy on campus dis
ruption. Protesters were told they
have until today to accept or chal
lenge the charge, which in the
past has led to anything from a
letter of censure to expulsion.
Angry protesters immediately
claimed the penalty was a divisive
tactic, and, dismayed at the Uni
versity's pursuit of penalizing
them, said they seriously question
the administration's commitment
to creating a multicultural educa
tion.
The coalition — composed of
members of the Asian American
Students Association, the Black
Student Union, Stanford Ameri
can Indian Organization, ASSU's
Committee for Democracy in Ed
ucation and MEChA, the
Chicano/Latino student group —
is pushing the administration to
accept its "agenda for action," 13
priorities aimed chiefly at imple
menting the proposals in the 244-
page University Committee on
Minority Issues report.
While the coalition has accused
the University of dragging its feet,
it has claimed victories in achiev
ing some agenda goals. Two weeks
ago members saw the establish
ment of an inter-departmental
search committee for an Asian-
American studies professor, and
last week they were successful in
pushing for a democratic selection
process when picking a dean for
El Centro Chicano.
The Year in Review was written
by editorial staff members Alicia
Kent and Eric Young. Jock
Friedly also contributed.
