## Editor's farewell 
### 
IN A SCATHING Dec. 22 ed
itorial, The Wall Street Jour
nal attacked Stanford for
"caving into political intimida
tion" and selling out on education
by deciding to revamp Western
Culture.
In February, a New York Times
reporter, who was certain that
reckless radicals had overrun the
campus, grilled me over the
phone. "Could the rumors pos
sibly be true? Are liberals trying
to forbid free speech?" she asked.
I took over as The Daily's editor
knowing that the people I most
admired — hard-nosed, profes
sional journalists — were ready
to rake Stanford over the coals.
It's the job of a journalist to
probe an issue while keeping
things clear and simple. But in
Stanford's case, the media was
missing the complexity of the
debate, unfairly portraying issues
unraveling here as an easy-to
understand confrontation: liberal
students lashing out against a
traditional institution.
I started this job believing that
The Daily had the insider's edge
and could show that the issues
shaping up on this campus were
far more sophisticated than Us
vs. Them. I felt certain the big
news of spring — four big letters,
UCMI — would prove to this
community and to skeptical out
siders that administrators and
students shared common, pro
gressive goals.
This optimist was wrong.
The student protesters who
seized University President
Donald Kennedy's office May 15
pushed too hard, giving hungry
reporters the explosive story they
drooled for. Threats, punish
ments, cries of University injus
tice. Those are the themes
leaking headlines.
Protesters lashed out against

Kennedy for not prioritizing his
agenda and for refusing to an
swer their concerns about UCMI
sooner. Ironically, however, when
The Daily tried to gauge student
priorities concerning UCMI in
late April we couldn't. Several
student leaders interviewed said
they had yet to read the report
because they were busy working
to secure student fee requests in
the upcoming ASSU election.
UCMI obviously takes a lot of
time to digest. But rather than
build on the potential the report
presents, protesters attacked
progress for coming too slowly.
And the press honed in on their
anger.
No newspaper, including The
Daily, is talking much about the
goals and findings outlined in the
UCMI report, even though more
than 300 members of the media
got hold of it.
The Stanford story now centers
on the battle between rebellious
students and a staunch university
president who refuses to let them
off the hook.
There won't be any winners in
this struggle — except, maybe,
some snide journalists who
seemed to have proved me wrong.
With that said, I would like to
end on a final note of thanks for
a staff I deeply respect. From
Andrew Berkowitz, who pleaded
with me to let off-beat jokes run,
to Mike Topolovac and his growls
from the darkroom, the diverse
staff of Volume 195 put out a
reliable early morning newspaper
that I will forever be proud of.
