## Letting yourself fly 
### 
VACATIONS ARE typically the time
for peace and quiet, relaxation and
rest. For the past week, I have
been around more activity and noise than
I ever saw at Stanford, and I was on
vacation.
I took a trip to Mexico with a big group
of people comprised of lawyers, bankers,
waitresses and even a few recent grads
like me. We were all looking for the an
tidote for civilization, and we found it to
lesser and greater degrees.
More than an antidote to the stress
and worry inherent to civilization,
though, I found out something about
myself, and for all of my education, I
don't think I could have found it
anywhere else.
When we arrived at Playa Blanca, we
were greeted by 50 white-clad young
people who sang to us, and escorted us
to our rooms. We were all tired, but - the
enthusiasm of the G.O.'s encouraged
about half of our group to stay up and
dance until early morning. The G.O.'s
(Gentil Organisateurs) are the reason for
Club Med's success, and they were the
ones who made my vacation truly special.
The other thing was the circus pro
gram. Playa Blanca is one of the few
places in the world where you can learn
how to fly without a plane. And even
galompht girls like me can do it.
When I first went out to the circus
area, I watched other people fly for a
half hour before deciding that I would
instantly be killed if I so much as stepped
on the ladder. I went back to my little
room and played with the resident gekko
until dinner.

The second day went a little better. I
actually made it up the ladder. When the
time came to get off it, though, I couldn't
quite bring myself to stick my foot out.
The ladder was at about the height of a
high one-story building and you had to
step across a 2-foot area of empty space
to get to the platform. Two feet never
looked so long.
Once on the platform, you are expected
to put chalk on your hands and wait
until the person ahead of you has flown.
What took most people 10 seconds took
me more than a minute — my palms are
chalk-resistant for some reason.
When the other person takes off, the
whole platform bounces up and down,
but as soon as they're gone, you have to
step around the supporting cable and
take their place. At this point, the trainer
who is up on the platform attaches safety
lines to a belt around your waist.
The next part was the toughest for
me. The whole time I was standing there,
three words kept running through my
mind — "crash and burn." And when I
had to lean out with 80 percent of my
weight and grab one end of the trapeze
bar, the words became almost deafening.
"I can't do this," I whined. "I mean,
I really can't do this." The trainer kept
assuring me that I could. Then she said
that I couldn't grab the bar with my
other hand until I had stepped off the
platform. "It's not going to happen. My
arm won't come up in time."
She said it would, then she pushed me
a little farther out and said that when
she said "Hep" I should step out and
bring the bar up. My arm would do the

rest. She said "Hep" and I leaped out,
and my arm miraculously came up and
grabbed the bar. I was so shocked I let
go, and landed safely, if a little rope
burned, in the net.
The next day, I went up knowing I
could do it, and I did better. I even dis
mounted with a back flip. And the third
day, I almost managed to hang upside
down.
Sure, other people were doing really
complicated tricks and I was satisfied
with a dismount, but I managed to get
up that ladder again, and that was
enough.
Now, in the history of the circus, I
may go down as one of the least coor
dinated flyers ever, but in my own mind,
I will go down as a flyer, no more, no less.
What I learned at Club Med, maybe
some of you already know, but as grad
uation approaches, it might be best to
remember it again. The only limits to
your accomplishments are those you put
on yourself, and whether you're on a
platform 100 feet in the air, or you do
your thing from a more conventional lo
cation, if you tell yourself you can
succeed, then you will, given time.
Thanks for paying attention to me this
volume.
