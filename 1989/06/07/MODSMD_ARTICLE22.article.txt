University must
teach that actions
have consequences
The rhetoric has been heavy these
final days concerning the University's
motives for pressing charges against
those who took over Building 10 on
May 15. Rhetoric is to be expected on
occasions like this, because it aims to
raise questions that will turn hearts —
whether or not the questions have
much to do with the facts.
The University's motives are neither
complicated nor as insidious as the
rhetoric suggests. Rather, a few simple
but very important principles are at
work. The first is that certain actions
have specific consequences, no matter
what one's reasons for choosing to act.
That is what rules are all about.
Those who chose to act unlawfully on
May 15 know that one is responsible
for one's actions, and that rules are
only as good as their fair and consis
tent enforcement. What is happening
now is really no more complicated than
that.
I referred earlier to other important
principles. A second, directly related to
what I have just laid out, is that one's
willingness to act despite the conse
quences is a critical measure of one's
convictions. Indeed, the greater the
anticipated consequences, the more
one's cause is likely to be taken
seriously.
That is the basis on which society's
great reformers have inspired change,
for they understood not only when it
was reasonable to act (and when not to
act), but they also gladly bore the con
sequences. The outcome of their ac
tions would hardly have been the same
had they demanded amnesty instead.
The lesson, in other words, is that to
be taken seriously you must be willing
to be treated seriously.
Is the University hypocritical to en
force the Policy on Campus Disruption

while the Fundameiml Standard
seems, to some, inadequate for dealing
with problems of harassing speech?
That hardly stands to reason. However
difficult the interpretation of policies in
one situtation, it makes no sense to
abandon them in instances where in
terpretation is clear.
If the University accepted that argu
ment, then it would fail in its responsi
bility to other people who depend on
rules to guarantee their rights — to
study, to teach, to work, indeed to
move freely.
But»what of clemency? It is alleged
that there is no room in our judicial
process for consideration of good inten
tions. There is room, of course, but
those who demanded it fail again to
understand its place. Motivations for
action deserve sensitive consideration
at the end of the process, if indeed
some penalty is even required.
But motivations do not determine in
the first place whether the line be
tween lawful and unlawful behavior
has been crossed. Actions do, and dif
ferent actions cross different lines.
That explains why different charges
have been made. If convictions follow,
those who were charged can be certain
that their original intentions will then
have an influence on the penalties I
impose.
Which brings me to the central point,
the one that gets lost in the rhetoric.
It begins with Stanford's obligation to
prepare people for the world beyond
this place. There, one's actions will
certainly have consequences, and that
is why they do here as well.
While it is clear to me that many of
those who participated on May 15 had
already learned the merit of developing
strong beliefs and acting on them, it is
less clear that they had learned about
accepting responsibility. Teaching that
lesson is, I believe, a far better expla
nation for the University's intentions
than all the rhetoric suggests.

Chicano election
was undemocratic,
stacked by MEChA
On June 1 the Chicano community
held a meeting to democratically elect
four students to a search committee to
select a full-time dean for El Centro
Chicano.
At the meeting, between 10 and 20
Chicano alumni and non-registered
students were seen casting ballots. Ad
ditionally, a group of approximately 20
non-Chicano students, many members
of the Agenda for Action Coalition,
were at the meeting.
We believe these people were called
to the meeting by MEChA, for the
purpose of stacking the vote. We cer
tainly did not invite them and doubt
they came through their own initiative
There are a small number of non-
Chicano students who without question
are considered a part of the communi
ty. These students have either lived in
Casa Zapata or have been actively in
volved in Chicano programs for an
extended period of time. They are
easily recognized and respected by the
Chicano community and can vote on
all issues. The 20 students brought in
by MEChA do not fit the above
criteria.
The 30 non-Chicano students, Chi
cano alumni and non-registered stu
dents had no right to vote. Some
stated they had come to support
MEChA, not vote. They could have
supported MEChA from outside the
meeting room. Their physical presence
of support for MEChA served as oppo
sition to Chicanos not aligned with
MEChA.
Worse yet, some of these students
did vote, enough to sway the final
outcome. If non-Chicano students who
are not recognized members of the
Chicano community can vote at com

munity meetings, why have community
meetings at all? Why not let all Stan
ford students vote for the full-time
dean, or all Chicano issues for that
matter? Communities must be free to
determine their future without direct
outside influence.
Historically, the Chicano community
has always been committed to a demo
cratic process. It is a process our com
munity can not function peacefully
without. MEChA perverted that process
at the Chicano community meeting.
MEChA told members of Agenda for
Action that they should attend the
Chicano community meeting to cancel
the votes of non-Chicanos that were
being brought in by Chicano students
not aligned with MEChA. That allega
tion was utterly false and a devious
trick. We lobbied hard to bring Chi
cano students to the community meet
ing — many participated in their first
community meeting — but we never
considered bringing in non-Chicanos.
We had faith in a fair process and
abided by it.
MEChA has destroyed our faith in
their willingness to abide by a demo
cratic process. For how can we work
with MEChA for the betterment of the
Chicano community when they refuse
to abide by something so fundamental
as a fair democratic process?
We are left with no recourse but to
request that the administration investi
gate the voting roster and MEChA for
voting violations at the June 1 commu
nity meeting,
Many of us have supported and ad
mired the ideals and goals of both the
Agenda for Action Coalition and
MEChA. Both have achieved tremen
dous benefits for ourselves and the
Chicano community. However, no goal,
no matter how noble, can justify the
perversion of a community's democratic
process, and thus we must take a
stand and request an investigation.

On June 1 the Chicano community
held a meeting to democratically elect
four students to a search committee to
select a full-time dean for El Centro
Chicano.
At the meeting, between 10 and 20
Chicano alumni and non-registered
students were seen casting ballots. Ad
ditionally, a group of approximately 20
non-Chicano students, many members
of the Agenda for Action Coalition,
were at the meeting.
We believe these people were called
to the meeting by MEChA, for the
purpose of stacking the vote. We cer
tainly did not invite them and doubt
they came through their own initiative
There are a small number of non-
Chicano students who without question
are considered a part of the communi
ty. These students have either lived in
Casa Zapata or have been actively in
volved in Chicano programs for an
extended period of time. They are
easily recognized and respected by the
Chicano community and can vote on
all issues. The 20 students brought in
by MEChA do not fit the above
criteria.
The 30 non-Chicano students, Chi
cano alumni and non-registered stu
dents had no right to vote. Some
stated they had come to support
MEChA, not vote. They could have
supported MEChA from outside the
meeting room. Their physical presence
of support for MEChA served as oppo
sition to Chicanos not aligned with
MEChA.
Worse yet, some of these students
did vote, enough to sway the final
outcome. If non-Chicano students who
are not recognized members of the
Chicano community can vote at com

munity meetings, why have community
meetings at all? Why not let all Stan
ford students vote for the full-time
dean, or all Chicano issues for that
matter? Communities must be free to
determine their future without direct
outside influence.
Historically, the Chicano community
has always been committed to a demo
cratic process. It is a process our com
munity can not function peacefully
without. MEChA perverted that process
at the Chicano community meeting.
MEChA told members of Agenda for
Action that they should attend the
Chicano community meeting to cancel
the votes of non-Chicanos that were
being brought in by Chicano students
not aligned with MEChA. That allega
tion was utterly false and a devious
trick. We lobbied hard to bring Chi
cano students to the community meet
ing — many participated in their first
community meeting — but we never
considered bringing in non-Chicanos.
We had faith in a fair process and
abided by it.
MEChA has destroyed our faith in
their willingness to abide by a demo
cratic process. For how can we work
with MEChA for the betterment of the
Chicano community when they refuse
to abide by something so fundamental
as a fair democratic process?
We are left with no recourse but to
request that the administration investi
gate the voting roster and MEChA for
voting violations at the June 1 commu
nity meeting,
Many of us have supported and ad
mired the ideals and goals of both the
Agenda for Action Coalition and
MEChA. Both have achieved tremen
dous benefits for ourselves and the
Chicano community. However, no goal,
no matter how noble, can justify the
perversion of a community's democratic
process, and thus we must take a
stand and request an investigation.

University must
teach that actions
have consequences
The rhetoric has been heavy these
final days concerning the University's
motives for pressing charges against
those who took over Building 10 on
May 15. Rhetoric is to be expected on
occasions like this, because it aims to
raise questions that will turn hearts —
whether or not the questions have
much to do with the facts.
The University's motives are neither
complicated nor as insidious as the
rhetoric suggests. Rather, a few simple
but very important principles are at
work. The first is that certain actions
have specific consequences, no matter
what one's reasons for choosing to act.
That is what rules are all about.
Those who chose to act unlawfully on
May 15 know that one is responsible
for one's actions, and that rules are
only as good as their fair and consis
tent enforcement. What is happening
now is really no more complicated than
that.
I referred earlier to other important
principles. A second, directly related to
what I have just laid out, is that one's
willingness to act despite the conse
quences is a critical measure of one's
convictions. Indeed, the greater the
anticipated consequences, the more
one's cause is likely to be taken
seriously.
That is the basis on which society's
great reformers have inspired change,
for they understood not only when it
was reasonable to act (and when not to
act), but they also gladly bore the con
sequences. The outcome of their ac
tions would hardly have been the same
had they demanded amnesty instead.
The lesson, in other words, is that to
be taken seriously you must be willing
to be treated seriously.
Is the University hypocritical to en
force the Policy on Campus Disruption

while the Fundameiml Standard
seems, to some, inadequate for dealing
with problems of harassing speech?
That hardly stands to reason. However
difficult the interpretation of policies in
one situtation, it makes no sense to
abandon them in instances where in
terpretation is clear.
If the University accepted that argu
ment, then it would fail in its responsi
bility to other people who depend on
rules to guarantee their rights — to
study, to teach, to work, indeed to
move freely.
But»what of clemency? It is alleged
that there is no room in our judicial
process for consideration of good inten
tions. There is room, of course, but
those who demanded it fail again to
understand its place. Motivations for
action deserve sensitive consideration
at the end of the process, if indeed
some penalty is even required.
But motivations do not determine in
the first place whether the line be
tween lawful and unlawful behavior
has been crossed. Actions do, and dif
ferent actions cross different lines.
That explains why different charges
have been made. If convictions follow,
those who were charged can be certain
that their original intentions will then
have an influence on the penalties I
impose.
Which brings me to the central point,
the one that gets lost in the rhetoric.
It begins with Stanford's obligation to
prepare people for the world beyond
this place. There, one's actions will
certainly have consequences, and that
is why they do here as well.
While it is clear to me that many of
those who participated on May 15 had
already learned the merit of developing
strong beliefs and acting on them, it is
less clear that they had learned about
accepting responsibility. Teaching that
lesson is, I believe, a far better expla
nation for the University's intentions
than all the rhetoric suggests.
