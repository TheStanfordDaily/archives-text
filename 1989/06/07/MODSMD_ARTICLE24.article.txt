# Massacre shows 'People's' Republic leaders lack vision
## 
### 
The recent developments in China
had rekindled the hope for democratic
reform in many young intellectuals and
people from all walks of life. Student
protesters with victory signs and mas
sive civilian support were seen in the
media again and again.
Military attempts to enter Tianan
men Square were always met with
spontaneous civilian blockade in the
form of their very own bodies. But
then came June 4, probably the most
horrible single day in recent human
history.
Shortly after midnight, the People's
Government in the People's Republic of
China ordered the People's Army to
brutally slaughter the people. The
heavily armored Liberation Army,
ready for combat (each soldier
equipped with 300 counts of bullets, 50
more than what each got in the Viet
nam War), was sent to Tiananmen
Square to literally get rid of the un
armed, incredibly disciplined and peace
ful student protesters and their sup
porters.
Some protesters, while resting in

their tents, were run over and crushed
to death by tanks. Their corpses were
immediately bathed in gasoline and
burnt to conceal the crime. The rest of
the students and civilians were indis
criminately shot at. Lives of onlookers
and passers-by, be they 3 or 60 years
of age, were not spared.
One justification of the study of
history is that we can learn from the
past and thus avoid mistakes made by
our ancestors. The thousand-year-long
history of humankind has seen the
overthrow of many cruel emperors and
dictators by outraged people.
Now the communist government of
China — which always claims to be
one that is to serve the people —
decided to get rid of the people be
cause they demanded something the
regime does not want to implement —
democracy. Have Deng Xiao Ping and •
Li Peng learned anything from their
predecessors?
At a time when finals are around
the corner at Stanford, the future
leaders of the world may want to
pause and reflect for a moment: Am I
going to lead a government which is
truly for the people? Remember, water
has the ability both to carry the boat
and overturn it.
