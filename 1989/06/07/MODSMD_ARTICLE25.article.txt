# DA should drop all charges against the May 15 protesters
## 
### 
We are writing to urge Tim Black
wood, supervising district attorney of
Santa Clara County, not to proceed
with the prosecution of the students
arrested on the Stanford campus May
15 in connection with the occupation
of University President Donald Ken
nedy's office.
The incident of May 15 is in every
respect an affair of the Stanford com
munity. It occurred on campus and
involved exclusively members of the
University community. It was con
cerned with long-standing issues of
education and campus life.
Stanford has its own internal judicial
mechanism for policing its members.
This judicial process can accommodate
concerns peculiar to this case, such as
the issues underlying the incident and
the motivation for the actions, in a
way the more generalized state court
process cannot.
The May 15 incident arose out of the
desire of students to improve this uni
versity. We feel it is not in the best
interests of the People of the State of

California or anyone else to bring the
power of the state courts to bear
against these students.
The University has already begun to
prosecute students for violations of the
Policy on Campus Disruption. We urge
Blackwood, in his prosecutorial discre
tion, not to proceed in state court with
these cases, and to allow these stu
dents to face the consequences of their
actions according to the disciplinary
procedure in the University community
