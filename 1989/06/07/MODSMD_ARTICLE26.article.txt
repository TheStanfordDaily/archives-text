# Administration's stance on protest deeply hypocritical
## 
### 
In his June 2 letter, Assistant to the
President G. Robert Hamrdla claims
merely to accuse The Daily of using
flawed logic. Yet his position implies
more than he tells us.
Hamrdla is right to point out that
the students who demonstrated cannot
be let off the hook simply because they

believe the demands they are fighting
for will improve the University.
University President Donald Ken
nedy, however, would like us to think
that the students are not the only ones
who hold this belief. The administra
tion has told us that it shares these
students' vision.
Yet still it insists on punishing those
involved in the May 15 action. There
is a profound hypocrisy here which
must be exposed: the administration
cannot, on the one hand, tell us that it
agrees with the students, and, on the
other, bring the full weight of the
"judicial process" to bear on them.
Blacks were arrested during the civil
rights movement for acting on a firm
belief in equality and for seeking to
implement their vision of a non
discriminatory society. For those who
prosecuted them to have simultane
ously claimed that they shared that
belief and that vision would have been
blatantly hypocritical.
If Hamrdla does not agree with the
Agenda for Action's motives, he should
say that — not say that The Daily's
logic was "fallacious." Likewise, if the
administration insists on prosecuting
the May 15 demonstrators, it should
stop professing its commitment to a
multicultural education at Stanford.
