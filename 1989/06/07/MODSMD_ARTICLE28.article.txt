Editor'a note: It may be a
week old, but it's still inter
esting.
May 31, 1945
The Stanford Daily
Dean of Men John Bunn
predicted that the surge of
servicemen returning to
Stanford from combat over
seas would force the Univer
sity to reduce the number
of women it admitted.
However, Bunn added
that he hoped the school
would maintain a better co
educational balance than
when there were only 500
women enrolled, "especially
for social reasons."
Bunn also said, "The war
has demonstrated the neces
sity of athletic competition,"
and that he hoped Stanford
would resume participation
in intercollegiate athletics as
soon as postwar conditions
permit.
Sounds like a party kind
of guy, huh?
May 31, 1968
The Stanford Daily
David Harris, former
ASSU president, was found
guilty of willfully refusing
induction into the armed
forces and was sentenced to
three years in prison.
Besides being ASSU pres
ident, Harris was one of the
founding members of the
Resistance, a group that
began protesting the war in
Vietnam by burning their
draft cards, and was married
to singer Joan Baez.
