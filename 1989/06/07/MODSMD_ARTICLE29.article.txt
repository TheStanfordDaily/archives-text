# Stanford's driver steers through traffic and protests
## 
### Caitlin Liu Staff writer 
What would you do if they took
away your Cadillac and made you
drive a Chevy?
As the personal driver of Stan
ford University presidents for the
past 20 years, Jack Dempsey has
only one complaint about his job:
He misses the luxury sedan he
used to drive.
"1 started out with a Cadillac
Fleetwood," says the silver-haired
Dempsey with a faraway look in
his eyes. The look fades quickly
as he makes a face. "I'm now
driving a Chevrolet. That should
tell you something."

One Soviet visitor
was so impressed
with the car that he
asked Dempsey if he
could try driving it.

With a mischievous smile, the
spectacled man leans forward and
whispers that the University has
become "cheap" over the years.
In the last two decades,
Dempsey has gone through five
cars and almost as many changes
in University administration.
Dempsey has distinct memories
of each of the four presidents he
has driven.
Current University President
Donald Kennedy, Dempsey 9ays,
likes to discuss sports — all Stan
ford sports. When Kennedy
returns from a trip, he always
wants to know how the various
teams did while he was gone.
When the baseball team won the
College World Series last year,
Kennedy "was out of his gourd,"
Dempsey says.
Dempsey became University
driver in September 1968, when
Robert Glaser, who was dean of
the Medical School at that time,
was the acting president.
Glaser was the one who taught
him all the secret ways to avoid

traffic by driving through Menlo
Park and Atherton, Dempsey
says.
"At the time I started, [ high
way] 280 was not finished," he
explains. To get to San Francisco,
he often navigated through resi
dential areas to avoid the conges
tion, he says.
"[Glaser] was a real nice
gentleman," Dempsey recalls. "He
took me to all the football games
the first year, and, being presi
dent, he sat up in the pressbox,
and I got to sit in the pressbox too.
"I got spoiled very quickly,"
Dempsey adds with a laugh.
Dempsey says he doesn't re
member Kenneth Pitzer, who be
came president in Janurary 1969,
very well.
"[Pitzer] served for approxi
mately 18 months and resigned
in the middle of student rioting,"
he says.
Dempsey describes the next
president, Richard Lyman, as a
disciplined historian by training
who was "very focused on his
work" and always brought it along
to read in the car.
Besides driving the president,
Dempsey occasionally drives the
provost and special visitors of the
University.
He vividly remembers one So
viet visitor who was so impressed
with the car that he asked
Dempsey if he could try driving it.
"I was a little leery about it,"
Dempsey says, "but I let him drive
it for about five miles, and he
really enjoyed that. He said it was
the finest car he's ever ridden in
or driven."
This was back when the Uni
versity had the Cadillac, Dempsey
says with a laugh, certainly not
the Chevy.
When Dempsey is not driving
the president or a visitor, he does
administrative work in the Office
of the President. The occupation
of the President's office three
weeks ago was yet another exam
ple of student activism he has wit
nessed over the years, he says.
In the early 19705, Dempsey
recalls, "the students were
causing an awful lot of damage

at the University — breaking win
dows, damaging cars . . . slashing
the tires of a lot of University
vehicles.
"As if Stanford could get us out
of Vietnam," he sighs. "It really
got totally out of hand."
Dempsey says he's been through
five or six sit-ins at the President's
office in the years he's been at
Stanford. Though he does not
recall the reason for most of the

protests, one particular sit-in
stands out in his mind, he says.
"Sometime during the late
'705," Dempsey recalls, "we had
a sit-in, with the students occupy
ing the first floor in [the Presi
dent's office] where I was upstairs
working."
Dempsey says he went
downstairs to relieve the recep
tionist, but to avoid stepping on
some students who were all over

the floor, he "went out the back
door and came in the front door,
and stepped over a couple of
bodies" to get to the receptionist's
desk.
"It was rather chilly that day,
so I was wearing my coat,"
Dempsey recalls. "The students
were curious as to who I was, and
one of the students asked me, 'Are
you with the police?'
"I remembered I had this key
chain in my coat pocket and I
pulled it out."
Dempsey hurries into the back
room behind his desk and comes
back with a shiny small piece of
metal — the same key chain he
showed to that student many
years ago.
The metal tag attached to the
key chain reads "CIA FILE
ROOM."
The student's eyes "nearly
popped out of his head," Dempsey
laughs. "There were rumors at
that time that the CIA and the
FBI were quite active on campus."
"Two or three other students
looked at it and I put it back into
my coat pocket and just smiled
at them," Dempsey says.
Where did Dempsey get that
key chain? He says he had bought
it for fun at a drugstore some
time before.
Before coming to Stanford,
Dempsey spent 20 years in the
Air Force as a sergeant in a fighter
squadron and an administrator.
In the Air Force, he says, "you
always knew who was in charge.
In the University, it's kind of
governed by consensus."
Dempsey says he thinks the
University hired him because he
had military training. Since his
job requires frequent interactions
with top University officials, they
needed someone who knew when
to "keep his mouth shut" about
things, he says.
Dempsey says he has a perfect
driving record — he has never
received a ticket or gotten in an
accident during all his years with
the military and the University.
However, he did receive a citation
for a broken headlight once, he
adds with a smile.

Dempsey spent 20 years in the
Air Force as a sergeant in a fighter
squadron and an administrator.
In the Air Force, he says, "you
always knew who was in charge.
In the University, it's kind of
governed by consensus."
Dempsey says he thinks the
University hired him because he
had military training. Since his
job requires frequent interactions
with top University officials, they
needed someone who knew when
to "keep his mouth shut" about
things, he says.
Dempsey says he has a perfect
driving record — he has never
received a ticket or gotten in an
accident during all his years with
the military and the University.
However, he did receive a citation
for a broken headlight once, he
adds with a smile.


Kai Keasey — Daily
University driver Jack Dempsey, with his Chevrolet, says he
preferred transporting University presidents and other officials in
the Cadillac he drove before Stanford became "cheap."
What would you do if they took
away your Cadillac and made you
drive a Chevy?
As the personal driver of Stan
ford University presidents for the
past 20 years, Jack Dempsey has
only one complaint about his job:
He misses the luxury sedan he
used to drive.
"1 started out with a Cadillac
Fleetwood," says the silver-haired
Dempsey with a faraway look in
his eyes. The look fades quickly
as he makes a face. "I'm now
driving a Chevrolet. That should
tell you something."

One Soviet visitor
was so impressed
with the car that he
asked Dempsey if he
could try driving it.

With a mischievous smile, the
spectacled man leans forward and
whispers that the University has
become "cheap" over the years.
In the last two decades,
Dempsey has gone through five
cars and almost as many changes
in University administration.
Dempsey has distinct memories
of each of the four presidents he
has driven.
Current University President
Donald Kennedy, Dempsey 9ays,
likes to discuss sports — all Stan
ford sports. When Kennedy
returns from a trip, he always
wants to know how the various
teams did while he was gone.
When the baseball team won the
College World Series last year,
Kennedy "was out of his gourd,"
Dempsey says.
Dempsey became University
driver in September 1968, when
Robert Glaser, who was dean of
the Medical School at that time,
was the acting president.
Glaser was the one who taught
him all the secret ways to avoid

traffic by driving through Menlo
Park and Atherton, Dempsey
says.
"At the time I started, [ high
way] 280 was not finished," he
explains. To get to San Francisco,
he often navigated through resi
dential areas to avoid the conges
tion, he says.
"[Glaser] was a real nice
gentleman," Dempsey recalls. "He
took me to all the football games
the first year, and, being presi
dent, he sat up in the pressbox,
and I got to sit in the pressbox too.
"I got spoiled very quickly,"
Dempsey adds with a laugh.
Dempsey says he doesn't re
member Kenneth Pitzer, who be
came president in Janurary 1969,
very well.
"[Pitzer] served for approxi
mately 18 months and resigned
in the middle of student rioting,"
he says.
Dempsey describes the next
president, Richard Lyman, as a
disciplined historian by training
who was "very focused on his
work" and always brought it along
to read in the car.
Besides driving the president,
Dempsey occasionally drives the
provost and special visitors of the
University.
He vividly remembers one So
viet visitor who was so impressed
with the car that he asked
Dempsey if he could try driving it.
"I was a little leery about it,"
Dempsey says, "but I let him drive
it for about five miles, and he
really enjoyed that. He said it was
the finest car he's ever ridden in
or driven."
This was back when the Uni
versity had the Cadillac, Dempsey
says with a laugh, certainly not
the Chevy.
When Dempsey is not driving
the president or a visitor, he does
administrative work in the Office
of the President. The occupation
of the President's office three
weeks ago was yet another exam
ple of student activism he has wit
nessed over the years, he says.
In the early 19705, Dempsey
recalls, "the students were
causing an awful lot of damage

at the University — breaking win
dows, damaging cars . . . slashing
the tires of a lot of University
vehicles.
"As if Stanford could get us out
of Vietnam," he sighs. "It really
got totally out of hand."
Dempsey says he's been through
five or six sit-ins at the President's
office in the years he's been at
Stanford. Though he does not
recall the reason for most of the

protests, one particular sit-in
stands out in his mind, he says.
"Sometime during the late
'705," Dempsey recalls, "we had
a sit-in, with the students occupy
ing the first floor in [the Presi
dent's office] where I was upstairs
working."
Dempsey says he went
downstairs to relieve the recep
tionist, but to avoid stepping on
some students who were all over

the floor, he "went out the back
door and came in the front door,
and stepped over a couple of
bodies" to get to the receptionist's
desk.
"It was rather chilly that day,
so I was wearing my coat,"
Dempsey recalls. "The students
were curious as to who I was, and
one of the students asked me, 'Are
you with the police?'
"I remembered I had this key
chain in my coat pocket and I
pulled it out."
Dempsey hurries into the back
room behind his desk and comes
back with a shiny small piece of
metal — the same key chain he
showed to that student many
years ago.
The metal tag attached to the
key chain reads "CIA FILE
ROOM."
The student's eyes "nearly
popped out of his head," Dempsey
laughs. "There were rumors at
that time that the CIA and the
FBI were quite active on campus."
"Two or three other students
looked at it and I put it back into
my coat pocket and just smiled
at them," Dempsey says.
Where did Dempsey get that
key chain? He says he had bought
it for fun at a drugstore some
time before.
Before coming to Stanford,
Dempsey spent 20 years in the
Air Force as a sergeant in a fighter
squadron and an administrator.
In the Air Force, he says, "you
always knew who was in charge.
