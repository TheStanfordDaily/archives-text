# Kennedy pushes for agency to upgrade Webb
## 
### Michael Friedly Staff writer 
University President Donald
Kennedy took his first direct
stand on behalf of Webb Ranch
workers, calling on Gary Webb,
the operator of the ranch, to
cooperate with a local agency that
offered to improve the workers'
housing at no cost.
The Community Action Agency,
a private, non-profit organization
that aids low-income families, was
called in by the United Stanford
Workers to provide food for the
ranch workers. After hearing com
plaints from the workers about
inadequate heating during the
winter months, the agency offered
in late May to make improvements
on "weatherization," according to
William Parker, executive director
of the agency.
Before work can begin on the
housing facilities, the agency must
have approval for the improve
ments from the landowner. Parker
said he cannot investigate exactly
what improvements will be made
on the housing until he gets the
landowner'B approval. In addition,
the landowner must sign an
agreement that no raise in rent
or evictions of workers will occur
as a result of the renovations.
Although Kennedy has not
issued an official University OK
for the agency to begin its work,
at last Thursday's Faculty Senate
meeting he did urge Gary Webb
to comply with the agency. Ken
nedy declined to elaborate on his
appeal to Webb.
Despite his push for the ranch
owner to act, Kennedy continues
to maintain that the University
is not legally responsible for the
living and working conditions at
Webb.
"We lease the land to Webb . . .
they're the only persons who can
execute," Kennedy told the Fac
ulty Senate last Thursday.
However, the USW, which rep
resents the workers at the ranch,

sees the issue of University re
sponsibility in a different light.
Last Wednesday, union workers
marched to Kennedy's office,
seeking his approval — as lan
downer — for the agency's im
provements- to start. The
marchers brought along necessary
documents and a petition signed
by 1,200 Stanford students, fac
ulty and staff members. The plan
was thwarted when marchers
found the office doors locked.
Following the USW march, Ken
nedy transferred the case con
cerning the agency to Zera
Murphy, the University director
of real estate and lands manage
ment. In reviewing the documents,
Murphy concluded that the
workers are tenants of Webb
Ranch and not of Stanford, so the
agency's proposal was not within
the jurisdiction of the University.
In a June 1 letter to a USW field,
representative Murphy also cited
Stanford's inability to guarantee
that evictions and rent hikes
would not occur as a result of the
improvements.
When contacted last night,
Webb said that he was unaware
of the agency's proposal. He said
that he had not yet received the
documentation from the Univer
sity and that no union represen
tatives had contacted him in
regard to the proposal.
The USW intends to put the
agency's proposal near the top of
its agenda when talks resume with
Webb Ranch Thursday afternoon.
This will be the second meeting
since Webb Ranch workers over
whelmingly voted to join the un
ion on April 6.
Kennedy also responded to
criticism about his office's han
dling of the USW marchers. Ken
nedy explained that his "office
stafT has quite a lot of reason to
be alarmed about large crowds
wanting immediate entry" — re
ferring to the May 15 takeover of
the President's Office by more
than 50 students.
