# Bug bids adieu to faithful readers — faithless ones too
## 
### Mark Smoyer Senior staff writer 
I know, I know . . . you feel a
little down. You know that not
only are you a loser, but also that
this is the last Bug Me by this
Bug that you'll ever read.
Disconsolate, you wonder if
anything will come along into
your life to make it worth living,
now that the Bug has left.
Well, just imagine how bad
you'd feel if this column was ever
any good. Huh? How about that?
Now you know why it just never
really was that great. . . .
Because I care for you, the home
reader. Sure, I could've had you
doubled over weekly in hysterics.
In fact, if you were intelligent
enough to follow the Bug's line of
thinking, you would've been con
sistently cathartic with laughter.
But you aren't and so you weren't,
and so thank me.
You're welcome.
Reaction to the Bug can be
separated into three categories:
public feedback, media criticism

and prospective employer re
sponse.
I never really paid an iota of
attention to public feedback so
we'll move on to the second cat
egory.

I must admit that newspaper
and television reviews were al
most always highly favorable, a
fact which completely discredits
any claim I might make to the
column's wisdom, style or sophis
tication. Witness the following se
lection:
"I LOVED IT!" - Gene Shalit
"Charming, glossy, superficial,
easy to understand . . . flawless
art! — Rex Reed
"I died laughing, even when he
wasn't joking! — John Updike
"The Bug's Altman-esque frag
mentation, Scorcese-like medita
tions and pococurante attitude of
neo-classical minimalism create
an aura which smacks of Caufield,
Peter Pan and Grover." — Pauline
Kael
In the third category, prospec
tive employers who were fortu
nate enough to receive samples of
the Bug's work usually didn't an
swer at all. Of those answers I
did receive, this was the most pos
itive:
Dear Bug,
Thank you for your interest in

USA Today. Unfortunately, at this
time we have no openings for
morons foolish enough to submit
provincial, sloppy and unfunny
newspaper writing.
In fact, you could hold a gun
to the head of my 2-year-old and
demand a position with our paper
and I still wouldn't hesitate to
say, "No."
We will not keep your resume
on file. We do not wish you luck
in your career search.
Alas, my preaching is not done,
oh earthbound ones. I close with
three aphorisms:
Life is not all bad. Sure, it gets
soggy in milk, but straight out of
the box it is a delicious, nutritious
snack.
Mediocrity with ease, excellence
with shame (only the word "in
cidentally" has appeared in Bug
Me more than this maxim).
And most importantly: It's not
what's on the inside that counts;
it what's on the outside that
makes you the person you really
are.
The Bug has spoken.
