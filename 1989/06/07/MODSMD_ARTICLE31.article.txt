# It's better than living in a Manzanita trailer. . .
## Truck sweet truck: Student, friend call pick-up home 
### Maryellen Driscoll 
Imagine yourself and a friend
living in the 4-by-6 foot cab of a
pick-up truck with only a few
changes of clothes, the necessary
toiletries and a pair of sleeping
bags.
Sound like a great way to spend
spring break?
Think again. Now imagine the
same scenario but park your truck
in the parking lot at Manzanita
Park. This is your "home away
from home" for a year at Stanford.
No, this is not a gross exag
geration of life in a Manzanita
trailer, but the real situation of
a junior who wanted to be iden
tified only by his first name,
Andrew.
Andrew arrived on campus in
September after driving cross
country in a 1981 Volkswagen
pick-up truck with his high school
buddy, Paul. Originally assigned
to live in Manzanita, Andrew
decided he would rather find an
apartment off-campus. Having
lived in a Manzanita trailer the
Srevious summer, Andrew said he
id not feel compelled to relive
the experience.
Planning to find an apartment
during the first few weeks of fail
quarter, Andrew decided to stay
in the truck with Paul, who
planned to drive back to the Mid
west after seeing California.
Paul, however, got a good job
with a nearby bike shop and
decided to hang out for the whole
year. He and Andrew chose to con
tinue their vagabond lifestyle and
live in the truck.
"There was no need to go into
more debt. ... I wouldn't be here
if I didn't have a transfer schol
arship, financial aid and loans,"

said Andrew who transferred from
Oberlin College as a sophomore.
The two quickly had to start
cutting back on their possessions.
"The redly neat thing about it is
that it forces us to determine
what is of value," Andrew
remarked.
Using a few lockers on campus
and the two-and-a-half foot shelf
he and Paul built across the end
of the cab, Andrew is able to store
a few changes of clothes and his
necessary books for the quarter.
Paul survives with a bag of
clothes and one bode, which, ac
cording to Andrew, he has been
reading all year. Both have bikes,
which are their most prized pos
sessions.
"I think it would be more dif
ficult for someone who is used to
having all of the amenities right
there all of the time," Andrew
said.
"It's really quite small,"
Andrew said. "But after you've
been out there [in the truck) for
a while it gets bigger."
The truck lifestyle has had its
trials however. "You have to in
troduce some instability. You have
to take risks," Andrew noted.
One difficulty is the hole in the
truck's roof just above where
Andrew lays his head. Lucky for
him the winter was not too wet.
A few weeks ago, Andrew's
father came to visit. Rather than
staying in a hotel room, his dad
rented a car to sleep in and share
Andrew's experience. "I think it
was one of the most interesting
parental visits that could happen
at Stanford," Andrew said.
Without University Food Serv
ice, Andrew and Paul's diet has
not been exemplary. As a hasher
at Florence Moore Hall, Andrew

has been able to get free break
fasts. Lunch and dinner, however,
have not been part of his daily
vocabulary for the past year.
Sometimes he visits friends and
snacks on their food and some
times he and Paul go out and buy
carrots. However, the key to their
survival, according to Andrew,
has been the free day-old donuts
that Safeway puts out every night
at midnight.
"The big drawback," according

to Andrew, is that "you don't have
a place of your own. You don't
have space . . . and my relation
ship with Paul gets strained a lot
because we don't see things eye
to eye."
Both Paul and Andrew do, how
ever, hang out in the Manzanita
lounge at times to relax, watch
the news and revel in some
"space." They also do their
laundry there. And, they do
shower — at Encina Gym.

Andrew plans to graduate from
Stanford as an English major
after attending Kent State Uni
versity for the summer. He has
taken 23 units of credit for every
quarter that he has been here.
"Principally I'm here for my
ticket so I can join the big
parade," explained Andrew, who
hopes to travel for a while after
graduating and attend graduate
school in environmental studies.
Despite the risks of living in

Manzanita's parking lot, neither
Paul nor Andrew has had any
problems with trailer residents or
police. The two have maintained
"a sort of self-imposed isolation,"
so as not to "ruffle anyone's feath
ers," according to Andrew.
"I think we picked Manzanita
because it's not like a thorough
fare and it's not like a wide-spread
field," Andrew explained. "People
do their own thing at Manzanita
so we're just like our own separate
thing.
"We were thinking of having a
campus-wide tailgate party,"
Andrew added with a chuckle.
"But that was more of a joke than
anything else."
There have also been some
benefits to living in a truck, other
than just saving lots of money
With a grin Andrew explained,
"You can observe a lot of things
at night people don't notice."
For instance, one student comes
out of his trailer in the middle of
the night to jump rope for hours.
Andrew said he is most amused
by the fact that this man cannot
jump rope at all, despite his
lengthy efforts.
"I think we've had a lot of choice
moments from (living in the
parking lot)," Andrew said.
With all the ups and downs of
living in a small truck for a year,
Andrew seems not to regret his
experience.
"You're constantly forced to ex
amine things. You know —
where's your next meal coming
from? . . . What are you going to
do? Go out to Safeway to get the
stale donuts when you can afford
it?
"I think 1 would do it again,"
he concluded. "But I would get a
Winnebago."
