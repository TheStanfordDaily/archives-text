# Non-MEChA students question search committee vote
## 
### Janine De Fao Staff writer 
Some Chicano students not af
filiated with MEChA have ac
cused the Chicano/Latino student
group with "stacking" last Thurs
day's vote for a search committee
for a new Chicano community
dean, but University officials said
the election did not violate Uni
versity policies.
Sophomore Michael Canul, one
of the 17 students making the
accusation, said MEChA brought
people to the meeting from out
side the Chicano student commu
nity to vote for their nominees.
He said such people included
alumni, unregistered students and
members of the Agenda for Action
coalition who are not directly in
volved in the Chicano community.
"[MEChA] perverted the proc
ess," said senior Patty Davis, a
resident assistant at Casa Zapata.
Keith Archuleta, assistant dean
of Student Affairs and Black Com
munity Services Center director,
who was present to mediate the
meeting, said, "There aren't any
policies that relate to this [mat

ter]. In terms of policy, [the Office
of Student Affairs] is not usually
involved in student elections."
Responding to the claims of the
non-MEChA students, Assoc.
Dean of Student Affairs Michael
Jackson, who moderated the
meeting, said that he could not
bar any student from voting in
an open democratic process.
Both Jackson and Archuleta
said that the election results will
stand. "I'm not going to overturn
those results," Jackson said.
Jackson added that there are
non-Chicano students involved
with the community, througlV pro
grams like Barrio Assistance and
Project Motivation, who should be
allowed to vote.
Canul said he agreed that those
students had the right to vote,
but that certain voters were not
part of the community.
The vote, which was supposed
to occur the previous week, was
postponed because certain stu
dents felt that the meeting did
not receive enough publicly. Dur
ing that week, students divided
into two slates of candidates —
one comprised of MEChA mem

bers, the other of non-MEChA
members.
Of the four students elected to
search for a full-time dean for El
Centro Chicano, two were MEChA
members and two were not. At
least 200 students attended the
meeting.
Leticia Valadez, new co-chair of
MEChA, said that she and
MEChA believe in "self
determination," the right of mem
bers of the Chicano community
to choose their own leaders and
decide their own future, but said
she would have preferred if only
Chicano students voted in the
election.
Concerning whether Agenda for
Action coalition members should
have been allowed to vote, she
said, "They were arrested for this
issue. We couldn't tell anyone
'Sorry, you don't have the right
to vote.' It was on their con
science."
Before Thursday's meeting,
some students from both sides ap
proached Jackson with the con
cern that people who were not
members of the community were
present. Jackson appealed to the

consciences of those at the meet
ing, asking them to be on their
honor and only vote if they
thought they should.
Valadez said that MEChA ac
cepted Jackson's decision to allow
student to vote on their honor.
Archuleta said that they were
asked to help run the election be
cause certain members of the
community thought it would be
unfair if MEChA was in charge.
Archuleta added that it was made
clear before the meeting that "no
one was going to get into the busi
ness of deciding who was a mem
ber of the Chicano community
and who was not."
"Everybody is on their honor
around here.
There is a University policy that
only registered students may
serve on a University committee,
according to Dean of Student Af
fairs James Lyons.
However, Lyons said, the selec
tion committee is not a University
committee, but rather "a commit
tee charged by [ Jackson] and his
office," and therefore would not
be subject to this policy.
