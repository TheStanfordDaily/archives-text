# Cancer therapy beats odds
## 
### James Biggs 
Four human subjects suffer
ing lethal brain tumors un
cured by conventional therapy
are still alive today and are
beating the odds after receiving
an experimental new form of
immunotherapy being devel
oped at Stanford.
The treatment, which uses
injections of killed bacteria to
spur the body's immune system
to fight the tumor, is still years
away from becoming standard
practice.
The method entered Food
and Drug Administration trials
in January, according to
Francis Conley, neurosurgery
professor and a creator of the
technique.
The immunotherapy targets
glioblastoma multiforme, the
most lethal form of brain
tumor. Each year glioblastoma
affects about 8,000 Americans,
and despite the best efforts of
modern medicine it proves fatal
within two years.

But that may be changing.
Conley's technique, unlike con
ventional surgery, radiotherapy
or chemotherapy, has achieved
survival rates of 20 percent of
trials on mice.
"None [of the humansl have
died and two have show tumor
shrinkage," said Conley. "We
are on an absolute high in my
laboratory."
With the addition of
interleukin-11, a protein of the
immune system, Conley can
further "hype-up" the immune
response, pushing survival
rates up to 60 percent.
Conly achieves this level by
inducing the body's own im
mune system to fight the
tumor.
If human trials go well Con
ley hopes for an economically
feasible, life-saving treatment
in a few years.
But for now Conley watches
her four patients with brain
tumors, patiently collecting
data to present to the FDA.
