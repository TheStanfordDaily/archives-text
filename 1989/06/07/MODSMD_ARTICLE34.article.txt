In response to a survey which
revealed high instances of ac
quaintance rape and sexual coer
cion of female students, Dean of
Student Affairs James Lyons said
he will appoint a task force to
investigate the problem.
The Stanford Survey on Atti
tudes, Awareness and Experiences
of Sexual Violence reported May
15 that about one-third of female
students who responded said they
had been coerced into having sex
through pressure or argument.
The survey was sponsored by the
Rape Education Project.
At the May 4 Student Affairs
Council meeting, project members
presented the results of the survey
and proposed a task force to in
vestigate the issue of campus
rape.
Subsequently, Lyons expressed
his intention to appoint a task

force chair and have specific
guidelines in place before the end
of June. Lyons received a draft
of a proposal for a charge to com
mittee last week, and he met with
Suzanne O'Brien, a member of
the project, on Tuesday.
"[Lyons] is someone who always
comes out in support of the REP,"
O'Brien said.
Although he will not serve on
the task force and cannotvdirect
its course other than in appoint
ing its members, Lyons speculated
the task force will help the Uni
versity focus on some of the find
ings and implications of the REP
survey, examine other data about
campus rape, and recommend the
creation of specific rape education
and rape prevention programs.
The specific goals of the task
force will be set after Lyons,
O'Brien, the to-be-named chair of
the task force, and perhaps an
other University administrator
finalize the guidelines.
