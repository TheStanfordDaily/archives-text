# Survey of food service shows student distaste
## 
### Jonathan Eisenberg Staff writer 
According to the results of a
campus-wide survey on facili
ties and food conducted this
spring, students have a strong
distaste for University Food
Service.
The Advisory Committee on
University Food Services,
which helped to write the sur
vey, will make recommenda
tions for improvement to food
service administrators based
on results which show that 77.7
percent of the approximately
1,500 respondents do not feel
they are getting "value on the
board plan dollar."
James Keeton, manager of
University Food Services and
a member of the committee,
said: "We're as concerned
about (maintaining value for
the food dollar) as the students

are." He admitted, however,
that he is not surprised by the
percentage.
Other results show that more
than 40 percent of the student
body would take a 10-meal per
week option if it were offered.
Also, 92.2 percent of the re
spondents said they would like
to be able to use their meal
card at Tresidder Union and
72 percent said they would like
to see a food point system, like
the one at Sterling Quad, im
plemented elsewhere on
campus.
The committee will meet to
morrow to determine its
agenda for next year, and it
has set board plan price reduc
tion as its top goal along with
equalization of prices among all
food services, greater flexibility
of meal plans by including
more options.
