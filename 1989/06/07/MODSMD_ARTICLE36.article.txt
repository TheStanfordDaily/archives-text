# Recycling bin thefts may cripple the center

### Stacy Stern Staff writer 
A recent series of thefts from
Stanford's recycling bins has
decreased revenues from alumi
num collections by 75 percent, ac
cording to Barb Voss, director of
the Stanford Recycling Center.
Aluminum revenues account for
15 to 20 percent of the center's
operating budget, Voss said. Con
tinued thefts could "financially
cripple the center" because oper
ating costs remain constant re
gardless of how much aluminum
is collected, she added. "We may
have to reduce services to make
up for the losses."
Thefts have cost the center
about $600 so far. The main tar
gets of theft have been Sterling
Quad, Florence Moore Hall, Man
zanita Park, Stern Hall and fra
ternities. No changes have been
noticed in other materials the cen
ter collects for recycling, such as
glass or paper.

A Stanford undergraduate
called Voss last week, telling her
he saw a man taking aluminum
cans from the recycling bins at'.

He also had the license plate num--
ber of the man's car, which he
said he saw driving away and
filled with aluminum cans.
Voss responded by saying she
did not think she was going to
prosecute if the man is found.
She only wants to make it clear
that taking the cans is stealing, n
not merely scavenging.
"We would really like students
to keep an eye out for non-, (
Stanford recycling workers
removing materials from bins,",
said Voss. "Our main concern is,
to continue operative services."
"Some aluminum theft is com
mon," she said, adding these
thefts appear to be systematic.,
