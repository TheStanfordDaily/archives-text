# Students nationwide occupy buildings, clamor for change
## 
### Susan McKean Editorial staff 
It's the spring of the student. During
the past few months, students born near
the end of the last great era of student
activism have renewed the movement at
Stanford and around the country, unwill
ing to let the 1980s get by without some
noise of discontent and clamor for change.
On more than 100 campuses all over
the country this spring, students have
screamed out, interrupted business and
blocked traffic in order to make their
concerns high priority on their univer
sities' agendas.
From New York to Albuquerque stu
dents have resurrected tactics of civil dis
obedience to fight for improved
representation of minorities in American
higher education and to protest tuition
hikes and questionable hiring and fund
ing decisions.
Schools shaken up by activism this
spring include Rutgers University in New
Jersey, Sarah Lawrence College in New
York, 35 law schools nationwide, Fresno
State, Smith College in Massachusetts,
Wayne State in Nebraska, Massac
husettes Institute of Technology and
many others.
! Educational institutions have been
Reacting in differing ways to this informal
and varied movement, which Rev. Jesse
Jackson two weeks ago called "the
modern day civil rights movement" when
he spoke to Stanford's Agenda for Action
coalition.

In responding to the May 15 occupation
of University President Donald Kennedy's
office, Stanford turns out to have taken
a more punitive stance than many other
administrations have in similar in
stances. During the protest. Stanford of
ficials called the police in to make arrests
and charged the student demonstrators
with violating the University's Policy on
Campus Disruption, which has previously
resulted in penalties ranging from a letter
of reprimand to, in one case, expulsion.
Only at Rutgers, where students seized
buildings to protest a tuition hike, and
at University of Massachusetts, where
students also occupied buildings to
protest military-funded research, were
arrests also the chief institutional re
sponse, according to information
available to The Daily.
At many other universities, students
have received complete amnesty for their
occupation of administration buildings.
At City University of New York, where
thousands of student demonstrators
caused gridlock in Manhattan for four
days, no students were arrested for pro
testing.
Stanford's reaction, according to Dean
of Student Affairs James Lyons, is coinci
dent with its history and its policy. Stan
ford "historically has taken a very firm
stand on disruption and enforcement of
the disruption policy — to the point that
some judicial process is almost inevita
ble," he said.
Although University officials contacted
other universities during the occupation

to check if the demonstration was part
of a larger student collaboration, Lyons
said he was not well aware of other stu
dent demonstrations this spring.
Rut, according to CUNY Vice Chancel
lor Jay Hershenson, university policy and
history in general may not be as influen
tial as a university leadership's sympathy
for the cause.
After students occupied administration
buildings at 16 of the 19 CUNY schools
citywide from April 24 to May 5, CUNY
administrators negotiated with students
to produce an agreement awarding am
nesty to the demonstrators and providing
for most of the students' demands.
"It was clear that the (CUNY) leader
ship was indeed very empathetic, very
sympathetic to the issues. That's what
makes the difference," Hershenson said.
When New York City Mayor Ed Koch
wanted the university to bring the police
in to end the protests, the response of
the administrators was that "we don't
overreact. Instead we engaged in discus
sion and dialogue," Hershenson said.
The occupation, which started spon
taneously after hundreds marched
around campus April 24, was aimed
chiefly against a $200 tuition hike and
proposed budget cuts. New York Gov.
Mario Cuomo vetoed the tuition hike May
16, and restored some of the funds for
the university budget.
In addition, the students negotiated
with the administration to form an ad
hoc committee to look into the creation
of an Asian-American Studies program

and won their demands for extended li
brary hours, emergency exits for disabled
students, a free bus from dorms to
campus and a list of the president's
budget priorities.
Margaret Chin, a CUNY graduate stu
dent in urban studies said CUNY had
not charged tuition until the 1960s when
minority students were let in.
"Now, with 30 to 40 percent whites at
(some of the CUNY schools), this tuition
hike would have really affected the work
ing class and third world commmunity
of New York City, because this is where
we go to college," "The admin
istration didn't wannrto cause us any
trouble, we were very lucky. If the ad
ministration had wanted to, they could
have busted us."
In an incident at Michigan State Uni
versity very similar to Stanford's, nearly
100 students occupied and sealed off the
first floor of the administration building
from May 9 to May 16. Their demands
were similar to the demands of the
Agenda for Action coalition that occupied
Kennedy's office.
Acting on the heels of a report similar
to Stanford's University Committee on
Minority Issues report, Michigan State
students called for quicker, more concrete
action in implementing the recommenda
tions of the report.
No students were arrested, no charges
were filed and, according to Julie Zasad
nya, a reporter at The State News, stu
dents "definitely feel that they've gained
what they wanted and they wouldn't

have" without the occupation.
In the takeover of the administration
building at the University of New Mexico-
Albuquerque, students staged what
Marcus Montoya, the editor in chief of
The Daily Lobo, called "the protest of
the '905."
After students, parents, faculty, alumni
and staff argued for more than two hours
in front of the school's Board of Regents
asking them to vote down a proposed 7.9
percent tuition hike, the Regents unani
mously passed it. From there, students
marched to seize the administration
building.
By 2 a.m. the next day, students had
set up a Macintosh computer to keep up
communications with people outside and
bedded down to sleep. For two weeks,
between 50 and 400 students at various
times stayed in the building. They raised
money, created their own student security
force and held a dance, literary readings
and workshops on civil disobedience and
its legal consequences.
Unlike the occupations at Stanford and
CUNY, protesters at UNM allowed uni
versity business to go on around them.
The president provided a conference room
for negotiations, which Montoya said
were "businesslike," and included mem
bers of both the new and old student
governments and some "very talented stu
dent activists."
Although the 7.9 percent tuition hike
is still in effect, an additional $200,000
has been reserved for financial aid.

of New York City, because this is where
we go to college," "The admin
istration didn't wannrto cause us any
trouble, we were very lucky. If the ad
ministration had wanted to, they could
have busted us."
In an incident at Michigan State Uni
versity very similar to Stanford's, nearly
100 students occupied and sealed off the
first floor of the administration building
from May 9 to May 16. Their demands
were similar to the demands of the
Agenda for Action coalition that occupied
Kennedy's office.
Acting on the heels of a report similar
to Stanford's University Committee on
Minority Issues report, Michigan State
students called for quicker, more concrete
action in implementing the recommenda
tions of the report.
No students were arrested, no charges
were filed and, according to Julie Zasad
nya, a reporter at The State News, stu
dents "definitely feel that they've gained
what they wanted and they wouldn't

have" without the occupation.
In the takeover of the administration
building at the University of New Mexico-
Albuquerque, students staged what
Marcus Montoya, the editor in chief of
The Daily Lobo, called "the protest of
the '905."
After students, parents, faculty, alumni
and staff argued for more than two hours
in front of the school's Board of Regents
asking them to vote down a proposed 7.9
percent tuition hike, the Regents unani
mously passed it. From there, students
marched to seize the administration
building.
By 2 a.m. the next day, students had
set up a Macintosh computer to keep up
communications with people outside and
bedded down to sleep. For two weeks,
between 50 and 400 students at various
times stayed in the building. They raised
money, created their own student security
force and held a dance, literary readings
and workshops on civil disobedience and
its legal consequences.
Unlike the occupations at Stanford and
CUNY, protesters at UNM allowed uni
versity business to go on around them.
The president provided a conference room
for negotiations, which Montoya said
were "businesslike," and included mem
bers of both the new and old student
governments and some "very talented stu
dent activists."
Although the 7.9 percent tuition hike
is still in effect, an additional $200,000
has been reserved for financial aid.
It's the spring of the student. During
the past few months, students born near
the end of the last great era of student
activism have renewed the movement at
Stanford and around the country, unwill
ing to let the 1980s get by without some
noise of discontent and clamor for change.
On more than 100 campuses all over
the country this spring, students have
screamed out, interrupted business and
blocked traffic in order to make their
concerns high priority on their univer
sities' agendas.
From New York to Albuquerque stu
dents have resurrected tactics of civil dis
obedience to fight for improved
representation of minorities in American
higher education and to protest tuition
hikes and questionable hiring and fund
ing decisions.
Schools shaken up by activism this
spring include Rutgers University in New
Jersey, Sarah Lawrence College in New
York, 35 law schools nationwide, Fresno
State, Smith College in Massachusetts,
Wayne State in Nebraska, Massac
husettes Institute of Technology and
many others.
! Educational institutions have been
Reacting in differing ways to this informal
and varied movement, which Rev. Jesse
Jackson two weeks ago called "the
modern day civil rights movement" when
he spoke to Stanford's Agenda for Action
coalition.

In responding to the May 15 occupation
of University President Donald Kennedy's
office, Stanford turns out to have taken
a more punitive stance than many other
administrations have in similar in
stances. During the protest. Stanford of
ficials called the police in to make arrests
and charged the student demonstrators
with violating the University's Policy on
Campus Disruption, which has previously
resulted in penalties ranging from a letter
of reprimand to, in one case, expulsion.
Only at Rutgers, where students seized
buildings to protest a tuition hike, and
at University of Massachusetts, where
students also occupied buildings to
protest military-funded research, were
arrests also the chief institutional re
sponse, according to information
available to The Daily.
At many other universities, students
have received complete amnesty for their
occupation of administration buildings.
At City University of New York, where
thousands of student demonstrators
caused gridlock in Manhattan for four
days, no students were arrested for pro
testing.
Stanford's reaction, according to Dean
of Student Affairs James Lyons, is coinci
dent with its history and its policy. Stan
ford "historically has taken a very firm
stand on disruption and enforcement of
the disruption policy — to the point that
some judicial process is almost inevita
ble," he said.
Although University officials contacted
other universities during the occupation

to check if the demonstration was part
of a larger student collaboration, Lyons
said he was not well aware of other stu
dent demonstrations this spring.
Rut, according to CUNY Vice Chancel
lor Jay Hershenson, university policy and
history in general may not be as influen
tial as a university leadership's sympathy
for the cause.
After students occupied administration
buildings at 16 of the 19 CUNY schools
citywide from April 24 to May 5, CUNY
administrators negotiated with students
to produce an agreement awarding am
nesty to the demonstrators and providing
for most of the students' demands.
"It was clear that the (CUNY) leader
ship was indeed very empathetic, very
sympathetic to the issues. That's what
makes the difference," Hershenson said.
When New York City Mayor Ed Koch
wanted the university to bring the police
in to end the protests, the response of
the administrators was that "we don't
overreact. Instead we engaged in discus
sion and dialogue," Hershenson said.
The occupation, which started spon
taneously after hundreds marched
around campus April 24, was aimed
chiefly against a $200 tuition hike and
proposed budget cuts. New York Gov.
Mario Cuomo vetoed the tuition hike May
16, and restored some of the funds for
the university budget.
In addition, the students negotiated
with the administration to form an ad
hoc committee to look into the creation
of an Asian-American Studies program

and won their demands for extended li
brary hours, emergency exits for disabled
students, a free bus from dorms to
campus and a list of the president's
budget priorities.
Margaret Chin, a CUNY graduate stu
dent in urban studies said CUNY had
not charged tuition until the 1960s when
minority students were let in.
"Now, with 30 to 40 percent whites at
(some of the CUNY schools), this tuition
hike would have really affected the work
ing class and third world commmunity
of New York City, because this is where
we go to college," "The admin
istration didn't wannrto cause us any
