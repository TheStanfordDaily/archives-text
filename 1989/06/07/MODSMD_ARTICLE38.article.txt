### Ken Yew Staff writer 
Assoc. Dean of Graduate
Studies Cecilia Burciaga will take
over fall quarter the implementa
tion of the more than 100 recom
mendations made by the Univer
sity Committee on Minority Is
sues.
Appointed to a one-year term
as Senior Associate Provost/Af
frimative Action Officer, Burciaga
and her staff of about 12 will be
charged to "stimulate and moni
tor the progress of the UCMI rec
ommendations," according to a
statement by University President
Donald Kennedy.
Burciaga said she sees the next
year as a "positioning year" in

which the mechanisms will be
placed for the UCMI recommen
dations to be implemented. She
said her top priorities will be or
ganizing the review board and
raising funds for improvements in
the ethnic studies curriculum.
She warned, however, that stu
dents will probably not see many
sweeping changes while they at
tend Stanford.
"It must be exhausting from a
student perspective to see these
issues resolved," she said. "It of
ten takes two or three Yirs to
see any real change." Hrwever,
current Stanford students may see
"a new Stanford" as alumni, she
said.
Burciaga will chair an annual
review panel that will assess the

status of University minority is
sues and decide what needs to be
done to improve minority life on
campus.
History Prof. Albert Camarillo,
UCMI chair, said Burciaga's ap
pointment was a "good choice."
"Cecilia is an administrator on
one hand and on the other hand
a member of the minority com
munity," he said, mentioning Bur
ciaga's involvement in drafting the
UCMI report as well as her role
as resident fellow in Casa Zapata.
Alejandro Sweet Cordero, press
representative for MEChA, the
Chicano/Latino student organiza
tion, said Burciaga has "excellent
qualifications" as "the highest
ranking Chicano administrator in
the University."
