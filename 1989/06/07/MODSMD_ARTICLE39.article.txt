# RFs urge DA not to punish protesters

### John Wagner Editorial staff 
Thirty-six resident fellows have
sent a letter to the Santa Clara
County district attorney urging
that misdemeanor charges be
dropped against the students in
volved in the May 15 takeover of
University President Donald Ken
nedy's office.
However, the RF's plea will
"probably not have much of an
effect." according to Asst. District
Attorney Tom Fahrenholz.
"We look at cases on their
facts," Fahrenholz said. "As I see
it, there is reason to charge
them."
The RF's letter was addressed

to District Attorney Tim Black
wood, who passed the letter to
Fahrenholz, the assistant district
attorney handling the protesters'
misdemeanor charges.
The text of the letter appears
on page 7 of today's Daily.
In their letter, the RFs claim
the takeover of Kennedy's office
was "in every respect an affair of
the Stanford community" and "in
volved exclusively members of the
University community."
Consequently, the letter urges
the district attorney to dismiss
the state charges and allow the
students to face the consequences
of their actions solely according
to University judicial policy.
"These students are not rebel

lious or delinquent teenagers," the
letter states. "They are prodding
the University to make changes
in curriculum, staffing and other
areas for the benefit of students
of color, of all students and of the
University community."
According to Fahrenholz, once
the University called in Santa
Clara County Police to make ar
rests, the state's prosecution of
the students followed as a matter
of policy.
Because protesters were cited,
they will have to appear at court.
Kennedy said May 24 that the
University has a long-standing
policy of not interfering with the
district attorney's discretion or
"trying to affect it."
