# The
						COP debate that never was
## 
### John Wagner Editorial staff 
Former Council of Presidents
member Leonard Adler came
away unsatisfied in his efforts
during the past week to schedule
a debate with current COP
members concerning their role
in the Agenda for Action coali
tion.
Two outgoing COP members,
David Brown and Stacey
Leyton, and two incoming COP
members, Brown and Ingrid
Nava, were arrested in the
takeover of Kennedy's office. In
addition, money was removed
from the COP Expense Account
to be used as a loan for bail, to
"temporarily" pay towing
charges for a University van
which blocked the police bus,
and to produce Agenda for Ac
tion fliers.
During last Wednesday's
ASSU Senate meeting, Adler, a
COP member during the 1987-
88 school year, challenged out
going and incoming COP mem
bers to debate the role they
played in the coalition which or
ganized the May 15 takeover of
University President Donald
Kennedy's office.
Adler said he posted a debate
invitation on the COP's office
door last Thursday. In the let
ter, Adler wrote that he had
arranged for the debate to take
place 7 p.m. Monday at Durand
House. He wrote he assumed
the COP would be present un
less he heard from them by noon

Saturday.
The noon
deadline passed
without a COP
response.
According to
Brown, COP
members were
too busy to re
spond to Adler
by his proposed
deadline.

In an effort to confirm the
scheduled debate time, Adler
stopped by the ASSU offices
around 4 p.m. Monday. He ran
into Brown in the business of
fice, where Brown informed him
that the COP would not have
time to debate him that night.
Adler, who said he thought
Brown had spoken for himself
and not on behalf of the COP,
followed Brown back to the COP
office. When Adler arrived,
Brown was on the phone with
his mother.
Adler then began what he said
was a "productive discussion"
with Nava, who was also in the
COP office at the time.
Nava said she reiterated to
Adler the fact that the COP
would not have time to debate
him.
Adler persisted, she said, in
sisting that surely at least one
of the COP members could give
up an hour of their time to
debate him.
"To me, he was implying we
weren't very responsible to stu
dents," Nava said.
Brown then asked Adler to

leave, claiming
he had already
received his an
swer and was
merely harass
ing Nava.
Adler said he
thought
Brown's re
quest was out of
line, given that

he was speaking with Nava and
not Brown.
"I mean, (Nava) has a mind
of her own, doesn't she?" Adler
said.
After Adler persisted ques
tioning Nava, Brown yelled at
Adler to leave the COP office.
Brown told Adler if he did not
leave the premises, he would get
others to assist Adler in leaving.
Adler said he perceived
Brown's words as a physical
threat.
Brown said his words were
not meant as a threat. "It was
nothing at all," he said. "I might
have said a couple of swear
words. He was surprised be
cause I've never yelled at him
before."
"We weren't going to spend
our time debating him during
Dead Week," Brown said. "I felt
like it wouldn't be the most pro
ductive way to address the is
sues."
Brown said he thought an
open forum discussion next
year, focusing more generally on
the role of student government,
would be more appropriate.
