## Disappearing dog days yield memories of Stanford sports

"Dogs best epitomize the meaning of
summer because they are the one species
that lives it all year round."
— Robyn Weisman, columnist,
The Stanford Daily, May 21, 1985
Unfortunately, the dog days are dis
appearing.
Time has come for this mutt
to take leave of Stanford, to stray away
from the water dish and go explore the
rest of the backyard.
The memories of Stanford I'll be taking
away are innumerable, but above all,
Stanford to me was about winners.
Whether it was another national title for
the tennis team, a rally by Rinc-in-exile
to beat the Biz school 12-11 in the 1987
IM Softball B-League, or Monopoly games
into the midnight hour, life was hardly
ever down on the Farm.
There is no single way to characterize
all the aspects of winning at Stanford.
So, to borrow from Cyrano de Bergerac,
here are 20 ways to do so.

Simplistic:
NCAA Champions. Again.
Pervasive:
I hear that Chris Evert is having a
baby — she's been recruited to play for
Stanford in 2007.
Magnanimous:
Sure, we'll let someone else win a Col
lege World Series for a change — but
just this once.
Archaic:
Don't worry, we can get a half-court

seat at Maples at tipoff time.
Uninitiated:
Hey you in front! Sit down! I can't see!
Argumentative:
Todd Lichti could too pitch as well with
his left hand as his right.
Prophetic:
I see pastures of Green leading the
Cardinal 11 to fields of Rose.
Compromising:
Or at least the Aloha Bowl.
Organic:
Winning all these NCAA titles kind of
grows on you, doesn't it?
Patient:
Not to worry. Janet will be here shortly.
Puzzled:
How are they going to find room to
keep adding tennis balls to the NCAA
Champions T-shirt?
Waffling:
Tara VanDerveer is the best coach at
Stanford. No, it's Richard Quick. No, it's
Mark Marquess. No, it's . . .
Inquisitive:
Where is that yellow cart?
Elegant:

1 must say, sir, that I no longer sub
scribe to the theory that we won't score
a touchdown from inside the 10.
Frustrated:
When, volleybaJlers, when?
Melancholy:
Oh, to lay on the grass at Sunken
Diamond one more time.
Insatiable I:
OK. We must keep improving. Next
year, women's tennis plays no doubles
matches. None.
Insatiable II:
Cardinal. A color. Why a color?
Commemorative:
Stanford stuns No. 1 Arizona.
Alliterative:
When will wayward Winona wander
where Woodland Hills waits?
I've not often been one to avoid the
self-indulgent, and why stop when I'm
on a roll. Since it's Dead Week — my
last Dead Week — here are my final
farewells.
To Mark Rogowsky, I leave a 48-inch

vertical leap and a Croix de Candlestick.
To the Shark, an Emily Post guide to
better manners. To Chris Crader,
Honolulu at Christmas. To Rob Portnoy,
one fast break with the Lakers. To Evan
Costello, three strikes in the 10th frame.
To Chris Myers, effulgent, antediluvian
headlines for all your stories. To Cy
Fialko, a baseball sun-hop-and-barley
filled afternoon with an Eric Davis base
ball card. To the Mackster, whatever you
can get, and to The Daily, my phone
number for a mixed-metaphor hotline.
To "Ace" Gorn, I leave a double date
for you and Elvis with the Judds.
To the guys in the Suites, I leave Park
Place and Boardwalk. To Rinc '85-'B6,
more trips to the beach. To Robyn, who
is 5-foot-4, knows a lot about Brady
Bunch trivia and likes to date a lot, a
winner-take-all wrestling match. To
GregAndßeth, 1,000,000 composition
books. To Mom, a butter-and-sugar sand
wich; to Dad, a foul ball; and to my dog
Isis and everyone else out there, a tennis
ball on the grass for you to lay back and
ignore.

that lives it all year round."
— Robyn Weisman, columnist,
The Stanford Daily, May 21, 1985
Unfortunately, the dog days are dis
appearing.
Time has come for this mutt
to take leave of Stanford, to stray away
from the water dish and go explore the
rest of the backyard.
The memories of Stanford I'll be taking
away are innumerable, but above all,
Stanford to me was about winners.
Whether it was another national title for
the tennis team, a rally by Rinc-in-exile
to beat the Biz school 12-11 in the 1987
IM Softball B-League, or Monopoly games
into the midnight hour, life was hardly
ever down on the Farm.
There is no single way to characterize
all the aspects of winning at Stanford.
So, to borrow from Cyrano de Bergerac,
here are 20 ways to do so.

Simplistic:
NCAA Champions. Again.
Pervasive:
I hear that Chris Evert is having a
baby — she's been recruited to play for
Stanford in 2007.
Magnanimous:
Sure, we'll let someone else win a Col
lege World Series for a change — but
just this once.
Archaic:
Don't worry, we can get a half-court

seat at Maples at tipoff time.
Uninitiated:
Hey you in front! Sit down! I can't see!
Argumentative:
Todd Lichti could too pitch as well with
his left hand as his right.
Prophetic:
I see pastures of Green leading the
Cardinal 11 to fields of Rose.
Compromising:
Or at least the Aloha Bowl.
Organic:
Winning all these NCAA titles kind of
grows on you, doesn't it?
Patient:
Not to worry. Janet will be here shortly.
Puzzled:
How are they going to find room to
keep adding tennis balls to the NCAA
Champions T-shirt?
Waffling:
Tara VanDerveer is the best coach at
Stanford. No, it's Richard Quick. No, it's
Mark Marquess. No, it's . . .
Inquisitive:
Where is that yellow cart?
Elegant:

1 must say, sir, that I no longer sub
scribe to the theory that we won't score
a touchdown from inside the 10.
Frustrated:
When, volleybaJlers, when?
Melancholy:
Oh, to lay on the grass at Sunken
Diamond one more time.
Insatiable I:
OK. We must keep improving. Next
year, women's tennis plays no doubles
matches. None.
Insatiable II:
Cardinal. A color. Why a color?
Commemorative:
Stanford stuns No. 1 Arizona.
Alliterative:
When will wayward Winona wander
where Woodland Hills waits?
I've not often been one to avoid the
self-indulgent, and why stop when I'm
on a roll. Since it's Dead Week — my
last Dead Week — here are my final
farewells.
To Mark Rogowsky, I leave a 48-inch

vertical leap and a Croix de Candlestick.
To the Shark, an Emily Post guide to
better manners. To Chris Crader,
Honolulu at Christmas. To Rob Portnoy,
one fast break with the Lakers. To Evan
Costello, three strikes in the 10th frame.
To Chris Myers, effulgent, antediluvian
headlines for all your stories. To Cy
Fialko, a baseball sun-hop-and-barley
filled afternoon with an Eric Davis base
ball card. To the Mackster, whatever you
can get, and to The Daily, my phone
number for a mixed-metaphor hotline.
To "Ace" Gorn, I leave a double date
for you and Elvis with the Judds.
To the guys in the Suites, I leave Park
Place and Boardwalk. To Rinc '85-'B6,
more trips to the beach. To Robyn, who
is 5-foot-4, knows a lot about Brady
Bunch trivia and likes to date a lot, a
winner-take-all wrestling match. To
GregAndßeth, 1,000,000 composition
books. To Mom, a butter-and-sugar sand
wich; to Dad, a foul ball; and to my dog
Isis and everyone else out there, a tennis
ball on the grass for you to lay back and
ignore.
