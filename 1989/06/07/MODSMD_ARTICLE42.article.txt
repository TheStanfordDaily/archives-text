# Athletes of the Year
## 
### 
Throughout the past year, Stanford sports fans have had the opportunity to see countless individuals excel on their respective
fields of play. Each week, The Daily has recognized two of these athletes for their achievements. With the year now coming to a
close, the senior sports staff has chosen to honor two of the most special of these performers as The Daily's Athletes of the Year.

It is quite true there were a
number of men who gave
amazing athletic performances
this year. It is quite true three
or four of them performed up
to the level required to be named
The Daily's male Athlete of the
Year.
It is also quite true that
despite all this, Todd Lichti is
the clear choice.
The greatest player in Stan
ford basketball history. The
holder of more than a dozen
school records. The 6-foot*4
guard who executed a reverse,
two-handed slam dunk against
California and drew the foul.
The man who executed the Ar
izona Wildcats last January.
Of all the players who have
played basketball in the Pacific
10 Conference, no one has scored
more points in league games. No
Stanford basketbal player has
scored more points — ever.
The amazing stories begin ear
ly. After coming to Stanford,

Lichti started all but five games
his first season. And he started
most of them as a 6-4 forward.
Despite facing bigger players al
most every night, Lichti finished
the year as the team's leading
scorer.
As a sophomore, he was moved
to his natural position, off guard,
and continued to improve. He
again led the squad in scoring
and was an All-Pac-10 performer
for the second straight year.
One year ago, he again led the
team in scoring and was again
honored as an all-league selec
tion.
Finally, in 1988-89, the senior
really showed his stuff. He
averaged 20 points, five
rebounds and three assists per
game and was only the third
player ever to be named to the
All-Pac-10 team four times.
The most virtuoso perform
ance in his Cardinal career came
in Stanford's upset of No. 8 Ar
izona at Maples Pavilion on Jan.

5. Lichti scored 27 of his career
high 35 points in the second half
to lead the Cardinal comeback.
Other highlights include 12-of
-12 shooting from the floor
against Furman; a streak of 40
consecutive made free throws; a
28-point, 11-rebound effort
against USC; and his game
wining follow shot at the buzzer
against Washington.
He was named the Pac-10
Player of the Week three times
this year, was a third-team All-
American and was one of 10
finalists for the Associated
Press's Player of the Year award.
He never averaged less than 17
points per game in his four years
here and is in the school's top
10 in career rebounds.
Lichti shot 56 percent from the
floor this year and hit 87 percent
of his free throws. He set school
career records in games played,
field goals made, free throws
made and three-point shooting
percentage.

Going along with the greatest
Stanford men's basketball player
of all time is a junior who may
well be remembered as the
greatest women's basketball
player in Cardinal history when
she graduates next June.
Jennifer Azzi, beating out
NCAA singles champion Sandra
Birch of the women's tennis team
by the slenderest of margins, is
The Daily's female Athlete of the
Year.
From the outset of the 1988-
89 season, it became apparent
this was to be a landmark season
for Azzi and the Cardinal. In
Stanford's 119-62 drubbing of
Wisconsin in the opener, Azzi
recorded 15 points and dished
out six assists, close to her
season-endinp averages of 16.6
points and 6.6 assists per game.
Azzi recorded double-figure
scoring tallies in 28 of Stanford's
31 games Incidentally, the Car
dinal also won 28 games over
the season.
Eighteen of those wins came

during the Pacific 10 Conference
season, where Stanford became
the first team in league history
to complete a perfect 18-0
season. It was the first Pac-10
title for the team.
It was also an 18-game show
case for Azzi, who earned Pac-10
Player-of-the-Year honors over
the reigning Cherie Nelson of
USC, who led the league in scor
ing by a sizable margin. Azzi
rated lower in that category but
placed higher in three others,
including a top rating in assists
and top-five finishes in three
point shooting and free throw
percentages.
In the one matchup with USC
where Nelson played, the March
9 game at Maples Pavilion, Azzi
had her best showing to date.
She dazzled a national ESPN
audience with 25 points and 12
assists, one of her seven double
doubles during the season.
Her career best, however, was
yet to come. In the Midwest Re
gional final against the host

team, No. 3 Louisiana Tech, Azzi
single-handedly brought the No.
4 Cardinal to the verge of a Final
Four berth with a 30-point per
formance against the toughest
defense in the nation. Once
again, her career best was
televised live on ESPN.
But the highlight of her
season came well after the finale
at Ruston. Azzi was accorded the
highest honor in collegiate wom
en's basketball when she was
named a Kodak All-American,
the only junior named to the
team.
As if all the other accolades
were not sufficient, she has also
been selected as a member of
the 12-player U.S. National
Team which will compete in
Brazil this summer for the world
championship
It was an incredible season for
Stanford's all-time assist leader
and most prolific three-point
shooter. Next year may prove
even more unbelievable.
