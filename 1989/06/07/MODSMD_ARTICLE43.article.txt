# Track athletes conclude NCAAs

### Greg Gottesman Staff writer 
Like a complicated plot in a
novel, this year's 1989 NCAA
Track and Field Championships
were filled with both endings and
beginnings for Stanford athletes
Patty Purpur, Brian Boggess,
Erica Wheeler and Peggy Odita.
In terms of endings, the 1989
NCAA meet always will be
remembered as the last of Pur
pur's career at Stanford. For some
reason, even a second-place finish
in the shotput and a seventh in
the discus did not do justice to
Purpur's truly awesome four
years on the Farm.
Purpur threw a 51-9V4 in the
shotput and a 164-8 in the discus,
both marks well below her best
throws of the year. Yet, despite
not having her best meet at the
NCAAs, the four-time senior Ail-
American will undoubtedly be
remembered as the class of her
class in track and field.
But the NCAAs also repre
sented a beginning. They were a
beginning for Boggess, a junior

shotputter who went to the
NCAAs with a dream of becoming
an All-American. Dreams do not
always come true, but for Boggess
this one did.
With a personal best throw of
60-1, Boggess finished seventh in
the meet, quaifying him as an
All-American. The top eight shot
putters receive this distinction.
Only one week ago, Boggess
said, "My ambition would be to
get All-Ainerican status... . That
would definitely be the next thing
I would like to do. That's what
I'll push for."
With that goal now behind him,
Boggess sets his sights on even
greater heights next year. "That
was Brian's first national meet,"
Stanford Asst. Coach Betsy Ric
cardi said. "He went out there
with the goal of being an All-
American. He handled himself
like a champion and that's why
he did what he did."
For Wheeler, a senior javelin
thrower with one more year of
eligibility, the NCAA meet was
both an ending and a beginning.
Coming off a 1988 in which she

won the Pacific 10 Conference
Championships and took second
in the NCAAs, Wheeler was sup
posed to do amazing things in
1989. But a shoulder injury, which
will be operated on in early June,
and technique problems kept
Wheeler from performing to her
maximum level.
"It was strange because I had
such a great beginning this year,"
Wheeler said. "But then a shoul
der injury and a few other things
just kept me down."
Wheeler did not make the final
round in the NCAA javelin com
petition, saying that a problem in
technique cost her success in the
meet. "It was definitely a disap
pointment," Wheeler said.
"It was just this one problem
in technique that didn't allow me
to do what I wanted to. Otherwise
I was fine. My competitive spirit
and drive were there."
Despite her finish, Wheeler was
optimistic about her next year of
eligibility. "I definitely want to
compete in the NCAAs again,"
Wheeler said. "I don't want to
end on that note."
