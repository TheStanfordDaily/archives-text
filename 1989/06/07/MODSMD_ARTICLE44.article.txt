# Women's crew team takes third place

### Andrew Wilcox Staff writer 
Stanford women's crew Coach John Davis made
two predictions before Sunday's U.S. Collegiate
Rowing Championships in Madison, Wis.: that
Pacific 10 Conference champion Washington
would be the team to beat, and that Stanford
had an excellent shot to knock off the favorites.
He was right on one account as the Cardinal
defeated the Huskies with unexpected ease, but
Cornell foiled Davis's other prognostication by
rowing an impressive race to capture the national
crown.
Although Wisconsin, rowing with a home-lake
advantage, squeaked out second place over the
Cardinal, Stanford achieved its highest finish
ever with the bronze medal. Pre-race favorite
Washington rounded out the field in fourth after
a surprisingly lackluster effort.
The Cardinal got off to an uncharacteristicly
poor start in the race, falling behind Cornell and
Wisconsin immediately. Usually one of the teams
strong points, Davis called Sunday's opening the
team's "worst of the year."
"We didn't pick up the pace and we weren't
together for about the first 100 meters," junior
Diana Olson said.
Once the team settled into a groove, they began

to make up ground on Cornell and Wisconsin,
who had taken advantage of the Cardinal s weak
start to open sizable leads over their West Coast
adversaries. Stanford continued to close the gap
and at the finish line appeared to have caught
the Wisconsin boat.
As it turned out, the Cardinal had missed out
on the silver by a scant half second, pulling in
with a time of 5:38, behind Wisconsin's 5:37.5
and Cornell's 5:34.9.
The valiant comeback effort by the Cardinal
was thwarted more by the length of the course
— which at 1,800 meters was 200 meters shorter
than a normal course — than by Wisconsin. Once
the team had recovered from its poor start, Stan
ford gained ground on Wisconsin throughout the
race.
"We were capable of second because we were
gaining ground at the end and we had been
working on distance work in practice," junior
captain Heather West water said.
Washington's last-place finish was perhaps the
most surprising aspect of the race. The Huskies,
who had never been defeated by Stanford, also
started slowly and could never muster a come
back, finishing five seconds behind the Cardinal.
Missing from the field were top-ranked
Radcliffe and Princeton, who were competing in
regattas in Europe, according to Davie.
