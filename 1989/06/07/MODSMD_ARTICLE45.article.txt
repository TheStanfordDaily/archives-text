Card finally
NCAA bound!
Once every 47 years.
The battle cry for the
Stanford men's basket
ball team in 1988-89
was a constant re
minder the squad hadn't been in
vited to the NCAA tournament
since winning it in 1942.
Opening the season ranked
20th by the Associated Press, the
team had a season to remember
as it compiled a 26-7 record and
wound up ranked 13th. On March
12, the NCAA selection committee
invited Stanford to be the No. 3
seed in the East Regional.
It was a promise fulfilled for
the team's six seniors — Todd
Lichti, Howard Wright, Terry
Taylor, Eric Reveno, Bryan
McSweeney and Scott Meinert —
as they traveled to Greensboro,
N.C. with hopes of continuing
their winning ways.
Unfortunately, it was not to be.
The young upstarts from little
Siena College, in upstate New
York, rode a lifetime-best per
formance from a 5-foot-ll water
bug named Marc Brown past the
best Cardinal team since 1942.
The defeat couldn't tarnish the
memory of a great season, how
ever. Maples rocked like it never
had before as the Cardinal posted
a 13-0 home mark.
The season was highlighted by
a national TV victory over Flori
da, the first road sweep in Wash
ington since the early 19605, a
26-point pounding of California
and the first win over UCLA in
Los Angeles since before the flood.
Of course, the highlight that
shone above all others was . . .

Hoops downs
'Cats again
On Feb. 4, 1988, the
Arizona Wildcats came
storming into Maples
Pavilion with the na
tion's No. 1 ranking.
That night, the upstart Cardinal
cagers scored a stunning 82-74
victory over the 'Cats.
Eleven months and one day lat
er, Arizona was back on the Farm
looking for revenge.
The Wildcats exploded out of
the gate and, when the dust
settled, led the shell-shocked Car
dinal 21-4. It appeared there
would be no Miracle at Maples
this time.
Instead of throwing in the
towel, though, Stanford started
throwing the ball through the
hoop. By halftime, the lead was
cut to 10. Legend has it that Todd
Lichti stood up on a table in the
locker room and shouted, "If I
have anything to say about it,
we're not going to lose this game."
Lichti had a lot to say about it
as he turned in one of the most
virtuoso performances the sell-out
crowd of 7,500 had ever seen. He
scored 27 points in the second
half, the most dramatic of those
coming on a coast-to-coast drive
past three Arizona players cul
minating in a layup over Matt
Muehlebach. Lichti was fouled on
the play and sunk his free throw.

As the buzzer sounded, the
scoreboard read 83-78. The Car
dinal faithful stormed the court
to celebrate the team's dramatic
comeback win.

Netters sweep
to 4th in a row
One of the hardest
things to do in sports
is play the role of the
favorite. It's easy to go
out as an underdog,
with nothing to lose, and play
tough. But when you are expected
to win, the pressure is intense
each and every match.
Perhaps the most pressure
filled situation is when you're
unanimously ranked No. 1 in the
nation and are expected to win
every match. In that situation,
the Stanford women's tennis team
went 29-0.
With five Ail-Americans return
ing from the team that brought
home the NCAA title in 1988 and
two fine freshmen coming in, the
Cardinal was ranked No. 1 from
Day One. But despite having
every opponent gunning for them
every time they took the court,
the netters finished the regular
season at 25-0. In fact the team
was challenged only a few times
and was picked as a clear favorite
to repeat.
No one, however, thought that
the team would sweep through
the NCAA team tournament by
winning 25 of 26 matches, includ
ing a 5-0 win over third-ranked
UCLA in the NCAA final. After
winning the title, the team's
fourth in as many years and the
sixth in the past eight years,
Coach Frank Brennan called this
year's squad the best he's ever
seen, including previous unde
feated NCAA championship teams
Brennan coached in 1982 and
1984.
Sports
Tennis: Top dog
down in Athens
For the men's tennis
team, there's no place
like a second home. Es
pecially, when that sec
ond home is located in
Athens, Ga.
Given no chance by almost
anyone to defend their national
championship at the beginning of
the season, the squad entered last
month's NCAA championships as
the No. 1 seed.
The Cardinal came out strong
in its opener against Miami, scor
ing a 5-1 victory. Next up for Stan
ford was LSU, and the Tigers
promised to be tough.
Not too tough, though, as the
Cardinal roared past the boys
from the bayou and headed for
the semifinals.
South Carolina was all that
stood between the Cardinal and
a chance to repeat. But a veteran
Stanford squad shot down the
Gamecocks by a 5-2 score.
In the championship match,
host Georgia had 5,000 woofing
fans cheering them on and still
couldn't dethrone Stanford. The
Cardinal won the national title
for the ninth time in the 13 years

the tournament was held in Ath
ens.
Freshman Alex O'Brien was the
most valuable member of the
squad during NCAAs. He didn't
lose a match, in singles or doubles,
during the team competition.

Swimmers win
one Quickly
A new coach. A lot of
new freshmen. Only a
little time to get used
to each other. A na
tional title.
At the start of the 1988-89
women's swimming season, the
team was training under the
men's coach and a graduate assis
tant who swam for the squad just
the year before. The head coach,
Richard Quick, had just been
hired but before he came to Stan
ford from Texas, he served as the
head coach of the U.S. team in
the 1988 Olympics.
Quick arrived in the middle of
October, and after a period of ad
justment, he earned the swim
mers' trust and they earned his.
After reading Swimming World
magazine's college preview issue,
running under the headline of
"Florida in a Runaway," the Car
dinal decided to make the maga
zine eat its words.
Despite winning only two of 21
events (Jenna Johnson in the 100-
yard butterfly and Michelle
Griglione in the 400 individual
medley) Stanford won by 63 Vi
points as the favored Gators took
third. The Cardinal's team depth
and a collection of lifetime-best
performances carried Stanford to
its first NCAA title in women's
swimming since 1983.

Elway gets
the axe
After having an Elway
associated with Stan
ford football for the
past nine years, the
Cardinal gridders will
try something new this fall. John
Elway graduated after the 1983
season as one of the top quarter
backs in school history and his
father. Jack, took over the head
coaching duties the following
season. But after compiling a 25-
29-2 record over five seasons, Ath
letic Director Andy Geiger fired
Elway Dec. 5.
One month later, Geiger an
nounced the hiring of Dennis
Green, then a San Francisco 49ers
assistant coach, as the Cardinal's
new coach.
Elway coached the Cardinal to
the Gator Bowl (a 27-21 loss to
Clemson) in 1986 but the team
was a mere 3-6-2 in 1988. Al
though the Cardinal was in a po
sition to win 10 of the 11 games
this past season, the team sput
tered near the end zone and El
way's play-calling took the blame.
Although Elway stated when he
was hired that coaching was 80
percent recruiting and 20 percent
coaching, it was the 20 percent
that did him in. Elway has always
had good recruiting classes but
many people thought he did not
do enough with the talent he had.

Evans is
a Card
It's not every day you
win a national title.
But after signing a
triple Olympic gold
medalist to a letter of
intent, the Cardinal women's swim
team just may win every year.
After coaching the Texas
women to five consecutive na
tional titles, Richard Quick moved
on to Stanford. His first act here:
leading the underdog Cardinal to
its first national championship
since 1983. His second act:
recruiting what could be the best
class ever.
leading the way is Janet Evans,
the Olympic champ in the 400-
meter and 800-meter freestyles
and the 400-meter individual
medley. The holder of three world
records comes to the Farm as per
haps the most highly-touted
swimming recruit ever and, com
bined with three other newcomers
and the returning talent, Stanford
will be the favorite to repeat in
1990.
Evans was torn between Texas
and Stanford her senior year of
high school and received an ex
tension from the Office of Under
graduate Admissions to increase
the length of time she had to make
her choice. She called Quick May
10th and asked him to fly down
to her home in Southern Califor
nia and the following day she an
nounced she signed with Stan
ford.

Tami's heroics: a
comeback de-Laux
Everyone has their fa
vorite comeback. Some
may like the Toronto
Blue Jays' comeback
from a 10-0 dtftdl
against Boston Sunday. Others

may prefer the Stanford men's
basketball team's erasing of a 21-4
deficit against Arizona in Janu
ary. Still others may call Paul
Carey's two-out grand slam
against LSU in the 1987 the
greatest comeback of all time.
Anyone who was at the USC
tennis stadium April 8, 1989, how
ever, would have seen one that
would rank with any of them.
Tami Whitlinger, Stanford's No.
1 singles player and the nation's
top-ranked player, trailed USC's
Trisha Laux 5-1 in the third set
of a tense match. Unfortunately
for Whitlinger, she was so ill she
could barely stand, let alone
return the shots of the hardest
hitter this side of Iron Mike
Tyson.
Wliitlinger started putting balls
in play, however, and forced Laux
into mistake after mistake while
Whitlinger hit winner after win
ner. Soon it was 5-2, then 5-3,
5-4, 5-5. Whitlinger took the lead
by holding serve, Laux did the
same, and it was time for a tie
breaker.
Whitlinger started strong,
giving Laux enough rope to hang
herself. Final score: Whitlinger 7-
4 in the tiebreaker; Stanford wins
the team match 6-3.

Spikers bounce
the Rainbows
At the start of the
season, the Cardinal
men's volleyball team
was ranked fifth na
tionally. Not bad, con
sidering the team lost two starters
from a squad that went only 5-13
in league play the year before.
But with Olympic gold-medalist
Scott Fortune and Ail-American
Dan Hanan back, the team had
high hopes for 1989.
Afler opening league play with
a hard-fought win over Loyola
Marymount, Stanford had back
to-back home matches against No.
1 Hawaii the last two days of
January. With Hanan on the
bench suffering from the flu and
starter Craig Forsyth out with
lacerated fingers, the Rainbows

beat Stanford 15-4, 15-12, 15-3 in
the first match.
Hanan returned to the starting
lineup the next night, but Hawaii
still took the first two games. But
with Forsyth also out on the floor,
and Fortune coming alive, Stan
ford turned around the match,
and the season, by taking the final
three games of the match. After
that confidence-building victory
Stanford grabbed a No. 2 national
ranking, finished 25-6 and
reached the school's first-ever
Final Four, losing to UCLA in the
NCAA final.

Cagers among
Elite Eight
The Cardinal
women's bas
ketball team's
year-end scor
ing binge is
among the impressive stories of
1988-89. The team opened the
season scoring a Pacific 10
Conference-record 119 points in a
57-point win over Wisconsin,
giving the NCAA a sign of what
was to come.
After losing a pair of games to
top-20 teams on the road to fall
to 6-2, the team went on a school
record 22-game winning streak.
The team completed the first 18-0
season in Pac-10 history by scor
ing 107, 95, 108, 100 and 104
points in the last five league
games of the year, then entered
the NCAA tournament.
After polishing off Illinois State
105-77 in the opening round, the
Cardinal hammered eighth
ranked lowa 98-74 to advance to
the regional final. There, No. 3
Louisiana Tech and the Lady
Techsters' home-court advantage
were too much for the Cardinal,
but No. 4 Stanford averaged 102 4
points over the seven-game period
prior to the loss, winning each
game by an average of more than
30 points. The Cardinal finished
the year 28-3, its best record ever.

Honorable mentions
The Jostens Invitational pro
vided the setting for a thrilling
comeback win for the women's
volleyball team. In the final of
the mini-tournament, the Cardi
nal fell behind No. 2-ranked
Hawaii by dropping the first two
games. The squad battled back to
pull out the fifth game 15-5, on
Oct. 8 .. .
Led by Coach Berhane Andeber
han, the women's soccer team
went from perennial also-ran to
national powerhouse. The team
earned its first-ever top-20
ranking in mid-October . . .
Running back Jon Volpe had a
vintage year on the gridiron. In
Seattle, Volpe rushed for 220
yards Oct. 29. At year's end, he
was only the third back in Stan
ford history to rush for 1,000
yards in a single season .. .
On Nov. 11, water polo's Erik
Blum scored an unbelievable
seven goals against the aquafling
ers of Troy. Coach Dante Det

tamanti couldn't remember an in
dividual feat of such magnitude
... It was one of the more bizarre
contests in the long history of Big
Game this past Nov. 19. The
Golden Bears seemed certain to
break a 19-19 deadlock as time
was running out. But a Robbie
Keen field goal was blocked by
Tuan Van Le on the game's final
play to preserve the tie ...
In a disappointing year for the
two-time defending College World
Series champion baseball team,
one moment stands out above the
rest. Mike Mussina, who missed
most of the year due to shoulder
tendinitis, two-hit California on
Feb. 24. In the 2-0 shutout, Mus
sina allowed but one walk while
striking out 12 . . .
Sandra Birch took the collegiate
tennis world by storm as she blew
past the field in the NCAA indi
vidual championships. The Stan
ford sophomore bested SMU's
Jennifer Santrock 6-3, 6-3 May
18 to capture the singles title after
knocking out teammate Lisa
Green in the semis. Birch nearly
made history by capturing the
doubles title as well. She and part
ner Debbie Graham fell in the
final.
