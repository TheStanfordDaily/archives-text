# It's an eight-way tossup for Coach of the Year
## 
### 
Along with the selection of The
Daily's Athletes of the Year, we
decided to honor a Coach of the
Year as well. Eight finalists were
chosen from the many candidates
with relative ease, but then the
problems began.
The first problem is that no
one knows exactly what coaching
is. The coach's job is to get ath
letes to win a lot of games. But
what standards can we use to
judge how well the coach does?
We can see a Todd Lichti jump
shot go swish through the net.
We can see Jennifer Azzi make
that perfect pass to give a team
mate an easy layup. Anyone can
applaud a Sandra Birch backhand
winner. The skill involved when
Dan Hanan jumps 36 inches
straight up into the air and hits
a volleyball 100 miles per hour is
obvious. But what is coaching?
Is it recruiting? Is Frank Bren
nan the best tennis coach ever
because he assembled the best
tennis team ever?
Is it developing a program?
Then who wins? Berhane An
deberhan? Tara VanDerveer?
Mike Montgomery?
How about taking talent farther
than most people thought it had
a right to go? How about Fred
Sturm, Tim Baldwin, Dick Gould,
Richard Quick? Who wins?
We decided that we just don't
know enough to choose. What
makes a volleyball coach good?
What does a tennis coach do? How
do you tell who did a better job?
There is no way to tell. So after
much hemming and hawing, The
Daily's Coaches of the Year are
Andeberhan, Baldwin, Brennan,
Gould, Montgomery, Quick,
Sturm and VanDerveer. Here, in
alphabetical order, are their
qualifications.
Berhane Andeberhan
Women's soccer
Andeberhan recently finished
his second season on the Farm,
one in which his squad finished

13-4-2 and was ranked 14th in
the nation.
He took over a program that
had gone 3-12-1 in 1986, and
against a tougher schedule posted
a 4-11-4 mark two years ago. But
it was last year when the team
burst upon the national scene.
With the first recruiting class
Andeberhan could call his own on
the Farm, the team started strong
and kept getting better. The
women reached the top 20 for the
first time ever in the middle of
October and two days later
stunned No. 5 California by play
ing the Bears to a 1-1 tie.
The strong finish was not
enough, however, to get the team
a bid to the NCAA tournament.
But with stars Jennifer Rowland,
Elise Edwards, Heather Mclntyre,
et al., returning and another top
recruiting class coming in, Stan
ford soccer could be a top-20 fix
ture for years to come.
Tim Baldwin ,
Women's golf
The women's golf team made
the NCAA tournament this year,
finishing 10th in the 17-team
field. Now, that seems easy to
understand. At the beginning of
the season, however, no one
thought that possible.
The team didn't make the tour
nament last year, its best golfer
graduated, and this year's team
included three freshmen, a soph
omore and a junior. Somehow, un
der Baldwin's guidance, the team
not only made it to NCAAs but
was a definite contender for a top
five finish.
Frank Brennan
Women's tennis
If it is a coach's job to win,
Brennan has certainly done his
job. Year after year he convinces
the top high school tennis players
in the country to come to Stanford
