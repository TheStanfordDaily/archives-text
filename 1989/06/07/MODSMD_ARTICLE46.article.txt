# It's an eight-way tossup for Coach of the Year
## 
### 
Along with the selection of The
Daily's Athletes of the Year, we
decided to honor a Coach of the
Year as well. Eight finalists were
chosen from the many candidates
with relative ease, but then the
problems began.
The first problem is that no
one knows exactly what coaching
is. The coach's job is to get ath
letes to win a lot of games. But
what standards can we use to
judge how well the coach does?
We can see a Todd Lichti jump
shot go swish through the net.
We can see Jennifer Azzi make
that perfect pass to give a team
mate an easy layup. Anyone can
applaud a Sandra Birch backhand
winner. The skill involved when
Dan Hanan jumps 36 inches
straight up into the air and hits
a volleyball 100 miles per hour is
obvious. But what is coaching?
Is it recruiting? Is Frank Bren
nan the best tennis coach ever
because he assembled the best
tennis team ever?
Is it developing a program?
Then who wins? Berhane An
deberhan? Tara VanDerveer?
Mike Montgomery?
How about taking talent farther
than most people thought it had
a right to go? How about Fred
Sturm, Tim Baldwin, Dick Gould,
Richard Quick? Who wins?
We decided that we just don't
know enough to choose. What
makes a volleyball coach good?
What does a tennis coach do? How
do you tell who did a better job?
There is no way to tell. So after
much hemming and hawing, The
Daily's Coaches of the Year are
Andeberhan, Baldwin, Brennan,
Gould, Montgomery, Quick,
Sturm and VanDerveer. Here, in
alphabetical order, are their
qualifications.
Berhane Andeberhan
Women's soccer
Andeberhan recently finished
his second season on the Farm,
one in which his squad finished

13-4-2 and was ranked 14th in
the nation.
He took over a program that
had gone 3-12-1 in 1986, and
against a tougher schedule posted
a 4-11-4 mark two years ago. But
it was last year when the team
burst upon the national scene.
With the first recruiting class
Andeberhan could call his own on
the Farm, the team started strong
and kept getting better. The
women reached the top 20 for the
first time ever in the middle of
October and two days later
stunned No. 5 California by play
ing the Bears to a 1-1 tie.
The strong finish was not
enough, however, to get the team
a bid to the NCAA tournament.
But with stars Jennifer Rowland,
Elise Edwards, Heather Mclntyre,
et al., returning and another top
recruiting class coming in, Stan
ford soccer could be a top-20 fix
ture for years to come.
Tim Baldwin ,
Women's golf
The women's golf team made
the NCAA tournament this year,
finishing 10th in the 17-team
field. Now, that seems easy to
understand. At the beginning of
the season, however, no one
thought that possible.
The team didn't make the tour
nament last year, its best golfer
graduated, and this year's team
included three freshmen, a soph
omore and a junior. Somehow, un
der Baldwin's guidance, the team
not only made it to NCAAs but
was a definite contender for a top
five finish.
Frank Brennan
Women's tennis
If it is a coach's job to win,
Brennan has certainly done his
job. Year after year he convinces
the top high school tennis players
in the country to come to Stanford
instead of going pro or to another
school, and each year, they win a
national title.
The Cardinal, 29-0 in 1989, won
the school's fourth consecutive
NCAA title and became the third
Brennan team to go undefeated
in the last eight years.
Dick Gould
Men's tennis
Dick Gould did the unbeliev
able. For the second year in a
row. No one thought his team had
a shot at the NCAA title last year,
but they won anyway. This year,
after two of his top three players
left (one to graduation, one to the
pro tour), he did it again.
Only one Cardinal player was
ranked in the nation's top 64 at
year's end, but Gould had his team
go to Athens, Ga., as the top seed
in the NCAA tournament. And
while all the other top seeds fell
by the wayside, Gould's Cardinal
swept to the school's seventh
NCAA men's tennis title in the

'80s. Gould and Stanford now
have won nine of the last 13
NCAA titles.
Mike Montgomery
Men's Basketball
Tom Davis left Stanford be
cause he felt he had no chance of
competing nationally with the
Farm's exacting admissions
standards. Two years later, using
most of the same players Davis
left behind, Mike Montgomery led
Stanford to the National Invita
tional Tournament — Stanford's
first postseason berth in 46 years.
This year, Stanford showed it
could compete with any team in
the nation, including Davis' lowa
squad. The Cardinal had its best
season since 1942, making it to
the promised land — the NCAA
tournament — and earning a No.
13 national ranking. Mont
gomery's ability to improve his
players was the key as a relatively
unheralded prep — Todd Lichti,
about who's signing The Daily
wrote, "Lichti could be the best
of the three (recruits: Lichti,
Bryan McSweeney and Derek
Bruton)" — became the top player
in Cardinal history.

Richard Quick
Women's swimming
Richard Quick hardly came to
Stanford in a good situation when
he left Texas, the school where he
won the last five NCAA titles. By
the time he was hired in August,
he was getting ready to leave for
Seoul to coach the U.S. team in
the Olympics. What he found
when he got back was 24 new
faces in a new pool. What he
turned them into was the best
team in the country.
Despite not recruiting anyone
on his team, despite starting the
season almost a month late and
despite being given no chance to
defeat Florida, Quick coached his
team to the school's first national
title since 1983 — but Quick's
sixth in a row.
Fred Sturm
Men's volleyball
The past few years, under the
tutelege of Fred Sturm, the Stan
ford men's volleyball team has
been a consistent top-10 power. All
that changed this year, however,
when, for the first time in school
history, the Cardinal spent four

weeks as the nation's No. 1-
ranked team.
After starting the season
ranked No. 6, Sturm changed
Olympic gold medalist Scott For
tune's position and convinced his
team that they could win the
NCAA title. Of course, Stanford
had never before won a postsea
son volleyball match. Sturm and
the players won three postseason
matches this year, however, fall
ing one match short of an NCAA
title.
Tara VanDerveer
Women's basketball
Freshman this year think the
Stanford women's basketball team
is a national power. They're right.
Six years ago, the team was
5-23. Five years ago the team was
9-19. Four years ago, Tara Van-
Derveer was hired. The team
made a big turnaround, and Van-
Derveer was the big reason.
VanDerveer has put together
incredible recruiting year after in
credible recruiting year and has
given her players a great hunger
to win. The team came within 12
points of the Final Four this year;
next year should be even better.
Along with the selection of The
Daily's Athletes of the Year, we
decided to honor a Coach of the
Year as well. Eight finalists were

decided to honor a Coach of the
Year as well. Eight finalists were
chosen from the many candidates
with relative ease, but then the
problems began.
The first problem is that no
one knows exactly what coaching
is. The coach's job is to get ath
letes to win a lot of games. But
what standards can we use to
judge how well the coach does?
We can see a Todd Lichti jump
shot go swish through the net.
We can see Jennifer Azzi make
that perfect pass to give a team
mate an easy layup. Anyone can
applaud a Sandra Birch backhand
winner. The skill involved when
Dan Hanan jumps 36 inches
straight up into the air and hits
a volleyball 100 miles per hour is
obvious. But what is coaching?
Is it recruiting? Is Frank Bren
nan the best tennis coach ever
because he assembled the best
tennis team ever?
Is it developing a program?
Then who wins? Berhane An
deberhan? Tara VanDerveer?
Mike Montgomery?
How about taking talent farther
than most people thought it had
a right to go? How about Fred
Sturm, Tim Baldwin, Dick Gould,
Richard Quick? Who wins?
We decided that we just don't
know enough to choose. What
makes a volleyball coach good?
What does a tennis coach do? How
do you tell who did a better job?
There is no way to tell. So after
much hemming and hawing, The
Daily's Coaches of the Year are
Andeberhan, Baldwin, Brennan,
Gould, Montgomery, Quick,
Sturm and VanDerveer. Here, in
alphabetical order, are their
qualifications.
Berhane Andeberhan
Women's soccer
Andeberhan recently finished
his second season on the Farm,
one in which his squad finished

13-4-2 and was ranked 14th in
the nation.
He took over a program that
had gone 3-12-1 in 1986, and
against a tougher schedule posted
a 4-11-4 mark two years ago. But
it was last year when the team
burst upon the national scene.
With the first recruiting class
Andeberhan could call his own on
the Farm, the team started strong
and kept getting better. The
women reached the top 20 for the
first time ever in the middle of
October and two days later
stunned No. 5 California by play
ing the Bears to a 1-1 tie.
The strong finish was not
enough, however, to get the team
a bid to the NCAA tournament.
But with stars Jennifer Rowland,
Elise Edwards, Heather Mclntyre,
et al., returning and another top
recruiting class coming in, Stan
ford soccer could be a top-20 fix
ture for years to come.
Tim Baldwin ,
Women's golf
The women's golf team made
the NCAA tournament this year,
finishing 10th in the 17-team
field. Now, that seems easy to
understand. At the beginning of
the season, however, no one
thought that possible.
The team didn't make the tour
nament last year, its best golfer
graduated, and this year's team
included three freshmen, a soph
omore and a junior. Somehow, un
der Baldwin's guidance, the team
not only made it to NCAAs but
was a definite contender for a top
five finish.
Frank Brennan
Women's tennis
If it is a coach's job to win,
Brennan has certainly done his
job. Year after year he convinces
the top high school tennis players
in the country to come to Stanford
instead of going pro or to another
school, and each year, they win a
national title.
The Cardinal, 29-0 in 1989, won
the school's fourth consecutive
NCAA title and became the third
Brennan team to go undefeated
in the last eight years.
Dick Gould
Men's tennis
Dick Gould did the unbeliev
able. For the second year in a
row. No one thought his team had
a shot at the NCAA title last year,
but they won anyway. This year,
after two of his top three players
left (one to graduation, one to the
pro tour), he did it again.
Only one Cardinal player was
ranked in the nation's top 64 at
year's end, but Gould had his team
go to Athens, Ga., as the top seed
in the NCAA tournament. And
while all the other top seeds fell
by the wayside, Gould's Cardinal
swept to the school's seventh
NCAA men's tennis title in the

'80s. Gould and Stanford now
have won nine of the last 13
NCAA titles.
Mike Montgomery
Men's Basketball
Tom Davis left Stanford be
cause he felt he had no chance of
competing nationally with the
Farm's exacting admissions
standards. Two years later, using
most of the same players Davis
left behind, Mike Montgomery led
Stanford to the National Invita
tional Tournament — Stanford's
first postseason berth in 46 years.
This year, Stanford showed it
could compete with any team in
the nation, including Davis' lowa
squad. The Cardinal had its best
season since 1942, making it to
the promised land — the NCAA
tournament — and earning a No.
13 national ranking. Mont
gomery's ability to improve his
players was the key as a relatively
unheralded prep — Todd Lichti,
about who's signing The Daily
wrote, "Lichti could be the best
of the three (recruits: Lichti,
Bryan McSweeney and Derek
Bruton)" — became the top player
in Cardinal history.

Richard Quick
Women's swimming
Richard Quick hardly came to
Stanford in a good situation when
he left Texas, the school where he
won the last five NCAA titles. By
the time he was hired in August,
he was getting ready to leave for
Seoul to coach the U.S. team in
the Olympics. What he found
when he got back was 24 new
faces in a new pool. What he
turned them into was the best
team in the country.
Despite not recruiting anyone
on his team, despite starting the
season almost a month late and
despite being given no chance to
defeat Florida, Quick coached his
team to the school's first national
title since 1983 — but Quick's
sixth in a row.
Fred Sturm
Men's volleyball
The past few years, under the
tutelege of Fred Sturm, the Stan
ford men's volleyball team has
been a consistent top-10 power. All
that changed this year, however,
when, for the first time in school
history, the Cardinal spent four

weeks as the nation's No. 1-
ranked team.
After starting the season
ranked No. 6, Sturm changed
Olympic gold medalist Scott For
tune's position and convinced his
team that they could win the
NCAA title. Of course, Stanford
had never before won a postsea
son volleyball match. Sturm and
the players won three postseason
matches this year, however, fall
ing one match short of an NCAA
title.
Tara VanDerveer
Women's basketball
Freshman this year think the
Stanford women's basketball team
is a national power. They're right.
Six years ago, the team was
5-23. Five years ago the team was
9-19. Four years ago, Tara Van-
Derveer was hired. The team
made a big turnaround, and Van-
Derveer was the big reason.
VanDerveer has put together
incredible recruiting year after in
credible recruiting year and has
given her players a great hunger
to win. The team came within 12
points of the Final Four this year;
next year should be even better.
Along with the selection of The
Daily's Athletes of the Year, we
decided to honor a Coach of the
Year as well. Eight finalists were
