# Azzi, Stevens named to U.S. National Team
## 
### Evan Tuchinsky Senior staff writer 
Having excelled wearing red
and white, Stanford's Jennifer
Azzi and Trisha Stevens will add
a little blue to their uniforms over
the summer.
Outlasting all but the elite
group in a field of 113, Azzi and
Stevens were awarded spots on
the U.S. National Women's Bas
ketball Team, which will compete
for the world championship in
Brazil this August. Included on
the 12-player squad were col
legiate stars Venus Lacy of Lou
isiana Tech and Vicky Bullett of
Maryland, along with the legen
dary Nancy Lieberman-Kline.
"It is a tremendous honor and
a tremendous experience to play
against the top competition in the
world," Stanford Coach Tara Van-
Derveer said. "It's a credit to their
determination. They'll bring a lot
to the team."
It is little surprise that Azzi,
the only junior named a Kodak
Ail-American this season, made
the team. The reigning Pacific 10
Conference Player of the Year,
Azzi averaged 16 points and six
assists per game. Even more im
pressive, she enjoyed her career
best performance in her final
game of the season, scoring 30
points against Louisiana Tech's
nation-leading defense.
The selection of Stevens, how
ever, was quite unexpected. As a

sophomore, she was one of the
younger players invited to the
try outs.
But her strong post play im
pressed the panel of 20 coaches.
Included in the panel were Van-
Derveer and National Team Coach
Vivian Stringer, whose lowa team
lost to Stanford in the Midwest
Regional mostly due to Stevens
career-high 31-point performance.
The combination of reputation
and a good tryout earned Stevens
a spot on a team she had not
anticipated qualifying for.
"I was really surprised,"
Stevens said. "I was just going
for the experience, thinking I
would stay the extra week for the
Junior National try-outs."
Azzi, displaying her character
istic excellence, shone brightly
throughout the week. Combatting
the fatigue from the multiple
work-outs, she caught the selec
tion panel's attention in the Sat
urday night scrimmage which
served as the final cut.
"Jennifer was just tearing it
up," Stevens recalled. "She was
bombing from three-point land.
When she was guarding (All-
American) Penny Toler, she shut
Penny down. She proved her All-
America status."
Sophomore Sonja Henning will
remain in Colorado Springs and
most certainly will be selected for
the Junior National team this
week. Freshman Julie Zeilstra is
also in the running for a spot.'
