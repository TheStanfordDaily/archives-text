Q. Why do mosquitos buzz
• around my ear when I
am trying to sleep?
A. According to Biological
• Sciences senior research
associate Dennis Murphy, the
disturbing and frustrating
buzz in the ear from a
mosquito means Mrs. Mosquito
is busy at work.
At night the female mosquito
buzzes around your helpless
unconcious body looking for
soft skin she can puncture to
get a "blood meal." Exposed
arms and feet are the most sus
ceptible to these annoying crea
tures, and wrists and ankles
are paticularly fancied by the

mosquito with a discriminating
palate.
These tiny female vampires
need protein to live, and choose
your blood to feast upon.
The peaceful and fun-loving
male mosquito on the other
hand only feeds on pollen and
nectar. To fertilize the female,
the male only needs sugar as
a food source.
The pitch of a mosquito's
buzz is determined by its wing
speed, according to Biological
Sciences Prof. Ward Watt. The
faster the wing speed of an in
sect, the higher the pitch.
Mosquitos have a wing speed
of several hundred cycles per
second, approximately the
"concert A" orchestras tune to.
The volume of an insects'
buzz is determined by the
geometry of the insects' wings.
Wings that produce a lot of air
turbulence, such as those of
certain bees, are very loud.
Comparitively, mosquitos are
relatively quiet insects.
Q. Why do fingernails turn
• white when you press on
tnem?
A # W r hen you press on your
• nails, or your skin, it
turns white because you are
pressing the blood out from the
skin underneath, according to
Dermatology Asst. Prof
Elizabeth Abel.
Fingernails are made of a
fibrous protein known as ker
tain, also found in different
chemical forms in hair and
skin. The common white spots
and ridges found on nails are
the result of trauma or disturb
ances to "the matrix," the area
of skin where nails grow from.
Medical conditions such as
poisoning can also turn finger
nails white.
