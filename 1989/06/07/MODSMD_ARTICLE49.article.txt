# Psychologist's research might provide clue to dynamics of Stanford's student protest
## 
### Tanya Paull 
Issues of multicultural education have been
Stanford's claim to fame in the media since
the takeover of University President Donald
Kennedy's office three weeks ago.
But for some within the academic commu
nity like Psychology Prof. Lee Ross and his
research group, the events surrounding the
takeover were also significant examples of the
dynamics of conflict negotiation.
Ross is investigating the barriers — partic
ularly psychological barriers — that prevent
conflicting groups from reaching agreements.
Ross, who is also a faculty member at the
Stanford Center on Conflict and Resolution,
has primarily investigated how bias and un
fairness are perceived.
Ross explained that internal biases and er
rors in judgement are very often important
factors that resist conflict resolution. One of
the most apparent of these is a phenomenon
Ross calls "reactive devaluation," a tendency
for one side to automatically devalue any com
promises or concessions offered by the other
side, simply because it was their adversary
who offered them.
In their paper on the subject, recently sub
mitted for publication to the Journal of Per
sonality and Social Psychology, Ross and
graduate students Constance Stillinger, Mi
chael Epelbaum and Dacher Keltner describe
demonstrations of reactive devaluation among
Stanford students.
Undergraduates were asked to rate different
proposals for the University's withdrawal of
investments from South Africa. Some students
were told that certain proposals were endorsed
by the University.
Consistent with their hypothesis, the re
search group found that the students devalued
whichever of the compromise proposals that
had been supposedly offered by the adminis
tration.
After a specific plan had been adopted, a
majority of students then rated the plan less
favorably than when it had just been a sug
gested compromise.
In a related experiment, residents of Palo
Alto were asked to evaluate the terms of an
arms reduction compromise between the
United States and the Soviet Union. Some
respondents were told the proposal had been
suggested by Gorbachev, for some it was
ascribed to former President Reagan, and for
others it was neutral third party.
The results of the study were dramatic in
showing that when Reagan was the supposed
originator of the plan a clear majority felt
that it favored the United States. But if they
were led to believe that Gorbachev had sug
gested it, the majority felt that the same
proposal disproportionately favored the Soviet
Union. The plan was judged as equally favor
able by people who thought it had originated
from a neutral party.
Are these kinds of misconceptions and
judgement errors just typical of the average
person on the sfreet, or are they also true of
negotiators in real-life disputes? Ross is con
vinced that errors like reactive devaluation

are probably made in most negotiations, often
leading to unnecessary escalation of conflicts.
"It all stems from a basic premise of social
psychology," he said. "Everyone has a different
social reality, but we respond to each other
as if we all are seeing the world in the same
way."
For example, he explained, the University
makes a proposal to minority groups on
campus and expects it to be received charitab
ly. But the proposal involves flexibility and

long-term solutions, which the students con
stfue as a means of avoiding the issues.
In their paper, Ross and the graduate stu
dents suggest that opposing sides exchange
lists of the all the concessions they seek and
also concessions they might be willing to trade,
in order to reduce the possibility of hidden
strategies or malevolent intentions. They em
phasize the role of a neutral third party and
also the critical importance of optimism in
negotiation.
