# Women on the pill raise concerns over possible cancer link
## 
### Jill Mathews 
For 29 years, thousands of
women at Stanford have been
taking advantage of the conven
ience and effectiveness of birth
control pills.
These women, like many
women across the country, have
reacted with alarm to recent
studies linking oral contraceptive
use and the early onset of breast
cancer.
Three studies have found in
creased risk of breast cancer in
women who started using oral
contraceptives at a young age. The
longer the women used the pill,
the higher their risk of developing
breast cancer.
According to Dr. Barbara
Peters, a gynecologist at Cowell
Student Health Center, "A num
ber of people have called and ex
pressed concern."
Cowell has not been alone.
Louise Brinton of the National
Cancer Institute said "hundreds
of women" have called for infor
mation on the potential link.
Approximately 13.2 million
women in the United States and
60 million worldwide take oral
contraceptives, which prevent
pregnancy through regulating the
body's hormones.
Each year, about 42,000 women
in the United States die of breast
cancer, making it the third
leading cause of death for women.
Approximately one out of every
11 women will develop the disease
during their lifetime. Only about
13 percent of women with breast
cancer are under the age of 45;
the disease strikes primarily post
menopausal women.
For now, many women who ap
proach doctors about contracep
tion are told of the studies, but
are not necessarily warned
against using oral contraceptives.
Peters said the gynecological
staff at Cowell inform women of
the possible increased risk of
breast cancer associated with oral
contraceptive use, but that there
is "not enough evidence to war

rant going off the pill at this
time."
Assistant Prof. Robert Carlson,
an oncologist at the Stanford
Hospital, agreed: "The risk of
breast cancer as we now know it,
related to oral contraceptive use,
should not impact the decision of
whether to use oral contracep
tives."
Carlson said the new studies
are too inconclusive for doctors
to discourage use of the pill, par
ticularly in light of the benefits
of oral contraceptives, which in-

elude decreased risk of ovarian
and endometrial cancer.
Brinton said it is too early for
public health measures, such as
a warning on oral contraceptive
labels, due to the inconsistency of
the new studies with previous
findings and the benefits of oral
contraceptives use.
Although fears have come at a
time when little about the possible
link between the pill and breast
cancer is known, they have not
gone completely unsupported.
Some researchers, who pub
lished their findings last month
in the prestigious British journal
"Lancet," studied all the women
in England with breast cancer
who were under the age of 36,
and matched them with healthy

women.
They found that women who
had been on the pill for four to
eight years had a 40 percent
greater risk. For those who had
used the oral contraceptives for
more than eight years, the risk
was 70 percent higher.
A study at Boston University
has contributed to the increasing
concern. In contrast to earlier
results, researchers found that
oral contraceptive users doubled
their risk of developing breast
cancer by age 45. Use of the pill

for more than 10 years increased
risk fourfold.
A third cause of alarm has been
the re-analysis of a Centers for
Disease Control study performed
in the early 1980s. The results
had originally shown no correla
tion between oral contraceptive
use and breast cancer, but the
re-analysis pinpointed one sub
group.
Women who started menstruat
ing before the age of 13 and who
took the pill for over seven years
had 2.7 times the risk of non-oral
contraceptive users for developing
breast cancer by age 54.
According to Carlson, the final
verdict on the danger of the pill
with regard to breast cancer will
not be known until the women

who began taking the pill at a
young age reach their 50s and
60s, when breast cancer is much
more common.
"A relatively small number of
women who took oral contracep
tives at a young age are anywhere
near the age you'd expect to see
significant numbers of breast can
cer cases," said Carlson.
It will take until the beginning
of the next century before these
women provide evidence for or
against the connection, he said.
Carlson said that even if the
incidence of breast cancer among
premenopausal women doubled or
tripled, which has not been
proven, the actual number of
cases would remain very small,
since so few young women develop
breast cancer.
Although the experts are not
recommending that women stop
using the pill altogether, they do
suggest that the possible in
creased risk of breast cancer
should be considered in the decid
ing which birth control method to
use.
Several alternatives exist for
women who prefer to avoid oral
contraceptives.
Sterilization is convenient and
safe, but requires a surgical pro
cedure and can be irreversible.
Condoms provide a physical,
rather than a hormonal, barrier
to contraception. About 16 percent
of women rely on their approxi
mately 90 percent effectiveness, a
rate which increases to 99 percent
if spermicide is also used.
Condoms are inexpensive, easy
to obtain and safe. The biggest
advantage of condoms is the
protection they provide against
sexually transmitted diseases,
such as chlamydia, AIDS and geni
tal warts.
About 4 percent of women use
the diaphragm, a barrier method
which is 75 to 96 percent effective,
depending largely on whether it
is used properly and consistently.
The diaphragm, which is fitted by
a doctor, can be inserted up to
six hours before intercourse, and

must be left in for six to eight
hours after intercourse.
The diaphragm is used in con
junction with spermicidal jelly,
which must be reapplied for each
act of intercourse. Although some
women feel that the diaphragm
is inconvenient, the device has no
side effects, and provides some
protection from sexually trans
mitted diseases and cervical can
cer.
The intrauterine device — bet
ter known as the lUD — is in
serted into the uterus by a
physician, and it makes the uterus
uninhabitable for fertilized eggs.
Although the lUD is very effec
tive, and the woman can forget
about the device once it has been
inserted, it has been associated
with increased risk of pelvic in
flammatory disease, which can
cause infertility.
The sponge, which fits over the
cervix, relies primarily on sper
micide for its contraceptive effec

tiveness of 80 to 90 percent. The
sponge is safe and easy to obtain,
and provides some protection
against sexually transmitted dis
eases.
The sponge can be inserted up
to 24 hours before intercourse,
and can be used for up to 24
hours. However, it must be left
in place for 6 hours after inter
course, for a total of no more than
30 hours of use. The sponge may
increase a woman's risk of the
rare toxic shock syndrome, but
only limited data are available be
cause this method is new.
One method which may be
available in the future is the im
plantation of plastic capsules
containing the hormone proges
terone under the skin of the upper
arm.
