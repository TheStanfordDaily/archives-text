## A 						Vietnamese woman works to heal victims from both sides 
### Leslie Teicholz Editorial staff 
Le Ly Hayslip (born Phung Thi Le Ly)
was born and raised in Ky La, a farming
village in Central Vietnam. Brought up
in a traditional, close-knit Buddhist fam
ily, her mother and father taught their
sixth child to be a dutiful daughter and
a hard worker, to love God and honor
her ancestors. They did not teach her
how to placate two conflicting armies at
once, how to watch the destruction of her
village, how to endure rape, torture and
the death of her brothers — these were
lessons the Vietnam war was to bring.
Today, Hayslip lives in San Diego with
her three sons. She has founded the East
Meets West foundation, a non-profit or
ganization that helps those who suffered
during the war both by raising money to
rebuild Vietnam, and by sending Amer
ican veterans back to Vietnam to help
them overcome this traumatic experience.
"When Heaven and Earth Changed
Places," published this month by
Doubleday, is Hayslip's wrenching ac
count of the Vietnam war from a perspec
tive rarely seen — that of a Vietnamese.
During a recent publicity tour, The Daily
was privileged to meet with Hayslip at
the San Francisco home of her co-author,
Jay Wurts. Following are excerpts from
this interview, in which Hayslip discusses
her background, her reasons for founding
the East Meets West foundation, and her
hopes for the future of U.S.-Vietnam re
lations.
Daily: Tell me, why did you decide, in
1986, to go back to Vietnam?
Hayslip: Well, first of all, I had to see
my mother before she died. Each winter
that came, I worried that she wouldn't
be able to take the cold and the wet —
and every year there was a heavier flood.
So I applied for a visa in 1985 and finally,
in 1986, I got it. My main reason then
was to see her before she died. That was
the only thing I wanted at that time: to
see my mother.
Daily: Was it difficult to get a visa to
go back to Vietnam?
Hayslip: Yes, it took me two years.
Daily: Was that because the American
government was against it, or because
the Vietnamese government was against
it?
Hayslip: Both. First, I wrote letters,
to everyone from President Reagan all
the way down to the lowest man in the
city. But no one ever answered them. So
I found my own way to get to Vietnam
through a person in the United Nations;
he told me what to do. It took two years
to process the letters and get a visa.
When I got there (in 1986), what struck
me most was the poverty. You know, I've
been here so long — it is so easy and so
rich. So when I saw what Vietnam was
like, I coudn't continue living knowing
my people were so poor. It doesn't matter
whether it's North or South Vietnam.
It's all poor — it's always been poor. I
was born in a poor country, and I grew
up as a poor person; how could I just
forget it? So after 1986, I sold my res
taurant in San Diego and I put all my
energy into the foundation, my work.
Daily: Tell me about the foundation.
Hayslip: Well, I wanted to bring the
Americans back (to Vietnam) for two
reasons: I wanted to change the American

image of the Vietnamese enemy, the Viet
Cong, whatever they call it .. . and also,
I wanted to change the (Vietnamese)
image of the Americans. I didn't want
the children, the younger generation to
think that the Americans were bad . . .
(we must go there because) the Viet
namese people have no opportunity to
come to the United States.
Daily: How did the American veterans
react to the idea of going back to Vietnam ?
Hayslip: The first group was of course
nervous — but after three or four days,
they saw the warmth of reception and
all the children — there was just no way
that they could keep any hatred or bad
feelings about the Vietnamese anymore.
The veterans changed.
Daily: Was it difficult to get that initial
group together? It seems so counter
intuitive, to want to go back to the site
of such a miserable experience.
Hayslip: Well, you know, there is some
thing there for them that is not finished.
When the Vietnam vets go back, they
say, "The war is (finally) over."
You see, they enjoy it — they feel com
plete, they feel that they can go home
now and rest. I'll tell you the truth, every
veteran who was in Vietnam wants to go
back . . . after Vietnam, they did not want
to go back to the United States, even
though Vietnam is so poor. They have
something there, like me.
And that is what I am trying to do:
bring them to Vietnam. For instance, say
East meets West raises $20,000 for a
clinic. I'll take five or 10 volunteer vet
erans who will work together with the
Vietnamese to serve, to build this clinic.
And (through their work) they become
heroes! They become good people! Why?
Because they're building something, not
destroying — they're saving life, not kil
ling life. This is what brings a man into
reality.
Daily: And despite the war, the Viet
namese people are nice to the Americans
when they go there?

If something happened to me and my children
were starving to death, if you were my neighbor,
wouldn't you come over and help my children?
That is what human rights are about.

Hayslip: Very kind. We forgive very
easily, because we know that there is
purpose in life, that everyone does what
they must do. ~Tt is balance: yesterday
the weather was bad, today it is good.
I'll tell you a story. In the war, there
was an American GI who came to the
village near my village and burned it all
down. Recently, he went back, and looked
for a particular house and the lady who
owned that house. And he went to her
and said, "I am the one, I am the one
who burned down your house. I just
wanted to come back and tell you that
I'm sorry." And she looked at the house,
and she looked at him, and she said, "I
have a better house now."
You see, that is it — she laughed about
it. And for 20 years he couldn't sleep,
knowing that he burnt down her house
as she stood there hopelessly with her
child.

Daily: In your book, it seems that your
ability to forgive comes from your strong
feeling of family and ancestry, the tradi
tions your parents handed down to you.
You talk about remaining true to your
ancestors —
Hayslip; Yes, that is the root of it.
That is the heart of the Buddhist family:
You accept life, for good or bad times,
and you don't condemn others too much.
And you forgive. We are all trying to get
out of the cycle of reincarnation — we
want to go home (to Heaven) and stay.
All you can do is pay — take it, take it,
take it and pay. Don't complain. And my
family was so strong — everyone had a
role to play. You know, in my village,
most the houses were burned down,
destroyed, but my house still stands.
Daily: Why?
Hayslip: Because my mother and
father always worshiped our ancestors.
We always thought of how we could serve
them. We took care of the sick, we cared
for the homeless ... we sacrificed a lot
for the people in our village.
My family is in the upper middle-class
in our village — lots of rice paddies, etc.
— and we had a lot of respect in the
village. And so my father played an im
portant role. As a young child, when my
brothers and sisters were all gone, I was
the only one he could teach. And he
taught me a lot. I wish he were here
today to see what I'm doing, but the
truth is he knows. My orders are from
him; the words that I speak now, they
are from him.
Daily: Yes, in fact in your book you
say that after your father's death, he spoke
to you through a medium. Can you
describe that?
Hayslip: Well, we have three kinds of
mediums. This kind of medium (for
funerals) is not supposed to know any
thing about our family; he should be a
stranger from a totally different village.
And when he came to us, my father's
soul entered his body, and the man's own

soul stepped out. So he was like a robot,
controlled by my father. And my father
guided him to the cemetary where he
was buried, and through him divided the
land to all of us and gave us any messages
he wanted to tell us.
Daily: That's hard to accept as a west
erner with no strong religious back
ground . ..
Hayslip: Yes — and that's what I find
sad. But then, we are 4,000 years old.
And you are only 200.
Daily: As a young girl, you worked for
the Viet Cong. Is that right?
Hayslip: Yes, but before that we
worked for the South Vietnamese army.
We built schools, warehouses . . . we did
a lot of things. But then, during the
night, the Viet Cong would come and
say, "Everyone has to redo everything
they did the day before" — and we would
do what the Viet Cong made us do. And

then the next day the South Vietnamese
would come and say, "Take all of that
down and do what we told you to do."
Daily: So you were caught in the
middle?
Hayslip: Yes. Exactly. Nighttime we
had to work for one army, daytime we
had to work for the other. That's how
we lived our lives. And all we wanted
was to be farmers. We didn't want to be
in the South or the North. We just wanted
our little family, working seven days a
week, 14 hours a day. We'd come home
and feed the husband, wife, children . . .
we'd catch our fish in the pond ... we
had vegetables in the garden. That was
all. Children would be all around, and
the grandmothers would watch them.
That was our family: That is the Viet
namese tradition.
Daily: And from your book it sounds
like when you went to Saigon, you saw
these traditions breaking down.
Hayslip: Yes, it was completely differ
ent. We spoke a different language. You
see, when the war came, the villagers
could either get out of the village or get
killed — that was the choice. And (in the
city) the only thing we could do was
housekeeping, where we'd get pregnant
by our employers, or become prostitutes.
Daily: Tell me, do you feel that the
Vietnamese have maintained their very
strong sense of community in America?
Hayslip: Yes, but not as strong, of
course. The Vietnamese people are doing
well here because they have confidence
in themselves and they're willing to work
very, very hard.
America is an opportunity for people
like the Vietnamese ... it proves we have
strong roots. But one thing I'm very sad
about is that the Vietnamese people here
do not look back and help the Vietnamese
in Vietnam. They think the Vietnamese
are commoners. They will let them die.
But sooner or later, we're going to
return back to Vietnam. How can we say,
"Today I have a better house, a better
car — I'm not going to take care of those
people." Remember, we are Vietnamese,
whether or not they are commoners,
whoever controls the country of Vietnam.
It is not ours to judge. If the Vietnamese

people are not working, we need to find
ways to train them, not let them die.
Just yesterday I talked to a group of
people and one guy told me not to deliver
medicine to the hospital in Vietnam. I
asked him, "What if you saw somebody
who'd cut off his leg and was bleeding
to death, and you knew you could help
him. Wouldn't you do that?" And he said,
"Yes but they (the Communist govern
ment) won't do that." And I said, "How
do you know?"
If something happened to me and my
children were starving to death, if you
were my neighbor, wouldn't you come
over and help my children? That is what
human rights are about.
Daily: And yet you said that even your
brother, Bon Nghe, had trouble welcom
ing you back home in 1986 because you
were capitalist.
Hayslip: Yes, that's right. But my
mother sitting in the middle of us, what
does she know? She doesn't know the
difference between a communist and a
capitalist. And I've been here for 18 years,
and I don't think I know more than my
mother. What's communism got to do
with the children when they're starving
to death?
Daily: How do you feel about Vietnam's
current government ?
Hayslip: I feel sorry for them, because
they knew how to fight and win a war,
but they did not know how to win the
people after they'd won. After the war,
the Vietnamese people did a lot to support
the new government — but the govern
ment turned everyone against them.
Daily: How did they turn everyone
against them?
Hayslip: They came in and took every
thing from the people, dug up the graves
... for the first five years, I heard such
awful stories of the things they did. And
now, they admit they made mistakes.
Daily: What were they trying to do in
those first five years?
Hayslip: Well, they were trying to turn
everyone into communists. But you can't
do that! People are people! The best thing
is to give people freedom. We always
obeyed our ancestors and whomever was
in control ... we had no trouble with
that. We just wanted to be left alone.
But whoever's in control always wants to
change everything. That's why the South
lost the war in the first place. But that
lesson is never learned . . .
Daily: If there were one message you
could give the American people, what
would it be?
Hayslip: To accept people as they are,
and love them. To unite, not divide. If
we could turn everything upside-down
— if I could become white-skinned with
brown hair and blue eyes so you'd love
me better — I'd do so. But I can't do
that. We can unite the United States and
Vietnam with love and compassion and
rebuild Vietnam. We just need to give
more of ourselves to society, to pay back
what we've been given.
