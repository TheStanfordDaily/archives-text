# Porcelain, a fragile shield against Prague oppression

### Utz" By Bruce Chatwin Viking, $16. 95

Porcelain is the antidote to
decay.
So concludes Kaspar Utz, the
eccentric Czech collector who is
the namesake to this final work
published by Bruce Chatwin
before his untimely death in Jan
uary.
For Utz, a middle-age bachelor
living in communist Prague, the
delicate ceramic figurines that
decorate his two-room apartment
and which have consumed his im
agination since boyhood also pro
vide a solution to the cultural
dreariness of the State and the
vacant hours of an obsessive man.
The porcelain of Messein is
Utz's specialty, and from this
remote corner of the artistic map
Chatwin creates a larger parable
of the relationship between the
collector and the collected, be
tween the world of art and the
world of experience.
Chatwin made his first splash
in the literary world with "In
Patagonia," an account of his
wanderings though South
America published in 1977, and

he brings something of the
traveler's perspective to "Utz."
Though he occasionally writes
through Utz's point of view, the
story is told principally through
the eyes of a visitor — a young
historian who looks the collector
up while on a research excursion
to Prague.
The "Prague Spring" of 1968
looms but a year away, and its
spirit flutters suggestively about
the narrative. There is talk of

Kafka, of Schubert's Trout Quin
tet, of betrayals at Yalta, of the
individualism of Don Juan, and
even of the anarchy of the com
mon housefly. Though we know
that this fine season will end with
the brutal roaring of Soviet tanks,
that story is not the big story
here: This is above all a tale of
porcelain.
And thus the political rhetoric
of "Utz" is most interested in the
oversights of Socialism when they
refer to the topic at hand:
"Marxist-Leninism had never got
to grips with the concept of the
private collection. Trotsky,
around the time of the Third In
ternational, had made a few off
hand comments on the subject.
But no one had ever decided if
ownership of a work of art
damned its owner in the eyes of
the Proletariat. Was the collector
a class-enemy? If so, how?"
The thorny question of private
art collections is one that Czech
Marxism never quite resolved.
Thus Utz, whose activities in the
Messein arts were flourishing at
the time of the Socialist take-over
and the Stalinist repressions, was
permitted to keep his figurines —
provided that he agreed to donate
them to the State upon his death.
There is a charming middle in

terlude which relates Utz's jour
neys abroad, numerous
opportunities to defect to the
West, and eventual decision to
remain with his collection in
Czechoslovakia — even to smuggle
treasures into the country.
The man of high culture, sick
ened by the excesses of the West,
throws himself back behind the
Socialist curtain, where, the
fragile existence of his porcelain

threatened, his objects are made
more vulnerable, more valuable.
As a young man Chatwin
worked for Sotheby's, the English
auction house, and his knowledge
of the art world manifests itself
in a striking fluency with artistic
detail.
It is this well-trained eye that
he exercises in first describing
Utz's collection: "Arranged along
the longer set of shelves were
plates, vases, flagons and tureens.
There were tea-caddies of polished
redware . . . tankards with silver
gilt mounts; teapots with 'Wat
teau' scenes; teapots with
eagle-headed spouts and teapots
painted with goldfish, after Chi
nese and Japanese models. . . .
Pride of place, however, was given
to a Swan Service tureen: a
Rococo fantasy on legs of inter
twined fishes, the handles in the
form of nereids, the lid heaped
high with flowers, shells, swans
and a bug-eyed dolphin — which,
but for the bravura of its execu
tion, would have been a
monstrosity."
These figures stand at the gate
of a rich historical grove Chatwin
opens for us, a chronology of por
celain from its invention in
medieval China to its rebirth in
18th century Saxony under the

auspices of "Augustus the
Strong." Here Chatwin's prose
holds court with its mix of fact
and fiction, of artistic instruction
and satire.
A train of epic figures crosses
Utz's porcelain stage — Marco
Polo and Kubla Khan, the Biblical
Adam, Frederick the Great, the
philsopher Leibnitz, Father Mat
teo Ricci, countless Saxon and
Prussian princes, and of course
