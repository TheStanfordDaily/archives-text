# The
						Caddie's pink, the movie stinks

The problem with seeing movies
at the Century 10 these days is
how cool the "Batman" previews
look. Once you've seen them, it's
hard to concentrate on whatever
movie you're seeing.
Not that "Pink Cadillac" de
mands a whole lot of concentra
tion. In fact, it's probably a good
idea if you don't think too hard
during it. If you do, the plot holes
and loose ends will trip up your
enjoyment of Clint Eastwood's
genial self-mockery.
The other problem at Century
10 last weekend was the technical
foul-ups. I was hoping that the
sight of Clint Eastwood pummel
ing white supremacist goons would
cure the metaphysical aspects of
my hangover, but to my dismay I
discovered that I couldn't even go
to the movies right.
There was no sound at the
matinee show, and in the evening
show the projectionist, who must
have been sharing my DTs, burned
a hole in the film right before the
climax (the movie's, not mine).
Eastwood's face began disintegrat
ing and melting on screen, as if
in some fantasy sequence directed
by Sondra Locke.
Back to the movie. "Pink Cad
illac" is an uninspired, fairly dopey
action-comedy which has a couple
of surprisingly clever, funny mo
ments. Eastwood is the most en
tertaining thing in it, but for dif
ferent reasons than you'd expect.
He plays Tommy Nowak, a "skip
tracer" who tracks down people
who've skipped out on their bail
bondsmen. He does this by using
a lot of disguises, a gimmick which
lets Eastwood poke fun at his

tough-guy image.
When he transforms himself
into a bargain-basement lounge
lizard, donning a cheesy pencil
mustache and a nightmare of a
gold lame jacket, Clint looks like
he's having a lot of fun. He also
does an imitation of Bernadette
Peters at one point, fluttering his
eyes and affecting a little girl's tone
of voice. It's an amusing bit which
is actually startling — this is Clint
Eastwood?
The ever-wacky Bernadette
Peters plays the wacky LuAnn, a
woman stuck in a lousy marriage
to a petty crook. When the slime
for a husband becomes buddies
with the local gang of white
supremacists, LuAnn takes the rap
for his counterfeiting activities. In
stead of sticking around, she grabs
her baby and skips out on her bail.
Fleeing Sacramento (which isn't
such a bad idea in itself), she heads
for Reno in that four-wheeled pop
icon, a gleaming pink Cadillac.
Little does she know that
$250,000 of the supremacists'
dough is stashed in the back of
the car. Of course they want it
back, and take off after her. So
does Nowak.
Eastwood and Peters are mildly
amusing together. Physically
Eastwood has become a caricature
of himself, with his angrily reced
ing hairline, T-square jawline, and
huge meaty fists that could prob
ably do terrible things to Sondra
Locke's lawyers. Peters looks tiny
standing next to him. Unfortu
nately, her character is the usual
wacky, nutty, ditzy, etc., Ber
nadette Peters character which gets
old really fast.
As anyone who's been to the
movies in the last year knows, you
can't turn around in the Pacific

Northwest without bumping into
some militant white supremacists.
The Birthright, as they're called
here, aren't taken very seriously.
They're the sort of generic scruffy
morons who serve as the villains
in all of Eastwood's comedies,
bumbling dopes who barely know
which end of a gun to point at
someone.
There's a good scene where
Eastwood sticks a wad of chewing
tobacco in his mouth and affects
an idiotic barroom bonhomie in
order to get chummy with the
Birthright. Trying to spout some
convincing supremacist rhetoric
("I'm lookin' fer some place where
the white man kin stand tall
again"), he slyly rolls his eyes to
show how inane he thinks it all is.
This is the kind of clever touch
that makes "Pink Cadillac"
bearable. The hapless director,

Buddy Van Horn, is a long-time
crony of Eastwood's, which must
be how he got the job. Eastwood
clearly has better things to do with
his time than direct lame vehicles
like this one. He didn't even bother
to produce it, like he does with
most of the movies he stars in.
I wonder if there's a trade-off
here — Eastwood sleepwalks
through mildly entertaining for
mulaic stuff like "The Dead Pool"
and "Pink Cadillac" for Warner
Bros., and Warner Bros, agrees to
bankroll Eastwood's pet projects
like "Bird."

Mark Tompkins is graduating be

another Daily banquet. Surgeon
General Koop would like to have
a few words with him.
