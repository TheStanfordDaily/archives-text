# Not for Simple Minds

### Tim Marklein Editorial staff 
Simple Minds' latest album
is for people with anything but
the band's namesake. "Street
Fighting Years" takes the lis
tener on a journey of worldwide
conflict, stopping everywhere
but University President
Donald Kennedy's office.
The mellow-dramatic album
begins with the title track and
continues with an impassioned
look at freedom fighters around
the globe.
In the same disjointed man
ner as the protests themselves,
the out-of-synch rhythm com
bines music and lyrics in an
uncommon, appealing manner.

Lead singer Jim Kerr pulls off
the difficult task and makes the
combination work.
The song titles precisely
portray the discontent of many
people in the world who fight
daily for their basic rights. "Soul
Crying Out," "This Is Your
Land," "Let It All Come Down"
and "When Spirits Rise" express
generic feelings of reform and
revolution, while "Mandela
Day"and "Belfast Child" focus
on specific situations in South
Africa and Northern Ireland.
The band takes on a noble
but dangerous venture in its ver
sion of Peter Gabriel's classic
"Biko." But like the rest of Kerr's
experimentation, the results are
nothing short of pleasurable.
