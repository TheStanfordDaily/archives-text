In response to the Chinese government's violent
crackdown on student protesters in Beijing, Chinese
students at Stanford have taken up the cause
through protests, vigils and meetings to help the
demonstrations back home.
On Sunday, the Association of Chinese Students
and Scholars at Stanford organized a delegation of
about 300 Stanford students and their families to
join 20,000 demonstrators protesting against the
Chinese government outside China's consulate in
San Francisco.
With Stanford students leading the procession,
the protesters began at the consulate and wound
their way to City Hall, which was heavily guarded
by police. San Francisco is home to the largest
percentage of Chinese-Americans nationwide.
The demonstration was intended "to show our
will to support the students in Beijing," according
to Asst. Prof, of Mechanical Engineering Gao
Huajian, who attended the rally. An initial crowd
of about 10,000 at the Chinese consulate swelled
to twice that size as they marched through the
streets of Chinatown.
The march was marked by chants in Chinese of
"Hang Li Peng, hang Deng Xiaopeng," referring to
the Chinese premier and the senior leader, and calls
in English to "Stop the bloodshed.'' The protesters
ended their rally after marching three miles to the
Chinese Culture Center in the heart of Chinatown.
The march was followed Monday night by a can
dlelight vigil in White Plaza where 1,000 students
commemorated those who died in Bering as a result
of the crackdown.
The students burned incense and offered fruits
to the dead following an ancient Chinese tradition
of communicating with the spirits, according to
physics graduate student Peng Cheng, who partici
pated in the vigil.
Members of the Chinese student group asked the
crowd for donations that would be sent directly to
the universities in Beying. According to fundraising
coordinator Douglas Zhide Pan, a graduate student
in electrical engineering, the group collected over
$40,000, and by late yesterday, donations reached
nearly $60,000 as a result of the vigil. Pan said
many of the contributions came from Silicon Valley
corporations.
Nearly $10,000 has already been sent to the Beijing
student protesters and $2,000 was sent to the Beijing
Red Cross to pay for medicinal supplies.
