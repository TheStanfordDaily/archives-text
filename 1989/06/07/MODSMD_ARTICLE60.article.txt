# Ringing Clarke's Bell
## 
### Tim Marklein Editorial staff 
His fingers work magic on
any synthesizer and his Midas
touch turns all his projects into
gold, and sometimes even
platinum.
Vince Clarke, a founder and
former member of Depeche
Mode and Yaz, has hit another
stride with partner Andy Bell in
Erasure. Their latest EP,
"Crackers International," show
cases the incredible talent of
both in its most developed form
yet.
The early work of Erasure
bore strong resemblance to
Clarke's brilliant partnership
with Alison Moyet, with bluesy

songs like "Oh L'amour" remi
niscent of "Only You" and
"Midnight." Any Yaz leftovers
have disappeared on this album.
This six-song EP is much
freer than Clarke's past work;
he's like a kid let loose with $2
million worth of keyboards.
There are enough hooks and
grooves for anyone to be pulled
or fall into.
"Stop!", the album's first re
lease, is nothing but infectious.
Clarke layers all of his best
synth riffs into a delightful pat
tern to support Bell's excited
lyrics. The first two minutes of
the 12-inch remix version dis
play Clarke at play and dispel
any doubts as to who the genius
behind Depeche Mode really is.
