# 'Biloxi' cures the summer blues

### Elizabeth Laurence 
Viewers who held their sides
through the movie version of Neil
Simon's 1985 comedy "Biloxi
Blues" will laugh again during this
month's Palo Alto Players produc
tion.
The story of aspiring writer
Eugene Morris Jerome's coming of
age at army training camp during
World War 11, "Biloxi Blues" fea
tures a script guaranteed to tickle
your funny bone. The play should
succeed even without the superb
performances of Bill Olson as
Eugene and Rich Kueny as Ser
geant Merwin J. Toomey. Full of
one-liners tossed back and forth
by recruits whose boyish direct
ness charms and amuses, Simon's
script addresses wartime reality
with a lightness that enables the
recruits to face the frightening fu
ture lurking beyond the giggles of
the audience.
Olson and Kueny carry the play.
A high school student, Olson con
veys Eugene's bright, cautious per
sonality and, unlike some of the
recruits, deliveres his character's
witticisms convincingly.
Kueny, lapsing into a stereo
typical drill sergeant during the
first act, shines in the climax of
the second act when Sgt. Toomey
reveals his true self, well-meaning
but unstable since he sacrificed a
chunk of his steel-plated brain to
World War I. Derek Felton's
portrayal of Arnold Epstein, the
rebellious intellectual and close
friend of Eugene, also shows skill.
A late-night rap session in the
barracks reveals that his fantasy
— if he had only a week to live
— would be to become a writer,
lose his virginity and fall in love.
Two parts of this fantasy Eugene
fulfills at Biloxi. The prostitute
Rowena introduces him to the an
cient art of enlightenment. Daisy,
an improbable schoolgirl Eugene
meets at a dance while on leave,
becomes his First Love. The final
third, writing, the vicissitudes of
Biloxi eventually help him to ful
fill.

The playwright Simon also
succeeds through simplicity. This
version of "Biloxi Blues" proves the
rule: The movie is never as good.
Free from the cinematic additions
that sell visual reality for the price
of artistic reality, this play, whose
subtle set and staging do not dis
tract from the action, remains
pure. In other respects, the movie
is faithful to the play, or, if you've

already seen the film, the play is
faithful to the movie. Either way
you'll laugh.

"Biloxi Blues," a Palo Alto
Players production, plays at the
Lucie Stern Theater on Middlefield
through June 17. Tickets cost 57
to $12 and can be purchased by
calling 329-2623 or 329-2652. Stu
