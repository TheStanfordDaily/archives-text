# Hulkamania on the silver screen
## 
### Bill Fagelson Staff writer 
During Wrestlemania V, it was
announced that a movie would
be coming out starring a "Hulk
Hogan you've never seen before."
Those of us watching naturally
started a countdown toward June
2, hoping that we could get our
tickets through Bass and avoid
the rush. The tension was fur
ther built as Hulk Hogan was
repeatedly attacked in the ring
by Zeus, his nemesis in "No
Holds Barred."
As if this wasn't enough to
upset me, the night I went to
see the movie NBC news ran a
story on wrestlers, remarking
that they kept us laughing. I'd
like to see Brokaw try and survive
a steel-cage match.
Hulk Hogan plays Rip, a WWF
world champion. He is so well
known in this country that he
is practically an institution. He
has a contract with only one net
work, however, and a rival net
work wants him to switch over.
The other network is run by
Brell, a Yuppie gone power crazy
who will do anything to put them
on top in the ratings.
After failing to bribe Rip, Brell
starts a "Battle of the Tough
Guys" on his network. Through
this he comes upon Zeus, a
wrestler who was sent to prison
because he killed a man in the
ring after the bell went off.
Hogan does some great acting
here as you see his temper rise
while this is being told to him.
If you haven't figured it out
yet (or if you couldn't figure it
out knowing that Hulk Hogan
was in this), this is a very stupid
movie. I am sure that Vince
McMahon knew exactly how stu
pid it was; but what I question
is whether the Hulkster knew.
The movie plods through cliches
one after the other, until the au
dience isn't quite sure if there
ever was a plot in there some
where.

Most of the time, a movie with
this many cliches in it is funny
working on that premise. In this
movie, however, they have made
a cliche out of even that. I think
it was summed up best in the
words of someone I'll refer to as
Rob B. who said that it was "the
biggest chunk of shit" he has
ever seen.
Hulk's last appearance on the
big screen was in "Rocky III." It
looks as if here he has stolen
Sly's already dumb story and
crossed it with another bad Stal
lone screenplay — "Cobra." I
suppose this is one that has to
be seen to believe.
The movie does have its good
points, though. For one thing,
there were plenty of great shots
of Hulk's receding hairline. I also
got to see a lot of people picked
up by their necks. Brell's lines,
however, had to be the best part
of the movie. Imagine the genius
it took for the screenwriters to
come up with lines like "I eat

nice guys for breakfast."
We also get to see Hulk's
sensitive side (excuse me, Rip's
sensitive side). He has a love
interest who could best be de
scribed as a feminist's night
mare. Rip is also very dedicated
to charity work. What a great
guy.
Zeus is of course your everyday
bad guy. He's big. He's mean.
He wears black. Zeus fills the
foreign object requirement (for
wrestling bad guys) with metal
wristbands.
If you like wrestling, there's
no way you want to miss this
movie. If not, you probably
wouldn't sec it unless I told you
that William Hurt was starring
in it. Stuff this bad has got to
be admired.
At one point in the movie (I
refuse to call it a film on moral
grounds), Brell says,"America.
Don't you just love it?" I do love
it. I feel my money is well spent
on trash like this.
