# Graduating seniors: Meet the ghosts of freshmen past
## 
### Kathy Lachenauer 
Mom and Dad got pushed out
the dorm doors. It was time for
Stanford's newcomers — 1,536 of
them — to start exploring on their
own.
First stop, Memorial Auditori
um.
Despite the casual air given off
as the newcomers filed into Mem
Aud dressed in shorts and T
shirts, anxious thoughts flew
through their minds. That night,
Sept. 15, 1985, these students
were going to hear University
voices that would stay with them
for the next four years. And as
they sunk into the fake-velvet
cushioned seats of Mem Aud, th'e
newcomers had to wonder what
sort of hello Stanford would issue.
After all, they had beaten out
some pretty stiff competition —
some 16,000 other students — to
secure a spot in the Class of 1989.
Did each and every one of them
really deserve a place here?
Most definitely, yes.
That was the reassuring mes
sage students heard as the first
official University voice spoke to
them. Rather than listen to a
crotchety administrator dictate
the rules of the University, stu
dents heard someone who related
to their insecurities, voiced their
very anxieties.
"Like the victims of the so
called 'imposter' phenomenon,
you will persist in believing that
you are less qualified than your
peers and will suffer from the fear
of being found out," Dean of Ad

missions Jean Fetter warned the
nervous group.
The Stanford Ego
To build their confidence, Fet
ter went on to map out the path
of a standard Stanford ego: "You
can be reassured that the research
shows you are in good company.
And in any case, it's amazing how
quickly the timid and tentative
freshman can soon blossom into
that self-confident sophomore who
has stopped worrying about how
he or she got in and is now won
dering how on earth the others
got in."
Four years later, Fetter is still
proud of those uptight freshmen
who have turned into easy-going
seniors.
"You're the best first class I've
ever had," Fetter now tells mem
bers of the Class of 1989, the first
freshmen she admitted to Stan
ford as dean.
During her welcoming speech,
Fetter also cited a national survey
which concluded that large num
bers of 1984 freshmen "view their
undergraduate experience more as
a means to a vocational end than
as an educational or developmen
tal experience."
Fetter, however, told the then
freshmen that she believed Stan
ford students could see beyond
self-interest. She challenged them
to "contribute to the diversity of
the University" and prove the na
tional survey wrong.
Now, four years later, Fetter
believes that the class met her
challenge; she points to an in

crease in the number of students
involved in public service as proof
perfect.
Question authority
That night, Fetter wasn't the
only University leader who dared
students to make a difference.
Greeted with a standing ova-

tion, University President Donald
Kennedy urged timid freshmen to
"question authority . . . even when
it wears a tweed jacket."
Did that challenge of '85 come
back to haunt Kennedy in '89?
Students did question authority
just this May when they seized
Kennedy's office and illegally oc
cupied it for nine hours. After the
protest, Kennedy said he feared
that the incident — which ended
with more than 50 student arrests

— "wrought heavy damage" at
Stanford.
But Kennedy still holds true to
his advice in 1985. Back then, he
reminded students that question
ing "with gentle curiosity ... is
even harder to answer than in
dignation."
Today, Kennedy also points out

that when he said "authority" in
1985 he wasn't just talking about
the political authority of a Uni
versity. He hoped students would
take the initiative to question, and
improve upon, Stanford tradi
tions.
"Look at Stanford music. Stu
dents took the initiative and just
transformed music here," the
Kennedy of 1989 says, noting the
growth in the Stanford Symphony
and in Stanford's varied student

singing groups.
And Kennedy has nothing but
rave reviews for this spring's mu
sical production by the student
run Ram's Head Theatrical Soci
ety: " 'A Chorus Line' was
fabulous. I had never seen any
thing like it here," he says.
From the musical to the polit
ical spectrum, Kennedy believes
that today's seniors have effec
tively tested Stanford's commit
ment to progress and met his chal
lenge: "We've seen that there are
pretty elastic limits in what you
can get accomplished here," he
says.
Kennedy's welcome implanted
the idea of progress into the Uni
versity's freshest minds.
Coping with change
But before Stanford's new
comers got too caught up in
thoughts of the future and the
bold steps they were sure to take,
the final speaker of that night
asked students to take a look back
at a past Stanford had grown
away from.
Dean of Undergraduate Studies
Carolyn Lougee, a historian, con
jured up images from 1967, the
year most members in the Class
of '89 were born:
"In 1967, only 25 percent of
Stanford undergraduates were
women and 4 percent were ethnic
minorities. Tuition for the year
was $1,575. The [Stanford Band]
had no women, nor would it for
five more years. A study to de
termine the feasibility of turning
Lagunita into a year-round lake

came to naught. Women organized
for equal rights at Stanford, de
manding permission to live off
campus (as men could) and they
got nowhere," Lougee recalled.
Looking back on her welcome
address, Lougee says that even
though she gave a a talk about
change, she herself was caught
off guard by how quickly it actu
ally came. Stanford's swift deci
sion to revamp the Western Cul
ture requirement to a more cul
turally expansive course took
Lougee by complete surprise.
"Nobody dreamed in 1985 that
the change in Western Culture
would happen in just two years.
I was always pushing the program
but I had no idea it would evolve
so quickly," she says.
The Lougee of today can nod
approvingly at the advice she gave
students four years ago: "It will
take all the running you can do
to suit yourself for change, to
make yourself a person who can
keep abreast of change, absorb its
jolts, and continue to operate ef
fectively. "
As Lougee's speech came to a
close, each member of the 1,536-
person listening unit began to stir.
It was time to break apart and
start exploring Stanford as indi
viduals, armed with some solid
advice.
And now, as the Class of 1989
reconvenes this Sunday, Stan
ford's old-timers will go through
the same motions as that fateful
night in '85. But this time the
advice they'll hear will have to
last a lifetime.
