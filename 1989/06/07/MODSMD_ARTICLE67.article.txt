Why Garry B. Trudeau, you
ask, the former Prime Minister
of Canada? He was probably cho
sen because of his years of bril
liant statesmanship as the cham
pion of the liberal party of our
neighbor to the north.
As this year's Commencement
speaker, he will certainly share
with the graduating seniors the
wisdom of his many years as a
prominent figure in the arena of
world politics. While The Daily
regrets being unable to provide
our traditional commencement
speaker interview, the words Mr.
Trudeau will impart to the grad
uating class will more than make
up for our unsuccessful attempts
to schedule an interview with this
very busy man.
OOOPPPS!
I must confess that words can
not adequately express the em
barrassment I am presently
feeling for mistakingly confusing
the identity of this year's Com
mencement speaker. My boss, out
going editor in chief of The Stan
ford Daily, Kathy Lachenauer, has
informed me that Garry B.
Trudeau is a prominent comic
strip cartoonist and that Pierre
Trudeau is the former prime min
ister of Canada. My mistake was
certainly an easy one to make and
1 humbly offer my humble
apolgies to all injured parties.
And now, on with the article.
It seems that Garry B. Trudeau
is in fact Mr. Jane Pauley, hus
band of the famous co-anchor of
NBC's Today Show. He also hap
pens to be the creator of the
popular comic strip Doonesbury,
whose cast of characters'
humorous and extensive misad
ventures have resulted in Doones
bury being among the most widely
read comic strips today.

An important element of the
strip is Trudeau's willingness to
confront serious social and polit
ical issues through the medium
of the funny pages. While this
approach has won him widespread
public acclaim and provided him
with a large and devoted reader
ship, it has also provided him with
the attendant problems of
editorializing in the sanctified
comic pages.
Trudeau is often criticized for
his political biases and his ten
dency to go for the jugular, and
he often finds himself being cen
sored by the very newspapers
whose willingness and desire to
publish his strip created its
popularity.
Instead of dropping him from
their pages, these papers, whose
publishers and editors are of the
opposite political spectrum from
Trudeau, relegate the strip to the
editorial page, where it is just as
likely to be seen as on the comic
pages. This has the unintended
affect of showcasing Doonesbury.
Although a few papers have can
celed the circulation of his strip,
a great majority of the nation's
newspapers continue to subscribe.
The newspaper business recog
nizes the bottom line. If people
are willing to pay for Doonesbury
— often the strip's presence in a
paper has been cited as the only
reason for many readers reading
the paper — newspapers will
tolerate his politics.
Trudeau's heavily-censored
Frank Sinatra series, the "Mafia
strips" of a few years back, recalls
the controversy he is able to
generate in a medium that is not
generally held in high regard.
Although Trudeau is certainly
a direct descendant of Walt Kelly
and his then highly political and
