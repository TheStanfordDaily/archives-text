# Graduates plan to march down the aisle — and some already have

### Amy Rosenfeld 
The day after she graduates from
Stanford, Janine Duyvestein will trade
her mortarboard for a veil. Duyvestein
and fellow graduating senior Isaac
Barchas are getting married Monday.
They are not alone. Besides entering
the world of graduate schools and new
jobs, several graduating seniors are
tackling the world of marriage.
Barchas and Duyvestein met their
freshman year through the Structured
Liberal Education Western Culture
track. They've been dating for "at least
the last three years," Barchas said.
But, "unfortunately," he doesn't re
member his first impression of
Duyvestein.
Senior George Handley said he re
members a "pretty immediate attrac
tion and interest on both parts," when
he met sophomore Amy Paugh in their
church group two years ago. Handley
and Paugh will be saying "I do" three
days after graduation in Salt Lake
City, Utah.
"Weird" is the word senior Jose Sol
tero used to describe his first encoun
ter with his fiancee Stephanie Norton,
a 1988 graduate of Stanford. They
were both at an end-of-the-year party
two years ago and just sort of "hit it
off," he said.
They danced and hung out in San
Francisco until the wee hours of the
morning, he said, but "nothing really
happened." Then they both went home
for the summer. But they couldn't
write to each other because she didn't

have his address and he didn't have
her zip code, he said.
When they finally did see each other
the next fall, Soltero said he was
hesitant because he "didn't want to
get blown off." But, she was glad to
see him and four months later he pro
posed on the "spur of the moment."
It was "one of those things where
you know it's kind of the right thing,"
said Soltero, who will be marrying Nor
ton this October in Memorial Church.
But, do other Stanford students
think marriage is "the right thing?"
"People at Stanford tend to think
marriage is a scary thing," said Hand
ley, who got a "pretty mixed reaction,"
when he announced he was getting
married.
Barchas said he received similar re
sponses. "Some people think it's fan
tastic, some are terrified," he said.
Soltero and Norton had a different
problem when they got engaged — they
couldn't tell anyone. Norton did not
want to tell her parents until she saw
them in person several months later,
so they couldn't tell any of their friends
for fear her parents might find out.
They kept their secret for three
months. When they finally did
publicize the engagement, many people
told them they were too young, Soltero
said. The prospect of marriage "puts
into perspective how old you're getting
and just how young you really are,"
he said.
Despite the mixed reactions of class
mates, all said their parents were very
excited about the prospect of a new

son or daughter. "My parents are
thrilled," Barchas said. "fThey] love
Janine. I'm pretty sure they like her
more than they like me."
While some seniors will receive their
diplomas with fiances present, a few
will celebrate graduation with their
husbands or wives.
Married undergraduates are "a
whole part of campus that is pretty
much overlooked," said senior John
Torres. Torres got married in his
junior year and now lives in Escondido
Village with his wife Laura, who will
be graduating from Brigham Young
University in July.
"At Stanford, marriage is a taboo
word," he said. "I have a bunch of
friends who took until their senior year
to even start dating."
Senior Julie Widman met Azlan
Ezaddin the summer after her fresh
man year when he was a graduate
student at Stanford. Although she said
she "wasn't bowled over by him right
away," they have now been happily
married for a year and a half.
A lot of her friends were "surprised"
when she told them she was getting
married in her junior year, she said.
"People didn't know how to deal with
it very well."
Torres said his friends would "come
over and just stare at us," after he
and Laura got married. And it wasn't
just students who reacted strangely.
The woman at the housing center tried
to talk him out of marriage when he
applied for housing in Escondido Vil
lage, he said.

France Rogof at the Housing Center
estimated that there are about seven
undergraduate couples living in Es
condido Village and added that it is
"not at all" a problem for them to live
in graduate housing.
John and Laura Torres met in ninth
grade German class in Kirkland, Wash
ington. He thought her strawberry
blond hair was "exotic," and she
thought he was a "nerd," Torres said.
"If you'd told us when we were 14
that we'd be married, we'd have been
rolling on the floor laughing," he
added.
Torres said he doesn't feel like he
missed out on a lot of his undergradu
ate experience because he is married.
While he does miss "the guys" in the
dorm, he said he "didn't miss the
dating scene because there is no dating
scene."
Being married has made her "a more
content and stable and responsible per
son," Widman said.
"[Marriage] is a very self-contained
happy type of life," Torres said. He
added that his grades have even gotten
better since he's been married.
"You have to be so much more dis
ciplined about time," he said. "You
can't just lump around the dorm. You
have to think about the other person."
The graduating seniors who are get
ting married and those who are think
ing about it can take their cue from
Widman. who said "There is a lot of
comfort and companionship that
comes with being married, and if you
find the right person ..."
