# Hospital employees blame health problems on incinerator
## 
### Brad Hayward Senior staff writer 
When Sue Dollarhide used to
walk into her office at Stanford
Hospital in the morning, she often
found a layer of black grit cover
ing the desks and tables.
Dollarhide, supervisor of the
hospital's pulmonary physiology
lab, said she also smelled foul
odors and watched black ash filter
in through a ceiling vent in the
office: "It was like your own
fireplace that hadn't been
cleaned."
When Dollarhide started suffer
ing from headaches, fever, nausea,
coughing and clogged throat and
nasal passages, among other
things, she linked her symptoms
to the air quality in the office -
and she started complaining
Dollarhide is one of 10 to 12

hospital personnel who, during
the years 1981 to 1987, sustained
recurring health problems while
working in a block of third floor
offices in the hospital's core build
ing. The workers, at least four of
whom resigned because of the ail
ments, claim their problems were
due to re-entrainment of emis
sions from the hospital's waste in
cinerator.
University officials maintain
that the incinerator was upgraded
to meet and exceed design require
ments and say that the third floor
labs were likely re-entraining
their own fumes. But officials ad
mit that there may have been
lapses in the incinerator's operat
ing procedures and that isolated
incidents of re-entrainment from
the incinerator could have oc-
curred.
The health problems gradually
disappeared after both tne hospi
tal incinerator and a second in
cinerator in the Medical School
were shut down in early 1987.
But questions remain about what
materials the hospital workers
were exposed to and if the levels
of exposure were dangerous.
Also remaining is the question
of whether the University acted
responsibly in keeping the two in
cinerators operating while the
opening of a new incinerator at
the Environmental Safety Facility
was delayed almost two years.
Black 'snow'
The two incinerators, one lo
cated in the hospital core building
and the other on the fourth floor
of the Boswell building in the
Medical School, opened in the late
19505.
The hospital incinerator burned
biological and infectious waste
while the one at the Medical
School burned mostly animal car
casses, according to Ted Malloy,
operations manager at the Envi
ronmental Safety Facility and for
merly facilities engineering man
ager at the Medical Center.
Complaints from Medical Center
personnel about emissions from
both incinerators began surfacing
in the early 1980s.
"All my life I've been prone to
different sicknesses, but this was
different," said Betty Riccio, who
at the time was a receptionist in
the Neurology Department.
Workers in the Pulmonary and

Neurology Departments reported
odors persistently filtering in
through the ventilation system in
addition to ash and grit.
There were problems outside as
well. The area in question is lo
cated on one side of a courtyard
near the center of the hospital,
and the workers at one time
would eat lunch on a patio
situated off the third floor.
They soon began noticing that
ash from the nearby incinerator
stack was falling into the court
yard area and settling at the bot
tom, where an open-air eating
area and barbecue were located.
"It was like snow falling." Ric
cio said. "When you opened the
door [from the patio] it would
suck in with you."
Throughout the years they were
complaining of the poor air
quality, the workers became sick
repeatedly.
One memo details the
symptoms of nine office workers
who all fell sick during one week
in April 1987. The symptoms were
similar to those Dollarhide expe
rienced.
Dollarhide and Riccio both said
their own symptoms, and those
of others working in the area, dis
appeared after the incinerator
closed. But by that time, some
workers had called it quits.
Grimley resigned in September
1985 because of her health prob
lems. She now works in the
Radiology Department in a differ
ent area of the hospital. Three
others also resigned for health
reasons, according to Riccio.
Re-entrainment debated
The workers took their com
plaints to Health and Safety offi
cials in both the University and

the Hospital. On several occasions
safety engineers came to the site,
examined the incinerator and ven
tilation systems and held meet
ings with the workers.
Malloy said he and other safety
officials tested both the in
cinerator and the ventilation sys
tems and concluded there was no
evidence that incinerator emis
sions were being re-entrained into
the core area.
Prevailing wind patterns in the
area would make such re
entrainment very unlikely, Malloy
said. And even if smoke from the
incinerator hit air intakes, the
amount of dilution would make
the effect comparable to "drop
ping food coloring in the ocean,"
according to Malloy.
Malloy said it was more likely
that the core labs were re
entraining their own exhaust
fumes, and in 1983 he drew up
a list of recommendations for cor
recting problems in the fume hood
and ventilation systems.
The recommendations included
balancing the fume hoods, im
proving filtration and ensuring
that fume hoods with on/off
switches were running consistent
ly-
In 1985, Malloy wrote a memo
re-emphasizing the need to make
modifications in the air systems.
But it was not until 1987 that
the recommendations were ad
dressed, and the changes were not
finished until 1988.
Malloy said that though the
workers reported their symptoms
disappearing soon after the in
cinerator closed, that was the
same period of time in which the
air systems were being improved.

A weak link
At the same time as he was
recommending air system
changes, Malloy was making
various design changes to the
dilapidated incinerator to meet
the demands of changing technol
ogy. After the changes were made,
the incinerator's design was
"above and beyond all require
ments," Malloy said.
But Malloy added that "the
weak link" in the system was the
operational procedure. He said
there was no way to know if those
operating the incinerator consis
tently burned the correct amounts
at the correct temperatures.
The evidence of black smoke
and ash emerging from the stack
seemed to prove that operational
procedures were not applied con
sistently.
In his internal review of the
University's health and safety
program, University auditor Da
vid Fetterman wrote that "poorly
trained operators stuffed the in
cinerator with too much material
at one time, lowering the temper
ature" with the result that the
burner "did not completely
destroy infectious wastes."
Though Malloy's tests showed
no evidence of incinerator re
entrainment, Riccio said that
Health and Safety engineers had
told her the re-entrained fumes
were, in fact, from the incinerator.
A report by SRI International,
a Menlo Park consulting firm,
found that "the potential exists
for re-entrainment from the fume
hoods' exhausts into the medical
complex buildings" but added
that, during the years of the com
plaints, "no air sampling tests
were conducted to confirm the ex

istence of hazardous or noxious
materials in the exhaust."
'Can't go by your nose'
The SRI report concluded that
"responses to complaints of odors,
illnesses and entrainment of ash
particles to determine if problems
existed appear to have been lack
ing."
Two Health and Safety en
gineers who responded to com
plaints at the hospital, Jon Mol
destad and Mike McGuire, even
tually resigned from the Univer
sity, citing that their input on
various projects was ignored. Mol-
not comment on the
problems at the Medical Center;
McGuire could not be reached.
Malloy emphasized that the
University did not act irrespon
sibly in dealing with the in
cinerators and added, "No one I
know would have allowed it to
run if anything injurious was
coming out of there. ... By no
means did we ignore anyone's con
cerns."
"To tell whether these problems
are significant or not, you can't
go by your nose," said Alain
Decleve, at that time director of
Health and Safety. "When you're
sitting in your car you're re
entraining fumes all the time. ...
It's something you can't get rid
of. You can minimize it."
Decleve said there was no rea
son for concern about "ash on the
steaks" in the courtyard barbecue
where emissions fell out. In fact,
he said, Health and Safety re
ceived many complaints about
smoke from the barbecue itself.
A primary reason that the Med
ical Center incinerators were not
shut down sooner than they were

is that Health and Safety officials
were anticipating the opening o)
the Environmental Safety Facility
burner â€” which waa delayed over
and over because of permit and
construction problems.
In his report, Fetterman said,
"It is my personal opinion that
maintaining them in operation for
as long as we did raises ethical
problems."
But Malloy characterized the
situation as "damned if you do,
damned if you don't."
Decleve said the tradeoff was
closing the incinerators quickly
and facing certain risks by forcing
the opening of the new burner or
waiting for it to open and taking
unknown risks at the Medical
Center.
Malloy added that there were
also problems with trucking Med
ical Center waste to an off-campus
incinerator until the burner
opened. In addition to the cost
and public concern, he said, there
were more possible liabilities be
cause most hazardous waste ac
cidents occur in transport.
Now that the incinerators have
been closed for over two years,
workers have generally accepted
that they will likely never know
what materials they were exposed
to. But more health and safety
problems may be facing the Med
ical Center.
Workers in the Radiology de
partment are beginning to com
plain about gasoline odors filter
ing into their office. The landing
pad for the hospital's emergency
helicopter is located above the of
fice, and the workers claim that
the fumes come from the helicop
ter when it takes off.

and she started complaining
Dollarhide is one of 10 to 12

hospital personnel who, during
the years 1981 to 1987, sustained
recurring health problems while
working in a block of third floor
offices in the hospital's core build
ing. The workers, at least four of
whom resigned because of the ail
ments, claim their problems were
due to re-entrainment of emis
sions from the hospital's waste in
cinerator.
University officials maintain
that the incinerator was upgraded
to meet and exceed design require
ments and say that the third floor
labs were likely re-entraining
their own fumes. But officials ad
mit that there may have been
lapses in the incinerator's operat
ing procedures and that isolated
incidents of re-entrainment from
the incinerator could have oc-
curred.
The health problems gradually
disappeared after both tne hospi
tal incinerator and a second in
cinerator in the Medical School
were shut down in early 1987.
But questions remain about what
materials the hospital workers
were exposed to and if the levels
of exposure were dangerous.
Also remaining is the question
of whether the University acted
responsibly in keeping the two in
cinerators operating while the
opening of a new incinerator at
the Environmental Safety Facility
was delayed almost two years.
Black 'snow'
The two incinerators, one lo
cated in the hospital core building
and the other on the fourth floor
of the Boswell building in the
Medical School, opened in the late
19505.
The hospital incinerator burned
biological and infectious waste
while the one at the Medical
School burned mostly animal car
casses, according to Ted Malloy,
operations manager at the Envi
ronmental Safety Facility and for
merly facilities engineering man
ager at the Medical Center.
Complaints from Medical Center
personnel about emissions from
both incinerators began surfacing
in the early 1980s.
"All my life I've been prone to
different sicknesses, but this was
different," said Betty Riccio, who
at the time was a receptionist in
the Neurology Department.
Workers in the Pulmonary and

Neurology Departments reported
odors persistently filtering in
through the ventilation system in
addition to ash and grit.
There were problems outside as
well. The area in question is lo
cated on one side of a courtyard
near the center of the hospital,
and the workers at one time
would eat lunch on a patio
situated off the third floor.
They soon began noticing that
ash from the nearby incinerator
stack was falling into the court
yard area and settling at the bot
tom, where an open-air eating
area and barbecue were located.
"It was like snow falling." Ric
cio said. "When you opened the
door [from the patio] it would
suck in with you."
Throughout the years they were
complaining of the poor air
quality, the workers became sick
repeatedly.
One memo details the
symptoms of nine office workers
who all fell sick during one week
in April 1987. The symptoms were
similar to those Dollarhide expe
rienced.
Dollarhide and Riccio both said
their own symptoms, and those
of others working in the area, dis
appeared after the incinerator
closed. But by that time, some
workers had called it quits.
Grimley resigned in September
1985 because of her health prob
lems. She now works in the
Radiology Department in a differ
ent area of the hospital. Three
others also resigned for health
reasons, according to Riccio.
Re-entrainment debated
The workers took their com
plaints to Health and Safety offi
cials in both the University and

the Hospital. On several occasions
safety engineers came to the site,
examined the incinerator and ven
tilation systems and held meet
ings with the workers.
Malloy said he and other safety
officials tested both the in
cinerator and the ventilation sys
tems and concluded there was no
evidence that incinerator emis
sions were being re-entrained into
the core area.
Prevailing wind patterns in the
area would make such re
entrainment very unlikely, Malloy
said. And even if smoke from the
incinerator hit air intakes, the
amount of dilution would make
the effect comparable to "drop
ping food coloring in the ocean,"
according to Malloy.
Malloy said it was more likely
that the core labs were re
entraining their own exhaust
fumes, and in 1983 he drew up
a list of recommendations for cor
recting problems in the fume hood
and ventilation systems.
The recommendations included
balancing the fume hoods, im
proving filtration and ensuring
that fume hoods with on/off
switches were running consistent
ly-
In 1985, Malloy wrote a memo
re-emphasizing the need to make
modifications in the air systems.
But it was not until 1987 that
the recommendations were ad
dressed, and the changes were not
finished until 1988.
Malloy said that though the
workers reported their symptoms
disappearing soon after the in
cinerator closed, that was the
same period of time in which the
air systems were being improved.

A weak link
At the same time as he was
recommending air system
changes, Malloy was making
various design changes to the
dilapidated incinerator to meet
the demands of changing technol
ogy. After the changes were made,
the incinerator's design was
"above and beyond all require
ments," Malloy said.
But Malloy added that "the
weak link" in the system was the
operational procedure. He said
there was no way to know if those
operating the incinerator consis
tently burned the correct amounts
at the correct temperatures.
The evidence of black smoke
and ash emerging from the stack
seemed to prove that operational
procedures were not applied con
sistently.
In his internal review of the
University's health and safety
program, University auditor Da
vid Fetterman wrote that "poorly
trained operators stuffed the in
cinerator with too much material
at one time, lowering the temper
ature" with the result that the
burner "did not completely
destroy infectious wastes."
Though Malloy's tests showed
no evidence of incinerator re
entrainment, Riccio said that
Health and Safety engineers had
told her the re-entrained fumes
were, in fact, from the incinerator.
A report by SRI International,
a Menlo Park consulting firm,
found that "the potential exists
for re-entrainment from the fume
hoods' exhausts into the medical
complex buildings" but added
that, during the years of the com
plaints, "no air sampling tests
were conducted to confirm the ex

istence of hazardous or noxious
materials in the exhaust."
'Can't go by your nose'
The SRI report concluded that
"responses to complaints of odors,
illnesses and entrainment of ash
particles to determine if problems
existed appear to have been lack
ing."
Two Health and Safety en
gineers who responded to com
plaints at the hospital, Jon Mol
destad and Mike McGuire, even
tually resigned from the Univer
sity, citing that their input on
various projects was ignored. Mol-
not comment on the
problems at the Medical Center;
McGuire could not be reached.
Malloy emphasized that the
University did not act irrespon
sibly in dealing with the in
cinerators and added, "No one I
know would have allowed it to
run if anything injurious was
coming out of there. ... By no
means did we ignore anyone's con
cerns."
"To tell whether these problems
are significant or not, you can't
go by your nose," said Alain
Decleve, at that time director of
Health and Safety. "When you're
sitting in your car you're re
entraining fumes all the time. ...
It's something you can't get rid
of. You can minimize it."
Decleve said there was no rea
son for concern about "ash on the
steaks" in the courtyard barbecue
where emissions fell out. In fact,
he said, Health and Safety re
ceived many complaints about
smoke from the barbecue itself.
A primary reason that the Med
ical Center incinerators were not
shut down sooner than they were

is that Health and Safety officials
were anticipating the opening o)
the Environmental Safety Facility
burner â€” which waa delayed over
and over because of permit and
construction problems.
In his report, Fetterman said,
"It is my personal opinion that
maintaining them in operation for
as long as we did raises ethical
problems."
But Malloy characterized the
situation as "damned if you do,
damned if you don't."
Decleve said the tradeoff was
closing the incinerators quickly
and facing certain risks by forcing
the opening of the new burner or
waiting for it to open and taking
unknown risks at the Medical
Center.
Malloy added that there were
also problems with trucking Med
ical Center waste to an off-campus
incinerator until the burner
opened. In addition to the cost
and public concern, he said, there
were more possible liabilities be
cause most hazardous waste ac
cidents occur in transport.
Now that the incinerators have
been closed for over two years,
workers have generally accepted
that they will likely never know
what materials they were exposed
to. But more health and safety
problems may be facing the Med
ical Center.
Workers in the Radiology de
partment are beginning to com
plain about gasoline odors filter
ing into their office. The landing
pad for the hospital's emergency
helicopter is located above the of
fice, and the workers claim that
the fumes come from the helicop
ter when it takes off.
When Sue Dollarhide used to
walk into her office at Stanford
Hospital in the morning, she often
found a layer of black grit cover
ing the desks and tables.
Dollarhide, supervisor of the
hospital's pulmonary physiology
lab, said she also smelled foul
odors and watched black ash filter
in through a ceiling vent in the
office: "It was like your own
fireplace that hadn't been
cleaned."
When Dollarhide started suffer
ing from headaches, fever, nausea,
coughing and clogged throat and
nasal passages, among other
things, she linked her symptoms
to the air quality in the office -

their own fumes. But officials ad
mit that there may have been
lapses in the incinerator's operat
ing procedures and that isolated
incidents of re-entrainment from
the incinerator could have oc-
curred.
The health problems gradually
disappeared after both tne hospi
tal incinerator and a second in
cinerator in the Medical School
were shut down in early 1987.
But questions remain about what
materials the hospital workers
were exposed to and if the levels
of exposure were dangerous.
Also remaining is the question
of whether the University acted
responsibly in keeping the two in
cinerators operating while the
opening of a new incinerator at
the Environmental Safety Facility
was delayed almost two years.
Black 'snow'
The two incinerators, one lo
cated in the hospital core building
and the other on the fourth floor
of the Boswell building in the
Medical School, opened in the late
19505.
The hospital incinerator burned
biological and infectious waste
while the one at the Medical
School burned mostly animal car
casses, according to Ted Malloy,
operations manager at the Envi
ronmental Safety Facility and for
merly facilities engineering man
ager at the Medical Center.
Complaints from Medical Center
personnel about emissions from
both incinerators began surfacing
in the early 1980s.
"All my life I've been prone to
different sicknesses, but this was
different," said Betty Riccio, who
at the time was a receptionist in
the Neurology Department.
Workers in the Pulmonary and

Neurology Departments reported
odors persistently filtering in
through the ventilation system in
addition to ash and grit.
There were problems outside as
well. The area in question is lo
cated on one side of a courtyard
near the center of the hospital,
and the workers at one time
would eat lunch on a patio
situated off the third floor.
They soon began noticing that
ash from the nearby incinerator
stack was falling into the court
yard area and settling at the bot
tom, where an open-air eating
area and barbecue were located.
"It was like snow falling." Ric
cio said. "When you opened the
door [from the patio] it would
suck in with you."
Throughout the years they were
complaining of the poor air
quality, the workers became sick
repeatedly.
One memo details the
symptoms of nine office workers
who all fell sick during one week
in April 1987. The symptoms were
similar to those Dollarhide expe
rienced.
Dollarhide and Riccio both said
their own symptoms, and those
of others working in the area, dis
appeared after the incinerator
closed. But by that time, some
workers had called it quits.
Grimley resigned in September
1985 because of her health prob
lems. She now works in the
Radiology Department in a differ
ent area of the hospital. Three
others also resigned for health
reasons, according to Riccio.
Re-entrainment debated
The workers took their com
plaints to Health and Safety offi
cials in both the University and

the Hospital. On several occasions
safety engineers came to the site,
examined the incinerator and ven
tilation systems and held meet
ings with the workers.
Malloy said he and other safety
officials tested both the in
cinerator and the ventilation sys
tems and concluded there was no
evidence that incinerator emis
sions were being re-entrained into
the core area.
Prevailing wind patterns in the
area would make such re
entrainment very unlikely, Malloy
said. And even if smoke from the
incinerator hit air intakes, the
amount of dilution would make
the effect comparable to "drop
ping food coloring in the ocean,"
according to Malloy.
Malloy said it was more likely
that the core labs were re
entraining their own exhaust
fumes, and in 1983 he drew up
a list of recommendations for cor
recting problems in the fume hood
and ventilation systems.
The recommendations included
balancing the fume hoods, im
proving filtration and ensuring
that fume hoods with on/off
switches were running consistent
ly-
In 1985, Malloy wrote a memo
re-emphasizing the need to make
modifications in the air systems.
But it was not until 1987 that
the recommendations were ad
dressed, and the changes were not
finished until 1988.
Malloy said that though the
workers reported their symptoms
disappearing soon after the in
cinerator closed, that was the
same period of time in which the
air systems were being improved.

A weak link
At the same time as he was
recommending air system
changes, Malloy was making
various design changes to the
dilapidated incinerator to meet
the demands of changing technol
ogy. After the changes were made,
the incinerator's design was
"above and beyond all require
ments," Malloy said.
But Malloy added that "the
weak link" in the system was the
operational procedure. He said
there was no way to know if those
operating the incinerator consis
tently burned the correct amounts
at the correct temperatures.
The evidence of black smoke
and ash emerging from the stack
seemed to prove that operational
procedures were not applied con
sistently.
In his internal review of the
University's health and safety
program, University auditor Da
vid Fetterman wrote that "poorly
trained operators stuffed the in
cinerator with too much material
at one time, lowering the temper
ature" with the result that the
burner "did not completely
destroy infectious wastes."
Though Malloy's tests showed
no evidence of incinerator re
entrainment, Riccio said that
Health and Safety engineers had
told her the re-entrained fumes
were, in fact, from the incinerator.
A report by SRI International,
a Menlo Park consulting firm,
found that "the potential exists
for re-entrainment from the fume
hoods' exhausts into the medical
complex buildings" but added
that, during the years of the com
plaints, "no air sampling tests
were conducted to confirm the ex

istence of hazardous or noxious
materials in the exhaust."
'Can't go by your nose'
The SRI report concluded that
"responses to complaints of odors,
illnesses and entrainment of ash
particles to determine if problems
existed appear to have been lack
ing."
Two Health and Safety en
gineers who responded to com
plaints at the hospital, Jon Mol
destad and Mike McGuire, even
tually resigned from the Univer
sity, citing that their input on
various projects was ignored. Mol-
not comment on the
problems at the Medical Center;
McGuire could not be reached.
Malloy emphasized that the
University did not act irrespon
sibly in dealing with the in
cinerators and added, "No one I
know would have allowed it to
run if anything injurious was
coming out of there. ... By no
means did we ignore anyone's con
cerns."
"To tell whether these problems
are significant or not, you can't
go by your nose," said Alain
Decleve, at that time director of
Health and Safety. "When you're
sitting in your car you're re
entraining fumes all the time. ...
It's something you can't get rid
of. You can minimize it."
Decleve said there was no rea
son for concern about "ash on the
steaks" in the courtyard barbecue
where emissions fell out. In fact,
he said, Health and Safety re
ceived many complaints about
smoke from the barbecue itself.
A primary reason that the Med
ical Center incinerators were not
shut down sooner than they were

is that Health and Safety officials
were anticipating the opening o)
the Environmental Safety Facility
burner â€” which waa delayed over
and over because of permit and
construction problems.
In his report, Fetterman said,
"It is my personal opinion that
maintaining them in operation for
as long as we did raises ethical
problems."
But Malloy characterized the
situation as "damned if you do,
damned if you don't."
Decleve said the tradeoff was
closing the incinerators quickly
and facing certain risks by forcing
the opening of the new burner or
waiting for it to open and taking
unknown risks at the Medical
Center.
Malloy added that there were
also problems with trucking Med
ical Center waste to an off-campus
incinerator until the burner
opened. In addition to the cost
and public concern, he said, there
were more possible liabilities be
cause most hazardous waste ac
cidents occur in transport.
Now that the incinerators have
been closed for over two years,
workers have generally accepted
that they will likely never know
what materials they were exposed
to. But more health and safety
problems may be facing the Med
ical Center.
Workers in the Radiology de
partment are beginning to com
plain about gasoline odors filter
ing into their office. The landing
pad for the hospital's emergency
helicopter is located above the of
fice, and the workers claim that
the fumes come from the helicop
ter when it takes off.
When Sue Dollarhide used to
walk into her office at Stanford
Hospital in the morning, she often
found a layer of black grit cover
ing the desks and tables.
Dollarhide, supervisor of the
hospital's pulmonary physiology
lab, said she also smelled foul
odors and watched black ash filter
in through a ceiling vent in the
office: "It was like your own
fireplace that hadn't been
cleaned."
When Dollarhide started suffer
ing from headaches, fever, nausea,
coughing and clogged throat and
nasal passages, among other
things, she linked her symptoms
to the air quality in the office -
and she started complaining
Dollarhide is one of 10 to 12

hospital personnel who, during
the years 1981 to 1987, sustained
recurring health problems while
working in a block of third floor
offices in the hospital's core build
ing. The workers, at least four of
whom resigned because of the ail
ments, claim their problems were
due to re-entrainment of emis
sions from the hospital's waste in
cinerator.
University officials maintain
that the incinerator was upgraded
to meet and exceed design require
ments and say that the third floor
labs were likely re-entraining
their own fumes. But officials ad
mit that there may have been
lapses in the incinerator's operat
ing procedures and that isolated
incidents of re-entrainment from
the incinerator could have oc-
curred.
