# Chicago bound: Stanford native ties the knot, bids adieu
## 
### 
OUR TRANSITION FROM foot
loose college kids to potentially
donative alumni is a big one not
only in the eyes of Stanford's Office of
Development, but in our eyes as well. We
face, succinctly, the end of our culture's
extended childhood and the beginning of
our adult lives.
Personally, I'm hitting childhood's end
with a vengeance. I'm getting married
the day after I graduate. Then I'm leaving
Stanford, where I grew up (my folks are
profs.), moving to the Midwest with my
new bride, donning a suit and working
9-to-6 in downtown Chicago.
I feel secure in my upcoming marriage,
and it causes me very little anxiety.
Leaving Stanford, though, does. My "an
cestral home" lies about 75 yards from
the Synergy House chicken coop. My
freshman roommate moved 3,000 miles
to live in Flo Mo. I moved about five
blocks, and then as a sophomore and
junior I retreated two blocks to Grove
House. Moving a couple of miles off
campus senior year has been a trauma.

Going to Chicago will be gut
wrenching, and not just because of the
physical distance. I have grown knowl
edgeable about Stanford in my 21 years
here, and I am loathe to begin anew in
ignorance. I'm not sure that I will ever
again know any institution as well as 1
do this school — not just knowledge of
facts, but bone-deep resonance with the
workings of the place, what it is and
what it is not.
I grew up as part of Stanford; I acted
as part of Stanford; now, at what is ob
jectively the beginning of my life, I leave
it.
It's not just my ignorance of the new
situation that's troubling. It's my new
situation's ignorance of me. I've been
lucky in the friends I've made here, and
in the teachers I've had. I've put a lot
of myself on the record; I've defined
myself in the eyes of acquaintances and
strangers. But starting soon, those
friends, those teachers, that record, that
definition — my Stanford context — will
shift into the background of my new life.

It a way, it's refreshing. I can keep in
touch with (some of) my friends and
teachers, and I will abandon local
notoriety along with local celebrity. But
I know that "my" Stanford, the intricate
tapestry which is a part of me and of
which I am a part, will die as I leave
regardless of my will and memory.
Not to be too fulsome in my treatment
of this school, my feelings towards Stan
ford as an institution (as opposed to a
place where I spent significant years) are
at best deeply ambiguous, at worst openly
hostile. I have yet to figure out whether
my growth here has been because of Stan
ford or in spite of Stanford. Generally, I
think, the latter.
Of the many things I see threatened
here, the most significant is the rule of
reason. Stanford's apparently split atti
tude towards reason as a guide for action
is disturbing in the extreme. As graduates
we must decide: Will we do as Caesar
said, or do as Caesar too often did him
self?
On the one hand, Stanford has taught

us to reason. It has given us the intel
lectual tools with which to recognize,
analyze and criticize the strength or
weakness of a rational argument, and it
has rewarded or punished us as we
succeeded or failed in exercising these
tools.
On the other hand, Stanford too often
has shown us how easy, and effective, it
is to be "unreasonable," to make deci
sions based primarily on considerations
of political expediency rather than deep
reflection.
Take the Western Culture reform as
an example. The current Stanford line,
couching the reforms as products of
reasoned debate, is a tremendous exercise
in revisionism and rationalization.
Most of the battles leading up to the
reform were fought not with ideas and
arguments but with symbols and the as
tute use of the political smear. This is
not to say the reforms are unjustifiable,

but rather that their intellectual
justification too often took a back
seat to the fine propaganda gen
erated on their behalf.
Now we go out into the world
beyond Stanford with this tension
— between intellection and ex
pediency, between reason and
reflex — still unresolved. At issue
is whether we will be ruled by

the soundest argument or by the
loudest megaphone.
This profound tension I take
with me to Chicago. I also take
memories, not so profound but
nevertheless important: of
friends, of the Classics Depart
ment, of the Grove House roof,
of the Quad in winter quarter
washed through with the pastel
light of Stanford's late afternoon.

senior in classics.
