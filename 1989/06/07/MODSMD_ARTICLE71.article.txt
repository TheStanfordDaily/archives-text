# Senior reflects on oat bran, sex, lack of...
## 
### 
SEX AT STANFORD and the Cin
cinnati Reds, in a world of change,
have remained the same since 1985.
The Reds have always finished second
in the National League West. Sexually
speaking, Stanford's sultry celibacy
smolders still.
But much else has changed on the
Farm in four years.
The Mac Attack. Perhaps the most
complete and welcome change here has
been Macintoshization. "Macs," as these
now-übiquitous $2,000 boxes have be
come universally known, were once rare
privileges — rated somewhere between
car ownership and the aforementioned
sex.
Today, Macintoshes at Stanford out
number flush toilets.
To you underclassmen, let me explain.
You have always written papers on Macs,
but — and 1 know this is difficult to
believe — this was not always the way
it was done. Before Reagan happened,
my research indicates, Stanford students
composed papers on either an antique
"word processor" or an even older relic,
the "typewriter," dodging dinosaurs as
they chiseled away by torchlight.
Blood and Oats. Hundreds of students
give blood regularly (palatable doughnuts
and orange juice being otherwise unavail
able), but the ranks of donors swelled

In 1987 and 1988, with turgid student support,
the University erected condom vending mac
hines in nearly every dorm, prompting student
discussion of 'safe sex' and other Stanford
fantasies. But usage of the mechanic prophylac
tic dispensers remains low.

briefly this year when the blood bank
started offering free cholesterol screenings
of the donated fluids.
Apparently it was, to coin a phrase,
the right thing to do. The blood flowed,
and soon oat bran sales went through
the roof. Kentucky Fried Chicken had no
comment.
The Stanford Sports Image. Between
fall of 1985 and summer of 1989, the
Cardinal bagged 14 NCAA Division I
championships. That's more than any
other school.
But it took Stanford's back-to-back
wins at the '87 and '88 College World
Series to revamp our image. Before, we
were bookish country clubbers. Now we
can whip the competition in the American
pastime. Axid with our new football couch
recruiting up a storm, we'll be Rose Bowl

bound before you can say "Plunkett."
Prophylacticism. In 1987 and 1988,
with turgid student support, the Univer
sity erected condom vending machines in
nearly every dorm, prompting student
discussion of "safe sex" and other Stan
ford fantasies.
But usage of the mechanic prophylactic
dispensers remains low, and the Univer
sity has been unable get it up. After all,
the approximately 217 students who are,
uh, in that market buy in bulk.
Or so I've heard.
Kennedy's Image. Donald Kennedy
found himself tarred with ideological ep
ithets from both the left and right,
though still he remains the same smart
centrist he was in IS(85.
He's irked his quota of conservatives

For example, in 1987 Kennedy supported
the broadening of the freshman Western
Culture sequence to include more non
western culture. Squeals of outrage
issued from the Wall Street Journal and
Education Secretary-cum-Drug Czar
William Bennett, plus many alums and
students, who believed Kennedy was
"murdering the West." (Did Kennedy do
that? And here I thought it was the high
cost of housing.)
A rather left-wing chap, this President
Kennedy, no?
Last month, 60 radical students forced
their way into his office, demanding that
Kennedy (who was not there at the time)
"immediately" implement their demands,
which included the hiring of tenure-track
ethnic studies professors and minority
deans, plus a reduction in tuition. (Ken
nedy in fact shared their goals but knew
that they would take years, not hours or
months, to realize; if he's locked out of
his office, they will take considerably
longer.)
Political Printing. Sick and tired of
the left-of-center Daily's virtual monopoly
on political debate (this paper endorsed
only Democrats for the White House and
Congress in general elections during the
past five years), a small group of conser
vatives founded The Stanford Review, a
tabloid printed every q master or so, in
1956.

During its first two years, The Review
printed little more than bad jokes and
liberal-bashing bombast. This year its
editors began to get serious, printing
some well-written and fair liberal-bashing
essays. If that trend continues, Stanford
may contract chronic pluralism.
The Left ascendant. The current stu
dent presidents, elected on a disin
genuously moderate platform, spent most
of their time and their subjects' monies


Mitch Steinberger
on dragging the campus agenda
further and further leftward.
They've regularly sought Jesse
Jackson and persons with similar
ideologies as speakers, and rightly
so; but they eschew and often
squelch conservatives.
Those on the Right who plan
to speak anyway, invited by an
outside group of students, are of
ten brutally and shamelessly cen
sored. In 1988, leftists shouted
down an anti-abortion activist and
then stormed his stage when he
refused to stop his address. Later
that year, the student senate ef
fectively banned a leader of the
Nicaraguan Contras from
campus. And so on.
Free speech attacked. I began
my reflection with the best of
changes here at Stanford and will
close with the one that I fear
most.
The freedoms guaranteed under
the First Amendment have re
cently come under potentially suc
cessful attack by, in a historical

reversal of roles, the Left. Earlier
this academic year Stanford en
dured some painful racial inci
dents. The students responsible
rapidly became social pariahs.
But the Leftists want more.
I hey, like the Right before them,
want to make abhorrent expres
sions (in this case, racism) cause
for government (in this case, uni
versity) sanctions, and next fall
they may get their chance.
Wonder of wonders: The
liberals, having fought the old
Right for centuries to kindle free
speech, now seek to snuff it out.
They hope to "cure" racism by
outlawing its symptoms, much
like clipping dandelions off at the
stems. It won't work. The roots
of racism and other weeds will
remain and grow below the sur
face.
The best cures remain the
penetrating herbicides of educa
tion and societal pressure. And
these require free expression even
— nay, especially — for bigots.
Hate may be strong, but this uni
versity can crush it.

senior in history and political sci

The Left ascendant. The current stu

on dragging the campus agenda
further and further leftward.
They've regularly sought Jesse
Jackson and persons with similar
ideologies as speakers, and rightly
so; but they eschew and often
squelch conservatives.
Those on the Right who plan
to speak anyway, invited by an
outside group of students, are of
ten brutally and shamelessly cen
sored. In 1988, leftists shouted
down an anti-abortion activist and
then stormed his stage when he
refused to stop his address. Later
that year, the student senate ef
fectively banned a leader of the
Nicaraguan Contras from
campus. And so on.
Free speech attacked. I began
my reflection with the best of
changes here at Stanford and will
close with the one that I fear
most.
The freedoms guaranteed under
the First Amendment have re
cently come under potentially suc
cessful attack by, in a historical

reversal of roles, the Left. Earlier
this academic year Stanford en
dured some painful racial inci
dents. The students responsible
rapidly became social pariahs.
But the Leftists want more.
I hey, like the Right before them,
want to make abhorrent expres
sions (in this case, racism) cause
for government (in this case, uni
versity) sanctions, and next fall
they may get their chance.
Wonder of wonders: The
liberals, having fought the old
Right for centuries to kindle free
speech, now seek to snuff it out.
They hope to "cure" racism by
outlawing its symptoms, much
like clipping dandelions off at the
stems. It won't work. The roots
of racism and other weeds will
remain and grow below the sur
face.
The best cures remain the
penetrating herbicides of educa
tion and societal pressure. And
these require free expression even
— nay, especially — for bigots.
Hate may be strong, but this uni
versity can crush it.

SEX AT STANFORD and the Cin
cinnati Reds, in a world of change,
have remained the same since 1985.
The Reds have always finished second
in the National League West. Sexually
speaking, Stanford's sultry celibacy
smolders still.
But much else has changed on the
Farm in four years.
The Mac Attack. Perhaps the most
complete and welcome change here has
been Macintoshization. "Macs," as these
now-übiquitous $2,000 boxes have be
come universally known, were once rare
privileges — rated somewhere between
car ownership and the aforementioned
sex.
Today, Macintoshes at Stanford out
number flush toilets.
To you underclassmen, let me explain.
You have always written papers on Macs,
but — and 1 know this is difficult to
believe — this was not always the way
it was done. Before Reagan happened,
my research indicates, Stanford students
composed papers on either an antique
"word processor" or an even older relic,
the "typewriter," dodging dinosaurs as
they chiseled away by torchlight.
Blood and Oats. Hundreds of students
give blood regularly (palatable doughnuts
and orange juice being otherwise unavail
able), but the ranks of donors swelled

In 1987 and 1988, with turgid student support,
the University erected condom vending mac
hines in nearly every dorm, prompting student
discussion of 'safe sex' and other Stanford
fantasies. But usage of the mechanic prophylac
tic dispensers remains low.

briefly this year when the blood bank
started offering free cholesterol screenings
of the donated fluids.
Apparently it was, to coin a phrase,
the right thing to do. The blood flowed,
and soon oat bran sales went through
the roof. Kentucky Fried Chicken had no
comment.
The Stanford Sports Image. Between
fall of 1985 and summer of 1989, the
Cardinal bagged 14 NCAA Division I
championships. That's more than any
other school.
But it took Stanford's back-to-back
wins at the '87 and '88 College World
Series to revamp our image. Before, we
were bookish country clubbers. Now we
can whip the competition in the American
pastime. Axid with our new football couch
recruiting up a storm, we'll be Rose Bowl

bound before you can say "Plunkett."
Prophylacticism. In 1987 and 1988,
with turgid student support, the Univer
sity erected condom vending machines in
nearly every dorm, prompting student
discussion of "safe sex" and other Stan
ford fantasies.
But usage of the mechanic prophylactic
dispensers remains low, and the Univer
sity has been unable get it up. After all,
the approximately 217 students who are,
uh, in that market buy in bulk.
Or so I've heard.
Kennedy's Image. Donald Kennedy
found himself tarred with ideological ep
ithets from both the left and right,
though still he remains the same smart
centrist he was in IS(85.
He's irked his quota of conservatives

For example, in 1987 Kennedy supported
the broadening of the freshman Western
Culture sequence to include more non
western culture. Squeals of outrage
issued from the Wall Street Journal and
Education Secretary-cum-Drug Czar
William Bennett, plus many alums and
students, who believed Kennedy was
"murdering the West." (Did Kennedy do
that? And here I thought it was the high
cost of housing.)
A rather left-wing chap, this President
Kennedy, no?
Last month, 60 radical students forced
their way into his office, demanding that
Kennedy (who was not there at the time)
"immediately" implement their demands,
which included the hiring of tenure-track
ethnic studies professors and minority
deans, plus a reduction in tuition. (Ken
nedy in fact shared their goals but knew
that they would take years, not hours or
months, to realize; if he's locked out of
his office, they will take considerably
longer.)
Political Printing. Sick and tired of
the left-of-center Daily's virtual monopoly
on political debate (this paper endorsed
only Democrats for the White House and
Congress in general elections during the
past five years), a small group of conser
vatives founded The Stanford Review, a
tabloid printed every q master or so, in
1956.

During its first two years, The Review
printed little more than bad jokes and
liberal-bashing bombast. This year its
editors began to get serious, printing
some well-written and fair liberal-bashing
essays. If that trend continues, Stanford
may contract chronic pluralism.
