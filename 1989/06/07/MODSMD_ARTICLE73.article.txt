# Spotlighting the 4-year journey through Stanford:
## 1988-89 
### 
September
Senior Gretchen Carlson is
crowned Miss America. Stanford
Olympian Scott Fortune returns
to the Farm after scoring the gold
medal point in volleyball against
the Soviets. Stanford baseball
Coach Mark Marquess also heads
back from Seoul, Korea with a
gold, as the head coach of the
victorious U.S. baseball team.
October
Racial tensions ignite the
campus after two white freshmen
admit to posting a racially offen

sive poster in Stanford's black
theme house, Ujamaa. The fresh
men shocked dorm residents and
members of the black community
by drawing a crude caricature of
Beethoven with wild hair, big lips
and red, crazed eyes. After receiv
ing the No. 1 ranking three years
in a row, Stanford falls to No. 6
in the U.S News and World
Report's survey of America's best
colleges. Democratic vice
presidential candidate Lloyd
Bentsen makes a whirlwind cam
paign stop at Stanford, blasting
then-presidential candidate
George Bush in a speech to 500

stu dents.
November
With the election of George
Bush as the 41st president, three
Stanford professors soon join him
in Washington, D.C. Economics
Profs. Michael Boskin and John
Taylor receive appointments to
Bush's chief economic policy
group, the Council of Economic
Advisers. Boskin chairs the three
member council. Political Science
Prof. Condoleezza Rice eventually
joins Bush's team as the National
Security Council's Soviet and East
European specialist. Law Prof.
Tom Campbell defeats Democratic
opponent Anna Eshoo to gain the
12th District seat in the U.S.
House of Representatives. In the
last play of the Big Game, the
Cardinal escapes with a 19-19 tie
by blocking a California field goal
attempt. The football team ended
the season with a dismal 3-6-2
overall record and ninth-place
finish in the Pacific 10 Confer
ence.

December
Due to a chronic inability to fill
quota and ongoing financial prob
lems, the Alpha Delta Phi Frater
nity loses its house. The Alpha
Delts become the first Stanford
fraternity to lose housing because
of recruiting failures.
January
Dennis Green, receivers coach
for the San Francisco 49ers,
replaces Jack Elway, who got the
axe Dec. 15, as Stanford's new
head football coach. The Univer
sity contracts Crane Pest Control
to trap some of the 1,500 wild
cats roaming about campus.
February
Predicting that Stanford will
face a $11 million budget deficit
for 1989-90, University officials
decide to up next year's tuition
by a surpisingly high 8 percent.
March
Stanford's 83-year-old supreme
code of conduct — the Fundamen
tal Standard — gets a close look
by the Student Conduct Legisla
tive Council in an effort to rec
oncile First Amendment rights
with the rights of others. The
women's basketball team captures
the Pacific 10 Conference cham
pionship; the men's team finishes
second in the Pac-10 and both
head off to the NCAA Tourna
ment.
April
The Stanford women's swim
team upsets the Florida Gators,
the overwhelming favorite, to cap
ture the NCAA championship.
The long-awaited Undergraduate
Committee on Minority Issues
report is finally released. The
report, which interviewed more
than 1,300 students, documents
underlying racial tensions here
and offers more than 100 recom
mendations for improving Stan
ford's minority situation inside
and outside the classroom. In its
annual ASSU elections, Stanford
moves one step ahead of the rest

of the nation by conducting the
first completely computerized
election on such a large scale. In
the spring elections, students vote
against the Axe Committee, de
nying the Stanford spirit group
its special fee request and putting
the future of next year's Bonfire
and all-campus rally into ques
tion.
May
Police in riot gear arrest more
than 50 students after protesters

took over University President
Donald Kennedy's office and bar
ricaded all entrances for almost
eight hours, demanding an imme
diate meeting with Kennedy to
discuss multi-racial needs. Both
the men and women's tennis
teams win the NCAA title crown.
June
At a candlelight vigil in White
Plaza, 1,000 community members
remember the pro-democracy Chi
nese demonstrators who died in
Beijing.
