# The
						job hunt: what your freshman adviser never told you
## 
### 
IF YOU'RE FEELING like me, the
prospect of leaving Stanford for a job
in the real world tantalizes and ex
cites you. Then again, you're not like me,
because I'm a junior with another full
year here, and you're a senior who has
to find a job in the next few days.
Yes, a job. Shocking as it may be, the
reality is that you can't trade your Stan
ford sheepskin (or your diploma) for a
large stack of unmarked bills. At least
not this year — this is the year for UC-
Berkeley graduates to make it in the real
world.
But next year, their graduates have to
get jobs and we get the large stacks of
dough. That's just the way it works. You
ever wonder why you never read about
Berkeley's problems in the New York
Times? They're too busy to have prob
lems over there, what with renting U-
Hauls to cart their bucks around and
everything.
Luckily, finding a job is fairly easy
because there are only three types of jobs
that Stanford graduates are eligible for.
I have listed them below along with a

brief description so you can decide which
is best for you.
Job Type #1: Investment Banker
I have no idea what investment bankers
do. Which brings us to our second cate
gory:
Job Type #2: Electrical / Industrial /
Mechanical / Civil / Uncivil / Petroleum
/ Computer / Animal / Vegetable /
Mineral Engineer
Anyone who majored in one of the so
called "techie" (pronounced "techie")
majors will become an engineer. En
gineers are very important for modern
society. Without engineers you would
have no one to yell "ALL
ABOOOOOOARD!!!"
Job Type #3: Unemployed Humanities
Major
Remember when your freshman ad
viser told you to in what you
want, because you'll still be able to get
a job"? Do you remember that? Go find
your adviser. Kill him/her/it. No jury will

convict you.
An Actual Job Interview Transcript
Employer: So, you seem like a decent
fellow. What did you in at Stan
ford?
Humanities Major: (confidently) Lin
guistics.
Employer: HA HA HA HA HA HA HA
HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA
HA HA, click, aim, KABOOOOOM!!
So as you can plainly see, finding a
job is out. This leaves two alternatives:
(1) Starve and die, or (2) Go to graduate
school.
Now I know what you're saying. You're
saying, "Shouldn't 'starve' and 'die' be
two separate alternatives?" But you're
also saying, "Graduate school?!?"
Yes, graduate school. And just like the
job world, the graduate school world also
has three branches. (Ain't it amazin' how
everything I write about comes in three

convenient divisions — kinda the "Let's
Make a Deal" of humor writing, eh?)
Medical School
In medical school you learn to cut dead
human beings into pieces. I am not
making this up. I mean, ostensibly you
are learning to be a doctor, but for my
money, if your doctor only knows how to
cut up dead people you're probably in
trouble.
Law School
Just like medical school, except you cut
the human beings into pieces before
they're dead.
Business School
You learn to work 100-hour weeks until
you drop dead and get used by students
in medical school classes.
So clearly graduate school is out. This
leaves only one option: The Peace Corps.
