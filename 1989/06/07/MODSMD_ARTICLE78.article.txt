# It's unofficial — The senior Commencement speech
## 
### 
Author's note: When two seniors came
up with the notion of having a student
speak at Commencement, Kathy Lac
henauer, The Daily's editor in chief, said
she would nominate me to be that speaker.
With all due respect to University Pres
ident Donald Kennedy, who listed a lack
of time to prepare the speech among his
reasons for nixing the idea, here is the
address I would have delivered had I
been given the chance.
Oh, by the way, I wrote this in a couple
of hours.
FOUR YEARS AGO, we came to
Stanford as 1,500 young men and
women who were not quite certain
of what was to come. We arrived for
Orientation a little frightened and a little
bewildered, but nevertheless quite ex
cited.
Today, we are somewhat older, hope
fully somewhat wiser. And we are pre
paring to leave this place without much
certainty of what is to come. Perhaps,
we're a little frightened, a little bewil
dered .. . but nevertheless, quite excited.
We are excited because of the challenges
that lie ahead. For some of us, 17 years
of school isn't enough and we will hit
the books again in September. For some
of us, the twin monetary meccas of in
vestment banking and management con
sulting lie ahead.

For many of us — perhaps the majority
of us, if those I've spoken to are any
indication — we don't know what we'll
be doing as of tomorrow morning.
It seems more than a bit odd. Well
over a thousand days have passed — and
roughly $80,000 have passed through our
hands — since we arrived here with the
rest of our lives all neatly planned.
Now, when we actually have to carry
out that plan, the naive road map of life
we looked at upon leaving high school
more closely resembles the words of the
kindergarten student who says "When I
grow up, I want to be a fireman" rather
than the path to be taken by the grad
uates of one of America's elite univer
sities.
Therein lies a somewhat striking les
son: For all the great and wonderful
things there are about Stanford, the very
unreality of living in this cloister leaves
us woefully unprepared to deal with the
very reality that rapidly approaches.
Acknowledging that is all right. It nei
ther cheapens our memory nor devalues
our education. We are not, as the cynic
might view it, being kicked out of Dis
neyland. Instead, we are leaving behind
some of the most special people and some
of the most special experiences we will
ever know.
Stanford is not special because of its
physical beauty or its tremendous endow

ment. It is special because it brings us
together to learn, to share and to live.
The opportunity to be with so many bril
liant and fascinating people day and
night, for as long as we have, is one few
get to enjoy.
Mix in an academic experience of un
impeachable quality, a degree that will
take us as far as we want it to, friends
we will never lose touch with and mem
ories that will stay with us forever. That,
in a nutshell, is the Stanford experience
we have had.
Leaving that behind brings us much
sadness — as well it should. But this last
gathering of the Class of 1989 should
also bring us joy. It is a chance to re
member the special times we have shared
and all the people we have shared them
with.
I will remember coming up Palm Drive
as a pro fro, seeing the Quad appear in
front of me and saying "I have arrived!"
I'll remember staying up 'til 4 a.m.
talking to whoever was awake in my
freshman dorm. Running to Safeway at
midnight with my sophomore roommate
to pick up a bread for snacking. Watching
Stanford beat Arizona in basketball —
twice. Listening to the radio with a friend
and going insane when Paul Carey hit
The Grand Slam. My time at The Daily
I will forget wanting to transfer as a

freshman. Getting C's. Food Service. Dis
tribution requirements. Siena. Food Serv
ice. One-room doubles. "Sorry, a system
error has occurred." Dead Week. You
know, the one when you have the most
work you've had all quarter .. .
Like the aforementioned unemployed
among us, I will wake up tomorrow morn
ing unsure of what I'm going to do. Yet,
I am secure in the knowledge everything
will eventually fall into place. We should
all have that security.
Having survived 180 units and four
(or more) years of Stanford University
has prepared us for just about any curve
life tries to throw us.
In order to handle some of the bumps
on the road ahead, I leave you with some
advice.
In the real world, you can't charge
someone with a Fundamental Standard
violation if they say something you don't
like — no matter how stupid or ignorant
it may be.
Don't invest in the stock market. It's
fixed and it crashes. Buy T-bills. The
government hasn't defaulted in 213 years
and you can make a killing if interest
rates fall.
If you're ever trying to lose weight,
find a partner who's better at it. Make
your goal to lose as much weight as they
do, get jealous of them when they get

thinner while you don't and don't give
up ice cream. If you deny yourself the
things you love, you'll never be happy.
As a matter of fact, that'll work for a
lot of things besides ice cream.

Mark Rogowsky is a senior in public
policy. He will graduate in the not-too
distant future.
