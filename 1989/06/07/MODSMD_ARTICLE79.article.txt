# Fetter's first fond farewell
## 
### DJ Berinstein 
Remember back to the day you
were a senior in high school and
Stanford's dean of undergraduate
admissions confidently spoke to
your high school class about the
University?
You were probably nervous
about the entire encounter. But
oddly enough, you were not the
only one — the new Dean of
Undergraduate Admissions Jean
Fetter was probably just as ner
vous, because she was speaking
to students who would eventually
represent her first admitted class

at Stanford.
"You're the best first class I've
ever admitted," says Fetter. On
Commencement Sunday, as the
Class of 1989, donned in cap and
gown, parades through the foot
ball stadium in a state of frenzy,
Fetter will no doubt watch the
graduating class with a certain
sense of pride and bewilder
ment. ... Is this really how she
expected her first admitted class
to turn out?
Fetter said one of her greatest
hurdles as dean has been learning
not to take the failures of her
admitted classes personally. "It's

painful for me when students stop
out or are suspended, and I have
had moments of despondency, but
who am I to have those expecta
tions? It's your life. You learn the
most from the rough patches.
"It's hard to see people stumble
a bit," she added, speaking with
the remnants of her native British
accent. "It's part of the learning
process for you."
Before becoming dean of under
graduate admissions, Fetter read
a book called "Choosing Elites,"
which chronicles the experiences
of the dean of admissions at Am
herst College. The Amherst dean
had hoped to master "the art of
human assessment," which Fetter
admits she had also hoped to ac
complish.
She soon realized that "humans
are unpredictable,'' and that there
is no true science in selecting can
didates for admission. "You can
only do the best you can."
Fetter said that one of the many
joys her office has given her has
been to live her life "vicariously
through [her admittees]. I take
personal interest in each individ
ual student and feel a strong per
sonal attachment to each and
every one. ..."
Having a natural sense of
curiosity, Fetter admitted to pull
ing some files again after seeing
a student receive notablity,
whether it be an academic dis
tinction or even the lead in a
Ram's Head Production.
Fetter was hesitant to take the
credit for the amazing achieve
ments of the graduating class,
noting that she is not responsible
for the quality of students who
apply. "Each of you determines
your successes," she said. "You
inspire others behind you to apply,
which just makes our job easier.
"You all are a wonderfully self
perpetuating set," she added.
"Success breeds success."
"You can't do this job as well
as it should be done unless you
really know what this institution
stands for. I really know and love
Stanford," she said.
Looking back over her last four
years as dean, she said, "Yes, I've
changed. I've gotten older and
wiser, and hope you all have too."
She closed with a note of nos
talgia, "You are a special class for
me and I will be following you
from afar. This is au reuoir, not
goodbye."

Say hello, wave goodbye
Jean Fetter greeted her first class four years ago, making 1989 a
particularly sad Commencement for Stanford's dean of admissions.
