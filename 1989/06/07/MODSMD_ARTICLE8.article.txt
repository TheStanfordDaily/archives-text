# Med School buckles down to meet safety standards
## 
### Jock Friedly Editorial staff 
Outside a well-respected can
cer researcher's laboratory in
the School of Medicine sat an
ordinary green garbage can,
filled to the top with red bags,
signifying that infectious waste
was contained within.
The red bags, however, were
not sealed as state law man
dates They lay open, exposing
the waste to the air that dozens
of professors and medical stu
dents would breathe the next
day.
The red bags may have been
sterilized; thev may even have

been filled with non-infectious
waste that could do no harm
To an observer not willing to
sift through the contents,
though, it was difficult to tell.
Nevertheless, that scene — by
no means the norm for the Med
ical Center — was just one of
several observations made in
one recent late-night walk
through of the center.
Over the past few years, a
wave of new safety measures
has swept through the Medical
Center, to follow the trend that
has occurred throughout the
campus and in research labora
tories across the entire nation.
Despite these measures, though,

poor safety practices still occur.
"This is an unbelievable phe
nomena that has hit university
campuses," says John Fyfe, the
health and safety coordinator
for the Medical School.
Fyfe is one of a growing num
ber of health and safety admin
istrators who deal with the Med
ical Center. Within the next
month, the Medical Center will
announce the selection of its
first director of health and
safety, Fyfe says.
In this nationwide drive to
make laboratories safe. Univer
sity Health and Safety officials
have had to cooperate with high
caliber researchers to change poor
safety practices in the laborato
ries. Although the going has been
mostly smooth, safety officials
sometimes have felt tensions with
researchers who have not always
understood the motivation for
change.
These misunderstandings may
have led some researchers to ig
nore some of the basic safety pro
cedures that employees of the
University's Department of
Health and Safety feel should be
regular practices.
A troubled history
Four years ago, Health and
Safety mandated researchers to
systematically classify the
hazards contained in the chemical
stores in the 450 labs.
It was the first time the de
partment had tried something so
monumental, and it was certainly
the biggest of all Health and

Safety experiments. "The Medical
School was the experiment where
it failed," says Peter Burnes, a
Health and Safety official.
"It was the first time they had
ever been asked to do something
like that," explains Health and
Safety specialist Jennifer Gates,
who coordinated the program.
"We bit off too much at one time."
The failed attempt by Health
and Safety left lasting memories
among researchers, many of
whom were confused and some
times angered by the attempt.
"A good deal of ill will was
created over that experience,"
says Burnes. "The political idea
was to leave them alone."
As a result of the experience,
not all researchers have fully
respected Health and Safety
workers. "They don't seem in
credibly competent," says one re
searcher who asked not to be iden
tified.
"[Scientists] think of us as
glorified janitors," says Gary
Schell, a Health and Safety em
ployee, who often has been called
to pick up chemicals neglected by
researchers for so long that they

have become potentially danger
ous.
In the wake of the fallout from
that incident, some researchers
continued following the safety
rules that were convenient and
sometimes skipped what they
thought were unnecessary rules.
One of those rules they neglected,
apparently, was that chemical
waste and infectious waste should
be disposed of separately
The Environmental Safety Fa
cility incinerator was not designed
or permitted to burn chemicals,
but empty chemical bottles and
used chemicals were often
dumped in the red bags that were
shipped off to be burned.
In March 19&7, the operations
manager of the facility wrote a
memo to Alain DeCleve, then di
rector of Health and Safety, out
lining what he saw as a significant
problem with waste disposal at
the Medical School. He pointed out
that the chemicals hidden among
the infectious waste could cause
potentially dangerous situations
to workers at the incinerator.
Within two weeks, when the

problem had not been corrected,
the operations manager sent a
memo to workers who picked up
the red bags from the Medical
Center telling them immediately
to stop pickup of the waste until
the researchers learned to cor
rectly segregate it.
Since 1985, when Health and
Safety attempted the cataloging,
the Medical Center has undergone
another big project to make the
chemical stores safer.
Last summer, Fyfe of the Med
ical Center directed a program to
dispose of all chemicals that were
old and no longer needed. Chemi
cal bottles that were years old and
half-corroded were disposed of in
that clean-up.
Although a very small number
resisted, the vast majority of the
researchers were very coopera
tive, says Fyfe. The researchers,
who only three years previously
had been up in arms over the
cataloging, at the very least
grudgingly accepted the house
cleaning.
"I think it was a pain, but in
the long run it was probably much

safer," says one researcher.
Fyfe says he has encountered
little resistance from researchers,
but a number of people have in
dicated to The Daily that some
problems still exist and the rela
tionship between the Medical Cen
ter, and Health and Safety is still
somewhat strained.
"The chemical safety is a prob
lem," says one student. "That's
where things are not being dealt
with properly."
"I think [chemical safety] is an
enormous task that they are still
trying to get under control," says
one award-winning researcher at
the Medical School.
Researcher's attitude?
Once again this summer, the
Medical Center will be cataloging
the chemicals in all of the labs,
this time by hiring students to do
the job so as not to burden the
researchers as much. This time,
they don't expect the same prob
lems.
"The first time's the hardest,"
says Burnes. "There has been a
general shift in people's atti
tudes."

Traditionally, researchers have
opposed safety measures because
they have had other pressures to
worry about. For example, the
promotion system in academia is
not based on a researcher's cares
with safety.
Professors get tenure based on
how many papers they have pub
lished and how well their work is
regarded, and graduate students
often receive their degrees regard
less of how clean the lab is.
Furthermore, researchers in
academia are reluctant to have
any more rules about health and
safety in laboratories. "I think
that the researcher is being bom
barded by rules of all kinds," says
one scientist at the Medical Center.
Despite the historical reluc
tance to the safety measures, re
search safety has become an even
greater concern among the re
searchers themselves. Now, many
of them are beginning to accept
the measures.
"Safety is more prominent than
it was," according to Fyfe.
"All of those things are part
and parcel of being a scientist,"
says Microbiology Prof. Stanley
Falkow.

who coordinated the program.
"We bit off too much at one time."
The failed attempt by Health
and Safety left lasting memories
among researchers, many of
whom were confused and some
times angered by the attempt.
"A good deal of ill will was
created over that experience,"
says Burnes. "The political idea
was to leave them alone."
As a result of the experience,
not all researchers have fully
respected Health and Safety
workers. "They don't seem in
credibly competent," says one re
searcher who asked not to be iden
tified.
"[Scientists] think of us as
glorified janitors," says Gary
Schell, a Health and Safety em
ployee, who often has been called
to pick up chemicals neglected by
researchers for so long that they

have become potentially danger
ous.
In the wake of the fallout from
that incident, some researchers
continued following the safety
rules that were convenient and
sometimes skipped what they
thought were unnecessary rules.
One of those rules they neglected,
apparently, was that chemical
waste and infectious waste should
be disposed of separately
The Environmental Safety Fa
cility incinerator was not designed
or permitted to burn chemicals,
but empty chemical bottles and
used chemicals were often
dumped in the red bags that were
shipped off to be burned.
In March 19&7, the operations
manager of the facility wrote a
memo to Alain DeCleve, then di
rector of Health and Safety, out
lining what he saw as a significant
problem with waste disposal at
the Medical School. He pointed out
that the chemicals hidden among
the infectious waste could cause
potentially dangerous situations
to workers at the incinerator.
Within two weeks, when the

problem had not been corrected,
the operations manager sent a
memo to workers who picked up
the red bags from the Medical
Center telling them immediately
to stop pickup of the waste until
the researchers learned to cor
rectly segregate it.
Since 1985, when Health and
Safety attempted the cataloging,
the Medical Center has undergone
another big project to make the
chemical stores safer.
Last summer, Fyfe of the Med
ical Center directed a program to
dispose of all chemicals that were
old and no longer needed. Chemi
cal bottles that were years old and
half-corroded were disposed of in
that clean-up.
Although a very small number
resisted, the vast majority of the
researchers were very coopera
tive, says Fyfe. The researchers,
who only three years previously
had been up in arms over the
cataloging, at the very least
grudgingly accepted the house
cleaning.
"I think it was a pain, but in
the long run it was probably much

safer," says one researcher.
Fyfe says he has encountered
little resistance from researchers,
but a number of people have in
dicated to The Daily that some
problems still exist and the rela
tionship between the Medical Cen
ter, and Health and Safety is still
somewhat strained.
"The chemical safety is a prob
lem," says one student. "That's
where things are not being dealt
with properly."
"I think [chemical safety] is an
enormous task that they are still
trying to get under control," says
one award-winning researcher at
the Medical School.
Researcher's attitude?
Once again this summer, the
Medical Center will be cataloging
the chemicals in all of the labs,
this time by hiring students to do
the job so as not to burden the
researchers as much. This time,
they don't expect the same prob
lems.
"The first time's the hardest,"
says Burnes. "There has been a
general shift in people's atti
tudes."

Traditionally, researchers have
opposed safety measures because
they have had other pressures to
worry about. For example, the
promotion system in academia is
not based on a researcher's cares
with safety.
Professors get tenure based on
how many papers they have pub
lished and how well their work is
regarded, and graduate students
often receive their degrees regard
less of how clean the lab is.
Furthermore, researchers in
academia are reluctant to have
any more rules about health and
safety in laboratories. "I think
that the researcher is being bom
barded by rules of all kinds," says
one scientist at the Medical Center.
Despite the historical reluc
tance to the safety measures, re
search safety has become an even
greater concern among the re
searchers themselves. Now, many
of them are beginning to accept
the measures.
"Safety is more prominent than
it was," according to Fyfe.
"All of those things are part
and parcel of being a scientist,"
says Microbiology Prof. Stanley
Falkow.
Outside a well-respected can
cer researcher's laboratory in
the School of Medicine sat an
ordinary green garbage can,
filled to the top with red bags,
signifying that infectious waste
was contained within.
The red bags, however, were
not sealed as state law man
dates They lay open, exposing
the waste to the air that dozens
of professors and medical stu
dents would breathe the next
day.
The red bags may have been
sterilized; thev may even have

been filled with non-infectious
waste that could do no harm
To an observer not willing to
sift through the contents,
though, it was difficult to tell.
Nevertheless, that scene — by
no means the norm for the Med
ical Center — was just one of
several observations made in
one recent late-night walk
through of the center.
Over the past few years, a
wave of new safety measures
has swept through the Medical
Center, to follow the trend that
has occurred throughout the
campus and in research labora
tories across the entire nation.
Despite these measures, though,

poor safety practices still occur.
"This is an unbelievable phe
nomena that has hit university
campuses," says John Fyfe, the
health and safety coordinator
for the Medical School.
Fyfe is one of a growing num
ber of health and safety admin
istrators who deal with the Med
ical Center. Within the next
month, the Medical Center will
announce the selection of its
first director of health and
safety, Fyfe says.
In this nationwide drive to
make laboratories safe. Univer
sity Health and Safety officials
have had to cooperate with high
caliber researchers to change poor
safety practices in the laborato
ries. Although the going has been
mostly smooth, safety officials
sometimes have felt tensions with
researchers who have not always
understood the motivation for
change.
These misunderstandings may
have led some researchers to ig
nore some of the basic safety pro
cedures that employees of the
University's Department of
Health and Safety feel should be
regular practices.
A troubled history
Four years ago, Health and
Safety mandated researchers to
systematically classify the
hazards contained in the chemical
stores in the 450 labs.
It was the first time the de
partment had tried something so
monumental, and it was certainly
the biggest of all Health and

Safety experiments. "The Medical
School was the experiment where
it failed," says Peter Burnes, a
Health and Safety official.
"It was the first time they had
ever been asked to do something
like that," explains Health and
Safety specialist Jennifer Gates,
who coordinated the program.
"We bit off too much at one time."
The failed attempt by Health
and Safety left lasting memories
