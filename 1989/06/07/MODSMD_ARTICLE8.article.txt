# Med School buckles down to meet safety standards
## 
### Jock Friedly Editorial staff 
Outside a well-respected can
cer researcher's laboratory in
the School of Medicine sat an
ordinary green garbage can,
filled to the top with red bags,
signifying that infectious waste
was contained within.
The red bags, however, were
not sealed as state law man
dates They lay open, exposing
the waste to the air that dozens
of professors and medical stu
dents would breathe the next
day.
The red bags may have been
sterilized; thev may even have

been filled with non-infectious
waste that could do no harm
To an observer not willing to
sift through the contents,
though, it was difficult to tell.
Nevertheless, that scene — by
no means the norm for the Med
ical Center — was just one of
several observations made in
one recent late-night walk
through of the center.
Over the past few years, a
wave of new safety measures
has swept through the Medical
Center, to follow the trend that
has occurred throughout the
campus and in research labora
tories across the entire nation.
Despite these measures, though,

poor safety practices still occur.
"This is an unbelievable phe
nomena that has hit university
campuses," says John Fyfe, the
health and safety coordinator
for the Medical School.
Fyfe is one of a growing num
ber of health and safety admin
istrators who deal with the Med
ical Center. Within the next
month, the Medical Center will
announce the selection of its
first director of health and
safety, Fyfe says.
In this nationwide drive to
make laboratories safe. Univer
