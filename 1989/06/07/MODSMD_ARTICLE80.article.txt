The honors thesis . . . What
motivates 27 to 30 percent of
Stanford undergraduates to un
dertake such a long and complex
study?
The Class of 1989 has written
theses that span history, the con
tinents and the mind. Students
critiqued their own productions
and performances. They analyzed
important works of poets and mi
nority authors, as well as worked
with professors on scientific re
search . . . just to highlight a few.
"The honors thesis allows the
students to be both creative and
analytical," according to Drama
Prof. Alice Rainer, who has
worked with students in the
Drama Department Honors Pro
gram.
The honors thesis can be more
than a two-year project for some
fifth-year and co-terminal stu
dents. The thesis is born as early
as fall quarter of a student's junior
year, especially if a student in
tends to apply for grant money
for research. Every year there are
some students that find they need
the summer or an extra quarter
or two to finish their theses.
Applications for grant money,
which must include specific ideas
concerning the thesis topic, are
due by the beginning of spring
quarter of junior year. This means
a student must apply to the honors
program and find faculty advisers
for the thesis by the end of winter
quarter.
If a student does not apply for
a grant, he or she has an extra
few weeks before the honors the
sis proposal is due. To be accepted
into departmental honors pro
grams, a student usually needs a
GPA of at least 3.5 in his or her
major.

Mark Weiner, a graduating
senior in American studies, said
he decided to do an honors thesis
because the quarter system at
Stanford prohibits the opportu
nity to engage in a "sustained in
tellectual project."
Weiner recently completed his
thesis on "Definitions of the Self
in Early-Modern Advertising: the
Examination of the Cosmology of
Listerine and Fleishmann's
Yeast." His thesis developed out
of a scholar's research on con
sumer culture and consumer per
sonality. Weiner previously com
pleted a paper on shopping malls
and wrote articles for the Wash
ington Post on dinosaurs and
rollerblades, two current con
sumer fads.
Weiner cited patience and
curiosity as two virtues necessary
for a successful honors thesis.
"The opportunity to apply your
self for an extended period of time
to a specific topic is an important
and rare opportunity."
Mia Manzulli, a graduating
senior in English, agreed. "Not
only do you learn a lot about a
period in depth, you learn a lot
about yourself," Manzulli said.
Manzulli diligently finished her
thesis on "Social Mobility in Old
New York: The Social Context of

Edith Wharton's Novels of Man
ners" as early as the end of winter
quarter.
"[YouJ learn how much disci
pline you have, how much you
can push yourself," she said. "You
have to schedule your day, because
otherwise it would be too easy to
push [the thesis] aside."
Mitch Steinberger said it was
necessary that he learned
whether he had this discipline and
self-motivation, because he is in
terested in teaching at the college
level, which requires research of
one's own.
Steinberger, a graduating
senior in political science and his
tory, recently completed his
honors thesis in political science
on Robert Bork and the bad
timing Bork faced when he was
nominated unsuccessfully for Su
preme Court justice. An honors
thesis is "a way to see whether
you are interested in pursuing a
Ph.D.," he said.
Steinberger said the honors the
sis is not for everyone. "If you
are doing it just to get Honors
[on your diploma], you're not
going to finish it or you'll hate it
or both."
"The best part about the thesis
is handing it in," Manzulli em
phatically concluded.
