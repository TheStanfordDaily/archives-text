# Venturing into a rainbow of colors, a medieval age

Ever wonder why University President
Donald Kennedy makes his grand march
to the Commencement podium bedecked
in a crimson-lined hood, edged in golden
yellow, and a velvet trimmed robe? His
elaborate dress might seem a little pom
pous — even for a president — when
compared to the boring black, hood not
included, gowns seniors wear.
Well, Kennedy's not out to bedazzle the
Commencement crowd; he's simply fol
lowing an age-old graduation tradition.
Those colors in the president's academic
dress identify not only the college or uni
versity that granted his degree (in Ken
nedy's case, Harvard University), but also
the subject in which the degree was
granted (biological sciences).
Now, seniors are probably crinkling
their brows and saying: "Well, I'm grad
uating from Stanford. Shouldn't I at least
get to add a cardinal stripe to my gown?"
The answer, dear graduates, is no. You
see, only doctoral gowns and robes have
trimmings. So unless you cram in some
Ph.D. coursework before graduation,
your options are, well, black.
The Dross of Ages
Academic dress is rooted in tradition.
Dating back to the Middle Ages, caps and
robes were worn by scholars at early Eu
ropean universities. Since scholars were
also clerics, they adopted robes similar
to those of their monastic order. Drafly

buildings necessitated caps and capes
with hoods for warmth.
And what's the reason for the brighter
colors, like Kennedy's bold crimson gown?
The Catholic Church had something to
do with that.
When the Church began losing control
of universities, academic costume
employed brighter colors and a variety
of patterns for the gowns and accompa
nying head-dresses.
Academic dress has been in the United
States since Colonial times, but it was
not until 1893 that an intercollegiate com
mission recommended the uniform code
of academic costume still followed today.
Design by degree
The design of the gowns worn in aca
demic ceremonies varies with the degree
held. The bachelor's gown, for all grad
uating seniors, is very simple with only
long, pointed sleeves as its distinguishing
feature.
For master's degree recipients, the
gown has an oblong sleeve with the rear
part cut square and the front part with
a cutaway arc to avoid confusion with
the bachelor's degree candidates.
Only the doctor's gown, by far the most
elaborate academic costume, bears any
trimmings. These are velvet panels down
the front and three velvet bars across
the sleeves. The velvet is usually black,
or it may be a color designating the sub
ject in which the wearer holds a degree.
Some American universities also have

doctoral robes, which are a color other
than black.
At Stanford, these doctoral robes are
black and red with sleeves lined in a
color indicating the academic field of the
wearer. A specially designed hood and a
velvet academic bonnet are worn with
these distinguished robes.
Hoods have an even larger symbolic
meaning. The width of the trimming in
dicates the level of the degree and the
colors of the lining are those of the college
or university which granted the degree.
The Cardinal is used for Stanford. The
color of the binding or edging heralds
the mt\jor field of study.
Full spectrum of colors
White stands for the humanities; the
sciences use golden yellow; crimson is for
communication students; copper repre
sents economics; orange is for engineer
ing; dark blue is philosophy; pink is for
music; brown for the fine arts; the law
graduates wear purple; light blue is for
the School of Education; green for med
icine; and drab (yes, drab) for the Grad
uate School of Business
So chances of even a Phi Beta Kappa
double-mtyoring, honors student being
mistaken for anything but a lowly under
graduate are slim. This complex sysytem
of color coding just does not lend itself
to the bachelor's degree candidates. At
least the "mortarboard" cap is the same
for everyone. Black with a cloth cover,
the cap has its standard black tassel,

although those worn with doctoral robes
may have a gold tassel.
The mortarboard is the only unifying
feature of academic dress across degrees
at a Stanford graduation.
Unless, of course, you happen to be
graduating from the Civil Engineering
Department with a concentration in con
struction. Those graduates better get
ready to trade mortarboard for a cap of
a different sort. These graduates wear
hard hats at their departmental cere
mony.
Departmental differences
Dress is not the only trait distinguish
ing Stanford graduates. Although every
body takes part in the University
ceremony held at Stanford Stadium, spe
cial departmental ceremonies honor the
individual. Immediately following the
general Commencement festivities, these
smaller diploma ceremonies are more in
timate and personal.
Usually graduates and their families
feast at a reception before or after the
actual diploma ceremony. Rumor has it
that double minors decide which gradu
ation to attend on the basis of the gour
met delights being served.
Most departments, however, report
fairly traditional goings-on at their cer
emonies. In fact, only the African and
Afro-American Studies Department
deviates from the usual post-Stadium
graduation format. Since most graduates
in Afro-American Studies are double

majors, the department schedules its di
ploma ceremony for late afternoon so
students can attend both. Afro-
American Studies also has the advantage
of holding its ceremony on the cool and
shady deck of Elliott Program Center, a
lucky break for grandmothers who are
feeling the heat.
Location is key
Not all departments are so fortunate:
Many individual ceremonies are held out
side without benefit of shade. Computer
science majors graduate in the Old Union
Courtyard and electrical engineers pick
up their degrees on Roble Field. Political
Science meyors at least have the shady
Bowman Alumni Grove. Given the choice,
however, most Human Biology majors
don't mind sweating a little given that
their prime setting is the Inner Quad.
And English mtyors always gloat when
they tell you their graduation is in
Memorial Church,
The biggest difference between the in
dividual diploma award ceremonies and
the Commencement exercises in the Sta
dium, however, has very little to do with
geography. The zany irreverance and
Hying champagne corks that characterize
the general Commencement disappear in
favor of more sedate formality And it is
at these small ceremonies that you can
sit and ponder the meaning of graduation
. . . and know that all those colors and
trimmings on Kennedy's robe stand for
academic tradition.
