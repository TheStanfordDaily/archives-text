# Senior gifts, pledges and time capsules:
## 1. A gift with a difference 
### Alex Camacho 
Once upon a
time, there
was a single
senior pledge. The
graduates gave money,
time or addresses for
'future aid to Univer
sity endeavors.
Now, the options
have multiplied. A
senior can choose to
pledge to explore the
environmental conse
quences of a job or
career; bolster funds
for undergraduate
housing; or leave be
hind a momento of the
year for others to un
cover in the coming
years.
Here is a friendly,
step-by-step guide de
scribing the varied —
though sometimes
confusing — choices
available.

One year it was three park
benches. Last year, the graduating
class gave newsracks — which
have yet to show up — to Stern
Dining Hall. Such mementos are
the legacy of graduated Stanford
seniors. Can the Class of 1989 top
the Senior Gifts of the past?
You bet, says Julie Lythcott,
one of this year's senior class
presidents.
The days of the Senior Gift
being little more than a token ges
ture may be gone if this year's
presidents have their way. Hoping
to leave Stanford with one sub
stantial, memorable gift, the four
presidents have made a complete
break with tradition and paired
the Senior Gift with the Senior
Pledge (a commitment by seniors
to give money, volunteer service
to the university or leave their
name on file with the Alumni As
sociation). By combining the two,
this year's graduating class is gun
ning to leave the Farm by making
a serious, lasting statement: Un
dergraduates deserve four years
of adequate housing.

An ad in The Daily a couple of
weeks ago alerted seniors to the
task at hand: "Make a significant
change. In order to leave behind
a Senior Gift with lasting meaning
and impact, the Senior Gift is
joining the Senior Pledge to make
a push for Undergraduate
Housing."
Generally, the senior class can

oniy afford to spend about $1,000
for a Senior Gift. "The money is
small and you never know how
much the money will be," Lyth
cott explains. Unfortunately, this
leads to a preponderance of mean
ingless gifts, or as in last year's
case, no gift at all. The Class of
'89 wants to do better than their
predecessors.
Many seniors have already
agreed independently, to the fi-

cial option included in the Senior
Pledge — a commitment to give
the University $100 over the next
five years. If all seniors decide to
earmark Undergraduate Housing
as the area where they want their
pledge money to go, then the
Senior Gift/Pledge might add up
to something.

Gift — the speakers' platform

that recent alums remember what
is was like living in the Manzanita
trailers or miles off campus.
According to Lythcott, future
generations "are going to need our
help as much as we needed the
help from those before us." What
better way to leave a visible mark
on Stanford than to push for a
better standard of living on
campus.
