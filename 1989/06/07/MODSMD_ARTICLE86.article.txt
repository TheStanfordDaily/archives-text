# 2. A pledge of awareness
## 
### Jennifer Schmid 
Many students marching
through graduation will carry
more than just a program listing
Sunday morning's events.
Some will also have in hand a
plain diploma-size sheet of paper
that reads: "I pledge to thoroughly
investigate and take into account
the social and environmental con
sequences of any job opportunity
I consider." A place appears at
the bottom of the sheet for the
bearer to sign his or her name.
The Graduation Pledge of En
vironmental and Social Responsi
bility, the first ever to be intro
duced into Commencement cere
monies here, was designed by stu
dents at Stanford and other uni
versities around the country to
increase societal responsibility
among graduates as they enter the
workforce.
Each of the approximately
4,000 students expected at grad
uation will get a chance to pick
up a copy of the pledge when they
enter the stadium before ceremo
nies, according to graduate stu
dent Diane Honigberg, coordina
tor of the Graduation Pledge Al

liance.
The Graduation Pledge Alliance
is a coalition of 19 student organ
izations at Stanford who intro
duced the pledge as a referendum
in this spring's ASSU general elec
tions. Sixty-five percent of the
voting students approved the ref
erendum, providing graduates
with the opportunity to sign the
pledge.
Honigberg said students who
choose to sign the pledge will be
"signing an oath of conscience
(which) reinforces the graduate's
sense of his or her responsibility
to society."
Stanford is not the first nor
the only university to include the
pledge in its graduation ceremo
nies.
The pledge was introduced at
Humboldt State University last
year and since then has spread
across the nation to schools such
as MIT and San Francisco State
University.
According to Honigberg, at least
six schools in California — includ
ing UC-Berkeley and UC-Santa
Cruz — are including the pledge
in their commencement ceremo
nies.
