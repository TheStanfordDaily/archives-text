# Making some sense of the contributions
## 3. Seniors offer assistance 
### Jon Weisman 
Introducing the new and im
proved Senior Pledge.
Senior Pledge cuts through
grime and grease, without leaving
those annoying streaks on your
table or countertop. It's available
in three scents: Luscious Lemon,
Merry Mango or Very Berry.
Well, that's not exactly true.
Though some seniors still may not
know this, the Senior Pledge is
actually a promise members of the
Class of 1989 may choose to make,
a promise to continue to contrib
ute in some way to Stanford now
that their undergraduate years
are behind them.
Specifically, seniors can choose
any or all of three options.
Graduation-bound seniors can
contribute $100 to the University
over the next five years, or pledge
eight hours per year of volunteer
work. Or, if seniors cannot com
mit to contributing at this time,
they can simply promise to keep
Stanford informed of his or her
current address.
According to Senior Pledge Co-
Chair Julia Cosma, promoting the
latter two options has made re
sponse to the Senior Pledge
"much more favorable this year."
Last year, with monetary contri
butions emphasized more, many
seniors resented being asked for
money immediately after paying
four years worth of steep tuition.
"We made the volunteering op
tion much more prominent this
year," Cosma said. "You could al
ways volunteer but the option
used to be much more hidden. . . .
If you think about what an
average person will make after
Stanford, it's actually more valu
able (to volunteer)."
Still, Cosma didn't want to
downplay the option to contribute
money. Though she recognizes the
complaints of students who are
offended that the University
would ask, before a student has
even graduated, for more money,
Cosma points out that tuition at
Stanford would be doubled with
out alumni contributions.
"I've learned a lot about how
the University operates and how
much it would really cost if we

didn't have alumni helping us,"
Cosma said. "It can totally blow
your mind if you really look at it."
Also, the cash itself is only one
aspect of the contribution. In
coordination with the Senior Class
Presidents, it was decided that
this year's Senior Gift would be
for seniors to earmark their
Senior Pledge toward undergradu
ate housing. Thus, although the
amount of money (the long-term
goal of the Senior Plege committee
is $50,000) may be relatively
small, the statement could be
large.
"Yes, the University makes a
lot of money," Cosma said. "But
when people give money they can
earmark it. That's a very positive
way to get the administration to
see what is important to students.
"Granted, [the money being
raised] is not very much," Cosma
continued. "But it makes a very
strong statement that we are
aware of how the University
operates. Alumni look at that. So
if half the senior class makes a
donation for undergraduate
housing, that's a strong sell."
Senior Pledge committee ad
viser Laurel Theodore of the Of
fice of Development pointed out
that monetary contributions by
seniors will be matched dollar-for
dollar by Board of Trustees mem
ber Roy Anderson, though his do
nation will go to an undergradu
ate scholarship fund.
However, though the response
has been better this year, there
has still remained a problem with
publicity. In a moderate effort to
combat this problem, the Senior
Pledge committee linked with the
senior class' Connection '89 pro
gram, which sent information to
seniors quarterly, has helped get
out the word about the Senior
Pledge and ease the shock of being
asked for contributions.
"I think they've improved the
image somewhat," said senior Jen
nifer Huffman, who helped run
Connection '89. "Everyone wants
the Pub Night calendar, so I think
that exposes it more."
Still, there are many seniors
who don't know the Senior Pledge
from the Class of 1988's Gradu
ation Pledge of Environmental

and Social Responsibility, Lemon
Pledge or the Pledge of Allegiance.
"What the hell is it?" asked
senior Bruce Robinson, although
he was nearing completion of his
final piece of undergraduate work.
Another senior, Ken Wolfson,
indicated that the Connection '89
mailings were not an unqualified
success.
"I never read any of that stuff,"
Wolfson said. "You get those inch

thick packets, you throw it all
away. It's all on that green and
yellow and pink paper. . . . It's ob
noxious, and I throw it out."
According to Cosma, though
publicity of the Senior Pledge was
not all-encompassing, that still did
not speak negatively about the re
sponse.
"What we consider to be a good
showing isn't a large number,"
Cosma said.

when people give money they can
earmark it. That's a very positive
way to get the administration to
see what is important to students.
"Granted, [the money being
raised] is not very much," Cosma
continued. "But it makes a very
strong statement that we are
aware of how the University
operates. Alumni look at that. So
if half the senior class makes a
donation for undergraduate
housing, that's a strong sell."
Senior Pledge committee ad
viser Laurel Theodore of the Of
fice of Development pointed out
that monetary contributions by
seniors will be matched dollar-for
dollar by Board of Trustees mem
ber Roy Anderson, though his do
nation will go to an undergradu
ate scholarship fund.
However, though the response
has been better this year, there
has still remained a problem with
publicity. In a moderate effort to
combat this problem, the Senior
Pledge committee linked with the
senior class' Connection '89 pro
gram, which sent information to
seniors quarterly, has helped get
out the word about the Senior
Pledge and ease the shock of being
asked for contributions.
"I think they've improved the
image somewhat," said senior Jen
nifer Huffman, who helped run
Connection '89. "Everyone wants
the Pub Night calendar, so I think
that exposes it more."
Still, there are many seniors
who don't know the Senior Pledge
from the Class of 1988's Gradu
ation Pledge of Environmental

and Social Responsibility, Lemon
Pledge or the Pledge of Allegiance.
"What the hell is it?" asked
senior Bruce Robinson, although
he was nearing completion of his
final piece of undergraduate work.
Another senior, Ken Wolfson,
indicated that the Connection '89
mailings were not an unqualified
success.
"I never read any of that stuff,"
Wolfson said. "You get those inch

thick packets, you throw it all
away. It's all on that green and
yellow and pink paper. . . . It's ob
noxious, and I throw it out."
According to Cosma, though
publicity of the Senior Pledge was
not all-encompassing, that still did
not speak negatively about the re
sponse.
"What we consider to be a good
showing isn't a large number,"
Cosma said.

Introducing the new and im
proved Senior Pledge.
Senior Pledge cuts through
grime and grease, without leaving
those annoying streaks on your
table or countertop. It's available
in three scents: Luscious Lemon,
Merry Mango or Very Berry.
Well, that's not exactly true.
Though some seniors still may not
know this, the Senior Pledge is
actually a promise members of the
Class of 1989 may choose to make,
a promise to continue to contrib
ute in some way to Stanford now
that their undergraduate years
are behind them.
Specifically, seniors can choose
any or all of three options.
Graduation-bound seniors can
contribute $100 to the University
over the next five years, or pledge
eight hours per year of volunteer
work. Or, if seniors cannot com
mit to contributing at this time,
they can simply promise to keep
Stanford informed of his or her
current address.
According to Senior Pledge Co-
Chair Julia Cosma, promoting the
latter two options has made re
sponse to the Senior Pledge
"much more favorable this year."
Last year, with monetary contri
butions emphasized more, many
seniors resented being asked for
money immediately after paying
four years worth of steep tuition.
"We made the volunteering op
tion much more prominent this
year," Cosma said. "You could al
ways volunteer but the option
used to be much more hidden. . . .
If you think about what an
average person will make after
Stanford, it's actually more valu
able (to volunteer)."
Still, Cosma didn't want to
downplay the option to contribute
money. Though she recognizes the
complaints of students who are
offended that the University
would ask, before a student has
even graduated, for more money,
Cosma points out that tuition at
Stanford would be doubled with
out alumni contributions.
"I've learned a lot about how
the University operates and how
much it would really cost if we

didn't have alumni helping us,"
Cosma said. "It can totally blow
your mind if you really look at it."
Also, the cash itself is only one
aspect of the contribution. In
coordination with the Senior Class
Presidents, it was decided that
this year's Senior Gift would be
for seniors to earmark their
Senior Pledge toward undergradu
ate housing. Thus, although the
amount of money (the long-term
goal of the Senior Plege committee
is $50,000) may be relatively
small, the statement could be
large.
"Yes, the University makes a
lot of money," Cosma said. "But
when people give money they can
earmark it. That's a very positive
way to get the administration to
see what is important to students.
"Granted, [the money being
raised] is not very much," Cosma
