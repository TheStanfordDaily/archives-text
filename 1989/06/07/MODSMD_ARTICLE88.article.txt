# 4. Stanford encapsulated
## 
### Alex Camacho 
A pack of condoms, a senior
T-shirt, a vial of dirt from Lake
Lagunita.
Those are just some of the mem
ories that will be sealed away this
Saturday at 10:30 a.m. The low
ering of the senior time capsule
into the ground of the Inner Quad
is a 96-year-old tradition not to
be missed.
All seniors are invited to throw
their student IDs into the time
capsule hole before it's covered by
the Senior Plaque, easily identifi
able by the bold '89 numerals.
University Provost James Rosse
and this year's Senior Class Presi
dents — Julie Lythcott, Preston
Hammer, Catherine Jovicich and
Dinesh Vazirani — will conduct
the ceremony.
The graduating class of 1896
was the first to place a plaque in
the Quad. It lies directly in front
of the entrance to Memorial
Church and reads '96 whether
you're going into or coming out
of the church. The four previous
graduating classes laid their
plaques retroactively behind the
first time capsule. Plaque after
plaque progresses around the In
ner Quad jumping from one year
to the next. The plaques will com
plete their first march around the
Quad in 2403.
Who came up with the clever
idea to seal away Stanford's past
for generations to come?
Class of 1896 treasurer Robert
Campbell deserves the credit.
Class member Myron Folsom
helped Campbell by submitting a
letter to then-University Presi
dent David Starr Jordan. Jordan
gave the idea his OK and a Stan
ford tradition was born.
It is unknown whether any
thing is buried under that first
plaque. We do know, however, of
items beneath the plaques of 1892
through 1894.
When the front of Memorial
Church was restored in 1981,
workers unearthed time-capsules
of a sort. Under the 1892 rested
a cardboard tube sealed over in
mud. Inside was a vellum parch
ment signed by 28 members of
the Class of '92. Under '93 and

'94 are sealed lead tubes.
None of the time capsules has
yet to be officially opened. Thanks
to old Dailys, old archives and
not-so-old Stanford tour guides,
here is a list of some unusual
items laid to rest in previous
years:
• can of Diet Coke
• can of New Coke
• Tower Commission Report
• AIDS Awareness flier
• Stanford baseball cap
• Thriller album
• Risky Business sunglasses
• brick from the Inner Quad
• Chili's menu
• freeze-dried book from the
basement of Meyer Library
(flooded in Nov. '78)
• Dolly boot (they used to wear
white go-go boots!)
• an "O" Burger (mmm-yummy,
especially after 50 to 100 years
underground!)
Items are tightly sealed away
in a 15-by-15-by-15 inch stainless
steel box. No one knows when the
first box like this was used as the
time capsule; but for the past 10
years, Wade Hall, an employee at
Operations and Maintenance has
made them. He and the four
senior class presidents will seal
certain items inside before the
dedication ceremony Saturday
morning.
The sealed items are chosen to
signify events and common
themes of the graduating class.
An ad for the Class of '89 asked
for "items representing distinctive
characteristics of our class." Pre
vious years chose things represen
tative of all four of their under
graduate years. The '89 capsule
will be focused on the graduating
year itself, '88-89.
Most students believe the time
capsules are opened up 100 years
after burial. This is only a myth.
The class presidents decide when
the capsule will be opened. Some,
like the Class of '88, agreed on
that century date. Others prefer
opening it at their 50th reunion
(like the Class of '82). Lythcott
is looking into the possibility of
having the '89 capsule opened at
their 50th reunion, then sealed
and buried again to be re-opened
in another 50 years.

workers unearthed time-capsules
of a sort. Under the 1892 rested
a cardboard tube sealed over in
mud. Inside was a vellum parch
ment signed by 28 members of
the Class of '92. Under '93 and

'94 are sealed lead tubes.
None of the time capsules has
yet to be officially opened. Thanks
to old Dailys, old archives and
not-so-old Stanford tour guides,
here is a list of some unusual
items laid to rest in previous
years:
• can of Diet Coke
• can of New Coke
• Tower Commission Report
• AIDS Awareness flier
• Stanford baseball cap
• Thriller album
• Risky Business sunglasses
• brick from the Inner Quad
• Chili's menu
• freeze-dried book from the
basement of Meyer Library
(flooded in Nov. '78)
• Dolly boot (they used to wear
white go-go boots!)
• an "O" Burger (mmm-yummy,
especially after 50 to 100 years
underground!)
Items are tightly sealed away
in a 15-by-15-by-15 inch stainless
steel box. No one knows when the
first box like this was used as the
time capsule; but for the past 10
years, Wade Hall, an employee at
Operations and Maintenance has
made them. He and the four
senior class presidents will seal
certain items inside before the
dedication ceremony Saturday
morning.
The sealed items are chosen to
signify events and common
themes of the graduating class.
An ad for the Class of '89 asked
for "items representing distinctive
characteristics of our class." Pre
vious years chose things represen
tative of all four of their under
graduate years. The '89 capsule
will be focused on the graduating
year itself, '88-89.
Most students believe the time
capsules are opened up 100 years
after burial. This is only a myth.
The class presidents decide when
the capsule will be opened. Some,
like the Class of '88, agreed on
that century date. Others prefer
opening it at their 50th reunion
(like the Class of '82). Lythcott
is looking into the possibility of
having the '89 capsule opened at
their 50th reunion, then sealed
and buried again to be re-opened
in another 50 years.
