# Yes, there is definitely life after Stanford...

### Mark Tompkins 
Seniors who will be graduating
this Sunday have a lot to be ex
cited about. No more finals, for
one thing. No more lining up to
pay tuition bills the first day of
each quarter. No more waiting at
the Post Office. No more "All
Right Now."
And after graduation, Stanford
students finally get to put their
— as opposed to their parents' —
money where their mouths are,
and see what they can do on their
own.
1989 graduates will be accept
ing all sorts of jobs (or at least
looking for them) and attending
graduate schools all over the
world. Every senior probably
knows at least one classmate who
will be settling into a comfortably
upholstered job in Silicon Valley
or on Wall Street. This has be
come the prototype, not to men
tion the stereotype, of the
post-Stanford career. But what
about the seniors who are taking
a step out of the mainstream?
The truth is that the stereotype
doesn't really hold up. Members
of the class of '89 will be following
an almost bewildering variety of
unexpected and intriguing career
paths. (Many of them don't even
feel the need to start thinking in
terms of "a career" yet). Indeed,
a sampling of just five seniors
gives a good indication of just how
disparate the class of 89's future
plans are.
When he first came to Stanford,
fifth-year senior Bill Barenboim
expected to have "a boring but
well-paying electrical engineering
job in New Jersey," as he puts it,
upon graduating.
But it was never meant to be.
At the end of his junior year,
Barenboim realized he hated his
EE major and switched to Slavic
Languages and VTSS (Values,
Technology, Science and Society).
His afterhours hobby, being a
DJ, also began to take off. This

year, his DJ business, known as
Divine Beat Sounds, started get
ting six or seven party requests
per weekend.
Inspired by the success of the
three "Work-It-Wicked" nights
Divine Beat Sounds hosted at The
Vortex, a Palo Alto dance club,
Barenboim wants to try his luck
in the music business. In July,
he'll try to make some contacts
at the record industry's annual
New Music Seminar in New York
City. Breaking into the record
business is difficult, he says, but
once people start to know you,
your reputation can assure you
of a job.
Like Barenboim, senior Carolyn
Bell finds that her graduation
plans are radically different from
what she thought they'd be as a
freshman. "I shiver to think of
it," she says.
Bell planned to follow a pre-med
track at Stanford, but upon seeing
what courses she would have had
to take, said, "This is just no fun,"
and wound up majoring in eco
nomics.
Her immediate post-graduation
plans have little to do with her
econ major, however. On June
23rd, she'll fly to Vienna, where
she will work as an au pair for
two months.
When a Viennese couple put an
ad in The Daily, saying that they
were looking for an au pair from
the Stanford community, Bell ap
plied for the job on a lark. "I
never thought I'd get it," she says.
But come next week, she'll be in
the beautiful Austrian capital,
taking care of two boys who are
one and two years old. In two
months, the head of the
household, a doctor, will be com
ing to the Stanford Medical Center
to do research. He chose an au
pair from Stanford because he
wanted someone to help bring his
family over, Bell explains.
"The biggest part of my job will
be the one day when I help them
get through customs," says Bell,

who has taken two quarters'
worth of German.
Bell is elated about returning
to Europe, because her time with
the Stanford-in-Krakow program
a year ago was her most reward
ing experience as an undergradu
ate. "It's still influencing me," she

comments.
"I am so excited to get out of
here," she concludes. "Coming
here was definitely one of the best
decisions of my life, but when I
came back from Europe I felt
really disoriented. It seemed so
unreal here. I feel really fortunate
to have been exposed to all the
people here. But I'm very, very,
very glad to leave."
About the time that Bell
returns from Vienna, senior In
ternational Relations major Kristi
Jackson will be getting ready to
fly to West Berlin.
There she'll be taking political
science courses at Berlin's famous
Free University, and she may also
teach English at the
Volkshochschule Wedding, an
adult education school. At the
F.U., Jackson will be working
toward a Diplom, which is some
where between a masters and a
doctorate, she explains. This could
take her three or four years, de

pending on any language difficul
ties she encounters.
Like Bell, Jackson was deeply
affected by her Overseas Studies
experience. Her seven months
with Stanford-in-Berlin just
wasn't enough time, she says.
"There's so much to do there,"

she enthuses. "I felt a part of
Berlin. There's the appeal of the
city — ein fantastisches Staat —
and the appeal of taking classes
there without being part of an
American school program.
"I'm going somewhere where
there's a different life," Jackson
says. For this reason, she's happy
about graduating. While she got
a lot out of Stanford, she won't
be doing much looking back. Nos
talgia isn't her style, she explains.
As for the future, she says,"In
10 years, I want to be where I
want to be. I don't know where,
but I'll be in international rela
tions."
Like Jackson, senior Allison
Truitt, a fellow IR major, doesn't
have her future all worked out.
"I'll figure out my future as it
comes," she says."l don't have any
master plan for the rest of my
life — no'sso,ooo by age 25,
married at age 28, two kids by
age 32."'

Her plans for the immediate fu
ture are more certain, however.
After graduation Truitt will work
for SIETAR, the Society of Inter
cultural Education, Training And
Research, in Washington, D.C.
Truitt explains that SIETAR is
"an association of intercul
turalists, people who design cur
riculum to meet multicultural
issues or training programs for
expatriates." The non-profit or
ganization also draws upon sociol
ogy and anthropology to work on
development projects that require
intercultural liaisons and ad
visers.
Because SIETAR is a non-profit
group, the pay won't be all that
a Stanford graduate might hope
for, so Truitt will have to look for
a second job. Nonetheless, "I
think I'm fortunate because I can
take a position like this one," she
says.
"I think that living in so many
different places in Europe, and in
so many different conditions,
really sparked my interest in in
tercultural relations," Truitt ex
plains. "You realize there's more
than what they tell you in your
IR classes."
Whereas most Stanford stu
dents venture abroad for just one
quarter, if at all, Truitt was over
seas for two days shy of a year.
She attended the Florence pro
gram for a quarter, audited
courses at the University of
Florence, and studied German in
Lindau before spending spring
quarter with Stanford-in- Berlin.
Then it was on to a seminar in
Bregenz, Austria, and a month of
work on a construction camp in
Leipzig, East Germany.
This last experience was prob
ably the strangest part of Truitt's
continental odyssey, but she came
to enjoy it. "As soon as I learned
that they don't really work on an
East German construction camp
and that I, too, could take a lot
of breaks, it was a lot of fun."
Truitt says she's ready to grad

uate. But she adds, "I'm perplexed
when people say, 'the real world'
outside of Stanford, because I
think the real world is what you
make of it, wherever you are."
Vienna, Berlin, Washington,
D.C. — Stanford students find
some exciting places to go after
graduation. English Dave
Kurtz will be heading for Austin,
Texas, which, though not exactly
the glamour capital of the world,
does have its merits.
Chief among these for Kurtz is
a strong community theatre
scene, plus a relatively tolerable
cost-of-living. A Tallahassee, Flor
ida native, Kurtz isn't expecting
much culture shock once he gets
to Austin. "Give me another three
months, and I'll become a true
Southerner again."
Before he took up acting during
his sophomore year, Kurtz
thought he'd be applying to law
schools after graduation. "I was
almost certain," he says. "What
a goof."
Kurtz will stick around this
summer to star as Krapp in
Samuel Beckett's "Krapp's Last
Tape," one of the productions in
the Drama Department's Summer
Theatre Program. Then he'll be
off "to muck about Austin for a
year," as he puts it.
When his year of mucking about
is over, Kurtz isn't sure what'll
happen, but his long-term goal is
to become a director. Given the
chance, he says he'd direct movies,
but prefers theatre. "The problem
with doing movies is that you're
tied to realism. On the stage you
can really play."
Chances are that lots of Stan
ford graduates will become well
known, but remember Kurtz's
name. It may become a household
word. Before becoming a director,
he says he'd like to "get an M.F.A.
in acting somewhere, then go to
New York and become a world
famous actor and get lots of
babes."

terms of "a career" yet). Indeed,
a sampling of just five seniors
gives a good indication of just how
disparate the class of 89's future
plans are.
When he first came to Stanford,
fifth-year senior Bill Barenboim
expected to have "a boring but
well-paying electrical engineering
job in New Jersey," as he puts it,
upon graduating.
But it was never meant to be.
At the end of his junior year,
Barenboim realized he hated his
EE major and switched to Slavic
Languages and VTSS (Values,
Technology, Science and Society).
His afterhours hobby, being a
DJ, also began to take off. This

year, his DJ business, known as
Divine Beat Sounds, started get
ting six or seven party requests
per weekend.
Inspired by the success of the
three "Work-It-Wicked" nights
Divine Beat Sounds hosted at The
Vortex, a Palo Alto dance club,
Barenboim wants to try his luck
in the music business. In July,
he'll try to make some contacts
at the record industry's annual
New Music Seminar in New York
City. Breaking into the record
business is difficult, he says, but
once people start to know you,
your reputation can assure you
of a job.
Like Barenboim, senior Carolyn
Bell finds that her graduation
plans are radically different from
what she thought they'd be as a
freshman. "I shiver to think of
it," she says.
Bell planned to follow a pre-med
track at Stanford, but upon seeing
what courses she would have had
to take, said, "This is just no fun,"
and wound up majoring in eco
nomics.
Her immediate post-graduation
plans have little to do with her
econ major, however. On June
23rd, she'll fly to Vienna, where
she will work as an au pair for
two months.
When a Viennese couple put an
ad in The Daily, saying that they
were looking for an au pair from
the Stanford community, Bell ap
plied for the job on a lark. "I
never thought I'd get it," she says.
But come next week, she'll be in
the beautiful Austrian capital,
taking care of two boys who are
one and two years old. In two
months, the head of the
household, a doctor, will be com
ing to the Stanford Medical Center
to do research. He chose an au
pair from Stanford because he
wanted someone to help bring his
family over, Bell explains.
"The biggest part of my job will
be the one day when I help them
get through customs," says Bell,

who has taken two quarters'
worth of German.
Bell is elated about returning
to Europe, because her time with
the Stanford-in-Krakow program
a year ago was her most reward
ing experience as an undergradu
ate. "It's still influencing me," she

comments.
"I am so excited to get out of
here," she concludes. "Coming
here was definitely one of the best
decisions of my life, but when I
came back from Europe I felt
really disoriented. It seemed so
unreal here. I feel really fortunate
to have been exposed to all the
people here. But I'm very, very,
very glad to leave."
About the time that Bell
returns from Vienna, senior In
ternational Relations major Kristi
Jackson will be getting ready to
fly to West Berlin.
There she'll be taking political
science courses at Berlin's famous
Free University, and she may also
teach English at the
Volkshochschule Wedding, an
adult education school. At the
F.U., Jackson will be working
toward a Diplom, which is some
where between a masters and a
doctorate, she explains. This could
take her three or four years, de

pending on any language difficul
ties she encounters.
Like Bell, Jackson was deeply
affected by her Overseas Studies
experience. Her seven months
with Stanford-in-Berlin just
wasn't enough time, she says.
"There's so much to do there,"

she enthuses. "I felt a part of
Berlin. There's the appeal of the
city — ein fantastisches Staat —
and the appeal of taking classes
there without being part of an
American school program.
"I'm going somewhere where
there's a different life," Jackson
says. For this reason, she's happy
about graduating. While she got
a lot out of Stanford, she won't
be doing much looking back. Nos
talgia isn't her style, she explains.
As for the future, she says,"In
10 years, I want to be where I
want to be. I don't know where,
but I'll be in international rela
tions."
Like Jackson, senior Allison
Truitt, a fellow IR major, doesn't
have her future all worked out.
"I'll figure out my future as it
comes," she says."l don't have any
master plan for the rest of my
life — no'sso,ooo by age 25,
married at age 28, two kids by
age 32."'

Her plans for the immediate fu
ture are more certain, however.
After graduation Truitt will work
for SIETAR, the Society of Inter
cultural Education, Training And
Research, in Washington, D.C.
Truitt explains that SIETAR is
"an association of intercul
turalists, people who design cur
riculum to meet multicultural
issues or training programs for
expatriates." The non-profit or
ganization also draws upon sociol
ogy and anthropology to work on
development projects that require
intercultural liaisons and ad
visers.
Because SIETAR is a non-profit
group, the pay won't be all that
a Stanford graduate might hope
for, so Truitt will have to look for
a second job. Nonetheless, "I
think I'm fortunate because I can
take a position like this one," she
says.
"I think that living in so many
different places in Europe, and in
so many different conditions,
really sparked my interest in in
tercultural relations," Truitt ex
plains. "You realize there's more
than what they tell you in your
IR classes."
Whereas most Stanford stu
dents venture abroad for just one
quarter, if at all, Truitt was over
seas for two days shy of a year.
She attended the Florence pro
gram for a quarter, audited
courses at the University of
Florence, and studied German in
Lindau before spending spring
quarter with Stanford-in- Berlin.
Then it was on to a seminar in
Bregenz, Austria, and a month of
work on a construction camp in
Leipzig, East Germany.
This last experience was prob
ably the strangest part of Truitt's
continental odyssey, but she came
to enjoy it. "As soon as I learned
that they don't really work on an
East German construction camp
and that I, too, could take a lot
of breaks, it was a lot of fun."
Truitt says she's ready to grad

uate. But she adds, "I'm perplexed
when people say, 'the real world'
outside of Stanford, because I
think the real world is what you
make of it, wherever you are."
Vienna, Berlin, Washington,
D.C. — Stanford students find
some exciting places to go after
graduation. English Dave
Kurtz will be heading for Austin,
Texas, which, though not exactly
the glamour capital of the world,
does have its merits.
Chief among these for Kurtz is
a strong community theatre
scene, plus a relatively tolerable
cost-of-living. A Tallahassee, Flor
ida native, Kurtz isn't expecting
much culture shock once he gets
to Austin. "Give me another three
months, and I'll become a true
Southerner again."
Before he took up acting during
his sophomore year, Kurtz
thought he'd be applying to law
schools after graduation. "I was
almost certain," he says. "What
a goof."
Kurtz will stick around this
summer to star as Krapp in
Samuel Beckett's "Krapp's Last
Tape," one of the productions in
the Drama Department's Summer
Theatre Program. Then he'll be
off "to muck about Austin for a
year," as he puts it.
When his year of mucking about
is over, Kurtz isn't sure what'll
happen, but his long-term goal is
to become a director. Given the
chance, he says he'd direct movies,
but prefers theatre. "The problem
with doing movies is that you're
tied to realism. On the stage you
can really play."
Chances are that lots of Stan
ford graduates will become well
known, but remember Kurtz's
name. It may become a household
word. Before becoming a director,
he says he'd like to "get an M.F.A.
in acting somewhere, then go to
New York and become a world
famous actor and get lots of
babes."

Seniors who will be graduating
this Sunday have a lot to be ex
cited about. No more finals, for
one thing. No more lining up to
pay tuition bills the first day of
each quarter. No more waiting at
the Post Office. No more "All
Right Now."
And after graduation, Stanford
students finally get to put their
— as opposed to their parents' —
money where their mouths are,
and see what they can do on their
own.
1989 graduates will be accept
ing all sorts of jobs (or at least
looking for them) and attending
graduate schools all over the
world. Every senior probably
knows at least one classmate who
will be settling into a comfortably
upholstered job in Silicon Valley
or on Wall Street. This has be
come the prototype, not to men
tion the stereotype, of the
post-Stanford career. But what
about the seniors who are taking
a step out of the mainstream?
The truth is that the stereotype
doesn't really hold up. Members
of the class of '89 will be following
an almost bewildering variety of
unexpected and intriguing career
paths. (Many of them don't even
feel the need to start thinking in
terms of "a career" yet). Indeed,

once people start to know you,
your reputation can assure you
of a job.
Like Barenboim, senior Carolyn
Bell finds that her graduation
plans are radically different from
what she thought they'd be as a
freshman. "I shiver to think of
it," she says.
Bell planned to follow a pre-med
track at Stanford, but upon seeing
what courses she would have had
to take, said, "This is just no fun,"
and wound up majoring in eco
nomics.
Her immediate post-graduation
plans have little to do with her
econ major, however. On June
23rd, she'll fly to Vienna, where
she will work as an au pair for
two months.
When a Viennese couple put an
ad in The Daily, saying that they
were looking for an au pair from
the Stanford community, Bell ap
plied for the job on a lark. "I
never thought I'd get it," she says.
But come next week, she'll be in
the beautiful Austrian capital,
taking care of two boys who are
one and two years old. In two
months, the head of the
household, a doctor, will be com
ing to the Stanford Medical Center
to do research. He chose an au
pair from Stanford because he
wanted someone to help bring his
family over, Bell explains.
"The biggest part of my job will
be the one day when I help them
get through customs," says Bell,

who has taken two quarters'
worth of German.
Bell is elated about returning
to Europe, because her time with
the Stanford-in-Krakow program
a year ago was her most reward
ing experience as an undergradu
ate. "It's still influencing me," she

comments.
"I am so excited to get out of
here," she concludes. "Coming
here was definitely one of the best
decisions of my life, but when I
came back from Europe I felt
really disoriented. It seemed so
unreal here. I feel really fortunate
to have been exposed to all the
people here. But I'm very, very,
very glad to leave."
About the time that Bell
returns from Vienna, senior In
ternational Relations major Kristi
Jackson will be getting ready to
fly to West Berlin.
There she'll be taking political
science courses at Berlin's famous
Free University, and she may also
teach English at the
Volkshochschule Wedding, an
adult education school. At the
F.U., Jackson will be working
toward a Diplom, which is some
where between a masters and a
doctorate, she explains. This could
take her three or four years, de

pending on any language difficul
ties she encounters.
Like Bell, Jackson was deeply
affected by her Overseas Studies
experience. Her seven months
with Stanford-in-Berlin just
wasn't enough time, she says.
"There's so much to do there,"

she enthuses. "I felt a part of
Berlin. There's the appeal of the
city — ein fantastisches Staat —
and the appeal of taking classes
there without being part of an
American school program.
"I'm going somewhere where
there's a different life," Jackson
says. For this reason, she's happy
about graduating. While she got
a lot out of Stanford, she won't
be doing much looking back. Nos
talgia isn't her style, she explains.
As for the future, she says,"In
10 years, I want to be where I
want to be. I don't know where,
but I'll be in international rela
tions."
Like Jackson, senior Allison
Truitt, a fellow IR major, doesn't
have her future all worked out.
"I'll figure out my future as it
comes," she says."l don't have any
master plan for the rest of my
life — no'sso,ooo by age 25,
married at age 28, two kids by
age 32."'

Her plans for the immediate fu
ture are more certain, however.
After graduation Truitt will work
for SIETAR, the Society of Inter
cultural Education, Training And
Research, in Washington, D.C.
Truitt explains that SIETAR is
"an association of intercul
turalists, people who design cur
riculum to meet multicultural
issues or training programs for
expatriates." The non-profit or
ganization also draws upon sociol
ogy and anthropology to work on
development projects that require
intercultural liaisons and ad
visers.
Because SIETAR is a non-profit
group, the pay won't be all that
a Stanford graduate might hope
for, so Truitt will have to look for
a second job. Nonetheless, "I
think I'm fortunate because I can
take a position like this one," she
says.
"I think that living in so many
different places in Europe, and in
so many different conditions,
really sparked my interest in in
tercultural relations," Truitt ex
plains. "You realize there's more
than what they tell you in your
IR classes."
Whereas most Stanford stu
dents venture abroad for just one
quarter, if at all, Truitt was over
seas for two days shy of a year.
She attended the Florence pro
gram for a quarter, audited
courses at the University of
Florence, and studied German in
Lindau before spending spring
quarter with Stanford-in- Berlin.
Then it was on to a seminar in
Bregenz, Austria, and a month of
work on a construction camp in
Leipzig, East Germany.
This last experience was prob
ably the strangest part of Truitt's
continental odyssey, but she came
to enjoy it. "As soon as I learned
that they don't really work on an
East German construction camp
and that I, too, could take a lot
of breaks, it was a lot of fun."
Truitt says she's ready to grad

uate. But she adds, "I'm perplexed
when people say, 'the real world'
outside of Stanford, because I
think the real world is what you
make of it, wherever you are."
Vienna, Berlin, Washington,
D.C. — Stanford students find
some exciting places to go after
graduation. English Dave
Kurtz will be heading for Austin,
Texas, which, though not exactly
the glamour capital of the world,
does have its merits.
Chief among these for Kurtz is
a strong community theatre
scene, plus a relatively tolerable
cost-of-living. A Tallahassee, Flor
ida native, Kurtz isn't expecting
much culture shock once he gets
to Austin. "Give me another three
months, and I'll become a true
Southerner again."
Before he took up acting during
his sophomore year, Kurtz
thought he'd be applying to law
schools after graduation. "I was
almost certain," he says. "What
a goof."
Kurtz will stick around this
summer to star as Krapp in
Samuel Beckett's "Krapp's Last
Tape," one of the productions in
the Drama Department's Summer
Theatre Program. Then he'll be
off "to muck about Austin for a
year," as he puts it.
When his year of mucking about
is over, Kurtz isn't sure what'll
happen, but his long-term goal is
to become a director. Given the
chance, he says he'd direct movies,
but prefers theatre. "The problem
with doing movies is that you're
tied to realism. On the stage you
can really play."
Chances are that lots of Stan
ford graduates will become well
known, but remember Kurtz's
name. It may become a household
word. Before becoming a director,
he says he'd like to "get an M.F.A.
in acting somewhere, then go to
New York and become a world
famous actor and get lots of
babes."

Seniors who will be graduating
this Sunday have a lot to be ex
cited about. No more finals, for
one thing. No more lining up to
pay tuition bills the first day of
each quarter. No more waiting at
the Post Office. No more "All
Right Now."
And after graduation, Stanford
students finally get to put their
— as opposed to their parents' —
money where their mouths are,
and see what they can do on their
own.
1989 graduates will be accept
ing all sorts of jobs (or at least
looking for them) and attending
graduate schools all over the
world. Every senior probably
knows at least one classmate who
will be settling into a comfortably
upholstered job in Silicon Valley
or on Wall Street. This has be
come the prototype, not to men
tion the stereotype, of the
post-Stanford career. But what
about the seniors who are taking
a step out of the mainstream?
The truth is that the stereotype
doesn't really hold up. Members
of the class of '89 will be following
an almost bewildering variety of
unexpected and intriguing career
paths. (Many of them don't even
feel the need to start thinking in
terms of "a career" yet). Indeed,
a sampling of just five seniors
gives a good indication of just how
disparate the class of 89's future
plans are.
When he first came to Stanford,
fifth-year senior Bill Barenboim
expected to have "a boring but
well-paying electrical engineering
job in New Jersey," as he puts it,
upon graduating.
But it was never meant to be.
At the end of his junior year,
Barenboim realized he hated his
EE major and switched to Slavic
Languages and VTSS (Values,
Technology, Science and Society).
His afterhours hobby, being a
DJ, also began to take off. This

year, his DJ business, known as
Divine Beat Sounds, started get
ting six or seven party requests
per weekend.
Inspired by the success of the
three "Work-It-Wicked" nights
Divine Beat Sounds hosted at The
Vortex, a Palo Alto dance club,
Barenboim wants to try his luck
in the music business. In July,
he'll try to make some contacts
at the record industry's annual
New Music Seminar in New York
City. Breaking into the record
business is difficult, he says, but
once people start to know you,
your reputation can assure you
of a job.
Like Barenboim, senior Carolyn
Bell finds that her graduation
