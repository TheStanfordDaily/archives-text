# Kennedy in exclusive interview:
## Open discussion survives 
### Brad Hayward Senior staff writer 
In an hour-long interview yes
terday, University President
Donald Kennedy said neither the
University's value of open discus
sion nor its public image has been
hurt by the past year's trying
events that culminated in the
takeover of his office.
Harking back to his year
opening Orientation address to
the freshmen, Kennedy said his
stress on unity among members
of "the Stanford family" was not
undermined by events this year.
"There's certainly been anger,
pain and damage. I think those
things are a part of the lives of
families," he said. "In many ways
our community has shown a lot
of resilience this year.
Kennedy added, however, that
he was struck this year by how
misunderstood the Fundamental
Standard is by both students and
staff. One of his primary objec

tives next fall will be to develop
a statement that describes "what
our expectations and convictions
?re" and clarifies what kinds of
dhavior can be prosecuted under
the Policy on Campus Disruption
and the Fundamental Standard as
it exists.
"I want to make it very clear
that we're not going to have it
(the office takeover) again," he
said.
In addition, Kennedy sato he
will aim to "get the a
little bit out of the position he
now occupies. We've slipped into
a mindset that the president has
to meet regularly with everybody.
He said that he will be delegat
ing more responsibility for meet
ing with various groups to other
Jniversity officials next year.
Kennedy said that his main
worry as a result of the office
takeover is that critics outside the
University will use that event and
the resulting discussion as proof
that "Stanford knuckles under."
