# A 						STEP into teaching
## 
### Mia Manzulli 
Like most of her friends, senior Tamar
Dorftnan i« graduating this Sunday. But
she doesn't have to say goodbye to Stanford
— not even for the summer.
No, Dorfman's not "going co-term" to
land a more prestigious, high-paving job.
And she's not here just because she wants
to hang out underneath the palm trees a
little longer.
Like 61 other recent graduates, Dorfman
will spend her "fifth year" in the Stanford
Teacher Education Program (STEP).
Everyone knows that good teachers are
hard to come by these days. But if STEP
had its way, aualified secondary school
teachers would be the rule rather than the
exception.
As a 12-month, fifth-year program,
STEP is committed to the excellent pro
fessional preparation for high school teach
ers. As part of the School of Education at
Stanfora, STEP guides students toward a
consciousness of their values, teaching
styles, talents and subject matter knowl
edge. Learning for these seniors involves
time in and out of the classroom — both
as student and teacher. They will partici
pate in a concurrent, year-long teaching
stint at a local school.
Many of the seniors going on to STEP
are not really sure how they will like teach
ing. But they are all determined to con
tribute and improve the American
educational system. For them, STEP
seemed like the logical path to finding the
training and experience they need.
"I hope that teaching will one day be
treated as more of a profession," Dorfman
says, expressing a common concern in the
education community. "Teaching is really
challenging and you really need to be
prepared. Education in the United States
needs help, and teaching is pretty central
to it all."
Senior Jeff Gilbert says he is "encouraged
by the fact that people here at Stanford
consider teaching as a chance to do some
good. It's not looked down upon here. And

'I hope that teaching will
one day be treated aa more
of a profession. Education
in the United States needs
help, and teaching Is pretty
central to It all.'

there's a real concern about it." He adds
that there are plenty of problems in edu
cation and that teaching "is not a cure-all.
We can't do everything."
Lynn Koontz believes that the classroom
is the best place to start learning about
what they can do, however. "I think we
instinctively know how to teach from
watching others and seeing what worked
and what didn't," says Koontz. "I really
want to put all that into practice by taking
the best of what I've learned and using it."
And senior Louis Alonso will also be
giving it his all in the classroom: "I really
want to learn how to convey information
in a fun manner for the students and for
myself. I hope to learn different methods
of teaching so I can motivate students to
really learn."
"I plan to stay in teaching," says Koontz.
"Working one-on-one with students is most
fulfilling. You can see immediate results
and know that you really make a differ
ence."
Alonso recalls that a high school teacher
discouraged him from teaching. "He told
me I was too bright and that it wasn't
lucrative enough. But he was only saying
it half-heartedly. He said it in hopes that
I'd only teach if I really wanted to do it."
Alonso and his STEP classmates want
to teach. And in this day and age, when
money and prestige are emphasized over
service and fufillment, finding qualified
students to go into teaching is rare indeed.
