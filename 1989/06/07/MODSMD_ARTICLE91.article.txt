# Welcome to the real world: a graduate's rude awakening
## 
### 
Editor's Note: Former Daily columnist
Jeff Raines took his bachelor's degree
and ran — out into the Real World.
Ah, but life was simpler in college so
he found out. And a return to
academia suits him just fine.
MANY OF US, no doubt, are
curious as to what the "Real
World" is like. I'm often
asked, "What's it like?" or, "Is it true
that nothing you learn here is rele
vant?" or more to the point, "Why
are you back?" Most students seem
to picture the real world in terms of
one-third contingency fees or record
number of gall bladders operated upon
or other such mixed-up notions. It's
evident that most Stanford students,
especially the grad students, haven't
the vaguest idea of what life on the
outside, off the Farm in the quaint
local parlance, is like.
I'm glad you asked. Imagine the
best professor you've ever had. Recall
the most interesting class you've ever
taken. Now pretend that your favorite
professor is giving that interesting
class at 8 a.m. Monday through Friday
all year round with a two-week break
in late August; the real world is much
worse than that. Hold on now, slow
down, don't go running for the grad
uate school applications before you
hear the entire story.
You'll be surprised to learn that
besides the superb academic training
you've received at Stanford, you're
actually much better prepared for the
real world than the average recent
graduate. For instance, the registra
tion procedure at Stanford has more
than prepared you for the mysteries
of the IRS's 1040 Long Form and

LOTS is actually quite compatible
with the average Bolivian computer
facility. With only a few tips from an
old hand, such as myself, I'm sure
that you will more than just survive
in the real world; you will triumph.
A few words about the office. Now
the average professor doesn't care
what you look like. So if you happened
to spend the night on the floor because
the bed looked like it was too damn
high, and you wake up at quarter to
10 and run to class in your, by now,
crusty party togs (Bermuda shorts and
a UC-Berkeley sweatshirt), that's
swell. This will not fly at the office.
Some corporation is going to be paying
you big, by their standards, bucks and
they're going to expect corporate
image. That means suit and tie,
polished shoes, fresh shave (if appro
priate), American flag lapel pin and
that hard "Buster, I mean Business"
look in your eye.
Beta amphetamines help, but
they're no substitutes for being
related to the chairman of the board.
So if you're going to be at work by
8 a.m., the last 9-to-5 job having been
eliminated in 1973, figure on getting
up at 6, for 256 mornings a year.
The first thing that goes is break
fast. Let's be serious: Would you
rather spend 30 minutes messing up
dishes that will eventually have to be
thrown out, or sleeping? Sleep, re
gardless of what ungodly hour you set
the alarm clock, wins every time.
This is not to say that you'll ever
go hungry, heavens no. After only a
few months you'll have the office cof
fee cart's schedule down to the mil
lisecond. Not only will the deep-fat
fried sugar toroids that you soon be

come addicted to satisfy your hunger
(for about 30 minutes anyway), they
will provide you with an excuse to not
be doing your job. After about a week
any excuse is a good excuse.
The second thing to is shaving.
You will eryoy having a nice neat beard
to strain your meals through, and
more important you'll save five
minutes every morning. You may have
good intentions, but eventually you'll
tire of having people snicker at the
bloody toilet paper (ever shaved before
daybreak?) gruesomely plastered all
over your face.
The third thing that goes is your
suburban apartment, the one with the
grass and the trees and the parking
space right outside your door. After
a month in which you've seen the
dawn around 20 times, you'll do any
thing to avoid commuting. That in
cludes living in a studio apartment
downtown in a building you will share
with six students with whom you'll
have nothing in common; a retired
couple who evidently despise you; a
wino who sleeps in the back hall; a
nurse or three who work the night
shift; and 22,000 cockroaches. Hey,
who knows, you may enjoy yup
piehood.
The last thing that'll have to be
jettisoned is your social life. Nobody
else at the office will have one, and
it'll just piss them off if you manage
to keep yours. You might as well say
good-bye to David Letterman while
you're at it.

Civil Engineering Department. He's
planning to stay around for a while.

local parlance, is like.
I'm glad you asked. Imagine the
best professor you've ever had. Recall
the most interesting class you've ever
taken. Now pretend that your favorite
professor is giving that interesting
class at 8 a.m. Monday through Friday
all year round with a two-week break
in late August; the real world is much
worse than that. Hold on now, slow
down, don't go running for the grad
uate school applications before you
hear the entire story.
You'll be surprised to learn that
besides the superb academic training
you've received at Stanford, you're
actually much better prepared for the
real world than the average recent
graduate. For instance, the registra
tion procedure at Stanford has more
than prepared you for the mysteries
of the IRS's 1040 Long Form and

LOTS is actually quite compatible
with the average Bolivian computer
facility. With only a few tips from an
old hand, such as myself, I'm sure
that you will more than just survive
in the real world; you will triumph.
A few words about the office. Now
the average professor doesn't care
what you look like. So if you happened
to spend the night on the floor because
the bed looked like it was too damn
high, and you wake up at quarter to
10 and run to class in your, by now,
crusty party togs (Bermuda shorts and
a UC-Berkeley sweatshirt), that's
swell. This will not fly at the office.
Some corporation is going to be paying
you big, by their standards, bucks and
they're going to expect corporate
image. That means suit and tie,
polished shoes, fresh shave (if appro
priate), American flag lapel pin and
that hard "Buster, I mean Business"
look in your eye.
Beta amphetamines help, but
they're no substitutes for being
related to the chairman of the board.
So if you're going to be at work by
8 a.m., the last 9-to-5 job having been
eliminated in 1973, figure on getting
up at 6, for 256 mornings a year.
The first thing that goes is break
fast. Let's be serious: Would you
rather spend 30 minutes messing up
dishes that will eventually have to be
thrown out, or sleeping? Sleep, re
gardless of what ungodly hour you set
the alarm clock, wins every time.
This is not to say that you'll ever
go hungry, heavens no. After only a
few months you'll have the office cof
fee cart's schedule down to the mil
lisecond. Not only will the deep-fat
fried sugar toroids that you soon be

come addicted to satisfy your hunger
(for about 30 minutes anyway), they
will provide you with an excuse to not
be doing your job. After about a week
any excuse is a good excuse.
The second thing to is shaving.
You will eryoy having a nice neat beard
to strain your meals through, and
more important you'll save five
minutes every morning. You may have
good intentions, but eventually you'll
tire of having people snicker at the
bloody toilet paper (ever shaved before
daybreak?) gruesomely plastered all
over your face.
The third thing that goes is your
suburban apartment, the one with the
grass and the trees and the parking
space right outside your door. After
a month in which you've seen the
dawn around 20 times, you'll do any
thing to avoid commuting. That in
cludes living in a studio apartment
downtown in a building you will share
with six students with whom you'll
have nothing in common; a retired
couple who evidently despise you; a
wino who sleeps in the back hall; a
nurse or three who work the night
shift; and 22,000 cockroaches. Hey,
who knows, you may enjoy yup
piehood.
The last thing that'll have to be
jettisoned is your social life. Nobody
else at the office will have one, and
it'll just piss them off if you manage
to keep yours. You might as well say
good-bye to David Letterman while
you're at it.

and ran — out into the Real World.
Ah, but life was simpler in college so
he found out. And a return to
academia suits him just fine.
MANY OF US, no doubt, are
curious as to what the "Real
World" is like. I'm often
asked, "What's it like?" or, "Is it true
that nothing you learn here is rele
vant?" or more to the point, "Why
are you back?" Most students seem
to picture the real world in terms of
one-third contingency fees or record
number of gall bladders operated upon
or other such mixed-up notions. It's
evident that most Stanford students,
especially the grad students, haven't
the vaguest idea of what life on the
outside, off the Farm in the quaint
local parlance, is like.
