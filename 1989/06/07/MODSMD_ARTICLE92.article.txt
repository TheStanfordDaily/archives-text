# Revelry and irreverence meet at Commencement
## 
### Robert Landon 
Harvard University may be the Stan
ford of the East, but no matter how hard
the staid, Ivy League school tries, it will
never be able to throw a graduation,
California-style.
If parents are expecting Sunday's Com
mencement ceremonies at Stanford Sta
dium to be a somber affair, let them be
warned. That is not to say that Com
mencement can't be a time for serious
reflection, but it won't be without plenty
of revelry to compensate — perhaps too
much revelry, according to some.
Making perennial appearances at grad
uation are picnics, frisbees, tie-dye and
champagne bottles. Many champagne
bottles. Enough, in fact, to prompt Bob
Hamrdla, the president's assistant, to
warn that flying corks can pose a fairly
serious threat to targets (woops, I mean
speakers) at the podium.
1988 graduate Mark Wolfe recalled that
the atmosphere at his graduation was
"not exactly irreverant, but definitely
loose, mellow and fun."
"All the students were supposed to
process into the stadium in two lines.
But what really happened was that people
pulled out frisbees and hacky-sacks and
basically just ran all over the place, dis
playing general merriment," Wolfe said.
Wolfe, who debuted in the business
world as a technical writer at Tandem
Corp., added that 1988's Commencement
wasn't exactly a sober affair either.

"People were really drunk. They got
up in the middle of the ceremony and
ran to the bathrooms that are outside
the stadium," Wolfe said.
The one thing every student at Stan
ford has in common is that they will all
wear cap and gown at graduation. But
what they wear — or don't wear — un
derneath those gowns reveals exactly how
unique Stanford is. According to Wolfe,
students wore everything from tie-dye
shirts and Dollie uniforms to nothing at
all.
Partying and clothing are not the only
things on graduates' minds, however. Po
litically active students recognize gradu
ation as a time to reach a large and
influential audience. For example, the

Students of Color Coalition last year
carried black balloons to signify their
commitment to multicultural education
and investment responsibility.
Director of University Events and Serv
ices Lois Wagner, whose office puts on
Commencement, says she likes the festive
and diverse atmosphere of graduation,
but that it can go too far.
"It's sad to see the kind of alcoholic
intake that goes on. It means that stu
dents can't even remember what com
mencement was like. A handful make it
embarrassing for the others," Wagner
said.
"One year students tried to bring in a
keg in a grocery cart," she noted.
However, Wagner said she thought that

graduates have become more responsible
about alcohol.
"And it might make a difference that
this is the first Dean Jean class," Wagner
added. Dean of Admissions Jean Fetter
replaced outgoing Dean Fred Hargadon
in 1985, the year most of this year's
graduating students were admitted to
Stanford.
But apparently Wagner doesn't think
things will change too drastically. Events
and Services will still be providing boxes
for empty champagne bottles and plenty
of water to prevent dehydration. And they
will encourage graduates to make a pit
stop at the spot-o-pots before they head
into the stadium.
Wolfe agreed with Wagner that his par

ents would have preferred something
more solemn. "But it was Stanford, and
they kind of expected something ir
reverant."
After the stadium carnival, the indi
vidual departmental ceremonies seem
conventional and staid.
Yet even Stanford's general commence
ment is tame compared to some other
West Coast schools. Lauren Wilson, who
graduated in May from Reed College in
Portland, Ore., said several students went
through the entire ceremony in the nude,
and "there didn't seem to be much fuss
about it," she said.
In accordance with an old school tra
dition, Reed's outgoing seniors hand a
present to the college president at grad
uation. One person handed him a ham
mer and sickle, according to Wilson.
On the other hand, Stanford is a far
cry from its more staid counterparts in
the East.
Even Wesleyan University, which has
the reputation for having one of the more
radical campuses in the country, had an
orderly graduation, according to this
year's graduate Amy Meltzer.
"People filed in, stayed in line, and
everyone wore beautiful red robes,"
Meltzer said. "Except one guy, who wore
a lam 6 gown and high heels."
Though Stanford lacks the time
honored seriousness of East Coast
graduations, few participants complain.
The sunshine, the champagne and the
celebrations more than compensate.

dition, Reed's outgoing seniors hand a
present to the college president at grad
uation. One person handed him a ham
mer and sickle, according to Wilson.
On the other hand, Stanford is a far
cry from its more staid counterparts in
the East.
Even Wesleyan University, which has
the reputation for having one of the more
radical campuses in the country, had an
orderly graduation, according to this
year's graduate Amy Meltzer.
"People filed in, stayed in line, and
everyone wore beautiful red robes,"
Meltzer said. "Except one guy, who wore
a lam 6 gown and high heels."
Though Stanford lacks the time
honored seriousness of East Coast
graduations, few participants complain.
The sunshine, the champagne and the
celebrations more than compensate.

Harvard University may be the Stan
ford of the East, but no matter how hard
the staid, Ivy League school tries, it will
never be able to throw a graduation,
California-style.
If parents are expecting Sunday's Com
mencement ceremonies at Stanford Sta
dium to be a somber affair, let them be
warned. That is not to say that Com
mencement can't be a time for serious
reflection, but it won't be without plenty
of revelry to compensate — perhaps too
much revelry, according to some.
Making perennial appearances at grad
uation are picnics, frisbees, tie-dye and
champagne bottles. Many champagne
bottles. Enough, in fact, to prompt Bob
Hamrdla, the president's assistant, to
warn that flying corks can pose a fairly
serious threat to targets (woops, I mean
speakers) at the podium.
1988 graduate Mark Wolfe recalled that
the atmosphere at his graduation was
"not exactly irreverant, but definitely
loose, mellow and fun."
"All the students were supposed to
process into the stadium in two lines.
But what really happened was that people
pulled out frisbees and hacky-sacks and
basically just ran all over the place, dis
playing general merriment," Wolfe said.
Wolfe, who debuted in the business
world as a technical writer at Tandem
Corp., added that 1988's Commencement
wasn't exactly a sober affair either.

"People were really drunk. They got
up in the middle of the ceremony and
ran to the bathrooms that are outside
the stadium," Wolfe said.
The one thing every student at Stan
ford has in common is that they will all
wear cap and gown at graduation. But
what they wear — or don't wear — un
derneath those gowns reveals exactly how
unique Stanford is. According to Wolfe,
students wore everything from tie-dye
shirts and Dollie uniforms to nothing at
all.
Partying and clothing are not the only
things on graduates' minds, however. Po
litically active students recognize gradu
ation as a time to reach a large and
influential audience. For example, the

Students of Color Coalition last year
carried black balloons to signify their
commitment to multicultural education
and investment responsibility.
Director of University Events and Serv
ices Lois Wagner, whose office puts on
Commencement, says she likes the festive
and diverse atmosphere of graduation,
but that it can go too far.
"It's sad to see the kind of alcoholic
intake that goes on. It means that stu
dents can't even remember what com
mencement was like. A handful make it
embarrassing for the others," Wagner
said.
"One year students tried to bring in a
keg in a grocery cart," she noted.
However, Wagner said she thought that

graduates have become more responsible
about alcohol.
"And it might make a difference that
this is the first Dean Jean class," Wagner
added. Dean of Admissions Jean Fetter
replaced outgoing Dean Fred Hargadon
in 1985, the year most of this year's
graduating students were admitted to
Stanford.
But apparently Wagner doesn't think
things will change too drastically. Events
and Services will still be providing boxes
for empty champagne bottles and plenty
of water to prevent dehydration. And they
will encourage graduates to make a pit
stop at the spot-o-pots before they head
into the stadium.
Wolfe agreed with Wagner that his par

ents would have preferred something
more solemn. "But it was Stanford, and
they kind of expected something ir
reverant."
After the stadium carnival, the indi
vidual departmental ceremonies seem
conventional and staid.
Yet even Stanford's general commence
ment is tame compared to some other
West Coast schools. Lauren Wilson, who
graduated in May from Reed College in
Portland, Ore., said several students went
through the entire ceremony in the nude,
and "there didn't seem to be much fuss
about it," she said.
In accordance with an old school tra
dition, Reed's outgoing seniors hand a
