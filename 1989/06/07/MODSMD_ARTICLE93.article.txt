# Fleet Street updates traditional Hymn
## 
### Alex Camacho 
Every Stanford student knows
the melody, but few remember the
words. It's been sung in four-part
harmony and in rap. The Stanford
Band plays it at every football
game. No, it's not "All Right
Now," it's "Hail, Stanford, Hail!"
Start practicing your "Do Re
Mis" because you're sure to be
joining in and singing along with

this 96-year-old hymn many a
time during the Commencement
festivities.
According to the Book of Stan
ford Songs, "Hail, Stanford,
Hail!" was written in 1893. And
it has gone through quite a few
revisions since then. The Band's
version was charted by Dr. Arthur
P. Barnes. Recently Timothy (T.
Bag) Biglow and K. Kashima re
wrote the harmony for the Fleet

Street Singers and Stanford
Choir's version which is sung
every Founder's Day. The newest
edition is Fleet Street's Stanford
Hymn Rap.
Fleet Street is Stanford's oldest
all-male, a cappella student sing
ing group. According to Martin
Puryear, a current member, the
singers first performed the rap
two years ago in their annual
Spring Show. The brainchild of

Larry Banner, class of '87, the
Stanford Hymn Rap has little of
the solemn, somewhat dirge-like
overtones of the original melody.
Incidentally, Banner came up
with the idea while singing in the
shower, or so the Fleet Street
grapevine has it.
Whether in its reverent form or
rap beat, "Hail, Stanford Hail!"
gives voice to the pride of being
a Stanford student. It immor
talizes sunsets and foothills, both
of which you can't escape ap
preciating at one time or another
during your stay on the Farm.
We're welcomed as freshmen at
Orientation and taught the Hymn.
Now at Commencement, we can
say farewell to this chapter of our
lives with a hearty rendition of
"Hail, Stanford, Hail!"

Where the rolling foothills rise
Up towards mountains higher,
Where at eve the coast range
lies
In the sunset fire.
Flushing deep and paling,
Here we raise our voices,
hailing
Thee, our Alma Mater.
From the foothills to the bay
It shall ring,
As we sing,
It shall ring and float away.
(Boom, Boom)
Hail, Stanford, Hail!
Hail, Stanford, Hail!

The Fleet Street singers bring their antics to Commencement this year, where they will perform a
rap version of the Stanford alma mater.
