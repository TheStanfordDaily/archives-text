# Caps, gowns discarded in graduation protest
## 
### Andrew Berkowitz 
Take a look around this Sun
day at the academic tradition
wrapped up in the caps and
gowns worn by the graduating
students. Now imagine a grad
uating class without this garb.
The "No Cap and Gown"
movement which changed the
look of Stanford's Commence
ment ceremonies in 1970 seems
very distant from today.
While this year's graduates
ponder over whether to sign
the "Senior Pledge of Environ
mental and Social Responsibil
ity," graduates puzzled over
more serious political concerns
in 1970 â€” the year America's
campuses truned into a bat
tleground.
It was that year that more
than 300 Stanford students
passed up graduating in the
traditional cap and gown as a
protest of the United States'
presence in Southeast Asia.
To Stanford students today,
it seems that 1970 could hardly
have happened. In May of that
year, the University was virtu
ally shut down for two weeks
as club-wielding, rock-throwing
students protested the presence
of the Air Force ROTC at Stan
ford at a time when President
Richard Nixon was sending
troops to Cambodia. Protesters
battled police and shattered

windows across campus.
Other campuses were hit
even harder. Four protesting
students were killed at Kent
State; California Governor
Ronald Reagan ordered the en
tire University of California
system closed for four days so
students could reflect on the
violence of the past weeks in
the UC system. Some schools,
such as Boston University, sim
ply canceled the final weeks of
school, sending students away
from campus and even cancel
ing graduation.
Even as the rioting at Stan
ford gave way to a more peace
ful strike, classes were canceled
or virtually empty as students
concerned with the war contin
ued to protest the presence of
ROTC on campus. It was not
until University President Ken
neth Pitzer announced that the
ROTC programs would be
moved off campus in 1971 that
classes were fully able to
resume.
Still, Stanford students re
mained intensely political, and
as a part of that activism the
"No Cap and Gown" movement
was started by the senior class.
Seniors had the opportunity to
commit the rental fee for their
graduation vestments to a fund
which would be used to support
candidates committed to peace
in the upcoming elections.
