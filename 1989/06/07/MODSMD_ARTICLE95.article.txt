## Meinert's farewell: stylish as usual 
### Jon "Shifty" Weisman 
The class of '89
was full of surprises

Check out Scott Meinert on
Graduation Day. He'll be looking
sharp, in his fresh cap and gown,
marching in line with his fellow
graduates in the procession into
Stanford Stadium.
Meinert, the third guard on the
1988-89 Stanford men's basket
ball team (the first to reach the
NCAA tournament since 1942)
has had a lot of practice perform
ing in front of large crowds. Long
has he known how to make an
impression.
But the Meinert you'll see glint
ing in the effulgent Commence
ment sun doesn't sum up his en
tire persona, any more than this
day of celebration fully captures
one's years at Stanford.

For example, though he might
not actually be wearing it, some
where underneath Meinert's grad
uation gown are the shredded
remnants of his basketball prac
tice uniform.
"Scott was notorious for tearing
up his practice gear," Stanford
Asst. Coach Doug Oliver says.
"Within a week he'd cut it to fit
his body. He had more holes in
his practice gear than anyone I've
ever seen in 15 years of coaching."
Explanation, Scott?
"I'm hard on clothes," Meinert
responds.
Care to elaborate?
"I don't like sleeves on gray
T-shirts," Meinert says. "You
can't wear one under your prac
tice jersey and not sweat in it. So
I cut the sleeves off."

I don't know, Scott, that sounds
pretty flimsy. There must be
something else, some other rea
son ...
"I'm not comfortable shooting
a basketball with sleeves,"
Meinert continues. That's bet
ter; that's better. But come on,
what's the real reason?
"When Eric Reveno grabs your
T-shirts and swings you around
in them, they get to look a little
raggedy."
There we go. Reveno, the start
ing center for the Stanford men's
basketball team in 1988-89, is 6-
foot-8 and weighs 250 pounds.
Meinert, the No. 3 guard, is 6-2,
170. Enough said.
The point is, with some people,
you know who they are and what
they're about the moment you
first encounter them. But you
couldn't get to know the entire
Scott Meinert from your seat in
the Maples Pavilion bleachers,
and you can't do it from your seat
in the Commencement crowd
either. You have to get past the
whimsical and the irrational in
order to arrive at the heart of his
character. After that, he may still
seem whimsical, but he actually
boasts a lot of common sense.
You have to take apart his uni
form before you sew it back to
gether.
Now is as good as anytime to
do that, as Meinert departs Stan
ford with a degree in political sci
ence and five years experience on
the Cardinal.
Tangibly, Meinert set a school
record this past season with a
three-point field goal percentage
of .583 (21-for-36). Overall, the
fifth-year senior from Salem, Ore.
played in 112 games for the Car
dinal, only 12 less than Todd
Lichti, the all-time record-holder.
Meinert averaged four points per
game during his career.
Unfortunately for Meinert, who
played both the shooting and point
guard positions, he ended up in
the same class as perhaps the
greatest backcourt in Stanford
history, after redshirting in 1985-
86 due to an ankle injury. Lichti's
18 school records, including 2,336
points, speak for themselves,
while Terry Taylor is second all
time in school history in assists,
third in free-throw percentage and
first in Pacific 10 Conference his
tory in three-point field goals.
"Terry did some things a little
bit better," Oliver says, "but given
the opportunity, Scott proved he
could do the job."
That opportunity came in
March of 1988, when Taylor was
severely stricken with the flu just
before Stanford's opening-round
NIT tournament game against
Long Beach State, the Cardinal's
first postseason game since win
ning the 1942 NCAA champion
ship. Meinert was pressed into his
first start of the season.
Playing 27 pressure-packed
minutes, Meinert had nine points
and six assists, and sank two free
throws with nine seconds left to
clinch an 80-77 victory.
"That was a lot of fun," Meinert
says. "We won the darn game. I
always like to point that out, that
we won a game with me starting
at point. Making those two free
throws was great, where we could
have lost. Todd Lichti got to do
it all the time ... it was nice to
have my shot at it."
After tiittt game, important spot
contributions by Meinert stopped
being newsworthy. Several times

this year, Meinert was in the right
place in the right time, even if he
were overshadowed by Taylor and
Lichti.
"I think I became a pretty damn
good basketball player in five
years," Meinert says."I was a Pac
-10 starting point guard. I was un
fortunate that there were two
other starting guards here. (But)
I know there were other programs
that would have liked to have had
a veteran point guard."
Still, if it were all that simple,
you wouldn't need to look past
the resplendent cap and gown to
uncover the real Meinert. For
Meinert could also be erratic. On
the court, he made as many turn
overs as assists, and off the court,
he developed a reputation for
being too flip or too detatched at
times.
"If I see something funny, I'm
going to say it," Meinert says."I
don't try to come across as cocky.
I'm having fun — having a lot of
fun. Sometimes things maybe
come out wrong, or get inter
preted differently.
"Then again, I also think I've
grown up quite a bit in the last
five years," Meinert adds.
Oliver contends that Meinert
gets a bum rap.
"Contrary to what most people
believe, Scott does have more
compassion than he lets on,"
Oliver says."He was an individ
ual, but when it was time to put
things in a team perspective, he
did.
"I think Scott is a fairly carefree
person when he's involved with
social activities, and traveling
with the team is still a social at
mosphere," Oliver adds. "But
when it was time to play, Scott
was as prepared if not more
prepared than the rest of the
team."
The only thing that Meinert
wasn't really prepared for was let
ting go of basketball. The oldest
player on the Cardinal during the
1988-89 season, Meinert's retire
ment came suddenly with the
team's 80-78 upset loss to Siena
in the first round of the NCAA
tournament in March.
"It hurts, because I wasn't
ready to lose, to quit," Meinert
says.
Meinert still went down to prac
tice from time to time this spring,
but found it very frustrating.
"I couldn't relax and have fun
with it recreationally," he says.
"I'd ask Rev, 'Why am I so pissed
off about this?' He'd say, 'Because
you hate losing. You're not used
to it, and I'm not either goddamn
it.' "
And that, friends, is the heart
of Scott Meinert, the yearning to
succeed. He may not have the bur
ning desire to hit Wall Street run
ning and bag a million dollars a
year, but he does have a burning
desire to be a winner.
Thus, you shouldn't be sur
prised that Meinert's advice to his
cohorts in the Class of '89 is,
"Don't ever be afraid of doing any
thing, and if you do it as well and
as hard as you can, you'll be OK."
Why are we featuring Scott
Meinert at Commencement time,
when more prominent athletes
could have been profiled? Because
this Class of '89 is brimming with
people like Meinert. People whose
practice gear may be a bit dis
heveled, whose personalities may
be a bit eccentric, but whose caps
and gowns proudly signify their
winning hearts.

Scott Meinert filled the role of third guard admirably on the men's
basketball team this past season. The fifth-year senior helped the
Cardinal earned its first NCAA berth since 1942.
