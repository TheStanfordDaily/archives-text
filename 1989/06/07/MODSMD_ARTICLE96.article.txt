# Asforis vs. adversity
## Basketball star's return from injury coincides with team's rise to glory 
### Evan "Elvis" Tuchinsky 
Injury is every athlete's night
mare. Aside from the pain and
hassles of rehabilitation, ailments
cost players valuable training
time and lessen the competitive
edge athletes work so hard to
develop.
Few know this better than Evon
Asforis, one of the post power
houses of the Stanford women's
basketball team. Downed two
years ago with a knee injury
serious enough to remove her
from the starting lineup, Asforis
persevered to become the Cardi
nal's most aggressive and prolific
rebounder during her senior
season.
As tri-captain, she helped guide
Stanford to its most successful
season ever. The Cardinal
finished the season with a 28-3
record and the No. 4 ranking on
the Associated Press poll, reach
ing the Midwest Regional final
before falling to host Louisiana
Tech.
Asforis never returned to the
starter status she enjoyed before
the iryury, but she has logged
enough quality time to earn op
ponents' respect. She was the first
forward off the bench throughout
the season, and her tenacious play
kept her on the court for an
average of 18.7 minutes per game.
"I think Evon [playedl really
well," Stanford Coach Tara Van-
Derveer said. "She [worked] really
hard and [came] off the knee in
jury. It's a great comeback story."
The Evon Asforis Story began
in the second game of her soph
omore year. After a 17-point per
formance in the Cardinal's
season-opening win against
Cleveland, Asforis injured her
knee in the following contest.

UNLV was the last opponent she
faced that year.
"She came down on it at a weird
angle, and it just went out," Van-
Derveer recalled.
The mishap launched her down
a long road to recovery. Surgery
and physical rehabilitation healed
the damage, but it took Asforis'
determination to play again for
her to return to her present form.
It also took tolerance. Even
after she was healthy enough to
compete, doctors required her to
wear a cumbersome knee brace.
Finally, with her knee as strong
as ever, Asforis shed the brace
and the last remnants of her in
jury.
"Last year, I thought she was
slowed down by her brace a bit,"
VanDerveer said. "[This yearl she
[playedl with a lot more confi
dence. She [was] one of our best
rebounders, [was] real aggressive
and [made] things happen."
The change from injured to in
spired did not occur overnight.
Her forced absence from compe
tition took its toll on her game,
sapping some of her speed and
strength as well as some of the
moves she developed during her
freshman season and her years at
August Martin High School in
Queens Village, New York.
Asfori3 fought back to star
status, spending hours in the gym
day after day improving her skills
and rekindling her athletic spark.
While returning to the level she
attained sophomore year, the
senior transcended her former
level of play and became a feared
force. Now longer hindered, she
played with an enviable intensity
all season long and put the power
back in her power forward posi
tion.
