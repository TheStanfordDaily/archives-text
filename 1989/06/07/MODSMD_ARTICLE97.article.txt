# A 						Ballard for Baltimore
## Former Cardinal ace has O's fans singing 'Take Me Out to the Ballgame' again 
### 
Editor'B note: Jeff Ballard was
one of the greatest pitchers in Car
dinal baseball history. Today, he
is tossing the horsehide for the
first-place Baltimore Orioles. As
this year's graduates head into
the real world, we wish them suc
cess similar to that which Ballard
is currently enjoying.

If he keeps pitching like he has
the first half of this season, Jeff
Ballard could join the ranks of
the few Stanford athletes who
have enjoyed more success after
college than on the Farm.
That isn't to say he had an
average career for the Cardinal.
In four years at Stanford, Ballard
racked up a school-record 37 wins
and 428 innings pitched to become
the Cardinal's most prolific hur
ler.
By 1985, Ballard's senior year,
he had become the ace of a staff
that had gone to the College World
Series in two of the past three
years. The same year, Stanford
had to get past Pepperdine, who
had beaten the Cardinal in a pre
vious regional game, to advance
to the World Series for the third
time. Ballard got the call.
He responded with the best per
formance of his career, a three

hit, one run masterpiece that al
lowed Stanford to advance, 7-1.
Working with little support un
til the sixth, when the Cardinal
finally broke a 1-1 tie, Ballard
retired the last 20 batters he
faced, striking out seven and
walking none.
Stanford Coach Mark Marquess
was asked after the game whether
he had ever seen a better per
formance from his senior ace. He
replied, "No, that was an unbe
lievable effort."
But now that he has become
the ace of the Baltimore Orioles
staff, Ballard had no time to rest
on his Stanford laurels. As of Sun
day, he was leading the Orioles
with a 9-2 record and a 2.50 ERA
and seems headed for this year's
All-Star game.
For someone just four years out
of Stanford who spent just under
two years in the minor leagues,
that is a remarkable achievement.
"I'm as surprised as anyone about
how well I'm doing. You don't
really set those kind of expecta
tions," Ballard said.
Since leaving the Farm, Ballard
has added pitches to his repertoire
and increased his command of
them, spotting the corners well.
He said that he could get away
with two or three pitches in col
lege, but not in the majors.

And he seems to have caught
on to the latest trend for major
league pitchers — the changeup
that Frank Viola has used so well.
"I didn't throw many changeups
while I was there (at Stanford),
but I've gotten command of it
now," Ballard said.
Ballard has also experienced his
share of hard times in the msyor
leagues. Last year he won only
eight games, but was the Orioles'
victory leader on a team that set
a new league record for
losses at the beginning of the
season with 21.
A recent story in Sports Il
lustrated has Ballard the victim
of baseball's newest legend,
Kansas City's Bo Jackson. Al
legedly, Jackson had called
timeout when Ballard was still in
his windup but the umpire did
not allow it. Jackson stepped back
into the batter's box while the
pitch was on the way and hit it
out of the park for a home run.
But Ballard does not fear Jack
son as much as other major
leaguers. "Bo only hits in the
.2705. He can hit it a long way,
but he can also be pitched to."
Looking back on his days at
Sunken Diamond, Ballard remem
bers how well Marquess and pitch
ing coach Tom Dunton prepared

him for professional baseball.
What distinguishes the Stan
ford program from that at other
universities is its hustle. Players
always sprint off the field and no
one ever sits in the dugout when
the Cardinal is at bat. They stand
outside and yell for their team
mates, often riling the other team.
"One thing that you take with
you is the work ethic," Ballard
said.
"(The leagues] are a little
different because we play every
day and everyone has a job to do.
But they do hustle and they do
play ball," Ballard said.
Although his Stanford teams
were much like the Brooklyn
Dodgers of yore, reaching the
World Series and never winning,
the Cardinal did reach the
promised land two years later,
winning the national champion
ship in both 1987 and 1988.
And for Ballard, the ultimate
success could be just around the
corner as well. He is one of the
American League's best pitchers
and his team is currently enjoying
a comfortable lead in the league's
East division after finishing in the
cellar last year.
"The turnaround in the club
house is amazing, it's 180 degrees.
Guys love coming to the ballpark

now," Ballard said.
In the recent film "Field of
Dreams," Shoeless Joe Jackson's
character speaks perhaps for all
baseball players when he talks
about his love for the little things
in baseball: the smell of a glove,
the feeling of running across the
grassy outfield and the roar of
the crowd. Ballard feels the same.
"That's why I love the game. I

just want to play as long as I can
and be the best I can and then
stay with it by going into coaching
of some sort."
Baseball is a fickle mistress.
Sometimes it returns a player's
love and sometimes it doesn't.
Currently at the top of his game,
Jeff Ballard does not have to
worry about an unrequited love
affair with his favorite pastime.

Jeff Ballard, one of the finest pitchers in Stanford history, is a
major reason for the Baltimore Orioles' turnaround from 0-21 to
first place.
