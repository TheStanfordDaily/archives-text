# Two righties fought to keep Stanford from being left out
## 
### 
Given up for dead midway through the season, the Stanford baseball team made a
serious, year-end run at postseason play.
Outstanding pitching was the reason, and senior right-handers Brian Keyser and
Steve Chitren were the key performers.
In winning nine of their last 10 ballgames, Stanford pitchers allowed just 28 runs on 76
hits in 90 innings. Cardinal hurlers sported a 2.50 ERA, walking just 26 while fanning 76, a
phenomenal ratio. The starters amassed five complete games in the 10-game span.
The second half of the season saw Keyser excel as Stanford's number two starter, and
Chitren, after two-and-a-half years as the Cardinal's stopper, successfully assumed a spot in
the starting rotation.

Brian Keyser had big shoes to fill when ace Mike Mussina went out with a shoulder injury. The
senior filled them Impressively and was the team's most reliable starter late in the season.
