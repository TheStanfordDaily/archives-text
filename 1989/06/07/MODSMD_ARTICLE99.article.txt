Brian Keyser led Stanford this
season with seven victories
against just three losses. In his
final outing as a Cardinal, Keyser
shut out Pepperdine 1-0, allowing
just three hits. The first shotout
of Keyser's career gave him three
consecutive victories to end the
season. In those three games, He
pitched 22 innings and did not
allow an earned run. Over his
last six games, Keyser went 4-0
with a 2.14 ERA, fanning 35 in
42 innings of work.
Keyser's season, however, did
not start out the way he and
Coach Mark Marquess had
planned. Getting a full page in
the Stanford baseball media guide
means that the coaching staff is

expecting big things from you. Of
course the big names get a full
page: Frank Carey, Paul Carey,
Troy Paulsen etc. But this year
Keyser was a full-page surprise.
He had toiled in relative
obscurity for much of his Stanford
career, pitching solidly behind
Stanford legends Jack McDowell
and Lee Plemel. Last year Keyser
suffered a sore elbow early in the
season, then pitched in 17 games,
two as a starter, amassing a 3-0
record and 6.27 ERA.
With Plemel graduated last
year, there was gap in Stanford's
starting rotation. Sophomores
Stan Spencer and Mike Mussina
would be the number one and two
men, but a third starter was
needed.
Keyser emerged in fall practice
as that third starter, and thus

merited a full page in the media
guide. But Keyser fizzled in the
early season, struggling with his
control and giving up a lot of runs.
"One of the easiest things for
him to do would be to give up,
but he never gave up," Stanford
reliever Scott Weiss said.
When Mussina went down to
injury after just one start in the
Pacific 10 Conference Southern
Division, a recovery by Keyser be
came critical.
He continued to work hard and
began his return to form at USC,
when Keyser fanned eight Trojans
in BV3 innings of relief to get the
win. From that point on, Keyser
was almost unhittable as the Car
dinal's number two starter behind
Spencer.
