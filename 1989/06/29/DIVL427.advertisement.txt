CHINA'S GODDESS OF FREEDOM
—Dedicated to the Young Students from Stanford Chinese
students. Written by Cai Ming Jai
Like raging flames
Like surging torrent
Young students hundred thousand strong
Have gathered in Beijing, on Tiananmen Square
With headbands written in blood
With earth-shaking roar
You challenge dictatorship
You fight for freedom, for democracy
Down with the new emperors
Down with the new despots
Overthrow the shackles of dictatorship,
Let China rise to her promised glory
Fear not threat
Fear not strongmen
For common justice, you demand
"Give us freedom, or give us death"
You are the sons of the Yellow River
You are the soul of our nation
You have written a new page in history
You are China's Goddess of Freedom.
MAMA, PLEASE DON'T CRY
Mama. Mama, please don't cry,
Your tears break our heart.
We are hunger striking in the Square,
Beacuse our country's future is dark.
Mama, Mama, please don't cry
Your tears make our hearts bleed
We are hunger striking in the Square
Because democracy is to us dearest
For the future of China,
For the rights of our people,
We shall have no regrets
Even if we give our lives.
Mama, Mama, please don't cry
Hold your tears,
Dear Mama,
Till the day of victory
Mama, Mama, Dear Mama,
Please don't cry.
