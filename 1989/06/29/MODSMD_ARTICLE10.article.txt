# Commencement!
## 
### Robert Landon Staff writer 
When graduating seniors strode into
the Stanford Stadium on June 18, they
must have felt more like Olympic athletes
than mere recipients of Stanford degrees.
A crowd of about 30,000 fans filled half
the stadium with bright colors and loud
cheers on a sunny day that was just this
side of scorching.
For the participants in graduation, the
event just kind of happens. But the
behind-the-scenes heroes of the day are
the managers and workers at University
Events and Service who take care of the
nuts and bolts of this tremendous celebra
tion.
Graduation itself lasts only a day, but
a plethora of activities surrounds the cer-

emony, from baccalaureate serv
ices to a reception at University
President Donald Kennedy's pad.
Stanford wants to make sure that
each senior has a chance to say
good-bye to every person they ever
met at Stanford — and to their
parents, too.
In response to the question
"Who makes graduation work?",
all hands point toward Bill
Cleveland. Cleveland, who has
been at Stanford for 36 years, said
modestly, "1 just make sure every
thing runs on schedule." And he
gives full credit for the success of
this year's graduation to a com
petent and hard-working staff.
But if Cleveland is modest, the
task of "making sure everything
runs on schedule" is not. For in
stance, workers set up and then
took down 27,300 chairs altoget
her.
Parents who only see Stanford
during freshman orientation and
graduation probably don't realize
that the campus is not regularly
rigged with rows of chairs and
podiums and sound systems.

The ceremony in the stadium
with Don Kennedy et al. is only
the beginning of graduation. There
are 57 ceremonies and parties over
the course of three days, ranging
from the mammoth strawberries
and the chance to shake Ken
nedy's hand at an informal recep
tion at his house, all the way to
the English department's decorous
ceremony in Memorial Church,
with the professors up on the altar,
frocked in Medieval-looking
gowns.
Stanford students play a big role
in making graduation a success,
as well. This year about 65 of
them worked on the graduation
work crews, their responsibilities
ranging from hoisting flags to set
ting up chairs, according to
Cleveland.
"We have some seniors who arc
graduating and working on the
work crew at the same time,"
Cleveland said. That means they
got up very early on Sunday morn
ing to help with last minute

details, donned their caps and
gowns, had their pictures taken
with their diplomas and then
stripped down to shorts again to
start folding chairs.
Some students worked 16 hours
on the Sunday of graduation, ac
cording to Cleveland. "We try to
make it fun because it is definitely
all work," he said.
Nor is graduation cheap. Mar
garita Ibarra, University Events
and Services' commencement co
ordinator, estimated conserva
tively that commencement cost
her department $50,000 this year,
and quite possibly more.
And that estimate does not
even begin to include the costs
incurred by the individual depart
ments' ceremonies. The English
Department alone spent $3,500
feeding their more than 100 grad
uates and 1,000 guests. Interna
tional relations spent over $4,000.

The free fcxxl and sun attracts
more than just proud mothers and
fathers. Every year Ibarra's office
gets requests for commencement
tickets from "civilians," members
of the general public who have
no direct connection to Stanford.
Alumna Sigourney Weaver
showed up, as well as 500 VIP
guests of Kennedy.
Also among those in attendance
this year was Boy Scout Troup 52
from Redwood City. Forty of the
scouts helped parents get water.
Certainly this counted as a Scout
good deed for the day, considering
temperatures rose well into the
90s in the stadium, with no clouds
to provide relief from the sun.
In keeping with tradition, Stan
ford's Commencement was quite
untraditional. Graduates filed, or
rather exploded, into the stadium
and broke up into groups tossing
frisbees, doing somersaults and dis
playing general merriment.
But Mark Wolfe, who has at
tended the last two commence

ments — "walking through" in
1988 and receiving his degree in
1989 — said this year's commence
ment was "a lot mellower than
last year's."
He speculated that the differ
ence may be a result of the change
in dean of admissions. This year's
class was the first to be accepted
by Jean Fetter, who replaced Fred
Hardigan in 1984-

Department alone spent $3,500

In keeping with tradition, Stan

untraditional. Graduates filed, or

playing general merriment.

When graduating seniors strode into
the Stanford Stadium on June 18, they
must have felt more like Olympic athletes
than mere recipients of Stanford degrees.
A crowd of about 30,000 fans filled half
the stadium with bright colors and loud
cheers on a sunny day that was just this
side of scorching.
For the participants in graduation, the
event just kind of happens. But the
behind-the-scenes heroes of the day are
the managers and workers at University
Events and Service who take care of the
nuts and bolts of this tremendous celebra
tion.
Graduation itself lasts only a day, but
a plethora of activities surrounds the cer-

emony, from baccalaureate serv
ices to a reception at University
President Donald Kennedy's pad.
Stanford wants to make sure that
each senior has a chance to say
good-bye to every person they ever
met at Stanford — and to their
parents, too.
In response to the question
"Who makes graduation work?",
all hands point toward Bill
Cleveland. Cleveland, who has
been at Stanford for 36 years, said
modestly, "1 just make sure every
thing runs on schedule." And he
gives full credit for the success of
this year's graduation to a com
petent and hard-working staff.
But if Cleveland is modest, the
task of "making sure everything
runs on schedule" is not. For in
stance, workers set up and then
took down 27,300 chairs altoget
her.
Parents who only see Stanford
during freshman orientation and
graduation probably don't realize
that the campus is not regularly
rigged with rows of chairs and
podiums and sound systems.

The ceremony in the stadium
with Don Kennedy et al. is only
the beginning of graduation. There
are 57 ceremonies and parties over
the course of three days, ranging
from the mammoth strawberries
and the chance to shake Ken
nedy's hand at an informal recep
tion at his house, all the way to
the English department's decorous
ceremony in Memorial Church,
with the professors up on the altar,
frocked in Medieval-looking
gowns.
Stanford students play a big role
in making graduation a success,
as well. This year about 65 of
them worked on the graduation
work crews, their responsibilities
ranging from hoisting flags to set
ting up chairs, according to
Cleveland.
"We have some seniors who arc
graduating and working on the
work crew at the same time,"
Cleveland said. That means they
got up very early on Sunday morn
ing to help with last minute

details, donned their caps and
gowns, had their pictures taken
with their diplomas and then
stripped down to shorts again to
start folding chairs.
Some students worked 16 hours
on the Sunday of graduation, ac
cording to Cleveland. "We try to
make it fun because it is definitely
all work," he said.
Nor is graduation cheap. Mar
garita Ibarra, University Events
and Services' commencement co
ordinator, estimated conserva
tively that commencement cost
her department $50,000 this year,
and quite possibly more.
And that estimate does not
even begin to include the costs
incurred by the individual depart
ments' ceremonies. The English
Department alone spent $3,500
feeding their more than 100 grad
uates and 1,000 guests. Interna
tional relations spent over $4,000.
