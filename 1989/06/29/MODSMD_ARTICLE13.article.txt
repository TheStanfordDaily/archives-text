# Editorial
## Editor's welcome 
### 
E.B. WHITE DEFINED an editor as "a person
who knows more about writing than writers
do, but who has escaped the terrible desire
to write." A writer, he said, "writes as long
as he lives. It is the same thing as breathing
except that it is bad for one's health."
I assume White would agree that women writers
are the same way. I am, anyway. And although I am
the editor this summer, I have yet to escape the desire
to write. I don't think I ever will.
Actually, that's lucky. I'll be writing plenty this
summer. And I'll be writing what I like best. I like
writing that takes pleasure in its words, enjoys the
moment a reader spends with it. This is different than
most newspaper writing, which takes pleasure in its
efficiency, and hurries the reader off to other amuse
ment.
That's most appropriate for the academic year's Daily.
It's unnecessary for the summer Weekly. We have six
more days to prepare, readers have six more days to
peruse and the words have six more days to bask in
California's warmest sun of the year. The words had
better be strong enough to hold up.
Incidently, this is a first. This is the first weekly
The Daily has ever published. I like to refer to it as
The Daily's yearly Weekly that appears summerly.
Makes it seem like playing with time is as easy as
playing with words.
And playing is something else The Weekly will
encourage. We're playing with new thoughts, a new
cover, a new creative writing section, new graphics,
new writers, new staff. The Weekly is in its youth,
so we're going to live it up rather than simply become
annual. Youth won't be wasted here.
This does not mean I intend to exchange quality
for flamboyance. We will bring you news and ideas
we think are worth thinking about, not always stories
that just broke. Our writers are going to research as
much as possible, get to know the subject matter
intimately â€” then write and rewrite.
Weekly publication affords the breathing space, to
use Whites metaphor, that is sucked up by daily
production. I hope by filling our lungs we can publish
a weekly in wnich you'll find material worthy of
filling some of your time and thoughts.
And in taking advantage of this pensive expanse
of summertime, I also want to cover the people and
perspectives of Stanford that regularly go uncelebrated
or unheard during the rest of the year. They deserve
coverage. They're usually busy acting and thinking
rather than talking about acting and thinking, and
so we miss hearing their important voices.
Perhaps by breathing deeply and working under
the title of summer editor, rather than writer, I'll
preserve my health better than White. Although as a
New Englander myself, I suspect East Coast weather
had more to do with his poor health than writing
did. Let's see. Here goes.
