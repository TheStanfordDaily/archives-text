Webb Ranch employees
should seek change
through union processes
I have received messages
of deep concern from the
Chicano Graduate Student
Association, the Stanford
Raza Medical Association
and, most recently, by way
of a petition, the employees
of Webb Ranch. Each calls on
me to divert University re
sources immediately in order
to enhance the wages and
living conditions of Webb's
employees.
Let me begin with the fun
damental point on which we
all agree — that Webb Ranch
workers, like all working
people, have the right to
expect fair compensation for
their labor.
It is commonly understood
that this responsibility rests
directly with the employer,
and Stanford University is
neither the employer nor the
joint employer of Webb
Ranch workers.
The Agricultural Labor Re
lations Board has already
confirmed that Webb Ranch
has that responsibility, and it
is with ranch management
that desired improvements
must be pursued. The Webb
Ranch employees themselves
have voted that improve
ments should be bargained
with their employer, Webb
Ranch.
From the start, the Univer
sity has been public in its
support of self-determination
by Webb Ranch employees.
Now that the employees
have made their own deci
sion to pursue collective bar
gaining, we all should hope
that both sides — the union
on behalf of the employees,
and the ranch on its own
behalf — will fulfill their
good faith obligations.
This is not to say that the
University has no obligations
as the ranch's lessor, and I
have acknowledged these
from the beginning. We sim
ply disagree on the extent of

the University's obligation as
other parties would choose
to define them. I readily ac
cept Stanford's responsibility
to require that Webb Ranch
operate in compliance with
the laws applicable to their
activities on our premises.
Since the health and safety
citations first came to light,
we have in fact acted
promptly to be sure that all
discrepancies of occupancy
are corrected. 1 am now as
sured that all are corrected,
with the exception of oc
cupancy limits — a matter to
be settled in negotiations
between the union and the
ranch.
The University's concern
for the Webb Ranch employ
ees is greater than may oe
realized. To the extent that 1
differ with those who have
written to me, my difference
is with the means and not
the end.

President's response
continues amoral stance
toward poverty on ranch
University President
Donald Kennedy's response
to the petition signed by
over 1,200 members of the
Stanford community contin
ues the amoral stance he has
taken toward poverty at
Webb Ranch.
The clear implication of
Kennedy's letter is that if
negotiations between Webb
Ranch and the farm workers
leave the workers in poverty
that is all right with Stanford
• The University must meet
a higher standard than Ken
nedy's and we urge all who
care about Stanford's reputa
tion — which has already
been damaged by stories in
The New York limes and
other media — to denounce
this policy and withhold sup
port from Stanford until Ken
nedy changes his position.

Disciplinary measures
show disrespect for
students' valid concerns
It was disappointing to
learn that Stanford has cho
sen to bring disciplinary
charges against the 50-plus
students who had the
courage to protest the lack of
diversity within their faculty
by staging a sit-in at the
President's Office.
Disciplinary action is war
ranted, of course, for conduct
that disrupts campus activity
without valid purpose. But
when so many students feel
compelled to take such ac
tion in the patriotic tradition
of non-violent civil dis
obedience, administrators
should stop, listen and work
to create an environment
where the need for such
protests no longer exists.
Retaliating with stern au
thoritarian measures can only
polarize the dynamic and
invite further conflict. The
disciplinary action treats the
students as petty criminals,
shows disrespect for their
legitimate concerns and, more
importantly, shifts the
dialogue from the important
political issues.
The disciplinary action is
also disturbing in light of the
University's recent decision,
under a debatable claim of
First Amendment protection,
not to take action against
certain students who en
gaged in blatantly offensive
racist conduct.
The mixed message of
punishing students who
protest discriminatory hiring
practices while exonerating
those engaged in racist activ
ity does not inspire confi
dence in the educational ex
perience that an esteemed
institution such as Stanford
should seek to provide.
Simply put, these are not
students whose current
studies or careers should be
jeopardized by disciplinary
action.

University President
Donald Kennedy's response
to the petition signed by
over 1,200 members of the
Stanford community contin
ues the amoral stance he has
taken toward poverty at
Webb Ranch.
The clear implication of
Kennedy's letter is that if
negotiations between Webb
Ranch and the farm workers
leave the workers in poverty
that is all right with Stanford
• The University must meet
a higher standard than Ken
nedy's and we urge all who
care about Stanford's reputa
tion — which has already
been damaged by stories in
The New York limes and
other media — to denounce
this policy and withhold sup
port from Stanford until Ken
nedy changes his position.

Disciplinary measures
show disrespect for
students' valid concerns
It was disappointing to
learn that Stanford has cho
sen to bring disciplinary
charges against the 50-plus
students who had the
courage to protest the lack of
diversity within their faculty
by staging a sit-in at the
President's Office.
Disciplinary action is war
ranted, of course, for conduct
that disrupts campus activity
without valid purpose. But
when so many students feel
compelled to take such ac
tion in the patriotic tradition
of non-violent civil dis
obedience, administrators
should stop, listen and work
to create an environment
where the need for such
protests no longer exists.
Retaliating with stern au
thoritarian measures can only
polarize the dynamic and
invite further conflict. The
disciplinary action treats the
students as petty criminals,
shows disrespect for their
legitimate concerns and, more
importantly, shifts the
dialogue from the important
political issues.
The disciplinary action is
also disturbing in light of the
University's recent decision,
under a debatable claim of
First Amendment protection,
not to take action against
certain students who en
gaged in blatantly offensive
racist conduct.
The mixed message of
punishing students who
protest discriminatory hiring
practices while exonerating
those engaged in racist activ
ity does not inspire confi
dence in the educational ex
perience that an esteemed
institution such as Stanford
should seek to provide.
Simply put, these are not
students whose current
studies or careers should be
jeopardized by disciplinary
action.

Webb Ranch employees
should seek change
through union processes
I have received messages
of deep concern from the
Chicano Graduate Student
Association, the Stanford
Raza Medical Association
and, most recently, by way
of a petition, the employees
of Webb Ranch. Each calls on
me to divert University re
sources immediately in order
to enhance the wages and
living conditions of Webb's
employees.
Let me begin with the fun
damental point on which we
all agree — that Webb Ranch
workers, like all working
people, have the right to
expect fair compensation for
their labor.
It is commonly understood
that this responsibility rests
directly with the employer,
and Stanford University is
neither the employer nor the
joint employer of Webb
Ranch workers.
The Agricultural Labor Re
lations Board has already
confirmed that Webb Ranch
has that responsibility, and it
is with ranch management
that desired improvements
must be pursued. The Webb
Ranch employees themselves
have voted that improve
ments should be bargained
with their employer, Webb
Ranch.
From the start, the Univer
sity has been public in its
support of self-determination
by Webb Ranch employees.
Now that the employees
have made their own deci
sion to pursue collective bar
gaining, we all should hope
that both sides — the union
on behalf of the employees,
and the ranch on its own
behalf — will fulfill their
good faith obligations.
This is not to say that the
University has no obligations
as the ranch's lessor, and I
have acknowledged these
from the beginning. We sim
ply disagree on the extent of

the University's obligation as
other parties would choose
to define them. I readily ac
cept Stanford's responsibility
to require that Webb Ranch
operate in compliance with
the laws applicable to their
activities on our premises.
Since the health and safety
citations first came to light,
we have in fact acted
promptly to be sure that all
discrepancies of occupancy
are corrected. 1 am now as
sured that all are corrected,
with the exception of oc
cupancy limits — a matter to
be settled in negotiations
between the union and the
ranch.
The University's concern
for the Webb Ranch employ
ees is greater than may oe
realized. To the extent that 1
differ with those who have
written to me, my difference
is with the means and not
the end.
