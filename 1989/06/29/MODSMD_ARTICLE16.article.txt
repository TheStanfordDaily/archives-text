## Some economic sanctions needed to influence China situation 
### 
With the Beijing massacre and the
ensuing arrests and executions of
Kro-democracy demonstrators, there
ave been widespread discussions
concerning whetner and which eco
nomic sanctions should be imposed
against the current Chinese regime.
In recent years, the economic
i.. # orm in China has reached an im
passe due to unwillingness on the
part of the government to relinquish
its monopoly on political power as
well as its corruption-causing control
on the economy.
As a result, the central government
is facing an ever-increasing deficit as
the enthusiasm of urban workers
plummets and losses by state-owned
enterprises mount.
As an indication of the severity of
the problem, in last year's harvesting
season, the government had to hand
out lOUs to the farmers for their

crops and other farm products. The
government was able to reduce its
official deficit figure by almost 8 per
cent through foreign borrowing and
counting loans as income.
In view of these facts, it is obvious
that blocking the various loans by
international institutions and foreign
countries will have significant sober
ing effects on the current fascist
regime.
President Bush's decision to urge
international institutions to postpone
consideration of any new loans to
China should be applauded. A fur
ther step may be to stop paying the
not-yet-used portion of loans wnich
have already been granted.
It would also be helpful if the con
ditions for the resumption of the
loans be clearly spelled out.
Since 1981, China has enjoyed
most-favored-nation (MFN) status for

her exports to the United States. This
reduces the tariff by as much as 90
percent and greatly facilitates the
access of Chinese goods to the vast
U.S. market.
In view of the current regime's
total disregard for the basic human
rights of Chinese people, it will be
totally inappropriate to continue to
grant China the MFN status under
the present situation.
For the purpose of maintaining
communication channels with demo
cratic elements in China and deny
ing the current regime the excuse of 1
completely closing China's door to
the outside, a total trade embargo
should not be imposed. However,
suspending militant sales to China,
as announced by President Bush, is
very important.
China's military has played a criti
cal role in dismantling the pro-

democracy movement. It should not
be rewarded by receiving equipment
for its modernization.
As the eagerness of the current
Chinese regime to woo back the
foreign investors indicates, a series of
carefully considered economic sanc
tions is probably the most powerful
leverage by which the world commu
nity can influence the situation in
China.
Although the Beijing massacre
seems to have thrown China back
into a new dark age, the legacy of
reform and open-door policy of the
past 10 years will nevertheless have a
profound impact on the eventual
outcome of tne current crisis in
China.
