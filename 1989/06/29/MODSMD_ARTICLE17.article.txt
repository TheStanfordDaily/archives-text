## hands 
### Kristin Vincent 
Now I know it's a luxury, but once a month
I get my nails done. Professionally. At my friend
Bev's shop, called Nails & Stuff. Bev will do
your nails for five dollars. She'll also Zippity
Hot Wax hair that grows in unwanted areas,
like in between my friend Ellen's eyebrows.
Bev's shop is between the T.V. rental place
and Denture World. Bev does nails on one of
two card tables. She waxes girls in the bathroom.
She has a radio in the shop, and sometimes, if
her cat has had a bunch of kittens, Bev will
bring a couple of them in. She also has some
fluffy stuffed animals thrown around for decora
tion.

A couple of
months ago, Bev
hired a girl to work
for her. Her name
is Janet, and you
should see her go.
After you get your

nails polished, she will paint teeny
pictures of hearts, birds, bolts of
lightning or anything else you can
feature to tell her. She will even
put a genuine fake diamond chip
right on the tip of your pinky. That
Janet will glue it right on. She
painted a tulip on my thumb a
while back, but I chipped it off
opening a can of dog food. After
that, I said, "No more fancy works
for me." It costs a dollar more any
way, and it's not always that easy
to find an extra dollar for your very
own when you don't work.
Don't get me wrong, Emmet

treats me real good. It's just that I
don't think he'd go in much for me
saying, "Emmet, how's 'bout giving
me five dollars to get my nails
done?" He doesn't like my hands
that much anyway. "Too small," he
would always say; and after the
babies came, he would add that
they always looked swolled up, too.
Maybe I eat too much salt. I like
salt and pepper a lot, but Emmet
says it's not good for you, so I've
taken to seasoning my food right
in the kitchen so as not to get on
Emmet's nerves. After all, he works
mighty hard all day and I'm thankful
for that. I know men who lay around
on the couch all day watching game
shows and drinking beer as early as
ten thirty in the morning. I'm
thankful Emmet doesn't do that.
Or what about the men who take
their whole paycheck to the beer

garden and put it right up on the
bar? Not my Emmet, he gives me
money out of his paycheck each
week for groceries and clothes for
the kids. And I can keep the change
if any's leftover. When there is, I
take it and put it in my underwear
drawer in this plastic silver egg that
my pantyhose camc in.
I also do something else to get
my money. I shake the laundry. I
twist and pull and tug all of Emmet's
clothes before I put them through
the rinse cycle. (Emmet got me a
new washer-dryer for our anniver
sary last year.) Between all the
change he gets at lunch, 1 make
quite a lot. After 1 get my nails
done, if there's any extra, I give it
to the kids. I've set up a system
where they do odd jobs for me and
I pay them. "It's important to know
the value of work," Emmet says.
"Money doesn't grow on trees," I
tell the children. 1 want them to
be thankful to their father. Honest
ly, I do. He's a good man. He drinks,
but he doesn't smoke, gamble, or
beat me.
When my collection got to seven
dollars and twenty-five cents, I
dialed up Bev and told her I was
coming in on Tuesday right after
Emmet left for work and 1 had the
breakfast dishes done. She said Ellen
was coming in for her usual wax
and then Sylvia for a pedicure, and
asked if it would be alright if Janet
did me. "Fine," I said. Janet did me
a few times before. "But tell her I
don't want anything fancy," I said.
"Just the regular."
I like my hands to look neat and
clean. I think it's important for a
girl to keep her hands looking that
way. No long, red, painted nails
with lightning bolts on them. I

mean, a girl's hands should look
like you could depend on them to
feed you if you got sick or to untie
knots if you'd pulled your shoe
string too hard.
That's why 1 like number forty
two polish. It's the color of a baby's
cheek when you take it out in the
weather. Blushing. 1 just get a good
straight trim across the top and two
coats of #42. That's it.
Emmet hardly notices, but when
he does, 1 tell him 1 did it myself.
1 know it's a lie, but 1 like my nails
to look cared for. Afterall, 1 did do
the shaking and saving myself. I'm
just thankful he doesn't mind the
polish. Some men think it's whore
paint. Whores don't wear number
forty-two, though. I bet even a nun
could get away with the color. It's
so light that it doesn't even make
your nails look yellow underneath
when you take it off.
When I pulled into the joint
parking lot that Nails & Stuff shares
with Denture World, I saw Ellen's
car parked right next to Bev's. Ellen
always has what Emmet calls "con
cerned with universal peace"
bumper stickers on the back of her
car. This month's was SAVE A
COW AND YOURSELF- VEAL
MAY BE TOXIC. We don't eat veal
anyway. It's too skimpy to be so
expensive. When I get out of my
car, I see one of the secretaries who
works down at the plant with Em
met. I say hello and ask her if she's
come to have her nails done. She
shakes her head without smiling.
* * *
"Hi Bev," I say as I put my car
keys in my pocketbook. "Where's
Janet?"
"She'll be out in a minute. She's

mixing up her Slimall drink in the
bathroom. She's lost three pounds
already."
"That's great," I say. "You know,
Janet's not really fat, she's just
lumpy. Kinda like mashed potatoes
when you don't take the time to
smooth them out." 1 sec Ellen. She
has a large red mark right above
her nose. "Hi Ellen," I say.
"How are ya?" she asks as she
gets up from the La-Z-Boy chair

feed you if you got sick or to untie
knots if you'd pulled your shoe
string too hard.
That's why 1 like number forty
two polish. It's the color of a baby's
cheek when you take it out in the
weather. Blushing. 1 just get a good
straight trim across the top and two
coats of #42. That's it.
Emmet hardly notices, but when
he does, 1 tell him 1 did it myself.
1 know it's a lie, but 1 like my nails
to look cared for. Afterall, 1 did do
the shaking and saving myself. I'm
just thankful he doesn't mind the
polish. Some men think it's whore
paint. Whores don't wear number
forty-two, though. I bet even a nun
could get away with the color. It's
so light that it doesn't even make
your nails look yellow underneath
when you take it off.
When I pulled into the joint
parking lot that Nails & Stuff shares
with Denture World, I saw Ellen's
car parked right next to Bev's. Ellen
always has what Emmet calls "con
cerned with universal peace"
bumper stickers on the back of her
car. This month's was SAVE A
COW AND YOURSELF- VEAL
MAY BE TOXIC. We don't eat veal
anyway. It's too skimpy to be so
expensive. When I get out of my
car, I see one of the secretaries who
works down at the plant with Em
met. I say hello and ask her if she's
come to have her nails done. She
shakes her head without smiling.
* * *
"Hi Bev," I say as I put my car
keys in my pocketbook. "Where's
Janet?"
"She'll be out in a minute. She's

mixing up her Slimall drink in the
bathroom. She's lost three pounds
already."
"That's great," I say. "You know,
Janet's not really fat, she's just
lumpy. Kinda like mashed potatoes
when you don't take the time to
smooth them out." 1 sec Ellen. She
has a large red mark right above
her nose. "Hi Ellen," I say.
"How are ya?" she asks as she
gets up from the La-Z-Boy chair

Now I know it's a luxury, but once a month
I get my nails done. Professionally. At my friend
Bev's shop, called Nails & Stuff. Bev will do
your nails for five dollars. She'll also Zippity
Hot Wax hair that grows in unwanted areas,
like in between my friend Ellen's eyebrows.
Bev's shop is between the T.V. rental place
and Denture World. Bev does nails on one of
two card tables. She waxes girls in the bathroom.
She has a radio in the shop, and sometimes, if
her cat has had a bunch of kittens, Bev will
bring a couple of them in. She also has some
fluffy stuffed animals thrown around for decora
tion.

A couple of
months ago, Bev
hired a girl to work
for her. Her name
is Janet, and you
should see her go.
After you get your

nails polished, she will paint teeny
pictures of hearts, birds, bolts of
lightning or anything else you can
feature to tell her. She will even
put a genuine fake diamond chip
right on the tip of your pinky. That
Janet will glue it right on. She
painted a tulip on my thumb a
while back, but I chipped it off
opening a can of dog food. After
that, I said, "No more fancy works
for me." It costs a dollar more any
way, and it's not always that easy
to find an extra dollar for your very
own when you don't work.
Don't get me wrong, Emmet

treats me real good. It's just that I
don't think he'd go in much for me
saying, "Emmet, how's 'bout giving
me five dollars to get my nails
done?" He doesn't like my hands
that much anyway. "Too small," he
would always say; and after the
babies came, he would add that
they always looked swolled up, too.
Maybe I eat too much salt. I like
salt and pepper a lot, but Emmet
says it's not good for you, so I've
taken to seasoning my food right
in the kitchen so as not to get on
Emmet's nerves. After all, he works
mighty hard all day and I'm thankful
for that. I know men who lay around
on the couch all day watching game
shows and drinking beer as early as
ten thirty in the morning. I'm
thankful Emmet doesn't do that.
Or what about the men who take
their whole paycheck to the beer

garden and put it right up on the
bar? Not my Emmet, he gives me
money out of his paycheck each
week for groceries and clothes for
the kids. And I can keep the change
if any's leftover. When there is, I
take it and put it in my underwear
drawer in this plastic silver egg that
my pantyhose camc in.
I also do something else to get
my money. I shake the laundry. I
twist and pull and tug all of Emmet's
clothes before I put them through
the rinse cycle. (Emmet got me a
new washer-dryer for our anniver
sary last year.) Between all the
change he gets at lunch, 1 make
quite a lot. After 1 get my nails
done, if there's any extra, I give it
to the kids. I've set up a system
where they do odd jobs for me and
I pay them. "It's important to know
the value of work," Emmet says.
"Money doesn't grow on trees," I
tell the children. 1 want them to
be thankful to their father. Honest
ly, I do. He's a good man. He drinks,
but he doesn't smoke, gamble, or
beat me.
When my collection got to seven
dollars and twenty-five cents, I
dialed up Bev and told her I was
coming in on Tuesday right after
Emmet left for work and 1 had the
breakfast dishes done. She said Ellen
was coming in for her usual wax
and then Sylvia for a pedicure, and
asked if it would be alright if Janet
did me. "Fine," I said. Janet did me
a few times before. "But tell her I
don't want anything fancy," I said.
"Just the regular."
I like my hands to look neat and
clean. I think it's important for a
girl to keep her hands looking that
way. No long, red, painted nails
with lightning bolts on them. I

mean, a girl's hands should look
like you could depend on them to
feed you if you got sick or to untie
knots if you'd pulled your shoe
string too hard.
