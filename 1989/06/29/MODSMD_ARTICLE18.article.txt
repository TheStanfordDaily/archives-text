## Sigourney Back in White 
### Susan McKean Editorial staff 
I WATCHED, MOMENTARILY dis
tracted, and took a second look as two
slender figures of grace and sophistica
tion — one tall and poised, the other
a coltish version of her companion — glided
by the graduation ceremony seating we were
arranging on the grass. The woman in white
tilted her head to me and then to the
Rodin character she passed.
I whispered aloud, "That's Sigourney
Weaver," as 1 watched her metered gait,
auburn hair and straight back disappearing
into the Quad. My chair crew stopped
straightening the rows for a minute and
our gazes hung like a train behind her.
Work resumed. Preoccupied, I said Just
A Minute to no one in particular and ran
off clumsily, muttering something about The
Daily and hoping I wasn't stooping to tacki
ness or unforgivable job negligence.
All the dirt on my body, on my T-shirt
and under my ragged nails took on
monstrous proportions. 1 watched them
sweep into Memorial Church and ran across
the rosetta toward them. 1 pulled myself to
a halt just inside the church door. That
would be tacky. I sat down on the stoop,
caught my breath and rehearsed an intro
duction.
I used it several minutes later, face to
face with Sigourney Weaver's creamy com
plexion and strikingly chiseled cheekbones.
Unruffled by my unannounced appearance
and abrupt request, she tenderly shook my
hand and introduced herself, her niece, her
husband and her tour guide. We arranged
to meet an hour later at Old Union, while
her niece attended an admissions informa
tion session.
Sigourney Weaver graduated from Stan
ford in 1972 with a bachelor's degree in

English. But her recollections, sitting at a
white table in front of Tresidder Union,
turned naturally toward the drama of her
days here. Little of it took place on stage;
she recalls the drama of teachers in the
classroom, protests in White Plaza, dorm
mates in her two Wilbur Hall homes. She
remembers those years as passionate, out
rageously fearless and formative.
She fingers her collar, and proclaims her
move from Sarah Lawrence College to Stan
ford after freshman year to be the best
decision she ever made.
It was at Stanford that she discovered
her love of acting.
But she didn't find it in the drama de
partment.
"I thought the drama department at the
time was extremely stuffy. They were always
doing very safe productions.... So 1 was
part of a group that we founded, called the
Palo Alto Company, which sprang out of
a defunct frat called Beta Chi, the hippie
frat. We did the most outrageous theater.
"We did a lot of things that the drama
department probably would have said, 'Well,
you're not ready to do that.' We just did
them all. That's where 1 discovered how
much I enjoyed doing theater.
"I miss getting made up with 10 other
people in a little bathroom with a little
broken piece of mirror for all of us. It was
all so much more formal at Yale (Drama
School). I think the main reason 1 became
an actor was 1 learned so much and had
so much fun here."
Sigourney hadn't planned on being an
actor and she paints a rather self
depreciating picture of her acting ability in
those days.
W I was not an outstanding person in the
group. If someone had asked then who
