## Sigourney Back in White 
### Susan McKean Editorial staff 
I WATCHED, MOMENTARILY dis
tracted, and took a second look as two
slender figures of grace and sophistica
tion — one tall and poised, the other
a coltish version of her companion — glided
by the graduation ceremony seating we were
arranging on the grass. The woman in white
tilted her head to me and then to the
Rodin character she passed.
I whispered aloud, "That's Sigourney
Weaver," as 1 watched her metered gait,
auburn hair and straight back disappearing
into the Quad. My chair crew stopped
straightening the rows for a minute and
our gazes hung like a train behind her.
Work resumed. Preoccupied, I said Just
A Minute to no one in particular and ran
off clumsily, muttering something about The
Daily and hoping I wasn't stooping to tacki
ness or unforgivable job negligence.
All the dirt on my body, on my T-shirt
and under my ragged nails took on
monstrous proportions. 1 watched them
sweep into Memorial Church and ran across
the rosetta toward them. 1 pulled myself to
a halt just inside the church door. That
would be tacky. I sat down on the stoop,
caught my breath and rehearsed an intro
duction.
I used it several minutes later, face to
face with Sigourney Weaver's creamy com
plexion and strikingly chiseled cheekbones.
Unruffled by my unannounced appearance
and abrupt request, she tenderly shook my
hand and introduced herself, her niece, her
husband and her tour guide. We arranged
to meet an hour later at Old Union, while
her niece attended an admissions informa
tion session.
Sigourney Weaver graduated from Stan
ford in 1972 with a bachelor's degree in

English. But her recollections, sitting at a
white table in front of Tresidder Union,
turned naturally toward the drama of her
days here. Little of it took place on stage;
she recalls the drama of teachers in the
classroom, protests in White Plaza, dorm
mates in her two Wilbur Hall homes. She
remembers those years as passionate, out
rageously fearless and formative.
She fingers her collar, and proclaims her
move from Sarah Lawrence College to Stan
ford after freshman year to be the best
decision she ever made.
It was at Stanford that she discovered
her love of acting.
But she didn't find it in the drama de
partment.
"I thought the drama department at the
time was extremely stuffy. They were always
doing very safe productions.... So 1 was
part of a group that we founded, called the
Palo Alto Company, which sprang out of
a defunct frat called Beta Chi, the hippie
frat. We did the most outrageous theater.
"We did a lot of things that the drama
department probably would have said, 'Well,
you're not ready to do that.' We just did
them all. That's where 1 discovered how
much I enjoyed doing theater.
"I miss getting made up with 10 other
people in a little bathroom with a little
broken piece of mirror for all of us. It was
all so much more formal at Yale (Drama
School). I think the main reason 1 became
an actor was 1 learned so much and had
so much fun here."
Sigourney hadn't planned on being an
actor and she paints a rather self
depreciating picture of her acting ability in
those days.
W I was not an outstanding person in the
group. If someone had asked then who


Andy Effort - Daily
would be successful in the com
pany, I would have been one of
the last picked.... It's a very un
fair business.
"I was very torn. I really wanted
to be a journalist. I really wanted
to be a writer. And I was planning
to get my Ph.D. in English. I was
taking all these honors courses my
last year and wc began to study
criticism of criticism and it was
getting pretty dry.
'So, I went to see my adviser
in the English department and
said, 'Is it going to be like this in
graduate school?' And he said,
'Yeah, I'm afraid so.' And I said,
|she grunts out loud here] 'I've got
to get out of this.'
Off stage and on, she played
the role of an early '70s student
impeccably. Walking through
White Plaza, she says, rekindles
memories of protests, demonstra
tions, arrests, rioutous antics.

"One year wc had a protest fair,
with a booth where you could
throw a brick through a plate-glass
window for all those who weren't
doing it for real."
Despite the flourish of her life
here, she reminds me that it wasn't
that way for all students. Students,
of course, were not all united in
thought or action. It's just that
flourish is more easily remembered
than hesitance.
"I recall a polarity among the
students between the people who
were coming to Stanford to get a
good start and no matter how
much tear gas was floating around,
they were in their dorms playing
cards or studying while the rest
of us were out living the Revolu
tion.
1 think a lot of us understood
we were getting a very privileged
education and perhaps felt some
embarassmcnt from it."
Since then, she has admirably
steered clear of embarassmcnt. A
philosophy for sanity in her busi
ness keeps Sigourney Weaver un
scathed by the cut-throat movie

world. She makes sure she enjoys
it all, even the "shameless adver
tising" of her Ghostbusters pin and
watch, which she somehow
manages to wear elegantly.
She says she only appears in
movies that she would like to see,
and screeches, holding her
stomach, at the suggestion of
choosing her roles according to a
preferred image.
"I don't care how great a part
is. If it's not part of a story that
1 find interesting, I would never
want to do it. And, also, I like
to be in movies that people do
end up seeing.
"So I care a great deal about
who the director is: Is it someone
who is going to fink out halfway
through and give up his vision, or
is it someone who will fight and
scream and hurl himself at the
studio heads to get what he needs.
He or she. That's very important.
"I've developed a philosophy
about this business. Despite the
things that you want to do, are
not given to do and break your
heart, there's always something

just as good if not better just
around the corner.
"For instance, I was up for two
leads and I screen-tested for them
and I lost both of them, and then
I was offered this small role in
'The Year of Living Dangerously'
by Peter Weir. And 1 thought,
'Well, what the hell,' and it turned
out to be one of the greatest ex
periences I ever had."
Although she says her best
cinematic performances are "still
ahead of me," out of those already
made she ranks "The Year of
Living Dangerously" and "Gorillas
in the Mist" as her favorites. Both
take place on other continents,
and her favor for them suggests
the continued influence of two
mentors found during her college
years. She remembers as a student
looking up to both Jane Goodall,
one of the first zoologists to study
wild gorillas, and Margaret Mead,
a pioneering anthropologist, after
she heard them speak in Dinkel
spiel Auditorium.
But as a successful actor, she
has some surprising things to say

about the impact of films on so
ciety.
"I guess I don't really think that
a film is important enough to really
influence anything. A film can in
spire you and move you and make
you laugh or take you someplace
where you haven't been. 'Gorillas'
is a wonderful movie because it
will take you to Africa, to an
Africa you didn't imagine, a cold
Africa. And expose you to an ex
perience. Other films are like a
roller coaster, you're exhausted
when you come out I hope
(movies) don't influence people
too much."
"I would be horrified if anyone
thought of me as a role model."

out to be one of the greatest ex
periences I ever had."
Although she says her best
cinematic performances are "still
ahead of me," out of those already
made she ranks "The Year of
Living Dangerously" and "Gorillas
in the Mist" as her favorites. Both
take place on other continents,
and her favor for them suggests
the continued influence of two
mentors found during her college
years. She remembers as a student
looking up to both Jane Goodall,
one of the first zoologists to study
wild gorillas, and Margaret Mead,
a pioneering anthropologist, after
she heard them speak in Dinkel
spiel Auditorium.
But as a successful actor, she
has some surprising things to say

about the impact of films on so
ciety.
"I guess I don't really think that
a film is important enough to really
influence anything. A film can in
spire you and move you and make
you laugh or take you someplace
where you haven't been. 'Gorillas'
is a wonderful movie because it
will take you to Africa, to an
Africa you didn't imagine, a cold
Africa. And expose you to an ex
perience. Other films are like a
roller coaster, you're exhausted
when you come out I hope
(movies) don't influence people
too much."
"I would be horrified if anyone
thought of me as a role model."

Watch m next week's Jubilee for
Sigourney's thoughts on
"Ghostbusters II" and gender issues
in the film industry.
I WATCHED, MOMENTARILY dis
tracted, and took a second look as two
slender figures of grace and sophistica
tion — one tall and poised, the other
a coltish version of her companion — glided
by the graduation ceremony seating we were
arranging on the grass. The woman in white
tilted her head to me and then to the
Rodin character she passed.
I whispered aloud, "That's Sigourney
Weaver," as 1 watched her metered gait,
auburn hair and straight back disappearing
into the Quad. My chair crew stopped
straightening the rows for a minute and
our gazes hung like a train behind her.
Work resumed. Preoccupied, I said Just
A Minute to no one in particular and ran
off clumsily, muttering something about The
Daily and hoping I wasn't stooping to tacki
ness or unforgivable job negligence.
All the dirt on my body, on my T-shirt
and under my ragged nails took on
monstrous proportions. 1 watched them
sweep into Memorial Church and ran across
the rosetta toward them. 1 pulled myself to
a halt just inside the church door. That
would be tacky. I sat down on the stoop,
caught my breath and rehearsed an intro
duction.
I used it several minutes later, face to
face with Sigourney Weaver's creamy com
plexion and strikingly chiseled cheekbones.
Unruffled by my unannounced appearance
and abrupt request, she tenderly shook my
hand and introduced herself, her niece, her
husband and her tour guide. We arranged
to meet an hour later at Old Union, while
her niece attended an admissions informa
tion session.
Sigourney Weaver graduated from Stan
ford in 1972 with a bachelor's degree in

English. But her recollections, sitting at a
white table in front of Tresidder Union,
turned naturally toward the drama of her
days here. Little of it took place on stage;
she recalls the drama of teachers in the
classroom, protests in White Plaza, dorm
mates in her two Wilbur Hall homes. She
remembers those years as passionate, out
rageously fearless and formative.
She fingers her collar, and proclaims her
move from Sarah Lawrence College to Stan
ford after freshman year to be the best
decision she ever made.
It was at Stanford that she discovered
her love of acting.
But she didn't find it in the drama de
partment.
"I thought the drama department at the
time was extremely stuffy. They were always
doing very safe productions.... So 1 was
part of a group that we founded, called the
Palo Alto Company, which sprang out of
a defunct frat called Beta Chi, the hippie
frat. We did the most outrageous theater.
"We did a lot of things that the drama
department probably would have said, 'Well,
you're not ready to do that.' We just did
them all. That's where 1 discovered how
much I enjoyed doing theater.
"I miss getting made up with 10 other
people in a little bathroom with a little
broken piece of mirror for all of us. It was
all so much more formal at Yale (Drama
School). I think the main reason 1 became
an actor was 1 learned so much and had
so much fun here."
Sigourney hadn't planned on being an
actor and she paints a rather self
depreciating picture of her acting ability in
those days.
W I was not an outstanding person in the
group. If someone had asked then who


Andy Effort - Daily
would be successful in the com
pany, I would have been one of
the last picked.... It's a very un
fair business.
"I was very torn. I really wanted
to be a journalist. I really wanted
to be a writer. And I was planning
to get my Ph.D. in English. I was
taking all these honors courses my
last year and wc began to study
criticism of criticism and it was
getting pretty dry.
'So, I went to see my adviser
in the English department and
said, 'Is it going to be like this in
graduate school?' And he said,
'Yeah, I'm afraid so.' And I said,
|she grunts out loud here] 'I've got
to get out of this.'
Off stage and on, she played
the role of an early '70s student
impeccably. Walking through
White Plaza, she says, rekindles
memories of protests, demonstra
tions, arrests, rioutous antics.

"One year wc had a protest fair,
with a booth where you could
throw a brick through a plate-glass
window for all those who weren't
doing it for real."
Despite the flourish of her life
here, she reminds me that it wasn't
that way for all students. Students,
of course, were not all united in
thought or action. It's just that
flourish is more easily remembered
than hesitance.
"I recall a polarity among the
students between the people who
were coming to Stanford to get a
good start and no matter how
much tear gas was floating around,
they were in their dorms playing
cards or studying while the rest
of us were out living the Revolu
tion.
1 think a lot of us understood
we were getting a very privileged
education and perhaps felt some
embarassmcnt from it."
Since then, she has admirably
steered clear of embarassmcnt. A
philosophy for sanity in her busi
ness keeps Sigourney Weaver un
scathed by the cut-throat movie

world. She makes sure she enjoys
it all, even the "shameless adver
tising" of her Ghostbusters pin and
watch, which she somehow
manages to wear elegantly.
She says she only appears in
movies that she would like to see,
and screeches, holding her
stomach, at the suggestion of
choosing her roles according to a
preferred image.
"I don't care how great a part
is. If it's not part of a story that
1 find interesting, I would never
want to do it. And, also, I like
to be in movies that people do
end up seeing.
"So I care a great deal about
who the director is: Is it someone
who is going to fink out halfway
through and give up his vision, or
is it someone who will fight and
scream and hurl himself at the
studio heads to get what he needs.
He or she. That's very important.
"I've developed a philosophy
about this business. Despite the
things that you want to do, are
not given to do and break your
heart, there's always something

just as good if not better just
around the corner.
"For instance, I was up for two
leads and I screen-tested for them
and I lost both of them, and then
I was offered this small role in
'The Year of Living Dangerously'
by Peter Weir. And 1 thought,
'Well, what the hell,' and it turned
out to be one of the greatest ex

philosophy for sanity in her busi
ness keeps Sigourney Weaver un
scathed by the cut-throat movie

world. She makes sure she enjoys
it all, even the "shameless adver
tising" of her Ghostbusters pin and
watch, which she somehow
manages to wear elegantly.
She says she only appears in
movies that she would like to see,
and screeches, holding her
stomach, at the suggestion of
choosing her roles according to a
preferred image.
"I don't care how great a part
is. If it's not part of a story that
1 find interesting, I would never
want to do it. And, also, I like
to be in movies that people do
end up seeing.
"So I care a great deal about
who the director is: Is it someone
who is going to fink out halfway
through and give up his vision, or
is it someone who will fight and
scream and hurl himself at the
studio heads to get what he needs.
He or she. That's very important.
"I've developed a philosophy
about this business. Despite the
things that you want to do, are
not given to do and break your
heart, there's always something

just as good if not better just
around the corner.
"For instance, I was up for two
leads and I screen-tested for them
and I lost both of them, and then
I was offered this small role in
'The Year of Living Dangerously'
by Peter Weir. And 1 thought,
'Well, what the hell,' and it turned
out to be one of the greatest ex
periences I ever had."
Although she says her best
cinematic performances are "still
ahead of me," out of those already
made she ranks "The Year of
Living Dangerously" and "Gorillas
in the Mist" as her favorites. Both
take place on other continents,
and her favor for them suggests
the continued influence of two
mentors found during her college
years. She remembers as a student
looking up to both Jane Goodall,
one of the first zoologists to study
wild gorillas, and Margaret Mead,
a pioneering anthropologist, after
she heard them speak in Dinkel
spiel Auditorium.
But as a successful actor, she
has some surprising things to say

about the impact of films on so
ciety.
"I guess I don't really think that
a film is important enough to really
influence anything. A film can in
spire you and move you and make
you laugh or take you someplace
where you haven't been. 'Gorillas'
is a wonderful movie because it
will take you to Africa, to an
Africa you didn't imagine, a cold
Africa. And expose you to an ex
perience. Other films are like a
roller coaster, you're exhausted
when you come out I hope
(movies) don't influence people
too much."
"I would be horrified if anyone
thought of me as a role model."
