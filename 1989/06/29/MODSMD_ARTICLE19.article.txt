# Guilty of BAT-HYPE
## 
### Mark Weiner Editorial staff Susan McKean Editorial staff 
At 6:30, on the evening of the "Batman" premiere, we joined
a group of eager moviegoers at a local theater. Why were they
there? W:re they Bat-fans?
"No, not at all," said one person who had been waiting since
3. "It's just the thing to do, I guess."
Another hapless victim of Batman hype. Thanks to all the
publicity, people don't have any choice but to find out what all
the fuss is about.
With this issue, we're guilty of spreading the hype, too. But
our hype has a different twist.

The only truly interesting
quality of "Batman" is the hype
that surrounds it. Sexist, subtly
racist and offering little expansion
of the Batman persona, "Batman"
would have little with which to
redeem itself were it not for Jack
Nicholson's portrayal of the Joker.
Like so many films forced upon
the public by the Culture Industry,
this one often is viciously misogy
nist. Kim Basinger: the mastur
batory photojournalist who nearly
brings our superhero to ruin. Mi
chael Keaton: the Dark Knight in
whose body violence and domina
tion freely mix with sexuality. Jack
Nicholson: the pathological artist
who titillates his audience by
bringing Basinger just to the point
of mutilation.
Such characterizations arc par
ticularly unfortunate. Similar
pernicious characterizations per

meate the entire film.
"Batman" was a film with tre
mendous potential. The psycho
logical tensions both within Bat
man and between Batman and the
Joker, provided rich material for
the director.
But rather than exploit this ma
terial, "Batman" relies on its
"Metropolis Mike set to keep the
audience's attention. The Joker is
insane but shallow. Batman's psy
chological depth is almost inap
parent: a vigilante in a decayed
urban landscape, the darker, ob
sessive aspects of his personality
are muted.
To make this film interesting,
pay attention to the ideological
implications and history of the
Batman character. Notice how
Bat-hype has made watching this
film a cultural obligation, how it
has created a pseudo-event.
Unfortunately, this critical
stance is one of the few avenues
of enjoyment that "Batman" offers
its audience.

I love a man. "Batman" insults
the emotion.
I respect women. "Batman" in
sults the gender.
1 admire Jack Nicholson. "Bat
man" insults his brilliance.
Don't let the Batman mystique
insult your intelligence.
It can happen. You come out
of the movie shaken up. You fling
doors open, strike breathless poses
in the moonlight, test the accelera
tion rate on your car. "Batman"
has become your standard for
heroism, gender relations and
modern salvation.
But be aware. The box office
has pulled a fast one. "Batman"
glorifies the rape of the heroine.
It trivializes the struggle of gcxxl
and evil. It leaves gaping holes in
the plot, excuses cliche hap
penstance and shamefully reheats
already overcookcd scenes.
"Young Frankenstein" is burned
to a crisp as Wayne and Vale cat
dinner separated by the length of
a huge table in a baronial dining
hall. The "Ghostbusters" gargoyles
leave one New York for another,
to scowl atop similar buildings.
Balloon relatives of the Stay-Putt
marshmallow man turn out for the
reunion. And 60 years after they
first appeared in "Metropolis,"
Fritz Ling's conspicuously artificial
cityscapcs find another use.
Throughout \his century, Soviet
writers have dwelt on the problem
of expressing the "new life" in the
old language. 1 think "Batman"
suggests that the reverse is now
an American cultural malady.
We're preserving old culture in
cutting-edge cinematic tech

niques. And like the "new life" in
the Soviet Union, the old world
view baked into Batman has grown
stale.
A kernel of truth and intrigue
in "Batman" emerges briefly as
Batman and the Joker argue about
who generated the other, as we
see the delicate balance of good
and evil.
But most of the time I was
trying to spit a rancid aftertaste
out of my mouth.

Unfortunately, this critical
stance is one of the few avenues
of enjoyment that "Batman" offers
its audience.

I love a man. "Batman" insults
the emotion.
I respect women. "Batman" in
sults the gender.
1 admire Jack Nicholson. "Bat
man" insults his brilliance.
Don't let the Batman mystique
insult your intelligence.
It can happen. You come out
of the movie shaken up. You fling
doors open, strike breathless poses
in the moonlight, test the accelera
tion rate on your car. "Batman"
has become your standard for
heroism, gender relations and
modern salvation.
But be aware. The box office
has pulled a fast one. "Batman"
glorifies the rape of the heroine.
It trivializes the struggle of gcxxl
and evil. It leaves gaping holes in
the plot, excuses cliche hap
penstance and shamefully reheats
already overcookcd scenes.
"Young Frankenstein" is burned
to a crisp as Wayne and Vale cat
dinner separated by the length of
a huge table in a baronial dining
hall. The "Ghostbusters" gargoyles
leave one New York for another,
to scowl atop similar buildings.
Balloon relatives of the Stay-Putt
marshmallow man turn out for the
reunion. And 60 years after they
first appeared in "Metropolis,"
Fritz Ling's conspicuously artificial
cityscapcs find another use.
Throughout \his century, Soviet
writers have dwelt on the problem
of expressing the "new life" in the
old language. 1 think "Batman"
suggests that the reverse is now
an American cultural malady.
We're preserving old culture in
cutting-edge cinematic tech

niques. And like the "new life" in
the Soviet Union, the old world
view baked into Batman has grown
stale.
A kernel of truth and intrigue
in "Batman" emerges briefly as
Batman and the Joker argue about
who generated the other, as we
see the delicate balance of good
and evil.
But most of the time I was
trying to spit a rancid aftertaste
out of my mouth.
