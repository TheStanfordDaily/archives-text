Halfway through "Barman," the
beautiful Vicki Vale (1) has
declared her love for Bruce Wayne
and (2) learned his secret identity
as Batman.
Sound familiar, comic hook
fans? In Hollywood, doesn't every
costumed hero willingly hare his
Achilles heel — his secret identity
to the first gixxl-looking woman
he meets?
And to Vicki Vale, no less. For
some reason, Bruce Wayne likes

this weakly-characterized, often
kidnapped woman. And Alfred, his
faithful, dignified butler, approving
the thing? Suggesting it' Because
Wayne is lonely? I couldn't believe

Michael Keaton's Bruce
Wayne/Batman doesn't convince

and out of the fog without a
monosyllabic to spare.
Jack Nicholson, however, is per

is given good lines and plenty of
room to make his character into

tongue-in-cheek score. The Joker
is egotistic, zany, peevishly vicious,
and callous — the villain for the
80s.
There's a lot of style here,
layered on some old formulas.
But don't expect substance or
quality.
