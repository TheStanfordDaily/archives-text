# Emo amazes at Frost
## 
### David Chang Staff writer 
Wc all had a gawky kid in
our neighborhood when we
were in high school. He was
too dumb (or maybe too smart
...) to be a geek. Way too
strange to be a prep. He scared
the girls and hated school. He
lived in some weird world of
his own. He was a spaz.
Last Saturday, Emo Phillips,
the patron saint of spazzes,
came to Stanford's Frost Am
phitheater with six other pro
minent comedians and gave us
a hilarious glimpse of that world
at the Third Annual South Bay
Comedy Picnic. The afternoon
crowd responded by calling him
back for an encore.
"You guys are really cheering

me up," he said, in his quirky,
lilting voice. "I'm really de
pressed. I loaned $7,000 to a
friend for Now
I don't know wnat he looks
like."
The annual picnic benefits
the Neonatal Intensive Care
Unit at the Stanford University
Hospital and attracts some of
the best talent in comedy. Last
year, Robin Williams showed
up as a surprise guest.
The picnic is one of the many
community projects undertaken
by the Palo Alto Jaycees, a
group of business people aged
21 to 40. Others projects have
included food drives and the
fund drive for the Palo Alto
Senior Center. For information
about their activities, call (415)
323-PAJC.
