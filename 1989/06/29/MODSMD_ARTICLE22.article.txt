# Prince's 'Batman' stands on its own
## 
### Sherifa Edoga 
Prince's soundtrack for "Batman" is both original
and very typical of His Purpleness. He has created
a drama of his own in the album. At the same time,
"Batman" is funky, sexy and fun, like Prince's other
albums.
Each song is performed in the voices of the
characters, exploring their natures and sometimes
creating dialogue between them. For example, Bat
man and the Joker are constantly contrasted —
except in the sexual arena, where they are both
extremely carnal and vocal about their desires.

Don't get the album because
you liked the movie.

This interplay between characters culminates in
"Batdancc." It includes Batman, the Joker and
Gemini, a character Prince created to watch and
comment on the proceedings. The aural spectacle
is topped off by the voices of the Bat Dancers, the
Joker's Gang, and the choir.
On the down side, the album can get repetitive,
and some of the rhymes are incredibly inane. "I've
seen the future and it works/If there's life after, we
will see/So I can't go ... like a jerk," he sings in
"The Future."
On the whole, though, the album is excellent.
Through the Joker-inspired songs "Electric Chair,"
"Partyman" and "Trust," Prince is devilishly creative,
in the spirit of Jack Nicholson's brilliant performance.
He is in his element writing for a psychotic, sexual
character — the lyrics and music are humorous,
exciting and downright sinful.
Also, unlike Michael Keaton's underdeveloped
Batman, Prince's Batman is a complex hero torn
between his duties and his love/lust for Vicki Vale.
The album is a little over-hyped, especially as a
soundtrack. Don't get the album because you liked
the movie; only two of Prince's songs appear prom
inently in the movie.
But Prince's "Batman" is very much his own —
entertaining, original, and worths the money.
