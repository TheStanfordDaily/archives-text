# Sanborn: innovator with a golden horn
## 
### Jordan Seng 
After 11 acclaimed albums span
ning two decades, one might ex
pect David Sanborn to succumb
to formula, to rely on something
that worked in the past. But it
ain't so. Sanborn's alto sax has a
charm akin to that of the Pied
Piper's flute, and jazz aficionados
still merrily follow behind him
from one ground-breaking record
ing to another.
Sanborn headlines at the
Shoreline Amphitheatre on July 8,
adding his name to an already

impressive list of jazz artists who
have performed there this summer,
including George Benson and
Spyro Gyra.
There's no such thing as vintage
Sanborn. Expect a wide range of
styles, reflecting his lifelong pas
sion for rhythm and blues and his

taste for the most avant-garde in
jazz.
But don't worry. David Sanborn
is an entertainer, and the person
able style that has won him repeat
invitations to "Late Night with
David Lettcrman" gives him al
most immediate rapport with any
audience. If anything, his recent
music, beginning with the LP
"Change of Heart," has a new
friendliness that comes, perhaps,
after twenty years of success in a
tough business.
