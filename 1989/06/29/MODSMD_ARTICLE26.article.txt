Bev uses when she's getting rid of
unwanted facial hair.
Janet comes out of the bathroom
with a large plastic cup that truck
drivers get in convenience stores
when they're parched.
"I am ready when you arc," I say.
"How have you been?"
"Fine," says Janet. "Have a seat."
She starts taking off my last
manicure with a wet, tiny sponge.
"Just relax your hands," she says.

"What will it be today?"
"Just the regular," I say. "Two
coats of number forty-two."
"Arc you sure?" she asks when
she's all done with the remover.
"We just got this new color in,
number fitty-six, and it sure is
popular. Just let me do a thumb,"
she says. "If you don't like it, I'll
take it right off." She stops and
takes another sip of Slimall.
"No thanks," I say. "I don't go
in much for change. I don't even
switch around our furniture. One
time I put the couch where Emmet's
chair usually sets, and when he
came home that night from Casey's,
the house was dark and he took
quite a spill over the coffee table.
No, change comes hard for me."
"Really? I change my furniture
around at least once a month," says
Janet, opening up the bottle of num
ber forty-two. "I've found it's easy
to change the whole appearance of
a room by swapping around the
furniture and adding a few throw
pillows."
"What I've always wondered
about are the pictures," I say. "How
can you move the furniture around
without moving the pictures
around, and if you move the pic
tures around, don't the walls get a
lot of holes in them?"
"I just fill up those holes with
Colgate," Janet says. "Relax your
hands," she reminds me.
As Ellen leaves the shop, Sylvia
comes in and has a scat in front
of Bev. We all say Hello Sylvia and
How are you. She wears these
glasses that arc tinted. They are
somewhere between sun glasses and
seeing glasses. I bet she wears them
to hide her crow's feet. She never
takes them off. Not even at the
movies. I know because Emmet and
I sat down the aisle from her at
the show one time. Sylvia sat
through the whole picture with
them on.
I settle back in my scat and start
making conversation with Janet.
She's clipping off my cuticles and
reminding me that a little vitamin
E oil wouldn't hurt. "Maybe I'll pick
up a bottle later," I tell her. I ask
about her girl, Stacy, who was in
my Mcthial's class last year. Janet
says she's signed her up for dance
classes at Miss Kate's. "How many
kids do you have," I ask. "I have
three step children," she says. She
really emphasizes the step part, too.
"Lord," I say, "1 can hardly make
it with my own two, and they're
my flesh and blood." I laugh a little
so she knows I'm joking. Aftrcr all,
I'm just thankful they're healthy.
"Well," she says,"it wasn't easy
at first. The boy, Justin, he was
really difficult, even a little violent
when we first got married. Frank
said even his own mother couldn't

stand him." "Boy," I say, "maybe he
was just sore that you were taking
his father away from his mother."
"Well, I don't think so," she says.
"Their mother died. Keep relaxing
those hands for mc." "Oh," I say.
"Is it hard living with a man that
has had a whole life with another
woman? I mean, do you ever feel
like a substitute?" I am truly inter
ested by now.
"Heck no," she says. "We sleep
right in the same bed that she slept
in. It might be hard in general, but
Mary, that was Frank's first wife,
she was crazy." And then she
whispers, "mentally insane." "Oh,"
I say. This is getting good, I think
to myself. "How soon did you and
Frank start dating after she passed
on?" I ask. "Well," she says, and
she bends across the table and
lowers her voice so only I can hear.
"We started dating before she died.
We met in Akron," she says. "Oh,
he was separated and everything by
then." "I understand," I say, "of
course."
"Well, I got a call from Frank
about a week after we started dating,
and he told me that Mary had just
called him and she sounded wild,
like she had finally flipped out for
good," Janet says as she keeps paint
ing. "She killed herself that after
noon. Hung herself with the belt
of her bathrobe. I'm just glad the
children weren't with her," Janet
says. "You can be grateful for that,"
1 say. I am a little shocked. I really

am. "That's hard to believe," I say.
"I guess it is," she says, "but every
thing is alright now."
She finishes her Slimall and she
starts putting a stroke of vitamin E
oil on my cuticles. "Lord, your hands
were tense today," she tells me. "1
know, I'm sorry," 1 say. "I have just
been a little nervous lately. I don't
know why." "Do you want any little
decorations today?" she asks me and
she is smiling 'cause 1 know it's her
favorite part. 1 am sorry to disap
point her, but I tell her thank you,
but no. "Nothing fancy for me," 1
say.
I thank Janet and wish her luck
on her diet and 1 mean it. 1 really
do. I pay Bev the five dollars I owe.
I say goodbye to Sylvia. She's sitting
in the La-Z-Boy with pieces of cot
ton between each of her toes.
I hurry to the grocery store and
then home. I have to be there before
the kids get back from school. 1
keep watching my hands as they
steer the wheel, pick out groceries,
and open doors. They look so much
better.
I give the kids some Cheese-Nips
and start supper. I'm trying a new
recipe tonight that I found on a
can of soupâ€”chicken and celery
casserole. I have four cans of soup
'cause they were two for sixty cents
at the Food Fair. When I'm done
mixing everything together and I
have it in the oven, I decide to
make some desert. I mix some red
Jello and a carton of whipping cream

in a bowl and get out the beaters
and hand mixer. I stand there at
the counter-top just staring off into
space.
I can hear the T.V in the next
room. I am thinking up a storm
just standing there. I am thinking
about keeping secrets from Emmet,
and if the red dye in this Jello is
really going to make my kids hyper,
like it said in Redbook last month.
I am thinking about Mary and her
bathrobe. And I am thinking about
how I should have made more of
an effort to speak to Sylvia consid
ering her boy has seizures and is
not quite right.
My mind is speeding around all
kinds of thoughts when 1 hear Em
met's car pull up, and it is a good
thing he pulls up when he does
because the dessert is on its way
to getting rock hard.
"Well, hey Emmet honey," I say.
"How was your day.'"
"Alright," he says.
"Fine. Hope you're hungTy," 1 say,
and I throw my arms around his
neck.
When I do, the light catches my
hands. It's like another woman's
hands are holding on to him. They
are so pretty. Really. I hardly can
believe they're mine.

Kristin Vincent was raised in Mat
thews, North Carolina. A resident of
La Honda for the past year, she is
currently cm the move to Botswana.

I like my hands to look neat and clean. I think it's
important for a girl to keep her hands looking
that way. No long, red, painted nails with lightn
ing bolts on them. I mean, a girl's hands should
look like you could depend on them to feed you
if you got sick or to untie knots if you'd pulled
your shoe string too hard.

I hurry to the grocery store and
then home. I have to be there before
the kids get back from school. 1
keep watching my hands as they
steer the wheel, pick out groceries,
and open doors. They look so much
better.
I give the kids some Cheese-Nips
and start supper. I'm trying a new
recipe tonight that I found on a
can of soupâ€”chicken and celery
casserole. I have four cans of soup
'cause they were two for sixty cents
at the Food Fair. When I'm done
mixing everything together and I
have it in the oven, I decide to
make some desert. I mix some red
Jello and a carton of whipping cream

in a bowl and get out the beaters
and hand mixer. I stand there at
the counter-top just staring off into
space.
I can hear the T.V in the next
room. I am thinking up a storm
just standing there. I am thinking
about keeping secrets from Emmet,
and if the red dye in this Jello is
really going to make my kids hyper,
like it said in Redbook last month.
I am thinking about Mary and her
bathrobe. And I am thinking about
how I should have made more of
an effort to speak to Sylvia consid
ering her boy has seizures and is
not quite right.
My mind is speeding around all
kinds of thoughts when 1 hear Em
met's car pull up, and it is a good
thing he pulls up when he does
because the dessert is on its way
to getting rock hard.
"Well, hey Emmet honey," I say.
"How was your day.'"
"Alright," he says.
"Fine. Hope you're hungTy," 1 say,
and I throw my arms around his
neck.
When I do, the light catches my
hands. It's like another woman's
hands are holding on to him. They
are so pretty. Really. I hardly can
believe they're mine.

Bev uses when she's getting rid of
unwanted facial hair.
Janet comes out of the bathroom
with a large plastic cup that truck
drivers get in convenience stores
when they're parched.
"I am ready when you arc," I say.
"How have you been?"
"Fine," says Janet. "Have a seat."
She starts taking off my last
manicure with a wet, tiny sponge.
"Just relax your hands," she says.

"What will it be today?"
"Just the regular," I say. "Two
coats of number forty-two."
"Arc you sure?" she asks when
she's all done with the remover.
"We just got this new color in,
number fitty-six, and it sure is
popular. Just let me do a thumb,"
she says. "If you don't like it, I'll
take it right off." She stops and
takes another sip of Slimall.
"No thanks," I say. "I don't go
in much for change. I don't even
switch around our furniture. One
time I put the couch where Emmet's
chair usually sets, and when he
came home that night from Casey's,
the house was dark and he took
quite a spill over the coffee table.
No, change comes hard for me."
"Really? I change my furniture
around at least once a month," says
Janet, opening up the bottle of num
ber forty-two. "I've found it's easy
to change the whole appearance of
a room by swapping around the
furniture and adding a few throw
pillows."
"What I've always wondered
about are the pictures," I say. "How
can you move the furniture around
without moving the pictures
around, and if you move the pic
tures around, don't the walls get a
lot of holes in them?"
"I just fill up those holes with
Colgate," Janet says. "Relax your
hands," she reminds me.
As Ellen leaves the shop, Sylvia
comes in and has a scat in front
of Bev. We all say Hello Sylvia and
How are you. She wears these
glasses that arc tinted. They are
somewhere between sun glasses and
seeing glasses. I bet she wears them
to hide her crow's feet. She never
takes them off. Not even at the
movies. I know because Emmet and
I sat down the aisle from her at
the show one time. Sylvia sat
through the whole picture with
them on.
I settle back in my scat and start
making conversation with Janet.
She's clipping off my cuticles and
reminding me that a little vitamin
E oil wouldn't hurt. "Maybe I'll pick
up a bottle later," I tell her. I ask
about her girl, Stacy, who was in
my Mcthial's class last year. Janet
says she's signed her up for dance
classes at Miss Kate's. "How many
kids do you have," I ask. "I have
three step children," she says. She
really emphasizes the step part, too.
"Lord," I say, "1 can hardly make
it with my own two, and they're
my flesh and blood." I laugh a little
so she knows I'm joking. Aftrcr all,
I'm just thankful they're healthy.
"Well," she says,"it wasn't easy
at first. The boy, Justin, he was
really difficult, even a little violent
when we first got married. Frank
said even his own mother couldn't

stand him." "Boy," I say, "maybe he
was just sore that you were taking
his father away from his mother."
"Well, I don't think so," she says.
"Their mother died. Keep relaxing
those hands for mc." "Oh," I say.
"Is it hard living with a man that
has had a whole life with another
woman? I mean, do you ever feel
like a substitute?" I am truly inter
ested by now.
"Heck no," she says. "We sleep
right in the same bed that she slept
in. It might be hard in general, but
Mary, that was Frank's first wife,
she was crazy." And then she
whispers, "mentally insane." "Oh,"
I say. This is getting good, I think
to myself. "How soon did you and
Frank start dating after she passed
on?" I ask. "Well," she says, and
she bends across the table and
lowers her voice so only I can hear.
"We started dating before she died.
We met in Akron," she says. "Oh,
he was separated and everything by
then." "I understand," I say, "of
course."
"Well, I got a call from Frank
about a week after we started dating,
and he told me that Mary had just
called him and she sounded wild,
like she had finally flipped out for
good," Janet says as she keeps paint
ing. "She killed herself that after
noon. Hung herself with the belt
of her bathrobe. I'm just glad the
children weren't with her," Janet
says. "You can be grateful for that,"
1 say. I am a little shocked. I really

am. "That's hard to believe," I say.
"I guess it is," she says, "but every
thing is alright now."
She finishes her Slimall and she
starts putting a stroke of vitamin E
oil on my cuticles. "Lord, your hands
were tense today," she tells me. "1
know, I'm sorry," 1 say. "I have just
been a little nervous lately. I don't
know why." "Do you want any little
decorations today?" she asks me and
she is smiling 'cause 1 know it's her
favorite part. 1 am sorry to disap
point her, but I tell her thank you,
but no. "Nothing fancy for me," 1
say.
I thank Janet and wish her luck
on her diet and 1 mean it. 1 really
do. I pay Bev the five dollars I owe.
I say goodbye to Sylvia. She's sitting
in the La-Z-Boy with pieces of cot
ton between each of her toes.

his father away from his mother."
"Well, I don't think so," she says.
"Their mother died. Keep relaxing
those hands for mc." "Oh," I say.
"Is it hard living with a man that
has had a whole life with another
woman? I mean, do you ever feel
like a substitute?" I am truly inter
ested by now.
"Heck no," she says. "We sleep
right in the same bed that she slept
in. It might be hard in general, but
Mary, that was Frank's first wife,
she was crazy." And then she
whispers, "mentally insane." "Oh,"
I say. This is getting good, I think
to myself. "How soon did you and
Frank start dating after she passed
on?" I ask. "Well," she says, and
she bends across the table and
lowers her voice so only I can hear.
"We started dating before she died.
We met in Akron," she says. "Oh,
he was separated and everything by
then." "I understand," I say, "of
course."
"Well, I got a call from Frank
about a week after we started dating,
and he told me that Mary had just
called him and she sounded wild,
like she had finally flipped out for
good," Janet says as she keeps paint
ing. "She killed herself that after
noon. Hung herself with the belt
of her bathrobe. I'm just glad the
children weren't with her," Janet
says. "You can be grateful for that,"
1 say. I am a little shocked. I really

am. "That's hard to believe," I say.
"I guess it is," she says, "but every
thing is alright now."
She finishes her Slimall and she
starts putting a stroke of vitamin E
oil on my cuticles. "Lord, your hands
were tense today," she tells me. "1
know, I'm sorry," 1 say. "I have just
been a little nervous lately. I don't
know why." "Do you want any little
decorations today?" she asks me and
she is smiling 'cause 1 know it's her
favorite part. 1 am sorry to disap
point her, but I tell her thank you,
but no. "Nothing fancy for me," 1
say.
I thank Janet and wish her luck
on her diet and 1 mean it. 1 really
do. I pay Bev the five dollars I owe.
I say goodbye to Sylvia. She's sitting
in the La-Z-Boy with pieces of cot
ton between each of her toes.
I hurry to the grocery store and
then home. I have to be there before
the kids get back from school. 1
keep watching my hands as they
steer the wheel, pick out groceries,
and open doors. They look so much
better.
I give the kids some Cheese-Nips
and start supper. I'm trying a new
recipe tonight that I found on a
can of soupâ€”chicken and celery
casserole. I have four cans of soup
'cause they were two for sixty cents
at the Food Fair. When I'm done
mixing everything together and I
have it in the oven, I decide to
make some desert. I mix some red
Jello and a carton of whipping cream

in a bowl and get out the beaters
and hand mixer. I stand there at
the counter-top just staring off into
space.
I can hear the T.V in the next
room. I am thinking up a storm
just standing there. I am thinking
about keeping secrets from Emmet,
and if the red dye in this Jello is
really going to make my kids hyper,
like it said in Redbook last month.
I am thinking about Mary and her
bathrobe. And I am thinking about
how I should have made more of
an effort to speak to Sylvia consid
ering her boy has seizures and is
not quite right.
My mind is speeding around all
kinds of thoughts when 1 hear Em
met's car pull up, and it is a good
thing he pulls up when he does
because the dessert is on its way
to getting rock hard.
"Well, hey Emmet honey," I say.
"How was your day.'"
"Alright," he says.
"Fine. Hope you're hungTy," 1 say,
and I throw my arms around his
neck.
When I do, the light catches my
hands. It's like another woman's
hands are holding on to him. They
are so pretty. Really. I hardly can
believe they're mine.

I like my hands to look neat and clean. I think it's
important for a girl to keep her hands looking
that way. No long, red, painted nails with lightn
ing bolts on them. I mean, a girl's hands should
look like you could depend on them to feed you
if you got sick or to untie knots if you'd pulled
your shoe string too hard.
