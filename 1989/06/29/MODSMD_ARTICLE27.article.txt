## Learning democracy Chinese in U.S. take up the Movement 
### Susan McKean Editorial staff 
"There is a real fear of spies,"
according to Ai. "On every major
campus you know there are people
working for the Chinese Commu
nist party who send back regular
reports on who's doing what. In
normal times they are pretty
benign," he says.
"But at a time like this, their
actions are extremely critical.
They collect all sorts of informa
tion about certain individuals, es
pecially those visibly 'corrupted'
by the Western democratic proc
ess. So, when they go home, they
will have a generally tough time.
"The government can really
make your life miserable. Some
students here would face serious
charges and punishment at home
for their actions hereâ€”even up to
death sentences just for testifying
before a Congressional hearing or
protesting in the streets," Ai says.
But despite this fear, Yuan Jiang,
an electrical engineering doctorate
student at Columbia University,
says,"I am determined to do what
I believe and not be stopped by
being scared," echoing statements
made by many students contacted
by The Daily.
But students are taking precau

tionary measures very seriously,
such as avoiding having their pic
tures taken, exchanging large
public meetings for smaller meet
ings with key members and in gen
eral tightly regulating media
exposure.
Additionally, visa problems
loom ahead for some students at
Stanford and across the country.
But very few interviewed for this
article attached much significance
to the visa issue. "It just has not
been their highest priority," says
John Pearson, director of the Bech
tel International Center. The I-
Center handles immigration and
visa matters for overseas students
at Stanford.
Students also emphasized the
danger of losing morale and
stamina.
"Chinese students here might
easily grow frustrated because
there are 1.1 billion people they
have to educate. And they know
they will face masses of people
when they go home, who in tear
or ignorance will rebuff them and
call their appeals for democracy
just U.S. capitalist propaganda,"
Ai says.
After suffering personal emo
tional trauma after the Chinese
events this spring, Jiang, at Co
lumbia, "set up a place for Chinese
students who don't have many

friends to talk with each other....
There is commonly a great feeling
of helplessness and guilt. It's very
hard to witness the murder of
friends and loved ones and not
be able to help or take part with
them in struggle," Jiang said.
He continues, "There's a great
danger that Chinese people will
start thinking it's useless to do
anything. To keep the torch lit,
we need to organize political or
ganizations, opposition parties and
stand firmly against the current
government."
On top of it all, student leaders
here are feeling the pressures of
being students, as research often
gets left undone in the wake of
their activism. Although it is early
to say, some suggest that students
may decide that serious academic
pursuit and commitment to the
American wing of the Chinese de
mocracy movement are mutually
exclusive.
"I hate to say it,"says Eng in
Bostchi, ! think the biggest
obstacle now is that some students
seem like they are losing interest.
I have to keep the shifts covered
here (at the information center)
and it's getting harder and harder.
1 guess it's not very surprising,
students also have to keep up their
studies. But we really need sincere
commitment."
