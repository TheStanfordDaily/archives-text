## Learning democracy Chinese in U.S. take up the Movement 
### Susan McKean Editorial staff 
"There is a real fear of spies,"
according to Ai. "On every major
campus you know there are people
working for the Chinese Commu
nist party who send back regular
reports on who's doing what. In
normal times they are pretty
benign," he says.
"But at a time like this, their
actions are extremely critical.
They collect all sorts of informa
tion about certain individuals, es
pecially those visibly 'corrupted'
by the Western democratic proc
ess. So, when they go home, they
will have a generally tough time.
"The government can really
make your life miserable. Some
students here would face serious
charges and punishment at home
for their actions here—even up to
death sentences just for testifying
before a Congressional hearing or
protesting in the streets," Ai says.
But despite this fear, Yuan Jiang,
an electrical engineering doctorate
student at Columbia University,
says,"I am determined to do what
I believe and not be stopped by
being scared," echoing statements
made by many students contacted
by The Daily.
But students are taking precau

tionary measures very seriously,
such as avoiding having their pic
tures taken, exchanging large
public meetings for smaller meet
ings with key members and in gen
eral tightly regulating media
exposure.
Additionally, visa problems
loom ahead for some students at
Stanford and across the country.
But very few interviewed for this
article attached much significance
to the visa issue. "It just has not
been their highest priority," says
John Pearson, director of the Bech
tel International Center. The I-
Center handles immigration and
visa matters for overseas students
at Stanford.
Students also emphasized the
danger of losing morale and
stamina.
"Chinese students here might
easily grow frustrated because
there are 1.1 billion people they
have to educate. And they know
they will face masses of people
when they go home, who in tear
or ignorance will rebuff them and
call their appeals for democracy
just U.S. capitalist propaganda,"
Ai says.
After suffering personal emo
tional trauma after the Chinese
events this spring, Jiang, at Co
lumbia, "set up a place for Chinese
students who don't have many

friends to talk with each other....
There is commonly a great feeling
of helplessness and guilt. It's very
hard to witness the murder of
friends and loved ones and not
be able to help or take part with
them in struggle," Jiang said.
He continues, "There's a great
danger that Chinese people will
start thinking it's useless to do
anything. To keep the torch lit,
we need to organize political or
ganizations, opposition parties and
stand firmly against the current
government."
On top of it all, student leaders
here are feeling the pressures of
being students, as research often
gets left undone in the wake of
their activism. Although it is early
to say, some suggest that students
may decide that serious academic
pursuit and commitment to the
American wing of the Chinese de
mocracy movement are mutually
exclusive.
"I hate to say it,"says Eng in
Bostchi, ! think the biggest
obstacle now is that some students
seem like they are losing interest.
I have to keep the shifts covered
here (at the information center)
and it's getting harder and harder.
1 guess it's not very surprising,
students also have to keep up their
studies. But we really need sincere
commitment."
Once there was an ant hill with one billion ants.
One day their hill caught fire. The ants realized they
had to stop the fire in order to save themselves. So,
some of the ants held together and rolled towards
the fire. Those on the outer edge were burned to
death, but the rest of the ants lived.

Chai Ling told this old tale to
thousands in Tiananmen Square
the night of the June 4 massacre
in Beijing.
"Fellow students, we are on the
square, we arc standing on the
outer edge of our people," contin
ued Ling, a 23-year-old student
leader of the Patriotic Democracy
Movement now hiding from the
Chinese government.
While the Tiananmen Square
demonstrators struggle on the edge
of Chinese society to roll the
country toward more democratic
governance, Chinese students and
scholars in America are scrambling
to take their own places as distant
guardians of the movement.
With Stanford as one of the
leading centers of such activity,
these expatriates are forging
tightly-controlled organizations on
university campuses nationwide.
Still stung by the events in
China this spring, the Chinese
community at Stanford is just now
beginning to get back to studies
and work after weeks overflowing
with tears, misinformation, fax
communication, computer net
working and blocked phone lines.
But, their work for the Chinese
democracy movement has not let
up; instead, they have streamlined
and organized it for the long term.
Keeping it alive
Many students see themselves
as dutiful and privileged emissaries
of the Chinese student movement.
They claim that they are keeping
that movement alive and directing
its course toward democratic
reform.
However, others say overseas
Chinese students will play only a
limited role in the movement.
And on the opposite end of the
spectrum, some radical talk circu
lates about the formation of a Chi
nese opposition party based in the
United States.
In the past month, Chinese
scholars at Stanford have sent
news and money back to China
in answer to the greatest needs
they saw: medical aid and truthful
information.
As the Chinese government
crackdown continues, the transfer
of both money and information
grows more difficult and danger
ous. But keeping in step, the Chi
nese student organizations have
matured into tight, ambitious
groups.
According to Mo Eng, a math
ematics graduate student at Bran
deis University in Boston, the role
of the Chinese students in the
United States has become "more
and more important.
"It's true that it will be very
hard to maintain the movement
in China," he says. "What we have
to do here is keep it alive. It's a
movement that must not die, and
will be helped by the formation
of a pan-American autonomous
students' association, which there
has been nothing like ever before."
Representatives of the Chinese
student community contacted by
The Daily generally emphasized
the importance of uniting to sup

port the Chinese student move
ment and taking advantage of their
position here to learn and practice
democracy so as to bring it to
China in the future.
Yong-Chuan Liu is a Stanford
graduate student in sociology who
took part in the Beijing protests
in May while he was there con
ducting research for his disserta
tion. Liu believes that Chinese
students in America play a critical
role for the Chinese student move
ment.
"When (students in China)
know 40,0(30 students in America
are supporting and working for
them, they know they've got a lot
of power," he says."In the long
run, U.S. students will have great
impact on developments in
China."
Along with learning to under
stand the institutions and prin
ciples of democracy celebrated in
America, David Ai, a project man
ager at Hewlett-Packard, says Chi
nese students here need to
examine "certain features in the
Chinese culture that might not
help democratic development."
"For example," says Ai, "by na
ture the Chinese accept a more
authoritarian society with
hierarchical social structures. They
are brought up knowing when to
shut up, raised not to be leaders
but followers, and taught to obey
their parents. There are some very
deep patterns impeding democracy
there.
"Chinese students in America
can bring back seeds of new think
ing into China and Chinese cul
ture. When people take for
granted that they have the right
to fight for their own rights, then
we have succeeded."
Many Chinese students concUr
that the demonstrations this spring
indicate this empowerment is be
ginning to take hold in China.
"In the beginning, students saw
democracy as a concept, as an
idea," says Jun Li, a mechanical
engineering graduate student. "We
didn't realize the importance of
institutional democracy. That's
what people are now fighting for
— freedom of assembly and a free
press, governmental checks and
balances.
"I love my country and I want
my country to be as good as any
country. That's why I came (to
America) — to learn so I can
help China catch up with the de

vclopcd countries," Li says.
Distanced from the Chinese
government's current purge of dis
sidents, students here need to stop,
think and engage in theoretical
preparation for a sustained move
ment, Liu says.
Within Ctfina, students cannot
thoughtfully -.launch a strong at
oration, inequality
and limited freedom, he says.
Jane Zu, a Faculty Club waiter
who was an associate professor of
journalism in China, underlines
the desperate need for a free press
in China. "All students hope that
after they graduate as a journalist
they will be able to tell people
the truth, but they cannot. You
can't tell the truth, you can't tell
people what you see, what you
find out or what you think about
it."
But a University of Chicago
chemistry graduate student who
wishes to remain anonymous
doesn't think there is much the
students here can do for their
homeland except collect donations
and look out for themselves. Me
is skeptical of politically active or
ganizations and says he would not
want to be associated with any
because it would be "too danger

be very hard to
maintain the
movement in China.
What we have to do
here is keep it
alive.'
— Mo Eng

ous."
"We're not professional politi
cians — we're just students," he
says.
Nonetheless, despite dangers of
blacklists, visa difficulties and spy
activity, most Chinese students at
Stanford say they have hardly been
concerned for their own plight
during the last few months.
"Everybody feels responsible for
helping our country, and we're
really not too worried about our
selves now," says Zu.
One highly-publicized way the
students have been channeling
their concern is through fundrais
ing efforts. Since the Tiananmen
Square massacre, students at Stan
ford have created the June Fourth
Foundation. The foundation has

raised more than $120,000, which
is being held here until it can be
distributed safely in China.
Before the massacre, the Asso
ciation of Chinese Students and
Scholars at Stanford sent $10,000
worth of donations back to China
for medical relief and operational
costs incurred by the student
movement.
Ai, who recently founded a Bay
Area group called Support Democ
racy in China, says fundraising
must be carefully meted out and
thought through. "I'm a little
against activities designed just to
raise funds but do not relate to
helping people in China. If people
have shown emotional support, as
they have, we do not need to go
back to them three or four times
for monetary help. The local
groups have certainly matured in
that respect during the past few
weeks," he says.
'Phenomenal impact'
According to Ai, the events this
spring have had "a phenomenal
impact on the Chinese community
in the Bay Area. People here arc
even changing their attitude
toward a radical approach of cam
paigning against the Chinese gov
ernment."
Although there is some disa
greement about the degree of unity
among the Stanford Chinese com
munity before this spring, students
overwhelmingly note the strong
support and organization that has
developed in recent weeks.
"We discovered each other and
our shared feeling for our country
suddenly. We hadn't ever had the
chance to practice democratic
principles, but we have have been
learning to exercise them in the
process of organizing ACSSS and
the June Fourth Foundation," says
Huang.
These democratic principles of
organization are being followed
nationwide, as layers of Chinese
associations emerge. Most students
advocate local organization, linked
by intricate and extensive systems
of communication using computer
networks, fax machines and tele
phone trees.
Liu is the temporary coordinator
for the newly founded United As
sociation of Chinese Students and
Scholars in California, which is
based at Stanford with branches
at universities statewide.
He advocates the creation of a
nationwide network of associa
tions. Others, however, doubt the
effectiveness of such a network,
and some say it would be down
right dangerous and impractical.
Doug Pan, a graduate student
in sociology, suspects that a large,
national organization may prove
too unwieldy. "Coordination be
tween campuses may be very in
efficient. The larger the group, the
harder to manage it without hur
ting or alienating people."
Although some Chinese ac
tivists in America have started to
form an opposition party, Pan says
he docs not advocate this. He
envisions the community of Chi
nese scholars in America as an
alternative voice in the reform ot
the Chinese government.
Of course, he says, this would
not be possible under the present
military government, but "certainly
in the future this alternative voice
from Chinese students and schol
ars abroad will be heard in our
country."
As yet there is no national
leader of the Chinese students in
America. According to Eng, who
docs support the eventual creation
of a national organization, "no one
is supposed to say he is the leader
right now. It would be no good
if one person were to declare him
self in charge of a democratic
movement. First, everyone must
agree to forming the organization,

and then vote on a leader for it.
That's the process."
But it's certainly not clear that
most Chinese in America would
agree to such centralized, national
leadership.
Jian Gang Dai, mathematics
graduate student and network co
ordinator for ACSSS, strongly
opposes the creation of a' national
organization that would represent
Chinese students in the United
States, and calls for continued
regional associations.
"It would now be inappropriate
to have a national organization
operating above universities to
issue commands and orders to lo
cal groups. Rather, we are rightly
establishing a coordinating associ
ation" that facilitates information
How and efficient communication,
but does not "force this university
or that university to do this or
that."
Reform or revolution?
The student groups generally,
according to sources contacted by
The Daily, do not seek to over
throw the Chinese government or
fight the Communist party struc
ture.
Nonetheless, one of the pitfalls
that the Chinese community here
is watching for is the degeneration
of unity through differences of op

inion. "Some people are more po
litically oriented, some are
interested in forming a party, some
just want to supply relief aid," says
Pan. "It's tricky, it's a question of
how to unite with as many people
as possible, but not compromise
efficiency and the ability to get
things done. I can see how people
will really disagree on the approach
Chinese in America should take
in helping out our country."
Hseng-Yu Huang, a Berkeley
chemistry graduate student, says
he already sees a split between
those here who would like to scrap
the Communist Party regime en
tirely and those who advocate in
ternal reform within the party.
Liu, for instance, says he thinks
there was a chance for reforms,
but that radical action is now in
evitable. "Students at first didn't
ask to throw out the political fig
ures, or to end the communist
system. If at the beginning the
government had talked with the
students, the system would have
been maintained with slight re
forms. It's too late for that now."
A 'real fear of spies'
Several other obstacles, aside
from dissent within the commu
nity, face the American represen
tatives of the Chinese democracy
movement as well.
One particularly delicate and
threatening problem is the issue
of spies within the Chinese com
munities.
