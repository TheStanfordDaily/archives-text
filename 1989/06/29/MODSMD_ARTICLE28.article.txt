## A 						history of everyday objects Take a sip: a corporate genealogy of orange juice 
### Mark Weiner Editorial staff 
Editor's note:
When we are young, we drink
water from a tap as if it's water
from a rock: as if the water just
magically appears, as if the tap is
the ultimate source of the liquid we
are drinking.
S(xm, we come to understand that
water comes from the earth, not from
the kitchen sink, and sometimes, we
joke about our limited juvenile vision.
Hut how often do we repeat this
childhood perceptual error in adult
hood? How often do u»e emphry an
object of day-to-day use without con
sidering its history, without under
standing its place within a web and
chiiin of social relations?
This occasional series will attempt
to surround common objects with the
history that created them, the history
that nonetheless is lost in the process
of marketing and consumption in a
mass society.
There are many perspectives from
which one could write a history of
everyday objects. Each of them con
tains its own unique set of questions.
This series, a work-in-progress, will
examine only some of those questions.
It is not intended to be comprehensive.
The first object of study: a one-pint
container of Foster Farms Orange
Juice bought at The Store.
Watch for future histories of a
No. 2 pencil, a tube of Crest tooth
paste and a Coffee House sandwich.
What is the history of a Foster
Farms Orange Juice? What is its
ultimate destination?
To find out, I first called Foster
Farms Dairy, located in Modesto,
Calif. Foster Farms is an actual
working milk dairy, with three of
the top producing dairies of
Modesto county. It entered the
orange juice business because both
orange juice and milk require a
similar process of pasteurization
and refrigeration.
Barely audible over the noise of
humming machines, Foster Farms
Plant Manager Larry Diggory
separated his orange juice product
into three component parts — the
container, the actual orange juice
and the label.
According to Diggory, Foster
Farms presses its polypropylene
containers on site in Modesto with
resins from Soltex Polymer, Corp.
of Houston, Texas and receives
its juice concentrate from Caulkins
Indiantown Citrus, of Indiantown,
Fla. He said Foster Farms pur
chases its labels from Lord Label,
of Annaheim, Calif.
Dan Rosenthal, who works in
Soltex Polymer Corp.'s product de
velopment division, stated that
Soltex ships Foster Farms its
polypropylene resin in the form of
small pellets the size of birdseed.
Rosenthal said he was unauthor
ized to say from where Soltex
receives the propylene gas with
which it manufactures such resins.
He suggested, however, that Sol
tex purchases propylene, a crude
oil by-product, from Exxon, Corp.
Library research revealed that
Soltex Polymer is a subsidiary of
Solvay America, Inc., of Houston,
Texas, which is in turn a subsidiary
of Solvay & CIE, S.A. of Brussels,
Belgium. Solvay & CIE, S.A. is
one of the top multi-national com
panies of Europe.
Caulkins Indiantown Citrus is
the processing plant corporately
associated with the groves of VIA

Tropical Fruit and Caulkins, also
located in Indiantown. Both are
subsidiaries of VIA North
America, Inc., of Delaware. VIA
North America is a subsidiary of
Campagne Navigation Mixte, of
Paris.
Caulkins owns four orange
groves and treats them with fer
tilizer obtained in part from
Howard Fertilizer, Co. of Orlando,
Fla. Howard Fertilizer receives its
manure salts from as diverse a
group of nations as Israel, Canada
and Spain.
According to receptionist Bobbi
Royster, Caulkin's oranges arc of
ten picked by migrant workers
from Mexico and Guatamala.

Adult workers throw oranges onto
the ground, while their children
carry them to 100 gallon tubs
Workers can till approximately one
tub each half-hour, according to
Royster, who once worked in the
fields. They recieve approximately
$2.50 per tub of oranges picked.
"You make gocxJ money," said
Royster, "but you have to work
fast."
Caulkin separates its oranges
into various component parts,
such as peels, leaves and pulp. No
part of the orange is wasted.
According to David Bowcn, as
sistant to the president at Caulkin,
one orange processing by-product,
the oil D'Limoncne, is sold to

chcmical companies for the pro
duction of chcmical resins used in
part to make correlated shipping
cartons. Many of the other by
products of such processing arc
used to make cow feed.
After a Foster Farms Orange
Juice lands in a Tresidder Union
garbage can, it is taken to a com
pactor between Tresidder and the
Engineering machine shops, ac
cording to Louis Pellegrini, Gen
eral Manager of Pcnninsula
Sanitary. There, with 60 loose
cubic yards of garbage, it is com
pressed at a one-to-four compac
tion ratio.
On Tuesdays and Fridays, Pen
ninsula Sanitary empties those

compactors, driving the
compressed garbage down El
Camino and the Oregon Express
way about one hour to the Talo
Alto City landfill. Located at the
end of Embarcadero, at the toot
of the Bay, the landfill will accept
Stanford University garbage until
April 1991. j i
