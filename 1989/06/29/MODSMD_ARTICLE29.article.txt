## Chinese scientists at Stanford face added anxiety 
### Tanya Paull Editorial staff 
Stanford Geology Prof. Juhn
Liou may be one of very few
travelers going to mainland China
this summer. Unlike many of his
Chinese contemporaries trying to
vacate the country beseiged by vi
olence and turmoil in the past
month, Liou and others in his
research group may have to return
to China on short notice in order
to maintain their research ties with
geologists there.
While many Chinese people in
America have been affected by
the Tiananmen Square massacre
and the ensuing propaganda cam
paign by the Chinese government,
some Chinese scientists in
America feel uncertainty and ap
prehension on two counts — not
only their personal connections,
but also their research tics are
threatened by the events in China.
Liou is part of a group of stu
dents and faculty in the School
of Earth Sciences whose members
periodically visit China to con
tinue their research. Due to the
mass killing of students and protes
tors in Beijing, however, this sum
mer's visit has been postponed in
definitely.
The major mission of the project
was to look for oil, gas, ore deposits
and changes in the evolution of
the continent. The researchers
usually don't consider political
boundaries in their studies of
global geology, but "if the Chinese
students are endangering their
lives or their return to Stanford
then we don't take any risk," Liou
explained. Three of the 10 students
originally set to go on the visit
are from mainland China and have
families there.
One of the harsh possibilities
facing the group now is that both
sides — American and Chinese
— may lose their funding if the
collaboration does not continue.
Because of this, Liou and other
members of the group who do not
have close relatives in the troubled
country may have to go to China
to prove their interest in the proj
ect.
According to Liou, their col
leagues in China are still very anx
ious to continue the exchange.
How much they have heard about
the actual events in Tiananmen

Square, however, is not known.
In China phones arc being tapped
and even fax machines are now
being guarded by government of
ficials, says one Chinese graduate
student who asked not to be iden
tified because he has relatives in
China.
One researcher at Stanford not
worried by government interven
tion is Visiting Physics Prof. Hu
En Ke, an associate professor of
physics from Zhongshan Univer
sity in China, who supports the
actions of his government.

machines are now

government
officials.

Democracy, he says, is a good
system and eventually should be
favorable for China, but steps
toward democracy should be taken
slowly, not all at once. The crucial
mistake the Chinese government
made, in En Ke's opinion, was not
talking to the Chinese students at
the start of the protest movement.
When the students increased
enough in number, publicity and
strength to perhaps cause an over
throw in the government, Com
munist leaders were justified in
their actions because of the threat
the movement posed to the exist
ing regime, En Ke says.
People often make the mistake,
he explains, of not considering
China's history and economic
structure. Democracy will not
work for China in the same way
it does for the United States be
cause of China's large population
and the low economic status of
many of its people. China is strong
when its central government is
strong, En Ke says, which for now
can only come about under the
control of the Communist Party.
In his opinion, if the govern
ment had not subdued the protest
movement when they did, thou
sands or even 1 millions could have

been killed instead of the hundreds
reported by Chinese officials.
En Ke doesn't think his joint
project with Stanford's physics de
partment will be affected very
much by the recent turmqjl in his
home country. The two research
groups — one headed by En Ke
at Zhongshan University and the
other by Assistant Prof, of Physics
Peter Michelson at Stanford —
have been collaborating and ex
changing scientists since 1983.

equivalent Chinese organization
are funding the joint project.
"The situation between the two
countries is now a little difficult,"
En Ke says, "but only temporary."

a friendly relationship between the

gineering, and Xiaohua Huang, re
search associate in chemistry, op
pose the actions of the Chinese
government and are doubtful they
will ever return to their home
country. Both are applying for per
manent United States visas.
Gao, a Harvard graduate who
first came to the United States in
1983, does not work jointly with
Chinese scientists but still has
many personal and professional
contacts there. Like Huang, he
had once hoped to return to China
to pass on some of the knowledge
and experience he gained in the
United States. Now that the po
litical situation looks so bleak,
however, both scientists have
realized they probably will never
be able to work or live in China
again.

Not only would he be extremely
depressed living in a Communist
society, but Gao's expertise in frac
ture mechanics would not be of
much use in China because of the
lack of technological resources and
capabilities there, he explains.
For both of the researchers, pa
triotism to China is steadily being
outweighed by the attractiveness
of life in the United States and
the opportunities for scientific re
search available to them here.
While American scientific as
sociations like the National Sci
ence Foundation and the National
Academy of Sciences denounce
the actions of the Chinese gov
ernment, thousands of Chinese
scientists and scholars in America
look on with shock and helpless
ness as relatives and colleagues in
China are faced with increasing
conflict and possible isolation.
Some, like Liou, are outraged
by the recent events, while others
like En Ke cling to the beliefs of
the traditional Chinese Commu
nist Tarty, but none remains un
touched by the killings in Tianan
men Square and the suppressed
struggle for democracy.

country. Both are applying for per
manent United States visas.
Gao, a Harvard graduate who
first came to the United States in
1983, does not work jointly with
Chinese scientists but still has
many personal and professional
contacts there. Like Huang, he
had once hoped to return to China
to pass on some of the knowledge
and experience he gained in the
United States. Now that the po
litical situation looks so bleak,
however, both scientists have
realized they probably will never
be able to work or live in China
again.

Not only would he be extremely
depressed living in a Communist
society, but Gao's expertise in frac
ture mechanics would not be of
much use in China because of the
lack of technological resources and
capabilities there, he explains.
For both of the researchers, pa
triotism to China is steadily being
outweighed by the attractiveness
of life in the United States and
the opportunities for scientific re
search available to them here.
While American scientific as
sociations like the National Sci
ence Foundation and the National
Academy of Sciences denounce
the actions of the Chinese gov
ernment, thousands of Chinese
scientists and scholars in America
look on with shock and helpless
ness as relatives and colleagues in
China are faced with increasing
conflict and possible isolation.
Some, like Liou, are outraged
by the recent events, while others
like En Ke cling to the beliefs of
the traditional Chinese Commu
nist Tarty, but none remains un
touched by the killings in Tianan
men Square and the suppressed
struggle for democracy.

Stanford Geology Prof. Juhn
Liou may be one of very few
travelers going to mainland China
this summer. Unlike many of his
Chinese contemporaries trying to
vacate the country beseiged by vi
olence and turmoil in the past
month, Liou and others in his
research group may have to return
to China on short notice in order
to maintain their research ties with
geologists there.
While many Chinese people in
America have been affected by
the Tiananmen Square massacre
and the ensuing propaganda cam
paign by the Chinese government,
some Chinese scientists in
America feel uncertainty and ap
prehension on two counts — not
only their personal connections,
but also their research tics are
threatened by the events in China.
Liou is part of a group of stu
dents and faculty in the School
of Earth Sciences whose members
periodically visit China to con
tinue their research. Due to the
mass killing of students and protes
tors in Beijing, however, this sum
mer's visit has been postponed in
definitely.
The major mission of the project
was to look for oil, gas, ore deposits
and changes in the evolution of
the continent. The researchers
usually don't consider political
boundaries in their studies of
global geology, but "if the Chinese
students are endangering their
lives or their return to Stanford
then we don't take any risk," Liou
explained. Three of the 10 students
originally set to go on the visit
are from mainland China and have
families there.
One of the harsh possibilities
facing the group now is that both
sides — American and Chinese
— may lose their funding if the
collaboration does not continue.
Because of this, Liou and other
members of the group who do not
have close relatives in the troubled
country may have to go to China
to prove their interest in the proj
ect.
According to Liou, their col
leagues in China are still very anx
ious to continue the exchange.
How much they have heard about
the actual events in Tiananmen

Square, however, is not known.
In China phones arc being tapped
and even fax machines are now
being guarded by government of
ficials, says one Chinese graduate
student who asked not to be iden
tified because he has relatives in
China.
One researcher at Stanford not
worried by government interven
tion is Visiting Physics Prof. Hu
En Ke, an associate professor of
physics from Zhongshan Univer
sity in China, who supports the
actions of his government.

Democracy, he says, is a good
system and eventually should be
favorable for China, but steps
toward democracy should be taken
slowly, not all at once. The crucial
mistake the Chinese government
made, in En Ke's opinion, was not
talking to the Chinese students at
the start of the protest movement.
When the students increased
enough in number, publicity and
strength to perhaps cause an over
throw in the government, Com
munist leaders were justified in
their actions because of the threat
the movement posed to the exist
ing regime, En Ke says.
People often make the mistake,
he explains, of not considering
China's history and economic
structure. Democracy will not
work for China in the same way
it does for the United States be
cause of China's large population
and the low economic status of
many of its people. China is strong
when its central government is
strong, En Ke says, which for now
can only come about under the
control of the Communist Party.
In his opinion, if the govern
ment had not subdued the protest
movement when they did, thou
sands or even 1 millions could have

been killed instead of the hundreds
reported by Chinese officials.
En Ke doesn't think his joint
project with Stanford's physics de
partment will be affected very
much by the recent turmqjl in his
home country. The two research
groups — one headed by En Ke
