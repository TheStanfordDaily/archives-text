# A 						WEATHER REPORT

All day the heat had been barely supportable, but at evening a breeze arose in the west, blowing
from the heart of the setting sun and from the ocean, which lay unseen, unheard behind the scrubby
foothills. It shook the rusty fingers of palm-leaf and swelled the dry sounds of summer, the frog-voices,
the grating cicadas and the ever present pulse of music from the neighboring native huts.
