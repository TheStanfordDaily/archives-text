## Golden Nugget Lichti drafted by Denver; 15th pick in first round 
### Mark Rogowsky Editorial staff 
CONCORD — At the start of
the next NBA season, Todd
Lichti's standing vertical jump will
be 5282 feet 7 inches when mea
sured from sea level.
No, he's not Superman. But he
will be playing in Denver, the Mile
High City and — as Lichti tells
it — he can jump 31 inches.
Straight up. Without a running
start.
The promise of Lichti's spectac
ular college career — one in which
he rewrote the Stanford and
Pacific 10 Conference record books
— was fulfilled Tuesday when the
Nuggets made him their first
round selection.
He was the 15th player — and
the fifth guard — selected.
"1 think I'll fit in well there,"
Lichti said during a press confer
ence held at the Legends' Sports
Bar in Concord. "It's been a pretty
good day. I'm happy that it's over
with."
But what about playing for the
Nuggets, Todd?
"If any offense is wide open in
the NBA, it's Denver's. It'll really
help me," he said. The Nuggets
fast-paced scheme is the brainchild
of Coach Doug Moe. It's the style

of play scouts felt would allow
Lichti to put up even better num
bers than he produced in college.
The fact that Lichti wound up
with Coach "Moe-tion" was some
thing of a surprise. Pre-draft
speculation had the 6-foot-4 guard
headed for the expansion Minne
sota Timberwolves (picking 10th)
or the Boston Celtics (13th).
Instead, Lichti slipped back to
No. 15 and it clearly dampened
his enthusiasm a bit. "I think I'll
have a better career than a couple
of the people who were picked
ahead of me," said a confident
Lichti without mentioning anyone
in particular. "I just feel [some of
them| aren't going to do real well
in the NBA."
The normally reserved Lichti
had more to say about where he
was selected. "When 1 walk
through airports, people don't
think I'm a basketball player," he
noted. "People say maybe a 205-
pound white guy can't do it."
Lichti was quick to diffuse any
racial controversy, however, and
apologized for making a remark
he realized could be misconstrued.
Clearly, the subject was basket
ball and Lichti seemed recovered
from the disappointment of the
NCAA tournament and ready to
go-

He said he was going to spend
the summer working on his ball
handling and shooting. Lichti
hopes to show the Nuggets that
he can play some point guard for
them and get a chance to run the
offense part time. Former Stanford
Coach Tom Davis was planning
on converting Lichti to a point
guard before his sophomore year.
Instead, Davis left the Farm for
the farm lands of lowa and Coach
Mike Montgomery kept Lichti at
shooting guard.
Lichti said he hadn't met Moe
yet and "doesn't know what to
expect."
"They say he's going to yell at
you in front of crowds ... be ver
bal," Lichti said. "[l'm going to)
learn not to take it personally.
"From what I hear, he's going
to get on everybody at some point.
I'm sure he'll push me."
Lichti added, though, that Moe
could scream at you during a game
and then join you for dinner af
terwards.
Denver General Manager Pete
Babcock told Lichti he would be

serve as the backup to Michael
Adams and be the third guard
overall for the Nuggets.
Card notes
The selection of Lichti means that
a Stanford player has been drafted in
two consecutive years. Last June, the
New York Knicks selected Greg But
ler in the second round.
Howard Wright, a classmate of
Lichti's and also one of the top players
in Stanford history, wasn't selected in
the draft. "I'm a little numb and
stunned," Wright told the Peninsula
Times Tribune. "A lot of guys are in
the same boat I'm in. Now it's a
matter of sitting back and seeing what
options are available.
"It all comes down to someone's
opinion of you," he said. "Do I think
1 can play in the NBA.' Yes." Wright
is free to try out with any team and
will certainly be given a chance to
make it.
Finally, Eric Reveno, another mem
ber of the senior six, has been offered
a tryout with Denver. If he sticks, he
will be reunited with Lichti.
