## Fendick, Burgin, Mayotte, Rostagno and McEnroe all winners; Graham, McGrath, Grabb fall 
### Mark Rogowsky Editorial staff 
Dan Goldie, winner of the 1986 NCAA
singles championship in his senior year at
Stanford, scored his biggest victory as a pro
fessional by defeating Jimmy Connors in a
second-round match Wednesday at
Wimbledon.
Goldie's 7-6, 5-7, 6-4, 6-2 victory sent Con
nors packing that early for only the third time
since his Wimbledon debut in 1971. It was
undoubtedly the biggest upset of the tourna
ment's first three days.
Though Connors came out on top in their
two previous meetings, Goldie saved a number
of break points this time to secure the win
— and perhaps push Connors into retirement.
"He's still a very good player," Goldie said.
"He's still very fast. He doesn't play like a
36-year-old."
• Goldie, currently ranked 47th in the world,
advanced to the second round after slipping

past Kelly Everden 7-6, 7-6, 3-6, 6-0.
His former teammate, Jim Grabb, didn't fare
as well. Grabb was bested by Javier Frana 6-7,
6-3, 7-6, 5-7, 6-4. Derrick Rostagno, however,
won his first-round match taking out Simon
Youl 7-6, 6-4, 6-4.
Tim Mayotte also scored a straight-set vic
tory by beating Paolo Cane 7-6, 6-0, 6-1. And,
the most famous pro to come out of the
Stanford tennis factory, John McEnroe, came
back from two sets down for the first time in
his illustrious career to beat Daren Cahill 4-6,
4-6, 6-2, 6-3, 8-6.
On the women's side, the legendary Patty
Fendick was strong despite playing in only her
second tournament after a long layoff. She
took out Jill Smoller 6-3, 7-5.
Sophomore Debbie Graham couldn't
withstand Carrie Cunningham as she fell by
a 6-4, 6-4 score. Meredith McGrath, a highly
touted incoming freshman, was defeated by a
more experienced Hu Na, 6-4, 6-1.
Alum Elisc Burgin got by Elly Hakami in
three sets, 6-4, 3-6, 6-2.
