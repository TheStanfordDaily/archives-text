# Trustees approve new dorm
## Hasta la vista, Manzanita? 
### Bob Michitarian Editorial staff 
There are no blueprints and
there's not yet enough money,
but the University has never
been closer to replacing some of
the Manzanita trailers with per
manent student housing.
In its meeting this month, the
Board of Trustees approved "the
concept" of sacking 20 of the
116 trailers and building a 200-
person dormitory near Branner
Hall.
The Manzanita trailers were
installed in 1969 as "temporary
emergency" housing and, accord
ing to a board resolution, were
intended to be removed in "three
to five years." They celebrate
their 20th anniversary this fall.
But in nearly 20 years of dis
cussion about replacing Manzan
ita, plans have never received

conceptual approval from the
board, as they did this month.
And never before have indi
vidual trustees given their own
money to build student housing.
The 200-unit dorm will cost $10
million to build, but at the last
meeting, two anonymous trus
tees donated $2 million each.
Trustee Roy Anderson, the
retired chairman of Lockhecd,
Corp., also reaffirmed .he will
match dollar-for-dollar the funds
donated by members of this
year's graduating class, who've
set their goal at $50,000.
That leaves $6 million. The
University can borrow a maxi
mum of $3 million without forc
ing huge increases in tuition,
rent and board rates. The Office
of Development, Stanford's
fund-raising arm, is trying to
raise the other $3 million by the
end of the summer, and already

has pledges — many from other
trustees — for more than half
that amount.
"We have every expectation
that we'll be successful raising
the money," said Sally Randel,
director of major gifts. "But con
sidering the history of this type
of project, we don't want to take
it for granted."
"Several trustees have already
come in, and I suspect that the
majority of the money will prob
ably come from them," she said.
"They're very interested in the
project and very supportive."
The trustees have optimistic
ally scheduled construction on
the new complex to begin after
Commencement 1990 and open
at the beginning of the 1991
school year.
Rut the trailers were supposed
to come and go within few years,
too.
