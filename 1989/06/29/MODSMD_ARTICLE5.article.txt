The University has looked in
ward and found Associate Dean
of Graduate Studies Cecilia Bur
ciaga to serve as acting associate
provost and affirmative action of
ficer for 1989-90, University Pres
ident Donald Kennedy announced
June 7.
Citing her long involvement
with Stanford and its efforts to

create a multi-cultural environ
ment, University officials looked
to Burciaga, a Hispanic women
who is well-versed in the issues
facing minorities, to provide lead
ership Â«in the implementation of
the University Committee's report
released earlier this year.
This year's upheavals, beginning
with the Ujamaa incident, raised
racial tensions and brought Stan
ford into the national spotlight.
Burciaga said she sees next year

as pivotal for minorities at Stan
ford.
"It will be an opportunity for
concrete implementation" of
changes proposed by the UCMI,
"and a time to heal wounds," Bur
ciaga said.
She wants to extend discussion
beyond issues of race and has plans
to raise issues of gender, sexual
preference and handicapped status
