# Burciaga to oversee UCMI reforms
## 
### Robert Landon Staff writer 
The University has looked in
ward and found Associate Dean
of Graduate Studies Cecilia Bur
ciaga to serve as acting associate
provost and affirmative action of
ficer for 1989-90, University Pres
ident Donald Kennedy announced
June 7.
Citing her long involvement
with Stanford and its efforts to

create a multi-cultural environ
ment, University officials looked
to Burciaga, a Hispanic women
who is well-versed in the issues
facing minorities, to provide lead
ership Â«in the implementation of
the University Committee's report
released earlier this year.
This year's upheavals, beginning
with the Ujamaa incident, raised
racial tensions and brought Stan
ford into the national spotlight.
Burciaga said she sees next year

as pivotal for minorities at Stan
ford.
"It will be an opportunity for
concrete implementation" of
changes proposed by the UCMI,
"and a time to heal wounds," Bur
ciaga said.
She wants to extend discussion
beyond issues of race and has plans
to raise issues of gender, sexual
preference and handicapped status
as well, she said.
"I am delighted that Cecilia has
stepped into this important Uni
versity position," said Kennedy.
"Because next year is the first post-
UCMI year, we have a particularly
challenging set of institutional
tasks. Cecilia knows Stanford as
only a 15-year insider can, and
that knowledge will be a great
resource in this position."

Burciaga is well-versed in Stan
ford's institutional strengths and
weaknesses and the needs of its
minority faculty, students and
staff.
She was intimately involved in
the long-awaited UCMI report
which came out last spring. And
as associate dean of graduate
studies, she has been responsible
for recruitment and retention of
women and minorities and served
as an advocate for all kinds of
problems graduate students face
at Stanford.
