# Hoover appoints acting director
## 
### Karen Kramer 
The Hoover Institution has a
new director at last â€” sort of.
Although Hoover's deputy di
rector, John Raisian, will become
the institution's acting director for
one year starting Sept. 1, the ap
pointment leaves the year-long
debate over who will be the next
director as unresolved and specula
tive and ever.
Raisian's temporary appoint
ment came June 21, after the
search committee for a new direc
tor informed University President
Donald Kennedy that it will not
have reached its final decision
before Aug. 31, the date on which
outgoing director W. Glenn
Campbell agreed to retire.
The announcement accords
with a 1988 provision by the Stan
ford Trustees to have the deputy
director serve as acting director
"when the directorship is tempo
rarily vacant during the search for
a new director."
The reasons for the search com
mittee's continuing deliberation
"are confidential and cannot be
discussed," according to the ten
member committee's head, Gerald
Dorfman.
One speculation is that the
committee is holding out for Mi
chael Boskin, who is currently
chair of President Bush's Council
of Economic Advisers. Boskin re
peatedly issued the statement that
"I have not been offered the po

sition and have made it quite clear
that I have an inviolable commit
ment to the the President of the
United States."
However, when asked about the
duration of his commitment and
whether it necessarily means four
years, Boskin declined to com
ment. Bob Freclen, the vice pres
ident of the University's public
affairs office, explained that "The
possibility of Boskin returning to
take the Hoover directorship
depends on what his commitment
to Bush is. If it's 18 months or
two years, I don't know."
Raisian also remains one of the
top candidates to be the perma
nent successor to Campbell. "I
have been assured by the commit
tee that I am one of the finalists,"
he said.
