# Kennedy sentences protesters to community service, probation
## 
### Robert Landon Staff writer 
After weeks of debate and deliberation,
51 of the 53 students who were charged
with violating the University's Policy on
Campus Disruption will have to perform
75 hours of volunteer work, University Pres
ident Donald Kennedy announced June 20.
The students, who were all involved in
the May 15 occupation of Kennedy's office,
will also be on a one-year probation. The
demonstration called for for increased eth
nic studies and the hiring of full-time ethnic
community deans, among other demands.
If the students violate the probation, they

will be placed on a "suspended penalty,"
which would prevent them from holding
elected or appointed offices on campus.
Another violation of the Policy on
Campus Disruption would be "cause for
consideration of suspension from the Uni
versity," Kennedy said in a letter to Dean
of Student Affairs James Lyons.
Stacey Leyton, member of last year's
Council of Presidents and one of tl*: stu
dents punished, said the action was "rea
sonable" given the history of punishments
imposed by the University for similar of
fenses. But she maintained that the pro
testers should have gone unpunished al
together, "because we did what we felt was

right."
According to University policy, Kennedy
made the final decision on punishment for
the protesters. His decision was based on
recommendations made by a four-member
committee appointed by Lyons.
The committee was composed of Diana
Conklin, assistant dean of residential affairs;
Sally Dickson, assistant dean of student
affairs at the Law School; Thomas Grey,
professor of law and outgoing chair of the
Stanford Judicial Council; and Robert Weis
berg, associate dean of the Law School.
The fate of two of the charged protesters
still hangs in the balance. One is out of
the country; the other missed the deadline

to file for an expedited judicial process,
according to Lyons.
All of the students still have legal battles
ahead, however. Most of them will face
charges of trespassing and unlawful assembly
at Santa Clara County Municipal Court.
One student has been charged with inciting
to riot.
If the county sentences the protestors to
community service, there is the possibility
that they could count their work both for
the University penalty and the county's.
"The University will have no objection
it the work being done under the Univer
sity's judicial action is credited by the
county," Conklin said in a letter to students.
