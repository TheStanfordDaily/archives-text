# Ride to take off for UC-San Diego position
## 
### Bob Michitarian Editorial staff 
Former astronaut Sally Ride will
cut short her fellowship at Stan
ford to become director of the
California Space Institute at UC-
San Diego July I. She has also
been appointed a UCSD physics
professor.
Ride will be the fourth promi
nent scholar at the Center for
International Security and Arms
Control to leave Stanford because
of a dispute with the University
over the center's inability to ap
point its own professors. Rule had
reportedly expressed interest in be
coming a Stanford professor.
At Cal Space, Ride will head a
million research institution
established by the state legislature
in 1979 that coordinates space re
search at the nine UC campuses
and serves as a liaison to the aer
ospace industry.
The exodus from CISAC began
in November when the center's
director, Sidney Drell, announced
his resignation — a last-ditch tac
tic in the center's losing battle for
its own tenure positions.
Ride, who shuns the press, im
mediately shewed her support for
Drell by announcing through a

colleague that she was "seriously
looking around" for other work.
In a written statement a few
days later, Ride said she might
leave "when my fellowship expires
at the end of the summer."
That fellowship, a two-year
grant from the Carnegie Founda
tion that Ride began in fall 1987,
is a "mid-career" fellowship that
allows flexibility in its starting and

finishing dates. Ride has no com
mitments to fulfill, hut will spend
some time here this summer to
continue her research.
Cal Space, which is part of the
Scripps Institution of Oceanog
raphy at UCSD, was one of the
first to contact Ride soon after
she announced she might leave
Stanford, according to Scripps Di
rector Edward Frieman.
