Drought effects
felt by fountains
Although the drought may
be abating, graduates still
couldn't indulge in anv
tountain-hopping this year.
I'o preserve Stanford's
conservation-conscious image
during the third year of the
drought, the administration
decided not to turn on the
fountains tor commencement,
according to Public Affairs
Director Andy Doty.
I he administration had con
sidered hllmg the fountains
with non-potable water. Cheryl
Jensen, manager of mechanical
utilities at Operations and
Maintenance, explained that
the University presently faces
the Santa Clara Valley Dis
trict's ordinance to voluntarily
reduce groundwater consump
tion.
Running non-potable water
through the fountains tor grad
uation would have been "tech
nically possible, though not that
easy," Jensen said. "The deci
sion — whether to run the
fountains — was not mine. All

I said was that we could do it."
The measures needed to use
non-potable water in the foun
tains would have been expen
sive, Jensen said. Currently the
fountains are connected to the
same pipes that carry drinking
water, so the pipe system would
have needed to be altered.
More than the trouble and
cost of tilling the fountains with
non-potable water, the question
of the University's conservation
image swayed the administra
tion against turning on the
fountains, which have been off
since graduation last year.
"With the rest of the world
water-conscious, it wouldn't
look gixxl for the University to
be Haunting its water," Doty
explained.

Knight Fellows
hold 2nd reunion
Imagine receiving a $25,000
stipend to study at Stanford for
a year, while not being required
to take exams or write papers.
Stanford's Knight Fellowship
program provides such an oppor
tunity to 18 outstanding mid
career journalists each year.
More than 100 former fellows
traveled from as far away as Hong
Kong to attend a four-day reunion
conference this week, marking the
24th year that professional jour
nalism fellowships have been
awarded at Stanford.
The program was established to
improve the quality of news and

information reaching the Ameri
can public. Journalists are selected
based on their likelihood to make
significant contributions to the
media. Fellows have won numer
ous awards, including nine Pulitzer
Prizes.
According to Harry Press,
managing director of the program,
"the reunion is a mixture of in
formation and play."
Returning Knight fellows atten
ded public policy seminars on sub
jects ranging from AIDS to the
Alaskan oil spill.
