Drought effects
felt by fountains
Although the drought may
be abating, graduates still
couldn't indulge in anv
tountain-hopping this year.
I'o preserve Stanford's
conservation-conscious image
during the third year of the
drought, the administration
decided not to turn on the
fountains tor commencement,
according to Public Affairs
Director Andy Doty.
I he administration had con
sidered hllmg the fountains
with non-potable water. Cheryl
Jensen, manager of mechanical
utilities at Operations and
Maintenance, explained that
the University presently faces
the Santa Clara Valley Dis
trict's ordinance to voluntarily
reduce groundwater consump
tion.
Running non-potable water
through the fountains tor grad
uation would have been "tech
nically possible, though not that
easy," Jensen said. "The deci
sion — whether to run the
fountains — was not mine. All

I said was that we could do it."
The measures needed to use
non-potable water in the foun
tains would have been expen
sive, Jensen said. Currently the
fountains are connected to the
same pipes that carry drinking
water, so the pipe system would
have needed to be altered.
More than the trouble and
cost of tilling the fountains with
non-potable water, the question
of the University's conservation
image swayed the administra
tion against turning on the
fountains, which have been off
since graduation last year.
"With the rest of the world
water-conscious, it wouldn't
look gixxl for the University to
be Haunting its water," Doty
explained.
