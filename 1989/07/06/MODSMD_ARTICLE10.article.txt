# Large lots less than loved

Despite the costs and com
plaints, it appears large parking
structures arc here to stay.
Two summers ago, Stanford's
first parking structure opened,
soon followed by a similar struc
ture last April. The first serves
the Medical Center and the
chemistry and biology areas and
the second provides parking for
the south end of campus.
Both structures, called PS-1 and
PS-2, reach the same six stories,
although PS-2's capacity is only
758 cars while PS-1 holds 1,050
vehicles.
With such multi-layered con
venience, however, comes a large
cost. According to Julie Fremon,
managing director of transporta

tion programs at Stanford, each
parking structure cost a "neigh
borhood figure" of $8 to 10 million
to build. As "painful" as Fremon
herself admits that cost to be, she
cites several reasons for such large
investments.
For one, Stanford is continually
building new academic facilities on
already existing parking lots. Lots
have become a dwindling breed
on campus, "moving automobiles
further and further off campus,"
according to Fremon. "Parking
places need to be within walking
distance and in order to minimize
that distance we have made
parking available in this now more
dense form."

Despite the boring name, Parking Structure II paints a pretty picture on the night skyline.
Looks aren't everything, however, especially when they come with a multi-million dollar
price tag.
