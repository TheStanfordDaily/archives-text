Despite the costs and com
plaints, it appears large parking
structures arc here to stay.
Two summers ago, Stanford's
first parking structure opened,
soon followed by a similar struc
ture last April. The first serves
the Medical Center and the
chemistry and biology areas and
the second provides parking for
the south end of campus.
Both structures, called PS-1 and
PS-2, reach the same six stories,
although PS-2's capacity is only
758 cars while PS-1 holds 1,050
vehicles.
With such multi-layered con
venience, however, comes a large
cost. According to Julie Fremon,
managing director of transporta

tion programs at Stanford, each
parking structure cost a "neigh
borhood figure" of $8 to 10 million
to build. As "painful" as Fremon
herself admits that cost to be, she
cites several reasons for such large
investments.
For one, Stanford is continually
building new academic facilities on
already existing parking lots. Lots
have become a dwindling breed
on campus, "moving automobiles
further and further off campus,"
according to Fremon. "Parking
places need to be within walking
distance and in order to minimize
that distance we have made
parking available in this now more
dense form."
Fremon explains that building

price tag.
these structures was an effort
toward "efficient land use. As
Stanford expands physically it is
more and more critical to use every
parcel of land in the best way
possible," she said.
Turning to the Stanford com
munity for their response to the
added buildings on the horizon,
the views arc as mixed as the
concrete itself. According to junior
Marlene Rodriguez, "The one

across Roble Field (PS-2) is really
bright and obnoxious. It glows or
ange!" She preferred the less bright
lights of the other structure which
"doesn't glare" as much.
Safety is perhaps the biggest
concern for those now using the
new buildings. One worker at the
medical center who wished to
remain anonymous admits that
while she doesn't like the struc
tures and is "nervous alone there
with no one around," parking was
needed and at least the structures'
glass elevators give "a feeling of
safety."

Senior Sue Song also agrees that
"the glass elevators are a good
design for safety."
Of the potential risk involved,
another medical worker, also
anonymous, "won't chance it." She
added, however, that the struc
tures seem to be well cared-for,
citing that past complaints of
water leakage on parked cars were
quickly taken care of last year.
Safety and maintainance aside,
appearence was another consider
ation. The structures were
definitely designed to be fashion
able as well as functional, although

they don't match the University's
overall tendency towards Spanish
architecture.
"We've won some recent awards
in national competitions," for the
structures, according to Fremon.
The parking structures can't com
pete with the beauty of local trees,
but their shade is perhaps better
than that of trees. One facilities
employee said the ability to park
in the shade makes the structures
"a nice place to park." With this
advantage, however, comes the
warning that "the later you come
the higher up you go."

Fremon did break the hearts of
tennis players by saying that the
old Roble tennis courts will not
be rebuilt. The courts were paved
over to provide temporary parking
while PS-2 was being constructed.
The courts were to be rebuilt after
the completion of PS-2 but due
to the newly-opened courts on
Campus Drive West, the old courts
will not resurface. The area will
next be used as a storage area for
building materials to be used in
the Earth Science Building and
the Advanced Materials Research
Building renovations.

over to provide temporary parking
while PS-2 was being constructed.
The courts were to be rebuilt after
the completion of PS-2 but due
to the newly-opened courts on
Campus Drive West, the old courts
will not resurface. The area will
next be used as a storage area for
building materials to be used in
the Earth Science Building and
the Advanced Materials Research
Building renovations.
