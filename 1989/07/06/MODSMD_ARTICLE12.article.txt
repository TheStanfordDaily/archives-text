## Let's talk agenda 
### 
SUMMER IS THE time for the University com
munity to set an agenda for the academic year.
Although many problems have been subject
to close examination in recent months (par
ticularly those of racial discrimination), some
other issues also deserve closer attention.
The Weekly's editorial board offers the following
list for discussion:
Campus cultural life
The University community should examine the compo
nents of its cultural environment. Although some student
organizations have undertaken heroic efforts to improve the
quality of life at Stanford, our "culture" — defined in the
broadest sense of the term — too often lacks depth and
meaning. Sometimes, it can be downright pernicious, par
ticularly when it relates to issues of gender.
Fraternities should be subject to a public review
process to determine if they are consistent with the
goals of this co-educational institution.
Stronger efforts should be made to increase the
number of women in the faculty and in high-level,
decision-making positions in the administration.
The findings of the Rape Education Project should
provoke major discussion throughout the community.
Most importantly, it should provoke action.
Campus intellectual life
Although Stanford is one of the top universities in the
nation, with an unmistakeable and admirable commitment
to undergraduate education, it's time for some major changes:
Disband the quarter system. Students and faculty,
particularly in the humanities, feel its constraints each
day.
Outlaw classes of over 40 students. Large lectures
don't encourage interactive learning and have no place
at an institution of this stature. Mammoth classes such
as Psychology 1 are insulting.
Revamp the University system of distribution re
quirements. It's arbitrary and doesn't work.
More classes should be writing-intensive. Grades
should be more than a letter at the bottom of an
essay. Students only can learn to write if professors
and TAs make serious efforts to teach them.
All students should be required to complete a "senior
project." No student should graduate without having
undertaken a serious and sustained intellectual effort.
Money
Students need a greater number of meal plan op
tions. Currently, undergraduates feel trapped and
suckered by Food Service.
Classes need teaching assistants. Teaching assistants
need money. The logic is clear: fund them.
Rescind the tuition hike. When will this end? Why
must students feel as if the University is completely
unsympathetic to their economic realities? Why must
they feel as if the University has no qualms about
condemning them to a life of debt? Students are bound
to get the message soon: They will go to Berkeley.
The University's first priority should be to its people.
Buildings are empty without them.
