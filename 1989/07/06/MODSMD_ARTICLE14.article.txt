Acts of civil disobedience
require the courage to
face the consequences
Civil disobedience has a
long and proud history.
Ghandi, King, David Harris,
Walesa, Sharansky, Las
Madres in Argentina, and
the students in Tiananmen
Square are only the most
prominent of recent exam
ples.
Now, the Agenda for Ac
tion coalition at Stanford is
giving civil disobedience a
bad name. In case you've
forgotten, boys and girls, rule
number one is that you don't
play this particular game
unless you have the courage
to accept the consequences of
your actions.
If you think occupying
Donald Kennedy's office ad
vances your cause somehow,
fine. Maybe history will
prove you right. But don't
expect anyone to respect
your cause if you don't re
spect it enough to back it up
with your hide. If yo .ir cause
is worth sitting in for, it's
worth standing up for and
taking the rap for. Whining
about being charged
cheapens your cause by
portraying your action as a
prank.
I suggest you re-read

Thoreau's "Essay on the Duty
of Civil Disobedience." If you
don't want to go back that
far, check out the pictures of
Martin Luther King Jr.'s wife
congratulating him for his
conviction in the Mont
gomery bus boycott.
You say you want your
education improved. The
most glaring defect in your
education is that you some
how never learned the most
important lesson of all: that
your actions have conse
quences, and that you
shouldn't act unless you
have the integrity to accept
the consequences.

Alumna and mother asks
for respectful reply
to May 15 protest
As an alumna of Stanford
and a parent of a Stanford
student involved in the May
15 "takeover" of the Presi
dent's Office, I have an inter
est in the issues being raised
by this event.
It is impossible to forget
the atmosphere in which my
days at Stanford were spent
— protesting the House Un-
American Activities Commit
tee in San Francisco, plan
ning civil rights activities in

the South and marching
against capital punishment at
San Quentin. Therefore I
can't deny that I am proud
of my daughter and those
others who had the courage
to move history forward yet
again.
It is one of the pleasures
of a free society that the
young can express their con
cern for justice without re
ceiving the retributive reac
tion of their elders, especially
when that concern coincides
with the fundamental stand
ards of a democracy — jus
tice and respect for others —
and of the University.
Given the expressed inten
tion of Stanford's administra
tion and faculty to achieve
the standards that those stu
dents were impatient for, I
anticipate a respectful re
sponse to their actions. It is
a model that needs to be set
by the academic world for
the whole world.
