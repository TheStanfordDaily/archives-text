## Housing discrimination is alive and well — and close to Stanford 
### 
This episode did not in
volve any white people. It
involved an Asian-American
woman and a black woman.
It was the first time in 10
years that I, an Asian man,
nave directly observed racism
in action.
The black woman had ar
ranged — over the phone —
to move into a room on the
property of Mrs. Chen (name
altered).
I was unloading the car in
Mrs. Chen's driveway as
Rebecca (not her real name,
but similar in that it is not
an identifiably "black" name)
went to the front door. As
soon as Mrs. Chen came out
and saw Rebecca's face, she
began to say things like, "I
think I prefer to rent to a

long-term occupant."
This struck me as very
odd, considering that the
place had been advertised
tor temporary occupancy and
that Mrs. Chen had approved
a move-in over the pnone as
recently as last night.
Mrs. Chen came up with
more and more hurdles to
Rebecca's occupancy.
It had been agreed upon
that rent would be charged
through the actual date of
occupancy in mid-August,
not through the end of this
month. Now Mrs. Chen in
sisted that rent had to be
paid through the end of Au
gust.
Mrs. Chen left me with no
doubt that there were no
logistical problems, but that

she did not want a black
tenant.
I drove Rebecca home,
seething because it seemed
so obvious that the subsur
face issue was the color of
Rebecca's skin. Rebecca's own
response was a very calm
and philosophical one. She
acknowledged what was
really going on (discrimina
tion), but shrugged it aside.
After reaching home, I
decided to call Mrs. Chen in
order to convey my percep
tion of what was going on. I
did not expect it to change
her decision but I thought it
would help to let her know
that her basis for denying
Rebecca housing was obvious
to an observer.
I stated, very simply, that I

hoped she would not allow
any racial factors to influence
her decision. She confessed
to the real reason for her
denial — it was the color of
Rebecca's skin.
Mrs. Chen explained that
she had black neighbors with
whom there has recently
been tension. They play loud
music and have disregarded
her requests to turn down
the volume. Last night they
threw a rock through one of
Mrs. Chen's windows and
threatened to break down
her door if she complained
any further.
Mrs. Chen said she didn't
want any loud partying in
her own back yard, and was
apprehensive that a black
tenant would do that. More

importantly, she admitted to
being worried that Rebecca
might befriend her black
neighbors and side against
her.
That phone conversation
left no doubt whatsoever in
my mind that Rebecca was
declined as a prospective
tenant solely because of the
color of her skin. This is ex
actly the kind of discrimina
tion and denial of access that
minorities speak of.
Lest any Asian-American
readers of this piece take
offense, let me add that I
think it incidental that the
landlady in this case was
Asian-American.
