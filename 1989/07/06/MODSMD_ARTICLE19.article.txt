## John Hiatt: the gravelly voice of experience 
### David Chang Staff writer 
To melt your icy blue heart
Should I start!
To turn what's been frozen for years
Into a river of tears.
John Hiatt walked out quickly,
smiling, and the capacity crowd of 1,200
at the Paul Masson Winery roared. Or
at least it did its best, given the polite
surroundings.
Although his bluesy, folksy voice
would have fit nighttime better than a
brilliantly clear day on a mountaintop,
the intimate location was appropriate
for the affable Hiatt.

Throughout the performance he made
the most of his friendly wit, his acoustic
guitar and the emotional range of his
voice. Hiatt's talents shone, even unac
companied by his band, which was un
able to assemble for the West Coast
concert.
You think you've come so far
In this one horse town
Then she's laughin' that crazy laugh
Cause you haven't left the parking lot
Mischievously, I liatt joked, mugged
and sang his new creation "Since His
Penis Came Between Us."
"I like this thing," he said, imitating
the audience members who were cooling

themselves with paper fans provided by
the winery. "It's like a Baptist church;
I always wanted to do a little preacher
kinda thing."
And after he amazed the crowd with
an astonishingly pure whistling solo, he
came down to earth by simply saying,
"Third grade whistling champion." Just
another kid down the block who could
whistle, sing, songwrite, play the guitar
and piano and stun a crowd into amaze
ment for two hours.
Not to say that Hiatt wasn't experi
enced or serious. The concert was mostly
composed of songs from his old albums,
but like a veteran, Hiatt kept the at-

tention of an audience that for
the most part only recognized new
songs.
His voice, in itself, grabbed at
tention. Dusky and warm, it
quieted the persistent applause
and reminded the audience that,
despite the jokes, John Hiatt
means what he sings. It rose in
the songs like a strong emotion
until it peaked in a pinched yeli
and tumbled back down into
whiskey-soaked bass.
Time is short and here's the damn
thing about it
You're gonna die, gonna die for
sure
Ami you can lean\ to live with

love or without it
But there ain't no cure
There's just a slow tumin'
From the inside out
A slow tumin'
But you come about
The rumbling ferocity of
"Riding with the King," a partial
tribute to Elvis, ended with a
lighthearted, jazzy guitar solo. It
was like a New Orleans funeral
â€” a cathartic combination that
wrapped the audience in one emo
tion and then relieved the tension
by introducing its opposite.
This dexterity with lyrics and
music was probably why his most
recent album, "Slow Turning," re
cently won him "Best Songwriter"
and appeared fifth in the "Best
Album of the Year" category in
Rolling Stone's music critics' poll.

And his live performance last
Saturday certainly was worthy of
praise. His voice gives witness to
the tact that he has lived an event
ful life. His songs testify that he
believes it was worth it.
As a woman in this world
Vttll, you must have felt like this
That a man could come along
With another hard luck song
And betray you with a kiss
Would you reconsider me
Though I know I've caused you
pain
1 have taken vows with you
And I believe them to be true
Now, can we take a little rain
