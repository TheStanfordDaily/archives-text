Summertime conccrt series
in the Bay Area arc an industry
unto themselves, and like any
hip business, customer comfort
is often reduced to nothing
more than a variable in an
equation for profit and produc
tion. So it's refreshing to find
a concert program in which cus
tomers arc still guests.
It's enough that the 31-year
old Paul Masson Winery Sum
mer Scries includes so many
well-known artists, like upcom
ing performers 8.8. King, Joan
Baez and Kenny G. But in ad
dition, such artists appear in
the small and comfortable en
virons of the hilltop winery.
The amphitheater only holds
1,200 people, but it's so small
that there isn't a bad seat in
the house. The stage is situated
in front of the 80-ycar-old stone
facade of the original winery.
At intermission, the staff serves
free glasses of Masson wine on
the winery plaza, and guests
may wander to the patio to
enjoy an expansive view of the
Santa Clara Valley on one side
and the Santa Cruz Mountains
on the other.
The atmosphere makes it all
a class act. And that's the whole
point. The winery gets good

publicity from the scries, but
that's about it. To finish in the
black, the venue must be vir
tually sold out. All proceeds go
to charity.
Some tickets run as low as
$10.75, and most of the big
name concerts will cost $15 to
$20 â€” moderate rates by Bay
Area standards. If you've got a
special someone to impress,
consider making an evening of
it.
There's something to be said
for the energy of the summer
mega-concert, but when hype
gets tiresome, try the hillside
vineyards of the Paul Masson
Winery for a truly ... uh ...
"vintage" experience.

Most tickets are sold through the
mail in April, but others are still
available through the ticket office
at (408) 741-5181.
