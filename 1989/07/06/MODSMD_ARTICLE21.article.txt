# Sigourney II: On gender and ghosts
## 
### Susan McKean Editorial staff 
Editor's note: This is the second of
tu>o articles. The Weekly spoke on
June 17 with Sigoumey Weaver when
she visited campus with her niece,
who will be a senior in high school
and may apply to Stanford.

"I would be horrified if anyone
thought of me as a role model,"
Sigoumey Weaver says, staring
penetratingly at the ground, as
though lost in thought and dis
belief about the possibility.
But then she looks up at me,
tips her head to the side, and
makes some allowances for those
who venerate her.
After playing a strong role as a
hero in the "Aliens" series, she
realizes she symbolized a "certain
kind of liberation. A female hero
that wasn't wearing a little metal
lic brazierre."
And although she sees the film
industry improving in its treatment
of women, she says more needs
to be done.
"1 don't know why they don't
make more films with women as
the heroes. Maybe they try. I do
think they're doing better. When
I started out it was so discouraging;
you'd get sent 20 scripts, they'd
all be horrible girlfriend parts and
walking in and out in little dresses.
But there's still a long way to go.
"Men in the industry are paid
(much more). A Harrison Ford
would get paid about $4 million

per picture, and a woman would
get... maybe an eighth of that....
(Robert) Redford got about $7 or
8 million for 'Out of Africa,' and
Meryl (Streep) got under $3 mil
lion.
"The studios say that women
haven't proven themselves as big
box office hits. And they have
another theory that's lame. They
say women pick the movies, and
the pictures that women want to
go to see with their husbands or
dates are pictures with Mel Gib
son, Kevin Costner, etc.
"It's funny because the feedback
1 get as an actress is that women
go to see other women. They enjoy
going to see strong women that
they can relate to. Women aren't
ornaments ... and they like to
see films reflect that."
Weaver sets the task of securing
gender equality in the movie world
squarely on the actors' shoulders.

"It's going to be up to us, the
studios aren't going to make it
easy for us. They're not going to
wake up one day and say [she
assumes a deep, contrived voice]
'Let's do great roles for women.
Let's call this women's year.' It's
just not going to happen."
Then she sheepishly admits,
however, to playing a "throwback"
role in "Ghostbusters II": "Yeah,
I play a girlfriend and a mother."
Although she credits film's so
cial influence with minimal power,
Sigourney, who acts in both
Ghostbusters movies, has observed
some unusual effects of those
movies on American society.
"I've been noticing how all the
under-5-year-olds have all become
Ghostbusters, especially the little
boys. I haven't seen too many little
girls running around with proton
packs, which is too bad. I've cer
tainly seen a lot of little boys
running around.
"That's one area where I think
film has been very powerful,
among a certain age group. And
I don't think anyone quite under
stands why.
"I mean, why would Bill Murray
appeal to these little post-toddlers?
He's very hip, and sort of dark
and anti-authority and these little
guys are running around saying
'This chick is toast.'"
Rut from one who would know,
what is it that does make Rill
Murray so appealing.'

"I think he's got a real twinkle
in his eye. He says what we'd all
like to say. He's fearless. And
what's great about Bill is he never
ends up having to pay for his
mistakes on tilm. He kind of slith
ers out of any retribution."
In discussing the relationship
between her character and Mur
ray's character in "Ghostbusters
11," she recalls once asking Murray,
"What do you think is the arc of
our relationship in this film?"
And he said, "The what?"
"That was good for half an hour
of making tun of me," Sigourney
says.
And the appeal of "Ghost
busters II"?
"It's great, fabulous. We're all
five years older, we're all more
experienced. We loved working to
gether again. And I think you can
sec that affection on the screen,
there's a relaxation to it. More
mellow. I think this one is cleverer
in a way. It's of course less original
and less fresh because everyone
knows what to expect, but I'm
very proud of it. Oddly enough,
it has been getting better reviews
than the first one, which shocked
me."
She laughs, smiles and looks
past me. To the unassuming man
approaching the table she says,
"Hey, hi sweetie." It's her husband,
theater director James Simpson.
The conversation turns from her
work to her play. In her free time
she doesn't watch a lot of movies,
although she says she should. She
likes to listen to Prince, Bobby
Brown, Elvis Costcllo and In
donesian gamelan music. And they
have recently built a house in

upstate New York where she will
spend the summer taking it easy.
With no film roles lined up for
now, she's starting to get into the
producing business. Not just any
productions, she says, but "mean
ingful" projects. She's working on
developing for the screen a
Japanese play, a comedy and a
book. "I usually have some acting
job in the works. My happiest time
is when I've finished one and I'm
preparing for another. The prep
aration is like a freefall, it's so
much fun to research the roles.
"Producing is hard. It's kind of
lonely. But it's also nice to have
full responsibility, and say 'No, no
I don't agree.' Because actors
usually end up making yes work."
