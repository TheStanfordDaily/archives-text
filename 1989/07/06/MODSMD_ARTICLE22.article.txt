# 'Love and Rockets' underachieves
## 
### Cliff Chew 
I've been eagerly waiting for the release of the
fourth, self-titled Love and Rockets album for some
time. Now that it's out, I'm disappointed.
The members of Love and Rockets — Daniel
Ash, David J and Kevin Haskins — are all excep
tionally talented musicians who have been together
for longer than most people think (especially those
who have only heard of them through lop 40 airplay
of "So Alive"). They date back to the days of
Bauhaus, the legendary Ciothic punk outfit begun
in 1979.
However, their new album doesn't have the in
tensity of their first three, which gave Love and
Rockets a Pink Floyd-influenced, modern psychedelic
image with songs like "Haunted When the Minutes
Drag," "All in My Mind" and "Love Me."
Nor does the album have the musical or thematic
coherency that the previous albums do — the Eastern
mysticism pervasive in "Kxpress, tor example, or
the acoustic touch of "Earth, Sun, Moon.
The album does display the diverse talents of the
bandmembers, most notably David J, who sings and
plays bass, harmonica, keyboards and acoustic guitar.

It also contains several promising tracks, such as
the riveting, feedback-laced "Motorcycle" and the
eerie "Teardrop Collector."
If you have never seen Love and Rockets in
concert before, nothing more can be said except go
sec them. They appear at the Greek Theatre in
Berkeley on Friday, July 14. Their spectacular
performances are complemented with the most in
tense light show imaginable. It is virtually an
out-of-body experience.
Even if you're not really attached to Love and
Rockets, their show is stunningly impressive. I predict
that after their performance, my gripes about their
slightly disappointing effort on the new album will
be forgiven and I will eagerly await another.
