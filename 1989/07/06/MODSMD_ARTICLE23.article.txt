# 'Heathers' is a bizarre treat

### Robert Landon Staff writer 
Somewhere between "Pretty in
Pink" and "Blue Velvet," "Hea
thers" in surely one of the oddest,
darkest and perhaps one of the
best movies of the summer so far.
If you have an aversion to
movies about adolescent angst in
the San Fernando Valley, you
might be put oft by the first 20
minutes of the film. It .ippears to
be the struggle of Veronica (played
by Winona Ryder) to enter into
the popular crowd, and the guilt
th.it comes when she leaves her
plump and bespectacled friends
behind.
Bur then the tables are suddenly
turned when the scruffy and hand
some Jason Dean (Christian
Slater) introduces murder into the
seemingly innocuous plot, turning
a teen movie into a black comedy
about murder and teenage suicide.
And it is as funny as it is disturb
ing.

alternative to teen small
mindedness, with his longish hair,
his earring and his eccentric
speech ("greetings and salutations"
instead of "hi"). But when he
makes Heather Number One, the
leader of the pretty people and
consummate hitch, drink a glassful
of blue drain-cleaner, his hero
status is suddenly called into ques
tion.
Michael Lehman's deft direction
and Christian Slater's subtle script
do not allow the audience to make
any quick moral judgments, how
ever. Heather Number One's
money and beauty allow her to
be cruel in her quest for social
prestige. We have little sympathy
tor her as she lies dead among her
fashion magazines.
Jason's next victims, two homo
phobic, bullying football players,
are certainly no more sympathetic.
He cleverly designs their murder
