# 'Ghostbusters' is still fun

"Ghostbusters II" is here, and
even though it mostly covers
old ground, it's worth seeing.
Peter Venkman (Bill Murray)
is still the same rascal. But his
relationship with Dana Barrett
(Sigourney Weaver) turns
warmly affectionate, reminis
cent of an early "Moonlighting"
episode. Sometimes he shows
emotional depth; looking at
Barrett's baby son Oscar,
Venkman muses, "I could have

been your father."
And there's some poignancy
as Barrett says she left Venkman
when he started calling her "the
old ball and chain."
Unfortunately, Sigourney
Weaver is basically reduced to
playing a damsel in distress. An
other 20-story-tall supernatural
creature walks the streets of
New York. And there's a cheesy
"I love New York" ending.
But there's a lot of fun in
seeing the Ghostbusters' breath
less joy at getting back to what
they do best.
