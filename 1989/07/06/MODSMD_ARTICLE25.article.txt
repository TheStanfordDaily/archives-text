Americana and exhilaration
have a heyday at air shows, or at
least they did at Moffet Field last
weekend.
As a F-18 Hornet flew overhead
at close to the speed of sound,
everyone within earshot seemed
to lend their spirits to the skies
with it.
The Naval Air Force show on
Saturday and Sunday at Moffet
held, located five miles south of
campus, provided plenty of
vicarious thrills in the form of
rolls and swoops, tailspins and il
lusory collisions.
The crowd, estimated by one
policeman at 200,000, saw every
thing from antique biplanes to

vertical lift-off Harrier jets to the
star attraction, the Blue Angels.
In addition to the planes in the
air, there were NASA test planes
and Coast Guard rescue helicop
ters displayed on the ground.
Children found their fun in large
quantities of ice cream and in
flatable airplane models.
Despite the size of the Fourth
of July weekend crowd, few prob
lems occurred. One of the security
guards commented, "Our main
problems are not violence or fights,
but one person's fun spilling over
into another's."
The displays celebrated both
America and the military, and the
audience responded with screams,
applause and unbridled enthusi
asm.
