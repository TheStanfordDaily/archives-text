## Goldie, Fendick dazzle in London Former NCAA champs reach quarters and round of 16 respectively 
### Mark Rogowsky Snorts editor 
When Dan Goldie and Patty
Fendick were collegians, they were
untouchable on the tennis court.
Goldie won the NCAA singles
title as a senior in 1986; Fendick
captured two titles — in '86 and
'87 — and even went undefeated
as a senior.
On the pro circuit, while they've
both been successful they've failed
to attain the same level they
reached at Stanford.
This past week at the All Eng
land Club, however, Goldie and
Fendick both made a great deal
of noise at Wimbledon before suc
cumbing to two of the best players
in the world.
Goldie's Wimbledon got oft to
a fast start when he bested Jimmy
Connors a week ago in the second
round.
That win was a confidence
booster for Goldie as he headed
for his third-round matchup with
Australian Wally Masur. In a tough
four-setter, Goldie captured three
tiebreakers en route to a 7-6 (7-3),
7-6 (7-1), 3-6, 7-6 (7-5).
Bui the former All-American
wasn't through yet. Goldie's
fourth-round match pitted him
against Yugolslav Slobodan
Zivojinovic — a big server who's
game is perfected suited for the
grass courts of Wimbledon. Goldie
took him out in straight sets: 6-4,
6-4, 7-6 (8-6).
That earned Goldie a date with
the world's top-ranked player, Ivan
Lendl, in the quarterfinals. It was
there Goldie's tiebreaker magic ran
out. Lendl captured the first two
sets 7-6 (10-8) and 7-6 (7-4).
If a couple of points went the
other way, Goldie would've been
up two sets. Instead, his spirit was
finally broken and he dropped the
third set 6-0.
Fendick's ride was one round
shorter, but impressive nonethe
less.

Playing in only her second tour
nament since returning from a
two-month layoff, Fendick scored
a 6-1, 6-4 victory over Britain's
Clare Wood in the second round.
She then took out Shaun Stafford
— an arch-rival from college —
in the third round 2-6, 6-1, 6-3.
Next up: Chris Evert, in what
may he her tinal Wimbledon. Evert
didn't seem prepared to let it end
when she met Fendick in the

round of 16 and took her out 6-2,
6-2. In a charming moment, when
Fendick fell to the ground trying
to make a shot at match point,
Evert, waiting tor her at the net,
dropped to the ground herself.
The two smiled and exchanged
some pleasant words.
For Fendick and Goldie, ranked
in the mid-20s and the mid-40s
respectively, the wins will push
them both up a few notches.
