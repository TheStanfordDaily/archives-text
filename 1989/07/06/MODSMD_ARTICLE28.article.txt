# Ladies and gentlemen, hush — it's Wimbledon
## 
### 
Ah, the All England Lawn
Tennis and Croquet
Club ... Home of The
Championships, as they are
called.
How perfectly arrogant. How
perfectly Wimbledon.

Two weeks ot positively atro
cious tennis on the men's side
(has anyone seen a point last
more than three hits?) and
delightful, fast-paced action on
the women's, er ladies', side
(Moonballers begone! Get
thyselves back to the '70s!)
While Wimbledon isn't a test
of one's overall tennis ability
as much as one's serve and vol
ley, it is the obsession of nearly
everyone on the pro tour. It is
the tournament.
You will never be considered
among the greats unless you
win there (as Ivan Lendl knows
so well). Rut Wimbledon's bit
ter irony stems from the fact
— among the men, at least —
that the positively mediocre can
bang-bang their way to a cham
pionship every now and then
(arc you listening, Pat Cash?).
With all its idiosyncrasies,
though, the most offensive
thing about Wimbledon can be
summed up in two words: Bud
Collins.
The Boston Globe tennis
writer of the past two decades
is unfortunately the color man
for NBC. And, unfortunately,
NBC holds the broadcast rights
to The Championships.
Collins is amazing. I mean,
really, how can anyone who is
so universally despised hold on
to his job? No one likes Bud.
Not the television viewers and
certainly not the players.
Several years back, after she
had just won a tournament,
Collins said to Chris Evert
something like this:
"Someone once asked you,
'Do you ever get tired of win
ning?' What do you have to
say about that?"
Evert looked quizically at
Collins and replied to the effect
of, "Yeah, who did ask me that?
Oh, wait Bud, it was you. That
was a stupid question."
Chris Evert, the consummate
champion, essentially called
Bud Collins a moron on na
tional television. Still, he is
employed.
Truly amazing.
In a way, Collins is not really
the problem with the televi
sion coverage of tennis' most
prestigious event — he is one
ot many problems.
Don't get me wrong, remov
ing Collins would improve
things tenfold: no more of his
patented screaming whisper
("Oh, net cord!"), no more of
his pedantic pronunciation les
sons "Ga-bree-ELL-a Sab-a-

TEH-nce, roll it off your tongue
like a fine wine" and no more
of those idiotic anecdotes about
players no one has ever heard
of "I remember back in 1971
when Javier Lopez Portino de
Nunez...
But if Collins were dismissed
tomorrow, we'd still be left with
the same people upstairs —
directors, producers, et al. The
same people who showed us
every second of John McEnroe's
pasting of Jim Pugh even
though there were another half
dozen more interesting matches
in progress.
1 know, everyone wants to
see McEnroe. So do I. But in
stead of watching two-and-a
half hours of the erstwhile Bad
Boy of Tennis blowing out a
relatively unheralded Pugh, I
wouldn't have minded a little
taste of the other action.
In that regard, the HBO cov
erage of the event has been far
superior. In their daily show,
the Home Box people have put
together an excellent montage
ot the key moments in the day's
important matches. They never
stick with a dull dusting and
almost always show set clinch
ing points, comebacks in the
making and so on.
To be fair, it appears that
they do it all through the magic
of videotape. Despite their dis
inguousness on the subject, the
HBO "package" appears to be
just that. When host Jim
Lampley tells us we're moving
to Court 14 to check in on
Jimmy Connors and Dan
Goldie, I'm about 99 percent
certain someone pops in a cas
sette and hits Play.
But NBC also has the benefit
of the time difference between
London and the United States.
They could do the same repack
aging if they chose to. Or, they
could simply switch to other
live action as the situation war
rants. Dick Enbcrg dutifully re
ported key information about
other matches in progress to us
during McEnroe-Pugh.
NBC could have taken us
there. They didn't.
But then, they also don't
have Lampley. The former
ABC-sports-anchor-to-be has
done a top-notch job with the
HBO show. He also did one of
the most refreshing things I've
seen from a sportscaster in a
long while.
Lampley was asked by an
other HBO commentator what
he thought about someone's
chances ot going tar in the draw.
Lampley, sitting next to Arthur
Ashe, basically said he wasn't
an expert and passed the ques
tion on to Ashe — who, as a
former pro, is theoretically more
able to judge such matters.
In one simple moment,
Gentlemen Jim put aside the
momumcntal ego that charac
terizes today's sportscaster
(countless examples come to
mind) and admitted that his
prediction — lacking any ex
pertise — would be even more
worthless than the typical
sports prediction (which, as
Pete Rose can attest, is pretty
worthless even when it comes
from the most inside of insid
ers).

ot the key moments in the day's
important matches. They never
stick with a dull dusting and
almost always show set clinch
ing points, comebacks in the
making and so on.
To be fair, it appears that
they do it all through the magic
of videotape. Despite their dis
inguousness on the subject, the
HBO "package" appears to be
just that. When host Jim
Lampley tells us we're moving
to Court 14 to check in on
Jimmy Connors and Dan
Goldie, I'm about 99 percent
certain someone pops in a cas
sette and hits Play.
But NBC also has the benefit
of the time difference between
London and the United States.
They could do the same repack
aging if they chose to. Or, they
could simply switch to other
live action as the situation war
rants. Dick Enbcrg dutifully re
ported key information about
other matches in progress to us
during McEnroe-Pugh.
NBC could have taken us
there. They didn't.
But then, they also don't
have Lampley. The former
ABC-sports-anchor-to-be has
done a top-notch job with the
HBO show. He also did one of
the most refreshing things I've
seen from a sportscaster in a
long while.
Lampley was asked by an
other HBO commentator what
he thought about someone's
chances ot going tar in the draw.
Lampley, sitting next to Arthur
Ashe, basically said he wasn't
an expert and passed the ques
tion on to Ashe — who, as a
former pro, is theoretically more
able to judge such matters.
In one simple moment,
Gentlemen Jim put aside the
momumcntal ego that charac
terizes today's sportscaster
(countless examples come to
mind) and admitted that his
prediction — lacking any ex
pertise — would be even more
worthless than the typical
sports prediction (which, as
Pete Rose can attest, is pretty
worthless even when it comes
from the most inside of insid
ers).

Ah, the All England Lawn
Tennis and Croquet
Club ... Home of The
Championships, as they are
called.
How perfectly arrogant. How
perfectly Wimbledon.

Two weeks ot positively atro
cious tennis on the men's side
(has anyone seen a point last
more than three hits?) and
delightful, fast-paced action on
the women's, er ladies', side
(Moonballers begone! Get
thyselves back to the '70s!)
While Wimbledon isn't a test
of one's overall tennis ability
as much as one's serve and vol
ley, it is the obsession of nearly
everyone on the pro tour. It is
the tournament.
You will never be considered
among the greats unless you
win there (as Ivan Lendl knows
so well). Rut Wimbledon's bit
ter irony stems from the fact
— among the men, at least —
that the positively mediocre can
bang-bang their way to a cham
pionship every now and then
(arc you listening, Pat Cash?).
With all its idiosyncrasies,
though, the most offensive
thing about Wimbledon can be
summed up in two words: Bud
Collins.
The Boston Globe tennis
writer of the past two decades
is unfortunately the color man
for NBC. And, unfortunately,
NBC holds the broadcast rights
to The Championships.
Collins is amazing. I mean,
really, how can anyone who is
so universally despised hold on
to his job? No one likes Bud.
Not the television viewers and
certainly not the players.
Several years back, after she
had just won a tournament,
Collins said to Chris Evert
something like this:
"Someone once asked you,
'Do you ever get tired of win
ning?' What do you have to
say about that?"
Evert looked quizically at
Collins and replied to the effect
of, "Yeah, who did ask me that?
Oh, wait Bud, it was you. That
was a stupid question."
Chris Evert, the consummate
champion, essentially called
Bud Collins a moron on na
tional television. Still, he is
employed.
Truly amazing.
In a way, Collins is not really
the problem with the televi
sion coverage of tennis' most
prestigious event — he is one
ot many problems.
Don't get me wrong, remov
ing Collins would improve
things tenfold: no more of his
patented screaming whisper
("Oh, net cord!"), no more of
his pedantic pronunciation les
sons "Ga-bree-ELL-a Sab-a-

TEH-nce, roll it off your tongue
like a fine wine" and no more
of those idiotic anecdotes about
players no one has ever heard
of "I remember back in 1971
when Javier Lopez Portino de
Nunez...
But if Collins were dismissed
tomorrow, we'd still be left with
the same people upstairs —
directors, producers, et al. The
same people who showed us
every second of John McEnroe's
pasting of Jim Pugh even
though there were another half
dozen more interesting matches
in progress.
1 know, everyone wants to
see McEnroe. So do I. But in
stead of watching two-and-a
half hours of the erstwhile Bad
Boy of Tennis blowing out a
relatively unheralded Pugh, I
wouldn't have minded a little
taste of the other action.
In that regard, the HBO cov
erage of the event has been far
superior. In their daily show,
the Home Box people have put
together an excellent montage
ot the key moments in the day's
important matches. They never
stick with a dull dusting and
