Welcome! In the spirit of sum
mer, we at The Weekly have
decided to play a game — and in
volve our readers. Please accept our
challenge.
Somewhere on or near the Stan
ford campus, we have hidden a box
of "treasure." We won't tell you
what it includes just yet. (Pssst! It's
rumored that The Weekly "trea
sure," called "The Black Eyes of
Orpheus" by "ancient legend," in
cludes ... a videotape copy of the
classic film "Treasure of the Sierra
Madre"!)
In the following seven weeks, we
will print clues in a clearly-marked
box (or clearly-marked boxes!)
somewhere in the The Weekly. To
gether, these clues will lead you to
. . . "TREASURE."
Happy hunting! "X" marks the
spot! Good luck!

"THE SECOND CLUE" (surprise!
you've already read the first!):
What do "Stones for Ibarra" and
Aldous Huxley have in common?
Adrienne Rich noticed the fact!
