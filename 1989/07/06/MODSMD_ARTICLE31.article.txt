### Torhen H. von Staden 
Bird Rock
In the fifty meters tween skerry and shore, steel
Waters lurch and scare up quill fountains,
Splash white ink in lines that reel
Riptide drunk and tumble, erasing an unwritten
Sky. 1 iere, grey-white gulls rattle-
In the winded sea foam or hunker down among
The shelved pools of their jagged, whelmed castle:
Less touched than Eden, and less touchable. Flung
From beneath sea bottom, this black crag
Guards its gulls from human history;
With hands of stone it palms small lakes, and lag
Winds but shirr the surface, purling softly.
Cradled in the gentle lap of this shore, a new
Egg whispers of a cloudy, stirring blue.

Blind Man by Wishing Well
Throwing air
in a two-beat juggle
he gests precarious,
cross-kneed and seated,
a posture that speaks
of casual.
A bluff of blue
beard whisps at blindness' out
stuck upward angle
of beseech, curtsies
through air it can only accept
to trust.
• Sunset between low buildings,
'• he knows as warm,
except where a tongue of white
washed stone (topping the fountair
wall) licks from it
a last shadow.
A manta eked of loom
and shuttle statues
its weave beside him:
the coarse, scutched
colors of rigor
in amber light.
All day the two
in settled exigence
mark the rhythms
of the sun: the one darken
ing as the other
fades.
Soon, he will stunt
back on his perch, fingering
another's wish from the plucked
pool, tasting metal on skin:
the palmed weight
of possibility;
Midnight and a mclic tumble
of droplets flutes its
silver fall to black,
as a gentle aspersion
settles over
his curled form.
At bottom, now,
wishes as a thousand moons
in some other's heaven; ear
pressed to the cold stone that
holds this sky, he listens
for their song.

West
When the wind wings through, these fields
do sing:
the hiss and seethe of wheat.
Listen.
You will hear its shrill notes
like a man
racked on ancient beams or
the keen
swing of a guillotine, or perhaps
it is
scarecrows, the thousands of palms
and soles
spiked to shredding timbers, weathered white
and bloodless —
the twine-choked shrieks of mere straw.
Or only
jackdaws on a high-breeze, just over
the curve
of Earth. Or a splayed tongue whispering of
Edenlessness,
toil, and bleached bones the spade struck
and strew
and shrugged off in a brief, quivering clank.
Or the woman
in the farmhouse, wheezing out a stillborn.
Or the instant
warble of a nightingale, a bough-bound Siren
beckoning
toward a dark and shifting throng. Or even
the thin creak
of cicadas perched on phantom crops that
by moonlight
sigh away in ashes.
But it is
the grasses, their rasp and squall
of plaint,
sounds of the wound from which they grow
he has riven
>, and gashed since time.
| And the grasses:
' the sibilant whine of scything,
the snare
of winnowing descent. Finally,
a mere drifting
I of chaft across the bald earth and
V the hollow rustle
of husk against stubble. Whatever
- it may be
it is a song of whaf
awaits.
