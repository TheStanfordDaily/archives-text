# Without irrelevancies: an interview with Nancy Packer
## 
### Joe Murphy 
Nancy Packer, professor of English and
recently-appointed director of the Creative
Writing Program at Stanford, teaches classes
in both the writing and analysis of fiction.
Her new book of short stories, "The
Women Who Walk," published by Louisiana
State University Press, contains stories she
has written since her first collection, "Small
Moments," appeared in 1976.
Packer's stories have been reprinted in
such anthologies as "Prize Stories: The O.
Henry Awards" and "Best American Short
Stories." Last year, she published a family
memoir entitled "In My Father's House:
Tales of an Unconformable Man."
In a recent interview with The Weekly
in the living room of her campus home,
Packer discussed her new book and her
writing career.
How does "The Women Who Walk" differ
from your earlier collection?
People tell me these stories are depress
ing. I don't want them to be depressing. If
they're serious, that's fine. They probably
deal with more ultimate matters than did
"Small Moments." Some of the stories in
"Small Moments" might have been lighter
both in touch and in meaning.
Does this indicate a general trend in your
work?
Apparently it indicated a general trend.
But I now have shifted considerably in the
last two years and am writing comical stories
at this point. I don't think they're frivolous,
but 1 hope one will smile while reading
them. I don't think there arc a tremendous
number of smiles in this book.
When did you start writing stories?
I didn't start writing until I was about
25. I wrote a short story for a contest when
I was 13, and all I remember about it was
the last line: "And he buried his head in
the blistering sand." It was a melodrama
about somebody being lost in the desert.
1 started writing a story when 1 was 17,
during the war. It was about Olga, who
worked in a defense plant, and John, her
Marine husband who was overseas. Olga
has an affair with Basil in the defense plant,
then John comes back.
I was writing this "true confessions," and
I got to the point where Olga writes, "I
did not know what I would do." Then I
stopped and I wrote, "And I don't know
now." Then I stopped and I wrote, "And
I don't give a damn," and that was the end
of that story and my effort to write until
I was about 25 years old.
What made you try writing again?
I was a big reader. I loved reading and
loved literature, and I just decided, well,
maybe I could do it. But for me, you sec,
it was putting myself forward against the
greats — against Hemingway, Faulkner.
What did I think I could do? But I decided
I could try.
I wasn't very good. It took me a long
time to become a reasonably good writer.
As a matter of fact, only after I came to
Stanford and was a Stegner Fellow and
received good advice from Dick Scowcroft
and Wallace Stegner did I really become a
much better and more confident writer.
Local readers can't help hut recognize the
real-life basis for many settings in your book:
Lake Lagunita, Memorial Church, the English
Department, the West Stacks at Green, Es
condido Village and so on. Does such "inside
knowledge" enhance one's appreciation of your
story?
I hope that it is irrelevant to the under
standing and appreciation of the story. Al
though I can imagine that if I read a story
and recognized a place I would get a little
blip of superiority. But I don't think it

really ought to increase the pleasure or the
meaning.
I'm tired of everyone being perfectly will
ing to write about Harvard, but when Stan
ford writers write they always make this
fictionalized university. I decided I didn't
want a university that was unrecognizably
Stanford. I wanted it recognizably Stanford.
How great a role does region play in your
fiction?
It's a penetrating question. I'm a
Southerner and the South is supposed to
permeate everybody's writing, but I never
could write much about the South. I never
quite had the hang of it. I feel much more
at home in the university.
So the university really is my region in
that regard, in terms of the particular out
of which any writer hopes the universal
will grow. I don't think university people
are so different from others that they can't
become universal.
What's funny to me is that right now
I'm writing this comic stuff — and it's all
Southern. Everybody's Southern, they talk
Southern, they act Southern, they relate
Southern. I don't know what's happened
to me — now I'm becoming a Southern
writer.
What writers, Southern or otherwise, have
influenced your work. ?
Certainly there's nobody who's not in
fluenced by William Faulkner. You can't
give yourself to reading Faulkner and not
come out somehow transformed, though
unfortunately I don't see a lot that he has
left in my writing.
No writer my age could have not been
influenced by Ernest Hemingway. When I
was young and he was it, we read and
worshiped. When I was young, I was going
to write a story called "The Diary of a
Young Writer." The first day was going to
start, "Today is Monday. The weather is
good," and go on in a very I lemingwayesque
style. Then Tuesday would switch to
Faulknerian. Then Wednesday would go to
Fitzgerald, and so on.
I would like to think I was most influ
enced by Anton Chekhov, but only insofar
as I am interested in writing about the
kinds of things that he writes about.
Raymond Carver said he started writing
short stories in part because he never had time
to focus on anything longer and partly, he
said, because he did not have a large enough
vision of the world to sustain a novel. Why
do you write short stories?
I don't go with the first, but I go with
the second. I don't really have a large vision
of the world that I would want to express
through a novel. I have many small visions

but not a large vision. I've always said this
and I guess it's cliche by now, but there
are sprinters and there are marathoners.
I'm a sprinter, and I guess Carver is a
sprinter, too.
Among the 12 stones in"The Women Who
Walk," I count 10 divorces, one separation
and one case of marital infidelity. Why is the
failure of romantic love such a persistent theme
in these stories?
I think at the stage of my life in which
I wrote them I was more interested in
parent/child relationships and siblings. I've
never written much directly about romantic
love. The story called "Making Amends,"
for example, is not really about romantic
love. It's about revenge and how a sore
can last 25 years and still you want to get
your own back.
Some of the stories alternate between male
and female perspectives. How does your cre
ative process differ in constructing a male
consciousness as opposed to a female conscious
ness?
I don't think it does. I think that a writer
has the need to say something like, "Who
would I be if I were that man, who would
I be if I were that woman?" Men and
women are not that different, I don't think,
in their perception of the world.
I have never had the least reluctance to
write from a man's point of view. 1 think
that what we have in common is infinitely
greater than what separates us.

Fidelity to one's beliefs, to one's mind, to
rationality, is the supreme human value. It is the
human spirit at its cleanest. Rather than finding
easy ways out and easy comforts, to be true to
one's rationality and one's humanism is the height
of the human spirit.

And yet you write much more often from
a tforrwn's perspective.
Yes, it's quite natural. But with the stories
that are from a man's point of view, if
somebody would say, "It doesn't sound like
a man," I wouldn't believe them. I feel it
does, at least as much as my women char
acters sound like women.
Do you think your stories are as accessible
to men as to women?
Yes, I do. 1 think they're about being
human, whatever the situation is. Men
might not be as interested because men are
more apt not to be interested in fiction.
But men who arc interested in fiction would
be as interested as women who arc inter
ested in fiction.
Do you feel a woman can more fully com
prehend your meaning in cases where an emo
tion is linked to some physical sensation
particular to the female body?
If it were physical, yes, I do think that.
I would never, ever try to write about a
sexual experience from a male's point of
view. 1 don't think I understand that, al
though maybe 1 could if 1 really tried.
More often, however, your female characters
experience feelings of pain rather than pleasure
through their bodies. For example, in "Jellyfish,"
the girl's physical pain becomes, in her mind,
a way of preventing her parents' divorce.
Would a little boy have that feeling? I
don't know. That's interesting. I wrote a
similar story from a little boy's point of
view in "Small Moments," but there wasn't
pain. In that story, the little boy is just as
aware, but what he does is distract himself.
I guess I must think that males are trained

to go outward to the "real world" while
females go inward.
Dialogue carries great weight in your stories,
in some perhaps more than narration. How
do you go about writing dialogue that is concise
and yet at the same time true to lifel
You need the recognition that you don't
put in irrelevancies — that you only use
dialogue to push the story forward, as
Elizabeth Bowen says. It has to sound right.
But it doesn't have all the wastage that
regular conversation has.
To get it right, I say it out loud as I'm
sitting at the machine. I don't like to have
anybody in the house with me when I write
because I don't want anybody to overhear
me.
I know that dialogue is my strength in
the stories. I often have to remind myself
that there has to be a setting, a place —
that place matters, that place often repre
sents the meaning of the story. But I have
to remind myself. To me the interesting
thing is what people say to each other. I
have to go back sometimes and put in place
and gesture. Maybe I should have tried to
be a dramatist.
Do you ever take pieces of dialogue from
what you overhear in the street or other public
spaces?
No. I wish 1 did. I think I'm not a very
efficient gatherer. I often tell anecdotes
about things I've seen or heard and people
say, "I bet you'll make that a story." Well,

I won't. I never find anything "out there."
So your stories originate from an imagined
situation rather tlum from a specific experience?
My stories are not autobiographical. Rut
they certainly intersect with experiences
I've had or things that have troubled me
or things that I've understood from other
people. They start with a kernel, and go
from there.
Did you base your characterizations of the
creative writing students in "Lousy Moments"
on actual students in your classes?
No, the students in "Lousy Moments"
are not any specific students I have ever
known. I've had students object to criticism
of their fiction, but no one as extreme as
Roland Ives. I have seen the vanity and
narcissism and self-consciousness of Janice
Marsh around campus, and there are people
like the other students. Rut I have taken
types and made them individual. They arc
not based on any individual person.
What about the English professors in"The
Waiting Game"?
The professors in"The Waiting Game"
are not my colleagues. There may be aspects
that are similar, but they arc not my col
leagues. I see a face, for instance, for Prof.
Cathcart, but I don't know whose face it
is. There is no roman A clef in that story.
In the first place, I like my colleagues much
better than 1 could like the characters in
that story.
What made you write "The Day the Tree
Fell Down"?
