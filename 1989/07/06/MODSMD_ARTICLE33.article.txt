## Battling inertia: Jim Adams encounters education 
### Susan McKean Mark Weiner Editorial staff 
Jim Adams is spinning a wheel
on a cast-iron contraption next to
his desk. That's what he does: He
spins wheels.
He spins wheels in the minds
of students — he cranks the gears
of the University — he turns the
conventions of academia up
sidedown.
Author of "The Care and
Feeding of Ideas" and the best
selling "Conceptual Blockbusting,"
Adams chairs the Stanford Pro
gram in Values, Technology, Sci
ence and Society.
Adams was well trained for his
position. He received his B.S. in
Mechanical Engineering at Cal-
Tech and studied Art at UC-Los
Angeles. He came to Stanford to
earn his M.S. in Mechanical En
gineering. He later received his
Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering
with an Art minor from Stanford
as well.
Adams has taught at Stanford
since 1959 and has received both
the Richard W. Lymann Award
for faculty volunteer service and
the Lloyd W. Dinkelspiel Award
for Outstanding Service to Under
graduate education — "for his
freewheeling, blockbusting,
barn-burning style."
A champion of interdisciplinary
education, Adams launches scige
on department fortresses. He
catapults lectures, essays, books,
conversations against the walls of
stereotype and misunderstanding
that he sees separate the sciences
and humanities.
With his Renaissance attitude
of dauntless optimism and
curiosity, Adams has broken down
many traditional intellectual
edifices.
We asked Adams to allow us
to tap into his own creativity and
thoughts. And they flowed on and
on, spilling onto almost two hours
of tape. We kept asking, he kept
asking and we all played with
answers.
What follows is the text of our
conversation, condensed and
edited so that it helps to reveal
the man in Building 370, Rm. 372
who is spinning wheels and send
ing sparks of creative thinking
flying in the University and
around the country.
What is your earliest memory of
technology?
I grew up on a farm, so that's
pretty easy. My first memory of
technology had to do with people
making it. My grandfather was a
fix-it person, and so my first mem
ory was watching him make these
things that I now realize were to
tally unacceptable from an engi
neering standpoint.
This was on an orange farm
and for pests they used to blow
sulfur dust on the orange trees.
My grandfather once made a ma
chine to blow this dust on the
trees. And the machine had a
whole lot of engines and funny
things in the way.

My grandfather didn't know
that sulfur dust is very inflam
mable. And the engines had lots
of sparks on it. So, it was quite
glorious because he started this
thing up once and it made lots
of noise and instantly exploded!
In "Two Cultures and the Scien
tific Revolution," C.P. Snou> said that
intellectuals are "increasingly being
split into two polar groups," best
represented by literary intellectuals
and physical scientists. Snow wrote
that between the two groups lies "a
gulf of mutual incomprehension," that
"their attitudes are so different that,
even on the level of emotion, they
can't find much common ground."
You often discuss Snow's work. What
do you see as the costs of the split
he describes?
Well, 1 look at it kind of on
three levels.
First of all, the stuffs fun. I
think a history major who gets a
kick out of technical things has a
personally richer life. Most knowl
edge is exciting. I'm teaching a
course now with Bob Osserman,
VTSS 51, 52, 53 (The Nature of
Technology, Mathematics and Sci
ence). We designed it for Stanford
students who don't think they like
technical things. We think it's fun.
And it turns out to be fairly suc
cessful.
A lot of students who come
into that course have a lot of
math in their background, and
they have good aptitude, but they
hate it. And I think one of the
things that gets to them early is
how much Osserman loves it be
cause 1 mean he just loves this
stuff and has a wonderful time.
And I think the students figure
out that they're missing something.
Especially when he starts explain
ing to them that mathematics is
purely aesthetics and that what
mathematicians are really up to is
finding beauty. And the students
sort of think, well, gee, I like beau
ty, why can't I sec the beauty in
the junk your doing? And then
he starts showing them what it is
and it kind of turns them around.
I think the message on the other
side is conveyed more strongly,
that obviously scientists and en
gineers are lacking if they have
no appreciation for the social
sciences and humanities.
See, I went to Cal Tech, and
we were told the first day we came
in that life was shallow unless you
had a pretty broad appreciation
for intellectual things. I don't
think that people who come into
the humanities arc often told that.
Now the next level, which is
real, although not as high-minded,
is the purely vocational level. It's
gotten very difficult to hide from
either side. Stanford students can
not go out and be scientists or
engineers without coming across
all kinds of things that are human.
For one thing, you can't be any
thing without dealing with other
people, and second, you are a per
son, and being a person means
that terrible things will happen to
you in life as well as wonderful

things, and you have to be able
to deal with them and understand
them.
So, to the extent that the hu
manities give you a feeling about
what it means to be human, you
can't avoid them. Neither can you
avoid math or computers or sci
ence. You pay a penalty if you
wander around the world only
knowing one side.
And then the third level is na
tional. I think we and maybe most
countries have a fairly major prob
lem with technology and science.
We're supposedly a democracy, and
therefore have elected people who
represent our desires, but how do
you handle technical risk? How
do you handle world environment
problems? Is fireon a problem or
not? What are you going to do
about acid rain? I don't think that
there's enough knowledge about
what all this stuff is that we can
handle it well as a country.
And if you get into uncertainty
that's really true. For instance, if
you build something that's large
and complicated, it won't (neces
sarily) work the first time you use
it. The country will back some
thing like the space shuttle, and
when one falls down, people get
very shocked. It's not shocking.
It's tragic, but it's a very high risk
thing. You're out on the edge of
what you know how to do.
There needs to be more national
sophistication about all of that. I
think we want all this stuff now,
but aren't willing to take any of
the bad effects that come out of
them.
What do scientists get from study
ing the humanities?
The humanities makes you
think about relative values, for
one. And I think that's helpful.
If nothing else, if you're an en
gineer or a scientist, it makes you
understand there aren't answers
to some things. And then you find
out there are no answers to (some
problems of) science. It helps you
there, too.
One reason that the study of
history is very important to me is
that it makes you realize that
people have been around a long
time and probably will be around
a long time. That makes you feel
a little better because you're not
especially essential to the whole
world. And if you're not, your
problems aren't always that highly
important.
Now, I've always liked to hike
in the mountains. If you've got
the Sierras around you, you realize
you aren't all that necessary. And
that's good, because if you're not
necessary, you don't worry so
much about things — and there's
some of that I think in history.
You see yourself as part of this
pageant.
And if you have a little better
sense of where you fit in humanity,
you realize that the whole thing
isn't (revolving) about you. So, if
you take some risk and fail, it's
not that big a deal.
You're an outspoken champion of

interactive teaching. Could you tell
us a little about what parts of teach
ing you like best and where you see
the most creative learning taking
place?
When I used to teach design,
one of the things that was really
fun was when a student would
make that transition from thinking
there was an answer to ex
perimenting and trying to draw
personal conclusions as to what
works best.
That's one of the reasons that
Ph.D. dissertations arc fun. Here
are these people who have always
gotten A's, who are just complete
stars at taking courses. They can
take any course and get an A —
but they've always had a textbook.
Then someone says, OK, make
some order out of this mess here,
and the first thing people do is
go to the library. They figure that
there's a textbook somewhere, and
there isn't.
And then they spend some time
being very strange. They stop out
for a year, they start bicycle shops,
they climb mountains and they
become musicians or something.
And then they finally get down
to doing their dissertation and
realize that they can in fact make
sense out of nonsense.
Do you use any particular edu
cational exercises to encourage cre
ative thinking, to elicit this recognition
that students can make sense out of
nonsensel
I talk a lot in so-called executive
programs and I work a lot with
company managers, and I just love
to give them something to do that
they don't think they can. And
what I have them do, which 1
learned from English Prof. Diane
Middlcbrook, is write a poem on
love or something that's serious
and then have them read it to
each other.
You take a nice, good middle
aged bunch of vice presidents who
are usually male — and the pain
is intense. In fact, people come
up with all kinds of schemes to
try to avoid it. And yet they will.
It's really interesting, because
when they're done — they really
hate to read to each other — you
ask them how many of them think
their poem is not very gotxl. They
all raise their hands.
And then you ask them how
many of them thought they were
listening to poems that were quite
good. And they all raise their
hands.
And they get all confused, be
cause it's obvious that all those
poems were at the same time very
good and very bad. If you talk
about that, people suddenly realize
that they don't know whether or
not they can write a poem.
A lot of creativity is in being
able to wander beyond your limits.
If your limits are set for conven
ience and for being a specialist,
and don't really correlate with your
ability, that's kind of tough. The
best way I know how to do that
is with games and exercises.
You tell someone that

(creativity comcs from wandering
beyond your limits) and it has no
meaning. But if you actually get
them to do something that's out
side of their usual habits, and they
find out that they did better than
they thought, then they have to
live with that problem, that they're
artificially constraining them
selves.
Do you think that grades and the
quarter system block creativity?
The whole education thing has
a number of anti-creativity fea
tures that are part of the whole
way the thing is structured. When
Stanford started it didn't have
grades. In the '60s a lot of schools
got rid of grades. And what hap
pens? Society can't handle it, be
cause society wants an easy way,
they want six different numbers
to put on your head so they can
evaluate you.
Now, 1 occasionally will offer a
course pass/tail, but I will get static
from students who will tell me
quite honestly that it's very hard
for them to do the work for my
course if they have another course
that's graded and has a test the
next day.
(Grades are) a piece of currency
for the time you put in, and it's
something that's easy for compan
ies to look at. But, I think it
inhibits creativity.
The quarter system certainly
constrains the amount of incuba
tion time. Quarters or semesters
tend to be finite systems. I'm not
personally sure there's that much
difference (between them) because
I think most people procrastinate
and tend to work hardest just
before things arc due. Certainly
for people in the humanities the
quarter system is a constraint.
But I also think the discipline
base, the departmental base, is
constraining: only departments
have the resources and can ap
point faculty.
1 think students get the idea
that thinking is in boxes and that
they're very different and that you
can't think between them or think
in two.
One thing that always amazes
me is the very small number of
students who do the self-designed
major here. I think that thing's
wonderful because you can actu
ally say what you are and do it.
But I think people feel that what
Stanford has alreadv is more ;ic-
