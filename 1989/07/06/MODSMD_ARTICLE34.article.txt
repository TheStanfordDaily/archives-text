## Med Center genetic counselor counts the chromosomes 
### Mark Davies 
Barbara Pcttcrscn is a profes
sional counselor. But instead of
advising couples about marital dis
putes, sexual difficulties, or mid
life crises, she counsels prospective
parents about genetic complica
tions their children may inherit.
Pettersen works in the Gyne
cology and Obstetrics Department
at Stanford University Medical
Center. As a genetic counselor,
she uses amniocentesis and spe
cific laboratory tests to aid parents
in their decision whether or not
to pursue a pregnancy.
Although the law requires that
pregnant women of age 35 and
over be offered amniocentesis,
many other people opt to take
advantage of genetic counseling.
These include couples who have
experienced multiple miscarriages,
couples who have had a child with
a chromosomal aberation such as
Down syndrome and couples who
have a family history of genetic
disorders.
Individuals also seek genetic
counseling to allay their fears of
being a carrier of a serious disease.
Although it is not widely known,
a large number of people carry
one copy of the gene for an in
curable disorder. If one of these
people marries another carrier
with the same defect, their
children face a significant chance
of inheriting the disease.
In addition, certain populations
are at a higher risk for specific
diseases. Asians are more likely to
be carriers of the thalassemia gene,
a disease which tends to be fatal
by the early teens, while those in
the Jewish population stand a
greater chance of carrying the gene
for Tay-Sachs disease.
Statistics show that one in 20
Caucasians is a carrier for cystic
fibrosis, and one in 12 blacks has
a copy of the sickle-cell anemia

gene.
The good news is that genetic
counselors like Pettersen can
prescribe accurate blood tests to
determine if a person is a carrier.
For couples considering parent
hood this information is crucial to
their decision-making process.
Now a commonly employed
technique in genetic counseling,
amniocentesis is the process by
which some of a fetus's watery
environment — the amniotic fluid
— is carefully removed from the
amniotic sac which surrounds it
during its development. Am
niocentesis is performed between
the 16th and 20th week of preg
nancy with the aid of ultrasound,
a technique which uses sound
waves to create an image of the
fetus.
From the amniotic fluid, some
of the unborn child's cells can be
obtained and used to make a
karyotype — a visual photograph
of a cell's chromosomes. This
karyotype can then be used to
spot genetic irregularities.
In a normal human cell there
are 22 chromosome pairs plus the
two sex chromosomes, for a total
of 46. In Down syndrome, an extra
copy of chromosome 21 appears.
"This extra chromosome is easily
seen," said Pettersen, "especially
since a computer can be used to
group the chromosome pairs."
Although in most cases am
niocentesis simply provides reas
surance for the parents and
determines the sex of the unborn
child, it sometimes detects abnor
malities.
In these cases it is an invaluable
tool because parents receive accu
rate information early on in the
pregnancy, allowing them time to
review the situation with the
counselor and reach a decision.
Although many couples elect to
abort the pregnancy, some choose
to go through with it, said Pct

tersen.
The recent Supreme Court
ruling on abortion will not have
much of an effect on genetic coun
seling in California, Pettcrson said,
unless funding for abortions is cut
off by the state. The controversial
decision does not ban abortions,
but does make it easier for indi
vidual states to restrict funding
for abortions in public hospitals.
When asked about the future
of genetic counseling, Pettersen
mentioned that researchers are
now in the process of analyzing
the human genetic code. By se
quencing the entire genome, sci
entists will have a workable "road
map" of where each gene lies and
what it looks like in its correct
state, thereby allowing them to
locate genetic problems with
greater accuracy.
The next step, according to Pet
tersen, may entail gene therapy,
which involves the treatment of
a disorder on the genetic level.
By attacking the problem at its
origin, doctors could bypass many
of the complications that result
from treatment with radiation or
drug therapy.
The technique would require
the patient to be infected with a
virus specially engineered to carry
genetic information. The genetic
material contained in the virus
would depend on the disorder,
consisting of a correct or healthy
version of the gene responsible for
the problem. Hopefully the virus
would infect the patient, alter the
targeted gene, and curc the dis
ease.
In the future, once genetic
counseling reveals a problem, gene
therapy could be used to correct
it. However, clinical applications
of gene therapy must wait until
scientists have learned more about
the human genetic code and until
clinicians are ready to apply it.

tests to help prospective parents predict the health of their
children.
