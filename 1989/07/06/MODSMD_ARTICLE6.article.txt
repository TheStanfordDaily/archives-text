## New health, safety director appointed 
### Karen Kramer Staff writer 
For Carol Hoerner, Monday
was a day for new beginnings:
she started her job as Stanford's
first director of environmental
health and safety.
The position was created by
University President Donald
Kennedy last September follow
ing an extensive investigation
into health and safety on
campus. The investigation was
prompted by events that began
in December, 1987, when
former Environmental Satety
Facility operations manager Jon
Moldestad accused the Univer
sity of widespread waste and
mismanagement in the area of
health and safety.
The new position will over
see the Health Physics Depart
ment as well as the formerly
separate Health and Safety De
partment. In his announcement
of the position's creation last
September, Kennedy empha
sized that the director would
have "direct access ... to the
president for emergency and
quality control purposes," as
well as the power to order an
end to any unsafe activity.
Although one of the auditors
who conducted the investiga
tion, David Fetterman, said in
September he was satisfied the
University had "finally listened
to everybody" in the course of
the investigation, Moldestad

sued the University in January,
alleging that the investigation
was flawed.
Health Physics previously
handled radiological safety —
issues such as using radioactive
isotopes or radioactive machin
ery like X-rays in research.
Health and Safety, on the other
hand, dealt with other poten
tially hazardous materials.
According to Director of Op
erations and Maintenance
Ralph Buchanan, who held the
position temporarily during the
search process, the decision last
September to create Hoerner's
position meant "we were trying
to recognize the increased im
portance of health and safety
intiatives within the Universi
ty-"
Hoerner's specific goals, she
said, are to "have an excellent,
safe environment and to be very
responsive to the needs of our
clients and the community."
During the first few months of
her job, Hoerner said she "will
be spending time identifying the
personnel and getting to know
them and their concerns."
After working for Genentech,
a biotechnology company, for
the past four years, Hoerner is
new to the Stanford communi
ty. "I am delighted to be on
board here," she said. "I feel
very welcome and glad the com
munity will endorse these pro
grams. I can't wait to get my
hands wet."
