## 
### Soeun Park Staff writer 
After 17 years as dean of the
Graduate School of Business,
Robert Jaedicke has resigned, ef
fective Aug. 1.
Provost James Rosse expects to
have a search committee formed
by the first of next month to find
a replacement.
"Jaedicke has clearly provided
strong leadership for the school at
an important time and I admire
his taking himself out of the school
at a good time when other lead
ership can come in," said Rosse.
When questioned about how
the new dean may differ from
Jaedicke, Rosse said, "We don't
expect much substantive change,
although there will be a change
in emphasis. 1 plan to consult
widely, and the search committee
will help in trying to find that
emphasis."
Under Jaedicke's leadership, the
business school has dramatically
increased its emphasis on the in
ternational dimensions of manage
ment, been a pioneer in the study
of non-market forces and revived
the Public Management Program.
Donations to the school under
Jaedicke have reached all-time
record levels. Under his tenure,
13 endowed professorships were
established and financial aid fel
lowships for MBA students were
greatly expanded.
The fundraising success that
Jaedicke has had is credited to the

'Jaedicke has clearly
provided strong
leadership for the
school at an important
time and I admire his
taking himself out-'

"external presence" he has built
up with the press and public over
the years, according to Charles
Sizemore, assistant dean for devel
opment and external affairs.
According to Sizemore, whose
office is in charge of fundraising
and media relations for the school,
the new dean "could do a lot by
modeling himself or herself after
Bob's ways" since "a strong foun
dation has already been estab
lished."
The Business School, unlike the
Law School, is responsible for
raising all of its own funds and
does not receive money from the
University except on a reciprocal
basis. Explains Sizemore, "The
school receives a lot of money
from corporations and they do a
lot of recruiting here. A dean has
to be sensitive to their needs from
an MBA program and the students
who graduate from that program."
"An important role of the dean
is to represent the school to its
many constituencies," agrees As
sociate Dean for Academic Affairs
John Roberts. "In any academic
organization with strong faculty

there arc many views of the way
the school should he going and
the dean can have a major impact
in the way of leadership."
Roberts says,"The things that
Jaedicke has been working on need
to be pushed further. The inter
national side of business has been
emphasized and is doing well, but
we need to push harder in the
areas of manufacturing, innova
tion, management of technology,
and also to solidify and advance
the area of the non-market side
of business, or the social, political
and non-economic aspect of busi
ness."
Neither Rossc, Roberts nor
Sizcmore would speculate on pos
sible candidates for the new job,
although Sizemore noted that "the
speculation may center on whether
the search is internal or external."
