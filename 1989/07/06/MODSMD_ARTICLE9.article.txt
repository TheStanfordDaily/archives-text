# New AIDS study begins
## Stanford researchers now testing potential treatment 
### Bob Michitarian Editorial staff 
Stanford researchers are looking for
AIDS victims to volunteer for testing
with an experimental treatment for the
disease.
The researchers arc studying the po
tential of a drug called DDC, or
dideoxycytidinc, to replace or supplement
AZT, the only drug legally marketed to
treat AIDS and AIDS-related complex.
AZT, or zidovudine, causes serious
side effects — including anemia, a con
dition of serious weakness caused by a
lack of red blood cells or hemoglobin —
in about half of those who take it for a
year.
DDC's most serious side effect is a

painful nerve disorder called peripheral
neuropathy, which may diminish when
use the the drug is stopped.
Researchers hope that an AIDS treat
ment which alternates DDC and AZT
would limit the side effects of each drug.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administra
tion last year approved expanded testing
on DDC. Shortly thereafter, Stanford was
named one of 12 centers selected to
study the drug.
Seven people participated in the first
part of the Stanford study, which began
this time last year and is closing in the
next few weeks.
Those interested in participating in
the study's second phase, which lasts a
year, should call the AIDS Clinical Trial
Group at (415) 723-6231.
