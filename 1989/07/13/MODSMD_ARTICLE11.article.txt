## Bones symbolize ancestors' kindred spirits 
### 
Traditional Native Ameri
can belief views human exis
tence as one process. Living
and dying are joined to
gether, thereby making the
whole of one's life.
It is believed that after
death not only does the spirit
go on to another world and
reality, but an essence of that
spirit remains with the
bones; therefore, bones are
still alive spiritually. They
symbolize the kindred spirit,
and possess a spiritual power
as well.
Among Native Americans
there are various manifesta
tions of the same principle
and varying degrees of tradi
tion. Some tribes share
detailed taboos, or regula
tions, around this topic.
The Pomo Indians in Cali
fornia warn not to go near
and especially not to touch
human remains for fear of
inheriting sicknesses and
diseases lived through by the
deceased. Moreover, if the
individual whose bones are
handled was like a poison in
the world (witchlike), anyone
touching his bones may risk
infection and be poisoned
himself.
Gabe Sharp, a Mojave In
dian and a medical social
worker at the Indian Medical
Center in Phoenix, Arizona,
approaches this spiritual con
troversy from another per
spective: Mojaves tradition
ally have cremated their
dead. Sharp explains that the
religious philosophy of each
tribe determines the extent of
spiritual belief, understanding
and taboo.
Questions like "Where did
we come from? What are our
origins? What is our relation
ship with the world? How
do we think of the Mother
Earth?" arc important ques
tions that are integral to the
Indians' feelings of how
human remains should be
treated, Sharp explains.
Sharp states that Mojaves
believe the dream (that
which came before the crea

tion of the Earth, the
thought), the intangible, was
primordial. From the dream
(the Hopi suggest it was the
thought) the physical world
— the tangible — was
created. Valuing and credit
ing the intangible forces in
life maintain the power of
spirit and its right to be
respected and treated sacred
'y-
It is very difficult for Indi
ans to understand someone's
claim of ownership of bones,
says Sharp. Since the spirit
of the person still "owns"
them himself, it is impossible
for another human being to
own them. An individual
owns only his bones.
"You don't play around
with spiritual stuff," says
Charlene Irwin Flood, a
Hualapai/Hidatsa from Ari
zona who is currently work
ing as a social worker at the
Intertribal Friendship House
in Oakland, California.
Hualapai Indians, she says,
"don't get near them (bones)
or touch them — you might
bring the spirit of the per
son. You never know what
kind of spirit it is."
Hualapais bury the per
sonal belongings along with
the body, believing that
humans become attached to
their possessions spiritually.
It is also taboo for Hualapais
to talk of a dead person or
to say their name out loud.
Flood explains that the
spiritual significance of an
event or circumstance
depends on other events and
circumstances, and also
depends on how much one
is in touch with the culture
and spiritual world view.
"The spiritual depends on
other tnings," Flood says.
Flood tells how her mother
reacted when she brought
some bones and artifacts
home one day that were
given to her oy a non-Indian
mend. Flood's mother "didn't
want them anywhere in the
house." Flood was instructed

to get rid of them immedi
ately.
"Elders have a better un
derstanding of these things,"
Flood says. Flood's maternal
grandmother shared her
traditional world view with
her family, and told Flood
and others frightening stories
about the unseen.
Flood can remember being
told stories about the many
Hualapais who died from
interaction with white
people. She was told stories
about people her grand
mother knew, and of others
whose stories were passed
down from one generation to
the next. Consequently, Flood
feels related to Hualapai
people of the past, to the
extent that their memory has
been preserved.
American Indians through
out the country still tell their
creation stories. They relate
tales of the time when
humans and animals could
communicate. They share
stories of how death first
came into the world.
For thousands of years,
through oral tradition, these
beliefs have been passed on,
sustaining a connectedness
with the past. Thus relation
ships are drawn spiritually
between present-day Indians
and those Indians whose
bones are stored in boxes
and trunks, cellars and base
ments all around the coun
try.
To understand the related
ness felt by American Indians
to the bones of their ances
tors is to understand the
physical/spiritual bond that is
evident in Native American
culture. For further under
standing of our situation one
need only ask, "Would 1 al
low the bones of my
grandparents to be pieces of
someone's science collection?"
Most people would say,
"Never!"

and possess a spiritual power
as well.
Among Native Americans
there are various manifesta
tions of the same principle
and varying degrees of tradi
tion. Some tribes share
detailed taboos, or regula
tions, around this topic.
The Pomo Indians in Cali
fornia warn not to go near
and especially not to touch
human remains for fear of
inheriting sicknesses and
diseases lived through by the
deceased. Moreover, if the
individual whose bones are
handled was like a poison in
the world (witchlike), anyone
touching his bones may risk
infection and be poisoned
himself.
Gabe Sharp, a Mojave In
dian and a medical social
worker at the Indian Medical
Center in Phoenix, Arizona,
approaches this spiritual con
troversy from another per
spective: Mojaves tradition
ally have cremated their
dead. Sharp explains that the
religious philosophy of each
tribe determines the extent of
spiritual belief, understanding
and taboo.
Questions like "Where did
we come from? What are our
origins? What is our relation
ship with the world? How
do we think of the Mother
Earth?" arc important ques
tions that are integral to the
Indians' feelings of how
human remains should be
treated, Sharp explains.
Sharp states that Mojaves
believe the dream (that
which came before the crea

tion of the Earth, the
thought), the intangible, was
primordial. From the dream
(the Hopi suggest it was the
thought) the physical world
— the tangible — was
created. Valuing and credit
ing the intangible forces in
life maintain the power of
spirit and its right to be
respected and treated sacred
'y-
It is very difficult for Indi
ans to understand someone's
claim of ownership of bones,
says Sharp. Since the spirit
of the person still "owns"
them himself, it is impossible
for another human being to
own them. An individual
owns only his bones.
"You don't play around
with spiritual stuff," says
Charlene Irwin Flood, a
Hualapai/Hidatsa from Ari
zona who is currently work
ing as a social worker at the
Intertribal Friendship House
in Oakland, California.
Hualapai Indians, she says,
"don't get near them (bones)
or touch them — you might
bring the spirit of the per
son. You never know what
kind of spirit it is."
Hualapais bury the per
sonal belongings along with
the body, believing that
humans become attached to
their possessions spiritually.
It is also taboo for Hualapais
to talk of a dead person or
to say their name out loud.
Flood explains that the
spiritual significance of an
event or circumstance
depends on other events and
circumstances, and also
depends on how much one
is in touch with the culture
and spiritual world view.
"The spiritual depends on
other tnings," Flood says.
Flood tells how her mother
reacted when she brought
some bones and artifacts
home one day that were
given to her oy a non-Indian
mend. Flood's mother "didn't
want them anywhere in the
house." Flood was instructed

to get rid of them immedi
ately.
"Elders have a better un
derstanding of these things,"
Flood says. Flood's maternal
grandmother shared her
traditional world view with
her family, and told Flood
and others frightening stories
about the unseen.
Flood can remember being
told stories about the many
Hualapais who died from
interaction with white
people. She was told stories
about people her grand
mother knew, and of others
whose stories were passed
down from one generation to
the next. Consequently, Flood
feels related to Hualapai
people of the past, to the
extent that their memory has
been preserved.
American Indians through
out the country still tell their
creation stories. They relate
tales of the time when
humans and animals could
communicate. They share
stories of how death first
came into the world.
For thousands of years,
through oral tradition, these
beliefs have been passed on,
sustaining a connectedness
with the past. Thus relation
ships are drawn spiritually
between present-day Indians
and those Indians whose
bones are stored in boxes
and trunks, cellars and base
ments all around the coun
try.
To understand the related
ness felt by American Indians
to the bones of their ances
tors is to understand the
physical/spiritual bond that is
evident in Native American
culture. For further under
standing of our situation one
need only ask, "Would 1 al
low the bones of my
grandparents to be pieces of
someone's science collection?"
Most people would say,
"Never!"

Traditional Native Ameri
can belief views human exis
tence as one process. Living
and dying are joined to
gether, thereby making the
whole of one's life.
It is believed that after
death not only does the spirit
go on to another world and
reality, but an essence of that
spirit remains with the
bones; therefore, bones are
still alive spiritually. They
symbolize the kindred spirit,
and possess a spiritual power
as well.
