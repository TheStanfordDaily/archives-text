## A 						solution for China: creating democracy without capitalism 
### 
IF THERE HAD BEEN civil
war in China, China
would likely have moved
toward full democracy. Re
flecting on this prospect, 1
found 1 had mixed feelings
about a democratic China.
Would a Chinese democ
racy be as irresponsible as
our own? Would it pollute
the earth with reckless aban
don and have a legislature
that perpetually subverted
the public interest for private
gain?
The world's ecosystem is
deteriorating at an ever
increasing rate, and a large
share of the blame belongs to
the United States. It is we
who have pioneered the
energy-intensive economy
and nave positively

renounced, for the past eight
years, all environmental con
cern.
If the Chinese would fol
low our own terribly selfish
conception of "the pursuit of
happiness" and join us in
destroying the Earth, then I
do not want China to be
come democratic.
Imagine if a billion Chi
nese people opted for an
unregulated capitalism like
our own, refusing to tax en
ergy consumption in accord
ance with its external costs.
The vast explosion of indus
try would suck the Earth dry
and spew out the carbon
dioxiae remains.
There are legitimate
reasons to reject our model
of democracy, and it is quite

possible that China's brutal
leaders have, in part, these
legitimate concerns in mind.
China's leaders are clearly
thugs, bent on preserving
their own power, but if there
is common ground to be
found between the Chinese
people and their leaders, the
only hope for it is the public
interest. Let us consider,
then, what common ground
there can be between a lead
ership with an anti
bourgeoisie view of the
public interest and a people
who want liberty.
Liberalization probably
leads inexorably to democra
cy, but if China's leaders are
afraid of what democracy
would choose, they can use
constitutional provisions to

limit the choices.
To forstall a rush to
capitalism, constitutional
provisions could be used to
place limits on the ownership
of private property and the
means of production. Other
provisions could codify other
goals and values.
If the Communists chose
wisely, they could, through
this method, allow political
liberalization and still do
more to control China's di
rection than a dictatorship
now could.
It would not be un
democratic for communists to
insist that it take more than
a simple majority, but some
thing closer to unanimity (as
a constitutional amendment
process requires) to reject an

articulated set of responsibili
ties toward the future. Re
quirements of social justice
could also be insisted on as a
defense of others.
If communism does have,
at heart, a venerable set of
values, then it can become
the basis for a democratic
constitution. Truth has noth
ing to fear from freedom.
My advice to the Chinese
people is: start circulating
draft constitutions that codify
communism's goals and
values. Take the communist
high ground away from the
Communist leadership. If
they ever decide they want it
back, you will have won.
