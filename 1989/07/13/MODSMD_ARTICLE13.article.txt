# Treasure Hunt
## SEARCH FOR 'THE BLACK EYES OF ORPHEUS'!! 
### 
Welcome! In the spirit of summer, we at The Weekly have
decided to play a game and involve our readers. Please accept our
challenge.
Somewhere on or near the Stanford campus, we have hidden a
box of "treasure." We won't tell you what it includes just yet.
(Pssst! It's rumored that The Weekly "treasure," called "The

Black Eyes of Orpheus" by "ancient legend," includes ... a video
tape copy of the classic film "Treasure of the Sierra Madre"!)
In the following seven weeks, we will print clues in a clearly
marked box (or clearly-marked boxes!) somewhere in The Week
ly. Together, these clues will lead you to . . . "TREASURE."
Happy hunting! "X" marks the spot! Good luck!
