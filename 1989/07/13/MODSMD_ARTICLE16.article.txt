One of the staples of summer is the action
movie. It must be very entertaining and very
forgettable. If that was the ambition of Richard
Donner, director of "Lethal Weapon II," he
succeeded on both counts.
Do not go see this movie if you want an
intellectual challenge, of course. At every point
it begs the tough moral questions it teasingly
raises. The ostensible theme — the corruption
of the South African government — is given
nothing but the knee-jerk "good guys vs. bad
guys" approach.
The focus is definitely on Danny Glover and
Mel Gibson, whose identities are so strong that
no one knows their characters' names. And it
seems that they have picked the South African
theme merely so they can unite audiences in
hatred, giving the good guys free reign to blow
the South Africans to smithereens.
Okay, now you know that the film will not
prove illuminating. But if you are up for two
hours of escape, whether from the heat or your
summer routine, and you are not offended by
gratuitous violence, or if in fact gratuitous
violence sounds intriguing, see a psychiatrist
— I mean, see this movie. Because essentially
it is well-made, well-paced and rarely dull.
The very spontaneous rapport between
Glover and Gibson in the original "Lethal
Weapon" has been dulled a little by success.
They know they are funny together, and some
times it is hard to tell if Gibson is too manic
to be convincingly manic. But their perform
ances arc fresher than those of most cops-and
robbers movies (or, in recognition of the trend,
should we say "cops and drug dealers"?).
Don't be discouraged by the opening car

chase, which is about as clich&i
as you can imagine, complete with
a helicopter.
The second car chase (yes, an
other one) is a surprising improve
ment. It's exciting, and witty to
boot.
Unfortunately, the movie gives
up Glover's family in favor of Gib
son's romance with the bad guy's
beautiful secretary. And so the
movie forsakes the source of a lot
of the first film's humor — the
tension between Glover's domestic
life and the firing line, which is
symbolized in this film by the sta
tion wagon they drive in the chase
scenes. In fact, Glover's infec
tiously funny family leaves the

movie altogether early in the
movie, never to reappear.
So if you have an extra six
bucks and you want to put your
brain on hold for two hours, go
see this movie. Donner might bite
off more than he can chew, but
in the action-adventure genre, I
guess that's better than too little.
