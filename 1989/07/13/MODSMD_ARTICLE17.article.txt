# Goode provokes thought
## Joe Goode Company's dances link love and nature 
### Karen Kramer Staff writer 
With his "Disaster Series," ver
satile choreographer, dancer and
former Stanford lecturer Joe Goode
combines dancing, acting,
monologues and poetry in a
strange, delightfully thought
provoking performance.

In one scene, two
dancers portray
love as a landslide.

The 10 scenes — short danced
dramas — compel the audience
to experience the frailty and suf
fering of their human existence.
The six-member cast depicts a va
riety of disasters — hurricane,
dustbowl and tidal wave. Through
out the performances, Goode
metaphorically entwines natural
disasters with painful human ex
periences.
In one scene, two dancers
portray love as a landslide. They
roll down each other's backs, vi
brate and flatten themselves
against the wall to illustrate the
feeling of lost control.
The dancers' use of their voices
is one of the striking features of
the show. In another scene that
explored a male-female relation
ship, the two dancers engaged in
a dialogue of grunts and moans
that conveyed the build-up and
disappointment of their cxpecta

tions.
One scenc featured a dancer
about to leap from a chair, and
each time she uttered the word
"jump" in a different pitch, she
projected a different meaning,
ranging from suicidal despair to
joyful liberation.
Goode demonstrates an un
canny ability to extract his inner
feelings and put them on display
for the audience. His abandon in
exposing himself is marvelous; he
allows his body and facial expres
sions to twist into unflattering
contortions during monologues.
Goode's mastery at combining
drama with dance brought him to
Stanford to teach the "Movement
for Actors" class as a guest in
structor spring quarter. The
course, which hones students' act
ing presence and teaches them to
project physically, is usually taught
by a dance instructor.
However, as faculty member
Janice Ross commented, Goode's
skill in "straddling the two
domains of dance and drama"
made him uniquely qualified to
teach the class. In appreciation of
his talents, the dance department
has invited him to return to teach
a class next winter quarter.

"Disaster Series" plays July 13 to
16 at Theater Artaud, 450 Florida
St., San Francisco. Performances
start at 8:30. Tickets are $12 Thurs
day and Sunday, and $14 Friday
