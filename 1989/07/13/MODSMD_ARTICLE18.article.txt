# 'Mind Bomb' looks reality in the face
## 
### Jeff Hsu 
My CD collection has grown
over the past couple years into a
reflection of my taste. Some al
bums arc never touched. Some
albums get played once in a while
for variety's sake. And the better
albums are played over and over
again.
"Mind Bomb" belongs to a class
altogether separate from the rest.
This is music that is a reflection
of my needs. Matt Johnson's The
The has produced a sound that is
cold as ice and sharp as broken
glass. In the present sickening state
of popular music, "Mind Bomb"
sticks out like a jewel, one with
many more edges than you might
hear upon first listen.
"Mind Bomb" is Johnson's an
swer to the world, a world he sees
as going nowhere or even worse,
backwards. This time he works
with Johnny Marr (of The Smiths),

James Eller and David Palmer to
create a new sound.
Johnson has a keen eye for
seeing the many faces of things.
There are songs about love and
relationships but there are no "love
songs." There is love. But there
is also hate.
The album begins with "Good
Morning Beautiful," a philosophi
cal roller coaster, an acoustic
mousetrap. If you don't watch
yourself, this will fry your brain.
Then "The Beat(en) Generation"
takes an insightful look at youth
today; their future and their past.
In "August and September," a
song about broken love and the
pain of retrospection, we can see
how honest to the heart Johnson's
music is. The song is of despera
tion and you can really feel it. In
it he admits:

"But what kind of man was I?/
Who would sacrifice your happi
ness, to satisfy his pride,/ What
kind of man was 17 Who would
delay your destiny, to appease his
tiny mind."
These arc not love lyrics. These
arc pains of the soul.
But however dark Johnson's
music may be, it is not entirely
hopeless. His lyrics provide a sign
of life and triumph every now and
then — and only where appropri
ate. Johnson cuts through to the
bone and he leaves no room for
false fronts or euphemisms. He
sings from his inner self, and that
is truly a rarity in today's music
world.
I very strongly recommend
"Mind Bomb" to everyone. Those
who already know Johnson's work
will appreciate the new sound with
no loss of loyalty. For those who
do not know his work, the oppor
tunity is always there.
