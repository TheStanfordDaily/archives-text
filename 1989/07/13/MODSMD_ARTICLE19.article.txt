# Theater Review
## 'Chorus Line' revival strikes a poignant chord 
### Mark Pinkus 
In a summer filled with se
quels, audiences have been
leaving theaters with an urge tor
the real thing. Last week the
Orphcum in San Francisco chal
lenged the sequel mania by
resurrecting the Tony
Award-winning musical "A
Chorus Line."
Rather than appearing nostal

gic like other rcccnt revivals, "A
Chorus Line" seems more rele
vant now than when it was orig
inally conceived. The feelings of
fame and fortune, coupled with
the notion of mere survival, ring
truer than ever when seen in
relation to the overamhitious
'80s.
In the musical's first run in
1975, most of the character
portraits shocked audiences with

frank talk about subjects like
homosexuality and a woman's
body. It was primarily the
humorous side of the personal
anecdotes that made public re
sponse as strong and favorable
as it was.
Foutccn years later, the
novelty of such subjects has
worn off and they have become
the prevalent issues of the times.
