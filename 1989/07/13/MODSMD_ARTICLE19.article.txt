# Theater Review
## 'Chorus Line' revival strikes a poignant chord 
### Mark Pinkus 
In a summer filled with se
quels, audiences have been
leaving theaters with an urge tor
the real thing. Last week the
Orphcum in San Francisco chal
lenged the sequel mania by
resurrecting the Tony
Award-winning musical "A
Chorus Line."
Rather than appearing nostal

gic like other rcccnt revivals, "A
Chorus Line" seems more rele
vant now than when it was orig
inally conceived. The feelings of
fame and fortune, coupled with
the notion of mere survival, ring
truer than ever when seen in
relation to the overamhitious
'80s.
In the musical's first run in
1975, most of the character
portraits shocked audiences with

frank talk about subjects like
homosexuality and a woman's
body. It was primarily the
humorous side of the personal
anecdotes that made public re
sponse as strong and favorable
as it was.
Foutccn years later, the
novelty of such subjects has
worn off and they have become
the prevalent issues of the times.
At the July 5 opening, the cos
mopolitan crowd reacted in a
much more reflective style, allow
ing the stark truth of the charac
ters' situations to really register.
When working with such a
strong script, it becomes virtually
impossible to pull off a bad per
formance. There were times,
though, when the production did
hinder the gifted material. The
lighting failed to effectively cap
ture certain scenes, while the live
orchestra was dominated by an
electric guitar which overpowered
the other instruments.
It was a treat to sec Donna
McKechnie revive her original
award-winning role as Cassie, but
the years have set in, forcing her

to come up with a less than in
spiring dance routine during her
solo, "The Music and the Mirror."
The highlight of the show came
from Anna Simonelli, a virtual un
known with no Broadway experi
ence. Her role as Diana, which
included her solo "Nothing," was
perfomed with the honest exper

tisc the part required.
Other bright spots were Porfiero
as Paul San Marcos, the gay Puerto
Rican character — who was based
on one of the principal writers of
the play — and Randy Clements
as Zach, the paternal director in
charge of choosing just eight
performers from the original 24 to
be in the chorus.
With its topicality, not to men
tion its cleverness, it is no wonder
that "A Chorus Line" continues
to meet with sold-out crowds in
every city it visits. While the char
acters express their inevitable
doom as they ponder a time when
they no longer dance, the audience
can at least rest assured that "A
Chorus Line" will be around a
long, long time.

"A Chorus Line" played at the Or
pheum from July 5 to 9.
