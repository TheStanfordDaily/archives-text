# 'Beach Blanket pleasingly puns and prances

### Karen Kramer Staff writer 
Hats off to the zany musical revue
"Beach Blanket Babylon Goes Around
the World." The gargantuan hats make
up the funniest part of the show. Char
acters parade around the stage with
everything from a four-foot palm tree
to a huge carton ot take-out chop suey
on their heads.
The show loosely revolves around the
quest of Dorothy, who leaves the
emerald city of San Francisco to find
love and marriage because there are no
"available hot dudes in the city."
This June marks the 15th anniversary
of "Bcach Blanket Babylon," which
makes it the longest running musical
revue in history, according to publicist
Karolyn Raush. Since 1974 director Steve
Silver has run 10 different versions, all
with the theme of a protagonist search
ing for love.
The slapstick humor of this version's
script is entertaining, but probably would

not engage the audience without the
masterful costuming and high energy of
the performers. Although the cast only
consists of 10 actors, they take on mul
tiple character roles, ranging from a
dancing poodle to King Tut.
The costumes alone are a work of
art. In fact, in 1988, the de Young
Museum honored the show's original
costuming with an 11-week exhibition
titled "Beach Blanket Babylon — 15
Years of Hats and Costumes."
The costumes accentuate the show's
themes with wit throughout the per
formance. In one scene, Dorothy meets
a prostitute who is glitzily dressed with
a four-foot lamppost attached to her
head. She tells Dorothy that men go
for "trashy" women. Taking her advice,
Dorothy reappears on stage with a giant
trash can for a headdress, and she and
the other characters spontaneously break
into a can-can.
An abundance of puns and twists on
well-known songs move the show from
one scene to the next. At one point

the characters, dressed as seaweed
wrapped fish, sing "If You Knew Sushi
Like I Knew Sushi" to the tunc of "If
You Knew Suzy Like I Knew Suzy."
Although the acting is less impressive
than the costumes, a few of the imper
sonations and singing performances
stand out. J.D. Michael brilliantly
parodies Prince with comical yelps and
hip gyrations. The portrayals of Judy
Garland, Oprah Winfrey and Bruce
Springsteen are also top-notch.
Older versions, like "Beach Blanket
Babylon Goes to the Stars," featured
impersonations of then-popular figures
such as John Travolta; now new char
acters like Tammy Faye Bakker and the
Church Lady make their appearances.

"Beach Bbnket Babylon" runs at Club
Fugazi at 678 Green Street in San Fran
cisco. Performances are Wednesdays and
Thursdays at 8 p.m., Fridays and Saturdays
at 8 p.m. and 10:30 p.m., and Sundays
at 3 p.m. Club Fugazi serves beer and
wine during the night shows, so bring ID.
