## What does Bo know? 
### 
Bo knows baseball.
The 60th Midsummer Classic
opened in grand fashion when
Rick "Big Daddy" Rcuschel
grooved one of his patented slow
balls and Vincent Edward "Bo"
Jackson reversed it 448 feet to
dead centcr.

For good measure, Jackson
added another RBI, a stolen base
and a fine catch in the outfield.
He was named the game's Most
Valuable Player. Oh, what an All-
Star debut for the Kansas City
Royals left fielder.
Bo knows football.
Alas, he docs. As Brian Bos
worth can attest. Even though he
only plays half a season for the
Los Angeles Raiders, Jackson is
one of the better running backs
in the league.
When the erstwhile Hcisman
Trophy winner takes to the
gridiron he seems quite at home.
And it's too bad.
It's not that watching Bo play
football isn't fun. It's just that nag
ging feeling, that if-only-he'd-give
up-that-silly-hobby feeling .. .
Bo knows the strike zone.
This is a headline you will not
see in the paper tomorrow. Maybe
(probably?) you'll be able to say
that in the future. Today, though,
Bo still swings at a lot of bad
pitches.
And he still fails to cut down
on his swing with two strikes on
him to avoid striking out.
There is no doubt he can im
prove (already, his discipline at
the plate is miles ahead of where
it was his rookie year).
Bo knows his future.
He knows that someday he'll
have to make a choice between
baseball and football (and tennis
and basketball and hockey and
socccr and cricket and ...). The
key is when that someday arrives.
After seeing what he's already
accomplished on the baseball dia
mond (tape measure homers
galore, The Throw, etc.), one can
only dream of what is yet to come
(50-50? scoring from first on a
groundout? breaking a bat with
his teeth?). One can only hope
that Bo sticks with baseball.
There he can break new ground
without busting up his knees.
Bo does know Diddley.
And a hell of a lot more.
Perhaps Tony Gwynn, not ex
actly chopped liver himself, put it
best: "In today's game, you don't
see a lot of guys who can do
everything above average," he said.
"(Bo's) 6-foot-l, 225 pounds, runs
like the wind, got a cannon for
an arm and looks like he's becom
ing more knowledgable at the
plate."
He also looks like he's having
a lot of fun out there as he learns
to put his amazing tools to better
use every day.
Bo knows he'll give up football.
Doesn't he?
