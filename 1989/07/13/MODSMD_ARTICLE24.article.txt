# Blackhawks win at Maloney; move into first place

### Mark Rogowsky Sports editor 
Saturday's Western Socccr
League match between the San
Francisco Bay Blackhawks and Ar
izona Condors was played on
familiar turf for the two Stanford
stars who are plying their trade

for the Blackhawaks this summer.
And, for Mark Semioli and
Rhett Harty the homecoming was
a good one as San Francisco bested
the Condors 3-1 and moved into
first place in the league's Northern
Division.
The win gave the Blackhawks
(9-4, 83 points) nine points —

six for the win and one for each
goal scored up to the three —
and pushed them ahead of
Portland (9-3, 77). The squad has
three more league matches — July
14 and 15 at Seattle and Portland,
respectively, and July 23 against
Seattle at Newark Memorial High
School.

The Blackhawks started quickly,
bringing the home crowd of 2,816
— one of the largcrst to watch
the team in the Bay Area — to
its feet with a goal 3 minutes and
10 seconds into the game. Steve
Corpening, the WSL's leading
scorer, did the damage.
Dominic Kinnear would score
the next two goals for the Black
hawks, the first coming 13:30 into
the game and the second 13:20
into the second half.
The Condors' Mark Kerlin
eventually scored a meaningless
goal with just under five minutes
to play to cut the margin to two.
The story for the Blackhawks
was defense and both Semioli and

Harty were key contributors.
Semioli, a senior All-America can
didate at sweeper, kept the Con
dors at bay all game.
Harty, who led the Cardinal in
scoring as a freshman last year,
has been playing fullback for the
the Blackhawks. I le covered Ker
lin and shut him down through
most of the game.
"Steve and Dominic camc
through for us on offense, as
usual," Blackhawks Coach Dean
Wurzberger said. "And we got a
great defensive effort out of John
Doyle and Rhett Harty. They did
an outstanding job."
