### Mark Rogowsky Sports editor 
Saturday's Western Socccr
League match between the San
Francisco Bay Blackhawks and Ar
izona Condors was played on
familiar turf for the two Stanford
stars who are plying their trade

for the Blackhawaks this summer.
And, for Mark Semioli and
Rhett Harty the homecoming was
a good one as San Francisco bested
the Condors 3-1 and moved into
first place in the league's Northern
Division.
The win gave the Blackhawks
(9-4, 83 points) nine points —

six for the win and one for each
goal scored up to the three —
and pushed them ahead of
Portland (9-3, 77). The squad has
three more league matches — July
14 and 15 at Seattle and Portland,
respectively, and July 23 against
Seattle at Newark Memorial High
School.

The Blackhawks started quickly,
bringing the home crowd of 2,816
— one of the largcrst to watch
the team in the Bay Area — to
its feet with a goal 3 minutes and
10 seconds into the game. Steve
