# Green dismisses Mannini, Gilmete
## 
### Mark Rogowsky Sports editor 
Football Coach Denny Green dropped the axe
yesterday on Dick Mannini and Jack Gilmete. And,
in firing the two assistant coaches, severed nearly
all remaining ties to the Jack Elway era.
Green announced their replacements as well.
Taking over for Gilmete and coaching the outside
linebackers is Dave Tipton, a Stanford football alum.
Tipton played defense on the famed Thunderchick
ens team that won the Pacific 10 Conference title
in 1970 and the Rose Bowl in 1971 — one of the
most glorious eras in Cardinal gridiron history.
He went on to play professionally for six years
with the New York Giants, San Diego Chargers and
Seattle Seahawks.
Mannini, the former defensive coordinator who
was the inside linebacker coach for Green, is being
replaced by Mike Tollcson, a man with an impressive
resume. Tolleson was most recently the defensive
line coach for the Birmingham Stallions of the now
defunct United States Football League.
He also served as inside linebacker coach under
Notre Dame's Lou Holtz when Holtz was at Arkansas.
The dismissal of Mannini was a big surprise. When
Elway was fired, Mannini became a top choice for
the head coaching position among the players. That
combined with his five years at Stanford played a
significant role in Green's initial decision to keep
him on board.
Gilmete had been here for the past three years.
The firings leave assistant offensive line coach Chris
Foerster as the only former Elway assistant still on
the staff. Last season was Focrstcr's first at Stanford.
"This was a tough decision," Green said, "but I
feel this shake-up was necessary because the
chemistry was just not working the way I would
have liked. There is no doubt that the timing of
this decision is most difficult. "We must always
be willing, however, to do what is necessary to make
a positive impact on the team — regardless of the
time of year.

"At the same time, I'm very
much looking forward to the future
with Dave Tipton and Mike Tol
leson as members of our staff,"
Green continued. "Dave Tipton
brings a great reputation as an
intense and motivating position
coach. His entire career . . .
typifies that intensity.
"Dave did an outstanding job
at working with the Oregon State
defense last year," Green said. 7 ip
ton served as the defensive line
coach for the Beavers.
"I was very happy to coach at
Oregon State," Tipton said. "But
to coach at my alma mater is like
a dream come true. I couldn't turn
down Denny Green. In fact, he's
one of the main reasons I'm here.
Tolleson shared Tipton's enthu
siasm.
"I'm really excited about the
opportunity to work at such a fine
institution as Stanford and to work
with Coach Green," Tolleson said.
