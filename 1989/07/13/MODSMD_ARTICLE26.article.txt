Brian Johnson, the junior start
ing outfielder, has signed a con
tract to play baseball for the New
York Yankees and thus forfeits his
final year of eligibility in that sport.
But, Brian Johnson the backup
quarterback with two years of
eligibility remaining in football,
will return to Stanford this fall. In
so doing, Johnson will follow in
the footsteps of the legendary John
Elway.
The 6-foot-2, 195-pounder was
the Yankees 16th-round pick in
the June draft. He signed last week
and was assigned to New York's
Sarasota, Fla., affiliate in the Gulf
Coast Rookie League.
His final batting average at
Stanford was .296. Last year he
hit .283 with four homers and 23
runs batted in, splitting his time
between first base and the outfield.
Though Johnson played little for
Stanford's first NCAA champion
ship winner in 1987, he was a key
performer for the '88 team that
won the national title.
At quarterback, Johnson has
completed 72 of his 135 passes
for 767 yards. He has also thrown
seven interceptions. Johnson is
currently listed at No. 2 on the
depth chart behind Steve Smith.
He will return to campus Aug.
6, eight days before football prac
tice begins.
