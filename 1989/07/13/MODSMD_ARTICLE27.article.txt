SANTA CLARA — Barb Mctz, Michelle
Griglione and Dede Trimble swam impres
sively in last weekend's Santa Clara Inter
national Invitational swim meet, scoring a
number of high finishes.
Metz, a junior, swam her best race in
the 800-meter freestyle Sunday, avenging
two earlier second-place finishes with a big
win. She scored an eight-second victory
over California Golden Bear Sarah Ander
son in a time of 8:48.59. Sophomore Karen
Kraemer finished third with a time of
9:03.83.
In Saturday's 400-meter freestyle, Metz
swam a 4:21.34, good enough for second
behind Anderson. Kraemer was fifth with
a 4:24.60.
Mctz also was one notch behind Ander
son in Friday's 200-meter freestyle. Her
time of 2:05.81 was a bit over seven-tenths
of a second off the pace.
Griglione was the busiest of the Stanford
swimmers. The junior scored one first, two

seconds, a fifth and a seventh. She also
helped two of the Tarnpure Aquatic Club
teams — composed exclusively of Cardinal
swimmers — to relay victories.
Her highlight came Friday when
Griglione won the 400-meter individual
medley. Griglione's time of 4:53.13 placed
her ahead of Roseville, Calif., native Sum
mer Sanders — a 16-year-old with an in
credibly bright future if this meet is any
indication. Kraemer again placed fourth in
a time of 4:58.54.
Sunday, Griglione was the runner-up in
both the 200-meter individual medley and
the 200-meter butterfly — both of which
were won by Sanders. Griglione recorded
times of 2:21.71 and 2:15.78. In the IM,
Kraemer was again fourth with a 2:23.51.
The versatile Griglione swam the anchor
leg for the Tarnpure 400-meter freestyle
relay team Saturday. She joined Jenna
Johnson, Susannah Miller and Suzy Buck
ovich in winning the event in 3:58.70.
