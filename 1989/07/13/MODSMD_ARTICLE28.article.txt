## Sonic horizons: computers expand musical palette 
### Leta Huang 
Can a computer make music?
Most people would say no, but
composers at Stanford's Center for
Computer Research in Music and
Acoustics would disagree.
CCRMA, pronounced "karma"
and located behind Florence
Moore Hall in the Knoll, is an
internationally-renowned center
for research in the growing inter
disciplinary field of computer
acoustics. It will hold its annual
computer music festival in Frost
Amphitheater on July 19 and 20
at 8:15 p.m.
Computers can imitate tradi
tional instruments or generate
sounds that are novel and fantas
tic. They can sound like a rich,
deep cello, a shrill clarinet or a
space-age photon laser.
Computers expand the sonic
range normally available to com
posers and give them an endless
palette of sound for their work.
Insulting to the ear?
But composers who work with
computers pay a price. Ironically,
while computers expand technical,
mechanistic boundaries, they limit
expressive, musical substance.
According to Perry Cook, a
gradute student in electrical engi
neering affiliated with CCRMA,
composers must be careful to con

sider aesthetics when they utilize
computer technology.
"A lot of programs make inter
esting demos and sounds," says
Cook, "but not good music. Some
things become insulting to the
ear."
For instance, states Cook, a
scale played too quickly has an
unnatural, "computer-like" qual
ity:
"A lot of things can be done
in computer music that defy the
notion of natural sounds," says
Cook. "(The human ear) evolved
to listen to animal threats, not
computer music."
Computers pose other problems
for composers besides those caused
by the nature of the ear.
Sometimes, for instance, a "per
fect" computer and an "imperfect"
performer make a bad combina
tion. Works of computer music
often play back phrases that a live
musician played earlier in the
piece. Any mistake in the initial
phrase, then, potentially can
return to haunt the musician —
a terrifying prospect.
As a consequence, Cook finds
that performers alter their style,
becoming "too cautious." Elements
of expressivity, he says, are lost.
Another danger of computer
music, says Cook, is their ability
to produce "too much sound."

With their new sonic capabili
ties, says Cook, "It is easy to add
noise upon noise and come up
with (what sounds like) gray
paint."
Algorithmic compositions
In addition to expanding the
range of sound a composer can
use in his or her work, computers
can help an artist write music.
CCRMA faculty member Chris
Chafe, for instance, uses algo
rithms to create his distinctive
compositions.
"I create and control computer
processes that shape music in a
sculptural sense," says Chafe.
By using mathematical func
tions, Chafe eliminates the tedious
task of notc-by-note composition.
He programs his computer to "spin
out interesting phrases," then
mixes, matches and molds the
results.
Computer composition also al
lows the composer to actually hear
his or her work many times while
it is being developed. A composer
who works with traditional instru
ments might have the chance to
rehearse only twice before his or
her work is performed, while a
computer music composer can lis
ten to that work again and again,
making changes as desired.
Computers also can easily per

form works that might he too tech
nically demanding for human
musicians. They provide an ac
curacy unattainable with actual in
strumentalists.
Best of both worlds
Despite these benefits, comput
ers will not replace traditional ac
coustic instruments, say CCRMA
composers.
"Fundamentally, we don't know
much about the expressive ele
ments of sound," says Chafe. "Our
analytical techniques are very
crude in terms of discerning the

(nuances)" which the human car
can easily detect.
"A talented violinist can play
one line and practically make you
cry, it's so beautiful," says Winkler.
Computers, he notes, lack this
elusive expressive quality.
To overcome the inadequacies
of computer music, Winkler has
written a composition that utilizes
both computer technology and
human musicality. His work,
"Looking Into a Face," calls for a
live soprano voice, a dancer and
computer accompaniment.

unnatural, "computer-like" qual
ity:
"A lot of things can be done
in computer music that defy the
notion of natural sounds," says
Cook. "(The human ear) evolved
to listen to animal threats, not
computer music."
Computers pose other problems
for composers besides those caused
by the nature of the ear.
Sometimes, for instance, a "per
fect" computer and an "imperfect"
performer make a bad combina
tion. Works of computer music
often play back phrases that a live
musician played earlier in the
piece. Any mistake in the initial
phrase, then, potentially can
return to haunt the musician —
a terrifying prospect.
As a consequence, Cook finds
that performers alter their style,
becoming "too cautious." Elements
of expressivity, he says, are lost.
Another danger of computer
music, says Cook, is their ability
to produce "too much sound."

With their new sonic capabili
ties, says Cook, "It is easy to add
noise upon noise and come up
with (what sounds like) gray
paint."
Algorithmic compositions
In addition to expanding the
range of sound a composer can
use in his or her work, computers
can help an artist write music.
CCRMA faculty member Chris
Chafe, for instance, uses algo
rithms to create his distinctive
compositions.
"I create and control computer
processes that shape music in a
sculptural sense," says Chafe.
By using mathematical func
tions, Chafe eliminates the tedious
task of notc-by-note composition.
He programs his computer to "spin
out interesting phrases," then
mixes, matches and molds the
results.
Computer composition also al
lows the composer to actually hear
his or her work many times while
it is being developed. A composer
who works with traditional instru
ments might have the chance to
rehearse only twice before his or
her work is performed, while a
computer music composer can lis
ten to that work again and again,
making changes as desired.
Computers also can easily per

form works that might he too tech
nically demanding for human
musicians. They provide an ac
curacy unattainable with actual in
strumentalists.
Best of both worlds
Despite these benefits, comput
ers will not replace traditional ac
coustic instruments, say CCRMA
composers.
"Fundamentally, we don't know
much about the expressive ele
ments of sound," says Chafe. "Our
analytical techniques are very
crude in terms of discerning the

(nuances)" which the human car
can easily detect.
"A talented violinist can play
one line and practically make you
cry, it's so beautiful," says Winkler.
Computers, he notes, lack this
elusive expressive quality.
To overcome the inadequacies
of computer music, Winkler has
written a composition that utilizes
both computer technology and
human musicality. His work,
"Looking Into a Face," calls for a
live soprano voice, a dancer and
computer accompaniment.
