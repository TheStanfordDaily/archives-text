# Hearing ear dog provides friendship and service
## 
### Mark Weiner Editorial staff 
John Interrante is one of the few Stanford
students allowed to bring a dog into the
Green Library stacks.
A fourth year graduate student in elec
trical engineering, John is deaf. His dog
Toby is a "hearing car dog," specially trained
to alert him to specific sounds in his en
vironment.
John and Toby first met in the summer
of 1986. Since then, they have been almost
inseparable.
"I take Toby everywhere," says John.
"When I go to the movies, Toby lays on
my lap. When I go to eat, Toby sits under
my chair. When I go to class, Toby goes
to class. When I go to work in a (computer)
workstation, Toby is there, too."
Crucial sounds
Like their "seeing eye dog" counterparts,
hearing dogs perform a vital service for
their guardians.
Imagine a world in which crucial sounds
are inaudible — in which it is impossible
to hear your telephone ringing, your smoke
detector wailing or even your baby crying.
Hearing dogs alert their guardians to
these vital stimuli. Through special training,
the dogs are conditioned to respond to
sounds by informing masters of their pres
ence and location.
Toby was trained to respond to five dis
tinct sounds: a smoke detector, a door
knock, a doorbell, a phone ring and John's
name. But because John's smoke detector
is wired to a flashing light in his Crothers
Memorial Hall room, Toby currently
responds to only some of the sounds that
he was originally taught.
John can reactivate Toby's response to
sounds for which he was first trained at
any time and also can teach him to respond
to new sounds. He says he will do so when

he moves into another house or apartment.
Born in Urbana, Illinois, John was raised
in Schcncctady, New York and attended a
grammar school for the deaf. Later, he en
rolled in a public high school, making what
he called an "easy academic transition."
Relying on notetakers for his classes and
lip reading in his personal interactions, John
received his undergraduate degree in elec
trical engineering from Rensselaer Polytech
nic Institute in 1985. There, he learned for
the first time of the relatively new possibility
of acquiring a hearing dog (hearing dog
programs began about 10 years ago).
Studious and softspoken, John came to
Stanford in 1986 and received his master
of science in electrical engineering. He also
took his first class in American Sign Lan
guage — "just for fun," he says.
Finding and training a dog
Feeling a need for companionship, John
decided he wanted a hearing dog. He began
to investigate the hearing dog programs he
first encountered at Rensselaer.
He eventually chose a program based in
West Boylston, Massachusetts. Like many
such programs, the one John contacted
operated on a non-profit basis. Not funded
by the government, it existed in part
through organizational and private dona
tions. The Stanford, New York chapter of
the Grange Club funded half of Toby's spon
sorship. Many of the program's hearing dogs
were rescued from animal shelters.
After an interview that evaluated John's
need for a hearing dog and what type of
dog would suit him best, he was paired
with then 10-month-old Toby. Soon after,
John attended a weeklong session in which
he and a trainer taught Toby to respond
appropriately to particular sounds.
Teaching Toby to inform John that some
one was knocking on his door required
John to sit in a chair, one trainer to knock
on a door, and another trainer to stand

just inside the doorway with a food reward.
When Toby ran to the door after one trainer
knocked, the other gave him some food as
a reinforcing reward. After Toby ran back
to John, he received a second food reward.
A vital friendship
Like most states, California guarantees a
deaf person the right to be accompanied
by a guide dog in all public places. Because
of this guarantee, John and Toby have been
apart only on rare occasions: once, for in
stance, when John went to the Great
America amusement park.
"1 had to ask the ride operator to hold
Toby for me, and Toby didn't like being
alone with a stranger in a crowded place,"
says John.
John decided to leave Toby in the car
— the day was drizzly and cool, so there
was no danger of him getting overheated.

"Toby (j us o slept there quietly," he says.
"Last summer, I went to Epcot Center,
(and things were much different)," he con
tinues. "There, the rides were slow and
steady, so I had no problem taking Toby
with me. Toby sat on my lap in the seat
and saw everything we saw. When I went
to Pirate Island, Toby was right there in
the boat — he was a happy dog."
Toby has become John's closest com
panion, and even their smallest interactions
show that dog and master have built a
relationship of trust and affection. Theirs
is a connection that is intensely personal,
a connection based on mutual needs and
offerings.
Together, John and Toby embody the
ability of two species to form a very special
bond of friendship.

are inaudible — in which it is impossible
to hear your telephone ringing, your smoke
detector wailing or even your baby crying.
Hearing dogs alert their guardians to
these vital stimuli. Through special training,
the dogs are conditioned to respond to
sounds by informing masters of their pres
ence and location.
Toby was trained to respond to five dis
tinct sounds: a smoke detector, a door
knock, a doorbell, a phone ring and John's
name. But because John's smoke detector
is wired to a flashing light in his Crothers
Memorial Hall room, Toby currently
responds to only some of the sounds that
he was originally taught.
John can reactivate Toby's response to
sounds for which he was first trained at
any time and also can teach him to respond
to new sounds. He says he will do so when

he moves into another house or apartment.
Born in Urbana, Illinois, John was raised
in Schcncctady, New York and attended a
grammar school for the deaf. Later, he en
rolled in a public high school, making what
he called an "easy academic transition."
Relying on notetakers for his classes and
lip reading in his personal interactions, John
received his undergraduate degree in elec
trical engineering from Rensselaer Polytech
nic Institute in 1985. There, he learned for
the first time of the relatively new possibility
of acquiring a hearing dog (hearing dog
programs began about 10 years ago).
Studious and softspoken, John came to
Stanford in 1986 and received his master
of science in electrical engineering. He also
took his first class in American Sign Lan
guage — "just for fun," he says.
Finding and training a dog
Feeling a need for companionship, John
decided he wanted a hearing dog. He began
to investigate the hearing dog programs he
first encountered at Rensselaer.
He eventually chose a program based in
West Boylston, Massachusetts. Like many
such programs, the one John contacted
operated on a non-profit basis. Not funded
by the government, it existed in part
through organizational and private dona
tions. The Stanford, New York chapter of
the Grange Club funded half of Toby's spon
sorship. Many of the program's hearing dogs
were rescued from animal shelters.
After an interview that evaluated John's
need for a hearing dog and what type of
dog would suit him best, he was paired
with then 10-month-old Toby. Soon after,
John attended a weeklong session in which
he and a trainer taught Toby to respond
appropriately to particular sounds.
Teaching Toby to inform John that some
one was knocking on his door required
John to sit in a chair, one trainer to knock
on a door, and another trainer to stand

just inside the doorway with a food reward.
When Toby ran to the door after one trainer
knocked, the other gave him some food as
a reinforcing reward. After Toby ran back
to John, he received a second food reward.
A vital friendship
Like most states, California guarantees a
deaf person the right to be accompanied
by a guide dog in all public places. Because
of this guarantee, John and Toby have been
apart only on rare occasions: once, for in
stance, when John went to the Great
America amusement park.
"1 had to ask the ride operator to hold
Toby for me, and Toby didn't like being
alone with a stranger in a crowded place,"
says John.
John decided to leave Toby in the car
— the day was drizzly and cool, so there
was no danger of him getting overheated.

"Toby (j us o slept there quietly," he says.
"Last summer, I went to Epcot Center,
(and things were much different)," he con
tinues. "There, the rides were slow and
steady, so I had no problem taking Toby
with me. Toby sat on my lap in the seat
and saw everything we saw. When I went
to Pirate Island, Toby was right there in
the boat — he was a happy dog."
Toby has become John's closest com
panion, and even their smallest interactions
show that dog and master have built a
relationship of trust and affection. Theirs
is a connection that is intensely personal,
a connection based on mutual needs and
offerings.
Together, John and Toby embody the
ability of two species to form a very special
bond of friendship.

John Interrante is one of the few Stanford
students allowed to bring a dog into the
Green Library stacks.
A fourth year graduate student in elec
trical engineering, John is deaf. His dog
Toby is a "hearing car dog," specially trained
to alert him to specific sounds in his en
vironment.
John and Toby first met in the summer
of 1986. Since then, they have been almost
inseparable.
"I take Toby everywhere," says John.
"When I go to the movies, Toby lays on
my lap. When I go to eat, Toby sits under
my chair. When I go to class, Toby goes
to class. When I go to work in a (computer)
workstation, Toby is there, too."
