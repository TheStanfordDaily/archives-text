## Kennell Jackson: enacting change, advancing a discipline 
### Susan McKean Editorial staff 
Kennell Jackson studies hair. He
keeps a journal of interesting hair
sightings.
That's characteristic — he
respects and revels in human dif
ference, experimentation and
creativity.
But Jackson is also a champion
of precise research, thoughtful in
tellectual exchange and academic
excellence.
He is a man who, even after
22 years as a professor at Stanford,
observes the University with both
an acute, critical eye and a warm
appreciation of its human poten
tial.
This spring, Jackson resigned
after nine years as head of the
Afro-American Studies program.
His departure gave rise to ques
tions about the quality and en
durance of the Afro-American
Studies program at Stanford, and
about the University's commit
ment to its advancement.
Although he left chiefly for per
sonal reasons — to work on re
search projects — he says that his
departure was also intended to
provoke the University to pay
more attention and respect to the
program.
Now, a month and a half after
his resignation, Jackson says the
outlook for the program is better,
and he is confident of the Uni
versity's commitment to it.
After his announcement in
June, Jackson says he received

hundreds of phone calls, visits and
messages from people all over the
University and Bay Area — people
he had met in passing, complete
strangers and old friends.
There is no doubt Jackson gets
around. He is a resident fellow in
all-freshman Branner 1 lall. He has
personally advised all the Afro-
American Studies majors each year
for several years. Ile has estab
lished the Undergraduate Scholars

I think that the notion
of the research uni
versity has been ex
ploited at Stanford to
legitimize the lack of
faculty contact with
students.

Program, which arranges individ
ual research opportunities with
professors. He initiated an
Afro-Amcrican speakers series,
along with many other programs,
including "Branner Presents,"
which draws significant national
figures to speak at the dorm in
which he lives.
Jackson received a bachelor's
degree in biology from Hampton
Institute, and holds a Ph.D. in
African history from UC-Los An
geles. He was awarded the Dink
elspicl Award in 1972.
Jackson will continue teaching
next year, and will direct the "Eu
rope and the Americas" track of

Cultures, Ideas and Values during
winter quarter. He is working on
two books — one on East Africa
and one called "50 Great Black
Books," a collection of his essays.
You have said that the Afro-
American Studies program at
Stanford is "good, but not great."
Could you say what would con
stitute a "great" Afro-American
Studies program. 7
If I had to describe an ideal
program, it would have to have
three or four basic components to
it. It would have to have some
thing in the arts, more than likely
in music, or something in sculpture
or painting — but certainly in
music — that's fundamental.
It would have to have a full
span of (courses in) Afro-
American history in North
America that would cover the
early colonial period all the way
through to today. I've found that
people often think of Afro-
American history as (being) very
recent — as consisting of the years
since World War 11.
I would think that you would
have to have someone in sociology
and someone teaching the rela
tionship of sociology and econom
ics. Some of the big questions of
this country arc about the whole
business of the black family, its
economics, childhood labor, edu
cation. All those things are crucial.
1 he other thing that I think
would be very important would be
having a good group of people to
teach literature. There is so much
Afro-American literature, reach
ing all the way back to the 18th
century. In the 19th century, you
find a huge body of literature by
both men and women: slave nar
ratives, Autobiographies, essays,
sermons.'
That would be your core. If
you're moving out from there, it
would help to have people in lan
guage, communications, someone
in the sciences — in medical
sciences, public health sciences or
psychological sciences — where
you would be specializing on some
thing (pertinent to) blacks.
One of the arguments Univer
sity President Donald Kennedy
has offered in defense of the low
number of black faculty members
at Stanford, is that there are
really no black scholars to be
found — or at least not enough
for Stanford to be able to find
and keep them. How do you re
spond to this argument?
I'm not so sure that (Kennedy!
knew that. I'm not so sure we
have any demography about black
scholars in this country, about who
they are and where they are. 1
think it's true that they're not
plentiful.
The thing Kennedy said at
which I took greater umbradge was
not the whole business of the scar
city of black scholars, but his state
ment that they might not meet
the standards of a place like Stan

ford. I just felt that that was the
old argument coming hack — that
even if you had the people, they
wouldn't necessarily he good
enough for a research university
like Stanford.
That's the argument that both
ered me. I wasn't clear what it

It's culture that mediates and moderates
and changes oppression and gives
people the confidence and ability to rise
and change their lives.

was being used for. I hate that
argument when it comes up. It
shows that there is going to he a
fainthearted approach to the
search. You are searching but you
are searching with doubts.
I think this gets around in the
circles of people who are coming
here to be looked at — they know
this. I hope it doesn't go much
further than it did.
What is the outlook for Afro-
American studies now?
I think there will be more people
from the undergraduate popula
tion who will be going into Afro-
American studies in the future.
From the people I've seen here,
students have more commitment.
I see more people doing research
as undergrads, and I see them
having more connection with fac
ulty.
They're seeing that faculty life
is a good life in which you can
have intellectual influence, intel
lectual power — (that you) can
see some of your interests through.
I'm not so sure it's just for
reasons of material incentive, but
for reasons of interest. I sense in
the entire student body slightly
more respect for the arts, for litera
ture, for music, for theater, and I
sense among both white and black
students a little more respect for
the reality of Afro-American
studies.
When I go out now and tell
people I do Afro-American
studies, I find far more interest
from both blacks and whites than
I did five years ago. Ten years
ago, people would have deadpan
expressions on their faces: They
saw this as a highly politicized
field and wondered what on earth
I could be studying.
Some scholars have said that
the field of Afro-American
studies has initiated a revolution
in scholarship, with its emphasis
on material culture and oral his
tories. What do you see as
unique to Afro-American studies
that might be making its way
into other fields?
It's an intetesting field because,
first of all, it's truly interdiscipli
nary. For example, so much of

understanding the literature is
based on knowing the culture, cus
toms, people's beliefs, about lan
guage. It's really hard to look at
the aesthetic achievement in
literature without having to
engage the whole business of cul
tural studies.

Afro-American beliefs about the
spirit world, for example, play sig
nificantly in Toni Morrison's
works, and in Ralph Ellison's work
there's all this about blues and
jazz and black singing and the
power of music among blacks and
how music and ideas in music are
intellectualizcd.
It's not even an interdisciplinary
field in theory, but by necessity.
It compels the scholar to do things
that I don't think (he or she)
always wants to do or is used to
doing.
You have to know a lot more
about society. You have to know
that a historical event in Afro-
America is not just a historical
event, but is filled with Afro-
American historical content. That
means that suddenly, you're
looking at a whole lot of other
pieces of evidence for research. I
think it is one of the truly mul
tidisciplinary ventures of our
times, in a way.
The other thing that is new
about it in terms of methodology
is that you really have to talk to
Afro-Americans a lot in order to
do this. It's not something that
you can do in a closet space. You
really have to know what Afro-
Americans are doing and how they
see their history.
Afro-American research is
widening the range of research.
It's making research a more shared
experience involving all of the cul
tures, societies, the peoples. It's a
field that must be reconstructed
from a kind of oral discourse. And
I think people will see the models
of the research in this field and
pick up on the methods for re
search in other areas.
What is your position on the
benefit of separating Afro-
American studies into its own
program, as opposed to integrat
ing the study of Afro-American
culture into the rest of the cur
riculum?
It would be good it American
history classes had some material
from the Afro-American perspec
tive — that's important. But I
think it's important to remember
that for a long time nobcxly from
