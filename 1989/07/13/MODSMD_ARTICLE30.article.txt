## Kennell Jackson: enacting change, advancing a discipline 
### Susan McKean Editorial staff 
Kennell Jackson studies hair. He
keeps a journal of interesting hair
sightings.
That's characteristic — he
respects and revels in human dif
ference, experimentation and
creativity.
But Jackson is also a champion
of precise research, thoughtful in
tellectual exchange and academic
excellence.
He is a man who, even after
22 years as a professor at Stanford,
observes the University with both
an acute, critical eye and a warm
appreciation of its human poten
tial.
This spring, Jackson resigned
after nine years as head of the
Afro-American Studies program.
His departure gave rise to ques
tions about the quality and en
durance of the Afro-American
Studies program at Stanford, and
about the University's commit
ment to its advancement.
Although he left chiefly for per
sonal reasons — to work on re
search projects — he says that his
departure was also intended to
provoke the University to pay
more attention and respect to the
program.
Now, a month and a half after
his resignation, Jackson says the
outlook for the program is better,
and he is confident of the Uni
versity's commitment to it.
After his announcement in
June, Jackson says he received

hundreds of phone calls, visits and
messages from people all over the
University and Bay Area — people
he had met in passing, complete
strangers and old friends.
There is no doubt Jackson gets
around. He is a resident fellow in
all-freshman Branner 1 lall. He has
personally advised all the Afro-
American Studies majors each year
for several years. Ile has estab
lished the Undergraduate Scholars

ploited at Stanford to
legitimize the lack of

Program, which arranges individ
ual research opportunities with
professors. He initiated an
Afro-Amcrican speakers series,
along with many other programs,
including "Branner Presents,"
which draws significant national
figures to speak at the dorm in
which he lives.
Jackson received a bachelor's
degree in biology from Hampton
Institute, and holds a Ph.D. in
African history from UC-Los An
geles. He was awarded the Dink
elspicl Award in 1972.
Jackson will continue teaching
next year, and will direct the "Eu
rope and the Americas" track of

Cultures, Ideas and Values during
winter quarter. He is working on
two books — one on East Africa
and one called "50 Great Black
Books," a collection of his essays.
You have said that the Afro-
American Studies program at
Stanford is "good, but not great."
Could you say what would con
stitute a "great" Afro-American
Studies program. 7
If I had to describe an ideal
program, it would have to have
three or four basic components to
it. It would have to have some
thing in the arts, more than likely
in music, or something in sculpture
or painting — but certainly in
music — that's fundamental.
It would have to have a full
span of (courses in) Afro-
American history in North
America that would cover the
early colonial period all the way
through to today. I've found that
people often think of Afro-
American history as (being) very
recent — as consisting of the years
since World War 11.
I would think that you would
have to have someone in sociology
and someone teaching the rela
tionship of sociology and econom
ics. Some of the big questions of
this country arc about the whole
business of the black family, its
economics, childhood labor, edu
cation. All those things are crucial.
1 he other thing that I think
would be very important would be
having a good group of people to
teach literature. There is so much
Afro-American literature, reach
ing all the way back to the 18th
century. In the 19th century, you
find a huge body of literature by
both men and women: slave nar
ratives, Autobiographies, essays,
sermons.'
That would be your core. If
you're moving out from there, it
would help to have people in lan
guage, communications, someone
in the sciences — in medical
sciences, public health sciences or
psychological sciences — where
you would be specializing on some
thing (pertinent to) blacks.
One of the arguments Univer
sity President Donald Kennedy
has offered in defense of the low
number of black faculty members
at Stanford, is that there are
really no black scholars to be
found — or at least not enough
for Stanford to be able to find
and keep them. How do you re
spond to this argument?
I'm not so sure that (Kennedy!
knew that. I'm not so sure we
have any demography about black
scholars in this country, about who
they are and where they are. 1
think it's true that they're not
plentiful.
The thing Kennedy said at
which I took greater umbradge was
not the whole business of the scar
city of black scholars, but his state
ment that they might not meet
the standards of a place like Stan

ford. I just felt that that was the
old argument coming hack — that
even if you had the people, they
wouldn't necessarily he good
enough for a research university
like Stanford.
That's the argument that both
ered me. I wasn't clear what it

It's culture that mediates and moderates
and changes oppression and gives
people the confidence and ability to rise
and change their lives.

was being used for. I hate that
argument when it comes up. It
shows that there is going to he a
fainthearted approach to the
search. You are searching but you
are searching with doubts.
I think this gets around in the
circles of people who are coming
here to be looked at — they know
this. I hope it doesn't go much
further than it did.
What is the outlook for Afro-
American studies now?
I think there will be more people
from the undergraduate popula
tion who will be going into Afro-
American studies in the future.
From the people I've seen here,
students have more commitment.
I see more people doing research
as undergrads, and I see them
having more connection with fac
ulty.
They're seeing that faculty life
is a good life in which you can
have intellectual influence, intel
lectual power — (that you) can
see some of your interests through.
I'm not so sure it's just for
reasons of material incentive, but
for reasons of interest. I sense in
the entire student body slightly
more respect for the arts, for litera
ture, for music, for theater, and I
sense among both white and black
students a little more respect for
the reality of Afro-American
studies.
When I go out now and tell
people I do Afro-American
studies, I find far more interest
from both blacks and whites than
I did five years ago. Ten years
ago, people would have deadpan
expressions on their faces: They
saw this as a highly politicized
field and wondered what on earth
I could be studying.
Some scholars have said that
the field of Afro-American
studies has initiated a revolution
in scholarship, with its emphasis
on material culture and oral his
tories. What do you see as
unique to Afro-American studies
that might be making its way
into other fields?
It's an intetesting field because,
first of all, it's truly interdiscipli
nary. For example, so much of

understanding the literature is
based on knowing the culture, cus
toms, people's beliefs, about lan
guage. It's really hard to look at
the aesthetic achievement in
literature without having to
engage the whole business of cul
tural studies.

Afro-American beliefs about the
spirit world, for example, play sig
nificantly in Toni Morrison's
works, and in Ralph Ellison's work
there's all this about blues and
jazz and black singing and the
power of music among blacks and
how music and ideas in music are
intellectualized.
It's not even an interdisciplinary
field in theory, but by necessity.
It compels the scholar to do things
that I don't think (he or she)
always wants to do or is used to
doing.
You have to know a lot more
about society. You have to know
that a historical event in Afro-
America is not just a historical
event, but is filled with Afro-
American historical content. That
means that suddenly, you're
looking at a whole lot of other
pieces of evidence for research. I
think it is one of the truly mul
tidisciplinary ventures of our
times, in a way.
The other thing that is new
about it in terms of methodology
is that you really have to talk to
Afro-Americans a lot in order to
do this. It's not something that
you can do in a closet space. You
really have to know what Afro-
Americans are doing and how they
see their history.
Afro-American research is
widening the range of research.
It's making research a more shared
experience involving all of the cul
tures, societies, the peoples. It's a
field that must be reconstructed
from a kind of oral discourse. And
I think people will see the models
of the research in this field and
pick up on the methods for re
search in other areas.
What is your position on the
benefit of separating Afro-
American studies into its own
program, as opposed to integrat
ing the study of Afro-American
culture into the rest of the cur
riculum?
It would be good if American
history classes had some material
from the Afro-American perspec
tive — that's important. But I
think it's important to remember
that for a long time nobody from

the rest of the University was
really interested in making any
overtures to these programs.
I don't know if I would call it
isolation, but some of the com
partmentalization that has grown
up around these programs is be
cause other departments didn't
care about us. I can remember
many instances when people
would invite speakers that would
certainly have been of interest to
us, and we wouldn't know any
thing about them.
So, when people talk about iso
lation of the department, you have
to add up who's been responsible
for it. While I was head of Afro-
American Studies we wanted allies
in other intellectual areas. And it
was very hard to find them. People
just did not sec any natural link
between Afro-American studies
and their concerns.
Things have not changed as
rapidly as they should have in
terms of doors opening in the Uni
versity. I'm not sure why: whether
it was the political origins of the
field, whether it was about black
people, or whether it was because
the program was small.
Perhaps it was because in the
'80s, people in the administration
really didn't talk about (black is
sues) that much and therefore
didn't reinforce the validity of
(Afro-American studies). Maybe it
was just a natural parochialism of
the other faculty.
At this university (the cautious
approach to Afro-American
studies) may have stemmed from
the coming of the Western Culture
program in 1980. I always thought
that was a major force that shook
the reality in which we lived. 1
think it set a tone that said the
European studies would be most
important.
Students began to think these
fields were marginal because they
were always the fields you took
to compensate for having to take
Western Culture. It was always the
token field that you added.
I felt that Western Culture set
in motion a period of indifference
to things like Afro-American
studies. Some people think that
the Cultures, Ideas and Values
program will serve to infuse black
studies issues into the curriculum.
Some people think the emphasis
of CIV is so multicultural, sort of
like an ethnic meltdown, that
there won't be a distinctive black
intellectual flavor to anything in
the CIV curriculum. They see it
encouraging a homogenization of
all the minorities. I don't know
how it .vill work out.
Could you comment on the
development of minority studies
at the University?
This is a very tricky question.
I am very much in favor of all
these minority studies (programs).
I think that universities in this
part of the world have got to have
a substantial representation of this.
But I don't want to see "ethnic
studies" used as an umbrella. It

means that the distinctiveness of
something like Asian-American
history is worn down.
I go to a lot of curriculum meet
ings where people talk about an
Asian book, a Chicano book, a
black book interchangeably.
They're just not interchangeable.
I personally resent the whole
idea that we are ethnic and
whites aren't. Most of my white
friends on the faculty have come
to this country from European eth
nic backgrounds. And yet they are
regarded as American in some way
and we're regarded as ethnic. It's
a continuation of an old ideology
that's quite troublesome.
It seems to me that we're all
American and that we have dif
ferent angles of interaction with
the country and the ideals and
the problems of it. That's the way
we should try to look at it.
I think there should be programs
for the minority groups. But the
administration should not put
them in a position of vying against
each other for resources.
Some people call these pro
grams "affirmative action" meas
ures. How do you respond to
this?
It's sad that so many talented
blacks, Chicanos, women and
other "minorities" have their
quality besmirched by what people
think of affirmative action. Most
people I know who arc from the
so-called affirmative action pool
arc excellent people and make tre
mendous contributions to their de
partments. And I don't know what
their departments would do with
out them in many cases.
I think the other thing that is
important here is that affirmative
action, in my opinion, is going to
drop away as an idea as time goes
on. Once we redefine the sort of
needs of education, we're not
going to see the people we're add
ing for Afro-American studies or
women's studies, for example, as
exceptions. We're not going to sec
them as special interest groups.
We're going to see them as integral
to the total structure of education.
We're not going to be running
around saying, "Oh, we've got to
hire a black who can tell us about
health care delivery in the inner
city." We need to know more about
that: many people are not getting
healthcare. This is creating all
sorts of problems for the rest of
society. This is draining our eco
nomy. This is an important part
of understanding medical care and
delivery today.
If you hired someone who knew
about that, it wouldn't be some
thing you really were compelled
to do. I think as we begin to
broaden the definition of a proper
education, we really will not need
the kind of affirmative action pro
grams we have today.
And if you have fields where
people are really doing dynamic
research, you will need these
people because they will be the
pioneers in the kind of research

I personally resent the whole idea that we are ethnic and
whites aren't. Most of my white friends on the faculty have
come to this country from European ethnic backgrounds.
And yet they are regarded as American in some way and
we're regarded as ethnic. It's a continuation of an old ideol
ogy that's quite troublesome.

that you want your students to
know about, even if it's about this
people or that people.
It's going to happen, and we're
not going to be talking about
hiring people as compensation, or
about whether they are excellent
enough to meet the research de
mands of Stanford University, or
whether they are women or men.
We're going to be dealing with
people here who are intellectually
powerful in their own right, and
who we need to have in order to
provide a complete education.
We're not going to be in the busi
ness of hiring according to affirm
ative action policy. I think I'm
going to live to see that.
What is the status of Afro-
American Studies at Stanford
now?
I think that there is some in
terest in expanding the program.
One of the reasons is that you
just can't offer the bachelor's
degree with the minimal intellec
tual infrastructure that we have.
There simply are not enough
courses to take.
Almost by necessity the Uni
versity will have to expand it, and
get more people in this field in
order to legitimize the bachelor's
degree — it's fundamental to the
University's charter.
I think it's going to be hard,
because I don't think we have
enough of a lure here at Stanford
yet. But we do have resources,

and we do have tremendous un
dergraduates and graduate stu
dents.
You have been a teacher at
Stanford for 22 years. Could you
comment on the quality of teach
ing at Stanford now?
I think that the notion of the
research university has been ex
ploited at Stanford to legitimize
the lack of faculty contact with
sudents. And I'm not so sure that
the time they're not spending with
students is spent on research.
I think Stanford's characteriza
tion as a research university passed
from being an ideology relevant
to the development of the Uni
versity to being a rationalization
of certain kinds of conduct. I think
that it's worse than it used to be.
I also sec some student
boredom, some absenteeism, lack
of morale in the classroom —
people not serious enough about
their work. And I've been in some
classes where I just didn't think
the teaching was that good. I think
the faculty needs to be shaken up
a bit.
One of the things I always feel
is that no one ever gets up in
class and tells people the glory of
the subject they're teaching.
Which means that the students,
I don't think, have a clear under
standing of why the person is en
gaged in it in the first place.
Some people offer the argu
ment that Afro-American studies
and other minority studies are
really just studies in oppression.
What is your response to this
charge?
Minorities, blacks in particular
I think, really have to worry about
people teaching them their history

as just a history of victims,
I always worry about that be
cause having been born in the
South, I could really sec humans
reinventing constraining circum
stances. Blacks have not always
had a lot of space, but they've
made the most of what they had.
I was born into a segregated
society and lived in a black com
munity. But you know, it was
never just a quartered part of the
world with a very severe kind ot
oppressive hand over it, you didn't
feel that way when you were in it.
There were personal histories,
people's achievements, folklore,
jokes and laughter and all sorts
of adventure. There were one
thousand-and-one other things
that made up our lives. It's culture
that mediates and moderates and
changes oppression and gives
people the confidence and ability
to rise and change their lives.
I think blacks have to be very
careful in how they proclaim them
selves to the world and in the
universities. You know, the diffi
culty and complexity is there, but
it's there in all human history.
What you really want to do is put
the human face on the black sit
uation. You want to show the cul
tural readaptation, so that you can
get a sense of how people changed
the world in which they lived.
If oppression was as successful
as sometimes people like to be
lieve, there would be no black
people here. Sometimes I'll read
students' notes, and sometimes it
worries me how black life is taught.
I think people do it with good
intentions, buy they don't teach
the cultural adaption and inven
tiveness.
