## Sun, sand, sea urchins — what more could you ask for? 
### Tanya Paull Editorial staff 
Summer students at Stanford might not
think it could get any better.
A lot of sun, a couple palm trees, a few
interesting things to study — what could
be closer to academic perfection?
Think again.
Just two hours away, on the Monterey
Peninsula, students at Stanford's Hopkins
Marine Station study sea urchins a few feet
from the blue of the Pacific Ocean; examine
algae next to the white sandy beach; and
scuba dive in the cool waters of Monterey.
It doesn't get much better than this.
During the two intensive five-week ses
sions at Hopkins each summer, about 40
graduate, undergraduate and post-doctoral
students from all over the world come to
Monterey to study the cell biology ot de
velopment, the molecular biology of algae,
or scuba diving — taught by a few of
Stanford's distinguished faculty members.
The marine station occupies 11 acres in
Pacific Grove and is a division of Stanford's
Biological Sciences Department.
The students take advantage of their
natural environment, but certainly not to
bask in the sun. Some become so involved
in their research that they are often in the

laboratories for 10 to 11 hours a day, mea
suring enzymes in a certain species of algae
or watching the intricate sequence of events
following the fertilization of a sea urchin
egg-
Profs. Daniel Mazia and David Epel guide
students in the sea urchin development
course, focusing on how the first original
cells in an embryo divide, and how the
cells differentiate.
What biochemical factors stimulate
mitosis — cell division? How do early
embryonic cells interact with each other
and pass on vital information during the
first minutes of life? Students investigate
these mysteries of developmental biology,
and others, while also learning various tech
niques in cell biology and microscopy.
Just a little farther down the beach from
the sea urchin labs, past the wooden office
building that still reads "Monterey Boat
Works" on the front, Profs. Randall Alberte
and Celia Smith oversee students in the
algae biochemistry course.
Algae — just sea slime to most beach
goers — are actually primitive organisms
which make excellent models for the study
of ecology and molecular biology. Students
spend long hours examining the marine
algae, and experimenting with techniques
to separate and identify proteins and nucleic

acids.
Each student in the sea urchin develop
ment course and the algae biochemistry
course spends the last two weeks of the
class doing an independent project — crea
tively demonstrating their newly acquired
knowledge.
Stanford, with its size and facilities, might

come near to academic perfection. But Hop
kins, with its algae, sea urchins and scenic
coastline, comes just as close.
So the next time you visit the Monterey
Bay Aquarium, step next door and sec
what's going on at Hopkins. It might just
give you a view of Stanford you never knew
existed.
