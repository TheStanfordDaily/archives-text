# 'Paradox of cell fate' adds to the mystery of early development
## 
### Tanya Paull Editorial staff 
It's a mystery with twists and turns in which the main
actors change their form.
It's the mystery of the formation of life — how does
one cell divide, grow and evolve .nto an organism like its
parent?
Once an egg is fertilized, its chromosomes — genetic

information — are permanent. When the egg divides into
two, then four, then eventually into millions of cells, the
same genes are passed on to each one. Yet somehow each
develops with its own specialized function.
Dr. Eric Davidson of the California Institute of Tech
nology is one of the foremost researchers in this field of
development and embryology. Davidson visited Hopkins
Marine Station July 7 to give a seminar on gene regulation
in the earliest stages of a sea urchin's life cycle.
For one cell to evolve into a multicellular, multifunc
tional organism, the genes in each kind of cell must be
"turned on" selectively. Although it seems to be one of
the most basic processes necessary for life, this mechanism
— differential gene expression — is one of the least
understood.
Davidson's most recent findings confirm that certain
gene-protein interactions within the nucleus of a cell play
a vital role in determining the "identity" of cells later on
in the life cycle. During the first few cell divisions, some
proteins — called regulatory proteins — "have tags on
them that cause them to be sucked up into the nucleus,"
Davidson said.
These regulatory proteins attach to specific sites on the
DNA and either stimulate or repress the activity of that
gene. But these proteins are only available in sufficient
quantities when the embryo consists of a few cells.
Therefore the most crucial events in gene activation
occur in the early stages of division — during the first

few hours of life. The most crucial and fascinating period
in the creation of an organism is practically over by the
time the embryo has 1,000 cells and different body parts
are already starting to take shape.
With the advent of modern gene cloning techniques
and methods to inject foreign DNA into living animals,
researchers like Davidson are now able to test possibilities
that scientists used to think were beyond their reach.
By manipulating and deleting genetic sequences in this
way, Davidson was able to pinpoint some of the interactions
between genes and regulatory proteins. As expected, he
discovered that some of these proteins are present in
specific locations within the cytoplasm — intracellular
fluid — of the first few original cells.
This means there must be either a continuous gradient
or separation of these protein "messages" in the original
sea urchin egg that eventually leads to differentiation.
One of the most baffling paradoxes in embryology,
however, is the "plasticity" of cells in early development.
Up to a certain point in the early stages of cell division,
despite specific gene regulation, the function of cells can
be changed by interaction with the cells around them.
This phenomenon is even less understood than the
"hard-wiring" of gene expression and, in Davidson's op
inion, "holds the key to the paradox of cell fate."
But as Davidson and other researchers continue with
their experimentation and discoveries, doors to these mys
teries arc steadily being opened.
