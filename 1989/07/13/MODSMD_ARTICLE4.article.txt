## Protesters to receive 40 hours of service 
### Karen Kramer Staff writer 
Forty-seven of the students ar
rested in the takeover of Univer
sity President Donald Kennedy's
office May 15 entered a plea of
no contest June 5 to the charge

of trespassing. District Attorney
Tom Farenholz dropped four other
charges and Judge Stephen Manley
indicated that the sentence will
be 40 hours of community service
and six months probation.
Because none of the 47 ap
peared in court in person, Manley

postponed formal sentencing until
Oct. 6 because he wanted to speak
to the demonstrators in person.
"Pleading no contest admits
there is some factual basis for the
charge, but that you aren't going
to fight it — that you'll accept
penalty. They don't want to deny

their actions. They're proud of
what they did," said Dan Barton,
the attorney for the students
whose protest called for increased
minority attention.
Manley said that the hours of
community service must be
counted separately from the 75
hours of community service the
students received from the Uni
versity in mid-June, although Dean
of Student Affairs James Lyons had
previously said Stanford would al
low the hours to be counted con
currently.
"Overall the students arc
satisfied with the resolution of the
case. What we're not happy with
is the other colleagues who were
singled out for harsher treatment,"
Barton said.
Four other students face the
more serious charge of "obstruct
ing a police officer in performing
a duty." This charge was never
levied against the group of 47.
Barton contends that pressing
stricter charges against four stu
dents "is an attempt to deflect
attention from Louis Jackson.
They realized that it was politically
unwise to single out one black
man.
"To avoid an ugly situation, they
spread the net wider and went
after these four students, when
they could have offered them the
same deal as the one offered to
the rest of the students. They're
grouping those students with Jack
son when they should be grouped
with the others."

In response to Barton's allega
tions, Farcnholz said, "I'm not
going to debate philosophy. I don't
want to make this into a contro
versy." •
Jackson faces the charges of in
citing a riot and battery in addition
to the charges faced by the rest
of the protesters. He was expected
to appear in court yesterday morn
ing to plead not guilty, but did
not go for reasons his attorney,
Joseph Billingsly, said he could not
explain. Jackson has two more pos
sible dates to enter a plea — July
24 or Aug. 25 — according to
Billingsly.
The philosophical issue at stake,
according to Barton, is that "stu
dents should get the same pun
ishment for the same actions. The
University's disciplinary commit
tee deemed that the students
should receive the same punish
ment because they participated in
the same acts.
"Tom Gray and Bob Weisberg
[who headed the University's jud
icial committecl are some of the
finest legal minds in the country.
Obviously, the DA and the judge
don't share their reasoning."
Farenholz maintains that the
four students participated in dif
ferent actions and said "we think
we can prove our charges."
The four students charged with
obstructing an officer plan to enter
their pleas Oct. 6 because they
are not all here over summer and
don't have lawyers, according to
Barton.

Following their arrests May 15, 47 Stanford protesters had their day in court last week.
They pleaded no contest to trespassing and will likely receive a sentence of 40 hours
community service and six months probation.
