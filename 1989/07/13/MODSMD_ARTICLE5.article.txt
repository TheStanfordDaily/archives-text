# It's back to school for teachers
## University preparing for CIV 
### Heather Goodspeed 
While Stanford students are en
joying the end of their summer
vacations, many of their instruc
tors will be going back to school.
Cultures, Ideas and Values will
replace Western Culture this fall,

and the Univer
sity is trying to
prepare the fac
ulty for the new
program.
This September
Stanford will hold
a two-week semi
nar of 10 half-day
sessions for fac
ulty members who

teach CIV. Charles Junkerman, as
sistant dean of undergraduate
studies, said the seminars are "one
of a series of ongoing seminars ...
for the preparation of the faculty
for the teaching challenges that
the program will impose on them."

"One problem that we're faced
with," says Dean of Undergraduate
Studies Thomas Wasow, "is that
most people in the program typ
ically trained in the European
canon arc not as trained for the
new curriculum."
The plan is to in "future years
repeat [the seminar] and expand
out," according to Junkerman. He
expects funding will be available
because of Stanford's conviction
that this is the current "highest
priority need." This year, the semi
nars were paid for out of discre
tionary funds from the offices of
the president and the provost.
Despite all the commotion,
however, the change in curriculum
is very moderate. As they have
since 1980, all students will enroll
in a required yearlong course. CIV
adds to the area covered, but stu
dents will still choose one three
quarter class from among eight
tracks such as Literature and the

Arts or Values, Technology, Sci
ence and Society.
Wasow denies reports that Stan
ford is substituting "non
traditional works for the tradition
al. ... That's simply not the case,"
he said. "Radical changes would
have been unwise. ... We have
given faculty more leeway on what
they have to teach."
Now you will find "a sprinkling
of works you wouldn't have found
in a Western Culture class 20 years
ago. .. . Personally I think that's
healthy," Wasow said.
The seminars will allow the fac
ulty to explore how best to teach
the CIV classes through their own
discussions as well as through visit
ing lecturers.
Three general areas of study —
Islam, black literature and feminist
literature — will be the focus of
the seminars. According to Junkcr-


Wasow
man, these were topics "that might
be areas the faculty are less con
fident in teaching." He added that
concentrating on these three issues
"wasn't our decision, it was [the
faculty's!."
In discussions with faculty
members, the area of feminist
criticism "drew a very positive re
sponse," Wasow said, adding that
there were a lot of questions asked
about Islam. Consequently, much
of the seminar will be devoted to
the Koran.
One feature of the old Western
Culture program that will be miss
ing this fall will be the "core list"
of readings. Faculty will meet to
discuss which readings should be

included in CIV, hut the list will
change yearly.
The decision to implement CIV
was made by the Faculty Senate
at a meeting in March 1988, in
an effort to broaden students' "un
derstanding of ideas and values
from different strands of our own
culture, and to increase their un
derstanding of cultural diversity
and the process of cultural inter
action."
