### Paula Gani Staff writer 
Although the summer months
mean vacation for many students,
those on the newly formed Sexual
Assault Task Force have only
begun their work.
The task force, initiated by the
Rape Education Project and ap
proved by Dean of Student Affairs
James Lyons in early May, has
written the chargc for its commit
tee and chosen most of its mem
bers.
The goal of the task force is
"to promote a University environ
ment in which mutual respect and
heightened sensitivity enable all
students to develop to their full
potential in pursuit of their per
sonal and academic goals," accord

ing to the chargc.
Coordinator David Frazec, a
sophomore, said the membership
selection reflects this goal by "an
institutionalized procedure to get
staff, faculty and students involved
and aware of the issue of sexual
assault."
Co-chaired by junior Suzanne
O'Brien and Health Promotion
Director Patricia Fabiano, the task
force has been considering faculty,
staff and students to be officially
appointed by Lyons in a few weeks.
Staff members already commit
ted to the task force include Alice
Supton, director of Residential Ed
ucation; Ombudsperson Leah
Kaplan; Chris Griffith, assistant
director of graduate residences;
Alejandro Martinez and Cathy
Stevenson of Cowcll Student

Health Center and Stanford Police
Chief Marv Hcrrington. A repre
sentative from the faculty will also
be appointed.
Representatives from REP,
Heightened Education of Ac
quaintancc Rape and the Interfra
tcrnity Council will comprise the
student voice. Frazcc hopes to see
"a lot of work from subcommittees
so people can move in and out."
The task force will meet at least
four times a quarter for 18 months,
working with subcommittees of ap
proximately three-month dura
tions. In this time, its main duty
will be to "develop policies to ed
ucate and respond to rape," said
Frazcc.
Its work will be completed with
a report on campus sexual assault,
nroiectcd for Nov. I. 1990
