Claiming they became nau
seated and sick after being ex
posed to toxic paint fumes from
outside their working space
June 26, workers at Stanford
Linear Accelerator Center have
filed a grievance against their
management through the
United Stanford Workers union.
In the grievance, filed about
two weeks ago, union represen
tatives arc seeking ways to
"tighten the monitoring system"
at SLAC, according to Jim Eg
gleston, the workers' legal coun
sel.
According to Lon Warnekc,
a senior engineer at SLAC and
union official, no precautions
were taken by facilities and
management personnel to warn
the workers of any potential
health hazards of being exposed
to the toxic paint.
According to a "material
safety data sheet" issued by
Tncmec Company, makers of
the paint the workers inhaled,
"Nasal and respiratory irrita
tion, ... dizziness, ... nausea
and headache" may result if sol
vent vapors in the paint are
inhaled.
Lee Lyon, director of person
nel and member of the inves
tigation team, says that two air
quality tests were made the day
of the incident: one during and
one immediately after the paint
ing operation.
Lyon says that results of both
air tests showed that the toxic
vapor concentrations given off
by the paint, although "higher
than we would like," were
within OSHA safety standards.

He also said when SLAC safety
officials discovered the painters
were using spray paint, the
painting was discontinued.
"The danger was to the
painters, not to the workers in
side," he said. "Just because the
workers inside could smell it
doesn't mean it was a safety
hazard."
According to Ei Ling, a safety
officer involved in the investi
gation, the organic vapor con
centrations near the painting
area were 10 times lower than
levels considered safe by federal
regulations.
Although much attention
has been given to the incident
and legal arbitration has been
sought by workers to prevent
future problems like this one,
SLAC officials arc anxious to
bring matters to a close.
"The thing has been blown
completely out of proportion,"
said Finn Halbow, a SLAC
building manager.
"We don't know all the facts
yet," said Doug Dupen, a SLAC
employee relations representa
tive. But Dupen assures workers
that SLAC has "a great concern
with safety" and that if workers
were not informed about toxins
in the paint, then action would
be taken to ensure that such
mishaps would not happen
again.
