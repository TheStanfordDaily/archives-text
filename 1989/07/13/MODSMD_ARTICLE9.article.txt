A decision of morals
UNIVERSITIES HAVE A DUTY to consider
the ethical implications of their research.
Stanford upheld this obligation when it
decided to return Native American skeletal
remains to their Ohlone-Costanoan des
cendents.
Stanford deserves great praise for this decision —
such cross-cultural respect and understanding should
be this University's hallmark.
The University had in its possession 550 Native
American skeletal remains, some as old as 3,000 years.
Although the remains had not been studied as
thoroughly as possible, they clearly were significant
for scholarly research.
In October 1988, members of the Ohlone community
approached the University. They claimed that the re
mains were those of their ancestors and that Stanford
therefore should return the bones to them.
Stanford, like other institutions that have received
similar requests, could have justified keeping the re
mains on the basis of its interests as a research insti
tution.
Instead, the University decided to return the re
mains. Although it plans to ask the Ohlone for per
mission to conduct some research on the bones prior
to reinterment, it stated that "final decisions regarding
the timing of the reburial" will be left to the Ohlone.
In making this decision, Stanford showed that, given
the choice between serving its own scientific interests
and respecting the wishes of other cultures, it could
perform a disinterested moral calculus. It showed that
it could place the beliefs of one community above its
own scientific mission.
Some disagree with the University's decision.
Their dissent has been vigorous and emotional. One
scholar has called the decision "a fiasco" and"the
worst kind of academic cowardice." Another has com
pared it to book burning. One of the dissenters, Bert
C.erow, professor emeritus of anthropology, has
publicly claimed ownership of the bones in order to
stop their transfer to the Ohlone community.
Critics oppose the decision for a number of reasons.
One of these reasons in particular, however, raises
questions that the University should consider in order
to establish a general policy regarding all cultural
artifacts in its possession.
The criticism can be called "the floodgate criticism."
Gerow and others fear that this decision cannot be
restricted to Native American bones held by the Uni
versity, but must naturally extend to artifacts and
"grave goods" as well.
They are correct. If the University truly respects
Native American beliefs, then this decision cannot be
limited to skeletal remains.
In this case, the University decided that the research
potential of the Native American remains could not
outweigh the religious needs of the Ohlone commu
nity.
Still, there may come a time when the University
will be justified in asserting the value of its own
religion — the religion of science — and the importance
of maintaining its own culture — that of scholarship.
