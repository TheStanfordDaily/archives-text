#8-Fresh Coffel and Tfa
At Whole Foods Market, a simple chore like buying coffee or tea can be an
adventurous task* test. We stock 41 different varieties of whole bean gourmet
coffee and over 200 different kinds of teas.
Because we offer only the finest coffee beans, from all parts of the world,
freshly roasted and ground to order, we make sure that you get a rich aroma
and a truly outstanding taste. We also have decaffinated coffees (by steam
process, not chemical) that have the same enticing flavor as our other varieties.
Our remarkable selection of teas is also worth mention. Apple, almond, orange
spice, peppermint, tranquility, herbals, and much more—packed loose or in
bags—are all available for you to sample and enjoy. So whatever your prefer
ence- -coffee, tea, or both—you can come in, experiment, and enjoy some
thing different each day.
