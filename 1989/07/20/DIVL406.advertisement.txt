ONCE UPON A TIME, there was an editor of a Weekly. And this editor was sad.
She was sad because nobody wrote to her.
Every morning she looked in the Letters to the Editor box, but found nothing.
Every afternoon she looked in the Letters to the Editor box, but found nothing.
Every evening she looked in the Letters to the Editor box, but found nothing.
Couldn't you write her. 7
