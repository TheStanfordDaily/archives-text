SLAC is not concerned
enough about safety to
take preventative measures
The July 13 article concern
ing a toxic spray painting
incident at the Stanford
Linear Accelerator Center
contains several factual er
rors.
1 am not a "senior en
gineer" at SLAC. 1 am a
Senior Science and Engineer
ing Technician. I am also the

United Stanford Workers
shop steward for the area
that was affected by toxic
spray painting.
SLAC safety officials did
not "discover" the incident. 1
reported it to them after I
read the warning label on
the paint cans that the
painters were using and be
came aware of the negative
physical reactions co-workers
in my shop were experienc
ing as a result of the spray
ing.
Bob Davis is the building

manager of the painted
building, not Finn Halbo.
The article also quoted
Doug Dupen, a SLAC em
ployee relations representa
tive, as saying that SLAC has
"a great concern with safety."
SLAC's concern for safety
has, at best, been a reaction
to harmful incidents, not a
concern that is expressed in
preventative measures or
common courtesy.
