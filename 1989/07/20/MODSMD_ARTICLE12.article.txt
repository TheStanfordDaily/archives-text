## Right to choose ingrained in our national consciousness 
### 
I AM NOT SURE how I
feel about abortion. The
issue involves so many
difficult questions. 1 don't
know when a fetus becomes
a human being. 1 don't know
how far individual states
should be allowed to go in
protecting an unborn baby to
the detriment of its mother.
However, there is one
thing of which I am abso
lutely sure: Women should
have the right to choose for
themselves whether or not to
have an abortion.
Having said that, I would
like to say that I agree with
the U.S. Supreme Court's
recent decision allowing
states to individually decide
the legality of abortion in
certain cases.
For too long, the Supreme
Court has been a quasi
legislative body, dealing with
prickly social issues which
politicians would much
rather avoid entirely.
Nevertheless, a majority
should decide the fate of
abortion in America and the
nine Supreme Court justices
are far from a representative
majority. The supposition
that nine people can some
how finesse truth out of lan
guage drafted 200 years ago
is preposterous.

Equally absurd is the idea
that Supreme Court justices
can somehow divine what
the men who wrote the Bill
of Rights intended. No one
can predict with any ac
curacy how people living 200
years ago would react to the
question of abortion.
The recent ideological
swing of the court dramati
cally demonstrates the
pliability of the Constitution
when it comes to deciding
issues far removed from the
document's original language.
Pro-choice advocates who
complain about the recent
decision by the Court should
realize that the same
flexibility which is now al
lowing Roe v. Wade to be
challenged allowed the
original decision to be
reached. Believe it or not, the
words "Thou shalt have the
right to have an abortion"
are not chiseled somewhere
between the lines in the
Constitution.
The solution to the abor
tion dilemma clearly docs not
lie in transforming the Su
preme Court into a legisla
tive body that swings back
and forth with the ideologi
cal pendulum. The Supreme
Court should not decide such
important issues based on

how they view the Constitu
tion through their individual,
ideological lenses.
In a way, pro-choice advo
cates scored a hidden victory
when the Court forced the
abortion debate into the
statehouse.
Freedom of choice is a
concept ingrained in our
national consciousness.
Though I doubt a majority of
Americans are in favor of
abortion per sc, I am confi
dent that the majority of
Americans support a wom
an's right to choose.
So whether the issue is
finally resolved in the form
of a constitutional ammend
ment or through individual
state laws, pro-choice will
eventually be the outcome.
Furthermore, abortion is
the kind of issue that should
be continually debated and
considered. Moral com
placency breeds cruelty and
should be avoided.
By challenging people to
decide where they stand on
so complex an issue, the Su
preme Court is also forcing
individuals to re-examine
their sense of morality.
