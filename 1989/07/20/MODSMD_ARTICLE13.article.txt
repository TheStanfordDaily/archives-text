## The 						meaning, essence and conception of the national anthem 
### 
When the national anthem plays,
everyone stands and turns to face the
flag. Many stand with their right hand
over their heart, in allegiance to the
United States and the "powers that be."
Many sing, or at least mouth, the words
of the song.
When I stand for the national an
them, I do not stand to praise America
nor do I stand out of a great sense of
patriotism or nationalism. I stand as a
sign of respect to all my ancestors who
were disgraced, slaughtered like
animals and used to make this country
what it is today.
I think about the slaves who were
taken from their native Africa and its
rich culture. As if this was not cruel
and inhuman enough, my ancestors
were made to be property whose lives
meant little more than that of a dog.
I think about how they were made
to give up their culture and forced to

acccpt that of the dominant culture (a
well-known tactic which destroys the
willpower and hope of those conquered
in order to prevent an uprising).
Today, the institutions that created
such inhumanities and injustices still
teach men, women and children of
color to hate themselves and the beauty
of their dark skin. For example, white
children — rarely black children — ap
pear in the pages of primary textbooks.
As I stand, I remember my Native
American ancestors. I try to visualize
what it was like to be herded, akin to
cattle, onto small parcels of land and
away from homelands. I try to picture
the horror of Wounded Knee. I think
of the genocide.
A people who numbered more than
10 million rejoice now because they are
one million in number today. This na
tion which condemned Hitler and Nazi
Germany for its treachery and murder

committed similar abuses against Na
tive Americans years before the Third
Reich's tyranny.
Finally, 1 think about my Japanese
ancestors. I try to picture my grandfa
ther, who was half Japanese and half
black. Upon his return from fighting
in World War II he became an alcoholic
and later died a lonely death 10 years
before I was born.
When Bert Gettis came back from
defending his country, he probably ex
pected the respect soldiers commonly
receive. He found that his military serv
ice had changed nothing. Segregation
still existed and whites continued to
kill blacks in order to teach them their
"proper place" in the United States.
Is this just? This man risked his life
for a country that did not acknowledge
his existence or personhood.
I also think about the interment of

Japanese-Americans during World War
11. This country imprisoned its own
citizens based on their nationality.
Surely this is not the.democracy — "the
land of the free and the home of the
brave" — that we brag about.
When I hear the Star Spangled Ban
ner, it is my ancestors that I think .of
and their struggle, bloodshed and tears
that have made this country what it is
today.
Though I become sad and angered
when I think of these things, I will
stand when I hear the national anthem.
I will stand and think of the dark and
dismal past of this nation. I will also
think about how I can make the future
a brighter one for those who will come
after me.
