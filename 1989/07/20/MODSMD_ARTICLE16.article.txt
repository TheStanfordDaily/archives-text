# Talkin' baseball — a game for the ages

CHAPEL HILL, N.C. - Heat
lightning is flashing around every
horizon, hut this kid sitting next
to me pays no attention. He's
watching baseball.
The kid looks about 10 years
old, but he must be keeping track
of his age in dog years. That's 70

to you and me. We're watching a
North Carolina state high school
all-star game, and my new ac
quaintance is wearing an old
timers' two-tone cap, a grey hat
with a dark blue bill. And he's
chewing tobacco.
This septuagenarian youngster

is spitting over his belly, between
his legs and is sashaying a running
commentary on the ball game. I le

>tarts right out on the umpire,
A-ho callcd two questionable
strikes on the first two pitches.
"I didn't think them two was
;vcn close. This here umpire is
gonna call 'em if they're around
anywheres. Guess he wants a fast
game."
Now I'm sorry, but I can't write
in a southern accent, so you'll
have to read in one. The kid is
drawling something fierce. His
delivery lulls you into the illusion
that he's talking slowly, but he's
actually getting a lot in there be
tween breaths.
"Aw, man, that would've been
a broken bat if it was wood.
Sounded awful, like a sick hum
min' bird. Can't break them alu
minum bats, but you can sure
make 'em sound like you broke
'em."
The diminutive leadott hitter in
the bottom of the second inning
just nubbed one foul, and the kid
and I were the only ones to wince
at the sound, as far as I could
tell. Next pitch is laced into right
center field for a single. But the
kid stands up and yells, "Two,
two, two, yeah! he's going' for

two." And the runner slid safely
in under the surprised tag.
"Got to watch for those little
guys. They're sneaky," the kid says
slowly as he sits down shaking his
head and chortling.
As we head into the fourth in
ning of a scoreless tie, the parents
and older folks around start to
realize that this ump has a gen
erous pentagon. I ask the kid if
we ought to tell them at least he's
consistently bad.
"Nah, let 'em holler. It might
be that they'll start watching the
game now," he says.
"Kid, how old are you anyway?"
I ask.
"I'm 'levcn years old in July."
Ten-year-olds are easy to spot,
with their newfound esteem ot
double-digits. This guy, however,
already carries the look of several
decades. Now that we're engaged
in conversation (previously he was
talking to the vicinity, which was
me) he's got some questions.
"Where you from?"
"I'm visiting from New Eng

land," I say, and he nods knowing
ly-
"How's the ball up there?"
"Pretty good. About the same,
except the kids look more nervous
up there. These guys look kind of
lazy until the ball starts moving,"
I say.
"Yeah, well, it's too hot to be
nervous." The kid turns to me for
the first time, and I can see the
insignia on his T-shirt. VFW, Vet
erans of Foreign Wars. I suppose
it's got to be the sponsor of his
little league team, or a shrunken
hand-me-down.
"Aw man, did you see that?"
he asks. 1 did. A chopper to the
right side that the pitcher gloved
and then took all the way to the
bag himself, leaving the waiting
first baseman looking stupid. "I
believe he is going to pay for that
hot doggin'. What's he thinking
about? Don't trust his own first
baseman? Man, something like
that wakes the whole place up.
He should've been happy that
everything was quiet."
This kid is trulv amazed and

puzzled, with the look on his face
that people get when they remem
ber Dan Quayle is Vice President.
"He mighta had some fun doin'
it, hut his luck's gonna change."
The next hatter walks on four
pitches. Suddenly, this pitcher
can't find the vast bull's-eye. A
bunt that's booted by the third
baseman puts runners on first and
second. Two wild pitches/passed
balls later, it's 1-0.
"I believe I'm going to get some
food," the kid says after the inning
ends. "My stomach hurts after
that." A few minutes later he
comes back with a mini San Diego
Padres helmet full of ice cream.
"Want some?" he asks, holding
out a spoonful. "It's vanilla. Pretty
good, too. Padres helmet. All out
of Braves ones. Sure you don't
want some?"
Well, as far as I know at this
point, he still has tobacco in his
cheek. I'll pass. The kid wolfs it
down, then leans back and moans,
"Ooooheey, got myself a headache.
Let's see it this can finish up by
ten o'clock."

I've been trying to figure out
who this kid is related to on the
field. Son of a coach. 7 Brother of
a player? Son of the home plate
umpire — that would be good. I
can't stand it anymore.
"Arc you chewing tobacco?" I
ask.
"Yes 1 am. I'd offer you some,
but 1 got it off someone else. Aw,
man, that was an arbitrary call.
That's a awful way to strike out.
This ump leaves to be desired."
"Arbitrary?" 1 ask, questioning
the use of the word.
"It's in the dictionary. Look it
up."
Yeah, I know. 1 wonder if he
knows the definition says, "De
pending on the will or discretion
of a judge or tribunal." Or an
umpire.
After the two of us stand like
sore thumbs for the seventh inning
stretch, the kid says he's got to
go. "Goin' to be no more scorin'
today anyhow. Goodbye."
It's five minutes before 10. I see
him a minute later walking alone
beyond the center field fence. I
suppose he has a curfew, or maybe
he wants to watch L.A. Law. Final
score, 1-0.
In the movie "The Tin Drum",
a kid decides to stop growing,
which is fine with me. But he
chooses to spend the rest of his
lile spying on people and banging
a drum. This septuagenarian kid
from Chapel Mill has found a bet
ter vocation.
