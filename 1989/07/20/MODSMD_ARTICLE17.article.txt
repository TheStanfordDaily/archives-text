# And it makes me wonder...

### 
Tune in to the baseball high
lights on ESPN's Sports-
Center almost any night
and you'll see a batter drive in
one or more runs with a routine
ground ball that squirts past a
drawn in infield.

Given how ineffective the strat
egy is, why do managers still insist
on bringing the infield in?
And speaking of managers ...
Why don't they tell the opposite
field outfielder not to play so deep?
Haven't they figured out that
Vincc Coleman doesn't hit the
ball as hard the opposite way as
Darryl Strawberry does?
If ex-major league pitcher Roger
Craig is such a genius, why does
the entire Giants pitching staff
spend major streches of the season
on the disabled list? 1 ley Sports
Illustrated! I'm betting against
Kelly Downs winning the Cy
Young award. Ever.
While on the subject of SI: Why
arc they carrying out this vicious
attack on Pete Rose? What do
they have to gain? Printing the
testimony of convicted criminals
will not net the magazine a Pulit
zer. It may cost them a lot of
subscribers in Ohio, though.
Is 13-year-old tennis phenom
Jennifer Capriati likely to benefit
from seeing her name splashed
across the national scene by NBC
and The Sporting News?
Shouldn't Capriati's parents tell
Rillie Jean King to shut up if they
want their daughter to be the next
Steffi Graf instead of the next
Andrea Jaeger?
