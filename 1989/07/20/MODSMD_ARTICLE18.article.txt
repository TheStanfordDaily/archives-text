## Inside Stanford's summer drama 
### Sherifa Edoga 
So far, the drama department's
Summer Theater Festival has
taken place entirely in the 88-seat
Nitery. The small size of this
theater has made each show an
even more intense experience for
the audience than would have
been possible in the larger theaters
— and the season has been in
tense.
It has included "The Maids" by
Jean Genet, Maria Irene Fornds'
"The Successful Life of 3" and
"Krapp's Last Tape," "Catastrophe"
and "Breath," all by Samuel Beck
ett.
Shannon Jackson, Rob Baker
and Edward Isser have shown bold
ness and professionalism in their
choices of shows and their direct
ing, going beyond the norm in
their demands on actors and in
their interpretations. While this
makes for somewhat overwhelming

performances, it has also been an
opportunity to see exceptional tal
ent in both action and design.
"Krapp's Last Tape"
Actor David Kurtz adds to an
already-impressive year of perform
ances with his role in this one-man
show. Under the direction of Rob
Baker, David stars as the aged
Krapp, who listens to tapes made
on a birthday 30 years earlier.
Although he isn't always con
vincing as an old man, David has
a consistency of characterization
that stems from a deep under
standing of the alienated Krapp.
Much of David's best work is
recorded — in the tapes of Krapp
as a young man.
"Catastrophe"
Directed by Shannon Jackson,
this play is puzzling and disturbing,
like all of Beckett's work. The
Director, played by Andy Mera,

creates a human wreckage for his
audience. Cold and cruel, he
shows no pity for his protagonist.
Debbie Lipman, the Protagonist,
is to be applauded for her un
breakable concentration through
out her performance. Joyce
Dorado, the Director's Assistant,
could have done more with her
concern for the Protagonist and
her occasional exasperation with
the Director.
"The Maids"
This piece, directed by Edward
Isser, takes us into a world of
subservience, twisted fantasy and
death. There is a very fine line
between fantasy and reality, and
terrible danger when that line is
crossed.
Denisc Boling and Claudia
Orenstein both give excellent
performances as the maids venting
