## Inside Stanford's summer drama 
### Sherifa Edoga 
So far, the drama department's
Summer Theater Festival has
taken place entirely in the 88-seat
Nitery. The small size of this
theater has made each show an
even more intense experience for
the audience than would have
been possible in the larger theaters
— and the season has been in
tense.
It has included "The Maids" by
Jean Genet, Maria Irene Fornds'
"The Successful Life of 3" and
"Krapp's Last Tape," "Catastrophe"
and "Breath," all by Samuel Beck
ett.
Shannon Jackson, Rob Baker
and Edward Isser have shown bold
ness and professionalism in their
choices of shows and their direct
ing, going beyond the norm in
their demands on actors and in
their interpretations. While this
makes for somewhat overwhelming

performances, it has also been an
opportunity to see exceptional tal
ent in both action and design.
"Krapp's Last Tape"
Actor David Kurtz adds to an
already-impressive year of perform
ances with his role in this one-man
show. Under the direction of Rob
Baker, David stars as the aged
Krapp, who listens to tapes made
on a birthday 30 years earlier.
Although he isn't always con
vincing as an old man, David has
a consistency of characterization
that stems from a deep under
standing of the alienated Krapp.
Much of David's best work is
recorded — in the tapes of Krapp
as a young man.
"Catastrophe"
Directed by Shannon Jackson,
this play is puzzling and disturbing,
like all of Beckett's work. The
Director, played by Andy Mera,

creates a human wreckage for his
audience. Cold and cruel, he
shows no pity for his protagonist.
Debbie Lipman, the Protagonist,
is to be applauded for her un
breakable concentration through
out her performance. Joyce
Dorado, the Director's Assistant,
could have done more with her
concern for the Protagonist and
her occasional exasperation with
the Director.
"The Maids"
This piece, directed by Edward
Isser, takes us into a world of
subservience, twisted fantasy and
death. There is a very fine line
between fantasy and reality, and
terrible danger when that line is
crossed.
Denisc Boling and Claudia
Orenstein both give excellent
performances as the maids venting

their hatred for their mistress in
the illusory world they create.
There is no escape for the audi
ence as Boling and Orenstein go
further and further into their char
acters' fantasies.
Aleta Hayes provides the only
release in her amusing, stereo
typical portrayal of Madame.
While Isser could have explored
a wider range of levels, I congrat
ulate him for his successful direc

tion of Genet's warped play.
"The Successful Life of 3"
Directed by Shannon Jackson,
this is a welcome relief from the
other, powerful, thought-pro
voking shows. This bizarre play
about a love triangle is not what
you would expect. It's silly and
entertaining.
The three stars — Rudy Loh
meycr as 3, Ashwin Bulchandani
as He, and Sholom Surges as She
— are wonderful. The sharp phys
ical and personality contrasts be
tween 1 le and 3 are very effective.
The complex prop and costume

changes run smoothly and arc al
most as much fun as the rest of
the play.
I didn't get the point of the
song at the end, but considering
that the play is pretty pointless
anyway, it isn't really a problem.
With the success of "Catastrophe"
and this play, Shannon Jackson
proves her versatility as a director.
Afterthoughts and future plays
Now for a disclaimer. As a par
ticipant in the Drama Depart
ment's Summer Season, it is dif
ficult to be objective. But I can
honestly say that the department,

including actors, set and costume
designers, direc
tors, has reason to be proud of its
work thus far. They have taken
on some very difficult projects, and
I'm looking forward to the rest of
the season. It includes August
Strindberg's "Playing with Fire,"
I larold Pinter's "A Slight Ache,"
"Jacques and His Master" by Milan
Kundera (of "Unbearable Light
ness of Being" fame), and Lanford
Wilson's "Balm in Gilead."
I strongly recommend going to
any or all productions. The Nitery
at-Noon is a great alternative for
the lunch hour. Get to perform

anccs early because season ticket
holders have priority and perform
ances in the Nitery have been
selling out rapidly.

The Nitery is located in the Old
Umcni Courtyard, building 590. The
Little Theater is on the west side of
Memorial Hall.
Nitery-at-Noon performances con
tinue Tuesday through Thursday un
til August 11. TicJcc'ts are sold only
at the door. $3/$2 students and
senior citizens. Both the Nitery and
the Little Theater host evening shows,
which are $6/$4. Call 723-2646 for
more information.

So far, the drama department's
Summer Theater Festival has
taken place entirely in the 88-seat
Nitery. The small size of this
theater has made each show an
even more intense experience for
the audience than would have
been possible in the larger theaters
— and the season has been in
tense.
It has included "The Maids" by
Jean Genet, Maria Irene Fornds'
"The Successful Life of 3" and
"Krapp's Last Tape," "Catastrophe"
and "Breath," all by Samuel Beck
ett.
Shannon Jackson, Rob Baker
and Edward Isser have shown bold
ness and professionalism in their
choices of shows and their direct
ing, going beyond the norm in
their demands on actors and in
their interpretations. While this
makes for somewhat overwhelming

performances, it has also been an
opportunity to see exceptional tal
ent in both action and design.
"Krapp's Last Tape"
Actor David Kurtz adds to an
already-impressive year of perform
ances with his role in this one-man
show. Under the direction of Rob
Baker, David stars as the aged
Krapp, who listens to tapes made
on a birthday 30 years earlier.
Although he isn't always con
vincing as an old man, David has
a consistency of characterization
that stems from a deep under
standing of the alienated Krapp.
Much of David's best work is
recorded — in the tapes of Krapp
as a young man.
"Catastrophe"
Directed by Shannon Jackson,
this play is puzzling and disturbing,
like all of Beckett's work. The
Director, played by Andy Mera,

creates a human wreckage for his
audience. Cold and cruel, he
shows no pity for his protagonist.
Debbie Lipman, the Protagonist,
is to be applauded for her un
breakable concentration through
out her performance. Joyce
Dorado, the Director's Assistant,
could have done more with her
concern for the Protagonist and
her occasional exasperation with
the Director.
"The Maids"
This piece, directed by Edward
Isser, takes us into a world of
subservience, twisted fantasy and
death. There is a very fine line
between fantasy and reality, and
terrible danger when that line is
crossed.
Denisc Boling and Claudia
Orenstein both give excellent
performances as the maids venting

from "A Slight Ache," one of the Nitery-at-Noon plays.
their hatred for their mistress in
the illusory world they create.
There is no escape for the audi
ence as Boling and Orenstein go
further and further into their char
acters' fantasies.
Aleta Hayes provides the only
release in her amusing, stereo
typical portrayal of Madame.
While Isser could have explored
a wider range of levels, I congrat
ulate him for his successful direc

tion of Genet's warped play.
"The Successful Life of 3"
Directed by Shannon Jackson,
this is a welcome relief from the
other, powerful, thought-pro
voking shows. This bizarre play
about a love triangle is not what
you would expect. It's silly and
entertaining.
The three stars — Rudy Loh
meycr as 3, Ashwin Bulchandani
as He, and Sholom Surges as She
— are wonderful. The sharp phys
ical and personality contrasts be
tween 1 le and 3 are very effective.
The complex prop and costume

changes run smoothly and arc al
most as much fun as the rest of
the play.
I didn't get the point of the
song at the end, but considering
that the play is pretty pointless
anyway, it isn't really a problem.
With the success of "Catastrophe"
and this play, Shannon Jackson
proves her versatility as a director.
Afterthoughts and future plays
Now for a disclaimer. As a par
ticipant in the Drama Depart
ment's Summer Season, it is dif
ficult to be objective. But I can
honestly say that the department,

including actors, set and costume
designers, direc
tors, has reason to be proud of its
work thus far. They have taken
on some very difficult projects, and
I'm looking forward to the rest of
the season. It includes August
Strindberg's "Playing with Fire,"
I larold Pinter's "A Slight Ache,"
"Jacques and His Master" by Milan
Kundera (of "Unbearable Light
ness of Being" fame), and Lanford
Wilson's "Balm in Gilead."
I strongly recommend going to
any or all productions. The Nitery
at-Noon is a great alternative for
the lunch hour. Get to perform

anccs early because season ticket
holders have priority and perform
ances in the Nitery have been
selling out rapidly.

The Nitery is located in the Old
Umcni Courtyard, building 590. The
Little Theater is on the west side of
Memorial Hall.
Nitery-at-Noon performances con
tinue Tuesday through Thursday un
til August 11. TicJcc'ts are sold only
at the door. $3/$2 students and
senior citizens. Both the Nitery and
the Little Theater host evening shows,
