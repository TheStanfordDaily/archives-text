# 'Licence to Kill': Bond is really back
## 
### Mark Tompkins Staff writer 
In "Licence to Kill," the latest
007 film, the James Bond formula
is shaken, not just stirred.
Here we have an angry Bond
chasing after a Noriega-like drug
lord, in direct defiance of M's and
the British government's orders.
New guy Timothy Dalton is per
fect for a moody, intense Bond.
Even in his lighter moments, he
looks like his cummerbund is too
tight.
Bond movies always start where
other movies leave off. 1 he pre
credits scene is like a mini-movie
in itself. Bond and his pal Felix
Leiter, cx-CIA and now DEA
(played by David 1 leddison, who
played the same role way back in
"Live and Let Die"), are driving
to Leiter's wedding in the Florida
Keys. But they learn that the DEA
has located drug kingpin Fran:
Sanchez (Robert Davi) in the area,
so they drop everything to capture
Sanchez, which they do in a par
ticularly ingenious fashion.
But Sanchez can buy his way
out of any situation, simply by
offering million-dollar bribes to
everyone around him. He escapes

from the DEA and then exacts a
horrible revenge on Leiter and his
new bride. Bond swears to get
Sanchez, and from then on in
we're a long ways from the amiable
vacuum of Roger Moore's later
performances as Bond.
When it came to showing the
darker shades of Dalton's Bond,
"The Living Daylights" was a big
tease, but "Licence to Kill" is the
payoff. The striking blend of
suaveness and brutality that char
acterized Sean Connery's Bond —
which you never really see in the
edited TV versions — is back.
Since Bond isn't on an official
mission, the standard plot struc
ture is gone. You never know
what's going to happen next. After
some brilliantly staged mayhem in
the Keys (best stunt: Bond
watcrskis behind a seaplane, using
a speargun), Bond tracks Sanchez
to his home base, the fictional
Isthmus City. There Sanchez owns
everyone and everything — ap
parent omnipotence.
Robert Davi's Sanchez is the
coolest, most formidable villain
Bond has faced since who knows
when. The typical Bond villain is
some mastermind with a bogus
accent ("Meester Bund .. .") who

orders his henchmen — weak im
itations of Oddjob or Jaws, usually
— to do the dirty work ("Bund
is alive! Kill Bund!").
Sanchez is different. Younger
than Bond, everything about him
suggests power, and he moves with
a kind of dangerous grace. In a
flamboyant, lan Flcming-esque
touch, an iguana with a diamond
necklace perches on his shoulder.
I'd been impressed by Robert
Davi ever since I saw him play
an out-of-control monster cop on
"1 lill Street Blues" years ago. The
Bond producers were smart to give
him the significant amount of
screen time they did.
The female lead, a CIA pilot
played by Carey Lowell, is a wel
come change ot pace.
Some minor caveats: First, the
theme song is a lame, instantly
forgettable re-write of "Goldfinger"
and second, Maurice Binder, who
designs the title sequences (you
know, wherein the silhouettes of
half-naked women cavort around
Bond's Walther PPK) has gotten
plenty senile.
But everything else falls into
place to make this the best Bond

movie in years and years. Even for
a Bond film, the locales are un
usually beautiful. And yes, the ac
tion astonishes once again. At the
climax the twists at fast pace are
truly ingenious.
Unlike in"The Living Day
lights," the scaffolding of the
movie doesn't collapse around
Dalton in the last half-hour.
Above all, the class that the
Bond movies have, which once
seemed threatened, is firmly in
place. A potent combination of
wit (not slapstick) and a discreet,
stylish form of sadism, gives Bond
an edge over his action-adventure
competitors.
Bond producer Albert Broccoli
and writer Richard Maibaum are
both about 80 years old, but the
production dynasty they've sired
is all set to take Dalton's Bond
into the '90s.
