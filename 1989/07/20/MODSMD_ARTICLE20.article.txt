# Van Morrison's personal journey
## 
### Mark Pinkus 
Forget about the Stones, The
Who, Paul McCartney and the
rest of the post-40 rockers who
are on the road this summer.
One of the most worthwhile mu
sical offerings from anyone of
any age this year comes from
the veteran Van Morrison with
"Avalon Sunset."
Van Morrison's 25 years in
the music business have been
distinguished. Morrison is best
known for "Moondance" (1970)
and his classic "Astral Weeks'
(1968). Fellow countrymen Elvis
Costello and Bono Hcwson have
credited Morrison with being ex
tremely influential in their
music, and Costello goes as far
as to say, "He's the greatest
white soul-singer of all time."
With "Avalon Sunset," Mor
rison has managed to avoid a
recreation of the past and, at

the same time, he has conjured
up the same soulful sound that
made both him and his past
records legendary.
The album opens up with
"Whenever God Shines His
Light," a brilliant duct featuring
Cliff Richard. The song high
lights Morrison's classic trade
marks: mysticism, unique chord
changes and spiritual lyrics with
a complex musical backdrop.
The album shows that Mor
rison has changed as well as
stayed the same. Optimistic
lyrics reveal the new inspira
tional attitude that Morrison has
adopted. In " I hese Are the
Days," Morrison sings, "These
are the days of the endless sum
mer/ These are the days, the
time is now/ There is no past,
there's only future/ There's only
here, There's only now." Part of
this feeling may be due to Mor

rison's religious devotion —
"love of the one great magician."
In various ways, the joys and
struggles of Morrison's faith per
meate the album. Don't get me
wrong, though. This is not a
preachy album. It's not
presumptous or pretentious in
its message, but instead it's just
Morrison's honest emotions and
thoughts about God, his rela
tionships, and his own mortality.
Rather than shying away from
the words, 1 recommend taking
a good hard listen to them.
If you have some of Morrison's
early albums then "Avalon Sun
set" becomes an essential addi
tion to your collection. If you
have none, make this one the
first. A warning for you first
timers, though. Be prepared to
go out and buy a few more Van
Morrison albums, because this
one only leaves you thirsting for
more.
