# House of Freaks traces roots
## 
### Scott Saul 
They are a group stripped down
to its bare essentials — one
guitarist and one drummer. They
reject ambient backgrounds, psy
chedelic tape loops, distortion
chamber fuzziness and other forms
of studio trickery. But House of
Freaks, a two-man band from
Richmond, Va. that recently
opened for Midnight Oil, manages
to rock intelligently and powerfully
on their second album, "Tantilla."
House of Freaks went to Los
Angeles to prepare their first al
bum, but they left La-La Land
soon after finishing those initial
recording sessions. "Tantilla"
reflects that journey back to Vir
ginia, to a rich history that in
cludes the Civil War and its
aftermath.
Although fellow Southerner
Tom Petty waved the Confederate
flag on his "Southern Accents"
album and tour, House of Freaks
is more haunted than exhilarated
by the past.

On "Sun Gone Down," in be
tween sonic wedges of crunch
guitar, singer-guitarist Brian
Harvey tells how he was visited
by a friend's ghost: "On the day
you died/ I heard you call my
name."
The album's landscape is filled
with crumbling spectral mansions,
and its populace includes
vagabonds, wounded graycoats,
smug plantation owners and
starchy preachers.
While Harvey and drummer
Johnny Hott appreciate Southern
tradition in "Family Tree" ("Their
wells dried up long ago/Water
stops flowing, but this tree will
always grow"), more often they
attack the hypocrisy of the South,
where "sermons fly from the
preacher's mouth/but the auction
block still remains." It's a bleak
picture, and Harvey's only advice
is to "look away to the flames of
our big houses," to accept the fact
that the legacy of the South is
changing.
Unfortunately, House of Freaks'
exploration of the South takes a
major detour in the church of the
poisoned mind. "The Righteous
Will Fall" and "King of Kings,"
both sung from the devil's point
of view, come across as heavy
handed despite Harvey's honest
singing. Even a sympathetic lis
tener will have difficulty swallow
ing lines like "Unafraid in the
valley of my death/I took my ribs
and tore them from my chest."
Despite some lyrical shortcom
ings, "Tantilla" is still an album
full of rare pleasures. Harvey and
Hott possess a sophisticated
melodic sense that seems to be
out of fashion in alternative music,
one that refuses to condescend to
the slouching listener.
Musically and lyrically mature,
they indulge in none of the rant
and-rave antics that rock music is

the sensitive issue of romantic
love.
On "Broken Bones," a soft trib
ute to a damaged relationship,
Harvey's voice is touching and
apologetic, not sentimental or
whiny. "In this broken home," he
asks, "will you still love me with
broken bones?" Such moments,
punctuated by sparse percussion
and a muted electric guitar, leave
one hoping that, while the man
sions of the South may be crum
bling, at least one of its Houses
is here to stay.
