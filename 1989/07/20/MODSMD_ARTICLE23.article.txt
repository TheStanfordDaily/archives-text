# 'Chocolat' is refreshing

### David Chang Staff writer 
"Chocolat," now playing at
the Aquarius in Palo Alto, is
another must-see foreign film
that's about to disappear into
video stores. Now sharing time
with "La Lectrice," the film will
finish its run on July 27.
"Chocolat" sensitively tells
the story of a French family in
colonial Cameroon. There arc
a lot of sub-plots — little
glimpses that tell about the
characters and their environ
ment. In fact, the core of the
movie is framed by the
daughter's present-day search
for her roots. But the movie
centers around the daughter as
a young girl.
The most memorable things
about the movie are the small,
poignant images that Clare
Denis captures so well. Some
portray the close relationship
between the girl and the slave
Protce; others are just poignant
and visually pleasing.
In one vignette, a visitor has
a seizure when she's told about
the "horrible" life that the

French colonists have in
Cameroon. The father drives
off to get the nearest doctor,
who happens to be black. The
visitor refuses to be treated by
him, and he walks off into the
night, slowly retreating from the
lights of the house. It's a beauti
fully filmed scene, contrasted
with a lot of emotional turmoil.
Events in "Chocolat" pass
slowly, like things often do in
real life, but Denis has also
packed the scenes with realistic
nuances and tensions. About
halfway into the movie, those
tensions become nearly un
bearable, heightened by the
brilliant use of sounds —
silence, insect noises and the
throbbing of the house's
generator.
Rut at the end, Denis relieves
those tensions, returning to the
story of the daughter as an
adult, and then observing the
antics of some modern
Cameroonians. It's the equiva
lent of a slow fadeout as the
director takes us layer-by-layer
out of the film, and it shows
Denis' regard for the people ot
Cameroon and lor humanity.
