# Steve Miller Band blends old and new
## 
### Mark Pinkus 
Few performers are able to suc
cessfully find the balance between
playing what they want to play
and what the audience wants them
to play. This past Saturday at the
Shoreline Amphitheatre, the Steve
Miller Band found the perfect
medium.
The show kicked off with Miller
alone on stage, playing three songs
on acoustic guitar. This set the
scene for the talented six-piece
backup band to join Miller in nine
bluesy numbers. Then came the
second set, which offered one clas
sic '70s hit after another.
From the beginning, it was clear
the night would be witness to some
serious musicianship. The opening
tune found Miller undertaking the
old Sam Cooke song, "Honest I
Do." Although it fell a bit out of
his vocal range, the feelings Miller
evoked from his impressive solo
made it worthwhile.
The first set was chiefly a
chance for Miller and his band to
engage in some lengthy R &. B
influenced solos based on new
songs. While some might have
found it a bit tedious, the near
capacity crowd responded enthu
siastically after each number.

Miller teased the audience as
he closed the first set with
"Swingtown." The ever-popular
song pulled the crowd to its feet.
And the predominantly Bay
Area-based band delivered a spec
tacular second set. After going
through a few more blues songs,
including the standout "Born to
Be Blue," Miller launched into his
classics. The barrage began with
"Take the Money and Run"and
didn't end until a funky version
of "Jet Airliner," a psychedelic
rendition of "Fly Like an Eagle,"
and a good oF rockin' "Jungleland"

were all played.
Since "Roclcin' Me" hadn't been
played, an encore was inevitable.
Once again Miller produced the
goods, but while most would have
then called it a night, the expe
rienced rocker wanted the last
word.
As he strapped his acoustic back
on, he dedicated the last song to
Tim Davis, the original drummer
of the band who passed away a
few years back. Rather than
leaving the crowd stomping its feet
and singing a catchy chorus, Miller
chose to end on a somber note,
singing a virtually unknown piece
that he wrote with Davis before
Davis died.
The surprise ending left most
of the audience in a more reflec
tive mood than expected. But for
those who were thinking back to
the 25-song show they had just
witnessed, it was a mood quick
ened by the vitality of the per
formance.

The Shoreline features other head
liners this weekend. Tomorrow Rod
Stewart plays at 8 p.m., and Satur
day rught the Replacements open for
Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers
at 8.
