# Aso Sushi is lost in a sea of more memorable competitors
## 
### Karen Kramer Staff writer 
Much as the proverbial "middle
child" struggles for an identity,
Aso Sushi lacks distinguishing
character in the ranks of local
sushi restaurants. The food is not
the finest. And though the prices
are better than decent, the atmos
phere pales in comparison with
that of other inexpensive sushi
places such as Miyake's, where the
floating-boat sushi bar and cheer
ing waiters give it a claim to fame.
Aso's decor aims for the simple
yet-tasteful look: wood paneling,
with a Japanese fan and an array
of identically-sized prints adorning

the walls. Japanese music breezes
softly in the background. The
tables arc closely set in the small
rectangular room — close enough
to allow a patron to distinctly hear
a conversation across the room.
Along with the voices, other
minor details detracted from the
polished image. My second cup of
tea was barely brewed enough to
taste like anything more than hot
water. One of the sushi rolls 1 had
been served contained a shrimp's
inedible tail instead of the shrimp
itself. And the "vegetarian sushi"
inexplicably featured salmon as a
principal ingredient.
1 lowever, this combination of
salmon, Dalkon sprouts, crab

sticks, tomato and asparagus cov
ered with Tobiko (small red fish
eggs) was one of the most inter

esting and tasty items on the
menu. The Aso Special — made
with crab sticks, shrimp, veal,
cucumber and sprouts all covered
with Tobiko — was another sushi
special worth trying.
Overall, though, the sushi did
not taste especially good. The
bagels, cream cheese and lox ver
sion of sushi, called "the Philadel
phia roll," is usually a winner at
sushi restaurants, but fell short of
delighting the palate. Since "the
Philadelphia roll" is one of the
new items added to the menu two
weeks ago, it may take time to
find the right balance of ingredi
ents for this normally delectable
combination. However, even the

traditional California rolls tasted
more bland than they should have.
The menu also offers a wide
selection of teriyaki dishes, every
thing from pork to tuna. Teriyaki
plates run from $5.25 to $6.50
and include rice, soup and salad.
Aso's "Dinner for Two" sounds
interesting with its combination
of sushi, sashimi, tempura, beef
and chicken teriyaki and fruits for
$19.
You might be better off with
one of the teriyaki dishes. The
sushi alone, as the name uninten
tionally implies, is only so-so.

Aso Susfu Teriyaki Restaurant is
located at 330 Lyttcm in Palo Alto.
