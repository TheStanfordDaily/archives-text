## A 						history of everday objects The 						write stuff: a geographic history of pencils 
### Mark Weiner Editorial staff 
Editor's note: This is the second
article in The Weekly's occasional
series, "A History of Everday Ob
jects.'' Rather than examine the cor
porate history of an object — as we
did with a container of Foster Farms
orange juice — this article traces
the history of an object from a ge
ographic perspective. It also examines
the corporate holdings of the object's
manufacturer

"I am merely a servant. I am
used for both good and bad re
cordings. The good predominates.
1 am bitten, hacked with dull
knives, and often thrown away in
disgust by the one who uses me,
but 1 have no complaint, for a
new one of my kind takes my
place. Competitors try to take my
place, but like the river, 1 have
kept 'rolling along' to my destina
tion. 1 am a mere Pencil. But oh,
how important!"
"The Lead Pencil," by
George M. Adams
What are the origins of a typical
pencil? From what far-flung cor
ners of the world do a pencil's
component parts arise. 7
The Weekly contacted Dixon
Ticonderoga Co. to find out. Based
in Vero Beach, Fla., Dixon Ticon
deroga is one of the nation's largest
pencil manufacturers.
Most pencil companies make
their pencils with cedar wood.
Cedar has a straight, fine grain
and a pleasant aroma.
Until about 25 years ago, pencil
cedar usually came from Tennes
see. Years of wasteful land use,
however, have exhausted Tennes
see's cedar supply.
Now most pencil companies, in
cluding Dixon Ticonderoga, ob
tain pencil cedar from Calfornia's
Feather River Canyon, just north
of Sacramento. Calfornia's cedar
is softer and not as aromatic as
Tennessee's.
The company also occasionally
manufactures its pencils from the
Jelutong tree of Indonesia.
Dixon Ticonderoga creates
what is erroneously called "pencil
lead" by mixing together clay and
refined graphite powder. The
amount of clay in any particular
mixture determines a pencil's
"grade," or "hardness." The more
clay used in the mixture, the
"harder" the pencil.
Dixon Ticonderoga receives its
clay from Kentucky, Tennessee
and occasionally Germany.
The company obtains its graph
ite from many different countries,
including Sri Lanka, China, Brazil
and Mexico.
Dixon Ticonderoga purchases
its "ferrules," the pieces of metal
that attach the eraser to the pencil
"body," from companies based in
Connecticut and Taiwan.
Ferrules are made by Eyelet
machines, which punch 1 1/4 inch
diameter metal discs into tall, thin
cups.
Dixon Ticonderoga produces its
erasers in Acton Vale, Canada.
Erasers are made by combining a
mixture of 26 percent synthetic
rubber, 8 percent pumice, 28 per
cent filler or "fiber," 25 percent
vulcanized vegetable oil, 5 percent
processing and coloring oils and
8 percent curing agents and ac
tivators.
The synthetic rubber in the mix

turc comes largely from Malaysia
and Taiwan.
After the eraser mixture is
Mended, it is formed into long
strips that look like pink spaghetti.
These strips arc cured at 280
degree Fahrenheit and cut into
pencil-tip lengths.
These pencil-tip erasers are then
rolled in large drums to remove
their sharp edges.
Then they are shipped to Dixon
Ticonderoga's main plant in Ver
satile, Mo., where the company

actually manufactures its pencils.
A pencil is made by placing a
strip of "pencil lead" into a half
slat of cedar, gluing one half-slat
of cedar onto another, and attach
ing a ferrule and an erasure to
the pencil's "body."
Dixon 1 iconderoga, which gen
erates approximately $70 million
in revenue each year, owns a num
ber of subsidiary companies, in
cluding Rryn Mawr Real Estate
