## Wisdom's Job Description

Do you believe the right things
about God? Does your understand
ing of God, in Christian terms, as
three in one, and one in three,
qualify as orthodox? The word
means "right opinion," or "straight
(as opposed to crooked) thought."
Have you got your ideas of God
straight? Do you believe the cor
rect things in the correct way?
I ask this slightly abrasive set
of questions because this is the
season in the Christian calendar
when attention is paid to God in
trinity. And I feel some pressure
from today's passages of scripture.
In the passage from John's
gospel, Jesus tells his disciples that
the coming of the Paraclete will
be a visitation by the Spirit of
truth — and a judgment. Those
who think and believe the truth
arc choosing to live in light; those
who do not, the darkness — the
place or the condition in which
life is not found.
Paul's assertion in Romans 5
about how we gained "peace with
God" begins with a phrase easily
and often bent to suggest that we
had better be straight about what
counts as religious truth. The
claim that you and I "are justified
by faith" has sometimes been
turned into a test of whether the
faith we hold is a set of beliefs
consistent and correct enough to
get us justified. Crudely, do you
believe in the way you must, in
order, as roadside signs used to
say, to "get right" with the one
we call God?
I am sure that you all know
that several centuries passed after
the death and resurrection of Jesus
before a majority of the faithful
concluded that they had hit upon
the right formulas for describing
the God of Christian experience
— a Sovereign Divine Life,
manifest in the Father, Son and
Spirit — one in essence, three
persons (though early Christian
thinkers, better than some
moderns, knew that ascribing
gender to deity was figurative
speech). One God in Trinity.
There you have a description of
the God it is agreed we can not,
finally, capture in our language or
our thought — the Holy One.
But of course agreement among
religious people is hard to gain;
battles continued after the 4th and
sth century councils which we, by
hindsight, consider conclusive.
Think about the dynamics of
claiming to possess religious truth.
If some have the doctrine right,
some others must not. If someone
grasps the Christian doctrine of
God fully, others will be accused
of having only partial understand
ing.
Question: How crucial is
doctrinal correctness? Is it a matter
of life or death? Salvation or
damnation? Does God withhold
what God gives from those who
do not think and believe correctly?
Our religious groups (Christian
churches decidedly among them),
in standing apart and in refusing
to learn or credit the faith of
others, give the judgment that
those who do not believe as they
believe arc outside saving truth
— different believers are "non
believers" — as such they arc en
dangered, lost, damned.
Two weeks ago I spent some
time with Arval Lookinghorsc, the
keeper of the sacred pipe of the
Sioux. He was blessing the grounds
upon which this year's Pow-Wow
took place. As he chanted and
said his prayers, I remembered an
earlier event in which he sat with

representatives from other reli
gions, answering student ques
tions. Students have a refreshing
way of forcing smooth talkers to
'fess up, to declare themselves.
This night, each panelist was
asked to respond, at whatever
length, but finally with a yea or
nay, to this query: Is your religion
a way to truth, or is your religion
the only path to salvation, the one
true way? Arval Lookinghorsc,
closing his eyes, fell silent for quite
a while when his turn for answer
ing came about. The moderator,
anxious, restated the question.
And finally Arval spoke: "The
Sioux way is the only way I know."
His answer had the ring of truth,
and a kind of modesty other
panelists might have tried on for
size. The one true way? "The only
way I know!"
Is God a doctrine checker? Is
a test in the cards for each of us
and might it be one in which the
questions anticipate, presume, and
will accommodate only one set of
answers — fixed, invariable, purely
true?
Would you not find a "match
ing" quiz or a "true-false" exercise
on your God-concept a weak
climax — in fact, a disappointing
anti-climax — to the riddles and
wonders which have filled your
life? A God who measured life
and its meanings on those grounds,
and took the results seriously,
would seem to us too shallow, or
too clue-less, to have been the
source of the life we in fact have.
Several of the parents discussing
baptism of their new babies sur
prised us a few weeks ago by ex
pressing their pain at having been
estranged from church community
for years; common to them was a
sharp sense of being disapproved,
or in their youth being made to
feel that they could not be ac
cepted as they were — with the
active curiosities, and in the
awakening bodies, they possessed.
And so they were among the
millions distanced from religious
life — nagged with a form of long
term homesickness, but also
resentful at having been stiff
armed in the name of a God they
now want to believe cares about
their children. What turned them
away? Their churches' claims
about what was required in order
for one to be a member in a com
munity of truth. Imagine, for ex
ample, believing, or being led to
believe, that the desire to marry
someone of another group — even
another Christian group — dis
qualified you from receiving from
God what God gives!
Were these young parents doc
trinally sharp — dogmatically
worthy to make vows for their
babies? That I cannot say. Did
they trust, or were they trying to
trust that a love exists to enfold
their children, and to be with them
as they grow into their lives? Yes,
they did.
All of this brings me back to
Proverbs 8, and a few words about
a piece of scripture concerned with
God's wisdom — what it does, for
how long it has been being and
doing God's wisdom, how wisdom
spends divine time. The text was
contested in those 4th century
days when Christians debated

whether the Son of God was eter
nal, divine in nature — or a crea
ture.
Wisdom says:"The Lord created
me at the beginning of God's way,
the first of the acts of old. Ages
ago I was set up, at the first,
before the beginning of the earth."
In the early church days in which
people thought about the differ
ence between God and humans in
categories ot essences or natures
(divine nature as distinct from
human nature) — one way of
imagining God's transaction with
us through Christ was expressed
this way: God's Wisdom, who is
God's eternal Son, who became
incarnate in Jesus of Nazareth, is
divine by nature, in possession of
divine holiness and power — and
in that capacity, as God, brought
help from above. Wisdom, becom
ing human, infused our humanity
with saving divinity.
A wonderful way of picturing
what God docs in love, in a reach
of compassion towards human
beings in need and trouble. If you
wished to believe correctly, at least
in one 4th-century form, that
would not be a bad starting point.
But I have been hinting steadily
that the concern with getting
beliefs exactly right smacks more
of human preoccupation than
definitive divine activity. Yes, it
is important to know who is God,
and who and what do not qualify
as God — that is, arc not worthy
of your trust. Idolatry is dangerous
because it seeks life-support from
what cannot support life. Yes, it
is important to respond to a call,
urgent in the Ist century and ur
gent today, to know who God is,
and among what groups and be
leaguered people God may be
found most directly involved in
Passover — in deliverance from
captivity.
Is it likely, though, that God,
in the manner of an examiner, is

most concerned with moving
people to right opinions about
Godness? It is fashionable these
days in "establishment" political
and religious circles (the luxury
of those who control many zones)
to attack single-issue and special
interest individuals and groups. I
wonder if it has occurred to newer
champions of religious orthodoxy
and right practice to question
whether they have fashioned God
into a single-issue personage — a
doctrine checker.
How strange, or at least it seems
so to me, to have lived and moved
about in scripture and tradition
and to have concluded that God
cares most of all about the cor
rectness of our belief — that or
thodoxy is decisive, that is,
decisive for the way in which God
regards and treats that part of crea
tion capable of judging and giving
assent to ideas.
Consider, just for a moment,
this picture from Proverbs 8, of
how a holy God, in wisdom, spends
time: from the beginning of crea
tion, the Wisdom of God is about
the daily business of
rejoicing in God's inhabited
world,
and delighting in humankind.
However we imagine God, or God
active, or God with a plan — this
little phrase from Proverbs 8 points
to something basic in the one we
count as our Life-giver and Life
definer: rejoicing and delighting
— taking pleasure in the world
inhabited by living things and en
joying the likes of you and me.
If we were to take seriously the
idea that salvation means having
the image of God in ourselves re
covered and restored — it would
mean you and I could imitate that
activity of God's wisdom, ourselves
"rejoicing in (the) inhabited world,
and delighting in humankind."

and delighting as not serious
enough to be religious — OK for
God, maybe on God's Sabbath,
but not right for me, not in
keeping with the way I was taught
religion, perhaps the only remedy
is the very old challenge: "Repent,
and believe the gospel!" Accept
the tidings about a Life-giver who
rejoices and delights in all that is,
and all who exists, EVEN in the
broken, incomplete, unfinished
and sometimes tragic conditions
we know, clearly, to be our con
ditions.
It is the same Wisdom of God
who not only urged us to rejoice
with those who rejoice, and weep
with those who weep, but who in
the flesh embraced life containing
all there is in the way of sorrow
and joy. It is that same Wisdom
who from"the first, before the
beginning of the earth" has taken
pleasure in who we arc, and
delights in who, through the love
which will not be frustrated, we
finally will be.
Whatever other interests can be
detected in the Wisdom sung
about as God's wisdom, this one
is unmistakably clear. And if you
and I believe ourselves to have
been redeemed, or believe our
selves at the point of being claimed
by a presence and power we can
only understand as holy, we should
be able to find in ourselves some
thing of what has been at work
in God's wisdom forever — "rejoic
ing in the inhabited world, and
delighting humankind."
All of humanity. All of our lives,
from first cry to last breath. All
that was made, all that has fallen
apart, all that is under repair, all
that will be completed. The one
we know by the name God is
faithful. God is the one who, out
of love, and in ways logic has no
power to imagine, makes your life
a delight, and makes our life to
gether a cause for rejoicing.
