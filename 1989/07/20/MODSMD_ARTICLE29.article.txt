Romans 5: 1-5
Therefore, now that we have been justified
through faith, let us continue at peace with
God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through
whom we have been allowed to enter the
sphere of God's grace, where we now stand.
Let us exult in the hope of the divine splendor
that is to be ours. More than this: let us even
exult in our present sufferings, because we
know that suffering trains us to endure, and
endurance brings proof that we have stood the
test, and this proof is the ground of hope.
Such a hope is no mockery, because God's
love has flooded our inmost heart through the
Holy Spirit he has given us.

Proverbs 8: 22-31
'The Lord created me the beginning of his works,
before all else that he made, long ago.
Alone, I was fashioned in times long past,
at the beginning, long before earth itself.
When there was yet no ocean I was born,
no springs brimming with water.
Before the mountains were settled in their place,
long before the hills I was born,
when as yet he had made neither land nor lake
nor the first clod of earth.
When he set the heavens in their place 1 was there,
when he girdled the ocean with the horizon,
when he fixed the canopy of clouds overhead
and set the springs of ocean firm in their place,
when he prescribed its limits for the sea
and knit together earth's foundations.
Then 1 was at his side each day,
his darling and delight,
playing in his presence continually,
playing on the earth, when he had finished it,
while my delight was in mankind.'

John 16: 8-15
'When he comes, he will confute the world,
and show where wrong and right and judgement
lie. He will convict them of wrong, by their
refusal to believe in me; he will convince them
that right is on my side, by showing that I go
to the Father when I pass from your sight;
and he will convince them of divine judgement,
by showing that the Prince of this world stands
condemned.
'There is still much that I could say to you,
but the burden would be too great for you
now. However, when he comes who is the
Spirit of truth, he will guide you into all the
truth; for he will not speak on his own au
thority, but will tell only what he hears; and
he will make known to you the things that
are coming. He will glorify me, for everything
that he makes known to you he will draw from
what is mine. All that the Father has is mine,
and that is why I said, "Everything that he
makes known to you he will draw from what
is mine."'
