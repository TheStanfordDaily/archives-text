## Suspect's diary gives him away Stanford grad arrested in computer thefts 
### Karen Kramer Staff writer 
An incriminating diary led police to arrest
1988 Stanford graduate James Anthony
Ransom July 10 for the theft of approxi
mately $15,000 worth of University-owned
computers. The diary provided police with
evidence that Ransom was responsible for
six computer burglaries — mostly from the
Hoover Institute — between January and
November 1988.
Initially the case was brought to the
attention of the police when a student who
purchased a computer from Ransom became
suspicious of what he thought were
scratchmarks over the engraved Stanford
identification number.
After University police checked their files
and found that the stolen serial number

unusual, we feel that it is going to be good
evidence.'

matched that of a computer reported stolen
from Hoover, they obtained a warrant for
Ransom's arrest for the possession of stolen
property. He was taken into custody at
North County Jail in Palo Alto July 3 and
released on his own recognizance.
"After he was booked the diary was
brought to our attention," Stanford Police
Detective Keith Viveiros said. "We obtained
a search warrant for the diary and found
incriminating statements that made me

lievc he had other stolen property."
The diary was discovered by Betty Anne
Greene, Ransom's supervisor at his job at
the Stanford Medical Center. Because he
failed to notify his employers when taken
into custody July 3, Ransom had been fired
from the job, where he was responsible for
monitoring sheep in a cardiovascular lab.
Greene discovered the diary while cleaning
out his workplace.
"She didn't realize what it was. She read

a few passages and realized the author was
confessing crimes and then brought it to
the police," Viveiros said.
Before reading the diary, Viveiros said,
"We obtained a search warrant because a
diary is so inherently private." Police then
used the information in the diary as a basis
for the subsequent warrant for his arrest
and the search warrant for his residence in
Redwood City.
When confronted with the diary, Ransom
admitted to the crimes. However, the ad
mission "was probably academic, as far as
we're concerned," Viveiros said. Although
using a diary as evidence is "pretty unusual,"
Viveiros commented, "we feel that it is
going to be good evidence."
Ransom, whose bail at the North County
Jail was set at $50,000, will enter his plea
next Thursday.
