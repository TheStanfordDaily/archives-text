## Making conversation: Robert Gregg assembles community 
### Susan McKean Mark Weiner Editorial staff 
Religion — at least religion of the sort I
find compelling — participates fully in
what is fundamental to the university,
namely trying to open and deepen ques
tions and come to more reliable, if still
provisional, solutions of things. I don t
view religious pursuits as alternatives to
the kinds of enterprises that take place
in universities, but as consonant with
them.

There's a certain calm energy
to the Dean of the Chapel Robert
Gregg.
He speaks it with his carefully
chosen words softened with a
slight Southern accent.
In the middle of conversation,
he easily extends a friendly touch.
His expression moves quickly,
generously between delight and
concern.
He seems to have no excesses,
no facades.
Gregg attends to the moment
at hand fearlessly, with acute per
ception and candor.
Rut he doesn't leave behind his
past.
He carries with him the memory
of his political activism in the late
19605. He projects an intimacy
with teaching, fostered during his
rigorous academic years at Duke
University in the 19705. The dif
ficulties and thrills of his move to
Stanford animate his speech.
Gregg makes time for people
and takes them seriously — espe
cially students.
He extends this human com
mittment to issues both far beyond
Stanford and tc those most deeply
hidden here.
He has been active in working
to end apartheid in South Africa.
He is an incisive critic of discrim
inatory gender relations. And he
is fervently engaged in efforts to
build improved " minority
majority" relations at Stanford.
Gregg received his bachelor's in
English at the University of the
South. He earned a bachelor of
sacred theology at the Episcopal
Divinity School in Cambridge,
Mass.
Gregg began his doctoral work
in religious thought at Rrown Uni
versity in 1968, but after two years
there, he transferred to the Uni
versity of Pennsylvania.
Gregg has published widely and
in great quantity. His works in
clude two books, "Consolation
Philosophy: Greek and Christian
Paideia in Basil and the Two
Gregories" and "Early Arianism:
A View of Salvation."
Gregg taught Patristics and
Medieval Church History as a pro
fessor at Duke until 1987, when
he assumed the chaplancy at Stan
ford.

What are your duties as
chaplain. 7
Officially, I have three duties.
First, I'm dean of Memorial
Church, which means that I'm re
sponsible for the things that hap
pen there and for the things that
are done by people associated with
the chapel.
I'm also dean of Religious Af
fairs, which means that I consult
with and encourage all the differ
ent religious groups on campus.
In some cases, I try to monitor
and make sure that these groups
arc cooperative, and that their ac
tivities are honestly advertised,
honestly executed and so on.
Sometimes, this involves trying
simply to encourage cooperation
and understanding between the
different religious groups on
campus.
Just in parenthesis, one of the
frustrations here, from my point
of view, is that there are a lot ot
people who are not officially as
sociated with any religious group
who I think really need to be
partners in whatever discussions
we have about definitions of com
munity, ethics and ethical issues
on and off this campus.
Sometimes what I'm doing with
Religious Affairs doesn't incor
porate people who aren't officially
connected with any kinds of reli
gious groups but who are people
with whom I, at least, want to be
in conversation on a regular basis.
I'm speaking here of people I'd
call "committed agnostics" in the
technical sense of the word "ag
nostic."
Presently, for instance, I'm
dealing with some people who
really feel jammed when there arc
prayers at official university func
tions. They feel that their space
is being violated. I think that's an
important issue to talk about.
And then, at least at the official
level, the third thing that 1 do as
part of my job — since I required
it as part of my coming here —
is that I teach on a regular basis.
I have a faculty appointment in
Religious Studies and I teach both
in the Classics and Religious
Studies Departments.
Formally, those arc the three
zones in which I officially operate.
The realities, however, arc
much more interesting.
And the only way to get at the
realities would be to pull out my

date book from some typical week
during the school year and just
look at the kind of things that 1
was engaged with.
They could be anything from
participating in a discussion about
what Stanford is going to do with
Ohlone Indian "remains" in its
possession, to participating in a
discussion on the use of animals
in experimentation, to giving very
personal counseling to people who
are having difficulty settling into
Stanford, or are experiencing
roommate hostilities, or sometimes
having a range of serious problems
— for instance, suicidal feelings,
suffering estrangement in relation
ships.

The main reason that I'm attracted to
this kind of work is that nearly everyone
here, by definition, is engaged in some
kind of search for, or attempt to come to
some reasonably precise sense of a
system of meaning.

And then of course I have Sun
day morning responsibilities.
Why does Stanford need a
chaplain?
I think the rationale in late 20th
century America on the reportedly
secularized West Coast probably
is, Well, you really ought to have
a chaplain around — someone
who can provide guidance and
identify and articulate moral ques
tions. There is this kind of
continuing mythology that yuu
have a couple of figures whose
role in the university is to be
lightning rods for heavy-duty
moral and ethical crises — people
who are kind of Jeramiahs in the
midst of a thoroughly perverse, or
at least insensitive, set of people.
One of the reasons why I don't
like that model as dean of the
Chapel is that 1 think that you've
given up the game if you've tried
to lay that task on one person —
or a few. That's not the way a
community goes about its sense
of what it's willing to live for. 1
reject that kind of description of
what I'm about.
In the first place, I'm not famous
for my penetrating analyses of ex

ical and moral issues. I'm an his
torian ot religions. I worked as an
academic for 20 years before I
came to this particular post.
I don't know what the job of
dean of the Chapel is in general,
because this is the only place that
I've known anything about it.
Frankly, I'm still improvising on a
weekly and sometimes daily and
hourly basis. In the first couple of
years, I've spent an awful lot of
time simply responding to institu
tional and human issues as they
came up. I'm just now able to sit
back and say, "Here are some
things that I don't see getting ad
dressed."
The main reason that I'm at

tracted to this kind of work is
that nearly everyone here, by def
inition, is engaged in some kind
of search for, or attempt to come
to some reasonably precise sense
of a system of meaning.
I think that a fairly well-tuned
philosophy is a system of meaning.
1 think a fairly well-tuned aca
demic discipline can result in a
system of meaning. And I think
every specific religion is an attempt
to come up with a coherent system
of meaning.
So on the theory that this is a
community in which there are a
number of parallel systems of
meaning (sometimes overlapping,
sometimes conflicting) which vie
for people's allegiance and atten
tion, 1 think that religious com
munities have something to
contribute — not as alternatives,
but as contributors to a campus
and institution-wide search for sig
nificant meaning.
Religion — at least religion of
the sort 1 find compelling — par
ticipates fully in what is funda
mental to the university, namely
trying to open and deepen ques
tions and come to more reliable
if still provisional solutions of
things. 1 don't view religious pur

suits as alternatives to the kinds
of enterprises that take place in
universities, but as consonant with
them.
Now to get that idea a little
more grounded in specific realities
.. . underneath all this talk that
we generate about multi-cultural
and multi-ethnic community, what
we have are a number of discrete
groups and finally a whole lot ol
individuals all of whom bear in
themselves particular histories out
of which they've constructed their
own meaning systems. One of the
real jobs that I think I have, alonjy
with other people who share some
objectives about what would make
life here genuinely interesting and
exciting, is to break down the
resistances that prevent dialogue
across encountered boundaries or
obstacles.
So 1 want not only to be in the
conversation, but to try to make
the conversation more enthralling
the conversation about who
we are as a group of people gath
ered in this place.
Does the Stanford environ
ment generate any particular
spiritual questions?
My hunch is that Stanford's
probably not that different from
other places, in that there are a
lot more people who have
curiosity about the kinds of issues
that religion engages than there
are people who arc willing to be
associated with specific religious
groups.
One of the things that always
intrigues me is the fairly significant
interest in why religious groups
take the positions they do about
particular issues, whether it's
sexual practices, death, nuclear is
sues, whatever. Among Stanford
students, 1 don't find crashing
yawns around these questions.
So my hunch is that to the
extent that religions tend to con
tinue to chew on genuinely inter
esting human and global issues,
then people will remain curious
about why religions take the
stances that they do, without nec
essarily wanting to sign on the
dotted line for membership.
I have no idea what percentage
of Stanford students, graduate or
undergraduate, claim to be offi
cially associated with a religious
