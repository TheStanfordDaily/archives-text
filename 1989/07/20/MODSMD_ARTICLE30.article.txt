## Making conversation: Robert Gregg assembles community 
### Susan McKean Mark Weiner Editorial staff 
Religion — at least religion of the sort I
find compelling — participates fully in
what is fundamental to the university,
namely trying to open and deepen ques
tions and come to more reliable, if still
provisional, solutions of things. I don t
view religious pursuits as alternatives to
the kinds of enterprises that take place
in universities, but as consonant with
them.

There's a certain calm energy
to the Dean of the Chapel Robert
Gregg.
He speaks it with his carefully
chosen words softened with a
slight Southern accent.
In the middle of conversation,
he easily extends a friendly touch.
His expression moves quickly,
generously between delight and
concern.
He seems to have no excesses,
no facades.
Gregg attends to the moment
at hand fearlessly, with acute per
ception and candor.
Rut he doesn't leave behind his
past.
He carries with him the memory
of his political activism in the late
19605. He projects an intimacy
with teaching, fostered during his
rigorous academic years at Duke
University in the 19705. The dif
ficulties and thrills of his move to
Stanford animate his speech.
Gregg makes time for people
and takes them seriously — espe
cially students.
He extends this human com
mittment to issues both far beyond
Stanford and tc those most deeply
hidden here.
He has been active in working
to end apartheid in South Africa.
He is an incisive critic of discrim
inatory gender relations. And he
is fervently engaged in efforts to
build improved " minority
majority" relations at Stanford.
Gregg received his bachelor's in
English at the University of the
South. He earned a bachelor of
sacred theology at the Episcopal
Divinity School in Cambridge,
Mass.
Gregg began his doctoral work
in religious thought at Rrown Uni
versity in 1968, but after two years
there, he transferred to the Uni
versity of Pennsylvania.
Gregg has published widely and
in great quantity. His works in
clude two books, "Consolation
Philosophy: Greek and Christian
Paideia in Basil and the Two
Gregories" and "Early Arianism:
A View of Salvation."
Gregg taught Patristics and
Medieval Church History as a pro
fessor at Duke until 1987, when
he assumed the chaplancy at Stan
ford.

What are your duties as
chaplain. 7
Officially, I have three duties.
First, I'm dean of Memorial
Church, which means that I'm re
sponsible for the things that hap
pen there and for the things that
are done by people associated with
the chapel.
I'm also dean of Religious Af
fairs, which means that I consult
with and encourage all the differ
ent religious groups on campus.
In some cases, I try to monitor
and make sure that these groups
arc cooperative, and that their ac
tivities are honestly advertised,
honestly executed and so on.
Sometimes, this involves trying
simply to encourage cooperation
and understanding between the
different religious groups on
campus.
Just in parenthesis, one of the
frustrations here, from my point
of view, is that there are a lot ot
people who are not officially as
sociated with any religious group
who I think really need to be
partners in whatever discussions
we have about definitions of com
munity, ethics and ethical issues
on and off this campus.
Sometimes what I'm doing with
Religious Affairs doesn't incor
porate people who aren't officially
connected with any kinds of reli
gious groups but who are people
with whom I, at least, want to be
in conversation on a regular basis.
I'm speaking here of people I'd
call "committed agnostics" in the
technical sense of the word "ag
nostic."
Presently, for instance, I'm
dealing with some people who
really feel jammed when there arc
prayers at official university func
tions. They feel that their space
is being violated. I think that's an
important issue to talk about.
And then, at least at the official
level, the third thing that 1 do as
part of my job — since I required
it as part of my coming here —
is that I teach on a regular basis.
I have a faculty appointment in
Religious Studies and I teach both
in the Classics and Religious
Studies Departments.
Formally, those arc the three
zones in which I officially operate.
The realities, however, arc
much more interesting.
And the only way to get at the
realities would be to pull out my

date book from some typical week
during the school year and just
look at the kind of things that 1
was engaged with.
They could be anything from
participating in a discussion about
what Stanford is going to do with
Ohlone Indian "remains" in its
possession, to participating in a
discussion on the use of animals
in experimentation, to giving very
personal counseling to people who
are having difficulty settling into
Stanford, or are experiencing
roommate hostilities, or sometimes
having a range of serious problems
— for instance, suicidal feelings,
suffering estrangement in relation
ships.

The main reason that I'm attracted to
this kind of work is that nearly everyone
here, by definition, is engaged in some
kind of search for, or attempt to come to
some reasonably precise sense of a
system of meaning.

And then of course I have Sun
day morning responsibilities.
Why does Stanford need a
chaplain?
I think the rationale in late 20th
century America on the reportedly
secularized West Coast probably
is, Well, you really ought to have
a chaplain around — someone
who can provide guidance and
identify and articulate moral ques
tions. There is this kind of
continuing mythology that yuu
have a couple of figures whose
role in the university is to be
lightning rods for heavy-duty
moral and ethical crises — people
who are kind of Jeramiahs in the
midst of a thoroughly perverse, or
at least insensitive, set of people.
One of the reasons why I don't
like that model as dean of the
Chapel is that 1 think that you've
given up the game if you've tried
to lay that task on one person —
or a few. That's not the way a
community goes about its sense
of what it's willing to live for. 1
reject that kind of description of
what I'm about.
In the first place, I'm not famous
for my penetrating analyses of ex

ical and moral issues. I'm an his
torian ot religions. I worked as an
academic for 20 years before I
came to this particular post.
I don't know what the job of
dean of the Chapel is in general,
because this is the only place that
I've known anything about it.
Frankly, I'm still improvising on a
weekly and sometimes daily and
hourly basis. In the first couple of
years, I've spent an awful lot of
time simply responding to institu
tional and human issues as they
came up. I'm just now able to sit
back and say, "Here are some
things that I don't see getting ad
dressed."
The main reason that I'm at

tracted to this kind of work is
that nearly everyone here, by def
inition, is engaged in some kind
of search for, or attempt to come
to some reasonably precise sense
of a system of meaning.
I think that a fairly well-tuned
philosophy is a system of meaning.
1 think a fairly well-tuned aca
demic discipline can result in a
system of meaning. And I think
every specific religion is an attempt
to come up with a coherent system
of meaning.
So on the theory that this is a
community in which there are a
number of parallel systems of
meaning (sometimes overlapping,
sometimes conflicting) which vie
for people's allegiance and atten
tion, 1 think that religious com
munities have something to
contribute — not as alternatives,
but as contributors to a campus
and institution-wide search for sig
nificant meaning.
Religion — at least religion of
the sort 1 find compelling — par
ticipates fully in what is funda
mental to the university, namely
trying to open and deepen ques
tions and come to more reliable
if still provisional solutions of
things. 1 don't view religious pur

suits as alternatives to the kinds
of enterprises that take place in
universities, but as consonant with
them.
Now to get that idea a little
more grounded in specific realities
.. . underneath all this talk that
we generate about multi-cultural
and multi-ethnic community, what
we have are a number of discrete
groups and finally a whole lot ol
individuals all of whom bear in
themselves particular histories out
of which they've constructed their
own meaning systems. One of the
real jobs that I think I have, alonjy
with other people who share some
objectives about what would make
life here genuinely interesting and
exciting, is to break down the
resistances that prevent dialogue
across encountered boundaries or
obstacles.
So 1 want not only to be in the
conversation, but to try to make
the conversation more enthralling
the conversation about who
we are as a group of people gath
ered in this place.
Does the Stanford environ
ment generate any particular
spiritual questions?
My hunch is that Stanford's
probably not that different from
other places, in that there are a
lot more people who have
curiosity about the kinds of issues
that religion engages than there
are people who arc willing to be
associated with specific religious
groups.
One of the things that always
intrigues me is the fairly significant
interest in why religious groups
take the positions they do about
particular issues, whether it's
sexual practices, death, nuclear is
sues, whatever. Among Stanford
students, 1 don't find crashing
yawns around these questions.
So my hunch is that to the
extent that religions tend to con
tinue to chew on genuinely inter
esting human and global issues,
then people will remain curious
about why religions take the
stances that they do, without nec
essarily wanting to sign on the
dotted line for membership.
I have no idea what percentage
of Stanford students, graduate or
undergraduate, claim to be offi
cially associated with a religious


Ala^Ramale^^Daily
body. Ten, fifteen percent? Some
thing like that. If you asked these
same people whether they were
concerned or interested in reli
gious issues, you'd probably get a
75 percent response.
For someone to say that Stan
ford isn't a specifically religious
place because not that large a
number of people are engaged in
religious groups and go to chapel
seems to me to much too narrowly
define what you mean by religious
— much too narrowly.
Those kinds of changes and
broodings and resolutions that
characterize religious questioning
take place in all but the most
anesthetized people around here.
I'm just not willing to restrict and
narrow my interests — in the
name of religion — to a sharper
focus than others have and in a
way that puts me out of dialogue
with serious people. That wouldn't
make any sense.
Do politics and religion inter
sect?
In my particular religious tradi
tion, which is derived from biblical
history and the history of Chris
tianity, it has proved impossible
to separate the lite of piety from
public and private ordinary life.
That means that it would be very
hard for someone to live a religious
life which simply isolated political
and ethical issues.
And just to look at recent na
tional history, it's no huge surprise
that when human rights activists
rallied around issues of racial in
justice in the United States and
an exceedingly problematic war
enterprise waged in Southeast
Asia, fairly prominent and visible
in that crowd were a lot of clergy
and committed lay people —
people of faith.
This is a tricky issue, because
for the ordained minister, for the
rabbi, for the Buddhist priest, there
is this really clear sense that you
know to whom or to what standard
of truth you are finally account
able. Your loyalties to other insti
tutions that you benefit from and
that you care about — nation,
university, even family — in an
important and ultimate way, none
of these set the decisive terms for
the way you live.
It's a different commitment that
makes you tick and that will reg
ularly put you on a collision course
with many of the established
powers and constellations of
power.
You know how that all plays
into the politics of Stanford. I
would say about this place what
I'd say about any other place where
I've lived and worked: There are
all kinds of historic and
entrenched inequities that just ha
ven't fully been addressed. I don't
think someone in my position is
likely to find a way to live with
any kind of integrity without being
at the intersection of these issues.
Do you feel especially ob
ligated as dean of the Chapel to
speak out against particular in
stitutions and institutionalized
practices at Stanford?
Yes.
That's the simple part of the
answer.
Rut 1 know from my own ex
perience that you have to be alert
to the kind of ambiguity of iden
tifying someone who you think is
making life more difficult than it
needs to be for other people
to remain open to addressing the
particular drives, problems and
dilemmas of the "perpetrator."
To put it real bluntly: Nearly
everyone would acknowledge that
people who commit sexual assault

arc doing something that we really
cannot let happen, out of concern
for victims. And yet if it is possible
that the people who commit these
acts are also in some way victims
of dynamics or victims of their
own behavior, then someone also
has to be available to be with and
even for those people.
So the old-fashioned, white hat
black hat way of splitting up the
world in which you only have to
associate with the good guys is
not open to people in my position.
And that just adds wonderful com
plications. Sometimes I'm sure it
makes it appear that you stand
with the "wrong people."
Docs that keep the church
from making any particular
stands on issues — for instance,
on divestment or abortion?
Well, those are two really inter
esting items. First of all, you have
to be sure what you're talking
about.
I don't see how I could find a
kind and approving word to say
about apartheid as a system and
I don't sec how I could do anything
other than try to find a way to
make the plight of the victims of
apartheid better.
It's still up for debate whether
divestment by itself can really do
what needs to be done to dis
mantle apartheid as a system, as
nearly everyone will acknowledge
who's been close to that situation.
So divestment is a part but not
the only significant part of the
problem about which it seems to
me there is no moral ambiguity.
I think that the abortion ques
tion is much, much trickier. At
issue is how much we really know
in order to be in a position to
talk about it clearly rather than
just passionately. That makes it a
harder issue about which to make
grand slogans and snappy one
liners.
Although I am personally
aligned with the pro-choice way
of thinking about the issue, the
polarization of this discussion into
a bunch of lobbed grenades over
a whole field of questions that
haven't been sufficiently examined

In my particular religious tradition,
which is derived from biblical his
tory and the history of Christianity,
it has proved impossible to sepa
rate the life of piety from public and
private ordinary life. That means
that it would be very hard for some
one to live a religious life which
simply isolated political and ethical
issues.

makes me uneasy about joining
the Kittle camps. The dialogue
and conversation that needs to go
on between the two fixed positions
has not really taken placc — at
least not to my satisfaction.
The fact that it's so difficult to
have a reasonable discussion about
abortion suggests to me that there
is much more definitional work to
be done. And I guess I'm a little
uneasy about seeing the tempera
ture so high when there's so little
light on this issue.
Could you discuss the recent
status of women in spiritual and
religious life?
I can just tell you that my own
history of involvement isn't am
biguous. I participated in the "il
legal" ordination of women to the
Episcopal priesthood in the early
19705. I had close friends who

were among those women. So for
me that issue was, and is, clear.
What for me continues to he a
difficult question is that even in
those groups which have seemed
to sort of throw their arms open
to female religious leadership,
women's comparative salary levels
and their advancement in the
hierarchy and their opportunity to
exercise leadership — well, it's
not a terrifically encouraging saga.
In other words, the church and
religious groups tend to be moving
at about the same pace as society's
institutions.
One of the things that I've come
to appreciate is that it takes people

a long time to fully appropriate
and take into their viscera what
are the really painful and unfair
things that are happening around
them. I guess part of the blockage
on seeing this comes from self
interest — "things seem to be
working all right for me."

But for example, the man who's
coming to join the staff at
Memorial Church next year, Floyd
Tompkins, hinted in some con
versations that he had with people
at Stanford that one of the things
cooking underneath the heated
exchanges between minority and
majority groups and spokesper
sons, and sometimes within racial
and ethnic groups, is a kind of
apprehension about the power of
women. Because that is in many
cases a more threatening issue to
tackle and to really confront and
work through, sometimes it's easier
to go through some of the fairly
well-established scripts that we
have — old complaints in tried
and true, perhaps even "sate" lan
guage.
It's similar to a family — having
an old fight in order to avoid
having the new one which you all
know is hotter and deeper.

That argument — that the ten
sions that underlie male-female re
lationships are a barely visible,
barely articulated and not yet fully
surfaced set of dynamics that we're
now going to have to deal with
— means we're going to have more
conflict in the future, not less,
and more heat, more hurt feelings,
and thus greater need for resolu
tion of misunderstandings.
How do you prepare the Stan
ford community in particular for
such future conflict?
I have a quite simple answer to
that. I'm going to try to get ready
for it and used to it myself. I'm

just going to try to be as honest
as 1 can at the points in which I
myself feel squeezed and jammed.
How to talk with each other. 7
That's not a new problem. But
there certainly are some new ad
vances that we need to make. 1
don't have a kind of grand scheme
or program, you know: "Within
five years everyone will be accom
plished conflict resolvers." 1 don't
have a plan of that sort.
So my only strategy is to try to
get myself as close to the middle
of that set of dynamics as 1 can
and find out what things I've got
to let die — what kind of
thoroughly unhelpful, unjust,
stereotyped assumptions I harbor
that have to go.
So my plan is to keep working
on Gregg, and when asked, com
municate what I think I've learned,
both by way of failures and modest
successes.
One hopes that that will ulti
mately lead to structural changes,
first near to home, then perhaps
with and among others.

How could Stanford institu
tionally overcome gender ine
qualities?
I think that there are two ways
to go on this issue.
One is to smoke out and con
front those fairly entrenched prac
tices and patterns of advancement
and assessment of people's worth
that over long years have tended
not to value women's contribu
tions in the same way as men's.
There are ways of communicating
and even intervening by simply
asking critical questions.
There are ways of calling the
hand of those who perpetuate
practices which consistently
prevent women, minorities, gays
and lesbians from getting an equal
shot at career opportunities, or
opportunities to say what they
think without fear of recrimina
tion.

Sccond, there are some very
positive actions you can take by
way of simply encouraging people
who've been taught not to aspire
to certain positions to go ahead
and aspire to them. There are pos
itive kinds of initiatives that can
really change the face of a depart
ment or a unit within the univer
sity in just one or two moves, that
can dispel a lot of bad myths about
who can and who can't administer,
who can and who can't do this
or that.
For instance, two hundred cou
ples a year get married at Memorial
Church. And there used to be a
system in which people would sort
of look at the stable of ministers
and choose the one with whom
they imagined themselves most
compatible.
Both for convenience's sake and
also by way of wanting to make
a clear statement, I simply assigned
clergy on a rotating basis to
weekends. So that each weekend,
one person on the staff conducts
the wedding ceremonies.
This means that people who
have decided they're going to get
married on June something make
their arrangements with the person
officiating at marriages for that
weekend. And if they happen to
have serious reservations about
whether a woman minister can
really conduct an effective mar
riage, guess what? — they arc not
given a choice. That's who's "on"
And if a couple can't adjust to
that reality, they are free to go to
another church.
And the clear message is, This
is our team of ministers. Bluntly,
we are who we are. Take it or
leave it — but we're not going to
shift this damn thing around for
you. We looked for the best people
we could find to be on this staff,
and we're this team. If you want
to get married here, we're it.
Not only should you not ques
tion it, we think you're extraor
dinarily lucky to get to deal with
this crowd of people.
Do you have any long-term
goals for the Stanford communi
ty?
I think that one of the things
that can be done by me and by
others, which has both an educa
tional and community-enhancing
aspect, is to make accessible more
interesting information about what
inter-faith conversations, if they
got serious, would actually look
like.
I think this is particularly im
portant in North America and in
a place like Stanford, because
given the marvelous demography
of this region, namely the Bay
Area, and given the reflection of
that wonderful diversity on this
campus, we are in a position to
have multi-faith exchange in
something other than the usual
Jewish- Christian kind of con
versations.
So one of the things I've been
working to do at Memorial Church
which is more than just a nod at
what Jane Stanford had in mind
when she built a multi-faith chapel
that's just dripping with Christian
iconography, is to make sure we
regularly have speaking at Univer
sity Public Worship people from
other than the Christian churches.
The appearance of, for instance,
a Buddhist priest or a rabbi, still
takes place within the Christian
ethos of that place at that hour
on Sunday morning, but it's an
attempt to begin to open and
deepen conversation among other
traditions.
That's something I'm particu
larly interested in. I think it's a
community conversation that
we're going to have, fully acknowl
edging our differences before we
start declaring false truces all over
the place.
