## Lyme disease: infected tick bites the bull's-eye 
### Mark Davies 
How many potentially fatal diseases can
you catch in your own backyard? At least
one — Lyme disease.
Fortunately for those ot us who live on
the West Coast, the debilitating illness
caused by the bite of an intected tick
has not yet reached the endemic proportions
it has in some Hast Coast regions.
Since 1977, when the disease was first
identified in Lyme, Conn., the number ot
cases reported annually has increased dram
atically, currently reaching a rate of 5,000
reported cases per year. Lyme disease has
been documented in 43 states and has now
spread to every continent except Antartica.
Dr. Kenneth Vosti of the Stanford In
fectious Diseases Department attributes this
rapid growth in reported cases partially to
the increasing awareness on the part oi
physicians. "It looks like [incidents] are
going up, whereas, in tact, they re not. They
were probably there; they just weren't recog
nized before," Vosti explained.
Twelve years ago doctors had never iden
tified Lyme disease, but now two-thirds of
physicians are familiar with the clinical
symptoms, according to Vosti. At Stanford,

doctors have diagnosed patients with the
illness for several years.
Yet, had these patients contracted the
disease a decade ago, they would have gone
from one doctor to the next — continually
being misdiagnosed.
Despite growing awareness of Lyme dis
ease, doctors still have difficulty recognizing
it. Often, the initial symptoms vary from
swollen joints to heart irregularities, and
change as the disease progresses. The cost
of misdiagnosis increases with time, and
eventually the damage may be irreversible.
The landmark symptom of Lyme disease
is a large bull's-eye rash that appears at
the site of the tick bite. The rash is dark
around the edges, with a hard lump at the
center. However, it is only seen in about
two-thirds of those patients infected with

the disease, according to Vosti.
After the rash disappears, victims some
times complain of headaches, fever and
lethargy, which may also be accompanied
by stiff and swollen joints. In many cases
the joints are so severely affected that Lyme
disease is misdiagnosed as rheumatoid
arthritis.
But even if none of these symptoms ap
pear, the disease may silently run its course.
Sometimes not emerging until years later,
the illness can take the form of a neuro
logical disorder — usually debilitating and
possibly lethal, said Vosti.
Like syphilis, Lyme disease is caused by
a spirochete — a thin, spiral-like bacteria.
As with both afflictions, the bacteria may
lie dormant for many years and strike with
out warning.
The tiny deer tick — scarcely the size
of a pinhead — transmits the bacteria re
sponsible for the deadly disease. The ticks
are already found in isolated populations
from coast to coast, yet they arc multiplying
and expanding to new areas at an alarming
rate.

In New York for example, some counties
were essentially tick-free as late as 1982.
Now, researchers find an average of at least
one deer tick per square yard. This tremen
dous expansion has been linked to the
virtually unchecked growth in the deer pop
ulation, which has been steadily rising tor
almost a century — from less than 300,000
deer in 1900 to 15 million today.
Not all deer ticks carry the disease, how
ever. Only an estimated two to three per
cent are infected in California. But
throughout New England as much as 80
percent of the deer tick population carries
the germs.
Lyme disease is treated also like syphilis,
using antibiotics like penicillin to destroy
the bacteria. Nonetheless, "There are treat
ment failures," admits Vosti.
As Lyme disease spreads across the coun
try, public consciousness is increasing as
well. But Californians, previously not as
severly affected by the disease, will now
need to watch for the symptoms and pay
closer attention to this new danger in theii
backyard.

Dr. Kenneth Vosti of Stanford's Infectious Diseases Department finds Lyme
disease intriguing in that it was identified so late in the history of medicine.
