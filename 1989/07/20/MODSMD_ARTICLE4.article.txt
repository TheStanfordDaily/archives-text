## 
### 
Sidney Hook, a major fig
ure in modern American in
tellectual history, died July
12 at the Stanford Medical
Center of congestive heart
failure. He was 86.
A senior research fellow
at the Hoover Institution,
Hook came to Stanford in
1973 following his retirement
from New York University.
Hook was born in Brook
lyn, N.Y., in 1902. He re
ceived his Ph.D. in 1927
from Columbia University,
where he studied under phi
losopher John Dewey.

Dewey's
philosophy
of pra g -
matism —
also associ
ated with
the phil
o so ph e r s
C.S. Peirce
and William

James — argues that the
validity of a concept should
be tested by examining its
practical results.
Hook later became a
leading proponent of
Dewey's philosophy.
Hook's intellectual life
was marked by a deep con
cern for human freedom. Be
cause of this concern, his life
was also marked by contro
versy.
His 1936 book, "From
I legel to Marx," is widely
regarded as the most incisive
and important critical exam
ination of Marxism ever
made by an American phi
losopher.
But Hook never became
a member of the Communist
Party, and even his early,
sympathetic writings on
Marxism show a concern
that socialism should not be
attained through the
sacrifice of democratic ideals
and institutions.
Indeed, like many Amer
ican intellectuals, Hook later
became a passionate critic of
Soviet communism as prac
ticed under Joseph Stalin.
Hook's critique of Stalinism
was one of the first by a
left-leaning American
scholar.
