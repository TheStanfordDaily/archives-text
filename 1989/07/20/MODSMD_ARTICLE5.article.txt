Stanford Treasurer Rodney Hol
lis Adams, the man who oversaw
the University's $1.6 billion en
dowment, died July 13 of cancer
at his campus home. He was 51.
A national leader among uni
versity investment managers,
Adams was responsible for making
Stanford the first academic insti
tution ever to receive the AAA
financial rating from national bond
rating services without pledging
endowment as collateral.
Adams was also a pioneer in
sophisticated techniques that
produced several million dollars of
additional revenue annually for the
University with virtually no finan
cial risk. Additionally, he was re
sponsible for creating legislation
that made it possible for California

private univer
sities to issue tax
exempt debt.
William Massy,
vice president for
finance at Stan
ford, called
Adams "abso
lutely without
question the best
• .1

university treasurer in the country,
and that probably means the
world."
Innovations credited to Adams
include: beginning to make ven
ture capital investments in 1978-
79; investing in international
equities beginning in 1982; invest
ing in real estate nationwide;
taking advantage of an overvalued
dollar from 1985 to 1987 to make

Adams was 'abso
lutely without ques
tion the best univer
sity treasurer in the
country, and that
probably means the
world.'

a short-term investment in non
dollar bonds; making investments
in private equity portfolios of un
dervalued, emerging growth com
panies; taking part in leveraged
buyouts; and investing in natural
gas and oil rights over the last

three years when they have been
deeply undervalued.
Adams also helped Stanford get
the first California Educational Fa
cilities bonds for student housing
and other projects.
Adams received two degrees
from Stanford: a bachelor's degree
in mechanical engineering in 1960
and a master's in business admin
istration in 1962. After working
with Standard Oil of California
and Granger Associates, he joined
the Stanford staff in 1965 and be
came operations manager of the
Administrative Data Processing
Center. He was named University
treasurer in 1982.
A memorial service will be held
today at 4 p.m. at Memorial
Church.
