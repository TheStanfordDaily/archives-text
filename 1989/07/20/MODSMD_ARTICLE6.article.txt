# Superconductivity on the Farm
## 
### 
More than 1000 top scientists
will be at Stanford next week for
the second annual international
conference on high-temperature
superconductivity.
Two Nobel Prize-winning sci
entists, Robert Schrieffer of UC-
Santa Barbara and Alex Mueller
of IBM Geneva, will participate
in the conference, which is spon
sored by the Applied Physics Dept.
The conference will run Sunday
through next Saturday, with sci
entific meetings beginning Mon

day morning at Memorial Audito
rium and other, smaller
auditoriums.
Superconductivity is a phenom
enon in which materials lose all
electrical resistance when cooled
below a certain temperature. Until
recently it had only been detected
at temperatures very close to ab
solute zero (more than 400 degrees
below zero, Fahrenheit) but new
materials have been found which
permit superconductivity at much
higher temperatures.
