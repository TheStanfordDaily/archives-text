Although specifics regarding the
hiring of an Asian-American
studies professor remain unclear,
the formation of a committee to
search for the new faculty member
is underway.
"We aren't promising to htre,
but we are committed to a thor
ough search," said Kathryn Gillam,
assistant dean of academic affairs.
The first part of the search en
tails choosing a selection commit
tee, which will be composed of
both students and faculty. Ewart
Ihomas, dean of Humanities and
Sciences, is searching for faculty
members to be on the committee,
and the ASSU will be in charge
of choosing student members.
"We are happy the committee
is being set up," said Judy Wu, a
junior who will be in charge of
external affairs for the Asian-
American Students Association
next year. "It looks really positive,"
she added.
Wu said A AS A members want
to make sure they have student
representation on the committee
because AASA was the main
group fighting for the Asian-
American studies professor last
year.
According to Gillam, the com
mittee selection should be com
plete in early Fall so that the
search for the faculty member can
be conducted throughout the
school year. "We hope to have
someone on board in Septcmh
of 1990," she said.

new faculty member would be
hired into. "It is an interdiscipli
nary search," said Gillani, but she
added that the search will con
centrate mostly in humanities and
social sciences.
Ciillam said she hopes that a
new faculty member will receive
a full professor position. She
added, however, that the position
depends on a number of factors,
and the University may end up
hiring an Asian-American studies
assistant professor.
Gillam said other considerations
include the pool of available can
didates and the concerns of the
candidates. She said that after the
search committee votes on candi
dates and makes recommenda
tions, the department, the dean's
office, the provost, the advisory
board and the board of trustees
must approve the candidate.
