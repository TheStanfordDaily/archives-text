## Rethink quarters 
### 
WE ALL KNOW the story.
You're a student. You're taking 18
units. You're involved in a couple of
extracurricular activities.
And it's the end of the quarter.
Three 15-page papers are staring you in the face.
They're mean. They're drooling. They're demanding
sacrifice.
You have a week.
First, you go to the Coffee House and gulp down
a large coffee.
Then, you go :o the library. You check out a couple
of books.
You sit.at your It's ten o'clock in the evening.
You have a long night ahead of you.
But you're not too worried. You've done this before.
You can pound out papers without much problem.
True, you won't be proud of your work. You may
even think it's trash.
But you'll slide by with a "B."
Under the circumstances, that's all that matters ...
We all know the story because it's happened to
pretty much everyone at Stanford. Who hasn't been
forced to generate a shallow and poorly-written paper
because there simply wasn't enough time to produce
anything of intellectual value?
Students will always procrastinate. Many will always
try to "just get by."
But with one basic, simple change, the University
could make tremendous improvements in campus in
tellectual life and undergraduate education.
It could abandon the quarter system.
Some faculty and staff members may think that by
raising the issue of Stanford's academic calendar, we're
beating a dead horse.
After all, the Faculty Senate decided after much
debate to continue using the quarter system in early
1983, and prior to that decision, the issue had been
publicly discussed twice in 10 years.
But a new intellectual consciousness has animated
the Stanford community, a consciousness that is ready
to discuss the issue again.
Debate about the quarter system usually divides
along strict intellectual lines. Those in the humanities
usually demand that Stanford adopt the semester sys
tem, while those in the sciences and engineering
usually uphold the quarter system.
The Stanford community recently has been engaged
in lively and important discussion concerning the role
of the humanities in undergraduate education.
There has been much disagreement during these
debates, but all parties hold one fundamental belief
in common â€” that the Stanford experience must in
clude serious intellectual activity.
Any review and reconstruction of Stanford's human
ities programs also requires a renewed debate about
its academic calendar.
If we continue to live with the quarter system, we
will condemn our students to a humanities education
that is simply second-rate.
