## An invitation 
### 
IMAGINE AN INTIMATE yet unequal relationship
between two people. One person has a desperate
need to give. The other expects to receive.
Let's call one "giver" and the other "receiver."
Giver and receiver communicate each day.
Giver tries to fulfill receiver's needs and expectations
through careful, caring talk. Receiver searches the
words and heart of giver for evidence of something
worthwhile, for reason to remain in the relationship.
Now, suppose -'hat giver and receiver never actually
meet. Suppose that they communicate for the most
part witn a one-way telephone through which only
giver can talk and only receiver can listen.
Bad news. Giver can only hope that receiver is
satisfied. Receiver can only hope that giver will an
ticipate his or her needs.
None of us would enjoy this relationship. It usually
would be difficult, troublesome and unsatisfying. Of
ten, it would harm both giver and receiver.
But right now, you are involved in just such an
association — that between editor and reader, between
a newsjpaper and its audience.
Heres the situation.
Editors need readers. Without readers, a newspaper
is meaningless: It simply serves no purpose. Editors
and writers must educate and entertain their audience
— it's their duty.
Readers need editors. At its best, a newspaper can
do more than inform its audience about noteworthy
people and events.
A good newspaper, a really fine one, can create
community. It can actually cohere many disparate
groups and individuals into a single body. It can
facilitate meaningful conversation between fragmented
elements of a larger whole.
But despite such mutual needs, such potential for
symbiosis, editors and readers rarely talk.
Editors, particularly college editors, often don't take
time to discuss what their paper is and ought to be.
They substitute efficiency for self-examination.
Readers usually don't think of having such discus
sions. If they ever do write their newspaper, their
"letter to the editor" responds to a specific article.
We think it's about time to engage in just such talk.
Summer is an opportune time for us all to consider
the meaning ana significance of the Stanford student
newspaper for our community.
So, we would like to ask you the following questions:
"What should the Stanford Daily/Stanford Weekly do
for the Stanford community? In this regard, where
has it failed and where has it succeeded?"
Please answer these questions very briefly (no more
than 250 words) and send your response to us within
the next two weeks.
We will publish your letters on August 10 with the
hope that doing so will create an interesting, useful
forum for public meditation and debate.
A newspaper is a collaboration between its editors
and its readers.
We hope that you will participate in this partnership
and respond to our request.
