Supreme Court
threatens
14th Amendment
Over six score years ago
this week, on July 28, 1868,
the Fourteenth Amendment
was adopted by Congress.
Today, a sinister and often
inconsistent, "non-activist,"
Stanford-dominated U.S. Su
preme Court is reaching back
into constitutional history to
weaken this amendment.
To add to this potential
move back toward enslave
ment, it would be no
surprise if the President, in
true bush-league form, initi
ated a move in Congress to
enact an amendment or
statute that states: The Four
teenth Amendment shall not
apply to persons born or
naturalized in the United
States with melanism.
There is a critical and
troublesome linkage between
the Fourteenth Amendment
and one of the most power
ful amendments in the Con
stitution — the First, which
is also under threat of being
weakened.
This linkage has
manifested itself at Stanford,
and across the country, as it
relates to people of color.
As one sees efforts by con
servatives to narrow and
restrict the First Amendment
as it applies to the flag, we
see, inversely, attempts by
these same conservatives to
have a liberal (God forbid!)
interpretation of this amend
ment in allowing individuals
to voice racist feelings about
— or desecrate, if you will —
people of color.
If I am to understand cor
rectly the recent opinion of a
Stanford constitutional law
professor on the freedom to
make racist statements and
expressions, he said that
these matters should
precipitate more speech, not
less. That being the case,

there should be more torch
ing, not less.
But these arc all short
sighted views about the flag.
Amending the Constitution,
or enacting a statute, is not
going to affect how all
citizens feel about this coun
try inwardly, over the long
term — which should be the
focus of the Presidency, Con
gress, the Supreme Court
and the nation.
Congress and the state
legislatures can enact what is
criminal conduct regarding
the flag, but they cannot
legislate patriotism; it has to
be earned. Until these bodies
and the nation do the right
thing and make the Four
teenth Amendment real and
meaningful in the lives of all
citizens, there will be a large
segment of this country that
will carry a torch in its mind
and heart about this country
and its flag — and it is not a
torch of affection.

Editorial wrongly
assumes students
procrastinate
The July 20 "Rethink Quar
ters" editorial insults the
average Stanford student.
The editorial's assumption

that the semester system
would encourage "deeper"
thinking in the humanities is
illogical and false.
The assumption is based
on student procrastination:
Students who procrastinate
will have more time at the
end of the quarter. The edi
torial does not, however,
point out that students must
take more classes in the se
mester system. I would rather
have two papers in one
week then four papers in
three weeks. Also, is it fair to
assume that every student
will procrastinate until the
end of the quarter? Many
students, myself included,
work ahead in order to turn
in the highest quality work. I
would hope that the
"average" Stanford student
would show the same dedi
cation.
If the science and engi
neering students can gain
comprehensive knowledge
under the quarter system,
why can't tne humanities
majors? The quarter systen
prepares students for reality:
deadlines. The semester sys
tem only caters to procras
tination. 1 hope that future
discussion of term length
focuses on overall workload
and timing considerations —
not on end of quarter
workload due to procrastina
tion.
