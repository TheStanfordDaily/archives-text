## Barbecuing for amity between students and administrators 
### 
IT'S NOT A NEW tactic to cagc
boldness in familiar terms.
Take, for instance, these:
barbecue, sodas, plastic forks,
music, summer evening, stu
dents, teachers, green grass.
Sufficiently familiar.
Now take this: Of its own accord,
the Student Affairs office makes an
effort to improve and encourage
continued dialogue with the students
who were involved with and ar
rested for the May 15 takeover of the
President's Office.
Sufficiently bold.
Last Thursday evening, this signifi
cant University gesture was cloaked
in the ordinariness of a familiar,
congenial barbecue with all the trap
pings.
Of course, it's not a new idea. But
neither are hostility and bad commu
nication outdated, unfortunately.
Student Affairs held the dinner for
members of Agenda for Action, the
student group that staged the
takeover and spearheaded this
spring's movement for multicultural
education and increased student
voice in University decision-making.
I attended the barbecue at the
invitation of a friend.
About 50 students and faculty
milled around a courtyard, splitting
into small groups, sipping sodas,
discussing movies and the unexpec
tedly lavish feast laid out before
them.
The personal, casual manner of the
dinner augmented the simple but
noteworthy fact that students and
administrators were interacting. The

event carried an important message.
It said: We're not faceless enemies.
We're people who are struggling
over the same questions — people
who eat, drink, laugh and talk and
need to know one another in order
to help each other.
Neither camp had persuasive
reasons to believe the other would
be amicable, or that a meeting would
be worthwhile. This spring, con
frontation often replaced cooperation
when students and administrators
interacted. Although I generally think
confrontation is nonconstructive, it
was appropriate this spring. The
confrontation identified and mea
sured the ideological differences on
campus.
But cooperation, rather than con
frontation, befits a midsummer's
evening around fresh fruit and shish
kebab.
And personal conflicts need to be
removed before the University can
enact significant structural change.
That understanding was at the
heart of Student Affairs' culinary
diplomacy.
The barbecue signaled that the
administration was willing to volun
tarily interact and establish more
friendly relations with students.
Despite under-the-breath grumblings
and awkward silences when Assoc.
Dean of Student Affairs Michael
Jackson passed out name tags at the
tables, students seemed to recognize
this.
But the barbecue also revealed that
students and administrators need to
be on their guard in the coming

year.
Intimacy can often confuse issues,
and accord based on simplification
cannot last. The barbecue is a con
structive instrument in student
administration efforts to improve
Stanford, but it is not the final goal.
Students do not simply want
peaceable relations with certain indi
viduals. They want concrete
structural changes. Good personal
relations can help achieve those
changes, but amity between personal
ities is not an end in itself.
During dinner, Jackson, evidently
somewhat nervous as the administra
tion's emissary in the students' still
hostile territory, spoke candidly
about the reasons for the barbecue
and his hopes for improved relations
in the future.
He emphasized the need to intro
duce decency and care into the
important, but inevitably tricky, Uni
versity discussions about multicul
turalism and students' voice in
University decision-making. The
barbecue was not intended to buy
off the students, or to iron out dif
ference, Jackson said. It was — and I
agree — a first step toward more
constructive interaction.
But more than knowing each
other's names, faces and hometowns,
both the University and students
need to learn how to negotiate, not
capitulate.
Students must not hastily throw up
their hands in the air about individ
ual administrators whom they invest
with omnipotence and upon whom
they lay all blame. Administrators

and faculty must not plug their ears
to students who talk loudly.
Both groups need to practice
greater self-discipline.
Also, both students and administra
tors need to expand their con
stituency.
By punishing student protesters
this spring, the University acciden
tally reinforced the attitudes of poli
tically complacent students at
Stanford. The students who already
arc committed to the cause of stu
dent empowerment need to recruit
more students from the soft-spoken
ranks on which the University has
doted by default. Otherwise, Agenda
for Action will be marginal and
indefensible as a real student move
ment.
Administrators need to include
those departments and schools that
have been absent from discussions
about multicultural education, those
that have been conveniently ignored
by participants in the dialogue.
Case in point: Last week's barbe
cue was attended by the predictable
faculty and staff: Kennell Jackson,
Sally Cole, Norm Robinson, Robert
Gregg — to name a few. These are
not the people that need to meet the
students. They already know them.
Pervasive change will only take
place if more people, and new
people, are embraced in the debate
and invited to the dinner table.
