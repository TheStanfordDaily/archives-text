If you ever talk to Emily Shihaden about Jewish-
Palestinian hostilities, don't use the word "complex."
According to Shihaden, co-author of the San Fran
cisco Mime Troupe's comedy "Seeing Double," Amer
icans call the Jewish-Palestinian conflict "complex" in
order to avoid dealing with the painful human issues
that surround it.
