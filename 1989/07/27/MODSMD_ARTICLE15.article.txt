## Politics in the park: audiences are 'seeing double'

If you ever talk to Emily Shihaden about Jewish-
Palestinian hostilities, don't use the word "complex."
According to Shihaden, co-author of the San Fran
cisco Mime Troupe's comedy "Seeing Double," Amer
icans call the Jewish-Palestinian conflict "complex" in
order to avoid dealing with the painful human issues
that surround it.








I hat's a familiar sentiment in
the Mime Troupe. How can the
bitter war in Israel cease, ask mem
bers of' the 12-person political
theater collective, when so many
people call it "complex" — and
so refuse to work towards recon
ciliation?
Members of the Stanford com
munity now have the opportunity
to work towards such reconcilia
tion when the Mime Troupe per
forms "Seeing Double" in Palo
Alto on Friday, August 4 at 7:30
p.m. at Jordan High School (750
N. California).
The production is sponsored by
Intoto, a group dedicated to en
riching the community with multi
cultural events in the arts. An
$8.00 donation is requested.
"Seeing Double" is a story of
mistaken identity. In it, two very
different young Americans — one

Jewish, the other Palestinian —
travel to the Israeli-occupied West
Bank.
The Palestinian, Salim Razali,
is (apparently) completely apoliti
cal. His major ambition is to cut
an album with his band.
David Goldberg, Salim's Jewish
double, is in the midst of a spiritual
awakening. A brilliant computer
programer, David is intent on
living on an Israeli Kibutz.
The two young Americans rep
resent apparently unreconcilablc
ideological poles.
But through comic circum
stances, Salim and David stumble
into each others shoes and see
through each other's eyes. Salim
is allowed to observe the life of
Zionists; David witnesses the bi
ographies of Palestinians in Israel.
Together, Salim and David's
dramatic experiences facilitate a
process of self-examination and
healing that usually leaves audi
ence members' mouths agape.
"We like to make them cry,"
says Joan Holden, the play's sec

ond co-author.
The San Francisco Mime
Troupe began in 1959. The
brainchild of R.G. Davis, the
Troupe was intended to a be an
independent self-supporting polit
ical theater company.
The troupe performed silent
performance art for approximately
a year-and-a- half, until Davis per
ceived that "in order to get his
message across to Americans, you
needed to add words," according
to Barbara Jeppesen, the troupe's
publicist.
The troupe began to perform
classical Italian street theater in
1962, when it first presented a
free outdoor park performance —
now the troupe's trademark. Soon,
it added musical accompaniment
to its pieces.
In the 19605, the multi-cultural,
multi-ethnic group grew wildly
popular for its comic, energetic
and politically-charged style.
Soon, it included over 50 mem
bers.
As a collective, all Mime

Troupe decisions have been made
by a process of consensus since
1970. The troupe's goal, says Jep
pesen, has been "to be an author
of change — to show that you
can make a difference politically
— rhat all it takes is a change in
your attitude."
The Mime Troupe has won nu
merous awards, including a Tony
in 1987 tor "Excellence in Regional
Theater,'' and has toured exten
sively throughout the United
States, Canada and Europe. It has
also performed in Cuba and Nic
aragua.
Troupe members support them
selves largely through donations
solicited after free public park
performances in San Francisco.
They also are supported by
charitable grants, including one
from the National Endowment for
the Arts.
"Seeing Double" departs from
traditional Mime Troupe plays,
which present a perspective
decidedly on the left, in that it
portrays no villain. Neither Pales

tinians nor Jews arc characterized
as "the enemy," and the authors
have been careful to present a full
spectrum of political beliefs in both
parties.
"We've argued strongly for com
promise," says co-author Holden.
Shihadcn agrees.
"We want to encourage a proc
ess of active listening," she says,
a process in which "injustice is
acknowledged," examined and
dealt with. "When there's ac
knowledgement, the healing
starts."
