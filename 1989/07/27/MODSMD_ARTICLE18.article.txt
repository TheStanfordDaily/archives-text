# A 						few summer movie surprises
## Yankovic's 'UHF' is both silly and hilarious 
### Evan Tuchinsky Staff writer 
If you are not a fan of
"Airplane," skip this film. If "Weird
Al" Yankovic is too weird for you,
his movie will be too.
But if you don't mind more than
just a modicum of silliness, "UHF"
may well be the answer to the
question "What should we do
tonight?" Campy but creative,
Yankovic's big-screcn debut is as
hysterical as his video parodies,
laugh-packed from the "Raiders of
the Lost Ark" opening to the
"Gone with the Wind" conclusion.
The premise behind the mad
ness is that the perennially
unemployable George, who gets
fired from job after job for
daydreaming, is hired by his uncle
to manage a failing UHF station,
Channel 62. The station exclu
sively shows reruns and commer
cials from demented car dealers
— "I'll club a baby seal to make
a deal!" one boasts — and George
decides some fresh, new program
ming would improve ratings.
From here, it is pretty obvious
where the movie goes. Yankovic's
mind unleashes an uproarious pro
gramming list, with game shows
like "Wheel of Fish" and action
movies like "Gandhi II" ("He's
back, and he's mad!"). Needless
to sav. the station rockets un the

ratings charts, mobilizing the evil
manager at Channel 8 into
nefarious action.
The plot is overly cliched, but
that's the point. Yankovic uses
the story as a vehicle for his vig
nettes, tying together his snippets
of insanity with a strand of con
tinuity. It's like a 97-minute ver
sion of a "Weird Al" video.
Yankovic isn't the only bright
spot, either. Victoria Jackson of
"Saturday Night Live" plays
George's exasperated dental
hygienist/girlfricnd with her typi
cal whining grace. Anthony Geary

(once Luke of "General Hospital")
is even better as the mad scientist
like station engineer, whose con
sole looks more like a chemistry
lab than a control center.
None of the other names will
ring a bell, but the collection of
familiar faces is astounding. With
so many ecclectic parts, this film
is a character actor's dream.
If you like a little slapstick —
okay, a lot of slapstick — along
with the machinations of a comic
savant, "UHF" is worth tuning in
to.


"Weird Al" Yankovic tries to feed his zany programming ideas
to a fellow ciown in "UHF."
