# Not just another schmaltzy romantic comedy
## 
### Robert Landon Staff writer 
I tried not to like "When I larry
Met Sally." When I saw the first
poster for it over on Fifth Avenue,
I said to myself, "Well, there's one
movie I'd love to miss." For some
reason, Billy Crystal has always
left an aftertaste in my mouth not
unlike saccharine. And even
though Rob Reiner made his im
pressive directing debut with
"Spinal Tap" several years ago, I
still had visions of Meathead in
the back of my mind.
So it was with reluctance that
1 waited in a 40-minute line at a
Greenwich Village theater along
with 200 hardboiled New York
movie-goers. I couldn't understand
why this well-seasoned audience
was waiting for what appeared to

be another schmaltzy romantic
comedy. The movie was filmed in
Manhattan, so I could only imag
ine that they hoped to catch a
glimpse of their apartment building
on film.
Well, my cynicism was rewarded
with a first-rate movie. Many
people have compared "When
Harry Met Sally" to Woody Allen's
"Annie Hall." And it is in fact
the story of a cynical, death
obsessed Jewish guy who falls
hopelessly in love with a slightly
neurotic and quite attractive
shiksa.
But comparisons do neither
movie justice. The plots may be
similar, but "Sally" does not even
attempt to rival the unique way
in which Allen looks at the world.
Your head may not ring with
subtle intelligence when you leave

the theater, as my head did after
I first saw "Annie Hall."
Rut "Sally" is just as funny â€”
maybe more. I have a feeling Nora
Ephron finished the excellent
script, realized the movie was
doomed to he compared to Allen's,
and said, "This is good on its own,
let's do it anyway."
The billboards for the movie
ask rhetorically it two friends can
sleep together without ruining
their friendship. Everyone wants
to think that, yes, of course two
rational people can have sex and
still remain friends.
But everyone also knows that
the answer is a resounding "No!"
At least not without about a dec
ade to let things blow over. And
this tension is the source of most
