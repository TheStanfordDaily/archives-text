# Taking a long, careful listen to the mega-concerts
## Rod Stewart's act has gone stale 
### Mark Pinkus 
Editor's note: We toolc a listen to
two recent concerts at the Shoreline
Amphitheatre in Mountain Vieu'.
Reserved seating is close to the stage;
general admission puts you so far
away you have to strain to see who
is who onstage. Waiting to get
through the amphitheatre's exits after
the concert is a real hassle, and
getting out of parking is worse.
Rut the designers took some pains
to provide customer satisfaction
They proi'ide video screens for the
general admissim folks. The sound
is crisp and stnmg. And huge screens
(which make the venue look like a
huge hasehall backstop) block out
the bitter wind, which tries in vain
to make things frosty.
Most of all, the amphitheatre
seems to be attracting some big-league
talent.

I suppose the fashion show, soc
cer halls and sing-alongs at last
Friday's Rod Stewart concert may
have seemed exciting to new tans.
For those who had seen Rod
Stewart before, though, it was
pretty uninspiring. It's tough for
any artist to tour twice on the
same album, but you would hope
a veteran like Stewart could figure
out how to spice things up a bit.
His latest release, "Out of Or
der," had two appearances in the
Top 20 as a result of the long-term
success of "Lost In You" and
"Forever Young." To cash in on
this somewhat peculiar happening
Stewart didn't even wait a year to
return to the Ray Area, and even
with his 24 albums worth of ex

pcrience, Stewart was unable to
make the two concerts distinct.
The only differences this time
around were the absence of the
classic "You're in My Heart" and
the single encore.
Once again, Stewart's best ma
terial from the '70s was passed up
for more modern dance tunes such
as "Passion," "Infatuation," and
"Do Ya Think I'm Sexy?" The
back-up band, equipped with a
three-piece horn section and a
very talented lead guitarist, was
able to breathe some new life into
these songs, but they still sounded
frightcningly similar to both last
year's renditions and the versions
on the 1982 "Absolutely Live."
