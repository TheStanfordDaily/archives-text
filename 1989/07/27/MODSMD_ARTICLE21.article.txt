## Tom Petty displays a little creative lunacy 
### David Chang Staff writer 
Tom Petty has woken up.
Not to say that the pale,
blond rocker has ever been
completely asleep, but his per
formance last Saturday was an
indication of the new vitality
Petty has been feeling since his
recent collaboration with the
Traveling Wilburys.
He seemed rejuvenated, ex
ulting in his return to the stage
after a two-year hiatus. To
gether with the Heart breakers,
his talented band, Petty ran
through a varied lineup of old

classics and new songs from his
solo album, "Full Moon Fever."
At first, Petty's act sounded
a lot like his old one, especially
when he tried to get the crowd
to sing the words for "The
Waiting." ("Very good," he said
with a half-grin after the in
coherent response).
But evidently he hadn't
named the tour "Strange Be
havior"' for nothing. At the end
of "You Got Lucky," Petty sat
down on a ledge below Ben
mont Tench's keyboards,
leaving guitarist Mike Campbell
