# Inspired strangeness
## Tom Petty displays a little creative lunacy 
### David Chang Staff writer 
Tom Petty has woken up.
Not to say that the pale,
blond rocker has ever been
completely asleep, but his per
formance last Saturday was an
indication of the new vitality
Petty has been feeling since his
recent collaboration with the
Traveling Wilburys.
He seemed rejuvenated, ex
ulting in his return to the stage
after a two-year hiatus. To
gether with the Heart breakers,
his talented band, Petty ran
through a varied lineup of old

classics and new songs from his
solo album, "Full Moon Fever."
At first, Petty's act sounded
a lot like his old one, especially
when he tried to get the crowd
to sing the words for "The
Waiting." ("Very good," he said
with a half-grin after the in
coherent response).
But evidently he hadn't
named the tour "Strange Be
havior"' for nothing. At the end
of "You Got Lucky," Petty sat
down on a ledge below Ben
mont Tench's keyboards,
leaving guitarist Mike Campbell
to finish the song. The song over,
Petty still sat there, guitar on his
lap, head on his knees.
Nervous silence.
Then, his face blank, Petty
raised his guitar and raked his
fingers across the strings. Again.
Again. Tench peered down at him,
trying to figure out what he was
doing.
Then, as if it were perfectly
natural, he got up and careened
into the Clash's "Should I Stay
Or Should 1 Go?"
"We've got this song list we've
been following, more or less," he
said. As the night went on,
though, it became more and more
of the latter, with Petty picking
out songs he wanted to sing: a
poke at Guns n' Roses ("Knockin'
on Axel's Door"), a cover of an
old Elvis tune, a haunting "Loui
siana Rain," that Petty hardly ever
plays in concert.

Petty and the Heartbreakers
also enjoyed themselves with some
experimentation and wild solos.
For some songs, Petty stuck to an
acoustic guitar, with Campbell
plucking what appeared to be a
mandolin. Tench was given the
spotlight to improvise an entire
song's worth of boogie-woogie
piano, and Campbell had a scream
ing, soaring three-minute solo in
tro. Drummer Stan Lynch
cooperated with Petty and Camp
bell to bring every song to a crash
ing, thumping halt.
The last two songs before the
encore were "Refugee" and "Run
ning Down a Dream." The band
brought a fine tension to each
song, frantically sustaining the
tunc until the last possible mo
ment â€” definitely the climax of
an impulsive, energetic show.
After a long break of about five
minutes, they returned for a two
song encore. The last song was
"Jammin' Me," and Petty brought
it into the immediate present, sing
ing, "Take back Jerry Falwell/ Take

Tench improvised
an entire song's
worth of boogie
woogie piano, and
Campbell had a
screaming, soaring
three-minute solo
intro.

back acid rain/Take back Batman."
In a way, he was referring back
to a casual, just-between-friends
plug he had given earlier for
Greenpeace and conservation. "I
don't do styrofoam," he had said,
referring to the plastic cups he
had required for the concert.
1 lis audience must have slept
right through it. When the concert
ended, the lawn was littered with
plastic and paper cups. The crowd
lurched into its cars and squealed
off into the nieht.
