# 'Weekend at Bernie's' satisfies
## 
### Evan Tuchinsky Staff writer 
Movie advertising is typically
about as reliable as Pete Rose's
betting- judgement. Leafing
through the film listings section
and reading the ads, it would seem
that every film is one of the best
in release.
Few films live up to the hype,
but "Weekend at Bernie's" surpris-

McCarthy and Sil
verman continually
renew the film's ex
citement with their
repartee and rep
ertoire of corpse
toting tricks.

ingly Joes. Billed as "Drop dead
fun" and "A lively comedy about
a guy who isn't," "Bernic's"
straddles the realm ot good taste
hut nonthelcss entertains tho
roughly and progresses unpredic
tably.
The film revolves around two
young insurance company employ
ees (played brilliantly by Andrew
McCarthy and Jonathan Silver
man) languishing in the heat and
tedium of their New York City

lives. This under-30 odd couple
uncovers a costly error on the
company books and, as a reward,
receives an invitation to spend the
weekend at their boss Bernie's
beach house.
Bernie is dead on their arrival,
killed by the mob. In order to
keep themselves alive, they haul
Bernie's body wherever they go,
desperately trying to maintain the
illusion that Bernie still lives.
The concept may sound trite,
but the cast pulls it off convinc
ingly. Terry Kiser adds new mean
ing to the term "deadpan" with
his subdued performance as
Bernie, while McCarthy and Sil
verman continually renew the

film's excitement with their repar
tee and repertoire of corpse-toting
tricks.
The pace is lively, thanks to
the keen direction of Ted
Kotcheff, and the story gains steam
as the movie progresses. It is al
most impossible to predict how
che movie will end; the audience
finds itself content to sit hack and
go with the flow.
"Weekend at Bcrnic's" is this
summer's hidden gem. Buried
amidst the mass of blockbusters,
it is a funny and innovative film
that unfailingly achieves its modest
aim: without pretention or emo
tional baggage, it entertains.
