## Bay Area baseball: a not-so-funny joke 
### 
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!!!
HA, HA, HA ... China Basin ... HA,
HA, HA ... CHI-NA BA-SIN.
Excuse me, I'm just having a little trouble con
trolling myself. First, the Giants plan to leave the
icy confines of Candlestick Park and head for a
downtown freezer at Seventh and Townsend. They're
going to build a bargain-basement stadium at no
cost to the citizens of San Francisco.

Voters overwhelmingly reject the plan. "Why move
it its still going to be cold.' And besides," the voters
think aloud, "it's gonna cost us a fortune, no matter
what they say!"
So owner Bob Lurie goes back to the drawing
board. Mayor Art Agnos, long opposed to a down
town stadium, jumps aboard the "Keep the Giants"
bandwagon. They propose a new stadium in China
Basin.
Get this! It's five whole blocks from Seventh and
lownscnd! Five whole blocks clvser, yes closer, to
the frigid waters of the bay.
Why the citizens of The City will vote for this
plan after rejecting the previous one is about as
clear as a smoggy day in Los Angeles. But, hey,
they II be able to waste a lot of money trying to
convince the disinterested and warm, toasty, sunny
Santa Clara can bide its time.
The Giants lease at the Stick doesn't run out 'til
19 c >4. One never knows. Maybe they'll move to
Denver by then after all.
Tony Laßussa is the best manager in baseball.
I know this because I read about it every
day in the Chronicle and the Mercury.
Why then does he insist on making guys named
Young the A's fifth starter? First, Curt. Then Matt.
1 hen Curt, again. Combined they are 3-12 with a
5.21 earned run average.
Meanwhile, up in the A s bullpen is young Todd
Burns. He's 5-2 with a 2.09 HRA. He has only
allowed a miniscule seven baserunners per nine in
nings.
It is possible he'd be less effective a starter. But
doesn tit behoove I he Great Laßussa to find out?
Or has he forgotten that there really is a pennant
race going on? And the Angels are leading.
1 he best manager in baseball surely realizes that
his fourth starter ts Storm "9-4 but a 5.24" Davis.
Surely, he knows he'll have to do something. Or
perhaps he just wants to go fishing this October.
