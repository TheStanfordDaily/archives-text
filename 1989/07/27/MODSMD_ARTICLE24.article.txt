### Mark Rogowsky Editorial staff 
Todd Lichti, who hinted that he might
look for a short-term deal with Denver,
instead signed a five-year deal last Friday
in time to make it to the Nuggets' rookie
camp over the weekend.
The 6-foot-4 guard, widely regarded
as the finest player in Stanford basketball
history, set dozens of school records. He
is likely to sec action at both shooting

guard and point guard for Denver.
Nuggets' General Manager Pete Bab
cock was pleased that Lichti was signed
in time to get him to rookie camp. "We
recognized the benefit for us to have
Todd here," Babcock said. "Whether
good or bad, he will have a chance to
get a feel for the system."
Financial details and other particulars
of the pact were not released. However,
considering that Lichti was the 16th
player selected in the draft, the value

of the deal is likely in excess of $2
million.
