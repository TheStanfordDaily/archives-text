Even though the dog days of August
arc rapidly approaching, Stanford tennis
stars of the past, present and future are
going full bore this week.

The men's tour is in Washington, D.C.
at the Sovran Bank Classic. The large
Cardinal contingent there includes top
seeded Tim Mayotte, Derrick Rostagno,
Jeff Tarango and David Wheaton. All
were winners in the first round.
Mayotte then knocked out John Ross

7-6, 6-2 in the second round. Rostagno,
seeded seventh, also advanced to the
third round after beating Philip Johnson
7-6, 7-5. Tarango beat Michael Robert
son 6-2, 6-3 before falling to Gary Mullcr
7-5, 6-1.
Wheaton was victorious over Dan
Cassidy 6-7, 6-4, 6-0. Though he only
spent one year at Stanford, Wheaton
told USA Today he thought it was a
positive experience.
"I guess I could have turned pro that
year and not gone to [StanfordJ,'" said
Wheaton, the world's 126th-ranked
player.
"But I think it was good for me to
play college tennis and it was good for
me to have gotten another year of de
velopment."
Wheaton noted that when he played
junior tennis with Andre Agassi, Michael
Chang and Jim Courier he knew there
would be success in their future. "1 al
ways believed that my group of young
Americans was going to make a big
impact on the game," Wheaton said.
On the women's side, the action is
at the OTR International in Schenec
tady, NY. Current All-Americans Lisa
Green, Debbie Graham and Sandra Birch
were joined by former Stanford star Leigh
Anne Eldrege and two women who
played one year or less on the Farm
Anna Ivan and Marianne Werdel.
Graham took out her first two oppo
nents, besting Jane Thomas 6-2, 7-5 and
drubbing 16th-seedcd Michelle Jaggard
6-i, 6-4. Jaggard had knocked out
Hldredge 6-3, 4-6, 6-2 in the first round.
Green scored a dominating 6-0, 6-0
double-bagel over Allison Scott. Birch,
the reigning NCAA singles champion,
destroyed Karim Strohmeier 6-4, 6-1.
Ivan, who left Stanford midway
through her freshman year due to per
sonality conflicts, beat Robyn Field 6-2,


Senior Lisa Green shut out Allison Scott 6-0, 6-0 in the first round of
the OTB International in Schenectady, N.Y.
6-2 before falling victim to Stacey
Martin 6-1, 6-3. Martin starred at
Tennessee this past year and was
ranked as high as No. 2 among
collegians.
Werdel, the 14th seed, bested
Karen Shin 7-5, 6-3 in the first
round. Shin gave Stanford's Tami
Whitlinger — the nation's top
ranked player through most of the
season — all kinds of trouble as
a senior at California. She beat

Whitlingcr in both dual meets.
Jonathan Stark and Jared Pal
mer, two highly-touted recruits,
were in action at the California
Open in Aptos. Stark beat Alberto
Paris 6-1, 6-1 in the first round.
Palmer also advanced with a 5-7,
6-2, 6-0 win over Tommy 110 —
the reigning champion in the
junior 18s division.
Palmer had successes this sum
mer in both Paris and London
reaching the finals of the Junior
French Open and the quarterfinals
of the Junior Wimbledon tourna
ment.

Mario Carruth, a top recruit for
the women's team, won her first
round match at Aptos as well.
She bested Judy Newman 6-3, 6-2.
Finally, the latest tennis
rankings reflect the success of Dan
Goldie and Patty Fcndick at Wim
bledon. Goldie jumped 20 notches
to 27th in the world while Fendick
moved up five spots to No. 22.
