Even though the dog days of August
arc rapidly approaching, Stanford tennis
stars of the past, present and future are
going full bore this week.

The men's tour is in Washington, D.C.
at the Sovran Bank Classic. The large
Cardinal contingent there includes top
seeded Tim Mayotte, Derrick Rostagno,
Jeff Tarango and David Wheaton. All
were winners in the first round.
Mayotte then knocked out John Ross

7-6, 6-2 in the second round. Rostagno,
seeded seventh, also advanced to the
third round after beating Philip Johnson
7-6, 7-5. Tarango beat Michael Robert
son 6-2, 6-3 before falling to Gary Mullcr
7-5, 6-1.
Wheaton was victorious over Dan
Cassidy 6-7, 6-4, 6-0. Though he only
spent one year at Stanford, Wheaton
told USA Today he thought it was a
positive experience.
"I guess I could have turned pro that
year and not gone to [StanfordJ,'" said
Wheaton, the world's 126th-ranked
player.
"But I think it was good for me to
play college tennis and it was good for
me to have gotten another year of de
velopment."
Wheaton noted that when he played
junior tennis with Andre Agassi, Michael
Chang and Jim Courier he knew there
would be success in their future. "1 al
ways believed that my group of young
Americans was going to make a big
impact on the game," Wheaton said.
On the women's side, the action is
at the OTR International in Schenec
tady, NY. Current All-Americans Lisa
Green, Debbie Graham and Sandra Birch
were joined by former Stanford star Leigh
Anne Eldrege and two women who
played one year or less on the Farm

Graham took out her first two oppo
nents, besting Jane Thomas 6-2, 7-5 and
drubbing 16th-seedcd Michelle Jaggard
6-i, 6-4. Jaggard had knocked out
Hldredge 6-3, 4-6, 6-2 in the first round.
Green scored a dominating 6-0, 6-0
double-bagel over Allison Scott. Birch,
the reigning NCAA singles champion,
destroyed Karim Strohmeier 6-4, 6-1.
Ivan, who left Stanford midway
through her freshman year due to per
sonality conflicts, beat Robyn Field 6-2,


Senior Lisa Green shut out Allison Scott 6-0, 6-0 in the first round of
