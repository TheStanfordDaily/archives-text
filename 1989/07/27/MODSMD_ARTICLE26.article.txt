Invented Hollywood"

Culture generates its own myths. A sig
nificant myth about the American film in
dustry describes the men who started the
major motion picture studios as barely
literate immigrant primitives, incandescent
with ambition and avarice, somehow
uniquely gifted with a visceral sense ot what
the public wanted. The more benign version
of the myth stops there.
The malign version goes on to assert
that these men were yet another group of
Jews intent on subverting Christian values
through their control of the mass media.
Women's magazine stories and popular
novels of the 1920s warned young women
against coming to Hollywood to seek star
dom, lest they be despoiled and corrupted
by the rapacious executives who ran the
studios. These stories and novels left little
doubt as to the ethnicity of these swarthy
executives with misshapen noses.
Neil Gabler's "An Empire of Their Own"
is a revised standard version of this myth.
It tacitly accepts the proposition that the
film industry was dominated by immigrant
Jews, but it proposes that their entrepre
neurial behavior was a means by which to
assimilate into mainstream America. In fact,
these immigrants beat the old-line tech
nicians and inventors at their own game
by transforming a late 19th century tech
nical marvel into the profitable popular art
and industry of the 20th century. Gabler
asserts that by inventing this industry, the
moguls found a way to reinvent themselves.

The problem with the myth and with
Gabler's psycho-ethnic revisionism is that
myth is not fact, and pop psychology often
has the effect of transforming real events
into special effects. First, many ot the movie
moguls were immigrants from Europe —
but not all of them. Some of the most
exemplary were born in America. Harry
Cohn, head of Columbia Pictures, was born
in New York. Jesse Lasky, who with his
partner, the Hungarian immigrant Adolph
Zukor, brought Paramount to the front
ranks of the studios, was born in San Fran
cisco. So much for the immigrant hypoth
esis.
Sheer economic determinism is a crude
way of accounting for events and institu
tions, but it is a very useful means by which
to understand the motion picture industry.
Compare Gabler's explanatory image of all
those soon-to-be moguls busily using the
moving picture industry to more easily as
similate with the more parsimonious, equally
sensible, if somewhat less poetic explanation
that they chose the film industry simply
because it was highly profitable — not for
the purpose of re-inventing themselves as
personae gratae.
Most of the moguls left promising careers
in other fields. While not even their mothers
would have argued that there were potential
Nobel laureates among them, their lives
suggest that while some may have been
crude, none were stupid. Adolph Zukor, for
instance, was quite successful in the fur
manufacturing trade. Jesse Lasky was a
respected talent agent. Goldwyn and Fox
were successes in the garment trade.
The moguls' eventual fascination with
moving pictures had to do with novelty,
with a taste for risk and with the very
curious notion that one could make con

siderable income solely by charging tor the
right to see something just once. Unlike
manufacturing or the wholesale and retail
trade, the only tangible object that changed
hands was money, and it flowed in the
right direction. The purchaser received
nothing tangible. Unlike the opera, music
or theater, the product needed to be created
only once, instead of at every performance.
As the critic Walter Benjamin noted, film
is infinitely rcproduceablc and there is no
premium on the original, because there is

no original. There is only a negative, the
material necessary to produce the copy.
The deeper issue Gahler raises is whether
deracination is the price of assimilation —
whether assimilation is even possible. The
behavior of the immigrant moguls and their
American-born counterparts certainly was
marked by a drastic apostasy from traditional
belief and behavior. There was little at
tendance at synagogue, except for

ceremonial events like weddings
and funerals. Several married out
side their faith. Some, like Zukor,
Harry Warner and L.B. Mayer,
even became Republicans.
Gabler proposes that the moguls
felt that it was necessary to aban
don their Jewish identities in favor
of new selves defined solely by
wealth and power. Historical
memory of the second Temple in
Jerusalem, according to Gabler,
was supplanted by a studio in 1 lol
lywood, which became to them a
kind of New Jerusalem of the eter
nal present.
Gabler does not even consider
the alternative explanation, that
a similar radical break with tradi
tion characterized many upwardly
mobile immigrant Americans.
Besides, any member of a minority
group knows that discrimination
has much more to do with who
they think you arc than it does
with who you think you arc. Sam
Warner, for instance, knew full
well that he would never be totally
assimilated when he asked his
Catholic wife to wear the largest
of her several gold crucifixes when
they went to lunch with the West
ern Electric executives, whose new
sound process represented the last
best hope for his foundering
studio. The executives' anti-
Semitism was taken for granted.
While there are many interest

ing facts and some helpful works
of the imagination in "An Empire
of their Own," Gabler's proposi
tion that Hollywood was a Jewish
invention is highly dubious if
meant as metaphor and a hit silly
it meant as fact. The physical I lol
lywood was a Protestant fun
damentalist land speculation,
advertised as exemplifying Chris
tian religious values. The Molly
wood of the mind, the moving
picture Hollywood, was probably
more the fault of that WASP-and
a-half D.W. Griffith, who made
the New Testa
ment "Judith of Bethulia" and
went on to make "The Birth of a
Nation," a straightforward
apologia for the Ku Klux Klan
which incidentally became the film
that most profoundly influenced
the aesthetic development of the
cinema.
Hie institutionalization of Hol
lywood as a place where moving
pictures arc made had as much to
do with the gentiles who ran the
banks as it did with the Jews who
ran some of the studios. From
about 1920 on, when expansion
could no longer be financed from
re-invested earnings, the real
power behind the studios lay with
those who had the real money.
There, of course, we hear some
familiar names, like Joseph P. Ken
nedy, scion of the Kennedy clan
and great and good friend of
Gloria Swanson, whose attitude
towards Jews was not wholly dif
ferent from that of Torquemada.
The studio heads and their front

offices were in New York, where
most of the major hankers lived.
Until well after World War 11, Hol
lywood was the well-publicized lo
cation of the manufacturing plant.
Submerged beneath Gabler's in
terpretive problems, "An Empire
of their Own" presents fascinating
biographical sketches of a group
of extraordinary men. Examined
from the present — when one
studio is owned by the inventors
of New Coke and another by an
entrepreneur with a congenital
compulsion to colorize anything
that moves, and when the business
side of the industry is infested
with J.D.'s and M.R.A's whose
contempt for their films is
exceeded only by their lack of
respect for their audience — the
movie moguls look pretty good.
It's probably true that a number
of them were monstrous in their
relations with others, but they per
sonally identified with their audi
ence, they really liked their own
films and, in the fullest sense, they
were the proprietors of their com
panies. I he studios were their per
sonalities and ambitions made
manifest and writ large. No one
of that moving picture generation
ever had any serious pretensions
about making art, but all of them
had a compelling obsession with
craft. They took immense pride
in manufacturing what they liked
to describe as "quality product,"
on time and on budget.
