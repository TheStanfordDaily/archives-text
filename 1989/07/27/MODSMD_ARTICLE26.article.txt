"An Empire of Their Own: How the Jews
Invented Hollywood"

Culture generates its own myths. A sig
nificant myth about the American film in
dustry describes the men who started the
major motion picture studios as barely
literate immigrant primitives, incandescent
with ambition and avarice, somehow
uniquely gifted with a visceral sense ot what
the public wanted. The more benign version
of the myth stops there.
The malign version goes on to assert
that these men were yet another group of
Jews intent on subverting Christian values
through their control of the mass media.
Women's magazine stories and popular
novels of the 1920s warned young women
against coming to Hollywood to seek star
dom, lest they be despoiled and corrupted
by the rapacious executives who ran the
studios. These stories and novels left little
doubt as to the ethnicity of these swarthy
executives with misshapen noses.
Neil Gabler's "An Empire of Their Own"
is a revised standard version of this myth.
It tacitly accepts the proposition that the
film industry was dominated by immigrant
Jews, but it proposes that their entrepre
neurial behavior was a means by which to
assimilate into mainstream America. In fact,
these immigrants beat the old-line tech
nicians and inventors at their own game
by transforming a late 19th century tech
nical marvel into the profitable popular art
and industry of the 20th century. Gabler
asserts that by inventing this industry, the
moguls found a way to reinvent themselves.

The problem with the myth and with
Gabler's psycho-ethnic revisionism is that
myth is not fact, and pop psychology often
has the effect of transforming real events
into special effects. First, many ot the movie
moguls were immigrants from Europe —
but not all of them. Some of the most
exemplary were born in America. Harry
Cohn, head of Columbia Pictures, was born
in New York. Jesse Lasky, who with his
partner, the Hungarian immigrant Adolph
Zukor, brought Paramount to the front
ranks of the studios, was born in San Fran
cisco. So much for the immigrant hypoth
esis.
Sheer economic determinism is a crude
way of accounting for events and institu
tions, but it is a very useful means by which
to understand the motion picture industry.
Compare Gabler's explanatory image of all
those soon-to-be moguls busily using the
moving picture industry to more easily as
similate with the more parsimonious, equally
sensible, if somewhat less poetic explanation
that they chose the film industry simply
because it was highly profitable — not for
the purpose of re-inventing themselves as
personae gratae.
Most of the moguls left promising careers
in other fields. While not even their mothers
would have argued that there were potential
Nobel laureates among them, their lives
suggest that while some may have been
crude, none were stupid. Adolph Zukor, for
instance, was quite successful in the fur
manufacturing trade. Jesse Lasky was a
respected talent agent. Goldwyn and Fox
were successes in the garment trade.
The moguls' eventual fascination with
moving pictures had to do with novelty,
with a taste for risk and with the very
curious notion that one could make con

siderable income solely by charging tor the
right to see something just once. Unlike
manufacturing or the wholesale and retail
trade, the only tangible object that changed
hands was money, and it flowed in the
right direction. The purchaser received
nothing tangible. Unlike the opera, music
or theater, the product needed to be created
only once, instead of at every performance.
As the critic Walter Benjamin noted, film
is infinitely rcproduceablc and there is no
premium on the original, because there is

no original. There is only a negative, the
material necessary to produce the copy.
The deeper issue Gahler raises is whether
deracination is the price of assimilation —
whether assimilation is even possible. The
behavior of the immigrant moguls and their
American-born counterparts certainly was
marked by a drastic apostasy from traditional
belief and behavior. There was little at
tendance at synagogue, except for
