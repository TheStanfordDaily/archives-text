Imagine a future without war, pollution or hunger.
Frances Moore Lappe has imagined such a future. She
also has some practical advice on how it can be achieved.
The internationally-acclaimed author of "Diet for a Small
Planet" and co-founder of the San Francisco-based Institute
for Food and Development Policy (nicknamed Food First),
Lappe will read from her new book, "Rediscovering
America's Values," tonight at 8 p.m. at Kepler's Books, 821
El Camino Real, Menlo Park.
Written as a dialogue between two opposing points of
view (one conservative, the other progressive), "Rediscover
ing America's Values" attempts to answer the question,
"How could hunger exist in a society built upon freedom,
fairness and democracy?" In the process, the book ad
dresses such topics as the political responsibilities of indi
vidual citizens, education, affirmative action, private property
and civil liberties.
"The cause of hunger," says Lappe, "can be very simply
described as the scarcity of democracy instead of the
scarcity of food. By democracy I mean ... structures of
decision making that are participatory, fair and leave no
one totally excluded and powerless."
The arguments voiced in "Rediscovering America's
Values" represent the writings of actual historical figures
— Thomas Hobbes, Jeremy Bentham, Thomas Jefferson
and Adam Smith among them — and Lappe provides
marginalia that detail and bolster each voice's argument.
After her reading, Lappe will hold an informal discussion
with the audience.
Kepler's arranges approximately seven author events each
month. Coordinator Molly Brown says the events are popular
because "they're fun, like a movie — and they're free."
The store will move one block north of its current location
in late August and will contain a reading room capable of
seating 250 people.
