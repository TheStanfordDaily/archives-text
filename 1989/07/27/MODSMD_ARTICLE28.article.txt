## Diane Frank: acknowledging no limits 
### Susan McKean Editorial staff 
"That's a great T-shirt," Diane
Frank sincerely informs a stranger
who crosses our path wearing a
loudly colored T-shirt decorated
with an amobae-like design.
She nods, smiling, setting the
rim of her straw hat wobbling.
It's as it her aesthetic sense just
scored a victory, as it her faith in
people's potential for bold creativ
ity has been affirmed by one un
known person's whimsy.
Frank is determined not to let
even the smallest, most pedestrian
trace of creativity and unor
thodoxy go unnoticed.
"People need to hear it when
they wear great T-shirts," she ex
plains.
Diane Frank is a dance teacher,
a dancer and a choreographer. She
came to Stanford last year, atter
11 years as a professional dancer
in New York City.
She now divides her time be
tween her dancing and her two
year-old daughter, Laura.
Last year she tought several
classes and created dances for stu
dent performance based on the
demanding, minimalist style of
Mercc Cunningham.
Cunningham is considered by
many to be one of this century's
most significant choreographers
and modern dance innovators.
Frank studied and taught with the
Cunningham company in New
York, and also performed with the
•Douglas Dunn dance troupe.
Frank graduated with a bache
lor's degree in theater from Ohio
University. She received her
master's degree in dance from the
University of Illinois.
Frank teaches rigorously, de
manding a great deal of commit
ment and attentiveness from her
students. She takes her art and
other arts very seriously, as she
does students and student work.
Talking with her, it's evident
she hopes to share her passion for
dancing with the rest of the Stan
ford community and to elevate
the appreciation of the arts on
campus.
She speaks as though she is
personally hurt by the idea that
students are passing up opportu
nities to learn about and enjoy
the world of dance and creativity
that she inhabits.
Frank celebrates her world, and
even if it's only with a passing
compliment on a T-shirt, invites
others to join her.
What is your dance back
ground?
1 never intended to dance for
a life. I never thought about it
formally. But it ended up that
that's what I was doing, that's
what I always came back to in
school and that's where my real
interest was, and I found out it
had names like choreography, dan
cer, dancing. I didn't train to dance
for any extended period of time
until college.
Later, when I was teaching at
the University of Maryland, we
had asked Carolyn Brown, a first
among equals in the Mercc Cun
ningham company for 20 years, to
come as a guest artist for a year.

It was hellacious for her (be
cause we were so unequal to her
talent) and illuminating for me. I
was in awe of her and terribly
humiliated that I was teaching
dancing and I didn't really know
anything about it.
I arranged for a leave ot absence
immediately and moved to New
York. It turned out to be a per
manent leave ot absence. 1 danced
with Douglas Dunn's company, got
a scholarship from the Cunning
ham studio, and trained there and
continued to train there for the
11 years 1 lived in New York.
I was wearing three different
hats. 1 was wearing a teacher hat,
the performer hat, and a choreog
rapher hat.
Could you describe the kind
of work you were doing?
Working for Douglas was always
very strange work. The interesting
thing about Douglas is that all (he
projects were structurally set up
so he didn't know, we certainly
didn't know, what the result would
be. It always felt like an enormous
free fall. We really, really didn't
know if we were going to make
something wonderful, or if it would
be just horrible. Which is a nice
way to work.
Simultaneous to training and
teaching at Cunningham, and per
forming with Douglas, 1 had always
felt like I needed to make my own
work.

I started making dances very
regularly, and I started working
with a friend of mine, Deborah
Riley. We started on a duet part
nership, and it ended up as 11
years of work. We made collabora
tive dances together.
At the time, as it was unfolding,
it wasn't obvious to us it was part
of a much larger movement, a
quite graphic movement ot women
dancing together, of women
making dances specifically for
women, and also of women shed
ding the mantle of the lone
creator, and actually doing work
that was collaborative on every
possible level.
During the first work that we
made, we found that the best way
to work in rehearsal was not to
talk to each other at all. Our first
rehearsals were totally in silence.

To do anything, communicate any
thing, we had to physicalizc it, as
kind of a problem for each other
to solve with each other.
It turned out to he that we
were simply one of several groups
of people who were following an
interest that was in the air.
I think that's true with a lot of
work. If you're in an environment
where a lot is happening, you sim
ply absorb it in your pores and
the clarity of that movement or
that interest only reveals itself to
a dance critic 20 years later. It
isn't all that clear when you're in
the middle of it. It feels messy
and it tecls like tun.
How has dance changed in the
recent past, and where do you
see it going?
There is a movement away from
a preoccupation with formalistic
elements of dancing. Which is not
to say that I don't like to see
things that are technically precise.
But 1 think there is great interest
in dancing that doesn't necessarily
have a neat and concise form, or
formal resolution that is preor
dained, like A-B-A or rondo form.
I like works that don't follow
music forms, but take on more
idiosyncratic shapes with a move
ment vocabulary that is more per
sonalized, not less technical —
some things are just technically
difficult to do — but less familiar
because it doesn't fall into the
formal movement patterns that we
understand and know as being part
of the acceptable dancing vocab
ulary.
I've always sort of liked that
weird stuff — you know, you're
not quite sure what it is. 1 hat's
always interested me.
No pun intended, but there's
really a movement afoot in this
direction.
People arc going past the sort
of formalistic exploration that they
were interested in, the structural
investigations. They were always
saying that there's all this other
baggage that's always there that
you bring with you. Now they're
examining the baggage.
There arc a lot of personal re
sources that can and should be a
part of making art. And so issues
like gender issues, social issues,
cultural issues, arc now more
openly part ot the resource mate
rial that is used in making art.
The work that I find most in
teresting now is the work that
does tap into personal material to
inform one's dancing.
For a while, dancing divided it
self up into pretty identifiable
camps. It just doesn't do that any
more. I think theater work is be
coming more physicalizcd, I think
dance work is becoming more ver
bal. There's a blend happening
that's very interesting to me.
Even those people who are con
cerned with pure movement
sources, even they reflect the fact
that they have seen other works
of art that are not quite so easily
identifiable. I like that.
Dance can become so rigidified
that it becomes an institution,
something that consists of a main
stream, and then a marginal side.
It's the marginal side that's most
interesting to me. And I'm glad

that it reflects an enormous di
versity of people and cultures.
You moved to California after
spending 11 years in the midst
of the New York art community.
After a year here, what is your
impression of the status of the
arts at Stanford?
1 think many people here would
like to see the performing arts not
only injected or layered onto the
surface of student life, hut ulti
mately generated hy students.
Students do not necessarily
realize the possibilty for them
selves to do this kind of work.
They may have the ability, hut
they don't necessarily have the
conviction in themselves.
It's very important that we're
not just making good audiences
here, hut fostering a fertile envi
ronment for creative minds to
have an absorbing beginning ex
perience on this campus. We need
to encourage student work even
more.
Student creation needs to be
nurtured so that students are not
always put in the passive mode of
watching someone else's work.
That's where my interest lies.
Stanford doesn't have a formal
dance program on the undergrad
uate level, so everyone who dances
here is also majoring in something
else. .
[A former student of hers passes
by, and they exchange greetings. ]
She's a physicist, by the way.
So, everyone is doing other things.
It belies the old dance prejudice,
which is that if you dance, then
you must not do anything else
well, or you are soft between the
ears or something.
These students are people who
bring their serious intellectual abil
ity to dancing. That's very impor
tant. You need to be sentient, you
need to be aware of what's going
on, and the more that you can
bring to any given situation, the
better.
How does the context of late
20th century America influence
dance?
With dancing, the bottom line
is that we all are bipeds, so in a
sense you are reinventing the
wheel all the time. You have this
thing that is two arms and two
legs and a head, and that's what
you work with when you make a
dance.
On the other hand, we all live
in a culture that has been affected
by technology, for better or for

worse, and we reflect that culture,
and our movement reflects that
culture — and dancing, the
making of dance, is affected by
that.
I think of Merce Cunningham
right off the hat because he is a
person who has really thought
through the implications of what
it means to be living in the 20th
century, and therefore what it
means to be dancing and making
dances in the 20th century.
It's interesting to me that people
still see work through 19th-century
eyes. Here they are in the 20th
century and they cannot accept,
or have difficulty accepting, work
that really comes out of their en
vironments.
I low many people simultane
ously put on their headphones,
type into their computer, and
watch television? That's some
thing we all accept as a given
doing five things at once, seeing
five things at once. So why, when
we go into a concert, do we expect
to be shown one thing at a time.'
We find it difficult to accept a
multiplicity of artistic events hap
pening simultaneously, and to ac
cept that we can't get everything.
I think it's primarily a question
of discomfort. I think it's a learned
response.
People who don't know what
they're supposed to get out of
something most often enjoy it
more than those who have a
scorecard with them expecting it
to fit some preconception.
Speaking of space and equality
of possibility, elsewhere you have
emphasized the democratic char
acter of Cunningham's work.
Could you elaborate on that?
Merce Cunningham democra
tized the use of space for dancing.
Ile neutralized the expected se
quence of dancing, he fractured
the sequence and the spatial ar
rangements.
For instance, if you look at a
traditional ballet, you have the
corps behind, then demi-soloists,
then the soloists in the middle.
They arc all organized in con
centric circles around the center.
If you go sit in a European opera
house you know the reason for
this arrangement. The best seats
are front and center. Those people
sec everything: those are the
people who can pay for it.
As you move out to the edges,
you sec less and less. Rut if you're
sitting on the extreme right, you
