## Donald Kennedy's first fascination — science 
### Tanya Paull Editorial staff 
For some people, the name
Donald Kennedy suggests many
things — integrity, tact, humor,
intelligence. The man is practically
an institution.
Ironically, though, few remem
ber the scientific accomplishments
that brought the president of Stan
ford University to this point in
his career.
Many have forgotten his dedi
cation and passion tor teaching
during his 12 years as professor of
biological sciences — seven as
chair of the department — which
earned him the Dinkelspiel Award
for excellence in teaching in 1976.
Most students probably don't
realize that Kennedy received
three degrees in biological sciences
from Harvard, and that his enthu
siasm for the neurophysiology of
crayfish, alligators and various in
vertebrates at one time could
barely be contained.
Only his colleagues in biology
would probably remember Ken
nedy as a major contender in sci
entific research — publishing over

60 articles in neurophysiology,
achieving a post on the editorial
board of the journal Science, and
becoming a member of some of
the country's most influential sci
entific organizations.
"Yes, they forget quickly," Ken
nedy says — now consumed with
the politics, finances, and future
of Stanford University.
Any regrets about moving out
of the scientific arena? "No," he
says, "whenever you go through
one door you close some others.
I don't spend much time brooding
over the ones I've closed."
In the '60s, Kennedy would
more likely have been found with
a crayfish than with a head of
state. Now he concentrates his
scientific interests on lecturing to
Stanford students and those out
side the University about the in
stitutional side of science.
A few class periods in the
human biology core — a program
Kennedy helped start in 1974 —
arc reserved for lectures by the
University president every year.
Rut he is quick to explain that
this commitment — speaking
about health policy and institu

tional science — is actually guest
lecturing, not teaching.
"Teaching," he says, "is when
you plan a course; you invite some
other people in to lecture; you
create an intellectually coherent
and stimulating whole; you
develop readings; you develop
challenging examinations; you
write and you grade them; you
read people's papers and you write
in the margins — that's teaching."
"1 don't confuse [what 1 do in
hum bio] with real teaching," Ken
nedy says.
Neither does he contuse or un
derrate his responsibilities to the
reputation of science — at Stan
ford and across the country.
"I'm really concerned about
public attitudes toward science,"
Kennedy says, and sometimes tries
to "rattle a few cages" in the sci
entific community about what sci
entists can do to change those
attitudes.
"Scientific fraud and the animal
rights movement have both been
examples of the public mistrust of
science that scientists should be
worried about," he says. Three
years ago animal right* activists
protested the new building at the
Medical School intended to house
rodents for medical research. The
delay cost the University valuable
time and $1.3 million.
1 lis administrative role covers
two domains, Kennedy says — one
to alert policy and decision makers
of their responsibilities, and the
other to speak to the public and
government officials about the in
tegrity and purposes of the scien
tific community.
"I want us to get an 'A' in
animal welfare!" Kennedy says em
phatically. If scientists do their
part and comply with standards,
then the University can argue a
strong case against animal rights
demonstrators, he says.
His determination extends
equally to issues of scientific fraud,
conflicts of interest, and safety
regulations.
The toughest decisions he is
faced with, Kennedy explains, of
ten come down to a delicate bal
ance. On one side is the creativity
and independence of the scien
tists, and on the other is the need
for regulations and a "clean slate"
— whether it is in treatment of

laboratory animals, academic au
thorship, or any issue of science
ethics.
Kennedy's goal is to maximize
both.
But he agrees with David Korn
— dean of the Stanford University
Mcdical School — who told Sci
ence that Stanford's policy relies
on the integrity of individuals.
"Faculty in universities are a very
unregulatable bunch of people by
tradition, so that whenever some
body tries to impose a set of new
requirements faculty are extremely
suspicious and unwilling to go
along," Korn said.
Does all of this attention on
the sciences — not to mention
the Bcckman Center, the new bi
ology wing, and the Near West
Campus — leave the humanities
out in the cold? Kennedy doesn't
think so.
He claims that the Centennial
campaign will bring in as much
money for the humanities as it
will for the sciences.

"I lumanities' needs are not so
much bricks and mortar — they're
people needs," Kennedy says, ex
plaining that new chairs and
professorships will be opened in
humanities and social science de
partments.
While Kennedy concentrates on
overseeing the School of Arts and
Sciences as well as the engineering
and medical schools, he admits
being a little "wistful" about his
years of laboratory research.
Despite his interests in science
and the recent surge in attention
on the biology of the nervous sys
tem, though, Kennedy doesn't
think he will ever return to the
laboratory. "Anyone who comes
back to neurophysiology after 12
years absent and takes a look
around at the things he would
have to learn and do would be a
little staggered," he says.
"But that's not to say I wouldn't
go back to an active role in teach
ing science."
