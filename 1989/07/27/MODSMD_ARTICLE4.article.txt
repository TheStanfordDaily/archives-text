No man of the least degree of sensibility
can journey through any number of years in
whatever climate without often being com
pelled to make many useful observations on
the different phenomena of Nature which sur
round him and without involuntarily being
struck either with awe or admiration in be
holding some of the elementary conflicts in
the midst of which he lives. A great thunder
storm, an extensive Hood, a desolating hur

ricane, a sudden and intense frost, an over
whelming snow-storm, a sultry day — each ot
these different scenes exhibits singular beauties
even in spite of the damage they cause. Often
whilst the heart laments the loss to the citizen,
the enlightened mind, seeking for the natural
causes, and astonished at the effects, awakes
itself to surprise and wonder.
— J. Hector St. John de Crevecoeur,
"Sketches of Eighteenth-century America"
