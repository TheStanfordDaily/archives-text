## Homeowners trying to solve toxics problem 
### Karen Kramer Staff writer 
Bureaucracy has been the source of con
tinual frustration for the Barron Park As
sociation, a group representing a
neighborhood's concerns for safe cleanup
of toxic leakages from industries in Stanford
Research Park, which is on University
owned land.
The toxics problems started in 1982 and
affect Palo Alto residences near the research
park, hut not Stanford itself. The research
park is the land on the south side of Page
Mill Road between El Camino and Foothill
Expressway. The Barron Park residences arc
south of the research park.
The most recent setback for Barron Park
was Gov. George Deukmejian's veto earlier
this month of a $258,000 bill to continue
a cleanup begun by four overseers from the
Regional Water Quality Control Board.
"For whatever reasons, the Regional
Water Quality Control Board appears much
more effective than the (California Depart
ment of Health Services). The project will
probably go a lot slower when it's turned
hack in the hands of DHS," said toxicologist
and Barron Park member Inge I larding Bar
low.

John Joynt, the president
of the Barron Park Associ
ation, said the DHS
"doesn't know how to
manage or complete a proj
ect. They've been wholly
incapable of doing that. So
far they have spent
$800,000 making plans for
half a region. These were

plans for plans. We've seen no results."
The four individuals from the Regional
Water Quality Control Board "were making
great strides," according to Joynt. The fund
ing for them was known as "Sher money"
because State Assemblyman Byron Sher pro
posed the $420,000 bill that was passed to
start the program in 1988. Compared to
the Regional Board, the DHS is "slower
than molasses," according to Joynt.
"The root of slowness in the DHS is
that we have to vie for help on a state-wide
level. We're told that there are bigger prob
lems in the state area. Or they're saying
that they're out of money," Joynt explained.
In Deukmejian's brief veto message of
the funding for the Regional Board over
seers, he said that the program was not a
sufficiently statewide priority to justify state
funds.

Research to see where the contamination
comes from in the Oregon Expressway
Region, the area that the "Sher money"
would have addressed, will now be stalled,
Joynt says.
Taking it into their own hands
Members of the association have formed
a group called the Barron Park Foundation,
a non-profit organization, in order to get
grants from the Environmental Protection
Agency to help with the toxic cleanup.
The Barron Park Foundation received
$43,000 July 12 after cutting through the
red tape and proving the group was capable
of managing money and tracking a consul
tant's progress â€” the two main require
ments in the tedious EPA application
process.
"We're rccognized as the first true neigh
borhood organization who successfully
muddled through the cumbersome applica
tion," Joynt said.
Currently, the Barron Park Foundation
is also applying for a $45,000 grant for a
new area on Page Mill. Joynt says the or
ganization will find out whether it will
receive the money in two months.
The difference between the Barron Park
Foundation and the Barron Park Associa

tion is that the former is a non-profit or
ganization formed a year ago specifically to
apply for the EPA tcchinical assistant grant.
Barron Park Association has been in exis
tence for 62 years and consists of over 350
paid members in the neighborhood who
represent the interests of groups such as
the elderly and the boy scouts.
"As a community we began empowering
ourselves around three years ago," Joynt
said. The concerned community asked the
city of Palo Alto to hold meetings and also
put on a three-day toxic symposium to
educate and raise awareness about the prob
lem.
With the EPA money, Joynt said the
Barron Park Foundation "can now have a
consultant irrespective of what the [statel
government has done. That becomes indi
rect motivation for the companies to con
tinue their cleanup actions in spite of the
governor's veto of funds that would have
employees of the Regional Board oversee
the work."
Overall, the industries responsible for the
toxic problems at Stanford Research Park
have satisfactorily indicated their good faith
to the community in addressing the prob-
