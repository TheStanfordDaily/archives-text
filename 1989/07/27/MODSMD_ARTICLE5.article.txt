## Homeowners trying to solve toxics problem 
### Karen Kramer Staff writer 
Bureaucracy has been the source of con
tinual frustration for the Barron Park As
sociation, a group representing a
neighborhood's concerns for safe cleanup
of toxic leakages from industries in Stanford
Research Park, which is on University
owned land.
The toxics problems started in 1982 and
affect Palo Alto residences near the research
park, hut not Stanford itself. The research
park is the land on the south side of Page
Mill Road between El Camino and Foothill
Expressway. The Barron Park residences arc
south of the research park.
The most recent setback for Barron Park
was Gov. George Deukmejian's veto earlier
this month of a $258,000 bill to continue
a cleanup begun by four overseers from the
Regional Water Quality Control Board.
"For whatever reasons, the Regional
Water Quality Control Board appears much
more effective than the (California Depart
ment of Health Services). The project will
probably go a lot slower when it's turned
hack in the hands of DHS," said toxicologist
and Barron Park member Inge I larding Bar
low.

John Joynt, the president
of the Barron Park Associ
ation, said the DHS
"doesn't know how to
manage or complete a proj
ect. They've been wholly
incapable of doing that. So
far they have spent
$800,000 making plans for
half a region. These were

plans for plans. We've seen no results."
The four individuals from the Regional
Water Quality Control Board "were making
great strides," according to Joynt. The fund
ing for them was known as "Sher money"
because State Assemblyman Byron Sher pro
posed the $420,000 bill that was passed to
start the program in 1988. Compared to
the Regional Board, the DHS is "slower
than molasses," according to Joynt.
"The root of slowness in the DHS is
that we have to vie for help on a state-wide
level. We're told that there are bigger prob
lems in the state area. Or they're saying
that they're out of money," Joynt explained.
In Deukmejian's brief veto message of
the funding for the Regional Board over
seers, he said that the program was not a
sufficiently statewide priority to justify state
funds.

Research to see where the contamination
comes from in the Oregon Expressway
Region, the area that the "Sher money"
would have addressed, will now be stalled,
Joynt says.
Taking it into their own hands
Members of the association have formed
a group called the Barron Park Foundation,
a non-profit organization, in order to get
grants from the Environmental Protection
Agency to help with the toxic cleanup.
The Barron Park Foundation received
$43,000 July 12 after cutting through the
red tape and proving the group was capable
of managing money and tracking a consul
tant's progress — the two main require
ments in the tedious EPA application
process.
"We're rccognized as the first true neigh
borhood organization who successfully
muddled through the cumbersome applica
tion," Joynt said.
Currently, the Barron Park Foundation
is also applying for a $45,000 grant for a
new area on Page Mill. Joynt says the or
ganization will find out whether it will
receive the money in two months.
The difference between the Barron Park
Foundation and the Barron Park Associa

tion is that the former is a non-profit or
ganization formed a year ago specifically to
apply for the EPA tcchinical assistant grant.
Barron Park Association has been in exis
tence for 62 years and consists of over 350
paid members in the neighborhood who
represent the interests of groups such as
the elderly and the boy scouts.
"As a community we began empowering
ourselves around three years ago," Joynt
said. The concerned community asked the
city of Palo Alto to hold meetings and also
put on a three-day toxic symposium to
educate and raise awareness about the prob
lem.
With the EPA money, Joynt said the
Barron Park Foundation "can now have a
consultant irrespective of what the [statel
government has done. That becomes indi
rect motivation for the companies to con
tinue their cleanup actions in spite of the
governor's veto of funds that would have
employees of the Regional Board oversee
the work."
Overall, the industries responsible for the
toxic problems at Stanford Research Park
have satisfactorily indicated their good faith
to the community in addressing the prob-


Juynl
lcms, Joynt said.
The businesses occupying land
leased from the University at Stan
ford Research Park are called re
sponsible parties — Joynt prefers
to call them potentially responsible
parties.
"Where the ball is right now is
with the responsible parties," Joynt
said. "We clearly understand what
industries are doing and we accept
that. There are clear signals to
the community about what they're
doing."
Should Stanford pay?
One of the great controversies,
though, is over the role of the
University, which owns the land

and leases it to the companies.
No one has made clear the exact
responsibilities of the University
in helping with the toxic cleanup.
"This has been an ongoing frus
tration: We don't get a clear an
swer from the University about
what their role is," Joynt says.
As he sees it, "If all the com
panies were to vacate I the Re
search Park], Stanford is left
holding the bag. They're the
landlord. And the landlord is re
sponsible for cleanup."
The DHS named the University
a responsible party for a particular
area along with 10 other compan
ies in a remedial action order in
December 1988. All of the other
companies have met and already
reached the third stage ot resolving
the problem: forming plans and
taking action.

"The other companies have
stepped up to the plate. Stanford
has yet to show the community
that they have good faith to fully
participate in the cleanup. They're
sitting in the back room blending
with the wallflowers, which is as
frustrating to me and the commu
nity as it probably is to the com
panies," Joynt said.
The project coordinator for the
companies, David Ham, said "Our
assumption was that Stanford
would join us at the table to come
up with a plan on how to address
the problem.
"They [Stanford represen
tatives] are present at the public
meetings and round table
workshops, but not at our meetings
when we're putting together strat
egies."
Disparity of view
Although Barron Park's mem
bers and the companies occupying
Stanford Research Park see the
llni vcrsity as holding equal re
sponsibility as a landlord, Paula
Kakimoto of Stanford's Real Estate
and Land Management Depart
ment sees the University as having
only secondary responsibility.
"Tenants are responsible for the
ground and cleanup," she said.
" I he land is all leased in long-term
ground leases. The University
watches what the tenants do in
terms of cleanup — we're not re
sponsible. But we obviously have
in interest that they're done."
While the University is listed
js a responsible party on the

remedial action order issued h
the DHS, Kakimoto feels tha
"Stanford is on the order sold'
on the basis of land ownership
not because we are chemical dis
chargers. 7 he other companies an
there because they are discharger:
or potential chemical dischargers
We are definitely on a different
level and on the order for a dif
ferent reason."
1 he University could obviously
give financial help in the cleanup
But Stanford could also contribute
its engineering talents, or environ
mental talents, I lam said. "We'rt
having discussions with Stanforc
University right now and we hop<
to come to some resolution soon.
When asked what steps tin
Universtiy intends to take
Kakimoto said, "I can't tell yoi
exactly what we're doing. I'm noi
trying to be evasive. We really
haven't worked out a nlan vet."
