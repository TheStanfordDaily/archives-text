# Stanford may be named site for a new Shriners hospital
## 
### Brian Winterfeldt 
Officials for the Shrine of North
America have announced plans to
construct a $65 million medical
facility in the Northern California
area. The Shriners are looking fur
a site where they can be affiliated
with a major academic medical
center. In Northern California,
that limits the choices to UC-
Davis, UC-San Francisco and
Stanford.
The Shrine is a charitable and
fraternal organization that oper
ates hospitals specializing in burn
treatment and orthopedic medi
cine.
David Korn, vice president and
dean ot Stanford Medical Center,
said he has outlined what the Uni
versity feels the center should con
tain to warrant the effort ot build
ing at Stanford in a number of
preliminary meetings with the
Shriners.
According to Korn, the Medical
Center feels the hospital should

provide state of the art treatment
and research in its areas of med
icine. Also, the center would like
to use this as an opportunity for
the School of Medicine and the
School of Engineering to work to
gether on such activities as med
ical imagery and artificial limbs.
The facility would need to be a
strong and unique academic op
portunity for both the community
and the University.
"The demand for our services
to children in the Western United
States is rapidly outgrowing our
abilit> to meet those needs in our
current facilities," said Gene
Bracewell, chairman ot the board
of Shriners 1 lospitals, in a state
ment.
"At the present time we trans
port severely burned children from
the Western United States and
Western Canada to one ot our
three existing burn facilities, most
often to our Galveston, Texas
Shriners Burn.s Institute," he said.
Because ot the distance factor,

the obstacles of increased cost and
time currently lie in the path o!
effective treatment for burn vic
tims in the West.
In addition to burn treatment
the hospital will also house facil
ities for spinal cord and orthopedi<
medicine. Shriners Hospitals Ex
ecutive Vice President Lewis Mol
nar explained in the statement
"It will be the first hospital of it!
kind in the Shriners' system tc
encompass all three disciplines ol
treatment."
All care given at the hospital
will be free of charge to patients
under the age ot 18, as in all
â€¢Shriners Hospitals.
Korn said the new Children's
Hospital complex now under con
struction would in no way hinder
the choice of Stanford as a loca
tion. Furthermore, Stanford Med
ical Center does not now contain
a bum center.
The Shriners will make a fina
decision on the hospital's locatior
in late fall or early winter.
