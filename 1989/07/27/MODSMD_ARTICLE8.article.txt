# Applied physics professor wins superconductivity prize
## 
### 
In addition to hosting the sec
ond annual international confer
ence on high-temperature super
conductivity this week, the Uni
versity was also honored with a
prize.
Theodore Gehalle, an applied
physics professor, was the winner
ot the- first-ever Rernd Matthias
Memorial Award, given tor his
contributions to the science of su
perconductivity.
Gehalle received the award "in
recognition ot a distinguished
career in technical leadership and
contributions to the field ot su
perconductivity."
The award is named tin a
physicist who was a pioneer in the
field and was a longtime co-worker
of Gehalle. The two collaborated
on experiments that broke new
ground in high-temperature super
conductivity and were jointly
awarded the Oliver J. Buckley
Prize from the American Physical
Society in 1^70.

Before coming
to Stanford
Gehalle worked at
AT&T's Bell Lab
oratories tor a
long period of
time. While at the
University he has
led research on
various supercon
ducting materials.

The $5,000 aw.ml, which is
sponsored by AT & I, was pre
sented at the second annual con
ference on high-temperature su
perconductivity. The conference,
which runs through tomorrow, has
been attended bv more than 1000
scientists from around the world.
Superconductivity is a phenom
enon in which materials lose all
electrical resistance when cooled
to a certain temperature. Recently,
materials have been found which
display superconductivity at nearly
room temperature.

Round 'em up
Bikes left abandoned are rounded up and herded off to auction by the Dept. of Public
Safety. "It's kind of like a dog pound," bike officer Mario Sandler explained. "We keep them
for 90 days and if we don't find their owner, we put them to sleep."
