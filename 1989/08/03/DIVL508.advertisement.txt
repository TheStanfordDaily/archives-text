THE BROKEN CORD
MICHAEL DORRIS
Author of A Yellow Raft in Blue Water
In 1971, Michael Dorris became one of the first unmarried men in
America to adopt a young child. Not until years later did he learn that
his adopted Sioux Indian son was suffering from a wide-spread,
preventable but incurable disease—Fetal Alcohol Syndrome.
Each year in the United States more than 50,000 children are born with
some form of birth defect directly related to alcohol consumption during
pregnancy. The problem is particularly acute among Native American
Indians, on some reservations affecting one birth out of three.
THE BROKEN CORD is a highly personal, clear-eyed and deeply
touching account of Dorris' abiding pain and love for his son. It is a
work, which, in the words of novelist Alice Hoffman, "will not only
break your heart, it will restore your faith."
