New building found
to be generally safe
The Center for Integrated Sys
tems building passed its tests in a
recent examination and is "gener
ally safe, presenting modest risks
to staff, researchers, visitors and
campus neighbors," according to
an outside firm's evaluation.
The study was recommended in
a report made by SRI International
for Stanford's Internal Audit De
partment.
The report stated that any risk
attributable to the building would
be no greater than "risks that most
people encounter routinely in their
daily lives," and a University of
ficial said Stanford plans to take
steps to minimize these risks fur
ther.
The building is a joint effort of
the University and 20 electronic
corporations and contains an in

tegrated chip fabrication facility
for use by Stanford rescarchcrs and
students. Due to the type of work
done at CIS, researchers must
make use of a number of toxic
chemicals and compressed gases.
The facility was designed for that
use and contains modern safety
and ventilation equipment.
According to the study, "With
a few exceptions, (the building)
appears to be generally well
planned." The only hazards, for
the most part, are confined to
people who happen to be at the
immediate scene of a hazardous
chemical release.
The .study said as long as the
ventilation system is operating,
concentrations of toxic gas will
remain below maximun safe expo
sure limits throughout the rest of
the facility and outside. "The one
exception is inside the toxic vault
(the chemical storage room),
where concentrations could dram
atically exceed limits for a short

time," the report said.
Three important recommenda
tions were to improve security
measures against sabotage and
theft, constructing an above-grade
toxic storage facility, and reducing
the length of time toxic gas
cylinders are stored outside the
toxic gas vault.
S. Africa schools
to receive texts
Phil Lawes knows there's hunger
in South Africa but he also knows
there's another kind of hunger —
the kind that pinches the mind,
not the belly. Books are the next
needed course for South Africa.

To feed the hungering minds,
Lawes has taken action into his
own hands and organized the
African Schools Project. Already
$4,OCX) strong and endorsed by the
African National Congress, as well
as by the private, non-govern
mental Institute of International
Education, the project will send
texts, equipment and other mate
rials to support independent
schools in South Africa.
The recipients of Lawes' funds
will primarily be the schools which
have the most need — and which
have little or no organized funding.
The pages of this work are far
from closed. Student volunteers
are even now applying to textbook
inventories, local elementary and

secondary schools as well as indi
viduals. They will also seek lower
fares from airlines and shipping
firms.
"In general we will focus on
books in technical subjects, such
as math and chemistry; reference
materials, such as dictionaries; and
English as a second language texts
designed for all academic levels,"
Lawes said. He also added that
"The South African government
doesn't mind private groups trying
to pick up some of the slack in
educational opportunities for
blacks."
And there is a lot of slack to
be picked up. South Africa has a
notorious record for catering to
whites over blacks with its per
capita education expenditures. In
1985, such expenditures for South
African whites was more than six
times that for blacks.
What Lawes feels to be the real
objective of his work is the fact
that whites will fill less than 40
percent of all administrative and
executive posts by the turn of the
century, in contrast to 95 percent
in 1968.

Other South African organiza
tions cooperating with the Stan
ford group include the South
African Committee for Higher Ed
ucation, the South African Coun
cil of Churches and Saint Barnabas
College.
Lawes can he contacted at the
Bcchtel International Center.

$4,OCX) strong and endorsed by the
African National Congress, as well
as by the private, non-govern
mental Institute of International
Education, the project will send
texts, equipment and other mate
rials to support independent
schools in South Africa.
The recipients of Lawes' funds
will primarily be the schools which
have the most need — and which
have little or no organized funding.
The pages of this work are far
from closed. Student volunteers
are even now applying to textbook
inventories, local elementary and

secondary schools as well as indi
viduals. They will also seek lower
fares from airlines and shipping
firms.
"In general we will focus on
books in technical subjects, such
as math and chemistry; reference
materials, such as dictionaries; and
English as a second language texts
designed for all academic levels,"
Lawes said. He also added that
"The South African government
doesn't mind private groups trying
to pick up some of the slack in
educational opportunities for
blacks."
And there is a lot of slack to
be picked up. South Africa has a
notorious record for catering to
whites over blacks with its per
capita education expenditures. In
1985, such expenditures for South
African whites was more than six
times that for blacks.
What Lawes feels to be the real
objective of his work is the fact
that whites will fill less than 40
percent of all administrative and
executive posts by the turn of the
century, in contrast to 95 percent
in 1968.

Other South African organiza
tions cooperating with the Stan
ford group include the South
African Committee for Higher Ed
ucation, the South African Coun
cil of Churches and Saint Barnabas
College.

Bacchetti named to
accreditation post
Raymond Bacchetti, vice
provost and director of the Office
of Planning and Management, now
has one more job.
Bacchetti has been named chair
of the accreditation commission
of the Western Association of
Schools and Colleges.

Th 6 commission is one of six
that arc nationally recognized by
the U.S. Department of Education.
It serves 140 schools and more
than 500,000 students.
Advising Center
gets new director
Hector Cuevas has been ap
pointed director of the Undergrad
uate Advising Center.
Cuevas has been the coordina
tor of undergraduate counseling at
the Career Planning and Place
ment Center since 1978. While
there he served as the chair of
the CPPC committee on minority
affairs and as a freshman advisor.
Cuevas succeeds Audrey
Bernfield, who has been director
since 1985.
New building found
to be generally safe
The Center for Integrated Sys
tems building passed its tests in a
recent examination and is "gener
ally safe, presenting modest risks
to staff, researchers, visitors and
campus neighbors," according to
an outside firm's evaluation.
The study was recommended in
a report made by SRI International
for Stanford's Internal Audit De
partment.
The report stated that any risk
attributable to the building would
be no greater than "risks that most
people encounter routinely in their
daily lives," and a University of
ficial said Stanford plans to take
steps to minimize these risks fur
ther.
The building is a joint effort of
the University and 20 electronic
corporations and contains an in

tegrated chip fabrication facility
for use by Stanford rescarchcrs and
students. Due to the type of work
done at CIS, researchers must
make use of a number of toxic
chemicals and compressed gases.
The facility was designed for that
use and contains modern safety
and ventilation equipment.
According to the study, "With
a few exceptions, (the building)
appears to be generally well
planned." The only hazards, for
the most part, are confined to
people who happen to be at the
immediate scene of a hazardous
chemical release.
The .study said as long as the
ventilation system is operating,
concentrations of toxic gas will
remain below maximun safe expo
sure limits throughout the rest of
the facility and outside. "The one
exception is inside the toxic vault
(the chemical storage room),
where concentrations could dram
atically exceed limits for a short

time," the report said.
Three important recommenda
tions were to improve security
measures against sabotage and
theft, constructing an above-grade
toxic storage facility, and reducing
the length of time toxic gas
cylinders are stored outside the
toxic gas vault.
S. Africa schools
to receive texts
Phil Lawes knows there's hunger
in South Africa but he also knows
there's another kind of hunger —
the kind that pinches the mind,
not the belly. Books are the next
needed course for South Africa.

To feed the hungering minds,
Lawes has taken action into his
own hands and organized the
African Schools Project. Already
$4,OCX) strong and endorsed by the
African National Congress, as well
as by the private, non-govern
mental Institute of International
Education, the project will send
