## Women 
### 
Consider your friends and acquaintances. Both men
and women probably come to mind.
Now consider your professors. Again, you probably
think of both men and women — but probably mostly
of men.
There's a simple reason for that — a very simple
reason.
The Stanford faculty and administration consists
predominantly of men.
Women constitute only 11 percent of the University's
faculty (142 out o 1,324) and only 8 percent of tenured
faculty (66 of 86/). They hold two of 28 chairs in the
School of Humanities and Sciences, one of the 22
chairs in the School of Medicine, none of the 10 chairs
in the School of Engineering and none of the four
chairs in the School of Earth Sciences.
These statistics have serious implications.
Students have come to see women as marginal to
the intellectual life of the University.
They have done so, however, at precisely the time
when women constitute 46 percent of the student
population, in a time when women have become a
fundamental part of the student community.
A professors sex radically alters the experience of
his or her students. A man and a woman might teach
the same material in the same manner, but the student
will learn something different in the course taught
by a woman.
The student will learn that a woman is competent
and qualified in a particular field.
A woman's intellectual capacity and ambition is not
reinforced when her teachers each quarter are all men,
when her department is headed by a man, and when
there are scarce historical examples of women in her
field.
Students need mentors. And often mentors of one's
own sex speak most directly to the heart and soul of
one's intellectual life.
Only exceptional women students can be confident
of themselves as scholars without role models of their
same sex, and even those women must work "double
duty" to be considered respectable in a male
dominated establishment.
Although Stanford has some of the best female
scholars in the world, their ranks are small. Here, as
in the nation generally, the female intellectual role
models for women are rare.
The University should make a concerted effort to
end the disparities in power between male and female
professors and administrators.
In response to the April report of the University
Committee on Minority Issues, Provost James Rosse
recently appointed a new committee that will address
this inequity, and generally work to diversify the
faculty population.
This Special Committee on Faculty Recruitment and
Retention boasts the potential to really improve Stan
ford education. But in order to promote real change,
it needs to be sufficiently funded and carefully,
vigilantly run, with sustained community interaction.
Women are no longer exceptions within the student
population. They shouldn't be within the faculty.
