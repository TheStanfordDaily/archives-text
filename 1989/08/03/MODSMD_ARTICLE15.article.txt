For liberty to
exist, economic
freedom is needed
In the July 13 commentary
"A solution for China: Creat
ing democracy without
capitalism," Alec Rawls
presents a twisted and incor
rect argument against liberty
and democracy, and then he
uses it to present his own
narrow-minded and pater
nalistic solution for trie Chi
nese people.
While enjoying the right to
freedom of speech guaran
teed by the Bill of Rights
and, if he is a U.S. citizen,
the right to vote as he
pleases, Rawls implies that
democracy and freedom are
fearful excesses.
He wrongly claims that the
U.S. economic system is one
of unregulated capitalism —
taxes, quotas, subsidies and
the minimum wage being
examples of a myriad of reg
ulations imposed on us
through this system. He then
blames our system, and sel
fish Americans, for the
world's ecological woes.
Somehow, he then uses
these assertions as a basis f<?r
his own program for China:
one which the existing
leaders could use to place
strict limitations on individ
ual rights (such as property
ownership).
This would enable the Chi
nese government to "do
more to control China's di
rection than [the] dictatorship
now could." He writes, "If
the Communists choose wise
ly, they could ... allow polit
ical liberalization."
At best this is paternalism,
and more realistically it is
still nothing more than a
stifling totalitarian regime
once again calling itself "The
People s."
Economic freedom is a fun

damcntal necessity to the
existence of liberty and social
justice. Only in a political
system which guarantees and
respects basic human rights
can people truly flourish as
individuals and, therefore, as
a society.
Liberty includes the right
to determine one's own
course in life, to make one's
own decisions and set one's
own goals and priorities with
respect to family, community,
and investments of time and
money. It includes the rights
to freedom of thought and
expression, rights which the
Chinese communist leaders
refuse to grant.
If the Chinese do not take
his advice, Rawls should take
heart in that totalitarian gov
ernments do not have a stel
lar track record in the ecol
ogy department. The USSR's
behavior in the Chernobyl
accident is a prime example.
In fact, no system is better
able to protect the environ
ment than a democracy and
a free society in which con
cerned citizens can voice
their opinions to political
leaders. This includes being
able to vote to elect those
leaders that support their
views.
In this system the political
leaders are accountable to the
public and are restrained by
a system of checks and
balances. This is so that a
handful of them cannot
decide that capriciously they
are no longer interested in
the environment and that all
ecology policy laws will hen
ceforth be ignored nor can
they suddenly claim that
these laws never existed.
Furthermore, the people
concerned can select products
and services to support the
businesses that promote a
healthy environment and
thereby encourage the high
est standards.

Retnemberittg days
with the (Sigourney)
Weaver family
I was interested in your
article on Sigourney Weaver
because I ani acquainted
with some members of the
Weaver family.
When my twin brother
Bob and I were growing up
in Los Angeles in the early
'20s, we attended Los An
geles High School, graduat
ing in 1926 and entering
Stanford as freshmen that
fall.
During that period,
Sylvester Weaver, an execu
tive of the Johns Mansville
Co., brought his wife and
four children to Los Angeles
and lived near us—Sylva
"Tib"; Sylvester Jr. "Pat";
Rosemary "Pode"; Winstead
"Doodles" (well-known to
many Stanford alumni due to
his various theatrics and an
tics on campus during his
college years).
Pat, my classmate, entered
Dartmouth in 1926. Pat en
tered the radio and TV in
dustry in its infancy and
became the first president of
NBC. He marriea a British
actress and has two children,
a boy and a girl named
Susan (also known as Sigour
ney).
Getting back to Sigourney,
I understand the motion pic
ture companies thought
Susan Weaver was not a
name to pull in movie goers
so she made up her first
name, "Sigourney". It is pos
sible that she made up tne
name Sigourney or learned
of the name from a character
her mother played.
She looks like her father
and has his coloring, but I
imagine she has learned a lot
about acting from her moth
er.
