## Discrimination in the workplace is a painful reality 
### 
Discrimination in the
workplace is a reality.
That fact is one that many
Stanford students will soon
have to face. The 43 percent
of Stanford students who are
women will discover a work
ing world in which women
are paid less than men in
the same positions. The 33
percent who are members of
minority groups will find
that whites are more readily
hired than minorities with
the same qualifications.
The fight against this type
of discrimination has been a
long struggle and one that
has seen a number of suc
cesses. However, recently, the
fight suffered a setback.
In its June 5 Wards Cove
v. Antonio decision, the Su
preme Court shifted the bur
den of proof in employment
discrimination lawsuits. In so
doing, the Court struck a
blow against those battling
discrimination.

Until Wards Cove, an em
ployee who, in a civil suit,
could show a significant un
derrepresentation of women
or minorities in a given job
(as compared with the quali
fied pool of applicants for
that job) could force the em
ployer to give an explana
tion.
The burden of proof then
shifted to the employer, who
had to show that there was
some factor causing this
result which was necessary
for the conduct of business.
If the employer could not
offer a defense, the plaintiff
would be entitled to win the
case.
The system was a fair and
reasonable one; it forced em
ployers with hiring practices
shown to be questionable to
explain their actions. It is the
employer who knows how
hiring decisions are made; if
the reasons for those deci
sions are justifiable, the em

ployer has to explain them.
But the Wards Cove deci
sion changed that and, in the
process, made it much easier
tor discriminators to escape
responsibility for their
wrongdoings. Now the plain
tiff must identify the precise
method used to practice the
discrimination, even though
the employer may be the
only one who possesses such
knowledge.
Proving discrimination in a
specific instance is extremely
difficult. Even employer
record files are insufficient to
cover all the subjective fac
tors that enter into hiring an
individual for a job. The
plaintiff might only see the
brief notes written down
during an interview, but
might have no way of
knowing which factors were
decisive.
Even if a plaintiff can
prove specific instances of
discrimination, that person

now faces another new obsta
cle. Wards Cove lowered the
standard that a defendant
could use to justify hiring
practices with discriminatory
effects.
In the past, as most courts
interpreted the law, employ
ers had to show that such
practices were business
'necessities." Height and
weight requirements, for ex
ample, could lead to a low
percentage of women being
hired but could be essential
to certain occupations.
The Court lowered this
standard so that practices
with discriminatory effects
need only "serve, in a signif
icant way, the legitimate em
ployment goals of the em
ployer." Gone was the re
quirement that the practice
be a "business necessity."
But why would we want
to allow an employment
practice that manifestly dis
criminates, if it is not some-

how essential to the busi
ness? In the 1971 Griggs v.
Duke Power case, the Duke
Power Company unsuccess
fully argued that a standard
ized test was related to job
performance with the compa
ny.
The minority applicants at
the Duke Power Company
did not perform as well on
these tests as did white ap
plicants. The test thus had
the practical effect of dis
criminating against minori
ties. Under the Wards Cove
standard, though, the test
presumably would be accept
able as serving some
legitimate employment goal.
This new standard is too
lenient. If a practice has a
discriminatory effect, and it is
not essential to a business, it
should not be allowed.
