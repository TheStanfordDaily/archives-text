## Golden spikes Stanford volleyball stars lead the way as Olympic Festival gets Cardinal tint 
### Mark Rogowsky Editorial staff 
The U.S Olympic festival was
certainly a showcase for some of
the top amateur athletic talent in
the county. And, as one might
expect, a fair amount of that talent
is affiliated with Stanford Univer
sity.
On disparate fields of play from
weightlifting to basketball, from
gymnastics to volleyball, Stanford
stars of the past, present and future
made their mark in the Oklahoma
City games.
Kristin Klein, a first-team All-
American and the Pacific 10 Con
ference Freshman of the Year, led
the South to a gold medal in wom
en's volleyball. Klein banged home
22 kills as the South won Games
1, 3 and 5 en route to the victory.
Bev Oden, the youngest sister
of Stanford legend Kim Oden and
a freshman-to-be at Stanford, led
the South with 29 kills.
On the men's side, sophomore
Ryan Moos' South squad defeated
the West, 3-1.
As he did at Stanford, Adam
Keefe saw action in both volleyball
and basketball. Also taking part
in hoops action were Celeste

Lavoie and incoming freshman Val
Whiting.
Carol Cady, the former discus
star barred from competing in that
event because of her participation
in South Africa, won the 18Im
pound weightlifting event. Cady
lifted 407 3 /4 pounds — 551/4
pounds more than second-place
finisher Stephanie Armitage.

The past, present and
future were repre
sented in Oklahoma
City.

Shotputter Patty Purpur fin
ished third in the 165-pound di
vision with a lift of 396V4 pounds.
Shotputter Pam Dukes competed
in that event and finished third.
Gymnast Tim Ryan, fresh off
his stunning performance at the
U.S. Championships, scored a first,
a second and a third. Ryan won
the still rings with a 9.75, was the
runner-up in the pommel horse
with a 9.60 and tied for third in
the horizontal bar with a 9.70.
Teammate Conrad Voorsanger
tied for fourth in the parallel bars
with a 9.60 and finished fifth in
the vault with a 9.40.
