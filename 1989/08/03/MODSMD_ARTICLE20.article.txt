# The 						question remains: Who'll be the Most in the Least?
## 
### 
The baseball season is — first
and foremost — a test of
will. A war of attrition.
To come out on top, you must
outperform your divisional foes
over a six-month, 162-game
season. In addition to the fact the
other teams in your division want
to win as badly as you do, there
arc a number of other significant
obstacles along the way.
There are injuries to key players
and infighting amongst key
players. There is incompetent
management that rants and raves
from on high but fails to put to
gether a decent ballclub.
And, of course, there is the
daily soap opera played on the
pages of most major metropolitan

newspapers in which we hear that
Smith is divorcing his ninth wife,
Jones is a transvestite, and
Jameson, the alcoholic, has repeat
edly tried to kill the third baseman.
Sometimes, these factors — the
ones not directly related to actu
ally playing the game — derail
even the most talented team on
its trek toward the top. And some
times, the "most talented team"
fails to play up to expectations
while a "lesser club" plays above
its head and runs away with all
the glory.
The pre-All-Star break Bal
timore Orioles provided an excel
lent illustration of this phe
nomenon. Just a year removed
from dropping their first 21 games,

the O's raccd ahead of their
divisional foes and captured the
largest lead among first-place
teams.
Alas for George Will and the
rest of the Raltimoreans, the
Orioles' day in the sun is proving
to he quite ephemeral. In a division
where playing above .500 is an
achievement tantamount to win
ning the World Series, the Orioles
sudden propensity for losing has
allowed even the sixth-place
Yankees to entertain notions of a
division title.
Meanwhile, as the Fall of the
House ot Robinson continues
apace, this fact remains: Someone
must win the American League
Least and advance to the playoffs.

Normally, in attempting to guess
who that might be, one might tick
off a list of contenders — those
teams with a legitimate shot —
and pretenders — the ones who
tease their fans only to disappear
at crunch time.
7 he Toronto Blue Jays are of
the latter variety almost every

year. The pundits proclaim them
the division's "most talented"
team. Yet, somehow the Jays
manage to finish somewhere less
than first almost every year.
The theories for this ineptitude
abound — many of them centering
around n >v departed manager
Jimy Willie. . Fhc former Toronto
skipper, it vns said, was short an
"m" in his t t name. That's M
as in moxi )r manager.
But I digu -s. Toronto, you see,
despite p! ;, v less-than-break
even ball, legitimate a con
tender a on, Milwaukee,
Cleveland Jew York.

35 of their remaining 56 or so
games, they will walk away with
the division title. I know, 1 know.
How can a team hovering at .500
play over .600 for two months. 7
Well, think about it this way:
There arc six teams in contention
and only one of them has to put
together that modest run.
It could be the best pennant
race in over 15 years between six
of the worst incarnations of some
once-proud franchises. The even
tual winner will, of course, fade
away in the playoffs. Just like the
82-79 Mcts did in '73 when they
took the mighty Oakland A's to
Game 7. And just like the '88
Dodgers with that guy named
Orel.
