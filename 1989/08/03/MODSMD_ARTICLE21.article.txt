While the swimming action at
the Olympic Festival was quite
competitive, most of the country's
top swimmers weren't even in
Oklahoma City. Instead, they were
preparing for the U.S. National
Swimming Championships that
began Monday in Los Angeles.
Janet Evans, the triple-gold
medal winner and prized recruit,
captured the 400-meter freestyle
with ease yesterday in a time of
4:06.73. It was the best time in
the world this year and broke the
Poql record of 4:07.10 set by Tif
fany Cohen in the '84 Olympics.
"1 was very happy with my time
tonight; it was about the same I

swam in the Olympic Trials a year
ago," Evans said. "It felt slower
than a 4:06. I need competition
to break the world record."
Evans also won the 400-meter
individual medley Tuesday in a
time of 4:39.36. She outdistanced
junior Michelle Griglione by a
large margin with Griglione finish
ing second in 4:47.24.
Senior Jill Johnson took fourth
in the 200-meter backstroke Tues
day in 2:33.65. Senior John
Witchel was third in the 200-
meter freestyle with a time of
1:49.91. On Monday, Alex Kos
tich took third in the 800-meter
freestyle with a clocking of 8:03.71
Anne Mahoney, an incoming
freshman, finished third in the 100-
meter backstroke in 1:03.32.

TENNIS: Tim Mayotte, who
starred here in the early '80s,
defeated Brad Gilbert in the final
of the Sovran Bank Classic in
Washington, D.C. The final score
was 3-6, 6-4, 7-5 in a match that
was suspended Sunday and com
pleted Monday.
Debbie Graham and Sandra
Birch, the NCAA doubles finalists,
reached the finals of the OTB

before falling to Hu Na and Mi

This week's action on the men's
tour is in Stratton Mountain, Vt.
at the Volvo International. Jim
Grabb, David Wheaton and recruit

of Kevin Curren, ranked 15th in
