# Spaced out in San Jose

### Michelle Duran 
Science fiction is a genre of
fan-dom that has long been hidden
away in the closets of most
people's lives, or worse yet, dis
carded along with their youth.
Not to say that immaturity is
necessarily associated with science
fiction, but science fiction is often
related to adolescent entertain
ment in the form of txxiks, comics
and movies.
In the past decade, however,
with the help of such blockbuster
movies as "Star \Xfars," "Star Trek,"
and "Ghostbusters," sci-fi has be
come much more fashionable
among older age groups as well.
As a testament to this, last
weekend's Time Con (short for
"Conventions of Time") was
peopled with children, teens,
adults and even a few families
here and there.
The Le Baron hotel in San Jose
hosted this spectacular science fic
tion convention, which attracted
fans from all over California and
as far away as New York.
Among the events were
question-and-answer sessions with
actresses and actors, panel discus
sions and a special showing of the
"Rocky Horror Picture Show."
Special guests included Gates
McFadden from "Star Trek: the
Next Generation," Richard Chaves
from "War of the Worlds," and
Janet Fielding and John Lcvenc
from "Doctor Who."
Of course, the entertainment

went beyond what was being of
fered by the organizers of
FimeCon. Without any encour
agement, sci-fi fans took advantage
of a chance to show off homemade
costumes and to network with
other fans about the latest devel
opment on a series or the newest
fan club.
And the costumes! For example,
there was Ratman, the vermin
overlord, who wore a black cape
and a rat's nose. Another fan wore
a Ghostbusters outfit with hand
made equipment that included
some original parts from the
movie's props. And a creative man
and woman stunned everyone with
their beautiful 17th century pirate
costumes. Countless other original
and replicated costumes were
shown off at the costume contest
Saturday night.
Time Con speakers drew their
share of interest as well. For ex
ample, Andy Pischalnikov, a
Sacramento resident, gave an in
triguing slide presentation on
makeup and the creation of the
complex prosthetic masks that put
a large share of the horror in horror
movies.
Then there was the question
and-answer session with Richard
Chaves, veteran of "War of the
Worlds" and "Predator." I ie began
by speaking about his background,
and in particular, his heritage. He
told the crowd that he was a quar
ter American Indian, and that he
considered that to be the spiritual
side of him.
After essentially baring his soul
to the conventioners, a lady in
the audience stood up and tear
fully told him a bit about her
heritage, her past and what she
had left to show for it: a necklace,
which she wore, and pair of moc
casins. Chaves tearfully embraced
her.
Such togetherness typified
Time Con. Perhaps that's why
nearly 2,500 people paid as much
as $20 per day to come to the
gathering.
