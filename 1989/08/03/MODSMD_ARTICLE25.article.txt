# 'Shag' is sadly predictable

### Mark Pinkus Staff writer 
Ignoring my Education 288 paper and balking at
my girlfriend's suggestion to bring a pillow along, I
confidently went off to see "Shag: The Movie." The
previews looked cute and I'm a sucker for movies
about teens coming of age.
But it just didn't make the grade.
Phoebe Cates had an appealing presence on the
screen as Carson. I couldn't help but like Annabeth

Gish, who played the naive girl from "Mystic Pizza."
And Bridget Fonda, by lineage alone, was worth
watching.
So what were the problems? The blame lay on
one lousy script.
The movie told the feeble story of four girls, fresh
out of high school, who speed off to Myrtle Beach
to soak up the sun and meet boys in their last
summer together.
Throw in the year 1963, a shag dance contest
and a losing her virginity to someone other than
her planned husband, and you have all the excite
ment of this flick in two sentences.
After the first 20 minutes I already knew which
boy each girl would eventually end up kissing. When
each couple consummated the act, I really didn't
care at all.
Carson probably had the most amusing situation
after trading her husband-to-be for Buz, a Yale-bound
boy. In the course of an hour and a half, Buz
managed to divulge every line a man has used on
a woman in the past two centuries.
The movie had moments. The audience laughed
when Buz said, "Come on, don't you know we'll
remember it for the rest of our lives." Unfortunately,
these moments were predominantly spent laughing
at the stupidity of the movie instead of laughing
with its cleverness.
And I could find amusement for only so long
with this unrealistic movie that told the tale of four
very uninspiring characters.
So, don't be fooled by the cast or previews, and
remember — sometimes girlfriends do know best.


Annabeth Gish portrays a girl on her last
summer vacation in "Shag." Here, she ap
pears with a co-star from last year's Goldwyn
feature "Mystic Pizza."
