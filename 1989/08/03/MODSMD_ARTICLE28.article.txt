# Rap fest turns sour
## 
### Mark Pinkus Staff writer 
Rap artists have often been
credited with being the modern
day poets of the streets. Their
message is supposedly one which
tells the rest of the nation what
living is really like. If this is the
case, the overwhelming conclusion
from last Saturday's rap festival at
the Oakland Coliseum would be
that life has some serious prob
lems.
The evening had promise. It
highlighted six top acts, ranging
from the newcomers Dc La Soul
to the heavyweight LL Cool J.
The problem, though, wasn't with
these two acts but with the ones
in between.
Rap began as clever street talk
giving a voice to the often un

violence-riddled numbers (the two
groups ironically performed behind
a "Do No Cross — Police Line"
barrier) the show was stopped and
police were brought into the scene.
