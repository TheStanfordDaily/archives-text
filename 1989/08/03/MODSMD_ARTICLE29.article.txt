## Stanford-in-New York: Grads make it big on Wall St.

Perhaps they want to live in
the nation's financial and cultural
capital. Perhaps they are attracted
to the city's glamour and fast pace.
Or perhaps they have listened to
the Frank Sinatra song one too
many times. Whatever the reason,
every year hundreds of Stanford
grads stream to New York City
to "make it."
Many of them wind up on Wall
Street.
New York has a powerful appeal
to the young and career-minded.
It had better, because "The City"
exacts a big toll — especially from
those who have spent four years
on the Farm.
For one, there is New York's
climate, which can range from
tropical rain forest heat to arctic
cold.
And then there is the cost.
Rents in New York dwarf even
Palo Alto's. It costs six bucks an
hour to park your car in midtown.
Even Manhattan McDonald's res
taurants hike their prices by about
40 percent above those in Cali
fornia.

So what brings so many former
Stanford students here?
The common denominator
seems to be "excitement" — every
grad to whom I talked used the
word. They're drawn by the fact
that Will Street is one of the most
influential areas per square inch
in the world.
"It's dynamic and exciting," says
Claire Chamberlain, who received
her B.A. in economics from Stan
ford in 1981 and works in facilities
management at Goldman Sachs.
Although Chamberlain has been
with Sachs only four years, 300
people report directly to her, and
she's responsible for about $100
million a year in company outlays.
"The decisions you make here
really make an impact," she says.

Charles Dicke agrees. "I wanted
to be around young, fast-paced
people," says the '86 grad who
works for Shearson Lehman.
"Young people can really get their
hands dirty on Wall Street."
"At first, I was bummed out by
the weather," he continues. "You
give up jogging and skiing and the
beach to live in New York. But
you learn new ways to have fun
here."
You also make a lot more
money. Almost all the Stanford
grads to whom I talked cited "ex
citement" as their first reason for
coming to New York, but nearly
all of them mentioned, if reluc
tantly, that high salaries were an
incentive.
Chamberlain was the most

straightforward: "You can make a
lot of money here," she says frank
ly-
Investment bankers and bond
traders work hard for their money,
though. Sixty-hour work weeks are
typical, and 90- to 100-hour weeks
are not unheard-of — especially
for the "number crunchers."
Number crunchers are young
analysts, most just out of college,
who are hired on two-year con
tracts. They do the nitty-gritty
mathematical work to find out
where Shearson Lehman and
Goldman Sachs should be putting
their money. Much of their lives
are spent in front of computer
screens.
Apparently they do work very
hard. I made plans to have lunch

with number-cruncher Chele
Chiavacci, a 1988 graduate in in
dustrial engineering. When I
called to say I would be 10 minutes
late, she seemed puzzled as to what
I was talking about. I told her we
were supposed to meet for lunch
in 20 minutes.
Chiavacci said, "Oh, there's no
way I can do it. I just got a project
thrown at me, and I have to get
it out by this afternoon."
So we made plans for the next
day. "Definitely," she said.
When I arrived at the Goldman
Sachs building on Broad Street,
Chiavacci was gone. There was
no record of our appointment, ac
cording to her secretary. She'd
"gone out," no one knew for how
long, and I could "sit and wait"
until she got back, whenever that
might be.
So I waited in the lobby ...
which looked more like an old
fashioned men's club than an of
fice. Chiavacci never showed
(eventually she stopped returning
my calls), but at least 1 got a
privileged glimpse at life on Wall
Street.
There were framed paintings on
the walls and wing-backed chairs.
Men passed, almost universally in
charcoal gray suits. The women
were nattily dressed, their hair
