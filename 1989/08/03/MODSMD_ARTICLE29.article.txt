## Stanford-in-New York: Grads make it big on Wall St.

Perhaps they want to live in
the nation's financial and cultural
capital. Perhaps they are attracted
to the city's glamour and fast pace.
Or perhaps they have listened to
the Frank Sinatra song one too
many times. Whatever the reason,
every year hundreds of Stanford
grads stream to New York City
to "make it."
Many of them wind up on Wall
Street.
New York has a powerful appeal
to the young and career-minded.
It had better, because "The City"
exacts a big toll — especially from
those who have spent four years
on the Farm.
For one, there is New York's
climate, which can range from
tropical rain forest heat to arctic
cold.
And then there is the cost.
Rents in New York dwarf even
Palo Alto's. It costs six bucks an
hour to park your car in midtown.
Even Manhattan McDonald's res
taurants hike their prices by about
40 percent above those in Cali
fornia.

So what brings so many former
Stanford students here?
The common denominator
seems to be "excitement" — every
grad to whom I talked used the
word. They're drawn by the fact
that Will Street is one of the most
influential areas per square inch
in the world.
"It's dynamic and exciting," says
Claire Chamberlain, who received
her B.A. in economics from Stan
ford in 1981 and works in facilities
management at Goldman Sachs.
Although Chamberlain has been
with Sachs only four years, 300
people report directly to her, and
she's responsible for about $100
million a year in company outlays.
"The decisions you make here
really make an impact," she says.

Charles Dicke agrees. "I wanted
to be around young, fast-paced
people," says the '86 grad who
works for Shearson Lehman.
"Young people can really get their
hands dirty on Wall Street."
"At first, I was bummed out by
the weather," he continues. "You
give up jogging and skiing and the
beach to live in New York. But
you learn new ways to have fun
here."
You also make a lot more
money. Almost all the Stanford
grads to whom I talked cited "ex
citement" as their first reason for
coming to New York, but nearly
all of them mentioned, if reluc
tantly, that high salaries were an
incentive.
Chamberlain was the most

straightforward: "You can make a
lot of money here," she says frank
ly-
Investment bankers and bond
traders work hard for their money,
though. Sixty-hour work weeks are
typical, and 90- to 100-hour weeks
are not unheard-of — especially
for the "number crunchers."
Number crunchers are young
analysts, most just out of college,
who are hired on two-year con
tracts. They do the nitty-gritty
mathematical work to find out
where Shearson Lehman and
Goldman Sachs should be putting
their money. Much of their lives
are spent in front of computer
screens.
Apparently they do work very
hard. I made plans to have lunch

with number-cruncher Chele
Chiavacci, a 1988 graduate in in
dustrial engineering. When I
called to say I would be 10 minutes
late, she seemed puzzled as to what
I was talking about. I told her we
were supposed to meet for lunch
in 20 minutes.
Chiavacci said, "Oh, there's no
way I can do it. I just got a project
thrown at me, and I have to get
it out by this afternoon."
So we made plans for the next
day. "Definitely," she said.
When I arrived at the Goldman
Sachs building on Broad Street,
Chiavacci was gone. There was
no record of our appointment, ac
cording to her secretary. She'd
"gone out," no one knew for how
long, and I could "sit and wait"
until she got back, whenever that
might be.
So I waited in the lobby ...
which looked more like an old
fashioned men's club than an of
fice. Chiavacci never showed
(eventually she stopped returning
my calls), but at least 1 got a
privileged glimpse at life on Wall
Street.
There were framed paintings on
the walls and wing-backed chairs.
Men passed, almost universally in
charcoal gray suits. The women
were nattily dressed, their hair

slicked back efficiently in buns.
Surprisingly, the topic of con
versation was not corporate
mergers but special diets and ex
ercise programs. "How many
calories are in a Big Mac?" one
man asked his friend. "I need to
cut 10 pounds and start building
strength in my upper body," said
another.
There was the general air of a
prep school locker room.
A third proudly announced that
he'd only had a salad for lunch.
"Way to go," a colleague encour
aged.
One 1986 Stanford grad, pres
ently a bond trader on Wall Street,
later told me that "packaging" of
personal appearances was very im
portant for traders and investment
bankers. "In fact, it's more true
for the men than the women," she
said. "You have to have the right
tie, the right watch, the right suit."
She likened the atmosphere to a

college fraternity.
Though a Wall Street career de
mands long hours, all grads say
they have time for an active social
life as well. "I do something every
night," says Chamberlain, whether
it's a party, a dinner with friends
or some outside involvement in
politics or the arts.
However, several grads com
plain that socializing in Manhattan
can be as hectic as working here.
"It's go, go, go," says David Boon,
of the class of '82 and presently
in finance at Drexel Burnham.
"Socializing gets very driven.
There's so much going on, you're
always afraid of missing the ac
tion."
Boon spent his first few years
out of college in San Francisco,
working for Bank of America. He
said that life there was much more
"relaxed." He got home at 5:30,
went for a jog in Golden Gate
Park and spent more evenings at
home.
Nevertheless, Boon says he has
"fallen in love with Manhattan"
and his work on Wall Street,

though not manv of his friends
have had the same experience.
The hardships of the city are too
much for many of them. The prices
and the weather and the crowds
drive them "hack West."
"Almost all my Stanford friends
moved back to California," Boon
says.
So have most of Clair Cham
berlain's Stanford friends. In fact,
many were willing to make some
career compromises in favor of
their "lifestyle" choice. "Career op
portunities arc far and away better
in New York," Chamberlain says
unequivocally.
So, cach year Stanford grads
come in great numbers to New
York, but in almost as great num
bers, they head back to open
spaces and sunnier climes. The
native New Yorker would say they
couldn't handle "The City." The
native Californian would say they
finally have come to their senses
and chosen the life of sanity.
I'm not going to say one is right,
but I'm moving back to San Fran
cisco in the fall.
