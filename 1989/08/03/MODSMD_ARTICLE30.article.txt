## Stanford summer program prepares low-income teens for college High school students are 'upward bound' 
### Eric Muñoz Staff writer 
The lounges of 553 Campus
Drive and the Beta house will
fall quiet tomorrow. The high
schoolers are going home.
For six weeks this summer,
Stanford has sponsored a pro
gram that seeks to increase mi
nority enrollment in higher
education.
The program is called Up
ward Bound.
Approximately 50 high
school students participated in
the six-week, federally-funded
program, which specifically
helps low-income students
develop the skills and motiva
tion necessary for life in a col
lege environment. The students
arc the first members of their
families to consider working
towards a college degree.
Part of the Public Service
Center's School Support Pro
grams Division, Upward
Bound targets students from
two particular areas in the Se
quoia High School District on
the San Francisco Peninsula.
Upward Bound is not a typ
ical summer school program.
Although students do attend
classes, they also participate in
residentially-based educational
programs and work 17 hours
each week at a campus job.
Students take classes, ranging
from bioloev to ethics. The

This is True
Uncle Jose,
You were my favorite uncle,
because you were the youngest.
I always looked up to you he
cause of how tough you were,
you were a gangleader. I was
small and always felt proud of
who you were. I would even brag
to my friends about it.
Then they found you dead of
a heroine overdose, you hurt me.
I forgive you, hut now 1 under
stand why my older uncles were
always on your case, you were
going in the wrong road, the
road you chose had death in the
middle of it, and you were
stopped dead when you were 19!
Maybe it is when you died
that I decided not to follow your
example, but I wish you were
alive.

teachcrs are professionals, who
are assisted by Stanford students
enrolled in the Stanford
Teacher Education Program
(STEP).
Students work in the after
noon. Some answer phones at
Braun Music Center. Others
learn the ins-and-outs of the
Green Library loan desk. They
receive $4.25 per hour.
In the evening, the students
participate in programs coor
dinated by 10 residential coun
selors, who seek to expose them
to cultural diversity, the arts
and issues affecting their com
munity.
"At first, when I came here
I thought that everything was
going to be boring," recalls Ana
Castaneda, a junior in the pro
gram. "But 1 found out that
there are things more important
and fun than T.V."
"The thing I like about this
program is that it's fun, enter
taining, and you learn a lot,
and you work, and you get
paid," comments Antwone Bat
tle, a freshman at Woodside
High School.
The writings printed here are
excerpts from essays some Up
ward Bound students wrote for
their classes and an evening
course in creative writing. They
provide a glimpse into the pro
gram and the students who par
ticipated in it.

I was born and raised on my
native land until we moved from
Tonga to the U.S.A. It was sun
shine and warm weather
everyday except for a couple of
rain. My family had everything
we needed, but we wanted a
better life. My father worked,
while my mother stayed home
as a housewife would. There were
seven kids in our family until
1980 when my youngest brother
was born ...
Why we moved here I didn't
know until a tew years later. It
was because my parents want a
better life and future for us kids.
Also for medical reasons for my
father. He was a little sick, but
he would get worse, and the
USA was the only place to get it.

My first impressions of this
program were: What am I doing
here? Who are all these people?
I'm going to kill my Algebra
teacher for encouraging me to
get on this program.
Now I'm glad I'm here. Every
body is friendly and I have many
friends now I have to thank my
Algebra teacher for encouraging
me to come to this program.

"Hi."
"Hi."
"What's your problem?"
"What's your's?"
"I lost my boyfriend, have you
seen him. 7 "
"No I have not, but I saw a
donkey."
"That must have been him."
"But then 1 saw a mule fol
lowing it."
"Don't worry that was my
sister."

Who am 1?
One important thing you
should know about me is that I
am very shy and I don't talk
much, but I am learning to
change those habits.
In my family, I have four
brothers and five sisters but one
of them died in the ocean when
trying to escape from Vietnam.
One thing I missed the most is
my mom for she had passed away
with cancer in Vietnam when I
was very young. On the other
hand, I am thankful for a won
derful dad 1 have. Ever since my
mom passed away, my dad did
a good of raising the children.
I came to the United States
in 1980. 1 didn't know any Eng
lish and it took me about two
years to learn English. Now that
I have been here for almost nine
years my English had improved
a great deal. My goal is to go
to a four-year college and get
my MBA in business and marry
a beautiful wife and live a happy
life. My other goal is to be a
professional athlete such as in
tennis or basketball, but I doubt
these goals will ever come true.

What My Interests Are
My name is Ana Castaneda.
I am seventeen years old and
I've been living in the United
States for three years. Before I
came here I was living in Mexico
in a beautiful state called
Guadalajara. I studied there up
to seventh grade. I came here
and started eight grade. I came
to this country because I believe
that here are better opportunities
to study and also because I
wanted to learn English.
My academic interests at
school are math, reading and his
tory. I like math because it's an
international language and I un
derstand it. I like Reading and
History because you can know
many different places and also
you can learn a lot of different
countries.
I like sports because sports are
good for your body and health.
I like to play badminton and I
like to run.
I am going to college because
I think that going to college and
graduating offers you many op
portunities. It offers you a better
life, more opportunities of getting
a better job and offers you more
opportunities of having a better
family. I plan to major in com
puter science because I think
that there will be a lot of jobs
available in that field. Computers
are always changing and you can
learn something new.

If I were to dress like a woman,
I would feel uncomfortable and
embarrassed in front of the girls.
Imagine when I went to a woman
restroom with my height heels
and a lot of makeup. All the
girls will laughing and making
fun in front of me. Imagine how
other people is treating me if I
dress like a woman. They will
treating me different because the
way I looks and the way I act.
They will treat me as a woman.
My friends would do the same
thing.

Discrimination and Racism
If I were to write a book I
would write it on discrimination
and racism. I think that a lot of
people are being discriminated
against and having their rights
taken away. I am a Mexican and
I am always being discriminated
against; that really makes me
mad. I do not look like a typical
Mexican; I am white, I have dark
red hair and I have freckles. At
first, most people think that I
am from the U.S.A. (I do not
say America because I believe
that all people from North and
South America are Americans)
and they treat me pretty nice,
but when they find out I am
Mexican some treat me very dif
ferently.
I am very proud of being
Mexican and I would not change
it for the world. Most of the
time when someone says some
thing bad about someone I get
so mad and defend them. I can
not stand it when they do this,
I get even madder if it's because
of race. I have pretty good
grades, a B-plus average, and I
really want to go to college. I
will be the first in my family to
go to college. I will be so proud
and so will my family. I know I
can do it.
I want to write about discrim
ination and racism because I
want people to know how it feels
to be discriminated against and
what it can do to someone. A
lot of people do not realize what
it does and how it makes us feel.
I think that if people read and
learn more about it they would
think twice about what they say
and do. It might have an effect
and change what they think
about us minorities. Many people
think that minorities are differ
ent in some way, bur we are not.
Our skin may be different, but
on the inside we are all the same.
In spite of our different appear
ance, we are all humans.
Racism is a big dilemma. It is
very complicated and for some
very hard to understand. I would
like to help those people under
stand. Maybe if they understood
they would not discriminate
against us and our race. I dream
of a day when there is no racism
and discrimination. Hopefully
there will be a place where all
races are united and all children,
black, white, Asian, Hispanic,
etc. are playing together. Perhaps
this day will come, but we all
need to help.
