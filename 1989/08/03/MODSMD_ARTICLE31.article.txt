## Making money: John Ford and the Centennial Campaign 
### Susan McKean Mark Weiner Editorial staff 
It could be considered unnerv
ing having a tete-a-tete with some
one who regularly makes more
than $100,000 from his conversa
tion partners.
But if John Ford made people
nervous, he wouldn't be making
Stanford so much money.
As director of the Centennial
Campaign, Ford is raising $1.1 bil
lion dollars for the University.
For him, nothing could be more
natural.
He speaks the language of
money. He knows all its prefer
ences. He frequents its haunts.
His words rarely include num
bers, his manner is sympathetic
and his office demurs modestly.
Ford looms as a legend in the
fund-raising business. He's been
doing it all of his occupational life.
He started in 1973, two years
after graduating with a bachelor's
in history from Stanford. While
attending a master's program in
history and public administration
at the University of Southern Cal
ifornia, he plunged into full-time
development work for Cal Tech's
$130 million campaign.

He moved from Cal Tech to
climb the rungs in the University
of Chicago development office,
and then swung west back to Stan
ford.
Starting out in 1977 as Associ
ate Director of Medical Develop
ment, Ford has moved up through
the Stanford development office.
1 le was appointed to his current
post as Vice President for Devel
opment in 1988.
In this capacity he now con
ducts the most ambitious fund
raising campaign in the hißtory of
higher education.
The Weekly spoke with Ford to
hear his views on the Centennial
Campaign.
How do the Stanford commu
nity and the development office
interact to set the goals of the
Centennial Campaign?
Stanford has, to the best of my
knowledge, the best academic
process for identifying things that
faculty and students want to ac
complish and bringing those for
ward through their departments
to the provost. We have a group
that meets about once a
month—four representatives from
the development office and four

representatives from the provost's
office. We get together and talk
about those things that the provost
has determined to he important
academically and we talk about
the feasibility of raising money for
those projects.
So, it's a very grass-roots kind
of effort that culminates in a dis
cussion in the provost's office and
then with the development office.
That's how priorities are set. Ac
ademic programs are ranked into
four categories, and that deter
mines how much effort this office
can afford to put into pursuing
private support for those projects.
It's a very well-understood and
very well-organized process. As I
said, very few other institutions
have done it as well or as long.
The ASSU recently conducted
a poll that asked students where
they thought Centennial funds
ought to be allocated. How did
you respond to that poll?
Well, 1 was delighted to have
an opportunity to visit with some
of the student leaders who partic
ipated in bringing forth that poll
and its results. I think there were
a couple of comments. Number
one, a number of things in which

the students were interested were
embedded in the goals of the cam
paign. The problem is u>e (in the
development office) have to talk
more gencrically than specifically.
The students just didn't see the
specifics. The generics actually
covered some of the things in
which they were interested.
Then there were a few other
things in which the students were
interested for which I have great
sympathy, but the provost has
learned and we certainly have
learned by firsthand experience,
that you don't always attract dol
lars for everything you need. I
think there were some things that
we recognized early on were im
portant, but they weren't going to
come from private gift support.
The residences are a very good
example. This went all the way
back to 1961—we had an under
graduate residence component in
every one of our three fund-raising
campaigns. We hadn't raised a
ruckle as of this spring and we
weren't headed toward raising any
money in this campaign. So we
felt it best to defer and to focus
on some other activities.
Now, in the process of deferring,
it became such an urgent conver
sation among the trustees—and
the students clearly had a role in
stressing the urgency of the mat
ter — that the trustees came back
to us and to the provost and said,
"Is there any way we can play
with this and come up with a
project that maybe isn't as costly?"
In so doing, a couple of the trus
tees said, "We'll make the down
payment, we'll put up the first gift
money on this to get it going."
It's been a wonderful example of
how the institution can galvanize
around a project that clearly didn't
carry any outside interest for a
long period of time.
Why didn't undergraduate
housing carry outside interest?
Number one, the most difficult
dollars to raise in the last decade,
for any institution, have been dol
lars for facilities. Number two, res
idences are difficult to raise money
for because sophisticated donors
understand that there is an income
spring that supports residences—
that's your room and board. Num
ber three, in this institution, we
don't have the orientation around
the residences that exists at some
of our Ivy League counterparts.
We just haven't built up the tra

dition of investing in residences
and residential education.
Now we're obviously trying to
change that. But even in those
institutions that we talk to—and
we do keep close tabs on what
the Ivy League schools
do—they've had very little success
raising money for residences.
So, it was an uphill battle from
day one. And it wouldn't have
worked if the trustees hadn't
stepped forward. The message that
certainly can be carried back to
the students is that the trustees
listen to them.
How do internal events at
Stanford affect outsiders' percep
tions of the University?
A great deal. A great deal. Ob
viously. This last year or two has
been a tough year for us in the
media. Whether it's the Western
Culture debate or a change in the
Hoover leadership, or the spring
occupation of the President's Of
fice— all of those things have
immediate impact on the devel
opment operation and the cam
paign activity, primarily because
they become distractions. Rather
than talking to people about in
vesting in Stanford, we have to
talk a lot about these issues that
are getting the headlines.
But it is a part of our job. We
try to get beyond the headlines in
The Los Angeles Times or The
Wall Street Journal to explain
more of the subtleties or the real
facts of what's taking place.
That's where faculty and stu
dents come into play. We draw on
them. (Philosophy Prof.) John
Perry made a tour through South
ern California this spring, explain
ing the Cultures, Ideas and Values
program, which was very helpful.
We got very good attendance from
people who had been very critical
of the debate. We have students
in those situations, too.
But there's no doubt that cur
rent activities on campus do have
an impact. It certainly would help
us if students understood at times
that their actions have ramifica
tions on people who are providing
support that really docs help create
the milieu in which you attend
your classes.
Private support is obviously very
crucial to a private institution. I'm
not saying that the debate should
not take place: It should. It's very
healthy and I tell people all the
time: If there wasn't controversy
