## Making money: John Ford and the Centennial Campaign 
### Susan McKean Mark Weiner Editorial staff 
It could be considered unnerv
ing having a tete-a-tete with some
one who regularly makes more
than $100,000 from his conversa
tion partners.
But if John Ford made people
nervous, he wouldn't be making
Stanford so much money.
As director of the Centennial
Campaign, Ford is raising $1.1 bil
lion dollars for the University.
For him, nothing could be more
natural.
He speaks the language of
money. He knows all its prefer
ences. He frequents its haunts.
His words rarely include num
bers, his manner is sympathetic
and his office demurs modestly.
Ford looms as a legend in the
fund-raising business. He's been
doing it all of his occupational life.
He started in 1973, two years
after graduating with a bachelor's
in history from Stanford. While
attending a master's program in
history and public administration
at the University of Southern Cal
ifornia, he plunged into full-time
development work for Cal Tech's
$130 million campaign.

He moved from Cal Tech to
climb the rungs in the University
of Chicago development office,
and then swung west back to Stan
ford.
Starting out in 1977 as Associ
ate Director of Medical Develop
ment, Ford has moved up through
the Stanford development office.
1 le was appointed to his current
post as Vice President for Devel
opment in 1988.
In this capacity he now con
ducts the most ambitious fund
raising campaign in the hißtory of
higher education.
The Weekly spoke with Ford to
hear his views on the Centennial
Campaign.
How do the Stanford commu
nity and the development office
interact to set the goals of the
Centennial Campaign?
Stanford has, to the best of my
knowledge, the best academic
process for identifying things that
faculty and students want to ac
complish and bringing those for
ward through their departments
to the provost. We have a group
that meets about once a
month—four representatives from
the development office and four

representatives from the provost's
office. We get together and talk
about those things that the provost
has determined to he important
academically and we talk about
the feasibility of raising money for
those projects.
So, it's a very grass-roots kind
of effort that culminates in a dis
cussion in the provost's office and
then with the development office.
That's how priorities are set. Ac
ademic programs are ranked into
four categories, and that deter
mines how much effort this office
can afford to put into pursuing
private support for those projects.
It's a very well-understood and
very well-organized process. As I
said, very few other institutions
have done it as well or as long.
The ASSU recently conducted
a poll that asked students where
they thought Centennial funds
ought to be allocated. How did
you respond to that poll?
Well, 1 was delighted to have
an opportunity to visit with some
of the student leaders who partic
ipated in bringing forth that poll
and its results. I think there were
a couple of comments. Number
one, a number of things in which

the students were interested were
embedded in the goals of the cam
paign. The problem is u>e (in the
development office) have to talk
more gencrically than specifically.
The students just didn't see the
specifics. The generics actually
covered some of the things in
which they were interested.
Then there were a few other
things in which the students were
interested for which I have great
sympathy, but the provost has
learned and we certainly have
learned by firsthand experience,
that you don't always attract dol
lars for everything you need. I
think there were some things that
we recognized early on were im
portant, but they weren't going to
come from private gift support.
The residences are a very good
example. This went all the way
back to 1961—we had an under
graduate residence component in
every one of our three fund-raising
campaigns. We hadn't raised a
ruckle as of this spring and we
weren't headed toward raising any
money in this campaign. So we
felt it best to defer and to focus
on some other activities.
Now, in the process of deferring,
it became such an urgent conver
sation among the trustees—and
the students clearly had a role in
stressing the urgency of the mat
ter — that the trustees came back
to us and to the provost and said,
"Is there any way we can play
with this and come up with a
project that maybe isn't as costly?"
In so doing, a couple of the trus
tees said, "We'll make the down
payment, we'll put up the first gift
money on this to get it going."
It's been a wonderful example of
how the institution can galvanize
around a project that clearly didn't
carry any outside interest for a
long period of time.
Why didn't undergraduate
housing carry outside interest?
Number one, the most difficult
dollars to raise in the last decade,
for any institution, have been dol
lars for facilities. Number two, res
idences are difficult to raise money
for because sophisticated donors
understand that there is an income
spring that supports residences—
that's your room and board. Num
ber three, in this institution, we
don't have the orientation around
the residences that exists at some
of our Ivy League counterparts.
We just haven't built up the tra

dition of investing in residences
and residential education.
Now we're obviously trying to
change that. But even in those
institutions that we talk to—and
we do keep close tabs on what
the Ivy League schools
do—they've had very little success
raising money for residences.
So, it was an uphill battle from
day one. And it wouldn't have
worked if the trustees hadn't
stepped forward. The message that
certainly can be carried back to
the students is that the trustees
listen to them.
How do internal events at
Stanford affect outsiders' percep
tions of the University?
A great deal. A great deal. Ob
viously. This last year or two has
been a tough year for us in the
media. Whether it's the Western
Culture debate or a change in the
Hoover leadership, or the spring
occupation of the President's Of
fice— all of those things have
immediate impact on the devel
opment operation and the cam
paign activity, primarily because
they become distractions. Rather
than talking to people about in
vesting in Stanford, we have to
talk a lot about these issues that
are getting the headlines.
But it is a part of our job. We
try to get beyond the headlines in
The Los Angeles Times or The
Wall Street Journal to explain
more of the subtleties or the real
facts of what's taking place.
That's where faculty and stu
dents come into play. We draw on
them. (Philosophy Prof.) John
Perry made a tour through South
ern California this spring, explain
ing the Cultures, Ideas and Values
program, which was very helpful.
We got very good attendance from
people who had been very critical
of the debate. We have students
in those situations, too.
But there's no doubt that cur
rent activities on campus do have
an impact. It certainly would help
us if students understood at times
that their actions have ramifica
tions on people who are providing
support that really docs help create
the milieu in which you attend
your classes.
Private support is obviously very
crucial to a private institution. I'm
not saying that the debate should
not take place: It should. It's very
healthy and I tell people all the
time: If there wasn't controversy

here, we wouldn't be doing our
job. I do think that it's important
to realize that what happens here
does have a ripple effect into the
outside world.
You probably received a couple
of phone calls after the occupa
tion?
More than a couple. Again, I
think it was a big job, it still is a
very big job, to explain the whole
UCMI report and all of the sur
rounding issues that certainly
played a part in that occupation.
And there are two sides to it.
There was perhaps a negative re
sponse because of the occupation.
But as you know, there was also
a negative response in the way
that the police were brought into
the settling of that occupation.
We have to play both sides of it.
It isn't only one-dimensional. It
isn't only the conservative seg
ments of our constituency that we
hear from.
Those kinds of issues arc going
to come up all the time. We expect
it, it's part of our job, and we're
happy to be ambassadors explain
ing what's going on.
Many undergraduates sec how
much money you're raising in
the Centennial Campaign and are
angry because it is still costing
them more each year to attend
school. How will the Centennial
campaign really help undergrad
uate education?
What we are doing will help
make undergraduate education
more accessible to more people.
The place I'd start is undergrad
uate scholarships. We have raised
more money as a percentage of
our very ambitious goal in the
undergraduate scholarship cate
gory to the point where we raised
the goal in February. So that in
and of itself helps those people
who are going to come here.
I think there are other ways in
which we arc helping to under
write the programs both on the
graduate and undergraduate levels
that will help the University han
dle the overall costs of the aca
demic program. But 1 can't tell
you that it will, in the end, cut
the costs. It will cut the increase
in cost. The cost is there, it's not
going to go down—it's a question
of how much it will continue to
increase. I'm sure that our success
will help determine the rate of
that increase. If we weren't raising
money, the rate would have to be
much greater.
Remember that we raise gifts in
two forms. We raise expendable
gifts, which help us right here and
now, when you're going to school.
But a lot of what we do is build
endowment, and that's a much
longer term process.
If you remember that if we
receive a gift of $100,000 to endow
a scholarship, in a given year, that

only gives us $4,750 to spend. So
you're not having a $100,000 im
pact next year. You're only have
a $4,750 impact on the institution.
But you're going to have it in
perpetuity. That's a big part of
our job, to stay focused on the
long term.
Although undergrads don't
think in the long term. They
need assistance now.
That's right. You've got a four
year window. I fully understand
why you stress in painful tones
some of the views you do. Just
remember that when I went
through here 20 years ago, the
percentage of disposable family in
come that went towards education
was the same. The raw dollar num
ber is considerably more and
driven by inflation. The percent
of family income that goes toward
education is still the same.
Let's turn to questions of eth
ics. History Prof. Barton
Bernstein recently criticized the
extent to which universities have
become entangled with large cor
porations for their funding. This
certainly is almost a defining
characteristic of the Centennial
campaign. Do you see any prob
lems in this situation?
There is a potential problem, if
you're not diligent in analyzing
those relationships and setting
boundaries that are appropriate.
But you can. Our faculty and this
institution have been cognizant of
those potential problems to the
point where there is the close scru
tiny that Prof. Bernstein and
others want. I would want to reas
sure him that his colleagues that
are involved in those relation
ships—faculty who arc running
the programs in which these cor
porations are interested—are very
cognizant of those boundaries.
My personal experience has
been that I've never seen a cor
poration that was dictating the
research that this institution was
going to pursue. I have not seen
a corporation keep a faculty mem
ber from publishing what he or
she wanted to. I have never seen
a corporation lock up graduate stu
dents in a way that was inappro
priate. I think that this institution
is sensitive to those kinds of issues.
But doesn't the preponderance
of corporate funding establish a
milieu—nothing conspiratorial,
but something perhaps deeper
and more significant?
1 think for the society as a
whole, it is healthy to have the
research universities talking with
corporations that will translate a
lot of what we do in a very fun
damental way (research, program
ming) into products and activities
that have an impact on society as
a whole. 1 think that's a gaxi

bridge. I think places like Stan
ford can demonstrate how it can
be done well. Particularly if we
conduct our business in the open,
so that you or Prof. Bernstein or
whoever can come by and see and
talk to and visit with the faculty
and the students who are talking
with these corporate representa
tives. I think it can be healthy for
society as a whole.
The contrast you might want
to draw is the way the Japanese
all lock up together—the govern
ment, the industry, the educa
tional institutions. You want to
talk about being an arm of some
body else! Quite honestly, we can't
even order that.
As a society, we are competing
in a much tougher world today,

and I think that if we do build
good, strong bridges between cor
porations and research univer
sities—bridges that everybody can
view—that will be good for all of
us.
The concern that you're ex
pressing is very appropriate and
we want to be vigilant, but at the
same time, I think there are ways
to go about it that would be terrific
for the institution.
Again, putting on my specific
hat in the university, we need
them. We need their support.
There's an awful lot of this insti
tution that depends on that kind
of support.
Would the Centennial Cam
paign accept money from uneth
ical corporations—corporations
with egregious environmental or
labor practices, for instance? Is

there any sort of ethical review
process?
We can't do that kind of re
search. We don't have access to
the kind of information that would
let us closely scrutinize the whole
range of the donor population of
this institution. I think that we
try to be as careful as we can if
there's something in the public
record that we're aware of.
The distinction I'm drawing is
that we don't go digging for po
tential problems. If there's some
thing that's readily apparent, we
will actively debate it in this in
stitution.
I assure you that we have had
instances in this institution where
we have turned down gifts of sup-

port because we thought it was
not in our guiding principles.
The majority of the examples
would fall in the category of donors
wanting to put restrictions on gifts,
wanting us to use it in very specific
ways that we don't feel comfort
able abiding by. We obviously have
had an open debate about divesti
ture around South African oper
ations over the last several years.
I think that's a good example of
where the institution, not this of
fice in particular but the institu
tion elsewhere, has looked at social
issues of importance.
I think that probably will ex
pand. 1 don't know what form it
will take and 1 think the Board
of Trustees and the Committee
on Investment Responsibility
(which is I think the right place
to house that kind of study) arc
considering further activities that
they might undertake.

You're asking questions in a grey
area, limited for the most part by
our lack of knowledge of a lot
these people. But again that's part
of my job, to keep my antennae
up and sense when there might
be something a little fishy. And
obviously 99.99 percent of the gifts
that are offered to this institution
are offered with no strings and
from very good people. So we don't
have to get into it very often, but
we need to be sensitive.
Are there times when simply
the ethics of a donor are in ques>
tion?
Sure. Some of these people
being indicted for Wall Street ac
tivities at the moment—that's a
very sensitive area. And I can tell
you that we have, unfortunately,
one Stanford alumnus who is un
der indictment. I am not going to
actively pursue a gift from that
person.
Quite honestly, I haven't gone
to look at his gift record to see
if we've received any gifts in the
past. We haven't received anything
major that I know of. But I'm not
going to go pursue a gift from him.
What will Stanford look like
when the Centennial Campaign
is over? How will all these major
changes effect the University,
particularly the undergraduate
experience here?
I hope that we will provide a
more solid financial underpin
ning—particularly for the School
of Humanities and Sciences, but
also for Engineering and Earth
Sciences. They will have more en
dowment there, they will have a
few more flexible funds and means
to create new programs and take
advantage of new interdisciplinary
opportunities.
1 hope the Centennial Chair
Professorship component of the
campaign is successful, so the
provost finds himself with 12 new
endowed chairs where we have
senior faculty teaching undergrad
uates as their primary mission.
And I certainly hope that we con
tinue to have the success we've
had with undergraduate scholar
ships and graduate fellowships, so
that anyone who wants to come
to this institution will have the
opportunity to do so.
A lot of the vitality that I've
seen here really stems from the
permeability of the boundaries of
schools and departments and the
opportunities that students have
to find a different kind of mix of
academic opportunity that comes
from different kinds of affiliations
and associations among professors.
If those kinds of new opportu
nities come out of this campaign,
I'll be absolutely delighted, but the
minute the campaign is over, the
next morning we're going to have
to get up and keep raising money
for this university.

The Weekly spoke with Ford to
hear his views on the Centennial
Campaign.
How do the Stanford commu
nity and the development office
interact to set the goals of the
Centennial Campaign?
Stanford has, to the best of my
knowledge, the best academic
process for identifying things that
faculty and students want to ac
complish and bringing those for
ward through their departments
to the provost. We have a group
that meets about once a
month—four representatives from
the development office and four

representatives from the provost's
office. We get together and talk
about those things that the provost
has determined to he important
academically and we talk about
the feasibility of raising money for
those projects.
So, it's a very grass-roots kind
of effort that culminates in a dis
cussion in the provost's office and
then with the development office.
That's how priorities are set. Ac
ademic programs are ranked into
four categories, and that deter
mines how much effort this office
can afford to put into pursuing
private support for those projects.
It's a very well-understood and
very well-organized process. As I
said, very few other institutions
have done it as well or as long.
The ASSU recently conducted
a poll that asked students where
they thought Centennial funds
ought to be allocated. How did

Well, 1 was delighted to have

Then there were a few other

sympathy, but the provost has

learned by firsthand experience,
that you don't always attract dol
lars for everything you need. I
think there were some things that
we recognized early on were im
portant, but they weren't going to
come from private gift support.
The residences are a very good
example. This went all the way
back to 1961—we had an under
graduate residence component in
every one of our three fund-raising
campaigns. We hadn't raised a
ruckle as of this spring and we

Now, in the process of deferring,
it became such an urgent conver

the students clearly had a role in
stressing the urgency of the mat
ter — that the trustees came back
to us and to the provost and said,
"Is there any way we can play
with this and come up with a
project that maybe isn't as costly?"
In so doing, a couple of the trus
tees said, "We'll make the down
payment, we'll put up the first gift
money on this to get it going."
It's been a wonderful example of
how the institution can galvanize
around a project that clearly didn't
carry any outside interest for a
long period of time.
Why didn't undergraduate
housing carry outside interest?
Number one, the most difficult
dollars to raise in the last decade,
for any institution, have been dol

idences are difficult to raise money
for because sophisticated donors
understand that there is an income
spring that supports residences—
that's your room and board. Num

We just haven't built up the tra

and residential education.
Now we're obviously trying to
change that. But even in those
institutions that we talk to—and
we do keep close tabs on what
the Ivy League schools
do—they've had very little success
raising money for residences.
So, it was an uphill battle from
day one. And it wouldn't have
worked if the trustees hadn't
stepped forward. The message that
certainly can be carried back to
the students is that the trustees
listen to them.
How do internal events at
Stanford affect outsiders' percep

A great deal. A great deal. Ob
viously. This last year or two has
been a tough year for us in the
media. Whether it's the Western
Culture debate or a change in the
Hoover leadership, or the spring
occupation of the President's Of

immediate impact on the devel

You probably received a couple
of phone calls after the occupa

More than a couple. Again, I

very big job, to explain the whole
UCMI report and all of the sur
rounding issues that certainly
played a part in that occupation.

more money as a percentage of
our very ambitious goal in the

the goal in February. So that in
and of itself helps those people
who are going to come here.
I think there are other ways in
which we arc helping to under
write the programs both on the
graduate and undergraduate levels
that will help the University han
dle the overall costs of the aca
demic program. But 1 can't tell
you that it will, in the end, cut
the costs. It will cut the increase
in cost. The cost is there, it's not
going to go down—it's a question
of how much it will continue to
increase. I'm sure that our success
will help determine the rate of
that increase. If we weren't raising
money, the rate would have to be
much greater.
Remember that we raise gifts in
two forms. We raise expendable
gifts, which help us right here and
now, when you're going to school.
But a lot of what we do is build
endowment, and that's a much

a $4,750 impact on the institution.
But you're going to have it in
perpetuity. That's a big part of
our job, to stay focused on the
long term.
Although undergrads don't
think in the long term. They
need assistance now.
That's right. You've got a four
year window. I fully understand
why you stress in painful tones
some of the views you do. Just
remember that when I went
through here 20 years ago, the
percentage of disposable family in

driven by inflation. The percent
of family income that goes toward
education is still the same.

certainly is almost a defining
characteristic of the Centennial

There is a potential problem, if

boundaries that are appropriate.
But you can. Our faculty and this
institution have been cognizant of
those potential problems to the
point where there is the close scru

others want. I would want to reas
sure him that his colleagues that
are involved in those relation
ships—faculty who arc running
the programs in which these cor
porations are interested—are very
cognizant of those boundaries.
My personal experience has
been that I've never seen a cor
poration that was dictating the
research that this institution was
going to pursue. I have not seen
a corporation keep a faculty mem

dents in a way that was inappro

is sensitive to those kinds of issues.
But doesn't the preponderance
of corporate funding establish a
milieu—nothing conspiratorial,
but something perhaps deeper
and more significant?
1 think for the society as a
whole, it is healthy to have the
research universities talking with
corporations that will translate a
lot of what we do in a very fun
damental way (research, program
ming) into products and activities
that have an impact on society as
a whole. 1 think that's a gaxi

bridge. I think places like Stan
ford can demonstrate how it can
be done well. Particularly if we
conduct our business in the open,
so that you or Prof. Bernstein or
whoever can come by and see and
talk to and visit with the faculty
and the students who are talking
with these corporate representa
tives. I think it can be healthy for
society as a whole.
The contrast you might want
to draw is the way the Japanese
all lock up together—the govern
ment, the industry, the educa
tional institutions. You want to
talk about being an arm of some
body else! Quite honestly, we can't
even order that.
As a society, we are competing
in a much tougher world today,

and I think that if we do build
good, strong bridges between cor
porations and research univer
sities—bridges that everybody can
view—that will be good for all of
us.
The concern that you're ex
pressing is very appropriate and
we want to be vigilant, but at the
same time, I think there are ways
to go about it that would be terrific
for the institution.
Again, putting on my specific
hat in the university, we need
them. We need their support.
There's an awful lot of this insti
tution that depends on that kind
of support.
Would the Centennial Cam
paign accept money from uneth
ical corporations—corporations
with egregious environmental or
labor practices, for instance? Is

there any sort of ethical review
process?
We can't do that kind of re
search. We don't have access to
the kind of information that would
let us closely scrutinize the whole
range of the donor population of
this institution. I think that we
try to be as careful as we can if
there's something in the public
record that we're aware of.
The distinction I'm drawing is
that we don't go digging for po
tential problems. If there's some
thing that's readily apparent, we
will actively debate it in this in
stitution.
I assure you that we have had
instances in this institution where
we have turned down gifts of sup-

port because we thought it was
not in our guiding principles.
The majority of the examples
would fall in the category of donors
wanting to put restrictions on gifts,
wanting us to use it in very specific
ways that we don't feel comfort
able abiding by. We obviously have
had an open debate about divesti
ture around South African oper
ations over the last several years.
I think that's a good example of
where the institution, not this of
fice in particular but the institu
tion elsewhere, has looked at social
issues of importance.
I think that probably will ex
pand. 1 don't know what form it
will take and 1 think the Board
of Trustees and the Committee
on Investment Responsibility
(which is I think the right place
to house that kind of study) arc
considering further activities that
they might undertake.

You're asking questions in a grey
area, limited for the most part by
our lack of knowledge of a lot
these people. But again that's part
of my job, to keep my antennae
up and sense when there might
be something a little fishy. And
obviously 99.99 percent of the gifts
that are offered to this institution
are offered with no strings and
from very good people. So we don't
have to get into it very often, but
we need to be sensitive.
Are there times when simply
the ethics of a donor are in ques>
tion?
Sure. Some of these people
being indicted for Wall Street ac
tivities at the moment—that's a
very sensitive area. And I can tell
you that we have, unfortunately,
one Stanford alumnus who is un
der indictment. I am not going to
actively pursue a gift from that
person.
Quite honestly, I haven't gone
to look at his gift record to see
if we've received any gifts in the
past. We haven't received anything
major that I know of. But I'm not
going to go pursue a gift from him.
What will Stanford look like
when the Centennial Campaign
is over? How will all these major
changes effect the University,
particularly the undergraduate
experience here?
I hope that we will provide a
more solid financial underpin
ning—particularly for the School
of Humanities and Sciences, but
also for Engineering and Earth
Sciences. They will have more en
dowment there, they will have a
few more flexible funds and means
to create new programs and take
advantage of new interdisciplinary
opportunities.
1 hope the Centennial Chair
Professorship component of the
campaign is successful, so the
provost finds himself with 12 new
endowed chairs where we have
senior faculty teaching undergrad
uates as their primary mission.
And I certainly hope that we con
tinue to have the success we've
had with undergraduate scholar
ships and graduate fellowships, so
that anyone who wants to come
to this institution will have the
opportunity to do so.
A lot of the vitality that I've
seen here really stems from the
permeability of the boundaries of
schools and departments and the
opportunities that students have
to find a different kind of mix of
academic opportunity that comes
from different kinds of affiliations
and associations among professors.
If those kinds of new opportu
nities come out of this campaign,
I'll be absolutely delighted, but the
minute the campaign is over, the
next morning we're going to have
to get up and keep raising money
for this university.

It could be considered unnerv
ing having a tete-a-tete with some
one who regularly makes more
than $100,000 from his conversa
tion partners.
But if John Ford made people
nervous, he wouldn't be making
Stanford so much money.
As director of the Centennial
Campaign, Ford is raising $1.1 bil
lion dollars for the University.
For him, nothing could be more
natural.
He speaks the language of
money. He knows all its prefer
ences. He frequents its haunts.
His words rarely include num
bers, his manner is sympathetic
and his office demurs modestly.
Ford looms as a legend in the
fund-raising business. He's been
doing it all of his occupational life.
He started in 1973, two years
after graduating with a bachelor's
in history from Stanford. While
attending a master's program in
history and public administration
at the University of Southern Cal
ifornia, he plunged into full-time
development work for Cal Tech's
$130 million campaign.

He moved from Cal Tech to
climb the rungs in the University
of Chicago development office,
and then swung west back to Stan
ford.
Starting out in 1977 as Associ
ate Director of Medical Develop
ment, Ford has moved up through
the Stanford development office.
1 le was appointed to his current
post as Vice President for Devel
opment in 1988.
In this capacity he now con
ducts the most ambitious fund
raising campaign in the hißtory of
higher education.
The Weekly spoke with Ford to
hear his views on the Centennial
Campaign.
How do the Stanford commu
nity and the development office
interact to set the goals of the
Centennial Campaign?
Stanford has, to the best of my
knowledge, the best academic
process for identifying things that
faculty and students want to ac
complish and bringing those for
ward through their departments
to the provost. We have a group
that meets about once a
month—four representatives from
the development office and four

representatives from the provost's
office. We get together and talk
about those things that the provost
has determined to he important
academically and we talk about
the feasibility of raising money for
those projects.
So, it's a very grass-roots kind
of effort that culminates in a dis
cussion in the provost's office and
then with the development office.
That's how priorities are set. Ac
ademic programs are ranked into
four categories, and that deter
mines how much effort this office
can afford to put into pursuing
private support for those projects.
It's a very well-understood and
very well-organized process. As I
said, very few other institutions
have done it as well or as long.
The ASSU recently conducted
a poll that asked students where
they thought Centennial funds
ought to be allocated. How did
you respond to that poll?
Well, 1 was delighted to have
an opportunity to visit with some
of the student leaders who partic
ipated in bringing forth that poll
and its results. I think there were
a couple of comments. Number
one, a number of things in which

the students were interested were
embedded in the goals of the cam
paign. The problem is u>e (in the
development office) have to talk
more gencrically than specifically.
The students just didn't see the
specifics. The generics actually
covered some of the things in
which they were interested.
Then there were a few other
things in which the students were
interested for which I have great
sympathy, but the provost has
learned and we certainly have
learned by firsthand experience,
that you don't always attract dol
lars for everything you need. I
think there were some things that
we recognized early on were im
portant, but they weren't going to
come from private gift support.
The residences are a very good
example. This went all the way
back to 1961—we had an under
graduate residence component in
every one of our three fund-raising
campaigns. We hadn't raised a
ruckle as of this spring and we
weren't headed toward raising any
money in this campaign. So we
felt it best to defer and to focus
on some other activities.
Now, in the process of deferring,
it became such an urgent conver
sation among the trustees—and
the students clearly had a role in
stressing the urgency of the mat
ter — that the trustees came back
to us and to the provost and said,
"Is there any way we can play
with this and come up with a
project that maybe isn't as costly?"
In so doing, a couple of the trus
tees said, "We'll make the down
payment, we'll put up the first gift
money on this to get it going."
It's been a wonderful example of
how the institution can galvanize
around a project that clearly didn't
carry any outside interest for a
long period of time.
Why didn't undergraduate
housing carry outside interest?
Number one, the most difficult
dollars to raise in the last decade,
for any institution, have been dol
lars for facilities. Number two, res
idences are difficult to raise money
for because sophisticated donors
understand that there is an income
spring that supports residences—
that's your room and board. Num
ber three, in this institution, we
don't have the orientation around
the residences that exists at some
of our Ivy League counterparts.
We just haven't built up the tra

dition of investing in residences
and residential education.
Now we're obviously trying to
change that. But even in those
institutions that we talk to—and
we do keep close tabs on what
the Ivy League schools
do—they've had very little success
raising money for residences.
So, it was an uphill battle from
day one. And it wouldn't have
worked if the trustees hadn't
stepped forward. The message that
certainly can be carried back to
the students is that the trustees
listen to them.
How do internal events at
Stanford affect outsiders' percep
tions of the University?
A great deal. A great deal. Ob
viously. This last year or two has
been a tough year for us in the
media. Whether it's the Western
Culture debate or a change in the
Hoover leadership, or the spring
occupation of the President's Of
fice— all of those things have
immediate impact on the devel
opment operation and the cam
paign activity, primarily because
they become distractions. Rather
than talking to people about in
vesting in Stanford, we have to
talk a lot about these issues that
are getting the headlines.
But it is a part of our job. We
try to get beyond the headlines in
The Los Angeles Times or The
Wall Street Journal to explain
more of the subtleties or the real
facts of what's taking place.
That's where faculty and stu
dents come into play. We draw on
them. (Philosophy Prof.) John
Perry made a tour through South
ern California this spring, explain
ing the Cultures, Ideas and Values
program, which was very helpful.
We got very good attendance from
people who had been very critical
of the debate. We have students
in those situations, too.
But there's no doubt that cur
rent activities on campus do have
an impact. It certainly would help
us if students understood at times
that their actions have ramifica
tions on people who are providing
support that really docs help create
the milieu in which you attend
your classes.
Private support is obviously very
crucial to a private institution. I'm
not saying that the debate should
not take place: It should. It's very
healthy and I tell people all the
time: If there wasn't controversy

here, we wouldn't be doing our
job. I do think that it's important
to realize that what happens here
does have a ripple effect into the
outside world.
You probably received a couple
of phone calls after the occupa
tion?
More than a couple. Again, I
think it was a big job, it still is a
very big job, to explain the whole
UCMI report and all of the sur
rounding issues that certainly
played a part in that occupation.
And there are two sides to it.
There was perhaps a negative re
sponse because of the occupation.
But as you know, there was also
a negative response in the way
that the police were brought into
the settling of that occupation.
We have to play both sides of it.
It isn't only one-dimensional. It
isn't only the conservative seg
ments of our constituency that we
hear from.
Those kinds of issues arc going
to come up all the time. We expect
it, it's part of our job, and we're
happy to be ambassadors explain
ing what's going on.
Many undergraduates sec how
much money you're raising in
the Centennial Campaign and are
angry because it is still costing
them more each year to attend
school. How will the Centennial
campaign really help undergrad
uate education?
What we are doing will help
make undergraduate education
more accessible to more people.
The place I'd start is undergrad
uate scholarships. We have raised
more money as a percentage of
our very ambitious goal in the
undergraduate scholarship cate
gory to the point where we raised
the goal in February. So that in
and of itself helps those people
who are going to come here.
I think there are other ways in
which we arc helping to under
write the programs both on the
graduate and undergraduate levels
that will help the University han
dle the overall costs of the aca
demic program. But 1 can't tell
you that it will, in the end, cut
the costs. It will cut the increase
in cost. The cost is there, it's not
going to go down—it's a question
of how much it will continue to
increase. I'm sure that our success
will help determine the rate of
that increase. If we weren't raising
money, the rate would have to be
much greater.
Remember that we raise gifts in
two forms. We raise expendable
gifts, which help us right here and
now, when you're going to school.
But a lot of what we do is build
endowment, and that's a much
longer term process.
If you remember that if we
receive a gift of $100,000 to endow
a scholarship, in a given year, that

only gives us $4,750 to spend. So
you're not having a $100,000 im
pact next year. You're only have
a $4,750 impact on the institution.
But you're going to have it in
perpetuity. That's a big part of
our job, to stay focused on the
long term.
Although undergrads don't
think in the long term. They
need assistance now.
That's right. You've got a four
year window. I fully understand
why you stress in painful tones
some of the views you do. Just
remember that when I went
through here 20 years ago, the
percentage of disposable family in
come that went towards education
was the same. The raw dollar num
ber is considerably more and
driven by inflation. The percent
of family income that goes toward
education is still the same.
Let's turn to questions of eth
ics. History Prof. Barton
Bernstein recently criticized the
extent to which universities have
become entangled with large cor
porations for their funding. This
certainly is almost a defining
characteristic of the Centennial
campaign. Do you see any prob
lems in this situation?
There is a potential problem, if
you're not diligent in analyzing
those relationships and setting
boundaries that are appropriate.
But you can. Our faculty and this
institution have been cognizant of
those potential problems to the
point where there is the close scru
tiny that Prof. Bernstein and
others want. I would want to reas
sure him that his colleagues that
are involved in those relation
ships—faculty who arc running
the programs in which these cor
porations are interested—are very
cognizant of those boundaries.
My personal experience has
been that I've never seen a cor
poration that was dictating the
research that this institution was
going to pursue. I have not seen
a corporation keep a faculty mem
ber from publishing what he or
she wanted to. I have never seen
a corporation lock up graduate stu
dents in a way that was inappro
priate. I think that this institution
is sensitive to those kinds of issues.
But doesn't the preponderance
of corporate funding establish a
milieu—nothing conspiratorial,
but something perhaps deeper
and more significant?
1 think for the society as a
whole, it is healthy to have the
research universities talking with
corporations that will translate a
lot of what we do in a very fun
damental way (research, program
ming) into products and activities
that have an impact on society as
a whole. 1 think that's a gaxi

bridge. I think places like Stan
ford can demonstrate how it can
be done well. Particularly if we
conduct our business in the open,
so that you or Prof. Bernstein or
whoever can come by and see and
talk to and visit with the faculty
and the students who are talking
with these corporate representa
tives. I think it can be healthy for
society as a whole.
The contrast you might want
to draw is the way the Japanese
all lock up together—the govern
ment, the industry, the educa
tional institutions. You want to
talk about being an arm of some
body else! Quite honestly, we can't
even order that.
As a society, we are competing
in a much tougher world today,

and I think that if we do build
good, strong bridges between cor
porations and research univer
sities—bridges that everybody can
view—that will be good for all of
us.
The concern that you're ex
pressing is very appropriate and
we want to be vigilant, but at the
same time, I think there are ways
to go about it that would be terrific
for the institution.
Again, putting on my specific
hat in the university, we need
them. We need their support.
There's an awful lot of this insti
tution that depends on that kind
of support.
Would the Centennial Cam
paign accept money from uneth
ical corporations—corporations
with egregious environmental or
labor practices, for instance? Is

there any sort of ethical review
process?
We can't do that kind of re
search. We don't have access to
the kind of information that would

range of the donor population of
this institution. I think that we

I think that's a good example of
where the institution, not this of
fice in particular but the institu
tion elsewhere, has looked at social
issues of importance.
I think that probably will ex
pand. 1 don't know what form it
will take and 1 think the Board
of Trustees and the Committee
on Investment Responsibility
(which is I think the right place
to house that kind of study) arc
considering further activities that
they might undertake.

You're asking questions in a grey
area, limited for the most part by
our lack of knowledge of a lot
these people. But again that's part
of my job, to keep my antennae

obviously 99.99 percent of the gifts
that are offered to this institution
are offered with no strings and

we need to be sensitive.
Are there times when simply

The Weekly spoke with Ford to
hear his views on the Centennial
Campaign.
How do the Stanford commu
nity and the development office
interact to set the goals of the
Centennial Campaign?
Stanford has, to the best of my
knowledge, the best academic
process for identifying things that
faculty and students want to ac
complish and bringing those for
ward through their departments
to the provost. We have a group
that meets about once a
month—four representatives from
the development office and four

representatives from the provost's
office. We get together and talk
about those things that the provost
has determined to he important
academically and we talk about
the feasibility of raising money for
those projects.
So, it's a very grass-roots kind
of effort that culminates in a dis
cussion in the provost's office and
then with the development office.
That's how priorities are set. Ac
ademic programs are ranked into
four categories, and that deter
mines how much effort this office
can afford to put into pursuing
private support for those projects.
It's a very well-understood and
very well-organized process. As I
said, very few other institutions
have done it as well or as long.
The ASSU recently conducted
a poll that asked students where
they thought Centennial funds
ought to be allocated. How did

Well, 1 was delighted to have

learned by firsthand experience,
that you don't always attract dol
lars for everything you need. I
think there were some things that
we recognized early on were im
portant, but they weren't going to
come from private gift support.
The residences are a very good
example. This went all the way
back to 1961—we had an under
graduate residence component in
every one of our three fund-raising
campaigns. We hadn't raised a
ruckle as of this spring and we

felt it best to defer and to focus
on some other activities.
Now, in the process of deferring,
it became such an urgent conver

the students clearly had a role in
stressing the urgency of the mat

to us and to the provost and said,
"Is there any way we can play
with this and come up with a
project that maybe isn't as costly?"
In so doing, a couple of the trus
tees said, "We'll make the down
payment, we'll put up the first gift
money on this to get it going."
It's been a wonderful example of
how the institution can galvanize
around a project that clearly didn't
carry any outside interest for a
long period of time.
Why didn't undergraduate
housing carry outside interest?
Number one, the most difficult
dollars to raise in the last decade,

for because sophisticated donors
understand that there is an income

Now we're obviously trying to
change that. But even in those
institutions that we talk to—and
we do keep close tabs on what
the Ivy League schools
do—they've had very little success
raising money for residences.
So, it was an uphill battle from
day one. And it wouldn't have
worked if the trustees hadn't
stepped forward. The message that
certainly can be carried back to
the students is that the trustees
listen to them.
How do internal events at

A great deal. A great deal. Ob
viously. This last year or two has
been a tough year for us in the

Culture debate or a change in the
Hoover leadership, or the spring
occupation of the President's Of

immediate impact on the devel

they become distractions. Rather
than talking to people about in

But it is a part of our job. We
try to get beyond the headlines in
The Los Angeles Times or The

That's where faculty and stu

them. (Philosophy Prof.) John

ing the Cultures, Ideas and Values
program, which was very helpful.
We got very good attendance from
people who had been very critical

But there's no doubt that cur

an impact. It certainly would help
us if students understood at times
that their actions have ramifica
tions on people who are providing
support that really docs help create
the milieu in which you attend
your classes.
Private support is obviously very
crucial to a private institution. I'm
not saying that the debate should
not take place: It should. It's very
healthy and I tell people all the
time: If there wasn't controversy

here, we wouldn't be doing our
job. I do think that it's important
to realize that what happens here
does have a ripple effect into the
outside world.
You probably received a couple
of phone calls after the occupa
tion?
More than a couple. Again, I
think it was a big job, it still is a
very big job, to explain the whole
UCMI report and all of the sur
rounding issues that certainly
played a part in that occupation.
And there are two sides to it.
There was perhaps a negative re
sponse because of the occupation.
But as you know, there was also
a negative response in the way
that the police were brought into
the settling of that occupation.
We have to play both sides of it.
It isn't only one-dimensional. It
isn't only the conservative seg
ments of our constituency that we
hear from.
Those kinds of issues arc going
to come up all the time. We expect
it, it's part of our job, and we're
happy to be ambassadors explain
ing what's going on.
Many undergraduates sec how
much money you're raising in
the Centennial Campaign and are
angry because it is still costing
them more each year to attend
school. How will the Centennial
campaign really help undergrad
uate education?
What we are doing will help
make undergraduate education
more accessible to more people.
The place I'd start is undergrad
uate scholarships. We have raised
more money as a percentage of
our very ambitious goal in the
undergraduate scholarship cate
gory to the point where we raised
the goal in February. So that in
and of itself helps those people
who are going to come here.
I think there are other ways in
which we arc helping to under
write the programs both on the
graduate and undergraduate levels
that will help the University han
dle the overall costs of the aca
demic program. But 1 can't tell
you that it will, in the end, cut
the costs. It will cut the increase
in cost. The cost is there, it's not
going to go down—it's a question
of how much it will continue to
increase. I'm sure that our success
will help determine the rate of
that increase. If we weren't raising
money, the rate would have to be
much greater.
Remember that we raise gifts in
two forms. We raise expendable
gifts, which help us right here and
now, when you're going to school.
But a lot of what we do is build
endowment, and that's a much
longer term process.
If you remember that if we
receive a gift of $100,000 to endow
a scholarship, in a given year, that

only gives us $4,750 to spend. So
you're not having a $100,000 im
pact next year. You're only have
a $4,750 impact on the institution.
But you're going to have it in
perpetuity. That's a big part of
our job, to stay focused on the
long term.
Although undergrads don't
think in the long term. They
need assistance now.
That's right. You've got a four
year window. I fully understand
why you stress in painful tones
some of the views you do. Just
remember that when I went
through here 20 years ago, the
percentage of disposable family in
come that went towards education
was the same. The raw dollar num
ber is considerably more and
driven by inflation. The percent
of family income that goes toward
education is still the same.
Let's turn to questions of eth
ics. History Prof. Barton
Bernstein recently criticized the
extent to which universities have
become entangled with large cor
porations for their funding. This
certainly is almost a defining
characteristic of the Centennial
campaign. Do you see any prob
lems in this situation?
There is a potential problem, if
you're not diligent in analyzing
those relationships and setting
boundaries that are appropriate.
But you can. Our faculty and this
institution have been cognizant of
those potential problems to the
point where there is the close scru
tiny that Prof. Bernstein and
others want. I would want to reas
sure him that his colleagues that
are involved in those relation
ships—faculty who arc running
the programs in which these cor
porations are interested—are very
cognizant of those boundaries.
My personal experience has
been that I've never seen a cor
poration that was dictating the
research that this institution was
going to pursue. I have not seen
a corporation keep a faculty mem
ber from publishing what he or
she wanted to. I have never seen
a corporation lock up graduate stu
dents in a way that was inappro
priate. I think that this institution
is sensitive to those kinds of issues.
But doesn't the preponderance
of corporate funding establish a
milieu—nothing conspiratorial,
but something perhaps deeper
and more significant?
1 think for the society as a
whole, it is healthy to have the
research universities talking with
corporations that will translate a
lot of what we do in a very fun
damental way (research, program
ming) into products and activities
that have an impact on society as
a whole. 1 think that's a gaxi

bridge. I think places like Stan
ford can demonstrate how it can
be done well. Particularly if we
conduct our business in the open,
so that you or Prof. Bernstein or
whoever can come by and see and
talk to and visit with the faculty
and the students who are talking
with these corporate representa
tives. I think it can be healthy for
society as a whole.
The contrast you might want
to draw is the way the Japanese
all lock up together—the govern
ment, the industry, the educa
tional institutions. You want to
talk about being an arm of some
body else! Quite honestly, we can't
even order that.
As a society, we are competing
in a much tougher world today,

and I think that if we do build
good, strong bridges between cor
porations and research univer
sities—bridges that everybody can
view—that will be good for all of
us.
The concern that you're ex
pressing is very appropriate and
we want to be vigilant, but at the
same time, I think there are ways
to go about it that would be terrific
for the institution.
Again, putting on my specific
hat in the university, we need
them. We need their support.
There's an awful lot of this insti
tution that depends on that kind
of support.
Would the Centennial Cam
paign accept money from uneth
ical corporations—corporations
with egregious environmental or
labor practices, for instance? Is

there any sort of ethical review
process?
We can't do that kind of re
search. We don't have access to
the kind of information that would
let us closely scrutinize the whole
range of the donor population of
this institution. I think that we
try to be as careful as we can if
there's something in the public
record that we're aware of.
The distinction I'm drawing is
that we don't go digging for po
tential problems. If there's some
thing that's readily apparent, we
will actively debate it in this in
stitution.
I assure you that we have had
instances in this institution where
we have turned down gifts of sup-

port because we thought it was
not in our guiding principles.
The majority of the examples
would fall in the category of donors
wanting to put restrictions on gifts,
wanting us to use it in very specific
ways that we don't feel comfort
able abiding by. We obviously have
had an open debate about divesti
ture around South African oper
ations over the last several years.
I think that's a good example of
where the institution, not this of
fice in particular but the institu
tion elsewhere, has looked at social
issues of importance.
I think that probably will ex
pand. 1 don't know what form it
will take and 1 think the Board
of Trustees and the Committee
on Investment Responsibility
(which is I think the right place
to house that kind of study) arc
considering further activities that
they might undertake.

You're asking questions in a grey
area, limited for the most part by
our lack of knowledge of a lot
these people. But again that's part
of my job, to keep my antennae
up and sense when there might
be something a little fishy. And
obviously 99.99 percent of the gifts
that are offered to this institution
are offered with no strings and
from very good people. So we don't
have to get into it very often, but
we need to be sensitive.
Are there times when simply
the ethics of a donor are in ques>
tion?
Sure. Some of these people
being indicted for Wall Street ac
tivities at the moment—that's a
very sensitive area. And I can tell
you that we have, unfortunately,
one Stanford alumnus who is un
der indictment. I am not going to
actively pursue a gift from that
person.
Quite honestly, I haven't gone
to look at his gift record to see
if we've received any gifts in the
past. We haven't received anything
major that I know of. But I'm not
going to go pursue a gift from him.
What will Stanford look like
when the Centennial Campaign
is over? How will all these major
changes effect the University,
particularly the undergraduate
experience here?
I hope that we will provide a
more solid financial underpin
ning—particularly for the School
of Humanities and Sciences, but
also for Engineering and Earth
Sciences. They will have more en
dowment there, they will have a
few more flexible funds and means
to create new programs and take
advantage of new interdisciplinary
opportunities.
1 hope the Centennial Chair
Professorship component of the
campaign is successful, so the
provost finds himself with 12 new
endowed chairs where we have
senior faculty teaching undergrad
uates as their primary mission.
And I certainly hope that we con
tinue to have the success we've
had with undergraduate scholar
ships and graduate fellowships, so
that anyone who wants to come
to this institution will have the
opportunity to do so.
A lot of the vitality that I've
seen here really stems from the
permeability of the boundaries of
schools and departments and the
opportunities that students have
to find a different kind of mix of
academic opportunity that comes
from different kinds of affiliations
and associations among professors.
If those kinds of new opportu
nities come out of this campaign,
I'll be absolutely delighted, but the
minute the campaign is over, the
next morning we're going to have
to get up and keep raising money
for this university.

It could be considered unnerv
ing having a tete-a-tete with some
one who regularly makes more
than $100,000 from his conversa
tion partners.
But if John Ford made people
nervous, he wouldn't be making
Stanford so much money.
As director of the Centennial
Campaign, Ford is raising $1.1 bil
lion dollars for the University.
For him, nothing could be more
natural.
He speaks the language of
money. He knows all its prefer
ences. He frequents its haunts.
His words rarely include num
bers, his manner is sympathetic
and his office demurs modestly.
Ford looms as a legend in the
fund-raising business. He's been
doing it all of his occupational life.
He started in 1973, two years
after graduating with a bachelor's
in history from Stanford. While
attending a master's program in
history and public administration
at the University of Southern Cal
ifornia, he plunged into full-time
development work for Cal Tech's
$130 million campaign.

He moved from Cal Tech to
climb the rungs in the University
of Chicago development office,
and then swung west back to Stan
ford.
Starting out in 1977 as Associ
ate Director of Medical Develop
ment, Ford has moved up through
the Stanford development office.
1 le was appointed to his current
post as Vice President for Devel
opment in 1988.
In this capacity he now con
ducts the most ambitious fund
raising campaign in the hißtory of
higher education.
The Weekly spoke with Ford to
hear his views on the Centennial
Campaign.
How do the Stanford commu
nity and the development office
interact to set the goals of the
Centennial Campaign?
Stanford has, to the best of my
knowledge, the best academic
process for identifying things that
faculty and students want to ac
complish and bringing those for
ward through their departments
to the provost. We have a group
that meets about once a
month—four representatives from
the development office and four

representatives from the provost's
office. We get together and talk
about those things that the provost
has determined to he important
academically and we talk about
the feasibility of raising money for
those projects.
So, it's a very grass-roots kind
of effort that culminates in a dis
cussion in the provost's office and
then with the development office.
That's how priorities are set. Ac
ademic programs are ranked into
four categories, and that deter
mines how much effort this office
can afford to put into pursuing
private support for those projects.
It's a very well-understood and
very well-organized process. As I
said, very few other institutions
have done it as well or as long.
The ASSU recently conducted
a poll that asked students where
they thought Centennial funds
ought to be allocated. How did
you respond to that poll?
Well, 1 was delighted to have
an opportunity to visit with some
of the student leaders who partic
ipated in bringing forth that poll
and its results. I think there were
a couple of comments. Number
one, a number of things in which

the students were interested were
embedded in the goals of the cam
paign. The problem is u>e (in the
development office) have to talk
more gencrically than specifically.
The students just didn't see the
specifics. The generics actually
covered some of the things in
which they were interested.
Then there were a few other
things in which the students were
interested for which I have great
sympathy, but the provost has
learned and we certainly have
learned by firsthand experience,
that you don't always attract dol
lars for everything you need. I
think there were some things that
we recognized early on were im
portant, but they weren't going to
come from private gift support.
The residences are a very good
example. This went all the way
back to 1961—we had an under
graduate residence component in
every one of our three fund-raising
campaigns. We hadn't raised a
ruckle as of this spring and we
weren't headed toward raising any
money in this campaign. So we
felt it best to defer and to focus
on some other activities.
Now, in the process of deferring,
it became such an urgent conver
sation among the trustees—and
the students clearly had a role in
stressing the urgency of the mat
ter — that the trustees came back
to us and to the provost and said,
"Is there any way we can play
with this and come up with a
project that maybe isn't as costly?"
In so doing, a couple of the trus
tees said, "We'll make the down
payment, we'll put up the first gift
money on this to get it going."
It's been a wonderful example of
how the institution can galvanize
around a project that clearly didn't
carry any outside interest for a
long period of time.
Why didn't undergraduate
housing carry outside interest?
Number one, the most difficult
dollars to raise in the last decade,
for any institution, have been dol
lars for facilities. Number two, res
idences are difficult to raise money
for because sophisticated donors
understand that there is an income
spring that supports residences—
that's your room and board. Num
ber three, in this institution, we
don't have the orientation around
the residences that exists at some
of our Ivy League counterparts.
We just haven't built up the tra

dition of investing in residences
and residential education.
Now we're obviously trying to
change that. But even in those
institutions that we talk to—and
we do keep close tabs on what
the Ivy League schools
do—they've had very little success
raising money for residences.
So, it was an uphill battle from
day one. And it wouldn't have
worked if the trustees hadn't
stepped forward. The message that
certainly can be carried back to
the students is that the trustees
listen to them.
How do internal events at
Stanford affect outsiders' percep
tions of the University?
A great deal. A great deal. Ob
viously. This last year or two has
been a tough year for us in the
media. Whether it's the Western
Culture debate or a change in the
Hoover leadership, or the spring
occupation of the President's Of
fice— all of those things have
immediate impact on the devel
opment operation and the cam
paign activity, primarily because
they become distractions. Rather
than talking to people about in
vesting in Stanford, we have to
talk a lot about these issues that
are getting the headlines.
But it is a part of our job. We
try to get beyond the headlines in
The Los Angeles Times or The
Wall Street Journal to explain
more of the subtleties or the real
facts of what's taking place.
That's where faculty and stu
dents come into play. We draw on
them. (Philosophy Prof.) John
Perry made a tour through South
ern California this spring, explain
ing the Cultures, Ideas and Values
program, which was very helpful.
We got very good attendance from
people who had been very critical
of the debate. We have students
in those situations, too.
But there's no doubt that cur
rent activities on campus do have
an impact. It certainly would help
us if students understood at times
that their actions have ramifica
tions on people who are providing
support that really docs help create
the milieu in which you attend
your classes.
Private support is obviously very
crucial to a private institution. I'm
not saying that the debate should
not take place: It should. It's very
healthy and I tell people all the
time: If there wasn't controversy

here, we wouldn't be doing our
job. I do think that it's important
to realize that what happens here
does have a ripple effect into the
outside world.
You probably received a couple
of phone calls after the occupa
tion?
More than a couple. Again, I
think it was a big job, it still is a
very big job, to explain the whole
UCMI report and all of the sur
rounding issues that certainly
played a part in that occupation.
And there are two sides to it.
There was perhaps a negative re
sponse because of the occupation.
But as you know, there was also
a negative response in the way
that the police were brought into
the settling of that occupation.
We have to play both sides of it.
It isn't only one-dimensional. It
isn't only the conservative seg
ments of our constituency that we
hear from.
Those kinds of issues arc going
to come up all the time. We expect
it, it's part of our job, and we're
happy to be ambassadors explain
ing what's going on.
Many undergraduates sec how
much money you're raising in
the Centennial Campaign and are
angry because it is still costing
them more each year to attend
school. How will the Centennial
campaign really help undergrad
uate education?
What we are doing will help
make undergraduate education
more accessible to more people.
The place I'd start is undergrad
uate scholarships. We have raised
more money as a percentage of
our very ambitious goal in the
undergraduate scholarship cate
gory to the point where we raised
the goal in February. So that in
and of itself helps those people
who are going to come here.
I think there are other ways in
which we arc helping to under
write the programs both on the
graduate and undergraduate levels
that will help the University han
dle the overall costs of the aca
demic program. But 1 can't tell
you that it will, in the end, cut
the costs. It will cut the increase
in cost. The cost is there, it's not
going to go down—it's a question
of how much it will continue to
increase. I'm sure that our success
will help determine the rate of
that increase. If we weren't raising
money, the rate would have to be
much greater.
Remember that we raise gifts in
two forms. We raise expendable
gifts, which help us right here and
now, when you're going to school.
But a lot of what we do is build
endowment, and that's a much
longer term process.
If you remember that if we
receive a gift of $100,000 to endow
a scholarship, in a given year, that

only gives us $4,750 to spend. So
you're not having a $100,000 im
pact next year. You're only have
a $4,750 impact on the institution.
But you're going to have it in
perpetuity. That's a big part of
our job, to stay focused on the
long term.
Although undergrads don't
think in the long term. They
need assistance now.
That's right. You've got a four
year window. I fully understand
why you stress in painful tones
some of the views you do. Just
remember that when I went
through here 20 years ago, the
percentage of disposable family in
come that went towards education
was the same. The raw dollar num
ber is considerably more and
driven by inflation. The percent
of family income that goes toward
education is still the same.
Let's turn to questions of eth
ics. History Prof. Barton
Bernstein recently criticized the
extent to which universities have
become entangled with large cor
porations for their funding. This
certainly is almost a defining
characteristic of the Centennial
campaign. Do you see any prob
lems in this situation?
There is a potential problem, if
you're not diligent in analyzing
those relationships and setting
boundaries that are appropriate.
But you can. Our faculty and this
institution have been cognizant of
those potential problems to the
point where there is the close scru
tiny that Prof. Bernstein and
others want. I would want to reas
sure him that his colleagues that
are involved in those relation
ships—faculty who arc running
the programs in which these cor
porations are interested—are very
cognizant of those boundaries.
My personal experience has
been that I've never seen a cor
poration that was dictating the
research that this institution was
going to pursue. I have not seen
a corporation keep a faculty mem
ber from publishing what he or

dents in a way that was inappro
priate. I think that this institution
is sensitive to those kinds of issues.
But doesn't the preponderance
of corporate funding establish a
milieu—nothing conspiratorial,
but something perhaps deeper
and more significant?
1 think for the society as a
whole, it is healthy to have the
research universities talking with
corporations that will translate a
lot of what we do in a very fun
damental way (research, program
ming) into products and activities
that have an impact on society as
a whole. 1 think that's a gaxi

bridge. I think places like Stan
ford can demonstrate how it can
be done well. Particularly if we
conduct our business in the open,
so that you or Prof. Bernstein or
whoever can come by and see and
talk to and visit with the faculty
and the students who are talking
with these corporate representa
tives. I think it can be healthy for
society as a whole.
The contrast you might want
to draw is the way the Japanese
all lock up together—the govern
ment, the industry, the educa
tional institutions. You want to
talk about being an arm of some
body else! Quite honestly, we can't
even order that.
As a society, we are competing
in a much tougher world today,

and I think that if we do build
good, strong bridges between cor
porations and research univer
sities—bridges that everybody can
view—that will be good for all of
us.
The concern that you're ex
pressing is very appropriate and
we want to be vigilant, but at the
same time, I think there are ways
to go about it that would be terrific
for the institution.
Again, putting on my specific
hat in the university, we need
them. We need their support.
There's an awful lot of this insti

Would the Centennial Cam

(which is I think the right place
to house that kind of study) arc
considering further activities that

Stanford has, to the best of my
knowledge, the best academic
process for identifying things that
faculty and students want to ac
complish and bringing those for
ward through their departments
to the provost. We have a group
that meets about once a
month—four representatives from
the development office and four

representatives from the provost's
office. We get together and talk
about those things that the provost
has determined to he important
academically and we talk about
the feasibility of raising money for
those projects.
So, it's a very grass-roots kind
of effort that culminates in a dis
cussion in the provost's office and
then with the development office.
That's how priorities are set. Ac
ademic programs are ranked into
four categories, and that deter
mines how much effort this office
can afford to put into pursuing
private support for those projects.
It's a very well-understood and
very well-organized process. As I
said, very few other institutions
have done it as well or as long.
The ASSU recently conducted
a poll that asked students where
they thought Centennial funds
ought to be allocated. How did
you respond to that poll?
Well, 1 was delighted to have
an opportunity to visit with some
of the student leaders who partic
ipated in bringing forth that poll
and its results. I think there were
a couple of comments. Number
one, a number of things in which

the students were interested were
embedded in the goals of the cam
paign. The problem is u>e (in the
development office) have to talk
more gencrically than specifically.
The students just didn't see the
specifics. The generics actually
covered some of the things in
which they were interested.
Then there were a few other
things in which the students were
interested for which I have great
sympathy, but the provost has
learned and we certainly have
learned by firsthand experience,
that you don't always attract dol
lars for everything you need. I
think there were some things that
we recognized early on were im
portant, but they weren't going to
come from private gift support.
The residences are a very good
example. This went all the way
back to 1961—we had an under
graduate residence component in
every one of our three fund-raising
campaigns. We hadn't raised a
ruckle as of this spring and we
weren't headed toward raising any
money in this campaign. So we
felt it best to defer and to focus
on some other activities.
Now, in the process of deferring,
it became such an urgent conver
sation among the trustees—and
the students clearly had a role in
stressing the urgency of the mat
ter — that the trustees came back
to us and to the provost and said,
"Is there any way we can play
with this and come up with a
project that maybe isn't as costly?"
In so doing, a couple of the trus
tees said, "We'll make the down
payment, we'll put up the first gift
money on this to get it going."
It's been a wonderful example of
how the institution can galvanize
around a project that clearly didn't
carry any outside interest for a
long period of time.
Why didn't undergraduate
housing carry outside interest?
Number one, the most difficult
dollars to raise in the last decade,
for any institution, have been dol
lars for facilities. Number two, res
idences are difficult to raise money
for because sophisticated donors
understand that there is an income
spring that supports residences—
that's your room and board. Num
ber three, in this institution, we
don't have the orientation around
the residences that exists at some
of our Ivy League counterparts.
We just haven't built up the tra

dition of investing in residences
and residential education.
Now we're obviously trying to
change that. But even in those
institutions that we talk to—and
we do keep close tabs on what
the Ivy League schools
do—they've had very little success
raising money for residences.
So, it was an uphill battle from
day one. And it wouldn't have
worked if the trustees hadn't
stepped forward. The message that
certainly can be carried back to
the students is that the trustees
listen to them.
How do internal events at
Stanford affect outsiders' percep
tions of the University?
A great deal. A great deal. Ob
viously. This last year or two has
been a tough year for us in the
media. Whether it's the Western
Culture debate or a change in the
Hoover leadership, or the spring
occupation of the President's Of
fice— all of those things have
immediate impact on the devel
opment operation and the cam
paign activity, primarily because
they become distractions. Rather
than talking to people about in
vesting in Stanford, we have to
talk a lot about these issues that
are getting the headlines.
But it is a part of our job. We
try to get beyond the headlines in
The Los Angeles Times or The
Wall Street Journal to explain
more of the subtleties or the real
facts of what's taking place.
That's where faculty and stu
dents come into play. We draw on
them. (Philosophy Prof.) John
Perry made a tour through South
ern California this spring, explain
ing the Cultures, Ideas and Values
program, which was very helpful.
We got very good attendance from
people who had been very critical
of the debate. We have students
in those situations, too.
But there's no doubt that cur
rent activities on campus do have
an impact. It certainly would help
us if students understood at times
that their actions have ramifica
tions on people who are providing
support that really docs help create
the milieu in which you attend
your classes.
Private support is obviously very
crucial to a private institution. I'm
not saying that the debate should
not take place: It should. It's very
healthy and I tell people all the
time: If there wasn't controversy

here, we wouldn't be doing our
job. I do think that it's important
to realize that what happens here
does have a ripple effect into the
outside world.
You probably received a couple
of phone calls after the occupa
tion?
More than a couple. Again, I
think it was a big job, it still is a
very big job, to explain the whole
UCMI report and all of the sur
rounding issues that certainly
played a part in that occupation.
And there are two sides to it.
There was perhaps a negative re
sponse because of the occupation.
But as you know, there was also
a negative response in the way
that the police were brought into
the settling of that occupation.
We have to play both sides of it.
It isn't only one-dimensional. It
isn't only the conservative seg
ments of our constituency that we
hear from.
Those kinds of issues arc going
to come up all the time. We expect
it, it's part of our job, and we're
happy to be ambassadors explain
ing what's going on.
Many undergraduates sec how
much money you're raising in
the Centennial Campaign and are
angry because it is still costing
them more each year to attend
school. How will the Centennial
campaign really help undergrad
uate education?
What we are doing will help
make undergraduate education
more accessible to more people.
The place I'd start is undergrad
uate scholarships. We have raised
more money as a percentage of
our very ambitious goal in the
undergraduate scholarship cate
gory to the point where we raised
the goal in February. So that in
and of itself helps those people
who are going to come here.
I think there are other ways in
which we arc helping to under
write the programs both on the
graduate and undergraduate levels
that will help the University han
dle the overall costs of the aca
demic program. But 1 can't tell
you that it will, in the end, cut
the costs. It will cut the increase
in cost. The cost is there, it's not
going to go down—it's a question
of how much it will continue to
increase. I'm sure that our success
will help determine the rate of
that increase. If we weren't raising
money, the rate would have to be
much greater.
Remember that we raise gifts in
two forms. We raise expendable
gifts, which help us right here and
now, when you're going to school.
But a lot of what we do is build
endowment, and that's a much
longer term process.
If you remember that if we
receive a gift of $100,000 to endow
a scholarship, in a given year, that

only gives us $4,750 to spend. So
you're not having a $100,000 im
pact next year. You're only have
a $4,750 impact on the institution.
But you're going to have it in
perpetuity. That's a big part of
our job, to stay focused on the
long term.
Although undergrads don't
think in the long term. They
need assistance now.
That's right. You've got a four
year window. I fully understand
why you stress in painful tones
some of the views you do. Just
remember that when I went
through here 20 years ago, the
percentage of disposable family in
come that went towards education
was the same. The raw dollar num
ber is considerably more and
driven by inflation. The percent
of family income that goes toward
education is still the same.
Let's turn to questions of eth
ics. History Prof. Barton
Bernstein recently criticized the
extent to which universities have
become entangled with large cor
porations for their funding. This
certainly is almost a defining
characteristic of the Centennial
campaign. Do you see any prob
lems in this situation?
There is a potential problem, if
you're not diligent in analyzing
those relationships and setting
boundaries that are appropriate.
But you can. Our faculty and this
institution have been cognizant of
those potential problems to the
point where there is the close scru
tiny that Prof. Bernstein and
others want. I would want to reas
sure him that his colleagues that
are involved in those relation
ships—faculty who arc running
the programs in which these cor
porations are interested—are very
cognizant of those boundaries.
My personal experience has
been that I've never seen a cor
poration that was dictating the
research that this institution was
going to pursue. I have not seen
a corporation keep a faculty mem
ber from publishing what he or
she wanted to. I have never seen
a corporation lock up graduate stu
dents in a way that was inappro
priate. I think that this institution
is sensitive to those kinds of issues.
But doesn't the preponderance
of corporate funding establish a
milieu—nothing conspiratorial,
but something perhaps deeper
and more significant?
1 think for the society as a
whole, it is healthy to have the
research universities talking with
corporations that will translate a
lot of what we do in a very fun
damental way (research, program
ming) into products and activities
that have an impact on society as
a whole. 1 think that's a gaxi

bridge. I think places like Stan
ford can demonstrate how it can
be done well. Particularly if we
conduct our business in the open,
so that you or Prof. Bernstein or
whoever can come by and see and
talk to and visit with the faculty
and the students who are talking
with these corporate representa
tives. I think it can be healthy for
society as a whole.
The contrast you might want
to draw is the way the Japanese
all lock up together—the govern
ment, the industry, the educa
tional institutions. You want to
talk about being an arm of some
body else! Quite honestly, we can't
even order that.
As a society, we are competing
in a much tougher world today,

and I think that if we do build
good, strong bridges between cor
porations and research univer
sities—bridges that everybody can
view—that will be good for all of
us.
The concern that you're ex
pressing is very appropriate and
we want to be vigilant, but at the
same time, I think there are ways
to go about it that would be terrific
for the institution.
Again, putting on my specific
hat in the university, we need
them. We need their support.
There's an awful lot of this insti
tution that depends on that kind
of support.
Would the Centennial Cam
paign accept money from uneth
ical corporations—corporations
with egregious environmental or
labor practices, for instance? Is

there any sort of ethical review
process?
We can't do that kind of re
search. We don't have access to
the kind of information that would
let us closely scrutinize the whole
range of the donor population of
this institution. I think that we
try to be as careful as we can if
there's something in the public
record that we're aware of.
The distinction I'm drawing is
that we don't go digging for po
tential problems. If there's some
thing that's readily apparent, we
will actively debate it in this in
stitution.
I assure you that we have had
instances in this institution where
we have turned down gifts of sup-

port because we thought it was
not in our guiding principles.
The majority of the examples
would fall in the category of donors
wanting to put restrictions on gifts,
wanting us to use it in very specific
ways that we don't feel comfort
able abiding by. We obviously have
had an open debate about divesti
ture around South African oper
ations over the last several years.
I think that's a good example of
where the institution, not this of
fice in particular but the institu
tion elsewhere, has looked at social
issues of importance.
I think that probably will ex
pand. 1 don't know what form it
will take and 1 think the Board
of Trustees and the Committee
on Investment Responsibility
(which is I think the right place
to house that kind of study) arc
considering further activities that
they might undertake.

You're asking questions in a grey
area, limited for the most part by
our lack of knowledge of a lot
these people. But again that's part
of my job, to keep my antennae
up and sense when there might
be something a little fishy. And
obviously 99.99 percent of the gifts
that are offered to this institution
are offered with no strings and
from very good people. So we don't
have to get into it very often, but
we need to be sensitive.
Are there times when simply
the ethics of a donor are in ques>
tion?
Sure. Some of these people
being indicted for Wall Street ac
tivities at the moment—that's a
very sensitive area. And I can tell
you that we have, unfortunately,
one Stanford alumnus who is un
der indictment. I am not going to
actively pursue a gift from that
person.
Quite honestly, I haven't gone
to look at his gift record to see
if we've received any gifts in the
past. We haven't received anything
major that I know of. But I'm not
going to go pursue a gift from him.
What will Stanford look like
when the Centennial Campaign
is over? How will all these major
changes effect the University,
particularly the undergraduate
experience here?
I hope that we will provide a
more solid financial underpin
ning—particularly for the School
of Humanities and Sciences, but
also for Engineering and Earth
Sciences. They will have more en
dowment there, they will have a
few more flexible funds and means
to create new programs and take
advantage of new interdisciplinary
opportunities.
1 hope the Centennial Chair
Professorship component of the
campaign is successful, so the
provost finds himself with 12 new
endowed chairs where we have
senior faculty teaching undergrad
uates as their primary mission.
And I certainly hope that we con
tinue to have the success we've
had with undergraduate scholar
ships and graduate fellowships, so
that anyone who wants to come
to this institution will have the
opportunity to do so.
A lot of the vitality that I've
seen here really stems from the
permeability of the boundaries of
schools and departments and the
opportunities that students have
to find a different kind of mix of
academic opportunity that comes
from different kinds of affiliations
and associations among professors.
If those kinds of new opportu
nities come out of this campaign,
I'll be absolutely delighted, but the
minute the campaign is over, the
next morning we're going to have
to get up and keep raising money
for this university.

It could be considered unnerv
ing having a tete-a-tete with some
one who regularly makes more
than $100,000 from his conversa
tion partners.
But if John Ford made people
nervous, he wouldn't be making
Stanford so much money.
As director of the Centennial
Campaign, Ford is raising $1.1 bil
lion dollars for the University.
For him, nothing could be more
natural.
He speaks the language of
money. He knows all its prefer
ences. He frequents its haunts.
His words rarely include num
bers, his manner is sympathetic
and his office demurs modestly.
Ford looms as a legend in the
fund-raising business. He's been
doing it all of his occupational life.
He started in 1973, two years
after graduating with a bachelor's
in history from Stanford. While
attending a master's program in
history and public administration
at the University of Southern Cal
ifornia, he plunged into full-time
development work for Cal Tech's
$130 million campaign.

He moved from Cal Tech to
climb the rungs in the University
of Chicago development office,
and then swung west back to Stan
ford.
Starting out in 1977 as Associ
ate Director of Medical Develop
ment, Ford has moved up through
the Stanford development office.
1 le was appointed to his current
post as Vice President for Devel
opment in 1988.
In this capacity he now con
ducts the most ambitious fund
raising campaign in the hißtory of
higher education.
The Weekly spoke with Ford to
hear his views on the Centennial
Campaign.
How do the Stanford commu
nity and the development office
interact to set the goals of the
Centennial Campaign?
Stanford has, to the best of my
knowledge, the best academic
process for identifying things that
faculty and students want to ac
complish and bringing those for
ward through their departments
to the provost. We have a group
that meets about once a
month—four representatives from
the development office and four

representatives from the provost's
office. We get together and talk
about those things that the provost
has determined to he important
academically and we talk about
the feasibility of raising money for
those projects.
So, it's a very grass-roots kind
of effort that culminates in a dis
cussion in the provost's office and
then with the development office.
That's how priorities are set. Ac
ademic programs are ranked into
four categories, and that deter
mines how much effort this office
can afford to put into pursuing
private support for those projects.
It's a very well-understood and
very well-organized process. As I
said, very few other institutions
have done it as well or as long.
The ASSU recently conducted
a poll that asked students where
they thought Centennial funds
ought to be allocated. How did
you respond to that poll?
Well, 1 was delighted to have
an opportunity to visit with some
of the student leaders who partic
ipated in bringing forth that poll
and its results. I think there were
a couple of comments. Number
one, a number of things in which

the students were interested were
embedded in the goals of the cam
paign. The problem is u>e (in the
development office) have to talk
more gencrically than specifically.
The students just didn't see the
specifics. The generics actually
covered some of the things in
which they were interested.
Then there were a few other
things in which the students were
interested for which I have great
sympathy, but the provost has
learned and we certainly have
learned by firsthand experience,
that you don't always attract dol
lars for everything you need. I
think there were some things that
we recognized early on were im
portant, but they weren't going to
come from private gift support.
The residences are a very good
example. This went all the way
back to 1961—we had an under
graduate residence component in
every one of our three fund-raising
campaigns. We hadn't raised a
ruckle as of this spring and we
weren't headed toward raising any
money in this campaign. So we
felt it best to defer and to focus
on some other activities.
Now, in the process of deferring,
it became such an urgent conver
sation among the trustees—and
the students clearly had a role in
stressing the urgency of the mat
ter — that the trustees came back
to us and to the provost and said,
"Is there any way we can play
with this and come up with a
project that maybe isn't as costly?"
In so doing, a couple of the trus
tees said, "We'll make the down
payment, we'll put up the first gift
money on this to get it going."
It's been a wonderful example of
how the institution can galvanize
around a project that clearly didn't
carry any outside interest for a
long period of time.
Why didn't undergraduate
housing carry outside interest?
Number one, the most difficult
dollars to raise in the last decade,
for any institution, have been dol
lars for facilities. Number two, res
idences are difficult to raise money
for because sophisticated donors
understand that there is an income
spring that supports residences—
that's your room and board. Num
ber three, in this institution, we
don't have the orientation around
the residences that exists at some
of our Ivy League counterparts.
We just haven't built up the tra

dition of investing in residences
and residential education.
Now we're obviously trying to
change that. But even in those
institutions that we talk to—and
we do keep close tabs on what
the Ivy League schools
do—they've had very little success
raising money for residences.
So, it was an uphill battle from
day one. And it wouldn't have
worked if the trustees hadn't
stepped forward. The message that
certainly can be carried back to
the students is that the trustees
listen to them.
How do internal events at
Stanford affect outsiders' percep
tions of the University?
A great deal. A great deal. Ob
viously. This last year or two has
been a tough year for us in the
media. Whether it's the Western
Culture debate or a change in the
Hoover leadership, or the spring
occupation of the President's Of

immediate impact on the devel
opment operation and the cam

they become distractions. Rather

here, we wouldn't be doing our
job. I do think that it's important
to realize that what happens here
does have a ripple effect into the

You probably received a couple
of phone calls after the occupa
tion?
More than a couple. Again, I
think it was a big job, it still is a
very big job, to explain the whole
UCMI report and all of the sur
rounding issues that certainly
played a part in that occupation.
And there are two sides to it.
There was perhaps a negative re

We have to play both sides of it.

Those kinds of issues arc going
to come up all the time. We expect

Many undergraduates sec how

the Centennial Campaign and are
angry because it is still costing

What we are doing will help
make undergraduate education
more accessible to more people.
The place I'd start is undergrad

more money as a percentage of
our very ambitious goal in the
undergraduate scholarship cate
gory to the point where we raised
the goal in February. So that in
and of itself helps those people
who are going to come here.
I think there are other ways in
which we arc helping to under
write the programs both on the
graduate and undergraduate levels
that will help the University han
dle the overall costs of the aca
demic program. But 1 can't tell
you that it will, in the end, cut
the costs. It will cut the increase
in cost. The cost is there, it's not
going to go down—it's a question
of how much it will continue to
increase. I'm sure that our success
will help determine the rate of
that increase. If we weren't raising
money, the rate would have to be
much greater.
Remember that we raise gifts in
two forms. We raise expendable
gifts, which help us right here and
now, when you're going to school.
But a lot of what we do is build
endowment, and that's a much
longer term process.
If you remember that if we
receive a gift of $100,000 to endow
a scholarship, in a given year, that

only gives us $4,750 to spend. So
you're not having a $100,000 im

a $4,750 impact on the institution.
But you're going to have it in
perpetuity. That's a big part of
our job, to stay focused on the
long term.
Although undergrads don't
think in the long term. They
need assistance now.
That's right. You've got a four

why you stress in painful tones

remember that when I went

Let's turn to questions of eth
ics. History Prof. Barton

extent to which universities have
become entangled with large cor
porations for their funding. This
certainly is almost a defining
characteristic of the Centennial
campaign. Do you see any prob
lems in this situation?
There is a potential problem, if
you're not diligent in analyzing
those relationships and setting
boundaries that are appropriate.
But you can. Our faculty and this
institution have been cognizant of
those potential problems to the
point where there is the close scru
tiny that Prof. Bernstein and
others want. I would want to reas
sure him that his colleagues that
are involved in those relation
ships—faculty who arc running
the programs in which these cor
porations are interested—are very
cognizant of those boundaries.
My personal experience has
been that I've never seen a cor
poration that was dictating the
research that this institution was
going to pursue. I have not seen
a corporation keep a faculty mem
ber from publishing what he or

dents in a way that was inappro

is sensitive to those kinds of issues.
But doesn't the preponderance

1 think for the society as a
whole, it is healthy to have the
research universities talking with
corporations that will translate a
lot of what we do in a very fun
damental way (research, program
ming) into products and activities
that have an impact on society as
a whole. 1 think that's a gaxi

bridge. I think places like Stan
ford can demonstrate how it can
be done well. Particularly if we
conduct our business in the open,
so that you or Prof. Bernstein or
whoever can come by and see and
talk to and visit with the faculty
and the students who are talking
with these corporate representa
tives. I think it can be healthy for
society as a whole.
The contrast you might want
to draw is the way the Japanese
all lock up together—the govern
ment, the industry, the educa
tional institutions. You want to
talk about being an arm of some
body else! Quite honestly, we can't
even order that.
As a society, we are competing
in a much tougher world today,

and I think that if we do build
good, strong bridges between cor
porations and research univer
sities—bridges that everybody can
view—that will be good for all of
us.
The concern that you're ex
pressing is very appropriate and
we want to be vigilant, but at the
same time, I think there are ways
to go about it that would be terrific
for the institution.
Again, putting on my specific
hat in the university, we need
them. We need their support.
There's an awful lot of this insti
tution that depends on that kind
of support.
Would the Centennial Cam
paign accept money from uneth
ical corporations—corporations
with egregious environmental or
labor practices, for instance? Is

there any sort of ethical review

We can't do that kind of re

this institution. I think that we
try to be as careful as we can if
there's something in the public
record that we're aware of.
The distinction I'm drawing is
that we don't go digging for po
tential problems. If there's some
thing that's readily apparent, we
will actively debate it in this in
stitution.
I assure you that we have had
instances in this institution where
we have turned down gifts of sup-

port because we thought it was
not in our guiding principles.
The majority of the examples
would fall in the category of donors
wanting to put restrictions on gifts,
wanting us to use it in very specific
ways that we don't feel comfort
able abiding by. We obviously have
had an open debate about divesti
ture around South African oper
ations over the last several years.
I think that's a good example of
where the institution, not this of
fice in particular but the institu
tion elsewhere, has looked at social
issues of importance.
I think that probably will ex
pand. 1 don't know what form it
will take and 1 think the Board
of Trustees and the Committee
on Investment Responsibility
(which is I think the right place
to house that kind of study) arc
considering further activities that
they might undertake.

You're asking questions in a grey
area, limited for the most part by
our lack of knowledge of a lot
these people. But again that's part
of my job, to keep my antennae
up and sense when there might
be something a little fishy. And
obviously 99.99 percent of the gifts
that are offered to this institution
are offered with no strings and
from very good people. So we don't
have to get into it very often, but
we need to be sensitive.
Are there times when simply
the ethics of a donor are in ques>
tion?
Sure. Some of these people
being indicted for Wall Street ac
tivities at the moment—that's a
very sensitive area. And I can tell
you that we have, unfortunately,
one Stanford alumnus who is un
der indictment. I am not going to
actively pursue a gift from that
person.
Quite honestly, I haven't gone
to look at his gift record to see
if we've received any gifts in the
past. We haven't received anything
major that I know of. But I'm not
going to go pursue a gift from him.
What will Stanford look like
when the Centennial Campaign
is over? How will all these major
changes effect the University,
particularly the undergraduate
experience here?
I hope that we will provide a
more solid financial underpin
ning—particularly for the School
of Humanities and Sciences, but
also for Engineering and Earth
Sciences. They will have more en
dowment there, they will have a
few more flexible funds and means
to create new programs and take
advantage of new interdisciplinary
opportunities.
1 hope the Centennial Chair
Professorship component of the
campaign is successful, so the
provost finds himself with 12 new
endowed chairs where we have
senior faculty teaching undergrad
uates as their primary mission.
And I certainly hope that we con
tinue to have the success we've
had with undergraduate scholar
ships and graduate fellowships, so
that anyone who wants to come
to this institution will have the
opportunity to do so.
A lot of the vitality that I've
seen here really stems from the
permeability of the boundaries of
schools and departments and the
opportunities that students have
to find a different kind of mix of
academic opportunity that comes
from different kinds of affiliations
and associations among professors.
If those kinds of new opportu
nities come out of this campaign,
I'll be absolutely delighted, but the
minute the campaign is over, the
next morning we're going to have
to get up and keep raising money
for this university.

It could be considered unnerv
ing having a tete-a-tete with some
one who regularly makes more
than $100,000 from his conversa
tion partners.
But if John Ford made people
nervous, he wouldn't be making
Stanford so much money.
As director of the Centennial
Campaign, Ford is raising $1.1 bil
lion dollars for the University.
For him, nothing could be more
natural.
He speaks the language of
money. He knows all its prefer
ences. He frequents its haunts.
His words rarely include num
bers, his manner is sympathetic
and his office demurs modestly.
Ford looms as a legend in the
fund-raising business. He's been
doing it all of his occupational life.
He started in 1973, two years
after graduating with a bachelor's
in history from Stanford. While
attending a master's program in
history and public administration
at the University of Southern Cal
ifornia, he plunged into full-time
development work for Cal Tech's
$130 million campaign.

He moved from Cal Tech to
climb the rungs in the University
of Chicago development office,
and then swung west back to Stan
ford.
Starting out in 1977 as Associ
ate Director of Medical Develop
ment, Ford has moved up through
the Stanford development office.
1 le was appointed to his current
post as Vice President for Devel
opment in 1988.
In this capacity he now con
ducts the most ambitious fund
raising campaign in the hißtory of
higher education.
The Weekly spoke with Ford to
hear his views on the Centennial
Campaign.
How do the Stanford commu
nity and the development office
interact to set the goals of the
Centennial Campaign?
Stanford has, to the best of my
knowledge, the best academic
process for identifying things that
faculty and students want to ac
complish and bringing those for
ward through their departments
to the provost. We have a group
that meets about once a
month—four representatives from
the development office and four

representatives from the provost's
office. We get together and talk
about those things that the provost
has determined to he important
academically and we talk about
the feasibility of raising money for
those projects.
So, it's a very grass-roots kind
of effort that culminates in a dis
cussion in the provost's office and
then with the development office.
That's how priorities are set. Ac
ademic programs are ranked into
four categories, and that deter
mines how much effort this office
can afford to put into pursuing
private support for those projects.
It's a very well-understood and
very well-organized process. As I
said, very few other institutions
have done it as well or as long.
The ASSU recently conducted
a poll that asked students where
they thought Centennial funds
ought to be allocated. How did
you respond to that poll?
Well, 1 was delighted to have
an opportunity to visit with some
of the student leaders who partic
ipated in bringing forth that poll
and its results. I think there were
a couple of comments. Number
one, a number of things in which

the students were interested were
embedded in the goals of the cam
paign. The problem is u>e (in the
development office) have to talk
more gencrically than specifically.
The students just didn't see the
specifics. The generics actually
covered some of the things in
which they were interested.
Then there were a few other
things in which the students were
interested for which I have great
sympathy, but the provost has
learned and we certainly have
learned by firsthand experience,
that you don't always attract dol
lars for everything you need. I
think there were some things that
we recognized early on were im
portant, but they weren't going to
come from private gift support.
The residences are a very good
example. This went all the way
back to 1961—we had an under
graduate residence component in
every one of our three fund-raising
campaigns. We hadn't raised a
ruckle as of this spring and we
weren't headed toward raising any
money in this campaign. So we
felt it best to defer and to focus
on some other activities.
Now, in the process of deferring,
it became such an urgent conver
sation among the trustees—and
the students clearly had a role in
stressing the urgency of the mat
ter — that the trustees came back
to us and to the provost and said,
"Is there any way we can play
with this and come up with a
project that maybe isn't as costly?"
In so doing, a couple of the trus
tees said, "We'll make the down
payment, we'll put up the first gift
money on this to get it going."
It's been a wonderful example of
how the institution can galvanize
around a project that clearly didn't
carry any outside interest for a
long period of time.
Why didn't undergraduate
housing carry outside interest?
Number one, the most difficult
dollars to raise in the last decade,
for any institution, have been dol
lars for facilities. Number two, res
idences are difficult to raise money
for because sophisticated donors
understand that there is an income
spring that supports residences—
that's your room and board. Num
ber three, in this institution, we
don't have the orientation around
the residences that exists at some
of our Ivy League counterparts.
We just haven't built up the tra

dition of investing in residences
and residential education.
Now we're obviously trying to
change that. But even in those
institutions that we talk to—and
we do keep close tabs on what
the Ivy League schools
do—they've had very little success
raising money for residences.
So, it was an uphill battle from
day one. And it wouldn't have
worked if the trustees hadn't
stepped forward. The message that
certainly can be carried back to
the students is that the trustees
listen to them.
How do internal events at
Stanford affect outsiders' percep
tions of the University?
A great deal. A great deal. Ob
viously. This last year or two has
been a tough year for us in the
media. Whether it's the Western
Culture debate or a change in the
Hoover leadership, or the spring
occupation of the President's Of
fice— all of those things have
immediate impact on the devel
opment operation and the cam
paign activity, primarily because
they become distractions. Rather
than talking to people about in
vesting in Stanford, we have to
talk a lot about these issues that
are getting the headlines.
But it is a part of our job. We
try to get beyond the headlines in
The Los Angeles Times or The
Wall Street Journal to explain
more of the subtleties or the real
facts of what's taking place.
That's where faculty and stu
dents come into play. We draw on
them. (Philosophy Prof.) John
Perry made a tour through South
ern California this spring, explain
ing the Cultures, Ideas and Values
program, which was very helpful.
We got very good attendance from
people who had been very critical
of the debate. We have students
in those situations, too.
But there's no doubt that cur
rent activities on campus do have
an impact. It certainly would help
us if students understood at times
that their actions have ramifica
tions on people who are providing
support that really docs help create
the milieu in which you attend
your classes.
Private support is obviously very
crucial to a private institution. I'm
not saying that the debate should
not take place: It should. It's very
healthy and I tell people all the
time: If there wasn't controversy

here, we wouldn't be doing our
job. I do think that it's important
to realize that what happens here
does have a ripple effect into the
outside world.
You probably received a couple
of phone calls after the occupa
tion?
More than a couple. Again, I
think it was a big job, it still is a
very big job, to explain the whole
UCMI report and all of the sur
rounding issues that certainly
played a part in that occupation.
And there are two sides to it.
There was perhaps a negative re
sponse because of the occupation.
But as you know, there was also
a negative response in the way
that the police were brought into
the settling of that occupation.
We have to play both sides of it.
It isn't only one-dimensional. It
isn't only the conservative seg
ments of our constituency that we
hear from.
Those kinds of issues arc going
to come up all the time. We expect
it, it's part of our job, and we're
happy to be ambassadors explain
ing what's going on.
Many undergraduates sec how
much money you're raising in
the Centennial Campaign and are
angry because it is still costing
them more each year to attend
school. How will the Centennial
campaign really help undergrad
uate education?
What we are doing will help
make undergraduate education
more accessible to more people.
The place I'd start is undergrad
uate scholarships. We have raised
more money as a percentage of
our very ambitious goal in the
undergraduate scholarship cate
gory to the point where we raised
the goal in February. So that in
and of itself helps those people
who are going to come here.
I think there are other ways in
which we arc helping to under
write the programs both on the
graduate and undergraduate levels
that will help the University han
dle the overall costs of the aca
demic program. But 1 can't tell
you that it will, in the end, cut
the costs. It will cut the increase
in cost. The cost is there, it's not
going to go down—it's a question
of how much it will continue to
increase. I'm sure that our success
will help determine the rate of
that increase. If we weren't raising
money, the rate would have to be
much greater.
Remember that we raise gifts in
two forms. We raise expendable
gifts, which help us right here and
now, when you're going to school.
But a lot of what we do is build
endowment, and that's a much
longer term process.
If you remember that if we
receive a gift of $100,000 to endow
a scholarship, in a given year, that

only gives us $4,750 to spend. So
you're not having a $100,000 im
pact next year. You're only have
a $4,750 impact on the institution.
But you're going to have it in
perpetuity. That's a big part of
our job, to stay focused on the
long term.
Although undergrads don't
think in the long term. They
need assistance now.
That's right. You've got a four
year window. I fully understand
why you stress in painful tones
some of the views you do. Just
remember that when I went
through here 20 years ago, the
percentage of disposable family in
come that went towards education
was the same. The raw dollar num
ber is considerably more and
driven by inflation. The percent
of family income that goes toward
education is still the same.
Let's turn to questions of eth
ics. History Prof. Barton
Bernstein recently criticized the
extent to which universities have
become entangled with large cor
porations for their funding. This
certainly is almost a defining
characteristic of the Centennial
campaign. Do you see any prob
lems in this situation?
There is a potential problem, if
you're not diligent in analyzing
those relationships and setting
boundaries that are appropriate.
But you can. Our faculty and this
institution have been cognizant of
those potential problems to the
point where there is the close scru
tiny that Prof. Bernstein and
others want. I would want to reas
sure him that his colleagues that
are involved in those relation
ships—faculty who arc running
the programs in which these cor
porations are interested—are very
cognizant of those boundaries.
My personal experience has
been that I've never seen a cor
poration that was dictating the
research that this institution was
going to pursue. I have not seen
a corporation keep a faculty mem
ber from publishing what he or
she wanted to. I have never seen
a corporation lock up graduate stu
dents in a way that was inappro
priate. I think that this institution
is sensitive to those kinds of issues.
But doesn't the preponderance
of corporate funding establish a
milieu—nothing conspiratorial,
but something perhaps deeper
and more significant?
1 think for the society as a
whole, it is healthy to have the
research universities talking with
corporations that will translate a
lot of what we do in a very fun
damental way (research, program
ming) into products and activities
that have an impact on society as
a whole. 1 think that's a gaxi

bridge. I think places like Stan
ford can demonstrate how it can
be done well. Particularly if we
conduct our business in the open,
so that you or Prof. Bernstein or
whoever can come by and see and
talk to and visit with the faculty
and the students who are talking
with these corporate representa
tives. I think it can be healthy for
society as a whole.
The contrast you might want
to draw is the way the Japanese
all lock up together—the govern
ment, the industry, the educa
tional institutions. You want to
talk about being an arm of some
body else! Quite honestly, we can't
even order that.
As a society, we are competing
in a much tougher world today,

and I think that if we do build
good, strong bridges between cor
porations and research univer
sities—bridges that everybody can
view—that will be good for all of
us.
The concern that you're ex
pressing is very appropriate and
we want to be vigilant, but at the
same time, I think there are ways
to go about it that would be terrific
for the institution.
Again, putting on my specific
hat in the university, we need
them. We need their support.
There's an awful lot of this insti
tution that depends on that kind
of support.
Would the Centennial Cam
paign accept money from uneth
ical corporations—corporations
with egregious environmental or
labor practices, for instance? Is

there any sort of ethical review
process?
We can't do that kind of re
search. We don't have access to
the kind of information that would
let us closely scrutinize the whole
range of the donor population of
this institution. I think that we
try to be as careful as we can if
there's something in the public
record that we're aware of.
The distinction I'm drawing is
that we don't go digging for po
tential problems. If there's some
thing that's readily apparent, we
will actively debate it in this in
stitution.
I assure you that we have had
instances in this institution where
we have turned down gifts of sup-

The majority of the examples
would fall in the category of donors
wanting to put restrictions on gifts,
wanting us to use it in very specific
ways that we don't feel comfort
able abiding by. We obviously have
had an open debate about divesti
ture around South African oper
ations over the last several years.
I think that's a good example of
where the institution, not this of
fice in particular but the institu
tion elsewhere, has looked at social
issues of importance.
I think that probably will ex
pand. 1 don't know what form it
will take and 1 think the Board
of Trustees and the Committee
on Investment Responsibility
(which is I think the right place
to house that kind of study) arc
considering further activities that
they might undertake.

You're asking questions in a grey
area, limited for the most part by
our lack of knowledge of a lot
these people. But again that's part

obviously 99.99 percent of the gifts

we need to be sensitive.
