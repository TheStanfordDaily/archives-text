## Genes in jellybeans? Some surveyed say yes 
### Tanya Paull Editorial staff 
This may come as a shock, hut scientists
have yet to find DNA in rocks, plastic, or
kitchen linoleum.
Researchers must he too busy making
antibiotics to kill viruses, and trying to form
table salt out of calcium carbonate.
No? At least a few people think so —
some of the 100 people at Tresidder Union
lasf Friday who participated in The Stanford
Weekly's survey of the public's understand
ing of science.
If any of you were wondering — all
insects do not have eight legs; electrons
are not larger than atoms; and, unfortun
ately, antibiotics do not kill viruses.
The results from the small survey are
not that disturbing, though — at least com
pared to similar but more extensive studies
done in the United States and Britain last
year. A recent report in the journal Nature
showed that levels of scientific understand
ing in both countries are absurdly low,
especially considering the technological
achievements of both cultures.
The surveys found that "only 34 percent
of Britons and 46 percent of Americans
appeared to know that the Earth goes round
the Sun once a year," according to the
Nature article.
Most of the Stanford respondents — com
prised mainly of students, visitors, and some
staff and faculty members — got that one
right. But still, 9 percent didn't believe that
the Earth even goes around the Sun (instead
of the other way around) and 14 percent
thought that if it did, it would take one day.
If it only takes one day, then is it Christ
mas every morning?
The Stanford Weekly's survey was a much
shorter and not entirely serious version of
those described in Nature. Respondents in
the national surveys were grilled not only
on their knowledge of scientific facts, but
also on their understanding of scientific
inquiry in general.
We weren't quite as ambitious. We just
wanted to get an idea of how many people
at Stanford actually think that cavemen
lived with dinosaurs.
Scientists have yet to prove that one,
either.
Overall the Stanford respondents did very
well. 66 percent knew that antibiotics don't
kill viruses — compared to only 29 percent

nationally. An impressive 93 percent said
that sound does not travel faster than light,
while only 18.5 percent of the national
respondents realized that fact.
As the report in Nature predicted, an
academic community like Stanford was
bound to be more knowledgable about sci
ence than the average public. But the au
thors of the national study also generalized
that "in Britain younger people tend to
know more than older people; males tend
to know more than females; and middle
class people tend to know more than
working-class people."
The Stanford survey did agree with the
others on a different point, though — the
strong correlation between interest and un
derstanding. In the Tresidder survey, 64
percent of the respondents said they were
"very interested" in new scientific discov
eries — double the percentage who were
very interested in sports.
Only 38 percent of the national respon
dents were very interested in science —
correlating with the trend of nationwide
scientific ignorance.
But a few people in our survey answered
incorrectly on purpose to one question be
cause Einstein was misspelled as "Enstein"
in the survey. "Who is Enstein?" one person
wrote.
In fact, one of the major findings of our
survey is that sarcasm is alive and well on
the Stanford campus. Ten percent of the
respondents had some kind of comment to
make about the validity of our questions.
Some noted that not all the oxygen we
breathe comes from plants. Others said that
the cavemen probably lived with birds,
which are descended from dinosaurs; and
others remarked that the manner of inges
tion makes a difference when it comes to
vitamins and health (which, by the way, is
not what the question was referring to).
One post-doctoral student suggested we
add another question to the list — true or
false: ketchup is a vegetable.
Yes, the take-home message is clear:
People on the Stanford campus seem to be
interested and relatively informed about sci
ence. But not informed enough, or else 16
percent would not have thought that non
living things contain DNA.
In response to the statement about lasers,
one person wrote, "Please, we're Stanford
students!" True, but even Stanford students
still have a few things to learn.

In fact, one of the major findings of our
survey is that sarcasm is alive and well on
the Stanford campus. Ten percent of the
respondents had some kind of comment to
make about the validity of our questions.
Some noted that not all the oxygen we
breathe comes from plants. Others said that
the cavemen probably lived with birds,
which are descended from dinosaurs; and
others remarked that the manner of inges
tion makes a difference when it comes to
vitamins and health (which, by the way, is
not what the question was referring to).
One post-doctoral student suggested we
add another question to the list — true or
false: ketchup is a vegetable.
Yes, the take-home message is clear:
People on the Stanford campus seem to be
interested and relatively informed about sci
ence. But not informed enough, or else 16
percent would not have thought that non
living things contain DNA.
In response to the statement about lasers,
one person wrote, "Please, we're Stanford
students!" True, but even Stanford students
still have a few things to learn.

This may come as a shock, hut scientists
have yet to find DNA in rocks, plastic, or

Researchers must he too busy making
antibiotics to kill viruses, and trying to form
table salt out of calcium carbonate.
No? At least a few people think so —
some of the 100 people at Tresidder Union
lasf Friday who participated in The Stanford
Weekly's survey of the public's understand
ing of science.
If any of you were wondering — all
insects do not have eight legs; electrons
are not larger than atoms; and, unfortun
ately, antibiotics do not kill viruses.
The results from the small survey are
not that disturbing, though — at least com
pared to similar but more extensive studies
done in the United States and Britain last
year. A recent report in the journal Nature
showed that levels of scientific understand
ing in both countries are absurdly low,
especially considering the technological
achievements of both cultures.
The surveys found that "only 34 percent
of Britons and 46 percent of Americans
appeared to know that the Earth goes round
the Sun once a year," according to the
Nature article.
Most of the Stanford respondents — com
prised mainly of students, visitors, and some
staff and faculty members — got that one
right. But still, 9 percent didn't believe that
the Earth even goes around the Sun (instead
of the other way around) and 14 percent
thought that if it did, it would take one day.
If it only takes one day, then is it Christ
mas every morning?
The Stanford Weekly's survey was a much
shorter and not entirely serious version of
those described in Nature. Respondents in
the national surveys were grilled not only
on their knowledge of scientific facts, but
also on their understanding of scientific
inquiry in general.
We weren't quite as ambitious. We just
wanted to get an idea of how many people
at Stanford actually think that cavemen
lived with dinosaurs.
Scientists have yet to prove that one,
either.
Overall the Stanford respondents did very
well. 66 percent knew that antibiotics don't
kill viruses — compared to only 29 percent

nationally. An impressive 93 percent said
that sound does not travel faster than light,
while only 18.5 percent of the national
respondents realized that fact.
As the report in Nature predicted, an
academic community like Stanford was
bound to be more knowledgable about sci
ence than the average public. But the au
thors of the national study also generalized
that "in Britain younger people tend to
know more than older people; males tend
to know more than females; and middle
class people tend to know more than
working-class people."
The Stanford survey did agree with the
others on a different point, though — the
strong correlation between interest and un
derstanding. In the Tresidder survey, 64
percent of the respondents said they were
"very interested" in new scientific discov
eries — double the percentage who were
very interested in sports.
Only 38 percent of the national respon
dents were very interested in science —
correlating with the trend of nationwide
scientific ignorance.
But a few people in our survey answered
incorrectly on purpose to one question be
cause Einstein was misspelled as "Enstein"
in the survey. "Who is Enstein?" one person
wrote.
