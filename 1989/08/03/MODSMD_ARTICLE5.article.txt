## Dean James Lyons will step down next June 
### Paula Gani Staff writer 
After the 1989-90 academic year, James
Lyons will resign from his 16-year post as
Stanford's dean of studeni affairs. However,
his dedication to the quality of college
student life will continue with independent
research projects.
According to University President
Donald Kennedy, "He has planned this
move carefully and well." Lyons began dis
cussing his plans with Kennedy at the be
ginning of last fall.
Lyons' objectives in his future work are
two-fold. His first goal is to increase the
number of minority students going into
higher education and student affairs-related
graduate programs. Secondly, he wants to
develop curricula that will better prepare
professionals in student affairs and related
fields to work on campuses that are cul-

turally diverse.
One of Lyons' interests
is "comparative college cul
ture," he said. A current
project he is involved with
is the College Experiences
Study, a national study
which has identified the 14
schools with the highest
quality of student life.

Members of the group visit these schools
to study the aspects that make them so
strong. In the upcoming year, Lyons and
other group members will be finishing up
the project with a book and other publi
cations.
His long term pursuit is to, "in a national
effort, gather together thoughtful and in
tellectual people" who will work toward the
completion of his two goals. "We have to
look beyond the usual in achieving greater
success," said Lyons.

â€” Donald Kennedy

Lyons began his Stanford career in 1972
after serving a 10-year term as the dean of
students at Haverford College. Since his
arrival, he has implemented student and
faculty task forces for various issues, created
a dean's award for outstanding service and
was a principal author in revising the charter
for student affairs by the National Associ
ation of Student Personnel Administrators.
"What 1 feel the most good about is the
way residential education and residential
life have grown and become more varied,
more part of the University," said Lyons of
his achievements. In this area he includes
theme houses and"the bridges that have
been built."

Additionally, he is pleased "that Stanford
really does stand out in having a climate
where students are taking charge of our
community," he said. "They work well in
dependently and collectively."
"Contrary to popular belief, students are
far less self-centered," said Lyons. "They
have a much greater willingness to work,
and do volunteer work in areas that have
to do with social good, including careers
in education. I don't sec the kind of nar
rowness, and careerism which can result
from higher education."
The University will begin its search this
fall for a new dean of student affairs. Ac
cording to Lyons, "nothing is definite" about
the position, but it should be filled by next
spring, when his resignation goes into effect.
When asked if he had a final message
for students and for his successor, Lyons
replied, "I've got a whole year to think
about that."
