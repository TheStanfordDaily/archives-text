# Rosse forms committee for faculty hiring
## 
### 
The University took another
step to increase the diversity of
its faculty Tuesday by forming a
committee to develop programs,
policies and strategics for the
recruitment and retention of a di-

verse faculty.
Provost James
Rosse announced
that Economics
Prof. Donald
Brown will chair
the five-member
Provost's Special
Committee on
Faculty Recruit
ment and Reten-

tion. The committee was created
in response to the University
Committee on Minority Issues'
report, handed down April 5.
The UCMI repot i called for,
among other things, a faculty com
mittee to work with the provost
in developing a faculty affirmative
action program. The report rec
ommended Stanford increase the
number of minority faculty by 30
over the course of the next decade.
Stanford has had "some success
in making minority . ->pointments
over the past two cades," ac
cording to UCMI, buâ€¢ the process
has been "frustratingly slow and
difficult," especially in ihe last dec
ade. Stanford added 6 tenure-line
minority faculty members between
1978 and 1987, but there were 50
minority faculty departures in that
time, including deaths and retire
ments.
Rossc called the goal "reason
able and within reach given real
effort on the part of this institu
tion," according to Donald Ken
nedy's speech to the Academic
Council in May.
The charge stated that "the
committee will provide general ad
vice to the provost and his/her
staff on the appointment processes
on issues affecting faculty members
of color and women faculty."
The committee will be com
posed of Brown, Elisabeth Pate-
Cornell, associate professor of in
dustrial engineering; Gerald Lopez,
professor of law; Leon Rosenberg,
professor of medecine; and Sylvia
Yanagisako, associate professor of
anthropology. Rosse and Cecilia
Burciaga, acting senior associate
provost and affirmative action of
ficer, will serve as ex officio mem
bers of the committee.
