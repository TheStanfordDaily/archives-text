# New companies move in as Tresidder shapes up
## 
### Stacy Stern Staff writer 
Big changes will be afoot in
Tresidder Union over the next
couple of months. Some of the
food services in Tresidder will
close temporarily for remodeling
as Marriott Corp. leaves and Bon
Appetit and Stanford Bookstore
management take over.
The new managers will begin
operations Sept. I, according to
Paul Szczesiul, associate director
of Tresidder. The Stanford Book
store management will run The
Store, and Bon Appetit will oper
ate the Coffee House, Grand Mar
ketplace, Corner Pocket, Patio
Grill, Encina Station, Baker Street
and Tresidder Catering.
"1 don't think you'll recognize
the place," said Fedele Bauccio,
Bon Appetit's chief executive of
ficer.
According to Szczesiul, the big
gest changes will be in the Grand
Marketplace, which will be closed
from Aug. 6 to Sept. 4. "There
will be new menu items and phys
ical changes," he said.
Baker Street will also be "totally
redone," Szczesiul said. The
bakery, which will be closed from
Sept. 1 to Sept. 17, will offer a
full line of salads and deli items
after its counters are remodeled
for better service, he said.
Minor physical changes will also

be made to the Corner Pocket,
which will suspend operation from
Sept. 1 to Sept. 10. Frozen yogurt,
which is currently served there,
will he sold at Baker Street instead.
Prices and hours of operation
of food services in Tresidder may
also change. "Some items have
been reduced in price," said
Szczesiul, adding that other items
may increase. He said his goal is
to have at least one food service
running during the hours the
building is open.
Bauccio said that his company
is interviewing everyone currently
employed by Marriott on campus.
"We hope to hire as many of those
as possible," he said. Bauccio
added that Bon Appetit will prob
ably need more help, and that the
company hopes to begin a student
management program.
Extra room has also become
available on the first floor of Tres
idder because the Academic In
formation Resources computer
cluster and the Computer Science
Department have moved to the
second floor.
Szczesiul said that the Store will
probably be moving into the space
formerly occupied by the cluster
sometime next winter or spring.
The Store's current space would
then be used to house the Corner
Pocket. However, that plan has
yet to be finalized.
Even further down the road, the
Computer Science Department
will probably vacate its space up
stairs to make way for student
services when the new information
sciences building in the Near West
campus is completed. However,
Sean Welsh, a division director of
Academic Information Resources,
said architects are still reviewing

plans for that building and the
move might not come for several
years.
Szczesiul said that "student serv
ices" might include student office
space or other space useful to stu
dent groups, such as a shared
workroom.
Welsh and Szczesiul both noted
that although the Computer Sci
ence Department will eventually
be moving, the AIR Macintosh
cluster will remain in the second
floor space indefinitely.
