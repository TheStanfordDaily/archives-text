# Stanford professor studying three new transplant drugs

### 
A Stanford scientist announced
yesterday that he is working on
three drugs that offer new promise
in preventing rejection in
transplant operations.
"All three of these novel drugs
will require extensive further test
ing before their safety and effec
tiveness are assured, but if our
initial hopes arc proven, we are
nearing a fundamental turning
point in being able to keep
transplant patients healthier and
alive longer," Dr. Randall Morris
said to an international congress
on immunology in Berlin.
Morris is the director of the
laboratory of transplantation im
munology in the Department of
Cardiovascular Surgery at the
Medical Center.
The first drug contains lectins,
which boost instead of suppress
the body's immune system. The
second is FK-506, the first oral
anti-rejection drug designed spe
cifically for use in transplant
patients. It is on the threshold of

human testing. Similar to FK-506
is RPM, which Morris called
"maybe the most potent anti
rejection drug ever described."
Ever since organ transplants
began 35 years ago, scientists have
sought methods of stopping rejec
tion, the immune system's attack
of the transplanted tissue, without
completely destroying the recip
ient's immune system.
"The drugs now in patient use
are sort of like fairy godmothers,"
Morris explained. "They can get
Cinderella to the ball (halt rejec
tion for some time), but the clock

eventually strikes midnight. The
patients are ultimately going to
reject their organs, and while many
patients can live relatively normal
lives for a long time, the need for
years of powerful medication and
the constant threat of rejection
exacts a toll. What we're looking
for is the glass slipper that will
allow Cinderella to meet the
prince and live happily ever after."
Lectins have been extensively
tested in rats and have been able
to prevent rejection long after use
is discontinued. Monkeys have
also been tested with the drug and

anemia is the only side effect that
has been detected.
FK-506 is a fungal extract that
was discovered in Japan. It is con
sidered to he 20 times more pow
erful than cyclosporine, the most
used immunosuppressive of the
'80s. In addition to the difference
in strength, this drug also has dem
onstrated the ability to fight severe
rejection, something cyclosporine
cannot do.
The third drug, RPM, is con
sidered 50 times stronger than
cyclosporine following tests on ro
dents.
Another advantage of these
drugs is that they may help alle
viate the need for some tians
plants. "Perhaps ironically, many
of the patients who need a
transplant have come to that point
because their own organs were
destroyed by their own immune
systems," Morris said. "Improved
immunoregulatory drugs may
enable [this] process to be halted
and reversed â€¢'
