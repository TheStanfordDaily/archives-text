## Editor's farewell 
### 
Thirty-thousand feet high, two hours
out of San Francisco, I try to bid farewell to
the community I served as summer editor
in chief of The Stanford Daily.
As I do, I also watch three Soviet men
across the aisle lean toward each other as they laugh.
One rubs his companion's back, and I strain to un
derstand their w^rds.
1 will be a traveler in their country within 48 hours.
During the next three weeks, I will be part of a team
that will lay foundations for a Soviet-American student
journal to be based at Moscow, Stanford and Pepper
dine Universities.
The arcane workings of Aeroflot and the precipitous
rate at which the project developed demanded my
premature departure as editor of The Weekly.
I decided to go because I wholly trust The Weekly
staff to continue to raise the quality of the paper we
have created over the past six weeks, and because the
Soviet-American journal I will help build will expand
the range of all student publishing in both countries.
I would like to offer a parting observation, made
after hundreds of days spent within the confines of
The Daily offices.
All of us, particularly those who work in publishing,
establish conventions and habits in order to provide
a framework for creativity, in order to give our
imagination the power that comes with discipline.
However, by relying too heavily or quickly on those
structures, we often lose the very creativity we in
tended to achieve.
Each issue, The Weekly or The Daily staff makes a
choice about the newspaper's style, content and form.
Usually, most elements of those choices are tacit —
as would be expected of a daily paper — but too
often, we fail to notice our options for creative change.
We fail to see the powerful possibilities that lie beyond
what already exists.
This summer, with the help of a committed and
inventive staff, I discovered the magic and worth of
efforts born of collaboration and vigilant questioning
of assumptions and traditions. I found a rare oppor
tunity, simply, to break old habits and to invent new
forms.
I am now in transition. I am literally suspended
between my life at The Daily and my new activities
in the Soviet Union.
I hope both in the country to which I am traveling
and in the University that I leave, we will not assuage
our fear of creating by imposing artificial restrictions
and limits on the possibilities of expression.
