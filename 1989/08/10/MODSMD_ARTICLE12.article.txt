Stanford staffers
are being silenced
by weak policies
The Daily hears least from
non-faculty, unrepresented
employees: programmers,
engineers, supervisors and
administration, clerical and
scientific staff. Why? The
Ombudsperson's report for
1988 lamented widespread
staff perception of employee
management relations as "we
versus they ... siege mentali
ty"
The Daily is isolated from
information, dialogue and
truth because staff have been
denied protections essential
for candor at work, free of
reprisal for frank comments
on technical or policy issues.
The Daily should protect
employees and sources at risk
by unintended or inaccurate
exposure. Whistle-blowers
have no Witness Protection
Program at Stanford.
Begin with those staff is
sues raised at a Forum on
Governance and Decision
Making at Stanford, recorded
in the May 14, 1986 Campus
Report. Long-standing staff
disempowerment should be
explored.
Stanford violates civil con
tract law when hopeful offi
cials print policies on
decency, like the Human
Resources Philosophy, which
later are quietly revealed to
act only by persuasion. The
H.R.P. is inaccessible even by
staff's weak, departmental
grievance. Fictitious policies
only ambush trusting em
ployees who gullibly believe
the written language. Ap
pend the following clarifying
disclaimer to such policies of
persuasion:
"This policy is binding, not
on superiors, but only on
subordinates — who may be
disciplined for violations, or
else may be entrapped and

punished for appeals to its
protections. This statement is
intent and not contract. En
forcement of implied contract
is unavailable."

Democracy also
includes limits
on majority rule
I must agree with many of
the criticisms leveled by Ja
queline Holen in her Aug. 3
letter against my July 13
viewpoint, "A solution for
China." I submitted a six
page article to be run in two
parts only to find it edited
to two pages and missing
exactly those paragraphs 1
had insisted not be cut. As
published I think my view
point made little sense.
Still, Holen is a poor stu
dent of democracy if she
thinks that constitutional
provisions that limit what the
majority can choose are un
democratic ("totalitarian" was
her word). To quote a few
sentences that were edited
from my article:
"Majority rule is only one
half of the concept of democ
racy. The other half is limita
tions on majority rule.
Democratic theory has its
origins in the theory of what
individuals may rightly insist
upon as conditions for laying
down arms, or equivalantly,
as conditions for picking up
arms, be it against a king, a
majority or an individual
"Our Bill .of Rights codifies
one set of limitations on
majority rule, and it would
go much further except that
it was never conceived of as
a complete list.
"John Locke, John Stuart
Mill and our Declaration of
Independence were all in
agreement about one justifi
cation for picking up arms:
self-defense, or the defense

of others. Conccrn for the
future of mankind is a 'de
fense of others.'
"It would not be un
democratic for the Commu
nists to insist that it take
more than a simple majority,
that it take something closer
to unanimity (as a constitu
tional amendment process
requires) to reject an artic
ulated set of responsibilities
toward the future. Require
ments of social justice could
also be insisted on as a de
fense of others. Amendments
rejecting these concerns
would be unlikely to receive
broad support, while amend
ments that addressed these
concerns more efficiently
likely would."
Holen somehow concluded
that my advocacy of broader
limits on majority rule must
put me in opposition of free
speech (guaranteed by cur
rent limits on majority rule)
and generally put me on the
side of China's murderous
leadership.
She seemed most upset by
my suggestion that a Chinese
constitution place limits on
private property. Obviously a
constitutional provision of
this sort would lie outside of
the justification outlined
above. It would be a conces
sion to the present power of
the Chinese Communists,
allowing them to determine
the initial set of laws that
the democracy would then
be free to change. If the
limits placed on private prop
erty were poorly chosen,the
would fall in time.
I myself think that rational
limits on private property
(unobtrusively obtained via a
steep inheritance tax with a
large personal deduction and
no loopholes above that)
would be in little danger of
being overturned. The vast
economic power wielded by
the Hunts and the Helmsleys
of the world is certainly not
a "basic human right."

had insisted not be cut. As
published I think my view
point made little sense.
Still, Holen is a poor stu
dent of democracy if she
thinks that constitutional
provisions that limit what the
majority can choose are un
democratic ("totalitarian" was
her word). To quote a few
sentences that were edited
from my article:
"Majority rule is only one
half of the concept of democ
racy. The other half is limita
tions on majority rule.
Democratic theory has its
origins in the theory of what
individuals may rightly insist
upon as conditions for laying
down arms, or equivalantly,
as conditions for picking up
arms, be it against a king, a
majority or an individual
"Our Bill .of Rights codifies
one set of limitations on
majority rule, and it would
go much further except that
it was never conceived of as
a complete list.
"John Locke, John Stuart
Mill and our Declaration of
Independence were all in
agreement about one justifi
cation for picking up arms:
self-defense, or the defense

of others. Conccrn for the
future of mankind is a 'de
fense of others.'
"It would not be un
democratic for the Commu
nists to insist that it take
more than a simple majority,
that it take something closer
to unanimity (as a constitu
tional amendment process
requires) to reject an artic
ulated set of responsibilities
toward the future. Require
ments of social justice could
also be insisted on as a de
fense of others. Amendments
rejecting these concerns
would be unlikely to receive
broad support, while amend
ments that addressed these
concerns more efficiently
likely would."
Holen somehow concluded
that my advocacy of broader
limits on majority rule must
put me in opposition of free
speech (guaranteed by cur
rent limits on majority rule)
and generally put me on the
side of China's murderous
leadership.
She seemed most upset by
my suggestion that a Chinese
constitution place limits on
private property. Obviously a
constitutional provision of
this sort would lie outside of
the justification outlined
above. It would be a conces
sion to the present power of
the Chinese Communists,
allowing them to determine
the initial set of laws that
the democracy would then
be free to change. If the
limits placed on private prop
erty were poorly chosen,the
would fall in time.
I myself think that rational
limits on private property
(unobtrusively obtained via a
steep inheritance tax with a
large personal deduction and
no loopholes above that)
would be in little danger of
being overturned. The vast
economic power wielded by
the Hunts and the Helmsleys
of the world is certainly not
a "basic human right."

Stanford staffers
are being silenced
by weak policies
The Daily hears least from
non-faculty, unrepresented
employees: programmers,
engineers, supervisors and
administration, clerical and
scientific staff. Why? The
Ombudsperson's report for
1988 lamented widespread
staff perception of employee
management relations as "we
versus they ... siege mentali
ty"
The Daily is isolated from
information, dialogue and
truth because staff have been
denied protections essential
for candor at work, free of
reprisal for frank comments
on technical or policy issues.
The Daily should protect
employees and sources at risk
by unintended or inaccurate
exposure. Whistle-blowers
have no Witness Protection
Program at Stanford.
Begin with those staff is
sues raised at a Forum on
Governance and Decision
Making at Stanford, recorded
in the May 14, 1986 Campus
Report. Long-standing staff
disempowerment should be
explored.
Stanford violates civil con
tract law when hopeful offi
cials print policies on
decency, like the Human
Resources Philosophy, which
later are quietly revealed to
act only by persuasion. The
H.R.P. is inaccessible even by
staff's weak, departmental
grievance. Fictitious policies
only ambush trusting em
ployees who gullibly believe
the written language. Ap
pend the following clarifying
disclaimer to such policies of
persuasion:
"This policy is binding, not
on superiors, but only on
subordinates — who may be
disciplined for violations, or
else may be entrapped and

punished for appeals to its
protections. This statement is
intent and not contract. En
forcement of implied contract
is unavailable."

Democracy also
includes limits
on majority rule
I must agree with many of
the criticisms leveled by Ja
queline Holen in her Aug. 3
letter against my July 13
viewpoint, "A solution for
China." I submitted a six
page article to be run in two
parts only to find it edited
to two pages and missing
exactly those paragraphs 1
had insisted not be cut. As
published I think my view
point made little sense.
