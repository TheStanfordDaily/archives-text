## The 						politics of hostage taking: An eye for an eye still holds 
### 
ISRAEL WAS NOT wrong to kidnap
Sheik Abdcl Karim Obcid.
In fact, the young Israelis who snuck
into the Sheik's village on July 28 and
spirited him away could not have been
more right.
The kidnapping of Sheik Obcid is a
textbook example of how the United States
should be dealing with terrorists. Terrorists
do not respond to a well-turned phrase or
a kind heart.
The only way to discourage terrorists is
to make them feel the sting of their actions.
For every innocent American kidnapped
the United States should seize one or two
or 10 Sheiks.
For every Marine colonel killed the
United States should kill 10 Hezbollah
regulars.
The perpetrators of terrorism are nothing
more than cold-blooded killers. And the
only way to confront and control a killer

For every Marine
colonel killed the United
States should kill 10
Hezbollah regulars.

is to be equally brutal.
The members of Hezbollah have im
plicitly advanced the premise that taking
lives is justified when committed in pursuit
of their cause.
This premise is dangerous considering
the huge number of causes in the world
for which people are willing to kill.
Terrorists established the rules of the
game and it is preposterous to maintain
that the rest of the world should live by
some higher standard.

Clearly the Palestinian problem is a
thorny one than needs to be addressed in
a much more concerted fashion by the
Israeli government.
The Israelis are in a strong position in
relation to the Palestinians. They should
exercise that strength to neutralize any
threats to their existence, but Israel can
also afford to negotiate from strength in
the attempt to ammeliorate the situation.
Palestinians who truly want peaceful co
existence with Israel deserve to live as free
people.
But terrorists who are bent on killing,
whether Israelis or Americans are the target,
deserve nothing more than equal treatment
in return.
Self-defense is a morally valid response
to the threat of violence. It is just that
simple.
Joseph Cicippio, the American hostage
who currently is the center of attention

because of the Revolutionary Justice Or
ganization's threat to kill him if Obeid is
not freed, deserves little sympathy.
Cicippio traveled to Lebanon during a
dangerous time for anyone to visit that
country, especially an American. His cap
tivity is a product of his own stupidity; he
is not an innocent victim.
His life should not weigh very heavily
in the equation that determines how the
United States should deal with terrorists'
offers to deal.
The United States should continue along
the path Israel has forged: Retaliate when
possible and negotiate only on very partic
ular terms.
Capitulation to save one life only risks
10 more lives down the road.
