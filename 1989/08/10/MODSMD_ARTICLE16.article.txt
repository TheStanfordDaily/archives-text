### Mark Rogowsky Editorial staff 
Question: Which institution of
higher learning turns out more
world-class tennis players than an
average sized nation?

The answer, of course, is Stan
ford University. And, this past
week David Wheaton and Tami
Whitlinger stepped out of the
ranks of the unknown and into
the limelight.
Whitlinger, the leader of the

women's teams that won national
titles in 1988 and '89, is currently
in the third round of the $300,000
Virginia Slims of Los Angeles.
Yesterday, Whitlinger knocked
off Sweden's Maria Lindstrom 6-4,
6-3. In the opening round, she
scored a stunning upset over 11th
seeded Lori McNeil 7-6, 6-1.
McNeil is ranked 24th in the
world.
Whitlinger told The Daily in
May she was planning on turning
pro this summer. After a disap
pointing showing at the NCAA
tournament, however, she decided
to delay any announcement. A
strong showing in the coming
weeks would no doubt influence
her decision about returning to
Stanford.
Also in action at Los Angeles
were Whidinger's teammates
Sandra Birch and Debbie Graham.
In the opening round, Birch faced
Jennifer Santrock in a rematch of
the NCAA singles final. As she
did in Gainesville, Fla., Birch tri
umphed — this time by a score
of 6-4, 7-6.
Birch tell in the second round
to No. 8 seed Catarina Lindquist
6-2, 5-7, 6-2. Lindstrom knocked
out Graham 7-6, 6-2 in the first
round.
Patty Fendick, the two-time
NCAA champion, won her opener
over California graduate Karen
Shin 6-4, 6-3. The No. 10 seed
was upset in the second round by
Claudia Porwick of West Germany
6-3, 6-0.
The biggest news on the men's
side is David Wheaton. Coming

weekend's Stratton Mountain, Vt.
