## Whitlinger, Wheaton join Who's Who of world tennis

Question: Which institution of
higher learning turns out more
world-class tennis players than an
average sized nation?

The answer, of course, is Stan
ford University. And, this past
week David Wheaton and Tami
Whitlinger stepped out of the
ranks of the unknown and into
the limelight.
Whitlinger, the leader of the

women's teams that won national
titles in 1988 and '89, is currently
in the third round of the $300,000
Virginia Slims of Los Angeles.
Yesterday, Whitlinger knocked
off Sweden's Maria Lindstrom 6-4,
6-3. In the opening round, she
scored a stunning upset over 11th
seeded Lori McNeil 7-6, 6-1.
McNeil is ranked 24th in the
world.
Whitlinger told The Daily in
May she was planning on turning
pro this summer. After a disap
pointing showing at the NCAA
tournament, however, she decided
to delay any announcement. A
strong showing in the coming
weeks would no doubt influence
her decision about returning to
Stanford.
Also in action at Los Angeles
were Whidinger's teammates
Sandra Birch and Debbie Graham.
In the opening round, Birch faced
Jennifer Santrock in a rematch of
the NCAA singles final. As she
did in Gainesville, Fla., Birch tri
umphed — this time by a score
of 6-4, 7-6.
Birch tell in the second round
to No. 8 seed Catarina Lindquist
6-2, 5-7, 6-2. Lindstrom knocked
out Graham 7-6, 6-2 in the first
round.
Patty Fendick, the two-time
NCAA champion, won her opener
over California graduate Karen
Shin 6-4, 6-3. The No. 10 seed
was upset in the second round by
Claudia Porwick of West Germany
6-3, 6-0.

mentioned as one of three men
who will lead American tennis
into the 1990s — along with
Agassi and Michael Chang.
Whcaton, who played here in
1988, reached the semifinals in
Stratton Mountain before falling
to Brad Gilbert — who would go
on to win the tournament — by
a score of 5-7, 7-6, 6-4. In the
second set, Whcaton was serving
for the match but came up short.
"I was very close to beating Gil
bert," he said. "1 feel very confident
right now. ; That was a big
breakthrough for me.
"It was a combination of him
(raising) his game a little bit and
me being a little nervous and a

little tentative. I missed a couple
of shots when I needed to make
them, and usually I do make those
shots."
Gilbert said of his opponent:
"He has a big serve and does a
lot of things well. I think for him
to make the big improvement like
Chang or Agassi, he needs to have
more speed."
Wheaton concurs. "I'm going
to have to get in better shape,"
he said. "So at 6-5 in the third
set or at four-all in the fifth set
in a Grand Slam, I feel almost as
fresh as I did in the first set."
Still, Wheaton did overcome
Agassi in the third round last
Thursday by a 1-6, 7-6, 6-1 score
and his success continued into this
week's U.S Hardcourts in In
dianapolis.
Tuesday he defeated Rick Leach
6-4, 6-7, 7-5 in the opening round

and Loach said it was Whcaton's
new-found confidence that carried
him through the tough spots in
their match.
"He knows he's going to win
those big points," Leach said.
"When it got close he wasn't up
tight, he just went for it."
Wheaton is older than both
Chang and Agassi. "I just turned
20, I'm not 11 years old like Mi
chael Chang," he said, jokingly.
And while he's way behind them
in the rankings at No. 60 — Chang
and Agassi arc in the top 10 —
he's catching up fast. A week ago
Wheaton was ranked 126 th in the

world.
Wheaton turned pro a year ago
after helping Stanford win the
NCAA team championship. Me
played three Nabisco Grand Prix
events last summer, but never got
past the first round.
The Deephaven, Minn., resi
dent said he got a jolt of reality
when he expected to be among
the world's top 100 players within
months of turning pro.
Before last week, Whcaton's
highest career singles ranking was
278 th in September 1987.
"After a few months getting
kicked around, I quickly learned

that it's a lot tougher than it ap
pears to be," he said. "I've had to
work hard for a full year now to
get where I am."
But his victory over Agassi put
Wheaton on a roll that he hopes
will continue at least through the
U.S. Open, which begins Aug. 28.
"1 expect myself to play better,"
he said. "Now when 1 go out
against people, I'm going to think
I really deserve to beat them."
At the Stratton Mountain
event, former Stanford star Jim
Grabb also put in an excellent
showing. Grabb bested Chang in
the quarterfinals 6-2, 6-4.

mentioned as one of three men
who will lead American tennis
into the 1990s — along with
Agassi and Michael Chang.
Whcaton, who played here in
1988, reached the semifinals in
Stratton Mountain before falling
to Brad Gilbert — who would go
on to win the tournament — by
a score of 5-7, 7-6, 6-4. In the
second set, Whcaton was serving
for the match but came up short.
"I was very close to beating Gil
bert," he said. "1 feel very confident
right now. ; That was a big
breakthrough for me.
"It was a combination of him
(raising) his game a little bit and
me being a little nervous and a

little tentative. I missed a couple
of shots when I needed to make
them, and usually I do make those
shots."
Gilbert said of his opponent:
"He has a big serve and does a
lot of things well. I think for him
to make the big improvement like
Chang or Agassi, he needs to have
more speed."
Wheaton concurs. "I'm going
to have to get in better shape,"
he said. "So at 6-5 in the third
set or at four-all in the fifth set
in a Grand Slam, I feel almost as
fresh as I did in the first set."
Still, Wheaton did overcome
Agassi in the third round last
Thursday by a 1-6, 7-6, 6-1 score
and his success continued into this
week's U.S Hardcourts in In
dianapolis.
Tuesday he defeated Rick Leach
6-4, 6-7, 7-5 in the opening round

and Loach said it was Whcaton's
new-found confidence that carried
him through the tough spots in
their match.
"He knows he's going to win
those big points," Leach said.
"When it got close he wasn't up
tight, he just went for it."
Wheaton is older than both
Chang and Agassi. "I just turned
20, I'm not 11 years old like Mi
chael Chang," he said, jokingly.
And while he's way behind them
in the rankings at No. 60 — Chang
and Agassi arc in the top 10 —
he's catching up fast. A week ago
Wheaton was ranked 126 th in the

world.
Wheaton turned pro a year ago
after helping Stanford win the
NCAA team championship. Me
played three Nabisco Grand Prix
events last summer, but never got
past the first round.
The Deephaven, Minn., resi
dent said he got a jolt of reality
when he expected to be among
the world's top 100 players within
months of turning pro.
Before last week, Whcaton's
highest career singles ranking was
278 th in September 1987.
"After a few months getting
kicked around, I quickly learned

that it's a lot tougher than it ap
pears to be," he said. "I've had to
work hard for a full year now to
get where I am."
But his victory over Agassi put
Wheaton on a roll that he hopes
will continue at least through the
U.S. Open, which begins Aug. 28.
"1 expect myself to play better,"
he said. "Now when 1 go out
against people, I'm going to think
I really deserve to beat them."
At the Stratton Mountain
event, former Stanford star Jim
Grabb also put in an excellent
showing. Grabb bested Chang in
the quarterfinals 6-2, 6-4.
Question: Which institution of
higher learning turns out more
world-class tennis players than an
average sized nation?

The answer, of course, is Stan
ford University. And, this past
week David Wheaton and Tami
Whitlinger stepped out of the
ranks of the unknown and into
the limelight.
Whitlinger, the leader of the

women's teams that won national
titles in 1988 and '89, is currently
in the third round of the $300,000
Virginia Slims of Los Angeles.
Yesterday, Whitlinger knocked
off Sweden's Maria Lindstrom 6-4,
6-3. In the opening round, she
scored a stunning upset over 11th
seeded Lori McNeil 7-6, 6-1.
McNeil is ranked 24th in the
world.
Whitlinger told The Daily in
May she was planning on turning
pro this summer. After a disap
pointing showing at the NCAA
tournament, however, she decided
to delay any announcement. A
strong showing in the coming
weeks would no doubt influence
her decision about returning to
Stanford.
Also in action at Los Angeles
were Whidinger's teammates
Sandra Birch and Debbie Graham.
In the opening round, Birch faced
