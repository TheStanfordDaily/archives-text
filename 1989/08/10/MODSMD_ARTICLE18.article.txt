# The
						Stanford Actors Project scrutinizes society
## Project directors Reid Edelman and Cliff Mayotte talk to The Weekly about truth and theater 
### Anita Schneider 
Even before he came to Stan
ford, Reid Edelman, now artistic
director of the Stanford Actors
Project, had his eye on professional
theater.
1 le chose to attend Stanford
over other schools because of its
small drama department, which
gave him a chance to direct a lot
of plays and start important work
"pretty much right away."
In 1986, as a senior in English
and drama, Edelman directed the
award-winning campus production
of Steinbeck's "Of Mice and Men."
That show caused Edelman and
others to think seriously about
putting a professional acting com
pany together.
Edelman went on to obtain his
master's degree at Rutgers Univer
sity's Professional Actor Training
Program. When he returned to
California he decided it was time
to launch the Stanford Actors
Project.
Cliff Mayotte — whom Edelman
met at the American Conservatory
Theater in 1984 and who played
Lenny in "Of Mice and Men" —
is the project's associate director.
Both serve on the Stanford Actors
Project board of directors along
with seven others, six of them
Stanford alumni.
It's the company's second
season, and the directors feel it's
going well. "What we try to do,"

Mayotte says, "is strike a balance
between alumni and current stu
dents from Stanford, and students
or actors who are just getting out
of other training programs. The
gap between college and profes
sional theater is gigantic, and we
try to get a bridge going. Those
of us who have had a lot of ex
perience inspire and teach the
younger actors, and they do the
same for us."
Informal ties still exist between
the project and Stanford faculty
and administrators. "Ever since 'Of
Mice and Men,' (Drama Prof.)
Charles Lyons has been a mentor
figure," says Edelman. "He's our
dramaturge and advisor." Though
Lyons doesn't select their plays,
he offers insight and positive rein
forcement. "He's a real acad
emician, so he provides the other
slant — because Cliff and I both
come from a very practical side.
"Alex Stewart, the technical di
rector at the Drama Department,
was important in putting on 'Of
Mice and Men.' And Judy Slater,
who runs Student Organization
Services, arranged rehearsal space
for free, got our insurance to per
form in San Francisco and handled
all the little details that came up
... the University as a whole has
been incredibly supportive."
