# The 						Stanford Actors Project scrutinizes society
## Project directors Reid Edelman and Cliff Mayotte talk to The Weekly about truth and theater 
### Anita Schneider 
Even before he came to Stan
ford, Reid Edelman, now artistic
director of the Stanford Actors
Project, had his eye on professional
theater.
1 le chose to attend Stanford
over other schools because of its
small drama department, which
gave him a chance to direct a lot
of plays and start important work
"pretty much right away."
In 1986, as a senior in English
and drama, Edelman directed the
award-winning campus production
of Steinbeck's "Of Mice and Men."
That show caused Edelman and
others to think seriously about
putting a professional acting com
pany together.
Edelman went on to obtain his
master's degree at Rutgers Univer
sity's Professional Actor Training
Program. When he returned to
California he decided it was time
to launch the Stanford Actors
Project.
Cliff Mayotte — whom Edelman
met at the American Conservatory
Theater in 1984 and who played
Lenny in "Of Mice and Men" —
is the project's associate director.
Both serve on the Stanford Actors
Project board of directors along
with seven others, six of them
Stanford alumni.
It's the company's second
season, and the directors feel it's
going well. "What we try to do,"

Mayotte says, "is strike a balance
between alumni and current stu
dents from Stanford, and students
or actors who are just getting out
of other training programs. The
gap between college and profes
sional theater is gigantic, and we
try to get a bridge going. Those
of us who have had a lot of ex
perience inspire and teach the
younger actors, and they do the
same for us."
Informal ties still exist between
the project and Stanford faculty
and administrators. "Ever since 'Of
Mice and Men,' (Drama Prof.)
Charles Lyons has been a mentor
figure," says Edelman. "He's our
dramaturge and advisor." Though
Lyons doesn't select their plays,
he offers insight and positive rein
forcement. "He's a real acad
emician, so he provides the other
slant — because Cliff and I both
come from a very practical side.
"Alex Stewart, the technical di
rector at the Drama Department,
was important in putting on 'Of
Mice and Men.' And Judy Slater,
who runs Student Organization
Services, arranged rehearsal space
for free, got our insurance to per
form in San Francisco and handled
all the little details that came up
... the University as a whole has
been incredibly supportive."

help us day to day and make things
possible," says Mayottc. "What
they make possible for theatergoers
arc productions of the best classic
American plays, while not present
ing them as museum pieces. We're
really interested in putting our
own spin on it and making it
relevant now."
Perhaps that's why Mayotte has
chosen to direct Lanford Wilson's
"The Rimers of Eldritch," and Ed
ward Albee's "Box" and "Ameri
can Dream." He views "American
Dream" as a "condemning portrait
of the vacuity and complacency
of American families."
"['The American Dream') is far
more realistic than most people
would care to admit," says
Mayotte, who worked closely with
Albee in 1987. "I see our national
dream life — two kids, a Volvo,
life in the country and a VCR —
becoming more distorted and
empty each day."
"Our nickname for our season
is 'Confronting America,'" Edel
man adds. '"The Rimers of
Eldritch' confronts the hypocrisy
of people who claim to be good,
pious and patriotic, and who are
really cruel, deceitful and mur
derous. Skelly (played by Mayotte)
is a disgusting, grotesque person
on the outside, yet he's the only
person in the town with any real
values and sense of conscience.
"Just as we began rehearsing
these plays about truth vs. myth
and reality vs. hypocrisy, (there)
was the whole Supreme Court
thing with the flag burning. Not
that 1 advocate burning the flag,
because that's incredibly offensive

to mc, yet the only thing more
offensive is curtailing the right to
burn it because then the flag
doesn't mean anything.
"It's the same thing in these
plays — what's more important,
the symbol or the reality? What's
more important in 'The Rimers of
Eldritch' — the fact that these
people proclaim themselves to be
holy and good, or how they act
and what they really do?"
Edelman thinks the theater
should not only entertain and ed
ucate an audience, but also inspire
them. "What I look for in a play
is that it in some way reflects a
universal sense of who we are —
our humanity. If I find the play
beautiful, or if something in it
moves me, it's going to make me
want to direct it."
Edelman feels strongly that
theaters don't compete with one
another and insists, "The more
good theater there is, the more
people will want to go. Our biggest
competition is with the VCR and
television set."
When asked what he thinks are
the ingredients for a successful
company, Edelman replies, "Cliff
and I were discussing the next
season — talking about whether
we'd want to do Shakespeare, and
I said, 'Gosh, 1 don't know if we're
ready for doing Shakespeare at this
point — a whole Shakespearean
play!'
"Cliff said, The moment we
start being afraid to fail — that's
it. The theater company is over.'
And that's very right.
"I think that we can't approach
it with an attitude of 'well, what
can we do to be successful,' but
challenge ourselves, and if we're
not afraid to fail, that's the best
thing we could do for the com
pany."

"So far so good," adds Mayottc.
"A lot of theater companies sur
vive and a lot don't, and ! think
we've got a real good shot at it."

"The Rimers of Eldritch," "American
Dream" and "Box" will run in reper
tory at the Intersection for the Arts,
766 Valencia Street, San Francisco,
from Aug. 11 through Sept. 3. Tick
ets are $10. Box office numbers are
626-3311 and 563-1431.

competition is with the VCR and
television set."
When asked what he thinks are
the ingredients for a successful
company, Edelman replies, "Cliff
and I were discussing the next
season — talking about whether
we'd want to do Shakespeare, and
I said, 'Gosh, 1 don't know if we're
ready for doing Shakespeare at this
point — a whole Shakespearean
play!'
"Cliff said, The moment we
start being afraid to fail — that's
it. The theater company is over.'
And that's very right.
"I think that we can't approach
it with an attitude of 'well, what
can we do to be successful,' but
challenge ourselves, and if we're
not afraid to fail, that's the best
thing we could do for the com
pany."

"So far so good," adds Mayottc.
"A lot of theater companies sur
vive and a lot don't, and ! think
we've got a real good shot at it."

"The Rimers of Eldritch," "American
Dream" and "Box" will run in reper
tory at the Intersection for the Arts,
766 Valencia Street, San Francisco,
from Aug. 11 through Sept. 3. Tick
ets are $10. Box office numbers are
626-3311 and 563-1431.
Even before he came to Stan
ford, Reid Edelman, now artistic
director of the Stanford Actors
Project, had his eye on professional
theater.
1 le chose to attend Stanford
over other schools because of its
small drama department, which
gave him a chance to direct a lot
of plays and start important work
"pretty much right away."
In 1986, as a senior in English
and drama, Edelman directed the
award-winning campus production
of Steinbeck's "Of Mice and Men."
That show caused Edelman and
others to think seriously about
putting a professional acting com
pany together.
Edelman went on to obtain his
master's degree at Rutgers Univer
sity's Professional Actor Training
Program. When he returned to
California he decided it was time
to launch the Stanford Actors
Project.
Cliff Mayotte — whom Edelman
met at the American Conservatory
Theater in 1984 and who played
Lenny in "Of Mice and Men" —
is the project's associate director.
Both serve on the Stanford Actors
Project board of directors along
with seven others, six of them
Stanford alumni.
It's the company's second
season, and the directors feel it's
going well. "What we try to do,"

Mayotte says, "is strike a balance
between alumni and current stu
dents from Stanford, and students
or actors who are just getting out
of other training programs. The
gap between college and profes
sional theater is gigantic, and we
try to get a bridge going. Those
of us who have had a lot of ex
perience inspire and teach the
younger actors, and they do the
same for us."
Informal ties still exist between
the project and Stanford faculty
and administrators. "Ever since 'Of
Mice and Men,' (Drama Prof.)
Charles Lyons has been a mentor
figure," says Edelman. "He's our
dramaturge and advisor." Though
Lyons doesn't select their plays,
he offers insight and positive rein
forcement. "He's a real acad
emician, so he provides the other
slant — because Cliff and I both
come from a very practical side.
"Alex Stewart, the technical di
rector at the Drama Department,
was important in putting on 'Of
Mice and Men.' And Judy Slater,
who runs Student Organization
Services, arranged rehearsal space
for free, got our insurance to per
form in San Francisco and handled
all the little details that came up
... the University as a whole has
been incredibly supportive."

help us day to day and make things
possible," says Mayottc. "What
they make possible for theatergoers
arc productions of the best classic
American plays, while not present
ing them as museum pieces. We're
really interested in putting our
own spin on it and making it
relevant now."
Perhaps that's why Mayotte has
chosen to direct Lanford Wilson's
"The Rimers of Eldritch," and Ed
ward Albee's "Box" and "Ameri
can Dream." He views "American
Dream" as a "condemning portrait
of the vacuity and complacency
of American families."
"['The American Dream') is far
more realistic than most people
would care to admit," says
Mayotte, who worked closely with
Albee in 1987. "I see our national
dream life — two kids, a Volvo,
life in the country and a VCR —
becoming more distorted and
empty each day."
"Our nickname for our season
is 'Confronting America,'" Edel
man adds. '"The Rimers of
Eldritch' confronts the hypocrisy
of people who claim to be good,
pious and patriotic, and who are
really cruel, deceitful and mur
derous. Skelly (played by Mayotte)
is a disgusting, grotesque person
on the outside, yet he's the only
person in the town with any real
values and sense of conscience.
"Just as we began rehearsing
these plays about truth vs. myth
and reality vs. hypocrisy, (there)
was the whole Supreme Court
thing with the flag burning. Not
that 1 advocate burning the flag,
because that's incredibly offensive

to mc, yet the only thing more
offensive is curtailing the right to
burn it because then the flag
doesn't mean anything.
"It's the same thing in these
plays — what's more important,
the symbol or the reality? What's
more important in 'The Rimers of
Eldritch' — the fact that these
people proclaim themselves to be
holy and good, or how they act
and what they really do?"
Edelman thinks the theater
should not only entertain and ed
ucate an audience, but also inspire
them. "What I look for in a play
is that it in some way reflects a
universal sense of who we are —
our humanity. If I find the play
beautiful, or if something in it
moves me, it's going to make me
want to direct it."
Edelman feels strongly that
theaters don't compete with one
another and insists, "The more
good theater there is, the more
people will want to go. Our biggest
competition is with the VCR and
television set."
When asked what he thinks are
