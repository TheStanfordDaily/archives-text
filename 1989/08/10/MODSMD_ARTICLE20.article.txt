Listening to Bauhaus
watching a good horror
Sometimes we need an...fcacape

world we enter is dark Jscnry.

world, populated hy vampires, in
sane men and irratiJpl fears.
Their attitude gained them a huge
underground cult follo\Sjig that's
still thriving. Their inflnlnce on
the post-punk music smne is
profound. Yk
Now that three former melflbers
of Bauhaus — Daniel Ash,
J and Kevin 1 laskins — are
ginning to achieve commercial
success with Love and Rockets, it
seems the perfect time to resurrect
the legacy of Bauhaus from the
grave.

Ten years after the hand's
formation and first single? "Bela

ffilly release of a num
ber of session, recorded at the
BBC London. These
sessions, relfas<rd together by Beg

provides a bass line on "She's in
Parties" as chilling as the gaze he
habitually gives from behind black
sunglasses. And Peter Murphy's
voice pierces into your soul, resid
ing there to narrate your worst
nightmares.
Why should you listen to
Bauhaus? These BBC sessions cap-
essence of Bauhaus, at
some most creative and
insightful moments. They provide
ap antidote from the past for those
lost in today's superficial pop
music scene.
