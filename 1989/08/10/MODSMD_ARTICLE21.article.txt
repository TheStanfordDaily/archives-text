# Little brilliance in 'Einstein'
## 
### Evan Tuchinsky Staff writer 
Well, 1 guess the streak had to
end sometime.
So far this summer, 1 have seen
about a dozen movies without en
countering a dud. A tew were dis
appointing, hut none were terrible.
1 hen I went to see "Young
Einstein," which easily rates as the
worst movie of the year. In fact,
it is one of the five worst films
of the decade, eclipsed in ugliness
only by the atrocious sci-fi killer
"Krull."
I he sad thing is the filmmaker
actually wanted to do a good job.

In his motion picture debut, ac
tor/writer/priKlucer/director Yahoo
Serious obviously put some care
into his work, adding an abun
dance of subtle details to enhance
the humor.
Einstein moves into a room on
Lonely Street; Charles Darwin's
dog is named Beagle; Einstein is
committed to the Mad Scientists'
ward of the Lunatic Asylum (the
name of which ts clearly visible
on the gate). These are ntce —
albeit hackneyed — touches.
But the sprinkling of spice could
not transform the bland movie into
an enticing film. Even with
Serious' flourishes, "Young

Einstein" is tedious and utterly
unbelievable.
Einstein is portrayed as an apple
farmer's son in Tasmania, which
explains Einstein's Australian ac
cent. After discovering relativity
in 1906 to put bubbles in beer,
Albert sets oft to Sydney to patent
his work.
Along the way he meets and
tails in love with Marie Curie (yes,
the mother ot radioactivity). He
also meets the theory-thief Preston
Preston, whom he grows to hate.
It is easy to figure out what
happens from there - it's the old
"slimy bad guy vs. brilliant but
gullible hero." Einstein has to
make the most of old Grandpa
Einstein's research about splitting
"beer atoms," and Preston does
his best to take off with the goods.
It's a worn-out plotline, but you'd
hope that Serious would be able
to overcome the shortcomings
with a little Aussie charm.
Unfortunately, his Einstein is a
zany acrobat who delivers poten
tially funny lines without putting
anything into them. It reminded
me of that old Robin Williams
bomb "Popeye" — a film that had
its moments, but when it should
have been loose and delightful, it
was too ambitious and ended up
being bland.
Perhaps Serious bit off more
than he could chew when he
decided to make his movie basi
cally by himself. Perhaps his in
experience made him see brilliance
where I sec mediocrity.
Whatever the reason, the result
is more than disappointing — it's
abysmal.
"Young Einstein"? Yahoo, get
serious.
