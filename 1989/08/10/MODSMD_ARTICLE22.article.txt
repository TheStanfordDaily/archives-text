## Stanford prof. produces wine in his backyard

You might drive all the way to Napa
Valley to see grapes crushed into wine.
Vince D'Andrea, staff psychiatrist at Coun
seling and Psychological Services, prefers
to stay in his own backyard.
D'Andrea is an amateur wine maker.
Each year, he produces over 40 bottles of
wine in a process that has become a family
tradition, an event that he likens to decorat
ing a Christmas tree.
"The entire family plus friends take part
in the wine making," says I)'Andrea, who
is also a clinical professor of psychiatry and
behavioral sciences. "There are very few
things that you can do nowadays where
you're in a tradition that goes back cen
turies."
D'Andrea says that when he makes wine,
he perpetuates his Italian heritage.
"Most Italians are very familiar with
wine," he says."It goes without saying. It
would be like saying, 'do you like pasta or
olive oil?' Of course you do. (When you're
Italian), wine is part of your life, or it's
part of your background."
D'Andrea's first association with wine
began when he was a child in Philadelphia,
when his family made wine in their base
ment.

"I remember standing on the staircase
watching them crush grapes," he says."I
was too young to know what they were
doing, but old enough to realize it was
important."
"When I came out here, it took a long
time to realize that California was full of
grape vines. I was so busy being an intern,*
married and then having kids."
D'Andrea's neighbors rekindled his in
terest in wine making about 20 years ago
when they brought home grapes from Ridge
Vineyards in Cupertino. Ridge Vineyards
was one of the first American wineries to
start producing wine "European style," in
small barrels instead of long redwood vats.
"T hat's the way I learned to make wine,"
says D'Andrea. "My wines have a very Eu
ropean character. They have a lot of fruit
and richness."
Between mid-September and Halloween,
the grapes, for which D'Andrea places an
order months in advance, are ready for the
ritual crushing.
Outside the wine shed in his backyard,
D'Andrea starts the festive process by
removing the stems of the grapes with a
piece of equipment that resembles a Chinese
checkers board — full of half-inch holes.

you're Italian, wine is part of your life, it's part of
your background.' — Prof. Vince D'Andrea
