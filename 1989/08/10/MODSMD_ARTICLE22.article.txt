## Stanford prof. produces wine in his backyard 
### Karen Kramer Staff writer 
You might drive all the way to Napa
Valley to see grapes crushed into wine.
Vince D'Andrea, staff psychiatrist at Coun
seling and Psychological Services, prefers
to stay in his own backyard.
D'Andrea is an amateur wine maker.
Each year, he produces over 40 bottles of
wine in a process that has become a family
tradition, an event that he likens to decorat
ing a Christmas tree.
"The entire family plus friends take part
in the wine making," says I)'Andrea, who
is also a clinical professor of psychiatry and
behavioral sciences. "There are very few
things that you can do nowadays where
you're in a tradition that goes back cen
turies."
D'Andrea says that when he makes wine,
he perpetuates his Italian heritage.
"Most Italians are very familiar with
wine," he says."It goes without saying. It
would be like saying, 'do you like pasta or
olive oil?' Of course you do. (When you're
Italian), wine is part of your life, or it's
part of your background."
D'Andrea's first association with wine
began when he was a child in Philadelphia,
when his family made wine in their base
ment.

"I remember standing on the staircase
watching them crush grapes," he says."I
was too young to know what they were
doing, but old enough to realize it was
important."
"When I came out here, it took a long
time to realize that California was full of
grape vines. I was so busy being an intern,*
married and then having kids."
D'Andrea's neighbors rekindled his in
terest in wine making about 20 years ago
when they brought home grapes from Ridge
Vineyards in Cupertino. Ridge Vineyards
was one of the first American wineries to
start producing wine "European style," in
small barrels instead of long redwood vats.
"T hat's the way I learned to make wine,"
says D'Andrea. "My wines have a very Eu
ropean character. They have a lot of fruit
and richness."
Between mid-September and Halloween,
the grapes, for which D'Andrea places an
order months in advance, are ready for the
ritual crushing.
Outside the wine shed in his backyard,
D'Andrea starts the festive process by
removing the stems of the grapes with a
piece of equipment that resembles a Chinese
checkers board — full of half-inch holes.

don't know if you can picture that
many, but there's something very
exciting about seeing a ton of
grapes," he proclaims.
Once stemless, the grapes are
turned into a mixure that
D'Andrea calls a "slurry" and ready
for primary fermentation. He uses
big 50 gallon garbage cans to add
yeast to the grape slurry.
"The gases push the skins to
the top and I keep poking the

skins down until the sugar level
measures right. At this stage it's
all bubbly and steamy and smells
wonderful."
After this "primary fermenta
tion," D'Andrea sends the grape
mixture thorugh a wine press to
compress a cake of skins. The juice
goes into barrels for the trickiest
part of the process — "secondary
fermentation."
"If the wine is not fermented,
it tastes awful," he says. But wine
makers find it harder to tell
whether the juice is ready during
the secondary fermentation, unlike

After two years, the wine is ready to be
bottled. D'Andrea crowns his wine with a
personalized label bearing his family name.

very clear what is going on," he
says.
About two years later, the wine
is ready to be bottled. D'Andrea
crowns his wine bottles with a
personalized label bearing his fam
ily name.
Although making your own

wine requires quite a bit of equip
ment, D'Andrea contends that it
is a cheaper hobby than "golfing
or boating."
Grape prices, however, have
skyrocketed in the past few years.
"When I first stared making wine
the price of grapes was very cheap.
They were cheaper than soda. If
I lost 30 gallons (in a ruined batch)

it was nothing," he says.
Regardless of grape price infla
tion, making your own wine is
much cheaper than buying it from
wineries or ordering it in restau
rants. D'Andrea says he rarely or
ders other wine when dining out.
"My wines are better by far, and
I don't want to pay $40 or $50
for a bottle of wine that costs only
$12 to make."
What does it feel like to drink
your personal wine? "There's a
pride of ownership," says
D'Andrea. "1 feel like 1 pulled a
fast one on the wineries."

exciting about seeing a ton of

Once stemless, the grapes are
turned into a mixure that
D'Andrea calls a "slurry" and ready
for primary fermentation. He uses
big 50 gallon garbage cans to add
yeast to the grape slurry.
"The gases push the skins to
the top and I keep poking the

skins down until the sugar level
measures right. At this stage it's
all bubbly and steamy and smells
wonderful."
After this "primary fermenta
tion," D'Andrea sends the grape
mixture thorugh a wine press to
compress a cake of skins. The juice
goes into barrels for the trickiest
part of the process — "secondary
fermentation."
"If the wine is not fermented,
it tastes awful," he says. But wine
makers find it harder to tell
whether the juice is ready during
the secondary fermentation, unlike

"it's all bubbly and steamy, and
very clear what is going on," he
says.

Although making your own

wine requires quite a bit of equip
ment, D'Andrea contends that it
is a cheaper hobby than "golfing
or boating."
Grape prices, however, have
skyrocketed in the past few years.
"When I first stared making wine
the price of grapes was very cheap.
They were cheaper than soda. If
I lost 30 gallons (in a ruined batch)

it was nothing," he says.
Regardless of grape price infla
tion, making your own wine is
much cheaper than buying it from
wineries or ordering it in restau
rants. D'Andrea says he rarely or
ders other wine when dining out.
"My wines are better by far, and
I don't want to pay $40 or $50
for a bottle of wine that costs only
$12 to make."
What does it feel like to drink
your personal wine? "There's a
pride of ownership," says
D'Andrea. "1 feel like 1 pulled a
fast one on the wineries."
You might drive all the way to Napa
Valley to see grapes crushed into wine.
Vince D'Andrea, staff psychiatrist at Coun
seling and Psychological Services, prefers
to stay in his own backyard.
D'Andrea is an amateur wine maker.
Each year, he produces over 40 bottles of
wine in a process that has become a family
tradition, an event that he likens to decorat
ing a Christmas tree.
"The entire family plus friends take part
in the wine making," says I)'Andrea, who
is also a clinical professor of psychiatry and
behavioral sciences. "There are very few
things that you can do nowadays where
you're in a tradition that goes back cen
turies."
D'Andrea says that when he makes wine,
he perpetuates his Italian heritage.
"Most Italians are very familiar with
wine," he says."It goes without saying. It
would be like saying, 'do you like pasta or
olive oil?' Of course you do. (When you're
Italian), wine is part of your life, or it's
part of your background."
D'Andrea's first association with wine
began when he was a child in Philadelphia,
when his family made wine in their base
ment.

"I remember standing on the staircase
watching them crush grapes," he says."I
was too young to know what they were
doing, but old enough to realize it was
important."
"When I came out here, it took a long
time to realize that California was full of
grape vines. I was so busy being an intern,*
married and then having kids."
D'Andrea's neighbors rekindled his in
terest in wine making about 20 years ago
when they brought home grapes from Ridge
Vineyards in Cupertino. Ridge Vineyards
was one of the first American wineries to
start producing wine "European style," in
small barrels instead of long redwood vats.
"T hat's the way I learned to make wine,"
says D'Andrea. "My wines have a very Eu
ropean character. They have a lot of fruit
and richness."
Between mid-September and Halloween,
the grapes, for which D'Andrea places an
order months in advance, are ready for the
ritual crushing.
Outside the wine shed in his backyard,
D'Andrea starts the festive process by
removing the stems of the grapes with a
piece of equipment that resembles a Chinese
checkers board — full of half-inch holes.
