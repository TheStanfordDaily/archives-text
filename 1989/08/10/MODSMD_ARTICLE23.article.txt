### Dani Beazer 
Over the Other Side of the Country

I
Walking home
he recalls a lover
from college days.
The leaves, curled and wet,
remind him.
It has been years;
no name comes to mind.
Indoors he sits by the window
studying the curtains.
A cat jumps to his lap
she paws on his chest.
Stroking her spine,
" lahti — to what do I owe this pleasure?'
II
What were his best years?
He thinks,
and cannot put them all in one.
A time when he was ten
watching his father
tie wires for the fencing,
tying them so tightly
his palms were flushed with the effort
and suddenly he misses his father.
The birth of his son
the tiny feet fanned like angel's wings
(then Melinda leaving
taking the boy).
A girl in a bar, not over 25,
asked him between puffs on a Lucky,
"So, like, what's it like at 40?"
"The same as 20, only paunchier."
Of course she laughed and as they danced
she whispered to his carlobe
how she could take off ten years.

The Next Day
Of all the days, his was the quietest.
No morning ever rose with such slow colors
the saffron hues fanning open the sky,
lengthening over the Blue Ridge;
resting on frosted barbed wire;
pale, splintered posts,
the diadems in the dying grass;
tilling frozen hoof prints made by
cows nudging and rubbing to crop
the blades over the fence before
the air turned winter gray,
before the ground, like poured plaster,
stiffened.
Through the doorway I watched this day come
remembering all the night before
when I pressed by forehead against the glass
trying to find a face somewhere
in the moon.

He remembers waking to a movement from her
and watching her pad to the window
before morning really came.
She breathed on the glass
and formed a round kiss
that would dirty the pane
when the mist disappeared.
She stood there for minutes
goose bumps rising along her legs.
1 le imagined her breasts firming to the cold
but she stood there for minutes
and never really came back.
IV
Outside the rain crackles —
red from the brake lights of passing cars
red from the ABC store's neon sign down the street
red from the wet brick doorstep
incubating under the porch light.
And so they were gone.
He had lost them somewhere
behind the fences, the window
the angel's wings.
Cold mornings and warm ones
wet nights like this
a cat, a curtain
a nameless lover
living somewhere
over the other side of the country.

Joshua Tree
In Virginia, rows of lilacs
that had flowered for fifty years
steeped the yard each spring
with their sweet clustered blossoms.
In Virginia, our father's hillside grave
overlooks what can he seen of Charlottesville
in spring behind the green and white
lattice of dogwood.
But your name is a tree from this desert
I cried to see beneath the airplane —
rippled mountains, hard and brown,
like reptiles sleeping in the sun.
You where named for great-grandfather
Joshua Booth
whose mother never returned
when she strayed from the wagon train
of Mormon pioneers, to pick blackberries.
Your name is a tree of tall reaching branches
imploring the blue prairie of sky
to rain down dry-throated gullies
soak cleft mudflats,
incite the Virgin River;
to drench the tamarisk in mother's backyard
and the flowering plum sent from Virginia.
It arrived the day before yesterday,
its curling grape-red leaves thirsting
for moisture in the dry heat.
Yesterday, five cousins and our brother
carried you on their shoulders.
A young boy played Taps as we sang the words
and the May evening sun, leaving
to light the sleeping half of the world
inflamed those ruddy bluffs.

The Labyrinth
a translation of Jorge Borges, "El Laberinto"
Not even Zeus could unravel the stone
nets encircling me. Having forgotten
the men I was before, I follow the hated
path snared by these monotonous walls
which hold my fate. Straight corridors
curving into deceitful circles
till the end of centuries. Parapets
cracked beneath the chisel of days.
In the pale dust, I decipher
tracks that terrify me. These hollow
evenings rage with a bellow
or the echo of a bellow, desolate.
I know the shadows conceal Another
fated to fray the unending loneliness
that weaves and unweaves this Hades,
to yearn for my blood and devour my death.
We seek each other. Oh God, that this
were my last day of waiting.

to drench the tamarisk in mother's backyard
and the flowering plum sent from Virginia.
It arrived the day before yesterday,
its curling grape-red leaves thirsting
for moisture in the dry heat.
Yesterday, five cousins and our brother
carried you on their shoulders.
A young boy played Taps as we sang the words
and the May evening sun, leaving
to light the sleeping half of the world
inflamed those ruddy bluffs.

The Labyrinth
a translation of Jorge Borges, "El Laberinto"
Not even Zeus could unravel the stone
nets encircling me. Having forgotten
the men I was before, I follow the hated
path snared by these monotonous walls
which hold my fate. Straight corridors
curving into deceitful circles
till the end of centuries. Parapets
cracked beneath the chisel of days.
In the pale dust, I decipher
tracks that terrify me. These hollow
evenings rage with a bellow
or the echo of a bellow, desolate.
I know the shadows conceal Another
fated to fray the unending loneliness
that weaves and unweaves this Hades,
to yearn for my blood and devour my death.
We seek each other. Oh God, that this
were my last day of waiting.

Over the Other Side of the Country

I
Walking home
he recalls a lover
from college days.
The leaves, curled and wet,
remind him.
It has been years;
no name comes to mind.
Indoors he sits by the window
studying the curtains.
A cat jumps to his lap
she paws on his chest.
Stroking her spine,
" lahti — to what do I owe this pleasure?'
II
What were his best years?
He thinks,
and cannot put them all in one.
A time when he was ten
watching his father
tie wires for the fencing,
tying them so tightly
his palms were flushed with the effort
and suddenly he misses his father.
The birth of his son
the tiny feet fanned like angel's wings
(then Melinda leaving
taking the boy).
A girl in a bar, not over 25,
asked him between puffs on a Lucky,
"So, like, what's it like at 40?"
"The same as 20, only paunchier."
Of course she laughed and as they danced
she whispered to his carlobe
how she could take off ten years.

The Next Day
Of all the days, his was the quietest.
No morning ever rose with such slow colors
the saffron hues fanning open the sky,
lengthening over the Blue Ridge;
resting on frosted barbed wire;
pale, splintered posts,
the diadems in the dying grass;
tilling frozen hoof prints made by
cows nudging and rubbing to crop
the blades over the fence before
the air turned winter gray,
before the ground, like poured plaster,
stiffened.
Through the doorway I watched this day come
remembering all the night before
when I pressed by forehead against the glass
trying to find a face somewhere
in the moon.

He remembers waking to a movement from her
and watching her pad to the window
before morning really came.
She breathed on the glass
and formed a round kiss
that would dirty the pane
when the mist disappeared.
She stood there for minutes
goose bumps rising along her legs.
1 le imagined her breasts firming to the cold
but she stood there for minutes
and never really came back.
IV
Outside the rain crackles —
red from the brake lights of passing cars
red from the ABC store's neon sign down the street
red from the wet brick doorstep
incubating under the porch light.
And so they were gone.
He had lost them somewhere
behind the fences, the window
the angel's wings.
Cold mornings and warm ones
wet nights like this
a cat, a curtain
a nameless lover
living somewhere
over the other side of the country.

Joshua Tree
In Virginia, rows of lilacs
that had flowered for fifty years
steeped the yard each spring
with their sweet clustered blossoms.
In Virginia, our father's hillside grave
overlooks what can he seen of Charlottesville
in spring behind the green and white
lattice of dogwood.
But your name is a tree from this desert
I cried to see beneath the airplane —
rippled mountains, hard and brown,
like reptiles sleeping in the sun.
You where named for great-grandfather
Joshua Booth
whose mother never returned
when she strayed from the wagon train
of Mormon pioneers, to pick blackberries.
Your name is a tree of tall reaching branches
imploring the blue prairie of sky
to rain down dry-throated gullies
soak cleft mudflats,
incite the Virgin River;
to drench the tamarisk in mother's backyard
and the flowering plum sent from Virginia.
It arrived the day before yesterday,
its curling grape-red leaves thirsting
for moisture in the dry heat.
Yesterday, five cousins and our brother
carried you on their shoulders.
A young boy played Taps as we sang the words
and the May evening sun, leaving
to light the sleeping half of the world
inflamed those ruddy bluffs.
