## Talking 'terrorism': Beverly Allen discusses political violence 
### Mark Weiner Editorial staff 
Beverly Allen doesn't like to
use the word "terrorist." Accord
ing to Allen, the word is ideolog
ical in origin, a product of power
differences between those who use
it and those whom it describes.
An assistant professor in the
Department of French and Italian,
Allen approaches the study of po
litical violence from a distinctly
literary perspective.
Fler course "Postmodern Ter
rorism: Cultures and Perspec
tives," taught through the De
partment of International Rela
tions, draws on her sophisticated
theoretical skills gained from in
tensive study of Italian literature,
particularly the poetry of Andrea
Zanzotto.
Allen received her bachelor's
degree in music from UC-Berkeley
in 1967, after which she performed
piano extensively in Italy. She re
ceived her master's in Italian lan
guage and literature from
Columbia University in 1972, and
her Ph.D. from UC-Berkelely in
1983 in Italian language and litera
ture, with a French minor.
In addition to numerous articles,
Allen has published "Andrea Zan
zotto: The Language of Beauty's
Apprentice" and edited "The
Defiant Muse: Italy's Feminist
Poets." She is currently writing
"Years of Lead: Literature and Ital
ian Terrorism."

Many members of the Stanford
community will remember Allen
as the organizer of the February
1988 conference, "Talking Terror
ism: Ideologies and Paradigms in
a Post-Modern World."
Prof. Allen was denied tenure
last spring. She is appealing the
decision.
You've called "terrorism" the
"most literary of violent political
acts." What do you mean by that
description?
First of all, let me clarify that
when I use the word "terrorism,"
I'm quoting other people's use of
it. 1 have a very difficult time
giving that word status other than
that of a cipher, because I haven't
yet found a definition that suits
me, one that covers all the in
stances in which that word is ap
plied.
1 tend to think of the word as
a cipher that tells me nothing
about what it purports to describe,
but instead tells me something
about the ideology of the person
who's using it.
But to answer your question,
what's called "terrorism" is the
most literary of violent political
acts because its efficacity depends
on the degree to which it gets its
message across.
For example, the difference be
tween a "terrorist" killing and an
assassination would be that the
assassination accomplishes its aim
in the murder it enacts, whereas

what we call terrorism might kill
someone, hut the effect of that
act wouldn't be the death of that
person. It would be making a
whole group of people who identify
with that person feel threatened.
The ways in which that message
gets across can be described in
terms of rhetoric. You can think
of it as a text, a text in fact
dependent on simile, in which a
body of people feels threatened
because tney are in some way like
the victim, whether that body of
people is Italian communist
magistrates or American tourists
in Europe.
There's no reason, other than
this diffuse spreading of the simile,
for American tourists in Europe
to feel threatened. More people
died in 1985 by lightning than by
terrorist acts. It's very important
to keep those things in mind.
You called "terrorism" a "cip
her." Why?
It's a cipher because it doesn't
work the way a sign normally does.
I'll describe it in traditional semi
otic terms. Normally, you have a
signifier that points to some kind
of signified, which in turn points
to a referent in the real world.
With the term "terrorism," that
relay system doesn't work.
What I can know from hearing
the word "terrorism," then, is very
little about what it purports to
describe. I can know, rather, some

thing about the ideology of the
person who uses it.
So our representations of the
"other" say more about "us"
than about those who we
describe. . .
Certainly many representations
of political violence say much
more about the people who are
creating them than about the
people they supposedly describe.
Definitely.
What do contemporary
representations of terrorism in
the media say about those people
who are portraying political vio
lence?
You're as much an observer as
I. Isn't it evident? Especially when
you look at numbers. 1 mean,
there's horror involved in the kil
ling of a hostage, but what makes
that death the object of so much
attention on the part of the gov
ernment, whereas all sorts of
deaths in this country — by
poverty or starvation, say — go
unnoticed?
We have to start asking our
selves the question, "How does
the presentation that we receive
of an event work backwards? Who
in the end benefits from it?" The
government does not describe, for
example, death by starvation in
this country as "terrorism." It docs
not describe legal execution as
"terrorism." It does not call bom
bings of Planned Parenthood
clinics "terrorism."
The notion of legitimacy is in
extricably connected to the notion
of "terrorism." People who engage
in what gets called "terrorism" are
striving to legitimize their de
mands and the people who refuse
them are saying that those de
mands simply aren't legitimate, pe
riod.
If any degree of legitimacy were
granted to the demands, then
there could be other ways found
than violence to deal with those
demands.
It's a very interesting question
of legitimacy on both sides. What
do you do for example in a case
like Germany, where the activities
of the Baader-Meihnoff gang threw
the notion of democracy into a
tailspin? In a country where the
notion of democracy was ex
tremely important and considered
to be fairly fragile after Nazism, it
was necessary to safeguard the
constitutional rights of the people

who had been arrested. At the
same time, these "terrorists" could
not be tolerated — hence their
"suicides" while in prison.
You know, I've been so sad,
unspeakably sad in the last couple
of days watching television, be
cause what I see are the same
experts over and over again. The
other night on "Nightline," 1 saw
1 lenry Kissinger utilizing principles
of good management to deal with
the current hostage situation in
Lebanon. It was a simulation of
what he would do if he were still
in his official role.
It was like a corporate meeting,
a bunch of corporate executives
— all white men — talking, iden
tifying what he called "our aims"
and how to best achieve those
aims and what to do with public
relations after that.
At no point in this scenario
was history invoked. If you call
an act a terrorist act, the first
thing you do is abrogate history.
That cipher says that there's this
essential quality of being a terrorist
that is so unspeakably awful that
history matters not a whit, whereas
if we take a look at history, we
find that these same acts that at
times are called terrorism at other
times are called war or freedom
fighting or uprisings.
I think it matters very much to
start noticing these things. Prob
lems that are caused by this kind
of political violence arc unsolvable
by current means, because the
ideologies of their representations
go unchallenged, because they go
unrecognized.
It seems as if people often talk
about political problems that ap
parently can't be solved and say,
"Well, we can't solve it because
we don't have enough knowl
edge" rather than critiquing the
knowledge they do have.
That's right.
It seems as if one of your pri
mary goals is to raise theoretical
consciousness concerning how
knowledge is produced in the
university so that people can
portray and represent with
greater theoretical sophistication.
That was in fact one of the
goals of the "Talking Terrorism"
conference we had here a year
and a half ago. We asked people
from various fields to discuss the
ideologies of their own fields'
representations of political vio-


Alan Ramaley — Daily
Icnce called "terrorism."
It's very hard to do. It's very
hard to bring a self-conscious cri
tique to one's own field, and yet
it's absolutely essential to all of
us to do so. This is at the core
of what's called interdisciplinary
studies.
At that conference, you had
people describe their images of
a terrorist. You've also asked
freshmen how they could dress
their roommates to look like ter
rorists as an exercise through
which students could perceive
the political stereotypes and
cliches they carry with them.
How docs the notion of cliche
figure into your work?
I have found that it's been es
sential to my work to identify
cliches and recognize them as
such. "Cliche" itself in French
means a mold from which typeface
is made. It's the mold that forms
the letter. When the letter comes
out, it makes a sound that sounds
like "cliche." So, supposedly,
cliche is an onomatopoeic word.
This is very interesting, because
cliches have this realistic aura to
them. They're supposed to sound
like reality, just like photography
is supposed to give us reality, but
it always gives us the photogra
pher's vision of reality. So the
notion of cliche, of stereotype, is
very important. When I study Ital
ian novels, over and over again,
the same characters keep turning
up.
What are some of .those char
acters?
I'll give you two.
First, there is the leftist terrorist
as a well-intentioned but muddle
headed young woman whose social
position isn't quite correct. Usually
she's an unwed mother. She has
lots of good intentions, but she
gets "mixed up" with terrorists (as
if she had no volition of her own)
and begins some kind of clandes
tine existence.
During that time we, the
readers, realize how smart she is,
and we see that she as a woman
is in a situation as oppressed as
it was before. In one novel that
I consider an archetype, the
woman becomes the sex object for
a leading male member of this
clandestine group, and she is also
expected to cook.
The roles are very traditional,
bourgeois, family, gender-deter
mincd roles. The reader knows
that the woman is very smart be
cause we get access to her interior
monologues. I ler cohorts don't
know that and they don't let her

have a determinant role.
Finally, she begins to realize that
her situation is not fair and, in
fact, that it's highly hypocritical.
Then, often (and I've seen this in
novels of different countries as
well) the woman has an awakening
in which she realizes that terrorism
is a mistake and what she really
should he is a feminist.
Now here we have lots of cliches
at work. We have the cliche of
"terrorism," we have the cliche of
the oppressed woman, and we
have this cliche of feminism.
Feminism, for instance, is repre
sented as being better than ter
rorism because number one, it's
not violent. It comes out as being
more appropriate, more ladylike
somehow.
The other cliche is the cliche
of the neo-fascist terrorist, who is
always a man. He's generally
middle-aged, generally not very at
tractive, and generally there's
something perverse about his
sexuality. He's cither a voyeur or
he's a sadist or he has some other
perversion in his erotic being.
Somehow this makes him recog
nizable to the reader as being
fascist.
It's a curious cliche that the
fascism that these novels present
as an evil should be so eroticized,
as if fascism were so easy to rec
ognize all the time. The cliches
of the leftist terrorists, incidental
ly, are often very eroticized as well,
but they're not generally so tradi
tionally perverse. They're generally
more like the kind of eros we
want film stars to project.
I think of the public's percep
tion of the Weather Under
ground's Bernadine Dohrn as a
sexual dynamo and the public's
fascination with the Weather
Underground's sexual activi
ties. . .
It's very significant you should
say this. There's a book that many
people consider to be authoritative
called "The Terror Network," by
Claire Sterling, that contains some
of the most glaring examples ot
the erotic cliches of representa
tions of political violence, espe
cially where (the author) talks
about the Germans' activities.
The author's fascination with
the participants extends to how
one of them was so attractive that
women were dying to jump into
bed with him, etc., etc. What does
that have to do with anything?
There's all this fascination with
what Robin Morgan calls "the
demon lover." Like the word "ter
rorism," Sterling's description tells
me more about the author than
about the person she is purportedly

describing. It's very important to
recognize this phenomenon.
When I was preparing the
"Talking Terrorism" conference, a
fellow from the I loover Institute
called me at 11:30 one evening
to tell me, "Miss Allen, how can
you have a conference on terror
ism without inviting my friends?"
I'm sure that he's organized con
ferences without inviting my
friends, but I asked him who his
friends were, and one of them
was, in fact, Claire Sterling.
The kind of approach that she
takes is so full of cliche, so full
of all the unrecognized ideologies
of representation, that I felt com
pelled to find a new way to ap
proach the issue.
It seems as if the position that
"everything is representational"
— and thus ideological — can
lead to a political paralysis. Is
there a way in which there can
be "true representation?"
This is a very hard question to
answer. I think probably all rep
resentation is indicative of some
world view. When I call that ideol
ogy, I do so in the sense that the
French sociologist Pierre Bourdieu
talks about ideology — the idea
that ideology is not so much the
huge category of, say, capitalist or
communist or Republican or Dem
ocrat, but is really this fabric of
our daily lives.
Ideology shows up in things we
take for granted, choices we make
that we don't even recognize as
choices — the things we do as a
matter of course. That course is
the site of what I call ideology,
and that's what I'm interested in
investigating. That's what I'm
doing with Italian literature and
that's what I'm doing by extension
with the social text.
Are there ways, though, in
which a person who comes from
a particular perspective can tran
scend that perspective when rep
resenting others?
I sec what you're getting at.
This is a very important question.
One could decide never to repre
sent "others." One should, I think,
be very aware of what it means
to consider someone else an
"other."
In any case, I think that the
most hopeful attempts at getting
beyond a particular perspective —
the sort of truly ideological per
spective, the kind that one doesn't
recognize as being ideological —
is to understand the ideologies of
representation of conventional
cultural production. First to un
derstand those and then to choose

from among those some unex
pected combinations.
For example, after the Moro kil
ling in Italy, when the government
gave enough support to the
carabinieri to arrest a lot of people,
a whole generation of participants
in this violence went to prison.
One in particular, in exchange for
a clean passport and a ticket to
Switzerland, gave many names of
other people whom he accused of
being "terrorists."
As a consequence, dozens of
left intellectuals in Italy were ar
rested and spent years in prison
waiting for trial. Almost all of
them were totally exhonerated, by
the way.
The intellectual life inside of
these prisons was very lively. One
of its aspects was that a group of
people who were imprisoned under
these circumstances started to ask
themselves precisely this question,
"What would be an appropriate
aesthetic representation of our ex
perience of these years?"
They came up with the idea
that what might be an appropriate
aesthetic representation would be
something along the lines of an
American-style musical comedy.
They went so far to as to write
a little scenario of such a thing,
and they called it"The Insurrec
tional Follies."
Why do we smile when we think
about this? Because "terrorism" is
serious — obviously. Because
reputations of states are at stake.
"Terrorism" is a very serious busi
ness.
Everyone knows that the
American-style musical comedy is
not serious. In fact, it's a guarantee
that life isn't serious. Life, we sec
in American musical comedy, is
not a problem. The genre guaran
tees happiness. It guarantees that
nothing is too serious.
What happens when you take
a musical comedy and use it to
represent something like the po
litical violence that was going on
in Italy? No one has done this yet.
I think, number one, people
would be shocked. A parallel ex
ample might be Spike Lee's movie,
"Do the Right Thing." Here's this
movie that has the trappings of
being entertainment and leaves
the audience with a very serious
dilemma. It makes certain people
uneasy, and it sticks with you, it
makes you think.
So, to answer your question,
once you recognize the ideologies
of representation in traditional
modes of aesthetic production, you
can use your knowledge to create
something new, something
thought-provoking, something

that moves away from the old
problem toward some changes.
So you're talking about com
bining forms of discourse that
normally would not go together
and, by doing so, making the
topic of "terrorism" more appar
ent.
Exactly. Making the topic more
open to discussion. In other words,
you'd be undermining the tradi
tional ideologies of representation.
What have been your impres
sions in these last weeks reading
the papers? How have you
responded?
I'm extremely sad. I'm extremely
sad. I can't believe it's all happen
ing again. I can't believe we're
seeing the same people saying the
same things. It is hopeless, I think.
The differences between how
the most recent events are being
handled and the way past events
have been are, I think, much less
significant to me than the fact
that these representations go un
challenged.
A first step toward a solution
would be to call criminal acts by
the names that they have whether
they are apparently politically
motivated or not, names that have
a communally consensual mean
ing. "Kidnapping," for instance.
Kidnapping is something tan
gible — we know what that is.
What's the difference between a
"kidnapping" and a "terrorist kid
napping?" Well, something about
political motivation, but the crime
is the same.
At what point does something
go from being a terrorist kidnap
ping to being a kidnapping? When
the terrorists win. If you engage
in a terrorist kidnapping and your
aims are met and you establish a
new state, for example, that kid
napping is no longer called a ter
rorist kidnapping.
Another thing that has sad
dened me amazingly is to see how
brazenly some are willing to say
— as if no other alternative exists
— that we have to strike back.
We have to retaliate immediately
— "it's the only thing these people
understand." I find that achingly
sad. And it's so unimaginative.
I also am saddened by the over
whelming number of examples of
thoughtless "othering" that goes
on when people feel they are in
crisis. This week, I've seen "ex
perts" describe those who are hold
ing hostages in Lebanon as "crazy"
— part of a generic category: these
"crazy people." That doesn't get
us anywhere.
