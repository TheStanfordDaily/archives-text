## Talking 'terrorism': Beverly Allen discusses political violence 
### Mark Weiner Editorial staff 
Beverly Allen doesn't like to
use the word "terrorist." Accord
ing to Allen, the word is ideolog
ical in origin, a product of power
differences between those who use
it and those whom it describes.
An assistant professor in the
Department of French and Italian,
Allen approaches the study of po
litical violence from a distinctly
literary perspective.
Fler course "Postmodern Ter
rorism: Cultures and Perspec
tives," taught through the De
partment of International Rela
tions, draws on her sophisticated
theoretical skills gained from in
tensive study of Italian literature,
particularly the poetry of Andrea
Zanzotto.
Allen received her bachelor's
degree in music from UC-Berkeley
in 1967, after which she performed
piano extensively in Italy. She re
ceived her master's in Italian lan
guage and literature from
Columbia University in 1972, and
her Ph.D. from UC-Berkelely in
1983 in Italian language and litera
ture, with a French minor.
In addition to numerous articles,
Allen has published "Andrea Zan
zotto: The Language of Beauty's
Apprentice" and edited "The
Defiant Muse: Italy's Feminist
Poets." She is currently writing
"Years of Lead: Literature and Ital
ian Terrorism."

Many members of the Stanford
community will remember Allen
as the organizer of the February
1988 conference, "Talking Terror
ism: Ideologies and Paradigms in
a Post-Modern World."
Prof. Allen was denied tenure
last spring. She is appealing the
decision.
You've called "terrorism" the
"most literary of violent political
acts." What do you mean by that
description?
First of all, let me clarify that
when I use the word "terrorism,"
I'm quoting other people's use of
it. 1 have a very difficult time
giving that word status other than
that of a cipher, because I haven't
yet found a definition that suits
me, one that covers all the in
stances in which that word is ap
plied.
1 tend to think of the word as
a cipher that tells me nothing
about what it purports to describe,
but instead tells me something
about the ideology of the person
who's using it.
But to answer your question,
what's called "terrorism" is the
most literary of violent political
acts because its efficacity depends
on the degree to which it gets its
message across.
For example, the difference be
tween a "terrorist" killing and an
assassination would be that the
assassination accomplishes its aim
in the murder it enacts, whereas

what we call terrorism might kill
someone, hut the effect of that
act wouldn't be the death of that
person. It would be making a
whole group of people who identify
with that person feel threatened.
The ways in which that message
gets across can be described in
terms of rhetoric. You can think
of it as a text, a text in fact
dependent on simile, in which a
body of people feels threatened
because tney are in some way like
the victim, whether that body of
people is Italian communist
magistrates or American tourists
in Europe.
There's no reason, other than
this diffuse spreading of the simile,
for American tourists in Europe
to feel threatened. More people
died in 1985 by lightning than by
terrorist acts. It's very important
to keep those things in mind.
You called "terrorism" a "cip
her." Why?
It's a cipher because it doesn't
work the way a sign normally does.
I'll describe it in traditional semi
otic terms. Normally, you have a
signifier that points to some kind
of signified, which in turn points
to a referent in the real world.
With the term "terrorism," that
relay system doesn't work.
What I can know from hearing
the word "terrorism," then, is very
little about what it purports to
describe. I can know, rather, some

thing about the ideology of the
person who uses it.
So our representations of the
"other" say more about "us"
than about those who we
describe. . .
Certainly many representations
of political violence say much
more about the people who are
creating them than about the
people they supposedly describe.
Definitely.
What do contemporary
representations of terrorism in
the media say about those people
who are portraying political vio
lence?
You're as much an observer as
I. Isn't it evident? Especially when
you look at numbers. 1 mean,
there's horror involved in the kil
ling of a hostage, but what makes
that death the object of so much
attention on the part of the gov
ernment, whereas all sorts of
deaths in this country — by
poverty or starvation, say — go
unnoticed?
We have to start asking our
selves the question, "How does
the presentation that we receive
of an event work backwards? Who
in the end benefits from it?" The
government does not describe, for
example, death by starvation in
this country as "terrorism." It docs
not describe legal execution as
"terrorism." It does not call bom
bings of Planned Parenthood
clinics "terrorism."
The notion of legitimacy is in
extricably connected to the notion
of "terrorism." People who engage
in what gets called "terrorism" are
striving to legitimize their de
mands and the people who refuse
them are saying that those de
mands simply aren't legitimate, pe
riod.
If any degree of legitimacy were
granted to the demands, then
there could be other ways found
than violence to deal with those
demands.
It's a very interesting question
of legitimacy on both sides. What
do you do for example in a case
like Germany, where the activities
of the Baader-Meihnoff gang threw
the notion of democracy into a
tailspin? In a country where the
notion of democracy was ex
tremely important and considered
to be fairly fragile after Nazism, it
was necessary to safeguard the
constitutional rights of the people

who had been arrested. At the
same time, these "terrorists" could
not be tolerated — hence their
"suicides" while in prison.
You know, I've been so sad,
unspeakably sad in the last couple
of days watching television, be
cause what I see are the same
experts over and over again. The
other night on "Nightline," 1 saw
1 lenry Kissinger utilizing principles
of good management to deal with
the current hostage situation in
Lebanon. It was a simulation of
what he would do if he were still
in his official role.
It was like a corporate meeting,
a bunch of corporate executives
— all white men — talking, iden
tifying what he called "our aims"
and how to best achieve those
aims and what to do with public
relations after that.
At no point in this scenario
was history invoked. If you call
an act a terrorist act, the first
thing you do is abrogate history.
That cipher says that there's this
essential quality of being a terrorist
that is so unspeakably awful that
history matters not a whit, whereas
if we take a look at history, we
find that these same acts that at
times are called terrorism at other
times are called war or freedom
fighting or uprisings.
I think it matters very much to
start noticing these things. Prob
lems that are caused by this kind
of political violence arc unsolvable
by current means, because the
ideologies of their representations
go unchallenged, because they go
unrecognized.
It seems as if people often talk
about political problems that ap
parently can't be solved and say,
"Well, we can't solve it because
we don't have enough knowl
edge" rather than critiquing the
knowledge they do have.
That's right.
It seems as if one of your pri
mary goals is to raise theoretical
consciousness concerning how
knowledge is produced in the
university so that people can
portray and represent with
greater theoretical sophistication.
That was in fact one of the
goals of the "Talking Terrorism"
conference we had here a year
and a half ago. We asked people
from various fields to discuss the
ideologies of their own fields'
representations of political vio-
