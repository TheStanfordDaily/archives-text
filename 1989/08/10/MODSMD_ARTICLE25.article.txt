## Humans replace rats: livers in the laboratory 
### Billy Louie 
Drs. Carol Green and Katherine
Allen, beepers in hand, are on call
24 hours a day. But instead of
performing surgery or preparing for
a cardiac arrest, they are ready to
rush to the airport at a moment's
notice to receive human livers for
their research.
Green, a toxicologist, and Allen,
a cell biologist, study the effects
of toxins on the liver at SRI In
ternational's Human Liver Re
search Facility in Menlo Park.
Their work may also have impli
cations for cancer research and
new techniques in organ
transplantation. ■
They are now so efficient they
can isolate 4.5 billion liver cells
from a single specimen. Although
this is only a small proportion of
the total number of cells in a liver,
it is more than enough. Up to
five different experiments have
been performed with the cells from
one human liver.
The study of hepatocytes — as
liver cells are technically called —
has long been a controversial issue
because of the need to use live
animals in the research. By using
human livers, scientists like Green
and Allen arc reducing the need
to endanger live animals.
According to Green and Allen,
reducing the use of laboratory
animals is not that difficult, as
more and more people arc choos
ing to leave their organs for
transplantation or scientific
research after their death.
Green and Allen point out that
in 1986 alone there were between
7,000 and 9,000 kidney trans
plants, and there were only 900
liver transplants. This means there
is an incredible excess of human
livers for research.

But even though livers seem to
be in abundance, human liver re
search is progressing slowly. It is
difficult to preserve the livers long
enough to transport them to lab
oratory facilities that can make
use of them. Human hepatocytes
must be prepared for experimenta
tion less than a day from when
they are "harvested" — removed
from the patient. After about 20
hours, too many cells have died.
In addition, the organizations
that provide Green and Allen with
their specimens must divide the
organs they have between a num
ber of research sites. As the re
searchers point out, there may be
four or five livers received in a
week's time. Then again, six
months may pass with no liver to
be seen.
The two scientists are also
restrained by the cost of studying
human liver specimens. One com
pany, they say, vastly overcharges
for the chemical solution needed
to preserve the organs.
Over the years, Green and Allen
have studied livers in living
specimens — in vivo — as well
as those separated from the or
ganism — in vitro. They have now
developed strong links between
live models and laboratory
produced ones.
For instance, researchers now
know that certain substances
which are toxic in an in vitro model
could very well be five times as
toxic in a living organism. Previous
studies using laboratory rats have
led Green and Allen to make com
parisons between live and experi
mental models.
They have even made compar
isons between livers of live rats
and human livers which are artifi
cially maintained in the laboratory.
Since they are unable to perform

live human experiments, they can
only hypothesize about the con
nection between live human
models and experimental ones.
But because of the strong corre
lation between live and experi
mental rat models, they are
confident about the correlation.
The liver, says Allen, is a fas
cinating organ to study. Certain
dosages of chemicals lethal in
other organs are lethal in the liver
in much smaller concentrations.
Unlike a kidney transplant,
where a patient can be saved with
dialysis treatment after the organ
is rejected, a failed liver transplant
normally results in death. How

ever, someone who needs a liver
can usually still function for years
after the liver begins deteriorating.
The liver is extraordinary in its
regenerative properties. It one
third of a liver is removed from
a human body, it will grow back
within 10 days.
This exceptional capability
paves the way for a number of
possibilities. Experiments have
demonstrated that high-quality
cells isolated from a single liver
can be transplanted to a number
of recipients. These cells in turn
regenerate in their host, leading
to near-full or full recovery.
The perfection of such a tech

niquc would be invaluable to
patients with a failing liver. One
donor could suffice for several
recipients, and lack of organs
could be a problem of the past.
Although ideally Green and Al
len would like to replace live sub
ject experiments with
laboratory-reproduced ones, this
may prove unlikely. They note that
the liver it" but one organ of a
complex organ system.
Unfortunately, such studies are
hard to simulate outside a living
environment. Green and Allen,
though, remain hopeful. Beeper in
hand, their motto may well be
"Have liver, will travel."
