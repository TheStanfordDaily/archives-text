## Earthquake hits the Farm; Roble survives 
### Chris Crader Editorial staff With wire reports 
The Bay Area was hit hy a earthquake
early Tuesday morning hut no damage was
reported on campus, and Roble 1 lall is still
standing.
The epicenter was on the San Andreas
fault about 20 miles south of Stanford near
Los Gatos. The quake hroke windows,
toppled groceries and startled a man into
falling to his death from a fifth-story apart
ment window.
State earthquake experts and the Cali
fornia Office of Emergency Services issued
a warning of increased risk and said another
quake as high as 6.2 on the Richter scale
could strike San Francisco in the next five
days.
"It certainly shows us the fault is becom
ing more active," said Andy Michael, a

geophysicist with the U.S. Geological Sur
vey in Menlo Park. He also said the quake
was the largest in the area since 1969.
"The stress is building up in the earth
and we're going to start getting large
earthquakes," said Michael. "It should serve
as a reminder to prepare."
Geologists said the chances of a bigger
quake in the same spot diminished with
each passing hour, however.
According to Jonathan Ryan, the project
manager for Roble I lall's renovation, "It's
still there and our connections have held
up. There are no noticeable problems."
Roble was abruptly closed in December of
1987 when it was discovered that the stu
dent residence did not meet the University's
earthquake safety standards.
The renovation will be completed in time
for students to move in when school starts
this fall. It will be mostly done at the "end
of the month," said Gene Kershner, the

associate director of facilities and project
management. "There will he a few slight
things left to do the first week of September.
Generally it will be ready for the students
when they arrive."
The quake occurred as state and federal
emergency services officials prepared to con
duct a two-day test of their response to a
catastrophic earthquake.
The quake, which hit with a jolt and
rolled for 10 seconds, was felt as far away
as San Luis Obispo, about 230 miles south
of San Francisco and in Sonoma County,
60 miles to the north.
The temblor struck at 1:13 a.m. and
measured 5.2 on the Richtcr scale of ground
motion.
A moderate aftershock measuring 4.2 on
the Richter scale struck at 1:44 a.m., fol
lowed by a second, stronger aftershock that
measured 4.5 at 8:53 a.m., according to the
geological survey.

In Los Gatos, police reported that Mat
thew James Rignall, 19, accidentally jumped
from his bedroom window after apparently
being startled awake by the earthquake.
Bignall died of multiple injuries, accord
ing to a spokeswoman with the Santa Clara
County coroner's office.
San Francisco's Great Quake, which oc
curred in 1906 before the Richtcr scale was
devised, has been estimated at 8.3. Recent
estimates say more than 2,000 people died
in the quake and the fire it touched off,
which burned much of the city.
Each increase of one number, as in a
jump from magnitude 5.5 to 6.5, means
that the ground motion is 10 times greater.
A quake of 3.5 can cause slight damage in
populated areas, while a quake of 6.0 can
cause severe damage. In March 1964 an
earthquake in Alaska hit 8.5 on the Richter
scab, killing 114 people.
