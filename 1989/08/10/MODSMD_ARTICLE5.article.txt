Biology prof, wins prize
for her plant research
Associate Prof. Sharon Long has received
the Charles Albert Shull Award, the most
prestigious award of the American Society of
Plant Physiologists.
Long, who works in the department of hi

ological scienccs, won the award for her new
insights into plant-microbe interactions.
The Stanford research team Long heads dis
covered a chemical that they believe acts- as
a signal from leguminous plants to nitrogen
fixing bacteria. The signal allows the bacteria
to colonize the plants roots, thus reducing the
amount of nitrogen the plant must remove
from the soil.
Understanding the behavior of this signaling

dcvicc could allow the process to he induced
in other types of plants, permitting the use
of less fertilizer. Fertilizer is a soil additive
containing nitrogen, which is neccssary for
plant growth.
Long was named the recipient of the award
at the joint meeting of the American and
Canadian Societies of Plant Physiologists. Her
citation states her research has become a "dom
inant force" in the field.
