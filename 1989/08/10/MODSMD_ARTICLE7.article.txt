# U.S., Soviet soccer teams here in Feb.
## 
### Chris Crader Editorial staff 
The forward pass has always
been a constant in Stanford Sta
dium, but come Feb. 24, 1990, the
passes will be kicked instead of
thrown as a different type of foot
ball will be played. On that date
the national teams of the United
States and the Soviet Union will
meet on the Farm in an exhibition
soccer match.
Tickets tor the match, which
was announced Tuesday, will go
on sale in the Athletic Department
ticket office Aug. 17.
The contest will be the second
U.S.-USSR contest held at Stan
ford Stadium. The first, a dual
track meet in 1962, drew more
than 150,000 people over two
days.
The last significant interna
tional soccer action held at Stan
ford was during the 1984 Olym
pics. The nine matches played at
Stanford averaged more than
50,000 spectators, including a
near-capacity crowd of 83,642 for
a match between Brazil and Italy.
The last time the United States
and the Soviet Union met was in
the 1988 Olympics, where the
teams met in the last match of
the first round. The Soviet Union
opened up a 4-0 lead in the first
50 minutes but the U.S. came
back to cut the final margin to
4-2. The Soviets went on to win
the gold medal and are still con
sidered one of the top five teams
in the W( >rld.
The American squad that will
take the field in February, how
ever. is a much-improved and
more confident team. The U.S.
defeated Rome's powerful club
team two weeks ago and is in a
very good position to qualify as
one of the 24 teams that will play
in the 1990 World Cup in Italy.
The United States has four
matches remaining against North
American foes and is in the
driver's seat to finish second of
the five teams in this region. The
top two teams will advance to
Italy.
The United States has already
received the right to host the 1994
World Cup.
Stanford has not yet submitted
a bid to be one of the 16 host
stadiums for the 1994 World Cup,
but it is likely Stanford wtll enter
a bid.
"We're extremely proud to be
part of this activity," Athletic Di
rector Andy Geiger said. "We look
forward to this and future soccer
events here at Stanford Stadium."
"It's a great opportunity to play
here at Stanford," said national
team player and University of San
Francisco graduate John Doyle. "1
always dreamed of getting to play
here at Stanford in front of my
friends and family."
Goalkeeper David Vanole, a
UCLA graduate, felt the U.S. out
played the Soviets in the second
half of the 1988 Olympic contest

and is confident that his team will
not only qualify for the 1990 World
Cup, but will also give the Soviets
a tough match next February.
"We have become so confident
in our own ability that we don't
walk on to the field in awe,"
Vanole said. "When we come out
to face the Russians after we've
qualified, we won't be in awe."
Qualification for the World Cup
ends in November and the actual
competition will begin next June.
