## The '60s trivialized
### 
WOODSTOCK PROBABLY will be
remembered as the most ridiculed
event of the 19605. Through what seem
like endless retrospectives, the Ameri
can media have managed to create a
collective smirk across the United States.
Take, for instance, Newsweek, which has always
been a paragon of intelligent cultural commentary. In
a July cover story entitled "The Summer of 1969," the
magazine published an article that completely
trivialized not only the Woodstock concert but the
entire counterculture.
"Vietnam made a peaceable, pleasure-centered life
seem even more than usually desirable," the article
stated. "Easy money made it temporarily feasible. ...
If you had no kids to feed. If you had nothing better
to do."
Absent from the Newsweek article was any discus
sion of the radical political philosophy that communal
and non-violent hippie life could represent. The mag
azine made its editorial stance even more clear by
placing its commentary amid discussions of Charles
Manson and Chappaquiddick.
Newsweek's Woodstock article was just a small part
of a larger process in which the media has attempted
to help Americans come to terms with the 19605.
Everyone, of course, has noticed. "Another article
about the '60s!" has been a common complaint in the
past few years.
Why the barrage?
In part, because magazines like Newsweek and Time
thrive on nostalgia and glitzy pseudo-history. They
also present the past in such a way as to further their
own political agendas.
But most importantly, the media have flooded their
readership with what often are less-than-quality dis
cussions of the 1960s because the ideas that circulated
during that decade are too dangerous to discuss anew.
Rather than present a truthful account of the past,
the media have given us an incoherent, ahistorical
and unrepresentative series of snapshots with which
we can distance ourselves from important cultural and
political issues.
For the media, Woodstock is a means by which to
rail against contemporary drug use, not an event from
which we can learn about American notions of com
munity. The 1960s as a whole are a series of images
— of John F. Kennedy, Tom Hayden or Martin Luther
King, Jr. — rather than the actual ideas and grass-roots
actors of the time.
America needs to understand its past. Stanford,
which experienced the 1960s as intensely as any other
university community, needs to do so as well.
We cannot do so, however, without being critical
and ever-watchful of the trivialized vision of the past
the media present us. The media's recent coverage of
the Woodstock concert is a case in point.
If we simply accept what is given to us, we fall
victim to the powers against which much protest of
the 1960s was fighting.
We need to come to terms with our past, not over
come it.
