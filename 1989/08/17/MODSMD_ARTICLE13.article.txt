Leland's premature
death should inspire
service to humanity
Light a candle for Mickey
Leland. The Texas congress
man died last week in the
service of humanity. En route
to a refugee camp in Ethio
pia, his plane crashed into
the side of a mountain dur
ing a storm, and all the pas
sengers perished. The loss of
Leland and his travelling
party is a profound interna
tional tragedy.
Light a candle for the
African-American people. We
have lost one of our most
promising African-American
leaders. Leland, 44, was the
past head of the Congres
sional Black Caucus, and a
prominent adviser to the
Rev. Jesse Jackson's 1988 cam
paign. He had his eye on the
U.S. Senate (there are no
Afican-American senators),
and figured to play a key
role in a future Jackson pres
idential bid.
Light a candle for America.
There are only 22 African-
American U.S. representatives
out of 435 — 5 percent —
yet we are 12 to 15 percent
of the U.S. population.
The Congressional Black
Caucus has been one of the
only consistent progressive
voices in Washington, acting
as the conscience of the Con
gress. Amid the Reagan
Revolution's destructive tax
cuts and program slashing,
the CBC was virtually alone
in taking a strong stand in
opposition to corporate greed
and in favor of humane poli
cies.
Each year since Reagan
took office, the CBC has put
forward an alternative budget
which cuts military spending,
raises taxes for the rich, ana
spends more money on

people and social programs.
When Bush terrorized Du
kakis with his liberal bash
ing, Leland stood tall and
said, "Some of us are not
afraid to be called liberal and
progressive, and to continue
to fight for our place in the
sun. Eventually, we'll get
there."
Sadly, I hear echoes of
Martin Luther King's last
speech, "I may not get there
with you, but we, as a
people, will get to the
promised land." Once again,
America has lost another
proud and strong voice for
social justice and equality.
Light a candle for human
ity. Politicians are often
motivated by selfish interests
— the desire to get votes
and money for their cam
paigns. None of the refugees
in Fugnido, Ethiopia could
vote or contribute to any of
Leland's political campaigns,
but he went anyway. He
went because people were
dying of hunger and he
wanted to help. He went
because he cared about
people. He went to help hu
manity.
And so, we light a candle
in this hour of darkness and
despair. But, if we can take
any lesson from this tragic
moment, let it be to learn to
live as Mickey Leland died
— in the service of human
ity.
Our highest tribute to
Leland will be to rededicate
ourselves to helping the less
fortunate in the world, and
to make this planet a more
just, equal and compassionate
place. We'll miss you, Mick
ey. We'll keep up the
struggle, and yes, we will get
there.

To eliminate gender
bias, Stanford needs
to re-examine itself
Brava to the individual
who wrote the Aug. 3 edito
rial highlighting the under
representation of women on
the Stanford faculty! The
statistics reveal that
gender discrimination
still exists, albeit in a much
more subtle fashion.
A woman may be consid
ered to be a brilliant scholar,
but she just doesn't do
things the "right way," she
doesn't "play by the rules."
The fact is that academia as
an institution and its rules
have been structured by men
since its foundation, and a
second fact is that women
are different from men and
sometimes (often?) do things
in a completely alternative
manner.
Therefore, even if it is
asserted that women are
given equal opportunity to
meet the same criteria that
have always existed (for
men), that assertion in and
of itself effectively obviates
any possibility of an alterna
tive existing order.
1 am by no means advocat
ing that standards of achieve
ment be lowered or weak
ened for women because
they are in some way less
competent than men. I am
simply arguing that the way
the University is structured at
its very basis needs to be
re-examined and re
established in order to elimi
nate an inherent gender bias
that exists, legitimated by the
sole fact that, "That's the way
it's always been done."
Universities, especially
Stanford, pride themselves on
being on the cutting edge of
discovery and change; here's
a new frontier just ripe for
exploration and conquest.
