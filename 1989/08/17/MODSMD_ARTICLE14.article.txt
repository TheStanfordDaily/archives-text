## Meet bad speech with good, not with censorship 
### 
Remember anna es
hoo? She was this dis
trict's Democratic
candidate for Congress last
year, edged out by moderate
Republican and Stanford pro
fessor Tom Campbell.
Though a Democrat at the
time, I turned coat for Camp
bell; he was progressive on
social and foreign policy is
sues (like Eshoo) but also a
refreshingly thoroughgoing
tightwad (unlike Eshoo). My
kind of politician.
At an October Eshoo rally,
staged by the Stanford Dem
ocrats in the center of
campus, I showed up with a
large sign. Well, four signs,
to be exact, all on one stake:
on top, a magic-markered
"Democrats for," supported
by placards boosting "Camp
bell for Congress," ' Dukakis-
Bentsen," and "McCarthy for
U.S. Senate."
Not two minutes went bv

after I hoisted this totem
poled announcement of my
defection before several of
the teeming brownshirts
brought out their own signs.
Not to display them, of
course, but to blot out mine.
What I stridently told these
self-appointed censors was:
Hey, fine. You disagree with
me. Let's debate, each of us
allowing the other a chance

to air uninterrupted argu
ments (or to show un
obstructed signs).
But what gives you the
right to silence me just be
cause (a) you are convinced
of my error; and (b) you arc
in the majority?
Nothing does, and that is
precisely my point in recall
ing the Eshoo rally. John
Stuart Mill, in his 1859 essay

"On Liberty," presented three
reasons why holders of unor
thodox views, be they dissi
dent Democrats, campus
racists, or flag-burners, must
nearly never be governmen
tally silenced. First, the cen
sored opinion just might be
correct, and its suppression
would deprive society of the
opportunity of "exchanging
error for truth."
Second, even invalid
opinions might hold "a por
tion of truth,"and "it is only
by the collision of adverse
opinions," each containing a
nugget of veracity, "that the
remainder of the truth has
any chance of being sup
plied."
Third, and most important
today, even if the opinion to
be censored is altogether
wrong, in silencing it society
forgoes "what is almost as
great a benefit as that [of
truth], the clearer perception
and livelier impression of

truth, produced by its colli
sion with error."
Racist name-callers and
flag-burners fall into this
final category. We do not
eradicate racism by silencing
its symptoms any more than
we promote love of America
by locking up anti-patriots.
But we learn from the bigots
and flag-burners precisely
because, as they voice their
views, their error rings out.
In conclusion, since Ameri
cans overwhelmingly hate
racists and flag-burners,
should we silence their "bad
speech"? No. The appropriate
response to racist insults is
education; to a flag-burning,
a wave of one's own banner.
Good speech will eradicate
the bad far better than cen
sorship ever could.
