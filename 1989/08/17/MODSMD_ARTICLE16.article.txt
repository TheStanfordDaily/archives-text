## Pennant watching through a laser-guided telescope 
### 
When I was younger it
was easy to follow the
pennant race.
After school, I'd double
check the TV listings in the
New York Times to see if the
Mets were on. If they were, I'd
turn on the set at 8 that evening
(many teams didn't start at 7:30
back then) to watch.

More often than not in my
halcyon grade school days,
"bedtime" would arrive before
the game ended. But I was
prepared. I had this little AM
radio — the same one I listened
to the night Dr. J rallied the
Nets from a million points down
to bring them a championship
in what I beleive was the last
ABA game ever played.
Nestled comfortably in my
bed, I'd tune in to Lindsay Nel
son, Ralph Kiner and Bob
Murphy and root for Seaver and
Koosman and Rusty.
In case I fell asleep before
the game ended I could get the
score the next morning. My
clock radio was set to 1010
WINS ("You give us 22
minutes, we'll give you the
world") and soon after awaken
ing I'd hear the score.
Then, if the game ended early
enough, I could read the details
in the Times — with an espe
cially sharp eye to examine the
box score. When the game
ended late, there'd be no story
in the Times. Still isn't, as a
matter of fact.
Anyway, I'd scan the stand
ings (usually knew 'em by heart)
and that would be it. The
easiest thing about following

the Mets in those days is that
they finished third — or worse
— every year.
I'm fairly certain I knew they
weren't going to be in the
playoffs. Nevertheless, I lived
and died with every win and
every loss. Still do, as a matter
of fact.
T}day, things are different.
And for a whole lot of
reasons. Foremost among
those is that I live on the West
Coast.
Play begins in Shea Stadium
at 4:35 p.m., Pacific Daylight
Time. The Mets' divisional foes
— the Cubs, Cardinals and Ex
pos — commence their home
action no more than an hour
later.
So when you combine games
that end at 9 o'clock with my
early-morning bedtime, there's
not much chance I'll fall asleep
before the games are over. One
might think knowing all the
results before the night is
through might be enough. But
not for me.
Every technological change
that brings the scores to me
sooner becomes absolutely,
positively necessary almost as
soon as it's available.
Case in point: About the
time I was in junior high,
Sports Phone became available
in New York. When it was first
introduced, the scores were up
dated every half hour. Eventu
ally, though, the updates came
every few minutes.
Never mind that you could
get the score on the radio. Now,
if I was away from home and
had to know the score, a quick
fix of 976-1313 would calm my
anxiety in an instant.
Sports Phone was especially
valuable for those instances
where someone managed to
engage me in conversation long
enough for the end of the game
to sneak by without my notic
ing.
