# Evans looks to avenge rare defeat
## 
### Mark Rogowsky Editorial staff 
At this week's Pan-Pacific
Championships, Janet Evans is
seeking one of the few things she
doesn't already have: revenge.
The winner of three goal medals
at the Seoul Olympics, Evans was
beaten by Australia's Julie
McDonald in the last Pan-Pacific
meet two years ago.
Since then, she's completely
rewritten the record books, won
a good deal of the aforementioned
Olympic gold and learned to swim
a new event — the 200-meter
individual medley, which she won
at the U.S. Swimming Nationals
two weeks ago in a stunning come
from-behind performance.
Of course, Evans rarely trails
the pack and usually is racing
against nothing but her own world
records. "I always want to swim
my fastest; that's my goal," Evans
told USA Today. "I've always
swum for myself. If I'm satisfied,
then I don't let what other people
expect of me bother me. But some
times it's hard — 1 think I could
go faster it there was somebody
there with me."
Meanwhile, the accolades con
tinue to shower the young woman
who turned down millions in en
dorsement fees — including an
"I'm going to Disneyland" deal —
for the chance to swim at the
self-proclaimed Disneyland of the
North.
"lEvansJ has proven herself to
be the greatest distance swimmer
in the history of the sport," ac
cording to Dick Shoulberg, coach
of the U.S. women's national team.
Said Stanford Coach Richard
Quick: "She's handled all her suc
cess and not let it change or affect
her. We (the U.S.) had swimmers
who didn't even make the Olym
pics who thought they needed a
break at the end of last year.
"She won three medals, yet by
all accounts has averaged 11 work
outs a week since the Games. She
hasn't lost a bit of desire."

Jim Grabb scored one of the big
gest wins of his career when he
defeated Michael Chang two
weeks ago at the Volvo Interna

tional.
Yesterday, at the ATP Cham
pionship in Mason, Ohio, he
nearly did it again. "I saw the
draw and my first reaction was,
'OK, I get a chance to play him
again.' Then I got out on the
court and I thought, 'Oh no, I
have to play him again,'" Chang
said.
This time, though, Chang
bested Grabb — the world's 62nd
ranked player — in a tense three

setter, 6-3, 5-7, 7-6 (8-6). Grabb
served two aces in the tiebreaker
to help him pull even at 6-6.
Chang came back with two win
ners to advance to the third round.
Tami Whitlinger, who reached
the third round of the Virginia
Slims of Los Angeles last week
before falling to Catarina
Lindqvist, lost a second-round
match at the Virginia Slims of
Albuquerque (N.M.) to Beverly
Bowes 6-3, 0-6, 7-5.
