## 'The Abyss' survives summer movie schizophrenia 
### David Chang Staff writer 
"The Abyss" is a movie that's
on the brink of being another "Bat
man." Thank God it's not.
"Batman" was more of an event
than a movie. Bat-chic and Bat
speak, it was all an illusion sur
rounding a painfully uneven film.
On the one hand, it attempted to
be a blockbuster; on the other, it
raised expectations by claiming to
explore Batman's complex charac
ter.
"The Abyss" also tries to be
everything at once. "There's every
thing you've ever known about
adventure . .. and then there's
'The Abyss'," the advertisements
trumpet. Meanwhile, James
Cameron, who based the film on
a short story he wrote in high
school, talks about each character
facing "his own abyss." The press
packet even quotes Nietzsche.
But this film, handled by
Cameron and Gale Anne Hurd,
the directing/producing team that
did "Aliens," manages to survive
the identity dilemma because it
has some substance to it.
The film focuses on a crew of
workers who man an experimental
oil drilling rig called Deepcore.
They are conscripted into duty
when a Navy sub mysteriously
sinks nearby with its full load of
missiles. Deepcorc's crew members
have to cooperate with a group
of SEALs who are sent down to
help out and uphold Navy
priorities.
At first, the characters arc in

troduced with a lot of bluster, es
pecially Lindscy (Mary Elizabeth
Mastrantonio), the hard-driving
designer of the drilling rig. When
she flies in to safeguard her in
vention, mining personnel call her
the "Queen Bitch of the Uni
verse," and when someone wishes
her good luck, she replies, "Luck
is not a factor."
This bang-bang characterization
of a quickly-assembled team
strongly resembles the first few
scenes in "Aliens." Unfortunately,
it establishes stereotypes and run
ning jokes instead of revealing in
ner character.
Later, though, as the plot begins
to congeal, the talent of this
mostly unknown cast begins to
show through. Hippy is given a
lot of originality and character by
actor Todd Graff, who looks like
a cross between offbeat director
John Waters and Pee Wee Herman.
"One Night" (Kimberly Scott)
is similarly distinctive with her
low-key country spunk. And when
Lindsey revives from a brush with
death, Ed Harris (as Lindsey's hus
band Bud) and Mastrantonio suc
cessfully evoke the whole range
of emotions: from fear to grim
determination to sorrow to
heartfelt relief.
Visually, too, "The Abyss"
comes off as genuine. All of the
$43 million spent on equipment
and sets are apparent, and the
seam between present technology
and cinematic illusion simply isn't.
At the beginning, the sub
marine's bridge undergoes a dark
transformation from a bustling

center of activity into a cold,
watery crypt. When the crew dis
covers that the sub went down
due to the inadvertent actions of
a curious species of creature from
the deepest part of the Caribbean,
somehow the visual effects stay
convincing. Like florescent fish,
turbine-powered jellyfish and
ethereal marine butterflies, the
deep-sea aliens captivate the at
tention.
The movie's climax is Bud's
heroic attempt to prevent the
paranoid SEAL leader from
destroying the aliens. It's also
where the movie begins to show
its faults.
Bud simply stumbles upon the
place where he has to do his heroic
work. The camaraderie between
the crew members is shoved aside
in favor of romance. (The final
scene is Bud and Lindsey kissing
on an alien beach of sorts, with
the others not even in view).
Magical alien technology is
denatured and moved up into
broad daylight. And in the end,
perhaps because of technological
and budgetary limitations, it's
never revealed how the relation
ship between the Deepcorers and
the aliens graduates from mutual
curiosity to genuine friendship.
"The Abyss" is an adventure
movie at heart, though, and in
that domain it is an unqualified
success. Cameron sustains the
pace well, moving from peril to
peril in a natural sequence. The
movie has the technology and the
cinematography, and the solid act
ing to back them up.

have to cooperate with a group
of SEALs who are sent down to
help out and uphold Navy
priorities.
At first, the characters arc in

troduced with a lot of bluster, es
pecially Lindscy (Mary Elizabeth
Mastrantonio), the hard-driving
designer of the drilling rig. When
she flies in to safeguard her in
vention, mining personnel call her
the "Queen Bitch of the Uni
verse," and when someone wishes
her good luck, she replies, "Luck
is not a factor."
This bang-bang characterization
of a quickly-assembled team
strongly resembles the first few
scenes in "Aliens." Unfortunately,
it establishes stereotypes and run
ning jokes instead of revealing in
ner character.
Later, though, as the plot begins
to congeal, the talent of this
mostly unknown cast begins to
show through. Hippy is given a
lot of originality and character by
actor Todd Graff, who looks like
a cross between offbeat director
John Waters and Pee Wee Herman.
"One Night" (Kimberly Scott)
is similarly distinctive with her
low-key country spunk. And when
Lindsey revives from a brush with
death, Ed Harris (as Lindsey's hus
band Bud) and Mastrantonio suc
cessfully evoke the whole range
of emotions: from fear to grim
determination to sorrow to
heartfelt relief.
Visually, too, "The Abyss"
comes off as genuine. All of the
$43 million spent on equipment
and sets are apparent, and the
seam between present technology
and cinematic illusion simply isn't.
At the beginning, the sub
marine's bridge undergoes a dark
transformation from a bustling

center of activity into a cold,
watery crypt. When the crew dis
covers that the sub went down
due to the inadvertent actions of
a curious species of creature from
the deepest part of the Caribbean,
somehow the visual effects stay
convincing. Like florescent fish,
turbine-powered jellyfish and
ethereal marine butterflies, the
deep-sea aliens captivate the at
tention.
The movie's climax is Bud's
heroic attempt to prevent the
paranoid SEAL leader from
destroying the aliens. It's also
where the movie begins to show
its faults.
Bud simply stumbles upon the
place where he has to do his heroic
work. The camaraderie between
the crew members is shoved aside
in favor of romance. (The final
scene is Bud and Lindsey kissing
on an alien beach of sorts, with
the others not even in view).
Magical alien technology is
denatured and moved up into
broad daylight. And in the end,
perhaps because of technological
and budgetary limitations, it's
never revealed how the relation
ship between the Deepcorers and
the aliens graduates from mutual
curiosity to genuine friendship.
"The Abyss" is an adventure
movie at heart, though, and in
that domain it is an unqualified
success. Cameron sustains the
pace well, moving from peril to
peril in a natural sequence. The
movie has the technology and the
cinematography, and the solid act
ing to back them up.
