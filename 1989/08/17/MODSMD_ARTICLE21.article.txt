# 'Casualties of War': hit or miss
## 
### Mark Tompkins Staff writer 
By now there's a well-defined
Vietnam movie aesthetic, and it's
based more on other Vietnam
movies than on the actual war.
Get a bunch of choppers, sweaty
American guys who swear a lot,
and some vaguely Oriental
looking people to fill up the back
ground, and there you go. Instant
Vietnam movie. Of course, you

better movies'(}(kc "Body Double"
and the undeniably brilliant "Scar

ercises in style. "The Untouch

seriously, but in order to become
respectable, he must have left his
own personality bound and gagged
somewhere. With "Casualties of
War," he continues to go upscale
and downhill at the same time.
