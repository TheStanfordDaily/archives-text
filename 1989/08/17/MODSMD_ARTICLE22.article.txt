# 10,000 Maniacs charm at the Greek
## 
### Cliff Chew Staff writer 
I'm not sure how many people
the Greek Theater can hold, but
Saturday evening's show featuring
10,000 Maniacs couldn't have been
more oversold or overpacked.
It seems that 10,000 Maniacs
have achieved both a large follow
ing and noticeable commercial
success at last. Those expecting
elaborate sets, lighting and gim
micks typical of big-name concerts
were surely disappointed, however.
The focus of the show, un
surprisingly, was Natalie Mer
chant's highly distinctive, elegant
voice. The band stayed in the
background the entire time, giving
Merchant ample room on the
simply-decorated stage to prance
around and charm the audience
with her girlish playfulness. Yet at
the same time she narrated serious
tales through her lyrics.
Unfortunately, her voice was
not brought out prominently
enough by those engineering the
show. In a normal singing voice,
it was extremely difficult to inter
pret what she was singing, espe
cially for those who were not
familiar with her complicated

lyrics. Only when she raised her
voice in a climactic moment did
it sound loud enough. It was a
shame, because what she has to
say makes the band interesting.
The lyrics on 10,000 Maniacs's
new album, "Blind Man's Zoo,"
are almost without exception
highly political, yet told from
unique, personal points of view —
such as the sadly beautiful "Dust
Bowl," in which Merchant takes
the part of a tired young woman
who can't afford toys for her
children — a kind of "Grapes of
Wrath" for the 1980s. Personal
songs like this, were delivered to
the audience with exquisite grace.
10,000 Maniacs approached
much of their material with dy
namic intensity and good humor.
In fact, it seemed as if Merchant
and the rest of the band were
making a conscious effort to loosen
up their image.
During "A Campfire Song,"
which is a duet with Michael Stipe
of R.E.M. on the album, Natalie
suddenly thrust the microphone
in front of bassist Steve Gustaf
son's face, apparently to his
surprise. Showing poise, he
butchered the song with a smile
on his face.

And in addition to twirling
about onstage, Merchant appeared
during the performance of "You
Happy Puppet" completely draped
in a white cloth puppet outfit with
a large, silly-looking head and two
sticks as arms. The band members
played on, keeping a straight face.
In their past releases, the band
had generally played catchy
melodies which were pleasant yet
seemed to serve only as a backup
to Merchant's voice. At Saturday's
concert, though, the band man
aged to ignite the older songs
"Don't Talk" (from their 1987
breakthrough album "In My
Tribe") and "My Mother the War"
(from"The Wishing Chair").
Both of these songs came as
encores (a total of eight songs
were played in three encores), with
excellent guitar work from Robert
Buck, who even laced "My Mother
the War" with heavy doses of feed
back atypical of the 10,000
Maniacs sound.
The band's newer material is
much more musically diverse and
intriguing; this was especially ap
parent in concert, where the band
suddenly sounded much more vi
brant and alive while playing "Eat
For Two," "Hateful Hate" and
"Headstrong."
The end of the concert, how
ever, belonged to Merchant, who
came onstage alone to captivate
the audience with "Jubilee" and
"Verdi Cries," both of which fea
tured only her stunning voice and
her own piano playing. While sing
ing the somber "Jubilee," though,
Natalie broke the song off with a
cry — "Ow! A mosquito just bit
me" — and proceeded on to the
caress of "Verdi Cries" without
ever finishing.
Such unpretentiousness comes
naturally to Natalie. In the
growing darkness, her clear voice
created an intimacy with the au
dience. She used the opportunity
to tell the crowd about a few
campfires she sang at with her
family.
Her final song, a real campfire
song which she taught the crowd
to sing, confirmed the fact that
she doesn't take herself too
seriously. After a "good night" to
all, that song and Natalie's charm
left the audience feeling warm and
toasty despite the cold night air.
