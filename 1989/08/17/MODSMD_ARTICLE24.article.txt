# Bringing reality 'Into the Woods'
## 
### Mark Pinkus Staff writer 
Prince Charming cheating on Cinderella?
Little Red Riding-hood flirting with Jack and
his beanstalk? Is this a fairy tale or a nightmare?
Actually, all this — and more — happens
in Steven Sondheim's latest creation, "Into
the Woods." Although the play fails to live
up to all the surrounding hype, it does conjure
up some catchy tunes, more than enough
laughs, a message of sorts and a generally
enjoyable night out at the theater.
Last year Steven Sondheim, noted for his
scores for Broadway hits like "Sweeney Todd"
and "Sunday In the Park With George," teamed
up with director and writer Jason Lapine ("Sun
day in the Park With George") to take Broad
way by storm.
In addition to earning two Tonys — Best
Score and Best Book of a Musical — "Into
the Woods" won both the New York Drama
Critics Circle and Drama Desk Awards for
Best Musical. The coup was completed with
its 1989 victory at the Grammy Awards in the
Original Cast Recording category.
The play is broken into two separate acts.
The first retells four Brothers Grimm fairy
talcs at the same time. The tales become
intertwined as the various characters meet
each other in the woods.
At times, it seems that the more childish
scenes, such as the one where the baker buys
Jack's cow for five magic beans, would be

inane. Fortunately, they are able to come alive
due to clever lyrics which make the well-worn
scenes appealing to an adult crowd.
If any of you are fairy talc purists who'd be
offended by the first act, then you shouldn't
stay for the second act. Evidently, Sondheim
and Lapine decided an appropriate conclusion
for the musical would be to commemorate the
175 th anniversary of these classic German
stories with a little mischief — to tell what
really happens after the final page.
The baker and his wife do not live happily
ever after. No one ever thinks about what
kind of revenge the giant's wife has in store
for Jack. And who would guess that Prince
Charming isn't cut out for the married life?
The second half chooses to move beyond
the realm of fantasy and into the harshness
of reality. It acts as a reflection of our modern
times and points out that we do not live in
a fairyland.
Such issues as raising kids, extramarital af
fairs, the death of a loved one and possessive,
screaming mothers entangle themselves around
the lives of these once-innocent characters.
But the play doesn't leave the audience
feeling like all is hopeless in this crazy latc-'Bos
world we live in. The heartfelt song "No One
Is Alone," sung by Cinderella (Jill Geddes) to
Little Red Riding-hood (Tracy Katz), point?
out the warm thought that someone is always
beside you. And the finale, "Children Will
Listen," reminds the audience that future
generations embody a chance to correct past

wrongs.
This is one of those musicals that can be
truly appreciated by all ages. The youngsters
will love the interplay between the stories and
their characters, and the older crowd will be
amused by the clever lyrics while contempla
ting the deeper message.
The music alone is worth the price of ad
mission. The tunes are classic and the theme
song, "Into the Woods," will stay with you
long after the final curtain call.

"Into the Woods" plays at the Golden Gate
Theater m San Francisco until Sept. 3. Call
