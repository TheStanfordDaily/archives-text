## Producer Gale Hurd's rise to Hollywood power Climbing to the top and diving into 'The Abyss' 
### Deborah Then 
Many people in the entertain
ment industry begin their careers
in the notorious mailroom, or as
personal assistants to producers
and directors. But few make it to
the top, as "The Abyss" producer
Gale Anne Hurd, 33, has done.
And she has done so as a woman
in male-dominated Hollywood.
What's the secret of her success?
"I never said no," says Hurd. "I
said, OK, if it has to be done, I'll
do it. It's people who are willing
to take on more and more respon
sibility, even if it's considered
mundane at the time, who get
rewarded. There's a great deal of
stress, and a lot of challenges. If
you're not self-confident and will
ing to dedicate your life to fulfill
your ambitions, you won't get
there."
Hurd's "someone's got to do it"
attitude has taken her from empty
ing chemical toilets in stars' motor

homes and making coffec as a
production assistant to independ
ently producing her own films. She
says, "People who have a good
attitude, who say 'I don't care what
I have to do', will get ahead."
She's encountered college grad
uates who feel that because they
have a degree, it means they are
going to start out at another level.
"That's a complete myth," says
Hurd. "Even what you learn
hands-on making student films,
except for the rare exception,
means nothing. It has no currency
in the real world because there
are so many people competing for
so few jobs."
Hurd is one of only a handful
of notable women film producers
in Hollywood today. Others in
clude Sherry Lansing ("Fatal At
traction", "The Accused"), Penny
Finkelman Cox ("Honey, I Shrunk
the Kids", "Broadcast News"),
Debra Hill ("Big Top Pee Wee"),
and Kathleen Kennedy ("Back to

the Future", "Who Framed Roger
Rabbit").
"There aren't many women fea
ture film producers," Hurd says.
"Sometimes there's a sense that
women lack strength — which is
obviously not true — but it's per
ceived in that way. Once you've
proved that you can handle a ..very
difficult film, then the studios and
financial people are more than
willing to take a chance on you
the next time. It's getting that
first shot that is really critical. As
more women have the credibility,
more women will be groomed to
take on that responsibility."
Born in Los Angeles as an only
child to an affluent family, Hurd
was raised in Palm Springs where
her father was a private investor
and entrepreneur. Hurd attended
Stanford, where she majored in
economics and communications.
Elected to Phi Beta Kappa in her
junior year, she graduated in 1977.

While a Stanford student, Hurd
spent the fall and winter quarters
of her junior year at the Stanford
program at Cliveden, England.
There she enrolled in several film
classes. The following year she en
rolled in the Summer Mass Media
Institute, sponsored each summer
by the Department of Communi
cations. She concentrated on the
broadcast news segment of the
program, and interned at KPIX
TV in San Francisco as part of
the course.
Prior to her studies in England,
Hurd says she really had no in
terest in film. "It wasn't something
that I even thought of as a career.
I think that's one great thing about
experiences at college — they can
change your life. Something
transcendental happens to you,
and your whole life takes a sharp
left-to-right turn. In a sense, there
was some serendipity involved,"
Hurd says.
Hurd was contemplating her fu

ture when, in her senior year, she
received a letter from the office
of director/producer Roger Cor
man (Stanford, Class of '47), then
head of New World Pictures. As
fate would have it, a former pro
fessor of communications at Stan
ford, Steven Kovacs, had recently
gone to work for Corman as Di
rector of Production. Hurd had
taken classes from Kovacs, and it
was this connection that led her
into the entertainment industry.
The letter from Corman read
"We've been trying to contact you
for a number of weeks regarding
employment. Please contact our
office as soon as possible to set
up a meeting." That now-famous
letter hangs framed on the wall
of Hurd's Pacific Western Produc
tions office on the Burbank Studios
Lot. "I wouldn't be here without
it," she says, beaming.
In 1978, Hurd left the Bay Area
