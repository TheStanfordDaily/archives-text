## Producer Gale Hurd's rise to Hollywood power Climbing to the top and diving into 'The Abyss' 
### Deborah Then 
Many people in the entertain
ment industry begin their careers
in the notorious mailroom, or as
personal assistants to producers
and directors. But few make it to
the top, as "The Abyss" producer
Gale Anne Hurd, 33, has done.
And she has done so as a woman
in male-dominated Hollywood.
What's the secret of her success?
"I never said no," says Hurd. "I
said, OK, if it has to be done, I'll
do it. It's people who are willing
to take on more and more respon
sibility, even if it's considered
mundane at the time, who get
rewarded. There's a great deal of
stress, and a lot of challenges. If
you're not self-confident and will
ing to dedicate your life to fulfill
your ambitions, you won't get
there."
Hurd's "someone's got to do it"
attitude has taken her from empty
ing chemical toilets in stars' motor

homes and making coffec as a
production assistant to independ
ently producing her own films. She
says, "People who have a good
attitude, who say 'I don't care what
I have to do', will get ahead."
She's encountered college grad
uates who feel that because they
have a degree, it means they are
going to start out at another level.
"That's a complete myth," says
Hurd. "Even what you learn
hands-on making student films,
except for the rare exception,
means nothing. It has no currency
in the real world because there
are so many people competing for
so few jobs."
Hurd is one of only a handful
of notable women film producers
in Hollywood today. Others in
clude Sherry Lansing ("Fatal At
traction", "The Accused"), Penny
Finkelman Cox ("Honey, I Shrunk
the Kids", "Broadcast News"),
Debra Hill ("Big Top Pee Wee"),
and Kathleen Kennedy ("Back to

the Future", "Who Framed Roger
Rabbit").
"There aren't many women fea
ture film producers," Hurd says.
"Sometimes there's a sense that
women lack strength — which is
obviously not true — but it's per
ceived in that way. Once you've
proved that you can handle a ..very
difficult film, then the studios and
financial people are more than
willing to take a chance on you
the next time. It's getting that
first shot that is really critical. As
more women have the credibility,
more women will be groomed to
take on that responsibility."
Born in Los Angeles as an only
child to an affluent family, Hurd
was raised in Palm Springs where
her father was a private investor
and entrepreneur. Hurd attended
Stanford, where she majored in
economics and communications.
Elected to Phi Beta Kappa in her
junior year, she graduated in 1977.

While a Stanford student, Hurd
spent the fall and winter quarters
of her junior year at the Stanford
program at Cliveden, England.
There she enrolled in several film
classes. The following year she en
rolled in the Summer Mass Media
Institute, sponsored each summer
by the Department of Communi
cations. She concentrated on the
broadcast news segment of the
program, and interned at KPIX
TV in San Francisco as part of
the course.
Prior to her studies in England,
Hurd says she really had no in
terest in film. "It wasn't something
that I even thought of as a career.
I think that's one great thing about
experiences at college — they can
change your life. Something
transcendental happens to you,
and your whole life takes a sharp
left-to-right turn. In a sense, there
was some serendipity involved,"
Hurd says.
Hurd was contemplating her fu

ture when, in her senior year, she
received a letter from the office
of director/producer Roger Cor
man (Stanford, Class of '47), then
head of New World Pictures. As
fate would have it, a former pro
fessor of communications at Stan
ford, Steven Kovacs, had recently
gone to work for Corman as Di
rector of Production. Hurd had
taken classes from Kovacs, and it
was this connection that led her
into the entertainment industry.
The letter from Corman read
"We've been trying to contact you
for a number of weeks regarding
employment. Please contact our
office as soon as possible to set
up a meeting." That now-famous
letter hangs framed on the wall
of Hurd's Pacific Western Produc
tions office on the Burbank Studios
Lot. "I wouldn't be here without
it," she says, beaming.
In 1978, Hurd left the Bay Area
and a failing marriage to a medical
student to work for Roger Corman.
She began her film career as one
of his personal assistants. The de
cision to leave the Bay Area was
not an easy one for Hurd.
"1 didn't want to give up the
Northern California lifestyle, to he
perfectly honest," she recalls.
"Even though I spent some time
growing up in Los Angeles, it was
not a place that 1 saw my future.
There is no nicer place in the
world than Woodside. But the idea
of living in Northern California
and pursuing a film career was not
something that crossed one's
mind."
Hurd prospered personally and
professionally under Corman, and
she credits him for much of her
success. Hurd says, "Roger Corman
believes that anyone with intelli
gence, ambition and talent can do
anything — and he instills that
belief in you — which is something
very, very rare in this business.
1 le would heap responsibility on
you, and the people who could
take it moved up very quickly."
While working for Corman,
Hurd met co-worker James
Cameron, a set builder and art
director. Cameron, 35, hailed from
Ontario, Canada. After a few years
Hurd and Cameron left New
World Pictures to form their own
partnership, where she would
produce, and he would write and
direct films.
In 1984, they co-wrote "The
Terminator," which she produced
and he directed. The action
thriller starred Arnold Schwar
zenegger and made over $100
million at the box office, and made
Hurd and Cameron bankable
names in Hollywood circles.
Hurd and Cameron married in
Hawaii six months after "Ter
minator" was released. During

their honeymoon, they prepared
for their next joint venture, a se
quel to the 1979 sci-fi thriller
"Alien." Cameron wrote and di
rected, while Hurd produced
"Aliens." (The 1986 film starred
Stanford alumna Sigourncy Wea
ver.) The movie was nominated
for seven Academy Awards, won
two, and grossed over $180 million
at the box office.
Between "Terminator" and
"Aliens," Cameron also co-wrote
the screenplay for "Rambo: First
Blood II," while Hurd developed
her own projects.
"The Abyss", with a budget
rumored to be somewhere between
$30 and $60 million, marks the
third collaboration between Hurd
and now ex-husband Cameron.
The duo separated before produc
tion on "Abyss" began, and were
divorced shortly after -filming
ended in December 1988.
Did this change of marital status
between the two impact their abil
ity to work together effectively on
the film? Hurd doesn't think so.
"Once you've created a profes
sional relationship, especially if it
preceded the personal relationship,
which ours did, there's not a prob
lem reverting to that. There's
never real acrimony between us,
and we were wise enough to realize
what worked in our relationship
— which was the professional
aspect — and what didn't," says
Hurd.
Ironically, the two main char
acters in"The Abyss" parallel
Hurd and Cameron. Bud and
Lindsay are an estranged husband
and wife forced to form an uneasy
but necessary alliance while work
ing on the ocean floor.
"'The Abyss' was the biggest
challenge of my life. I don't think
I will ever tackle anything as dif
ficult as this picture," says Hurd.
In addition to the technological
breakthroughs the film has to offer,
viewers are in for a treat with
"The Abyss," she says. "It's a very
emotional film — and it is a people

film that happens to have a lot
of wonderful technology. We don't
want to sell the epic quality of
the film short, but it is very much
a film about human conflict."
One of the most satisfying
aspects of "The Abyss" for Hurd
is "having tackled a film that al
most everyone who read the script
thought was impossible to make,
and making it. Knowing when you
started out that the technology
did not exist, and creating it in
time to make the movie, and
having the technology work so
well that it lives beyond the movie,
is a tremendously satisfying
feeling."
Underwater photographer A 1
Giddings ("The Deep", "For Your
Eyes Only", "Black Widow",
among others) of Ocean Images
in Oakland, Calif, concurs with
Hurd about the difficulty of
making "The Abyss." Giddings, a
veteran diver and photographer,

says "'The Abyss' is one of the
most physically demanding and ar
duous films ever done by anyone
in 1 lollywood. The film is 10 tech
nical layers beyond anything ever
done before.''
In spite of the difficulties in
volved in the film shoot, Giddings
has praise for Hurd. "I have the
greatest respect for her. Getting
something like this done was no
easy task. She is very, very capa
ble." As for director James
Cameron, Giddings says "he's an
extraordinary talent. Very driven
— very inspiring."
Today, Hurd presides over two
production companies: Pacific
Western Productions and No Frills
Films. She created the latter to
bring the work of first-time feature
directors to the screen.
With "The Abyss," which
opened in theaters Aug. 9, Hurd
is being put to a test almost as
challenging as filming the movie.

Originally slated for release Fourth
of July weekend, the premiere was
postponed twice. "Dates changed
because of the delivery of the spe
cial visual effects, which were
created for 'The Abyss'. They
didn't exist before," says Hurd.
The film will have to float in
a sea of summer sequels. And
many people are confused about
the name and theme of the movie.
Hurd says, "We've discovered that
people were not aware of what an
abyss is. It's not a term that's in
everyone's everyday vocabulary,
but is one that is essential to phi
losophy as well as religion. I think
that's the context people are more
used to, rather than just a physical
place, which is the way it is
referred to in this picture."
To clarify the murky waters sur
rounding the word abyss, Cameron
defines its use to mean "a deep
fissure in the earth; bottomless
gulf; chasm; too deep for measure
ment."
Misconceptions over the theme
of the movie may not be as easy
to dispel. "Based on the previous
films that Jim and 1 have made,
many people think "Abyss" is an
underwater monster movie, which
is nowhere near the case. It's very
emotional and very much a love
story," insists Hurd.
"'The Abyss' is a great roller
coaster ride that will reach and
entertain a much broader audience
than the films that we've under
taken in the past," she says. On
that note, Hurd rises from her
chair, fortifies herself with one last
swallow of Diet Coke, reaches for
her appointment book and sun
glasses, and heads for the door.
Pausing, she says, "It's an in
triguing movie and I think therein
lies its appeal, as well as the dif
ficulty in marketing it," smiling as
she heads down the hallway for a
meeting with Fox's advertising and
publicity staff.

is "having tackled a film that al

Gale Anne Hurd has established herself as one of Hollywood's
hottest young producers.
Many people in the entertain
ment industry begin their careers
in the notorious mailroom, or as
personal assistants to producers
and directors. But few make it to
the top, as "The Abyss" producer
Gale Anne Hurd, 33, has done.
And she has done so as a woman
in male-dominated Hollywood.
What's the secret of her success?
"I never said no," says Hurd. "I
said, OK, if it has to be done, I'll
do it. It's people who are willing
to take on more and more respon
sibility, even if it's considered
mundane at the time, who get
rewarded. There's a great deal of
stress, and a lot of challenges. If
you're not self-confident and will
ing to dedicate your life to fulfill
your ambitions, you won't get
there."
Hurd's "someone's got to do it"
attitude has taken her from empty
ing chemical toilets in stars' motor

homes and making coffec as a
production assistant to independ
ently producing her own films. She
says, "People who have a good
attitude, who say 'I don't care what
I have to do', will get ahead."
She's encountered college grad
uates who feel that because they
have a degree, it means they are
going to start out at another level.
"That's a complete myth," says
Hurd. "Even what you learn
hands-on making student films,
except for the rare exception,
means nothing. It has no currency
in the real world because there
are so many people competing for
so few jobs."
Hurd is one of only a handful
of notable women film producers
in Hollywood today. Others in
clude Sherry Lansing ("Fatal At
traction", "The Accused"), Penny
Finkelman Cox ("Honey, I Shrunk
the Kids", "Broadcast News"),
Debra Hill ("Big Top Pee Wee"),
and Kathleen Kennedy ("Back to

the Future", "Who Framed Roger
Rabbit").
"There aren't many women fea
ture film producers," Hurd says.
"Sometimes there's a sense that
women lack strength — which is
obviously not true — but it's per
ceived in that way. Once you've
proved that you can handle a ..very
difficult film, then the studios and
financial people are more than
willing to take a chance on you
the next time. It's getting that
first shot that is really critical. As
more women have the credibility,
more women will be groomed to
take on that responsibility."
Born in Los Angeles as an only
child to an affluent family, Hurd
was raised in Palm Springs where
her father was a private investor
and entrepreneur. Hurd attended
Stanford, where she majored in
economics and communications.
Elected to Phi Beta Kappa in her
junior year, she graduated in 1977.

While a Stanford student, Hurd
spent the fall and winter quarters
of her junior year at the Stanford
program at Cliveden, England.
There she enrolled in several film
classes. The following year she en
rolled in the Summer Mass Media
Institute, sponsored each summer
by the Department of Communi
cations. She concentrated on the
broadcast news segment of the
program, and interned at KPIX
TV in San Francisco as part of
the course.
Prior to her studies in England,
Hurd says she really had no in
terest in film. "It wasn't something
that I even thought of as a career.
I think that's one great thing about
experiences at college — they can
change your life. Something
transcendental happens to you,
and your whole life takes a sharp
left-to-right turn. In a sense, there
was some serendipity involved,"
Hurd says.
Hurd was contemplating her fu

ture when, in her senior year, she
received a letter from the office
of director/producer Roger Cor
man (Stanford, Class of '47), then
head of New World Pictures. As
fate would have it, a former pro
fessor of communications at Stan
ford, Steven Kovacs, had recently
gone to work for Corman as Di
rector of Production. Hurd had
taken classes from Kovacs, and it
was this connection that led her
into the entertainment industry.
The letter from Corman read
"We've been trying to contact you
for a number of weeks regarding
employment. Please contact our
office as soon as possible to set
up a meeting." That now-famous
letter hangs framed on the wall
of Hurd's Pacific Western Produc
tions office on the Burbank Studios
Lot. "I wouldn't be here without
it," she says, beaming.
In 1978, Hurd left the Bay Area
and a failing marriage to a medical
student to work for Roger Corman.
She began her film career as one
of his personal assistants. The de
cision to leave the Bay Area was
not an easy one for Hurd.
"1 didn't want to give up the
Northern California lifestyle, to he
perfectly honest," she recalls.
"Even though I spent some time
growing up in Los Angeles, it was
not a place that 1 saw my future.
There is no nicer place in the
world than Woodside. But the idea
of living in Northern California
and pursuing a film career was not
something that crossed one's
mind."
Hurd prospered personally and
professionally under Corman, and
she credits him for much of her
success. Hurd says, "Roger Corman
believes that anyone with intelli
gence, ambition and talent can do
anything — and he instills that
belief in you — which is something
very, very rare in this business.
1 le would heap responsibility on
you, and the people who could
take it moved up very quickly."
While working for Corman,
Hurd met co-worker James
Cameron, a set builder and art
director. Cameron, 35, hailed from
Ontario, Canada. After a few years
Hurd and Cameron left New
World Pictures to form their own
partnership, where she would
produce, and he would write and
direct films.
In 1984, they co-wrote "The
Terminator," which she produced
and he directed. The action
thriller starred Arnold Schwar
zenegger and made over $100
million at the box office, and made
Hurd and Cameron bankable
names in Hollywood circles.
Hurd and Cameron married in
Hawaii six months after "Ter
minator" was released. During

their honeymoon, they prepared
for their next joint venture, a se
quel to the 1979 sci-fi thriller
"Alien." Cameron wrote and di
rected, while Hurd produced
"Aliens." (The 1986 film starred
Stanford alumna Sigourncy Wea
ver.) The movie was nominated
for seven Academy Awards, won
two, and grossed over $180 million
at the box office.
Between "Terminator" and
"Aliens," Cameron also co-wrote
the screenplay for "Rambo: First
Blood II," while Hurd developed
her own projects.
"The Abyss", with a budget
rumored to be somewhere between
$30 and $60 million, marks the
third collaboration between Hurd
and now ex-husband Cameron.
The duo separated before produc
tion on "Abyss" began, and were
divorced shortly after -filming
ended in December 1988.
Did this change of marital status
between the two impact their abil
ity to work together effectively on
the film? Hurd doesn't think so.
"Once you've created a profes
sional relationship, especially if it
preceded the personal relationship,
which ours did, there's not a prob
lem reverting to that. There's
never real acrimony between us,

Lindsay are an estranged husband
and wife forced to form an uneasy

Born in Los Angeles as an only
child to an affluent family, Hurd
was raised in Palm Springs where
her father was a private investor
and entrepreneur. Hurd attended
Stanford, where she majored in
economics and communications.
Elected to Phi Beta Kappa in her
junior year, she graduated in 1977.

While a Stanford student, Hurd
spent the fall and winter quarters
of her junior year at the Stanford
program at Cliveden, England.
There she enrolled in several film
classes. The following year she en
rolled in the Summer Mass Media
Institute, sponsored each summer
by the Department of Communi

broadcast news segment of the
program, and interned at KPIX
TV in San Francisco as part of
the course.
Prior to her studies in England,
Hurd says she really had no in
terest in film. "It wasn't something
that I even thought of as a career.
I think that's one great thing about
experiences at college — they can
change your life. Something
transcendental happens to you,
and your whole life takes a sharp
left-to-right turn. In a sense, there
was some serendipity involved,"
Hurd says.
Hurd was contemplating her fu

ture when, in her senior year, she
received a letter from the office
of director/producer Roger Cor
man (Stanford, Class of '47), then
head of New World Pictures. As
fate would have it, a former pro
fessor of communications at Stan
ford, Steven Kovacs, had recently
gone to work for Corman as Di
rector of Production. Hurd had
taken classes from Kovacs, and it
was this connection that led her
into the entertainment industry.
The letter from Corman read
"We've been trying to contact you
for a number of weeks regarding
employment. Please contact our
office as soon as possible to set
up a meeting." That now-famous
letter hangs framed on the wall
of Hurd's Pacific Western Produc
tions office on the Burbank Studios
Lot. "I wouldn't be here without
it," she says, beaming.
In 1978, Hurd left the Bay Area
and a failing marriage to a medical
student to work for Roger Corman.
She began her film career as one
of his personal assistants. The de
cision to leave the Bay Area was
not an easy one for Hurd.
"1 didn't want to give up the
Northern California lifestyle, to he
perfectly honest," she recalls.
"Even though I spent some time
growing up in Los Angeles, it was
not a place that 1 saw my future.
There is no nicer place in the
world than Woodside. But the idea
of living in Northern California
and pursuing a film career was not
something that crossed one's
mind."
Hurd prospered personally and
professionally under Corman, and
she credits him for much of her
success. Hurd says, "Roger Corman
believes that anyone with intelli
gence, ambition and talent can do
anything — and he instills that
belief in you — which is something
very, very rare in this business.
1 le would heap responsibility on
you, and the people who could
take it moved up very quickly."
While working for Corman,
Hurd met co-worker James
Cameron, a set builder and art
director. Cameron, 35, hailed from
Ontario, Canada. After a few years
Hurd and Cameron left New
World Pictures to form their own
partnership, where she would
produce, and he would write and
direct films.
In 1984, they co-wrote "The
Terminator," which she produced
and he directed. The action
thriller starred Arnold Schwar
zenegger and made over $100
million at the box office, and made
Hurd and Cameron bankable
names in Hollywood circles.
Hurd and Cameron married in
Hawaii six months after "Ter

their honeymoon, they prepared
for their next joint venture, a se

"Alien." Cameron wrote and di

"Aliens." (The 1986 film starred
Stanford alumna Sigourncy Wea
ver.) The movie was nominated
for seven Academy Awards, won
two, and grossed over $180 million
at the box office.
Between "Terminator" and
"Aliens," Cameron also co-wrote
the screenplay for "Rambo: First
Blood II," while Hurd developed
her own projects.
"The Abyss", with a budget
rumored to be somewhere between
$30 and $60 million, marks the
third collaboration between Hurd
and now ex-husband Cameron.
The duo separated before produc
tion on "Abyss" began, and were
divorced shortly after -filming
ended in December 1988.
Did this change of marital status
between the two impact their abil
ity to work together effectively on
the film? Hurd doesn't think so.
"Once you've created a profes
sional relationship, especially if it
preceded the personal relationship,
which ours did, there's not a prob
lem reverting to that. There's
never real acrimony between us,
and we were wise enough to realize
what worked in our relationship
— which was the professional
aspect — and what didn't," says
Hurd.
Ironically, the two main char
acters in"The Abyss" parallel
Hurd and Cameron. Bud and
Lindsay are an estranged husband
and wife forced to form an uneasy
but necessary alliance while work
ing on the ocean floor.
"'The Abyss' was the biggest
challenge of my life. I don't think
I will ever tackle anything as dif
ficult as this picture," says Hurd.
In addition to the technological
breakthroughs the film has to offer,
viewers are in for a treat with
"The Abyss," she says. "It's a very
emotional film — and it is a people

film that happens to have a lot
of wonderful technology. We don't
want to sell the epic quality of
the film short, but it is very much
a film about human conflict."
One of the most satisfying
aspects of "The Abyss" for Hurd
is "having tackled a film that al
most everyone who read the script
thought was impossible to make,
and making it. Knowing when you
started out that the technology
did not exist, and creating it in
time to make the movie, and
having the technology work so
well that it lives beyond the movie,
is a tremendously satisfying
feeling."
Underwater photographer A 1
Giddings ("The Deep", "For Your

among others) of Ocean Images
in Oakland, Calif, concurs with
Hurd about the difficulty of
making "The Abyss." Giddings, a
veteran diver and photographer,

says "'The Abyss' is one of the
most physically demanding and ar

in 1 lollywood. The film is 10 tech

done before.''
In spite of the difficulties in
volved in the film shoot, Giddings
has praise for Hurd. "I have the
greatest respect for her. Getting
something like this done was no
easy task. She is very, very capa
ble." As for director James
Cameron, Giddings says "he's an
extraordinary talent. Very driven
— very inspiring."
Today, Hurd presides over two
production companies: Pacific
Western Productions and No Frills
Films. She created the latter to
bring the work of first-time feature
directors to the screen.
With "The Abyss," which
opened in theaters Aug. 9, Hurd
is being put to a test almost as
challenging as filming the movie.

Originally slated for release Fourth
of July weekend, the premiere was
postponed twice. "Dates changed
because of the delivery of the spe
cial visual effects, which were
created for 'The Abyss'. They
didn't exist before," says Hurd.
The film will have to float in
a sea of summer sequels. And
many people are confused about
the name and theme of the movie.
Hurd says, "We've discovered that
people were not aware of what an
abyss is. It's not a term that's in
everyone's everyday vocabulary,
but is one that is essential to phi
losophy as well as religion. I think
that's the context people are more
used to, rather than just a physical
place, which is the way it is
referred to in this picture."
To clarify the murky waters sur
rounding the word abyss, Cameron
defines its use to mean "a deep
fissure in the earth; bottomless
gulf; chasm; too deep for measure
ment."
Misconceptions over the theme
of the movie may not be as easy
to dispel. "Based on the previous
films that Jim and 1 have made,
many people think "Abyss" is an
underwater monster movie, which
is nowhere near the case. It's very
emotional and very much a love
story," insists Hurd.
"'The Abyss' is a great roller
coaster ride that will reach and
entertain a much broader audience
than the films that we've under
taken in the past," she says. On
that note, Hurd rises from her
chair, fortifies herself with one last
swallow of Diet Coke, reaches for
her appointment book and sun
glasses, and heads for the door.
Pausing, she says, "It's an in
triguing movie and I think therein
lies its appeal, as well as the dif
ficulty in marketing it," smiling as
she heads down the hallway for a
meeting with Fox's advertising and
publicity staff.

Gale Anne Hurd has established herself as one of Hollywood's
hottest young producers.
Many people in the entertain
ment industry begin their careers
in the notorious mailroom, or as
personal assistants to producers
and directors. But few make it to
the top, as "The Abyss" producer
Gale Anne Hurd, 33, has done.
And she has done so as a woman
in male-dominated Hollywood.
What's the secret of her success?
"I never said no," says Hurd. "I
said, OK, if it has to be done, I'll
do it. It's people who are willing
to take on more and more respon
sibility, even if it's considered
mundane at the time, who get
rewarded. There's a great deal of
stress, and a lot of challenges. If
you're not self-confident and will
ing to dedicate your life to fulfill
your ambitions, you won't get
there."
Hurd's "someone's got to do it"
attitude has taken her from empty
ing chemical toilets in stars' motor

homes and making coffec as a
production assistant to independ
ently producing her own films. She
says, "People who have a good
attitude, who say 'I don't care what
I have to do', will get ahead."
She's encountered college grad
uates who feel that because they
have a degree, it means they are
going to start out at another level.
"That's a complete myth," says
Hurd. "Even what you learn
hands-on making student films,
except for the rare exception,
means nothing. It has no currency
in the real world because there
are so many people competing for
so few jobs."
Hurd is one of only a handful
of notable women film producers
in Hollywood today. Others in
clude Sherry Lansing ("Fatal At
traction", "The Accused"), Penny
Finkelman Cox ("Honey, I Shrunk
the Kids", "Broadcast News"),
Debra Hill ("Big Top Pee Wee"),
and Kathleen Kennedy ("Back to

the Future", "Who Framed Roger
Rabbit").
"There aren't many women fea
ture film producers," Hurd says.
"Sometimes there's a sense that
women lack strength — which is
obviously not true — but it's per
ceived in that way. Once you've
proved that you can handle a ..very
difficult film, then the studios and
financial people are more than
willing to take a chance on you
the next time. It's getting that
first shot that is really critical. As
more women have the credibility,
more women will be groomed to
take on that responsibility."
Born in Los Angeles as an only

easy task. She is very, very capa
ble." As for director James
Cameron, Giddings says "he's an
extraordinary talent. Very driven
— very inspiring."
Today, Hurd presides over two
production companies: Pacific
Western Productions and No Frills
Films. She created the latter to
bring the work of first-time feature
directors to the screen.
With "The Abyss," which
opened in theaters Aug. 9, Hurd
is being put to a test almost as
challenging as filming the movie.

Originally slated for release Fourth
of July weekend, the premiere was
postponed twice. "Dates changed
because of the delivery of the spe
cial visual effects, which were
created for 'The Abyss'. They
didn't exist before," says Hurd.
The film will have to float in
a sea of summer sequels. And
many people are confused about
the name and theme of the movie.
Hurd says, "We've discovered that
people were not aware of what an
abyss is. It's not a term that's in
everyone's everyday vocabulary,
but is one that is essential to phi
losophy as well as religion. I think
that's the context people are more
used to, rather than just a physical
place, which is the way it is
referred to in this picture."
To clarify the murky waters sur
rounding the word abyss, Cameron
defines its use to mean "a deep
fissure in the earth; bottomless
gulf; chasm; too deep for measure
ment."
Misconceptions over the theme
of the movie may not be as easy
to dispel. "Based on the previous
films that Jim and 1 have made,
many people think "Abyss" is an
underwater monster movie, which
is nowhere near the case. It's very
emotional and very much a love
story," insists Hurd.
"'The Abyss' is a great roller
coaster ride that will reach and
entertain a much broader audience
than the films that we've under
taken in the past," she says. On
that note, Hurd rises from her
chair, fortifies herself with one last
swallow of Diet Coke, reaches for
her appointment book and sun
glasses, and heads for the door.
Pausing, she says, "It's an in
triguing movie and I think therein
lies its appeal, as well as the dif
ficulty in marketing it," smiling as
she heads down the hallway for a
meeting with Fox's advertising and
publicity staff.
