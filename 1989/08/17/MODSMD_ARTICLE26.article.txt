"Modern Primitives" documents
the revival of a distinctive form
of cultural rebellion — the mod
ification of the human body
through tattoos, piercings and
scars. Through in-depth interviews
and explicit photographs, editors
V. Vale and Andrea Juno seek to
understand why a growing number
of Americans alter their physical
form through so-called "primitive"
ritualistic and symbolic practices.
The book begins with a profile
of Fakir Musafar, a 52-year-old
Silicon Valley advertising execu
tive who has systematically per
formed "virtually every body
modification and ritual practice
known to man." Musafar, who
took his name from a 19th-century
Persian Sufi, first pierced the fore
skin of his penis at age 13, has
constricted his waist to 14 inches,
attached 24 one-pound weights to
his chest and hung from a tree
by "fleshhooks" threaded through
his breasts.
"During the course of (our) din
ner," write the editors, "(Fakir)

proceeded to remove his tie, insert
a large bone through his nose, and
work two three-eigths inch steel
circlets into each earlobe, remark
ing, 'There — I feel much more
comfortable.' Then he unbuttoned
his white broadcloth shirt and in
serted twin pearl-handled daggers
into two holes in his chest, forming
an open 'V' pattern."
In addition to the interview with
Musafar, "Modern Primitives" in
cludes transcribed discussions with
"Tattoo Mike," who was recently
featured in Bruce Springsteen's
"Tunnel of Love" video, Don Ed
Hardy, one of the world's foremost
tattoo artists and historians, An
ton LaVey, founder of the Church
of Satan in San Francisco, and
artists Genesis and Paula P-
Orridge.
The book's photographs provide
a vivid glimpse of beautiful, mov
ing tattoos as well as forms of
adornment, such as clitoral pierc
ings, that are perhaps more aes
thetically ambiguous.
Those interviewed vary in their
personal experience with both
body modification and the occult,
but all of them share a visceral
need to break from ordinary social
restraints and obtain a level of
