"Modern Primitives" documents
the revival of a distinctive form
of cultural rebellion — the mod
ification of the human body
through tattoos, piercings and
scars. Through in-depth interviews
and explicit photographs, editors
V. Vale and Andrea Juno seek to
understand why a growing number
of Americans alter their physical
form through so-called "primitive"
ritualistic and symbolic practices.
The book begins with a profile
of Fakir Musafar, a 52-year-old
Silicon Valley advertising execu
tive who has systematically per
formed "virtually every body
modification and ritual practice
known to man." Musafar, who
took his name from a 19th-century
Persian Sufi, first pierced the fore
skin of his penis at age 13, has
constricted his waist to 14 inches,
attached 24 one-pound weights to
his chest and hung from a tree
by "fleshhooks" threaded through
his breasts.
"During the course of (our) din
ner," write the editors, "(Fakir)

proceeded to remove his tie, insert
a large bone through his nose, and
work two three-eigths inch steel
circlets into each earlobe, remark
ing, 'There — I feel much more
comfortable.' Then he unbuttoned
his white broadcloth shirt and in
serted twin pearl-handled daggers
into two holes in his chest, forming
an open 'V' pattern."
In addition to the interview with
Musafar, "Modern Primitives" in
cludes transcribed discussions with
"Tattoo Mike," who was recently
featured in Bruce Springsteen's
"Tunnel of Love" video, Don Ed
Hardy, one of the world's foremost
tattoo artists and historians, An
ton LaVey, founder of the Church
of Satan in San Francisco, and
artists Genesis and Paula P-
Orridge.
The book's photographs provide
a vivid glimpse of beautiful, mov
ing tattoos as well as forms of
adornment, such as clitoral pierc
ings, that are perhaps more aes
thetically ambiguous.
Those interviewed vary in their
personal experience with both
body modification and the occult,
but all of them share a visceral
need to break from ordinary social
restraints and obtain a level of

consciousness denied by moder
nity's progressive and "logical"
creed. These individuals are not
"anti-modernists." They are
"modern primitives," individuals
who seek to integrate the "poetic
imagination" into contemporary
experience.
Twentieth-century American
history, of course, is littered with
rebels who have sought to obtain
a higher level of consciousness
through a cult of intense bodily
experience and explicitly personal
liberation.
These dissenters, from William
Randolph Bourne to Norman
Mailer, have been fascinated with
"primitive" societies, buried levels
of being and "natural" experience;
however, while they were superfi
cially at odds with modern society,
they often perpetuated its narcis
sistic, consumerist values.
Arc the forms of body modifi
cation described in Vale and Juno's
book really "modern primitive,"
then, or just "modern?"
The answer to this question cer
tainly depends on the "modern
primitive" to whom you are speak
ing, on the extent to which a

person gives him or herself to a
transcendent and transformative
vision.
Still, this reviewer is distrustful
of radical, schizophrenic shifts in
personal habits, and the fact that,
for instance, Musafar can be both
an advertising executive and prac
tice body modifications suggests
that the two experiences are not
inconsistent, that, to paraphrase
historian Jackson Lcars, bohemian
and bureaucrat are brothers under
the skin.
"(A) good shamanistic answer
to Why do these things?," says
Musafar, like a true member of
Madison Avenue, "is because it's
fun! It's more fun than getting on
a bus and going to work in the
morning. It's more fun than going
to college and getting a Ph.D. It's
more fun for you, and it can some
times be a lot more fun for people
around you. I mean: what's wrong
with that. Js there a law against
having fun?"
This thickly-woven, wonderful
book will probably shock you, but
you shouldn't shy away. Body mod
ification is a form of personal
adornment practiced by many
different peoples, and to remain
uniformed about the phenomenon
would be to deprive yourself of
the deep learning that one can
achieve from its studv.
