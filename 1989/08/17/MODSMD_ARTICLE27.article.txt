# Re/Search Publications explores society's margins
## 
### Mark Tompkins Staff writer 
It's the sort of setting that would be
ideal for a crime novel: a steep back alley
in San Francisco, hidden away behind some
of the supremely tacky strip joints on Broad
way. You wouldn't expect to tind a pub
lishing venture there, especially not one as
daring and imaginative as Re/Search Pub
lications.
Twelve years ago, V. Vale was one of
the earliest members of San Francisco's
punk scene, when "punk rock" had yet to
enter the national vocabulary. An astute
observer, Vale began publishing "Search and
Destroy," a fanzine that increasingly sought
to track the negationist punk sensibility
throughout American culture, not just in
music. After two years, Vale gave up, feeling
that punk had lost its original meaning.

In the early '80s, Vale met Andrea Juno,
who shared his ideas about modernity, and
together they launched Re/Search Publica
tions. Their mission, they say, is to stimulate
creativity by providing information about
marginalized elements of culture. Working
entirely on their own, Vale and Juno really
research the topics which fascinate them
— topics that have been ignored or reviled
by academic and mainstream tastes.
The result is a series of beautifully de
signed volumes, each focusing on a different
aspect of American life. Vale and Juno
examine their obsessions without ever
sounding pretentious or over-intellectual;
they're determined to make their ideas ac
cessible. Different Re/Search volumes have
covered post-punk "Industrial Music" cul
ture, "Naked Lunch" author William Bur
roughs, and the world of splatter and
sexploitation films. They have also pub

lishcd a volume dedicated to the study of
"Empire of the Sun" author J.G Ballard.
Vale and Juno aren't rolling in dough.
They still work out of a single studio. Their
'office' is crammed with books, papers and
videotapes. As 1 talked with them, it was
clear that they've really thought out what
they're doing. Filled with interesting ideas,
they were friendly, good-natured and
humorous.
I really was struck by your statement,
"We encourage the development of ob
sessions even to the point of perversity."
So much of the stuff you do really is
about subcultures —
VALE: That's what we came out of, a
subculture. We came out of punk rock. It's
an enlightening experience to go through
something like that, in which you're sub
jected to the complete spectrum of social

ostracism. You're forced into some kind of
negation whether you want to or not, a
wholesale negation of society's symbols and
values.
Since you come out of that culture,
how much attention do you pay to main
stream culture? Do you keep up with
what's going on, or do you just not bother?
VALE: We read the Sunday paper.
Andrea watches the news in the evening.
JUNO: I don't really feel that there are
these boundaries to which we define our
selves. One can pick out a lot of (valuable)
things from mainstream culture, and there
are a lot of things in the so-called "under
grounds" that are really mindless and not
worthy of pursuit. I don't think that we
really like those kind of labels of what's
mainstream and what's under
ground. It's far more our own ob
sessions, which really aren't
defined by (any) culture.
The observation has been
made that subcultures often have
their own rules, and can be just
as rigified as "straight" culture.
VALE: Oh yeah, dogma is ev
erywhere! (Laughs)
JUNO: But then again, we're
not the ones who are defining the
subcultures. We're going about our
own obsessions. We pursue the
things that we enjoy.
VALE: We put out information,
and it's not up to us how rigidly
or how originally people interpret
it.
It seems that the observation
that subcultures often have their
own rules doesn't really apply to
you, because you're not really
doing anything that's trendy. Es
pecially by avoiding music, you're
not doing something which is
"the latest." You're just doing
your own thing.
JUNO: We don't really feel like

we've ever been fashionable.
(Laughs). Since it's a hopeless, lost
cause, there's no point in captur
ing it now.
And we're fanatical. One of our
tenets is against the crystallization
of thought, of dogma, of the kind
of ossification of thought that
prevents creativity. Our whole
goal is to perpetuate creativity in
ourselves and others. Therefore
any dogmas that come about are
the very things that you have to
smash.
Even a book like "Industrial
Culture Handbook," which we did
in 1982 — so much of that is
different now, and so you have to
smash it. I mean, doing some ga
rage band and pounding on some
metal right now is probably the
most cliched and also, in a certain
sense, the most conservative thing
that you can do.
VALE: In the "Industrial Cul
ture Handbook," Genesis said that
there'd be labels in record stores
all over the world, "Industrial
Music." It's hard to believe it, but
it came true really fast! (Laughs)
JUNO: You need to know when
to go on to the next subject.
VALE: One of the underpin
nings of what we do, that will
never change, is a continuing cri
tique of society. You have to do

that, just to keep yourself alive.
It's nice to hear you say you
really believe in what you're
doing. There's so much irony,
and so much of a camp sen
sibility, in the media. People al
ways distance themselves. They
don't take anything seriously.
JUNO: It's a really sick thing,
and in a sense it's part of the
control process, to ensure that the
really important ideas become
camp, or out-of-fashion, or that
there develops some kind of
derogatory attitude, or superiority
toward these things.
For instance, when we first pub
lished the "Incredibly Strange
Films" book, there had been things
like the Golden Turkey Awards.
These are fantastic films that we
can learn a lot about. Especially
in light of the films that are being
made in Hollywood now, they have
more creativity per frame than any
of those.
And yet there was always this
kind of jock humor like, "Huh
huh, isn't this disgusting" — this
real superiority, that then keeps
that information from ever really
affecting you. That's what keeps
people from ever taking power,
and taking control.
