# Re/Search Publications explores society's margins
## 
### Mark Tompkins Staff writer 
It's the sort of setting that would be
ideal for a crime novel: a steep back alley
in San Francisco, hidden away behind some
of the supremely tacky strip joints on Broad
way. You wouldn't expect to tind a pub
lishing venture there, especially not one as
daring and imaginative as Re/Search Pub
lications.
Twelve years ago, V. Vale was one of
the earliest members of San Francisco's
punk scene, when "punk rock" had yet to
enter the national vocabulary. An astute
observer, Vale began publishing "Search and
Destroy," a fanzine that increasingly sought
to track the negationist punk sensibility
throughout American culture, not just in
music. After two years, Vale gave up, feeling
that punk had lost its original meaning.

In the early '80s, Vale met Andrea Juno,
who shared his ideas about modernity, and
together they launched Re/Search Publica
tions. Their mission, they say, is to stimulate
creativity by providing information about
marginalized elements of culture. Working
entirely on their own, Vale and Juno really
research the topics which fascinate them
— topics that have been ignored or reviled
by academic and mainstream tastes.
The result is a series of beautifully de
signed volumes, each focusing on a different
aspect of American life. Vale and Juno
examine their obsessions without ever
sounding pretentious or over-intellectual;
they're determined to make their ideas ac
cessible. Different Re/Search volumes have
covered post-punk "Industrial Music" cul
ture, "Naked Lunch" author William Bur
roughs, and the world of splatter and
sexploitation films. They have also pub

lishcd a volume dedicated to the study of
"Empire of the Sun" author J.G Ballard.
Vale and Juno aren't rolling in dough.
They still work out of a single studio. Their
'office' is crammed with books, papers and
videotapes. As 1 talked with them, it was
clear that they've really thought out what
they're doing. Filled with interesting ideas,
they were friendly, good-natured and
humorous.
I really was struck by your statement,
"We encourage the development of ob
sessions even to the point of perversity."
So much of the stuff you do really is
about subcultures —
VALE: That's what we came out of, a
subculture. We came out of punk rock. It's
an enlightening experience to go through
something like that, in which you're sub
jected to the complete spectrum of social

ostracism. You're forced into some kind of
negation whether you want to or not, a
wholesale negation of society's symbols and
values.
Since you come out of that culture,
how much attention do you pay to main
stream culture? Do you keep up with
what's going on, or do you just not bother?
VALE: We read the Sunday paper.
Andrea watches the news in the evening.
JUNO: I don't really feel that there are
these boundaries to which we define our
selves. One can pick out a lot of (valuable)
things from mainstream culture, and there
are a lot of things in the so-called "under
grounds" that are really mindless and not
worthy of pursuit. I don't think that we
really like those kind of labels of what's
