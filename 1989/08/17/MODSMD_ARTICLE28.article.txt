## Wanda Corn finds her roots in American art 
### Mark Weiner Editorial staff 
If you mention the name Wanda
Corn to art history students at
Stanford, you'll get a predictable
reaction.
Students' faces brighten, they
smile, and they begin to sing her
praises — even if they've never
taken one of her courses.
An associate professor of art
history at Stanford, Corn will be
come chair of the Art Department
and acting director of the Stanford
Museum this fall.
Corn received her Ph.D. from
the Institute of Fine Arts, New
York University in 1974. She has
been a Regents Fellow at the
Smithsonian Institution, a fellow
at the Woodrow Wilson Interna
tional Center for Scholars and a
Phi Beta Kappa Visiting Scholar.
A champion and early student
of American art, Corn has taught
"American Art and Culture in the
Gilded Age," "Paris and New
York: Transatlantic Exchange in
Early Modernism," "Culture in
Crisis: American Art in the
19305," "American Art after World
War II" and "Consumer Culture
and the Visual Arts."
How did you become an art his
torian?
Can I rephrase the question?
How did you become an histo
rian of American art is more in
teresting. I was always interested
in history, and somewhere in my
college years I discovered that
there was a whole new world in
visual experience that was just as
rich as verbal sources. I decided

I wanted to be an art historian,
and 1 was off and running.
At that time, however, to do
art history — at least in my mind
— meant that you studied the
European old masters. My first in
terests, in fact, were in medieval
art. I studied for two years abroad
and concentrated on medieval ar
chitecture. When I went to grad
uate school, I applied as a student
of medieval art.
In my second semester of grad
uate school, though, I had an un
usual experience. My father and
mother had two portraits hanging
on the dining room wall. My family
was not a collecting family. We
didn't have many paintings except
for some old ones that comple
mented the furnishings of our early
19th-century Connecticut valley
house.
But these two paintings were
suddenly invited to be in an ex
hibition. I was shocked, because I
never knew we had paintings that
were exhibition quality. I knew
they were unsigned paintings, but
I didn't know that they had been
identified to be those of an
itinerant American artist traveling
the Connecticut river valley —
Erastus Salisbury Field. Erastus
Salisbury Field was the topic of
interest of a professor at Amherst
who put together this exhibition
and asked my parents to loan the
paintings.
Well, I went to see the exhibi
tion, and I was bowled over to
sec the two portraits I had lived
with all my youth in a museum
setting. 1 really had something that
amounted to a conversion expe
rience. I realized that here I had
lived with pieccs of American art

all my life and didn't know a thing
about this country's art. 1 was be
coming an expert in the art of old
Europe.
Right then and there, I deter
mined that 1 would take a reading
course in American art. I had to
take a reading coursc because
there were no formal courses on
American art in the school in
which I was studying. That was
the fact the country over in the
mid-19605. The history of Ameri
can art simply wasn't taught.
1 did my reading coursc and
realized that there was 300 years'
worth of American art that had
very little work done on it. I was
fascinated by the stuff. At that
point, I determined that 1 would
be something of a pioneer and a
maverick in relation to my peers
and superiors, and would take on
a field where there really was no
advising.
So that is how I ended up in
American art. The reason why
that's the more interesting ques
tion is because American art didn't
really exist in the academy in the
mid-'6os. In fact, I'm the first his
torian of American art to have a
permanent position at Stanford.
Why did American art later
gain popularity as a field of ac
ademic study?
My story isn't that atypical be
cause there were several of my
generation who decided that
American art was undeservedly
cast aside as being provincial. One
always felt sorry for American art
ists. Their art lacked great aes
thetic import and it was thought
unworthy of study.

In the early 19605, when every
body was turning upside down the
ways they had thought about
things for a long time, a number
of people began to feel as it Amer
ican art had a lot to teach us
about the American experience
and about American history. Very
tentatively and without much
tutelage, they began to venture
into the field.
So one answer to your question
is that it was the times. People
were rethinking and reinventing
the way we interpret art. And one
of the ways we were reinventing
it was to think of art as important
as cultural documents, regardless
of whether or not it provided the
highest of aesthetic experiences.
I want to quickly add that a
lot of American art is aesthetically
beautiful, undiscovered perhaps at
that time. It is just that in the
'60s, it became more important to
think about the ways in which
visual artists digest and interpret
a culture. Regardless of whether
they are first or second rank, artists
have always had something to say
about the culture into which they
were born.
So the rise in popularity of
American art as a field of historical
study was partially a product of
that shift from aesthetics to cul
ture, from examining great mas
terpieces to viewing artists as
interpreters of culture.
What are some of the lessons
that you've learned from your
study of American art?
Let me redirect that. One of
the reasons I went into American
art was that it was fun to be
studying a subject that's not over
worked. I wasn't looking at Dante
and Shakespeare. I was looking at
artists like John Singleton Copley
and Grant Wood.
It's always intellectually chal
lenging to be the first or second
investigator rather than the 100 th.
It means you do a lot more spade
work, because you don't have that
much to rely on. There is a whole
generation of historians of Amer
ican art out there who have spent
their hours of research doing good
old-fashioned archival work, just
to get the basics out and into the
open. So that's one reason that it
was rewarding to study American
art.
Another reason, and I don't
want this to sound at all chauvinis
tic — because I've always denied
that there's chauvinism here — is
that in American art, you have a
pretty spectacular body of work.
There was some need then and 1
think still is today to validate and
redeem America's visual culture.

You want to belong to a culture
that didn't just have wars and
presidents and an occasional good
novelist.
You also wanted people to know
that this was a culture that had
produced jazz and Aaron Copland,
and some great portraitists and
landscapists and early modernists
— but without ever overrating
them. I've never thought that 1
am working on Picasso when I
work on Charles Demuth, hut I
find the questions Demuth's work
poses sufficiently complex and in
teresting.
What can students gain from
the study of art history that they
can't gain from other courses at
Stanford?
1 love the question!
I really believe in "visual
literacy." We are a culture that
puts incredible faith in the written
word and very little credence in
abstract or visual thinking. There's
a wo r d for this — we're
logocentric.
One thing 1 think students can
get from any of our art history
courses is a very elementary thing,
and that is how to look. For most
people a painting of an 18th
century man in a wig and formal
suit with his hand tucked into the
jacket is nothing more than a
stuffy old portrait.
Yet when I look at something
like that, 1 immediately begin to
ask about the class connotations
of the clothes he's wearing, what
his gesture means, why there is a
telescope on the table next to
him, or why he is looking to the
left. It raises a plethora of ques
tions for me that I think are as
important as the questions we
would ask if we were reading a
diary or a newspaper.
So what 1 call visual literacy is
the number one lesson that we
teach. Unless we learn the art of
seeing, we miss a great deal of
what our cultural commentators
of the past have said. Visual people
often give us data that we can't
get through other communica
tions.
What sort of data?
For instance, take the study of
mid-19th century American cul
ture, when every student reads
Emerson, Thoreau and Whitman,
and learns a great deal about the
way in which these various figures
looked at the world, particularly
in regards to Transcendentalism,
the oversoul and the oneness of
all things.
Now the artists of this period
had many of the same ideas and
translated them into landscape
