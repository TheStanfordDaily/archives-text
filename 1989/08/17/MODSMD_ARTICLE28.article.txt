## Wanda Corn finds her roots in American art 
### Mark Weiner Editorial staff 
If you mention the name Wanda
Corn to art history students at
Stanford, you'll get a predictable
reaction.
Students' faces brighten, they
smile, and they begin to sing her
praises — even if they've never
taken one of her courses.
An associate professor of art
history at Stanford, Corn will be
come chair of the Art Department
and acting director of the Stanford
Museum this fall.
Corn received her Ph.D. from
the Institute of Fine Arts, New
York University in 1974. She has
been a Regents Fellow at the
Smithsonian Institution, a fellow
at the Woodrow Wilson Interna
tional Center for Scholars and a
Phi Beta Kappa Visiting Scholar.
A champion and early student
of American art, Corn has taught
"American Art and Culture in the
Gilded Age," "Paris and New
York: Transatlantic Exchange in
Early Modernism," "Culture in
Crisis: American Art in the
19305," "American Art after World
War II" and "Consumer Culture
and the Visual Arts."
How did you become an art his
torian?
Can I rephrase the question?
How did you become an histo
rian of American art is more in
teresting. I was always interested
in history, and somewhere in my
college years I discovered that
there was a whole new world in
visual experience that was just as
rich as verbal sources. I decided

I wanted to be an art historian,
and 1 was off and running.
At that time, however, to do
art history — at least in my mind
— meant that you studied the
European old masters. My first in
terests, in fact, were in medieval
art. I studied for two years abroad
and concentrated on medieval ar
chitecture. When I went to grad
uate school, I applied as a student
of medieval art.
In my second semester of grad
uate school, though, I had an un
usual experience. My father and
mother had two portraits hanging
on the dining room wall. My family
was not a collecting family. We
didn't have many paintings except
for some old ones that comple
mented the furnishings of our early
19th-century Connecticut valley
house.
But these two paintings were
suddenly invited to be in an ex
hibition. I was shocked, because I
never knew we had paintings that
were exhibition quality. I knew
they were unsigned paintings, but
I didn't know that they had been
identified to be those of an
itinerant American artist traveling
the Connecticut river valley —
Erastus Salisbury Field. Erastus
Salisbury Field was the topic of
interest of a professor at Amherst
who put together this exhibition
and asked my parents to loan the
paintings.
Well, I went to see the exhibi
tion, and I was bowled over to
sec the two portraits I had lived
with all my youth in a museum
setting. 1 really had something that
amounted to a conversion expe
rience. I realized that here I had
lived with pieccs of American art

all my life and didn't know a thing
about this country's art. 1 was be
coming an expert in the art of old
Europe.
Right then and there, I deter
mined that 1 would take a reading
course in American art. I had to
take a reading coursc because
there were no formal courses on
American art in the school in
which I was studying. That was
the fact the country over in the
mid-19605. The history of Ameri
can art simply wasn't taught.
1 did my reading coursc and
realized that there was 300 years'
worth of American art that had
very little work done on it. I was
fascinated by the stuff. At that
point, I determined that 1 would
be something of a pioneer and a
maverick in relation to my peers
and superiors, and would take on
a field where there really was no
advising.
So that is how I ended up in
American art. The reason why
that's the more interesting ques
tion is because American art didn't
really exist in the academy in the
mid-'6os. In fact, I'm the first his
torian of American art to have a
permanent position at Stanford.
Why did American art later
gain popularity as a field of ac
ademic study?
My story isn't that atypical be
cause there were several of my
generation who decided that
American art was undeservedly
cast aside as being provincial. One
always felt sorry for American art
ists. Their art lacked great aes
thetic import and it was thought
unworthy of study.

In the early 19605, when every
body was turning upside down the
ways they had thought about
things for a long time, a number
of people began to feel as it Amer
ican art had a lot to teach us
about the American experience
and about American history. Very
tentatively and without much
tutelage, they began to venture
into the field.
So one answer to your question
is that it was the times. People
were rethinking and reinventing
the way we interpret art. And one
of the ways we were reinventing
it was to think of art as important
as cultural documents, regardless
of whether or not it provided the
highest of aesthetic experiences.
I want to quickly add that a
lot of American art is aesthetically
beautiful, undiscovered perhaps at
that time. It is just that in the
'60s, it became more important to
think about the ways in which
visual artists digest and interpret
a culture. Regardless of whether
they are first or second rank, artists
have always had something to say
about the culture into which they
were born.
So the rise in popularity of
American art as a field of historical
study was partially a product of
that shift from aesthetics to cul
ture, from examining great mas
terpieces to viewing artists as
interpreters of culture.
What are some of the lessons
that you've learned from your
study of American art?
Let me redirect that. One of
the reasons I went into American
art was that it was fun to be
studying a subject that's not over
worked. I wasn't looking at Dante
and Shakespeare. I was looking at
artists like John Singleton Copley
and Grant Wood.
It's always intellectually chal
lenging to be the first or second
investigator rather than the 100 th.
It means you do a lot more spade
work, because you don't have that
much to rely on. There is a whole
generation of historians of Amer
ican art out there who have spent
their hours of research doing good
old-fashioned archival work, just
to get the basics out and into the
open. So that's one reason that it
was rewarding to study American
art.
Another reason, and I don't
want this to sound at all chauvinis
tic — because I've always denied
that there's chauvinism here — is
that in American art, you have a
pretty spectacular body of work.
There was some need then and 1
think still is today to validate and
redeem America's visual culture.

You want to belong to a culture
that didn't just have wars and
presidents and an occasional good
novelist.
You also wanted people to know
that this was a culture that had
produced jazz and Aaron Copland,
and some great portraitists and
landscapists and early modernists
— but without ever overrating
them. I've never thought that 1
am working on Picasso when I
work on Charles Demuth, hut I
find the questions Demuth's work
poses sufficiently complex and in
teresting.
What can students gain from
the study of art history that they
can't gain from other courses at
Stanford?
1 love the question!
I really believe in "visual
literacy." We are a culture that
puts incredible faith in the written
word and very little credence in
abstract or visual thinking. There's
a wo r d for this — we're
logocentric.
One thing 1 think students can
get from any of our art history
courses is a very elementary thing,
and that is how to look. For most
people a painting of an 18th
century man in a wig and formal
suit with his hand tucked into the
jacket is nothing more than a
stuffy old portrait.
Yet when I look at something
like that, 1 immediately begin to
ask about the class connotations
of the clothes he's wearing, what
his gesture means, why there is a
telescope on the table next to
him, or why he is looking to the
left. It raises a plethora of ques
tions for me that I think are as
important as the questions we
would ask if we were reading a
diary or a newspaper.
So what 1 call visual literacy is
the number one lesson that we
teach. Unless we learn the art of
seeing, we miss a great deal of
what our cultural commentators
of the past have said. Visual people
often give us data that we can't
get through other communica
tions.
What sort of data?
For instance, take the study of
mid-19th century American cul
ture, when every student reads
Emerson, Thoreau and Whitman,
and learns a great deal about the
way in which these various figures
looked at the world, particularly
in regards to Transcendentalism,
the oversoul and the oneness of
all things.
Now the artists of this period
had many of the same ideas and
translated them into landscape


Andrew
paintings. I would suggest that
these paintings really give the
viewer an emotional, transccnden
talist experience in ways Emerson
never could get through in words.
He could never get his reader high
on nature in the same way artists
did at the time.
So on one hand, I think you
often get in art a kind of gut level,
visceral experience that writers
don't always convey, because they
arc stuck with words and sen
tences. Words and sentences take
time to absorb and comprehend.
Pictures can be taken in all at
once and really move the spirit!
I even think you get new kinds
of information through the visual
arts. I don't mean they replace
verbal evidence, but they add to
it. Learning how to read paintings
and photographs enriches the way
you look at a particular cultural
moment.
Studying art also helps one un
derstand the degree to which we

all mediate the world we live in.
Nature, for instance, was a very
contrived element in mid-19th
century art. It was also in Emerson,
although we tend to think that
Emerson is talking about every
one's notion of a mountain range
or a bucolic country scene in New
England.
One of the things landscape
paintings help you see is that mid
19th century Americans had very
set notions of what made for a
pleasing experience in nature.
They weren't open to everything.
They were more interested in wil
derness than they were in domestic
gardens, for instance.
Now there is cultural meaning
in such choices and priorities.
When seen as a cultural text, art
can help you understand what a
figure like Emerson meant when
he used a loaded term like "na
ture."
On the one hand, Stanford in
general is lucky to have a strong
and frequent series of programs
pertaining to the visual arts. On
the other, in the student com
munity, the visual arts seem to
be fairly marginal. Can you com
ment on the marginality of the
study of art in the University?
From my perspective, with stu
dents filling our classes every quar
ter, it's hard to think of it quite
that way.
But we are one of the smaller
departments. We're also a depart
ment that is really two depart
ments within one. Half our
department teaches studio art and
half our department are historians
of art.

We're not only a small depart
ment, we're a young department
as well. Art has long been taught
here, but it hasn't had the depth
of faculty and the depth of cur
riculum it has now until relatively
recently.
But I agree with you. Art is not
central the way literature or his
tory or even the languages are.
That has partially to do with the
way we come to perceive the hu
manities very early on. Art plays
such a small role in our primary
and secondary schools.
It's too bad that many students
don't study art and become at
tuned to aesthetic experience
while at Stanford, especially
given that we're surrounded by
so much art in the form of public
sculpture.
What do you think students
think about the sculpture on
campus?

I get the sense that for most,
art is what's in a museum. When
you're in a museum, you know
there's art there. When you're
outside, the aesthetic experience
is somehow different than that
which is confined within the
museum space.
If you mean that students don't
take the sculpture seriously or look
at it very hard, that's too bad.
The sculpture on campus is of
very high quality. How do we
break through this?
A lot of people come to study
art after they have been shell
shocked into realizing how little
they know about it. That often
happens in Europe. There's noth
ing better for the study of art at
Stanford than the large number of
students who study abroad, where
their ignorance shows up and they
want to do something about it.
You said in a lecture a few
years ago that art will increas
ingly be brought more "to the
people." What did you mean by
that?
One of the things that has been
very obvious in the last 20 years
or so has been that art is no longer
confined to museums. Just the fact
that we have as much public sculp
ture on campus is evidence of art
moving outside museum walls and
into our everyday spaces. People
have to confront sculpture when
they walk across Stanford's
campus.
Since art for many people is a
scary experience, or not a common
experience, I like the fact that
sculpture has moved into spaces

that are not traditionally thought
of as showcases for art. Right now
we have a wonderful exhibition
in the art gallery about Christo's
art. Christo is one of the major
figures of our time who has de
termined that his art will be a
public art, made for and by the
people.
Part of his art is negotiating
with people and showing them
that something splendid, wonder
ful, transient and life-enhancing is
going to happen in their backyards
if they give permission for their
backyards to be stages for his work.
I think Christo's large-scale envi
ronmental pieces, like the "Run
ning Fence," have been ex
hilarating and very liberating. He
has showed others how to put art
into open public spaces.
Another kind of public art is
the revival in mural painting. We
have good examples of this at Casa
Zapata, where contemporary
murals decorate the walls of stair
wells and public rooms.

Are there any peculiar histor
ical circumstances that make it
difficult for art to be political?
I'm thinking particularly of the
invasion of the public space by
large corporate structures.
People within the art profes
sions today are constantly on
watch for ways in which corporate
support might infringe upon free
dom of expression. There's a great
sensitivity and worry amongst art
ists, art historians and museum
curators about the very strong and
obvious presence of corporate
funding for the arts.
1 think most artists would prob
ably argue that it doesn't affect
them directly in their making of
art. It may effect, however, the
way in which art is exhibited, the
way in which art is bought and
how artists' reputations are made.
Reputations arc made very often
by being represented in corporate
collections. Yet corporate collec
tions are not likely to be made
up of art that is against con
sumerism, art about gender in
equities or cultural imperialism.
That kind of art is hard on the
stomach and hard on the head
and not always easy to take in
and digest. Corporate collections
are often made up of casy-to-digest
works of art.
There is good reason to worry
and keep an eye out for ways in
which sources of money may skew
or interfere with the workings not
just of the mind but of the mar
ketplace.
In the next few months, you'll
hold two new administrative
posts. What do you hope to ac
complish in those capacities?
I'm going to become chair of
the Art Department this fall, but
I've also been asked to be acting
director of the Stanford museum
for next year. So I've got two
fronts to think about.
One of the things that I'm very
interested in doing is making sure
that the campus community
knows about us. Very often the
Art Department is seen as a

remote corner of campus over
there in the shadow of Hoover.
The museum is somewhere out
there in the meadows going
towards Palo Alto. I'm astounded
at how many students go through
Stanford without having even
stuck their noses in the museum.
One of the things that I'm
looking forward to doing is putting
out tentacles and hauling in un
suspecting students.
I would love to figure out ways
to have more student activities in
the museum, perhaps in the eve
ning, when students have freer
schedules. Perhaps there could be
moonlight walks through the
Rodin garden. I need some help
on this, actually. I'm going to put

munity knows

partment is seen

shadow of Hoover.

out a call for undergraduate ac
tivism on behalf of the museum
and arts.
I also would like to put together
a core of undergraduates who
would enjoy taking other under
graduates through the museum or
on tours of the public sculpture
and murals on campus. 1 think
students often listen to their peers
better than they listen to their
teachers or docents.
I'm also looking to try more
combined activities between
museum and department. We had
an example of this last spring. In
the museum, we had an exhibition
of caricatures drawn from our own
holdings. At the same time, the
department offered a course on
the history of caricature, and we
held an all-day public symposium
on the topic. It was a three
pronged event that brought to
gether both sides of the art
program. I'd like to do more of
that.
Another thing we're going to
try to do is to give students ex
perience in creating and installing
exhibitions. We have graduate stu
dents here who are anxious to try
their hands at being curators and
learn the museum ropes. This can
also apply to undergraduates.
0.K., 1 have to ask, What do
you love so much about "Amer
ican Gothic?"
(Laughs) Oh, I love "American
Gothic" because it's always a
source of good interviews!
You collect all sorts of popular
culture permutations of the
painting . . .
That's right, I get at least one

good one every week. People send
them to me from all over the
country.
What first attracted you to the
painting?
Back in the early 1960s I
decided Grant Wood's "American
Gothic" was a painting that I had
to understand. I just had to crack
it. At the time, abstract art was
all the rage in New York City.
Grant Wood was the bad boy of
the 1930s who had dumped on
modernism and produced a kind
of down-home, folksy realism. I
just had to understand this paint
ing, which the art establishment
hated but the cartoonists loved.
Take-offs of "American Gothic"
were beginning to appear regularly
in popular culture.
I always thought that 1 was in
terested in the painting because
Grant Wood came from the Mid
west. My mother and father both
came from the Midwest. My grand
father was a farmer who looked
like that bean pole of a man in
the painting. Grandad wore bibbed
overalls, rimless glasses and was
balding. As a child, whenever I
saw that painting I thought it was
a version of my grandfather.
Added to that was the fact that
"American Gothic" was a naughty
painting for a serious intellectual
to think about. It was a naughty
painting to consider in the early
'60s because it was an anathema
to the art community. You weren't
supposed to look at realist art;
you certainly weren't supposed to
take regionalist art of the '30s
seriously. 1 was prompted to study
it because no one else was making
any effort to understand why the
painting had become such a
popular icon in today's culture.
And then, the more I thought
about it, the more I realized that
there was another dimension to
this project that I wasn't at all
conscious of at the time. In the
'60s many bccame very conscious
of their origins and ethnicity. Alex
Haley was doing his roots and I
now realize that I was doing mine.
I'm not a Midwestern kid, I'm
New England born and bred, but
I have a family that is very Mid
western in many of its habits of
mind and speech. The way my
mother lays out a table at Thanks
giving or Christmas is right out
of farm culture style. There were
things about my family that I came
to understand while doing research
on this painting. That thrilled me.
I had never thought of myself
as having come from traditions
other than suburban America. But
I now realize that my suburban
American experience was grafted
onto something that went deep
into the past and deep into an
other region of the country.
So now, when people ask me
what attracts me to that painting,
I say it has to do with family
heritage and roots and this crazy
thing we each call our American
ness. Something resonates in the
painting for me. It values that sort
of stubbornness and strong-willed
independence that I recognize in
myself, in my family and in my
past.

looked at the world, particularly
in regards to Transcendentalism,

paintings. I would suggest that
these paintings really give the
viewer an emotional, transccnden
talist experience in ways Emerson
never could get through in words.
He could never get his reader high
on nature in the same way artists
did at the time.
So on one hand, I think you
often get in art a kind of gut level,
visceral experience that writers
don't always convey, because they
arc stuck with words and sen
tences. Words and sentences take
time to absorb and comprehend.
Pictures can be taken in all at
once and really move the spirit!
I even think you get new kinds
of information through the visual
arts. I don't mean they replace

all mediate the world we live in.
Nature, for instance, was a very
contrived element in mid-19th
century art. It was also in Emerson,
although we tend to think that
Emerson is talking about every
one's notion of a mountain range
or a bucolic country scene in New
England.
One of the things landscape
paintings help you see is that mid
19th century Americans had very
set notions of what made for a
pleasing experience in nature.
They weren't open to everything.
They were more interested in wil
derness than they were in domestic
gardens, for instance.
Now there is cultural meaning
in such choices and priorities.
When seen as a cultural text, art
can help you understand what a
figure like Emerson meant when
he used a loaded term like "na
ture."
On the one hand, Stanford in
general is lucky to have a strong
and frequent series of programs
pertaining to the visual arts. On
the other, in the student com
munity, the visual arts seem to
be fairly marginal. Can you com
ment on the marginality of the
study of art in the University?
From my perspective, with stu
dents filling our classes every quar
ter, it's hard to think of it quite
that way.
But we are one of the smaller
departments. We're also a depart
ment that is really two depart
ments within one. Half our
department teaches studio art and
half our department are historians
of art.

We're not only a small depart
ment, we're a young department
as well. Art has long been taught
here, but it hasn't had the depth
of faculty and the depth of cur
riculum it has now until relatively
recently.
But I agree with you. Art is not
central the way literature or his
tory or even the languages are.
That has partially to do with the
way we come to perceive the hu
manities very early on. Art plays
such a small role in our primary
and secondary schools.
It's too bad that many students
don't study art and become at
tuned to aesthetic experience
while at Stanford, especially
given that we're surrounded by
so much art in the form of public
sculpture.
What do you think students
think about the sculpture on
campus?

I get the sense that for most,
art is what's in a museum. When
you're in a museum, you know
there's art there. When you're
outside, the aesthetic experience
is somehow different than that
which is confined within the
museum space.
If you mean that students don't
take the sculpture seriously or look
at it very hard, that's too bad.
The sculpture on campus is of
very high quality. How do we
break through this?
A lot of people come to study
art after they have been shell
shocked into realizing how little
they know about it. That often
happens in Europe. There's noth
ing better for the study of art at
Stanford than the large number of
students who study abroad, where
their ignorance shows up and they
want to do something about it.
You said in a lecture a few
years ago that art will increas
ingly be brought more "to the
people." What did you mean by
that?
One of the things that has been
very obvious in the last 20 years
or so has been that art is no longer
confined to museums. Just the fact
that we have as much public sculp
ture on campus is evidence of art
moving outside museum walls and
into our everyday spaces. People
have to confront sculpture when
they walk across Stanford's
campus.
Since art for many people is a
scary experience, or not a common
experience, I like the fact that
sculpture has moved into spaces

that are not traditionally thought
of as showcases for art. Right now
we have a wonderful exhibition
in the art gallery about Christo's
art. Christo is one of the major
figures of our time who has de
termined that his art will be a
public art, made for and by the
people.
Part of his art is negotiating
with people and showing them
that something splendid, wonder
ful, transient and life-enhancing is
going to happen in their backyards
if they give permission for their
backyards to be stages for his work.
I think Christo's large-scale envi
ronmental pieces, like the "Run
ning Fence," have been ex
hilarating and very liberating. He
has showed others how to put art
into open public spaces.
Another kind of public art is
the revival in mural painting. We
have good examples of this at Casa
Zapata, where contemporary
murals decorate the walls of stair
wells and public rooms.

Are there any peculiar histor
ical circumstances that make it
difficult for art to be political?
I'm thinking particularly of the
invasion of the public space by
large corporate structures.
People within the art profes
sions today are constantly on
watch for ways in which corporate
support might infringe upon free
dom of expression. There's a great
sensitivity and worry amongst art
ists, art historians and museum
curators about the very strong and
obvious presence of corporate
funding for the arts.
1 think most artists would prob
ably argue that it doesn't affect
them directly in their making of
art. It may effect, however, the
way in which art is exhibited, the
way in which art is bought and
how artists' reputations are made.
Reputations arc made very often
by being represented in corporate
collections. Yet corporate collec
tions are not likely to be made
up of art that is against con
sumerism, art about gender in
equities or cultural imperialism.
That kind of art is hard on the
stomach and hard on the head
and not always easy to take in
and digest. Corporate collections
are often made up of casy-to-digest
works of art.
There is good reason to worry
and keep an eye out for ways in
which sources of money may skew
or interfere with the workings not
just of the mind but of the mar
ketplace.
In the next few months, you'll
hold two new administrative
posts. What do you hope to ac
complish in those capacities?
I'm going to become chair of
the Art Department this fall, but
I've also been asked to be acting
director of the Stanford museum
for next year. So I've got two
fronts to think about.
One of the things that I'm very
interested in doing is making sure
that the campus community
knows about us. Very often the
Art Department is seen as a

remote corner of campus over
there in the shadow of Hoover.
The museum is somewhere out
there in the meadows going
towards Palo Alto. I'm astounded
at how many students go through
Stanford without having even
stuck their noses in the museum.
One of the things that I'm
looking forward to doing is putting
out tentacles and hauling in un
suspecting students.
I would love to figure out ways
to have more student activities in
the museum, perhaps in the eve
ning, when students have freer
schedules. Perhaps there could be
moonlight walks through the
Rodin garden. I need some help
on this, actually. I'm going to put

out a call for undergraduate ac
tivism on behalf of the museum
and arts.
I also would like to put together
a core of undergraduates who
would enjoy taking other under
graduates through the museum or
on tours of the public sculpture
and murals on campus. 1 think
students often listen to their peers
better than they listen to their
teachers or docents.
I'm also looking to try more
combined activities between
museum and department. We had
an example of this last spring. In
the museum, we had an exhibition
of caricatures drawn from our own
holdings. At the same time, the
department offered a course on
the history of caricature, and we
held an all-day public symposium
on the topic. It was a three
pronged event that brought to
gether both sides of the art
program. I'd like to do more of
that.
Another thing we're going to
try to do is to give students ex
perience in creating and installing
exhibitions. We have graduate stu
dents here who are anxious to try
their hands at being curators and
learn the museum ropes. This can
also apply to undergraduates.
0.K., 1 have to ask, What do
you love so much about "Amer
ican Gothic?"
(Laughs) Oh, I love "American
Gothic" because it's always a
source of good interviews!
You collect all sorts of popular
culture permutations of the
painting . . .
That's right, I get at least one

good one every week. People send
them to me from all over the
country.
What first attracted you to the
painting?
Back in the early 1960s I
decided Grant Wood's "American
Gothic" was a painting that I had
to understand. I just had to crack
it. At the time, abstract art was
all the rage in New York City.
Grant Wood was the bad boy of
the 1930s who had dumped on
modernism and produced a kind
of down-home, folksy realism. I
just had to understand this paint
ing, which the art establishment
hated but the cartoonists loved.
Take-offs of "American Gothic"
were beginning to appear regularly
in popular culture.
I always thought that 1 was in
terested in the painting because
Grant Wood came from the Mid
west. My mother and father both
came from the Midwest. My grand
father was a farmer who looked
like that bean pole of a man in
the painting. Grandad wore bibbed
overalls, rimless glasses and was
balding. As a child, whenever I
saw that painting I thought it was
a version of my grandfather.
Added to that was the fact that
"American Gothic" was a naughty
painting for a serious intellectual
to think about. It was a naughty
painting to consider in the early
'60s because it was an anathema
to the art community. You weren't
supposed to look at realist art;
you certainly weren't supposed to
take regionalist art of the '30s
seriously. 1 was prompted to study
it because no one else was making
any effort to understand why the
painting had become such a
popular icon in today's culture.
And then, the more I thought
about it, the more I realized that
there was another dimension to
this project that I wasn't at all
conscious of at the time. In the
'60s many bccame very conscious
of their origins and ethnicity. Alex
Haley was doing his roots and I
now realize that I was doing mine.
I'm not a Midwestern kid, I'm
New England born and bred, but
I have a family that is very Mid
western in many of its habits of
mind and speech. The way my
mother lays out a table at Thanks
giving or Christmas is right out
of farm culture style. There were
things about my family that I came
to understand while doing research
on this painting. That thrilled me.
I had never thought of myself
as having come from traditions
other than suburban America. But
I now realize that my suburban
American experience was grafted
onto something that went deep
into the past and deep into an
other region of the country.
So now, when people ask me
what attracts me to that painting,
I say it has to do with family
heritage and roots and this crazy
thing we each call our American
ness. Something resonates in the
painting for me. It values that sort
of stubbornness and strong-willed
independence that I recognize in
myself, in my family and in my
past.
If you mention the name Wanda
Corn to art history students at
Stanford, you'll get a predictable
reaction.
Students' faces brighten, they
smile, and they begin to sing her
praises — even if they've never
taken one of her courses.
An associate professor of art
history at Stanford, Corn will be
come chair of the Art Department
and acting director of the Stanford
Museum this fall.
Corn received her Ph.D. from
the Institute of Fine Arts, New
York University in 1974. She has
been a Regents Fellow at the
Smithsonian Institution, a fellow
at the Woodrow Wilson Interna
tional Center for Scholars and a
Phi Beta Kappa Visiting Scholar.
A champion and early student
of American art, Corn has taught
"American Art and Culture in the
Gilded Age," "Paris and New
York: Transatlantic Exchange in
Early Modernism," "Culture in
Crisis: American Art in the
19305," "American Art after World
War II" and "Consumer Culture
and the Visual Arts."
How did you become an art his
torian?
Can I rephrase the question?
How did you become an histo
rian of American art is more in
teresting. I was always interested
in history, and somewhere in my
college years I discovered that
there was a whole new world in
visual experience that was just as
rich as verbal sources. I decided

I wanted to be an art historian,
and 1 was off and running.
At that time, however, to do
art history — at least in my mind
— meant that you studied the
European old masters. My first in
terests, in fact, were in medieval
art. I studied for two years abroad
and concentrated on medieval ar
chitecture. When I went to grad
uate school, I applied as a student
of medieval art.
In my second semester of grad
uate school, though, I had an un
usual experience. My father and
mother had two portraits hanging
on the dining room wall. My family
was not a collecting family. We
didn't have many paintings except
for some old ones that comple
mented the furnishings of our early
19th-century Connecticut valley
house.
But these two paintings were
suddenly invited to be in an ex
hibition. I was shocked, because I
never knew we had paintings that
were exhibition quality. I knew
they were unsigned paintings, but
I didn't know that they had been
identified to be those of an
itinerant American artist traveling
the Connecticut river valley —
Erastus Salisbury Field. Erastus
Salisbury Field was the topic of
interest of a professor at Amherst
who put together this exhibition
and asked my parents to loan the
paintings.
Well, I went to see the exhibi
tion, and I was bowled over to
sec the two portraits I had lived
with all my youth in a museum
setting. 1 really had something that
amounted to a conversion expe
rience. I realized that here I had
lived with pieccs of American art

all my life and didn't know a thing
about this country's art. 1 was be
coming an expert in the art of old
Europe.
Right then and there, I deter
mined that 1 would take a reading
course in American art. I had to
take a reading coursc because
there were no formal courses on
American art in the school in
which I was studying. That was
the fact the country over in the
mid-19605. The history of Ameri
can art simply wasn't taught.
1 did my reading coursc and
realized that there was 300 years'
worth of American art that had
very little work done on it. I was
fascinated by the stuff. At that
point, I determined that 1 would
be something of a pioneer and a
maverick in relation to my peers
and superiors, and would take on
a field where there really was no
advising.
So that is how I ended up in
American art. The reason why
that's the more interesting ques
tion is because American art didn't
really exist in the academy in the
mid-'6os. In fact, I'm the first his
torian of American art to have a
permanent position at Stanford.
Why did American art later
gain popularity as a field of ac
ademic study?
My story isn't that atypical be
cause there were several of my
generation who decided that
American art was undeservedly
cast aside as being provincial. One
always felt sorry for American art
ists. Their art lacked great aes
thetic import and it was thought
unworthy of study.

In the early 19605, when every
body was turning upside down the
ways they had thought about
things for a long time, a number
of people began to feel as it Amer
ican art had a lot to teach us
about the American experience
and about American history. Very
tentatively and without much
tutelage, they began to venture
into the field.
So one answer to your question
is that it was the times. People
were rethinking and reinventing
the way we interpret art. And one
of the ways we were reinventing
it was to think of art as important
as cultural documents, regardless
of whether or not it provided the
highest of aesthetic experiences.
I want to quickly add that a
lot of American art is aesthetically
beautiful, undiscovered perhaps at
that time. It is just that in the
'60s, it became more important to
think about the ways in which
visual artists digest and interpret
a culture. Regardless of whether
they are first or second rank, artists
have always had something to say
about the culture into which they
were born.
So the rise in popularity of
American art as a field of historical
study was partially a product of
that shift from aesthetics to cul
ture, from examining great mas
terpieces to viewing artists as
interpreters of culture.
What are some of the lessons
that you've learned from your
study of American art?
Let me redirect that. One of
the reasons I went into American
art was that it was fun to be
studying a subject that's not over
worked. I wasn't looking at Dante
and Shakespeare. I was looking at
artists like John Singleton Copley
and Grant Wood.
It's always intellectually chal
lenging to be the first or second
investigator rather than the 100 th.
It means you do a lot more spade
work, because you don't have that
much to rely on. There is a whole
generation of historians of Amer
ican art out there who have spent
their hours of research doing good
old-fashioned archival work, just
to get the basics out and into the
open. So that's one reason that it
was rewarding to study American
art.
Another reason, and I don't
want this to sound at all chauvinis
tic — because I've always denied
that there's chauvinism here — is
that in American art, you have a
pretty spectacular body of work.
There was some need then and 1
think still is today to validate and
redeem America's visual culture.

You want to belong to a culture
that didn't just have wars and
presidents and an occasional good
novelist.
You also wanted people to know
that this was a culture that had
produced jazz and Aaron Copland,
and some great portraitists and
landscapists and early modernists
— but without ever overrating
them. I've never thought that 1
am working on Picasso when I
work on Charles Demuth, hut I
find the questions Demuth's work
poses sufficiently complex and in
teresting.
What can students gain from
the study of art history that they
can't gain from other courses at
Stanford?
1 love the question!
I really believe in "visual
literacy." We are a culture that
puts incredible faith in the written
word and very little credence in
abstract or visual thinking. There's
a wo r d for this — we're
logocentric.
One thing 1 think students can
get from any of our art history
courses is a very elementary thing,
and that is how to look. For most
people a painting of an 18th
century man in a wig and formal
suit with his hand tucked into the
jacket is nothing more than a
stuffy old portrait.
Yet when I look at something
like that, 1 immediately begin to
ask about the class connotations
of the clothes he's wearing, what
his gesture means, why there is a
telescope on the table next to
him, or why he is looking to the
left. It raises a plethora of ques
tions for me that I think are as
important as the questions we
would ask if we were reading a
diary or a newspaper.
So what 1 call visual literacy is
the number one lesson that we
teach. Unless we learn the art of
seeing, we miss a great deal of
what our cultural commentators
of the past have said. Visual people
often give us data that we can't
get through other communica
tions.
What sort of data?
For instance, take the study of
mid-19th century American cul
ture, when every student reads
Emerson, Thoreau and Whitman,
and learns a great deal about the
way in which these various figures
looked at the world, particularly
in regards to Transcendentalism,
the oversoul and the oneness of
all things.

museum and department. We had
an example of this last spring. In
the museum, we had an exhibition
of caricatures drawn from our own
holdings. At the same time, the
department offered a course on
the history of caricature, and we
held an all-day public symposium
on the topic. It was a three
pronged event that brought to
gether both sides of the art
program. I'd like to do more of
that.
Another thing we're going to
try to do is to give students ex
perience in creating and installing
exhibitions. We have graduate stu
dents here who are anxious to try
their hands at being curators and
learn the museum ropes. This can
also apply to undergraduates.
0.K., 1 have to ask, What do
you love so much about "Amer
ican Gothic?"
(Laughs) Oh, I love "American
Gothic" because it's always a
source of good interviews!
You collect all sorts of popular
culture permutations of the
painting . . .
That's right, I get at least one

good one every week. People send
them to me from all over the
country.
What first attracted you to the
painting?
Back in the early 1960s I
decided Grant Wood's "American
Gothic" was a painting that I had
to understand. I just had to crack
it. At the time, abstract art was
all the rage in New York City.
Grant Wood was the bad boy of
the 1930s who had dumped on
modernism and produced a kind
of down-home, folksy realism. I
just had to understand this paint
ing, which the art establishment
hated but the cartoonists loved.
Take-offs of "American Gothic"
were beginning to appear regularly
in popular culture.
I always thought that 1 was in
terested in the painting because
Grant Wood came from the Mid
west. My mother and father both
came from the Midwest. My grand
father was a farmer who looked
like that bean pole of a man in
the painting. Grandad wore bibbed
overalls, rimless glasses and was
balding. As a child, whenever I
saw that painting I thought it was
a version of my grandfather.
Added to that was the fact that
"American Gothic" was a naughty
painting for a serious intellectual
to think about. It was a naughty
painting to consider in the early
'60s because it was an anathema
to the art community. You weren't
supposed to look at realist art;
you certainly weren't supposed to
take regionalist art of the '30s
seriously. 1 was prompted to study
it because no one else was making
any effort to understand why the
painting had become such a
popular icon in today's culture.
And then, the more I thought
about it, the more I realized that
there was another dimension to
this project that I wasn't at all
conscious of at the time. In the
'60s many bccame very conscious
of their origins and ethnicity. Alex
Haley was doing his roots and I
now realize that I was doing mine.
I'm not a Midwestern kid, I'm
New England born and bred, but
I have a family that is very Mid
western in many of its habits of
mind and speech. The way my
mother lays out a table at Thanks
giving or Christmas is right out
of farm culture style. There were
things about my family that I came
to understand while doing research
on this painting. That thrilled me.
I had never thought of myself
as having come from traditions
other than suburban America. But
I now realize that my suburban
American experience was grafted
onto something that went deep
into the past and deep into an
other region of the country.
So now, when people ask me
what attracts me to that painting,
I say it has to do with family
heritage and roots and this crazy
thing we each call our American
ness. Something resonates in the
painting for me. It values that sort
of stubbornness and strong-willed
independence that I recognize in
myself, in my family and in my
past.

Corn to art history students at

Students' faces brighten, they

praises — even if they've never

An associate professor of art
history at Stanford, Corn will be
come chair of the Art Department
and acting director of the Stanford
Museum this fall.
Corn received her Ph.D. from
the Institute of Fine Arts, New
York University in 1974. She has
been a Regents Fellow at the
Smithsonian Institution, a fellow
at the Woodrow Wilson Interna
tional Center for Scholars and a
Phi Beta Kappa Visiting Scholar.
A champion and early student
of American art, Corn has taught
"American Art and Culture in the
Gilded Age," "Paris and New
York: Transatlantic Exchange in
Early Modernism," "Culture in
Crisis: American Art in the
19305," "American Art after World
War II" and "Consumer Culture
and the Visual Arts."
How did you become an art his
torian?
Can I rephrase the question?
How did you become an histo
rian of American art is more in
teresting. I was always interested
in history, and somewhere in my
college years I discovered that
there was a whole new world in
visual experience that was just as
rich as verbal sources. I decided

I wanted to be an art historian,
and 1 was off and running.
At that time, however, to do
art history — at least in my mind
— meant that you studied the
European old masters. My first in
terests, in fact, were in medieval
art. I studied for two years abroad
and concentrated on medieval ar
chitecture. When I went to grad
uate school, I applied as a student
of medieval art.
In my second semester of grad
uate school, though, I had an un
usual experience. My father and
mother had two portraits hanging
on the dining room wall. My family
was not a collecting family. We
didn't have many paintings except
for some old ones that comple
mented the furnishings of our early
19th-century Connecticut valley
house.
But these two paintings were
suddenly invited to be in an ex
hibition. I was shocked, because I
never knew we had paintings that
were exhibition quality. I knew
they were unsigned paintings, but
I didn't know that they had been
identified to be those of an
itinerant American artist traveling
the Connecticut river valley —
Erastus Salisbury Field. Erastus
Salisbury Field was the topic of
interest of a professor at Amherst
who put together this exhibition
and asked my parents to loan the
paintings.
Well, I went to see the exhibi
tion, and I was bowled over to
sec the two portraits I had lived
with all my youth in a museum
setting. 1 really had something that
amounted to a conversion expe
rience. I realized that here I had
lived with pieccs of American art

all my life and didn't know a thing
about this country's art. 1 was be
coming an expert in the art of old
Europe.
Right then and there, I deter
mined that 1 would take a reading
course in American art. I had to
take a reading coursc because
there were no formal courses on
American art in the school in
which I was studying. That was
the fact the country over in the
mid-19605. The history of Ameri
can art simply wasn't taught.
1 did my reading coursc and
realized that there was 300 years'
worth of American art that had
very little work done on it. I was
fascinated by the stuff. At that
point, I determined that 1 would
be something of a pioneer and a
maverick in relation to my peers
and superiors, and would take on
a field where there really was no
advising.
So that is how I ended up in
American art. The reason why
that's the more interesting ques
tion is because American art didn't
really exist in the academy in the
mid-'6os. In fact, I'm the first his
torian of American art to have a
permanent position at Stanford.
Why did American art later
gain popularity as a field of ac
ademic study?
My story isn't that atypical be
cause there were several of my
generation who decided that
American art was undeservedly
cast aside as being provincial. One
always felt sorry for American art
ists. Their art lacked great aes
thetic import and it was thought
unworthy of study.

In the early 19605, when every
body was turning upside down the
ways they had thought about
things for a long time, a number
of people began to feel as it Amer
ican art had a lot to teach us
about the American experience
and about American history. Very
tentatively and without much
tutelage, they began to venture
into the field.
So one answer to your question
is that it was the times. People
were rethinking and reinventing
the way we interpret art. And one
of the ways we were reinventing
it was to think of art as important
as cultural documents, regardless
of whether or not it provided the
highest of aesthetic experiences.
I want to quickly add that a
lot of American art is aesthetically
beautiful, undiscovered perhaps at
that time. It is just that in the
'60s, it became more important to
think about the ways in which
visual artists digest and interpret
a culture. Regardless of whether
they are first or second rank, artists
have always had something to say
about the culture into which they
were born.
So the rise in popularity of
American art as a field of historical
study was partially a product of
that shift from aesthetics to cul
ture, from examining great mas
terpieces to viewing artists as
interpreters of culture.
What are some of the lessons
that you've learned from your
study of American art?
Let me redirect that. One of
the reasons I went into American
art was that it was fun to be
studying a subject that's not over
worked. I wasn't looking at Dante
and Shakespeare. I was looking at
artists like John Singleton Copley
and Grant Wood.
It's always intellectually chal
lenging to be the first or second
investigator rather than the 100 th.
It means you do a lot more spade
work, because you don't have that
much to rely on. There is a whole
generation of historians of Amer
ican art out there who have spent
their hours of research doing good
old-fashioned archival work, just
to get the basics out and into the
open. So that's one reason that it
was rewarding to study American
art.
Another reason, and I don't
want this to sound at all chauvinis
tic — because I've always denied
that there's chauvinism here — is
that in American art, you have a
pretty spectacular body of work.
There was some need then and 1
think still is today to validate and
redeem America's visual culture.

You want to belong to a culture
that didn't just have wars and
presidents and an occasional good
novelist.
You also wanted people to know
that this was a culture that had
produced jazz and Aaron Copland,
and some great portraitists and
landscapists and early modernists
— but without ever overrating
them. I've never thought that 1
am working on Picasso when I
work on Charles Demuth, hut I
find the questions Demuth's work
poses sufficiently complex and in
teresting.
What can students gain from
the study of art history that they
can't gain from other courses at
Stanford?
1 love the question!
I really believe in "visual
literacy." We are a culture that
puts incredible faith in the written
word and very little credence in
abstract or visual thinking. There's
a wo r d for this — we're
logocentric.
One thing 1 think students can
get from any of our art history
courses is a very elementary thing,
and that is how to look. For most
people a painting of an 18th
century man in a wig and formal
suit with his hand tucked into the
jacket is nothing more than a
stuffy old portrait.
Yet when I look at something
like that, 1 immediately begin to
ask about the class connotations
of the clothes he's wearing, what
his gesture means, why there is a
telescope on the table next to
him, or why he is looking to the
left. It raises a plethora of ques
tions for me that I think are as
important as the questions we
would ask if we were reading a
diary or a newspaper.
So what 1 call visual literacy is
the number one lesson that we
teach. Unless we learn the art of
seeing, we miss a great deal of
what our cultural commentators
of the past have said. Visual people
often give us data that we can't
get through other communica
tions.
What sort of data?
For instance, take the study of
mid-19th century American cul
ture, when every student reads
Emerson, Thoreau and Whitman,
and learns a great deal about the
way in which these various figures
looked at the world, particularly
in regards to Transcendentalism,
the oversoul and the oneness of
all things.
Now the artists of this period
had many of the same ideas and
translated them into landscape


Andrew
paintings. I would suggest that
these paintings really give the
viewer an emotional, transccnden
talist experience in ways Emerson
never could get through in words.
He could never get his reader high
on nature in the same way artists
did at the time.
So on one hand, I think you
often get in art a kind of gut level,
visceral experience that writers
don't always convey, because they
arc stuck with words and sen
tences. Words and sentences take
time to absorb and comprehend.
Pictures can be taken in all at
once and really move the spirit!
I even think you get new kinds
of information through the visual
arts. I don't mean they replace
verbal evidence, but they add to
it. Learning how to read paintings
and photographs enriches the way
you look at a particular cultural
moment.
Studying art also helps one un
derstand the degree to which we

all mediate the world we live in.
Nature, for instance, was a very
contrived element in mid-19th
century art. It was also in Emerson,
although we tend to think that
Emerson is talking about every
one's notion of a mountain range
or a bucolic country scene in New
England.
One of the things landscape
paintings help you see is that mid
19th century Americans had very
set notions of what made for a
pleasing experience in nature.
They weren't open to everything.
They were more interested in wil
derness than they were in domestic
gardens, for instance.
Now there is cultural meaning
in such choices and priorities.
When seen as a cultural text, art
can help you understand what a
figure like Emerson meant when
he used a loaded term like "na
ture."
On the one hand, Stanford in
general is lucky to have a strong
and frequent series of programs
pertaining to the visual arts. On
the other, in the student com
munity, the visual arts seem to
be fairly marginal. Can you com
ment on the marginality of the
study of art in the University?
From my perspective, with stu
dents filling our classes every quar
ter, it's hard to think of it quite
that way.
But we are one of the smaller
departments. We're also a depart
ment that is really two depart
ments within one. Half our
department teaches studio art and
half our department are historians
of art.

We're not only a small depart
ment, we're a young department
as well. Art has long been taught
here, but it hasn't had the depth
of faculty and the depth of cur
riculum it has now until relatively
recently.
But I agree with you. Art is not
central the way literature or his
tory or even the languages are.
That has partially to do with the
way we come to perceive the hu
manities very early on. Art plays
such a small role in our primary
and secondary schools.
It's too bad that many students
don't study art and become at
tuned to aesthetic experience
while at Stanford, especially
given that we're surrounded by
so much art in the form of public
sculpture.
What do you think students
think about the sculpture on
campus?

I get the sense that for most,
art is what's in a museum. When
you're in a museum, you know
there's art there. When you're
outside, the aesthetic experience
is somehow different than that
which is confined within the
museum space.
If you mean that students don't
take the sculpture seriously or look
at it very hard, that's too bad.
The sculpture on campus is of
very high quality. How do we
break through this?
A lot of people come to study
art after they have been shell
shocked into realizing how little
they know about it. That often
happens in Europe. There's noth
ing better for the study of art at
Stanford than the large number of
students who study abroad, where
their ignorance shows up and they
want to do something about it.
You said in a lecture a few
years ago that art will increas
ingly be brought more "to the
people." What did you mean by
that?
One of the things that has been
very obvious in the last 20 years
or so has been that art is no longer
confined to museums. Just the fact
that we have as much public sculp
ture on campus is evidence of art
moving outside museum walls and
into our everyday spaces. People
have to confront sculpture when
they walk across Stanford's
campus.
Since art for many people is a
scary experience, or not a common
experience, I like the fact that
sculpture has moved into spaces

that are not traditionally thought
of as showcases for art. Right now
we have a wonderful exhibition
in the art gallery about Christo's
art. Christo is one of the major
figures of our time who has de
termined that his art will be a
public art, made for and by the
people.
Part of his art is negotiating
with people and showing them
that something splendid, wonder
ful, transient and life-enhancing is
going to happen in their backyards
if they give permission for their
backyards to be stages for his work.
I think Christo's large-scale envi
ronmental pieces, like the "Run
ning Fence," have been ex
hilarating and very liberating. He
has showed others how to put art
into open public spaces.
Another kind of public art is
the revival in mural painting. We
have good examples of this at Casa
Zapata, where contemporary
murals decorate the walls of stair
wells and public rooms.

Are there any peculiar histor
ical circumstances that make it
difficult for art to be political?
I'm thinking particularly of the
invasion of the public space by
large corporate structures.
People within the art profes
sions today are constantly on
watch for ways in which corporate
support might infringe upon free
dom of expression. There's a great
sensitivity and worry amongst art
ists, art historians and museum
curators about the very strong and
obvious presence of corporate
funding for the arts.
1 think most artists would prob
ably argue that it doesn't affect
them directly in their making of
art. It may effect, however, the
way in which art is exhibited, the
way in which art is bought and
how artists' reputations are made.
Reputations arc made very often
by being represented in corporate
collections. Yet corporate collec
tions are not likely to be made
up of art that is against con
sumerism, art about gender in
equities or cultural imperialism.
That kind of art is hard on the
stomach and hard on the head
and not always easy to take in
and digest. Corporate collections
are often made up of casy-to-digest
works of art.
There is good reason to worry
and keep an eye out for ways in
which sources of money may skew
or interfere with the workings not
just of the mind but of the mar
ketplace.
In the next few months, you'll
hold two new administrative
posts. What do you hope to ac
complish in those capacities?
I'm going to become chair of
the Art Department this fall, but
I've also been asked to be acting
director of the Stanford museum
for next year. So I've got two
fronts to think about.
One of the things that I'm very
interested in doing is making sure
that the campus community
knows about us. Very often the
Art Department is seen as a

remote corner of campus over
there in the shadow of Hoover.
The museum is somewhere out
there in the meadows going
towards Palo Alto. I'm astounded
at how many students go through
Stanford without having even
stuck their noses in the museum.
One of the things that I'm
looking forward to doing is putting
out tentacles and hauling in un
suspecting students.
I would love to figure out ways
to have more student activities in
the museum, perhaps in the eve
ning, when students have freer
schedules. Perhaps there could be
moonlight walks through the
Rodin garden. I need some help
on this, actually. I'm going to put

munity knows

partment is seen

shadow of Hoover.

out a call for undergraduate ac
tivism on behalf of the museum
and arts.
I also would like to put together
a core of undergraduates who
would enjoy taking other under
graduates through the museum or
on tours of the public sculpture
and murals on campus. 1 think
students often listen to their peers
better than they listen to their
teachers or docents.
I'm also looking to try more
combined activities between
museum and department. We had
an example of this last spring. In
the museum, we had an exhibition
of caricatures drawn from our own
holdings. At the same time, the
department offered a course on
the history of caricature, and we
held an all-day public symposium

pronged event that brought to
gether both sides of the art

that.
Another thing we're going to
try to do is to give students ex
perience in creating and installing
exhibitions. We have graduate stu

their hands at being curators and
learn the museum ropes. This can
also apply to undergraduates.

it was to think of art as important
as cultural documents, regardless
of whether or not it provided the
highest of aesthetic experiences.
I want to quickly add that a
lot of American art is aesthetically
beautiful, undiscovered perhaps at
that time. It is just that in the
'60s, it became more important to
think about the ways in which
visual artists digest and interpret
a culture. Regardless of whether
they are first or second rank, artists
have always had something to say
about the culture into which they
were born.
So the rise in popularity of
American art as a field of historical
study was partially a product of
that shift from aesthetics to cul
ture, from examining great mas
terpieces to viewing artists as
interpreters of culture.
What are some of the lessons
that you've learned from your
study of American art?
Let me redirect that. One of
the reasons I went into American
art was that it was fun to be
studying a subject that's not over
worked. I wasn't looking at Dante
and Shakespeare. I was looking at
artists like John Singleton Copley
and Grant Wood.
It's always intellectually chal
lenging to be the first or second
investigator rather than the 100 th.
It means you do a lot more spade
work, because you don't have that
much to rely on. There is a whole
generation of historians of Amer
ican art out there who have spent
their hours of research doing good
old-fashioned archival work, just
to get the basics out and into the
open. So that's one reason that it
was rewarding to study American
art.
Another reason, and I don't
want this to sound at all chauvinis
tic — because I've always denied
that there's chauvinism here — is
that in American art, you have a
pretty spectacular body of work.
There was some need then and 1
think still is today to validate and
redeem America's visual culture.

You want to belong to a culture
that didn't just have wars and
presidents and an occasional good
novelist.
You also wanted people to know
that this was a culture that had
produced jazz and Aaron Copland,
and some great portraitists and
landscapists and early modernists
— but without ever overrating
them. I've never thought that 1
am working on Picasso when I
work on Charles Demuth, hut I
find the questions Demuth's work
poses sufficiently complex and in
teresting.
What can students gain from
the study of art history that they
can't gain from other courses at
Stanford?
1 love the question!
I really believe in "visual
literacy." We are a culture that
puts incredible faith in the written
word and very little credence in
abstract or visual thinking. There's
a wo r d for this — we're
logocentric.
One thing 1 think students can
get from any of our art history
courses is a very elementary thing,
and that is how to look. For most
people a painting of an 18th
century man in a wig and formal
suit with his hand tucked into the
jacket is nothing more than a
stuffy old portrait.
Yet when I look at something
like that, 1 immediately begin to
ask about the class connotations
of the clothes he's wearing, what
his gesture means, why there is a
telescope on the table next to
him, or why he is looking to the
left. It raises a plethora of ques
tions for me that I think are as
important as the questions we
would ask if we were reading a
diary or a newspaper.
So what 1 call visual literacy is
the number one lesson that we
teach. Unless we learn the art of
seeing, we miss a great deal of
what our cultural commentators
of the past have said. Visual people
often give us data that we can't
get through other communica
tions.
What sort of data?
For instance, take the study of
mid-19th century American cul
ture, when every student reads
Emerson, Thoreau and Whitman,
and learns a great deal about the
way in which these various figures
looked at the world, particularly
in regards to Transcendentalism,
the oversoul and the oneness of
all things.
Now the artists of this period
had many of the same ideas and
translated them into landscape


Andrew
paintings. I would suggest that
these paintings really give the
viewer an emotional, transccnden
talist experience in ways Emerson
never could get through in words.
He could never get his reader high
on nature in the same way artists
did at the time.
So on one hand, I think you
often get in art a kind of gut level,
visceral experience that writers
don't always convey, because they
arc stuck with words and sen
tences. Words and sentences take
time to absorb and comprehend.
Pictures can be taken in all at
once and really move the spirit!
I even think you get new kinds
of information through the visual
arts. I don't mean they replace
verbal evidence, but they add to
it. Learning how to read paintings
and photographs enriches the way
you look at a particular cultural
moment.
Studying art also helps one un
derstand the degree to which we

all mediate the world we live in.
Nature, for instance, was a very
contrived element in mid-19th
century art. It was also in Emerson,
although we tend to think that
Emerson is talking about every
one's notion of a mountain range
or a bucolic country scene in New
England.
One of the things landscape
paintings help you see is that mid
19th century Americans had very
set notions of what made for a
pleasing experience in nature.
They weren't open to everything.
They were more interested in wil
derness than they were in domestic
gardens, for instance.
Now there is cultural meaning
in such choices and priorities.
When seen as a cultural text, art
can help you understand what a
figure like Emerson meant when
he used a loaded term like "na
ture."
On the one hand, Stanford in
general is lucky to have a strong
and frequent series of programs
pertaining to the visual arts. On
the other, in the student com
munity, the visual arts seem to
be fairly marginal. Can you com
ment on the marginality of the
study of art in the University?
From my perspective, with stu
dents filling our classes every quar
ter, it's hard to think of it quite
that way.
But we are one of the smaller
departments. We're also a depart
ment that is really two depart
ments within one. Half our
department teaches studio art and
half our department are historians
of art.

We're not only a small depart
ment, we're a young department
as well. Art has long been taught
here, but it hasn't had the depth
of faculty and the depth of cur
riculum it has now until relatively
recently.
But I agree with you. Art is not
central the way literature or his
tory or even the languages are.
That has partially to do with the
way we come to perceive the hu
manities very early on. Art plays
such a small role in our primary
and secondary schools.
It's too bad that many students
don't study art and become at
tuned to aesthetic experience
while at Stanford, especially
given that we're surrounded by
so much art in the form of public
sculpture.
What do you think students
think about the sculpture on
campus?

I get the sense that for most,
art is what's in a museum. When
you're in a museum, you know
there's art there. When you're
outside, the aesthetic experience
is somehow different than that
which is confined within the
museum space.
If you mean that students don't
take the sculpture seriously or look
at it very hard, that's too bad.
The sculpture on campus is of
very high quality. How do we
break through this?
A lot of people come to study
art after they have been shell
shocked into realizing how little
they know about it. That often
happens in Europe. There's noth
ing better for the study of art at
Stanford than the large number of
students who study abroad, where
their ignorance shows up and they
want to do something about it.
You said in a lecture a few
years ago that art will increas
ingly be brought more "to the
people." What did you mean by
that?
One of the things that has been
very obvious in the last 20 years
or so has been that art is no longer
confined to museums. Just the fact
that we have as much public sculp
ture on campus is evidence of art
moving outside museum walls and
into our everyday spaces. People
have to confront sculpture when
they walk across Stanford's
campus.
Since art for many people is a
scary experience, or not a common
experience, I like the fact that
sculpture has moved into spaces

that are not traditionally thought
of as showcases for art. Right now
we have a wonderful exhibition
in the art gallery about Christo's
art. Christo is one of the major
figures of our time who has de
termined that his art will be a
public art, made for and by the
people.
Part of his art is negotiating
with people and showing them
that something splendid, wonder
ful, transient and life-enhancing is
going to happen in their backyards
if they give permission for their
backyards to be stages for his work.
I think Christo's large-scale envi
ronmental pieces, like the "Run
ning Fence," have been ex
hilarating and very liberating. He
has showed others how to put art
into open public spaces.
Another kind of public art is
the revival in mural painting. We
have good examples of this at Casa
Zapata, where contemporary
murals decorate the walls of stair
wells and public rooms.

Are there any peculiar histor
ical circumstances that make it
difficult for art to be political?
I'm thinking particularly of the
invasion of the public space by
large corporate structures.
People within the art profes
sions today are constantly on
watch for ways in which corporate
support might infringe upon free
dom of expression. There's a great
sensitivity and worry amongst art
ists, art historians and museum
curators about the very strong and
obvious presence of corporate
funding for the arts.
1 think most artists would prob
ably argue that it doesn't affect
them directly in their making of
art. It may effect, however, the
way in which art is exhibited, the
way in which art is bought and
how artists' reputations are made.
Reputations arc made very often
by being represented in corporate
collections. Yet corporate collec
tions are not likely to be made
up of art that is against con
sumerism, art about gender in
equities or cultural imperialism.
That kind of art is hard on the
stomach and hard on the head
and not always easy to take in
and digest. Corporate collections
are often made up of casy-to-digest
works of art.
There is good reason to worry
and keep an eye out for ways in
which sources of money may skew
or interfere with the workings not
just of the mind but of the mar
ketplace.
In the next few months, you'll
hold two new administrative
posts. What do you hope to ac
complish in those capacities?
I'm going to become chair of
the Art Department this fall, but
I've also been asked to be acting
director of the Stanford museum
for next year. So I've got two
fronts to think about.
One of the things that I'm very
interested in doing is making sure
that the campus community
knows about us. Very often the
Art Department is seen as a

remote corner of campus over
there in the shadow of Hoover.
The museum is somewhere out
there in the meadows going
towards Palo Alto. I'm astounded
at how many students go through
Stanford without having even
stuck their noses in the museum.
One of the things that I'm
looking forward to doing is putting
out tentacles and hauling in un
suspecting students.
I would love to figure out ways
to have more student activities in
the museum, perhaps in the eve
ning, when students have freer
schedules. Perhaps there could be
moonlight walks through the
Rodin garden. I need some help
on this, actually. I'm going to put

munity knows

partment is seen

shadow of Hoover.

out a call for undergraduate ac
tivism on behalf of the museum
and arts.
I also would like to put together
a core of undergraduates who
would enjoy taking other under
graduates through the museum or
on tours of the public sculpture
and murals on campus. 1 think
students often listen to their peers
better than they listen to their
teachers or docents.
I'm also looking to try more
combined activities between
museum and department. We had
an example of this last spring. In
the museum, we had an exhibition
of caricatures drawn from our own
holdings. At the same time, the
department offered a course on
the history of caricature, and we
held an all-day public symposium
on the topic. It was a three
pronged event that brought to
gether both sides of the art
program. I'd like to do more of
that.
Another thing we're going to
try to do is to give students ex
perience in creating and installing
exhibitions. We have graduate stu
dents here who are anxious to try
their hands at being curators and
learn the museum ropes. This can
also apply to undergraduates.
0.K., 1 have to ask, What do
you love so much about "Amer
ican Gothic?"
(Laughs) Oh, I love "American
Gothic" because it's always a
source of good interviews!
You collect all sorts of popular
culture permutations of the
painting . . .
That's right, I get at least one

good one every week. People send
them to me from all over the
country.
What first attracted you to the
painting?
Back in the early 1960s I
decided Grant Wood's "American
Gothic" was a painting that I had
to understand. I just had to crack
it. At the time, abstract art was
all the rage in New York City.
Grant Wood was the bad boy of
the 1930s who had dumped on
modernism and produced a kind
of down-home, folksy realism. I
just had to understand this paint
ing, which the art establishment
hated but the cartoonists loved.
Take-offs of "American Gothic"
were beginning to appear regularly
in popular culture.
I always thought that 1 was in
terested in the painting because
Grant Wood came from the Mid
west. My mother and father both
came from the Midwest. My grand
father was a farmer who looked
like that bean pole of a man in
the painting. Grandad wore bibbed
overalls, rimless glasses and was
balding. As a child, whenever I
saw that painting I thought it was
a version of my grandfather.
Added to that was the fact that
"American Gothic" was a naughty
painting for a serious intellectual
to think about. It was a naughty
painting to consider in the early
'60s because it was an anathema
to the art community. You weren't
supposed to look at realist art;
you certainly weren't supposed to
take regionalist art of the '30s
seriously. 1 was prompted to study
it because no one else was making
any effort to understand why the
painting had become such a
popular icon in today's culture.
And then, the more I thought
about it, the more I realized that
there was another dimension to
this project that I wasn't at all
conscious of at the time. In the
'60s many bccame very conscious
of their origins and ethnicity. Alex
Haley was doing his roots and I
now realize that I was doing mine.
I'm not a Midwestern kid, I'm
New England born and bred, but
I have a family that is very Mid
western in many of its habits of
mind and speech. The way my
mother lays out a table at Thanks
giving or Christmas is right out
of farm culture style. There were
things about my family that I came
to understand while doing research
on this painting. That thrilled me.
I had never thought of myself
as having come from traditions
other than suburban America. But
I now realize that my suburban
American experience was grafted
onto something that went deep
into the past and deep into an
other region of the country.
So now, when people ask me
what attracts me to that painting,
I say it has to do with family
heritage and roots and this crazy
thing we each call our American
ness. Something resonates in the
painting for me. It values that sort
of stubbornness and strong-willed
independence that I recognize in
myself, in my family and in my
past.
If you mention the name Wanda
Corn to art history students at
Stanford, you'll get a predictable
reaction.
Students' faces brighten, they
smile, and they begin to sing her
praises — even if they've never
taken one of her courses.
An associate professor of art
history at Stanford, Corn will be
come chair of the Art Department
and acting director of the Stanford
Museum this fall.
Corn received her Ph.D. from
the Institute of Fine Arts, New
York University in 1974. She has
been a Regents Fellow at the
Smithsonian Institution, a fellow
at the Woodrow Wilson Interna
tional Center for Scholars and a
Phi Beta Kappa Visiting Scholar.
A champion and early student
of American art, Corn has taught
"American Art and Culture in the
Gilded Age," "Paris and New
York: Transatlantic Exchange in
Early Modernism," "Culture in
Crisis: American Art in the
19305," "American Art after World
War II" and "Consumer Culture
and the Visual Arts."
How did you become an art his
torian?
Can I rephrase the question?
How did you become an histo
rian of American art is more in
teresting. I was always interested
in history, and somewhere in my
college years I discovered that
there was a whole new world in
visual experience that was just as
rich as verbal sources. I decided

I wanted to be an art historian,
and 1 was off and running.
At that time, however, to do
art history — at least in my mind
— meant that you studied the
European old masters. My first in
terests, in fact, were in medieval
art. I studied for two years abroad
and concentrated on medieval ar
chitecture. When I went to grad
uate school, I applied as a student
of medieval art.
In my second semester of grad
uate school, though, I had an un
usual experience. My father and
mother had two portraits hanging
on the dining room wall. My family
was not a collecting family. We
didn't have many paintings except
for some old ones that comple
mented the furnishings of our early
19th-century Connecticut valley
house.
But these two paintings were
suddenly invited to be in an ex
hibition. I was shocked, because I
never knew we had paintings that
were exhibition quality. I knew
they were unsigned paintings, but
I didn't know that they had been
identified to be those of an
itinerant American artist traveling
the Connecticut river valley —
Erastus Salisbury Field. Erastus
Salisbury Field was the topic of
interest of a professor at Amherst
who put together this exhibition
and asked my parents to loan the
paintings.
Well, I went to see the exhibi
tion, and I was bowled over to
sec the two portraits I had lived
with all my youth in a museum
setting. 1 really had something that
amounted to a conversion expe
rience. I realized that here I had
lived with pieccs of American art

all my life and didn't know a thing
about this country's art. 1 was be
coming an expert in the art of old
Europe.
Right then and there, I deter
mined that 1 would take a reading
course in American art. I had to
take a reading coursc because
there were no formal courses on
American art in the school in
which I was studying. That was
the fact the country over in the
mid-19605. The history of Ameri
can art simply wasn't taught.
1 did my reading coursc and
realized that there was 300 years'
worth of American art that had
very little work done on it. I was
fascinated by the stuff. At that
point, I determined that 1 would
be something of a pioneer and a
maverick in relation to my peers
and superiors, and would take on
a field where there really was no
advising.
So that is how I ended up in
American art. The reason why
that's the more interesting ques
tion is because American art didn't
really exist in the academy in the
mid-'6os. In fact, I'm the first his
torian of American art to have a
permanent position at Stanford.
Why did American art later
gain popularity as a field of ac
ademic study?
My story isn't that atypical be
cause there were several of my
generation who decided that
American art was undeservedly
cast aside as being provincial. One
always felt sorry for American art
ists. Their art lacked great aes
thetic import and it was thought
unworthy of study.

In the early 19605, when every
body was turning upside down the
ways they had thought about
things for a long time, a number
of people began to feel as it Amer
ican art had a lot to teach us
about the American experience
and about American history. Very
tentatively and without much
tutelage, they began to venture
into the field.
So one answer to your question
is that it was the times. People
were rethinking and reinventing
the way we interpret art. And one
of the ways we were reinventing
it was to think of art as important
as cultural documents, regardless
of whether or not it provided the
highest of aesthetic experiences.
I want to quickly add that a
lot of American art is aesthetically
beautiful, undiscovered perhaps at

that are not traditionally thought
of as showcases for art. Right now
we have a wonderful exhibition
in the art gallery about Christo's
art. Christo is one of the major
figures of our time who has de
termined that his art will be a
public art, made for and by the
people.
Part of his art is negotiating
with people and showing them
that something splendid, wonder
ful, transient and life-enhancing is
going to happen in their backyards
if they give permission for their
backyards to be stages for his work.
I think Christo's large-scale envi
ronmental pieces, like the "Run
ning Fence," have been ex
hilarating and very liberating. He
has showed others how to put art
into open public spaces.
Another kind of public art is
the revival in mural painting. We
have good examples of this at Casa
Zapata, where contemporary
murals decorate the walls of stair
wells and public rooms.

Are there any peculiar histor
ical circumstances that make it
difficult for art to be political?
I'm thinking particularly of the
invasion of the public space by
large corporate structures.
People within the art profes
sions today are constantly on
watch for ways in which corporate
support might infringe upon free
dom of expression. There's a great
sensitivity and worry amongst art
ists, art historians and museum
curators about the very strong and
obvious presence of corporate
funding for the arts.
1 think most artists would prob
ably argue that it doesn't affect
them directly in their making of
art. It may effect, however, the
way in which art is exhibited, the
way in which art is bought and
how artists' reputations are made.
Reputations arc made very often
by being represented in corporate
collections. Yet corporate collec
tions are not likely to be made
up of art that is against con
sumerism, art about gender in
equities or cultural imperialism.
That kind of art is hard on the
stomach and hard on the head
and not always easy to take in
and digest. Corporate collections
are often made up of casy-to-digest
works of art.
There is good reason to worry
and keep an eye out for ways in
which sources of money may skew
or interfere with the workings not
just of the mind but of the mar
ketplace.
In the next few months, you'll
hold two new administrative
posts. What do you hope to ac
complish in those capacities?
I'm going to become chair of
the Art Department this fall, but
I've also been asked to be acting
director of the Stanford museum
for next year. So I've got two
fronts to think about.
One of the things that I'm very
interested in doing is making sure
that the campus community
knows about us. Very often the
Art Department is seen as a

remote corner of campus over
there in the shadow of Hoover.
The museum is somewhere out
there in the meadows going
towards Palo Alto. I'm astounded
at how many students go through
Stanford without having even
stuck their noses in the museum.
One of the things that I'm
looking forward to doing is putting
out tentacles and hauling in un
suspecting students.
I would love to figure out ways
to have more student activities in
the museum, perhaps in the eve
ning, when students have freer
schedules. Perhaps there could be
moonlight walks through the
Rodin garden. I need some help
on this, actually. I'm going to put

out a call for undergraduate ac
tivism on behalf of the museum
and arts.
I also would like to put together
a core of undergraduates who
would enjoy taking other under
graduates through the museum or
on tours of the public sculpture
and murals on campus. 1 think
students often listen to their peers
better than they listen to their
teachers or docents.
I'm also looking to try more
combined activities between
museum and department. We had
an example of this last spring. In
the museum, we had an exhibition
of caricatures drawn from our own
holdings. At the same time, the
department offered a course on
the history of caricature, and we
held an all-day public symposium
on the topic. It was a three
pronged event that brought to
gether both sides of the art
program. I'd like to do more of
that.
Another thing we're going to
try to do is to give students ex
perience in creating and installing
exhibitions. We have graduate stu
dents here who are anxious to try
their hands at being curators and
learn the museum ropes. This can
also apply to undergraduates.
0.K., 1 have to ask, What do
you love so much about "Amer
ican Gothic?"
(Laughs) Oh, I love "American
Gothic" because it's always a
source of good interviews!
You collect all sorts of popular
culture permutations of the
painting . . .
That's right, I get at least one

good one every week. People send
them to me from all over the
country.
What first attracted you to the
painting?
Back in the early 1960s I
decided Grant Wood's "American
Gothic" was a painting that I had
to understand. I just had to crack
it. At the time, abstract art was
all the rage in New York City.
Grant Wood was the bad boy of
the 1930s who had dumped on
modernism and produced a kind
of down-home, folksy realism. I
just had to understand this paint
ing, which the art establishment
hated but the cartoonists loved.
Take-offs of "American Gothic"
were beginning to appear regularly
in popular culture.
I always thought that 1 was in
terested in the painting because
Grant Wood came from the Mid
west. My mother and father both
came from the Midwest. My grand
father was a farmer who looked
like that bean pole of a man in
the painting. Grandad wore bibbed
overalls, rimless glasses and was
balding. As a child, whenever I
saw that painting I thought it was
a version of my grandfather.
Added to that was the fact that
"American Gothic" was a naughty
painting for a serious intellectual
to think about. It was a naughty
painting to consider in the early
'60s because it was an anathema
to the art community. You weren't
supposed to look at realist art;
you certainly weren't supposed to
take regionalist art of the '30s
seriously. 1 was prompted to study
it because no one else was making
any effort to understand why the
painting had become such a
popular icon in today's culture.
And then, the more I thought
about it, the more I realized that
there was another dimension to
this project that I wasn't at all
conscious of at the time. In the
'60s many bccame very conscious
of their origins and ethnicity. Alex
Haley was doing his roots and I
now realize that I was doing mine.
I'm not a Midwestern kid, I'm
New England born and bred, but
I have a family that is very Mid
western in many of its habits of
mind and speech. The way my
mother lays out a table at Thanks
giving or Christmas is right out
of farm culture style. There were
things about my family that I came
to understand while doing research
on this painting. That thrilled me.
I had never thought of myself
as having come from traditions
other than suburban America. But
I now realize that my suburban
American experience was grafted
onto something that went deep
into the past and deep into an
other region of the country.
So now, when people ask me
what attracts me to that painting,
I say it has to do with family
heritage and roots and this crazy
thing we each call our American
ness. Something resonates in the
painting for me. It values that sort
of stubbornness and strong-willed
independence that I recognize in
myself, in my family and in my
past.
If you mention the name Wanda
Corn to art history students at
Stanford, you'll get a predictable
reaction.
Students' faces brighten, they
smile, and they begin to sing her
praises — even if they've never
taken one of her courses.
An associate professor of art
history at Stanford, Corn will be
come chair of the Art Department
and acting director of the Stanford
Museum this fall.
Corn received her Ph.D. from
the Institute of Fine Arts, New
York University in 1974. She has
been a Regents Fellow at the
Smithsonian Institution, a fellow
at the Woodrow Wilson Interna
tional Center for Scholars and a
Phi Beta Kappa Visiting Scholar.
A champion and early student
of American art, Corn has taught
"American Art and Culture in the
Gilded Age," "Paris and New
York: Transatlantic Exchange in
Early Modernism," "Culture in
Crisis: American Art in the
19305," "American Art after World
War II" and "Consumer Culture
and the Visual Arts."
How did you become an art his
torian?
Can I rephrase the question?
How did you become an histo
rian of American art is more in
teresting. I was always interested
in history, and somewhere in my
college years I discovered that
there was a whole new world in
visual experience that was just as
rich as verbal sources. I decided

I wanted to be an art historian,
and 1 was off and running.
At that time, however, to do
art history — at least in my mind
— meant that you studied the
European old masters. My first in
terests, in fact, were in medieval
art. I studied for two years abroad
and concentrated on medieval ar
chitecture. When I went to grad
uate school, I applied as a student
of medieval art.
In my second semester of grad
uate school, though, I had an un
usual experience. My father and
mother had two portraits hanging
on the dining room wall. My family
was not a collecting family. We
didn't have many paintings except
for some old ones that comple
mented the furnishings of our early
19th-century Connecticut valley
house.
But these two paintings were
suddenly invited to be in an ex
hibition. I was shocked, because I
never knew we had paintings that
were exhibition quality. I knew
they were unsigned paintings, but
I didn't know that they had been
identified to be those of an
itinerant American artist traveling
the Connecticut river valley —
Erastus Salisbury Field. Erastus
Salisbury Field was the topic of
interest of a professor at Amherst
who put together this exhibition
and asked my parents to loan the
paintings.
Well, I went to see the exhibi
tion, and I was bowled over to
sec the two portraits I had lived
with all my youth in a museum
setting. 1 really had something that
amounted to a conversion expe
rience. I realized that here I had
lived with pieccs of American art

all my life and didn't know a thing
about this country's art. 1 was be
coming an expert in the art of old
Europe.
Right then and there, I deter
mined that 1 would take a reading
course in American art. I had to
take a reading coursc because
there were no formal courses on
American art in the school in
which I was studying. That was
the fact the country over in the
mid-19605. The history of Ameri
can art simply wasn't taught.
1 did my reading coursc and
realized that there was 300 years'
worth of American art that had
very little work done on it. I was
fascinated by the stuff. At that
point, I determined that 1 would
be something of a pioneer and a
maverick in relation to my peers
and superiors, and would take on
a field where there really was no
advising.
So that is how I ended up in
American art. The reason why
that's the more interesting ques
tion is because American art didn't
really exist in the academy in the
mid-'6os. In fact, I'm the first his
torian of American art to have a
permanent position at Stanford.
Why did American art later
gain popularity as a field of ac
ademic study?
My story isn't that atypical be
cause there were several of my
generation who decided that
American art was undeservedly
cast aside as being provincial. One
always felt sorry for American art
ists. Their art lacked great aes
thetic import and it was thought
unworthy of study.

In the early 19605, when every
body was turning upside down the
ways they had thought about
things for a long time, a number
of people began to feel as it Amer
ican art had a lot to teach us
about the American experience
and about American history. Very
tentatively and without much
tutelage, they began to venture
into the field.
So one answer to your question
is that it was the times. People
were rethinking and reinventing
the way we interpret art. And one
of the ways we were reinventing
it was to think of art as important
as cultural documents, regardless
of whether or not it provided the
highest of aesthetic experiences.
I want to quickly add that a
lot of American art is aesthetically
beautiful, undiscovered perhaps at
that time. It is just that in the
'60s, it became more important to
think about the ways in which
visual artists digest and interpret
a culture. Regardless of whether
they are first or second rank, artists
have always had something to say
about the culture into which they
were born.
So the rise in popularity of
American art as a field of historical
study was partially a product of
that shift from aesthetics to cul
ture, from examining great mas
terpieces to viewing artists as
interpreters of culture.
What are some of the lessons
that you've learned from your
study of American art?
Let me redirect that. One of
the reasons I went into American
art was that it was fun to be
studying a subject that's not over
worked. I wasn't looking at Dante
and Shakespeare. I was looking at
artists like John Singleton Copley
and Grant Wood.
It's always intellectually chal
lenging to be the first or second
investigator rather than the 100 th.
It means you do a lot more spade
work, because you don't have that
much to rely on. There is a whole
generation of historians of Amer
ican art out there who have spent
their hours of research doing good
old-fashioned archival work, just
to get the basics out and into the
open. So that's one reason that it
was rewarding to study American
art.
Another reason, and I don't
want this to sound at all chauvinis
tic — because I've always denied
that there's chauvinism here — is
that in American art, you have a
pretty spectacular body of work.
There was some need then and 1
think still is today to validate and
redeem America's visual culture.

You want to belong to a culture
that didn't just have wars and
presidents and an occasional good
novelist.
You also wanted people to know
that this was a culture that had
produced jazz and Aaron Copland,
and some great portraitists and
landscapists and early modernists
— but without ever overrating
them. I've never thought that 1
am working on Picasso when I
work on Charles Demuth, hut I
find the questions Demuth's work
poses sufficiently complex and in
teresting.
What can students gain from
the study of art history that they
can't gain from other courses at
Stanford?
1 love the question!
I really believe in "visual
literacy." We are a culture that
puts incredible faith in the written
word and very little credence in
abstract or visual thinking. There's
a wo r d for this — we're
logocentric.
One thing 1 think students can
get from any of our art history
courses is a very elementary thing,
and that is how to look. For most
people a painting of an 18th
century man in a wig and formal
suit with his hand tucked into the
jacket is nothing more than a
stuffy old portrait.
Yet when I look at something
like that, 1 immediately begin to
ask about the class connotations
of the clothes he's wearing, what
his gesture means, why there is a
telescope on the table next to
him, or why he is looking to the
left. It raises a plethora of ques
tions for me that I think are as
important as the questions we
would ask if we were reading a
diary or a newspaper.
So what 1 call visual literacy is
the number one lesson that we
teach. Unless we learn the art of
seeing, we miss a great deal of
what our cultural commentators
of the past have said. Visual people
often give us data that we can't
get through other communica
tions.
What sort of data?
For instance, take the study of
mid-19th century American cul
ture, when every student reads
Emerson, Thoreau and Whitman,
and learns a great deal about the
way in which these various figures
looked at the world, particularly
in regards to Transcendentalism,
the oversoul and the oneness of
all things.
Now the artists of this period
had many of the same ideas and
translated them into landscape


Andrew
paintings. I would suggest that
these paintings really give the
viewer an emotional, transccnden
talist experience in ways Emerson
never could get through in words.
He could never get his reader high
on nature in the same way artists
did at the time.
So on one hand, I think you
often get in art a kind of gut level,
visceral experience that writers
don't always convey, because they
arc stuck with words and sen
tences. Words and sentences take
time to absorb and comprehend.
Pictures can be taken in all at
once and really move the spirit!
I even think you get new kinds
of information through the visual
arts. I don't mean they replace
verbal evidence, but they add to
it. Learning how to read paintings
and photographs enriches the way
you look at a particular cultural
moment.
Studying art also helps one un
derstand the degree to which we

all mediate the world we live in.
Nature, for instance, was a very
contrived element in mid-19th
century art. It was also in Emerson,
although we tend to think that
Emerson is talking about every
one's notion of a mountain range
or a bucolic country scene in New
England.
One of the things landscape
paintings help you see is that mid
19th century Americans had very
set notions of what made for a
pleasing experience in nature.
They weren't open to everything.
They were more interested in wil
derness than they were in domestic
gardens, for instance.
Now there is cultural meaning
in such choices and priorities.
When seen as a cultural text, art
can help you understand what a
figure like Emerson meant when
he used a loaded term like "na
ture."
On the one hand, Stanford in
general is lucky to have a strong
and frequent series of programs
pertaining to the visual arts. On
the other, in the student com
munity, the visual arts seem to
be fairly marginal. Can you com
ment on the marginality of the
study of art in the University?
From my perspective, with stu
dents filling our classes every quar
ter, it's hard to think of it quite
that way.
But we are one of the smaller
departments. We're also a depart
ment that is really two depart
ments within one. Half our
department teaches studio art and
half our department are historians
of art.

We're not only a small depart
ment, we're a young department
as well. Art has long been taught
here, but it hasn't had the depth
of faculty and the depth of cur
riculum it has now until relatively
recently.
But I agree with you. Art is not
central the way literature or his
tory or even the languages are.
That has partially to do with the
way we come to perceive the hu
manities very early on. Art plays
such a small role in our primary
and secondary schools.
It's too bad that many students
don't study art and become at
tuned to aesthetic experience
while at Stanford, especially
given that we're surrounded by
so much art in the form of public
sculpture.
What do you think students
think about the sculpture on
campus?

I get the sense that for most,
art is what's in a museum. When
you're in a museum, you know
there's art there. When you're
outside, the aesthetic experience
is somehow different than that
which is confined within the
museum space.
If you mean that students don't
take the sculpture seriously or look
at it very hard, that's too bad.
The sculpture on campus is of
very high quality. How do we
break through this?
A lot of people come to study
art after they have been shell
shocked into realizing how little
they know about it. That often
happens in Europe. There's noth
ing better for the study of art at
Stanford than the large number of
students who study abroad, where
their ignorance shows up and they
want to do something about it.
You said in a lecture a few
years ago that art will increas
ingly be brought more "to the
people." What did you mean by
that?
One of the things that has been
very obvious in the last 20 years
or so has been that art is no longer
confined to museums. Just the fact
that we have as much public sculp
ture on campus is evidence of art
moving outside museum walls and
into our everyday spaces. People
have to confront sculpture when
they walk across Stanford's
campus.
Since art for many people is a
scary experience, or not a common
experience, I like the fact that
sculpture has moved into spaces

that are not traditionally thought
of as showcases for art. Right now
we have a wonderful exhibition
in the art gallery about Christo's
art. Christo is one of the major
figures of our time who has de
termined that his art will be a
public art, made for and by the
people.
Part of his art is negotiating
with people and showing them
that something splendid, wonder
ful, transient and life-enhancing is
going to happen in their backyards
if they give permission for their
backyards to be stages for his work.
I think Christo's large-scale envi
ronmental pieces, like the "Run
ning Fence," have been ex
hilarating and very liberating. He
has showed others how to put art
into open public spaces.
Another kind of public art is
the revival in mural painting. We
have good examples of this at Casa
Zapata, where contemporary
murals decorate the walls of stair
wells and public rooms.

Are there any peculiar histor
ical circumstances that make it
difficult for art to be political?
I'm thinking particularly of the
invasion of the public space by
large corporate structures.

How did you become an art his
torian?
Can I rephrase the question?
How did you become an histo
rian of American art is more in
teresting. I was always interested
in history, and somewhere in my
college years I discovered that
there was a whole new world in
visual experience that was just as
rich as verbal sources. I decided

I wanted to be an art historian,
and 1 was off and running.
At that time, however, to do
art history — at least in my mind
— meant that you studied the
European old masters. My first in
terests, in fact, were in medieval
art. I studied for two years abroad
and concentrated on medieval ar
chitecture. When I went to grad
uate school, I applied as a student
of medieval art.
In my second semester of grad
uate school, though, I had an un
usual experience. My father and
mother had two portraits hanging
on the dining room wall. My family
was not a collecting family. We
didn't have many paintings except
for some old ones that comple
mented the furnishings of our early
19th-century Connecticut valley
house.
But these two paintings were
suddenly invited to be in an ex
hibition. I was shocked, because I
never knew we had paintings that
were exhibition quality. I knew
they were unsigned paintings, but
I didn't know that they had been
identified to be those of an
itinerant American artist traveling
the Connecticut river valley —
Erastus Salisbury Field. Erastus
Salisbury Field was the topic of
interest of a professor at Amherst
who put together this exhibition
and asked my parents to loan the
paintings.
Well, I went to see the exhibi
tion, and I was bowled over to
sec the two portraits I had lived
with all my youth in a museum
setting. 1 really had something that
amounted to a conversion expe
rience. I realized that here I had
lived with pieccs of American art

all my life and didn't know a thing
about this country's art. 1 was be
coming an expert in the art of old
Europe.
Right then and there, I deter
mined that 1 would take a reading
course in American art. I had to
take a reading coursc because
there were no formal courses on
American art in the school in
which I was studying. That was
the fact the country over in the
mid-19605. The history of Ameri
can art simply wasn't taught.
1 did my reading coursc and
realized that there was 300 years'
worth of American art that had
very little work done on it. I was
fascinated by the stuff. At that
point, I determined that 1 would
be something of a pioneer and a
maverick in relation to my peers
and superiors, and would take on
a field where there really was no
advising.
So that is how I ended up in
American art. The reason why
that's the more interesting ques
tion is because American art didn't
really exist in the academy in the
mid-'6os. In fact, I'm the first his
torian of American art to have a
permanent position at Stanford.
Why did American art later
gain popularity as a field of ac
ademic study?
My story isn't that atypical be
cause there were several of my
generation who decided that
American art was undeservedly
cast aside as being provincial. One
always felt sorry for American art
ists. Their art lacked great aes
thetic import and it was thought
unworthy of study.

In the early 19605, when every
body was turning upside down the
ways they had thought about
things for a long time, a number
of people began to feel as it Amer
ican art had a lot to teach us
about the American experience
and about American history. Very
tentatively and without much
tutelage, they began to venture
into the field.
So one answer to your question
is that it was the times. People
were rethinking and reinventing
the way we interpret art. And one
of the ways we were reinventing
it was to think of art as important
as cultural documents, regardless
of whether or not it provided the
highest of aesthetic experiences.
I want to quickly add that a
lot of American art is aesthetically
beautiful, undiscovered perhaps at
that time. It is just that in the
'60s, it became more important to
think about the ways in which
visual artists digest and interpret
a culture. Regardless of whether
they are first or second rank, artists
have always had something to say
about the culture into which they
were born.
So the rise in popularity of
American art as a field of historical
study was partially a product of
that shift from aesthetics to cul
ture, from examining great mas
terpieces to viewing artists as
interpreters of culture.
What are some of the lessons
that you've learned from your
study of American art?
Let me redirect that. One of
the reasons I went into American
art was that it was fun to be
studying a subject that's not over
worked. I wasn't looking at Dante
and Shakespeare. I was looking at
artists like John Singleton Copley
and Grant Wood.
It's always intellectually chal
lenging to be the first or second
investigator rather than the 100 th.
It means you do a lot more spade
work, because you don't have that
much to rely on. There is a whole
generation of historians of Amer
ican art out there who have spent
their hours of research doing good
old-fashioned archival work, just
to get the basics out and into the
open. So that's one reason that it
was rewarding to study American
art.
Another reason, and I don't
want this to sound at all chauvinis
tic — because I've always denied
that there's chauvinism here — is
that in American art, you have a
pretty spectacular body of work.
There was some need then and 1
think still is today to validate and
redeem America's visual culture.

You want to belong to a culture
that didn't just have wars and
presidents and an occasional good
novelist.
You also wanted people to know
that this was a culture that had
produced jazz and Aaron Copland,
and some great portraitists and
landscapists and early modernists
— but without ever overrating
them. I've never thought that 1
am working on Picasso when I
work on Charles Demuth, hut I
find the questions Demuth's work
poses sufficiently complex and in
teresting.
What can students gain from
the study of art history that they
can't gain from other courses at
Stanford?
1 love the question!
I really believe in "visual
literacy." We are a culture that
puts incredible faith in the written
word and very little credence in
abstract or visual thinking. There's
a wo r d for this — we're
logocentric.
One thing 1 think students can
get from any of our art history
courses is a very elementary thing,
and that is how to look. For most
people a painting of an 18th
century man in a wig and formal
suit with his hand tucked into the
jacket is nothing more than a
stuffy old portrait.
Yet when I look at something
like that, 1 immediately begin to
ask about the class connotations
of the clothes he's wearing, what
his gesture means, why there is a
telescope on the table next to
him, or why he is looking to the
left. It raises a plethora of ques
tions for me that I think are as
important as the questions we
would ask if we were reading a
diary or a newspaper.
So what 1 call visual literacy is
the number one lesson that we
teach. Unless we learn the art of
seeing, we miss a great deal of
what our cultural commentators
of the past have said. Visual people
often give us data that we can't
get through other communica
tions.
What sort of data?
For instance, take the study of
mid-19th century American cul
ture, when every student reads
Emerson, Thoreau and Whitman,
and learns a great deal about the
way in which these various figures
looked at the world, particularly
in regards to Transcendentalism,
the oversoul and the oneness of
all things.
Now the artists of this period
had many of the same ideas and
translated them into landscape


Andrew
paintings. I would suggest that
these paintings really give the
viewer an emotional, transccnden
talist experience in ways Emerson
never could get through in words.
He could never get his reader high
on nature in the same way artists
did at the time.
So on one hand, I think you
often get in art a kind of gut level,
visceral experience that writers
don't always convey, because they
arc stuck with words and sen
tences. Words and sentences take
time to absorb and comprehend.
Pictures can be taken in all at
once and really move the spirit!
I even think you get new kinds
of information through the visual
arts. I don't mean they replace
verbal evidence, but they add to
it. Learning how to read paintings
and photographs enriches the way
you look at a particular cultural
moment.
Studying art also helps one un
derstand the degree to which we

all mediate the world we live in.
Nature, for instance, was a very
contrived element in mid-19th
century art. It was also in Emerson,
although we tend to think that
Emerson is talking about every
one's notion of a mountain range
or a bucolic country scene in New
England.
One of the things landscape
paintings help you see is that mid
19th century Americans had very
set notions of what made for a
pleasing experience in nature.
They weren't open to everything.
They were more interested in wil
derness than they were in domestic
gardens, for instance.
Now there is cultural meaning
in such choices and priorities.
When seen as a cultural text, art
can help you understand what a
figure like Emerson meant when
he used a loaded term like "na
ture."
On the one hand, Stanford in
general is lucky to have a strong
and frequent series of programs
pertaining to the visual arts. On
the other, in the student com
munity, the visual arts seem to
be fairly marginal. Can you com
ment on the marginality of the
study of art in the University?
From my perspective, with stu
dents filling our classes every quar
ter, it's hard to think of it quite
that way.
But we are one of the smaller
departments. We're also a depart
ment that is really two depart
ments within one. Half our
department teaches studio art and
half our department are historians
of art.

We're not only a small depart
ment, we're a young department
as well. Art has long been taught
here, but it hasn't had the depth
of faculty and the depth of cur
riculum it has now until relatively
recently.
But I agree with you. Art is not
central the way literature or his
tory or even the languages are.
That has partially to do with the
way we come to perceive the hu
manities very early on. Art plays
such a small role in our primary
and secondary schools.
It's too bad that many students
don't study art and become at
tuned to aesthetic experience
while at Stanford, especially
given that we're surrounded by
so much art in the form of public
sculpture.
What do you think students
think about the sculpture on
campus?

I get the sense that for most,
art is what's in a museum. When
you're in a museum, you know
there's art there. When you're
outside, the aesthetic experience
is somehow different than that
which is confined within the
museum space.
If you mean that students don't
take the sculpture seriously or look
at it very hard, that's too bad.
The sculpture on campus is of
very high quality. How do we
break through this?
A lot of people come to study
art after they have been shell
shocked into realizing how little
they know about it. That often
happens in Europe. There's noth
ing better for the study of art at
Stanford than the large number of
students who study abroad, where
their ignorance shows up and they
want to do something about it.
You said in a lecture a few
years ago that art will increas
ingly be brought more "to the
people." What did you mean by
that?
One of the things that has been
very obvious in the last 20 years
or so has been that art is no longer
confined to museums. Just the fact
that we have as much public sculp
ture on campus is evidence of art
moving outside museum walls and
into our everyday spaces. People
have to confront sculpture when
they walk across Stanford's
campus.
Since art for many people is a
scary experience, or not a common
experience, I like the fact that
sculpture has moved into spaces

that are not traditionally thought
of as showcases for art. Right now
we have a wonderful exhibition
in the art gallery about Christo's
art. Christo is one of the major
figures of our time who has de
termined that his art will be a
public art, made for and by the
people.
Part of his art is negotiating
with people and showing them
that something splendid, wonder
ful, transient and life-enhancing is
going to happen in their backyards
if they give permission for their
backyards to be stages for his work.
I think Christo's large-scale envi
ronmental pieces, like the "Run
ning Fence," have been ex
hilarating and very liberating. He
has showed others how to put art
into open public spaces.
Another kind of public art is
the revival in mural painting. We
have good examples of this at Casa
Zapata, where contemporary
murals decorate the walls of stair
wells and public rooms.

Are there any peculiar histor
ical circumstances that make it
difficult for art to be political?
I'm thinking particularly of the
invasion of the public space by
large corporate structures.
People within the art profes
sions today are constantly on
watch for ways in which corporate
support might infringe upon free
dom of expression. There's a great
sensitivity and worry amongst art
ists, art historians and museum
curators about the very strong and
obvious presence of corporate
funding for the arts.
1 think most artists would prob
ably argue that it doesn't affect
them directly in their making of
art. It may effect, however, the
way in which art is exhibited, the
way in which art is bought and
how artists' reputations are made.
Reputations arc made very often
by being represented in corporate
collections. Yet corporate collec
tions are not likely to be made
up of art that is against con
sumerism, art about gender in
equities or cultural imperialism.
That kind of art is hard on the
stomach and hard on the head
and not always easy to take in
and digest. Corporate collections
are often made up of casy-to-digest
works of art.
There is good reason to worry
and keep an eye out for ways in
which sources of money may skew
or interfere with the workings not
just of the mind but of the mar
ketplace.
In the next few months, you'll
hold two new administrative
posts. What do you hope to ac
complish in those capacities?
I'm going to become chair of
the Art Department this fall, but
I've also been asked to be acting
director of the Stanford museum
for next year. So I've got two
fronts to think about.
One of the things that I'm very
interested in doing is making sure
that the campus community
knows about us. Very often the
Art Department is seen as a

remote corner of campus over
there in the shadow of Hoover.
The museum is somewhere out
there in the meadows going
towards Palo Alto. I'm astounded
at how many students go through
Stanford without having even
stuck their noses in the museum.
One of the things that I'm
looking forward to doing is putting
out tentacles and hauling in un
suspecting students.
I would love to figure out ways
to have more student activities in
the museum, perhaps in the eve
ning, when students have freer
schedules. Perhaps there could be
moonlight walks through the
Rodin garden. I need some help
on this, actually. I'm going to put

munity knows

partment is seen

out a call for undergraduate ac
tivism on behalf of the museum
and arts.
I also would like to put together
a core of undergraduates who
would enjoy taking other under
graduates through the museum or
on tours of the public sculpture
and murals on campus. 1 think
students often listen to their peers
better than they listen to their
teachers or docents.
I'm also looking to try more
combined activities between
museum and department. We had
an example of this last spring. In
the museum, we had an exhibition
of caricatures drawn from our own
holdings. At the same time, the
department offered a course on
the history of caricature, and we
held an all-day public symposium
on the topic. It was a three
pronged event that brought to
gether both sides of the art
program. I'd like to do more of
that.
Another thing we're going to
try to do is to give students ex
perience in creating and installing
exhibitions. We have graduate stu
dents here who are anxious to try
their hands at being curators and
learn the museum ropes. This can
also apply to undergraduates.
0.K., 1 have to ask, What do
you love so much about "Amer
ican Gothic?"
(Laughs) Oh, I love "American
Gothic" because it's always a
source of good interviews!
You collect all sorts of popular
culture permutations of the
painting . . .
That's right, I get at least one

good one every week. People send
them to me from all over the
country.
What first attracted you to the
painting?
Back in the early 1960s I
decided Grant Wood's "American
Gothic" was a painting that I had
to understand. I just had to crack
it. At the time, abstract art was
all the rage in New York City.
Grant Wood was the bad boy of
the 1930s who had dumped on
modernism and produced a kind
of down-home, folksy realism. I
just had to understand this paint
ing, which the art establishment
hated but the cartoonists loved.
Take-offs of "American Gothic"
were beginning to appear regularly
in popular culture.
I always thought that 1 was in
terested in the painting because
Grant Wood came from the Mid
west. My mother and father both
came from the Midwest. My grand
father was a farmer who looked
like that bean pole of a man in
the painting. Grandad wore bibbed
overalls, rimless glasses and was
balding. As a child, whenever I
saw that painting I thought it was
a version of my grandfather.
Added to that was the fact that
"American Gothic" was a naughty
painting for a serious intellectual
to think about. It was a naughty
painting to consider in the early
'60s because it was an anathema
to the art community. You weren't
supposed to look at realist art;
you certainly weren't supposed to
take regionalist art of the '30s
seriously. 1 was prompted to study
it because no one else was making
any effort to understand why the
painting had become such a
popular icon in today's culture.
And then, the more I thought
about it, the more I realized that
there was another dimension to
this project that I wasn't at all
conscious of at the time. In the
'60s many bccame very conscious
of their origins and ethnicity. Alex
Haley was doing his roots and I
now realize that I was doing mine.
I'm not a Midwestern kid, I'm
New England born and bred, but
I have a family that is very Mid
western in many of its habits of
mind and speech. The way my
mother lays out a table at Thanks
giving or Christmas is right out
of farm culture style. There were
things about my family that I came
to understand while doing research
on this painting. That thrilled me.
I had never thought of myself
as having come from traditions
other than suburban America. But
I now realize that my suburban
American experience was grafted
onto something that went deep
into the past and deep into an
other region of the country.
So now, when people ask me
what attracts me to that painting,
I say it has to do with family
heritage and roots and this crazy
thing we each call our American
ness. Something resonates in the
painting for me. It values that sort
of stubbornness and strong-willed
independence that I recognize in
myself, in my family and in my
past.
