## Spinning star enables scientists to see the light 
### Mark Davies 
On January 18, 1989, American scientists
working in Chile made a fantastic discovery.
Until that time, physicists had only
theorized that the remains of a supernova
took the form of a pulsar. That day, they
confirmed their theories.
Examining the closest supernova to the
Earth in almost 400 years, these scientists
found an exciting and invaluable testing
ground for both modern and classical
theories of astrophysics.
According to Dr. Robert Wagoner, Assoc.
Prof, of Physics at Stanford, the pulsar the
scientists discovered will afford astro
physicists an opportunity to evaluate matter
at densities higher than can be achieved
on earth.
In addition, says Wagoner, it will provide
a first look at the behavior of gravitational
radiation, a form of energy that has received
theoretical attention for years.
Supernovas, the brilliant explosions of
massive stars, are rare events in the universe.
Supernova 1987 A, responsible for the
formation of this particular pulsar, was first
observed on February 23, 1987 in Australia.
It was the first supernova near enough to
Earth to allow precise scientific measure
ments, giving scientists a ring-side seat to
observe the pulsar's formation.
A pulsar is a rapidly rotating, magnetized
neutron star that produces radiation in a
sweeping beam-like pattern — similar to a
lighthouse.
Spinning at an astonishing rate of 1968

times per sccond (making it the fastest
rotating object ever discovered), the pulsar's
surface is moving at least one-third the
speed of light. Incredible gravitational forccs
must be present to keep it from flying apart.
The pulsar's diameter, however, is only
a few miles in length. In order for something
so small to possess such a large gravitational
field, it must be incredibly dense. When
numbers are calculated, the average density
of the pulsar is equivalent to six times the
density of an atom's nucleus.
To put this figure in perspective, one
tablespoon of this pulsar's matter would
weigh thousands of tons on earth.
Wagoner theorizes that pulsars are pos
sibly instable to gravitational radiation. He
believes that since such a rapidly spinning
object becomes "ripply" on its surfacc, it
will lose energy through the emission of
gravitational waves.
This gravitational radiation has been cal
culated to be of an intensity just below
that which is discernable with existing
detectors, the most sensitive of which is at
Stanford. Therefore, the only method of
proving that this pulsar is emitting gravita
tional radiation is an indirect one.
Wagoner has predicted that the pulsar
will slow down due to the loss of energy
that is given off in the form of gravitational
radiation. If, when the pulsar is seen again,
it is spinning more slowly, the indirect
evidence needed to show that the pulsar
is indeed emitting gravitational radiation
will have been found.
The only problem that remains is seeing

the pulsar again. It has only been seen once
for a period of a few hours. This does have
scientists worried, admits Wagoner.
However, there is a feasable explanation
for its brief appearance. Since neutron stars
form after a supernova, Supernova 1987 A
was monitored once a month specifically
for radiation due to a pulsar. Scientists
expected to wait many months, it not years,
before the pulsar's signal would make it
through the dense cloud of debris left over
from when the star first exploded.
Roughly two years after Supernova 1987 A

was first seen, the pulsar's radiation was
briefly detected and then could not be
found again. According to Wagoner, there
is evidence that the expanding matter
around the pulsar is clumpy. It could be
hiding behind a cloud of debris that could
block further signals.
Scientists, including Wagoner, are just
going to have to wait until the pulsar is
observed again to see if it will support or
negate their theories concerning gravita
tional radiation.
