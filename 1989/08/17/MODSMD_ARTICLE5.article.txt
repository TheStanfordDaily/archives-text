## Shockley, inventor of the transistor, dies 
### 
William Shockley, a co-inventor of the
transistor and a professor emeritus of elec
trical engineering here, died Saturday of
prostatic cancer at his campus residence.
He was 79.
Despite sharing the 1956 Nobel Prize for
physics with John Bardeen and the late
Walter Brattain, Shockley may be better
remembered for his views on race and in
telligence.
The later part of his life was spent work
ing on his studies of genetics in an effort
to prove his theory that intelligence is ge
netic and that whites are more intelligent
that blacks.
Shockley's racial theory was ridiculed by
many of his former scientific colleagues who
abandoned their association with him and
accused him of acting irresponsibly by de
parting from his field of expertise.
Despite this, Engineering School Dean
James Gibbons said it would be unfortunate
if Shockley's contributions to solid-state
physics and electronics were lost in the
genetics controversy.
"He invented the transistor and many
other devices, and without his creativity
and inventiveness, it's hard to tell where
we would be today," Gibbons said.

Shockley, Bardccn and Brattain's first
semiconductor device literally made the
electronic age possible, paving the way for
technology now found in most modern
devices, including wristwatches, airplanes,
calculators and cars.
"He was certainly one of the great sci
entists of our age," said Bardeen, now a
physics professor at Illinois. "He was the
one largely responsible for the revolution
in electronics. ... He changed the way we
live."

Shockley Semiconductor
Laboratories, the semicon
ductor company he
founded after leaving Bell
Laboratories in 1954, was
instrumental in the birth of
Silicon Valley and the
electronics industry. His
former employees later in
vented the integrated cir-

cuit and the microprocessor.
Shockley received his Ph.D. in the then
esoteric field of solid-state physics from the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology in
1932 and joined the staff of American Tele
phone &. Telegraph Co.'s Bell Labs in Mur
ray Hill, N.J., in 1936.

He met Brattain through his work on
how electrons behaved in crystals. After
World War 11, during which he worked for
the government, Shockley returned to Bell
Labs and met Bardeen soon thereafter.
With Shockley and Bardeen as
theoreticians and Brattain as the ex
perimenter, the team resumed the race to
create a solid-state device that would —
like the more vulnerable, bulkier and power
hungry vacuum tubes of the day — amplify
electronic signals.
On Dec. 23, 1947, the Bell Labs team
conducted the first successful demonstration
of a crude transistor: a pair of metal cat's
whiskers, .0005 inches apart, stuck into a
slab of germanium.
Shockley became a Stanford lecturer in
1958 and was a professor of electrical en
gineering and applied sciences from 1963
to 1975.
His pioneering work in physics was later
overshadowed by his amateur contribution
to genetics and his philosophy that the
human race was retrogressing because blacks
were reproducing faster than whites.
His theory of retrogressive evolution was
rejected by most genetics experts and stu
dents on campuses across the country

protested when he came to spealc.
He once suggested that the "genetically
inferior" should be offered cash bonuses to
undergo voluntary sterilization.
In 1978, he contributed to a specialty
sperm bank designed to match Nobel
laureates with intelligent women in an effort
to produce exceptionally intelligent
children.
His views prompted a nationwide debate
over the use of 1Q tests, which he said
helped prove his theory that blacks were
less intelligent than whites.
"He had to be taken seriously in the
sense that he was getting a lot of press,"
said Bob Blauner, a professor of sociology
at UC-Berkeley who has studied race and
ethnicity for 25 years. "But he wasn't taken
seriously by academics. We knew that many
people in the larger population took him
seriously, so we had to respond."
Most experts attribute racial differences
in IQ test scores to biased tests that do
not account for cultural differences, test
anxiety and other factors not related to
genetics, Blauner said.
"By and large, many in the academic


Shockley
community felt that his views were
very racist," said UC-Bcrkeley An
thropology Prof. William Shack.
"Shockley did not have the data
to substantiate the theories that
he attempted to advance."
Despite receiving little support

for his genetics work, Shockley
devoted nearly the last two
decades of his life to the subject
and regarded his contributions as
more important than his discovery
of the transistor, said his wife,
Emmy.
Just days before his death, he
was analyzing data on the subject,
she said.
One friend, William Spicer, a

professor of electrical engineering
at Stanford, said that Shockley in
his later years tried several times
to reach out to black people.
"I think he very much would
have liked to have found a black
person who would be a personal
friend," said Spicer.
Shockley was born in London
and grew up in Palo Alto near
the Stanford campus.

abandoned their association with him and
accused him of acting irresponsibly by de
parting from his field of expertise.
Despite this, Engineering School Dean
James Gibbons said it would be unfortunate
if Shockley's contributions to solid-state
physics and electronics were lost in the
genetics controversy.
"He invented the transistor and many
other devices, and without his creativity
and inventiveness, it's hard to tell where
we would be today," Gibbons said.

Shockley, Bardccn and Brattain's first
semiconductor device literally made the
electronic age possible, paving the way for
technology now found in most modern
devices, including wristwatches, airplanes,
calculators and cars.
"He was certainly one of the great sci
entists of our age," said Bardeen, now a
physics professor at Illinois. "He was the
one largely responsible for the revolution
in electronics. ... He changed the way we
live."

Shockley Semiconductor
Laboratories, the semicon
ductor company he
founded after leaving Bell
Laboratories in 1954, was
instrumental in the birth of
Silicon Valley and the
electronics industry. His
former employees later in
vented the integrated cir-

cuit and the microprocessor.
Shockley received his Ph.D. in the then
esoteric field of solid-state physics from the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology in
1932 and joined the staff of American Tele
phone &. Telegraph Co.'s Bell Labs in Mur
ray Hill, N.J., in 1936.

He met Brattain through his work on
how electrons behaved in crystals. After
World War 11, during which he worked for
the government, Shockley returned to Bell
Labs and met Bardeen soon thereafter.
With Shockley and Bardeen as
theoreticians and Brattain as the ex
perimenter, the team resumed the race to
create a solid-state device that would —
like the more vulnerable, bulkier and power
hungry vacuum tubes of the day — amplify
electronic signals.
On Dec. 23, 1947, the Bell Labs team
conducted the first successful demonstration
of a crude transistor: a pair of metal cat's
whiskers, .0005 inches apart, stuck into a
slab of germanium.
Shockley became a Stanford lecturer in
1958 and was a professor of electrical en
gineering and applied sciences from 1963
to 1975.
His pioneering work in physics was later
overshadowed by his amateur contribution
to genetics and his philosophy that the
human race was retrogressing because blacks
were reproducing faster than whites.
His theory of retrogressive evolution was
rejected by most genetics experts and stu
dents on campuses across the country

protested when he came to spealc.
He once suggested that the "genetically
inferior" should be offered cash bonuses to
undergo voluntary sterilization.
In 1978, he contributed to a specialty
sperm bank designed to match Nobel
laureates with intelligent women in an effort
to produce exceptionally intelligent
children.
His views prompted a nationwide debate
over the use of 1Q tests, which he said
helped prove his theory that blacks were
less intelligent than whites.
"He had to be taken seriously in the
sense that he was getting a lot of press,"
said Bob Blauner, a professor of sociology
at UC-Berkeley who has studied race and
ethnicity for 25 years. "But he wasn't taken
seriously by academics. We knew that many
people in the larger population took him
seriously, so we had to respond."
Most experts attribute racial differences
in IQ test scores to biased tests that do
not account for cultural differences, test
anxiety and other factors not related to
genetics, Blauner said.
"By and large, many in the academic


Shockley
community felt that his views were
very racist," said UC-Bcrkeley An
thropology Prof. William Shack.
"Shockley did not have the data
to substantiate the theories that
he attempted to advance."
Despite receiving little support

for his genetics work, Shockley
devoted nearly the last two
decades of his life to the subject
and regarded his contributions as
more important than his discovery
of the transistor, said his wife,
Emmy.
Just days before his death, he
was analyzing data on the subject,
she said.
One friend, William Spicer, a

professor of electrical engineering
at Stanford, said that Shockley in
his later years tried several times
to reach out to black people.
"I think he very much would
have liked to have found a black
person who would be a personal
friend," said Spicer.
Shockley was born in London
and grew up in Palo Alto near
the Stanford campus.
William Shockley, a co-inventor of the
transistor and a professor emeritus of elec
trical engineering here, died Saturday of
prostatic cancer at his campus residence.
He was 79.
Despite sharing the 1956 Nobel Prize for
physics with John Bardeen and the late
Walter Brattain, Shockley may be better
remembered for his views on race and in
telligence.
The later part of his life was spent work
ing on his studies of genetics in an effort
to prove his theory that intelligence is ge
netic and that whites are more intelligent
that blacks.
