# Art Dept. chair retires
## 
### Brian Winterfeldt 
Prof. Lorenz Eitner, chair of the
Art and Architecture Department,
plans to retire after 26 years Aug.
31. Eitner has been responsible for
upgrading the previously unranked
Art Department to one of the top
in the nation.
When Eitner arrived at the Uni
versity in 1963, the Art Depart-

ment was in a
shambles. The
faculty was un
derstaffed.
Facilities were
cramped and
shoddy. Some
professors were
even without of
fices.

"My first year at Stanford was
a nightmare from beginning to
end. ... It was very discouraging,
and for about a year I felt I had
made a ten-ible mistake," Eitner
said. "1 really wondered how I
could ever get myself out of this."
But Eitner remained and went
on to recruit an impressive faculty,
including artists Nathan Oliveira
and Frank Lobdell. In addition, he
persuaded art historian Albert El
sen to join the department's staff.
He also added an expert in Asian
art and appointed an artist in res
idence.
After the faculty was improved,
Eitner concentrated on the facil
ities. The Art Department was
previously spread throughout
various parts of the campus. In
1969 the Nathan Cummings Art
Building was dedicated, allowing
all the University's art facilities to
be housed under one roof. The
new facility included offices, lec
ture halls, an art library and
studios.
In addition to his position as
chair, Eitner was appointed direc
tor of the Art Museum. Eitner felt
that the addition of an extensive
art collection would complement
the art department in a fashion
â€” "comparable in function for the
arts and humanities to laboratories
for the sciences." He also felt that
the work would alleviate some of
"the frustrations and anxieties of
administrative work."
Assoc. Prof. Wanda Com will
assume the position of chair of
the Art Department Sept. 1.
