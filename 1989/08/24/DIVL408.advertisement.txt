# 10-For Your Information
At Whole Foods Market, food is our business. We carry the widest selection
of top quality foods in town, and we offer only the purest, freshest products
available.
But it is our people—and the information and service they provide—that
really make our store special. They know what they are doing. They believe
in what they're selling. And they care enough to want to help our customers.
Our information department has the answers to your questions about diet,
nutrition, food preparation, and product availability. If you have a complaint
or a suggestion, not only do we want to hear about it, we'll post it inside the
store, along with our response.
The bottom line is, we're here to give you the best food products and the best
service we can. It's that simple.
