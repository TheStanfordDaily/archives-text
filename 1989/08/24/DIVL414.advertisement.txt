Orient Yourself
The Stanford Daily needs writers, photographers and graphic artists to work on
its annual Orientation Issue. No experience is necessary and opportunities are even
more abundant than freshmen at a square dance.
So skip, run, hop or do anything you have to do and get yourself to The Stanford
Daily. Ask for Tim. Or John. Or Mark. Call 723-4632.
