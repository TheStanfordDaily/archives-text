On September 1, Kepler's will open for business at its new
location, across the street and one block north at the corner of El
Camino Real and Ravenswood. Our new 10,000 square foot store in
Menlo Center will feature nearly twice the floor space, ample well
lighted underground parking, and the adjoining amenities of the
British Bankers' Club and Borrone's Cafe.
Our reading series will resume full swing at the new store in mid-
September. On September 29 Tracy Kidder, Pulitzer Prize-winning
author of The Soul of a New Machine and House, will be with us to
present his new book Among Schoolchildren. The events area, we
are happy to announce, will be bigger, more comfortable, cooler in
summer, and equipped with a state of the art sound system.
To all our loyal customers and friends, and to all the new ones we
hope to make—come see us in September at 1010 El Camino Real.
