## Editor's farewell 
### 
I HAVE BEEN TOLD that the cello is the most
human of instruments, that its tones come closest
to sounding like those of the human voice.
Most newspapers can learn a lot from the cello.
Read The New York Times, the Los Angeles
Times, all the top national dailies. Take a look at Time,
Newsweek or other weekly magazines.
They are professional, certainly. The writing is of
high quality. The commentary usually is intelligent.
The designs are slick.
But all these publications lack something very es
sential.
None of them sounds quite human. Written to be
read quickly and easily, I often doubt the extent to
which they really move readers' souls.
Henry David Thoreau in "Walden" questioned the
ultimate value of reading newspapers at all. Although
Thoreau was a misanthropic grump, we ought to take
his critique seriously. Once in a while, we should
question even our deepest beliefs, one of which is
that newspapers actually are worth having around
the house.
The Weekly has tried to be decidedly different from
The Daily. The editors felt that The Daily not only
had neglected certain issues and people that are im
portant to the Stanford community, but that it had
neglected to explore some stylistic forms that could
make a newspaper better.
By discussing these neglected issues and experi
menting with unused forms, The Weekly has to some
extent dispelled my nagging fear that newspapers
usually do more harm than good — that they simply
are distractions.
Our cover stories in particular have provided a
forum through which important figures in our com
munity spoke in their own words about issues that
are important to them. I am very proud that the voices
of Jim Adams, Kennell Jackson, Robert Gregg, Diane
Frank, John Ford, Beverly Allen, Wanda Corn and
Estelle Freedman have resounded upon our pages.
They have helped make our paper more human.
Similarly, I hope our special sections, in which we
have published fiction, poetry, photo essays and a
sermon, also have been welcome, more human features
of our paper.
Most people think a newspaper simply defines the
course of debate for a community. 1 believe that a
newspaper can define the very essence of that com
munity, cohering its disparate elements into a single
whole.
Such absolute definition demands care and human
ity — it demands that one reject the seductive qualities
of irony and emotional distance, that one feel passion.
It demands that one be sensitive to the music of cellos.
I hope that The Weekly has raised at least some
consciousness, both within and outside our offices, to
the very human sounds around us.
