Recycling fervor
shouldn't end when
conferences arrive
The Stanford campus* has a
remarkably different environ
ment during the summer.
Obviously, the age groups of
those on campus are more
extreme than during the aca
demic year. But that's cer
tainly not where the differ
ences end.
During the academic year,
students, faculty and staff
alike are leaned upon to be
conscious of the environment
and, to this end, recycle. Ap
parently this "You Can Make
a Difference" ends in June,
on hiatus while various con
ferences and camps descend
on the Farm.
I worked with the Lepton-
Photon Symposium held at
various locations on campus.
The conference was spon
sored by the Stanford Linear
Accelerator Center, a unit of
the University.
Finished with a refreshing
Calistoga at the registration
reception at Elliott Program
Center, I asked one of the
organizers where the recy
cling bins were located. She
replied, "Down on the side
of this building, facing the
lake."
I asked why they were
there. She answered (in an
unbelievably whiny voice)
"They're sooo ugly." I said,
"So? Clean them up or label
other trash cans. In any
event, recycle!" My recom
mendations (OK, demands)
were never reckoned with.
Garbage cans overflowed
with recyclable paper, cans
and bottles.
Enough of the anecdote.
The bottom line is that if
various organizations (partic
ularly those of the Universi
ty) are going to use our fa
cilities, they are just going to
have to take the "bitter" with
the sweet.

But recycling is hardly dis
tasteful, and let's be real: not
only are social etiquette, aes
thetics and social responsibil
ity not mutually exclusive,
the obligation we, as
humans, have to the environ
ment clearly outweighs some
dumb social rules.

Staff people of color
face challenges of
collaborative efforts
Six months ago the Univer
sity Committee on Minority
Issues disseminated its report
to the public. I have ex
pressed once before my dis
appointment with the lack of
quality attention given to
staff affairs in that report (in
comparison to faculty and
student affairs), but that is
not the focus of this article.
Almost as if stirred into
action by this shared disap
pointment, 1 have witnessed,
with pleasure, widespread
collaboration among staff of
color since the issuance of
the report — collaboration
that I have not experienced
at this level in my employ at
Stanford. This is a very posi
tive force that the University
did not foresee in establish
ing the committee, but good
things often occur through
serendipity.
I have seen and heard staff
of color in hours of meetings
who are extraordinarily dedi
cated and loyal to the Uni
versity and the departments
in which they serve. I have
seen and heard staff of color
who have shown keen and
sensitive perception and ana
lytical skills in a variety of
subjects that compare quite
favorably with — and often
exceed — those of others
within the University.
What is bothersome is that
most of these staff members

of color have not been, and
probably will not be, able to
offer these abilities to the
University through advance
ment in their respective de
partments.
I also see within these col
laborative efforts a poten
tially forceful group that is
going to be high in expecta
tions. I sense in these meet
ings increased concern and
interest in a word that was
made popular in the UCMI
Report, and which will grow
to haunt many employees —
not just University leaders,
but staff members of color as
well. That word is "accounta
bility," that dreaded "A"
word. As this collaborative
effort becomes broader and
larger in number, "A" will
have a special burden on
individuals in human
resources-related positions on
the main campus.
The challenge is that the
opportunity for collaboration
and the yield it can bring
about must not be blown.
God help us if "zero sum"
becomes the name of the
game, as all cultural groups
attempt to advance within
the University. "Stony the
road we trod ..."
On a slightly different per
spective of the UCMI Report,
tne University is awaiting
the last chapter of the report
— the much-heralded SRI
survey of staff. There may be
more information to be
deduced from the percentage
of staff of color who chose
not to answer the survey, or
some questions in the sur
vey, than analyses of answers
chosen by those who did.
More importantly, the use
of a survey actually illustrates
resoundingly that such an
instrument would not have
been necessary if people of
color had been represented
highly in exempt positions
throughout the University.

Staff people of color
face challenges of
collaborative efforts
Six months ago the Univer
sity Committee on Minority
Issues disseminated its report
to the public. I have ex
pressed once before my dis
appointment with the lack of
quality attention given to
staff affairs in that report (in
comparison to faculty and
student affairs), but that is
not the focus of this article.
Almost as if stirred into
action by this shared disap
pointment, 1 have witnessed,
with pleasure, widespread
collaboration among staff of
color since the issuance of
the report — collaboration
that I have not experienced
at this level in my employ at
Stanford. This is a very posi
tive force that the University
did not foresee in establish
ing the committee, but good
things often occur through
serendipity.
I have seen and heard staff
of color in hours of meetings
who are extraordinarily dedi
cated and loyal to the Uni
versity and the departments
in which they serve. I have
seen and heard staff of color
who have shown keen and
sensitive perception and ana
lytical skills in a variety of
subjects that compare quite
favorably with — and often
exceed — those of others
within the University.
What is bothersome is that
most of these staff members

of color have not been, and
probably will not be, able to
offer these abilities to the
University through advance
ment in their respective de
partments.
I also see within these col
laborative efforts a poten
tially forceful group that is
going to be high in expecta
tions. I sense in these meet
ings increased concern and
interest in a word that was
made popular in the UCMI
Report, and which will grow
to haunt many employees —
not just University leaders,
but staff members of color as
well. That word is "accounta
bility," that dreaded "A"
word. As this collaborative
effort becomes broader and
larger in number, "A" will
have a special burden on
individuals in human
resources-related positions on
the main campus.
The challenge is that the
opportunity for collaboration
and the yield it can bring
about must not be blown.
God help us if "zero sum"
becomes the name of the
game, as all cultural groups
attempt to advance within
the University. "Stony the
road we trod ..."
On a slightly different per
spective of the UCMI Report,
tne University is awaiting
the last chapter of the report
— the much-heralded SRI
survey of staff. There may be
more information to be
deduced from the percentage
of staff of color who chose
not to answer the survey, or
some questions in the sur
vey, than analyses of answers
chosen by those who did.
More importantly, the use
of a survey actually illustrates
resoundingly that such an
instrument would not have
been necessary if people of
color had been represented
highly in exempt positions
throughout the University.

Recycling fervor
shouldn't end when
conferences arrive
The Stanford campus* has a
remarkably different environ
ment during the summer.
Obviously, the age groups of
those on campus are more
extreme than during the aca
demic year. But that's cer
tainly not where the differ
ences end.
During the academic year,
students, faculty and staff
alike are leaned upon to be
conscious of the environment
and, to this end, recycle. Ap
parently this "You Can Make
a Difference" ends in June,
on hiatus while various con
ferences and camps descend
on the Farm.
I worked with the Lepton-
Photon Symposium held at
various locations on campus.
The conference was spon
sored by the Stanford Linear
Accelerator Center, a unit of
the University.
Finished with a refreshing
Calistoga at the registration
reception at Elliott Program
Center, I asked one of the
organizers where the recy
cling bins were located. She
replied, "Down on the side
of this building, facing the
lake."
I asked why they were
there. She answered (in an
unbelievably whiny voice)
"They're sooo ugly." I said,
"So? Clean them up or label
other trash cans. In any
event, recycle!" My recom
mendations (OK, demands)
were never reckoned with.
Garbage cans overflowed
with recyclable paper, cans
and bottles.
Enough of the anecdote.
The bottom line is that if
various organizations (partic
ularly those of the Universi
ty) are going to use our fa
cilities, they are just going to
have to take the "bitter" with
the sweet.

But recycling is hardly dis
tasteful, and let's be real: not
only are social etiquette, aes
thetics and social responsibil
ity not mutually exclusive,
the obligation we, as
humans, have to the environ
ment clearly outweighs some
dumb social rules.
