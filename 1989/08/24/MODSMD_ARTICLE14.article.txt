Rush Hour in the Heavenly City
The meteorologist in the heavenly city apologizes profusely
to the breadwinners as they kiss their children good-bye.
he is not a dire man. The climate of unrest
in distant countries is not his fault.
If a whirlwind ever whistles through the keyhole in his briefcase,
an unlucky breadwinner will loose his important papers.
What a shame if he turns on his television some dark night and sees
a famished old woman in the heavenly city eating the scrolls
from his adding machines.
It is rush hour right now in the heavenly city. The white corpuscles
of headlights clog the traffic arteries.
The commute between darkness and light is getting tougher.
One breadwinner just compared the heavenly city to the clock in a
famous murder case
that stopped ticking when the murderer's knife entered the heart!
Today is a grey day, when goodness will show to advantage.
The breadwinners reassure themselves by wiping off their glasses.
In the distance, in the heavenly city, galaxies are traveling along
the circuits of desire.
The breadwinners are impatient, still light years away in their
air-conditioned cars.
The confraternity of early morning consoles them. Even now,
in the heavenly city.
a breadwinner is threading himself through the eye of a tollbooth.
Even now, fellow breadwinners are stepping out of elevators into
â€¢ the rooms where their inner lives
flicker in the ultraviolet spectrum of modern times.
Soon every breadwinner will be at his desk overlooking the heavenly
city, sipping his coffee,
congratulating himself upon having bought a beautiful
piece of property in the wilderness, twenty years ago, when the mortgage
rates were low, when even breadwinners didn't know
that the heavenly city would become the heavenly city.

The Nun Story
There were nuns in every branch of our family.
I imagined crows in black habits cawing
in the effulgence of my grandfather's crabapple blossoms,
crows with eyes like the seeds of crabapples.
When my uncles died young of heart attacks,
the nuns alone were undaunted.
They rushed onto the stage of grief
and knelt down like child actors who knew
they were good at playing stumps in the haunted forest.
We prayed the rosary that night with the fervor
of wild animals.
Missionary nuns looked like doves not crows.
Sister Alphonsine who lived
in Sri Lanka, "the resplendent land," sent us postcards
of purple-faced monkey called langurs
who reminded ha of Our Lord's passion and death.
I looked into the solemn eyes of those monkeys
who were gluttons for hibiscus flowers
and I couldn't find any crown of thorns.
My grandmother was the nemesis of every nun.
Every spring she looked up at the crabapple blossoms
and remembered that on her Confirmation Day her arms
had been wrapped in rags not lace.
That is what the nuns did to poor children
who couldn't afford long-sleeved white dresses.
That is why so many heads turned at my brother's wedding
when my uncles asked the nuns to dance.
My father, who was drunk too, rushed over to make amends
but before he could reach their table
the nuns had stormed out of the dance hall.
My father proposed a toast to their guardian angels.

Notes on the First Derivative
Galileo, you loved the vegetables
piled on laps in Pisa, tight-bottomed squashes
bearing down on dresses, taxing
the dark fabric, turnips
big enough to drop twice.
You loved the fruits Michelangelo
painted for you on your birthday:
cherries at the font,
ripe breasts and grapes
you could let fall.
This fall, Galileo, the children
are performing your experiments.
'Invent a tower that leans.
Bounce two red balls
from the high west window.
Watch.'
You sing as you wait
in falling tones:
4 I fell down, 1 fell under,
I fell sick, I fell for a trick,
I fell into sin, I fell
among strangers.'
And what if the whole world
had its eye on those red globes?
Suppose all of the above
fell on a Tuesday
during any war.
Dead men fall to the ground
with the live ones
among the falling-star bullets.
Soldiers fall from mangrove trees
into rice paddies where the splinters
from fallen bridges float.
Governments fall out of orbit.
Things float as they fall, isn't that
what you discovered?
Bodies float.
A mathematician on a grant
who couldn't button his suitcoat
in a hot country,
he floats.
His numbers flickered
like candles on water:
five, six, seven, eight, nine
ten stories later
he gave up on fish,
he gave up on birds.
Heavenly bodies float.
A woman, a friend of God, who lived
in our neighborhood,
fell over backwards into the ocean.
No one was watching, her tongue
started rolling, her private enemy
wrestling her down.
She floats now just above the water
on the diamond wings
of a five-month coma.
She loved rain, snow, sleet,
the weather of fall.
She floats so beautifully now
the fish look up.
As for the lovers, they swim in the moat
where limbs fall.
Hair falls on lips, mouths fall.
Fall on fibula, fall on thighs.
Leaves fall.
Galileo, you forgot
the leaves in your Discourse
on Floating Bodies.
Surely you watched them flutter
and grow tired, the deep-voiced petals of your most
successful experiments.
They were your entry in the dictionary
of fall.
Red balls, red leaves: whatever
falls slowly must be buried
in good haste.

It is low tide, and Botticelli has not yet had his fill of the seagulls.
In a moment, he stops squinting and dives into the oncoming wave,
which is crested with roses.
When Botticelli surfaces, he is already in over his head. He begins
swimming along the horizon line, pivoting his neck toward me to breathe.
He seems to be going faster than the fishing boats, named after women
for luck. How luminous the fish must be in the holds of those fishing
boats! How they must gjimmer in the darkness like goddesses' thigjis!
Botticelli treads water and scrutinizes the shoreline. I am Itftjng a
shell to my ear, the shell is the same color as my body. Botticelli swims
rapidly towards me.
