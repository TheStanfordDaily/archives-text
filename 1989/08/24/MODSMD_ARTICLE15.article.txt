## Sherri Matteo explores women's sexuality 
### Kym Boyman Editorial staff 
Sherri Matteo is associate di
rector of the Institute for Research
on Women and Gender at Stan
ford. She teaches the popular
course "Women, Sexuality and
Health."
Matteo received her Ph.D. in
psychology from Cornell Univer
sity. She has been a visiting as
sistant professor in psychology and
feminist studies at Stanford. Her
current research interests include
the functions and dysfunctions of
the menstrual cycle, menstrual
synchrony, prescription drugs and
the cognitive biases in sex role
stereotyping.
Women at Stanford are an elite
population, supposedly privileged
with knowledge about the world
and about themselves that others
don't necessarily have. In your
experience, does this elite group
have a better understanding of
their own bodies than most wom
en?
It's hard for me to get a sense
of how much information they
have or are missing, because they
tend not to offer that information.
If you think you're lacking in in
formation, you're not going to
broadcast it, especially here.
I think there are some indicators
that show that women on campus
probably have less knowledge of
their bodies than we would like
them to have.
One of the indicators is the
extent to which women suffer from
eating disorders. Some estimates
that have been given over the last
couple of years say that up to 30
percent of undergraduate women
have had some experience with
an eating disorder. That sounds
like a high estimate, but I believe
from my personal experience with
students that the figures are not
inflated.
From my classes, I've come to
understand that many students are
aware of various health issues, but
they don't necessarily know how
to interpret what they are told by
the media. They don't always

know what to do with the infor
mation once they have it.
Let's take safe sex. Everybody
knows when they come into class
that safe sex is an issue that they
need to worry about, but that
doesn't mean they know what to
say to their partners or how to
encourage a conversation about
safe sex.
When I've asked students,
"What are the issues surrounding
safe sex. 7 " they tell me, but when
when I ask them, "Do you know
what you should do about it?" or
"Do you do it?" they say "No." I
ask them, "Why not?" They say,
"Well, it's embarrassing to talk
about."
I don't think that reflects lack
of knowledge. It reflects lack of
practice. They don't lack knowl
edge. They lack an understanding
of just what to do with their
knowledge.
Why are women perhaps
alienated from their own bodies
in this way?
Our attitudes about sexuality
are very conservative. It's still dif
ficult to have material about
sexuality taught in grammar and
high schools in most parts of the
nation. It is still difficult for
families to discuss sexual topics,
for parents to communicate that

Many students are aware of various
health issues, but they don't know what
to do with the information once they
have it. Everybody knows that safe sex
is an issue that they need to worry
about, but that doesn't mean they know
what to say to their partners.

information to their children.
We haven't had many major
changes in attitudes toward
sexuality in this country. We have
scares and major fears, but what
we do with our scares and major
fears is to become even more con
trolling and conservative — note
the difficulty that people had at
first about getting condoms out
into the open.
I also think that women are
under greater pressure not to know
their bodies. I think we still have
these stereotypes that sexuality is
bad, that masturbation is bad, that
exploring genitals is bad, and so
on. In addition, because of the
way women are physically con
structed, there's less need to do
that exploration than there is for
men in the daily course of bodily
functioning.
You said that access to infor
mation really is critical for wom
en's understanding of their own
sexuality. Still, sometimes it's
very difficult to find important
information. Take tampons, for
instance. No one in the general
public really knows what goes
into them. Could you comment
on that lack?
Specific marketing techniques
of drug companies have always
"protected" women from knowing
what's going into their bodies. For
instance, the controversy concern
ing the pill that went on for all
those years still exists. What goes
in it? What does it do? Who
knows?
With tampons, it's the same

kind of issue. Do we tell people
what's really in them, what these
fibers are and what possible harm
they can cause? Or do we wait
until Toxic Shock Syndrome
emerges as a critical issue? We
have a lot of control from the top
down from the companies who
have a vested interested in con
trolling how much information
women have.
Sometimes companies have bas
ically experimented on women —
the pill is a good example. lUD's
— there weren't any tests done.
Another example concerns drug
prescriptions for the elderly. The
FDA has done very few of the
necessary clinical drug tests for
the elderly, and women make up
most of the elderly. Elderly women
are getting drugs prescribed by
their doctors who don't know what
the effect is on the older woman.
There's a good possibility that the
20- and 70-year-old body will proc
ess the same drugs differently.
It seems that years after the
women's movement, little prog
ress has been made on these
health-related issues.
I think we are a lot further than
we were before. I need to think
we're gaining. Still, the feeling of
accomplishment tends to stay
within a particular generation.
Each generation thinks there is
less progress, but we're forgetting
what it was like in the '60s and
'70s.
1 think that once progress is
accomplished, no matter how
small, we can't take it for granted.

Many of the daughters of those
who were instrumental in the
women's movement think that
once progress has been achieved
there's no reason to worry — that
we can't go back.
I've been struck by the attitude
of students who wonder, "Why
are we still worrying about these
things, haven't we taken care of
that?" No! Nothing is written in
stone, and it can be taken away
from you much more easily than
it was given in the first place.
We have so much left to ac
complish, but we shouldn't lose
sight of the fact that we have
made tremendous gains since the
'60s and '70s. Still, we need new
blood, we need younger women
to look around and see what the
issues are and then to work to
gether with feminists and others
who are in the women's movement
to keep it alive and make sure
that we continue the important
work begun by older generations
of women.
There definitely have been
gains. Take new methods of
healing, for instance. Women
seem to be coming into contact
and using that new information
you mentioned.
More women are interested in
alternative health methods and al
ternative healing.
A good example is childbirth.
Women are beginning to under
stand that there are choices, that
they don't have to give birth in
what is probably the worst position
possible — on your back. They
are starting to learn what other
women have known for centuries,
that there are other birthing po
sitions that make the birth a lot
easier, with fewer complications.
There are positions like kneeling
or squating that work with the
woman's body instead of against it.
Women are beginning to under
stand that there are other ways
of being in the world with respect
to medical care and that they will
be able to take advantage of these
