## Cardinal hopes to make noise on the gridiron 
### Mark Rogowsky Editorial staff 
The fact that the arrival of gar
gantuan offensive tackle Bob
Whitfield was not the biggest foot
ball news on campus this summer
is big news for the Stanford Car
dinal.
Why?
In Year One of the Dennis
Green Era, the mere presence of
the top offensive line recruit in
the country is not enough. Whit
field's presence — and it is a quite
formidable one, indeed — merely
signifies a victory in a recruiting
battle.
This year's edition of the Car
dinal has set its sights on winning
more important battles — the ones
that take place on the field.
Whitfield is, however, being
counted on to help Stanford re
bound from a disappointing 3-6-2
season in 1988. One of the
strengths of last year's squad was
an offensive line that included
three fifth-year seniors.
Whitfield will fill, in every sense
of the word, one of the holes left
on the line. He is currently pen
ciled in as a starter at left tackle,
giving him a shot at being the
Cardinal's first true freshman to
start on the offensive line since
1973.
Joining Whitfield in the
trenches will be the two returning
linemen: Chuck Gillingham and
Andy Papathanassiou. Gillingham
will move from a guard spot to
center, replacing the venerable
Andy Sinclair. Gillingham has
proven himself to be a reliable
perfomer over the past two years
and has started in 21 of the last
22 games.
Papathanassiou can also be
counted on, having started all 34
games Stanford has played in the
past three years. Redshirt freshman
Chris Dalman will fill the other
guard position and sophomore
John Carpenter will step in to the
other tackle slot.
Though there is a great deal of
inexperience, this line could gel
and be very successful. If it is,
Stanford's new pro-set offense —
the run-and-shoot didn't run very
well and was shot — could ring
up points in a hurry.
The firepower will come from

all sources. Running back Jon
Volpe is coming off a season in
which he became only the third
runner in Stanford history to rush
for 1000 yards. He'll find some
company in the backfield this year
as Charlie Young will move from
the slotback position he occupied
last season.
Young is a superb receiver (he
led the team in catches last year)
and should producc in the running
game. Volpe is a proven commod
ity. The only question with both
is health — they have missed some
practice time this fall.
Volpe reinjured a hamstring pull
in practice Tuesday and Young is
still hobbled after knee surgery.
Either or both may be ready for
the opener.
If they're not ready to go, Jay
Jay Lasley and Rick Davis may
step in at the halfback spot and
Scott Eschclman and Tommy Var
dcll will play fullback.
The third face in the starting
backfield will be a new one: quar
terback Steve Smith, Stanford's
fourth redshirt freshman quarter
back to start in three years. Hold
on to your collective groan for
just a second. Smith is big at 6-
foot-4, 220 pounds and has a
strong arm.
11c beat out Brian Johnson and
Jason Palumbis — two decent QBs
— in spring practice, and he has
earned the confidence of Coach
Green. There are many who feel
the failures of Johnson and
Palumbis were do in large part to
a lack of decisive action by former
Coach Jack Elway.
Whatever the case, Smith looks
good and will be given every
chance to succeed. And one of
the things that should make his
job easier is the return of a deep,
gifted receiver core.
The starting wideouts are 6-6
Ed McCaffrey and speedy Walter
Batson. McCaffrey missed last
season with a thigh injury that
never healed properly. I Ie catches
everything thrown in his direction,
runs good routes and has a 36-inch
vertical leap.
Batson simply blows by
defenders. He gets open early and
often. If he puts together the
season he seems capable of, he'll
make Smith look good in a hurry.
Behind the starters arc veterans

Chris Walsh and Jon Pinckney.
Both showed flashes of excellent
play last season and will serve as
top-notch backups or starters
should the need arise.
Hey, don't forget about the tight
end. Jim Price returns from run
and-shoot limbo to his spot at the
end of the offensive line. One of
the team's top athletes, Price can
be counted on to catch his share
of passes and block effectively.
This offense is not going to gain
a lot of press for flash, but should
score points — perhaps even in
bunches — and control the ball
when the situation warrants. If it
is able, the Cardinal could have
a really big year because things
look even better with the defense.
Eight starters return from last
year's underrated defense. Most
prominent among them is All-
America candidate Rob Hinckley,
a big-play linebacker. The senior
had 108 tackles last year including
22 for losses. He led the Pacific
10 Conference with 13 sacks. Like
the Lawrence Taylors and Cor
nelius Bennetts of the world,
Hinckley can take over a game.
The other outside linebacker
will be Bruce Lang, a two-year
starter. Between the two of them,
the outside should be well covered,
as will the inside with the return
of Jono Tunney, the team's leading
tackier. It's likely sophomore Eric
Pierce will play alongside Tunney
if he's healthy. Pierce was impres
sive in limited action last year but
is currently sidelined by a sprained
ankle. Kevin Puk is listed first on
the depth chart until Pierce can
go.
Up front, there's more good
news with the return of Lester
Archambeau and Scott Palmbush.
Archambeau, like Hinckley, is a
bona fide All-America candidate.
If he is fully recovered from knee
surgery, Archambeau will most
probably have a big year in '89.
He will be remembered as one of
the top defensive players in Stan
ford history.
Palmbush goes about his busi
ness very well at the other defen
sive end position. He came out
of nowhere in '88 to have a solid
year that included six sacks. There
is no reason he can't be even
better this season.
The big question on the line is

at nose tackle where four-year stal
wart Ray Huckestein was lost to
graduation. Redshirt sophomore
Estevan Avila was impressive in
spring practice. If Avila can per
form consistently, the defensive
line will be formidable.
The secondary returns both cor
ncrbacks in the form of Alan Grant
and Kevin Scott. They are a cocky
pair — and that's not a criticism.
If you're out there trying to defend
a guy with 4.4 speed who knows
when he's going to cut left while
you don't, you'd better be cocky.
Grant and Scott rarely give up
the big play. Backing them up will
be Tuan Van Le of the field-goal
blocking Le's. He's cocky, too.
Rob Englehardt will reclaim his
strong safety position and con
tinue to give opponents assorted
bumps and bruises. At free safety,
it appears Tony Trousset has
moved ahead of converted running
back Herbie Berry on the depth

chart.
The secondary will not get
burned deep. What they must do
is attack the middle-distance pass
ing game that victimized the Car
dinal last season.
Stanford's kicking game has
both depth and talent. John Hop
kins comes back for his third
season as the Cardinal place kick
er. He was 19-for-24 on field goals
last year and scored a team-leading
82 points.
The punting will be handled by
high school All-America Paul
Stonchouse, the top recruit at his
position. If either is injured, the
other can pull double duty though
as both are capable punters and
kickers.
How will this seemingly solid
lineup fare in 1989?
The key may be the season
opener Sept. 2 at Arizona. There

that take place on the field.
Whitfield is, however, being
counted on to help Stanford re
bound from a disappointing 3-6-2
season in 1988. One of the
strengths of last year's squad was
an offensive line that included
three fifth-year seniors.
Whitfield will fill, in every sense
of the word, one of the holes left
on the line. He is currently pen
ciled in as a starter at left tackle,
giving him a shot at being the
Cardinal's first true freshman to
start on the offensive line since
1973.
Joining Whitfield in the
trenches will be the two returning
linemen: Chuck Gillingham and
Andy Papathanassiou. Gillingham
will move from a guard spot to
center, replacing the venerable
Andy Sinclair. Gillingham has
proven himself to be a reliable
perfomer over the past two years
and has started in 21 of the last
22 games.
Papathanassiou can also be
counted on, having started all 34
games Stanford has played in the
past three years. Redshirt freshman
Chris Dalman will fill the other
guard position and sophomore
John Carpenter will step in to the
other tackle slot.
Though there is a great deal of
inexperience, this line could gel
and be very successful. If it is,
Stanford's new pro-set offense —
the run-and-shoot didn't run very
well and was shot — could ring
up points in a hurry.
The firepower will come from

all sources. Running back Jon
Volpe is coming off a season in
which he became only the third
runner in Stanford history to rush
for 1000 yards. He'll find some
company in the backfield this year
as Charlie Young will move from
the slotback position he occupied
last season.
Young is a superb receiver (he
led the team in catches last year)
and should producc in the running
game. Volpe is a proven commod
ity. The only question with both
is health — they have missed some
practice time this fall.
Volpe reinjured a hamstring pull
in practice Tuesday and Young is
still hobbled after knee surgery.
Either or both may be ready for
the opener.
If they're not ready to go, Jay
Jay Lasley and Rick Davis may
step in at the halfback spot and
Scott Eschclman and Tommy Var
dcll will play fullback.
The third face in the starting
backfield will be a new one: quar
terback Steve Smith, Stanford's
fourth redshirt freshman quarter
back to start in three years. Hold
on to your collective groan for
just a second. Smith is big at 6-
foot-4, 220 pounds and has a
strong arm.
11c beat out Brian Johnson and
Jason Palumbis — two decent QBs
— in spring practice, and he has
earned the confidence of Coach
Green. There are many who feel
the failures of Johnson and
Palumbis were do in large part to
a lack of decisive action by former
Coach Jack Elway.
Whatever the case, Smith looks
good and will be given every
chance to succeed. And one of
the things that should make his
job easier is the return of a deep,
gifted receiver core.
The starting wideouts are 6-6
Ed McCaffrey and speedy Walter
Batson. McCaffrey missed last
season with a thigh injury that
never healed properly. I Ie catches
everything thrown in his direction,
runs good routes and has a 36-inch
vertical leap.
Batson simply blows by
defenders. He gets open early and
often. If he puts together the
season he seems capable of, he'll
make Smith look good in a hurry.
Behind the starters arc veterans

Chris Walsh and Jon Pinckney.
Both showed flashes of excellent
play last season and will serve as
top-notch backups or starters
should the need arise.
Hey, don't forget about the tight
end. Jim Price returns from run
and-shoot limbo to his spot at the
end of the offensive line. One of
the team's top athletes, Price can
be counted on to catch his share
of passes and block effectively.
This offense is not going to gain
a lot of press for flash, but should
score points — perhaps even in
bunches — and control the ball
when the situation warrants. If it
is able, the Cardinal could have
a really big year because things
look even better with the defense.
Eight starters return from last
year's underrated defense. Most
prominent among them is All-
America candidate Rob Hinckley,
a big-play linebacker. The senior
had 108 tackles last year including
22 for losses. He led the Pacific
10 Conference with 13 sacks. Like
the Lawrence Taylors and Cor
nelius Bennetts of the world,
Hinckley can take over a game.
The other outside linebacker
will be Bruce Lang, a two-year
starter. Between the two of them,
the outside should be well covered,
as will the inside with the return
of Jono Tunney, the team's leading
tackier. It's likely sophomore Eric
Pierce will play alongside Tunney
if he's healthy. Pierce was impres
sive in limited action last year but
is currently sidelined by a sprained
ankle. Kevin Puk is listed first on
the depth chart until Pierce can
go.
Up front, there's more good
news with the return of Lester
Archambeau and Scott Palmbush.
Archambeau, like Hinckley, is a
bona fide All-America candidate.
If he is fully recovered from knee
surgery, Archambeau will most
probably have a big year in '89.
He will be remembered as one of
the top defensive players in Stan
ford history.
Palmbush goes about his busi
ness very well at the other defen
sive end position. He came out
of nowhere in '88 to have a solid
year that included six sacks. There
is no reason he can't be even
better this season.
The big question on the line is

at nose tackle where four-year stal
wart Ray Huckestein was lost to
graduation. Redshirt sophomore
Estevan Avila was impressive in
spring practice. If Avila can per
form consistently, the defensive
line will be formidable.
The secondary returns both cor
ncrbacks in the form of Alan Grant
and Kevin Scott. They are a cocky
pair — and that's not a criticism.
If you're out there trying to defend
a guy with 4.4 speed who knows
when he's going to cut left while
you don't, you'd better be cocky.
Grant and Scott rarely give up
the big play. Backing them up will
be Tuan Van Le of the field-goal
blocking Le's. He's cocky, too.
Rob Englehardt will reclaim his
strong safety position and con
tinue to give opponents assorted
bumps and bruises. At free safety,
it appears Tony Trousset has
moved ahead of converted running
back Herbie Berry on the depth

chart.
The secondary will not get
burned deep. What they must do
is attack the middle-distance pass
ing game that victimized the Car
dinal last season.
Stanford's kicking game has
both depth and talent. John Hop
kins comes back for his third
season as the Cardinal place kick
er. He was 19-for-24 on field goals
last year and scored a team-leading
82 points.
The punting will be handled by
high school All-America Paul
Stonchouse, the top recruit at his
position. If either is injured, the
other can pull double duty though
as both are capable punters and
kickers.
How will this seemingly solid
lineup fare in 1989?
The key may be the season
opener Sept. 2 at Arizona. There

The fact that the arrival of gar
gantuan offensive tackle Bob
Whitfield was not the biggest foot
ball news on campus this summer
is big news for the Stanford Car
dinal.
Why?
In Year One of the Dennis
Green Era, the mere presence of
the top offensive line recruit in
the country is not enough. Whit

battle.

Joining Whitfield in the
trenches will be the two returning
linemen: Chuck Gillingham and
Andy Papathanassiou. Gillingham
will move from a guard spot to
center, replacing the venerable
Andy Sinclair. Gillingham has
proven himself to be a reliable
perfomer over the past two years
and has started in 21 of the last
22 games.
Papathanassiou can also be
counted on, having started all 34
games Stanford has played in the
past three years. Redshirt freshman
Chris Dalman will fill the other
guard position and sophomore
John Carpenter will step in to the
other tackle slot.
Though there is a great deal of
inexperience, this line could gel
and be very successful. If it is,
Stanford's new pro-set offense —
the run-and-shoot didn't run very
well and was shot — could ring
up points in a hurry.
The firepower will come from

all sources. Running back Jon
Volpe is coming off a season in
which he became only the third
runner in Stanford history to rush
for 1000 yards. He'll find some
company in the backfield this year
as Charlie Young will move from
the slotback position he occupied
last season.
Young is a superb receiver (he
led the team in catches last year)
and should producc in the running
game. Volpe is a proven commod
ity. The only question with both
is health — they have missed some
practice time this fall.
Volpe reinjured a hamstring pull
in practice Tuesday and Young is
still hobbled after knee surgery.
Either or both may be ready for
the opener.
If they're not ready to go, Jay
Jay Lasley and Rick Davis may
step in at the halfback spot and
Scott Eschclman and Tommy Var
dcll will play fullback.
The third face in the starting
backfield will be a new one: quar
terback Steve Smith, Stanford's
fourth redshirt freshman quarter
back to start in three years. Hold
on to your collective groan for
just a second. Smith is big at 6-
foot-4, 220 pounds and has a
strong arm.
11c beat out Brian Johnson and
Jason Palumbis — two decent QBs
— in spring practice, and he has
earned the confidence of Coach
Green. There are many who feel
the failures of Johnson and
Palumbis were do in large part to
a lack of decisive action by former
Coach Jack Elway.
Whatever the case, Smith looks
good and will be given every
chance to succeed. And one of
the things that should make his
job easier is the return of a deep,
gifted receiver core.
The starting wideouts are 6-6
Ed McCaffrey and speedy Walter
Batson. McCaffrey missed last
season with a thigh injury that
never healed properly. I Ie catches
everything thrown in his direction,
runs good routes and has a 36-inch
vertical leap.
Batson simply blows by
defenders. He gets open early and
often. If he puts together the
season he seems capable of, he'll
make Smith look good in a hurry.
Behind the starters arc veterans

Chris Walsh and Jon Pinckney.
Both showed flashes of excellent
play last season and will serve as
top-notch backups or starters
should the need arise.
Hey, don't forget about the tight
end. Jim Price returns from run
and-shoot limbo to his spot at the
end of the offensive line. One of
the team's top athletes, Price can
be counted on to catch his share
of passes and block effectively.
This offense is not going to gain
a lot of press for flash, but should
score points — perhaps even in
bunches — and control the ball
when the situation warrants. If it
is able, the Cardinal could have
a really big year because things
look even better with the defense.
Eight starters return from last
year's underrated defense. Most
prominent among them is All-
America candidate Rob Hinckley,
a big-play linebacker. The senior
had 108 tackles last year including
22 for losses. He led the Pacific
10 Conference with 13 sacks. Like
the Lawrence Taylors and Cor
nelius Bennetts of the world,
Hinckley can take over a game.
The other outside linebacker
will be Bruce Lang, a two-year
starter. Between the two of them,
the outside should be well covered,
as will the inside with the return
of Jono Tunney, the team's leading
tackier. It's likely sophomore Eric
Pierce will play alongside Tunney
if he's healthy. Pierce was impres
sive in limited action last year but
is currently sidelined by a sprained
ankle. Kevin Puk is listed first on
the depth chart until Pierce can
go.
Up front, there's more good
news with the return of Lester
Archambeau and Scott Palmbush.
Archambeau, like Hinckley, is a
bona fide All-America candidate.
If he is fully recovered from knee
surgery, Archambeau will most
probably have a big year in '89.
He will be remembered as one of
the top defensive players in Stan
ford history.
Palmbush goes about his busi
ness very well at the other defen
sive end position. He came out
of nowhere in '88 to have a solid
year that included six sacks. There
is no reason he can't be even
better this season.
The big question on the line is

at nose tackle where four-year stal
wart Ray Huckestein was lost to
graduation. Redshirt sophomore
Estevan Avila was impressive in
spring practice. If Avila can per
form consistently, the defensive
line will be formidable.
The secondary returns both cor
ncrbacks in the form of Alan Grant
and Kevin Scott. They are a cocky
pair — and that's not a criticism.
If you're out there trying to defend
a guy with 4.4 speed who knows
when he's going to cut left while
you don't, you'd better be cocky.
Grant and Scott rarely give up
the big play. Backing them up will
be Tuan Van Le of the field-goal
blocking Le's. He's cocky, too.
Rob Englehardt will reclaim his
strong safety position and con
tinue to give opponents assorted
bumps and bruises. At free safety,
it appears Tony Trousset has
moved ahead of converted running
back Herbie Berry on the depth

chart.
The secondary will not get
burned deep. What they must do
is attack the middle-distance pass
ing game that victimized the Car
dinal last season.
Stanford's kicking game has
both depth and talent. John Hop
kins comes back for his third
season as the Cardinal place kick
er. He was 19-for-24 on field goals
last year and scored a team-leading
82 points.
The punting will be handled by
high school All-America Paul
Stonchouse, the top recruit at his
position. If either is injured, the
other can pull double duty though
as both are capable punters and
kickers.
How will this seemingly solid
lineup fare in 1989?
The key may be the season
opener Sept. 2 at Arizona. There

The second game is another
road contest, this time at Oregon

to face Washington State followed

by a home game vs. Utah. Next,
a visit to USC and the hated

Keep your seat belts fastened
— a new Big Red Machine is just
starting to get hot.
The fact that the arrival of gar
gantuan offensive tackle Bob
Whitfield was not the biggest foot
ball news on campus this summer
is big news for the Stanford Car
dinal.
Why?
In Year One of the Dennis
Green Era, the mere presence of
the top offensive line recruit in
the country is not enough. Whit
field's presence — and it is a quite
formidable one, indeed — merely
signifies a victory in a recruiting
battle.
This year's edition of the Car
dinal has set its sights on winning
more important battles — the ones
that take place on the field.
Whitfield is, however, being
counted on to help Stanford re
bound from a disappointing 3-6-2
season in 1988. One of the
strengths of last year's squad was
an offensive line that included
three fifth-year seniors.
Whitfield will fill, in every sense
of the word, one of the holes left
on the line. He is currently pen
ciled in as a starter at left tackle,
giving him a shot at being the
Cardinal's first true freshman to
start on the offensive line since
1973.
Joining Whitfield in the
trenches will be the two returning
linemen: Chuck Gillingham and
Andy Papathanassiou. Gillingham
will move from a guard spot to
center, replacing the venerable
