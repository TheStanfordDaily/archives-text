# The 						amazing Janet Evans sets another world record
## 
### Mark Rogowsky Editorial staff 
One almost feels sorry for Janet
Evans.
True, she did win three gold
medals at the 1988 Olympics in
Seoul, South Korea.
True, she's entering Stanford —
one of the nation's top universities
— this fall.
True ...
But wait, Evans has a problem.

A big problem. You see, no one
can beat her. What's a young
woman to do when she simply
swims faster than everyone else?
At the moment, the answer for
Evans is to keep challenging her
self to knock off her own world
records.
And improve on one of those
records she did Sunday at the Pan-
Pacific Swimming Championships
in Tokyo. Evans captured the 800-
meter freestyle in a time of 8

minutes, 16.22 seconds.
Evans, who'll turn 18 this com
ing Monday, finished 25 meters
ahead of Janelle Elford of
Australia. Elford was clocked at
8:31.16
"I felt good from the beginning
so I thought I could set a world
record," Evans said. Her victory
in the 800 brought her one of
four gold medals in the champi
onships and she is currently riding

a 22-racc winning streak.
In Saturday's action, Evans won
the 400-meter freestyle. Friday,
she won the 400-meter individual
medley in 4:39.38.
She also teamed with Mitzi
Kremer, Stacy Cassiday and Julie
Kole to set a meet record in the
800-meter freestyle relay Friday.
In other news, sophomore Jeff
Rouse won the 100-meter back
stroke Thursday in a time of 56.34.

On the same day, junior Barb Mctz
took second in the 1,500-meter
freestyle, clocking in at 16:27.44.
Saturday, sophomore Dede
Trimble won the 200-meter back
stroke. Finally, on Sunday, junior
Michelle Griglione came in third
in the 200-meter individual med
ley at 2:16.77. Jenna Johnson
teamed with Lea Loveless, Tracey
McFarlane and Jenny Thompson
to capture the 400-fneter medley
relay in 4:09.93.
