# Visiting Chinatown
## San Francisco's Chinatown is more than just souvenirs 
### Lily Tan 
Chinatown. A century ago the word
would have conjured up images of an exotic,
mysterious subculture embedded in the
shadows of San Francisco.
Set apart by its distinct customs, lan
guage, dress and mannerisms, the Chinese
community was little understood and re
garded more as a curiosity than as the
cultural center it has come to represent
today.
Tangrenbu, as it was called then, con
sisted of a stretch of shops six block Jong
and two block wide, and houses catering

to the needs of a community forced by
strong discrimination to rely upon itself.
Tangrcnbu was constructed during the
late 1800's in direct response to the hostile
anti-Chinese sentiment that characterized
the times. Laws such as the Chinese Ex
clusion Act of 1882, the Scott Act of 1888
and the Geary Act of 1892 made the Chi
nese the only people to have been specif
ically, legally denied entrance to the United
States.
Faced with such inescapable hostility,
the Chinese were forced to depend upon

themselves for support and mutual
protection.
Visitors of Old Tangrenbu dis
covered a community entirely
foreign to the surrounding city.
Here lay a city within a city, char
acterized by its crowded markets
and tiny shops offering everything
from herbs and ginseng to lanterns
and clothing. The style of dress,
the opium smokers, the men with
long, ornamented queues and the
curious mixture of foreign sounds
and smells all combined to give
Old Chinatown its distinctly
foreign flavor.
Today, Chinatown has become
a bustling center of activity, its
crowded streets overflowing with
traffic and tourists.
Despite the Americanization of
this ethnic center, however, much
of the flavor of Old Chinatown
still remains. The busy streets are
still home to hundreds of Chinese
who shop its open air markets and
fish and poultry stores.

Jewelry stores of the area still
offer goods of decidedly Chinese
origin, including jade, gold pieces
and ivory carvings. Clothing shops
carry traditional Chinese garments
along with their stock of Western
wear. And tea shops still carry the
same colorful variety of teas,
tobaccos and medicinal herbs from
the Orient.
Chinatown today is probably
best noted for its selection of res
taurants. Restaurants representing
cuisines from various provinces of
China as well as tea houses offer
ing dim sum make dining in
Chinatown a unique cultural ex
perience for those interested in a
deviation from the norm.
Glimpses of old Tangrenbu can
still be seen in the basements
where mah jong matches arc held,
in Portsmouth Square where the
elderly engage daily in lengthy
games of Chinese chess, and in
the theaters where traditional Chi
nese plays are still enacted. These
subtle hints of the past combine
with the modernized elements of
the present to give Chinatown the
unique character it has become
famous for.
