## WEATHER REPORT 
### 
The phenomena of the year take place every
day in a pond on a small scale. Every morning,
generally speaking, the shallow water is being
warmed more rapidly than the deep, though
it may not be made so warm after all, and
every evening it is being cooled more rapidly
until the morning. The day is an epitome of
the year.
One attraction in coming to the woods to live
was that 1 should have leisure and opportunity
to see the spring come in. The ice in the pond
at length begins to be honey-combed, and I
can set my heel in it as I walk. Fogs and rains
and warmer suns are gradually melting the
snow; the days have grown sensibly longer;
and I see how I shall get through the winter
without adding to my wood-pile, for large fires
are no longer necessary. I am on the alert for
the first signs of spring, to hear the chance
note of some arriving bird, or the striped squir
rel's chirp, for his stores must be now nearly
exhausted, or sec the woodchuck venture out
of his winter quarters.
â€” Henry David Thoreau, "Walden"
