# Impressions: wandering through Chinatown
## 
### David Chang Editorial staff 
A small collection of San Franciscans on
the bus; headed west, a late Saturday morn
ing still sinking in. The sun makes more
of an impact on some people than on others:
as we pass Belcher Street, there's a man
sprawled out right there under the street
sign, unconscious.
As we enter a tunnel, the driver fires
two quick bursts and the bus slithers in,
like something live, the sound echoing
around us.
A transfer to a northbound, and I'm in
Chinatown.
Walking down the sidewalk, the markets
that sell tourist trinkets capture my atten
tion at first. Bamboo back-scratchers, plastic
scimitars, X-rated fortune cookies.

But then I start noticing that the area
is full of hidden places — below, above,
between.
Below a doll shop's colorful showcase,
there's a short stone staircase that leads
down to a wooden door. The number "753
1/2" is printed on the lintel. A few pages
of a Chinese newspaper and a paper take
out box sit on the grimy steps.
Further down, a door is propped open.
It leads to a private club; "members only,"
it reads. A corridor runs from the door
down to a room where a few men sit at a
table. One of them eyes me warily as I
walk by.
Off of Clay Street, an alley named
Ah leads to a little pavement park: a vol
leyball and tennis court, some monkey bars,
a sand box and some swings. This Saturday,
it's pretty busy. There's no grass
to be seen.
Most of the markets off Grant
Street sell food instead of trinkets.
They are small, family-run opera
tions, selling white peaches, green
plums, turtles, cow tongue, tripe
and dried salt fish, as well as more
ordinary fare — fresh fish, live
crabs, salted peanuts, candy.
Any mother who knows her bar
gains will tell you that, despite
the strange smells, some of the
best deals are here, especially for
produce. Fish comes here straight
from the docks, and people some
times buy fruits and vegetables
right out of the trucks that are
parked at the curb.
On Grant, there is an open area
that leads into a two-story mall.
I step in for a moment. Clerks
and maitre d's stand at attention
in front of neat showcases and
restaurant entrances, as if they are
being monitored for rigidity.
Strange, like some planner has re

arranged a few stores to make
them more palatable.
While passing by an import
store, I happen to glance at the
second floor. It's elegantly
decorated, boasting a beautifully
carved facade, painted in greens
and pinks. Curious, 1 go into the
store, past the primping wooden
eagle and the enormous, intricate
bridge carved in ivory that stand
by the door.
"What's upstairs?" I ask.
"Oh, that's not us. It's our
landlord's property."
"What do they do up there?"
1 he storekeeper shrugs.
"Smoke, drink, play mah jong."
Oh. The addictive tile-based
game is somewhat like dominoes.
My mother always mentions that
when she criticizes her mother-in
law: "She plays mah jong." She
says it with the same tone some
people use when talking about
poker and video games.
A few years ago, a different ver
sion of the game was selling well
in the United States. The rules
were the same, but it had been
repackaged as a high-resolution

computer game.
In Portsmouth Square, a few
tables attract crowds of people —
mostly Asian, middle-aged, a few
Hispanic and black people, all
men. Some wear suits; others are
much more casual. Amidst the
fluttering black pigeons, at two
tables, the men are playing poker.
At the other tables, they play
Chinese chess, a complex game
resembling ordinary chess that my
father tried to teach me. 1 would
have liked it, 1 think, if 1 had
been able to read the characters
and tell the pieces apart.
Other people wander through
the park. A scruffy man selling
T-shirts. A few parents bringing
kids to th£ .playground.
An elderly man hobbles up to
a water fountain, holding a stiff,
dried leaf. Carefully, he presses
the button and holds the leaf in
front of the flow of water so that
the pigeons can drink some liquid
refreshment from the cobbles
tones. Across the green, another
man sits on his haunches, groans
and picks his nose.
