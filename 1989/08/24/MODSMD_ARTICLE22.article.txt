# ‘sex, lies’ benefits from talented cast
## 
### Mark Tompkins Staff writer 
A drumbeat of hype for "sex, lies, and videotape"
began several months ago, even before it won Best
Film at the Cannes Film Festival. The advance
publicity would have you believe that it's the
cinematic version of the Second Coming, but no
movie could live up to all that hoopla. Scaled-down
expectations are the order of the day here.
The movie is a bit too long, and it's far more
portentous than it needs to be. But apart from that
it looks like first-time writer/director Steven Soder
bergh might actually have a career ahead of him.
Provided he survives the hype, that is.
Mide for a dinky $1.2 million, the movie opens
with Ann (Andie MacDowell), a housewife in Lou
isiana, delivering what is essentially a comic
monologue to her therapist. Sex is the one topic
she keeps circling around; it turns out that she
doesn't like her husband John (Peter Gallagher) to
touch her. A slick, successful lawyer, John is having
an affair with Ann's sister Cynthia (Laura San
Giacomo).
To judge from the amount of sweat involved, they

have great sex together, but whenever they get
vertical again, they have nothing to discuss. Cynthia
is apparently using the affair to express her hatred
for her repressed, 'proper' sister, who doesn't know
what's going on.
And then the iceman cometh, equipped with a
video camera. John has invited Graham (James
Spader), an old frat buddy whom he hasn't seen in
nine years, to come stay for a while. John can't help
but notice immediately how his frat brother has
gone all weird on him: Graham wears the same
black shirt and jeans all the time. He doesn't work.
And he drifts. Mostly he just drifts.
Despite his aura of sensitivity, Graham has the
soul of a Frigidaire. Although he confesses to Ann
that he's impotent, he remains oddly detached, pas
sively aloof. Ann then discovers the first of Graham's
secrets — he videotapes women as they tell him all
about their sex lives, because watrhing the tapes is
the only way he can become sexually aroused. This
rather novel, kinky twist strikes a chord in both
Ann and Cynthia, and eventually wreaks havoc in
the lives of all four characters.
Graham's affliction is all too modern: His VCR
is his only friend. His video fetish is the movie's
center of interest, and whenever Soderbergh turns
his attention somewhere else the movie becomes
much less provocative.
Halfway through the movie 1 experienced a kind
of whiplash and realized that 1 couldn't care less
about John and Cynthia and their whoop-dec-doo
affair. These two are boring, stock characters.
Peter Gallagher and Laura San Giacomo arc well
cast, though. Both of them are dark and earthy
looking (despite his Yupscale wardrobe, Gallagher
looks like he should be tilling a field somewhere),
and it's easy to imagine them having sex on the
brain for 25 hours a day.
James Spader and Andie MacDowell, on the other
hand, have these airy, patrician looks. MacDowell
in particular looks like she just stepped out of a
perfume commercial (which isn't surprising, since
she's a former model).
With her looks, you can sec that John might have
wanted Ann as the ultimate lifestyle accessory, a
beautiful wife to have on his arm at social functions.
