# TREASURE
## 
### 
Never in the history of treasure
hunting have so many been so
close to a bright and shining future
filled with fabulous and fortuitous
fortune!
But The Black Eyes of Orpheus,
that great "Treasure" of "Ancient
Legend," still remains hidden,
obscure, glowing softly in its
elusive hiding place.
Where is it? The Weekly
declines to reveal the truth. A
mystery unsolved must remain a

mystery, a thorn in the side of
young sleuths and hunters after
glory.
We only suggest the following:
If you seek The Black Eyes of
Orpheus, stop asking the wrong
people! The Black Eyes circulate
only in the highest of society, the
cream of the constellations, the
BM and W on C.
If you are still searching, we bid
you good luck.
The Black Eyes of Orephus: in
pace requiescat!
