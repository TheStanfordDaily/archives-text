# Ex-Vortex: dance club is now the Edge
## 
### David Chang Editorial staff 
Although Palo Alto isn't known
for its nightlife, there have been
some changes made this summer
that attempt to improve the situ
ation.
The Vortex, that modern rock
club on California reputed to be
rife with Pali Highers, changed
hands in July to become the Edge.
The dangling mannequins have
been removed from the anteroom.
The deejay's work area has moved
aside to create more space for
dancing, and the sound and light
systems have been revamped.

In the middle of the floor, a
small raised area allows more con
fident dancers to rise above the
rest. The staff, including the
deejay, has been changed. On one
wall, a city skyline has been
sculpted out in bas-relief. A res
taurant has opened to serve
burgers and assorted fare.
But the change is mostly one
of image, not interiors. In the fu
ture, the Edge may host bands
that match the Vortex's modern
rock format.
Edge President Jacek Rosicki
says, "There arc lots of new faces.
It's definitely an older crowd." The

new patrons are more concerned
about appearances, too. "There're
lots of GQ looks," Rosicki con
tinues, "lots of black turtlenecks."
According to Rosicki, business
has picked up. "Basically," he says,
"the whole club is dancing."

Cover charge at the Edge is $4 for
people over 2I and $8 for people
wider 21 on Fridays and Saturdays.
On Thursdays, couples over 21 get
in for $2 and those under 21 enter
for $4■ Sundays and Mondays are
youth nights — ages 14 to 18 only,
$6. The Edge is located at 260
California St., Palo Alto. Call 324-
EDGE for a complete schedule.
