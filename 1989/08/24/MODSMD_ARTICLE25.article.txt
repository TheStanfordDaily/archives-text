For 30 years a major voice in
feminism, Adrienne Rich has con
tinually sought unity between her
personal life and broader spheres
of relevance: the women's com
munity, political conflict, culture,
history. Rich's new collection of
poems focuses particularly on the
power of time in the struggle for
human liberation.
"Time's Power" is conceived at
a turning point in history. In the
poet's personal life, it stands at a
crossroads between, in her own
terms, youth and old age. Politi
cally, it brooks a passage between

a ruined social order and a new
order imagined but as yet un
created.
Its poetic effect is that of passing
through the eye into the other
side of a storm and wondering
what one should carry from the
past, what Rich calls "that country
I never chose/ that country of ter
rible leavings and returnings ...
that country whose map I carry
on my palm," where "history is
one fire."
These poems seek meaning in
human relationships by honestly
appraising the various manifesta
tions of time: receding past, pres
ent moment, dynamic movement
into future. "Love Poem" balances
the vibrancy of the narrator's lover
with the realities of old age and
death.
"Negotiations" looks beyond

conflict with a political companion
to a time of saying, "I read you
always, even when I hated you."
In "A Story," which describes the
power relations between two al
legorical types called Absence and
Home, Rich envisions another
kind of revelation: the time when
Home will develop her own lan
guage, distinct from Absence.
On a larger political level, Rich
fulfills the power of time by cap
turing moments in political history
and reworking them to extract
human dimensions that traditional
histories often neglect.
Rich's most arresting amend
ment to history occurs in "Harper's
Ferry" after a runaway white girl
overhears talk of abolitionist John
Brown's raid on a federal arsenal
and, gathering anger from her
abused childhood, takes a place

in the larger political theater.
In an extra-historical flourish,
Rich introduces Harriet Tubman,
the "General Moses" who crosses
the "porch of history" and leaves
the girl to ponder questions central
to this collection: Who now is my
leader? What do I owe to my past?
What is worth risking?
In her 1970 poem "A Valedic
tion Forbidding Mourning," Rich
wrote, "when I think of a
landscape, I am thinking of a
time." "Time's Power" develops an
association of time and landscape
consistent with the reproduction
of the John Frederick Kensett
landscape on the book's cover.
For Rich, the power of
landscape is not the mythological
use of it, the belief that "the land


Adrienne Rich
can save us," that ours is a
promised land. The biblical Moses,
Rich assures us, is "somewhere
else." Rather, the land's power is
its ability to generate memory and
hope.
The landscapes Rich uses in
"Time's Power" bring her to the
heart of the matter, to that center
of energy where past and future
meet. "Harper's Ferry" begins at
"two river-roads/ glittering at each

other's throats" and "Living Mem
ory" arises from a crossroads in
Vermont "where late, late in time
you recognize/ part of yourself is
buried."
In "Walking Down the Road,"
California becomes for a moment
"a lost piece of Mexico" and an
occasion for retracing the progres
sion of Manifest Destiny from the
persecution of Native Americans
to the moon.
An overarching significance of
landscape to "Time's Power" is
that is orients us horizontally
rather than vertically. The ar

cheology of Rich's 1972 poem
"Diving into the Wreck" it already
accomplished. Relics from the
past, like old medical slides that
"still kill," share our horizontal
space and face us in the present.
Piano music once played by the
poet's mother now "streams on
the car radio in the freeway night."
The book's central image is not
the obscuring depth of ocean but
the clear expanse of a delta,
"springing from a riverbed/ with
its five fingers spread." This hand,
we remember, is the one of which
we carry the record of our past

into the uncharted desert, the one
Rich would have us unclasp to
rediscover its cunning.
The breadth of time and
landscape these poems contain
and the unknown they confront
occasionally orient Rich towards
eternity. In her last poem she ad
dresses "whatever you are that has
tracked us this far." However, Rich
is no mystic. Eternity docs not
respond, and when facing it di
rectly, her language is least effec
tive.
In"The Desert as Garden of
Paradise," a song crosses the desert

"to where the mountains hang in
chains/ as if they never listened."
At the end of the hook, Rich is
still "trying to read [a] name in
the illegible air."
From here, one is inclined to
backtrack and to recollect those
unexpected moments, as in "Living
Memory," when Absence answers
in our own grammar and we rec
ognize our place in time: "When
Selma threw/ her husband's ashes
into the Hudson/ and they blew
back on her and on us, her
friends,/ it was life. Our blood
raced in that gritty wind."
