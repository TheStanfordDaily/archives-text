Marcia Cohen's "The Sister
hood: The Inside Story of the
Women's Movement and the
Leaders Who Made It Happen"
relates the stories of these and
other forgotten women.
Cohen focuses particularly upon
four leaders of the women's move
ment — Betty Fricdan, Germaine
Greer, Kate Millett and Gloria
Steinem.
Friedan, a middle-class house
wife from Peoria, delivered one of
the first blows to the accepted
roles of women with her 1963 book
"Feminine Mystique," which
asserted that women suffer from
a lack of self-worth.
She once quipped to a meeting
of women advertisers, "No woman
gets an orgasm from shining the
kitchen floor," and Friedan's
rhetorical style reflected her
tough, domineering pragmatism,
which later would cause major
shifts in the National Organization
for Women, which she helped
found in 1966.

Greer, like Friedan, disliked her
middle-class mother's falseness.
Leaving her Australian home at
17, Greer was particularly im
pressed by the capability, honesty
and sisterhood of her rural female
relatives.
The author of the 1972 classic
"The Female Eunuch: or Why I
Despise Women," which attacked
a self-denigrating femininity
defined by male desire, Greer
spoke widely in the United States,
although she eventually became
disenchanted with the American
feminist community.
Millett was a struggling artist
and college lecturer. Raised in an
Irish Catholic home in St. Paul,
Minn., Millett rebelled against the
authorities that surrounded her,
particularly the Church.
In 1970, she wrote "Sexual

Politics," a full-blown attack on
masculinity and male literary
giants. Millett later caused a public
scandal by openly discussing her
bisexuality.
Steinem was the most clear and
prominent voice of the women's
movement, although she had little
to do with its early inception. One
time "undercover" Playboy bunny,
Steinem founded Ms. magazine
and became a popular lecture
circuit personality. Cohen's book

discusses Steincm's ugly childhood
and her splash onto the New York
literary scene in the early 19605.
Cohen argues that, apart from
their political ideas, each of these
very prominent feminists
succeeded because of a special
combination of controversy, sex
appeal and publicity savvy that

made them attractive to the na
tional media.
This attractiveness, writes
Cohen, often created trouble.
Popular news accounts of the
women's movement often painted
pictures of female neurotics or
completely ignored the move
ment's grassroots quality. By
focusing on the cult of personality,
the media created artificial con
flicts among feminists while often
ignoring their real political differ
ences.
Cohen's book is in part an at
tempt to explore these political
differences. "Feminism always was,
perhaps always will be, madden
ingly complex," she writes. "For
every flag flown high, there was
opposition from within."
In particular, Cohen explains
how issues of class, race and
sexuality divided existing organi
zations and discouraged many
women from identifying with
them. NOW, for instance, always
possessed a white, middle-class,
heterosexual flavor that even
today de-legitimizes its claim to
being the primary feminist organ
ization in the United States.
Cohen also argues that both the
high media profile of the women's
movement and its inherent inter
nal conflicts eventually slowed it
down. As a national reaction to
feminism labeled it anti-man and
anti-family, many women visibly
decided not to join the movement.
The Equal Rights Amendment,
which once seemed unstoppable,
failed, and women's rights
retreated somewhat in the face of
a conservative backlash.

"The Inside Story" is somewhat
limited and ahistorical in focus. It
ignores, for example, earlier Amer
ican women's movements and un
derplays the vast vitality of local
women's collectives and
consciousness-raising groups by

focusing on specific "leaders." It
also docs not pretend to create a
complex theoretical argument.
Nevertheless, Cohen tells a bril
liant and energetic story which
assumes no specialized knowledge.
Hers is a refreshingly clear record
of two decades of change, as well
as a reminder that the struggle for
equality is all too easily forgotten.

David Frazee is an undeclared soph

Cohen, often created trouble.

Cohen's book is in part an at
tempt to explore these political
differences. "Feminism always was,
perhaps always will be, madden
ingly complex," she writes. "For
every flag flown high, there was
opposition from within."
In particular, Cohen explains
how issues of class, race and
sexuality divided existing organi
zations and discouraged many
women from identifying with
them. NOW, for instance, always
possessed a white, middle-class,
heterosexual flavor that even
today de-legitimizes its claim to
being the primary feminist organ
ization in the United States.
Cohen also argues that both the
high media profile of the women's
movement and its inherent inter
nal conflicts eventually slowed it
down. As a national reaction to
feminism labeled it anti-man and
anti-family, many women visibly
decided not to join the movement.
The Equal Rights Amendment,
which once seemed unstoppable,
failed, and women's rights
retreated somewhat in the face of
a conservative backlash.

"The Inside Story" is somewhat
limited and ahistorical in focus. It
ignores, for example, earlier Amer
ican women's movements and un
derplays the vast vitality of local
women's collectives and
consciousness-raising groups by

focusing on specific "leaders." It
also docs not pretend to create a
complex theoretical argument.
Nevertheless, Cohen tells a bril
liant and energetic story which
assumes no specialized knowledge.
Hers is a refreshingly clear record
of two decades of change, as well
as a reminder that the struggle for
equality is all too easily forgotten.

"The Sisterhood: The Inside
Story of the Women's Movement
and the Leaders Who Made it
Happen"

Flo Kennedy, Ti-Grace Atkin
son, Germaine Greer, Kate Millett,
Betty Fricdan, Gloria Steinem and
Susan Brownmiller all helped
shape the early years of the Amer
ican women's movement. Most re
member Steinem or Friedan, but
many of those names today evoke
vague looks of uncertainty.
Marcia Cohen's "The Sister
hood: The Inside Story of the
Women's Movement and the
Leaders Who Made It Happen"
relates the stories of these and
other forgotten women.
Cohen focuses particularly upon
four leaders of the women's move
ment — Betty Fricdan, Germaine
Greer, Kate Millett and Gloria
Steinem.
Friedan, a middle-class house
wife from Peoria, delivered one of
the first blows to the accepted
roles of women with her 1963 book
"Feminine Mystique," which
asserted that women suffer from
a lack of self-worth.
She once quipped to a meeting
of women advertisers, "No woman
gets an orgasm from shining the
kitchen floor," and Friedan's
rhetorical style reflected her
tough, domineering pragmatism,
which later would cause major
shifts in the National Organization
for Women, which she helped
found in 1966.

Greer, like Friedan, disliked her
middle-class mother's falseness.
Leaving her Australian home at
17, Greer was particularly im
pressed by the capability, honesty
and sisterhood of her rural female
relatives.

"The Female Eunuch: or Why I
Despise Women," which attacked
