In "Memory and Enthusiasm," Assoc.
Prof, of English W. S. Di Piero shows
himself to be a lucid writer and an honest
thinker. His collection of varied essays
covers a period of 10 years, exhibiting a
mature curiosity in a wide range of fields,
from philosophy to film to poetry.
His clear prose reflects the mind of a
critic-writer deeply engaged in the process
of working out a poetics which embodies
both memory, the act of remembrance, of
recollecting the past, and enthusiasm, the
"lyric imperative: O Look!" — the careful
"enthusiastic noticing" of the present en
vironment.
Di Piero successfully moves beyond the
vision of the self-centered, self-conscious
writer — beyond solipsism — and connects
himself to the community which surrounds
him. That community takes many forms in
"Memory and Enthusiasm." At times, it is
a community of intellectual thought; at
other times, it is the working-class neigh
borhood where he grew up.
In some essays, Di Piero engages himself
with the philosophy of Sartre or the writings
of Coleridge. He moves on to Dante,
William and Henry James, or the ignored
William Brock. All these figures, along with
Thom Gunn, Seamus Heany, J.V. Cunning
ham and Byron, are part of Di Piero's
community.
He is more than a reader, more than an
intellectual admirer — he is engaged with
their contributions. They have become a
part of his thought and experience. Di Piero
is related to them as much as he is related
to the working people of his neighborhood
when he was growing up — people who
were "earthborn and earthbound." At all
times, the community with which Di Piero
is in dialogue is a community which he
experiences, and his experience of it is quietly
urgent.
Di Piero is a writer who is concerned
with his relations with those around him,

Di Piero's essays em
body the "restless,
groping interior" of a
man who encounters
pieces of the external
world (never mistaking
those pieces for the
whole), and he seems
thoroughly involved and
challenged by those
encounters.

with those other than himself: "Maybe
reaching towards — talking towards — an
other is a normal cry for public intimacy.
It is the first real moment of publication."
Among many other themes, Di Piero ex
plores this connectedness vividly through
out his essays. "Save us from our singleness!"
he writes. He is not a writer content to
divorce himself from his culture and society.
In "Out of Notebooks" (the only section
in the collection which is not an essay, but
"thoughts" taken from his notebooks), Di
Piero writes: "What matters most is that
encounter, registered in the delivered lan
guage, between the external world and the
restless, discontent, groping apprehending
interior."
Di Piero's essays embody the "restless,
groping interior" of a man who encounters
pieces of the external world (never mistak
ing those pieces for the whole), and he
seems thoroughly involved and challenged
by those encounters. Whatever he reads,
and whomever he is examining, Di Piero
returns himself and his audience to solid
ground. He makes connections between art
and the artists, and explores, in various
ways, the role of art in society.
If Di Piero is an admirer of good writing,
he is not a critic who admires good writing
for its own sake. In warning again the

excesses of "rigorous enthusiasm," he points
out that a poetry interested in capturing
and describing only the "celebrative pres
ent" suffers from "a kind of agoraphobia:
instead of seizing the occasion of poetic
speech as one for recollecting, interrogating,
and telling the experience of history in its
changes, it withdraws from any kind of
disclosure or public enactment of history."
For Di Piero, a poetry that looks only
at the present with its celebrative stare and
fails to incorporate itself into time — into
history — is a poetry that "elects dissocia
tion and chooses poverty."
Di Piero is wholly aware of his personal
history and of his "Amcricaness"; this is
one of his greatest strengths, for he has
clearly situated himself in the context of
his own place and time.
In his preface he states: "What mattered

to me was not personality or personhood
but experience, specifically the felt intel
lectual experience of being an American
two generations removed from Europe
whose saturated Americanism yet retained
a dim but certain afterimage of another
place."
The "afterimage of another place" is, for
Di Piero, a deep and personal awareness
of history and his essays consistently reflect
that writing is a dialogue with history. "To
engage in any pattern (of writing), even if
the engagement is destructive, is to recollect
the written past." His sense of historical
perspective and his sense of Americaness
arc the foundations for his critical thinking.
In his essay on William and Henry James,
Di Piero writes: "An American artist is, I
believe, historically determined to be half
in love with what is unfinished, half-refined,
and doomed to expect always to hear a
shout in the desert." In many ways, Di
Piero himself is all too aware that his
thoughts on poetry, writing and art arc
unfinished and half-refined. In his seminal
essay which ends his book (appropriately
entitled "Work"), Di Piero reflects on his
own work as a poet.
He has arrived, he writes, at a "middle
zone," a place located somewhere between
the enslaved Caliban and high-flying Ariel.
He works in that place which "sucks every
thing downward," but writes out of the
Ariel instinct of the imagination.
But the "middle zone" where Di Piero
now stands is not an immutable place. "The
middle zone," according to Di Piero, "which
only exists in the writing, is at least a
provisional passage during which fact and
inspiration may be unevenly, often unpret
tily, welded."
Di Piero resists any temptation to tall
into the trap of spouting aesthetic dogmas.
His "poetics" may be "unfinished" and his
conclusions may be tenuous, but the think
ing reflected in these essays is all the more
admirable for its uncompromising commit
ment to the process of reading, the process
of writing, the process of learning — the
process of becoming a poet.
