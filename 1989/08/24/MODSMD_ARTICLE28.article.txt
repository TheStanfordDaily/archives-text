## Estelle Freedman discusses feminist scholarship 
### Elizabeth Howton Editorial staff 
Feminist studies at Stanford is
an up-and-coming program. More
students than ever, both women
and men, are discovering courses
like U.S. Women's History, Intro
duction to Feminist Studies, and
History of Sexuality in America
— and so more of them are coming
into contact with History Prof.
Estelle Freedman.
When they ask a question in
class, her students are used to her
saying, "What do you think?" or
"Be specific!" Her expectations of
students are high.
Yet she is tremendously well
liked and in demand as an adviser.
She won the Dinkelspiel Award
for Outstanding Service to Under
graduate Education in 1981 and
the Dean's Award for Distin
guished Teaching in 1978.
She graduated from Barnard
College in 1969 and got her
master's and doctorate at Colum
bia in 1972 and 1976. Her most
recent book is "Intimate Matters:
A History of Sexuality in
America," coauthored with John
D'Emilio; she has written or edited
three other books and over 15
articles on feminism, women's his
tory and the history of sexuality.
She was a founder of the
Feminist Studies Program, serving
as co-chair in its first year, 1980-
81, and chair in 1984-85. She has
recently been promoted to full pro
fessor, effective Sept. 1.
How did you first become in
terested in feminist scholarship
and women's history?
1 think going to college in the
late '60s made me ripe for becom
ing a historian of women in the
'70s. I went to school as part of
that generation that very much
opened up to new ideas and to
criticizing the established hierar
chies of order and power.
Also, I went to a women's col
lege — I went to Barnard in New
York. Half of my professors were
women, and several of them were
strong feminists. For instance, for
English I had Catherine Stimpson,
who went on to found the journal
Signs, and who was sharing an
office with Kate Millett. And I
had a wonderful professor of his
tory named Annette Baxter who
was doing women's history in the
'60s before it was generally being
done.
I was at Columbia during the
student strike, when students took
over the buildings at Columbia ...
when the police busted the stu
dents. It really shook up all of my
views of the university.
I was not one of the students
who occupied buildings, but I was
one of the people who defended
the students in the wake of the
police attacks, and I was appalled
by the University's failure to ne
gotiate and by their need to rely
on force — excessive force. It was
a complete breakdown of all the
values that the university was sup
posed to stand for.
It made it more interesting to
go into academics at that moment,
this time in which our generation
was going to change things.
So there was this general back
drop of protest — of criticizing
the university's role in war re
search and as a slumlord — while
I was at this women's college,
which was not like that. Our fac
ulty and administration were very
supportive of the students. When
we said, "We're big girls now —
we don't want parietals any more,"
they said, "Yes, that's true, let's

talk about it."
The context of protest and com
ing of age within it, the reemer
gence of feminism and the
experience in a patriarchal insti
tution like Columbia in contrast
to a women's college, made me
want to do scholarship, in this
case history, that helped to ex
plain, how did it get this way?
That's the question that made
me want to do social history —
how did it get this way? Why are
race relations this way, why are
the cities in the state they're in,
why are women having to start
this battle again when they had
been struggling for so long? History
seemed to be a way to ask those
questions and to be able to answer
them.
The interdisciplinary feminist
scholarship came a few years later,
really after graduate school, when
I started teaching and getting to
know people in other departments
who had gone through the same
process in literature or sociology
or anthropology, and began put
ting together women's studies
committees.
Do you feel like your work in
feminist studies is ultimately
aimed at making feminist studies
unnecessary — to make it inte
grated into the curriculum gen
erally, so that every class is taught
with women in mind?
I do want every class to be
taught with consciousness of
women and gender, but I don't
think that makes feminist schol
arship unnecessary.
So you don't think that the
separate discipline called feminist
studies will fade away because
of that discipline's gains?
I don't think so. Historians
should be aware of and incorporate
the insights of literature or an
thropology or what have you into
their research, but that doesn't
mean that you get rid of those
departments.
Interdisciplinary feminist studies
does something different and gen
erates new ideas and analyses be
cause of all it does differently. You
can't let it go even if everybody
in history included women in what
they were doing.
That's an issue I've dealt with
in my research — that historically
it has been very important that
women maintain separate women's
institutions and separate feminist
institutions rather than believing
that, say, the vote in 1920 made
women equal and therefore they
no longer had to organize. Or that
the entry of women into the uni
versities or some of the professions
like law in large numbers in the
1970s or '80s means we don't have
to raise feminist questions in those
places any more.
We know historically that when
you stop organizing, when you stop
asking the critical questions about
gender, the gains you've made dis
appear. You go back to square one.
Enrollment in feminist studies
courses at Stanford has increased
dramatically in the last few years.
Why do you think that's hap
pened?
Structurally, in the early years
of the program, there was a lot
of turnover of faculty. We had
visiting professors teaching some
of the core courses. Visitors tend
not to build a following.
About five years ago, the deci
sion was made to really put our
energy into getting our regular fac

ulty to take over core courses.
Also, more of us were getting ten
ure at that point, so that we would
be here in an ongoing way.
The enrollment builds from
those changes in our core courses.
And in our other electivcs —
we've been building a reputation
with courses that haven't existed
before.
Also, feminist scholarship na
tionally has been in the avant
garde in history, literature and an
thropology. A lot of the excite
ment in these fields is in areas of
feminism. There's a lot of intel
lectual excitement.

Feminist scholar
ship asks, what
difference does
gender make? It
asks it of every
thing. It doesn't
just ask, how do
women live?

And the children of feminists
have come of age. We're getting
students in our classes that have
grown up their entire lives during
this era of the rebirth of feminism.
Some take it for granted. Some
come in and say, "My mom's a
feminist and that's why I'm here."
There's this first generation of
young women who were raised
their entire lives with some choices
about what their options are, but
who really have come against an
experience — whether it's sexual
harassment or rape or sexism in
the classroom or the Supreme
Court abortion decision — that
makes them say, "Wait a minute,
am I going to be able to have
what I've been promised?"
Do you see women and men
who espouse feminist positions,
who say, "I'm not a feminist, but
. ."?
The majority of Stanford stu
dents will not identify themselves
as feminists but, when push comes
to shove, realize they espouse
feminist positions. That's one of
the things I learned in teaching
Feminist Studies 101.

Docs that frustrate you?
When I went to college, 1 called
myself a conservative, sometimes
a liberal. I didn't know what 1 was
until I understood political theory
and history a little bit.
So it doesn't disturb me when
someone comes into my class and
says "I'm not a feminist." Just so
they have their minds open to the
issues, I'm not so worried about
the terminology.
"Feminist" is a scary word to
many people. Was there a con
scious decision to call the pro
gram "feminist studies" rather
than "women's studies"?
It was a conscious decision.
There were two reasons for it.
One was that "women's studies"
made the subject matter and the
personnel seem female. What we
wanted to do is not just about
women. It wasn't the "add women
and stir" approach — let's add a
woman's book or let's look at a
woman too.
The program is about gender,
power, gender hierarchy and social
change. Feminist scholarship asks,
what difference does gender make?
It asks it of everything. It doesn't
just ask, how do women live? It
addresses the entire social system,
or the entire body of literature,
and asks how gender is organizing
it.
That's how we can understand
the position of women, not just
by asking, what did women do?
We weren't just talking about
women in philosophy, women in
history, women in literature —
feminist scholarship had emerged
that was asking critical questions
of the disciplines across the board.
What about the "gender
studies focus house" rather than
the "feminist studies focus
house." Are those equivalent
terms?
That was a Res Ed decision. I
can't second guess them — but I
will.
People arc so afraid of the word
feminism. The fear that it raises
is that it's about a political move
ment and not about scholarship.
Our administration is still under
the misconception that to say that
you're feminist means that you arc
a political activist as opposed to

a scholar. In fact, what we're doing
is feminist scholarship, an intel
lectual enterprise that indeed
relates to a women's movement
— but is scholarship.
Why should Res Ed be afraid
of the word? There is a fear that
students won't sign up for some
thing called "feminist" because it
will label them as being radical.
Our students arc very afraid of
that label. Look how tainted the
term liberalism was in the last
election. Feminism in America is
largely about liberalism, not
radicalism.
Most students, and I'm afraid
many administrators, think that
feminism is about revolution and
radicalism. There certainly is
revolutionary, radical feminism.
But one of the things that anybody
who takes feminist studies classes
realizes very quickly is that their
preconceptions arc wrong — there
are so many forms of feminism
that it's really a multiplicity of
politics and approaches.
What are the dynamics be
tween people who are doing ac
ademic feminist studies and
people who are out doing move
ment feminism? Is there much
contact and interchange?
At places like Stanford and
other elite research universities,
most of us are not deeply con
nected with the women's political
movement. In the state univer
sities and state colleges, there's
more of a connection with the
communities, partly because there
are more activist and adult stu
dents.
The National Women's' Studies
Association tries to bridge that
gap by bringing in community ac
tivists as well as scholars. But at
places like Stanford, most of us
relate more to our professional or
ganizations than to the interdis
ciplinary women's studies
movement.
I'm saying that critically. I think
that we should be more in touch
with the women's movement than
we are, but we get so wrapped up
in doing our own scholarship,
working within the feminist
studies program at Stanford,
keeping up with campus politics,
that there's not a lot left for the
world out there.
Now, having said that, there
arc places where we do intersect.


Elizabeth Howton — Daily
Estelle Freedman In front of her house In the Noe Valley neighborhood of San Francisco.
One way that I do is within the
feminist legal movement. I con
sulted on different feminist law
cases. I suspect other people have
as weli. There's a very strong
feminist legal movement out there.
The part of the movement that's
working for legal change has a lot
of ties with academia. We're using
some of the same knowledge and
arc concerned about some of the
same questions. I suspect that in
the wake of the Webster decision
there may be even more commu
nity activism.
What's your impression of the
feminist student groups at Stan
ford?
We're in a good cycle right now.
There were periods in the '70s
where there were huge women's
week activities with lots of
workshops and speakers and con
certs, and then there were periods
when hardly anything happened.
It feels to me that there are a
lot of organizations right now con
cerned with women students. The
Women's Center, the Graduate
Women's Network, the Rape Ed
ucation Project, Students Against
Sexism, the Women's Self-defense
Collective, the Pro-choice Alli
ance, Women Concerned About
Eating Disorders — these arc just
people who come into my office
regularly.
I would also mention the men's
group and the men's journal that
was done this year — that's a
first. There had been men's groups
before that, but I don't think
there's ever been a publication,

There are a lot of people who respect
feminist scholarship ... and think of
themselves as fairly enlightened — and
do not change their courses one bit...
They still remain resistant to picking up
those one or two books over the sum
mer that might help them have an in
sight ... Or they feel that the one book
they added 10 years ago will still do it,
even if it's completely outdated. That
dismays me.

and that's really exciting.
I don't know what else is out
there, but it's a very exciting time
for students. There are so many
personally relevant issues for
young men and women right now,
whether its about sex issues or
race issues or careers or eating or
what have you, and it's wonderful
to.see people thinking together
and working together and organ
izing while you're in a state of life
where there actually is a critical
mass of like-minded people to
share that with. It feels like a very
exciting time both to be taking
feminist studies and to be involved
in feminist issues at Stanford.
What is the academic climate
right now at Stanford for feminist
scholars. 7 Is it a good place to
be doing women's history and
feminist studies?
It's good in the sense that there
arc a lot of people in different
departments who are interested in
feminist scholarship.
At the beginning you were hun
ting for every book that came out
and now there's so much you can't
possibly keep up with even your
subfield. It's very exciting that
there are people out there in other
disciplines who you can talk to.
My sense is there's more respect
for feminist scholarship within the
departments and administration
than there was five years ago, 10
years ago, but that there are still
pockets of ignorance or resistance.
For example, there are a lot of
people who respect feminist schol
arship and love that some of us

arc doing it, and think of them
selves as fairly enlightened — and
do not change their courses one
bit to reflect our scholarship.
They still remain resistant to
picking up those one or two books
over the summer that might help
them have an insight or give them
a new assignment. Or they feel
that the one book they added 10
years ago will still do it, even if
it's completely outdated. That dis
mays me.
I'm happy to give guest lectures
every now and then in people's
courses, but what I like best is
when they say, "What can I read
to do it myself?" and then they
do it. I love seeing some of my
younger colleagues do that — col
leagues who are not necessarily in
feminist scholarship but who
seriously want to keep up with
the best and latest literature and
incorporate it into their scholar
ship and teaching.
There arc a lot of people who
don't do that. That's a shame. I've
had so many reports about classes,
so many reports from students who
have been disappointed. There are
too many to mention.
There's also been an effort at
Stanford to push harder at making
the connections between gender,
race, class and ethnicity. That's
very exciting right now. I hope
that those students and faculty
who have been so wonderfully in
novative in calling for curriculum
revision in terms of race, ethnicity
and culture, take equally seriously
the integration of gender differ
ence with these others. It's up to
feminist studies faculty to do the
same in their courses in terms of
race, ethnicity and class.
Do you feel like the feminist
movement nationally has over
come its white, middle-class,
elitist bias?
It's always so hard to say what
is the feminist movement.
A lot of legal stuff deals with
working women's issues, so in
terms of class, yes, a lot of the
lawyers arc middle class, but the
issues they're dealing with really
affect blue-collar workers.
There's a grassroots women's
movement that's worked in rape
crisis centers and battered wom
en's centers. There's a whole cul
tural movement of writing and
theater and arts, where I think
there has been a lot of soul-

Historically it has been very important
that women maintain separate women's
institutions and separate feminist insti
tutions ... When you stop organizing,
when you stop asking the critical ques
tions about gender, the gains you've
made disappear. You go back to square
one.

searching over issues of race and
class over the last decade.
It doesn't make it all better, but
at least there's a consciousness
that there's a problem. I think
there's also been a lot of really
healthy independent organizing of
Asian-American women or black
women or Chicanas. It's really nec
essary to keep those issues alive.
So, do I think there's no racism
in the women's movement? I can't
say that. Do I think there's more
consciousness of that racism? Yes.
A lot of that is because women
of color have forced the issue and
made us more conscious of it.
I think the women's movement
may be a few steps ahead of the
society as a whole, but it certainly
has a long way to go.
There are several proposals to
make an undergraduate feminist
studies distribution requirement.
Do you feel like that's needed?
Yes. I think that some kind of
requirement or menu of require
ments that would ensure that stu
dents took some course that was
at least 50 percent concerned
about issues of gender would be
a good thing.
In response to the criticism that
is sometimes made that we don't
have a faculty to do it — the way
you get the faculty to do it is to
make the requirement. Faculty will
then have the incentive, in order
to make the DR., to bring that
little bit extra in. In hiring, we
might actually then value people
who care about gender rather than
devaluing it, as is too often the
case.
What should Stanford be doing
to improve the situation of
women faculty, and of feminist
faculty? Is it an attitudinal prob
lem or is it a pipeline problem?

I don't think you can call it a
pipeline problem anymore. Maybe
in some areas you can, but in the
humanities there are a lot of
women getting Ph.D.s.
The problem is partly at
titudinal. If someone has a disser
tation on a topic related to women
or gender, they think, well, we
already have somebody or that's
all they do. They're not good
enough. Those subjects are not
valued.
There's also a problem of
recruitment, because Stanford
doesn't have the greatest reputa
tion in terms of promoting women
to tenure. I have known a lot of
women who have turned Stanford
down when they were offered jobs
at different levels — junior faculty
afraid of what will happen, even
some senior people who have been
lured elsewhere in part because
they felt that Stanford would not
be the most congenial place for
them to be.
Is that reputation deserved?
In the past, yes.
We've been going through a
transition in the last few years. I
feel more honest about recruiting
people here now — "Come here,
it's a better place to be" — rather
than feeling dishonest, as in, "We
need you to make it a better
place."
How things go in the next cou
ple of years really could make a
big difference. I've seen, at, some
other universities, a kind of critical
moment when the feminist com
munity changes from being a mar
ginal out-group to getting a critical
mass of respected scholars and be
coming really one of the major
forces on campus.
We may be moving toward that.
There are a lot of possibilities in
the next year or two.
Feminist studies at Stanford is
an up-and-coming program. More
students than ever, both women
and men, are discovering courses
like U.S. Women's History, Intro

addresses the entire social system,
or the entire body of literature,
and asks how gender is organizing
it.
That's how we can understand
the position of women, not just
by asking, what did women do?
We weren't just talking about
women in philosophy, women in
history, women in literature —
feminist scholarship had emerged
that was asking critical questions
of the disciplines across the board.
What about the "gender
studies focus house" rather than
the "feminist studies focus
house." Are those equivalent
terms?
That was a Res Ed decision. I
can't second guess them — but I
will.
People arc so afraid of the word
feminism. The fear that it raises
is that it's about a political move
ment and not about scholarship.
Our administration is still under
the misconception that to say that
you're feminist means that you arc
a political activist as opposed to

a scholar. In fact, what we're doing
is feminist scholarship, an intel
lectual enterprise that indeed
relates to a women's movement
— but is scholarship.
Why should Res Ed be afraid
of the word? There is a fear that
students won't sign up for some
thing called "feminist" because it
will label them as being radical.
Our students arc very afraid of
that label. Look how tainted the
term liberalism was in the last
election. Feminism in America is
largely about liberalism, not
radicalism.
Most students, and I'm afraid
many administrators, think that
feminism is about revolution and
radicalism. There certainly is
revolutionary, radical feminism.
But one of the things that anybody
who takes feminist studies classes
realizes very quickly is that their
preconceptions arc wrong — there
are so many forms of feminism
that it's really a multiplicity of
politics and approaches.
What are the dynamics be
tween people who are doing ac
ademic feminist studies and
people who are out doing move
ment feminism? Is there much
contact and interchange?
At places like Stanford and
other elite research universities,
most of us are not deeply con
nected with the women's political
movement. In the state univer
sities and state colleges, there's
more of a connection with the
communities, partly because there
are more activist and adult stu
dents.
The National Women's' Studies
Association tries to bridge that
gap by bringing in community ac
tivists as well as scholars. But at
places like Stanford, most of us
relate more to our professional or
ganizations than to the interdis
ciplinary women's studies
movement.
I'm saying that critically. I think
that we should be more in touch
with the women's movement than
we are, but we get so wrapped up
in doing our own scholarship,
working within the feminist
studies program at Stanford,
keeping up with campus politics,
that there's not a lot left for the
world out there.
Now, having said that, there
arc places where we do intersect.


Elizabeth Howton — Daily
Estelle Freedman In front of her house In the Noe Valley neighborhood of San Francisco.
One way that I do is within the
feminist legal movement. I con
sulted on different feminist law
cases. I suspect other people have
as weli. There's a very strong
feminist legal movement out there.
The part of the movement that's
working for legal change has a lot
of ties with academia. We're using
some of the same knowledge and
arc concerned about some of the
same questions. I suspect that in
the wake of the Webster decision
there may be even more commu
nity activism.
What's your impression of the
feminist student groups at Stan
ford?
We're in a good cycle right now.
There were periods in the '70s
where there were huge women's
week activities with lots of
workshops and speakers and con
certs, and then there were periods
when hardly anything happened.
It feels to me that there are a
lot of organizations right now con
cerned with women students. The
Women's Center, the Graduate
Women's Network, the Rape Ed
ucation Project, Students Against
Sexism, the Women's Self-defense
Collective, the Pro-choice Alli
ance, Women Concerned About
Eating Disorders — these arc just
people who come into my office
regularly.
I would also mention the men's
group and the men's journal that
was done this year — that's a
first. There had been men's groups
before that, but I don't think
there's ever been a publication,

There are a lot of people who respect
feminist scholarship ... and think of
themselves as fairly enlightened — and
do not change their courses one bit...
They still remain resistant to picking up
those one or two books over the sum
mer that might help them have an in
sight ... Or they feel that the one book
they added 10 years ago will still do it,
even if it's completely outdated. That
dismays me.

and that's really exciting.
I don't know what else is out
there, but it's a very exciting time
for students. There are so many
personally relevant issues for
young men and women right now,
whether its about sex issues or
race issues or careers or eating or
what have you, and it's wonderful
to.see people thinking together
and working together and organ
izing while you're in a state of life
where there actually is a critical
mass of like-minded people to
share that with. It feels like a very
exciting time both to be taking
feminist studies and to be involved
in feminist issues at Stanford.
What is the academic climate
right now at Stanford for feminist
scholars. 7 Is it a good place to
be doing women's history and
feminist studies?
It's good in the sense that there
arc a lot of people in different
departments who are interested in
feminist scholarship.
At the beginning you were hun
ting for every book that came out
and now there's so much you can't
possibly keep up with even your
subfield. It's very exciting that
there are people out there in other
disciplines who you can talk to.
My sense is there's more respect
for feminist scholarship within the
departments and administration
than there was five years ago, 10
years ago, but that there are still
pockets of ignorance or resistance.
For example, there are a lot of
people who respect feminist schol
arship and love that some of us

arc doing it, and think of them
selves as fairly enlightened — and
do not change their courses one
bit to reflect our scholarship.
They still remain resistant to
picking up those one or two books
over the summer that might help
them have an insight or give them
a new assignment. Or they feel
that the one book they added 10
years ago will still do it, even if
it's completely outdated. That dis
mays me.
I'm happy to give guest lectures
every now and then in people's
courses, but what I like best is
when they say, "What can I read
to do it myself?" and then they
do it. I love seeing some of my
younger colleagues do that — col
leagues who are not necessarily in
feminist scholarship but who
seriously want to keep up with
the best and latest literature and
incorporate it into their scholar
ship and teaching.
There arc a lot of people who
don't do that. That's a shame. I've
had so many reports about classes,
so many reports from students who
have been disappointed. There are
too many to mention.
There's also been an effort at
Stanford to push harder at making
the connections between gender,
race, class and ethnicity. That's
very exciting right now. I hope
that those students and faculty
who have been so wonderfully in
novative in calling for curriculum
revision in terms of race, ethnicity
and culture, take equally seriously
the integration of gender differ
ence with these others. It's up to
feminist studies faculty to do the
same in their courses in terms of
race, ethnicity and class.
Do you feel like the feminist
movement nationally has over
come its white, middle-class,
elitist bias?
It's always so hard to say what
is the feminist movement.
A lot of legal stuff deals with
working women's issues, so in
terms of class, yes, a lot of the
lawyers arc middle class, but the
issues they're dealing with really
affect blue-collar workers.
There's a grassroots women's
movement that's worked in rape
crisis centers and battered wom
en's centers. There's a whole cul
tural movement of writing and
theater and arts, where I think
there has been a lot of soul-

Historically it has been very important
that women maintain separate women's
institutions and separate feminist insti
tutions ... When you stop organizing,
when you stop asking the critical ques
tions about gender, the gains you've
made disappear. You go back to square
one.

searching over issues of race and
class over the last decade.
It doesn't make it all better, but
at least there's a consciousness
that there's a problem. I think
there's also been a lot of really
healthy independent organizing of
Asian-American women or black
women or Chicanas. It's really nec
essary to keep those issues alive.
So, do I think there's no racism
in the women's movement? I can't
say that. Do I think there's more
consciousness of that racism? Yes.
A lot of that is because women
of color have forced the issue and
made us more conscious of it.
I think the women's movement
may be a few steps ahead of the
society as a whole, but it certainly
has a long way to go.
There are several proposals to
make an undergraduate feminist
studies distribution requirement.
Do you feel like that's needed?
Yes. I think that some kind of
requirement or menu of require
ments that would ensure that stu
dents took some course that was
at least 50 percent concerned
about issues of gender would be
a good thing.
In response to the criticism that
is sometimes made that we don't
have a faculty to do it — the way
you get the faculty to do it is to
make the requirement. Faculty will
then have the incentive, in order
to make the DR., to bring that
little bit extra in. In hiring, we
might actually then value people
who care about gender rather than
devaluing it, as is too often the
case.
What should Stanford be doing
to improve the situation of
women faculty, and of feminist
faculty? Is it an attitudinal prob
lem or is it a pipeline problem?

I don't think you can call it a
pipeline problem anymore. Maybe
in some areas you can, but in the
humanities there are a lot of
women getting Ph.D.s.
The problem is partly at
titudinal. If someone has a disser
tation on a topic related to women
or gender, they think, well, we
already have somebody or that's
all they do. They're not good
enough. Those subjects are not
valued.
There's also a problem of
recruitment, because Stanford
doesn't have the greatest reputa
tion in terms of promoting women
to tenure. I have known a lot of
women who have turned Stanford
down when they were offered jobs
at different levels — junior faculty
afraid of what will happen, even
some senior people who have been
lured elsewhere in part because
they felt that Stanford would not
be the most congenial place for
them to be.
Is that reputation deserved?
In the past, yes.
We've been going through a
transition in the last few years. I
feel more honest about recruiting
people here now — "Come here,
it's a better place to be" — rather
than feeling dishonest, as in, "We
need you to make it a better
place."
How things go in the next cou
ple of years really could make a
big difference. I've seen, at, some
other universities, a kind of critical
moment when the feminist com
munity changes from being a mar
ginal out-group to getting a critical
mass of respected scholars and be
coming really one of the major
forces on campus.
We may be moving toward that.
There are a lot of possibilities in
the next year or two.
Feminist studies at Stanford is
an up-and-coming program. More
students than ever, both women
and men, are discovering courses
like U.S. Women's History, Intro
duction to Feminist Studies, and
History of Sexuality in America
— and so more of them are coming
into contact with History Prof.
Estelle Freedman.
When they ask a question in
class, her students are used to her
saying, "What do you think?" or
"Be specific!" Her expectations of
students are high.
Yet she is tremendously well
liked and in demand as an adviser.
She won the Dinkelspiel Award
for Outstanding Service to Under
graduate Education in 1981 and
the Dean's Award for Distin
guished Teaching in 1978.
She graduated from Barnard
College in 1969 and got her
master's and doctorate at Colum
bia in 1972 and 1976. Her most
recent book is "Intimate Matters:
A History of Sexuality in
America," coauthored with John
D'Emilio; she has written or edited
three other books and over 15
articles on feminism, women's his
tory and the history of sexuality.
She was a founder of the
Feminist Studies Program, serving
as co-chair in its first year, 1980-
81, and chair in 1984-85. She has
recently been promoted to full pro
fessor, effective Sept. 1.
How did you first become in
terested in feminist scholarship
and women's history?
1 think going to college in the
late '60s made me ripe for becom
ing a historian of women in the
'70s. I went to school as part of
that generation that very much
opened up to new ideas and to
criticizing the established hierar
chies of order and power.
Also, I went to a women's col
lege — I went to Barnard in New
York. Half of my professors were
women, and several of them were
strong feminists. For instance, for
English I had Catherine Stimpson,
who went on to found the journal
Signs, and who was sharing an
office with Kate Millett. And I
had a wonderful professor of his
tory named Annette Baxter who
was doing women's history in the
'60s before it was generally being
done.
I was at Columbia during the
student strike, when students took
over the buildings at Columbia ...
when the police busted the stu
dents. It really shook up all of my
views of the university.
I was not one of the students
who occupied buildings, but I was
one of the people who defended
the students in the wake of the
police attacks, and I was appalled
by the University's failure to ne
gotiate and by their need to rely
on force — excessive force. It was
a complete breakdown of all the
values that the university was sup
posed to stand for.
It made it more interesting to
go into academics at that moment,
this time in which our generation
was going to change things.
So there was this general back
drop of protest — of criticizing
the university's role in war re
search and as a slumlord — while
I was at this women's college,
which was not like that. Our fac
ulty and administration were very
supportive of the students. When
we said, "We're big girls now —
we don't want parietals any more,"
they said, "Yes, that's true, let's

talk about it."
The context of protest and com
ing of age within it, the reemer
gence of feminism and the
experience in a patriarchal insti
tution like Columbia in contrast
to a women's college, made me
want to do scholarship, in this
case history, that helped to ex
plain, how did it get this way?
That's the question that made
me want to do social history —
how did it get this way? Why are
race relations this way, why are
the cities in the state they're in,
why are women having to start
this battle again when they had
been struggling for so long? History
seemed to be a way to ask those
questions and to be able to answer
them.
The interdisciplinary feminist
scholarship came a few years later,
really after graduate school, when
I started teaching and getting to
know people in other departments
who had gone through the same
process in literature or sociology
or anthropology, and began put
ting together women's studies
committees.
Do you feel like your work in
feminist studies is ultimately
aimed at making feminist studies
unnecessary — to make it inte
grated into the curriculum gen
erally, so that every class is taught
with women in mind?
I do want every class to be
taught with consciousness of
women and gender, but I don't
think that makes feminist schol
arship unnecessary.
So you don't think that the
separate discipline called feminist
studies will fade away because
of that discipline's gains?
I don't think so. Historians
should be aware of and incorporate
the insights of literature or an
thropology or what have you into
their research, but that doesn't
mean that you get rid of those
departments.
Interdisciplinary feminist studies
does something different and gen
erates new ideas and analyses be
cause of all it does differently. You
can't let it go even if everybody
in history included women in what
they were doing.
That's an issue I've dealt with
in my research — that historically
it has been very important that
women maintain separate women's
institutions and separate feminist
institutions rather than believing
that, say, the vote in 1920 made
women equal and therefore they
no longer had to organize. Or that
the entry of women into the uni
versities or some of the professions
like law in large numbers in the
1970s or '80s means we don't have
to raise feminist questions in those
places any more.
We know historically that when
you stop organizing, when you stop
asking the critical questions about
gender, the gains you've made dis
appear. You go back to square one.
Enrollment in feminist studies
courses at Stanford has increased
dramatically in the last few years.
Why do you think that's hap
pened?
Structurally, in the early years
of the program, there was a lot
of turnover of faculty. We had
visiting professors teaching some
of the core courses. Visitors tend
not to build a following.
About five years ago, the deci
sion was made to really put our
energy into getting our regular fac

ulty to take over core courses.
Also, more of us were getting ten
ure at that point, so that we would
be here in an ongoing way.
The enrollment builds from
those changes in our core courses.
And in our other electivcs —
we've been building a reputation
with courses that haven't existed
before.
Also, feminist scholarship na
tionally has been in the avant
garde in history, literature and an
thropology. A lot of the excite
ment in these fields is in areas of
feminism. There's a lot of intel
lectual excitement.

Feminist scholar
ship asks, what
difference does
gender make? It
asks it of every
thing. It doesn't
just ask, how do
women live?

And the children of feminists
have come of age. We're getting
students in our classes that have
grown up their entire lives during
this era of the rebirth of feminism.
Some take it for granted. Some
come in and say, "My mom's a
feminist and that's why I'm here."
There's this first generation of
young women who were raised
their entire lives with some choices
about what their options are, but
who really have come against an
experience — whether it's sexual
harassment or rape or sexism in
the classroom or the Supreme
Court abortion decision — that
makes them say, "Wait a minute,
am I going to be able to have
what I've been promised?"
Do you see women and men
who espouse feminist positions,
who say, "I'm not a feminist, but
. ."?
The majority of Stanford stu
dents will not identify themselves
as feminists but, when push comes
to shove, realize they espouse
feminist positions. That's one of
the things I learned in teaching
Feminist Studies 101.

Docs that frustrate you?
When I went to college, 1 called
myself a conservative, sometimes
a liberal. I didn't know what 1 was
until I understood political theory
and history a little bit.
So it doesn't disturb me when
someone comes into my class and
says "I'm not a feminist." Just so
they have their minds open to the
issues, I'm not so worried about
the terminology.
"Feminist" is a scary word to
many people. Was there a con
scious decision to call the pro
gram "feminist studies" rather
than "women's studies"?
It was a conscious decision.
There were two reasons for it.
One was that "women's studies"
made the subject matter and the
personnel seem female. What we
wanted to do is not just about
women. It wasn't the "add women
and stir" approach — let's add a
woman's book or let's look at a
woman too.
The program is about gender,
power, gender hierarchy and social
change. Feminist scholarship asks,
what difference does gender make?
It asks it of everything. It doesn't
just ask, how do women live? It
addresses the entire social system,
or the entire body of literature,
and asks how gender is organizing
it.
That's how we can understand
the position of women, not just
by asking, what did women do?
We weren't just talking about
women in philosophy, women in
history, women in literature —
feminist scholarship had emerged
that was asking critical questions
of the disciplines across the board.
What about the "gender
studies focus house" rather than
the "feminist studies focus
house." Are those equivalent
terms?
That was a Res Ed decision. I
can't second guess them — but I
will.
People arc so afraid of the word

is that it's about a political move
ment and not about scholarship.

thing called "feminist" because it
will label them as being radical.
Our students arc very afraid of
that label. Look how tainted the

largely about liberalism, not
radicalism.
Most students, and I'm afraid
many administrators, think that
feminism is about revolution and

made us more conscious of it.
I think the women's movement
may be a few steps ahead of the
society as a whole, but it certainly
has a long way to go.
There are several proposals to
make an undergraduate feminist
studies distribution requirement.
Do you feel like that's needed?
Yes. I think that some kind of
requirement or menu of require
ments that would ensure that stu
dents took some course that was
at least 50 percent concerned
about issues of gender would be
a good thing.
In response to the criticism that
is sometimes made that we don't
have a faculty to do it — the way
you get the faculty to do it is to
make the requirement. Faculty will
then have the incentive, in order
to make the DR., to bring that
little bit extra in. In hiring, we
might actually then value people
who care about gender rather than
devaluing it, as is too often the
case.
What should Stanford be doing
to improve the situation of
women faculty, and of feminist
faculty? Is it an attitudinal prob
lem or is it a pipeline problem?

I don't think you can call it a
pipeline problem anymore. Maybe
in some areas you can, but in the
humanities there are a lot of
women getting Ph.D.s.
The problem is partly at
titudinal. If someone has a disser
tation on a topic related to women
or gender, they think, well, we
already have somebody or that's
all they do. They're not good
enough. Those subjects are not
valued.
There's also a problem of
recruitment, because Stanford
doesn't have the greatest reputa
tion in terms of promoting women
to tenure. I have known a lot of
women who have turned Stanford
down when they were offered jobs
at different levels — junior faculty
afraid of what will happen, even
some senior people who have been
lured elsewhere in part because
they felt that Stanford would not
be the most congenial place for
them to be.
Is that reputation deserved?
In the past, yes.
We've been going through a
transition in the last few years. I
feel more honest about recruiting
people here now — "Come here,
it's a better place to be" — rather
than feeling dishonest, as in, "We
need you to make it a better
place."
How things go in the next cou
ple of years really could make a
big difference. I've seen, at, some
other universities, a kind of critical
moment when the feminist com
munity changes from being a mar
ginal out-group to getting a critical
mass of respected scholars and be
coming really one of the major
forces on campus.
We may be moving toward that.
There are a lot of possibilities in
the next year or two.
Feminist studies at Stanford is
an up-and-coming program. More
students than ever, both women
and men, are discovering courses
like U.S. Women's History, Intro
duction to Feminist Studies, and
History of Sexuality in America
— and so more of them are coming
into contact with History Prof.
Estelle Freedman.
When they ask a question in
class, her students are used to her
saying, "What do you think?" or
"Be specific!" Her expectations of
students are high.
Yet she is tremendously well
liked and in demand as an adviser.
She won the Dinkelspiel Award
for Outstanding Service to Under
graduate Education in 1981 and
the Dean's Award for Distin
guished Teaching in 1978.
She graduated from Barnard
College in 1969 and got her
master's and doctorate at Colum
bia in 1972 and 1976. Her most
recent book is "Intimate Matters:
A History of Sexuality in
America," coauthored with John
D'Emilio; she has written or edited
three other books and over 15
articles on feminism, women's his
tory and the history of sexuality.
She was a founder of the
Feminist Studies Program, serving
as co-chair in its first year, 1980-
81, and chair in 1984-85. She has
recently been promoted to full pro
fessor, effective Sept. 1.
How did you first become in
terested in feminist scholarship
and women's history?
1 think going to college in the
late '60s made me ripe for becom
ing a historian of women in the
'70s. I went to school as part of
that generation that very much
opened up to new ideas and to
criticizing the established hierar
chies of order and power.
Also, I went to a women's col
lege — I went to Barnard in New
York. Half of my professors were
women, and several of them were
strong feminists. For instance, for
English I had Catherine Stimpson,
who went on to found the journal
Signs, and who was sharing an
office with Kate Millett. And I
had a wonderful professor of his
tory named Annette Baxter who
was doing women's history in the
'60s before it was generally being
done.
I was at Columbia during the
student strike, when students took
over the buildings at Columbia ...
when the police busted the stu
dents. It really shook up all of my
views of the university.
I was not one of the students
who occupied buildings, but I was
one of the people who defended
the students in the wake of the
police attacks, and I was appalled
by the University's failure to ne
gotiate and by their need to rely
on force — excessive force. It was
a complete breakdown of all the
values that the university was sup
posed to stand for.
It made it more interesting to
go into academics at that moment,
this time in which our generation
was going to change things.
So there was this general back
drop of protest — of criticizing
the university's role in war re
search and as a slumlord — while
I was at this women's college,
which was not like that. Our fac
ulty and administration were very
supportive of the students. When
we said, "We're big girls now —
we don't want parietals any more,"
they said, "Yes, that's true, let's

talk about it."
The context of protest and com
ing of age within it, the reemer
gence of feminism and the
experience in a patriarchal insti
tution like Columbia in contrast
to a women's college, made me
want to do scholarship, in this
case history, that helped to ex
plain, how did it get this way?
That's the question that made
me want to do social history —
how did it get this way? Why are
race relations this way, why are
the cities in the state they're in,
why are women having to start
this battle again when they had
been struggling for so long? History
seemed to be a way to ask those
questions and to be able to answer
them.
The interdisciplinary feminist
scholarship came a few years later,
really after graduate school, when
I started teaching and getting to
know people in other departments
who had gone through the same
process in literature or sociology
or anthropology, and began put
ting together women's studies
committees.
Do you feel like your work in
feminist studies is ultimately
aimed at making feminist studies
unnecessary — to make it inte
grated into the curriculum gen
erally, so that every class is taught
with women in mind?
I do want every class to be
taught with consciousness of
women and gender, but I don't
think that makes feminist schol
arship unnecessary.
So you don't think that the
separate discipline called feminist
studies will fade away because
of that discipline's gains?
I don't think so. Historians
should be aware of and incorporate
the insights of literature or an
thropology or what have you into
their research, but that doesn't
mean that you get rid of those
departments.
Interdisciplinary feminist studies
does something different and gen
erates new ideas and analyses be
cause of all it does differently. You
can't let it go even if everybody
in history included women in what
they were doing.
That's an issue I've dealt with
in my research — that historically
it has been very important that
women maintain separate women's
institutions and separate feminist
institutions rather than believing
that, say, the vote in 1920 made
women equal and therefore they
no longer had to organize. Or that
the entry of women into the uni
versities or some of the professions
like law in large numbers in the
1970s or '80s means we don't have
to raise feminist questions in those
places any more.
We know historically that when
you stop organizing, when you stop
asking the critical questions about
gender, the gains you've made dis
appear. You go back to square one.
Enrollment in feminist studies
courses at Stanford has increased
dramatically in the last few years.
Why do you think that's hap
pened?
Structurally, in the early years
of the program, there was a lot
of turnover of faculty. We had
visiting professors teaching some
of the core courses. Visitors tend
not to build a following.
About five years ago, the deci
sion was made to really put our
energy into getting our regular fac

ulty to take over core courses.
Also, more of us were getting ten
ure at that point, so that we would
be here in an ongoing way.
The enrollment builds from
those changes in our core courses.
And in our other electivcs —
we've been building a reputation
with courses that haven't existed
before.
Also, feminist scholarship na
tionally has been in the avant
garde in history, literature and an
thropology. A lot of the excite
ment in these fields is in areas of
feminism. There's a lot of intel
lectual excitement.

Feminist scholar
ship asks, what
difference does
gender make? It
asks it of every
thing. It doesn't
just ask, how do
women live?

And the children of feminists
have come of age. We're getting
students in our classes that have
grown up their entire lives during
this era of the rebirth of feminism.
Some take it for granted. Some
come in and say, "My mom's a
feminist and that's why I'm here."
There's this first generation of
young women who were raised
their entire lives with some choices
about what their options are, but
who really have come against an
experience — whether it's sexual
harassment or rape or sexism in
the classroom or the Supreme
Court abortion decision — that
makes them say, "Wait a minute,
am I going to be able to have
what I've been promised?"
Do you see women and men
who espouse feminist positions,
who say, "I'm not a feminist, but
. ."?
The majority of Stanford stu
dents will not identify themselves
as feminists but, when push comes
to shove, realize they espouse
feminist positions. That's one of
the things I learned in teaching
Feminist Studies 101.

Docs that frustrate you?
When I went to college, 1 called
myself a conservative, sometimes
a liberal. I didn't know what 1 was
until I understood political theory
and history a little bit.
So it doesn't disturb me when
someone comes into my class and
says "I'm not a feminist." Just so
they have their minds open to the
issues, I'm not so worried about
the terminology.
"Feminist" is a scary word to
many people. Was there a con
scious decision to call the pro
gram "feminist studies" rather
than "women's studies"?
It was a conscious decision.
There were two reasons for it.
One was that "women's studies"
made the subject matter and the
personnel seem female. What we
wanted to do is not just about
women. It wasn't the "add women
and stir" approach — let's add a
woman's book or let's look at a
woman too.
The program is about gender,
power, gender hierarchy and social
change. Feminist scholarship asks,
what difference does gender make?
It asks it of everything. It doesn't
just ask, how do women live? It
addresses the entire social system,
or the entire body of literature,
and asks how gender is organizing
it.
That's how we can understand
the position of women, not just
by asking, what did women do?
We weren't just talking about
women in philosophy, women in
history, women in literature —
feminist scholarship had emerged
that was asking critical questions
of the disciplines across the board.
What about the "gender
studies focus house" rather than
the "feminist studies focus
house." Are those equivalent
terms?
That was a Res Ed decision. I
can't second guess them — but I
will.
People arc so afraid of the word
feminism. The fear that it raises
is that it's about a political move
ment and not about scholarship.
Our administration is still under
the misconception that to say that
you're feminist means that you arc
a political activist as opposed to

a scholar. In fact, what we're doing
is feminist scholarship, an intel
lectual enterprise that indeed
relates to a women's movement
— but is scholarship.
Why should Res Ed be afraid
of the word? There is a fear that
students won't sign up for some
thing called "feminist" because it
will label them as being radical.
Our students arc very afraid of
that label. Look how tainted the
term liberalism was in the last
election. Feminism in America is
largely about liberalism, not
radicalism.
Most students, and I'm afraid
many administrators, think that
feminism is about revolution and
radicalism. There certainly is
revolutionary, radical feminism.
But one of the things that anybody
who takes feminist studies classes
realizes very quickly is that their
preconceptions arc wrong — there
are so many forms of feminism
that it's really a multiplicity of
politics and approaches.
What are the dynamics be
tween people who are doing ac
ademic feminist studies and
people who are out doing move
ment feminism? Is there much
contact and interchange?
At places like Stanford and
other elite research universities,
most of us are not deeply con
nected with the women's political
movement. In the state univer
sities and state colleges, there's
more of a connection with the
communities, partly because there
are more activist and adult stu
dents.
The National Women's' Studies
Association tries to bridge that
gap by bringing in community ac
tivists as well as scholars. But at
places like Stanford, most of us
relate more to our professional or
ganizations than to the interdis
ciplinary women's studies
movement.
I'm saying that critically. I think
that we should be more in touch
with the women's movement than
we are, but we get so wrapped up
in doing our own scholarship,
working within the feminist
studies program at Stanford,
keeping up with campus politics,
that there's not a lot left for the
world out there.
Now, having said that, there
arc places where we do intersect.


Elizabeth Howton — Daily
Estelle Freedman In front of her house In the Noe Valley neighborhood of San Francisco.
One way that I do is within the
feminist legal movement. I con
sulted on different feminist law
cases. I suspect other people have
as weli. There's a very strong
feminist legal movement out there.
The part of the movement that's
working for legal change has a lot
of ties with academia. We're using
some of the same knowledge and
arc concerned about some of the
same questions. I suspect that in
the wake of the Webster decision
there may be even more commu
nity activism.
What's your impression of the
feminist student groups at Stan
ford?
We're in a good cycle right now.
There were periods in the '70s
where there were huge women's
week activities with lots of
workshops and speakers and con
certs, and then there were periods
when hardly anything happened.
It feels to me that there are a
lot of organizations right now con
cerned with women students. The
Women's Center, the Graduate
Women's Network, the Rape Ed
ucation Project, Students Against
Sexism, the Women's Self-defense
Collective, the Pro-choice Alli
ance, Women Concerned About
Eating Disorders — these arc just
people who come into my office
regularly.
I would also mention the men's
group and the men's journal that
was done this year — that's a
first. There had been men's groups
before that, but I don't think
there's ever been a publication,

There are a lot of people who respect
feminist scholarship ... and think of
themselves as fairly enlightened — and
do not change their courses one bit...
They still remain resistant to picking up
those one or two books over the sum
mer that might help them have an in
sight ... Or they feel that the one book
they added 10 years ago will still do it,
even if it's completely outdated. That
dismays me.

and that's really exciting.
I don't know what else is out
there, but it's a very exciting time
for students. There are so many
personally relevant issues for
young men and women right now,
whether its about sex issues or
race issues or careers or eating or
what have you, and it's wonderful
to.see people thinking together
and working together and organ
izing while you're in a state of life
where there actually is a critical
mass of like-minded people to
share that with. It feels like a very
exciting time both to be taking
feminist studies and to be involved
in feminist issues at Stanford.
What is the academic climate
right now at Stanford for feminist
scholars. 7 Is it a good place to
be doing women's history and
feminist studies?
It's good in the sense that there
arc a lot of people in different
departments who are interested in
feminist scholarship.
At the beginning you were hun
ting for every book that came out
and now there's so much you can't
possibly keep up with even your
subfield. It's very exciting that
there are people out there in other
disciplines who you can talk to.
My sense is there's more respect
for feminist scholarship within the
departments and administration
than there was five years ago, 10
years ago, but that there are still
pockets of ignorance or resistance.
For example, there are a lot of
people who respect feminist schol
arship and love that some of us

arc doing it, and think of them
selves as fairly enlightened — and
do not change their courses one
bit to reflect our scholarship.
They still remain resistant to
picking up those one or two books
over the summer that might help
them have an insight or give them
a new assignment. Or they feel
that the one book they added 10
years ago will still do it, even if
it's completely outdated. That dis
mays me.
I'm happy to give guest lectures
every now and then in people's
courses, but what I like best is
when they say, "What can I read
to do it myself?" and then they
do it. I love seeing some of my
younger colleagues do that — col
leagues who are not necessarily in
feminist scholarship but who
seriously want to keep up with
the best and latest literature and
incorporate it into their scholar
ship and teaching.
There arc a lot of people who
don't do that. That's a shame. I've
had so many reports about classes,
so many reports from students who
have been disappointed. There are
too many to mention.
There's also been an effort at
Stanford to push harder at making
the connections between gender,
race, class and ethnicity. That's
very exciting right now. I hope
that those students and faculty
who have been so wonderfully in
novative in calling for curriculum
revision in terms of race, ethnicity
and culture, take equally seriously
the integration of gender differ
ence with these others. It's up to
feminist studies faculty to do the
same in their courses in terms of
race, ethnicity and class.
Do you feel like the feminist
movement nationally has over
come its white, middle-class,
elitist bias?
It's always so hard to say what
is the feminist movement.
A lot of legal stuff deals with
working women's issues, so in
terms of class, yes, a lot of the
lawyers arc middle class, but the
issues they're dealing with really
affect blue-collar workers.
There's a grassroots women's
movement that's worked in rape
crisis centers and battered wom
en's centers. There's a whole cul
tural movement of writing and
theater and arts, where I think
there has been a lot of soul-

Historically it has been very important
that women maintain separate women's
institutions and separate feminist insti
tutions ... When you stop organizing,
when you stop asking the critical ques
tions about gender, the gains you've
made disappear. You go back to square
one.

searching over issues of race and
class over the last decade.
It doesn't make it all better, but
at least there's a consciousness
that there's a problem. I think
there's also been a lot of really
healthy independent organizing of
Asian-American women or black
women or Chicanas. It's really nec
essary to keep those issues alive.
So, do I think there's no racism
in the women's movement? I can't
say that. Do I think there's more
consciousness of that racism? Yes.
A lot of that is because women
of color have forced the issue and
made us more conscious of it.
I think the women's movement
may be a few steps ahead of the
society as a whole, but it certainly
has a long way to go.

we've been building a reputation
with courses that haven't existed
before.
Also, feminist scholarship na
tionally has been in the avant
garde in history, literature and an
thropology. A lot of the excite
ment in these fields is in areas of
feminism. There's a lot of intel
lectual excitement.

Feminist scholar
ship asks, what
difference does
gender make? It
asks it of every
thing. It doesn't
just ask, how do
women live?

And the children of feminists
have come of age. We're getting
students in our classes that have
grown up their entire lives during
this era of the rebirth of feminism.
Some take it for granted. Some
come in and say, "My mom's a
feminist and that's why I'm here."
There's this first generation of
young women who were raised
their entire lives with some choices
about what their options are, but
who really have come against an
experience — whether it's sexual
harassment or rape or sexism in
the classroom or the Supreme
Court abortion decision — that
makes them say, "Wait a minute,
am I going to be able to have
what I've been promised?"
Do you see women and men
who espouse feminist positions,
who say, "I'm not a feminist, but
. ."?
The majority of Stanford stu
dents will not identify themselves
as feminists but, when push comes
to shove, realize they espouse
feminist positions. That's one of
the things I learned in teaching
Feminist Studies 101.

Docs that frustrate you?
When I went to college, 1 called
myself a conservative, sometimes
a liberal. I didn't know what 1 was
until I understood political theory
and history a little bit.
So it doesn't disturb me when
someone comes into my class and
says "I'm not a feminist." Just so
they have their minds open to the
issues, I'm not so worried about
the terminology.
"Feminist" is a scary word to
many people. Was there a con
scious decision to call the pro
gram "feminist studies" rather
than "women's studies"?
It was a conscious decision.
There were two reasons for it.
One was that "women's studies"
made the subject matter and the
personnel seem female. What we
wanted to do is not just about
women. It wasn't the "add women
and stir" approach — let's add a
woman's book or let's look at a
woman too.
The program is about gender,
power, gender hierarchy and social
change. Feminist scholarship asks,
what difference does gender make?
It asks it of everything. It doesn't
just ask, how do women live? It
addresses the entire social system,
or the entire body of literature,
and asks how gender is organizing
it.
That's how we can understand
the position of women, not just
by asking, what did women do?
We weren't just talking about
women in philosophy, women in
history, women in literature —
feminist scholarship had emerged
that was asking critical questions
of the disciplines across the board.
What about the "gender
studies focus house" rather than
the "feminist studies focus
house." Are those equivalent
terms?
That was a Res Ed decision. I
can't second guess them — but I
will.
People arc so afraid of the word
feminism. The fear that it raises
is that it's about a political move
ment and not about scholarship.
Our administration is still under
the misconception that to say that
you're feminist means that you arc
a political activist as opposed to

a scholar. In fact, what we're doing
is feminist scholarship, an intel
lectual enterprise that indeed
relates to a women's movement
— but is scholarship.
Why should Res Ed be afraid
of the word? There is a fear that
students won't sign up for some
thing called "feminist" because it
will label them as being radical.
Our students arc very afraid of
that label. Look how tainted the
term liberalism was in the last
election. Feminism in America is
largely about liberalism, not
radicalism.
Most students, and I'm afraid
many administrators, think that
feminism is about revolution and
radicalism. There certainly is
revolutionary, radical feminism.
But one of the things that anybody
who takes feminist studies classes
realizes very quickly is that their
preconceptions arc wrong — there
are so many forms of feminism
that it's really a multiplicity of
politics and approaches.
What are the dynamics be
tween people who are doing ac
ademic feminist studies and
people who are out doing move
ment feminism? Is there much
contact and interchange?
At places like Stanford and
other elite research universities,
most of us are not deeply con
nected with the women's political
movement. In the state univer
sities and state colleges, there's
more of a connection with the
communities, partly because there
are more activist and adult stu
dents.
The National Women's' Studies
Association tries to bridge that
gap by bringing in community ac
tivists as well as scholars. But at
places like Stanford, most of us
relate more to our professional or
ganizations than to the interdis
ciplinary women's studies
movement.
I'm saying that critically. I think
that we should be more in touch
with the women's movement than
we are, but we get so wrapped up
in doing our own scholarship,
working within the feminist
studies program at Stanford,
keeping up with campus politics,
that there's not a lot left for the
world out there.
Now, having said that, there
arc places where we do intersect.


Elizabeth Howton — Daily
Estelle Freedman In front of her house In the Noe Valley neighborhood of San Francisco.
One way that I do is within the
feminist legal movement. I con
sulted on different feminist law
cases. I suspect other people have
as weli. There's a very strong
feminist legal movement out there.
The part of the movement that's
working for legal change has a lot
of ties with academia. We're using
some of the same knowledge and
arc concerned about some of the
same questions. I suspect that in
the wake of the Webster decision
there may be even more commu
nity activism.
What's your impression of the
feminist student groups at Stan
ford?
We're in a good cycle right now.
There were periods in the '70s
where there were huge women's
week activities with lots of
workshops and speakers and con
certs, and then there were periods
when hardly anything happened.
It feels to me that there are a
lot of organizations right now con
cerned with women students. The
Women's Center, the Graduate
Women's Network, the Rape Ed
ucation Project, Students Against
Sexism, the Women's Self-defense
Collective, the Pro-choice Alli
ance, Women Concerned About
Eating Disorders — these arc just
people who come into my office
regularly.
I would also mention the men's
group and the men's journal that
was done this year — that's a
first. There had been men's groups
before that, but I don't think
there's ever been a publication,

There are a lot of people who respect
feminist scholarship ... and think of
themselves as fairly enlightened — and
do not change their courses one bit...
They still remain resistant to picking up
those one or two books over the sum
mer that might help them have an in
sight ... Or they feel that the one book
they added 10 years ago will still do it,
even if it's completely outdated. That
dismays me.

and that's really exciting.
I don't know what else is out
there, but it's a very exciting time
for students. There are so many
personally relevant issues for
young men and women right now,
whether its about sex issues or
race issues or careers or eating or
what have you, and it's wonderful
to.see people thinking together
and working together and organ
izing while you're in a state of life
where there actually is a critical
mass of like-minded people to
share that with. It feels like a very
exciting time both to be taking
feminist studies and to be involved
in feminist issues at Stanford.
What is the academic climate
right now at Stanford for feminist
scholars. 7 Is it a good place to
be doing women's history and
feminist studies?
It's good in the sense that there
arc a lot of people in different
departments who are interested in
feminist scholarship.
At the beginning you were hun
ting for every book that came out
and now there's so much you can't
possibly keep up with even your
subfield. It's very exciting that
there are people out there in other
disciplines who you can talk to.
My sense is there's more respect
for feminist scholarship within the
departments and administration
than there was five years ago, 10
years ago, but that there are still
pockets of ignorance or resistance.
For example, there are a lot of
people who respect feminist schol
arship and love that some of us

arc doing it, and think of them
selves as fairly enlightened — and
do not change their courses one
bit to reflect our scholarship.
They still remain resistant to
picking up those one or two books
over the summer that might help
them have an insight or give them
a new assignment. Or they feel
that the one book they added 10
years ago will still do it, even if
it's completely outdated. That dis
mays me.
I'm happy to give guest lectures
every now and then in people's
courses, but what I like best is
when they say, "What can I read
to do it myself?" and then they
do it. I love seeing some of my
younger colleagues do that — col
leagues who are not necessarily in
feminist scholarship but who
seriously want to keep up with
the best and latest literature and
incorporate it into their scholar
ship and teaching.
There arc a lot of people who
don't do that. That's a shame. I've
had so many reports about classes,
so many reports from students who
have been disappointed. There are
too many to mention.
There's also been an effort at
Stanford to push harder at making
the connections between gender,
race, class and ethnicity. That's
very exciting right now. I hope
that those students and faculty
who have been so wonderfully in
novative in calling for curriculum
revision in terms of race, ethnicity
and culture, take equally seriously
the integration of gender differ
ence with these others. It's up to
feminist studies faculty to do the
same in their courses in terms of
race, ethnicity and class.
Do you feel like the feminist
movement nationally has over
come its white, middle-class,
elitist bias?
It's always so hard to say what
is the feminist movement.
A lot of legal stuff deals with
working women's issues, so in
terms of class, yes, a lot of the
lawyers arc middle class, but the
issues they're dealing with really
affect blue-collar workers.
There's a grassroots women's
movement that's worked in rape
crisis centers and battered wom
en's centers. There's a whole cul
tural movement of writing and
theater and arts, where I think
there has been a lot of soul-

Historically it has been very important
that women maintain separate women's
institutions and separate feminist insti
tutions ... When you stop organizing,
when you stop asking the critical ques
tions about gender, the gains you've
made disappear. You go back to square
one.

searching over issues of race and
class over the last decade.
It doesn't make it all better, but
at least there's a consciousness
that there's a problem. I think
there's also been a lot of really
healthy independent organizing of
Asian-American women or black
women or Chicanas. It's really nec
essary to keep those issues alive.
So, do I think there's no racism
in the women's movement? I can't
say that. Do I think there's more
consciousness of that racism? Yes.
A lot of that is because women
of color have forced the issue and
made us more conscious of it.
I think the women's movement
may be a few steps ahead of the
society as a whole, but it certainly
has a long way to go.
There are several proposals to
make an undergraduate feminist
studies distribution requirement.
Do you feel like that's needed?
Yes. I think that some kind of
requirement or menu of require
ments that would ensure that stu
dents took some course that was
at least 50 percent concerned
about issues of gender would be
a good thing.
In response to the criticism that
is sometimes made that we don't
have a faculty to do it — the way
you get the faculty to do it is to
make the requirement. Faculty will
then have the incentive, in order
to make the DR., to bring that
little bit extra in. In hiring, we
might actually then value people
who care about gender rather than
devaluing it, as is too often the
case.
What should Stanford be doing
to improve the situation of
women faculty, and of feminist
faculty? Is it an attitudinal prob
lem or is it a pipeline problem?

I don't think you can call it a
pipeline problem anymore. Maybe
in some areas you can, but in the
humanities there are a lot of
women getting Ph.D.s.
The problem is partly at
titudinal. If someone has a disser
tation on a topic related to women
or gender, they think, well, we
already have somebody or that's
all they do. They're not good
enough. Those subjects are not
valued.
There's also a problem of
recruitment, because Stanford
doesn't have the greatest reputa
tion in terms of promoting women
to tenure. I have known a lot of
women who have turned Stanford
down when they were offered jobs
at different levels — junior faculty
afraid of what will happen, even
some senior people who have been
lured elsewhere in part because
they felt that Stanford would not
be the most congenial place for
them to be.
Is that reputation deserved?
In the past, yes.
We've been going through a
transition in the last few years. I
feel more honest about recruiting
people here now — "Come here,
it's a better place to be" — rather
than feeling dishonest, as in, "We
need you to make it a better
place."
How things go in the next cou
ple of years really could make a
big difference. I've seen, at, some
other universities, a kind of critical
moment when the feminist com
munity changes from being a mar
ginal out-group to getting a critical
mass of respected scholars and be
coming really one of the major
forces on campus.
We may be moving toward that.
There are a lot of possibilities in
the next year or two.
Feminist studies at Stanford is
an up-and-coming program. More
students than ever, both women
and men, are discovering courses
like U.S. Women's History, Intro
duction to Feminist Studies, and
History of Sexuality in America
— and so more of them are coming
into contact with History Prof.
Estelle Freedman.
When they ask a question in
class, her students are used to her
saying, "What do you think?" or
"Be specific!" Her expectations of
students are high.
Yet she is tremendously well
liked and in demand as an adviser.
She won the Dinkelspiel Award
for Outstanding Service to Under
graduate Education in 1981 and
the Dean's Award for Distin
guished Teaching in 1978.
She graduated from Barnard
College in 1969 and got her
master's and doctorate at Colum
bia in 1972 and 1976. Her most
recent book is "Intimate Matters:
A History of Sexuality in
America," coauthored with John
D'Emilio; she has written or edited
three other books and over 15
articles on feminism, women's his
tory and the history of sexuality.
She was a founder of the
Feminist Studies Program, serving
as co-chair in its first year, 1980-
81, and chair in 1984-85. She has
recently been promoted to full pro
fessor, effective Sept. 1.
How did you first become in
terested in feminist scholarship
and women's history?
1 think going to college in the
late '60s made me ripe for becom
ing a historian of women in the
'70s. I went to school as part of
that generation that very much
opened up to new ideas and to
criticizing the established hierar
chies of order and power.
Also, I went to a women's col
lege — I went to Barnard in New
York. Half of my professors were
women, and several of them were
strong feminists. For instance, for
English I had Catherine Stimpson,
who went on to found the journal
Signs, and who was sharing an
office with Kate Millett. And I
had a wonderful professor of his
tory named Annette Baxter who
was doing women's history in the
'60s before it was generally being
done.
I was at Columbia during the
student strike, when students took
over the buildings at Columbia ...
when the police busted the stu
dents. It really shook up all of my
views of the university.
I was not one of the students
who occupied buildings, but I was
one of the people who defended
the students in the wake of the
police attacks, and I was appalled
by the University's failure to ne
gotiate and by their need to rely
on force — excessive force. It was
a complete breakdown of all the
values that the university was sup
posed to stand for.
It made it more interesting to
go into academics at that moment,
this time in which our generation
was going to change things.
So there was this general back
drop of protest — of criticizing
the university's role in war re
search and as a slumlord — while
I was at this women's college,
which was not like that. Our fac
ulty and administration were very
supportive of the students. When
we said, "We're big girls now —
we don't want parietals any more,"
they said, "Yes, that's true, let's

talk about it."
The context of protest and com
ing of age within it, the reemer
gence of feminism and the
experience in a patriarchal insti
tution like Columbia in contrast
to a women's college, made me
want to do scholarship, in this
case history, that helped to ex
plain, how did it get this way?
That's the question that made
me want to do social history —
how did it get this way? Why are
race relations this way, why are
the cities in the state they're in,
why are women having to start
this battle again when they had
been struggling for so long? History
seemed to be a way to ask those
questions and to be able to answer
them.
The interdisciplinary feminist
scholarship came a few years later,
really after graduate school, when
I started teaching and getting to
know people in other departments
who had gone through the same
process in literature or sociology
or anthropology, and began put
ting together women's studies
committees.
Do you feel like your work in
feminist studies is ultimately
aimed at making feminist studies
unnecessary — to make it inte
grated into the curriculum gen
erally, so that every class is taught
with women in mind?
I do want every class to be
taught with consciousness of
women and gender, but I don't
think that makes feminist schol
arship unnecessary.
So you don't think that the
separate discipline called feminist
studies will fade away because
of that discipline's gains?
I don't think so. Historians
should be aware of and incorporate
the insights of literature or an
thropology or what have you into
their research, but that doesn't
mean that you get rid of those
departments.
Interdisciplinary feminist studies
does something different and gen
erates new ideas and analyses be
cause of all it does differently. You
can't let it go even if everybody
in history included women in what
they were doing.
That's an issue I've dealt with
in my research — that historically
it has been very important that
women maintain separate women's
institutions and separate feminist
institutions rather than believing
that, say, the vote in 1920 made
women equal and therefore they
no longer had to organize. Or that
the entry of women into the uni
versities or some of the professions
like law in large numbers in the
1970s or '80s means we don't have
to raise feminist questions in those
places any more.
We know historically that when
you stop organizing, when you stop
asking the critical questions about
gender, the gains you've made dis
appear. You go back to square one.
Enrollment in feminist studies
courses at Stanford has increased
dramatically in the last few years.
Why do you think that's hap
pened?
Structurally, in the early years
of the program, there was a lot
of turnover of faculty. We had
visiting professors teaching some
of the core courses. Visitors tend
not to build a following.
About five years ago, the deci
sion was made to really put our
energy into getting our regular fac

ulty to take over core courses.
Also, more of us were getting ten
ure at that point, so that we would
be here in an ongoing way.
The enrollment builds from
those changes in our core courses.
And in our other electivcs —
we've been building a reputation
with courses that haven't existed
before.
Also, feminist scholarship na
tionally has been in the avant
garde in history, literature and an
thropology. A lot of the excite
ment in these fields is in areas of
feminism. There's a lot of intel
lectual excitement.

mays me.
I'm happy to give guest lectures
every now and then in people's
courses, but what I like best is
when they say, "What can I read
to do it myself?" and then they
do it. I love seeing some of my
younger colleagues do that — col
leagues who are not necessarily in
feminist scholarship but who
seriously want to keep up with
the best and latest literature and
incorporate it into their scholar
ship and teaching.
There arc a lot of people who
don't do that. That's a shame. I've
had so many reports about classes,
so many reports from students who
have been disappointed. There are
too many to mention.
There's also been an effort at
Stanford to push harder at making
the connections between gender,
race, class and ethnicity. That's
very exciting right now. I hope
that those students and faculty
who have been so wonderfully in
novative in calling for curriculum
revision in terms of race, ethnicity
and culture, take equally seriously
the integration of gender differ
ence with these others. It's up to
feminist studies faculty to do the
same in their courses in terms of
race, ethnicity and class.
Do you feel like the feminist
movement nationally has over
come its white, middle-class,
elitist bias?
It's always so hard to say what
is the feminist movement.
A lot of legal stuff deals with
working women's issues, so in
terms of class, yes, a lot of the
lawyers arc middle class, but the
issues they're dealing with really
affect blue-collar workers.
There's a grassroots women's
movement that's worked in rape
crisis centers and battered wom
en's centers. There's a whole cul
tural movement of writing and
theater and arts, where I think
there has been a lot of soul-

Historically it has been very important
that women maintain separate women's
institutions and separate feminist insti
tutions ... When you stop organizing,
when you stop asking the critical ques
tions about gender, the gains you've
made disappear. You go back to square
one.

searching over issues of race and
class over the last decade.
It doesn't make it all better, but
at least there's a consciousness
that there's a problem. I think
there's also been a lot of really
healthy independent organizing of
Asian-American women or black
women or Chicanas. It's really nec
essary to keep those issues alive.
So, do I think there's no racism
in the women's movement? I can't
say that. Do I think there's more
consciousness of that racism? Yes.
A lot of that is because women
of color have forced the issue and
made us more conscious of it.
I think the women's movement
may be a few steps ahead of the
society as a whole, but it certainly
has a long way to go.
There are several proposals to
make an undergraduate feminist
studies distribution requirement.
Do you feel like that's needed?
Yes. I think that some kind of
requirement or menu of require
ments that would ensure that stu
dents took some course that was
at least 50 percent concerned
about issues of gender would be
a good thing.
In response to the criticism that
is sometimes made that we don't
have a faculty to do it — the way
you get the faculty to do it is to
make the requirement. Faculty will
then have the incentive, in order
to make the DR., to bring that
little bit extra in. In hiring, we
might actually then value people
who care about gender rather than
devaluing it, as is too often the
case.
What should Stanford be doing
to improve the situation of
women faculty, and of feminist
faculty? Is it an attitudinal prob
lem or is it a pipeline problem?

I don't think you can call it a
pipeline problem anymore. Maybe
in some areas you can, but in the
humanities there are a lot of
women getting Ph.D.s.
The problem is partly at
titudinal. If someone has a disser
tation on a topic related to women
or gender, they think, well, we
already have somebody or that's
all they do. They're not good
enough. Those subjects are not
valued.
There's also a problem of
recruitment, because Stanford
doesn't have the greatest reputa
tion in terms of promoting women
to tenure. I have known a lot of
women who have turned Stanford
down when they were offered jobs
at different levels — junior faculty
afraid of what will happen, even
some senior people who have been
lured elsewhere in part because
they felt that Stanford would not
be the most congenial place for
them to be.
Is that reputation deserved?
In the past, yes.
We've been going through a
transition in the last few years. I
feel more honest about recruiting
people here now — "Come here,
it's a better place to be" — rather
than feeling dishonest, as in, "We
need you to make it a better
place."
How things go in the next cou
ple of years really could make a
big difference. I've seen, at, some
other universities, a kind of critical
moment when the feminist com
munity changes from being a mar
ginal out-group to getting a critical
mass of respected scholars and be
coming really one of the major
forces on campus.
We may be moving toward that.
There are a lot of possibilities in
the next year or two.
Feminist studies at Stanford is
an up-and-coming program. More
students than ever, both women
and men, are discovering courses
like U.S. Women's History, Intro
duction to Feminist Studies, and
History of Sexuality in America
— and so more of them are coming
into contact with History Prof.
Estelle Freedman.
When they ask a question in
class, her students are used to her
saying, "What do you think?" or
"Be specific!" Her expectations of
students are high.
Yet she is tremendously well
liked and in demand as an adviser.
She won the Dinkelspiel Award
for Outstanding Service to Under
graduate Education in 1981 and
the Dean's Award for Distin
guished Teaching in 1978.
She graduated from Barnard
College in 1969 and got her
master's and doctorate at Colum
bia in 1972 and 1976. Her most
recent book is "Intimate Matters:
A History of Sexuality in
America," coauthored with John
D'Emilio; she has written or edited
three other books and over 15
articles on feminism, women's his
tory and the history of sexuality.
She was a founder of the
Feminist Studies Program, serving
as co-chair in its first year, 1980-
81, and chair in 1984-85. She has
recently been promoted to full pro
fessor, effective Sept. 1.
How did you first become in
terested in feminist scholarship
and women's history?
1 think going to college in the
late '60s made me ripe for becom
ing a historian of women in the
'70s. I went to school as part of
that generation that very much
opened up to new ideas and to
criticizing the established hierar
chies of order and power.
Also, I went to a women's col
lege — I went to Barnard in New
York. Half of my professors were
women, and several of them were
strong feminists. For instance, for
English I had Catherine Stimpson,
who went on to found the journal
Signs, and who was sharing an
office with Kate Millett. And I
had a wonderful professor of his
tory named Annette Baxter who
was doing women's history in the
'60s before it was generally being
done.
I was at Columbia during the
student strike, when students took
over the buildings at Columbia ...
when the police busted the stu
dents. It really shook up all of my
views of the university.
I was not one of the students
who occupied buildings, but I was
one of the people who defended
the students in the wake of the
police attacks, and I was appalled
by the University's failure to ne
gotiate and by their need to rely
on force — excessive force. It was
a complete breakdown of all the
values that the university was sup
posed to stand for.
It made it more interesting to
go into academics at that moment,
this time in which our generation
was going to change things.
So there was this general back
drop of protest — of criticizing
the university's role in war re
search and as a slumlord — while
I was at this women's college,
which was not like that. Our fac
ulty and administration were very
supportive of the students. When
we said, "We're big girls now —
we don't want parietals any more,"
they said, "Yes, that's true, let's

talk about it."
The context of protest and com
ing of age within it, the reemer
gence of feminism and the
experience in a patriarchal insti
tution like Columbia in contrast
to a women's college, made me
want to do scholarship, in this
case history, that helped to ex
plain, how did it get this way?
That's the question that made
me want to do social history —
how did it get this way? Why are
race relations this way, why are
the cities in the state they're in,
why are women having to start
this battle again when they had
been struggling for so long? History
seemed to be a way to ask those
questions and to be able to answer
them.
The interdisciplinary feminist
scholarship came a few years later,
really after graduate school, when
I started teaching and getting to
know people in other departments
who had gone through the same
process in literature or sociology
or anthropology, and began put
ting together women's studies
committees.
Do you feel like your work in
feminist studies is ultimately
aimed at making feminist studies
unnecessary — to make it inte
grated into the curriculum gen
erally, so that every class is taught
with women in mind?
I do want every class to be
taught with consciousness of
women and gender, but I don't
think that makes feminist schol
arship unnecessary.
So you don't think that the
separate discipline called feminist
studies will fade away because
of that discipline's gains?
I don't think so. Historians
should be aware of and incorporate
the insights of literature or an
thropology or what have you into
their research, but that doesn't
mean that you get rid of those
departments.
Interdisciplinary feminist studies
does something different and gen
erates new ideas and analyses be
cause of all it does differently. You
can't let it go even if everybody
in history included women in what
they were doing.
That's an issue I've dealt with
in my research — that historically
it has been very important that
women maintain separate women's
institutions and separate feminist
institutions rather than believing
that, say, the vote in 1920 made
women equal and therefore they
no longer had to organize. Or that
the entry of women into the uni
versities or some of the professions
like law in large numbers in the
1970s or '80s means we don't have
to raise feminist questions in those
places any more.
We know historically that when
you stop organizing, when you stop
asking the critical questions about
gender, the gains you've made dis
appear. You go back to square one.
Enrollment in feminist studies
courses at Stanford has increased
dramatically in the last few years.
Why do you think that's hap
pened?
Structurally, in the early years
of the program, there was a lot
of turnover of faculty. We had
visiting professors teaching some
of the core courses. Visitors tend
not to build a following.
About five years ago, the deci
sion was made to really put our
energy into getting our regular fac

ulty to take over core courses.
Also, more of us were getting ten
ure at that point, so that we would
be here in an ongoing way.
The enrollment builds from
those changes in our core courses.
And in our other electivcs —
we've been building a reputation
with courses that haven't existed
before.
Also, feminist scholarship na
tionally has been in the avant
garde in history, literature and an
thropology. A lot of the excite
ment in these fields is in areas of
feminism. There's a lot of intel
lectual excitement.

Feminist scholar
ship asks, what
difference does
gender make? It
asks it of every
thing. It doesn't
just ask, how do
women live?

And the children of feminists
have come of age. We're getting
students in our classes that have
grown up their entire lives during
this era of the rebirth of feminism.
Some take it for granted. Some
come in and say, "My mom's a
feminist and that's why I'm here."
There's this first generation of
young women who were raised
their entire lives with some choices
about what their options are, but
who really have come against an
experience — whether it's sexual
harassment or rape or sexism in
the classroom or the Supreme
Court abortion decision — that
makes them say, "Wait a minute,
am I going to be able to have
what I've been promised?"
Do you see women and men
who espouse feminist positions,
who say, "I'm not a feminist, but
. ."?
The majority of Stanford stu
dents will not identify themselves
as feminists but, when push comes
to shove, realize they espouse
feminist positions. That's one of
the things I learned in teaching
Feminist Studies 101.

Docs that frustrate you?
When I went to college, 1 called
myself a conservative, sometimes
a liberal. I didn't know what 1 was
until I understood political theory
and history a little bit.
So it doesn't disturb me when
someone comes into my class and
says "I'm not a feminist." Just so
they have their minds open to the
issues, I'm not so worried about
the terminology.
"Feminist" is a scary word to
many people. Was there a con
scious decision to call the pro
gram "feminist studies" rather
than "women's studies"?
It was a conscious decision.
There were two reasons for it.
One was that "women's studies"
made the subject matter and the
personnel seem female. What we
wanted to do is not just about
women. It wasn't the "add women
and stir" approach — let's add a
woman's book or let's look at a
woman too.
The program is about gender,
power, gender hierarchy and social
change. Feminist scholarship asks,
what difference does gender make?
It asks it of everything. It doesn't
just ask, how do women live? It
addresses the entire social system,
or the entire body of literature,
and asks how gender is organizing
it.
That's how we can understand
the position of women, not just
by asking, what did women do?
We weren't just talking about
women in philosophy, women in
history, women in literature —
feminist scholarship had emerged
that was asking critical questions
of the disciplines across the board.
What about the "gender
studies focus house" rather than
the "feminist studies focus
house." Are those equivalent
terms?
That was a Res Ed decision. I
can't second guess them — but I
will.
People arc so afraid of the word
feminism. The fear that it raises
is that it's about a political move
ment and not about scholarship.
Our administration is still under
the misconception that to say that
you're feminist means that you arc
a political activist as opposed to

a scholar. In fact, what we're doing
is feminist scholarship, an intel
lectual enterprise that indeed
relates to a women's movement
— but is scholarship.
Why should Res Ed be afraid
of the word? There is a fear that
students won't sign up for some
thing called "feminist" because it
will label them as being radical.
Our students arc very afraid of
that label. Look how tainted the
term liberalism was in the last
election. Feminism in America is
largely about liberalism, not
radicalism.
Most students, and I'm afraid
many administrators, think that
feminism is about revolution and
radicalism. There certainly is
revolutionary, radical feminism.
But one of the things that anybody
who takes feminist studies classes
realizes very quickly is that their
preconceptions arc wrong — there
are so many forms of feminism
that it's really a multiplicity of
politics and approaches.
What are the dynamics be
tween people who are doing ac
ademic feminist studies and
people who are out doing move
ment feminism? Is there much
contact and interchange?
At places like Stanford and
other elite research universities,
most of us are not deeply con
nected with the women's political
movement. In the state univer
sities and state colleges, there's
more of a connection with the
communities, partly because there
are more activist and adult stu
dents.
The National Women's' Studies
Association tries to bridge that
gap by bringing in community ac
tivists as well as scholars. But at
places like Stanford, most of us
relate more to our professional or
ganizations than to the interdis
ciplinary women's studies
movement.
I'm saying that critically. I think
that we should be more in touch
with the women's movement than
we are, but we get so wrapped up
in doing our own scholarship,
working within the feminist
studies program at Stanford,
keeping up with campus politics,
that there's not a lot left for the
world out there.
Now, having said that, there
arc places where we do intersect.


Elizabeth Howton — Daily
Estelle Freedman In front of her house In the Noe Valley neighborhood of San Francisco.
One way that I do is within the
feminist legal movement. I con
sulted on different feminist law
cases. I suspect other people have
as weli. There's a very strong
feminist legal movement out there.
The part of the movement that's
working for legal change has a lot
of ties with academia. We're using
some of the same knowledge and
arc concerned about some of the
same questions. I suspect that in
the wake of the Webster decision
there may be even more commu
nity activism.
What's your impression of the
feminist student groups at Stan
ford?
We're in a good cycle right now.
There were periods in the '70s
where there were huge women's
week activities with lots of
workshops and speakers and con
certs, and then there were periods
when hardly anything happened.
It feels to me that there are a
lot of organizations right now con
cerned with women students. The
Women's Center, the Graduate
Women's Network, the Rape Ed
ucation Project, Students Against
Sexism, the Women's Self-defense
Collective, the Pro-choice Alli
ance, Women Concerned About
Eating Disorders — these arc just
people who come into my office
regularly.
I would also mention the men's
group and the men's journal that
was done this year — that's a
first. There had been men's groups
before that, but I don't think
there's ever been a publication,

There are a lot of people who respect
feminist scholarship ... and think of
themselves as fairly enlightened — and
do not change their courses one bit...
They still remain resistant to picking up
those one or two books over the sum
mer that might help them have an in
sight ... Or they feel that the one book
they added 10 years ago will still do it,
even if it's completely outdated. That
dismays me.

and that's really exciting.
I don't know what else is out
there, but it's a very exciting time
for students. There are so many
personally relevant issues for
young men and women right now,
whether its about sex issues or
race issues or careers or eating or
what have you, and it's wonderful
to.see people thinking together
and working together and organ
izing while you're in a state of life
where there actually is a critical
mass of like-minded people to
share that with. It feels like a very
exciting time both to be taking
feminist studies and to be involved
in feminist issues at Stanford.
What is the academic climate
right now at Stanford for feminist
scholars. 7 Is it a good place to
be doing women's history and
feminist studies?
It's good in the sense that there
arc a lot of people in different
departments who are interested in
feminist scholarship.
At the beginning you were hun
ting for every book that came out
and now there's so much you can't
possibly keep up with even your
subfield. It's very exciting that
there are people out there in other
disciplines who you can talk to.
My sense is there's more respect
for feminist scholarship within the
departments and administration
than there was five years ago, 10
years ago, but that there are still
pockets of ignorance or resistance.
For example, there are a lot of
people who respect feminist schol
arship and love that some of us

arc doing it, and think of them
selves as fairly enlightened — and
do not change their courses one
bit to reflect our scholarship.
They still remain resistant to
picking up those one or two books
over the summer that might help
them have an insight or give them
a new assignment. Or they feel
that the one book they added 10
years ago will still do it, even if
it's completely outdated. That dis
mays me.
I'm happy to give guest lectures
every now and then in people's
courses, but what I like best is
when they say, "What can I read
to do it myself?" and then they
do it. I love seeing some of my
younger colleagues do that — col
leagues who are not necessarily in
feminist scholarship but who
seriously want to keep up with
the best and latest literature and
incorporate it into their scholar
ship and teaching.
There arc a lot of people who
don't do that. That's a shame. I've
had so many reports about classes,

too many to mention.

been struggling for so long? History
seemed to be a way to ask those
questions and to be able to answer
them.
The interdisciplinary feminist
scholarship came a few years later,
really after graduate school, when
I started teaching and getting to
know people in other departments
who had gone through the same
process in literature or sociology
or anthropology, and began put
ting together women's studies
committees.
Do you feel like your work in
feminist studies is ultimately
aimed at making feminist studies
unnecessary — to make it inte
grated into the curriculum gen
erally, so that every class is taught
with women in mind?
I do want every class to be
taught with consciousness of
women and gender, but I don't
think that makes feminist schol
arship unnecessary.
So you don't think that the
separate discipline called feminist
studies will fade away because
of that discipline's gains?
I don't think so. Historians
should be aware of and incorporate
the insights of literature or an
thropology or what have you into
their research, but that doesn't
mean that you get rid of those
departments.
Interdisciplinary feminist studies
does something different and gen
erates new ideas and analyses be
cause of all it does differently. You
can't let it go even if everybody
in history included women in what
they were doing.
That's an issue I've dealt with
in my research — that historically
it has been very important that
women maintain separate women's
institutions and separate feminist
institutions rather than believing
that, say, the vote in 1920 made
women equal and therefore they
no longer had to organize. Or that
the entry of women into the uni
versities or some of the professions
like law in large numbers in the
1970s or '80s means we don't have
to raise feminist questions in those
places any more.
We know historically that when
you stop organizing, when you stop
asking the critical questions about
gender, the gains you've made dis
appear. You go back to square one.
Enrollment in feminist studies
courses at Stanford has increased
dramatically in the last few years.
Why do you think that's hap
pened?
Structurally, in the early years
of the program, there was a lot
of turnover of faculty. We had
visiting professors teaching some
of the core courses. Visitors tend
not to build a following.
About five years ago, the deci
sion was made to really put our
energy into getting our regular fac

ulty to take over core courses.
Also, more of us were getting ten
ure at that point, so that we would
be here in an ongoing way.
The enrollment builds from
those changes in our core courses.
And in our other electivcs —
we've been building a reputation
with courses that haven't existed
before.
Also, feminist scholarship na
tionally has been in the avant
garde in history, literature and an
thropology. A lot of the excite
ment in these fields is in areas of
feminism. There's a lot of intel
lectual excitement.

Feminist scholar
ship asks, what
difference does
gender make? It
asks it of every
thing. It doesn't
just ask, how do
women live?

And the children of feminists
have come of age. We're getting
students in our classes that have
grown up their entire lives during
this era of the rebirth of feminism.
Some take it for granted. Some
come in and say, "My mom's a
feminist and that's why I'm here."
There's this first generation of
young women who were raised
their entire lives with some choices
about what their options are, but
who really have come against an
experience — whether it's sexual
harassment or rape or sexism in
the classroom or the Supreme
Court abortion decision — that
makes them say, "Wait a minute,
am I going to be able to have
what I've been promised?"
Do you see women and men
who espouse feminist positions,
who say, "I'm not a feminist, but
. ."?
The majority of Stanford stu
dents will not identify themselves
as feminists but, when push comes
to shove, realize they espouse
feminist positions. That's one of
the things I learned in teaching
Feminist Studies 101.

Docs that frustrate you?
When I went to college, 1 called
myself a conservative, sometimes
a liberal. I didn't know what 1 was
until I understood political theory
and history a little bit.
So it doesn't disturb me when
someone comes into my class and
says "I'm not a feminist." Just so
they have their minds open to the
issues, I'm not so worried about
the terminology.
"Feminist" is a scary word to
many people. Was there a con
scious decision to call the pro
gram "feminist studies" rather
than "women's studies"?
It was a conscious decision.
There were two reasons for it.
One was that "women's studies"
made the subject matter and the
personnel seem female. What we
wanted to do is not just about
women. It wasn't the "add women
and stir" approach — let's add a
woman's book or let's look at a
woman too.
The program is about gender,
power, gender hierarchy and social
change. Feminist scholarship asks,
what difference does gender make?
It asks it of everything. It doesn't
just ask, how do women live? It
addresses the entire social system,
or the entire body of literature,
and asks how gender is organizing
it.
That's how we can understand
the position of women, not just
by asking, what did women do?
We weren't just talking about
women in philosophy, women in
history, women in literature —
feminist scholarship had emerged
that was asking critical questions
of the disciplines across the board.
What about the "gender
studies focus house" rather than
the "feminist studies focus
house." Are those equivalent
terms?
That was a Res Ed decision. I
can't second guess them — but I
will.
People arc so afraid of the word
feminism. The fear that it raises
is that it's about a political move
ment and not about scholarship.
Our administration is still under
the misconception that to say that
you're feminist means that you arc
a political activist as opposed to

a scholar. In fact, what we're doing
is feminist scholarship, an intel
lectual enterprise that indeed
relates to a women's movement
— but is scholarship.
Why should Res Ed be afraid
of the word? There is a fear that
students won't sign up for some
thing called "feminist" because it
will label them as being radical.
Our students arc very afraid of
that label. Look how tainted the
term liberalism was in the last
election. Feminism in America is
largely about liberalism, not
radicalism.
Most students, and I'm afraid
many administrators, think that
feminism is about revolution and
radicalism. There certainly is
revolutionary, radical feminism.
But one of the things that anybody
who takes feminist studies classes
realizes very quickly is that their
preconceptions arc wrong — there
are so many forms of feminism
that it's really a multiplicity of
politics and approaches.
What are the dynamics be
tween people who are doing ac
ademic feminist studies and
people who are out doing move
ment feminism? Is there much
contact and interchange?
At places like Stanford and
other elite research universities,
most of us are not deeply con
nected with the women's political
movement. In the state univer
sities and state colleges, there's
more of a connection with the
communities, partly because there
are more activist and adult stu
dents.
The National Women's' Studies
Association tries to bridge that
gap by bringing in community ac
tivists as well as scholars. But at
places like Stanford, most of us
relate more to our professional or
ganizations than to the interdis
ciplinary women's studies
movement.
I'm saying that critically. I think
that we should be more in touch
with the women's movement than
we are, but we get so wrapped up
in doing our own scholarship,
working within the feminist
studies program at Stanford,
keeping up with campus politics,
that there's not a lot left for the
world out there.
Now, having said that, there
arc places where we do intersect.

One way that I do is within the
feminist legal movement. I con
sulted on different feminist law
cases. I suspect other people have
as weli. There's a very strong
feminist legal movement out there.
The part of the movement that's
working for legal change has a lot
of ties with academia. We're using
some of the same knowledge and
arc concerned about some of the
same questions. I suspect that in
the wake of the Webster decision
there may be even more commu
nity activism.
What's your impression of the
feminist student groups at Stan
ford?
We're in a good cycle right now.
There were periods in the '70s
where there were huge women's
week activities with lots of
workshops and speakers and con
certs, and then there were periods
when hardly anything happened.
It feels to me that there are a
lot of organizations right now con
cerned with women students. The
Women's Center, the Graduate
Women's Network, the Rape Ed
ucation Project, Students Against
Sexism, the Women's Self-defense
Collective, the Pro-choice Alli
ance, Women Concerned About
Eating Disorders — these arc just
people who come into my office
regularly.
I would also mention the men's
group and the men's journal that
was done this year — that's a
first. There had been men's groups
before that, but I don't think
there's ever been a publication,

There are a lot of people who respect
feminist scholarship ... and think of
themselves as fairly enlightened — and
do not change their courses one bit...
They still remain resistant to picking up
those one or two books over the sum
mer that might help them have an in
sight ... Or they feel that the one book
they added 10 years ago will still do it,
even if it's completely outdated. That
dismays me.

and that's really exciting.
I don't know what else is out
there, but it's a very exciting time
for students. There are so many
personally relevant issues for
young men and women right now,
whether its about sex issues or
race issues or careers or eating or
what have you, and it's wonderful
to.see people thinking together
and working together and organ
izing while you're in a state of life
where there actually is a critical
mass of like-minded people to
share that with. It feels like a very
exciting time both to be taking
feminist studies and to be involved
in feminist issues at Stanford.
What is the academic climate
right now at Stanford for feminist
scholars. 7 Is it a good place to
be doing women's history and
feminist studies?
It's good in the sense that there
arc a lot of people in different
departments who are interested in
feminist scholarship.
At the beginning you were hun
ting for every book that came out
and now there's so much you can't
possibly keep up with even your
subfield. It's very exciting that
there are people out there in other
disciplines who you can talk to.
My sense is there's more respect
for feminist scholarship within the
departments and administration
than there was five years ago, 10
years ago, but that there are still
pockets of ignorance or resistance.
For example, there are a lot of
people who respect feminist schol
arship and love that some of us

arc doing it, and think of them
selves as fairly enlightened — and
do not change their courses one
bit to reflect our scholarship.
They still remain resistant to
picking up those one or two books
over the summer that might help
them have an insight or give them
a new assignment. Or they feel
that the one book they added 10
years ago will still do it, even if
it's completely outdated. That dis
mays me.
I'm happy to give guest lectures
every now and then in people's
courses, but what I like best is
when they say, "What can I read
to do it myself?" and then they
do it. I love seeing some of my
younger colleagues do that — col
leagues who are not necessarily in
feminist scholarship but who
seriously want to keep up with
the best and latest literature and
incorporate it into their scholar
ship and teaching.
There arc a lot of people who
don't do that. That's a shame. I've
had so many reports about classes,
so many reports from students who
have been disappointed. There are
too many to mention.
There's also been an effort at
Stanford to push harder at making
the connections between gender,
race, class and ethnicity. That's
very exciting right now. I hope
that those students and faculty
who have been so wonderfully in
novative in calling for curriculum
revision in terms of race, ethnicity
and culture, take equally seriously
the integration of gender differ
ence with these others. It's up to
feminist studies faculty to do the
same in their courses in terms of
race, ethnicity and class.
Do you feel like the feminist
movement nationally has over
come its white, middle-class,
elitist bias?
It's always so hard to say what
is the feminist movement.
A lot of legal stuff deals with
working women's issues, so in
terms of class, yes, a lot of the
lawyers arc middle class, but the
issues they're dealing with really
affect blue-collar workers.
There's a grassroots women's
movement that's worked in rape
crisis centers and battered wom
en's centers. There's a whole cul
tural movement of writing and
theater and arts, where I think
there has been a lot of soul-

Historically it has been very important
that women maintain separate women's
institutions and separate feminist insti
tutions ... When you stop organizing,
when you stop asking the critical ques
tions about gender, the gains you've
made disappear. You go back to square
one.

searching over issues of race and
class over the last decade.
It doesn't make it all better, but
at least there's a consciousness
that there's a problem. I think
there's also been a lot of really
healthy independent organizing of
Asian-American women or black
women or Chicanas. It's really nec
essary to keep those issues alive.
So, do I think there's no racism
in the women's movement? I can't
say that. Do I think there's more
consciousness of that racism? Yes.
A lot of that is because women
of color have forced the issue and
made us more conscious of it.
I think the women's movement
may be a few steps ahead of the
society as a whole, but it certainly
has a long way to go.
There are several proposals to
make an undergraduate feminist
studies distribution requirement.
Do you feel like that's needed?
Yes. I think that some kind of
requirement or menu of require
ments that would ensure that stu
dents took some course that was
at least 50 percent concerned
about issues of gender would be
a good thing.
In response to the criticism that
is sometimes made that we don't
have a faculty to do it — the way
you get the faculty to do it is to
make the requirement. Faculty will
then have the incentive, in order
to make the DR., to bring that
little bit extra in. In hiring, we
might actually then value people
who care about gender rather than
devaluing it, as is too often the
case.
What should Stanford be doing
to improve the situation of
women faculty, and of feminist
faculty? Is it an attitudinal prob
lem or is it a pipeline problem?

I don't think you can call it a
pipeline problem anymore. Maybe
in some areas you can, but in the
humanities there are a lot of
women getting Ph.D.s.
The problem is partly at
titudinal. If someone has a disser
tation on a topic related to women
or gender, they think, well, we
already have somebody or that's
all they do. They're not good
enough. Those subjects are not
valued.
There's also a problem of
recruitment, because Stanford
doesn't have the greatest reputa
tion in terms of promoting women
to tenure. I have known a lot of
women who have turned Stanford
down when they were offered jobs
at different levels — junior faculty
afraid of what will happen, even
some senior people who have been
lured elsewhere in part because
they felt that Stanford would not
be the most congenial place for
them to be.
Is that reputation deserved?
In the past, yes.
We've been going through a
transition in the last few years. I
feel more honest about recruiting
people here now — "Come here,
it's a better place to be" — rather
than feeling dishonest, as in, "We
need you to make it a better
place."
How things go in the next cou
ple of years really could make a
big difference. I've seen, at, some
other universities, a kind of critical
moment when the feminist com
munity changes from being a mar
ginal out-group to getting a critical
mass of respected scholars and be
coming really one of the major
forces on campus.
We may be moving toward that.
There are a lot of possibilities in
the next year or two.
