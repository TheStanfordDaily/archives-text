## Scientists map the path of the human helix 
### Tanya Paull Editorial staff 
The project to map and sequence the
human genome — probably the most am
bitious scientific undertaking to date —
could become both a triumph of modern
technology and an organizational nightmare.
If it succeeds, medical science will be
revolutionized. When it will succeed, how
ever — 15, 30, maybe even 100 years from
now — no one can even guess.
The genome plan must first struggle
through mountains of red tape and inter
national bickering, not to mention the tug
of-war with Congress over budget approval.
The U.S. human genome project — soon
to be organized under the name of the
National Center for Human Genome Re
search — has proposed a budget of $100
million.
Some proponents are arguing for as much
as $200 million a year for the next 15
years. That would be at least $3 billion —
roughly a dollar for every base pair (the
smallest constituent molecules of DNA) —
in the genetic code.
Every living organism has its own genome,
the complete set of genes in each individual
cell. A "gene" is a segment of DNA —
the actual genetic material, measured in
base pairs, which forms a shape resembling
a spiral staircase.
The plan is to "sequence" the human
genome — to determine the identity and
location of every gene and protein in each
human chromosome.

Stanford Biochemistry Prof. Ronald
Davis, one of the speakers at the first human
genome conference to be held in San Diego
next month, says that the eventual goal of
the huge project is to "understand all of
the body's functions at the genetic bioc
hemical level."
The first long-term benefit, Davis
predicts, will be to understand the basis of
known genetic diseases like Tay-Sachs dis
ease and sickle-cell anemia. The eventual
goal is to understand all of the body's
failures, including cancer and heart disease,
and to treat these with specially designed
drugs. In Davis's view, medicine will some
day be able to provide therapy with designer
cures rather than searching for remedies by
trial and error.
Thinking of medical applications at this
point in the project, though, is like celebrat
ing a victory before the race has begun.
A national policy on human genome re
search is still in the making, funding has
not yet been confirmed, and the question
of whether an international organization
will be needed to supervise a global project
is still open to debate.
In addition, before the human genetic
code is tackled, scientists plan to practice
on simpler organisms. For example,
Arabidopsis — a type of weed — is one of
the smaller projects that is already under
way. The inconspicuous plant has 70,000
kilobase pairs in its genome, compared to
3 billion in a human, making it easier to
sequence. The project will also bring plant
geneticists in touch with the rest of the

genetics community.
James Watson, director of human genome
research at the National Institutes of
Health, proposed earlier this year that dif
ferent chromosomes be assigned to different
countries to prevent overlapping research.
Sharing 46 chromosomes between thou
sands of international scientists is as hard
as a box of candy between children, how
ever, as the dubious response to Watson's
proposal showed.
Davis feels that a comprehensive plan
made by scientists, not bureaucrats, is the
best way to go.
He is one of the foremost players in the
game of organizational strategy, helping to
plan the location of approximately 20
centers for human genome research that
will be located in scientific institutions
across the country. Stanford might not be

one of the sites, not because of lack of
interest, but lack of space. Several scientists
arc already doing related research here, in
cluding Davis.
Although the national initiative to map
and sequence the human genome was only
proposed four years ago, Davis had sugges
ted a similar project — a high-resolution
map of the human genome — to colleagues
nearly ten years ago. Unfortunately for sci
ence, his proposal was not received well
on the grounds th it it was too complicated,
costly and boring.
In 1989 the project is still complicated
and costly, but few would now call the
human genome project "boring." Practically
every country in the world would like to
have a part in what may be the most
exciting endeavor science has yet to embark
upon.
