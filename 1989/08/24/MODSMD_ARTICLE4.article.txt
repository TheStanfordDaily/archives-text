### Paula Gani Staff writer 
Chinese scholars from univer
sities across the nation partici
pated in a conference held behind
closed doors last weekend at Stan
ford.
The three-day event, entitled
"China's Reforms after June 4:
Retrospect and Prospect," gave 50
scholars an opportunity to reflect
upon China's political situation
within the last 10 years, according
to conference organizer Huang
Jing Sheng, a Stanford graduate
student in sociology.
The conference was the first of

a scries sponsored by the Inde
pendent Federation of Chinese
Students and Scholars in the
United States, which held its first
congress last July in Chicago. The
Association of Chinese Students
and Scholars at Stanford hosted
this weekend's event, along with
other sponsors.
"It is an academic discussion in
which we have limited attendance
in order to create an atmosphere
of reform brainstorming," said
Huang. "In addition, many schol
ars want [to remain anonymous]
to protect families back in China,"
he said. The conference was pri
marily closed to the public.

The conference began Friday
morning with keynote speaker Yan
Jiaqi, one of the four pro
democracy dissidents who fled
China after the Beijing massacre.
I lis address, in which he reiterated
his analysis on establishing a
federal government, was followed
by "an open, somewhat heated dis
cussion" between panelists and the
audience, according to visiting
scholar Li-Yan, another confer
ence organizer.
Wan Rennan, a leading dissident
voice from China's business com
munity, delivered an economic
analysis in which he drew parallels
between the solidarity movement

in Poland and China's current sit
uation. Stanford graduate student
Liu Yong-Chuan, the Independent
Federation's recently elected pres
ident, was also in attendance.
Other events during the week
end included panels on interna
tional relations, Hong Kong and
China, and various speakers. The
conference featured two seminars
in Chinese open to the public in
which panelists presented papers
and responded to questions.
A second academic conference
will take place in Washington,
D.C., in October. Said Jia-Hao,
head of the Independent Federa

tion's Theoretical Research Com
mittee, "(Through academic
conferences] we can hope to pro
mote the student movement here
... and help out in every way."
Conference organizers had no
information to offer on the rumor
that pro-democracy leader Wu'er
Kaixi was planning on attending
Stanford. According to Stanford
admissions officials, Wu'cr did not
apply here. Chinese-American
newspapers have recently claimed
that he has been accepted to and
will attend Harvard, but the Har
vard Registrar's Office said he has
not registered there.
