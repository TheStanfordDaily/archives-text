When they sing "Be true to your school," the
Beach Boys clearly do not have Stanford in mind.
The Southern California rock and roll hand was
scheduled to perform after the Stanford-Utah football
game Oct. 21 at Stanford Stadium, but the group
will do their surfing in another part of the USA
that weekend â€” Madison Square Garden.
According to Gary Bruner, assistant athletic di
rector in charge of marketing, a representative of
the Beach Boys confirmed the Stanford date without
realizing the group was scheduled tor the other site.
"We are looking into possibly having them at another
game," Bruner said.
The Cardinal has six home games this season,
including contests against Oregon, San Jose State,
Notre Dame and California. Stanford also hosts
UCLA Nov. 4, but the Beach Boys are playing at
a USC game that weekend.
Bruner said that all single-game ticket-holders tor
the Utah game will be contacted and while the
Athletic Department has not decided on its policy,
it is like'v the fans will be given the chance to
exchange their tickets for another game or to get
a refund.
