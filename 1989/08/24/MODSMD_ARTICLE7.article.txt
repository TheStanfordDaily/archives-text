Geology professor
strikes it rich
Prof. Jerry Harris, who just
arrived at Stanford a year ago,
has been awarded a major con
tract by the Gas Research In
stitute in Chicago that will pro
vide approximately $1 million
lor the first 15 months of the
project.
Harris is contracted to
develop a crosswell seismic
tomography system — currently
one of the most intriguing arcps
of geophysical research — in a
project that is expected to last
four to five years.
One of the objectives of the
project is to provide detailed
imaging, like a CAT scan, ot
areas just below the earth's
crust to a depth of a lew miles.
Such a device is crucial for
tracking and predicting the lo
cation of fluids (such .is oil,
gas or chemical contaminants)
in the earth's subsurface.
About 10 faculty members,
research assistants and graduate
students will be involved in the
project and two laboratories will
be dedicated.
In an independent develop
ment, the department of geo
physics was selected one ot
three winners of a $200,000
graphics workstation.

Forty-five schools competed
for the workstations, which are
provided by Landmark Graph
ics, a leading company in seis
mic interpretation. The Stan
ford Rock Physics group will
receive the workstation due to
a proposal initiated, written and
submitted by graduate student
Pierre Samec. The proposals for
the other two winning schools,
the Colorado School ot Mines
and Rice University, were
originated by faculty members.
With the addition ot the
workstation, Stanford has con
solidated its position as having
the best geophysics department
in the nation in the areas ot
computing and graphics. The
Landmark system will be in
stalled in the sub-basement of
the Mitchell Earth Sciences
Building before the end of the
month.
