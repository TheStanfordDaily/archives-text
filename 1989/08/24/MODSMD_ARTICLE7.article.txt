Geology professor
strikes it rich
Prof. Jerry Harris, who just
arrived at Stanford a year ago,
has been awarded a major con
tract by the Gas Research In
stitute in Chicago that will pro
vide approximately $1 million
lor the first 15 months of the
project.
Harris is contracted to
develop a crosswell seismic
tomography system — currently
one of the most intriguing arcps
of geophysical research — in a
project that is expected to last
four to five years.
One of the objectives of the
project is to provide detailed
imaging, like a CAT scan, ot
areas just below the earth's
crust to a depth of a lew miles.
Such a device is crucial for
tracking and predicting the lo
cation of fluids (such .is oil,
gas or chemical contaminants)
in the earth's subsurface.
About 10 faculty members,
research assistants and graduate
students will be involved in the
project and two laboratories will
be dedicated.
In an independent develop
ment, the department of geo
physics was selected one ot
three winners of a $200,000
graphics workstation.

Forty-five schools competed
for the workstations, which are
provided by Landmark Graph
ics, a leading company in seis
mic interpretation. The Stan
ford Rock Physics group will
receive the workstation due to
a proposal initiated, written and
submitted by graduate student
Pierre Samec. The proposals for
the other two winning schools,
the Colorado School ot Mines
and Rice University, were
originated by faculty members.
With the addition ot the
workstation, Stanford has con
solidated its position as having
the best geophysics department
in the nation in the areas ot
computing and graphics. The
Landmark system will be in
stalled in the sub-basement of
the Mitchell Earth Sciences
Building before the end of the
month.
Graduate student
picked for grant
Brian Wansink, a student in
the Graduate School ot Busi
ness was named one ot five
national winners ot the Alden
G. Clayton Doctoral Disserta
tion Proposal Competition. I he
award, which is sponsored by
the Marketing Science Institute of
Cambridge, Mass., carries a prize
of $2,500.
Wansink, a doctoral student
here, studied how advertising can
encourage consumers 'o uoe more
of a product by finding different
uses for it.
Brands that dominate a specific
market often find it more advan
tageous to increase consumption
within their market share than to

increase their percentage share of
consumers.
An strategy called extension ad
vertising encourages the consump
tion of such products in different
situations, such as the orange juice
campaign stating, "It's not just for
breakfast anymore."
Wansink determined that com
mercials showing different uses for
a product have the greatest effect
in increasing consumption, but
that if the use is seen as too
unreasonable by consumers, the
advertisements would likely hurt
sales.

News Service head
named top in U.S.
Bob Beyers, director of the Stan
ford News Service, has been se
lected "the most outstanding uni
versity news director for 1989," by
the editors of TQS News.
TQS News is a national news
publication for Chicanos and the
general public that concentrates
on higher education.
Beyers was cited for his work
on the news service's press re

leases, which were praised by TQS
for having "consistent educational
substance, professional excellence,
and for presenting the diversity of
a university in American society
today."
Dr. Octavio Romano, senior
editor ot TQS News, said the Stan
ford News Service "is truly a con
temporary manifestation of the
companion American ideals of ed
ucational excellence and public
service for an informed public, so
necessary if a democracy such as
ours is to flourish, grow and be
healthy."

Beyers, who has served as di
rector of the news service since
1961, stated he will donate the
$1000 honorarium that comes with
the award to the University to
improve recruitment of minority
students.
