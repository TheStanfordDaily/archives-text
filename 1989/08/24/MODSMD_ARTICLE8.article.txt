Cleveland will be joining his
wife Barbara, who retired in June
after serving as a costume techni
cian in Stanford's Drama Depart
ment for 35 years.

"The two of them have given
a lot of service to the University,
and the University should feel
lucky that it's had employees as
loyal as the Clevelands have been,"
said Larry Davidson, Events and
Services' director ot administra
tion, who has known the couple
for 25 years. He added that both
Clevelands were really nice people
who enjoyed working with stu
dents.
"It's hard to imagine the cos
tume shop without Barbara there,"
said Connie Strayer, a lecturer for
the Drama Department. "Bill was
always so involved and concerned
that he would go out of his way

to help even when it wasn't his
responsibility."
Events and Services and the
Drama Department will hold a
party for the couple on Friday,
from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m., in Frost
Amphitheater. "Everyone's in
vited" to the hash, which will fea
ture a western hand and re
freshments, according to David
son.
Barbara Cleveland, who worked
part-time for the Drama Depart
ment this summer despite having
retired, said the couple plans to
do some traveling and relaxing
when their retirement begins. "We
have no big plans," she added.
