On September 1, Tresidder's food
service changed. That day Bon Appdtit
arrived, and brought a master chef with
imagination instead of a cook with a rec
ipe file. And a decorator. And a lighting
designer. And a sense of what dining can
be.
Chef Ben Premack will be preparing
something fresh, daring, and different
each day, each week, like shrimp pasta
with feta and black olives, or curried tuna
with sweet mango chutney.
Mmmmm.
We just wanted to give you the news.
But even if we hadn't, your eyes, nose,
lips, teeth, and tongue would have told
you.
Go to Tresidder.
And Bon Appetit.
