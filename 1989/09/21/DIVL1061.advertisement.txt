Anchor Pad uses a high-tech adhesive capabl?
of securing your equipment with over 6,000 lbs.
of grip strength. This is secured to your desk with
a duel locking system. The computer can be used
while locked to the "pad" and can be removed
only with a unique key.
Your warranty need not be voided by
attachment of the Anchor Pad, which does NOT
require drilling holes in your machine. Your
furniture is not damaged as there is NO drilling
of holes or marring the furniture surface. The
adhesive mat can be removed from the surface
when desired using a "special" heat process.
