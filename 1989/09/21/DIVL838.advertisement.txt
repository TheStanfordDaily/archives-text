that last year Stanford recycled
enough paper, glass, and aluminum
to save 17,510 trees, enough elec
tricity to light 2,440 100-watt light
bulbs for a year, and enough
gasoline to drive from San Fran
cisco to New York 493 times?
that every student residence has at
least one cluster of recycling bins
for glass, cans, newspaper, and
white paper?
that green metal bins for flattened
cardboard are located on every
food service loading dock?
that over 50% of Stanford's trash is
recyclable?
that you can recycle junk mail in
bins outside the post office?
that after the Palo Alto landfill
closes in 1992, Stanford's waste
will have to be hauled to a landfill
south of San Jose?
WHAT YOU CAN DO:
RECYCLE YOUR CARDBOARD
MOVING BOXES! (if every Stanford
student throws away only 3 or 4
moving boxes, more than 7 1/2
tons of cardboard will be wasted)
