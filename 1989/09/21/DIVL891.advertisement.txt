TO YOUR NEW FAMILY
I '
A s part of the Stanford family, you've got
terrific connections in the world of finance.
Connections that get you:
u?* Checking with interest
A free ATM card
A low-cost VISA card
Banks won't give you these services at such
low cost. Only Stanford's own Credit Union will.
Owned by 25,000 members of the Stanford
Community, the Credit Union is a non-profit
cooperative. Compared with banks, we have
different priorities-and better policies.
And with each account federally insured to
$100,000, the Credit Union is a safe place for
your money.
As a new or returning member of the
Stanford family, you can join the Credit Union
today and start saving right away.
LOWER-COST CHECKING
WITH INTEREST
How much better is Credit Union checking?
Look at this chart and let the numbers do the
talking:
Based on telephone survey on 8/21/89
SIMPLER ATM CARDS
You get a free ATM card with your checking or
savings account, and you never pay a fee to use
it in any of our four ATMs on Stanford land.
And, for a nominal fee, you can make with
drawals at over 20,000 ATMs nationwide.
MORE AFFORDABLE VISA CAKOS
Credit Union VISA cards are easy to afford,
from the small $12 annual fee to the modest
15% APR interest.
No $18 membership fee, like the big banks
charge. No 19.8% to 20% APR interest.

students.
