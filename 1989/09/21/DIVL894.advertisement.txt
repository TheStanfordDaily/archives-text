INTRODUCTORY
DECISION
ANALYSIS
EES 31
This course is intended to transform the way participants conceive
of decision making and to empower them to make important
decisions in their personal and professional lives. Decision analysis
has grown over the last two decades from a mathematical theory to
a powerful professional discipline used by virtually every industry
and profession. Formerly available only to graduate students, the
course content has been redesigned to eliminate the need for a
calculus or probability prerequisite by reformulating rather than
watering down the methods of analysis.
• This course meets the undergraduate distribution requirement in Area
8 as well as the engineering breadth requirement in Category 8.
• 3 units, T-Th 11:00-12:15, McCullough 134, Professor R. Howard
