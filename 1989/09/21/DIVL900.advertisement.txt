If you're feeling a bit intimidated by suit-clad
classmates who are apparently interviewing
with some Fortune 500 company, calm your
fears. Your job may be found through other
channels. In fact, the majority of Stanford
students find jobs not through on-campus recruit
ing, but by one of many other services offered at
the CPPC. Come check them out. Whether you're
a frosh or PhD, there's something for you at the
Career Planning & Placement Center.
