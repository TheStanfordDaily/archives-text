International Students Christian Outreach (ISCO) serves the
international community at Stanford. Thousands of international
students and their families have participated in the activities of
ISCO during the past fifteen years. They have found them to be
one of the greatest experiences of their stay in the United States.
The program includes:
* Friday Night Dinners with guest speakers
* Bible Studies in English and Japanese
* English Classes for beginners
* Homestays with American families
* Tours and Retreats
(Yosemite National Park, Carmel-Monterey,
Lake Tahoe Ski Resorts, Disneyland etc.)
* Pebble Beach Golf Days (green fees half price)
