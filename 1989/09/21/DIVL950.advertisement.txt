Many of us are looking for firmer
ground, for convictions wo can
stand on. How do we find them?
In all ages there have been those
who have held to high ideals —
incorruptible integrity, moral
courage, unselfish action.
All these individuals were able to
glean some insight into Truth
which motivated and strength
ened them.
Today there is a religion which
penetrates the instability of
numan life. It reveals the provable
laws of God's goodness and pro
vides a solid basis for faith.
This religion is Christian Science.
