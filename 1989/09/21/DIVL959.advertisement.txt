Q'. "As a Macintosh owner, what advantages do
you have over other Stanford Students?"

I have found the Macintosh to be most useful during
my career at Stanford. I am definitely a "fuzzy* so the
Macintosh is perfect for what I do. Papers couldn't be easier.
Editing is a snap since I compose and revise with the
computer.
Several things influenced my purchase of a Macintosh.
First of all it, was pretty cheap. The pricing at Microdisc is
really low. Second of all, the whole university is geared
around the Macintosh. There are tons of in house experts. If
I need some help, I never even have to leave the floor to find
someone to help me.
The hard disk is really nice to have. I can use a
number of applications without ever swapping disks. It saves
me time and lets me do a number of things.
I'm hooked on the Macintosh.

The Macintosh makes my academic life significantly
easier. To begin with, word processing on the Macintosh is
key. Nothing looks better than clean typeface printed out to
a LaserWriter.
For programming, the Macintosh has to be the
machine to do object oriented programming with. There are a
broad spectrum of programming tools such as AppMaker,
MacApp, and HyperCard as well as any number of
languages. The best thing is that you really have a choice of
how far to go into it. For starters, programming with
HyperCard is a no brainer, I mean anyone could do it. If you
really want to go for it try Lisp. C, or Smalltalk.
There is one other aspect of the Macintosh that
shouldn't be underestimated: it is fun. Nothing else
tells Monty Python jokes when you turn it on.

The Macintosh cuts down the time it takes to do
research tremendously. I can hook into Meyer Library with
my modem and save myself numerous late night trips across
campus. Since I spend less time running around. I can really
focus on the quality of what I am doing or I can apply that
freed up time to other tnings. Either way it really helps.
I have used the Macintosh in virtually all of my
activities at Stanford, including things I did for the Stanford
Daily, the Student Directory, and the Volunteer Services.
Owning a Macintosh gives me an advantage over other
students. While there are a number of dorm clusters, I save
both time and effort by having my own Macintosh and not
having to hassle with the cluster procedures. I think that
the Macintosh is a must for a Stanford student.

I did practically everything with my Macintosh from
desktop publishing to computer aided design. I wrote all of
my papers on the Macintosh using Microsoft Word.
HyperCard was great for categorizing my research notes. I
could type notes in and link them to other notes which was
quite a bit better than the old index cards. I also used
PowerPoint for public speaking classes and doing
presentations. It is real easy to whip up some overheads
using the Macintosh and a LaserWriter. As I entered the job
market upon graduation, I had a tremendous advantage
knowing the benefits and powers of the computer.
To summarize, the Macintosh was the most
useful thing that I had around in school. It was
certainly better than a boyfriend. It actually helped me with
my school work and it certainly didn't leave dirty socks
around.
There are three types of students at Stanford: those that
own a Macintosh; those that will buy a Macintosh; and
those that are at a serious disadvantage because they won't
buy a Macintosh. Don't be at a disadvantage. Visit
Microdisc in the Stanford Bookstore.
