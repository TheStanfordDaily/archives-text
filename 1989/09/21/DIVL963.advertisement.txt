Q: "As a Macintosh user, what perspective do
you have on the use of computers in education?"

Effective teaching, especially in the humanities, is a
highly labor-intensive activity. Learning is directly related
to the amount of effort expended by the teacher and learner.
Time — both faculty and student time — is the most
precious commodity in the university.
Computers have the potential -- to date only
very partially realized -- to make teaching and
learning far more efficient. By automating routine
aspects of the educational process, we can save a great deal
of time for more substantive and creative activities. Not
only can computers eliminate unnecessary repetition, they
also enhance student interest by making the learning
process an interactive one.

At the Graduate School of Business, we must prepare
students for the world they enter upon graduation. When
our students graduate, we want them to be confident that
they can get the job done. This means understanding the
benefits that computers provide.
While the GSB is certainly a multivendor school, a
sizable proportion of our computers are Macintosh
computers. Quite a few faculty members are impressed with
the graphics capabilities of programs such as Microsoft
Excel. Also, there is growing interest in other types of
applications such as Mathematica and various statistical
programs. When it comes to productivity, we think
Macintosh offers advantages in its graphic interface
and the consistency of that interface throughout
applications.

The Macintosh has already made an impact in
the way in which materials are taught in the School
of Engineering. For example, students in the
undergraduate thermodynamics courses use a program that
is both a simulation and a tutorial. With this software,
students can handle more complicated problems, spend less
time looking up values in tables, and spend more time
thinking about the basis of the problem. Because the
computers arc so easy to use, students can investigate
more, and ultimately learn more.
Computers will change the structure of engineering
education and the way in which mathematics, science, and
engineering are taught.

Over the past several hundred years, there have been
very few technological innovations that have radically
changed scholarship as we know it. There are three things
that come to mind; the eyeglasses, the printing press, and
the personal computer. Eyeglasses doubled a scholar's
career, the printing press made one's works widely available,
and the computer has significantly boosted the level of
scholarly efficiency. A student or faculty member using a
computer will undoubtedly discover a massive time savings
in the preparation of course materials.
Having used several different computer
platforms, I have found the Macintosh to be head
and shoulders above the others, not only in its ease of
use, but also in the variety of software geared towards the
single scholar.
Apple® Computers provide more solutions for more people in
education than all other personal computers combined.
And more universities recommend Apple personal
computers than any others.
