♦ Gourmet Chinese
Celebrating its twentieth anniversary in the heart of
the Peninsula s El Camino Real nightlife. Chef Chu's
offers a unique blend of Chinese cuisine, culture, and
personal service. In the downstairs bar and dining
room, the mood is bustling, upbeat, and fun, with an
open kitchen adding to the festive tone. The upstairs
is more formal, with a magnificent wood carving of
The Nine Dragons, a replica of the one in The
Imperial Ralace of Beijing, covering the entire wall.
Highly recommended by their many satisfied
customers. Chef Chu s offers the perfect environment
for a romantic dinner for two or a large gathering
of friends!
