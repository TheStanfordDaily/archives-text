# Editor to the rescue
## 
### Amy Rosenfeld Editorial staff 
When Vivian Su was elected
editor in chief of her high
school yearbook last fall, there
was one small problem. "I had
no experience and neither did
my staff," says the freshman
from Valley Forge, Pa.
Nevertheless, when the 58
members of her class realized
that, while they needed an
editor, no senior had ever
worked on a yearbook, the task
fell to Su. The job "taught me
a lot of responsibility within a
short time," says Su, who
quickly managed to learn her
job and also learned to manage
her time, a skill which should
help her at Stanford.
In her scant spare time from
the yearbook, Su also managed
her school's volleyball team and
played the handbells with a
group of fellow students. The
group played a three octave set
of handbells, which look like
the kind of bells a town crier
would ring, Su says.
Each person is responsible
for four to six bells and to
gether they can play an entire
song. Coordinating nine people
can prove challenging, but most
had prior musical experience.
"If you have good timing it
should all work out," says Su,
who also plays the piano and
violin.
While she originally thought
she might like to go to school
on the East Coast because she
is more comfortable there, Su

says 3he thinks the "total
change in environment" that
Stanford will bring might
broaden her views and help her
see California as more than
just a vacation spot.
Coming to Stanford is "kind
of exciting, but a little bit
scary," says Su. She will be
living at Eucalypto House in
Lagunita Court, and while she
counts on meeting a lot of
freshman in class, she is also
looking forward to the chance
to meet upperclass students in
her four-class dormitory.
But will she work on the
Quad, Stanford's yearbook?
While Su says it is "a possibil
ity," she adds that "after my
little experience, I kind of
wanted to take a little rest."
