# Soccer player gets head start on year
## 
### Jennifer Schmid Editorial staff 
Peter Jeans may be waiting
for school to start just as much
as the rest of his freshman class,
but he certainly didn't wait long
to make the trip out here.
That's because the Gillette,
N.J., freshman arrived at Stan
ford in mid-August, in order to
try out for the Stanford soccer
team.
Not only that, but Jeans and
his family traveled from the East
Coast by car, stopping along the
way to visit family in Minnesota

and check out Yellowstone Na
tional Park. This made Jeans'
summer very short indeed and
explains why he was "completely
unemployed" this summer and,
in his own words, "just bummed
around."
Jeans said he was recruited to
play soccer here and at Prince
ton University, but he applied
considering academics first and
the soccer program second.
Jeans picked Stanford over
Princeton because he "already
knew what Princeton was like"
(he has an older brother who
goes there) and he wanted "to

do something new and indepen
dent." In addition, he was able
to visit this campus in February
and found the atmosphere on
the Farm "very intriguing."
Although not a member of the
18-man traveling team, Jeans
has been attending soccer prac
tices and home games. He said
he hopes to play on the squad
later in the season.
In his opinion, Stanford has
a strong team this year but plays
an extremely tough schedule, in
cluding the two top-ranked
schools in the nation.

Outside of his obvious sports
interest, Jeans is also a big music
fan with a large record collec
tion. His new Toyon roommates
may be disappointed (or relieved,
depending on their own tastes)
to know that for now, the col
lection remains at home.
Jeans is considering writing
for some Stanford publication
since he already has journalistic
experience. In high school he and
a couple of buddies wrote and
published an "underground"
newspaper which, he says,"the
administration wasn't too crazy
about."
