# L.A. woman reaches out to kids
## 
### Jock Friedly Editorial staff 
At a school for the blind, a little
boy turned to Jackie Stinehart
and said, "Jackie, I would like to
see you."
Stinehart, who is entering Stan
ford this fall as a freshman, said
she will probably never forget that
young child.
"I've never had a more reward
ing experience," said Stinehart
from her Los Angeles home. From
the first day she worked at the
school for the blind, she knew she
could make a real difference in
some little child's life.
"The kids would depend on
me," she said. "Often they would
just want a friend."
Although no other experience
has left such a deep impression
on her, Stinehart has long been
active in community service and
she said she hopes to continue
that when she gets to Stanford.

Even after her experience in
community service, Stinehart said
she considers herself "pretty shel
tered." Stinehart attended
Marlborough, a small private all
girls school located in the Hancock
Park area of Los Angeles. She
was one of nine students accepted
to Stanford from a graduating
class of just 88.
In high school, Stinehart was
very active on her school paper,
for which she was a reporter,
sports editor and then a managing
editor. Besides journalism,
Stinehart dabbled in tennis and
was voted "most dedicated player"
on her junior varsity team in her
junior year. She also was involved
in dance, skiing and travel.
"I consider myself not excellent
in anything, but very well
rounded," she said.
Like many freshmen, she wants
to keep an open mind right now
about her although she
said she might be interested in

communication, history or Eng
lish. After that she said anything
is possible, but she is considering
a career in journalism, perhaps
broadcast.
Stinehart is somewhat scared
of her upcoming college experi
ence. "It will be hard for me at
first," she admitted. "I'm getting
a little anxious to find out who
my roommate is."
But if she is nervous about get
ting to campus, Stinehart will
likely have no problems making
friends. "I've never met more en
thusiastic, supportive and outgo
ing people than at Stanford," she
said.
She said the campus' atmos
phere is markedly different from
the days of high school when
people were so grade-conscious
and not as supportive.
"You are very worried with
what other people are doing," she
explained. "I wanted to get away
from that."
