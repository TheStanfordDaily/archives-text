# High-techie dreams of glory

Like many other incoming
freshmen, Sean Morales looks for
ward to a life spent designing to
morrow's technological wonders.
But engineering innovation is
only half the picture. For Morales,
the other half is ensuring that
technology serves a social pur
pose.
"Engineering should be philan
thropic," Morales says. "There are
lots of devices I can visualize that
don't exist yet, but if they did
would improve the human social
state."
The freshman from Palacios,
Texas, has spent a good deal of
his time over the last year-and-a
half pursuing projects such as
building an FM radio on his own
to learn about radio circuitry. But
grander ideas — now just on
paper — consume his interest.
That interest centers on the in
tersection of fiber optics and dig
ital information processing.
"I was always interested in the
latest technologies and was fasci
nated by the compact disc, how
it could be used for so many dif
ferent things," Morales says."It
could be the perfect medium for

oral, visual and textual informa
tion. I think it would be neat to
work with that change."
Morales says the full potential
of compact disc technology is only
beginning to be explored, and adds
that the current technology is
comparable to that of magnetic
tape in the early 19705.
Morales eventually wants to
devote his energies to extending
compact disc capabilities to areas

such as animation, music synthe
sis and even word processing.
"It would be the ultimate way
of recording and transmitting
data," he says.
After applying to institutions
including the California Institute
of Technology and Harvard Uni
versity, Morales picked Stanford
both because of "its national rep
utation as an engineering school"
and his curiosity about "the Cal
ifornia lifestyle."
Morales' interest in social issues
extends beyond creating useful
technology. He specifically refers
to the essay he wrote for his Stan
ford application.
Asked on the application what
topic he would like to write a book
on, Morales responded he would
write a satire on groups of people
who perpetuate the cycle of child
abuse. The satire would focus on
groups who ignore or rationalize
incidents of child abuse — and it
would be based on the social at
mosphere of his own home town
of 5,000 people, he says.
But fiction writing is not in
cluded among Morales' primary
academic interests. He plans to
major in electrical engineering
and hopes to begin research on
compact disc development.
