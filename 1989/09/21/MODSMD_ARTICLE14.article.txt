# From Casper to Branner
## 
### Amy Rosenfeld Editorial staff 
Edmond Toy visited Stanford
several years ago on a West
Coast trip with his family, but
he says he "[doesn't] remember
anything but palm trees."
They checked out the Book
store and went to the top of
Hoover Tower, but "never
would have thought" that he
would be a student here years
later, Toy says.
On his return trip to Stan
ford, the freshman from Casper,
Wyo. v will be living in Branner
Hall and looks forward to
"something new." While his
friends who attend the Univer
sity of Wyoming already know
many of their classmates from
high school, Toy says he is ex
cited about meeting all kinds of
different people who are "all in
the same boat."
In high school, Toy was stu
dent council president, ran cross
country, wrestled and played the
violin in his school orchestra.
He spent his summers living at
the University of Wyoming and

working in a pharmacy lab and
a microbiology lab.
When Dean of Admissions
Jean Fetter asked Toy (and
16,000 other high school sen
iors) to describe his best con
versation, he drew on his last
summer's experience at the Uni
versity of Wyoming.
The only room Toy could get
was on the same floor as par
ticipants in the Higher Educa
tion Project, a national program
that encourages struggling stu
dents to finish high school and
go to college. While the students
in the program had a "bad rep
utation" on campus, Toy says
they didn't live up to that rep
utation and he has since missed
them.
While he has the most expe
rience in scientific fields, Toy
says he is not sure he wants to
in a science. This sum
mer, his internship at a local
television station sparked an in
terest in journalism and he says
he is considering working at X
TV, Stanford's student station.
Toy says "just about every
thing" attracted him to Stan

ford. While he briefly thought
about going back East, he soon
realized that the East Coast
simply cannot compete with
"the California scene" as he
describes it.
Toy says he is too excited to
really dread anything about
Stanford.
