# Film buff seeks challenge at Stanford

Brad Bruner may be new on the
Stanford campus, but he is right
at home discussing the Western
Culture controversy. As a fresh
man last year at Tulane Univer
sity in liOuisiana, Bruner wrote a
research paper examining both
sides of the issue.
Soon Bruner will have the op
portunity to make a personal cri
tique of the Western Culture
program, having transferred form
Tulane where he felt that "aca
demics were not as stellar or chal
lenging" as he had hoped.
After attending a high school
near his home in Madisonville,
Tenn. that did not offer honors
or Advanced Placement classes,
Bruner had looked forward to
coursework that would require
more effort in college. Despite par
ticipating in the honors program
at Tulane, Bruner said he was
not satisfied.
"I wanted to be challenged, and
Stanford was there," Bruner said.
Bruner, who drove through Stan
ford two years ago, also consid
ered the campus an incentive. "I
was entranced by it,"he said.
His research on the Western
Culture program has given
Bruner the opportunity to form

a well-educated opinion about one
of the most heavily debated topics
at Stanford.
"I like the fact that [Western
Culture] has been broadened, but
I think it should be broadened
more," Bruner said, suggesting
the expansion of regional writers.
However, Bruner conceded the
difficulty in defining Western Cul
ture, saying, "If you start making
changes, at what point can you
stop?"
Bruner hopes to study overseas
in Italy for two quarters and plans
to complete a double mtyor in lin
guistics and Italian. He attributes
these interests to past success
with language and writing and
the fact that he can "get so excited
about abstract ideas."
Film is Bruner's favorite hobby.
He has written several film scripts
and was the head film critic for
Tulane's student newspaper.
He is most fond of Italian films,
his favorite being "The Bicycle
Thieves," which examines an Ital
ian man's struggle to rebuild his
life after World War 11. Also a fan
of modern movies, Bruner consid
ers "The Accidental Tourist" last
year's best film, and he receives
a discounted rate at his local
theater because he is such a reg
ular customer.
Bruner's other interests range

from folk dancing to trap and
skeet shooting to sailing. Bruner
hopes to write for The Stanford
Daily and possibly become a res
ident assistant, a position he
would have held this year at
Tulane.
In addition to continuing his
diverse interests, Bruner is
looking forward to "a higher level
of individuality" among his peers
at Stanford. "I don't like single
mindedness," Bruner said.
Making the move to Stanford
was a decision that Bruner de

'I like the fact that
[Western Culture]
has been
broadened, but I
think it should be
broadened more
... [but when] can
you stop?"
— Brad Bruner

scribed as "heartwrenching."
"I knew in my heart I was doing
the right thing," Bruner said. "I
would have the opportunity to
make as many friends at Stanford
as Tulane."
Stanford will actually be
Bruner's third college this year,
as he recently completed summer
school at Middlebury College in
Vermont. Looking ahead to yet
another move, with new people
and surroundings, Bruner states
his attitude with confidence,
"Change can be good."
