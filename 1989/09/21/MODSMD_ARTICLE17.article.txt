# Transfer moves west seeking Stanford fun
## 
### Jennifer Schmid Editorial staff 
Claudine Gay has lived her
life in many different places,
but she thinks her latest move
may be the right one at last.
The 19-year-old sophomore is
entering Stanford this fall as a
transfer student from Prince
ton University. The transition
might sound difficult, but
growing up the daughter of a
frequently-transferred govern
ment engineer makes it easy
for her to pick up and leave,
she says.
"I really needed a change,
and Stanford has a completely
different atmosphere from
Princeton," Gay says. "Prince
ton is cold, traditional and aus
tere. Stanford has a much more
nurturing, humane environ
ment."
She says she looks forward
to a more lively experience at
Stanford.
"Everybody at Princeton was
already middle-aged. At Stan
ford people are working but
still seem to be having a really

good time," she says.
Gay's family moved to
Sacramento seven months ago.
Born in New York City, she
grew up in Saudi Arabia and
has since lived in places from
Colorado to Georgia.
One of her most interesting
life experiences was this last
year when she participated in
a Princeton volunteer program
called Prison Outreach, Gay
says.
Student volunteers in the
program were each assigned an
inmate at a local prison to visit
with and tutor. It took four
hours a week, but Gay says the
experience was valuable.
"It sounds kind of patroniz
ing, this little Princeton girl
going in and talking with an
inmate, but it ended up being
interesting," she says."It was
good to get away from campus
and talk with someone different
from the people you interact
with normally."
Gay says she would like to
continue a version of the pro
gram at Stanford.
