# But will I like my roommate?
## 
### Lisa Carey 
For the 1,570 freshmen who
begin their Stanford careers this
fall, the dorm will provide much
more than just somewhere to eat
and sleep.
Numerous activities and proj
ects give residents a chance to get
involved and make a difference in
their community. The residence
hall becomes a place to live, learn
and make lasting friends — a
home.
For the meyority of students em
barking on their first year of col
lege, sharing a room is a new
experience. Such a change re
quires adjustment and compro
mise, and the housing staff takes
great care in placing freshmen
with roommates to ensure they
will find their living situations
both educational and enjoyable.
The housing office strives to
make each residence a microcosm
of the class that it represents. Ac
cording to Freshman Orientation
Coordinator Betsy Wallace, creat
ing a balance between com
patability and diversity is the
main goal when matching resi
dents. Wallace's summer job in

cluded the challenging task of
matching roommates for the
freshman class.
By carefully poring over pref
erence forms received from stu
dents, the housing staff has
labored to obtain a careful bal
ance. Though certain common in
terests such as music, hobbies and
academic interests are considered,
great care is taken to ensure that
roommates will be able to learn
from one another.
For this reason, no two students
with the same intended or
the same home state (except Cal
ifornia which boasts one-third of
the class) are assigned to the same
room. Efforts are also made to
match from different educational
backgrounds and family histories.
For returning students who will
arrive September 23, the system
for placement in residences is
quite different. Through a com
pletely random system known as
"the Draw," students rank their
housing choices and draw a num
ber — either alone or in groups
of up to eight — which determines
their priority in choosing housing
for the following year.

About half the freshmen will
find themselves in all-frosh dorms
this year, with the remainder
living in four-class dorms. Regard
less, a strong sense of community
inevitably develops in each resi
dence through the assistance of
the residence staff.
As friends and role models, res
ident fellows and assistants help
to ensure the strength of the com
munity and the general happiness
of its members. By promoting ed
ucational, cultural and social pro
grams for residents, staff
members create opportunities for
students to develop their interests
and clarify their values and atti
tudes.
Karen Kinney, assistant direc
tor of Residential Education, said
the most important goal of dorm
living is to help students to
develop a strong community
where each member is respected
and comfortable to voice his or
her views. This respect that is
developed, according to Kinney,
allows the community to celebrate
its differences. "With such a com
munity everything else follows,"
Kinney says.
