# News you can use: what every frosh should know

### 
Stanford last year was a center
of debate on issues ranging from
multicultural education to labor
disputes to free expression. Many
of the events and discussions will
continue to shape campus issues
this year. For the benefit of those
who are new to the campus, fol
lowing is a summary of the issues
that likely will be making more
headlines in The Daily this year.
UCMI report
The Stanford community will
be watching closely this year as
the implementation process con
tinues for recommendations made
in the 240-page report by the Uni
versity Committee on Minority Is
sues.
The UCMI was formed in Oc
tober 1987 in response to a
demand by the Rainbow Agenda,
a coalition of minority student
groups on campus. Comprised of
administrators, faculty members
and students, the UCMI sought
to shed new light on campus race
relations. After several delays, it
released its final report last
March.
The long-awaited report con
tains about 120 specific recom
mendations addressing areas of
curriculum, faculty diversity, ad
missions and staff.
Some of the more sweeping rec
ommendations include increasing
the number of minority faculty
by 30 over the next ten years,
doubling the number of minority
students in Ph.D. programs and
developing more courses in ethnic
studies.
In an address to the Academic
Council in May, University Pres
ident Donald Kennedy announced
that several of the UCMI recom
mendations had been accepted and
that a "priority-setting process"
would determine how other rec
ommendations would be imple
mented.
Office takeover
More than 50 Stanford stu
dents, fighting under the banner
of the Agenda for Action coalition,
were arrested last May following
an eight-hour occupation of Uni
versity President Donald Ken
nedy's office.
The coalition which staged the
takeover is comprised of individ

uals from the four ethnic
minority student groups on
campus and the Committee on
Democracy in Education, a
student-government-sponsored
group committed to greater stu
dent representation in University
matters.
Two members of this year's
Council of Presidents (the four
member executive branch of Stan
ford's student government) were
among those arrested.
The takeover took place three
days before Kennedy was sched
uled to give an address on recom
mendations made in the report by
the University Committee on Mi
nority Issues.
Angered by what they viewed
as a disregard for student input
on setting UCMI priorities, the
students barricaded themselves in
Building 10 and demanded a face
to-face meeting with Kennedy to
discuss their agenda for the Uni
versity.
According to protesters, the
takeover was the culmination of
years of frustration with normal
University channels. The
struggles which contributed to the
students' decision to occupy Ken
nedy's office included: fruitless at
tempts to persuade the History
Department to hire a professor of
Asian-American history; the fight
for a democratic selection process
for a new dean of El Centro Chi
cano, the Chicano/Latino student
community center; and efforts to
seek protection against verbal
abuse and racial harrassment.
Those involved in the takeover
of Kennedy's office were charged
by the University under the
campus disruption code, which
states that a disruption of official
University business is punishable
by penalties ranging from repri
mand to expulsion.
After a rushed judicial process,
protesters were sentenced by the
University to perform 75 hours
of volunteer work. An additional
40 hours of community service
will have to be performed by each
Drotester as a result of state mis
demeanor charges.
Following the takeover, the co
ilition members held several
neetings with Kennedy, the first
)f which took place a week after
;he takeover. Both sides agreed
;hat some progress was made on
i number of issues concerning the

coalition.
However, disagreements over
why the protesters were being
charged under the disruption code
led to increased tension. Following
one meeting with Kennedy,
several protesters claimed the
University's proclaimed commit
ment to multicultural education
was "nothing but a big lie."
When spring quarter ended,
many issues were still left to be
resolved. Kennedy has made it
clear that the administration will
not tolerate a similar incident.
The Fundamental Standard
In October 1988, two white
freshmen admitted to posting a
racially offensive flier near the

door of a black student living in
Ujamaa House, the black theme
house.
The University did not charge
the two freshmen with a Funda
mental Standard violation, citing
free speech rights protected by the
First Amendment. This decision
sparked a campuswide debate and
motivated the Student Conduct
Legislative Council to propose an
"interpretation" of the Funda
mental Standard that would make
racial slurs and otherwise offen
sive acts and expression a viola
tion.
The 12-member council came
up with two proposals but was
not able to come up with a final
recommendation before the year

ended.
The first proposal, which would
make expression that is offensive
on the basis of "accepted commu
nity standards" a violation, was
nearly unanimously rejected by
the University community.
A second, narrower proposal
was more warmly received, but
council members decided to stop
work on it as the year came to
an end. Future work on the Stand
ard interpretation is in doubt be
cause the members of the council
— who have one-year terms —
will be almost completely different
this year.
Hoover Institution
W. Glenn Campbell, who spent

nearly 30 years building the Hoo
ver Institution into one of the
world's finest conservative think
tanks, was ousted from his posi
tion in August.
For years the Stanford admin
istration has battled the feisty and
controversial director and ulti
mately called upon a little known
and rarely used clause that 65-
year-old administrators must step
down. Ultimately, Campbell
struck a lucrative bargain with
the University and, after throw
ing himself a lavish retirement
party, stepped down from the po
sition.
Much talk filled the hallowed
