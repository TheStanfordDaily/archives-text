# News you can use: what every frosh should know

### 
Stanford last year was a center
of debate on issues ranging from
multicultural education to labor
disputes to free expression. Many
of the events and discussions will
continue to shape campus issues
this year. For the benefit of those
who are new to the campus, fol
lowing is a summary of the issues
that likely will be making more
headlines in The Daily this year.
UCMI report
The Stanford community will
be watching closely this year as
the implementation process con
tinues for recommendations made
in the 240-page report by the Uni
versity Committee on Minority Is
sues.
The UCMI was formed in Oc
tober 1987 in response to a
demand by the Rainbow Agenda,
a coalition of minority student
groups on campus. Comprised of
administrators, faculty members
and students, the UCMI sought
to shed new light on campus race
relations. After several delays, it
released its final report last
March.
The long-awaited report con
tains about 120 specific recom
mendations addressing areas of
curriculum, faculty diversity, ad
missions and staff.
Some of the more sweeping rec
ommendations include increasing
the number of minority faculty
by 30 over the next ten years,
doubling the number of minority
students in Ph.D. programs and
developing more courses in ethnic
studies.
In an address to the Academic
Council in May, University Pres
ident Donald Kennedy announced
that several of the UCMI recom
mendations had been accepted and
that a "priority-setting process"
would determine how other rec
ommendations would be imple
mented.
Office takeover
More than 50 Stanford stu
dents, fighting under the banner
of the Agenda for Action coalition,
were arrested last May following
an eight-hour occupation of Uni
versity President Donald Ken
nedy's office.
The coalition which staged the
takeover is comprised of individ

uals from the four ethnic
minority student groups on
campus and the Committee on
Democracy in Education, a
student-government-sponsored
group committed to greater stu
dent representation in University
matters.
Two members of this year's
Council of Presidents (the four
member executive branch of Stan
ford's student government) were
among those arrested.
The takeover took place three
days before Kennedy was sched
uled to give an address on recom
mendations made in the report by
the University Committee on Mi
nority Issues.
Angered by what they viewed
as a disregard for student input
on setting UCMI priorities, the
students barricaded themselves in
Building 10 and demanded a face
to-face meeting with Kennedy to
discuss their agenda for the Uni
versity.
According to protesters, the
takeover was the culmination of
years of frustration with normal
University channels. The
struggles which contributed to the
students' decision to occupy Ken
nedy's office included: fruitless at
tempts to persuade the History
Department to hire a professor of
Asian-American history; the fight
for a democratic selection process
for a new dean of El Centro Chi
cano, the Chicano/Latino student
community center; and efforts to
seek protection against verbal
abuse and racial harrassment.
Those involved in the takeover
of Kennedy's office were charged
by the University under the
campus disruption code, which
states that a disruption of official
University business is punishable
by penalties ranging from repri
mand to expulsion.
After a rushed judicial process,
protesters were sentenced by the
University to perform 75 hours
of volunteer work. An additional
40 hours of community service
will have to be performed by each
Drotester as a result of state mis
demeanor charges.
Following the takeover, the co
ilition members held several
neetings with Kennedy, the first
)f which took place a week after
;he takeover. Both sides agreed
;hat some progress was made on
i number of issues concerning the

coalition.
However, disagreements over
why the protesters were being
charged under the disruption code
led to increased tension. Following
one meeting with Kennedy,
several protesters claimed the
University's proclaimed commit
ment to multicultural education
was "nothing but a big lie."
When spring quarter ended,
many issues were still left to be
resolved. Kennedy has made it
clear that the administration will
not tolerate a similar incident.
The Fundamental Standard
In October 1988, two white
freshmen admitted to posting a
racially offensive flier near the

door of a black student living in
Ujamaa House, the black theme
house.
The University did not charge
the two freshmen with a Funda
mental Standard violation, citing
free speech rights protected by the
First Amendment. This decision
sparked a campuswide debate and
motivated the Student Conduct
Legislative Council to propose an
"interpretation" of the Funda
mental Standard that would make
racial slurs and otherwise offen
sive acts and expression a viola
tion.
The 12-member council came
up with two proposals but was
not able to come up with a final
recommendation before the year

ended.
The first proposal, which would
make expression that is offensive
on the basis of "accepted commu
nity standards" a violation, was
nearly unanimously rejected by
the University community.
A second, narrower proposal
was more warmly received, but
council members decided to stop
work on it as the year came to
an end. Future work on the Stand
ard interpretation is in doubt be
cause the members of the council
— who have one-year terms —
will be almost completely different
this year.
Hoover Institution
W. Glenn Campbell, who spent

nearly 30 years building the Hoo
ver Institution into one of the
world's finest conservative think
tanks, was ousted from his posi
tion in August.
For years the Stanford admin
istration has battled the feisty and
controversial director and ulti
mately called upon a little known
and rarely used clause that 65-
year-old administrators must step
down. Ultimately, Campbell
struck a lucrative bargain with
the University and, after throw
ing himself a lavish retirement
party, stepped down from the po
sition.
Much talk filled the hallowed

Hoover halls last year that Economics
Prof. Michael Boskin, President Bush's
chief economic adviser, would take Hoo
ver's helm when he left the Bush ad
ministration. Boskin might still take
over after he leaves Washington, but
nobody yet is placing wagers on the
possibility.
John Raisian, a more mild-mannered
Hoover fellow who will surely work bet
ter with the Stanford administration,
accepted the post for one year until a
permanent director could be found.
Raisian's leadership could be crucial in
the coming months as the Faculty Sen
ate is expected to debate the merits of
keeping ties with Hoover.
Cold fusion
When frenzy over cold fusion, a proc
ess not before thought possible, reached
a high last spring, a Stanford electroc
hemist made a stunning confirmation
of the phenomenon in a red Rubbermaid
picnic cooler experiment.
Materials Science Prof. Robert Hug
gins and his team, weary from long
hours in the lab, announced they had
performed a control experiment that
provided irrefutable evidence that cold
fusion was not just "weird chemistry."
Cold fusion, the binding of atoms at
room temperature that could potentially
create a gr.eat deal of heat, was hoped
to be the energy source of the future.
The consensus, however, was that cold
fusion was an illusion, and dreams of
cheap, clean power were swept away.
The Stanford discovery, along with
several other successful cold fusion ex
periments around the country, came un
der intense scrutiny, but nobody could
provide convincing answers to what
they were seeing.
What remains to be seen is whether
this still-unexplained phenomenon has
produced anything more than shattered
dreams.
COP platforms
Political agendas appear to have be
come a msyor factor in elections for the
ASSU's four-member Council of Presi
dents in recent years.
Last spring's COP race pitted the in
cumbent People's Platform party, which
focuses especially on issues of race and
gender, against a slate from the newly
formed Students First party, which
pledged to avoid political agendas.
The People's Platform slate, called
Slate of the Times, won a runoff election
with 55 percent of the vote. It is ex
pected that the People's Platform COP
this year will continue its activities in
pushing for ethnic studies, increased
hiring of minority faculty, increased TA
funding and support of the Agenda for
Action coalition.
Students First, though defeated for
COP, nevertheless saw several of the
ASSU Senate candidates it endorsed win
seats. The Senate is the ASSU's legisla
tive body, made up of 20 undergraduates

and 20 graduate students, which deter
mines the ASSU budget and discusses
issues relevant to student life.
CIV
The University's much-debated West
ern Culture program officially changes
to the Cultures, Ideas and Values pro
gram this year.
The change to CIV was apprjved by
the Faculty Senate in Marc'.i 1988 in
an effort to increase students' under
standing of social and geographical di
versity and awareness of rate, gender
and class issues.
The Faculty Senate debate touched
off heated discussion nationwide and
drew criticism that Stanford was "Plato
bashing" — a charge repeatedly denied
by University officials.
Despite the name change and the ab
sence of a core reading list, professors
say most of the tracks this year will
not be radically different from last
year's. The tracks, they say, have been
gradually broadening their focus over
the last several years, independent of
the CIV legislation.
Health and safety
In 1988, the University was shaken
by allegations that it engaged in
coverup, intimidation and mismanage
ment concerning the safety of its labo
ratories.
That year, the University ordered a
revamping of the entire system of health
and safety at Stanford. Since then, of
ficials with the Department of Environ
mental Health and Safety have been
trying to keep afloat in a sea of paper
work and new government regulations.
Meanwhile, Stanford made a
$200,000 settlement with a former em
ployee who made the original allega
tions, and since that time the University
has been hit by at least two separate
lawsuits related to health and safty.
Other suits may potentially result from
Stanford's past, and perhaps present,
safety negligence.
Arms control center
One of the world's leading arms con
trol centers, the Center for International
Security and Arms Control barely sur
vived the resignation of co-director Sid
ney Drell, a move which triggered other
top experts to leave.
Drell, a top particle physics theorist
and arms control expert, submitted his
resignation because the University
would not give the center its own profes
sorial appointments.
Drell's resignation prompted physi
cists Ted Postol and Sally Ride, the
former astronaut, to quit their posts at
the center. The center stabilized when
it was announced that Bill Perry, a
former undersecretary of defense in the
Carter administration, was to fill Drell's
shoes.
Because Perry only took on the co
directorship in late August, it remains
to be seen what he will be able to do

with the Center.
Webb Ranch
From a quiet, 250-acre vegetable and
berry farm on University land emerged
a classic saga of labor versus manage
ment, culminating in a vote to unionize
and laborers' hopes to finally lead a
better life.
On one side was the United Stanford
Workers, a union representing more
than 1,000 technical and service
workers on campus, at the Stanford
Medical Center and the Stanford Linear
Accelerator Center. Gathering support
through media-grabbing efforts, the
USW eventually succeeded in adding the
more than 50 resident laborers on Webb
Ranch to their membership list.
On the other side were Stanford and
Webb Ranch management, who kept
busy trying to fight off the label of
exploitation. The University, which
owns the land, maintained that it was
not responsible for overseeing the living
and working conditions of the ranch,
but that it would look into any reports
of health code violations.
Claiming in February that the Uni
versity was not sympathetic to its case,
the USW went to the state Agriculture
Labor Relations Board, attempting to
bring about elections for the laborers.
Following failed negotiations and a
mysterious fire on the ranch in the
home of the director, ranch workers
voted to unionize. Two weeks later the
state recognized the USW as the
workers' representatives.
Asian-American studies
A committee is soon to begin the
search for a tenure-track professor in
Asian-American studies.
History lecturer Gordon Chang, who
taught the University's only course in
the subject, left Stanford at the end of
the year to assume a tenure-track po
sition at UC-Irvine.
Student organizations had pressured
University officials for such a position
to be created at Stanford, but officials
stalled on the issue, citing financial con
straints and the need to address more
pressing priorities.
That changed on May 24, when the
administration announced it would in
itiate an inter-departmental search for
an Asian-American studies professor. At
this point, four faculty members have
been named to the search committee. Two
students, to be selected by the Asian-
American Students Association, will also
serve on the committee.
Officials hope to have a professor in
place by the fall of 1990, but the "un
known circumstances of the search"
prevent them from making any promises,
said Asst. Dean of Academic Affairs
Kathryn Gillam.

rial staff members John Wagner, Jock
Friedly and Brad Hayward.
