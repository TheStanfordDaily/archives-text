# Stanford's buildings and land rich in history and beauty
## 
### 
When David Starr Jordan ar
rived at Stanford in the summer
of 1891 to be the University's first
president, he found the country
side enthralling.
"The Santa Clara Valley," he
wrote in his autobiography, "ex
tends southward 50 miles and
more from near the head of San
Francisco Bay. Bounding it on the
southwest rises.. .the Sierra de la
Santa Cruz — 'a misty camp of
mountains pitched tumultuous
ly....
"Immediately behind the Uni
versity estate and forming its
higher background is the wooded
Sierra Morena, its cloak of red
wood, oak and madrona diver
sified by thickets of chemisal. . . .
"On the east, opposing the
green ridges of the Holy Cross,
stretches the long, relatively bar
ren and treeless Sierra del Monte
Diablo."
In this sheltered area 30 miles
south of San Francisco, its favor
able climate assured by its loca
tion between bay and ocean, its
meadows patterned with ancient
oaks, Sen. Leland Stanford and
his wife, Jane, established a uni
versity on the site of their home
in Palo Alto.
The first parcel of land, bought
in 1876, consisted of 650 acres
along San Francisquito Creek.
Subsequent purchases increased
the total to 8250 acres.
All of the Stanfords' land was
deeded to the University in the
school's 1885 Grant of Endowment
with the stipulation that it should
never be sold.
To plan construction of the uni
versity he envisioned, Sen. Stan
ford, in the summer of 1886,
brought then-MIT President
Francis Walker and prominent
landscape architect Frederick Law
Olmsted to Palo Alto.
They gave serious thought to
locating the campus in the foot
hills of the Stanford ranch, so as
to take advantage of the mag
nificent view of the Bay, but fi
nally decided to locate the school
in the grainfields below. The
Senator felt the flat site would be

more practical for later expansion.
Olmsted worked out a general
plan for the grounds and build
ings, but it remained for the
yound Boston architect, Charles
Allerton Coolidge, to develop this
concept in the style of his late
mentor, Henry Hobbs Richardson,
considered the most eminent ar
chitect of his time.
Stanford's architectural style is
called Richardsonian Roman
esque, and it follows the European
Romanesque, which is character
ized by rectilinear stone buildings
joined by covered arcades formed
of successive half-circle arches
supported by short columns with
decorated capitals.
The Inner Quad of 12 classroom
buildings — with the central place
reserved for the future Memorial
Church — and three engineering
buildings, Encina Hall for men
and Roble Hall for women, were
ready for the University's opening

on Oct. 1, 1891.
"These long corridors with their
stately pillars," Jordan said at the
dedication, "will have their part
in the student's training. Each
stone in the quadrangle shall
teach its lesson of grace and
genuineness."
President Andrew White of Cor
nell pronounced the Stanford
buildings the most beautiful col
lege architecture in America.
Just before 5 a.m. on the morn
ing of April 18, 1906, the ground
beneath Stanford's new buildings
shook vigorously for nearly a min
ute. The great earthquake of
1906, which resulted in the near
total destruction of downtown San
Francisco, killed two men on
campus and caused millions of
dollars of damage to the young
university.
The ponderous tower of
Memorial Church, with its clocks,
chimes and spire, crashed into the

chancel, and the concussion blew
out the front wall. The rose win
dow and the huge Venetian
mosaic of the Sermon on the
Mount that had graced the facade
lay as rubble in the Inner Quad.
Memorial Arch, the central
structure of the Outer Quad —
100 feet high and decorated with
a frieze depicting the march of
civilization — was damaged be
yond repair. So were a library and
a gymnasium that had been just
short of completion. None of these
were replaced.
Reconstruction cost more than
$2 million. Classes were dismissed
until the fall. Seniors in what has
come to be known as the "Earth
quake Class" were voted to receive
their degrees in May.
It was a setback, but only a
temporary one, for the young uni
versity quickly rebuilt, pursuing
a construction project that was
begun in 1886 and has continued

to the present day.
Construction of the University
has taken place on approximately
5,000 acres reserved by the Board
of Trustees for educational pur
poses. This land is the heart of
the Stanford holdings, running
generally from El Camino to the
Foothills.
The areas designated for "light
use" include the arboretum area
between the Quad and El Camino
and the Foothill lands used for
space-probing antennae and re
search in nuclear physics and bi
ological sciences.
The Inner and Outer Quads oc
cupy 17 acres at the University's
heart. The Inner Quad's 12 class
room buildings, two of which are
now used by the president and
his staff, date from the time the
University opened in 1891. The
Outer Quad was completed in
1903, the same year that
Memorial Church was dedicated.

The size and prominence of
Memorial Church in the Inner
Quad reflects the Stanfords' deep
religious faith, even though they
were followers of no particular
denomination. In the University's
Founding Grant, the Stanfords di
rected the trustees "to have
taught in the University the im
mortality of an all-wise and
benevolent Creator, and that
obedience to His laws is the high
est duty of man."
To serve the widest needs of
the campus community, they
decreed that the church and the
University were to be nonsec
tarian and at no time tied to any
particular denomination.
In the original plans of the Uni
versity, the central site in the
Quad was reserved for the church,
though construction was deferred
for several years. When Sen. Stan
ford died in 1893, his widow or
dered that the church be built as
a memorial to him.
Jane Stanford chose the final
designs for windows and mosaics,
traveling to Italy to approve the
mosaic sketches, and obtaining
papal permission to copy the
Roselli fresco of the "Last Sup
per" in the Sistine Chapel.
The Venetian mosaics that
cover the interior walls are largely
drawn from the Old Testament,
depicting the history of redemp
tion. The largest mosaic, however,
occupying most of the facade of
the church and containing 47 fig
ures, depicts the Sermon on the
Mount.
After the earthquake of 1906,
the structure was completely dis
mantled and rebuilt around a steel
framework. Another set of
mosaics was brought from Venice,
but the 80-foot spire, housing
clocks and chimes, was never
rebuilt.
The campus landmark, 285-foot
Hoover Tower, was dedicated at
the University's 50th anniversary
in 1941. The tower and the ad
joining Lou Henry Hoover Build
ing (opened in 1967) house the

vast documentary collections of
the Hoover Institution on War,
Revolution and Peace — millions
of items that include books, doc
uments, files, manuscripts,
diaries, pamphlets, posters, maps
and photos. The Herbert Hoover
Memorial Building, completed in
1978, honors the former presi
dent's humanitarian works.
Across from Hoover Tower sits
Memorial Hall Auditorium, dedi
cated in 1937. Built primarily
through student contributions as
a memorial to Stanford students
and faculty slain in World War I,
the auditorium also houses
plaques honoring the Stanford
dead of World War 11, the Korean
War and the Vietnam War. The
main auditorium seats 1700 and
the Little Theater seats 200.
Just south of the Quad is White
Memorial Plaza, a 200,000-
square-foot landscaped area
donated to the University by Mr.
and Mrs. Raymond White in mem
ory of their sons. The focal point

of the plaza is a tall, free-form
fountain executed in bronze by
San Francisco sculptor Aristides
Demetrios. Students call it"The
Claw."
The Stanford School of Medi
cine moved from San Francisco
into its present quarters on the
west side of campus in 1959. The
structure, then costing $21 mil
lion, consists of three sections —
the hospital, the outpatient clinics
and the teaching laboratories and
classrooms.
The Stanford Law School has
been housed in Crown Quadrangle
since September 1975, when Pres
ident Ford dedicated the $11.9
million facility. The school con
sists of four buildings: the Robert
Crown Library, which can seat
the entire law student body at the
same time; Frederick I. Richman
Hall, which contains the class
rooms and moot court; the James
Irvine Gallery, which contains the
faculty and student meeting
rooms and lounges; and 600-seat
Kresge Auditorium.
Behind the central campus, the
University operates its science
"farms," the oldest of which is

the Jasper Ridge Biological
Preserve. Rising steeply from
Searsville Lake, the 735-acre
preserve contains a unique asso
ciation of rock ledges and outcrop
pings, oak-dotted savannahs,
chaparral, redwoods, streams and
pools.
The Radioscience Laboratory
conducts at its antenna farm in
the Stanford foothills one of the
most productive and varied pro
grams of ionospheric and inter
planetary radio investigation. Its
scientists made the first radar
contact with the sun.
The most spectacular of the an
tennae, the 70-ton, 150-foot
diameter steel and aluminum
"Dish," has explored the sun,
planets and interplanetary gases
through the use of a radar beam.
The Stanford Linear Ac
celerator Center (SLAC) operates
a two-mile-long atom smasher on
460 acres along Sand Hill Road.
The $114 million machine,
financed by the Atomic Energy
Commission and completed in
1966, fires the tube rather than
whirling protons in circles, as
most atom smashers do.

The remains of Memorial Arch following the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. The 100-foot arch, which
once greeted visitors coming down Palm Drive was beyond repair and never replaced after the quake.
When David Starr Jordan ar
rived at Stanford in the summer
of 1891 to be the University's first
president, he found the country
side enthralling.
"The Santa Clara Valley," he
wrote in his autobiography, "ex
tends southward 50 miles and
more from near the head of San
Francisco Bay. Bounding it on the
southwest rises.. .the Sierra de la
Santa Cruz — 'a misty camp of
mountains pitched tumultuous
ly....
"Immediately behind the Uni
versity estate and forming its
higher background is the wooded
Sierra Morena, its cloak of red
wood, oak and madrona diver
sified by thickets of chemisal. . . .
"On the east, opposing the
green ridges of the Holy Cross,
stretches the long, relatively bar
ren and treeless Sierra del Monte
Diablo."
In this sheltered area 30 miles
south of San Francisco, its favor
able climate assured by its loca
tion between bay and ocean, its
meadows patterned with ancient
oaks, Sen. Leland Stanford and
his wife, Jane, established a uni
versity on the site of their home
in Palo Alto.
The first parcel of land, bought
in 1876, consisted of 650 acres
along San Francisquito Creek.
Subsequent purchases increased
the total to 8250 acres.
All of the Stanfords' land was
deeded to the University in the
school's 1885 Grant of Endowment
with the stipulation that it should
never be sold.
To plan construction of the uni
versity he envisioned, Sen. Stan
ford, in the summer of 1886,
brought then-MIT President
Francis Walker and prominent
landscape architect Frederick Law
Olmsted to Palo Alto.
They gave serious thought to
locating the campus in the foot
hills of the Stanford ranch, so as
to take advantage of the mag
nificent view of the Bay, but fi
nally decided to locate the school
in the grainfields below. The
Senator felt the flat site would be

more practical for later expansion.
Olmsted worked out a general
plan for the grounds and build
ings, but it remained for the
yound Boston architect, Charles
Allerton Coolidge, to develop this
concept in the style of his late
mentor, Henry Hobbs Richardson,
considered the most eminent ar
chitect of his time.
Stanford's architectural style is
called Richardsonian Roman
esque, and it follows the European
Romanesque, which is character
ized by rectilinear stone buildings
joined by covered arcades formed
of successive half-circle arches
supported by short columns with
decorated capitals.
The Inner Quad of 12 classroom
buildings — with the central place
reserved for the future Memorial
Church — and three engineering
buildings, Encina Hall for men
and Roble Hall for women, were
ready for the University's opening

on Oct. 1, 1891.
"These long corridors with their
stately pillars," Jordan said at the
dedication, "will have their part
in the student's training. Each
stone in the quadrangle shall
teach its lesson of grace and
genuineness."
President Andrew White of Cor
nell pronounced the Stanford
buildings the most beautiful col
lege architecture in America.
Just before 5 a.m. on the morn
ing of April 18, 1906, the ground
beneath Stanford's new buildings
shook vigorously for nearly a min
ute. The great earthquake of
1906, which resulted in the near
total destruction of downtown San
Francisco, killed two men on
campus and caused millions of
dollars of damage to the young
university.
The ponderous tower of
Memorial Church, with its clocks,
chimes and spire, crashed into the

chancel, and the concussion blew
out the front wall. The rose win
dow and the huge Venetian
mosaic of the Sermon on the
Mount that had graced the facade
lay as rubble in the Inner Quad.
Memorial Arch, the central
structure of the Outer Quad —
100 feet high and decorated with
a frieze depicting the march of
civilization — was damaged be
yond repair. So were a library and
a gymnasium that had been just
short of completion. None of these
were replaced.
Reconstruction cost more than
$2 million. Classes were dismissed
until the fall. Seniors in what has
come to be known as the "Earth
quake Class" were voted to receive
their degrees in May.
It was a setback, but only a
temporary one, for the young uni
versity quickly rebuilt, pursuing
a construction project that was
begun in 1886 and has continued

to the present day.
Construction of the University
has taken place on approximately
5,000 acres reserved by the Board
of Trustees for educational pur
poses. This land is the heart of
the Stanford holdings, running
generally from El Camino to the
Foothills.
The areas designated for "light
use" include the arboretum area
between the Quad and El Camino
and the Foothill lands used for
space-probing antennae and re
search in nuclear physics and bi
ological sciences.
The Inner and Outer Quads oc
cupy 17 acres at the University's
heart. The Inner Quad's 12 class
room buildings, two of which are
now used by the president and
his staff, date from the time the
University opened in 1891. The
Outer Quad was completed in
1903, the same year that
Memorial Church was dedicated.

The size and prominence of
Memorial Church in the Inner
Quad reflects the Stanfords' deep
religious faith, even though they
were followers of no particular
denomination. In the University's
Founding Grant, the Stanfords di
rected the trustees "to have
taught in the University the im
mortality of an all-wise and
benevolent Creator, and that
obedience to His laws is the high
est duty of man."
To serve the widest needs of
the campus community, they
decreed that the church and the
University were to be nonsec
tarian and at no time tied to any
particular denomination.
In the original plans of the Uni
versity, the central site in the
Quad was reserved for the church,
though construction was deferred
for several years. When Sen. Stan
ford died in 1893, his widow or
dered that the church be built as
a memorial to him.
Jane Stanford chose the final
designs for windows and mosaics,
traveling to Italy to approve the
mosaic sketches, and obtaining
papal permission to copy the
Roselli fresco of the "Last Sup
per" in the Sistine Chapel.
The Venetian mosaics that
cover the interior walls are largely
drawn from the Old Testament,
depicting the history of redemp
tion. The largest mosaic, however,
occupying most of the facade of
the church and containing 47 fig
ures, depicts the Sermon on the
Mount.
After the earthquake of 1906,
the structure was completely dis
mantled and rebuilt around a steel
framework. Another set of
mosaics was brought from Venice,
but the 80-foot spire, housing
clocks and chimes, was never
rebuilt.
The campus landmark, 285-foot
Hoover Tower, was dedicated at
the University's 50th anniversary
in 1941. The tower and the ad
joining Lou Henry Hoover Build
ing (opened in 1967) house the

the Hoover Institution on War,
Revolution and Peace — millions
of items that include books, doc
uments, files, manuscripts,
diaries, pamphlets, posters, maps
and photos. The Herbert Hoover
Memorial Building, completed in
1978, honors the former presi
dent's humanitarian works.
Across from Hoover Tower sits
Memorial Hall Auditorium, dedi
cated in 1937. Built primarily
through student contributions as
a memorial to Stanford students
and faculty slain in World War I,
the auditorium also houses
plaques honoring the Stanford
dead of World War 11, the Korean
War and the Vietnam War. The
main auditorium seats 1700 and
the Little Theater seats 200.
Just south of the Quad is White
Memorial Plaza, a 200,000-
square-foot landscaped area
donated to the University by Mr.
and Mrs. Raymond White in mem
ory of their sons. The focal point

of the plaza is a tall, free-form
fountain executed in bronze by
San Francisco sculptor Aristides
Demetrios. Students call it"The
Claw."
The Stanford School of Medi
cine moved from San Francisco
into its present quarters on the
west side of campus in 1959. The
structure, then costing $21 mil
lion, consists of three sections —
the hospital, the outpatient clinics
and the teaching laboratories and
classrooms.
The Stanford Law School has
been housed in Crown Quadrangle
since September 1975, when Pres
ident Ford dedicated the $11.9
million facility. The school con
sists of four buildings: the Robert
Crown Library, which can seat
the entire law student body at the
same time; Frederick I. Richman
Hall, which contains the class
rooms and moot court; the James
Irvine Gallery, which contains the
faculty and student meeting
rooms and lounges; and 600-seat
Kresge Auditorium.
Behind the central campus, the
University operates its science
"farms," the oldest of which is

the Jasper Ridge Biological
Preserve. Rising steeply from
Searsville Lake, the 735-acre
preserve contains a unique asso
ciation of rock ledges and outcrop
pings, oak-dotted savannahs,
chaparral, redwoods, streams and
pools.

The remains of Memorial Arch following the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. The 100-foot arch, which
once greeted visitors coming down Palm Drive was beyond repair and never replaced after the quake.
When David Starr Jordan ar
rived at Stanford in the summer
of 1891 to be the University's first
president, he found the country
side enthralling.
"The Santa Clara Valley," he
wrote in his autobiography, "ex
tends southward 50 miles and
more from near the head of San
Francisco Bay. Bounding it on the
southwest rises.. .the Sierra de la
Santa Cruz — 'a misty camp of
mountains pitched tumultuous
ly....
"Immediately behind the Uni
versity estate and forming its
higher background is the wooded
Sierra Morena, its cloak of red
wood, oak and madrona diver
sified by thickets of chemisal. . . .
"On the east, opposing the
green ridges of the Holy Cross,
stretches the long, relatively bar
ren and treeless Sierra del Monte
Diablo."
In this sheltered area 30 miles
south of San Francisco, its favor
able climate assured by its loca
tion between bay and ocean, its
meadows patterned with ancient
oaks, Sen. Leland Stanford and
his wife, Jane, established a uni
versity on the site of their home
in Palo Alto.
The first parcel of land, bought
in 1876, consisted of 650 acres
along San Francisquito Creek.
Subsequent purchases increased
the total to 8250 acres.
All of the Stanfords' land was
deeded to the University in the
school's 1885 Grant of Endowment
with the stipulation that it should
never be sold.
To plan construction of the uni
versity he envisioned, Sen. Stan
ford, in the summer of 1886,
brought then-MIT President
Francis Walker and prominent
landscape architect Frederick Law
Olmsted to Palo Alto.
They gave serious thought to
locating the campus in the foot
hills of the Stanford ranch, so as
to take advantage of the mag
nificent view of the Bay, but fi
nally decided to locate the school
in the grainfields below. The
Senator felt the flat site would be

more practical for later expansion.
Olmsted worked out a general
plan for the grounds and build
ings, but it remained for the
yound Boston architect, Charles
Allerton Coolidge, to develop this
concept in the style of his late
mentor, Henry Hobbs Richardson,
considered the most eminent ar
chitect of his time.
Stanford's architectural style is
called Richardsonian Roman
esque, and it follows the European
Romanesque, which is character
ized by rectilinear stone buildings
joined by covered arcades formed
of successive half-circle arches
supported by short columns with
decorated capitals.
The Inner Quad of 12 classroom
buildings — with the central place
reserved for the future Memorial
Church — and three engineering
buildings, Encina Hall for men
and Roble Hall for women, were
ready for the University's opening

on Oct. 1, 1891.
"These long corridors with their
stately pillars," Jordan said at the
dedication, "will have their part
in the student's training. Each
stone in the quadrangle shall
teach its lesson of grace and
genuineness."
President Andrew White of Cor
nell pronounced the Stanford
buildings the most beautiful col
lege architecture in America.
Just before 5 a.m. on the morn
ing of April 18, 1906, the ground
beneath Stanford's new buildings
shook vigorously for nearly a min
ute. The great earthquake of
1906, which resulted in the near
total destruction of downtown San
Francisco, killed two men on
campus and caused millions of
dollars of damage to the young
university.
The ponderous tower of
Memorial Church, with its clocks,
chimes and spire, crashed into the

chancel, and the concussion blew
out the front wall. The rose win
dow and the huge Venetian
mosaic of the Sermon on the
Mount that had graced the facade
lay as rubble in the Inner Quad.
Memorial Arch, the central
structure of the Outer Quad —
100 feet high and decorated with
a frieze depicting the march of
civilization — was damaged be
yond repair. So were a library and
a gymnasium that had been just
short of completion. None of these
were replaced.
Reconstruction cost more than
$2 million. Classes were dismissed
until the fall. Seniors in what has
come to be known as the "Earth
quake Class" were voted to receive
their degrees in May.
It was a setback, but only a
temporary one, for the young uni
versity quickly rebuilt, pursuing
a construction project that was
begun in 1886 and has continued

to the present day.
Construction of the University
has taken place on approximately
5,000 acres reserved by the Board
of Trustees for educational pur
poses. This land is the heart of
the Stanford holdings, running
generally from El Camino to the
Foothills.
The areas designated for "light
use" include the arboretum area
between the Quad and El Camino
and the Foothill lands used for
space-probing antennae and re
search in nuclear physics and bi
ological sciences.
The Inner and Outer Quads oc
cupy 17 acres at the University's
heart. The Inner Quad's 12 class
room buildings, two of which are
now used by the president and
his staff, date from the time the
University opened in 1891. The
Outer Quad was completed in
1903, the same year that
Memorial Church was dedicated.

The size and prominence of
Memorial Church in the Inner
Quad reflects the Stanfords' deep
religious faith, even though they
were followers of no particular
denomination. In the University's
Founding Grant, the Stanfords di
rected the trustees "to have
taught in the University the im
mortality of an all-wise and
benevolent Creator, and that
obedience to His laws is the high
est duty of man."
To serve the widest needs of
the campus community, they
decreed that the church and the
University were to be nonsec
tarian and at no time tied to any
particular denomination.
In the original plans of the Uni
versity, the central site in the
Quad was reserved for the church,
though construction was deferred
for several years. When Sen. Stan
ford died in 1893, his widow or
dered that the church be built as
a memorial to him.
Jane Stanford chose the final
designs for windows and mosaics,
traveling to Italy to approve the
mosaic sketches, and obtaining
papal permission to copy the
Roselli fresco of the "Last Sup
per" in the Sistine Chapel.
The Venetian mosaics that
cover the interior walls are largely
drawn from the Old Testament,
depicting the history of redemp
tion. The largest mosaic, however,
occupying most of the facade of
the church and containing 47 fig
ures, depicts the Sermon on the
Mount.
After the earthquake of 1906,
the structure was completely dis
mantled and rebuilt around a steel
framework. Another set of
mosaics was brought from Venice,
but the 80-foot spire, housing
clocks and chimes, was never
rebuilt.
The campus landmark, 285-foot
Hoover Tower, was dedicated at
the University's 50th anniversary
in 1941. The tower and the ad
joining Lou Henry Hoover Build
ing (opened in 1967) house the

vast documentary collections of
the Hoover Institution on War,
Revolution and Peace — millions
of items that include books, doc
uments, files, manuscripts,
diaries, pamphlets, posters, maps
and photos. The Herbert Hoover
Memorial Building, completed in
1978, honors the former presi
dent's humanitarian works.
Across from Hoover Tower sits
Memorial Hall Auditorium, dedi
cated in 1937. Built primarily
through student contributions as
a memorial to Stanford students
and faculty slain in World War I,
the auditorium also houses
plaques honoring the Stanford
dead of World War 11, the Korean
War and the Vietnam War. The
main auditorium seats 1700 and
the Little Theater seats 200.
Just south of the Quad is White
Memorial Plaza, a 200,000-
square-foot landscaped area
donated to the University by Mr.
and Mrs. Raymond White in mem
ory of their sons. The focal point

of the plaza is a tall, free-form
fountain executed in bronze by
San Francisco sculptor Aristides
Demetrios. Students call it"The
Claw."
The Stanford School of Medi
cine moved from San Francisco
into its present quarters on the
west side of campus in 1959. The
structure, then costing $21 mil
lion, consists of three sections —
the hospital, the outpatient clinics
and the teaching laboratories and
classrooms.

been housed in Crown Quadrangle
since September 1975, when Pres
ident Ford dedicated the $11.9
