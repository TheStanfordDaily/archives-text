# Ethnic groups strive for campus multiculturalism
## 
### Lyzette Settle Editorial staff 
What is multiculturalism? It is
the expression, acceptance and re
spect of different ethnic groups
and their cultures.
Multiculturalism has taken on
a new level of significance at Stan
ford, and many students feel that
the University has not done
enough to achieve multicul
turalism. Some think multicul
tural education at Stanford is, in
the words of Langston Hughes,
"a dream deferred."
To counter what they perceive
as sluggish change within the ad
ministration, various ethnic com
munities have taken it upon them
selves to play a dual role, that of
educator and student. This dual
role is displayed through the
various activities and functions
that each ethnic group performs.
American Indians
Every year the Native Ameri
can community sponsors an an
nual Powwow, the largest such
celebration in California. At this
event, there are various arts and
crafts on display, great food,
drumming and dancing contests
and exhibitions, as well as talk
about Native American history
and culture.
The Stanford American Indian
Organization coordinates the
Powwow and other events. Among
many things, SAIO is pushing for
the University to offer classes on
Native American history, cur
rently missing from the curricu
lum.
The Native American theme
house is Lathrop, located on the
Row, across from Storey House.
This year, 18 people applied for
one resident assistant spot at
Lathrop, and at least 300 people
expressed interest in living at
Lathrop, helping to demonstrate
that the Native American com
munity here at Stanford is a
strong, unified family.
The Native American Cultural
Center, headed by Asst. Dean of

Student Affairs Jim Larrimore, is
located in the Old Union Club
house basement. Anyone with
questions or interested in becom
ing involved with SAIO should go
to the activities center or call 723-
4078.
Chicanos/Latinos
The Chicano community is
strong in its history and culture
and provides many services for its
members and the larger commu
nity.
For example, Barrio Assistance
— led by Chicanos at Stanford —
provides grade school children
with tutoring and college-age big
brothers and sisters. Barrio As

sistance volunteers take the
children trick-or-treating on the
Stanford campus and provide
transportation to and from their
homes for tutoring.
This past year, the Chicano
community began Project
Literacy, a program to help Stan
ford workers who do not speak
English fluently. Students taught
workers the basics of reading,
writing and speaking English.
One of the biggest Chicano an
nual cultural events is Cinco de
Mayo, a celebration full of danc
ing, authentic Mexican food and
music. Another cultural activity
presented by the Chicano/Latino
community is Ballet Folklorico, a

Chicano folk dance group. This
group performs in various resi
dences on campus by invitation.
The Chicano theme house, Casa
Zapata in Stern Hall, features
murals by Resident Fellow Jose
Burciaga and others depicting
Chicano politics, history and cul
ture.
El Centro Chicano is the home
of MEChA (Movimiento Estudian
til Chicano de Aztlan), the polit
ical and social organization rep
resenting the Chicano community,
as well as many other groups.
Asian-Americans
The Asian-American commu
nity provides a variety of social

activities for the Stanford com
munity, such as the Tea House.
The Tea House, located in Wilbur
Hall next to Madera, serves
potstickers, egg rolls, fortune
cookies, tea and the like.
Started in 1987, the Tea House
has quickly become a great place
for not only Asian-American stu
dents to congregate, but also for
all people to come and absorb
some of the Asian culture.
Every year, the Asian American
Students Association provides
such events as a speaker series,
the Lunar New Year Celebration
and the "Rhythm of the Night,"
an all-campus bash.
In addition to planning events,

AASA addresses the political
needs of the Asian-American com
munity. Last year the group
struggled to obtain a tenure-track
Asian-American studies professor,
which the University has agreed
upon.
The Asian-American theme
house is Okada House in Wilbur
Hall. The Asian-American Activ
ities Center can be found on the
second floor of the Old Union
Clubhouse. The director is Rick
Yuen.
African-Americans
The African-American commu
nity highlights their culture
through a number of different or
ganizations. For example,
Kuumba (pronounced Ka-oom
baj, an African dance troupe, per
forms around campus by request.
Kuumba is sponsored by the Com
mittee on Black Performing Arts,
located in Harmony House.
A gospel choir, performing reg
ularly around the Bay Area as
well as on the Stanford campus,
provides students with a good look
into the African-American cul
ture.
Every year the black commu
nity hosts such events as the Mar
tin Luther King Jr. celebration in
January, Black History month in
February and Club Ujamaa — an
all-campus party, set up much like
a casino.
The African-American theme
house is Ujamaa, located in La
gunita Court. The African-
American community also has a
Black Student Union which meets
many of the social and political
needs of African-American stu
dents on the Stanford campus.
The BSU offices are located in
the Black Community Service
Center, also known as the Black
House, next to Bowman Alumni
Center. For more information
about the BSU, call 723-4517 or
go to the Black House. The direc
tor of the Black Community Serv
ices Center is Asst. Dean of Stu
dent Affairs Keith Archuleta.
