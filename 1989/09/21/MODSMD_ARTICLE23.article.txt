Take a Foreign Language Placement Test? If
you have studied a foreign language and plan to
take the same language at Stanford, you need
to take the placement test. Stanford requires all
students to achieve competency in a foreign lan

guage equal to a third-quarter, first-year course
at Stanford. If you wish to demonstrate compe
tency at the level comparable to Stanford's re
quirement, consult the schedule of foreign lan
guage placement tests in the Orientation schedule.
Completion of a third-year course of one foreign
language in high school also fulfills the require
ment. If you have already taken Advanced Place
ment or advanced credit exams, check with the
proper language department to find out if you
are required to take the language test. If you
wish to determine your placement in a language
other than Chinese, French, German, Japanese,
Russian or Spanish, you should visit the respec
tive department office.
