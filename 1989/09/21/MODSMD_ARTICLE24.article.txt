'To, dude, let's, like, blow off
the So Fo Po ho and hit the Co

Then we can hop in the Hoop or
go visit Joe at Go Co, unless he's
nerding out at Mem Chu again."
For those of you who are new
to campus and may have been
assaulted by a stream of monosyl
labic gibberish like the one above,
only to be left wondering just
what sort of new and unusual
drugs the speaker had baen ex
perimenting with, here's a trans
lation of the above quotation from
Stanfordese into English:
"Hey, don't you feel that we
should shirk our academic respon
sibilities, put aside our Soviet
Foreign Policy homework and go
to the Corner Pocket for some
frozen yogurt? Then we might feel
inclined to go fountain-hopping in
the Shumway Fountain near
Green Library, which so strongly
resembles the rim of a basketball
hoop; or failing that, we could visit
Joe out at his Governor's Corner
residence, unless he is spending
Saturday night in Memorial
Church praying again."
Stanford students have devel
oped a language of their own to
describe their campus and life.
Whether out of linguistic laziness
or a warped desire to be hip, they
reduce many words to truncated
one-syllable grunts. Memorial
Church becomes "Mem Chu"
(sounds like a brand of chewing
gum or tobacco, not a place of
God) and Memorial Auditorium is
"Mem Aud."
Whether you as an individual
decide to adopt this particular
idiom is entirely up to you, but
the following listing of acronyms,

phrases may at least help you be

prehending victim of it.

drugs the speaker had baen ex
perimenting with, here's a trans
lation of the above quotation from
Stanfordese into English:
"Hey, don't you feel that we
should shirk our academic respon
sibilities, put aside our Soviet
Foreign Policy homework and go
to the Corner Pocket for some
frozen yogurt? Then we might feel
inclined to go fountain-hopping in
the Shumway Fountain near
Green Library, which so strongly
resembles the rim of a basketball
hoop; or failing that, we could visit
Joe out at his Governor's Corner
residence, unless he is spending
Saturday night in Memorial
Church praying again."
Stanford students have devel
oped a language of their own to
describe their campus and life.
Whether out of linguistic laziness
or a warped desire to be hip, they
reduce many words to truncated
one-syllable grunts. Memorial
Church becomes "Mem Chu"
(sounds like a brand of chewing
gum or tobacco, not a place of
God) and Memorial Auditorium is
"Mem Aud."
