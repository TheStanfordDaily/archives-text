# Tresidder not only looks better — it tastes better too

In past years, Tresidder Union
has rivaled Stern Hall's reputa
tion for prepackaged, institution
alized meals.
But officials at Tresidder prom
ise that a recent change of man
agement, which has already
brought physical changes to the
student union, will also bring a
noticeable increase in the quality
of its food this year.
"We're going to rival restau
rants with our new offerings. We
wanted to get off the treadmill of
institutional food," said Paul
Szczesiul, associate director of
Tresidder.
Tresidder food services
switched management from the
Marriott Corp. to Bon Appetit, a
San Francisco company, Sept. 1.
The changes Bon Appetit is in
stituting range from physical
remodeling to a complete change
in the way some food is prepared
and served.
Michael Bauccio, vice president
of Bon Appetit, said three chefs
will prepare and test new recipes
at The Cafe (formerly named the
Grand Marketplace.)
"We're going to try cooking
some of the food in front for
everyone to see and try a different
international cuisine each week,"
Bauccio said. The decor of The
Cafe has also been remodeled.
Baker Street, the small bake
shop, will have a completely new
serving area and different food of
ferings, including fresh gourmet
salads, deli foods and fro-yo.

Fro-yo's old home, the Corner
Pocket, or Co Po, will concentrate
exclusively on pizza. "The pizza
will be fresh and ready to serve,
no waiting," Szczesiul said.
The Patio Grill, which will still
serve hamburgers hot off the grill,
will have increased hours during
daylight savings time, Bauccio
said.
"We're going to experiment with
keeping it open for dinner on the
weekdays," he said. "We know we
aren't going to be perfect in de
veloping all the changes, but we
are going to keep experimenting
with new ideas that we think will
improve Tresidder."
The Coffee House will remain
relatively unchanged except for
additional menu items. "We didn't
want to disrupt what we thought
was an already effective atmos
phere," Bauccio said.
Szczesiul added that food prices
will not change drastically because
of the increased food quality.
"You're going to get what you pay
for," he said.
For years, students have re
quested that meal cards be ac
cepted for payment at Tresidder.
But students will not be able to
use meal cards at Tresidder be
cause it would not be economical,
Szczesiul said.
"We're not trying to compete
with food service. We're bringing
in food you would normally go off
campus for," he said.
He added that Tresidder might
try offering a meal plan for grad
uate students or others not on a
University meal plan, but that

this type of program would not
go into effect until sometime after
fall quarter.
Returning students will notice
other changes at Tresidder, too.
The Tresidder Express, formerly
The Store, has been renovated and
might appear to resemble an air
port runway inside because of its
limited stock.
The Stanford Bookstore has
taken over operation of the con
venience store and will stock it
with items "from health and
beauty aids to snacks," said
Szczesiul.
Perhaps by spring quarter this
academic year, Tresidder Express
will move to occupy the space for
merly used for the AIR computer
cluster, Szczesiul added.
The recently constructed addi
tion on the second floor of Tres
idder will house the AIR computer
area, previously located
downstairs. A new dining area will
also be included in a renovation
of the downstairs Recreation Cen
ter.
Szczesiul said Bon Appetit was
chosen to operate Tresidder food
services because the company's
nearby office allows managers to
keep personal contact with Tres
idder directors. Such contact was
difficult with The Marriott Corp.,
which operated out of Maryland.
Bon Appetit's excellent reputation
was another reason the company
was selected, he added.
"We started as a bakery in
Haight-Ashbury and grew to be
one of the top caterers in the na
tion," Bauccio said.

Once it is fully stocked Tresidder Express (formerly The Store) will sell everything from health aids
to Hershey bars.
