# Where the official tour dares not go
## Taking the road less traveled 
### 
You've gone on the campus
tour. It took an hour and you saw
some interesting stuff, but there's
an empty feeling in your stomach.
This is partly because you haven't
eaten lunch and partly because
you're sure there's more of Stan
ford to see. Besides, you're going
to be here all year and you need
some places to go.
Do not despair, for there are
many spots the tour guide didn't
show you — places hidden and
some not-so-hidden. Stanford's
campus is sprawling and has
many special attractions worth
seeking out.
The following is a guide to some
of the hidden Stanford. These
places range from gorgeous to just
plain bizarre; most you'll never
see on postcards, but all are worth
seeing at least once. This is only
a partial, subjective listing. Hope
fully, it will set you on the road
to some discoveries of your own.
Hoover Tower
Begin your tour of the hidden
Stanford with a trip to the top of
Hoover Tower. The elevator ride
is great, and once you get to the
top you can see for miles around.
From here you'll spot parts of the
campus you didn't even know ex
isted.
Stanford Mausoleum
A little morbid perhaps, but a
gorgeous structure nonetheless
and worth the trip just to see the
magnificent oak tree that guards
the crypt. While you're here, be
sure to see the Angel of Grief
statue nearby.
Cactus Garden
Right next to the Mausoleum,
this collection of cacti and other
exotic vegetation used to be the
lover's lane of Stanford students.

Now it's a bit overgrown but still
beautiful. Perfect for a romantic
stroll or an afternoon picnic.
The Knoll
This majestic building, looming
in fearsome magnificence on a hill
above the barracks-style Florence
Moore Hall, formerly housed the
University's Department of Music.
Now God only knows what's in
it, but it's certainly one of the
grandest buildings on campus.
Fearless undergraduates tell
stories of spending the night
there.
The Dish
It's hard to miss the big satellite
dish in the foothills behind Stan
ford, but many people miss visit
ing it. Take the path that begins
off Junipero Serra Boulevard
across the street from Lake La
gunita, and it's just a short
(though uphill) walk to the Dish.
There you'll have a beautiful view
of the Bay Area. Another great
place for a picnic; also the best
place on campus to watch the sun
set or rise.
Meyer Library sundecks
Speaking of great places to
watch the sun set, here's the sec
ond best. Stand on the deck that
faces the center of campus and
see the red tile roofs bathed in
the pastels of twilight. Aaah . . .
makes you want to study, or at
least go to the library more often.
Frost Amphitheater
Yep, that's right . . . another
great place for a picnic. You al
ways hear about this place, but
few people ever really go there
unless ;the Dead or some
Windham Hill group is playing a
concert. If one of the gates is open,
walk on in. sit down and read a

book, muse about trivial things,
or just admire the sylvan setting.
And as long as you're here, check
out the adjacent Band Shak (sic).
Home of the infamous Leland
Stanford Junior University
Marching Band and repository of
over 300 street signs from around
the world, this is a stop that no
Stanford visitor should miss.
The Quad at night
If sandstone and red tile start
to bore you, go take a walk
through the Quad after sundown
and see how it takes on a whole
new character. The shadows are
tremendous and the walkways are
simultaneously spooky and ro
mantic.
Mayfield Avenue
Take a leisurely evening stroll
up the avenue from Braun Music
Center to the faculty ghetto.
Majestic fraternities and other
student residences line the street,
casting beautiful green lawns out
to passers-by.
Lagunita Courtyard
This quiet, Edenesque spot will
shatter all your preconceptions
and convictions about dormitory
architecture.
Steam tunnels
We law-abiding citizens have
never actually been down in these
ourselves, but we heard they're
really cool.

Is anybody out there?
While this satellite dish in the hills behind Stanford scans the sky for signals from space, earthlings
keep it company by jogging and picnicking in the surrounding foothills. If you're lucky, you might
get to jog with University President Donald Kennedy, a frequent visitor to the Dish.
