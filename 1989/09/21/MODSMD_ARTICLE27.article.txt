# Bookstore: not just tees, texts
## 
### Mark Weiner 
The first time you go the Stan
ford Bookstore, you'll probably
head straight to the second floor.
There, you'll find just about every
book you'll need for a successful
first quarter here.
But the Stanford Bookstore is
more than a place simply to buy
your textbooks. It's an integral
part of the Stanford community.
Those who operate the non
profit corporation, including such
luminaries as History Prof. Peter
Stansky and Creative Writing Di
rector Nancy Packer, hope to
serve both the intellectual and
purely practical needs of students,
faculty and staff.
Want to buy a Stanford sweat
shirt for the folks back home?
Browse through the Bookstore's
complete clothing line.
Need a calculator for that first
calculus class? Throw your abacus
in the trash and head toward the
back of the first floor.
Yearning for some sweet snack
to satisfy your sweet tooth? Feast
your eyes on the Bookstore's se
lection of candy.
Looking for paper, pens,
notebooks and art supplies? The
Bookstore has them.
The Bookstore, of course, also
is a great place to browse for
books. Carrying approximately
110,000 titles, the Bookstore's ex
cellent selection of both classic
and best-selling fiction, poetry,
non-fiction and academic publica
tions ranks it among the best

bookstores in the area.
If you have the time in your
hectic first-year schedule to read
something other than books for
CIV, the Bookstore offers a gen
erous and discriminating selection
of titles on just about any subject.
(If you don't find what you're
looking for, the Bookstore will or
der it, no matter how obscure the
volume.)
The man responsible for much
of the Bookstore's high quality is
Marketing and Operations Direc
tor Mark Ouimet. Ouimet super
vises the Bookstore's floor
managers and staff, oversees its
marketing projects, organizes its
apprdximately 30 yearly book sig
nings and buys most of the books
you'll find on its first floor.
A graduate of Bishop's Univer
sity in Quebec, Ouimet began
working for the Bookstore 12
years ago "unloading trucks,
stocking notebooks and shelving
pens," and moved through the
ranks to his current position. "I
always wanted to be in the (book)
business," says Ouimet. "I worked
in a bookstore in college and
literature was my major."
Ouimet meets with publishers'
representatives three times each
year to peruse each season's new
offerings and to decide what titles
the Bookstore should carry.
It's an arduous process. Ouimet
estimates he examines 100 to 300
titles each day during these
"buying seasons," which run from
June to September, October to
November and January to April.

During these periods, Ouimet
meets from four to eight hours
each day with representatives
from publishing houses as large
as Random House and as local as
North Point Press.
"My job is to offer the widest
selection of books possible," says
Ouimet. "I let people decide what
they want to read."
"We want to carry a lot of titles
that don't sell in large numbers
but that we feel are important to
carry," he says. "We may not sell
many, but we realize their impor
tance. We like to round out our
collections of books."
The Bookstore will undergo
renovations in the next 18
months, so if you decide not to
transfer, get ready for some
serious changes. Although you
only see two, the Bookstore actu
ally has four floors, half of them
below ground.
If all goes according to plan,
the Bookstore will open these two
currently secret floors within one
and a half years.
"We'll really increase our book
selections," he says. "We're going
to pay particular attention to ac
ademic and scholarly books."
"The whole store is proud of
the way in which we've developed
the book department," says
Ouimet.
"We understand that our pur
pose is to serve the Stanford com
munity," he says. "That sounds
like a slogan, but's it's true. We're
really proud of that."

is a great place to browse for
books. Carrying approximately
110,000 titles, the Bookstore's ex
cellent selection of both classic
and best-selling fiction, poetry,
non-fiction and academic publica
tions ranks it among the best

bookstores in the area.
If you have the time in your
hectic first-year schedule to read
something other than books for
CIV, the Bookstore offers a gen
erous and discriminating selection
of titles on just about any subject.
(If you don't find what you're
looking for, the Bookstore will or
der it, no matter how obscure the
volume.)
The man responsible for much
of the Bookstore's high quality is
Marketing and Operations Direc
tor Mark Ouimet. Ouimet super
vises the Bookstore's floor
managers and staff, oversees its
marketing projects, organizes its
apprdximately 30 yearly book sig
nings and buys most of the books
you'll find on its first floor.
A graduate of Bishop's Univer
sity in Quebec, Ouimet began
working for the Bookstore 12
years ago "unloading trucks,
stocking notebooks and shelving
pens," and moved through the
ranks to his current position. "I
always wanted to be in the (book)
business," says Ouimet. "I worked
in a bookstore in college and
literature was my major."
Ouimet meets with publishers'
representatives three times each
year to peruse each season's new
offerings and to decide what titles
the Bookstore should carry.
It's an arduous process. Ouimet
estimates he examines 100 to 300
titles each day during these
"buying seasons," which run from
June to September, October to
November and January to April.

During these periods, Ouimet
meets from four to eight hours
each day with representatives
from publishing houses as large
as Random House and as local as
North Point Press.
"My job is to offer the widest
selection of books possible," says
Ouimet. "I let people decide what
they want to read."
"We want to carry a lot of titles
that don't sell in large numbers
but that we feel are important to
carry," he says. "We may not sell
many, but we realize their impor
tance. We like to round out our
collections of books."
The Bookstore will undergo
renovations in the next 18
months, so if you decide not to
transfer, get ready for some
serious changes. Although you
only see two, the Bookstore actu
ally has four floors, half of them
below ground.
If all goes according to plan,
the Bookstore will open these two
currently secret floors within one
and a half years.
"We'll really increase our book
selections," he says. "We're going
to pay particular attention to ac
ademic and scholarly books."
"The whole store is proud of
the way in which we've developed
the book department," says
Ouimet.
"We understand that our pur
pose is to serve the Stanford com
munity," he says. "That sounds
like a slogan, but's it's true. We're
really proud of that."
