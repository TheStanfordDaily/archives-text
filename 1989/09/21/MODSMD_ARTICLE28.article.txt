# Treasures in store for visitors at Stanford's museum of art

### Paula Gani 
As you enter the museum
through the cast iron doors, your
footsteps echoing on the mosaic
and tile floor, the first thing you
feel is sunlight on your face,
streaming through the panes on
the ceiling.
You stop and look upward, your
gaze falling on Athena's gleaming
white figure, serenely watching
over the scene with sceptre in hand
and snakes coiled at her feet.
Follow her gaze behind you, just
outside the museum's entrance, to
the stark modernity of Pomodoro's
Cube.
The original Leland Stanford
Jr. Museum was built in 1891
through the efforts of Jane Stan
ford, who wanted the museum to
serve as a memorial to her son.
With architecture borrowed
from the Athens National
Museum, the building was meant
to be structurally distinct from
the rest of the Stanford campus.
By 1905, the year of Jane Stan
ford's death, the museum quad
rangle was second in size only to
New York*B Metropolitan Museum
of Art.
Today's structure encompasses
approximately one-sixth of its
original area of 300,000 square
feet. The 1906 San Francisco
earthquake destroyed not only a
majority of the building, but also
the University's interest in the
upkeep of such a colossal project,
according to Art History Prof.
Emeritus Lorenz Eitner, former
director of the museum.
A group of older adults and
young families gathers in the
lobby awaiting the 2 p.m. tour.
The smiling docent asks a nearby
gentleman if this is his first visit
to Stanford. He nods, looking
about at the paintings and sculp
tures to which he will soon be
introduced. "Fascinating place,"
he says.
The docent program of volun
teer guides is just one of the func
tions of the Committee for Art at
Stanford. Formed in 1953, the
community-based group's original
purpose was to re-open and ex
pand the museum, as well as to

create a greater awareness of art
and increase community partici
pation in museum activities, ac
cording to former committee
Chair Jane Reinhardt.
Ten years later, Eitner's arrival
as head of the Art Department
brought about an intense renova
tion of the museum. Eitner's ded
icated voluntary service as

museum director, in addition to
his work as department chair and
lecturer, would eventually place
Stanford among the nation's top
university art programs.
Eitner retired in August, and
Art Prof. Wanda Corn is serving
as acting museum director until

You can find everything from Zhou dynasty bronzes to European masterpieces in the Leland Stanford
Jr. Museum of Art — provided you get past the lady at the door.

The Rodin sculpture garden contains part of the museum s enor
mous collection of Rodin works — the largest outside of Paris. It's
also a great place to explore at night.
