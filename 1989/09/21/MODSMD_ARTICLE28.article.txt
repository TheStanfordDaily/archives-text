# Treasures in store for visitors at Stanford's museum of art

### Paula Gani 
As you enter the museum
through the cast iron doors, your
footsteps echoing on the mosaic
and tile floor, the first thing you
feel is sunlight on your face,
streaming through the panes on
the ceiling.
You stop and look upward, your
gaze falling on Athena's gleaming
white figure, serenely watching
over the scene with sceptre in hand
and snakes coiled at her feet.
Follow her gaze behind you, just
outside the museum's entrance, to
the stark modernity of Pomodoro's
Cube.
The original Leland Stanford
Jr. Museum was built in 1891
through the efforts of Jane Stan
ford, who wanted the museum to
serve as a memorial to her son.
With architecture borrowed
from the Athens National
Museum, the building was meant
to be structurally distinct from
the rest of the Stanford campus.
By 1905, the year of Jane Stan
ford's death, the museum quad
rangle was second in size only to
New York*B Metropolitan Museum
of Art.
Today's structure encompasses
approximately one-sixth of its
original area of 300,000 square
feet. The 1906 San Francisco
earthquake destroyed not only a
majority of the building, but also
the University's interest in the
upkeep of such a colossal project,
according to Art History Prof.
Emeritus Lorenz Eitner, former
director of the museum.
A group of older adults and
young families gathers in the
lobby awaiting the 2 p.m. tour.
The smiling docent asks a nearby
gentleman if this is his first visit
to Stanford. He nods, looking
about at the paintings and sculp
tures to which he will soon be
introduced. "Fascinating place,"
he says.
The docent program of volun
teer guides is just one of the func
tions of the Committee for Art at
Stanford. Formed in 1953, the
community-based group's original
purpose was to re-open and ex
pand the museum, as well as to

create a greater awareness of art
and increase community partici
pation in museum activities, ac
cording to former committee
Chair Jane Reinhardt.
Ten years later, Eitner's arrival
as head of the Art Department
brought about an intense renova
tion of the museum. Eitner's ded
icated voluntary service as

museum director, in addition to
his work as department chair and
lecturer, would eventually place
Stanford among the nation's top
university art programs.
Eitner retired in August, and
Art Prof. Wanda Corn is serving
as acting museum director until

"Many universities have
museums, but our museum has a
university," begins the docent
proudly. As she goes on to explain
the importance of a museum as
an academic laboratory for art
students, the group enters the Eu
ropean Gallery.
Seeking the artists' names on
the placards below each painting,
you notice that the cards also bear
the names of various donors.
Each item in the museum has
been donated or purchased with
donated funds, independent of
University support. The joint ef
forts of Eitner and the Committee
for Art have made possible the
vast expansion of the museum's
collection.
The committee hosts a biannual
"Treasure Market," in which
donated items of high quality such
as furs, china and jewelry are sold,
Reinhardt says. Proceeds go
toward the purchase of works that
are selected by the director in con
sultation with others associated
with the museum.
"The relative emphasis given to
particluar areas reflects in part
the academic interests of the fac
ulty, staff and students," Eitner
explains. "In addition, there is the

element of chance, that of the
availability of certain works at a
particular time."
The museum's main role is that
of a collecting museum, as op
posed to one hosting temporary
exhibitions. Nonetheless, over 250
exhibitions have been held in both
the museum and gallery.
In the next room the walls and
display cases hold various works
of Asian art — from Shang and
Zhou dynasty bronzes to a life-size
wooden statue of Buddha.
After a successful 25 years of
dedication and volunteer work by
concerned individuals, there are
hopes of further expansion of the
museum, especially with the Cen
tennial Campaign in progress.
Last spring, the University
revised its targeted objectives for
the campaign to include an allo
cation of $6 million to the
museum.
You reach the most famous sec
tion of the museum — the Rodin
wing. A recurring theme of Rodin
is the suffering of humanity.
It is a clear day outside, and a
light breeze enters the open door.
Outside, the sculpture garden
completes the museum's Rodin
collection of well over 150 pieces
— the largest outside of Paris.
The tour ends, and visitors take
their final photographs. "Simply
amazing," says one out-of-town
visitor. "The students here are so
lucky to have all of this."

The tour ends, and visitors take
their final photographs. "Simply
amazing," says one out-of-town
visitor. "The students here are so
lucky to have all of this."

As you enter the museum
through the cast iron doors, your
footsteps echoing on the mosaic
and tile floor, the first thing you
feel is sunlight on your face,
streaming through the panes on
the ceiling.
You stop and look upward, your
gaze falling on Athena's gleaming
white figure, serenely watching
over the scene with sceptre in hand
and snakes coiled at her feet.
Follow her gaze behind you, just
outside the museum's entrance, to
the stark modernity of Pomodoro's
Cube.
The original Leland Stanford
Jr. Museum was built in 1891
through the efforts of Jane Stan
ford, who wanted the museum to
serve as a memorial to her son.
With architecture borrowed
from the Athens National
Museum, the building was meant
to be structurally distinct from
the rest of the Stanford campus.
By 1905, the year of Jane Stan
ford's death, the museum quad
rangle was second in size only to
New York*B Metropolitan Museum
of Art.
Today's structure encompasses
approximately one-sixth of its
original area of 300,000 square
feet. The 1906 San Francisco
earthquake destroyed not only a
majority of the building, but also
the University's interest in the
upkeep of such a colossal project,
according to Art History Prof.
Emeritus Lorenz Eitner, former
director of the museum.
A group of older adults and
young families gathers in the
lobby awaiting the 2 p.m. tour.
The smiling docent asks a nearby
gentleman if this is his first visit
to Stanford. He nods, looking
about at the paintings and sculp
tures to which he will soon be
introduced. "Fascinating place,"
he says.
The docent program of volun
teer guides is just one of the func
tions of the Committee for Art at
Stanford. Formed in 1953, the
community-based group's original
purpose was to re-open and ex
pand the museum, as well as to

create a greater awareness of art
and increase community partici
pation in museum activities, ac
cording to former committee
Chair Jane Reinhardt.
Ten years later, Eitner's arrival
as head of the Art Department
brought about an intense renova
tion of the museum. Eitner's ded
icated voluntary service as

museum director, in addition to
his work as department chair and
lecturer, would eventually place
Stanford among the nation's top
university art programs.
Eitner retired in August, and
Art Prof. Wanda Corn is serving

"Many universities have
museums, but our museum has a
university," begins the docent
proudly. As she goes on to explain
the importance of a museum as
an academic laboratory for art
students, the group enters the Eu
ropean Gallery.
Seeking the artists' names on
the placards below each painting,
you notice that the cards also bear
the names of various donors.
Each item in the museum has
been donated or purchased with
donated funds, independent of
University support. The joint ef
forts of Eitner and the Committee
for Art have made possible the
vast expansion of the museum's
collection.
The committee hosts a biannual
"Treasure Market," in which
donated items of high quality such
as furs, china and jewelry are sold,
Reinhardt says. Proceeds go
toward the purchase of works that
are selected by the director in con
sultation with others associated
with the museum.
"The relative emphasis given to
particluar areas reflects in part
the academic interests of the fac
ulty, staff and students," Eitner
explains. "In addition, there is the

element of chance, that of the
availability of certain works at a
particular time."
The museum's main role is that
of a collecting museum, as op
posed to one hosting temporary
exhibitions. Nonetheless, over 250
exhibitions have been held in both
the museum and gallery.
In the next room the walls and
display cases hold various works
of Asian art — from Shang and
Zhou dynasty bronzes to a life-size
wooden statue of Buddha.
After a successful 25 years of
dedication and volunteer work by
concerned individuals, there are
hopes of further expansion of the
museum, especially with the Cen
tennial Campaign in progress.
Last spring, the University
revised its targeted objectives for
the campaign to include an allo
cation of $6 million to the
museum.
