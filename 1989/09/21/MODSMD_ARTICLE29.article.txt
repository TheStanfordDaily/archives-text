Commonly known as the one
and only, the truly incomparable
Leland Stanford Junior (pause)
University Marching Band, the
group is the world's largest rock
and roll band. Band members,
who clearly are more talented at
entertaining than playing their in
struments, are an off-beat and
wacky bunch.
In 1963 the band became a
student-run organization under
the direction of Music Prof. Ar
thur P. Barnes. By allowing the
students to manage the band, its
style became what it is today —
truly unique.
The music performed by the
band is nearly 100 percent rock
and roll; arrangements are done
by students and Barnes. In other
words, the band has a very un
common sound.
When trying out for the band,
the crucial measuring stick is how
loud members can play. Often
measurements are made, not in
decibels, but on the Richter scale.
Therefore the band, in the tradi
tion of all great rock bands,
produces its music at an earsplit
ting volume.
The style of the band's music
also causes its members to engage
in a strange phenomenon known
as "rocking out," or prancing
foolishly about the field.

There is no such thing as
marching. Infamous half time
field shows are concocted by the
band members during a period
known as SMUT — Stanford
Marching Unit Thinkers — and
that sometimes is all on that is
on their minds. The band's humor
takes stabs at current events, fa
mous people, places, movies and
television, or other trendy topics.
The uniform consists of black
pants, a white shirt with a collar,
white sneakers, a band hat, a band
jacket and the ugliest tie you can
find. Also, unofficial but equally
important is suitable sunwear,
worn discretely under one's uni
form, thus allowing band mem
bers to strip down in the stands
and take advantage of the op
timum tanning hours on game
days.
The Band also plays for many
other Stanford sports, functions,
and goings on. For example the
band played at the 1988 World
Expo in Brisbane, Australia.
While there, the Band played for
the Australian Alumni Associa
tion, and at the U.S. Embassy for
former ambassador Bill Lane.
The Band is a definite part of
the Bay Area, and it performs at
numerous events, whether Stan
ford related or otherwise.
Band members say the time
commitment is the hardest part
about being a member of the
Band. There is almost always
some event to play, even if it is
just annoying people at the late
show of Sunday Flicks.
