# Orientation: The Millie Gong show
## 
### Mica Martin 
Junior Millie Gong didn't spend
this summer cleaning out her
closet or catching up on forgotten
Western Culture reading. Gong's
summer project was a bit more
demanding.
"(It was) the most challenging
job I've ever had," she said.
As the General Coordinator for
New Student Orientation, Gong
heads a staff of ten coordinators
who share in the decisions and
workload of a task that senior
Randy Garland, coordinator of
parent welcoming, labels "a
logistical nightmare."
Planning and coordinating a
six-day event that will involve
1,573 freshmen, 110 transfer stu
dents, 220 Orientation Volunteers,
275 student advising associates,
and countless resident assistants,
resident fellows and faculty ad
visers is a project that involves
many hidden details, all left to
Gong and her staff. "Just reserv
ing the rooms took me a week,"
she says, also recalling her bewil
derment at the task of ordering

enough soda to satisfy everyone
for six days.
As if these details aren't enough
to keep the coordinators busy,
they also have even greater goals
for the event than just keeping
participants sheltered and fed.
Committed to addressing the
deeper, more sensitive issues of
Orientation and establishing the
right atmosphere for freshman,
Gong and her staff have designed
each event to make everyone feel
welcome and further the feeling
of pluralism at Stanford.
"Pluralism says, 'Hey, there are
these differences and these differ
ences are what makes us great,' "
Gong explains, advocating the
term "pluralism" over "diversity"
alone. She says she believes the
term diversity promotes only a
toleration of differences, but
defines pluralism as "a celebra
tion of diversity." Getting this
idea across is a major goal of the
coordinators, a goal they have fo
cused on since first meeting as a
group in April.
Other goals the coordinators
share include defining a sense of

home at Stanford for all students,
personalizing Orientation and
making the new students aware
of all opportunities at Stanford.
According to Gong, the people
who will ultimately make this
happen are the Orientation Vol
unteers. Chosen from an applicant
pool of 370 Stanford students,
Gong describes the OVs as, "really
neat and so diverse." Choosing the
OV staff was extremely difficult
for the coordinators because
"most people who applied would
have done a wonderful job," she
adds.
The coordinators have specifi
cally asked OVs to make at least
one good friend among the fresh
man class, a friendship that would
last beyond Orientation.
Memories of specific OVs from
her own orientation were among
her reasons for choosing to work
on this year's Orientation, Gong
says. She recalls being impressed
by Asian American New Student
Orientation Committee Coordina
tor Jae Choi at the AANSOC ban
quet when she was a freshman.
"I couldn't believe he was a stu

dent," Gong explains. It was at
this banquet that she first felt "a
part of it."
Gong decided to apply for the
position of Orientation Coordina
tor when she realized that, "If I
could bring together that I am
Asian, female, and progressive, I
could help shape all of orienta
tion."
Gong and the other coordina
tors have shaped the Orientation
schedule to include new, inclusive
events, designed to make everyone
feel welcome. She says she is most
excited about the addition of an
activity called "The Theme Street:
Feel the Beat," which will follow
University President Donald Ken
nedy's speech. This event will take
place in the Toyon lounge and
feature a sampling of music, food,
and activities from all ethnic back
grounds.
Gong's months of planning and
behind the scenes work will not
end when Orientation begins. To
survive the week, Gong has set
two goals: to enjoy herself during
Orientation and never regret
taking the job. To accomplish
these goals, Gong says she will
try to interact with the frosh and
has encouraged the OVs to do the
same.
"I wish I could carry lunches
into the Quad," Gong says, noting
how some of the simplest tasks
performed by OVs are memorable
and rewarding.
Besides gaining a general intro
duction to the Stanford campus
and way of life, freshmen make
many important decisions during
their first week. Entwined with
the activities planned by Gong
and her staff are those involving
student advising associates.
Whether it is an idea that comes
from the AAs or OVs, Gong hopes
the freshmen get an important
message from their older peers;
she wants the frosh to know that
"it will be tough and there will
be down time."
This honesty is reflected in
Gong's advice to freshmen for the
next four years: "Stanford is a
great place. It has its problems,
and immense opportunities. It's
all what you put into it. Anything
you want, you can do. You just
have to put the time into it."

Committed to addressing the
deeper, more sensitive issues of
Orientation and establishing the
right atmosphere for freshman,
Gong and her staff have designed
each event to make everyone feel
welcome and further the feeling
of pluralism at Stanford.
"Pluralism says, 'Hey, there are
these differences and these differ
ences are what makes us great,' "
Gong explains, advocating the
term "pluralism" over "diversity"
alone. She says she believes the
term diversity promotes only a
toleration of differences, but
defines pluralism as "a celebra
tion of diversity." Getting this
idea across is a major goal of the
coordinators, a goal they have fo
cused on since first meeting as a
group in April.
Other goals the coordinators
share include defining a sense of

home at Stanford for all students,
personalizing Orientation and
making the new students aware
of all opportunities at Stanford.
According to Gong, the people
who will ultimately make this
happen are the Orientation Vol
unteers. Chosen from an applicant
pool of 370 Stanford students,
Gong describes the OVs as, "really
neat and so diverse." Choosing the
OV staff was extremely difficult
for the coordinators because
"most people who applied would
have done a wonderful job," she
adds.
The coordinators have specifi
cally asked OVs to make at least
one good friend among the fresh
man class, a friendship that would
last beyond Orientation.
Memories of specific OVs from
her own orientation were among
her reasons for choosing to work
on this year's Orientation, Gong
says. She recalls being impressed
by Asian American New Student
Orientation Committee Coordina
tor Jae Choi at the AANSOC ban
quet when she was a freshman.
"I couldn't believe he was a stu

dent," Gong explains. It was at
this banquet that she first felt "a
part of it."
Gong decided to apply for the
position of Orientation Coordina
tor when she realized that, "If I
could bring together that I am
Asian, female, and progressive, I
could help shape all of orienta
tion."
Gong and the other coordina
tors have shaped the Orientation
schedule to include new, inclusive
events, designed to make everyone
feel welcome. She says she is most
excited about the addition of an
activity called "The Theme Street:
Feel the Beat," which will follow
University President Donald Ken
nedy's speech. This event will take
place in the Toyon lounge and
feature a sampling of music, food,
and activities from all ethnic back
grounds.
Gong's months of planning and
behind the scenes work will not
end when Orientation begins. To
survive the week, Gong has set
two goals: to enjoy herself during
Orientation and never regret
taking the job. To accomplish
these goals, Gong says she will
try to interact with the frosh and
has encouraged the OVs to do the
same.
"I wish I could carry lunches
into the Quad," Gong says, noting
how some of the simplest tasks
performed by OVs are memorable
and rewarding.
Besides gaining a general intro
duction to the Stanford campus
and way of life, freshmen make
many important decisions during
their first week. Entwined with
the activities planned by Gong
and her staff are those involving
student advising associates.
Whether it is an idea that comes
from the AAs or OVs, Gong hopes
the freshmen get an important
message from their older peers;
she wants the frosh to know that
"it will be tough and there will
be down time."
This honesty is reflected in
Gong's advice to freshmen for the
next four years: "Stanford is a
great place. It has its problems,
and immense opportunities. It's
all what you put into it. Anything
you want, you can do. You just
have to put the time into it."

Orientation Coordinator Millie Gong has epent all summer ensuring that nobody gets lost and everyone
feels at home.
Junior Millie Gong didn't spend
this summer cleaning out her
closet or catching up on forgotten
Western Culture reading. Gong's
summer project was a bit more
demanding.
"(It was) the most challenging
job I've ever had," she said.
As the General Coordinator for
New Student Orientation, Gong
heads a staff of ten coordinators
who share in the decisions and
workload of a task that senior
Randy Garland, coordinator of
parent welcoming, labels "a
logistical nightmare."
Planning and coordinating a
six-day event that will involve
1,573 freshmen, 110 transfer stu
dents, 220 Orientation Volunteers,
275 student advising associates,
and countless resident assistants,
resident fellows and faculty ad
visers is a project that involves
many hidden details, all left to
Gong and her staff. "Just reserv
ing the rooms took me a week,"
she says, also recalling her bewil
derment at the task of ordering

enough soda to satisfy everyone
for six days.
As if these details aren't enough
to keep the coordinators busy,
they also have even greater goals
for the event than just keeping
participants sheltered and fed.
