# Greek life: It's not just a party, it's an adventure

If you are anticipating Flounder
and the rest of the fabled cast
from Animal House, you have
some misconceptions about fra
ternity and sorority life at Stan
ford.
"The fraternity or sorority ex
perience can really pull together
all areas of the Stanford experi
ence," said Michael Hughes, the
newly appointed fraternal affairs
adviser. "Look at it, ask questions
of members and go beyond the
stereotypes."
Hughes, who was a Phi Sigma
Kappa at Indiana University of
Pennsylvania, is a former frater
nal affairs adviser at the Univer
sity of Georgia and the University
of Tampa in Florida. Most re
cently he worked in residential life
at the University of Southern Cal
ifornia. He replaces Joseph Pisano
in Stanford's administration.
The Stanford Greek system was
established the same year instruc
tion began on the Farm back in
1891. Since that time, the Greek
system, comprised of fraternities
for men and sororities for women,
has become an important part of
campus life and offers numerous
opportunities for student involve

ment. Hughes estimated that 24
percent of undergraduates are
members of a fraternity or
sorority.
"Joining a fraternity is some
thing I always wanted to do," said
Jon Horowitz, a sophomore in
Theta Delta Chi, known as the
Theta Delts. "I feel like I am a
lot more in touch with what is
going on around campus. And we
have a lot of fun."
The primary attraction of the
Greek system is the social oppor
tunities it provides. Parties,
mixers, formals and a common
group of friends come with the
Greek system.
"Mixers and the other social
things are good," Horowitz said.
"But there is plenty of other social
activity at Stanford."
Fraternity members are quick
to point out the many opportuni
ties offered by the Greek system.
"We are involved in a lot of com
munity service, and we really keep
in touch with what is going on
around campus," Horowitz
stressed.
Fraternities and sororities offer
individual academic support, fi
nancial benefits, contacts at other
campuses and with alumni, career
possibilities, community involve
ment, service projects and leader

ship experience.
Because they are self-governed,
fraternities and sororities have to
plan their own events and develop
an effective budget. Most chapters
have about 10 officers.
Typical fraternal activities
range from intramural athletics
to football tailgaters to charity
fundraisers. Sororities are in
volved in many of the same events,
and they often coordinate their
programs with fraternities.
Of course, the biggest event for
the Greek system is Rush, which
takes place during Spring Quarter
at Stanford. The three-week proc
ess of open houses and get
togethers culminates with bid an
nouncements. Stanford sororities
have a guaranteed-bid system so
that anyone who rushes will
receive an invitation to a sorority.
"Rush is a lot of fun," said
Horowitz. "Even if you don't
decide to join a fraternity you get
to meet a lot of guys and have
fun. And there is not a focus on
alcohol."
One of the three weeks of Rush
must be dry, according to Rush
guidelines, and alcohol should not
be the focus of parties during the
other two weeks. The sorority
