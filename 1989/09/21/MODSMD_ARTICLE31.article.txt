## Dating: what to do and where to go 
### Lyzette Settle 
Dating at Stanford is not a very
frequent occurrence; it is a phe
nomenon in and of itself. That is
not to say that dating does not
occur here, only that it is some
what infrequent. Nevertheless, in
the event that it happens to you,
here are a few ideas that might
help you get the ball rolling.
Where and how to meet
You can meet a prospective date
basically anywhere on this
campus: the library, at a party,
in class, in your dorm or just
walking around. The important
thing is establishing contact.
One of the most endearing
things about Stanford students is
that they, for the most part, are
very friendly. This makes it very
easy to approach people. It is okay
to say "hello" to someone or flash
them that winning smile without
feeling foolish. Normally people
will respond with a "hi" and
return your smile.
Now let's use this to our benefit.
You are at a party (or the Co Po,
the library, whatever). You look
across the room and you see
him/her, the person who can fill
the space in your lonely heart.
But how do you approach? Be bold
and remember, when it comes to
meeting people at Stanford, shy
ness is out!
Introduce yourself, say "hi,"
talk about classes, current events,
movies — whatever — just make
contact. Women are especially en
couraged to do this. Society has

taught us that it is the man's role
to pursue the woman or "make
the first move," but this is a myth
whose time has long since passed.
So, GO FOR IT!
Where to go and how to get there
You have asked him/her out and
he/she has accepted. Now what
do you do? Where can you go?
The first thing you must realize
it that it is not necessary to have
a car in order to go out on a date,
so let's discuss other options of
transportation. You can:
a) Have an on-campus date and
use your bike or walk (much more
romantic) to whatever spots you
like.
b) Ride your bikes into down
town Palo Alto and dine at some
of the more casual restaraunts
(i.e. Croutons, Ramona's, Pud
ley's, the Creamery, etc.).
c) Take the bus to whatever hot
spot you choose to visit that eve
ning (you may need to walk to
the Cal Train depot, which is also
the bus depot, in order to catch
the bus if this date is at night).
d) Catch Cal Train to wherever
you wish to explore (San Fran
cisco, San Jose, Berkeley, etc.).
e) Borrow someone's car.
The Bay Area is known for its
many restaurants, so just pull out
the Yellow Pages and pick one.
Try something new, like Indian
or Cuban cuisine.
After dinner, you might want
to go to a movie. There is the
Century 10 Cinema on Shoreline
Drive in Mountain View, right off
101 going south; there are the

Palo Alto Square Theaters, which
are within biking distance from
campus on El Camino Real and
Page Mill Road. You can also
check out the Aquarius and Var
sity theaters in downtown Palo
Alto, located on Emerson Street
and University Avenue respective

In Redwood City, right off of
101 going north, is the Malibu
Castle Fun and Games Park.
Malibu Castle is a recreation cen
ter complete with Grand Prix
style race cars, miniature golf and
an arcade.
This is just a small sampling
of the things that one can do.
Simply do whatever suits you at
the time. Do a little homework,
using your Stanford directory and
the Pacific Bell Yellow Pages as
your textbooks, and be creative.
Some friendly advice
Now that we have discussed the
how to's and where to's of dating
at Stanford, here's some friendly
(and somewhat sisterly) advice:
1) Do not stress about dating.
This is your first year of college

and you will have many dates in
your life, so CHILL!
2) Do not be too quick to step
into an intense relationship. Keep
your options open until you are
sure that a relationship is the best
thing for you.
3) The suggestions given here
do not apply only to heterosexual
people, but also to gay and
bisexual people. Here at Stanford
we have a very strong Gay and
Lesbian Association (GLAS) lo
cated in Old Firehouse. This or
ganization not only provides social
functions (such as happy hours
and dances), but also provides a
strong support network for gay
and bisexual people.
4) Practice safe sex. You are at
the condom capitol of the world.
Take advantage of this. Condoms
can be found in various locations
around campus. There are con
doms at the store, at Cowell Stu
dent Health Center and in various
public bathrooms around campus.
Remember, heterosexual people
your age have the highest risk of
catching AIDS. So, do the right
thing.
5) Finally, I would like to leave
one message with all the ladies
out there. Make sure you know
the guy you are going out with.
Many women your age have been
raped on this campus by men they
have trusted who have looked
"normal." Remember, rapists do
not fit a common profile and most
of the time. So, beware,
But, don't be discouraged by
this advice. Use common sense
and go out there and have fun.
