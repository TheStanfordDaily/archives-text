# What are those green cans for?
## Read this and then recycle it 
### Veronica Parkansky 
The Stanford community is a
child of a culture that glorifies
the modern: food is fast, over
packaged and usually half-eaten.
Paper is high-grade and college
ruled and usually only used on
one side.
The question becomes inevita
ble: What do we do with all the
packaging our modern lives come
in? Since 1977, the Stanford Recy
cling Center has said, "find an
other use for it."
The Recycling Center began as
a SWOPSI class project and was
entirely subsidized by the ASSU
until 1985. Four years ago, the
University took over funding and
now provides the center with an
annual budget of $100,000. Ac
cording to project coordinator
Barb Voss, "Stanford has finally
recognized the center as an im
portant part of its waste manage
ment system."

The center runs as a collective
and although it receives financial
backing from Stanford, the recy
cling program remains fairly au
tonomous from the University.
"We have two full-time student
managers," Voss explains, sitting
in a small trailer that serves as
the center's office. "During the
school year, there are about 20 to
30 students working here
anywhere from 10 to 15 hours per
week."
The students employed by the
center are responsible for sorting
and separating the material that
comes into the site, which
amounts to approximately 10 per
cent of all Stanford's waste. The
paper that arrives here is sorted
by grade, newsprint being the
lowest, and computer paper the
highest.
The students check it for con
tamination by such things as old
lunches and laboratory chemicals
â€” cleanliness always ensures a

higher price.
The paper is sold to two buyers
that hold long-term contracts with
Stanford. The Containing Corpo
ration of America picks up the
newsprint and the Weyerhaeuser
Corp. comes once a week to collect
the high grade paper and
cardboard. From Stanford, the
paper is taken to processing plants
and then to mills. Some of the
paper is later exported to foreign
buyers,
"The problem with paper," Voss
explained tearing apart a piece of
binder paper and exposing the
tiny fibers, "is that it can't be
recycled indefinitely because the
fibers get shorter and shorter.
Aluminum, on the other hand,
could be recycled forever."
The Stanford Recycling Center
staff believes that there will be a
high market for plastics within
the next few years and right now,
the center is trying to find a buyer
who will give them a good price.
