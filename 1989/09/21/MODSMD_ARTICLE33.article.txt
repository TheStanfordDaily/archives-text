# Where to put money that you don't have
## 
### Jennifer Schmid 
Like it or not, one of the
multitude of first-week tasks
for many freshmen is the chore
of choosing a local banking
service.
The Stanford area has
several, with three institutions
having branches or at least an
automated teller machine
(ATM) on campus. In order to
help you clear up the confu
sion, here is a quick guide and
comparison of the banking
services available.
Wells Fargo Bank has both
an on-campus branch office
and an ATM located on the
second floor of Tresidder Un
ion. Wells Fargo offers several
types of checking and savings
accounts, with the following
features:
• ATM Checking. The most
basic type of checking account,
ATM Checking, requires no
minimum balance, yields no
monthly interest and has a flat
monthly service charge of
$3.50, provided all deposits and
withdrawals are made at an
ATM machine. If you make a
deposit or withdrawal inside
the bank, you will be charged
an additional $5 for that
month. ATM Checking gives
you overdraft protection if you
also open a Wells Extra Savings

account or apply for a Wells
Fargo Visa card, a handy fea
ture for students who tend to
overestimate the funds avail
able to them. An additional,
just-for-students feature is that
monthly fees can be waived for
the summer on all student ac
counts.
• Stagecoach Checking. This
checking account requires a
$750 minimum daily balance
with no monthly service charge
and yields no interest. If you
fall below the minimum daily
balance, you will be charged $6
a month; however, you can
avoid this service charge if you
also happen to have a Wel
ls Extra Savings account with a
$2,500 minimum daily balance
in your combined checking and
savings accounts. This means
you could have nothing in your
checking account and $2,500 in
your savings account and still
avoid paying a monthly service
fee, plus you will earn interest
on your savings. The interest
rate ranges from 5.5 percent to
6.1 percent for amounts of
$2,500 or more. An additional
feature of this type of account
is that students arranging to
have direct deposits from their
employers will be able to open
a Stagecoach Checking account
with no minimum daily balance
and no monthly fees.
• Stagecoach Interest Checking.
If you know you will always have
at least $1,500 lying around, this
type of checking account is the
way to go. Stagecoach Interest
Checking will yield interest on all
checking balances compounded
daily with no monthly service
charge, provided there is a mini
mum daily balance of $1,500. If
you should happen to fall below,
however, there is a $9 monthly
service charge. As with the regu
lar Stagecoach Checking, this type
of account can be combined with
a Wells Extra Savings account to
help you avoid the monthly serv
ice charge whenever possible. The
minimum combined daily balance
in this case is $5,000.
• Savings accounts. The savings
accounts at Wells Fargo and Bank
of America are pretty much the
same. Interest rates depend on the
amount deposited unless you open
a regular savings account with a
stable interest rate of 5 percent.
This is pretty standard at any
bank.
Bank of America is a second
option for on-campus banking.
Bank of America's branch office
is located in the Stanford Shop
ping Center next to Neiman-
Marcus, and a Versateller ATM
is located on the second floor of
Tresidder. B of A representatives
will be on campus September 25
and 26 to open new accounts for
those students not willing to trek
out to the mall. Bank of America
offers similar services to those of
Wells Fargo, with more options
including:
• Custom Choice Checking and
Custom Flat Fee Checking. These
two basic checking accounts re
quire an opening minimum
deposit of $100 and neither pays
interest. Custom Flat Fee Check
ing requires no minimum balance
and has a basic monthly service
charge of $6, which makes Wells
Fargo's basic offering a better deal
at $3.50 a month. Custom Choice
Checking will waive all monthly

fees if you keep a minimum daily
balance of $500; otherwise you
will pay a monthly service charge
of $3 plus 30 cents for each check
or cash withdrawal. Depending on
how many transactions you plan
to make, this account could be a
better deal than Wells Fargo's
Stagecoach Checking, plus the
minimum daily balance is lower.
• Custom Interest Checking.
This type of account pays 4 per
cent interest and has no monthly
service charge as long as you keep
at least $1,000 in your account;
otherwise there's a monthly
charge of $8. As with Wells Fargo,
all the monthly fees can be waived
during the summer on student ac
counts.
• Alpha Checking. The counter
part to Stagecoach Checking, this
account has no monthly fee as
long as you keep at least $1,500
in a combination of checking and
savings accounts; otherwise you
will pay a charge of $5. Since the
interest rates earned in each
bank's savings account are
similar, this is a slightly better
way to avoid paying a monthly
service charge.
• Alpha Interest Checking.
Again, this counterpart to
Stagecoach Interest Checking re
quires a lower combined savings
and checking amount ($2,500 in
this case) in order to avoid paying
a $7 monthly service charge.
Overall, if you have at least
$1,000 to deposit, Bank of
America offers a lower minimum
to avoid paying fees; on the other
hand, a student with a dubious
level of funds may be better off
with Wells Fargo's ATM Checking
account. Both banks will issue
credit cards to most students un
less you have a truly horrible
credit past, and having a credit
card can give you overdraft
protection and help build a good
credit history. The manager at
Bank of America said most stu
dents do not wildly overcharge and
run themselves into debt.
The last on-campus banking
service is the Stanford Federal
Credit Union, with an office on
the corner of Serra Street and
Pampas Lane and an ATM on the
second floor of Tresidder. In order

to become a member of the Credit
Union, you need to deposit at least
$50 in a savings account. Since
this is a credit union and not a
bank the interest (dividend) rate
will vary based on the credit union
earnings; the stated anticipated
rate is 5.25 percent.
Once you join the Credit Union
there are two main accounts that
students will probably be inter
ested in. The first of these is
Checking with Dividends, which
requires a $500 balance in order
to avoid a $4 monthly fee and to
earn interest. Again, the dividend
rate may vary, but it is anticipated
at 5 percent. This account starts
earning interest at a balance far
lower than those required by both
Wells Fargo and Bank of America,
plus the fee for a lower balance
is smaller. The drawback is that
access to ATMs is more limited.
If you have $1,500 to spare,
you can open a Money Manage
ment Account. This account pays
interest of about 6.3 percent and
lets you write up to three checks
a month free of charge. If you fall
below $1,500 or write more than
three checks a month, you will be
charged $5 for each extra check
and for a maintenance fee. This
option is a good one only if you
don't need to write a lot of checks
or if you have the money to spare;
otherwise stick with the basic
checking account.
The banks offer freebies such
as frisbees and a pocket thesaurus
to students opening new accounts,
but don't let that keep you from
choosing the best account for you.
Also, be sure to ask questions if
something isn't clear. Good luck!

otherwise stick with the basic
checking account.
The banks offer freebies such
as frisbees and a pocket thesaurus
to students opening new accounts,
but don't let that keep you from
choosing the best account for you.
Also, be sure to ask questions if
something isn't clear. Good luck!
Like it or not, one of the
multitude of first-week tasks
for many freshmen is the chore
of choosing a local banking
service.
The Stanford area has
several, with three institutions
having branches or at least an
automated teller machine
(ATM) on campus. In order to
help you clear up the confu
sion, here is a quick guide and
comparison of the banking
services available.
Wells Fargo Bank has both
an on-campus branch office
and an ATM located on the
second floor of Tresidder Un
ion. Wells Fargo offers several
types of checking and savings
accounts, with the following
features:
• ATM Checking. The most
basic type of checking account,
ATM Checking, requires no
minimum balance, yields no
monthly interest and has a flat
monthly service charge of
$3.50, provided all deposits and
withdrawals are made at an
ATM machine. If you make a
deposit or withdrawal inside
the bank, you will be charged
an additional $5 for that
month. ATM Checking gives
you overdraft protection if you
also open a Wells Extra Savings

account or apply for a Wells
Fargo Visa card, a handy fea
ture for students who tend to
overestimate the funds avail
able to them. An additional,
just-for-students feature is that
monthly fees can be waived for
the summer on all student ac
counts.
• Stagecoach Checking. This
checking account requires a
$750 minimum daily balance
with no monthly service charge
and yields no interest. If you
fall below the minimum daily
balance, you will be charged $6
a month; however, you can
avoid this service charge if you
also happen to have a Wel
ls Extra Savings account with a
$2,500 minimum daily balance
in your combined checking and
savings accounts. This means
you could have nothing in your
checking account and $2,500 in
your savings account and still
avoid paying a monthly service
fee, plus you will earn interest
on your savings. The interest
rate ranges from 5.5 percent to
6.1 percent for amounts of
$2,500 or more. An additional
feature of this type of account
is that students arranging to
have direct deposits from their
employers will be able to open
a Stagecoach Checking account
with no minimum daily balance
and no monthly fees.
• Stagecoach Interest Checking.
If you know you will always have
at least $1,500 lying around, this
type of checking account is the
way to go. Stagecoach Interest
Checking will yield interest on all
checking balances compounded
daily with no monthly service
charge, provided there is a mini
mum daily balance of $1,500. If
you should happen to fall below,
however, there is a $9 monthly
service charge. As with the regu
lar Stagecoach Checking, this type
of account can be combined with
a Wells Extra Savings account to
help you avoid the monthly serv
ice charge whenever possible. The
minimum combined daily balance
in this case is $5,000.
• Savings accounts. The savings
accounts at Wells Fargo and Bank
of America are pretty much the
same. Interest rates depend on the
amount deposited unless you open
a regular savings account with a
stable interest rate of 5 percent.
This is pretty standard at any
bank.
Bank of America is a second
option for on-campus banking.
Bank of America's branch office
is located in the Stanford Shop
ping Center next to Neiman-
Marcus, and a Versateller ATM
is located on the second floor of
Tresidder. B of A representatives
will be on campus September 25
and 26 to open new accounts for
those students not willing to trek
out to the mall. Bank of America
offers similar services to those of
Wells Fargo, with more options
including:
• Custom Choice Checking and
Custom Flat Fee Checking. These
two basic checking accounts re
quire an opening minimum
deposit of $100 and neither pays
interest. Custom Flat Fee Check
ing requires no minimum balance
and has a basic monthly service
charge of $6, which makes Wells
Fargo's basic offering a better deal
at $3.50 a month. Custom Choice
Checking will waive all monthly

fees if you keep a minimum daily
balance of $500; otherwise you
will pay a monthly service charge
of $3 plus 30 cents for each check
or cash withdrawal. Depending on
how many transactions you plan
to make, this account could be a
better deal than Wells Fargo's
Stagecoach Checking, plus the
minimum daily balance is lower.
• Custom Interest Checking.
This type of account pays 4 per
cent interest and has no monthly
service charge as long as you keep
at least $1,000 in your account;
otherwise there's a monthly
charge of $8. As with Wells Fargo,
all the monthly fees can be waived
during the summer on student ac
counts.
• Alpha Checking. The counter
part to Stagecoach Checking, this
account has no monthly fee as
long as you keep at least $1,500
in a combination of checking and
savings accounts; otherwise you
will pay a charge of $5. Since the
interest rates earned in each
bank's savings account are
similar, this is a slightly better
way to avoid paying a monthly
service charge.
• Alpha Interest Checking.
Again, this counterpart to
Stagecoach Interest Checking re
quires a lower combined savings
and checking amount ($2,500 in
this case) in order to avoid paying
a $7 monthly service charge.
Overall, if you have at least
$1,000 to deposit, Bank of
America offers a lower minimum
to avoid paying fees; on the other
hand, a student with a dubious
level of funds may be better off
with Wells Fargo's ATM Checking
account. Both banks will issue
credit cards to most students un
less you have a truly horrible
credit past, and having a credit
card can give you overdraft
protection and help build a good
credit history. The manager at
Bank of America said most stu
dents do not wildly overcharge and
run themselves into debt.
The last on-campus banking
service is the Stanford Federal
Credit Union, with an office on
the corner of Serra Street and
Pampas Lane and an ATM on the
second floor of Tresidder. In order

to become a member of the Credit
Union, you need to deposit at least
$50 in a savings account. Since
this is a credit union and not a
bank the interest (dividend) rate
will vary based on the credit union
earnings; the stated anticipated
rate is 5.25 percent.
Once you join the Credit Union
there are two main accounts that
students will probably be inter
ested in. The first of these is
Checking with Dividends, which
requires a $500 balance in order
to avoid a $4 monthly fee and to
earn interest. Again, the dividend
rate may vary, but it is anticipated
at 5 percent. This account starts
earning interest at a balance far
lower than those required by both
Wells Fargo and Bank of America,
plus the fee for a lower balance
is smaller. The drawback is that
access to ATMs is more limited.
If you have $1,500 to spare,
you can open a Money Manage
ment Account. This account pays
interest of about 6.3 percent and
lets you write up to three checks
a month free of charge. If you fall
below $1,500 or write more than
three checks a month, you will be
charged $5 for each extra check
and for a maintenance fee. This
option is a good one only if you
don't need to write a lot of checks
or if you have the money to spare;
otherwise stick with the basic
checking account.
The banks offer freebies such
as frisbees and a pocket thesaurus
to students opening new accounts,
but don't let that keep you from
choosing the best account for you.

a month free of charge. If you fall
below $1,500 or write more than
three checks a month, you will be
charged $5 for each extra check
and for a maintenance fee. This
option is a good one only if you
don't need to write a lot of checks
or if you have the money to spare;
otherwise stick with the basic
checking account.
The banks offer freebies such
as frisbees and a pocket thesaurus
to students opening new accounts,
but don't let that keep you from
choosing the best account for you.
Also, be sure to ask questions if
something isn't clear. Good luck!
