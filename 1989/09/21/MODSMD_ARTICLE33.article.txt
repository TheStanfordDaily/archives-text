# Where to put money that you don't have

### Jennifer Schmid 
Like it or not, one of the
multitude of first-week tasks
for many freshmen is the chore
of choosing a local banking
service.
The Stanford area has
several, with three institutions
having branches or at least an
automated teller machine
(ATM) on campus. In order to
help you clear up the confu
sion, here is a quick guide and
comparison of the banking
services available.
Wells Fargo Bank has both
an on-campus branch office
and an ATM located on the
second floor of Tresidder Un
ion. Wells Fargo offers several
types of checking and savings
accounts, with the following
features:
• ATM Checking. The most
basic type of checking account,
ATM Checking, requires no
minimum balance, yields no
monthly interest and has a flat
monthly service charge of
$3.50, provided all deposits and
withdrawals are made at an
ATM machine. If you make a
deposit or withdrawal inside
the bank, you will be charged
an additional $5 for that
month. ATM Checking gives
you overdraft protection if you
also open a Wells Extra Savings

account or apply for a Wells
Fargo Visa card, a handy fea
ture for students who tend to
overestimate the funds avail
able to them. An additional,
just-for-students feature is that
monthly fees can be waived for
the summer on all student ac
counts.
• Stagecoach Checking. This
checking account requires a
$750 minimum daily balance
with no monthly service charge
and yields no interest. If you
fall below the minimum daily
balance, you will be charged $6
a month; however, you can
avoid this service charge if you
also happen to have a Wel
ls Extra Savings account with a
$2,500 minimum daily balance
in your combined checking and
savings accounts. This means
you could have nothing in your
checking account and $2,500 in
your savings account and still
avoid paying a monthly service
fee, plus you will earn interest
on your savings. The interest
rate ranges from 5.5 percent to
6.1 percent for amounts of
$2,500 or more. An additional
feature of this type of account
is that students arranging to
have direct deposits from their
employers will be able to open
a Stagecoach Checking account
