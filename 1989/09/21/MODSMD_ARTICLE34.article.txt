# Meet your mentor
## Advisers challenge students' assumptions 
### Martha Brockenbrough Editorial staff 
Your closest contact with a
Stanford staff or faculty member
this year probably won't happen
in a classroom, lecture hall or ad
ministrative office.
Most likely, your best chance to
hobnob with the academic and in
stitutional elite will come in your
dorm dining room, over a helping
of Italian meat loaf, creamed corn
and chocolate milk. Depending on
your adviser's preference, adviser
groups meet from once a week to
once a quarter to discuss academic
life at Stanford.
The summer before they arrive,
freshmen are asked to indicate
their main area of academic in
terest. The Undergraduate Advis
ing Center matches each incoming
student with a similarly-oriented
freshman adviser and a student
advising associate.
"Students need a Socratic Men
tor. , . . They need to challenge
their previous assumptions," said
Andre Sursock, assistant director
of the UAC.
Freshman advisers at Stanford
serve a different function than
high school advisers. "An adviser
in high school knows what courses
students need to take and when
they need to take them. There is
one recipe to get into a place like
Stanford — taking the most chal
lenging menu."
"At Stanford, that menu is
much wider," she said. Freshman

advisers don't know everything
there is to know about Stanford,
Sursock added. "Students have to
take charge of their curriculum
plans."
Sursock said the 275 freshman
advisers volunteer from the fac
ulty and administration because
"they want to be with students."
Most students keep their fresh
man adviser until they declare a
major, although reassignment is
possible in the event of a mis
match, she said.
In addition to assigning incom
ing freshmen to advisers, the UAC
helps students determine possible
majors.
"Many students seek pain
rather than pleasure when they
are choosing courses," Sursock
said. The UAC helps students
make an "inventory of interest,"
using the Courses and Degrees
catalog, she added.
"We narrow it down to three
or four possible majors and sys
tematically explore them for a
year. At the end of the year, most
students are ready to declare (a
m^jor)."

If you are lucky, you might get University President Donald Kennedy
as your freshman adviser this year. Kennedy is one of hundreds
of faculty advisers.
