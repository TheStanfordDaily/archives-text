# Where to go if you're feeling overwhelmed
## 
### 
Orientation Week can make life at
Stanford seem like a luxury cruise. Fun
in the sun and night life that lasts into
the wee hours of the morning.
When you catch on that no one at
Stanford calls anything by its real name,
you feel like you have everything under
control.
But then classes begin. The first time
you go to the basement to wash your
clothes, you realize that someone out
there thinks three washing machines
and one working dryer are enough for
100 people. You come face to face with
the bitter truth. You have nothing clean
to wear and no one can do anything
about it.
It's true that when things quiet down,
you're on your own. But don't despair.
There are plenty of people in and around
the University to give you help when
you need it.
The Dean of Student Affairs Office
(DOSA), located in room 323 of Old
Union, is charged with the welfare of
all students and student families here.
The Housing Center, student volunteer
organizations, physical and mental
health care, child care, residential edu
cation and advising, job placement and
services for disabled students are among
the many student services DOSA coor
dinates. Appointments may be made by
calling 723-2733, but you are encouraged
to just show up.
Residential Education
One of the principal goals of Residen
tial Education is to give students a sup
portive, helpful environment in which to
study, live and conduct the other activ
ities that go with college life.
Although the resident assistants
(RAs) and resident fellows (RFs) in
your dorm may not know the answer
to every question or problem you have,
they probably can point you in the right
direction.
RAs are survivors of the freshman
experience who are there to be steady
"anchors" for you as you go through
your first year on the Farm. RFs are
faculty members who are interested
enough in the residential education proc
ess to live with students.
Academic help
If you need to know about procedures,
the Registrar's Office on the first floor
of Old Union is the place to go. The
office oversees all matters concernine
registration, adding or dropping courses,
grades, Commencement and transcripts.
The Registrar also distributes the "Time
Schedule," the "Information Bulletin"
and the "Summer Session Bulletin,"
handles lost ID cards, and provides
spouse cards.
At times, the pace and rigor of aca
demic life on the Farm can become a
bit overwhelming. So, if you are worried
about losing sleep over your work, here
are some places to help sort things out.

Sweet Hall, between Meyer Library and
Stern Hall, is the place to start. There
you'll find the Center for Teaching and
Learning, where undergraduates and
graduates can find resources in the areas
of study skills, reading rate improvement
and tutoring in many subjects.
If it's papers that make you wish you
had gone to a community college, look
to the Term Paper Advisory Service lo
cated at Meyer Library and the Tutorial
Center in the English Department.
Health
You know that no amount of academic
advising can help when your head aches
and you have a hard time getting up
for your 1:15 p.m. class. Fortunately,
the Cowell Student Health Center is
centrally located and has a 24-hour emer
gency number (723-4861).
Cowell is open on an outpatient basis
Monday through Friday from 9 a.m. to
noon and 1:30 to 5 p.m. It provides a
variety of medical services free of charge
to registered students.
Should you become one of the many
Stanford students who succumb to the
dreaded mononucleosis, Cowell has an
in-house infirmary with 100 beds. You
can stay there up to three months if
necessary, and your friends can visit you
if they dare.
Another service at Cowell is Contra
ceptive Peer Counseling. Trained stu
dents willing to answer your questions
about contraception staff this organiza
tion. They can also field questions about
pregnancy and its problems. Should you
need to consider an abortion, CPC and
Cowell can refer you to a local physician.
Planned Parenthood has an office in
Palo Alto. The people there go out of
their way to make you feel comfortable
and to give you the family planning
information you need.
Counseling
Sometimes, you may just need to talk
to someone. Located in the back of
Cowell is Counseling and Psychological
Services (CAPS). Here you'll find pro
fessionals of all ages and backgrounds
willing to help you get through a rough
spot.
The emphasis at CAPS is not on long
term therapy. The average student uses
CAPS only three or four times, free of
charge. But people at CAPS will gladly
refer you to someone else in the Stanford
area if you need a longer counseling
program.
Another counseling service available
to the Stanford community is The
Bridge. This student-staffed organiza
tion is open five days a week, and live-in
staffers take calls at night.
The students who work at The Bridge
are not professionals. They see their job
as listening to people, not giving advice.
Gay/lesbian/bisexual peer counselors are
also available through The Bridge.
