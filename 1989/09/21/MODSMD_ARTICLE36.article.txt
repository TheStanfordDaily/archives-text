# Go on, ask — it's not that stupid

### 
Have you ever wanted to ask a ques
tion that seemed so dumb that you were
too embarrassed to ask anybody? Sure
you have. In order to keep you from
looking foolish, listed below are some
answers to the most commonly asked
stupid questions about the Farm.
Why is it called a "junior university?"
It's not. Stanford is a university
named after Leland Stanford Jr., son
of railroad magnate and California
Governor Leland Stanford.
How can I get a job on campus?
There's rarely a shortage of employ
ment opportunities at Stanford. Check
the Help Wanted listings in the classi
fied section of The Daily, as well as the
Help Wanted board at the Career Plan
ning and Placement Center. In addition,
University Food Service is almost al
ways hiring (and paying the rather
lucrative University minimum wage), as
are the food service organizations in
Tresidder.
Don't be bound to campus though.
Downtown Palo Alto is only a short bike
ride away.
How the hell do I figure out where my
classes are around here, especially in
the Quad?
The safest thing to do is carry the
current time schedule with you any time
you venture out in search of a class
until you get a feel for the place. Class
entries in the time schedule include class
location, usually in a very cryptic code
that is explained on the inside back

cover of the time schedule. Quad class
room numbers are particularly strange.
Buildings in the Quad are numbered
by tens, beginning with Building One
in the Inner Quad almost directly op
posite the Church, progressing clock
wise around the Inner Quad to Building
110, then jumping to the Outer Quad
and making another clockwise, in
crementally increasing trip around. A
classroom assignment like 50-52 D
means Building 50 in the Quad (right
next to the Church), the second floor
(50-51 would be the first floor), class
room D. Simple enough, right? Right.
What's the best place to study?
This is a very subjective question,
and the answer has to be something of
a personal matter. Top contenders,
though, include Cubberley and Green
Libraries, History Corner and the Med
ical School Library. Cubberley has at
mosphere (huge wooden tables, cozy
wooden chairs, towering bookshelves);
Green has atmosphere and comfort (but
don't go thereof you're even slightly
drowsy, unlessjjjpu plan to study in the
hard wooden chairs of the West or South
Stacks); History Corner has atmos
phere, comfort and privacy (try the
enormous first floor rooms that look
out on the Oval); the Med School Li
brary just has raw intensity.
The University boasts an amazing ar
ray of libraries and other spots for
studying. Sample widely, then settle
down in your favorite.
Why does the University use a tree as

a symbol?
The tree in the Stanford seal is a
representation of a hundred-foot tall
redwood that has stood for centuries at
the corner of what is now the Stanford
campus. Throughout the eighteenth cen
tury, Spanish explorers, missionaries
and soldiers traveling up and down on
El Camino Real used the tree as a
landmark, and called it "Palo Alto,"
Spanish for "high tree."
Leland Stanford took the name for
his Palo Alto Stock Farm, which later
became the grounds of Stanford Uni
versity. Eventually the name passed to
the town which sprang up alongside the
new University.
According to the booklet "Stanford
From the Beginning," the tree was
adopted for the school seal not only
because of its historical significance, but
also "because it symbolizes the strength,
independence and enduring qualities
which a great university must possess."
How do I go about joining the Band or
The Daily or any other campus organ
ization, for that matter?
Most organizations at Stanford are
remarkably accessible to any and all
interested students. The easiest way to
get involved is stop by the organization's
"headquarters" and talk to somebody
who looks like they might know what
they're doing. The Band Shak on Galvez
Avenue is home to the Band; The Daily's
offices are housed in the Storke Student
Publications Building on the corner of
Lomita and Santa Teresa near the Ter
man Engineering Building.

If it's too noisy in your dorm, Meyer Library is a great place to catch a few Z's. And if you wake up, you can even
study there, too.
