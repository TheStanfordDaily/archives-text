# Religious groups flourish on campus
## 
### Lora Dawn Headrick 
A quick glance at the official
Orientation schedule will reveal a
variety of events celebrating the
diverse ethnic and cultural back
grounds of Stanford's student
body. But what about religious
diversity? Stanford is a commu
nity rich in many faiths — why
aren't there Orientation events
highlighting this aspect of student
life?
Pat Brown, a junior and mem
ber of this year's Orientation
Committee, explained, "If we're
going to sponsor an event for the
entire class, we can't hold a spe
cifically religious event."
However, Brown said that it
might be possible to include reli
gious activities in the Orientation
schedule in the years to come.
Such a step would involve the
formation of an orientation com
mittee comprised of members of
the different faiths represented
among Stanford's student body.
"Everything would have to be
planned very carefully. Any event
must be prepared to meet the
needs of everybody with any kind
of religious persuasion."
In the meantime, the Orienta
tion Committee has provided in
its information packets a brochure
that introduces the different reli
gious groups on campus. The
pamphlet, entitled "Religious Life
at Stanford," is published by
Stanford Associated Ministries,
an umbrella organization which
includes 24 different groups rang
ing in diversity from the Chinese
Christian Fellowship at Stanford
to the B'nai B'rith Hillel Foun
dation.
Located in the Old Union Club
house, the SAM office serves as
a clearinghouse to place students
in contact with the different com
munities of faith to which they
belong, or which they would like
to explore.
Many of these religious groups
have planned their own orienta
tion activities. For instance, the
Roman Catholic community at
Stanford is planning a welcoming
Mass for members of the Class of
'93 and their parents, to be held
Sunday, Sept. 24 at 10:30 a.m. in
Kresge Auditorium. The Baha'i
Association, a group devoted to
the teachings of Baha'u'llah, the
founder of the 145-year-old Baha'i
Faith, will have an information
table set up in White Plaza during
registration.

Memorial Church in the inner Quad is spiritual home to many religious communities on campus. It
also makes for an impressive first glimpse of Stanford as you drive down Palm Drive.
