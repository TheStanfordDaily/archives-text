Awareness. Understanding.
Respect. These are the long
sought goals of the Stanford
Women's Center, according to
center coordinator Teri Hopper.
Located at the end of Toyon
Hall's eating club complex, the
center deals with issues that
affect Stanford women and "is
an advocate for all women on
campus," said Hopper, a part
time graduate student.
The Women's Center Collec
tive, a student group that sets
center policy, meets every week
to address women's issues.
Group members share a phi
losophy that is "based on the
attitude that women are worth
standing up for," said Hopper.
Although most collective
members are women, men are
welcome to contribute to the
decision-making process, said
junior Raquel Stote, a collective
member. Decisions are made by
concensus, "not majority rule,"
she said.
"Everyone's opinion is
valued and respected," Stote
added. "There is a diversity of
opinion on issues that affect
women, so the process is some
times slow because we discuss
these differences fully.
"As long as you have the at
titude that men and women are
equal, differences of opinion
can be worked through so that
everyone is satisfied," she said.

The center has a
philosophy
'based on the at
titude that
women are worth
standing up for.'

In past years, the Women's
Center Collective has sponsored
the Rape Education Project
and offered self-defense classes
for women at the center on
weekday evenings. Both proj
ects will continue this year.
The collective also funds stu
dent groups such as Students
Against Sexism and the Pro-
Choice Alliance and "A Wom
an's Guide to Stanford," a pub
lication that offers advice for
women on campus.
The collective lends moral
support to groups such as Body
Image, Food and Self-Esteem,
a program run through The
Bridge, Stanford's peer
counseling center.
Through dorm outreach pro
grams, these student groups
present information and pro
mote student awareness about
campus issues that affect wom
en, said Hopper. "Men and
women are making an earnest
attempt to understand each
other on each other's terms."
