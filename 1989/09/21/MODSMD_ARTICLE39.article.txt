With a new name and recently
announced $6-million endowment,
the Haas Center for Public Service
is ready for business.
Located next to the Campus
Bike Shop, the Public Service Cen
ter begins its fifth year helping
students "get acquainted with the
community while getting their
feet on the ground at Stanford,"
says Sue Gray, coordinator of the
Clearinghouse, which helps stu
dents find service jobs.
"There has been a tremendous
growth each year in the number
of students we see coming through
here," adds Gray. She attributes
the upswing in interest to the over
700 internship and service listings
available for students on com
puter at the Clearinghouse, lo
cated on the first floor of the
center.
"We try to match a student's
interests with different available
opportunities locally, nationally
and internationally," Gray says.
The most popular program is
the Ravenswood-Stanford Tutor
ing Program, with about 300 stu
dents donating their time at five
elementary schools and two
daycare centers last year.
Besides tutoring, other big
group projects are TEAM, in
which Stanford students teach
Physical Education to East Palo
Alto students; Stanford Project on
Nutrition, or SPOON, which

takes leftover dorm food and dis
tributes it to the hungry; Best
Buddies, a program for mentally
handicapped children; and Adopt
a-Grandparent.
To help orient students to vol
unteering opportunities, on Oct.
19 the Clearinghouse will sponsor
a Volunteer Opportunities Fair in
White Plaza which will feature
over 80 service orgainzations in
White Plaza.
On Oct. 4, the Public Service
Center will host an open house so
students can talk to peer advisers
about community service oppor
tunities.
The annual "You Can Make A
Difference" Conference is also run
out of the center. "The goal is to
educate the community on a socie
tal problem and empower them
to act on it,"says Catherine Mil
ton, director of the center.
This January, the conference
will feature education. Last year
over 1500 students and Stanford
community members attended a
several-day conference on the en
vironment.
