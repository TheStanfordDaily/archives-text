# When the radio just won't cut it...
## Tune in to Bay Area music scene 
### Ruben Garcia 
Let's say you're a freshman from
Nowheresville, USA and the only mu
sical acts that ever played your town
were Mel Torme and bargain matinees
of "Hello Dolly" featuring Joan Rivers.
If you're tired of this kind of insipid
entertainment, the Bay Area offers a
variety of opportunities for musical ex
ploration.
You may find yourself rationing your
limited entertainment budget to attend
an arena-style concert one night and a
reggae club the next night. And, if recent
records and tapes are scarce in
Nowheresville (where the local shop is
still trying to sell backstock copies of
Zamfir), a wealth of music outlets dot
the area within a ten mile radius of the
Quad.
Between concerts, clubs, albums and
transportation, you may find yourself
spending more than you should on en
tertainment. Soon, however, your room
mate's music (and singing) will drive
you to pay any price to escape.
But let's face it: you're a freshman,
you have no money, and soon you'll
have less than no money. We'll start
with the free options. If you are abso
lutely strapped for money, Stanford of
fers much free entertainment within
walking distance of your room — or
even inside of it.
Album-oriented rock stations on the
FM dial include KSJO (92.3), KRQR
(97.3), ROME (98.5) and KFOG (104.5).
Top 40 FM stations are KREO (92.9),
KWSS (94.5), KMEL (96.1) and KYUU
(99.7). For modern rock, tune to KITS
(105.3) — better known as LIVE 105.
The only FM alternatives for jazz,
oldies, country western, and classical
music are KJAZ (92.7), KSFO (93.3),
KSAN (94.9), and KKHI (95.7), respec
tively. And if you like your radio station
formatless, diverse, and student-run,
KFJC (89.7) Foothill College, KUSF

(90.3) University of San Francisco, and
Stanford's own KZSU (90.1) are fresh
alternatives. Complete listings of FM
and AM stations will be in the Student
Directory, available in early November.
If you have to "be there," Tresidder
Union often features live acts on the
back patio at lunchtime or in the Coffee
House. These acts range from fully
complemented reggae ensembles to solo
guitar performances and play a diverse
sampling of musical styles from the
whole country. Concerts are sometimes
held in White Plaza as well.
Parties on campus with either live
music or disc jockeys abound every week
except the dreaded Dead and finals
weeks. Campus bands to look for include
the Fugitive Guys, the Ice Weasels,
Cerebral Paisley, the Electric Monks,
and Merv Speigel and the Penguins.
Although some may have disbanded,
there is always a fresh crop of new
bands to take their place within the
first months of school.
If you are considering going to a club,
think long and hard before you do.
Campus parties may be the smartest
route.
First and foremost, campus parties
are free. Most clubs charge exorbitant
admission fees and outrageous drink
prices. All campus parties are in walking
distance, provide free food and drink
and require only a flimsy Stanford ID
for entrance.
Secondly, the Palo Alto club scene is
not very lively or diverse. If you abso
lutely have to go to a club, you have
few options, and even fewer that allow
customers under 21.
East Palo Alto is the place to find
most of the clubs featuring live music
or dancing. Reggae, African, and
Brazilian music are featured at Club
Afrique and Pena Moai, but be prepared
to pay between $4 and $6. The Collins
Club in East Palo Alto is another pos
sibility, but explore it to find out if the

music and atmosphere suits your mood.
The most popular club in Palo Alto
is the Edge (formerly the Vortex) on
California Avenue. Standard disco music
is what you get at the Edge, besides
luminous walls and blinding neon lights.
On the Friday night we visited the Edge,
the cover charge for 21-year-olds was
$4. If you were between 18 and 20 (you
must be at least 18 to enter any club),
that charge shot up to $8. Even if you're
not drinking alcohol, it's not much
cheaper once you get in.
The smart money is spent in San
Francisco, which offers a wider selection
of clubs and more aesthetically pleasing
surroundings. Of course, it is just as
expensive and requires a car, but those
are minor obstacles between you and a
good time. As far as cover price, music,
drinks and environment, the Palladium
is the city's version of the Edge, and
— more importantly — the Palladium
admits patrons who are 18 and over.
If the drive to San Francisco is too
far, or too routine, the San Jose area
(Sunnyvale included) also offers a wide
variety of clubs. Whether you choose to
go north or south on Highway 101 or
280, the pink section of the Sunday San
Francisco Chronicle or the Weekend sec
tion of the San Jose Mercury News will
provide you with the most information.
If you have money (which of course
you don't), a car, or some idea of the
Bay Area's transit system, you can at
tend a number of headline concerts, all
within an hour's drive in any direction.
The Shoreline Amphitheater in
Mountain View is the closest to Stanford
and a very popular venue with top
performers. Notables like Eric Clapton,
Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers,
Bruce Springsteen, Ringo Starr, and
Steve Winwood have played the
Shoreline. Because it is owned by Bay


Ken Beer — Daily file
Jerry and the boys pack Frost Amphitheater each spring during Stanford's two
annual Grateful Dead shows. Along with their roadies, the Dead brings a caravan
of faithful fans who park their Volkswagen vans and set up shop in the Eucalyptus
grove across from Frost.
Area concert mogul Bill Graham,
it attracts the biggest names and
features state-of-the-art facilities.
The park is comprised of
reserved and lawn seating with
large Arabian tents covering the
stage and reserved sections and
video screens to improve the view
of the general admission lawn sec
tion.
The historic Greek Theater in
Berkeley, a 1902 gift of William
Randolph Hearst, is another fine
site for concert viewing. Designed
with the stone bleachers of a sth
century B.C. Athenian theater,
this venue features lawn seating
(avoid it if you can) and an elegant
backdrop.
Oakland is fast becoming the
hot spot for top acts. The Henry
J. Kaiser Pavilion may look like
a high school gym, but it houses
some of the best concerts in the
Bay Area, including R.E.M. and
Keith Richards.
The Oakland Coliseum has
replaced San Francisco's Candles
tick Park (which hosted a 1981
appearance by the Rolling Stones
and the Beatles' last American
concert in 1966) as the arena of
choice for huge rock tours. The
Who played there last August on
an Oakland A's off-night, and the
Rolling Stones will appear there
in November.
Other venues include the Circle
Star Theater in Cupertino (15
minutes south on 280), the Pavil
lion in Concord, the Cow Palace
in San Francisco and even the
Opera House in San Francisco.

Top musical acts like Sade appear regularly at Shoreline Amphi
theater in Mountain View, just a short drive down Highway 101.
