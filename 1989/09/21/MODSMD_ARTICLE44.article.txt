# Tower tops area music stores

Tears for Fears, The Call,
George Benson, 2 Live Crew,
Big Audio Dynamite, Timbuk3,
Thompson Twins, Underworld,
Martin L. Gore, Deborah Harry,
Icehouse and Elton John — even
the jailed James Brown.
All the above have new album
releases — but where should the
discerning Bay Area music shop
per go to avoid the $9.99 record
ripoff or the $16.99 compact disc
at a not-so-compact price?
In the tradition of consumer
advocates like Ralph Nader and
David Horowitz, the following
notes on local audio outlets can
provide some helpful tips on
where to find new and old discs
at rates affordable to starving
college students.
TOWER RECORDS
630 San Antonio Rd.
Mountain View
The biggest can sometimes be
the best, and Tower Records
proves it.
Tower definitely stands above
the rest when it comes to selec
tion. Any new release will ap
pear in Tower virtually the
minute it is released, and hard
to-find discs can usually be
found in the store's endless
shelves. Rock, pop, jazz, new
age, blues, R&B and country can
all be found in plentiful supply
on records, cassettes and com
pact discs.

The biggest can
sometimes be the
best.

Prices range considerably de
pending on the album. The main
price seems to be $8.44 per
record or cassette and $13.99
per compact disc, but records
and cassettes vary in price from
$5 to $10 while CDs run the
gamut from $8 to $16.
Keep an eye out for Tower's
"No Risk Disc" deals, where you
can buy certain albums with the
option to exchange them if they
do not satisfy. Check the store's
"Pulse" magazine as you enter
to see which discs are covered
and what new releases are avail
able.
RAINBOW RECORDS
447 University Ave.
Palo Alto
Following the Rainbow will of
ten lead to a plethora of bargain
line CDs by msgor labels, but
don't expect a new CD to cost
less than $14.95.
Rainbow has the best sales
on bargain compact discs
around, usually one every
month or two. Often, the record
label's bargain-line discs will sell
for $8.99 or $9.99. If you like

to hunt for deals, check Rainbow
every so often.
Similar deals are available on
cassettes, which usually sell for
$8.99. Rainbow does not carry
records.
The Rainbow's selection is
above average, but does not
reach the heights of Tower's.
WHEREHOUSE RECORDS
700 El Camino Real
Menlo Park
Don't put too much faith in
this store's name, since they
don't actually sell records.
Pretend it's called Wherehouse
Cassettes and Compact Discs,
and you should stay happy.
Normal prices at The
Wherehouse equal those at
Rainbow, but the bargain sales
are more scarce. The store has
reasonable deals every so often,
but make sure you check news
paper ads to catch them in time.
The store will often leave the
sale price up after the sale is
over — leaving you at the
counter with a disc that costs
$5 more than you thought.
In addition to the big three,
some other area stores may lead
to good music finds: The Com
pact Disc Warehouse, 456 E. El
Camino Rd., Sunnyvale; Lamb's
Records and Tapes, 2373 Uni
versity Ave., East Palo Alto;
Laser Tracks, 96 Town and
Country Village, Palo Alto; and
West Sounds, 1957 University
Ave., East Palo Alto.
