# Blow off that paper — check out a movie instead
## 
### Mark Tompkins 
Some people at Stanford never
go to the movies, not even the
Flicks. Chances are you won't be
one of them.
Eventually there will come a
Friday or Saturday night when
you won't feel like standing
around at a party, holding one of
those cheesy red plastic cups. On
such an evening, the movies come
in handy.
Actually, going to the movies
takes on a whole new set of
meanings in college. It's a great
bonding experience, so it's the per
fect dorm activity. It's amazing
how people who otherwise can't
stand to be in the same room with
each other are happy to pile into
a car and go see something like,
say, "Road House" together.
The movies also provide a good
topic of conversation on those
slow nights at the dining hall. If
you want to get a really heated
debate going at your dinner table,
skip politics and begin arguing the
merits of Michael Keaton's per
formance as Batman. Since every
body has an opinion on this
subject, the invectives will soon
be flying.
Like anywhere else, moviegoing
at college is a key dating ritual,
but above all, it's the most perfect
way of blowing off work ever in
vented. We're talking pure escape
here — why do all that damn
assigned reading when you could
watch Mel Gibson and Danny
Glover shoot people instead?
If you feel guilty going by your
self, why, be sure to drag your
roommate's GPA down with
yours. During Dead Week, just
casually mention what new
movies are opening that weekend
and then watch temptation worm
its way into your roommate's
brain until he or she is practically
begging you to go see "American
Ninja III" or "Pumpkinhead"
with them.
Since movies will play a large
part in keeping you sane over the
next four years, it's important
that you know what to expect out
of all the local theaters.
The key distinction to be made
here is "going to the movies," as
opposed to "seeing a film." Cali
fornia being California, there are
lots of big, sprawling multiplexes
in our area that show tons of
movies. However, Palo Alto and
Menlo Park are crawling with
overdressed psuedo-intellectuals
who feel obliged to keep up with
all the latest coffee table movies,
and to keep them happy there are
also several Fine Art theaters
within driving range.
The Century 10 Cinema in
Mountain View is the central, un
avoidable fact of life when it comes
to moviegoing at Stanford. The
Century 10 apparently has a
stranglehold on the distribution
of the studio releases; all
the big movies come here, in
35mm, 70mm and Dolby sound,
round-the-clock, year-round. If a
release doesn't come to the

Century 10, that means the vul
tures are circling overhead: that
movie is pretty much gone.
Opened in early 1986. the Cen
tury 10 is quintessential '80s, a
grand exercise in capitalism gone
berserk. It's opulent, expensive
and always, always packed (even
in mid-winter, when they're
taking whatever turkeys they can
get to fill all ten theaters). The
lobby is the size of Rhode Island;
God knows how many square
miles the parking lot covers.
Despite all the space, though,
parking is always a Sisyphean
task. Your roommate, or whatever
poor sap agreed to drive, will drive
around for hours and hours while
you get out to get the tickets. In
fact, the Century 10 has been
called "the airport theater" be
cause of the nifty way you can
drive up, let somebody out to get
in line, and then drive off to look
for parking.
Raymond Chandler once wrote
that California was "the depart
ment store state" with "the most
of everything, and the best of
nothing." A visit to the AMC Old
Mill 6 in Theaters in Mountain
View confirms how right he was.
The Old Mill 6 is truly the "Mul
tiplex From Hell," located in that
most miserable of locales, a failed
shopping mall. Simply put, all the
worst movies open here — about
a week before they come out on
video.
Since the Century 10 swallows
up the promising biggies, all that's
left for the Old Mill 6 are the
barf-o-ramas, the sleazy, cheesy,
teasy disasters that sink without
a trace.
Yes, the AMC Old Mill 6 is an
interesting theater. You should ac
tually go once, just so you can
appreciate the sublime tackiness
of the place, the utter plasticity
and twilight soullessness of it all.
Actually, one can't help but feel
a slight twinge of pride whenever
you're there: the schlocky movies,
the bored teenagers who seem to
run the place, the wildly over
priced neon splendor of the snack
bar — these are what American
culture is all about.
More respectable but less inter
esting is the Palo Alto Square,
conveniently located just a few
blocks down El Camino. A lot of
mainstream movies which some
how sneak past the Century 10
come to Palo Alto Square. They're
not quite must-sees, but they're
not quite the howlers the Old Mill
6 gets either.
The Square doesn't have the
distinct personality that either of
the aforementioned theaters has,
maybe because so many of the
movies that come here ("Hea
thers" excepted) are very bland
and middle-of-the-road. One
thing's for sure, though: when a
hit comes to the Palo Alto Square,
it stays forever. "Crocodile Dun
dee" played there for what seemed
like an entire geological era.
Now we come to the dinky little
art theaters. The Varsity, right
on University Avenue in Palo Alto,

is a luxurious old-style theater
managed by a nice woman named
Hilary Hart, who is always trying
to get more Stanford students to
come there. It seems that no mat
ter what movie is playing, the Var
sity never sells out. (Although
"sex, lies, and videotape" seemed
plenty full this summer — guess
that's what happens when you put
"sex" in the title).
The Varsity was once a reper
tory theater, before home video
killed off repertory theaters, but
it's still a nice place to see foreign
and independent movies. You get
the feeling that the people who
work there care about the movies
they show, which is more than
can be said for the big multiplexes.
Paly High kids must be really

bored, because "The Rocky Hor
ror Picture Show" has-been play
ing at the Varsity on weekends
(at midnight, of course) for ages.
A recent addition to the midnight
bill is the horribly unfunny "Out
rageous Animation Festival."
Speaking of which, there are far
too many copy-cat animation "fes
tivals" floating around these days,
but the original series plays at
the Varsity every fall and is al

ways worth seeing.
The Aquarius (on Emerson, just
off University) is owned by the
same people who run the Varsity.
The Aquarius is actually two
shoebox theaters put side-by-side.
What usually happens is that the
better-known "art" movies come
to the Varsity and the slightly
more obscure stuff comes to the
Aquarius. Once in a while though,
the Aquarius somehow gets a big
hit like "When Harry Met Sally,"
and these are probably what keeps
them in business.
Then there are the Park and
the Guild, both located on El
Camino just a little ways down
in Menlo Park. There's nothing
exactly wrong with the Park and
the Guild; it's just that there's

nothing terribly exciting about
them either. They usually show
foreign movies which appeal to
the serious "Masterpiece
Theater" casualties — polite, ir
relevant little movies which ad
here to the most conservative idea
of what 'good taste' is. Once in a
while a big-league monstrosity
like "Wired" will turn up here.
Even more rarely, a certifiable hit
like "Honey, I Shrunk the Kids"

shows up; the owners must have
made some Faustian pact in order
to keep their theaters afloat.
That pretty much covers the
local theater scene. (Not so long
ago, Palo Alto had at least three
more theaters, but lately they've
been dropping like flies). It's en
tirely possible, however, that some
hardcore movie buffs among you
won't be sated by all the afore
mentioned possibilities, in which
case San Francisco beckons.
There is almost always something
different and unusual playing up
in the city, usually at the Roxie,
the York, the Castro or the Red
Vic. These theaters show the most
interesting and/or bizarre inde
pendents, revivals and foreign
movies.

The Castro deserves special
mention because, before each
screening there, an organist rises
up from the orchestra pit to
serenade the crowd. As you might
imagine, this kind of campy,
theatrical flair goes over well with
the Castro district audience. The
Red Vic is notable not only be
cause it has comfy couches instead
of boring old seats; they also offer
some macrobiotic horror known

as "nutritional yeast" on their
popcorn.
Finally, there are my personal
favorites — the cheapo
grindhouses on Market Street in
San Francisco. These theaters
(the Strand, the Embassy, and an
other winner whose name escapes
me right now) always show all-day
triple bills of recent hits, with a
strong emphasis on the exploita
tion side of things. You pay three
bucks or less to get in (I swear,
it's always Freddy Krueger sitting
in the ticket booth) and can bas
ically stay as long as you want.
We're a long way away from
the Varsity or the Guild: the clien
tele here is a little different,
though no less discriminating.
Someday soon the concession
stands will be offering Night
Train and Thunderbird in small,
medium and large sizes.
One of my single greatest
cinematic experiences came in one
of these theaters this past sum
mer, when I crept in to see the
1988 Clint Eastwood masterwork,
"The Dead Pool." Yes, the movie
had been out on video for months,
but that didn't stop me and a lot
of other die-hard Dirty Harry fans
from going to see a terrible,
chewed-up print of it.
It was the perfect movie for the
Market Street audience: people
whooped with delight whenever
Clint blew somebody away, and
they (we, I guess I should say)
laughed at even the stupidest
lines. Feeling elitist? A trip to one
of these theaters will put you in
touch with a whole new aesthetic.
For those of you who want an
even more palpable atmosphere of
sleaze, I recommend the Pussycat
Theater in San Jose. Some adven
turous hallmates and I once paid
it a visit; we wanted to see a real
live porn pit before X-rated home
video made them all obsolete.
Complete with postings from the
local Board of Health, it's as icky
as you ever imagined a porn
theater would be.
Home video is übiquitous
nowadays, of course; even quite a
few dorms have VCRs now.
There's a problem, though, in that
picking videos for the whole dorm
to watch means picking some
thing everybody will like, which
usually translates into something
everybody has already seen. The
other ways to see movies on
campus are through the Sunday
Flicks (fun, but the well-meaning
ineptitude of the projectionists
gets old really fast) and the in
comparable Tuesday Films series,
which shows movies that you
won't see anywhere else.
As you've probably figured out
by now, there are a lot of theaters
to check out around Stanford. You
may have trouble keeping up with
your class work, so I heartily rec
ommend taking classes in the
Communication Department,
because in some courses you can
actually get credit for seeing
movies — you couldn't ask for a
better deal than that, now could
you?

Some people at Stanford never
go to the movies, not even the
Flicks. Chances are you won't be
one of them.
Eventually there will come a
Friday or Saturday night when
you won't feel like standing
around at a party, holding one of

bonding experience, so it's the per
fect dorm activity. It's amazing
how people who otherwise can't
stand to be in the same room with
each other are happy to pile into
a car and go see something like,
say, "Road House" together.
The movies also provide a good
topic of conversation on those
slow nights at the dining hall. If
you want to get a really heated
debate going at your dinner table,
skip politics and begin arguing the
merits of Michael Keaton's per
formance as Batman. Since every
body has an opinion on this
subject, the invectives will soon
be flying.
Like anywhere else, moviegoing
at college is a key dating ritual,
but above all, it's the most perfect
way of blowing off work ever in
vented. We're talking pure escape
here — why do all that damn
assigned reading when you could
watch Mel Gibson and Danny
Glover shoot people instead?

shoebox theaters put side-by-side.
What usually happens is that the
better-known "art" movies come
to the Varsity and the slightly
more obscure stuff comes to the
Aquarius. Once in a while though,
the Aquarius somehow gets a big
hit like "When Harry Met Sally,"
and these are probably what keeps
them in business.
Then there are the Park and
the Guild, both located on El
Camino just a little ways down
in Menlo Park. There's nothing
exactly wrong with the Park and
the Guild; it's just that there's

nothing terribly exciting about
them either. They usually show
foreign movies which appeal to
the serious "Masterpiece
Theater" casualties — polite, ir
relevant little movies which ad
here to the most conservative idea
of what 'good taste' is. Once in a
while a big-league monstrosity
like "Wired" will turn up here.
Even more rarely, a certifiable hit
like "Honey, I Shrunk the Kids"

shows up; the owners must have
made some Faustian pact in order
to keep their theaters afloat.
That pretty much covers the
local theater scene. (Not so long
ago, Palo Alto had at least three
more theaters, but lately they've
been dropping like flies). It's en
tirely possible, however, that some
hardcore movie buffs among you
won't be sated by all the afore
mentioned possibilities, in which
case San Francisco beckons.
There is almost always something
different and unusual playing up
in the city, usually at the Roxie,
the York, the Castro or the Red
Vic. These theaters show the most
interesting and/or bizarre inde
pendents, revivals and foreign
movies.

The Castro deserves special
mention because, before each
screening there, an organist rises
up from the orchestra pit to
serenade the crowd. As you might
imagine, this kind of campy,
theatrical flair goes over well with
the Castro district audience. The
Red Vic is notable not only be
cause it has comfy couches instead
of boring old seats; they also offer
some macrobiotic horror known

as "nutritional yeast" on their
popcorn.
Finally, there are my personal
favorites — the cheapo
grindhouses on Market Street in
San Francisco. These theaters
(the Strand, the Embassy, and an
other winner whose name escapes
me right now) always show all-day
triple bills of recent hits, with a
strong emphasis on the exploita
tion side of things. You pay three
bucks or less to get in (I swear,
it's always Freddy Krueger sitting
in the ticket booth) and can bas
ically stay as long as you want.
We're a long way away from
the Varsity or the Guild: the clien
tele here is a little different,
though no less discriminating.
Someday soon the concession
stands will be offering Night
Train and Thunderbird in small,
medium and large sizes.
One of my single greatest
cinematic experiences came in one
of these theaters this past sum
mer, when I crept in to see the
1988 Clint Eastwood masterwork,
"The Dead Pool." Yes, the movie
had been out on video for months,
but that didn't stop me and a lot
of other die-hard Dirty Harry fans
from going to see a terrible,
chewed-up print of it.
It was the perfect movie for the
Market Street audience: people
whooped with delight whenever
Clint blew somebody away, and
they (we, I guess I should say)
laughed at even the stupidest
lines. Feeling elitist? A trip to one
of these theaters will put you in
touch with a whole new aesthetic.
For those of you who want an
even more palpable atmosphere of
sleaze, I recommend the Pussycat
Theater in San Jose. Some adven
turous hallmates and I once paid
it a visit; we wanted to see a real
live porn pit before X-rated home
video made them all obsolete.
Complete with postings from the
local Board of Health, it's as icky
as you ever imagined a porn
theater would be.
Home video is übiquitous
nowadays, of course; even quite a
few dorms have VCRs now.
There's a problem, though, in that
picking videos for the whole dorm
to watch means picking some
thing everybody will like, which
usually translates into something
everybody has already seen. The
other ways to see movies on
campus are through the Sunday
Flicks (fun, but the well-meaning
ineptitude of the projectionists
gets old really fast) and the in
comparable Tuesday Films series,
which shows movies that you
won't see anywhere else.
As you've probably figured out
by now, there are a lot of theaters
to check out around Stanford. You
may have trouble keeping up with
your class work, so I heartily rec
ommend taking classes in the
Communication Department,
because in some courses you can
actually get credit for seeing
movies — you couldn't ask for a
better deal than that, now could
you?

Some people at Stanford never
go to the movies, not even the
Flicks. Chances are you won't be
one of them.
Eventually there will come a
Friday or Saturday night when
you won't feel like standing
around at a party, holding one of
those cheesy red plastic cups. On
such an evening, the movies come
in handy.
Actually, going to the movies
takes on a whole new set of
meanings in college. It's a great
bonding experience, so it's the per
fect dorm activity. It's amazing
how people who otherwise can't
stand to be in the same room with
each other are happy to pile into
a car and go see something like,
say, "Road House" together.
The movies also provide a good
topic of conversation on those
slow nights at the dining hall. If
you want to get a really heated
debate going at your dinner table,
skip politics and begin arguing the
merits of Michael Keaton's per
formance as Batman. Since every
body has an opinion on this
subject, the invectives will soon
be flying.
Like anywhere else, moviegoing
at college is a key dating ritual,
but above all, it's the most perfect
way of blowing off work ever in
vented. We're talking pure escape
here — why do all that damn
assigned reading when you could
watch Mel Gibson and Danny
Glover shoot people instead?
If you feel guilty going by your
self, why, be sure to drag your
roommate's GPA down with
yours. During Dead Week, just
casually mention what new
movies are opening that weekend
and then watch temptation worm
its way into your roommate's
brain until he or she is practically
begging you to go see "American
Ninja III" or "Pumpkinhead"
with them.
Since movies will play a large
part in keeping you sane over the
next four years, it's important
that you know what to expect out
of all the local theaters.
The key distinction to be made
here is "going to the movies," as
opposed to "seeing a film." Cali
fornia being California, there are
lots of big, sprawling multiplexes
in our area that show tons of
movies. However, Palo Alto and
Menlo Park are crawling with
overdressed psuedo-intellectuals
who feel obliged to keep up with
all the latest coffee table movies,
and to keep them happy there are
also several Fine Art theaters
within driving range.
The Century 10 Cinema in
Mountain View is the central, un
avoidable fact of life when it comes
to moviegoing at Stanford. The
Century 10 apparently has a
stranglehold on the distribution
of the studio releases; all
the big movies come here, in
35mm, 70mm and Dolby sound,
round-the-clock, year-round. If a
release doesn't come to the

Century 10, that means the vul
tures are circling overhead: that
movie is pretty much gone.
Opened in early 1986. the Cen
tury 10 is quintessential '80s, a
grand exercise in capitalism gone
berserk. It's opulent, expensive
and always, always packed (even
in mid-winter, when they're
taking whatever turkeys they can
get to fill all ten theaters). The
lobby is the size of Rhode Island;
God knows how many square
miles the parking lot covers.
Despite all the space, though,
parking is always a Sisyphean
task. Your roommate, or whatever
poor sap agreed to drive, will drive
around for hours and hours while
you get out to get the tickets. In
fact, the Century 10 has been
called "the airport theater" be
cause of the nifty way you can
drive up, let somebody out to get
in line, and then drive off to look
for parking.
Raymond Chandler once wrote
that California was "the depart
ment store state" with "the most
of everything, and the best of
nothing." A visit to the AMC Old
Mill 6 in Theaters in Mountain
View confirms how right he was.
The Old Mill 6 is truly the "Mul
tiplex From Hell," located in that
most miserable of locales, a failed
shopping mall. Simply put, all the
worst movies open here — about
a week before they come out on
video.
Since the Century 10 swallows
up the promising biggies, all that's
left for the Old Mill 6 are the
barf-o-ramas, the sleazy, cheesy,
teasy disasters that sink without
a trace.
Yes, the AMC Old Mill 6 is an
interesting theater. You should ac
tually go once, just so you can
appreciate the sublime tackiness
of the place, the utter plasticity
and twilight soullessness of it all.
Actually, one can't help but feel
a slight twinge of pride whenever
you're there: the schlocky movies,
the bored teenagers who seem to
run the place, the wildly over
priced neon splendor of the snack
bar — these are what American
culture is all about.
More respectable but less inter
esting is the Palo Alto Square,
conveniently located just a few
blocks down El Camino. A lot of
mainstream movies which some
how sneak past the Century 10
come to Palo Alto Square. They're
not quite must-sees, but they're
not quite the howlers the Old Mill
6 gets either.
The Square doesn't have the
distinct personality that either of
the aforementioned theaters has,
maybe because so many of the
movies that come here ("Hea
thers" excepted) are very bland
and middle-of-the-road. One
thing's for sure, though: when a
hit comes to the Palo Alto Square,
it stays forever. "Crocodile Dun
dee" played there for what seemed
like an entire geological era.
Now we come to the dinky little
art theaters. The Varsity, right
on University Avenue in Palo Alto,

is a luxurious old-style theater
managed by a nice woman named
Hilary Hart, who is always trying
to get more Stanford students to
come there. It seems that no mat
ter what movie is playing, the Var
sity never sells out. (Although
"sex, lies, and videotape" seemed
plenty full this summer — guess
that's what happens when you put
"sex" in the title).
The Varsity was once a reper
tory theater, before home video
killed off repertory theaters, but
it's still a nice place to see foreign
and independent movies. You get
the feeling that the people who
work there care about the movies
they show, which is more than
can be said for the big multiplexes.
Paly High kids must be really

bored, because "The Rocky Hor
ror Picture Show" has-been play
ing at the Varsity on weekends
(at midnight, of course) for ages.
A recent addition to the midnight
bill is the horribly unfunny "Out
rageous Animation Festival."
Speaking of which, there are far
too many copy-cat animation "fes
tivals" floating around these days,
but the original series plays at
the Varsity every fall and is al

ways worth seeing.
The Aquarius (on Emerson, just
off University) is owned by the
same people who run the Varsity.
The Aquarius is actually two
shoebox theaters put side-by-side.
What usually happens is that the
better-known "art" movies come
to the Varsity and the slightly
more obscure stuff comes to the
Aquarius. Once in a while though,
the Aquarius somehow gets a big
hit like "When Harry Met Sally,"
and these are probably what keeps
them in business.
Then there are the Park and
the Guild, both located on El
Camino just a little ways down
in Menlo Park. There's nothing
exactly wrong with the Park and
the Guild; it's just that there's

nothing terribly exciting about
them either. They usually show
foreign movies which appeal to
the serious "Masterpiece
Theater" casualties — polite, ir
relevant little movies which ad
here to the most conservative idea
of what 'good taste' is. Once in a
while a big-league monstrosity
like "Wired" will turn up here.
Even more rarely, a certifiable hit
like "Honey, I Shrunk the Kids"

shows up; the owners must have
made some Faustian pact in order
to keep their theaters afloat.
That pretty much covers the
local theater scene. (Not so long

all the latest coffee table movies,
and to keep them happy there are
also several Fine Art theaters
within driving range.
The Century 10 Cinema in
Mountain View is the central, un
avoidable fact of life when it comes
to moviegoing at Stanford. The
Century 10 apparently has a
stranglehold on the distribution
of the studio releases; all
the big movies come here, in
35mm, 70mm and Dolby sound,
round-the-clock, year-round. If a
release doesn't come to the

Century 10, that means the vul
tures are circling overhead: that
movie is pretty much gone.
Opened in early 1986. the Cen
tury 10 is quintessential '80s, a
grand exercise in capitalism gone
berserk. It's opulent, expensive
and always, always packed (even
in mid-winter, when they're
taking whatever turkeys they can
get to fill all ten theaters). The
lobby is the size of Rhode Island;
God knows how many square
miles the parking lot covers.
Despite all the space, though,
parking is always a Sisyphean
task. Your roommate, or whatever
poor sap agreed to drive, will drive
around for hours and hours while
you get out to get the tickets. In
fact, the Century 10 has been
called "the airport theater" be
cause of the nifty way you can
drive up, let somebody out to get
in line, and then drive off to look
for parking.
Raymond Chandler once wrote
that California was "the depart
ment store state" with "the most
of everything, and the best of
nothing." A visit to the AMC Old
Mill 6 in Theaters in Mountain
View confirms how right he was.
The Old Mill 6 is truly the "Mul
tiplex From Hell," located in that
most miserable of locales, a failed
shopping mall. Simply put, all the
worst movies open here — about
a week before they come out on
video.
Since the Century 10 swallows
up the promising biggies, all that's
left for the Old Mill 6 are the
barf-o-ramas, the sleazy, cheesy,
teasy disasters that sink without
a trace.
Yes, the AMC Old Mill 6 is an
interesting theater. You should ac
tually go once, just so you can
appreciate the sublime tackiness
of the place, the utter plasticity
and twilight soullessness of it all.
Actually, one can't help but feel
a slight twinge of pride whenever
you're there: the schlocky movies,
the bored teenagers who seem to
run the place, the wildly over
priced neon splendor of the snack
bar — these are what American
culture is all about.
More respectable but less inter
esting is the Palo Alto Square,
conveniently located just a few
blocks down El Camino. A lot of
mainstream movies which some
how sneak past the Century 10
come to Palo Alto Square. They're
not quite must-sees, but they're
not quite the howlers the Old Mill
6 gets either.
The Square doesn't have the
distinct personality that either of
the aforementioned theaters has,
maybe because so many of the
movies that come here ("Hea
thers" excepted) are very bland
and middle-of-the-road. One
thing's for sure, though: when a
hit comes to the Palo Alto Square,
it stays forever. "Crocodile Dun
dee" played there for what seemed
like an entire geological era.
Now we come to the dinky little
art theaters. The Varsity, right
on University Avenue in Palo Alto,

is a luxurious old-style theater
managed by a nice woman named
Hilary Hart, who is always trying
to get more Stanford students to
come there. It seems that no mat
ter what movie is playing, the Var
sity never sells out. (Although
"sex, lies, and videotape" seemed
plenty full this summer — guess
that's what happens when you put
"sex" in the title).
The Varsity was once a reper
tory theater, before home video
killed off repertory theaters, but
it's still a nice place to see foreign
and independent movies. You get
the feeling that the people who
work there care about the movies
they show, which is more than
can be said for the big multiplexes.
Paly High kids must be really

bored, because "The Rocky Hor
ror Picture Show" has-been play
ing at the Varsity on weekends
(at midnight, of course) for ages.
A recent addition to the midnight
bill is the horribly unfunny "Out
rageous Animation Festival."
Speaking of which, there are far
too many copy-cat animation "fes
tivals" floating around these days,
but the original series plays at
the Varsity every fall and is al

ways worth seeing.
The Aquarius (on Emerson, just
off University) is owned by the
same people who run the Varsity.
The Aquarius is actually two
shoebox theaters put side-by-side.
What usually happens is that the
better-known "art" movies come
to the Varsity and the slightly
more obscure stuff comes to the
Aquarius. Once in a while though,
the Aquarius somehow gets a big
hit like "When Harry Met Sally,"
and these are probably what keeps
them in business.
Then there are the Park and
the Guild, both located on El
Camino just a little ways down
in Menlo Park. There's nothing
exactly wrong with the Park and
the Guild; it's just that there's

nothing terribly exciting about
them either. They usually show
foreign movies which appeal to
the serious "Masterpiece
Theater" casualties — polite, ir
relevant little movies which ad
here to the most conservative idea
of what 'good taste' is. Once in a
while a big-league monstrosity
like "Wired" will turn up here.
Even more rarely, a certifiable hit
like "Honey, I Shrunk the Kids"

shows up; the owners must have
made some Faustian pact in order
to keep their theaters afloat.
That pretty much covers the
local theater scene. (Not so long
ago, Palo Alto had at least three
more theaters, but lately they've
been dropping like flies). It's en
tirely possible, however, that some
hardcore movie buffs among you
won't be sated by all the afore
mentioned possibilities, in which
case San Francisco beckons.
There is almost always something
different and unusual playing up
in the city, usually at the Roxie,
the York, the Castro or the Red
Vic. These theaters show the most
interesting and/or bizarre inde
pendents, revivals and foreign
movies.

The Castro deserves special
mention because, before each
screening there, an organist rises
up from the orchestra pit to
serenade the crowd. As you might
imagine, this kind of campy,
theatrical flair goes over well with
the Castro district audience. The
Red Vic is notable not only be
cause it has comfy couches instead
of boring old seats; they also offer
some macrobiotic horror known

as "nutritional yeast" on their
popcorn.
Finally, there are my personal
favorites — the cheapo
grindhouses on Market Street in
San Francisco. These theaters
(the Strand, the Embassy, and an
other winner whose name escapes
me right now) always show all-day
triple bills of recent hits, with a
strong emphasis on the exploita
tion side of things. You pay three
bucks or less to get in (I swear,
it's always Freddy Krueger sitting
in the ticket booth) and can bas
ically stay as long as you want.
We're a long way away from
the Varsity or the Guild: the clien
tele here is a little different,
though no less discriminating.
Someday soon the concession
stands will be offering Night
Train and Thunderbird in small,
medium and large sizes.
One of my single greatest
cinematic experiences came in one
of these theaters this past sum
mer, when I crept in to see the
1988 Clint Eastwood masterwork,
"The Dead Pool." Yes, the movie
had been out on video for months,
but that didn't stop me and a lot
of other die-hard Dirty Harry fans
from going to see a terrible,
chewed-up print of it.
It was the perfect movie for the
Market Street audience: people
whooped with delight whenever
Clint blew somebody away, and
they (we, I guess I should say)
laughed at even the stupidest
lines. Feeling elitist? A trip to one
of these theaters will put you in
touch with a whole new aesthetic.
For those of you who want an
even more palpable atmosphere of
sleaze, I recommend the Pussycat
Theater in San Jose. Some adven
turous hallmates and I once paid
it a visit; we wanted to see a real
live porn pit before X-rated home
video made them all obsolete.
Complete with postings from the
local Board of Health, it's as icky
as you ever imagined a porn
theater would be.
Home video is übiquitous
nowadays, of course; even quite a
few dorms have VCRs now.
There's a problem, though, in that
picking videos for the whole dorm
to watch means picking some
thing everybody will like, which
usually translates into something
everybody has already seen. The
other ways to see movies on
campus are through the Sunday
Flicks (fun, but the well-meaning
ineptitude of the projectionists
gets old really fast) and the in
comparable Tuesday Films series,
which shows movies that you
won't see anywhere else.
As you've probably figured out
by now, there are a lot of theaters
to check out around Stanford. You
may have trouble keeping up with
your class work, so I heartily rec
ommend taking classes in the
Communication Department,
because in some courses you can
actually get credit for seeing
movies — you couldn't ask for a
better deal than that, now could
you?

Some people at Stanford never
go to the movies, not even the
Flicks. Chances are you won't be
one of them.
Eventually there will come a
Friday or Saturday night when
you won't feel like standing
around at a party, holding one of
those cheesy red plastic cups. On
such an evening, the movies come
in handy.
Actually, going to the movies
takes on a whole new set of
meanings in college. It's a great
bonding experience, so it's the per
fect dorm activity. It's amazing
how people who otherwise can't
stand to be in the same room with
each other are happy to pile into
a car and go see something like,
say, "Road House" together.
The movies also provide a good
topic of conversation on those
slow nights at the dining hall. If
you want to get a really heated
debate going at your dinner table,
skip politics and begin arguing the
merits of Michael Keaton's per
formance as Batman. Since every
body has an opinion on this
subject, the invectives will soon
be flying.
Like anywhere else, moviegoing
at college is a key dating ritual,
but above all, it's the most perfect
way of blowing off work ever in
vented. We're talking pure escape
here — why do all that damn
assigned reading when you could
watch Mel Gibson and Danny
Glover shoot people instead?
If you feel guilty going by your
self, why, be sure to drag your
roommate's GPA down with
yours. During Dead Week, just
casually mention what new
movies are opening that weekend
and then watch temptation worm
its way into your roommate's
brain until he or she is practically
begging you to go see "American
Ninja III" or "Pumpkinhead"
with them.
Since movies will play a large
part in keeping you sane over the
next four years, it's important
that you know what to expect out
of all the local theaters.
The key distinction to be made
here is "going to the movies," as
opposed to "seeing a film." Cali
fornia being California, there are
lots of big, sprawling multiplexes
in our area that show tons of
movies. However, Palo Alto and
Menlo Park are crawling with
overdressed psuedo-intellectuals
who feel obliged to keep up with
all the latest coffee table movies,
and to keep them happy there are
also several Fine Art theaters
within driving range.

me right now) always show all-day
triple bills of recent hits, with a
strong emphasis on the exploita
tion side of things. You pay three
bucks or less to get in (I swear,
it's always Freddy Krueger sitting
in the ticket booth) and can bas
ically stay as long as you want.
We're a long way away from
the Varsity or the Guild: the clien
tele here is a little different,
though no less discriminating.
Someday soon the concession
stands will be offering Night
Train and Thunderbird in small,
medium and large sizes.
One of my single greatest
cinematic experiences came in one
of these theaters this past sum
mer, when I crept in to see the
1988 Clint Eastwood masterwork,
"The Dead Pool." Yes, the movie
had been out on video for months,
but that didn't stop me and a lot
of other die-hard Dirty Harry fans
from going to see a terrible,
chewed-up print of it.
It was the perfect movie for the
Market Street audience: people
whooped with delight whenever
Clint blew somebody away, and
they (we, I guess I should say)
laughed at even the stupidest
lines. Feeling elitist? A trip to one
of these theaters will put you in
touch with a whole new aesthetic.
For those of you who want an
even more palpable atmosphere of
sleaze, I recommend the Pussycat
Theater in San Jose. Some adven
turous hallmates and I once paid
it a visit; we wanted to see a real
live porn pit before X-rated home
video made them all obsolete.
Complete with postings from the
local Board of Health, it's as icky
as you ever imagined a porn
theater would be.
Home video is übiquitous
nowadays, of course; even quite a
few dorms have VCRs now.
There's a problem, though, in that
picking videos for the whole dorm
to watch means picking some
thing everybody will like, which
usually translates into something
everybody has already seen. The
other ways to see movies on
campus are through the Sunday
Flicks (fun, but the well-meaning
ineptitude of the projectionists
gets old really fast) and the in
comparable Tuesday Films series,
which shows movies that you
won't see anywhere else.
As you've probably figured out
by now, there are a lot of theaters
to check out around Stanford. You
may have trouble keeping up with
your class work, so I heartily rec
ommend taking classes in the
Communication Department,
because in some courses you can
actually get credit for seeing
movies — you couldn't ask for a
better deal than that, now could
you?
