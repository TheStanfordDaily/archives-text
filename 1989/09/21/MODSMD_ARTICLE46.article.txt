# Local eateries serve up a host of delectable delights

Ah, eat, drink and be merry ...
We've heard it so many times
before. But it's only after the
novelty of dorm dining wears off
that we decide to "experience"
good food — and in abundance!
Fortunately, food lovers, the Stan
ford area offers a multitude of
dining opportunities that range
from the cheap and casual to the
upbeat and pricey. With health
food, sushi, French cuisine and
Mexican (just to name a few of
your options) to choose from, it's
easy to find just about whatever
you may be craving — even if it's
pizza topped with coconut and
raisins. (Hint: Try the Applewood
Inn's sweet, but tasty, white piz
za).
Pizza pie
Speaking of pizza, which only
New Yorkers seem to know as
"pies," there are several good
spots for indulging. Topping
everyone's list as the absolute fa
vorite, (but the farthest from
campus) is Frankie, Johnnie &
Luigi Too (939 El Camino Real,
Mountain View). The pizza crust
is divine and the toppings are all
quite good. Expect a wait to be
seated (on weekends) and avoid
the Italian dinners, which don't
even come close to the pizza.
A little closer to home is
Ramona's (541 Ramona St., Palo
Alto) which boasts "New York
style" pizza. Although the pizza
is generally good, it is nothing
like real New York pizza, which
is actually paper thin and would
not come near pineapple and
Canadian bacon for all the pasta
in Italy! Ramona's, nonetheless,
is fairly thick-crusted (opt for the
whole wheat crust) with spicy
sauce and generous toppings.
French spinach adds a unique and
delicious twist. Expect to wait and
to see lots of fellow Stanford stu
dents.
Also downtown is the funky
Pizza-A-Go-Go (335 University
Ave.) that conveniently offers

pizza-by-the-slice. Good crust, not
too spicy sauce, and lots of cheese
— give it a try!
And don't overlook the Ap
plewood Inn (1001 El Camino,
Menlo Park) with its gourmet
pizza toppings. The outside of the
Applewood Inn doesn't look invit
ing. Don't be deceived. The arti
chokes on a veggie combo pizza
make this place special.
Sandwiches and such
The best place around for sand
wiches and other deli items is the
Stanford Delicatessen (83 Stan
ford Shopping Center). The huge
assortment of salads behind the
counter (pasta with shrimp being
a favorite) keeps you busy while
waiting for your number to be
called. Big sandwiches with just
about anything you want — from
turkey on whole wheat to a real
pastrami on rye — are the norm.
A real Stanford tradition is get
ting Togo's (528 University Ave.)
sandwiches for tailgaters, dorm
meetings or just a quick meal.
These heroes/ subs/grinders come
in a variety of sizes to easily feed
the hungry crowds. The vegetar
ian combo is not bad, although
turkey is wonderful as well.
Burgers and fries
When you're in the mood for a
hamburger but just can't stomach
the thought of McDonald's, try
Pudley's (255 University Ave.) or
the Alpine Beer Garden (3915 Al
pine Road, Portola Valley), more
commonly known as Zott's. Zott's
has great french fries and serves
rectangular hamburgers to its
loyal customers. The beer flows
and the jukebox plays on . . .
Health conscious
If you're a healthy eater (and
who isn't these days?), two local
spots will be of interest to you.
First there's Croutons (379 Uni
versity Ave.) where you'll spot
many a Stanford woman . . .
Croutons is a salad bar — a large
salad bar, with just about every
thing you could want on a salad.

They also have soups (not as good
as the salad stuff) and fresh fruit
(always good) and amazing bran
muffins, scones, rye bread and
sourdough ... all for one price,
help-yourself style. Indulge with
out feeling guilty. There is also a
frozen yogurt stand in the front.
Another good choice is The
Good Earth (185 University Ave.)
which even has its own bakery
selection at the counter. Good
soups, hearty sandwiches and
tasty yogurt shakes make this
spot a winner. This place gets
quite crowded at dinner, where
you'll often find a slightly older
crowd than at Croutons.
Wake-me-ups
The absolute best breakfast
place around is Hobee's (67 Town
and Country Village or 4224 El

Camino) with its amazing
blueberry coffeecake and cinna
mon tea — both are truly addic
tive. Hobees's has great omelettes
and egg scrambles, as well as pan
cakes and homemade granola.
Don't mis 3 out on their energy
blends either — yogurt shakes
with fresh strawberries, bananas
or blueberries.
Another old favorite is Late for
the Train (150 Middlefield, Menlo
Park) where pancakes are big and
fluffy and the maple syrup is the
real thing! Scones are a specialty,
French toast is divine, and the
blintzes are delicious. Expect to
wait for seating, especially on the
weekends.
For a quick bite, head to
Suzanne's Muffins (376 Univer
sity) where you can't miss with
the bran bran bran, the oatmeal

chocolate chip, the blueberry, the
apple cinnamon, the corn . . . get
the picture? Another treat is TJ.
Cinnamons (170 University Ave.)
for delicious warm cinnamon rolls
that will absolutely melt in your
mouth. If bagels are your thing,
then The Bagel Works (129 Lyt
ton) is the place to be. It's not an
eatery like the other places, but
a great place to run in and grab
some fresh from the oven and
still-warm chewy bagels.
Sushi anyone?
If hot-tubbing and sushi sound
like a great combination, then
head to Watercourse Way (165
Channing, Palo Alto) where both
are a specialty. Reservations may
be needed for the hot-tub rooms
next door ....
One of the best sushi spots

around is Miyake (261 Universi
ty) where the food is good and
not too expensive. On the pricey
side is Fuki-Sushi (4119 El
Camino) with a full sushi bar and
Tatami rooms.
For a little action with your
sushi, try Shogun (4390 El
Camino, Los Altos) where skilled
Japanese knife-artists prepare
food for you on your table.
Chinese proverbs
Although Chinatown in San
Francisco can't be beat, the Palo
Alto area boasts many of its own
fine Chinese restaurants. One fa
vorite is the often overlooked
China Delight (3691 El Camino)
which has amazing hunan chicken
and a great mushu chicken, pork,
shrimp or eggs. It's never
crowded, has good service and
tons of food — what more could
you ask?
If cheap is what you're looking
for, then Chung King Royal (2209
El Camino) is the place. Don't
worry, the food is good and plenti
ful. And you can even ride your
bike there. But don't expect lavish
surroundings.
An old Stanford favorite is Chef
Chu's (1067 N. San Antonio Rd.,
at El Camino Real, Los Altos).
It's always crowded and a good
place for big groups who have dif
ferent tastes. The food is good, if
unexciting.
Another favorite is the Szec
huan/Hunan restaurant Jing-
Jing's (443 Emerson, Palo Alto),
which is within biking distance.
Try the hot and sour soup for a
super taste sensation! Also a
stone's throw away from campus
is King Chuan (75 Town and
Country Village) which offers
many dishes for the vegetarian
palate, as well as Szechuan and
Peking specialties.
French finds
For excellent crepes and pretty
outdoor dining, try Le Mersault
(651 Emerson St.), "Palo Alto's

Eateries like Cenzo's Italian restaurant on University Avenue provide a welcome refuge from the
culinary catastrophes of University Food Service.
