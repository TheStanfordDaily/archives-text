# Journey to the lair of the Bears

### Kathy Lachenauer Lori Silver 
For one day, we undertook a
dangerous mission. We crossed
enemy lines, ventured into un
chartered territory. For one day,
we became Weenies.
Because it'll be a while before
most freshmen leave plush Palo
Alto and scout out the enemy
across the Bay, we traveled in
cognito to discover the real UC-
Berkeley for them.
Driving up Telegraph Avenue,
Cal's equivalent of Palm Drive,
we immediately saw a striking
difference between the two cam
puses.
We thought we had entered
the Twilight Zone. The spirit of
the 1960s is very much alive
and well at Cal. In contrast to
scenic Palm Drive with its gor
geous view of Mem Chu,
Telegraph is lined with hippies
selling tie-dyed T-shirts and
with students hurrying to their
classes. (Cal has been in session
for a while now).
Perched at the top of
Telegraph is Sather Gate, a
large copper arch marking the
official entrance to Weenieland.
Sather Gate is the famous site
of most of the Cal riots
in the '60s.
Silly us; we thought the '60s

Although we're
too mature to
stereotype all
Weenies, we
found that Cal
students met our
expectations.

were over. Unfortunately no one
told this to Cal students — ob
viously a deficiency in their ed
ucation.
Although we're too mature to
stereotype all Weenies, we found
that Cal students met our ex
pectations. During our walk we
passed three Hare Krishnas,
enough punkers to fill a Dead
Kennedys concert and five dazed
students celebrating Guy
Fawkes Day.
Lost and a little freaked out,
we longed for a familiar sight
— anything to help us escape
from Bezerkeley . . . oops,
Berkeley. A fro yo shop on
Durant Street seemed ready to
offer us refuge.
Yogurt Village turned out to

be a fro yo lover's paradise. With
six exotic flavors, millions of
toppings and an enormous serv
ing for only 90 cents, the shop
gave us the will to continue our
mission.
Next stop on our quest to un
cover the essence of Cal was an
actual sorority house. Unlike
Stanford, Cal has 15 housed so
rorities and 42 fraternities. . ..
And people think the Greek sys
tem is intense at Stanford.
We picked one of Cal's most
popular sororities and ventured
in for a tour. The palace . . . uh
. . . house was immaculate,
decorated in pink and beige with
Oriental carpets covering wood
floors and huge windows over
looking San Francisco.
"Do people date at Cal?" Lori
asked.
"Of course. We go out all the
time," one skinny blonde
responded.
On the way back to the ad
missions office to pick up trans
fer applications, we decided to
eat our way out of depression
and stopped at Blondie's Pizza.
For only $1, we bought a slice
of greasy pizza three-times
larger and ... well, somewhat
better than even Co Po pizza.
A Cal landmark, Blondie's Pizza
even delivers a large, 16-inch
pizza to a dorm room for $7.
