# Russophile pursues perestroika

Having visited the Soviet Union
twice, coming out to California
for school will not be that much
of a culture shock for Vincent
Hodge of West Point, Va.
In high school Hodge took four
years of Russian language classes
at the Episcopal School in
Alexandria, Va., as well as a sum
mer class at the University of Vir
ginia. He attributes his interest
in this unusual field of study and
his desire to attend Stanford to
Dr. Mark Teeter, his Russian
teacher in high school.
Hodge's first visit to the Soviet
Union was the summer after
tenth grade. "We went on more
of a cultural, tourist trip," Hodge
said. On the second visit, however,
"I got to experience Russia as a
Soviet citizen would."
Under an agreement signed in
the fall of 1988 by then-President
Ronald Reagan and General Sec
retary Mikhail Gorbachev, stu
dent and other cultural exchanges
were promised between the Soviet
Union and the United States.
Hodge's school was chosen to
participate, and during his senior
year 10 Soviet students from a
Moscow school came to the U.S.
for a month to attend classes and
live at his all-male boarding
school. "It turned out they
brought four girls who had to be
housed with faculty and their
families. It was the first time in
150 years that we broke tradition
by allowing girls in our classes,"
he said.

In March of this year, Hodge
and nine other students spent a
month in Moscow living with
families of the Soviet students.
"It was quite historic since only
a few years ago it was illegal for
foreigners to stay in a Soviet
home," Hodge said.
The American students took
classes in Russian, had homework
they were responsible for and even
grades for their work. Hodge
hopes to continue his Russian lan
guage studies at Stanford and also
pursue an international relations
m^jor.
"With glasnost and perestroika
there is no saying how far reforms
will go," he said. He does not
believe that the Soviet Union is
about to "crumble into a civil

war," but that change and an
opening of Soviet society will con
tinue "whether Americans will ad
mit it or not."
While in the Soviet Union, he
was surprised by several aspects
of the society. "Their education
system seems to be in shambles
because the teachers don't have
the power of grades to motivate
students to work. I don't know
why it is. They just study for the
big exams to get into the univer
sity," he said.
Hodge was also quick to point
out that he did not experience any
racism during his visit. "I was
more of a novelty. I think the
average Soviet is ethnocentric, but
it's because of a lack of experience
with other cultures," he said. "I
was warmly received, and I got a
kick out of the curious younger
children."
He hopes to return to the Soviet
Union sometime during his junior
year.
Besides his studies, during his
senior year of high school Hodge
was voted chairman of the school's
honor committee. He was respon
sible for deciding honor code viola
tion cases with six other students
and four faculty members.
"It is a learning experience
when you have the power to
decide someone's fate," he said.
Hodge was also senior monitor,
a position that afforded him a lot
of contact with the faculty and
administration. "I took new stu
dents under my wing and helped
them get acquainted with their
new environment," he said.
