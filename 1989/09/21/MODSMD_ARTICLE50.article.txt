# Ghirardelli to Chinatown, San Francisco has it all
## 
### 
Between papers, midterms, projects,
problem sets and finals, Stanford stu
dents must make an occasional trip to
"the City" — but whatever you do, don't
call it "Frisco."
Listed below are some of San Fran
cisco's most famous attractions. Of
course, there are many others besides
those listed here — the rest is up to
you. Just remember, it's never really
summer in San Francisco, so dress
warmly and take a camera.
Alcatraz — Known to inmates as
"The Rock," Alcatraz claims most of its
fame from the time it was a Devil's
Isle-style federal penitentiary, housing
such notable criminals as the "Bird
Man." The island has also been used
as a fortification, a U.S. military prison,
an army disciplinary barracks and an
American Indian stronghold. The Na
tional Park Service conducts two-hour
tours from the waterfront. The tours
are traditionally very popular, so get
there early.
Cable cars — They aren't just trans
portation. To San Franciscans, they're
a way of life.
Chinatown — A Hong Kong native
once remarked that Chinatown
reminded him of home — the rush-hour
traffic jams on the main thoroughfare
rivaled any traffic tie-up a Chinese city
could muster. But Grant Avenue also
offers a kaleidoscope of Asian delights
— restaurants, dim sum bars, phar
macies displaying pickled snakes. . . .
The streets radiating out from Grant
Avenue house one of the largest Chinese
populations outside of China and plenty
of opportunities for exploration.
Civic Center — After the 1906 earth
quake and fire, the city planners wanted
to remake the town into a modern Ath
ens. The Civic Center is only a small
part of the elaborate complex originally
planned. San Franciscans boast that
City Hall, with its ornamented dome,
gargoyled finials and marble balustrade,
is the finest example of French

Romanesque architecture outside of Eu
rope. The elaborate federal and state
office buildings, Civic Auditorium,
Brooks Exhibit Hall, the public library
and the Performing Arts Center echo
this traditional theme. The glass and
concrete Louise M. Davies Symphony
Hall is a modern departure.
Coit Tower — An impressive monu
ment to the City's firefighters, Coit
looms on a hilltop and is easily acces
sible by car. The area around Coit Tower
is now an impressive patchwork of posh
apartments.
Embarcadero Freeway — Just kid
ding.
Fisherman's Wharf — Salty fisher
men, seagulls and the pungent smell of
freshly cleaned fish once dominated San
Francisco's wharf. Although the nearby
ships still berth, travelers, carnivals,
wax museums and tourist shops have
almost taken over the surrounding
wharf area. Still, the 19th-century
museum ship Balclutha hearkens back
to the old days, and some of the city's
best seafood restaurants are to be found
along the wharf.
The 49-Mile Drive — This half-day
tour is a planned drive through the
most famous landmarks of the City. The
route starts on Van Ness Avenue at the
Civic Center and is clearly marked by
blue-and-white seagull signs.
Ghirardelli Square — Here is where
19th-century laborers once made choc
olate, packaged spices and wove fine
woolens. Nowadays, visitors browse
through a shopping plaza, watch street
performers and buy chocolate and ice
cream in the original chocolate factory.
Golden Gate Bridge — Many visitors
think the Bridge basks in the warm
California sunshine overlooking the glis
tening, calm waters. Locals, however,
know the Bridge is blanketed in thick
fog and whipped by winds of the Bay.
It might be worth visiting, but don't
expect great weather.
Lombard Street — A popular

postcard advertises Lombard as "the
crookedest street in the world." There
are 19 hairpin turns in a single block
of the street that some say was designed
by a mischievous planner.
Nob Hill — Former site of Leland
Stanford Sr.'s palatial home before the
1906 earthquake, Nob Hill remains the
City's center of conspicuous consump
tion. Visit two glorious hotels, the Fair
mont and Mark Hopkins, then stroll
down the street to the ritzy shops of
Union Square. From Union Square you
can jump on the beginning of the cable
car route and take the long, exhilirating
ride to the Wharf.
Old Mint — Though it was phased
out of operation in 1937, the Old Mint
was revamped and reopened as a
museum in 1973. Its exhibits include
period rooms, a pyramid of gold bars,
Old West artifacts, the mint's Special
Coins and Metals Division and mone
tary treasures of all kinds.
Polk Street — In the pre-supermarket
era, this avenue once supported a posh
shopping district catering to the well
to-do residents of Russian Hill and Nob
Hill. Gay activists and the countercul
ture have since supplanted the fur
coated housewives and chic shops.
Shopping on Polk Street may no longer
be elite, but it's trendy and fun. Beware
of high prices.
Telegraph Hill — The Bohemian sec
tion of San Francisco. The circuitous
streets and cliff-hanging houses of
Telegraph Hill have been inhabited by
successive generations of flower
children, artists and literati.
Twin Peaks — A clich6 necking and
hangout joint for the Bay Area's teens,
the peaks offer an intoxicating
panorama from the Marin Headlands
to the Santa Clara Valley.
Union Square — This is San Fran
cisco's Fifth Avenue. Some of the City's
most swank shops and hotels — Saks
Fifth Avenue, the Hotel St. Francis,
Elizabeth Arden's — front the square.

blue-and-white seagull signs.
Ghirardelli Square — Here is where
19th-century laborers once made choc
olate, packaged spices and wove fine
woolens. Nowadays, visitors browse
through a shopping plaza, watch street
performers and buy chocolate and ice
cream in the original chocolate factory.
Golden Gate Bridge — Many visitors
think the Bridge basks in the warm
California sunshine overlooking the glis
tening, calm waters. Locals, however,
know the Bridge is blanketed in thick
fog and whipped by winds of the Bay.
It might be worth visiting, but don't
expect great weather.
Lombard Street — A popular

postcard advertises Lombard as "the
crookedest street in the world." There
are 19 hairpin turns in a single block
of the street that some say was designed
by a mischievous planner.
Nob Hill — Former site of Leland
Stanford Sr.'s palatial home before the
1906 earthquake, Nob Hill remains the
City's center of conspicuous consump
tion. Visit two glorious hotels, the Fair
mont and Mark Hopkins, then stroll
down the street to the ritzy shops of
Union Square. From Union Square you
can jump on the beginning of the cable
car route and take the long, exhilirating
ride to the Wharf.
Old Mint — Though it was phased
out of operation in 1937, the Old Mint
was revamped and reopened as a
museum in 1973. Its exhibits include
period rooms, a pyramid of gold bars,
Old West artifacts, the mint's Special
Coins and Metals Division and mone
tary treasures of all kinds.
Polk Street — In the pre-supermarket
era, this avenue once supported a posh
shopping district catering to the well
to-do residents of Russian Hill and Nob
Hill. Gay activists and the countercul
ture have since supplanted the fur
coated housewives and chic shops.
Shopping on Polk Street may no longer
be elite, but it's trendy and fun. Beware
of high prices.
Telegraph Hill — The Bohemian sec
tion of San Francisco. The circuitous
streets and cliff-hanging houses of
Telegraph Hill have been inhabited by
successive generations of flower
children, artists and literati.
Twin Peaks — A clich6 necking and
hangout joint for the Bay Area's teens,
the peaks offer an intoxicating
panorama from the Marin Headlands
to the Santa Clara Valley.
Union Square — This is San Fran
cisco's Fifth Avenue. Some of the City's
most swank shops and hotels — Saks
Fifth Avenue, the Hotel St. Francis,
Elizabeth Arden's — front the square.

Cable cars mean more than Rice-a-Roni to most native San Franciscans.
Between papers, midterms, projects,
problem sets and finals, Stanford stu
dents must make an occasional trip to
"the City" — but whatever you do, don't
call it "Frisco."
Listed below are some of San Fran
cisco's most famous attractions. Of
course, there are many others besides
those listed here — the rest is up to
you. Just remember, it's never really
summer in San Francisco, so dress
warmly and take a camera.
Alcatraz — Known to inmates as
"The Rock," Alcatraz claims most of its
fame from the time it was a Devil's
Isle-style federal penitentiary, housing
such notable criminals as the "Bird
Man." The island has also been used
as a fortification, a U.S. military prison,
an army disciplinary barracks and an
American Indian stronghold. The Na
tional Park Service conducts two-hour
tours from the waterfront. The tours
are traditionally very popular, so get
there early.
Cable cars — They aren't just trans
portation. To San Franciscans, they're
a way of life.
Chinatown — A Hong Kong native
once remarked that Chinatown
reminded him of home — the rush-hour
traffic jams on the main thoroughfare
rivaled any traffic tie-up a Chinese city
could muster. But Grant Avenue also
offers a kaleidoscope of Asian delights
— restaurants, dim sum bars, phar
macies displaying pickled snakes. . . .
The streets radiating out from Grant
Avenue house one of the largest Chinese
populations outside of China and plenty
of opportunities for exploration.
Civic Center — After the 1906 earth
quake and fire, the city planners wanted
to remake the town into a modern Ath
ens. The Civic Center is only a small
part of the elaborate complex originally
planned. San Franciscans boast that
City Hall, with its ornamented dome,
gargoyled finials and marble balustrade,
is the finest example of French

Romanesque architecture outside of Eu
rope. The elaborate federal and state
office buildings, Civic Auditorium,
Brooks Exhibit Hall, the public library
and the Performing Arts Center echo
this traditional theme. The glass and
concrete Louise M. Davies Symphony
Hall is a modern departure.
Coit Tower — An impressive monu
ment to the City's firefighters, Coit
looms on a hilltop and is easily acces
sible by car. The area around Coit Tower
is now an impressive patchwork of posh
apartments.
Embarcadero Freeway — Just kid
ding.
Fisherman's Wharf — Salty fisher
men, seagulls and the pungent smell of
freshly cleaned fish once dominated San
Francisco's wharf. Although the nearby
ships still berth, travelers, carnivals,
wax museums and tourist shops have
almost taken over the surrounding
wharf area. Still, the 19th-century
museum ship Balclutha hearkens back
to the old days, and some of the city's
best seafood restaurants are to be found
along the wharf.
The 49-Mile Drive — This half-day
tour is a planned drive through the
most famous landmarks of the City. The
route starts on Van Ness Avenue at the
Civic Center and is clearly marked by
blue-and-white seagull signs.
