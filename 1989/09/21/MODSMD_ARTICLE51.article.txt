# Eclectic entertainment off the Farm
## 
### David Chang 
Welcome to Stanford. If you're
looking for something to do with
your spare time, or looking for
something worth making spare
time for, this is the place. The
area has its share of unique places
where you can relax, grab a bite,
read a book or dance to rock 'n
roll while bowling.
Yep, you read that right. At
Stanford, within commuting dis
tance of the ever-unique metrop
olis of San Francisco, you are
surrounded by a healthy variety
of both traditional hangouts and
outright Havens for the Bizarre.
Some of these places may be
come comfortable second homes
(or second dorms) for you, like
the Stanford Pub, which has
served pizza and beer to the Car
dinal faithful for decades (455
Emerson, just off University).
On the other hand, some of
them have only the slimmest
chances of weaning you away from
your campus community.
Take for example the Barbie
Hall of Fame, which is just off
campus (325 Hamilton in Palo
Alto, 326-5840). Debatably the
campiest museum in the continen
tal United States, it's alive, it's
strange, and it's here.
The Exploratorium in San
Francisco is always fun; it's a sci
ence museum designed with
audience participation in mind
(3601 Lyon Street, 561-0360). Ac
cording to the Examiner, the surf
sculpture outside the museum is
a visual and aural treat at low
tide. And if you can, make
reservations for the Tactile Dome,
a maze you feel your way through
in the dark.
While on the subject of

museums ... the Cartoon Art
Museum at 665 Third Street in
San Francisco (546-3922) honors
an often-ncglected artist — the
cartoonist. Cartoons and comic
books have always been firmly in
the realm of popular culture, so
the museum follows suit; it's dis
playing a collection of Batman
related artwork, toys and
memorabilia until October 14.
The Santa Cruz Boardwalk is
"California's remaining seashore
playland," featuring a roller
coaster, games, rides and food.
Great place for people-watching
— from bodybuilders to
grandparents to neopunks to those
who defy categorization. Call
(408) 426-7433.
If you trust your sense of di
rection, try the two walk-through
mazes at the Wooz. They also have
games and food. Take the Monte
Vista exit of Highway 80, in
Vacaville. For the Wooz's hours,
call (707) 446-3977.
In San Francisco, there's the
aforementioned Rock 'n Bowl, a
happy marriage of bowling lanes
and a dance floor (1855 Haight,
826-2695).
And then there's the beach that
Admissions kept teasing you with.
The water's cold, but on a sunny
day, who cares? On Sand Hill
Road, drive over Highway 280.
Pass Whiskey Hill Road. Turn
right off Sand Hill onto Portola
Road. Turn left onto Old La
Honda Road. Wind through the
hills on Old La Honda past
Sky'ine Boulevard. It'll take you
down to La Honda and the San
Gregorio Beach.
This list should give you an idea
of the essentially schizophrenic
nature of the Bay Area. But don't
take it as gospel.
