# Getting from here to there and back
## 
### 
Officially it's only 35 miles
away.
But when you're earless and
there's a concert in San Fran
cisco that you just can't miss,
you feel like it might as well
be 3,500.
No need to fear, though —
the Bay Area's transit options
will make your lack of wheels
drop off the unsolvable
problem list.
The most easily accessible
transportation to the City is
the SamTrans bus, which
departs from the El Camino
Real bus stop across from the
Stanford Shopping Center. Al
though not the most scenic
route, SamTrans to the City
costs only $1.50 each way.
Buses begin the hourly trip
to San Francisco at 5:17 a.m.
on weekdays and at 6:32 a.m.
on weekends. After 7:07 a.m.
buses run approximately every
half-hour until 6:07 p.m., when
they return to hourly depar
tures. The last bus leaves Palo
Alto at 12:12 a.m.
The travel time by bus is
nearly twice that by car, and
be prepared to stand if you ride
during commuter hours.
Don't forget that the last bus
back to Palo Alto leaves from
First and Mission at 12:49 a.m.
and that the southbound buses
stop at Seventh and Mission
instead of Eighth and Mission.
On weekdays, the Palo Alto
bound 7F buses leave from
First and Mission about every
30 minutes from 6:19 a.m. un
til 6:49 p.m., when they start
leaving every hour. On
weekends, departures begin at
6:19 a.m. and run every half
hour until 5:45 p.m., when they
begin hourly departures.
If you really want to "get
into" the Bay Area commuting
scene, you may want to con
sider taking your good buddy
BART (Bay Area Rapid Tran
sit) into the City. But since the
closest BART station to Stan
ford is in Daly City, using
BART first entails finding
transportation to Daly City —
about 20 miles north of campus
on Interstate 280.
From 6 a.m. until 6:30 p.m.
weekdays, the 5L Sam Trans
bus line leaves the Stanford
Shopping Center every 20 to
30 minutes and stops at the
Daly City BART station. The

trip costs only 50 cents, but
the stop-and-go route takes
about an hour and a half.
On weekends, the route
begins at 5 a.m. and runs until
5:17 p.m., but the bus does not
stop at the Stanford Shopping
Center. Instead, it leaves from
the El Camino and Brewster
Avenue station.
The four downtown BART
stations are all underground
and centrally located along
Market Street. BART contin
ues through the City to Oak
land, making it a convenient
option for traveling to the Oak
land Coliseum and other stops
in the East Bay.
BART runs every 15 to 20
minutes from 6 a.m. until mid
night Monday through Satur
day and from 9 a.m. until mid
night on Sundays.
And there is always the train.
CalTrain leaves from the
Southern Pacific Depot off
University Avenue.
The train is more expensive
than BART or SamTrans, but
it tends to be more comfortable
and roomy. A one-way ticket
costs $3.20 and round trip fare
is $4.80.
After a smattering of dawn
departures, the CalTrain
schedule eases into what
vaguely resembles hourly
departures from 8:26 a.m. until
10:26 p.m., with a few extra
trips thrown in.
The combined network of
cable cars, the mini-metro
(street cars) and regular uses
make up the City's transporta
tion system — better known
as MUNI.
MUNI can get you from the
BART, CalTrain or SamTrans
stops to within walking dis
tance of just about anywhere
in the City. MUNI fares start
at about 85 cents, but ask for
a transfer ticket which allows
you to use the system for 90
minutes without paying again.
Take exact change.
