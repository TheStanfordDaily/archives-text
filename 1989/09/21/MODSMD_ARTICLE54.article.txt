# Cardinal gridders better than their record tells

Another quarterback controversy.
The nation's top offensive line recruit.
A new head coach straight from the
Superbowl-champion San Francisco '49ers.
Welcome to Stanford Cardinal football
'89 where high hopes in the preseason are
waning as the team heads into its first
home game with an 0-2 record.
Hold on just a sec! Two games does not
a season make and, with a trio of home
contests next up on the schedule, Stanford
is not about to roll over and play dead.
Here, in no particular order, is a look at
the various components of this year's
squad:
Quarterback: In spring practice, Steve
Smith beat out experienced veterans Brian
Johnson and Jason Palumbis and became
the Cardinal's fourth redshirt freshman to
earn the starting job in three years.
Smith is big, 6-foot-4 and 220 pounds,
and has a strong arm. But, in the early
going he was unable to move the Cardinal
and threw three interceptions.
Midway through the Oregon State game,
Coach Denny Green decided it was time to
make a change. He inserted Brian Johnson
who once held the starting job for 11
straight games. Johnson was most effective
in 1987 when he took over an 0-4 Cardinal
ballclub and rallied it to five wins in the
season's final seven games.
Johnson was benched by former Coach
Jack Elway last year after four contests.
But he's back, and according to Green, he's
currently residing atop the depth chart as
the No. 1 quarterback.
Against the Beavers Johnson was effec
tive. He rallied the Cardinal from a two
touchdown deficit and brought the team
to the brink of tying the game.
Topping the list of Johnson's strengths
is his mobility. A superb athlete, Johnson
can avoid the rush and throw on the move.
He also has that most ethereal quality —
leadership. The team seems to rally around
Johnson.
His biggest shortcoming is his failure to
spot open receivers on occasion — especially

on the left sideline.
Running backs: Heading the cast of
Stanford ball carriers is Jon Volpe. Though
Volpe is small in stature at 5-7, he's big
on production.
Last year, Volpe became Stanford's third
ever 1,000-yard rusher. In the Oregon State
game he picked up solid yardage and seems
healthy. Volpe was banged up a lot last
season and it was hoped that the switch
from a one-back set to a standard pro-set
formation would reduce the wear and tear
on the Cardinal *8 top back.
Unfortunately, Charlie Young, who was
slated to join Volpe in the backfield, un
derwent preseason knee surgery and has
yet to play a down.
None of Stanford's other running backs
— including Jay Jay Lasley, Tommy Vardell
and Scott Eschelman — has done anything
to distinguish themselves thus far.
Still, with Volpe leading the way, the
running game should be solid. And could
be better if . . .
Offensive line: Returning only two
starters from last year's unit, the line was
obviously an area of concern before the
season even began.
Now, with two games gone by, those
fears have shown themselves to be war
ranted. The run blocking has been nothing
special and the pass protection insufficient.
The sputtering of the Stanford offense is
due, at least in part, to the play of the line.
Individual talent is not the issue. Re
turning starters Chuck Gillingham and
Andy Papathanassiou have proven they can
do the job. Sophomore John Carpenter also
has experience and ability.
Highly-touted freshman Bob "The Anvil"
Whitfield has worlds of talent and only
lacks experience. Chris Dalman rounds out
the line.
These guys can play individually. What
they must show is that they can play to
gether.
Receivers: A talented, deep corps. If
Johns6n settles in, he'll have a load of
targets to choose from. These guys get

open, go deep, run fast and jump
high.
The names to know include: Ed
McCaffrey, a 6-6 leaper who
missed last season with an injury;
Walter Batson, a burner who can
rarely be covered one-on-one;
Chris Walsh, the kind of player
who seems to come up with big
catches; and Jim Price, a
phenomenally athletic tight end.
Defensive line: Home to one of
Stanford's two best players —
Lester Archambeau — the line is
potentially a source of strength
for the Stanford defense.
Archambeau plays one of the
end position and Scott Pclmbush
the other. Palmbush is the kind
of player who no one talks about
— except the opposition's offen
sive coordinator. Archambeau is
the kind of player who's headed
for the NFL.
Linebackers: The other mem
ber of the Cardinal top two resides
here in the person of Rob
Hinckley. An outside linebacker
who finds a way to get across the
line of scrimmage in a hurry,
Hinckley is a quarterback's worst
nightmare come true.
Jono Tunney, Stanford's
leading tackier last season,
anchors the inside and is a pre
mier run stuffer.
Bruce Lang, a steady starter
the past two years, has become a
big-play linebacker for the Cardi
nal this year.
Secondary: At the beginning of
the 1988 season, the Stanford sec
ondary was much maligned. At
the beginning of the 1989 season,
the Stanford secondary is viewed
with much respect. A classic ex
ample of "what a difference a year
makes."
Corners Kevin Scott and Alan
Grant are close buddies with each
other and with the receivers they
cover like a blanket. Scott and
Grant are confident and don't give
up the long bomb.
The third corner is Tuan Van
Le. His nickname would be
"Prime Time" if that Sanders guy
didn't already have it. Le already
has a blocked punt and an inter
ception. He makes things happens
and has the kihd of on-field spirit
that fires up the team.

Smith is big, 6-foot-4 and 220 pounds,
and has a strong arm. But, in the early
going he was unable to move the Cardinal
and threw three interceptions.
Midway through the Oregon State game,
Coach Denny Green decided it was time to
make a change. He inserted Brian Johnson
who once held the starting job for 11
straight games. Johnson was most effective
in 1987 when he took over an 0-4 Cardinal
ballclub and rallied it to five wins in the
season's final seven games.
Johnson was benched by former Coach
Jack Elway last year after four contests.
But he's back, and according to Green, he's
currently residing atop the depth chart as
the No. 1 quarterback.
Against the Beavers Johnson was effec
tive. He rallied the Cardinal from a two
touchdown deficit and brought the team
to the brink of tying the game.
Topping the list of Johnson's strengths
is his mobility. A superb athlete, Johnson
can avoid the rush and throw on the move.
He also has that most ethereal quality —
leadership. The team seems to rally around
Johnson.
His biggest shortcoming is his failure to
spot open receivers on occasion — especially

on the left sideline.
Running backs: Heading the cast of
Stanford ball carriers is Jon Volpe. Though
Volpe is small in stature at 5-7, he's big
on production.
Last year, Volpe became Stanford's third
ever 1,000-yard rusher. In the Oregon State
game he picked up solid yardage and seems
healthy. Volpe was banged up a lot last
season and it was hoped that the switch
from a one-back set to a standard pro-set
formation would reduce the wear and tear
on the Cardinal *8 top back.
Unfortunately, Charlie Young, who was
slated to join Volpe in the backfield, un
derwent preseason knee surgery and has
yet to play a down.
None of Stanford's other running backs
— including Jay Jay Lasley, Tommy Vardell
and Scott Eschelman — has done anything
to distinguish themselves thus far.
Still, with Volpe leading the way, the
running game should be solid. And could
be better if . . .
Offensive line: Returning only two
starters from last year's unit, the line was
obviously an area of concern before the
season even began.
Now, with two games gone by, those
fears have shown themselves to be war
ranted. The run blocking has been nothing
special and the pass protection insufficient.
The sputtering of the Stanford offense is
due, at least in part, to the play of the line.
Individual talent is not the issue. Re
turning starters Chuck Gillingham and
Andy Papathanassiou have proven they can
do the job. Sophomore John Carpenter also
has experience and ability.
Highly-touted freshman Bob "The Anvil"
Whitfield has worlds of talent and only
lacks experience. Chris Dalman rounds out
the line.
These guys can play individually. What
they must show is that they can play to
gether.
Receivers: A talented, deep corps. If
Johns6n settles in, he'll have a load of
targets to choose from. These guys get

open, go deep, run fast and jump
high.
The names to know include: Ed
McCaffrey, a 6-6 leaper who
missed last season with an injury;
Walter Batson, a burner who can
rarely be covered one-on-one;
Chris Walsh, the kind of player
who seems to come up with big
catches; and Jim Price, a
phenomenally athletic tight end.
Defensive line: Home to one of
Stanford's two best players —
Lester Archambeau — the line is
potentially a source of strength
for the Stanford defense.
Archambeau plays one of the
end position and Scott Pclmbush
the other. Palmbush is the kind
of player who no one talks about
— except the opposition's offen
sive coordinator. Archambeau is
the kind of player who's headed
for the NFL.
Linebackers: The other mem
ber of the Cardinal top two resides
here in the person of Rob
Hinckley. An outside linebacker
who finds a way to get across the
line of scrimmage in a hurry,
Hinckley is a quarterback's worst
nightmare come true.
Jono Tunney, Stanford's
leading tackier last season,
anchors the inside and is a pre
mier run stuffer.
Bruce Lang, a steady starter
the past two years, has become a
big-play linebacker for the Cardi
nal this year.
Secondary: At the beginning of
the 1988 season, the Stanford sec
ondary was much maligned. At
the beginning of the 1989 season,
the Stanford secondary is viewed
with much respect. A classic ex
ample of "what a difference a year
makes."
Corners Kevin Scott and Alan
Grant are close buddies with each
other and with the receivers they
cover like a blanket. Scott and
Grant are confident and don't give
up the long bomb.
The third corner is Tuan Van
Le. His nickname would be
"Prime Time" if that Sanders guy
didn't already have it. Le already
has a blocked punt and an inter
ception. He makes things happens
and has the kihd of on-field spirit
that fires up the team.
Another quarterback controversy.

Welcome to Stanford Cardinal football
'89 where high hopes in the preseason are
waning as the team heads into its first
home game with an 0-2 record.
Hold on just a sec! Two games does not
a season make and, with a trio of home
contests next up on the schedule, Stanford
is not about to roll over and play dead.
Here, in no particular order, is a look at
the various components of this year's
squad:
Quarterback: In spring practice, Steve
Smith beat out experienced veterans Brian
Johnson and Jason Palumbis and became
the Cardinal's fourth redshirt freshman to
earn the starting job in three years.

and has a strong arm. But, in the early
