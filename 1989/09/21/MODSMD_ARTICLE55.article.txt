Nineteen eighty-nine just may be the year
for Cardinal women's volleyball.
Of course some people thought 1988 would
be the year they brought home the national
title. Or 1987. Or 1985. Or 1984. Each time
the team has finished the season ranked
among the top three or four teams in the
country.
In 1984 a bad call from the referee was the
genesis of a UCLA comeback in the fifth game
of the NCAA final. Pacific played a great
match to upend the Cardinal in the final the
following year. In 1987 NCAA Player of the
Year Teee Williams and Hawaii had Stanford's
number, again in the championship match.
And last year Laurie Wetzel and Melinda Be
ckenhauer led Washington to a stunning upset
of Stanford in the West Regional.
The important thing, however, is that Stan
ford has been perhaps the top collegiate vol
leyball program over the past six or seven
years. No other team has reached the NCAA
final three times in the last five years.
This year, with five starters and seven
others back from last year's 28-3 squad, and
four top freshmen coming in, Stanford is
ranked No. 2 in the nation. Despite a starting
lineup that features a freshman and two soph
omores, Stanford has the firepower, experi
ence and depth to win the whole enchilada.
"I think we're improved from last year,"
Shaw said. "Everyone from last year improved
over the off season. We've added a solid fresh
man class. The combination makes us better."
Perhaps the player best exemplifying the
combination of youth and experience is soph
omore Kristin Klein, a first-team Ail-
American and the Pacific 10 Conference's
Freshman of the Year last year. Klein led
Stanford in both kills and digs last year and
was second on the team in hitting percentage.
"We have a lot of matches left and we have
a lot of improving to do," Klein said, "but I
think we can be a pretty good team. Everyone
has the skills."
The hitting percentage leader for Stanford
is Amy Cooper, another young veteran. Cooper
hit .334 to earn AIl-Pac-10 honors as a fresh
man last year and led the Cardinal in blocking
in 1988.
Three seniors also return to the starting
lineup. Setter Lara Asper quietly led the Car
dinal to a No. 2 national ranking last year
and will be back to try and take the Cardinal
all the way this season.
Jennifer Chaffee and Laura Olesen are also
returning starters. Chaffee was a big surprise
for the Cardinal last year with her improved
hitting and defense. She appears to be even
better this season and will be one of
big guns in the clutch.
Olesen is a starter for the fourth straight
year and is once again the team captain. She
will likely become the career leader at Stanford
in block assists before her days are done and
is in the NCAA record books for hitting 1.000
in a match against Oregon State her freshman
year.
"I think this team could be the best we've
had here at Stanford," Shaw said. "The course
of the season will tell the tale. We have to
go out and do it on the court. I think the
ingredients are there."
One of the reasons this year's edition of
the Cardinal may he better than all the others
is the freshman class. by high school
Player of the Year Bev Oden, Stanford has
arguably the best freshman class in the coun
try. Oden has already earned a spot in the
starting lineup and Kristi Paaso has seen a
lot of playing time.

Freshman setter Carrie Feldman has also
seen some action this year and appears to be
the setter of the future. The fourth frosh,
Laurie Sawin, has established herself as one
of the best defensive players on the team and
is the owner of a tough jump serve.
Oden is biggest prize, however. She led
Stanford in kills, blocks and hitting percentage
in the season opener against USF and recorded
a rare triple-double (15 kills, 13 blocks and
12 digs) in an exhibition match against the
Soviet Union's Junior National Team.
"She's been great," Shaw said. "She learns
things fast. She has a great attitude."
Stanford's primary competition in the
Pacific 10 Conference this year will come from
UCLA. The Bruins were ranked No. 1 in the
preseason poll before being upset by Hawaii
in the islands. Nationally, Hawaii also provides
a threat, as do Long Beach State, Nebraska
and Pacific.

"Everybody's going to be pretty good," Shaw
said. "Everyone (in the Pac-10) has improved
over last year. Nationally I think last year
was a little of a down year. Most teams had
lost some players from the year before. Almost
everyone's better than last year."
Card notes
Stanford opened Pac-10 play last weekend (after
our press deadline) with matches at Washington
State and Washington. The Cougars, Friday's op
ponent, were 5-6, and are led by outside hitter
Carla Reyes and middle blocker Carrie Couturier.
Saturday's match was a chance for the Cardinal
to extract some revenge. Stanford handled Wash
ington, currently ranked 15th, easily in both
regular-season matches last year but the Huskies
knocked Stanford out of the NCAA tournament in
a big upset. This year the top Dawgs are setter
Melinda Beckenhauer and outside hitters Lisa
McCammond and Kayley Grim.

the setter of the future. The fourth frosh,
Laurie Sawin, has established herself as one
of the best defensive players on the team and
is the owner of a tough jump serve.
Oden is biggest prize, however. She led
Stanford in kills, blocks and hitting percentage
in the season opener against USF and recorded
a rare triple-double (15 kills, 13 blocks and
12 digs) in an exhibition match against the
Soviet Union's Junior National Team.
"She's been great," Shaw said. "She learns
things fast. She has a great attitude."
Stanford's primary competition in the
Pacific 10 Conference this year will come from
UCLA. The Bruins were ranked No. 1 in the
preseason poll before being upset by Hawaii
in the islands. Nationally, Hawaii also provides
a threat, as do Long Beach State, Nebraska
and Pacific.

"Everybody's going to be pretty good," Shaw
said. "Everyone (in the Pac-10) has improved
over last year. Nationally I think last year
was a little of a down year. Most teams had
lost some players from the year before. Almost
everyone's better than last year."
Card notes
Stanford opened Pac-10 play last weekend (after
our press deadline) with matches at Washington
State and Washington. The Cougars, Friday's op
ponent, were 5-6, and are led by outside hitter
Carla Reyes and middle blocker Carrie Couturier.
Saturday's match was a chance for the Cardinal
to extract some revenge. Stanford handled Wash
ington, currently ranked 15th, easily in both
regular-season matches last year but the Huskies
knocked Stanford out of the NCAA tournament in
a big upset. This year the top Dawgs are setter
Melinda Beckenhauer and outside hitters Lisa
McCammond and Kayley Grim.

Freshman Krlstl Paaso didn t play like a freshman agaimrt UOP last week as she hammered
out seven kills.
Nineteen eighty-nine just may be the year
for Cardinal women's volleyball.
Of course some people thought 1988 would
be the year they brought home the national
title. Or 1987. Or 1985. Or 1984. Each time
the team has finished the season ranked
among the top three or four teams in the
country.
In 1984 a bad call from the referee was the
genesis of a UCLA comeback in the fifth game
of the NCAA final. Pacific played a great
match to upend the Cardinal in the final the
following year. In 1987 NCAA Player of the
Year Teee Williams and Hawaii had Stanford's
number, again in the championship match.
And last year Laurie Wetzel and Melinda Be
ckenhauer led Washington to a stunning upset
of Stanford in the West Regional.
The important thing, however, is that Stan
ford has been perhaps the top collegiate vol
leyball program over the past six or seven
years. No other team has reached the NCAA
final three times in the last five years.
This year, with five starters and seven
others back from last year's 28-3 squad, and
four top freshmen coming in, Stanford is
ranked No. 2 in the nation. Despite a starting
lineup that features a freshman and two soph
omores, Stanford has the firepower, experi
ence and depth to win the whole enchilada.
"I think we're improved from last year,"
Shaw said. "Everyone from last year improved
over the off season. We've added a solid fresh
man class. The combination makes us better."
Perhaps the player best exemplifying the
combination of youth and experience is soph
omore Kristin Klein, a first-team Ail-
American and the Pacific 10 Conference's
Freshman of the Year last year. Klein led
Stanford in both kills and digs last year and
was second on the team in hitting percentage.
"We have a lot of matches left and we have
a lot of improving to do," Klein said, "but I
think we can be a pretty good team. Everyone
has the skills."
The hitting percentage leader for Stanford
is Amy Cooper, another young veteran. Cooper
hit .334 to earn AIl-Pac-10 honors as a fresh
man last year and led the Cardinal in blocking
in 1988.
Three seniors also return to the starting
lineup. Setter Lara Asper quietly led the Car
dinal to a No. 2 national ranking last year
and will be back to try and take the Cardinal
all the way this season.
Jennifer Chaffee and Laura Olesen are also
returning starters. Chaffee was a big surprise
for the Cardinal last year with her improved
hitting and defense. She appears to be even
better this season and will be one of
big guns in the clutch.
Olesen is a starter for the fourth straight
year and is once again the team captain. She
will likely become the career leader at Stanford
in block assists before her days are done and
is in the NCAA record books for hitting 1.000
in a match against Oregon State her freshman
year.
"I think this team could be the best we've
had here at Stanford," Shaw said. "The course
of the season will tell the tale. We have to
go out and do it on the court. I think the
ingredients are there."
One of the reasons this year's edition of
the Cardinal may he better than all the others
is the freshman class. by high school
Player of the Year Bev Oden, Stanford has
arguably the best freshman class in the coun
try. Oden has already earned a spot in the
starting lineup and Kristi Paaso has seen a
lot of playing time.
