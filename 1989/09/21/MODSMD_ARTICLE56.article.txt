# USC early favorite in race for the Roses
## 
### Chris Crader Editorial staff 
There are many advantages
in going to a school on the quar
ter system. One is that you are
able to take half again as many
different classes as you could
take on the semester system.
A second is that summer va
cation just keeps on going, even
when all your friends have to
go back to school.
Perhaps my favorite, how
ever, is that the football season
is two weeks old before school
starts, providing sports writers
with two weeks of information
to help make predictions.
With no further ado, here is
a summary of how the football
race in the Pacific 10 Confer
ence is shaping up, including
predicted order of finish and
enough obscure names and
facts to bore even the most ar
dent football fan.
• 1 USC (0-1 overall entering
last weekend, 0-0 in the Pac-10,
ranked #13 by the AP): USC
went to the 1988 Rose Bowl.
USC went to the 1989 Rose
Bowl. USC will go to the 1990
Rose Bowl. And they might
even win it this time.
After beating favored UCLA
in the final Pac-10 game each
of the past two years to earn
the league title, the Trojans
lost the Big One both times,
falling to Lorenzo White's
Michigan State team in 1988
and the Michigan Wolverines
last year. This year, however,
USC is a top .contender for the
national title.
How strong are the Trojans?
They ranked second in the na
tion in rushing defense last
year while giving up fewer than
15 points per game, and the
team returns 10 of 11 starters
from that unit, including three
Ail-Americans: defensive tackle
Tim Ryan and safeties Mark
Carrier and Cleveland Colter.
The Trojans did lose quar
terback Rodney Peete to the
National Football League, but
eight offensive starters are
back to join new signal-caller
Todd Marinovich, who was
highly recruited by almost
every top college.
There is no such thing as a
given in the Pac-10, but the
smart money is on USC, as
much as it pains me to say it.
•2 UCLA (0-1, 0-0, #20):
Like USC, UCLA's most press
ing need is to find a new quar
terback to replace top NFL
draftee Troy Aikman. Like
their crosstown rivals, the
Bruins will do so with Bret
Johnson, a redshirt frosh like
Marinovich.
The difference between thf;

squads is that all UCLA's toip
defensive players from last yeB.r
are gone. Defensive tackle Mike
Lodish is one of the best in the
West, and he nearly *single
handedly defeated Stanford
with the fluke play of the y(;ar
last season.
The losses of Darryl Henley,
Chance Johnson and Carnell
Lake are big blows to the Bruin
defense, but the Bruins will
still give up fewer than they
score most Saturdays this year.
The reason begins with an
offensive line that returns four
starters, including first-team
All-Pac-10 center Frank Cor
nish. Add three great tight ends
— led by Charles Arbuckle —
three of their top four rushers
and both starting wideouts re
turning from last year's team.

USC should make
its third consecutive
Rose Bowl appear
ance after winning
the Conference of
Replacement Quar
terbacks.

UCLA also has the advantage
of starting with three straight
non-conference games to tune
them up for the race for thf •
Roses. If the Trojans stumblfj,
UClj\ may be looking for its
eighth straight bowl victory on
its home field Jan. 1.
• 3 Arizona (1-1, 1-0): Ac
cording to Stanford qunrter
back Steve Smith, the Wildcats
outplayed Stanford i n the
teams' season opener. And if
the team's performance in that
game was any indication, Ari
zona is going to out play a lot
of other teams this season.
The Wildcats start with per
haps the best ground game in
the conference. Despite the fact
that fullback Art Greathouse is
still considerably hampered by
a foot injury, halfbacks Reggie
McGill (sever, carries for 58
yards against Stanford), David
Fldridge (15 for 75), and Great
house's replacement — Mario
Hampton (10 for 30) — are
capable of moving the ball well.
The Quarterback is Ronald
Veal, v/ho is not a good passer
at all. But Tony Rice of Notre
Dair.e wasn't a good passer at
the start of last year; this year
he/s a Heisman Trophy candi
date. Veal knows how to run,
and he knows how to throw
