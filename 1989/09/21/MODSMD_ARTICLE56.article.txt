# USC early favorite in race for the Roses
## 
### Chris Crader Editorial staff 
There are many advantages
in going to a school on the quar
ter system. One is that you are
able to take half again as many
different classes as you could
take on the semester system.
A second is that summer va
cation just keeps on going, even
when all your friends have to
go back to school.
Perhaps my favorite, how
ever, is that the football season
is two weeks old before school
starts, providing sports writers
with two weeks of information
to help make predictions.
With no further ado, here is
a summary of how the football
race in the Pacific 10 Confer
ence is shaping up, including
predicted order of finish and
enough obscure names and
facts to bore even the most ar
dent football fan.
• 1 USC (0-1 overall entering
last weekend, 0-0 in the Pac-10,
ranked #13 by the AP): USC
went to the 1988 Rose Bowl.
USC went to the 1989 Rose
Bowl. USC will go to the 1990
Rose Bowl. And they might
even win it this time.
After beating favored UCLA
in the final Pac-10 game each
of the past two years to earn
the league title, the Trojans
lost the Big One both times,
falling to Lorenzo White's
Michigan State team in 1988
and the Michigan Wolverines
last year. This year, however,
USC is a top .contender for the
national title.
How strong are the Trojans?
They ranked second in the na
tion in rushing defense last
year while giving up fewer than
15 points per game, and the
team returns 10 of 11 starters
from that unit, including three
Ail-Americans: defensive tackle
Tim Ryan and safeties Mark
Carrier and Cleveland Colter.
The Trojans did lose quar
terback Rodney Peete to the
National Football League, but
eight offensive starters are
back to join new signal-caller
Todd Marinovich, who was
highly recruited by almost
every top college.
There is no such thing as a
given in the Pac-10, but the
smart money is on USC, as
much as it pains me to say it.
•2 UCLA (0-1, 0-0, #20):
Like USC, UCLA's most press
ing need is to find a new quar
terback to replace top NFL
draftee Troy Aikman. Like
their crosstown rivals, the
Bruins will do so with Bret
Johnson, a redshirt frosh like
Marinovich.
The difference between thf;

squads is that all UCLA's toip
defensive players from last yeB.r
are gone. Defensive tackle Mike
Lodish is one of the best in the
West, and he nearly *single
handedly defeated Stanford
with the fluke play of the y(;ar
last season.
The losses of Darryl Henley,
Chance Johnson and Carnell
Lake are big blows to the Bruin
defense, but the Bruins will
still give up fewer than they
score most Saturdays this year.
The reason begins with an
offensive line that returns four
starters, including first-team
All-Pac-10 center Frank Cor
nish. Add three great tight ends
— led by Charles Arbuckle —
three of their top four rushers
and both starting wideouts re
turning from last year's team.

USC should make
its third consecutive
Rose Bowl appear
ance after winning
the Conference of
Replacement Quar
terbacks.

UCLA also has the advantage
of starting with three straight
non-conference games to tune
them up for the race for thf •
Roses. If the Trojans stumblfj,
UClj\ may be looking for its
eighth straight bowl victory on
its home field Jan. 1.
• 3 Arizona (1-1, 1-0): Ac
cording to Stanford qunrter
back Steve Smith, the Wildcats
outplayed Stanford i n the
teams' season opener. And if
the team's performance in that
game was any indication, Ari
zona is going to out play a lot
of other teams this season.
The Wildcats start with per
haps the best ground game in
the conference. Despite the fact
that fullback Art Greathouse is
still considerably hampered by
a foot injury, halfbacks Reggie
McGill (sever, carries for 58
yards against Stanford), David
Fldridge (15 for 75), and Great
house's replacement — Mario
Hampton (10 for 30) — are
capable of moving the ball well.
The Quarterback is Ronald
Veal, v/ho is not a good passer
at all. But Tony Rice of Notre
Dair.e wasn't a good passer at
the start of last year; this year
he/s a Heisman Trophy candi
date. Veal knows how to run,
and he knows how to throw
the five-yard pass to his buddies
and watch them run.
On defense, the Wildcats are
led by linebacker Chris Singleton.
The defensive line is strong
despite the graduation of
noseguard Dana Wells, the Pac-10
Defensive Player of the Year last
season.
The Wildcats don't have that
great a chance of breaking up the
top two, but they should be the
class of the middle six.
• 4 Oregon (1-0, 1-0): The
Ducks? Fourth in the conference?
In football? Is it April Ist or some
thing?
No fooling, Oregon has a good
football team. Last year they got
off to a 6-1 start (the only loss
was to USC), then quarterback
Bill Musgrave broke his collarbone
against Arizona State. Five losses
later, the Ducks had put off for
at least one more year their first
bowl game since the early '60s.
Musgrave threw only four inter
ceptions to go with his eight TDs
last year while his replacements
completed less than 42 percent of
their passes for five TDs and 21
interceptions.
Musgrave is healthy again, how
ever, and he is leading nine ad
ditional 1988 starters on offense.
Flanker Terry Obee averaged
more than 18 yards per grab last
year, and Derek Loville and Latin
Berry combined to outrush Stan
ford, Cal, ASU and OSU last year.
Defensively the Ducks gradu
ated their three top players —
Matt Brock, Scott Kozak and
Thom Kaumeyer.
Perhaps the best thing Oregon
has going, aside from Musgrave,
is the fact that they don't meet
USC this year. They won't be
spending January in Pasadena,
but if they find the consistency
they lacked last year, bowling
could well be on the agenda.
• 5 Arizona State (1-0, 0-0): If
scheduling were what determined
the conference champion, ASU
would be the winner hands down.
The Sun Devils don't have to play
USC. Their first four games are
at home. All are against non
league foes. Most importantly,
however, ASU leaves Tempe only
three times this year.
That's right — they have eight

home games. They also have all
their starters at the skill positions
returning, along with the Pac-10's
leading tackier last year — line
backer Mark Tingstad.
On the flip side, they only
return one starting offensive
lineman, but he is 307-pound
Fedel Underwood, who is quick
enough that he'll be playing guard
this year. Quarterback Paul Jus
tin split time last year but is the
starter after completing 56 per
cent of his passes.
• 6 Washington (1-0, 0-0, #15):
Don James enters 1989 with more
Pac-10 victories than any other
coach in the league's history. Un
less something unexpected hap
pens, however, UCLA's Terry
Donahue will pass him and
James' grip on his job will become
much more tenuous.
The Huskies do have one of the
top defensive linemen around in
300-pounder Dennis Brown. And
they have ... Um, who else do
they have? Well, that's an exag
geration; Washington has 14 re
turning starters including quar
terback Cary Conklin.
The defense, last in the league
against the run last year, does
return eight starters, for better
or worse. In addition to Brown,
cornerback Le-Lo Lang, safety
Eugene Burkhalter and line
backer Chico Fraley will lead the
Dog defense.
Washington will definitely have
a chance to win some ball games
this year, but opening the confer
ence schedule against Arizona,
USC and Oregon will give them
a stern test of the team's charac
ter.
• 7 Washington State (2-0, 0-0,
#23): The Pac-10's biggest
surprise of last year appears to
be the biggest surprise of this
year. Led by quarterback Timm
Rosenbach last year the Cougars
went 9-3, upset UCLA to hand
the Bruins their first loss and
beat Houston in the Aloha Bowl.
Rosebach's decision to go pro
following his junior season and
Coach Dennis Erickson's trip to
Miami to rcplace Jimmy (plastic
hair) Johnson appeared to move
the Cougs nearer the Pac-10 cellar.
The Cougars have continued to
smoke this year, however, trounc
ing Idaho 41-7 and upsetting then-
No. 24 Brigham Young. The key
has been the play of quarterback
Brad Gossen, who has had two
Rosenbach-like games so far this

year. He has the advantage of
being able to throw to Tim Stal
lworth, a 1000-yard receiver last
year, as well as returning starter
Doug Wellsandt at tight end.
In the backfield are Steve
Broussard, the Pac-10's leader in
all-purpose running last year, and
Rich Swinton, who rushed for 980
yards last season.
The defense of the Cougars has
always been a problem, and with
only four returning starters, it
will be again this year. But, hey
— giving up 45 points a game
isn't so bad if you're scoring 50.
• 8 Stanford (0-2, 0-2): see page
D-3 for Stanford preview
• 9 Oregon State (1-0, 1-0): The
problem with playing in the Pac
-10 these days is the bad teams
just keep getting better and bet
ter. Oregon State and Washington
State had spent so many years in
the cellar that they were on a
first-name basis with the rats
there, but no more. Washington
State has been a have instead of

a have-not the past year and a
half, and the Beavers appear
ready to join them.
Unfortunately, starting QB
Erik Wilhelm is gone. The main
man in the Air Express is now in
the NFL, but replacement Nick
Schichtle gave a fine account of
himself against Stanford a week
ago. He has top tight end Phil
Ross and running back Pat Chaf
fee to receive his air mail, and he
can hand to Chaffee for variety.
Either way, forward progress in
large chunks will be the norm.
The Beavers are even starting
to play defense this year. After
holding only three teams to fewer
than 20 points all last year, the
Beavers look ready to improve
their defense's image.
• 10 California (0-1, 0-1): Oh
those hurtin' Golden Bears. Last
last year and, most likely, last this
year. They have the best quarter
back in the league in Troy Taylor
but unless he can throw from his
back and on the run, college foot

ball fans will have no idea how
good he is.
Cal's offensive line is clearly
their biggest concern. And if the
Bears want to take the pressure
off Taylor with the ground game,
top recruit Russel WJiite will be
in the library, not cm the field.
After four tries White could not
attain the NCAA's minimun SAT
standard (a combined 700 points)
and he must sit out this year.
Defensively, Joel Dickson is
back. This guy Cardinal fans can
even like. After being switched
from linebacker to defensive line
two years ago, he had four sacks
in his first game. He was tearing
up Pac-10 offensive linemen last
year until he was shot in the
stomach while minding his own
business outside a Berkeley club
before their fifth game. He missed
the rest of the year but will team
with linebacker David Ortega and
a pair of good corners to wreak
havoc throughout the Pac-10.
The downside: Cal plays Miami
this year. . . .

their passes for five TDs and 21
interceptions.
Musgrave is healthy again, how
ever, and he is leading nine ad
ditional 1988 starters on offense.
Flanker Terry Obee averaged
more than 18 yards per grab last
year, and Derek Loville and Latin
Berry combined to outrush Stan
ford, Cal, ASU and OSU last year.
Defensively the Ducks gradu
ated their three top players —
Matt Brock, Scott Kozak and
Thom Kaumeyer.
Perhaps the best thing Oregon
has going, aside from Musgrave,
is the fact that they don't meet
USC this year. They won't be
spending January in Pasadena,
but if they find the consistency
they lacked last year, bowling
could well be on the agenda.
• 5 Arizona State (1-0, 0-0): If
scheduling were what determined
the conference champion, ASU
would be the winner hands down.
The Sun Devils don't have to play
USC. Their first four games are
at home. All are against non
league foes. Most importantly,
however, ASU leaves Tempe only
three times this year.
That's right — they have eight

home games. They also have all
their starters at the skill positions
returning, along with the Pac-10's
leading tackier last year — line
backer Mark Tingstad.
On the flip side, they only
return one starting offensive
lineman, but he is 307-pound
Fedel Underwood, who is quick
enough that he'll be playing guard
this year. Quarterback Paul Jus
tin split time last year but is the
starter after completing 56 per
cent of his passes.
• 6 Washington (1-0, 0-0, #15):
Don James enters 1989 with more
Pac-10 victories than any other
coach in the league's history. Un
less something unexpected hap
pens, however, UCLA's Terry
Donahue will pass him and
James' grip on his job will become
much more tenuous.
The Huskies do have one of the
top defensive linemen around in
300-pounder Dennis Brown. And
they have ... Um, who else do
they have? Well, that's an exag
geration; Washington has 14 re
turning starters including quar
terback Cary Conklin.
The defense, last in the league
against the run last year, does
return eight starters, for better
or worse. In addition to Brown,
cornerback Le-Lo Lang, safety
Eugene Burkhalter and line
backer Chico Fraley will lead the
Dog defense.
Washington will definitely have
a chance to win some ball games
this year, but opening the confer
ence schedule against Arizona,
USC and Oregon will give them
a stern test of the team's charac
ter.
• 7 Washington State (2-0, 0-0,
#23): The Pac-10's biggest
surprise of last year appears to
be the biggest surprise of this
year. Led by quarterback Timm
Rosenbach last year the Cougars
went 9-3, upset UCLA to hand
the Bruins their first loss and
beat Houston in the Aloha Bowl.
Rosebach's decision to go pro
following his junior season and
Coach Dennis Erickson's trip to
Miami to rcplace Jimmy (plastic
hair) Johnson appeared to move
the Cougs nearer the Pac-10 cellar.
The Cougars have continued to
smoke this year, however, trounc
ing Idaho 41-7 and upsetting then-
No. 24 Brigham Young. The key
has been the play of quarterback
Brad Gossen, who has had two
Rosenbach-like games so far this

year. He has the advantage of
being able to throw to Tim Stal
lworth, a 1000-yard receiver last
year, as well as returning starter
Doug Wellsandt at tight end.
In the backfield are Steve
Broussard, the Pac-10's leader in
all-purpose running last year, and
Rich Swinton, who rushed for 980
yards last season.
The defense of the Cougars has
always been a problem, and with
only four returning starters, it
will be again this year. But, hey
— giving up 45 points a game
isn't so bad if you're scoring 50.
• 8 Stanford (0-2, 0-2): see page
D-3 for Stanford preview
• 9 Oregon State (1-0, 1-0): The
problem with playing in the Pac
-10 these days is the bad teams
just keep getting better and bet
ter. Oregon State and Washington
State had spent so many years in
the cellar that they were on a
first-name basis with the rats
there, but no more. Washington
State has been a have instead of

a have-not the past year and a
half, and the Beavers appear
ready to join them.
Unfortunately, starting QB
Erik Wilhelm is gone. The main
man in the Air Express is now in
the NFL, but replacement Nick
Schichtle gave a fine account of
himself against Stanford a week
ago. He has top tight end Phil
Ross and running back Pat Chaf
fee to receive his air mail, and he
can hand to Chaffee for variety.
Either way, forward progress in
large chunks will be the norm.
The Beavers are even starting
to play defense this year. After
holding only three teams to fewer
than 20 points all last year, the
Beavers look ready to improve
their defense's image.
• 10 California (0-1, 0-1): Oh
those hurtin' Golden Bears. Last
last year and, most likely, last this
year. They have the best quarter
back in the league in Troy Taylor
but unless he can throw from his
back and on the run, college foot

ball fans will have no idea how
good he is.
Cal's offensive line is clearly
their biggest concern. And if the
Bears want to take the pressure
off Taylor with the ground game,
top recruit Russel WJiite will be
in the library, not cm the field.
After four tries White could not
attain the NCAA's minimun SAT
standard (a combined 700 points)
and he must sit out this year.
Defensively, Joel Dickson is
back. This guy Cardinal fans can
even like. After being switched
from linebacker to defensive line
two years ago, he had four sacks
in his first game. He was tearing
up Pac-10 offensive linemen last
year until he was shot in the
stomach while minding his own
business outside a Berkeley club
before their fifth game. He missed
the rest of the year but will team
with linebacker David Ortega and
a pair of good corners to wreak
havoc throughout the Pac-10.
The downside: Cal plays Miami
this year. . . .


t Ken Beer — Daily file
Its time again for the best and the worst of the Pac-10 to go head to head. Our sources say USC
and UCLA will fight for the league crown.
There are many advantages
in going to a school on the quar
ter system. One is that you are
able to take half again as many
different classes as you could
take on the semester system.
A second is that summer va
cation just keeps on going, even
when all your friends have to
go back to school.
Perhaps my favorite, how
ever, is that the football season
is two weeks old before school
starts, providing sports writers
with two weeks of information
to help make predictions.
With no further ado, here is
a summary of how the football
race in the Pacific 10 Confer
ence is shaping up, including
predicted order of finish and
enough obscure names and
facts to bore even the most ar
dent football fan.
• 1 USC (0-1 overall entering
last weekend, 0-0 in the Pac-10,
ranked #13 by the AP): USC
went to the 1988 Rose Bowl.
USC went to the 1989 Rose
Bowl. USC will go to the 1990
Rose Bowl. And they might
even win it this time.
After beating favored UCLA
in the final Pac-10 game each
of the past two years to earn
the league title, the Trojans
lost the Big One both times,
falling to Lorenzo White's
Michigan State team in 1988
and the Michigan Wolverines
last year. This year, however,
USC is a top .contender for the
national title.
How strong are the Trojans?
They ranked second in the na
tion in rushing defense last
year while giving up fewer than
15 points per game, and the
team returns 10 of 11 starters
from that unit, including three
Ail-Americans: defensive tackle
Tim Ryan and safeties Mark
Carrier and Cleveland Colter.
The Trojans did lose quar
terback Rodney Peete to the
National Football League, but
eight offensive starters are
back to join new signal-caller
Todd Marinovich, who was
highly recruited by almost
every top college.
There is no such thing as a
given in the Pac-10, but the
smart money is on USC, as
much as it pains me to say it.
•2 UCLA (0-1, 0-0, #20):
Like USC, UCLA's most press
ing need is to find a new quar
terback to replace top NFL
draftee Troy Aikman. Like
their crosstown rivals, the
Bruins will do so with Bret
Johnson, a redshirt frosh like
Marinovich.
The difference between thf;

squads is that all UCLA's toip
defensive players from last yeB.r
are gone. Defensive tackle Mike
Lodish is one of the best in the
West, and he nearly *single
handedly defeated Stanford
with the fluke play of the y(;ar
last season.
The losses of Darryl Henley,
Chance Johnson and Carnell
Lake are big blows to the Bruin
defense, but the Bruins will
still give up fewer than they
score most Saturdays this year.
The reason begins with an
offensive line that returns four
starters, including first-team
All-Pac-10 center Frank Cor
nish. Add three great tight ends
— led by Charles Arbuckle —
three of their top four rushers
and both starting wideouts re
turning from last year's team.

USC should make
its third consecutive
Rose Bowl appear
ance after winning
the Conference of
Replacement Quar
terbacks.

UCLA also has the advantage
of starting with three straight
non-conference games to tune
them up for the race for thf •
Roses. If the Trojans stumblfj,
UClj\ may be looking for its
eighth straight bowl victory on
its home field Jan. 1.
• 3 Arizona (1-1, 1-0): Ac
cording to Stanford qunrter
back Steve Smith, the Wildcats
outplayed Stanford i n the
teams' season opener. And if
the team's performance in that
game was any indication, Ari
zona is going to out play a lot
of other teams this season.
The Wildcats start with per
haps the best ground game in
the conference. Despite the fact
that fullback Art Greathouse is
still considerably hampered by
a foot injury, halfbacks Reggie
McGill (sever, carries for 58
yards against Stanford), David
Fldridge (15 for 75), and Great
house's replacement — Mario
Hampton (10 for 30) — are
capable of moving the ball well.
The Quarterback is Ronald
Veal, v/ho is not a good passer
at all. But Tony Rice of Notre
Dair.e wasn't a good passer at
the start of last year; this year
he/s a Heisman Trophy candi
date. Veal knows how to run,
and he knows how to throw
the five-yard pass to his buddies
and watch them run.
On defense, the Wildcats are
led by linebacker Chris Singleton.
The defensive line is strong
despite the graduation of
noseguard Dana Wells, the Pac-10
Defensive Player of the Year last
season.
The Wildcats don't have that
great a chance of breaking up the
top two, but they should be the
class of the middle six.
• 4 Oregon (1-0, 1-0): The
Ducks? Fourth in the conference?
In football? Is it April Ist or some
thing?
No fooling, Oregon has a good
football team. Last year they got
off to a 6-1 start (the only loss
was to USC), then quarterback
Bill Musgrave broke his collarbone
against Arizona State. Five losses
later, the Ducks had put off for
at least one more year their first
bowl game since the early '60s.
Musgrave threw only four inter
ceptions to go with his eight TDs
last year while his replacements
completed less than 42 percent of
their passes for five TDs and 21
interceptions.
Musgrave is healthy again, how
ever, and he is leading nine ad
ditional 1988 starters on offense.
Flanker Terry Obee averaged
more than 18 yards per grab last
year, and Derek Loville and Latin
Berry combined to outrush Stan
ford, Cal, ASU and OSU last year.
Defensively the Ducks gradu
ated their three top players —
Matt Brock, Scott Kozak and
Thom Kaumeyer.
Perhaps the best thing Oregon
has going, aside from Musgrave,
is the fact that they don't meet
USC this year. They won't be
spending January in Pasadena,
but if they find the consistency
they lacked last year, bowling
could well be on the agenda.

Fedel Underwood, who is quick

• 6 Washington (1-0, 0-0, #15):

Pac-10 victories than any other
coach in the league's history. Un
less something unexpected hap
pens, however, UCLA's Terry
Donahue will pass him and
James' grip on his job will become

Bears want to take the pressure
off Taylor with the ground game,
top recruit Russel WJiite will be
in the library, not cm the field.
After four tries White could not
attain the NCAA's minimun SAT
standard (a combined 700 points)
and he must sit out this year.
Defensively, Joel Dickson is
back. This guy Cardinal fans can
even like. After being switched
from linebacker to defensive line
two years ago, he had four sacks
in his first game. He was tearing
up Pac-10 offensive linemen last
year until he was shot in the
stomach while minding his own
business outside a Berkeley club
before their fifth game. He missed
the rest of the year but will team
with linebacker David Ortega and
a pair of good corners to wreak
havoc throughout the Pac-10.
The downside: Cal plays Miami
this year. . . .


t Ken Beer — Daily file
Its time again for the best and the worst of the Pac-10 to go head to head. Our sources say USC
and UCLA will fight for the league crown.
There are many advantages
in going to a school on the quar
ter system. One is that you are
able to take half again as many
different classes as you could
take on the semester system.
A second is that summer va
cation just keeps on going, even
when all your friends have to
go back to school.
Perhaps my favorite, how
ever, is that the football season
is two weeks old before school
starts, providing sports writers
with two weeks of information
to help make predictions.
With no further ado, here is
a summary of how the football
race in the Pacific 10 Confer
ence is shaping up, including
predicted order of finish and
enough obscure names and
facts to bore even the most ar
dent football fan.
• 1 USC (0-1 overall entering
last weekend, 0-0 in the Pac-10,
ranked #13 by the AP): USC
went to the 1988 Rose Bowl.
USC went to the 1989 Rose
Bowl. USC will go to the 1990
Rose Bowl. And they might
even win it this time.
After beating favored UCLA
in the final Pac-10 game each
of the past two years to earn
the league title, the Trojans
lost the Big One both times,
falling to Lorenzo White's
Michigan State team in 1988
and the Michigan Wolverines
last year. This year, however,
USC is a top .contender for the
national title.
How strong are the Trojans?
They ranked second in the na
tion in rushing defense last
year while giving up fewer than
15 points per game, and the
team returns 10 of 11 starters
from that unit, including three
Ail-Americans: defensive tackle
Tim Ryan and safeties Mark
Carrier and Cleveland Colter.
The Trojans did lose quar
terback Rodney Peete to the
National Football League, but
eight offensive starters are
back to join new signal-caller
Todd Marinovich, who was
highly recruited by almost
every top college.
There is no such thing as a
given in the Pac-10, but the
smart money is on USC, as
much as it pains me to say it.
•2 UCLA (0-1, 0-0, #20):
Like USC, UCLA's most press
ing need is to find a new quar
terback to replace top NFL
draftee Troy Aikman. Like
their crosstown rivals, the
Bruins will do so with Bret
Johnson, a redshirt frosh like
Marinovich.
The difference between thf;

squads is that all UCLA's toip
defensive players from last yeB.r
are gone. Defensive tackle Mike
Lodish is one of the best in the
West, and he nearly *single
handedly defeated Stanford
with the fluke play of the y(;ar
last season.
The losses of Darryl Henley,
Chance Johnson and Carnell
Lake are big blows to the Bruin
defense, but the Bruins will
still give up fewer than they
score most Saturdays this year.
The reason begins with an
offensive line that returns four
starters, including first-team
All-Pac-10 center Frank Cor
nish. Add three great tight ends
— led by Charles Arbuckle —
three of their top four rushers
and both starting wideouts re
turning from last year's team.

USC should make
its third consecutive
Rose Bowl appear
ance after winning
the Conference of
Replacement Quar
terbacks.

UCLA also has the advantage
of starting with three straight
non-conference games to tune
them up for the race for thf •
Roses. If the Trojans stumblfj,
UClj\ may be looking for its
eighth straight bowl victory on
its home field Jan. 1.
• 3 Arizona (1-1, 1-0): Ac
cording to Stanford qunrter
back Steve Smith, the Wildcats
outplayed Stanford i n the
teams' season opener. And if
the team's performance in that
game was any indication, Ari
zona is going to out play a lot
of other teams this season.
The Wildcats start with per
haps the best ground game in
the conference. Despite the fact
that fullback Art Greathouse is
still considerably hampered by
a foot injury, halfbacks Reggie
McGill (sever, carries for 58
yards against Stanford), David
Fldridge (15 for 75), and Great
house's replacement — Mario
Hampton (10 for 30) — are
capable of moving the ball well.
The Quarterback is Ronald
Veal, v/ho is not a good passer
at all. But Tony Rice of Notre
Dair.e wasn't a good passer at
the start of last year; this year
he/s a Heisman Trophy candi
date. Veal knows how to run,
and he knows how to throw
the five-yard pass to his buddies
and watch them run.
On defense, the Wildcats are
led by linebacker Chris Singleton.
The defensive line is strong
despite the graduation of
noseguard Dana Wells, the Pac-10
Defensive Player of the Year last
season.
The Wildcats don't have that
great a chance of breaking up the
top two, but they should be the
class of the middle six.
• 4 Oregon (1-0, 1-0): The
Ducks? Fourth in the conference?
In football? Is it April Ist or some
thing?
No fooling, Oregon has a good
football team. Last year they got
off to a 6-1 start (the only loss
was to USC), then quarterback
Bill Musgrave broke his collarbone
against Arizona State. Five losses
later, the Ducks had put off for
at least one more year their first
bowl game since the early '60s.
Musgrave threw only four inter
ceptions to go with his eight TDs
last year while his replacements
completed less than 42 percent of
their passes for five TDs and 21
interceptions.
Musgrave is healthy again, how
ever, and he is leading nine ad
ditional 1988 starters on offense.
Flanker Terry Obee averaged
more than 18 yards per grab last
year, and Derek Loville and Latin
Berry combined to outrush Stan
ford, Cal, ASU and OSU last year.
Defensively the Ducks gradu
ated their three top players —
Matt Brock, Scott Kozak and
Thom Kaumeyer.
Perhaps the best thing Oregon
has going, aside from Musgrave,
is the fact that they don't meet
USC this year. They won't be
spending January in Pasadena,
but if they find the consistency
they lacked last year, bowling
could well be on the agenda.
• 5 Arizona State (1-0, 0-0): If
scheduling were what determined
the conference champion, ASU
would be the winner hands down.
The Sun Devils don't have to play
USC. Their first four games are
at home. All are against non
league foes. Most importantly,
however, ASU leaves Tempe only
three times this year.
That's right — they have eight

home games. They also have all
their starters at the skill positions
returning, along with the Pac-10's
leading tackier last year — line
backer Mark Tingstad.
On the flip side, they only
return one starting offensive
lineman, but he is 307-pound
Fedel Underwood, who is quick
enough that he'll be playing guard
this year. Quarterback Paul Jus
tin split time last year but is the
starter after completing 56 per
cent of his passes.
• 6 Washington (1-0, 0-0, #15):
Don James enters 1989 with more
Pac-10 victories than any other
coach in the league's history. Un
less something unexpected hap
pens, however, UCLA's Terry
Donahue will pass him and
James' grip on his job will become
much more tenuous.
The Huskies do have one of the
top defensive linemen around in
300-pounder Dennis Brown. And
they have ... Um, who else do
they have? Well, that's an exag
geration; Washington has 14 re
turning starters including quar
terback Cary Conklin.
The defense, last in the league
against the run last year, does
return eight starters, for better
or worse. In addition to Brown,
cornerback Le-Lo Lang, safety
Eugene Burkhalter and line
backer Chico Fraley will lead the
Dog defense.
Washington will definitely have
a chance to win some ball games
this year, but opening the confer
ence schedule against Arizona,
USC and Oregon will give them
a stern test of the team's charac
ter.
• 7 Washington State (2-0, 0-0,
#23): The Pac-10's biggest
surprise of last year appears to
be the biggest surprise of this
year. Led by quarterback Timm
Rosenbach last year the Cougars
went 9-3, upset UCLA to hand
the Bruins their first loss and
beat Houston in the Aloha Bowl.
Rosebach's decision to go pro
following his junior season and
Coach Dennis Erickson's trip to
Miami to rcplace Jimmy (plastic
hair) Johnson appeared to move
the Cougs nearer the Pac-10 cellar.
The Cougars have continued to
smoke this year, however, trounc
ing Idaho 41-7 and upsetting then-
No. 24 Brigham Young. The key
has been the play of quarterback
Brad Gossen, who has had two
Rosenbach-like games so far this

year. He has the advantage of
being able to throw to Tim Stal
lworth, a 1000-yard receiver last
year, as well as returning starter
Doug Wellsandt at tight end.
In the backfield are Steve
Broussard, the Pac-10's leader in
all-purpose running last year, and
Rich Swinton, who rushed for 980
yards last season.
The defense of the Cougars has
always been a problem, and with
only four returning starters, it
will be again this year. But, hey
— giving up 45 points a game
isn't so bad if you're scoring 50.
• 8 Stanford (0-2, 0-2): see page
D-3 for Stanford preview
• 9 Oregon State (1-0, 1-0): The
problem with playing in the Pac
-10 these days is the bad teams
just keep getting better and bet
ter. Oregon State and Washington
State had spent so many years in
the cellar that they were on a
first-name basis with the rats
there, but no more. Washington
State has been a have instead of

a have-not the past year and a
half, and the Beavers appear
ready to join them.
Unfortunately, starting QB
Erik Wilhelm is gone. The main
man in the Air Express is now in
the NFL, but replacement Nick
Schichtle gave a fine account of
himself against Stanford a week
ago. He has top tight end Phil
Ross and running back Pat Chaf
fee to receive his air mail, and he
can hand to Chaffee for variety.
Either way, forward progress in
large chunks will be the norm.
The Beavers are even starting
to play defense this year. After
holding only three teams to fewer
than 20 points all last year, the
Beavers look ready to improve
their defense's image.
• 10 California (0-1, 0-1): Oh
those hurtin' Golden Bears. Last
last year and, most likely, last this
year. They have the best quarter
back in the league in Troy Taylor
but unless he can throw from his
back and on the run, college foot

ball fans will have no idea how
good he is.
Cal's offensive line is clearly
their biggest concern. And if the
Bears want to take the pressure
off Taylor with the ground game,
top recruit Russel WJiite will be
in the library, not cm the field.
After four tries White could not
attain the NCAA's minimun SAT
standard (a combined 700 points)
and he must sit out this year.
Defensively, Joel Dickson is

and watch them run.
On defense, the Wildcats are
led by linebacker Chris Singleton.
The defensive line is strong
despite the graduation of
noseguard Dana Wells, the Pac-10
Defensive Player of the Year last
season.
The Wildcats don't have that
great a chance of breaking up the
top two, but they should be the
class of the middle six.
• 4 Oregon (1-0, 1-0): The
Ducks? Fourth in the conference?
In football? Is it April Ist or some
thing?
No fooling, Oregon has a good
football team. Last year they got
off to a 6-1 start (the only loss
was to USC), then quarterback
Bill Musgrave broke his collarbone
against Arizona State. Five losses
later, the Ducks had put off for
at least one more year their first
bowl game since the early '60s.
Musgrave threw only four inter
ceptions to go with his eight TDs
last year while his replacements
completed less than 42 percent of
their passes for five TDs and 21
interceptions.
Musgrave is healthy again, how
ever, and he is leading nine ad
ditional 1988 starters on offense.
Flanker Terry Obee averaged
more than 18 yards per grab last
year, and Derek Loville and Latin
Berry combined to outrush Stan
ford, Cal, ASU and OSU last year.
Defensively the Ducks gradu
ated their three top players —
Matt Brock, Scott Kozak and
Thom Kaumeyer.
Perhaps the best thing Oregon
has going, aside from Musgrave,
is the fact that they don't meet
USC this year. They won't be
spending January in Pasadena,
but if they find the consistency
they lacked last year, bowling
could well be on the agenda.
• 5 Arizona State (1-0, 0-0): If
scheduling were what determined
the conference champion, ASU
would be the winner hands down.
The Sun Devils don't have to play
USC. Their first four games are
at home. All are against non
league foes. Most importantly,
however, ASU leaves Tempe only
three times this year.
That's right — they have eight

home games. They also have all
their starters at the skill positions
returning, along with the Pac-10's
leading tackier last year — line
backer Mark Tingstad.
On the flip side, they only
return one starting offensive
lineman, but he is 307-pound
Fedel Underwood, who is quick
enough that he'll be playing guard
this year. Quarterback Paul Jus
tin split time last year but is the
starter after completing 56 per
cent of his passes.
• 6 Washington (1-0, 0-0, #15):
Don James enters 1989 with more
Pac-10 victories than any other
coach in the league's history. Un
less something unexpected hap
pens, however, UCLA's Terry
Donahue will pass him and
James' grip on his job will become
much more tenuous.
The Huskies do have one of the
top defensive linemen around in
300-pounder Dennis Brown. And
they have ... Um, who else do
they have? Well, that's an exag
geration; Washington has 14 re
turning starters including quar
terback Cary Conklin.
The defense, last in the league
against the run last year, does
return eight starters, for better
or worse. In addition to Brown,
cornerback Le-Lo Lang, safety
Eugene Burkhalter and line
backer Chico Fraley will lead the
Dog defense.
Washington will definitely have
a chance to win some ball games
this year, but opening the confer
ence schedule against Arizona,
USC and Oregon will give them
a stern test of the team's charac
ter.
• 7 Washington State (2-0, 0-0,
#23): The Pac-10's biggest
surprise of last year appears to
be the biggest surprise of this
year. Led by quarterback Timm
Rosenbach last year the Cougars
went 9-3, upset UCLA to hand
the Bruins their first loss and
beat Houston in the Aloha Bowl.
Rosebach's decision to go pro
following his junior season and
Coach Dennis Erickson's trip to
Miami to rcplace Jimmy (plastic
hair) Johnson appeared to move
the Cougs nearer the Pac-10 cellar.
The Cougars have continued to
smoke this year, however, trounc
ing Idaho 41-7 and upsetting then-
No. 24 Brigham Young. The key
has been the play of quarterback
Brad Gossen, who has had two
Rosenbach-like games so far this

year. He has the advantage of
being able to throw to Tim Stal
lworth, a 1000-yard receiver last
year, as well as returning starter
Doug Wellsandt at tight end.
In the backfield are Steve
Broussard, the Pac-10's leader in
all-purpose running last year, and
Rich Swinton, who rushed for 980
yards last season.
The defense of the Cougars has
always been a problem, and with
only four returning starters, it
will be again this year. But, hey
— giving up 45 points a game
isn't so bad if you're scoring 50.
• 8 Stanford (0-2, 0-2): see page
D-3 for Stanford preview
• 9 Oregon State (1-0, 1-0): The
problem with playing in the Pac
-10 these days is the bad teams
just keep getting better and bet
ter. Oregon State and Washington
State had spent so many years in
the cellar that they were on a
first-name basis with the rats
there, but no more. Washington
State has been a have instead of

a have-not the past year and a
half, and the Beavers appear
ready to join them.
Unfortunately, starting QB
Erik Wilhelm is gone. The main
man in the Air Express is now in
the NFL, but replacement Nick
Schichtle gave a fine account of
himself against Stanford a week
ago. He has top tight end Phil
Ross and running back Pat Chaf
fee to receive his air mail, and he
can hand to Chaffee for variety.
Either way, forward progress in
large chunks will be the norm.
The Beavers are even starting
to play defense this year. After
holding only three teams to fewer
than 20 points all last year, the
Beavers look ready to improve
their defense's image.
• 10 California (0-1, 0-1): Oh
those hurtin' Golden Bears. Last
last year and, most likely, last this
year. They have the best quarter
back in the league in Troy Taylor
but unless he can throw from his
back and on the run, college foot

ball fans will have no idea how
good he is.
Cal's offensive line is clearly
their biggest concern. And if the
Bears want to take the pressure
off Taylor with the ground game,
top recruit Russel WJiite will be
in the library, not cm the field.
After four tries White could not
attain the NCAA's minimun SAT
standard (a combined 700 points)
and he must sit out this year.
Defensively, Joel Dickson is
back. This guy Cardinal fans can
even like. After being switched
from linebacker to defensive line
two years ago, he had four sacks
in his first game. He was tearing
up Pac-10 offensive linemen last
year until he was shot in the
stomach while minding his own
business outside a Berkeley club
before their fifth game. He missed
the rest of the year but will team
with linebacker David Ortega and
a pair of good corners to wreak
havoc throughout the Pac-10.
The downside: Cal plays Miami
this year. . . .

Its time again for the best and the worst of the Pac-10 to go head to head. Our sources say USC
and UCLA will fight for the league crown.
