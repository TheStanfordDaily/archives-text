# Cardinal and Bruins again the teams to beat
## 
### Chris Crader Editorial staff 
Much like the summer televi
sion schedule, the women's volley
ball race in the Pacific 10 Con
ference looks like a repeat. After
UCLA and Stanford dominated
their opponents all season long in
1988, little will change this year.
Both squads return five of six
starters and were ranked one and
two, respectively, in the national
pre-season poll.
Below these two, however, the
Pac-10 will be very competitive as
three teams have good shots at
third place. Top to bottom, the
Pac-10 will be somewhat stronger
this year than last, and seven of
the 10 Pac-10 teams went to the
NCAA Tournament last year.
Here, in order, is a brief run
down of the key players for the
teams contending, hoping to con
tend, and praying to contend
sometime this century.
• 1 (tie) Stanford (1-1, ranked #2
in the nation): please see article,
page D-?.
• 1 (tie) UCLA (3-1, #3): Like
Stanford, the Bruins return five
starters from last year's squad, a
team that was 34-0 before being
upset by Texas at the Final Four.
Leading the way is 1988 Pac-10
Player of the Year Daiva Tomkus.
The Bruins also return All-
American Elaine Youngs in the
middle and outside hitters
Samantha Shaver, Jenny Crocker,
Laurie Jones and Jenny Evans,
to go along with incoming fresh
man Natalie Williams, a great
leaper who hits as hard as anyone
in the country. Their biggest con
cern is replacing first-team All-
American setter Ann Boyer. With
T'raci Broadway and Jennifer
Gratteau fighting for the starting
setter spot, the Bruins were upset
at Hawaii. If that and all the other
positions stabilize, the Bruins just
may win the NCAA title they
thought they had last year. If not,
UCLA will have a tough time
trying to defend their Pac-10 title.
• 3 USC (4-3, #19): USC

struggled at times last year
despite a lot of talent, but that
will likely not be the case under
new Coach Lisa Love this year.
The Trojans return four starters
from last year's fourth-place team
and should be improved. Setter
Christine Brigman will look for
outside hitter Yleana Carrasco
and middle blocker Megan McCal
lister as often as she can. Junior
Lonise Norfleet, at 6-foot-2, is one
of the most physically intimidat
ing outside hitters in the league
and spot starter Jill Daniels is
also of Pac-10 caliber. A good
recruiting year should help fix the
depth problem USC had last year,
but not enough to challenge the
top two.
• 4 California (7-0, #9): The
Golden Bear men's squad won the
national club team championship
last season, upsetting favorite
Brigham Young in the final
match. The women won't be able
to match that feat, but they
definitely have the talent to im
prove on last year's 19-15 mark.
Senior outside hitter Tiffany Roc
helle and junior outside hitter
Lisa Arce return as one of the
best one-two combinations in the
league, and they have junior Holly
McPeak, a former NCAA Fresh
man of the Year, to set balls to
them. Two other starters return
and Coach Dave DeGroot has
added transfer Jackie Cook, a
junior college All-American last
year at Golden West, in an effort
to move the Bears into the upper
division of the Pac-10. On the
downside, their top high school
recruit, Lynn Patrick, suffered a
season-ending knee injury at the
All-Cal Tournament. Cal took sec
ond there to UCLA, losing the
final two games to one. Cal also
won another tournament, defeat
ing Arizona State and BYU in the
process.
• 5 Washington (3-3, #15): Com
ing off their best year in recent
memory, the Huskies will find one
thing out quickly: It will be hard
to repeat their third-place finish
without their best player in recent
memory. The graduation of out

side hitter Laurie Wetzel, the
catalyst in the Huskies' upset of
Stanford in last year's NCAA
Tournament, doesn't leave the
Washington cupboard bare, how
ever. The team returns the top
setter in the conference in
Melinda Beckenhauer and two
good outside hitters: Lisa McCam
mond and Kayley Grim. If middle
blocker Gail Thorpe improves as
much this year as she did last
year, Washington will challenge
seriously for third in the Pac-10
and a top-10 national ranking.
• 6 Oregon (9-0): Duck fans prob
ably still don't believe last year
actually happened. After a 7-3
start, Oregon lost 16 of 17, in
cluding their final 13, to finish
tied for last in the Pac-10. This
year, the team got off to a 6-0
start behind the play of setter
Stephanie Snyder and middle
blocker Dawnn Charroin. Snyder,
who led the nation in assists as
a freshman, was the first Pac-10
Player of the Week this year after
leading the Ducks to the title in
the Lady Ute Classic in Salt Lake
City. Senior Michele Krebsbach
broke her hand the second day of
practice and should return by the
end of the month but Charroin,
a member of the Pac-10 All-
Freshman team last year, has
carried the load, leading the team
in kills in each of their first six
matches. With starters Mindee
Adams and Melissa Terzian also
back, Oregon is a definite threat
to all opponents.
• 7 Arizona (6-1, #12): The Wild
cats should be a very good team
this year. There are just six better
teams in their conference. Talk
about Arizona begins with junior
outside hitter Terry Lauchner, a
member of the All-Freshman
team in 1987 and the all-league
team in 1988. Senior Kelly Waage
is one of the best blockers in the
league and both Mary Linton and
Lindsay Hahn are capable setters.
Two starters did graduate, and
one returning starter, Caylin
Combs, hit only .135 last season,


Benjamin Tong — Daily file
Kristin Klein of Stanford and Elaine Youngs, the Pac-10's two All-American frosh last year, will do
battle often in 1989 as their two teams are the class of the league.
