# Top-ranked water polo seeking another NCAA title

Stanford water polo.
The pattern? A tradition of winning.
A tradition which, at least for Stanford's
water polo team, should continue un
abated in 1989.
First, a glimpse at the tradition: six
national championships in the past 15
years, 10 Pacific 10 Conference champi
onships during the same period; a 66-28
record playing in the nation's most dom
inant conference, and a 349-78-6 record
overall second to none; two undefeated
seasons in the 1980s; a list of Ail-
Americans and Olympians so long it
reaches the point of absurdity.
One might think such a history would
gain Stanford the title of national col
legiate water polo capital.
Such might be the case, were it not
for an old cross-Bay rival. That rival has
won eight NCAA titles itself, including
the last two. In fact, since 1975, the
national champ has been either Stanford
or California.
For 1989, Stanford is coming off of
two disappointing seasons (sixth and
fourth place national finishes, respective
ly), but the team looks as sharp as ever.
In the 1989 U.S. Summer Nationals,
the Cardinal played a Pepperdine team
featuring top players from the Australian
and Yugoslavian National Teams, as well
as Craig Wilson and Terry Schroeder,
two of the best players the United States
has ever produced. Stanford won by a
considerable margin.
The top-ranked Cardinal dove into the
1989 fall season with a splash, defeating
the Enemy, California, 10-8, and Pacific,
9-6, to capture the NorCal Cup. They
have also played at UC-Santa Barbara
and the Irvine Tournament, and today's
victim is Navy. Senior holeman Eric Blum

For 1989, Stanford is
coming off of two dis
appointing seasons,
but the team looks as
sharp as ever.

transferred from Navy after his freshman
year and will be looking to do some
serious damage.
Under Coach Dante Dettamanti's
tutelage, Stanford has traditionally been
a quick team, particularly lethal on fast
breaks. But swift swimming tires a body,
and Dettamanti's strategy requires fre
quent substitutions, making team depth
that much more important.
This year, "We have more depth than
I've ever had here," says Dettamanti,
which means the Cardinal should be
splashing rings around their opponents.
Another key to their success will be
their performance on "man-up" plays,
similar to the power play in hockey. So
far this season, the Cardinal has scored
on 75 percent of such opportunities while
allowing opponents only a 20-percent suc
cess rate, according to Dettamanti.
Considering that in a typical water polo
game five to eight such plays occur, suc
cess here could be critical, particularly
between teams as closely matched as Cal
ifornia and Stanford, says Dettamanti.
Always important for the success of a
water polo team is the the play of the
goalkeeper. "No team has won a cham
pionship without great goalkeeping," says
Dettamanti, and great goalkeeping the
Cardinal has got. In senior Todd Kemp,
a three-time All American and MVP of
the 1989 Summer Nationals (among
other accolades), Stanford has perhaps
the best collegiate goalkeeper in the coun

try, and Dettamanti has great confidence
in his backup, sophomore Jim Cairns, as
well.
The other key player on a water polo
team is the holeman, or two-meter man.
Stanford sports "the best trio of two
meter men in the country," says Det
tamanti, including senior All-American
Blum, junior All-American Rick McNair

and sophomore Greg Morris, who was
recruited as the No. 1 high school two
meter man a year ago and who definitely
possesses All-America potential.
Senior Jon Swerdloff and redshirt
junior Jeff Oeding round-out the list of
All-America candidates. Both are high
powered shooters and are expected to
help keep opponents playing catch-up on

the scoreboard.
When asked about the prospects for
the season, Dettamanti smiles and says,
"Top four almost definitely . . . hopefully
the top half of that — one or two." But
you can see in the twinkle of his eyes
that he's thinking Number One.
Dettamanti knows. Sometimes, history
does repeat itself.

Notre Dame football.
Duke basketball.
UCLA softball.
Stanford water polo.
The pattern? A tradition of winning.
A tradition which, at least for Stanford's
water polo team, should continue un
abated in 1989.
First, a glimpse at the tradition: six
national championships in the past 15
years, 10 Pacific 10 Conference champi
onships during the same period; a 66-28
record playing in the nation's most dom
inant conference, and a 349-78-6 record
overall second to none; two undefeated
seasons in the 1980s; a list of Ail-
Americans and Olympians so long it
reaches the point of absurdity.
One might think such a history would
gain Stanford the title of national col
legiate water polo capital.
Such might be the case, were it not
for an old cross-Bay rival. That rival has
won eight NCAA titles itself, including
the last two. In fact, since 1975, the
national champ has been either Stanford
or California.
For 1989, Stanford is coming off of
two disappointing seasons (sixth and
fourth place national finishes, respective
ly), but the team looks as sharp as ever.
In the 1989 U.S. Summer Nationals,
the Cardinal played a Pepperdine team
featuring top players from the Australian
and Yugoslavian National Teams, as well
as Craig Wilson and Terry Schroeder,
two of the best players the United States
has ever produced. Stanford won by a
considerable margin.
The top-ranked Cardinal dove into the
1989 fall season with a splash, defeating
the Enemy, California, 10-8, and Pacific,
9-6, to capture the NorCal Cup. They
have also played at UC-Santa Barbara
and the Irvine Tournament, and today's
victim is Navy. Senior holeman Eric Blum

transferred from Navy after his freshman
year and will be looking to do some
serious damage.
Under Coach Dante Dettamanti's
tutelage, Stanford has traditionally been
a quick team, particularly lethal on fast
breaks. But swift swimming tires a body,
and Dettamanti's strategy requires fre
quent substitutions, making team depth
that much more important.
This year, "We have more depth than
I've ever had here," says Dettamanti,
which means the Cardinal should be
splashing rings around their opponents.
Another key to their success will be
their performance on "man-up" plays,
similar to the power play in hockey. So
far this season, the Cardinal has scored
on 75 percent of such opportunities while
allowing opponents only a 20-percent suc
cess rate, according to Dettamanti.
Considering that in a typical water polo
game five to eight such plays occur, suc
cess here could be critical, particularly
between teams as closely matched as Cal
ifornia and Stanford, says Dettamanti.
Always important for the success of a
water polo team is the the play of the
goalkeeper. "No team has won a cham
pionship without great goalkeeping," says
Dettamanti, and great goalkeeping the
Cardinal has got. In senior Todd Kemp,
a three-time All American and MVP of
the 1989 Summer Nationals (among
other accolades), Stanford has perhaps
the best collegiate goalkeeper in the coun

try, and Dettamanti has great confidence
in his backup, sophomore Jim Cairns, as
well.
The other key player on a water polo
team is the holeman, or two-meter man.
Stanford sports "the best trio of two
meter men in the country," says Det
tamanti, including senior All-American
Blum, junior All-American Rick McNair

and sophomore Greg Morris, who was
recruited as the No. 1 high school two
meter man a year ago and who definitely
possesses All-America potential.
