# Welcome to more fun than a sports fan can stand
## 
### 
If you're a sports fan, you'll
know this scene:
You're sitting in your living
room watching your favorite foot
ball team — the Bears, the Giants,
the Raiders, whatever. They've
played a pretty decent game but
they're trailing by four with 2:23
on the clock.
They start on their own 23-yard
line, a lot of field ahead of them.
A field goal is less than worthless.
But, you have hope. Jim Kelly,
Boomer Esiason, Randall Cun
ningham, whoever — is your QB,
and he's a wizard at running the
two-minute drill.
A quick out nets 10 yards. Then
a throw over the middle and your
boys are at midfield. Timeout.
The coach — Don Shula, Jerry
Glanville, Jerry Burns, what's his
name — calls a draw play. The
defense is caught off guard.
Twenty-two-yard gain to the 28.
You're bouncing off the walls
with anticipation. "Go for the end

zone. Get it to Jerry Rice, Art
Monk, Sterling Sharpe, that fast
guy." The clock is ticking away
in the lower right-hand corner of
the screen.
The ball is snapped. The quar
terback drops into the pocket. The
receiver heads for the post, then
for the corner, then the post. The
QB lets go of a perfect spiral.
It's in the air for what seems
like forever.
The ball slowly descends, arcing
downward into the waiting arms

of Steve Largent, Mark Bavaro,
Herschel Walker, that first-round
draft choice. He clutches it.
Touchdown!
Your team wins.
You win.
You go bananas. You're scream
ing so loud your throat hurts. You
feel like everything's all right with
the world.
In reality, a bunch of guys
you've never met and who are
primarily in it for the money could
care less what you think.
Still, you're lovin' it. The
vicarious thrill of the sports fan.
There's nothing quite like it.
Okay, now take that Monday
Night Football Mania and
multiply it 100 times.
That, in a nutshell, is the way
the college sports fan feels when
he (or she) is rooting for his
school.
You — the lucky 1,500 men and
women who Dean Jean & Co.

deemed "Stanford Material" —
will get to eat, sleep and breathe
this mania for the next four years.
Get a head start by hitting
Stanford Stadium for the football
game. Though the team hasn't
had many winning seasons of late,
they also have a few surprises up
their sleeves. And, they promise
to get better with each passing
week.
Football on TV is fun. Football
on Saturday when you're rooting
for a bunch of guys in your dorm
is killer (if I may use a bit of
California-speak).
Visit deGuerre and learn what
water polo is. The Cardinal is
going to be awesome so, even if
you're clueless, you probably see
them win. Check out our compet
itive soccer squads — especially
Berhane Andeberhan's women —
and catch some field hockey.
As soon as you find the time,
catch a volleyball match at Old
Pavilion. This cozy arena has

housed a bunch of boring offices
for the past few seasons. Now,
it's returned to its roots and the
women's volleyball team should
bring the house down.
To be honest, though, fall quar
ter is really just a warmup. It's
a training camp for the Stanford
fan. For, though the weather
turns colder, things heat up faster
than you can spell microwave in
the winter.
Maples Pavilion used to be
a dark, empty basketball
facility where Stanford
teams would play to silent crowds
and lose a lot of games.
Last season, as if transformed
by some supernatural force,
Maples rocked and rolled every
time the Cardinal took the floor.
The men, as you've no doubt
heard, reached the NCAAs for the
first time in nearly half a century.
The women are going to be reach
ing for the brass ring this year.

Guaranteed, you'll scream your
self hoarse. And, you'll be ex
hausted from jumping up and
down almost as much as the
players. College basketball is the
essence of college sports. It's
mystical and magical, and you
need not be a sports fan to get
drawn in by the hoopla.
Get your season passes early.
They're guaranteed to sell out.
In the meantime, meet some
of your classmates who'll
carry on the great Cardinal
tradition.
Say hello to Bob Whitfield.
Have lunch with Meredith
McGrath. Sit next to Jonathan
Stark in CIV. Study chemistry
with Val Whiting.
The great athletes among you
are often among the best in their
sport anywhere. And, much more
often than not, they're good
people as well.
See you at the ballgame.

the screen.
The ball is snapped. The quar
terback drops into the pocket. The
receiver heads for the post, then
for the corner, then the post. The
QB lets go of a perfect spiral.
It's in the air for what seems
like forever.
The ball slowly descends, arcing
downward into the waiting arms

of Steve Largent, Mark Bavaro,
Herschel Walker, that first-round
draft choice. He clutches it.
Touchdown!
Your team wins.
You win.
You go bananas. You're scream
ing so loud your throat hurts. You
feel like everything's all right with
the world.
In reality, a bunch of guys
you've never met and who are
primarily in it for the money could
care less what you think.
Still, you're lovin' it. The
vicarious thrill of the sports fan.
There's nothing quite like it.
Okay, now take that Monday
Night Football Mania and
multiply it 100 times.
That, in a nutshell, is the way
the college sports fan feels when
he (or she) is rooting for his
school.
You — the lucky 1,500 men and
women who Dean Jean & Co.

deemed "Stanford Material" —
will get to eat, sleep and breathe
this mania for the next four years.
Get a head start by hitting
Stanford Stadium for the football
game. Though the team hasn't
had many winning seasons of late,
they also have a few surprises up
their sleeves. And, they promise
to get better with each passing
week.
Football on TV is fun. Football
on Saturday when you're rooting
for a bunch of guys in your dorm
is killer (if I may use a bit of
California-speak).
Visit deGuerre and learn what
water polo is. The Cardinal is
going to be awesome so, even if
you're clueless, you probably see
them win. Check out our compet
itive soccer squads — especially
Berhane Andeberhan's women —
and catch some field hockey.
As soon as you find the time,
catch a volleyball match at Old
Pavilion. This cozy arena has

housed a bunch of boring offices
for the past few seasons. Now,
it's returned to its roots and the
women's volleyball team should
bring the house down.
To be honest, though, fall quar
ter is really just a warmup. It's
a training camp for the Stanford
fan. For, though the weather
turns colder, things heat up faster
than you can spell microwave in
the winter.
Maples Pavilion used to be
a dark, empty basketball
facility where Stanford
teams would play to silent crowds
and lose a lot of games.
Last season, as if transformed
by some supernatural force,
Maples rocked and rolled every
time the Cardinal took the floor.
The men, as you've no doubt
heard, reached the NCAAs for the
first time in nearly half a century.
The women are going to be reach
ing for the brass ring this year.

Guaranteed, you'll scream your
self hoarse. And, you'll be ex
hausted from jumping up and
down almost as much as the
players. College basketball is the
essence of college sports. It's
mystical and magical, and you
need not be a sports fan to get
drawn in by the hoopla.
Get your season passes early.
They're guaranteed to sell out.
In the meantime, meet some
of your classmates who'll
carry on the great Cardinal
tradition.
Say hello to Bob Whitfield.
Have lunch with Meredith
McGrath. Sit next to Jonathan
Stark in CIV. Study chemistry
with Val Whiting.
The great athletes among you
are often among the best in their
sport anywhere. And, much more
often than not, they're good
people as well.
See you at the ballgame.

If you're a sports fan, you'll
know this scene:
You're sitting in your living
room watching your favorite foot
ball team — the Bears, the Giants,
the Raiders, whatever. They've
played a pretty decent game but
they're trailing by four with 2:23
on the clock.
They start on their own 23-yard
line, a lot of field ahead of them.
A field goal is less than worthless.
But, you have hope. Jim Kelly,
Boomer Esiason, Randall Cun
ningham, whoever — is your QB,
and he's a wizard at running the
two-minute drill.
A quick out nets 10 yards. Then
a throw over the middle and your
boys are at midfield. Timeout.
The coach — Don Shula, Jerry
Glanville, Jerry Burns, what's his
name — calls a draw play. The
defense is caught off guard.
Twenty-two-yard gain to the 28.
You're bouncing off the walls
with anticipation. "Go for the end

zone. Get it to Jerry Rice, Art
Monk, Sterling Sharpe, that fast
guy." The clock is ticking away
in the lower right-hand corner of
the screen.
The ball is snapped. The quar
terback drops into the pocket. The
receiver heads for the post, then
for the corner, then the post. The
QB lets go of a perfect spiral.
It's in the air for what seems
like forever.
The ball slowly descends, arcing
downward into the waiting arms

of Steve Largent, Mark Bavaro,
Herschel Walker, that first-round
draft choice. He clutches it.
