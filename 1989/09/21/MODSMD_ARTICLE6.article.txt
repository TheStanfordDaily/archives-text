Freshmen Beware: Despite
what you may think, you have
not left the "Zone of Annoying
Questions" you found yourself in
when you began the college search
and thought you left behind when
you got into Stanford.
Now the second round begins.
It goes something like this: "What
are you majoring in?" For most
freshmen, as well as upperclass
men, this can be just as un
pleasant to answer as, "Where are
you applying to school?"
Freshman Laura Shaffer is an
exception because she has already
formulated a plan for her future.
"I'm going to mtyor in math and
eventually become a math profes
sor," Shaffer said. In fact, one
reason she chose Stanford was for
its renowned mathematics depart
ment.
During her senior year at Uni
versity High School in Tucson,
Ariz., she was involved in a year
long senior colloquium. "It's like
a thesis. You are expected to
design your own project which will
take the student beyond the class
room," says Shaffer, who will be

living at Burbank House in Wil
bur Hall.
She was paired with a professor
at the University of Arizona and
chose the subject of number the
ory and cryptology. "I was looking
through some books and this topic
was one of the ones I found in
teresting," she said.
Despite her math pursuits,
Shaffer credits Jay Barwell, her
eighth grade English and jour
nalism teacher, as being a prime
motivator of her academic
curiosity. "He's always been a
friend. He pushed me to do all
that I could with whatever I really
enjoyed," she said.
In school Shaffer was also ac
tively involved in student govern
ment. She was treasurer of her
student council and completed
many projects besides the regular
dance-decorating-duties.
"While I was on the public serv
ice committee 1 undertook a proj
ect called Generations Together,"
Shaffer said. "A group of four stu
dents would adopt an elderly cou
ple in their community and help
them with house and garden
maintenance which they were un
able to do on their own."

This past January, Shaffer was
chosen to be on the U.S. Senate
Youth Delegation with students
from all over the nation. "We
spent a week in Washington, D.C.
meeting many politicians at all
levels of government. The Presi
dent also waved to us as he walked
by us on the White House lawn,"
she remembered.
Shaffer has also been playing
the piano for 15 years. "My grand
father is semi-professional and
plays for weddings. He sat me
down and got me started."
Her high school, she explained,
is unusual because even though
it is public she had to apply to
the gifted school. She sees
similarities between students in
her high school and those at Stan
ford.
"When I was at Stanford I was
impressed by how everyone
wanted to be there. They had an
interest in pursuing their educa
tion. In high school everyone had
chosen to go to my school and
work hard as well," Shaffer said.
She admits that there was a lot
of competition in an environment
with so many talented students,
but that it was not all bad.
