# Soccer set to surprise
## 
### Chris Crader Editorial staff 
Stanford's favorite rags-to
riches story of last year just
traded in its BMW for a Rolls-
Royce.
That's right. The women's soc
cer team which went 13-4-2 last
season to earn their first-ever na
tional ranking (they finished at
#17) is going to be even better.
In fact, according to Coach Ber
hane Andeberhan, there is no
need to speculate about the 1989
edition being an improvement
over last year's team.
"It already is," he said. "The
returning people have worked so
hard to improve themselves. We
had an excellent recruiting
year. . . . The recruits are giving
everything we needed and more."
The team's opener, against
Western Washington University
Sept. 6, proved just that. Despite
the fact that Stanford was com
pletely outplaying the Vikings, the
score was still 0-0 after 29
minutes. But freshman forward
Jennifer Potok notched her first
collegiate goal off a pass from
junior Jennifer Bloomer. Nine
minutes later Potok scored again,
giving the Cardinal a 2-0 lead at
the intermission.
Potok completed her hat trick
less than 10 minutes into the sec
ond half, then classmate Julie
Foudy, the top recruit in the na
tion, put her name in the scoring
column 13 minutes later. Junior
Jennifer Rowland, the team's
leading scorer last year, completed
the 5-0 romp with a goal with 10
minutes remaining.
"I think we're playing really
well," goalkeeper Elise Edwards
said. "We had a good base to start
with. All the players worked really
hard in the off-season. We have
a couple of superstar freshmen.
The team has come together
really well."
The combination of youth and
experience is just what the Car
dinal needs this year in facing the
school's most difficult schedule
ever. Stanford, ranked 15th in the
latest poll, plays at No. 3 Califor
nia, No. 6 Colorado College, No.
8 Virginia and No. 14 St. Mary's
and hosts No. 4 Wisconsin, No. 9
UC-Santa Barbara and North
Carolina. How good are the Tar

Heels? In the eight years the
NCAA has sponsored NCAA
playoffs for women's sports, UNC
has captured seven national titles.
And yes, they are ranked No. 1
this year.
Can Stanford compete against
these teams? "We can," Andeber
han said. "They should all be
favored but we can beat them. . . .
We know they have strong teams
and definitely should be favored,
but we feel we have a strong team
and have a chance to beat them.
"I think we deserve to be
ranked in the top 20," he contin
ued. "Whether we're a top-10
team or not, we'll have to see. . . .
Whether we're a championship
caliber team or not, I don't know."
Potok shares her coach's op
timism. "I think we're doing so
well," she said. "We've worked
really hard. . . . We have the po
tential to be in the final four."
Stanford has also defeated both
Sonoma State and San Francisco
State to run its record to 3-0 on
the season. The Cardinal met
Sonoma State Sept. 9 and came
away with a 2-0 win. Jennifer
Rowland opened the scoring by
taking a pass from Foudy 15
minutes into the game, took two
dribbles and shot past the
goalkeeper. Seventeen minutes
later Foudy, who has played for
the U.S. National Team on many
occasions, was on the receiving
end of a corner kick from sopho
more Elizabeth Joneschild and
headed the ball into the back of
the net.
Sonoma State is ranked third
in the preseason Division II poll,
but according to Andeberhan,
"They are definitely one of the
top 20 teams in the country, if
you take all divisions."
Against the Gators Sept. 13,
Stanford took a 5-0 lead in the
first half and cruised to a 8-0 win.
Foudy scored three times and had
two assists, Rowland had two
goals and an assist, Lisa Sime had
one score and one assist, Tonya
Antonucci and Joneschild scored
once each and Carolyn Einstein
added an assist.
In addition to talented new
comers Foudy, Potok and Kirby
Seale, all highly-sought recruits,
Andeberhan has watched some of
his other freshmen develop rapid
lv. "Wendy Kevan, Carolyn

Einstein and Lesley Edwards . . .
they've just been wonderful
surprises," he said.
And the veterans have held up
their end of the bargain. Edwards,
a junior, was an All-Far West se
lection last year after posting 12
shutouts in 19 games. Rowland,
who scored nine goals last year,
and sweeper Heather Mclntyre
were also All-Far West selections
last year.
Other returning starters in
clude junior forward Sime, the
team's No. 2 scorer last year,
midfielders Antonucci, Bloomer
and Kerri Stivaletti and defenders
Christine Martin and Blair El
liott.
"Last year we were often an
underdog," Elise Edwards said.
"We were often not that aggres
sive. We were more defensive.
This year we have the talent and
the skill where we can put more
pressure on the other team.
"We definitely have the poten
tial to be a competitor in the na
tional tournament," Edwards con
tinued. "We just have to live up
to that potential. That's the hard
est part because things have gone
along so quickly this year."
If the Cardinal continues to im
prove, however, the sky appears
to be the limit.
"Everyone on this team is really
skilled and really good," Potok
said after her three-goal perform
ance. I was surprised I was start
ing. And happy, too."
If she and her teammates keep
playing up to their potential, they
might be pretty happy pretty often
this year.
Card notes
Mclntyre, the team's top defender in
1988, missed the first three games
this year due to a sprained ankle suf
fered the first day of practice. Sime
missed the opener with a sore back
but returned to the lineup against
Sonoma State, nearly scoring a goal
within a minute of coming on the
field.
Stanford traveled Friday to Division
ll's top-ranked team, Cal State-
Hayward, and hosted Texas Christian
Sunday. The team plays at Northern
Colorado tomorrow and at Colorado
College Saturday. Colorado College is
the alma mater of new Cardinal as
sistant Jeanine Szpara, a four-time
All-American goalkeeper.

Sonoma State Sept. 9 and came
away with a 2-0 win. Jennifer
Rowland opened the scoring by
taking a pass from Foudy 15
minutes into the game, took two
dribbles and shot past the
goalkeeper. Seventeen minutes
later Foudy, who has played for
the U.S. National Team on many
occasions, was on the receiving
end of a corner kick from sopho
more Elizabeth Joneschild and
headed the ball into the back of
the net.
Sonoma State is ranked third
in the preseason Division II poll,
but according to Andeberhan,
"They are definitely one of the
top 20 teams in the country, if
you take all divisions."
Against the Gators Sept. 13,
Stanford took a 5-0 lead in the
first half and cruised to a 8-0 win.
Foudy scored three times and had
two assists, Rowland had two
goals and an assist, Lisa Sime had
one score and one assist, Tonya
Antonucci and Joneschild scored
once each and Carolyn Einstein
added an assist.
In addition to talented new
comers Foudy, Potok and Kirby
Seale, all highly-sought recruits,
Andeberhan has watched some of
his other freshmen develop rapid
lv. "Wendy Kevan, Carolyn

Einstein and Lesley Edwards . . .
they've just been wonderful
surprises," he said.
And the veterans have held up
their end of the bargain. Edwards,
a junior, was an All-Far West se
lection last year after posting 12
shutouts in 19 games. Rowland,
who scored nine goals last year,
and sweeper Heather Mclntyre
were also All-Far West selections
last year.
Other returning starters in
clude junior forward Sime, the
team's No. 2 scorer last year,
midfielders Antonucci, Bloomer
and Kerri Stivaletti and defenders
Christine Martin and Blair El
liott.
"Last year we were often an
underdog," Elise Edwards said.
"We were often not that aggres
sive. We were more defensive.
This year we have the talent and
the skill where we can put more
pressure on the other team.
"We definitely have the poten
tial to be a competitor in the na
tional tournament," Edwards con
tinued. "We just have to live up
to that potential. That's the hard
est part because things have gone
along so quickly this year."
If the Cardinal continues to im
prove, however, the sky appears
to be the limit.
"Everyone on this team is really
skilled and really good," Potok
said after her three-goal perform
ance. I was surprised I was start
ing. And happy, too."
If she and her teammates keep
playing up to their potential, they
might be pretty happy pretty often
this year.
Card notes
Mclntyre, the team's top defender in
1988, missed the first three games
this year due to a sprained ankle suf
fered the first day of practice. Sime
missed the opener with a sore back
but returned to the lineup against
Sonoma State, nearly scoring a goal
within a minute of coming on the
field.
Stanford traveled Friday to Division
ll's top-ranked team, Cal State-
Hayward, and hosted Texas Christian
Sunday. The team plays at Northern
Colorado tomorrow and at Colorado
College Saturday. Colorado College is
the alma mater of new Cardinal as
sistant Jeanine Szpara, a four-time
All-American goalkeeper.

Junior Jennifer Rowland, background, has scored three goals and has one assist in only three games.
The Cardinal women are currently 3-0 and have scored 15 goals while allowing none.
Stanford's favorite rags-to
riches story of last year just
traded in its BMW for a Rolls-
Royce.
That's right. The women's soc
cer team which went 13-4-2 last
season to earn their first-ever na
tional ranking (they finished at
#17) is going to be even better.
In fact, according to Coach Ber
hane Andeberhan, there is no
need to speculate about the 1989
edition being an improvement
over last year's team.
"It already is," he said. "The
returning people have worked so
hard to improve themselves. We
had an excellent recruiting
year. . . . The recruits are giving
everything we needed and more."
The team's opener, against
Western Washington University
Sept. 6, proved just that. Despite
the fact that Stanford was com
pletely outplaying the Vikings, the
score was still 0-0 after 29
minutes. But freshman forward
Jennifer Potok notched her first
collegiate goal off a pass from
junior Jennifer Bloomer. Nine
minutes later Potok scored again,
giving the Cardinal a 2-0 lead at
the intermission.
Potok completed her hat trick
less than 10 minutes into the sec
ond half, then classmate Julie
Foudy, the top recruit in the na
tion, put her name in the scoring
column 13 minutes later. Junior
Jennifer Rowland, the team's
leading scorer last year, completed
the 5-0 romp with a goal with 10
minutes remaining.
"I think we're playing really
well," goalkeeper Elise Edwards
said. "We had a good base to start
with. All the players worked really
hard in the off-season. We have
a couple of superstar freshmen.
The team has come together
really well."
The combination of youth and
experience is just what the Car
dinal needs this year in facing the
school's most difficult schedule
ever. Stanford, ranked 15th in the
latest poll, plays at No. 3 Califor
nia, No. 6 Colorado College, No.
8 Virginia and No. 14 St. Mary's
and hosts No. 4 Wisconsin, No. 9
UC-Santa Barbara and North
Carolina. How good are the Tar

Heels? In the eight years the
NCAA has sponsored NCAA
playoffs for women's sports, UNC
has captured seven national titles.
And yes, they are ranked No. 1
this year.
Can Stanford compete against
these teams? "We can," Andeber
han said. "They should all be
favored but we can beat them. . . .
We know they have strong teams
and definitely should be favored,
but we feel we have a strong team
and have a chance to beat them.
"I think we deserve to be
ranked in the top 20," he contin
ued. "Whether we're a top-10
team or not, we'll have to see. . . .
Whether we're a championship
caliber team or not, I don't know."
Potok shares her coach's op
timism. "I think we're doing so
well," she said. "We've worked
really hard. . . . We have the po
tential to be in the final four."
Stanford has also defeated both
Sonoma State and San Francisco
State to run its record to 3-0 on
the season. The Cardinal met
Sonoma State Sept. 9 and came
away with a 2-0 win. Jennifer
Rowland opened the scoring by
taking a pass from Foudy 15
