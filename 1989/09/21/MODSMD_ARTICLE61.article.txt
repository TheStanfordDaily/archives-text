# It's all fun and games until someone loses at IMs

"We are the University's fun" is the
theme for Stanford's active intramural
athletics staff.
The intramural athletics department
invites participation by everyone from
armchair quarterbacks to couch potatoes
to high school all-stars. Even if you ha
ven't won any Olympic gold medals, your
athletic career does not have to end on
the Farm.
The purpose of the Intramural Sports
Program is to provide every student and

staff member at Stanford the opportunity
to compete and participate in an athletic
or recreational activity that he or she
will enjoy, according to Howard Dallmar,
director of intramurals.
Undergraduate students and staff and
faculty and full-time staff can participate
in a myriad of intramural events year
round. There are leagues, elimination
tournaments and direct competition in
football, pocket billiards, volleyball, swim
ming, power lifting, squash, Frisbee, bas
ketball, canoe racing and virtually every
other competitive recreational sport.
The intramural, or IM department, un

der the direction of Dallmar, is staffed
by students who coordinate the sign-ups,
organize leagues and supervise play. Stu
dents are also paid to officiate team play
in sports such as football, soccer, basket
ball and softball. Those interested in of
ficiating or joining the IM staff are en
couraged to visit the intramural sports
office in the athletic department.
Intramural teams are usually organ
ized around living groups such as frater
nities or dorms, although independent
groups are allowed. Team points are
awarded for competition victories, and at
the end of the year an intramural cham

pion is named.
Competitions are divided into all-
University, all-women and coed. In league
competitions, teams are placed in "A",
"B" or "C" divisions. "A" leagues ane the
most skilled and competitive while "B"
teams are of average ability.
Coed play often proves to be the most
enjoyable intramural pursuit. In the fall
quarter, coed leagues are formed in foot
ball (four men and three women), four
player volleyball, and inner tube water
polo (four men and three women).
All-University competitions for men in
the fall are three-on-three basketball,

basketball free throws, pocket billiards,
cross country, football, golf, handball dou
bles, table tennis doubles, four player
volleyball and wrestling.
For women, three-on-three basketball,
basketball free throws, cross country,
football, golf, table tennis doubles, tennis
doubles, and four player volleyball are
offered in the fall.
Sign-ups for each quarter are held in
the intramural offices during the first
week of classes. The "Intramural Hand
book", which can be picked up in the
intramural office, details IM rules and
schedules.
