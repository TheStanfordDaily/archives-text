## Young team off to a 1-1 start in their quest to make playoffs

Bo knows football.
Bo knows baseball.
Bo knows basketball.
Bo knows cycling.
Bo knows weights.
But does Bo know field hockey?
Probably not, but Sheryl
Johnson does. The Cardinal's field
hockey coach — a three-time
member of the U.S. Olympic field
hockey team — enters her fifth
season atop the Stanford pro
gram.
In her tenure here, the Cardinal
has won three NorPac Conference
Championships while compiling a
40-20-5 overall record (20-5-5 in
NorPac play). The squad has ap
peared in the NCAA playoffs three
times under Johnson's leadership.
The year Stanford failed to win
the conference crown — and
wasn't invited to the NCAA party
— was 1988. Last season.
One might figure that with the

loss of seven seniors the Cardinal
would find itself without a post
season berth once again. Espe
cially when those seniors included
All-Americans Karen Jones and
Alison Smith. Oh, by the way,
Smith was the NorPac Player of
the Year.
In addition, gone from the 1989
roster are All-NorPac performers
Kat Thomas, Dana Fleming and
Wanda Kay Key.
So coming off a year in which
the team finished 8-5-2 (2-2-2 in
NorPac), Johnson is bemoaning
the loss of her graduates and
giving up, right?
Wrong, not Sheryl Johnson.
"We were disappointed last
season by not making the NCAA
playoffs," Jolyison says. "We will
be young this year, but I feel we
have the talent to make the
NCAAs."
Johnson's optimism is fueled by
the return of senior co-captains
Michelanne Baker and Beth
Lewinger. They'll provide veteran

leadership to a team that counts
three freshman and nine sopho
mores among its members.
Baker and Lewinger will pro
vide the defense and hopefully al
low new goalie Caroline Clevinger
to have an easy time filling the
shoes Jones left behind.
Offensively, the Cardinal is
counting on returnees Katherine
Pryde, Clare Stephens and Mic
hele Beynet. The trio was among
Stanford's scoring leaders last
season and will have their work
cut out for them.
The team took a 1-1 record into
a meeting with lowa last Friday
with both those games in confer
ence. On the road against Pacific,
Stanford fell by a 2-1 score in the
season opener Sept. 5.
Against cross-Bay rival Califor
nia, Stanford came back strong
with a 1-0 shutout four days later.
This year's schedule has only
two home dates in September.
