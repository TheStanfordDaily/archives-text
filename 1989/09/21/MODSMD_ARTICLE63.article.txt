# Soccer faces heady schedule
## 
### Mark Rogowsky Senior staff writer 
Every year, a college basketball
team loads it schedule with teams
like Podunk St., wins 20 games
and then complains loudly when
it doesn't get invited to the NCAA
Tournament.
Stanford men's soccer Coach
Sam Koch knows this lesson quite
well. To make sure Stanford isn't
a victim of the patsy-opponents
equals-no-postseason syndrome,
Koch has loaded the Cardinal
agenda with what he calls
"definitely our toughest schedule
ever."
"And, it will be a great chal
lenge," he adds.
Already, the Cardinal has taken
on defending national champion
Indiana and preseason No. 7
Seton Hall at the Met Life Classic.
Both games resulted in Stanford
defeats but both provided some
positive signs as well.
Facing the Hoosiers on Sept. 9,
the Cardinal allowed but one goal
to fall 1-0. The Stanford squad
came back from that disappoint
ment to put quite a scare into the
Pirates.
Stanford moved out to a 2-0
lead in the first half. Unfortu
nately, Seton Hall showed why it's
in the top 10, coming back to score
three times in the second stanza
and walk away with the 3-2 win.
Lest you think it's all been bleak
thus far for Stanford, the home
team has chalked up a couple in
the "W" column. Stanford came
away with a victory over UC-
Davis in the regular season opener

3-0. The Cardinal also knocked
off South Bay rival San Jose State
7-0 in a Sept. 6 showdown. Stan
ford played No. 8 Fresno State to
a 2-2 tie Sept. 13 with goals by
Evan Nadler and Mark Semioli.
(Stanford embarked on a road
trip last week and has already
played Cal Poly-SLO and UNLV.
Results of those matches were un
available at the time of publica
tion.)
In the meantime, things are
looking up. The team has survived
the loss of six players to gradua
tion and has integrated four fresh
man into the starting lineup. De
spite having only four seniors,
Stanford has borne a strong
resemblance to a veteran club.
As Koch says, "If we're holding
our own now (against top teams)
.. . Who knows how good the Car
dinal can become the second half
of the season?
Koch is happy with the team's
attitude and says the seniors are
providing excellent leadership.
Stanford's leader by example is
Semioli, the team's sweeper. Koch,
who makes a point of not talking
up a single player too much, can't
contain himself when it comes to
Semioli.
"He's one of the best in the
nation. No doubt about it," Koch
says."The guy is unbelievable."
Koch says it's for his seniors —
Semioli, goalie Chris Helling,
midfielder Jeff Rona and forward
Chris Porch — that he put to
gether such a tough schedule. He
wanted to give them a shot to
excel and get a chance to make
the NCAA playoffs.

The new cast brought in to aid
the upperclassmen is impressive
as well. Koch mentions the play
of forwards Lance Killian and
Jason Vanacour, midfielder Jim
Tallutto and fullback Randy
Mann as significant so far.
He also notes that Kyle Krpata
did a stellar job in goal filling in
for the injured Helling.
Looking ahead, Koch expects
the freshmen will only get better,
the seniors will continue to lead
and the sophomores and juniors
will continue to do an "excellent
job."
He cites three aspects where
the team must improve in order
to reach its potential. First, de
fensive play by the midfield. "We
are having a hard time closing
down our marks early," Koch
notes.
"We're giving the other teams
too much room to work," he adds.
Second, the midfield needs to
provide better support on the at
tack. Finally, and perhaps more
importantly, is team chemistry.
"For us to be successful, the
meshing of the new players with
the old is going to be [crucial],"
Koch says.
It could be a big year for Car
dinal soccer, despite facing teams
that offer far more scholarships
than Stanford's two. Koch says
he has a lot of respect for the
players in the program. Hopefully,
for Stanford soccer 1989, so will
the Cardinal's opposition as the
team kicks its way toward the
playoffs.
