# Tigers tame Card spikers

STOCKTON, Calif. - Making
the transition from high school to
college athletics is always diffi
cult, even in the ideal situation.
And for those of you unfamiliar
with an "ideal situation," here is
a listing of what they are not:
• Playing your first collegiate vol
leyball match as the starting set
ter for the No. 2-ranked team in
the nation.
• Facing the seventh-ranked team
in the nation, Pacific.
• Playing on the road in front of
2,122 screaming fans.
Carrie Feldman, a freshman on
the Cardinal women's volleyball
team, made the best of this worst
case scenario, but Stanford's over
all lethargic play was not enough
to top the Tigers as Stanford fell
15-6, 15-8, 13-15, 16-14.
"We were just bad tonight,"
Stanford Coach Don Shaw said
following the Pacific match.
"There's no two ways about it....
I think we killed ourselves. UOP
played just well enough to let us
beat ourselves and we did a good
job of that."
"I though Carrie did a pretty
good job," (")Shaw said. "If you
take a senior and replace her with
a freshman things don't end up
as good."
Feldman was given the starting
spot when senior Lara Asper was
unable to play due to a back in
jury. She will likely return to ac
tion this weekend when the team
travels to Washington State and
Washington.
The loss Sept. 12 dropped Stan
ford to 1-1 on the year.
Stanford opened the season on
a positive note, burying San Fran
cisco 15-10, 15-3, 15-5 Sept. 5. In
that match highly-touted fresh
man Bev Oden led the Cardinal
with nine kills, five service aces,

a .533 hitting percentage and nine
digs.
Oden also played well against
the Tigers, but her older sister
Elaina, a UOP senior, and her
teammates overwhelmed the Car
dinal.
Elaina Oden had 13 kills, 14
digs and hit .462 against the Car
dinal. Cathey Scotlan added 19
kills, 17 digs and eight blocks,
Pam Lance had 13 kills and 23
digs and Krissy Fifer pitched in
with 11 kills.
For Stanford, Bev Oden had a
team-high 18 kills, three aces, 12
digs, four blocks and a .395 hitting
percentage. Kristin Klein had 15
kills and 18 digs and Laura Olesen
had 14 kills and 17 digs.
"We had a really slow start,"
Klein said. "We made a few stupid
mistakes.... I don't think we
played as aggressively as we could
have. We were playing tentative
at times."
Stanford was not in either of
the first two games against
Pacific but rebounded in game
three. A pair of Bev Oden blocks
gave Stanford a 12-9 lead but the
Tigers came back for a 13-12 lead.
Oden served up an ace to knot
the score and after a few sideouts,
freshman Kristi Paaso recorded a
kill to give Stanford a 14-13 lead.
After a few more sideouts, Bev
Oden finished the game, hitting
through her sister's block.
Stanford jumped out to a 13-6
lead in game four, but the Tigers
came back.
The score was 13-12 when Fifer
touched the net to give Stanford
game point. After a Cardinal
missed serve, however, Lance
came up with two kills to make
it 14-14. Bev Oden got a sideout
for Stanford but a net call gave
UOP back the serve. Klein then
earned a sideout with a kill, but
another missed serve gave the ball
back to Pacific.

A Cardinal hitting error set up
match point, and after an ex
change of sideouts, a UOP dink
fell in for the match.
The highlight of the match for
the Cardinal had to be the play
of the freshmen. In addition to
Oden, Feldman had 51 assists and
12 digs while running the offense
well. Paaso finished with seven
kills, two aces and 11 digs and
Laurie Sawin came off the bench
for an ace and eight digs.
"The third and fourth games
we started playing the way I think
we should be able to play,"
Feldman said. "I think we'll
definitely learn from this game
and I don't think it'll happen
again — miscommunication, lack
of talking. . . . After this game I
think it'll help us open our eyes;
look at every match."
"We might have wanted to win,"
Klein said, "but we weren't play
ing our positions and concentrat
ing. ... It might be good for us
to get this loss out of the way."
Stanford also played an exhibi
tion match against the touring So
viet Union Junior National Team
Sept. 9. Stanford won a two-and
a-half-hour thriller 15-10, 15-12,
12-15, 4-15, 15-13. Oden recorded
a triple-double for the Cardinal
as the team came back from a
13-11 deficit in the final game.
Card notes
Stanford is playing at No. 18
Colorado State today and will face
Pittsburgh, llth-ranked Kentucky
and sixth-ranked Nebraska at a tour
nament in Nebraska Friday and Sat
urday.
Neither Asper nor sophomore
Nicole Appleman suited up for the
UOP match. Asper had been suffering
from back spasms all week and Ap
pleman was not feeling well. Cheryl
Conly, a junior hitter, is out until the
end of this month with a broken wrist
suffered during preseason training.
