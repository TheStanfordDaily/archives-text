# Stanford offense melts in Arizona heat, 19-3
## 
### Chris Crader Editorial staff 
TUCSON, Ariz. — Tucson just
has not been good to Stanford in
1989.
First, the men's basketball team
was treated rudely by Arizona
here, suffering a 72-52 loss in Jan
uary. The Cardinal nine got theirs
in March, giving up 30 runs in
the first two games of a three
game series.
Two weeks ago it was the
Wildcat football squad putting a
damper on the opening of the
Denny Green Era, silencing the
Cardinal 19-3.
Stanford had difficulty moving
the ball against the Arizona de
fense all night, finishing with a
mere 34 yards rushing and only
187 yards of total offense. The
Wildcat offense had fewer prob
lems, and while the Stanford de
fense stiffened when Arizona got
near the goal line, they put
enough points on the board to
leave Stanford 0-1 in 1989.
"We're obviously disappointed
in the outcome," Stanford Coach
Denny Green said following the
game. "We probably learned a
great deal all across the board.
All in all I think we are just trying
to get ourselves mentally over it
. . . and get ourselves ready to play
again."
Things started well for Stanford
as redshirt freshman Steve
Smith's first collegiate pass was
complete to Walter Patson for 14
yards and a first down on the
second play from scrimmage.
Smith got sacked on the next play,
however, and threw two incomple
tions under pressure to set up
fourth down and a punt.
"Offensively we were average,"
Green said after the game. "I'd
say Steve [Smith] was average, at
best. We were hoping to run the
ball a little better . . . but we
didn't. . .. Our linemen did the
best they could. They're young
and they're going to get a hell of
a lot better."
Things only got worse. On the
Wildcats' first play quarterback
Ronnie Veal threw a screen pass
to David Eldridge, who rambled
for 24 yards. Redshirt freshman
nose tackle Estevan Avila was
called for a late hit on the play
as well, and the additional 15

yards put the ball on Stanford's
36. Stanford stuffed fullback
Mario Hampton for a two-yard
gain but then Reggie McGill
struck.
McGill raced for 14 yards down
the left side on a pitch, then ran
20 more on the next play for a
touchdown.
While the Cardinal offense con
tinued to struggle, Stanford's de
fense stiffened and the two teams
exchanged punts for most of the
remainder of the half. With about
nine minutes to go, however,
Stanford began to mount a drive
from its own two, following a fine
punt by John Nies.
Smith and company were able
to move the ball with short passes
to the running backs and tight
ends and advanced the ball to the
Arizona 13.
But much like the 1988 squad
that finished 3-6-2, Stanford
stalled inside the opponent's 20.
Smith was under a tremendous
amount of pressure and managed
to throw the ball away on first
down, hit a diving Scott Eschel
man for no gain on second down
and threw incomplete into the
endzone on third down when Bat
son slipped. John Hopkins did
narrow the score to 7-3, however,
with a 30-yard field goal, his 13th
straight without a miss.
The Wildcats inserted George
Malauulu, a better passer, for
Veal at quarterback in an effort
to get some points in the last three
minutes, 13 seconds.
Malauulu moved the team well,
but Stanford cornerbacks Alan
Grant and Kevin Scott each broke
up passes in the endzone, forcing
the Wildcats to settle for a 27-yard
Doug Pfaff field goal with three
seconds remaining. Nothing of
event happened on the kickoff and
Arizona took a 10-3 lead into in
termission.
The Wildcats then took the
opening kickoff of the second half
and drove 40 yards to set up
PfafTs second field goal, a 50-
yarder that just crept over the
crossbar. Then, Stanford was
caught sleeping.
On the kickoff, as soon as the
Wildcats broke their huddle, Nies
walked up to the ball like he was
going to check its positioning on
the tee. Instead, he kicked it along
the ground and Chris Wright re

covered the onside kick 11 yards
downfield.
Arizona's offense took over
again, marching 43 yards for field
goal No. 3, a 28-yarder. By the
time Stanford got the ball back
with 3:18 left in the third half,
the Cardinal offense had gone
14:55 of game time, and an hour
of real time, without running a
play.
"That kind of changed the mo
mentum," Volpe said. "They had
the momentum, but that put a

stop to our trying to change it."
After Stanford went three and
out, Arizona mounted another
drive. Helped by a questionable
late-hit call on strong safety Rob
Englehardt, the Wildcats went 41
yards to set up a 44-yard field
goal. Pfaffs four tries in one game
tied a school record.
The Cardinal offense again ran
three-and-punt, but Matt
Borkowski recovered a Veal
fumble on Arizona's first play.
Thanks to a 27-yard run by Volpe,

Stanford reached the Wildcat
nine. On second and seven, how
ever, Smith tossed a flare to Es
chelman under heavy pressure.
Eschelman juggled the ball,
tucked it away and got hit by
linebacker Chris Singleton in
rapid succession. The ball flew 20
yards backward and was recov
ered by free safety Jeff Ham
merschmidt.
Stanford mounted one last
drive, including a nice 21-yard
heave to a leaping Ed McCaffrey

for his first catch since 1987. The
lanky receiver sat out all last
season with a deep bruise on his
thigh.
The drive was kept alive by a
roughing the passer penalty on
fourth down, but two plays later
Smith was intercepted by a diving
Todd Burden. Arizona ran out the
last 4:45 and the game was over.
"They were a good defense; they
were a quick defense," guard Andy
Papathanassiou said. "And we did
some things to hurt ourselves."

runner and a receiver.
