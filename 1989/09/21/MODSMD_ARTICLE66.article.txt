# Cardinal, BJ, come up short in comeback try
## 
### Mark Rogowsky Senior staff writer 
State Coach Dave Kragthorpe,
thought the QB switch was the
right move. "Johnson did a great
job," he said. "It would not have
been a tough ballgame if they had
stayed with the starting quarter
back.
"It was a lot easier to put pres
sure on Smith," Kragthorpe
added, referring to Johnson's su
perior mobility.
Johnson — who started four
games last season and won five
of seven as a starter in 1987 —
actually brought the Cardinal
within 13 yards of tying the game
with 4:46 on the clock. That drive
stalled when Scott Eschelman was
stuffed on a fourth-and-one play.
"I was confident of the call,"
Johnson said of the ill-fated
fourth-down play. "I felt we could
get [the first down]."
Still, Stanford had one more
chance. The Cardinal defense
forced the Beavers into a one-two
three punt situation and Mark
Bennett's boot gave Stanford the
ball one last time.
On the punt, Alan Grant gave
the Cardinal what seemed to be

Brian Johnson?
That's right, Cardinal fans, the
very same Brian Johnson who
played minor league baseball for
the New York Yankees this sum
mer was back at quarterback for
Stanford midway through the
Sept. 9 contest against Oregon
State at Corvallis.
Unfortunately, despite a solid
performance from Johnson — 16
of 28 for 198 yards — Stanford
was unable to overcome an early
14-0 deficit and fell 20-16.
"Brian played really well,"
Coach Denny Green said. "His
poise and performance put him
in position to be the No. 1 quar
terback."
And, what of Steve Smith, the
erstwhile starter? Green pulled
him after a shaky start during
which he threw two interceptions
— one led to a Beaver touchdown.
"I was a little surprised," Smith
said. "But you can't blame him
(Green)."
Green's counterpart, Oregon

excellent field position on the
Oregon State 43-yard line. A clip
ping penalty on Herbie Berry nul
lified the return, however, and
Stanford had to start on its own
31.
An Oregon State offsides, a 4-
yard completion and a quarter
back sneak gave Stanford a first
down at the 42. Two plays later,
Johnson hooked up with Eschel
man for another first down at the
Beaver 47.
An incompletion was followed
by a Johnson pass intended for
Ed McCaffrey. Oregon State's
Billy Hughely hit McCaffrey
before the ball arrived, though,
and was charged with pass inter
ference. That meant Stanford was
in business at the Beaver 33, first
and 10.
On second down, Johnson went
for the all the marbles. He threw
into double coverage in the
endzone. Chris Walsh had a step
on the defense but the ball hung
up in the wind and Oregon State's
Torey Overstreet came away with
the interception — ending the
Cardinal's final threat.

"It was my ball," said Over
street. "It didn't belong to him
anymore."
Beaver quarterback Nick
Schichtle would eventually run
backwards through the end zone,
taking a safety to help run out
the clock, sending Stanford to its
second loss in a row.
"It's frustrating," said McCaf
frey. "I hate starting in a hole.
We're just going to have to work
harder and harder the next two
weeks." For his own part, McCaf
frey played an excellent game,
catching five passes for 75 yards.
He appears to be fully recovered
from the thigh injury that forced
him to miss all of last season.
Stanford's major problem was
once again a slow start. The team

'[Johnson's] poise and performance put
him in position to be the No. 1 quarter
back.'

failed to pick up a first down on
its first three possessions. Smith's
second pass attempt of the game
was picked off by Charlie Lough
at the Cardinal 35.
That play led to an Oregon
State scoring drive of five plays.
The capper was a 1-yard run by
fullback Pat Chaffey.
In the second quarter, Smith
was again bitten by the intercep
tion bug and, this time the play
led directly to a score. Todd
McKinney snared the ball at Stan
ford's 36 and raced to the end
zone without being touched. The
Cardinal trailed by two touch
downs.
"I was trying to throw the ball
away," Smith said. "Right as I
threw it (Esera) Tuaolo grabbed
me and I didn't get enough on it."

Midway through the second
quarter, the Cardinal got its first
big break of the season. Tuan Van
Le blocked Bennett's punt, Kevin
Puk picked up the ball and scam
pered 24 yards for a touchdown.
"We needed a big play and that
was it," Le said. It was Le who
blocked California kicker Robbie
Keen's field goal to preserve the
tie in Big Game last year.
Le also set up Stanford's other
touchdown — the first scored by
the offense in 1989. He inter
cepted Schichtle at the Beaver 23
with 10:23 left in the third. It
took Jon Volpe all of one play to
race for the score.
"We played tough but let them
off the hook," linebacker Bruce
Lang said. "It's just a matter of
doing it every down."
"We're hungry," Green said.
"You can't worry about what took
place. We have to get hungrier."
Card notes
Running back Charlie Young sat
out his second straight game due to
a knee injury. Volpe had 76 yards
rushing on 20 carries.

back sneak gave Stanford a first
down at the 42. Two plays later,
Johnson hooked up with Eschel
man for another first down at the
Beaver 47.
An incompletion was followed
by a Johnson pass intended for
Ed McCaffrey. Oregon State's
Billy Hughely hit McCaffrey
before the ball arrived, though,
and was charged with pass inter
ference. That meant Stanford was
in business at the Beaver 33, first
and 10.
On second down, Johnson went
for the all the marbles. He threw
into double coverage in the
endzone. Chris Walsh had a step
on the defense but the ball hung
up in the wind and Oregon State's
Torey Overstreet came away with
the interception — ending the
Cardinal's final threat.

"It was my ball," said Over
street. "It didn't belong to him
anymore."
Beaver quarterback Nick
Schichtle would eventually run
backwards through the end zone,
taking a safety to help run out
the clock, sending Stanford to its
second loss in a row.
"It's frustrating," said McCaf
frey. "I hate starting in a hole.
We're just going to have to work
harder and harder the next two
weeks." For his own part, McCaf
frey played an excellent game,
catching five passes for 75 yards.
He appears to be fully recovered
from the thigh injury that forced
him to miss all of last season.
Stanford's major problem was
once again a slow start. The team

back.'

failed to pick up a first down on
its first three possessions. Smith's
second pass attempt of the game
was picked off by Charlie Lough
at the Cardinal 35.
That play led to an Oregon
State scoring drive of five plays.
The capper was a 1-yard run by
fullback Pat Chaffey.
In the second quarter, Smith
was again bitten by the intercep
tion bug and, this time the play
led directly to a score. Todd
McKinney snared the ball at Stan
ford's 36 and raced to the end
zone without being touched. The
Cardinal trailed by two touch
downs.
"I was trying to throw the ball
away," Smith said. "Right as I
threw it (Esera) Tuaolo grabbed
me and I didn't get enough on it."

Midway through the second
quarter, the Cardinal got its first
big break of the season. Tuan Van
Le blocked Bennett's punt, Kevin
Puk picked up the ball and scam
pered 24 yards for a touchdown.
"We needed a big play and that
was it," Le said. It was Le who
blocked California kicker Robbie
Keen's field goal to preserve the
tie in Big Game last year.
Le also set up Stanford's other
touchdown — the first scored by
the offense in 1989. He inter
cepted Schichtle at the Beaver 23
with 10:23 left in the third. It
took Jon Volpe all of one play to
race for the score.
"We played tough but let them
off the hook," linebacker Bruce
Lang said. "It's just a matter of
doing it every down."
"We're hungry," Green said.
"You can't worry about what took
place. We have to get hungrier."
Card notes
Running back Charlie Young sat
out his second straight game due to
a knee injury. Volpe had 76 yards
rushing on 20 carries.
State Coach Dave Kragthorpe,
thought the QB switch was the
right move. "Johnson did a great
job," he said. "It would not have
been a tough ballgame if they had
stayed with the starting quarter
back.
"It was a lot easier to put pres
sure on Smith," Kragthorpe
added, referring to Johnson's su
perior mobility.
Johnson — who started four
games last season and won five
of seven as a starter in 1987 —
actually brought the Cardinal
within 13 yards of tying the game
with 4:46 on the clock. That drive
stalled when Scott Eschelman was
stuffed on a fourth-and-one play.
"I was confident of the call,"
Johnson said of the ill-fated
fourth-down play. "I felt we could
get [the first down]."
Still, Stanford had one more
chance. The Cardinal defense
forced the Beavers into a one-two
three punt situation and Mark
Bennett's boot gave Stanford the
ball one last time.
On the punt, Alan Grant gave
the Cardinal what seemed to be

Brian Johnson?
That's right, Cardinal fans, the
very same Brian Johnson who
played minor league baseball for
the New York Yankees this sum
mer was back at quarterback for
Stanford midway through the
Sept. 9 contest against Oregon
State at Corvallis.
Unfortunately, despite a solid
performance from Johnson — 16
of 28 for 198 yards — Stanford
was unable to overcome an early
14-0 deficit and fell 20-16.
"Brian played really well,"
Coach Denny Green said. "His
poise and performance put him
in position to be the No. 1 quar
terback."
And, what of Steve Smith, the
erstwhile starter? Green pulled
him after a shaky start during
which he threw two interceptions
— one led to a Beaver touchdown.
"I was a little surprised," Smith
said. "But you can't blame him
(Green)."
