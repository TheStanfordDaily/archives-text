# Janet Evans hopes fame is fleeting on the Farm

Is that her?
Who?
You know. Her?
Oh, yeah. I think you're right.
I think it is her.
Wow! My parents are going to
be so shocked, when I tell them
she's in my ten o'clock class.
The scene: Anywhere on
campus when classes start next
Wednesday.
The subject: Janet Evans, triple
gold medalist in the 1988 Olym
pics.
As far as Evans is concerned,
she'd rather just be Janet Evans,
typical Stanford freshman. But
after winning the 400-meter in
dividual medley and the 400-
meter and 800-meter freestyles in
Seoul, South Korea, setting a
world record and becoming
America's favorite daughter in the
process, it will be difficult for
Evans to remain anonymous.
After deciding to come to the

Farm, however, anonymity is
what Evans is looking for — just
a chance to live the lifestyle of a
normal college freshman.
"I do (think a normal life is
possible) and I hope so," she said.
"I think I can do so at Stanford."
Evans said she still conducts
about two interviews a week, but
that is much more manageable
than last October when she re
turned from the Summer Games.
"When I first got back from the
Olympics it wasn't what I ex
pected," Evans said. "I guess I
didn't realize the impact the
Olympics had. ... I think I'm
used to it now. I think I handle
it well.
"I don't let it bother me. It
comes with the territory if you're
going to swim fast.
She should be getting used to
the publicity because Evans has
been swimming fast for quite
some time now. She burst upon
the national scene as a 15-year-old
in the summer of 1987 at the
U.S. Long Course Championships
in Clovis, Calif. She won four

events at that meet and set her
first two world records, clocking
a 8:22.44 in the 800-meter free
style and a 16:00.73 in the 1500-
meter freestyle.
She currently holds the world
record in the 400-meter freestyle
(4:03.85, set in Seoul), the 800-
meter freestyle (8:16.22, set at the
Pan-Pacific Championships last
month) and the 1500-meter free
style (15:52.10, set at the 1988
Indoor Nationals).
But it is not the records, the
fame or the money-making poten
tial that makes her keep swim
ming, 11 times a week. "It's not
for winning," she said. "It's
having fun and meeting all the
people I meet and doing the things
I do."
Since returning from the Olym
pic Games, Evans has served as
the Grand Marshal of the Fiesta
Bowl Parade, rode in the Macy's
Thanksgiving Parade, was invited
to a reception with Ronald Reagan
at the White House and attended
George Bush's inauguration. She
also turned down several lucrative

endorsement deals to retain her
amateur status and her college
eligibility.
But despite all these opportu
nities, she has continued to train.
Evans won three events at the
Pan-Pacific Championships in
Tokyo last month and then ran
her winning streak to 26 races at
a U.S.-U.S.S.R. dual meet the fol
lowing week in Atlanta. After that
meet she took a couple weeks off
to prepare herself for heading to
school.
With such a busy schedule it is
hard to believe how she can keep
her intensity up but she finds mo
tivation. "Sometimes it gets kind
of boring," she said. "And some
times when you have to be at
morning workout at 5:00 and you
get up at 4:30, you wonder why
you do it.... But you just can't
have goals and sleep in all the
time. I don't think you get any
better unless you work hard."
Having internal motivation has
also helped her take the pressure
off herself. Everytime she goes to
the pool, fans expect a world

record, but Evans realizes she
can't set new records every week
or so.
"I don't really think about them
(expectations). If I swim the way
I want to swim then I'm happy."
Evans has also avoided placing
expectations on herself in college
— her goals are "to swim fast
and help the team win" — but
would certainly appear to be the
favorite in every freestyle and in
dividual medley race she swims.
The Cardinal, under first-year
Coach Richard Quick, who was
also the 1988 U.S. Olympic coach,
won the NCAA title last year by
edging Texas and Florida, and
with Evans, Olympian Janel Jor
gensen and national champions
Lori Heisick and Anne Mahoney
enrolling for 1990, the Cardinal
is one of the favorites to bring
home another championship.
Evans was the most sought
after recruit in some time, and
when she delayed her decision
well into May, she had the col
legiate world holding its collective
breath.

"It came down to Texas, Stan
ford and Florida,'' she said. "I
liked Richard a lot. ... I liked the
atmosphere. I liked the girls on
the team. They all seem like they
want to swim fast.
"I think one of the reasons I
picked Stanford was to get a good
education. And to swim faster un
der Richard."
Evans is not sure how long she
will continue trying to swim
faster, but thinks she will attempt
to defend her gold medals in Bar
celona in 1992.
She will "probably" swim four
years at Stanford, "which would
take me through the 1992 Olym
pics. I will decide after that," she
said.
As for after that, Evans is plan
ning a major in communication
and would like to go into broad
cast journalism or public rela
tions.
But for the moment, she is just
another wide-eyed Stanford fresh
man, trying to find the History
Corner so she can get to her 10
o'clock class on time.
