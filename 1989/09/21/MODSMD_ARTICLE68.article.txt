# A 						banner year for Stanford sports is dead ahead
## 
### 
Since this is Orientation week
here on the Farm, this
would be a good time to give
all the incoming students their
first few lessons on Stanford
sports. So here goes. The most
important rule is that our athletic
program is good. Very good. As
in the best in the nation.
This will likely come as a
surprise to many. But the truth
is, no school won more NCAA
titles than Stanford did last year.
Or the year before. Or the year
before that. Or the year before
that.
Everyone thinks that Plato and
playbooks don't mix; that fast
learners can't run the fast break.
But the Cardinal has come up
with 14 NCAA titles in the last
four years.
But that's nothing. Chopped
liver. Totally minor.
You see, this is the 1989-90
school year. If things go well, and
the gods are on our side, the Car
dinal could win six, or more, this
year. Starting with fall sports,

here are the sports in which Stan
ford is especially strong.
When you talk about col
legiate water polo in the
'80s, you talk about Stan
ford and California. One might
expect Southern California teams
to be the dudes to beat, but six
straight NCAA first-place
trophies have found their way to
one side or the other of the Bay.
Guess what? Stanford and Cal
are ranked No. 1 and No. 2,
respectively, in the nation this
year. If the Cardinal's top ranking
is not a sign of how strong the
team is, the team's 10-8 win over
the Golden Bears two weeks ago
is.
For those of you not familiar
with water polo, any game that
does not go into overtime is a
lopsided win. A two-goal margin
is a blowout. And with three-time
All-American Todd Kemp in the
goal heating up for the season,
no team may score eight against
Stanford again this year.

Another team that knows the
Final Four is the Cardinal lady
spikers. The women's volleyball
squad has reached six Final Fours
in the past seven years, but has
yet to come away with the golden
trophy. With almost everybody
back from last year's second
ranked squad, and the top high
school recruit in the nation al
ready in the starting lineup, Stan
ford looks likely to be making a
business trip to Honolulu for an
other Final Four this December.
Stanford could even make it a
trio before winter break, but don't
tell anyone. Although women's
soccer Coach Berhane Andeber

han has no scholarships to offer,
he stole the nation's No. 1 recruit,
Julie Foudy, away from North
Carolina, winners of the NCAA
crown almost every year.
Foudy has played against the
best the world has to offer while
representing the U.S. National
Team, so she can surely handle
the Tar Heels. And after scoring
15 goals in three games while
giving up none, her teammates
are learning they can play with
anyone as well. Stanford was way,
way below .500 a short two years
ago, but by playing almost every
top team in the country, the Car
dinal will be ready when the 12-
team NCAA playoffs start.
The Cardinal may not be
favored in any postseason game,
but hey, neither was the Villanova
basketball team a few years back.
Even if no NCAA titles find
their way back to the Farm
this quarter, Stanford will
still be in the running for NCAA
Champion of Champions. Leading

the way is the women's basketball
squad, picked No. 1 in one mag
azine's preseason poll already. Led
by senior All-American Jennifer
Azzi, All-Pac-10 players Sonja
Henning and Katy Steding, and
the best player left off the All-
Pac-10 team, Trisha Stevens, the
Cardinal will continue to get bet
ter under Coach Tara VanDer
veer.
A freshman named Janet Evans
\.ill give the women's swim team
a good shot at defending the
NCAA title they won last year,
and the men will be right there
with Texas all year. A word of
recommendation, if I may digress:
the Longhorn men swimmers will
be at deGuerre Pool Nov. 11. The
teams finished one-two at last
year's NCAA Championships and
I'ttle has changed for this year,
Even though the men and
women swimmers have
been at the top of the sport
for some time, they are not as
impressive as the men's and worn

en's tennis teams. The men have
won two straight NCAA titles, and
although the top two players from
last year turned pro, three hot
shot freshmen have just arrived.
Logic would dictate that the men
have no chance to repeat, but a
lot of very logical thinkers said
the same thing 12 months ago.
On the women's side, the ques
tion is getting to be: Will they
ever lose again? The Cardinal has
won four straight NCAA crowns
and went undefeated last year.
The team's top player turned pro,
but freshman Meredith McGrath
could well step into the No. 1
spot. The most scary thought is
that although junior Sandra Birch
won the NCAA singles champion
ship last year, she has to fight
off three other players who are
good enough to play at No. 1.
So get out your Cardinal ban
ners; it's going to be that type of
year.

Henning and Katy Steding, and
the best player left off the All-
Pac-10 team, Trisha Stevens, the
Cardinal will continue to get bet
ter under Coach Tara VanDer
veer.
A freshman named Janet Evans
\.ill give the women's swim team
a good shot at defending the
NCAA title they won last year,
and the men will be right there
with Texas all year. A word of
recommendation, if I may digress:
the Longhorn men swimmers will
be at deGuerre Pool Nov. 11. The
teams finished one-two at last
year's NCAA Championships and
I'ttle has changed for this year,
Even though the men and
women swimmers have
been at the top of the sport
for some time, they are not as
impressive as the men's and worn

en's tennis teams. The men have
won two straight NCAA titles, and
although the top two players from
last year turned pro, three hot
shot freshmen have just arrived.
Logic would dictate that the men
have no chance to repeat, but a
lot of very logical thinkers said
the same thing 12 months ago.
On the women's side, the ques
tion is getting to be: Will they
ever lose again? The Cardinal has
won four straight NCAA crowns
and went undefeated last year.
The team's top player turned pro,
but freshman Meredith McGrath
could well step into the No. 1
spot. The most scary thought is
that although junior Sandra Birch
won the NCAA singles champion
ship last year, she has to fight
off three other players who are
good enough to play at No. 1.
So get out your Cardinal ban
ners; it's going to be that type of
year.

Since this is Orientation week
here on the Farm, this
would be a good time to give
all the incoming students their
first few lessons on Stanford
sports. So here goes. The most
important rule is that our athletic
program is good. Very good. As
in the best in the nation.
This will likely come as a
surprise to many. But the truth
is, no school won more NCAA
titles than Stanford did last year.
Or the year before. Or the year
before that. Or the year before
that.
Everyone thinks that Plato and
playbooks don't mix; that fast
learners can't run the fast break.
But the Cardinal has come up
with 14 NCAA titles in the last
four years.
But that's nothing. Chopped
liver. Totally minor.
You see, this is the 1989-90
school year. If things go well, and
the gods are on our side, the Car
dinal could win six, or more, this
year. Starting with fall sports,

here are the sports in which Stan
ford is especially strong.
When you talk about col
legiate water polo in the
'80s, you talk about Stan
ford and California. One might
expect Southern California teams
to be the dudes to beat, but six
straight NCAA first-place
trophies have found their way to
one side or the other of the Bay.
Guess what? Stanford and Cal
are ranked No. 1 and No. 2,
respectively, in the nation this
year. If the Cardinal's top ranking
is not a sign of how strong the
team is, the team's 10-8 win over
the Golden Bears two weeks ago
is.
For those of you not familiar
with water polo, any game that
does not go into overtime is a
lopsided win. A two-goal margin
is a blowout. And with three-time
All-American Todd Kemp in the
goal heating up for the season,
no team may score eight against
Stanford again this year.

Another team that knows the
Final Four is the Cardinal lady
spikers. The women's volleyball
squad has reached six Final Fours
in the past seven years, but has
yet to come away with the golden
trophy. With almost everybody
back from last year's second
ranked squad, and the top high
school recruit in the nation al
ready in the starting lineup, Stan
ford looks likely to be making a
business trip to Honolulu for an
other Final Four this December.
Stanford could even make it a
trio before winter break, but don't
tell anyone. Although women's
soccer Coach Berhane Andeber

han has no scholarships to offer,
he stole the nation's No. 1 recruit,
Julie Foudy, away from North
Carolina, winners of the NCAA
crown almost every year.
Foudy has played against the
best the world has to offer while
representing the U.S. National
Team, so she can surely handle
the Tar Heels. And after scoring
15 goals in three games while
giving up none, her teammates
are learning they can play with
anyone as well. Stanford was way,
way below .500 a short two years
ago, but by playing almost every
top team in the country, the Car
dinal will be ready when the 12-
team NCAA playoffs start.
The Cardinal may not be
favored in any postseason game,
but hey, neither was the Villanova
basketball team a few years back.
Even if no NCAA titles find
their way back to the Farm
this quarter, Stanford will
still be in the running for NCAA
Champion of Champions. Leading

the way is the women's basketball
squad, picked No. 1 in one mag
azine's preseason poll already. Led
by senior All-American Jennifer
Azzi, All-Pac-10 players Sonja
Henning and Katy Steding, and
the best player left off the All-
Pac-10 team, Trisha Stevens, the
Cardinal will continue to get bet
ter under Coach Tara VanDer
