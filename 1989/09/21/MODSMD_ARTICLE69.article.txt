# Crew teams looking optimistically toward season

### Tyson Vaughan 
Assistant women's crew coach
Wendy Davis can attest to the
relatively recent rise of the Car
dinal rowers. In 1979 and 1980
she coached UCLA against Stan
ford. "We killed them," she said
of Stanford.
But in 1981 John Davis, later
to become her husband, took the
helm of Cardinal crew. That year,
"They absolutely crushed us. I
mean, they just killed us. After
that, I had to get to that pro

gram."
Under the coaching team of
Davis and Davis, the Cardinal
women have steadily improved,
evolving into a national power.
Last year they posted an impres
sive third place national finish,
and they are looking to improve
next spring.
"We should contend for number
one on the West Coast and be in
the top three in the nation," said
Mrs. Davis.
Such goals are quite lofty, es
pecially considering the "resource

gap." Other western crew teams
entice top recruits with lucrative
scholarships — Wisconsin, Cali
fornia and Washington, some of
the best in the west, participate
in this practice. Stanford provides
no such scholarships.
The Eastern powers —
Radcliffe and Princeton — snap
up the talented recruits concen
trated in elite New England
private schools with a literally
centuries-long tradition of high
powered academics and rowing.
Stanford has no such tradition.

Consistently high levels of fund
ing allows other schools to keep
up state-of-the-art boats and top
of-the-line facilities. "Harvard
just invites their recruits to their
boathouse. That's all it takes,"
said Wendy Davis. At Stanford,
where the cost of trying to main
tain 29 nationally competitive
sports has punched a $1 million
plus hole in the athletic depart
ment's budget, crew is not high
on the list of priorities.
Yet, despite these adversities,
Stanford crew continues to im

prove. As last year's third place
team consisted wholly of sopho
mores and juniors, the entire team
will be back — led by former U.S.
Junior National Team member
Audrey Barnett, a junior.
Sophomore Bonnie Baker, a
recent member of the U.S. Junior
National Team, will be providing
her share of propulsion after an
excellent year on the novice team.
Three other members — who
have all been to national pre-elite
camps — will contribute a con
siderable amount of talent to the

team: Katherine Van Uum, Laura
Stearns and Elen Austin.
Thanks to a best-ever recruiting
year, the novice team promises to
be particularly strong. Key mem
bers include Carrie MacKay of
Seattle and Rebecca Gettleman of
Berkeley.
For the men, this year will be
a rebuilding one, but as with the
women, the men continue to im
prove. A U.S. Junior National
Team member, among other im
pressive recruits, promises a
bright future.
