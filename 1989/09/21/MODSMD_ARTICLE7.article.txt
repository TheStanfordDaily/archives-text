# An Alaskan in search of the sun

### Jock Friedly Editorial staff 
Stanford, known as the "Dis
neyland of the North," is actually
quite far south to Marie Ethel
Garrison, an incoming freshman.
Garrison is from Nome, Alaska
â€” about as far north as one can
live without being caked in ice for
the entire year.
Unlike Stanford, no palm trees
grace the roadways in Nome. In
fact, there are few roadways in
Nome, and none that connect it
to the rest of the state.
"The only way you can get out
is airplanes," Garrison said.
Three jetloads fly in and out of
Nome each day, hauling tourists,
locals, food and supplies with
them.
Round trip tickets from Nome
to Anchorage, the state capital
about 500 miles away, are $400.
The cost of the ticket may be high
by many standards, but Alaskans
are accustomed to paying exorbi

tant prices for goods and services.
A half gallon of milk, flown
from Anchorage, costs $5.99 in
Nome's four grocery stores. The
high costs of the food are offset
by high wages, though, and
buying goods in other parts of the
country can seem like a real bar
gain to Alaskans.
In high school, Garrison was
active in community service, par
ticularly as a member of the Fu
ture Homemakers of America,
which organized disaster drives,
Grandparents Day and other com
munity activities. The organiza
tion's primary purpose was to
"stress the importance of the fam
ily," essential in such a small com
munity.
Garrison was captain of the
cheerleading team for two years.
The big sport in Nome was bas
ketball, a game requiring far
fewer players than soccer or foot
ball. The size of the team is im
portant, as Stanford's football
team is more than twice as large

as Garrison's graduating class of
40.
The small school size had its
advantages, Garrison said. "You
get a lot of benefits."
Scholarships are more freely
given, allowing many students
who want to attend school to get
funding. The best students, like
herself, are well rewarded for
their hard work.
The size of the school also had
its significant drawbacks. "With
such a small number of students,
you don't really have the oppor
tunity to have honors classes," she
said.
Garrison said she is thinking
of majoring in civil engineering,
but she is not committing to any
thing after that.
When asked how she thought
she we was going to do in adjust
ing to college life, she said, "I'm
just expecting to do well." Then
again, "I don't know what I'm
expecting."
