# Californian passes up East for West
## 
### Jennifer Schmid Editorial staff 
Born in Newport Beach and
raised in Laguna Hills, Robert
John Baedeker — just call me
Rob — is a California boy.
The Orange County native said
he likes to play golf and most
other sports, and yes, he does
know how to surf.
Baedecker said he participated
in a wide variety of activities in
high school, from playing varsity
football to being Senior Class
President and a member of a serv
ice organization.
When it came time to decide
where to attend college, however,
Baedecker said he wasn't sure
what he wanted to do.

He thought about going to East
Coast schools such as Brown and
University of Massachusetts at
Amherst, "just to see what the
East Coast is like." Baedecker said
he didn't even consider applying
to Stanford until his dad talked
him into it ... in Baedecker's
modest opinion, he thought Stan
ford "would use his application
for firewood."
Obviously not. Once accepted,
Baedecker said it was "really hard
to pass up the chance to attend"
this West Coast school.
Baedecker said he is not yet
committed to any one activity at
Stanford, but will probably con
tinue his sports interest somehow.
As far as academic interests go,
Baedecker is interested in follow

ing some type of liberal arts pro
gram — he vehemently denied
being technically oriented — with
possible mayors in such "fuzzy"
fields as political science or com
munication. Wisely, however, he
is waiting to take a few classes
before making any huge decisions.
Baedecker said "the most excit
ing thing he's done" this summer
is make photocopies, which basi
cally means he worked a lot, at
the law firm of Morrison and
Foerster.
Like most other incoming Stan
ford freshmen, this Larkin-bound
frosh said the summer was getting
"kind of slow" now that many
other colleges are in session, and
he is "very impatient" for his
Stanford life to begin.
