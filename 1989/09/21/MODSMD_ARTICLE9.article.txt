# Singer plans to trade corn for spotlight

One of incoming freshman Meg
han Blake's goals in life is to be
a backup singer for Steve Win
wood.
"After med school or whatever,
I'm just going to call him up and
ask to go on the road with him,"
she explains.
Blake has long been active as
a performer. As a senior, she had
the lead in "Anything Goes."
"I was a nightclub singer and
it afforded me the opportunity to
be the ham I guess I really am,"
Blake says.
"I don't know how I got in
volved in the theater because I

was shy and quiet when I was
younger. My parents had me well
trained," Blake says.
With only 400 students in her
Catholic high school, she had the
opportunity to perform quite a
bit. "I guess I took advantage of
the situation," she says.
Her first acting role was as a
"generic orphan" in a community
theater production of "Annie."
She hopes to pursue singing and
acting at Stanford, possibly in an
a capella group on campus. She
will be living in Twain and has
heard about its musical, in which
she hopes to get a part.
This summer, as a presidential
scholar, she was invited to Wash
ington, D.C., to meet President

Bush. The highlight of her trip
was an evening at the Kennedy
Center for Performing Arts.
"The students who were schol
ars in the fine arts performed for
us. They were amazing to watch,"
she says.
Also this summer, after endur
ing four-inch grasshoppers and
other bugs, she claims she became
a true lowan. "I was born in Mil
waukee but after detasseling corn
this summer, I can now leave
lowa after 10 years with a clear
conscience," Blake explains.
She is the only person from her
high school class to go out of state
to college, but she says she is
looking forward to California's
"beautiful flora and fauna and ex

cellent jogging weather."
"I'm going to miss my loud fam
ily and sitting down for dinner
together," she claims. However,
she explains, "When I came out
to visit in the spring, I was most
impressed by the eagerness of
people to want to get to know
you."
"I had even escaped the pro-fro
label and excitement by coming a
week late," she adds.
"My parents' friends keep tell
ing me that this is going to be
the best four years of my life,"
Blake says. "I'm prepared. I
worked hard in high school and
that is part of me, but I'm going
to work at having fun as well."
