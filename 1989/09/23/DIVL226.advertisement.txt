The Problem:
You cheered too loud and too long, your
voice is hoarse and your throat hurts.
The Solution:
Tied House fresh, fully-aged beers are more
effective than other beers at soothing hoarse voices
more effective by two to one! Try one of our eight
brews on tap. After a pint, your poor throat will be
ready for some of our house-smoked salmon, or
fresh fish, or savory smoked meats and cheeses.
