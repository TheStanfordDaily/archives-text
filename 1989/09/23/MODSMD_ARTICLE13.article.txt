# End of the line
## Quiet Palmbush lets his consistent play speak volumes 
### Tyson Vaughn 
Redshirt junior defensive tackle
Scott Palmbush is not a particu
larly loud or violent person. "A
very bright, quiet, introspective
guy ... he doesn't froth at the
mouth and get dilated eyes or any
thing like that," said defensive co
ordinator and defensive line coach
Fred vonAppen.
Somehow, this is not what you
would expect from a defensive
tackle. How good can he be if he
doesn't foam at the mouth?
Pretty good.
Playing at the opposite end of
the line from All-America candi
date Lester Archambeau,
Palmbush has not had the high
profile of his much-touted col
league, but he has not exactly
been idle.
Last year he recorded 50 tackles
and six sacks, figures he would
like to improve upon in 1989. Con
sidering that he has no aspira
tions for a career in professional
football ("I'd like to make a living
with my brain for a change," he
said), he would like to leave with
a solid, consistent college record.
As a result, Palmbush is re
solved to improve and refine his
already impressive skills. Accord
ing to vonAppen, He has natural
pass-rush ability, although his
long-range pursuit could be im
proved.
Palmbush will bring his unique
style and strong work ethic to
bear on the areas in which he
feels he is deficient. He is different
psychologically, has a different
style of play than Archambeau,
vonAppen said.
On playing with a potential All-
America teammate, Palmbush
said, "Lester is a great player. In
stead of maybe playing down to
the level of a guy who's not as
good, I can play up to his level."
Like Archambeau, Palmbush
will be seeing less playing time
than last year. The philosophy of
the new coaching regime is to

"play 'em while they're fresh," so
Palmbush will be splitting time
with sophomore Matt Borkowski.
"Last year by the end of a game
I was really dragging," Palmbush
said. In 1989, his play should be
sharper and more effective with
the new philosophy.
"Competition doesn't hurt,"
said vonAppen. "We like to build
in some insecurities to keep them

on their toes."
With the calculated determina
tion that Palmbush brings to the
field, vonAppen should have no
problem keeping him on his toes
and in top form.
"He certainly has good experi
ence, size and strength," reflected
vonAppen on Palmbush's talents.
"But sometimes I wish he had a
meaner, nastier attitude."
