# McCaffrey's return draws a good reception
## Despite sitting out all of last season, junior wide receiver hasn't lost a step 
### Greg Gottesman Editorial staff 
Die-hard Cardinal fans remember Ed
McCaffrey.
It's pretty hard to forget a sophomore
wide receiver with 30 catches, 553 yards
and an average of 48.5 yards per game.
Indeed, 1987 was McCaffrey's year.
Lady luck caught up with McCaffrey in
1988. On the second day of fall practice,
he suffered a thigh bruise. The bruise cal
cified, forcing McCaffrey to redshirt the
rest of the year.
According to McCaffrey, this year marks
a return to "business as usual." If his
performance against Oregon State (five
catches for 75 yards) is any indication of
business as usual, McCaffrey's stock value
could reach Trump proportions by season's
end.
At the moment, however, McCaffrey en
joys just being able to suit up for games.
"It just feels good to be back in uniform,"
he said.
At 6-foot-6 and 220 pounds, the lanky
McCaffrey is a quarterback's dream. Tall.
Quick. Good hands. But McCaffrey knows
he still has a lot to work on. "I need to
keep practicing my routes and remember
to change them against the blitz," he said.
"I also want to work on keeping my head
in the game and reading defenses."
While McCaffrey is back, however, the
Cardinal as a whole is struggling. In terms
of the team, McCaffrey primarily blames
lack of execution for the 0-2 start. He is
also disappointed in the squad's inability
to come up with the big play. "We need
some big plays this Saturday; we haven't
had barely any this year."
According to McCaffrey, the recent jug
gling of quarterbacks Steve Smith and
Brian Johnson has not bothered the re
ceiving corps. "During practice, we work
with all the quarterbacks and try to get
comfortable with each. So, the changes ha
ven't affected me, and I think I can speak
for the other receivers as well."
McCaffrey did admit a certain familiarity
with Johnson, though. "He was the quar
terback for much of 1987. I guess you
could say there is a certain chemistry work
ing between us."
The chemists better be on target Satur
day as Stanford will see one of the better
defenses in the Pacific 10 Conference.

Senior Oregon cornerback Chris Oldham
is the defense's leader and has 13 tackles
and one fumble recovery. But strong safety
Rory Dairy, outside linebacker Peter
Brantley and free safety Derek Horton have
been equally impressive. In the Oregon
lowa game, a 44-6 Duck win, Dairy came
up with seven tackes, Brantley six, and
Horton five. Horton also had two intercep
tions and a fumble recovery.

"They have a very good defense," McCaf
frey said. "We've played against some of
their DB's (defensive backs) before. We are
going to have to work extra hard to get
open."
Despite Oregon's 2-0 record, McCaffrey
gives the Cardinal an excellent shot if
the team is executing. "They are a great
football team," he said. "But if we can
execute both offensively and defensively,
we could give Oregon a tough game ... a
very tough game."
Without giving away too much of the
game plan, McCaffrey said to look for a
balanced attack against Oregon. With in
juries to running backs Jon Volpe, Charlie
Young and Tommy Vardell, however, the
balanced attack may sway toward the air
lanes. Of course, this means the Ducks
could be seeing more of Ed McCaffrey than
they originally planned.
As with everything else, McCaffrey
speaks modestly of personal goals. "I want
to give 110 percent on every play," he said.
"I don't want to make any mental errors.
And I want to catch every ball I can get
my hands on."
McCaffrey, obviously a potential
politician, summed up team aspirations in
typical "Bull Durham" fashion: "We just
have to take it one week at a time."

'They are a great foot
ball team. But if we can
execute both offensively
and defensively, we
could give Oregon a
tough game... a very
tough game.'

After sitting out all last season with a calcified deep thigh bruise, Ed McCaffrey is
glad to be back where the action is.
