# Cardinal tries to soar on a new wing
## Field hockey's Filner, young teammates shooting for return to NCAAs 
### Nat Cousins Editorial staff 
Stanford sophomore Katy Fil
ner has her sights set on the goal
and her goal set on the NCAA
tournament.
Filner, the starting left wing
for the field hockey team, will help
direct the Cardinal attack today
against Chico State in a critical
Northern Pacific Conference
match, one of only three at home
this year. Stanford was 1-1-1
against Chico last season and tied
the Wildcats 0-0 in a pre-season
scrimmage this year. Game time
is 11 a.m. at the hockey field,
located near El Camino.
The Cardinal failed to make the
NCAA playoffs last season for the
first time in the past four years,
finishing with an 8-5-2 mark over
all and 2-2-2 in the Northern
Pacific Conference. In addition,
Coach Sheryl Johnson's team
graduated seven seniors and will
face a challenging season with a
squad chalk full of inexperienced
faces.
Stanford enters the Chico State
game 1-1 in the NorPac Confer

ence and 1-3 overall. The Cardinal
fell 2-0 to Pacific Wednesday. The
league champion in the NorPac
division, comprised of Stanford,
California, Pacific and Chico
State, receives an automatic bid
to the NCAA tournament.
After converting from soccer
and sitting out her freshman
season with mononucleosis, Fil
ner finds herself thrust into the
starting lineup at forward for the
Cardinal.
"To be honest, we know we are
not as good as last year's team,"
Filner said. "We just don't have
the stars anymore."
What they lack in experience
and reputation, the squad hopes
to compensate for in tenacity and
spunk.
"I have real hope for this
season," said Filner. "We are
young and still super excited
about hockey. We enjoy playing
and, when we play well, we gain
confidence."
Filner was an All-Metropolitan
selection in soccer and field
hockey at Bethesda-Chevy Chase
High School in Maryland before
coming to the Farm. But before

college, hockey took a back seat
to soccer. Last year she played on
the junior varsity field hockey
team and then practiced field
hockey and soccer in the spring.
But after talking with Johnson,
a three-time Olympian in addition
to being the team's coach, she
decided to play hockey full-time.
"Switching to hockey was the
hardest thing I've ever had to do
in my life," said Filner. "She
(Johnson) showed faith in me and
made me feel needed. I wasn't
sure what to expect, but now it
feels real good."
Like much of the 1989 team,
Filner has only played in four var
sity games heading into the Chico
game. "Practice is a lot different
than the games. We are working
on our shooting and also on cut
ting to the ball," she explained.
Stanford faced a major early
season challenge Sept. 15 against
fourth-ranked lowa, losing 4-1 to
the quicker Hawkeyes at Califor
nia. Stanford held lowa to a 1-1
tie until the final two minutes of
the first half, but the Hawkeyes
pulled away from the tiring Car

dinal in the second period. lowa's
quick-strike offense was aided by
the artificial surface.
Filner, however, was encour
aged by Stanford's play. "We
showed ourselves we could play,
and we are getting better. We need
to shoot better and we have to
capitalize on our opportunities,"
Filner said. lowa later clubbed Cal
6-0.
Filner, who came to Stanford
for the sports, academics and Cal
ifornia sun, expects to major in
economics and go into business.
Also, she hopes to continue play
ing hockey. "Hockey is a game
you can keep playing. You just
keep getting better," she said.
College field hockey has under
gone a recent barrage of reduced
funding. Some West Coast schools
such as San Diego State have com
pletely canceled their programs.
At Stanford, field hockey is still
a varsity sport, although it
receives no scholarships and little
funding. Stanford field hockey
players often resort to yard work
and bake sales to raise the needed
funds.

the junior varsity field hockey
team and then practiced field
hockey and soccer in the spring.
But after talking with Johnson,
a three-time Olympian in addition
to being the team's coach, she
decided to play hockey full-time.
"Switching to hockey was the
hardest thing I've ever had to do
in my life," said Filner. "She
(Johnson) showed faith in me and
made me feel needed. I wasn't
sure what to expect, but now it
feels real good."
Like much of the 1989 team,
Filner has only played in four var
sity games heading into the Chico
game. "Practice is a lot different
than the games. We are working
on our shooting and also on cut
ting to the ball," she explained.
Stanford faced a major early
season challenge Sept. 15 against
fourth-ranked lowa, losing 4-1 to
the quicker Hawkeyes at Califor
nia. Stanford held lowa to a 1-1
tie until the final two minutes of
the first half, but the Hawkeyes
pulled away from the tiring Car

dinal in the second period. lowa's
quick-strike offense was aided by
the artificial surface.
Filner, however, was encour
aged by Stanford's play. "We
showed ourselves we could play,
and we are getting better. We need
to shoot better and we have to
capitalize on our opportunities,"
Filner said. lowa later clubbed Cal
6-0.
Filner, who came to Stanford
for the sports, academics and Cal
ifornia sun, expects to major in
economics and go into business.
Also, she hopes to continue play
ing hockey. "Hockey is a game
you can keep playing. You just
keep getting better," she said.
College field hockey has under
gone a recent barrage of reduced
funding. Some West Coast schools
such as San Diego State have com
pletely canceled their programs.
At Stanford, field hockey is still
a varsity sport, although it
receives no scholarships and little
funding. Stanford field hockey
players often resort to yard work
and bake sales to raise the needed
funds.
