# Cardinal hopes to bag a 'W' in Duck hunt
## High-powered Oregon comes to town 
### Mark Rogowsky Editorial staff 
Today's contest falls into the
"must win" category for Stanford.
For a couple of reasons, it's not
a position the Cardinal would like
to be in.
First, one hates to get desperate
this early in the year. Only two
games have passed and there's a
lot of season left to play. Still, if
Stanford hopes to get it going at
all in 1989, an 0-3 hole wouldn't
be a good starting point.
Second, today's opponent is a
tough Oregon squad. The Ducks
are ranked 23rd in the country
and are anything but a pushover.
The Cardinal will have to play
mistake-free football to win.
Meanwhile, feeling like their
backs are against the wall, the
team might be vulnerable to care
less errors.
Third, Stanford is likely to be
without the services of its two top
running backs. Charlie Young
who has yet to play a down in
1989 will likely miss the whole
season. To make matters worse,
star halfback Jon Volpe sprained
a knee in practice this week and
will see little or no action.
Volpe rushed for over 1,000
yards last year. His replacement,
Jay Jay Lasley, has rushed for 2
yards (on one carry) in his col
legiate career. Backing up Lasley
is Gary Taylor. His career total
is exactly one half of Lasley's.
So what's the good news?
Stanford finally gets to play at
home after two road contests (at
Arizona and Oregon State).
Though the crowd isn't expected
to be quite large, there's nothing
like playing in your own backyard
to provide inspiration.
In addition, outside of the
health problems at running back,
most of the cogs in the Cardinal
machine are moving in the right
direction.
Junior quarterback Brian
Johnson took over a stagnant Car
dinal offense two weeks ago and
got it going. Making the most of
his mobility, Johnson was able to
escape from the oncoming Beaver
rushers and complete passes.
With Ed McCaffrey back in
form (See page 10 for details.),
Scott Eschelman catching passes

out of the backfield and Jim Price
returning from run-and-shoot
limbo, Stanford's passing game
has the capability of piling up yar
dage in a hurry.
The success of the Cardinal of
fense, however, probably hinges
on the play of the offensive line.
Disappointing thus far, the most
notable change on the line is the
insertion of Darran Baird at right
tackle in place of John Carpenter.
Coach Denny Green is also
hoping that veterans Chuck Gil
lingham and Andy Papathanas
siou will play up to their ability.
On the left side of the line, fresh
men Bob Whitfield and Chris Dal
man should improve with each
game.
The Duck defense will counter
without a lot of big names, but
with a lot of impressive numbers.
Consider: As Oregon built a 38-0
lead at lowa last week, it allowed
the Hawkeyes a mere 74 yards.
lowa eventually mounted a scor
ing drive with two minutes to go
in the third quarter and had
a paltry 107 yards of offense to
that point.
Defensive end Matt Laßounty
is Oregon's big-play man.
Laßounty recorded three tackles
for losses against lowa. Starting
nose tackle Marcus Woods sat out
the lowa game with a knee injury.
He's back near full stregnth and
will line up alongside Laßounty,
giving an additional boost to the
Ducks.
The only unanswered question
about Oregon's defense is whether
it can stop a top running back
the Ducks haven't seen one yet.
Volpe is such a back, but will be
physically unable to exploit that
possible chink in the Ducks' ar
mor.
Finally, Oregon's defense makes
this happen. The Ducks rank
ninth nationally in turnover mar
gin at plus 2.5 per game.
On the other side of the ball,
Oregon brings the multi-talented
Bill Musgrave. The junior quar
terback is 10th in the nation ,in
passing efficiency and pilots the
offense with precision. Under
Musgrave's leadership, Oregon
has piled up 79 points in its first
two games.
On the season, Musgrave has
completed 37 of 58 passes a

nearly 64 percent clip while
amassing 494 yards. He is averag
ing 247 yards per game in the air.
His favorite target is running
back Latin Berry, but Berry is
out with a knee injury and didn't
even make the trip. Musgrave will
still have a number of options,
though. Foremost among these
are his wide receivers.
Split end Tony Hargain has
caught seven passes on the year
and averages 16.6 yards per catch.
Flanker Terry Obee has five re
ceptions and a sparkling 21.2 yard
average.
The only good news about the
Oregon offense from a Stanford
perspective is that Berry is the
Ducks' leading rusher. Talented
running back Derek Loville is off
to a very slow start in 'B9. Loville
has 122 yards on the ground, but
averages less than three yards per
carry.

The last thing Stanford needs
is for Loville to break out of his
slump today.
The Cardinal's special teams
are a mixed bag. Kicker John Hop
kins, traditionally a steady per
former, has hit on only one of
three field goal attempts this
season. Hopkins beat out high
school All-American Paul
Stonehouse for the punting job,
but has averaged only 32.3 yards
per punt.
It is possible that Stonehouse
will see his first collegiate action
today.
Alan Grant, who led the nation
in punt returns two years ago, is
averaging eight yards a try this
season a solid, but unspec
tacular figure. On kickoff returns,
though, Grant has exploded for a
35.7 yard average.
Ducks' punter Marc Penso has
posted a 42.1 yard average so far.

More impressively his net average
is an excellent 39 yards. Kicker
Gregg McCallum is 7-for-7 on ex
tra points and 6-for-7 on field
goals. Obee handles the punt
returns and is averaging a solid
11.7 yards per return.
Stanford's chances of defeating
Oregon today may well hinge on
the amount of time the respective
quarterbacks have to throw. With
the Cardinal's running game in
the training room, Stanford's line
will have to protect Johnson early
and often.
On the flip side, it's up to the
Cardinal defense and especially
sackmaster Rob Hinckley to
put the heat on Musgrave. At the
same time, Grant and Kevin Scott
will have to be in Hargain and
Obee's back pockets all day.
That accomplished, the Ducks
will have to take to the ground.
Without Berry, they may find that
to be slow going, indeed.

form (See page 10 for details.),
Scott Eschelman catching passes

out of the backfield and Jim Price
returning from run-and-shoot
limbo, Stanford's passing game
has the capability of piling up yar
dage in a hurry.
The success of the Cardinal of
fense, however, probably hinges
on the play of the offensive line.
Disappointing thus far, the most
notable change on the line is the
insertion of Darran Baird at right
tackle in place of John Carpenter.
Coach Denny Green is also
hoping that veterans Chuck Gil
lingham and Andy Papathanas
siou will play up to their ability.
On the left side of the line, fresh
men Bob Whitfield and Chris Dal
man should improve with each
game.
The Duck defense will counter
without a lot of big names, but
with a lot of impressive numbers.
Consider: As Oregon built a 38-0
lead at lowa last week, it allowed
the Hawkeyes a mere 74 yards.
lowa eventually mounted a scor
ing drive with two minutes to go
in the third quarter and had
a paltry 107 yards of offense to
that point.
Defensive end Matt Laßounty
is Oregon's big-play man.
Laßounty recorded three tackles
for losses against lowa. Starting
nose tackle Marcus Woods sat out
the lowa game with a knee injury.
He's back near full stregnth and
will line up alongside Laßounty,
giving an additional boost to the
Ducks.
The only unanswered question
about Oregon's defense is whether
it can stop a top running back
the Ducks haven't seen one yet.
Volpe is such a back, but will be
physically unable to exploit that
possible chink in the Ducks' ar
mor.
Finally, Oregon's defense makes
this happen. The Ducks rank
ninth nationally in turnover mar
gin at plus 2.5 per game.
On the other side of the ball,
Oregon brings the multi-talented
Bill Musgrave. The junior quar
terback is 10th in the nation ,in
passing efficiency and pilots the
offense with precision. Under
Musgrave's leadership, Oregon
has piled up 79 points in its first
two games.
On the season, Musgrave has
completed 37 of 58 passes a

nearly 64 percent clip while
amassing 494 yards. He is averag
ing 247 yards per game in the air.
His favorite target is running
back Latin Berry, but Berry is
out with a knee injury and didn't
even make the trip. Musgrave will
still have a number of options,
though. Foremost among these
are his wide receivers.
Split end Tony Hargain has
caught seven passes on the year
and averages 16.6 yards per catch.
Flanker Terry Obee has five re
ceptions and a sparkling 21.2 yard
average.
The only good news about the
Oregon offense from a Stanford
perspective is that Berry is the
Ducks' leading rusher. Talented
running back Derek Loville is off
to a very slow start in 'B9. Loville
has 122 yards on the ground, but
averages less than three yards per
carry.

The last thing Stanford needs
is for Loville to break out of his
slump today.
The Cardinal's special teams
are a mixed bag. Kicker John Hop
kins, traditionally a steady per
former, has hit on only one of
three field goal attempts this
season. Hopkins beat out high
school All-American Paul
Stonehouse for the punting job,
but has averaged only 32.3 yards
per punt.
It is possible that Stonehouse
will see his first collegiate action
today.
Alan Grant, who led the nation
in punt returns two years ago, is
averaging eight yards a try this
season a solid, but unspec
tacular figure. On kickoff returns,
though, Grant has exploded for a
35.7 yard average.
Ducks' punter Marc Penso has
posted a 42.1 yard average so far.

More impressively his net average
is an excellent 39 yards. Kicker
Gregg McCallum is 7-for-7 on ex
tra points and 6-for-7 on field
goals. Obee handles the punt
returns and is averaging a solid
11.7 yards per return.
Stanford's chances of defeating
Oregon today may well hinge on
the amount of time the respective
quarterbacks have to throw. With
the Cardinal's running game in
the training room, Stanford's line
will have to protect Johnson early
and often.
On the flip side, it's up to the
Cardinal defense and especially
sackmaster Rob Hinckley to
put the heat on Musgrave. At the
same time, Grant and Kevin Scott
will have to be in Hargain and
Obee's back pockets all day.
That accomplished, the Ducks
will have to take to the ground.
Without Berry, they may find that
to be slow going, indeed.

Now in his third season with the Ducks, quarterback Bill Musgrave
has shown that while his health has been a question, his ability
most certainly is not.


Michael Topolovac - Daily file
Inside linebacker Jono Tunney, the Cardinal's leading tackier last season, has been a big load for
opposing backs to shoulder.
Today's contest falls into the
"must win" category for Stanford.
For a couple of reasons, it's not
a position the Cardinal would like
to be in.
First, one hates to get desperate
this early in the year. Only two
games have passed and there's a
lot of season left to play. Still, if
Stanford hopes to get it going at
all in 1989, an 0-3 hole wouldn't
be a good starting point.
Second, today's opponent is a
tough Oregon squad. The Ducks
are ranked 23rd in the country
and are anything but a pushover.
The Cardinal will have to play
mistake-free football to win.
Meanwhile, feeling like their
backs are against the wall, the
team might be vulnerable to care
less errors.
Third, Stanford is likely to be
without the services of its two top
running backs. Charlie Young
who has yet to play a down in
1989 will likely miss the whole
season. To make matters worse,
star halfback Jon Volpe sprained
a knee in practice this week and
will see little or no action.
Volpe rushed for over 1,000
yards last year. His replacement,
Jay Jay Lasley, has rushed for 2
yards (on one carry) in his col
legiate career. Backing up Lasley
is Gary Taylor. His career total
is exactly one half of Lasley's.
So what's the good news?
Stanford finally gets to play at
home after two road contests (at
Arizona and Oregon State).
Though the crowd isn't expected
to be quite large, there's nothing
like playing in your own backyard
to provide inspiration.
In addition, outside of the
health problems at running back,
most of the cogs in the Cardinal
machine are moving in the right
direction.
Junior quarterback Brian
Johnson took over a stagnant Car
dinal offense two weeks ago and
got it going. Making the most of
his mobility, Johnson was able to
escape from the oncoming Beaver
rushers and complete passes.
