## Oregon's Musgrave among nation's elite signal callers 
### David Hirning Editorial staff 
When Stanford Coach Denny
Green sends Brian Johnson out
to start at quarterback for the
Cardinal today, it will simply be
the latest chapter in a confusing
rotation of players at the position
the last three seasons. It is strik
ing how different the situation is
for Oregon Coach Rich Brooks.
Junior Bill Musgrave will be
taking the snaps for the Ducks
and is not likely to be budged
from his position behind the cen
ter. Already this season the 6-foot
3, 196-pounder has proven that
he is among the top quarterbacks
in the Pacific 10 Conference and
in the nation at large.
Musgrave has already passed
for 494 yards and six TDs in two
games for Oregon, leading his
team to a 35-19 victory over Cal
ifornia and a resounding 44-6
trouncing of lowa in lowa City.
Against the Hawkeyes last week,
Musgrave had one of his finest
games, connecting on 20 of 27
passes for 263 yards and three
TDs.
For his efforts, Musgrave was
named the Pac-10 offensive player
of the week. He is now ranked
10th nationally in passing efficiei
cy. Oregon has vaulted into th
national rankings and is one of
the favorites to capture the Pac-10
title, largely due to his play.

Yet Musgrave is not going into
today's game against the 0-2 Car
dinal with a swagger. "We've been
ranked in all of the last three
years," Musgrave said. "It can dis
appear really fast, and hopefully
we're not overconfident at all."
Indeed, it can disappear in a
hurry. There has been endless
speculation on what might have
been for the 1988 Oregon squad,
which started the season 6-1 and
was nationally ranked before
losing Musgrave to a broken col
larbone. In fact, Musgrave was
5-0, having missed two early
games with an ankle injury. Fol
lowing Musgrave's second injury,
the Ducks lost the last five games
of the season to prevent what had
seemed like a sure bowl season.
Perhaps there have been some
might-have-beens amongst Stan
ford fans as well, considering the
fact the Musgrave nearly became
a Cardinal. As a high schooler out
of Colorado, the promising young
ster was rated third at his position
behind recruits Johnson and Scott
Stark and was denied a scholar
ship.
"I think I would have gone to
Stanford (if a scholarship was of
fered)," Musgrave said. "I was im
nressed with the campus, and
ey obviously have a great tra
tion of academics and athletics."
When the Cardinal turned him
away, Musgrave chose Oregon
over Yale, fulfilling a childhood

dream to play in the Pac-10. Three
seasons and two games later, it
appears Stanford made a serious
error.
Johnson has not been a disap
pointment, but his lack of consis
tency has hurt the team. Stark
was an all-out bust, starting one
game (a 49-0 loss to UCLA) in
1987 before losing the job to
Johnson and eventually transfer
ring to Saddleback Junior College.
Musgrave's record against Stan
ford is only so-so, losing in the
last seconds in 1987 and winning
a tight 7-3 contest last year,
despite two interceptions. But al
though injuries have prevented
him from playing a full season
each of his first two years, he has
shown the ability to hurt any op
posing team's defense.
Stanford's three-year starting
cornerback, Kevin Scott, has seen

'Musgrave has a
very accurate arm.
He doesn't miss
his receivers.'
Kevin Scott
enough of Musgrave to respect his
ability. "Musgrave has a very ac
curate arm," the junior said. "He
doesn't miss his receivers."
In his two shortened seasons
and 1989's 2-0 start, Musgrave
has passed for 3,145 yards and
27 TDs. Both totals put him on
a pace to threaten Oregon greats

Dan Fouts and Chris Miller, if he
can stay healthy.
Musgrave would like nothing
more than to avoid injury. "It's
definitely frustrating," he said. "I
didn't expect to be injured (in col
lege). I haven't made it through
a whole season yet, and it's tough
to play only five or six games."
Unfortunately for Stanford,
Musgrave is fit and ready to play
today. "The strength of their team
is that with Musgrave in the
lineup, they win games," said

Stanford's Green. A look at the
record shows Oregon with a 12-3
mark in games Musgrave has
started and finished.
"I think that Musgrave has the
ability to make the plays," Brooks
said of his quarterback. "I just
hope we can keep him healthy for
an 11-game season, just to see
what he does."
What he may do is rewrite some
record books and make Stanford
rue the day they sent Musgrave
to Oregon.
