Stanford

Bill Musgrave comes into
today's game as perhaps the top
quarterback in the Pac-10. If he
has time to sit in the pocket, he
will pick the Cardinal defense
apart, moving the ball all day long.
On the other hand, if Hinckley,
the Pac-10's sack leader last year,
can get to Musgrave, things will
be looking up for the home team.

Last year at this time, Tony
Hargain was just another basket
ball player, walking the sidelines
as a backup on the football team.
But after working hard this sum
mer, Hargain has gotten off to a
hot start in 1989, with seven
catches for 116 yards and two TDs
in two games. It will be up to
Kevin Scott to stop him. If Scott
plays the way he has been, Har
gain might be tempted to turn
his thoughts back to basketball.

Stanford's defense has been
strong against the run so far this
season, especially against inside
runs. The key has been the play
of inside linebackers Jono Tunney
and Kevin Puk. Puk, a redshirt
freshman, won the job in fall camp
and has refused to relinquish it,
giving a fine account of himself
in both of Stanford's games.
Loville has rushed 129 yards but
is averaging a mere 2.9 per carry.

When the Cardinal runs the
ball, look for collisions between a
pair of freshmen. Inside line
backer Joe Farwell is the Ducks'
leading tackier this season and
has been a pleasant surprise for
Coach Rich Brooks. Coach Denny
Green, on the other hand, received
a rather unpleasant surprise when
he found out knee injuries would
keep projected starters Jon Volpe
and Charlie Young out of the Car
dinal backfield. Getting the start
at halfback is Jay Jay Lasley, who
has one carry for two yards in
his college career.

With the ground game
decimated by injury, Stanford
with Brian Johnson at quarter
back will look to air it out. His
favorite target will likely be 6-
foot-6 wideout Ed McCaffrey, who
adds a 36-inch vertical leap to his
height. McCaffrey will be covered
by Chris Oldham, the best player
in the Oregon secondary. You see,
Oldham is 5-9. If Stanford can
work this matchup often, the ball
will move like it did in the Elway
(John, that is) Era.

Stanford's offense has struggled
this season and much of the blame
has fallen on the Cardinal's young
offensive line. In an effort to im
prove the unit's play, Coach Denny
Green inserted Darran Baird into
the starting lineup at right tackle.
He will be tested all day long as
he will line up against Matt
Laßounty. Laßounty has two
quarterback sacks and five addi
tional tackles for loss this season.
.While Brian Johnson, Stanford's
new starting quarterback, is con
sidered mobile, he will have prob
lems completing passes if he
spends the afternoon waltzing
with Laßounty in the backfield.
