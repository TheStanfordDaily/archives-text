Their
Word processor
could bury you.
All you want to do is finish your
term paper and turn it in on time. But to
do it you need a major in Computer
Science and a minor in Users Manuals!
What a drag!
Not so with Mac Write 11.
Mac Write 11, the essential academic
Macintosh word processor, was
designed to make it easy to get up and
running, but also provides enough
sophisticated features for more
advanced users.
Mac Write II offers the essen
tials, like footnotes or endnotes,
multiple columns, headers and
footers, a lightning fast 100,000
word spell checker, a thesaurus
with 220,000 synonyms, and
word counting so you don't go
one word over your 1000
CLARI S
word assignment. Mac Write II also
features a revolutionary new built in
help system so you can study some
thing else besides the manual.
And if you're taking a foreign
language Mac Write II will make it a
little less foreign with optional foreign
language dictionaries.
Choosing the right word processor
can make or break you. Make the
Mac Write II choice.
The time to buy is now!
