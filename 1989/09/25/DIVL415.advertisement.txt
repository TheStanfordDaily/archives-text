Amy is in communications.
She's learning how to design
data transmissions systems
and how to link satellites in
geosynchronous orbit.
Unfortunately she's never
learned how to talk.
()! course, it Amy read The New York Times regularly, she'd find out what
the rest of the world actually does with all her communications hardware. Wh\
data lines hum. Why satellites glow 24 hours a day. Why people talk to each
other and what they talk about. She might even...eventually...join the
conversation.
Amy's fate doesn't have to be yours. Just till out the coupon or see our repre
sentative on campus. We can arrange to put The Times in your hands every
morning for an unspeakably low price.
