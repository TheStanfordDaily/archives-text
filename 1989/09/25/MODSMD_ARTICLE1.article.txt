# Challenging the freshmen
## Kennedy, COP offer advice on adopting political values 
### John Wagner Editorial staff 
University President Donald
Kennedy and Council of Presi
dents member Ingrid Nava cast
competing challenges to incom
ing freshmen and transfer stu
dents at Friday night's welcom
ing program.
While Kennedy cautioned stu
dents to "harbor a healthy
mistrust" of "correct politics"
before changing their own value
systems, Nava urged students
to rally behind a progressive
agenda to alter the status quo
at Stanford.
Kennedy and Nava spoke as
part of a program including
speeches by Dean of Undergrad
uate Admissions Jean Fetter

and Orientation coordinator
Millie Gong, as well as a slide
show and a performance by the
Fleet Street Singers.
Speaking in Memorial Audi
torium, Kennedy advised the
students to place more trust in
the values they bring to Stan
ford and to hesitate before
adopting others' agendas.
"In response to all those who
will invite you to adopt their
agendas and their values, you
should ask hard questions, make
them prove everything twice
and then decide," Kennedy said.
"And remember, there is plenty
of time."
Nava, a member of the
Agenda for Action coalition,
which staged a politically
motivated takeover of Ken

nedy's office last spring, lauded
the "creative tension" the
takeover produced and told stu
dents not to be satisfied with
the status quo at Stanford.
"There comes a time to take
courageous and bold action,"
Nava said. "My commitment to
making things better on this
campus led me to participate in
the takeover of President Ken
nedy's office."
Fifty-six students, including
Nava. were arrested as a result
of the takeover.
Nava challenged the freshmen
to leave Stanford a better place
than they find it. She cited the
impact on the civil rights move
ment of four black freshmen who

in 1960 sat at a lunch counter in
Greensboro, N.C., demanding an
end to segregation.
"If four students in 1960 did
all of that, think of what moun
tains your class can move," she
said.
Nava said the takeover of Ken
nedy's office has facilitated com
mitments from the University to
a number of the Agenda for Action
coalition's demands, including a
full-time dean of El Centro Chi
cano, increased budget allocations
for teaching assistants and a
search for an Asian-American
studies professor.
"We received a commitment to
search for a professor to teach
Asian-American studies," she
said, "so the story of the Asian-
Americans who built the railroads
that made Leland Stanford rich
can be told."
Early in his speech, Kennedy
explained the reasoning behind
the University's Policy on Campus
Disruption. Protesters in the May
takeover were each sentenced to

75 hours of service work for violat
ing this code, which prohibits
blocking access to buildings and
disrupting University business.
"We take that policy very
seriously," Kennedy said. "Our
basic educational activities simply
can't be taken hostage to fulfill
some set of convictions, no matter
how deeply or sincerely held."
Throughout his speech, Ken
nedy emphasized the values of
open intellectual discussion. "I
hope that in your life here, you
will experience often the thrill of
testing a newly formed idea
against the critical yet caring
judgment of others, and finding
that it's validated."
Maintaining such discourse in
a pluralistic community like Stan
ford can be difficult, Kennedy
said. "Disagreement is often pow
erful, and we're not very good at
dealing with the personal disaf
fection that is likely to follow
strong disagreements," he said.
"We have something to learn
about disagreement without
alienation."
Kennedy explained that during
the past year there had been ef
forts to alter the Fundamental
Standard so it would penalize

forms of speech considered to ha
rass minority groups.
He noted that although other
institutions had adopted restric
tions of speech, Stanford, follow
ing "lively and constructive
debate," did not.
"Let me make it clear that har
rassing or demeaning speech di
rected against individuals or a
group of specified individuals is
out," Kennedy said.
However, he added, "There is
room at Stanford for the expres
sion of opinion, even if it is dis
tasteful or misguided, about gen
eral matters of race, or ethnicity,
or religion, or gender or sexual
preference."
During the early part of her
speech, Nava related the influence
of her upbringing on her desire
to better Stanford. "I am a
Chicana from San Antonio, Texas,
born to a single mother who holds
a job as a postal clerk," she said.
"She gave every day of her life
to me, so that I might one day
be here at Stanford. . . . Invested
in this sacrifice was the hope for
me to have the opportunities that
she was never able to have, so all
of her hopes and dreams were part
of my hopes and dreams.
