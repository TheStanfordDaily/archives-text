### John Wagner Editorial staff 
University President Donald
Kennedy and Council of Presi
dents member Ingrid Nava cast
competing challenges to incom
ing freshmen and transfer stu
dents at Friday night's welcom
ing program.
While Kennedy cautioned stu
dents to "harbor a healthy
mistrust" of "correct politics"
before changing their own value
systems, Nava urged students
to rally behind a progressive
agenda to alter the status quo
at Stanford.
Kennedy and Nava spoke as
part of a program including
speeches by Dean of Undergrad
uate Admissions Jean Fetter

and Orientation coordinator
Millie Gong, as well as a slide
show and a performance by the
Fleet Street Singers.
Speaking in Memorial Audi

students to place more trust in

ford and to hesitate before
adopting others' agendas.
"In response to all those who
will invite you to adopt their
agendas and their values, you
should ask hard questions, make
them prove everything twice
and then decide," Kennedy said.
"And remember, there is plenty
of time."
Nava, a member of the
Agenda for Action coalition,
which staged a politically
motivated takeover of Ken

nedy's office last spring, lauded
the "creative tension" the
takeover produced and told stu

the status quo at Stanford.
"There comes a time to take
courageous and bold action,"
Nava said. "My commitment to
making things better on this
campus led me to participate in
the takeover of President Ken
nedy's office."
Fifty-six students, including
Nava. were arrested as a result
of the takeover.
Nava challenged the freshmen
to leave Stanford a better place
than they find it. She cited the
impact on the civil rights move
