WINDHOEK, Namibia (AP) - Guerrilla leader
Sam Nujoma, emqwcfced to become Namibia's first
black leader, told 70,000 jubilant supporters yes
terday that he will build a democratic government
that encompasses all political views.
Nujoma's speech was his first in Namibia since
he went into exile in 1959.
The crowd also comprised one of the largest
political meetings in this territory where, under
a U.N. independence plan, South Africa gradually
is relinquishing control after 74 years.
The crowd, predominantly black with a handful
of whites, packed a sports stadium to hear
Nujoma, president of the South-West Africa
People's Organization, who returned from exile
on Sept. 14.
Namibians, he said, have "a historic opportu
nity for our people to choose a government of
the people, by the people, for the people" at
independence elections in November.
Nujoma called for reconciliation in this former
German colony, where his organization has
fought a largely unsuccessful bush war since
1966 to end South African rule.
He promised that if his left-leaning movement
gains control of a post-independence government
it will not exclude those with differing views.
"SWAPO has no intention of imposing a one

party political system on the Namibian people
against their will," he said, repeating a previously
stated reversal of party policy. "SWAPO does not
intend to rule Namibia alone, but will Bggk lb-.-
participation "of others in formulating and impV
menting policy." ' »< ♦ <
