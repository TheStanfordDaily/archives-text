CHARLESTON, S.C. (AP) - Victims of Hur
ricane Hugo scrambled to meet life's basic needs
yesterday, fretting over shortages of food, fresh
water, cash and electricity. Unable to cook or boil
water, people stood for blocks waiting for hot meals.
"There's no bread, there's no meat," said Harold
Washington, 21, at a supermarket that had dough
nuts and peanut butter but lacked staples. "You
can't survive like that. Things just aren't working
-fast- enmtgti" ~ mm
Washington, who lives with his mother and four
siblings, said the family was burning candles at
night and washing clothes by hand. They worried
that the water they were using to brush their teeth
was contaminated.
National Guardsmen with M-16 rifles patrolled
the streets of the battered city of 65,000 people,
guarding against looters and keeping order at loca
tions where residents lugged coolers and plastic jugs
to get fresh water.
By last jught, 27 people had been charged with
looting in Charleston. About a dozen others had
been arrested for such offenses as disorderly conduct,
violating the curfew and petty larceny.
An emergency law enacted Saturday night sought
to keep profiteers from charging $10 for a bag of
ice and $600 for a chain saw. Tempers flared at
one location where people sought ice to keep their
food fresh.
"People were . . . begging for ice," said Staff Sgt.
Bill Petty of the South Carolina National Guard.
"There were fistfights in the line. They were down
on-the-ground fights — men and women."
Without electricity for a third day, residents were
unable to cook, boil water for drinking or get cash
from bank machines. At stores that managed to
reopen Saturday, people waited in lines for up to

four hours.
Full power was restored to all five downtown
hospitals in Charleston by last night, according to
officials with South Carolina Electric and Gas Co.
The hospitals had been using generators.
The Red Cross dished out hot meals from lunch
wagons. At the Citadel Square Baptist Church, the
line stretched for three blocks, spokesman Brian
Ruberry said.

"I eat wherever I can get a meal," said Holmes,
who had no food at home. "My neighborhood looks
like a trash barrel. Everything is out — trees, light
poles, cars overturned."
Wilma McDonald patched holes in her roof
damaged by fallen pine trees, although water con
tinued to drip. She was buoyed when Allstate in
surance adjuster Kent Robinson gave her a $500
check to get the trees removed.
"You don't know how glad I am to see somebody,"
Mrs. McDonald said. "I was at my wit's end."
People rummaged through the chaos wrought by
Hugo to find what they had lost and what they
could still salvage. Mostly, neighbors did what they
could to get by.
Kenneth Watson, 34, of North Charleston, filled
a bathtub with water before Hugo hit, but he and
11 relatives have no power. Yesterday, he bought
groceries at a Piggly Wiggly supermarket even
though money is short.
"You can't get your checks and no banks are
open. I just hope something comes by," Watson said.
If no relief comes, Watson said, "I'll do it the
old-time way and go down to the river and fish."
