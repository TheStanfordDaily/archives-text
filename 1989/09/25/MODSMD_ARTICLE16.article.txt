# Editorial
## Editor's welcome 
### 
When the Big Story breaks,
an editor's first inclination
is to drop everything else
and focus all his or her attention
on that story.
The day's top story must be cov
ered extremely well with careful
attention to factual detail and
proper presentation, since the
reporter often provides the only
source of news to the reader.
It's a gut reaction, however, that
must be avoided to maintain a
newspaper's overall quality of cov
erage, especially in a setting where
one newspaper is the main news
source.
In the past, The Daily has occa
sionally fallen into the "big story
trap" losing sight of the several
"less important" issues and stories
that shape campus life.
For two years, the Great Debate
over Western Culture — and even
tually Cultures , Ideas and Values
— overshadowed many other
events that probably would have
received more attention had a
single issue not been the hot topic
on campus.
The gap left by ClV's passage
was filled last year by a racial in
cident that led to campuswide dis
cussion of the sometimes con
flicting rights of free speech and
freedom from harassment.
That, debate will continue, at
stftiMpynflu fff&rif other cam-
but The Daily will make it
a point not to drop everything else.
To provide proper coverage of
Big Game, we should not have to
cut a story about a field hockey
game, and the closing of Roble Hall
for seismic reinforcement does not
preclude coverage of a letter
writing campaign by Stanford's
Amnesty International chapter.
To make that breadth of cover
age possible, The Daily will run
more briefs than before, and news
and sports stories will generally be
shorter.
Controversial issues will still be

explained in full detail, since we
are a "why" newspaper as well as
a "what" newspaper. However, an
emphasis on tighter writing styles
will enable us to tell straightfor
ward stories in a shorter space.
Other internal changes will im
prove our ability to explain what
a story means, instead of simply
what happened. Background and
context are essential to getting the
story right.
This volume, a new editorial po
sition has been created so that one
editor will focus on in-depth series
and investigative reporting, an
area where lack of continuity —
rather than lack of talent —
usually prevents college newspa
pers from developing the relation
ships needed to do solid in-depth
journalism.
The Daily enjoys an unusually
fortunate status as an independent
student newspaper, which allows
us to present a balanced view of
the news. We are not controlled by
either the University or the stu
dent government, and thus are
solely responsible for what we
write.
We will hold both the University
administration and the student
government accountable for their
actions. After all, we are paying
$20,000 a year to live in the Stan
ford world.
The Daily has undergone many
changes in the past two years, the
most significant ones making it
possible for editors to put the paper
and themselves to bed at a sane
hour and for readers to get their
paper consistently by 9 a.m.
Now that editors and writers get
the recommended daily allowance
of sleep, we can present a more
comprehensive picture of Stanford
— a picture of Stanford you can
help shape.
