Council of Presidents urges multicultural education

As the year starts, we are all
looking forward to meeting new
people, beginning new relation
ships, and making new friends. Al
though we may not always think about
it, we are fortunate to be building
these relationships in a community
that is diverse and multifaceted. The
rainbow of cultures is represented here
at Stanford, and our relationships in
the dorm and in the classroom take
place in the context of this multicul
tural community.
In his introductory speech to new
students, President Kennedy advised,
"This is the real world .. . the tasks
we perform here are exactly the ones
we will need to accomplish in building
communities elsewhere and everywhere
later on." He was letting us know that
while building a pluralistic community
may sometimes be difficult, these
difficulties are well worth the effort.
In order to understand what has
shaped the lives and perspectives of all
students at this university, we need to
learn about the histories and the
experiences of all people in this com
munity, particularly those of people of
color that have been denied in this
country.
The task before us, to build a multi
cultural community, is the task con
fronting people all over our nation
today. In the face of a society where
people are divided and oppressed along
racial lines, those who believe in re
spect for all people are struggling to
define how we can live together and
move our society toward equality
between people of different ethnic
backgrounds.
As the Council of Presidents, we
believe that here at Stanford, we can
build a multicultural community and
that our greatest challenge this year is
to unite the campus around that goal.
This challenge is difficult, but proba-

bly one of the most critical ones that
we will ever encounter. To meet this
challenge we will need to make sure
that our education and our curriculum
incorporate the study of people of
color; for without understanding one
another and ourselves, we will not be
able to live together.
To meet this challenge we will also
need to respect the organizations that
students of color have built in order to
fulfill their needs; for only when indi
vidual communities are strong can we
come together on a basis of respect
and equality.
We have sometimes failed to rise to
the challenge, and the result has been
bitter divisions and feelings of betrayal
The Ujamaa incident, in which two
students posted a racially offensive
picture beside the door of a black
student, the backlash against the stu
dents of color organizations and the
need for a multicultural coalition of
students to resort to something as
drastic as an office takeover, are signs
that we need to make more of an
effort.
But the majority of students here
want to build a multicultural commu
nity where all students are free from
racial and sexual harassment and to
work for a more diverse and equal

society overall. It is in admitting our
mistakes and resolving to move for
ward that we allow ourselves to con
tinue our forward progression toward a
truly pluralistic Stanford.
But despite sometimes encountering
difficulties and failures, students at
Stanford are rising to meet this chal
lenge. We are proud of Stanford's
distinction of being one of the first
universities to broaden its core curricu
lum to include the works of our di
verse American cultures as well as
cultures outside the West. We're also
proud of the many students, led by the
Black Student Union, who brought the
issue to the entire campus so that this
year every frosh will take a CIV track!
Students at Stanford are committed
to bringing about a truly multicultural
community. Students from the Asian
American Student Association, MEChA,
the Black Student Union and the
Stanford American Indian Organization
are the ones who challenged university
faculty and staff to open up the doors
to students of color; to build the ethnic
theme dorms; to institute African
American, Chicano, and now Asian
American Studies; and to build many
other institutions that make Stanford
what it is today.
Students were also the driving force
behind the formation of SWOPSI
(which is now celebrating its 20th
year!), the Advising Associate program,
the Women's Center, Feminist Studies,
among many other programs.
Students at Stanford have done all
this because we are concerned about
our education and our nation's future.
And we're taking action now to ensure
that we can make a difference in
shaping the direction of our society.
Students at Stanford tutor in East
Palo Alto, work for more Ethnic
Studies courses at Stanford, help or
ganize marches and lobbying efforts to

increase public school funding, and
sponsor conferences that deal with the
critical issues in education. Students
are the nation's future and we have
already shown that we take our re
sponsibility seriously.
We know that Stanford students
have the courage and conviction to
meet the challenge of building a multi
cultural community, and we, as the
Council of Presidents, look forward to
working with you to make it happen.
And as Saturday's football game
showed, when Stanford students pull
together we can overcome the greatest
of odds! Keep Hope Alive!!
