# New dorm to open in '91
## Donations to fund 200-bed hall on Manzanita site 
### Jill Daniels Staff writer 
Four years of guaranteed
housing is one step closer, thanks
to private donations that will fund
a new 200-bed undergraduate res
idence to open in two years.
In an announcement to be re
leased today, University President
Donald Kennedy revealed that
Stanford graduate William Kim
ball and his wife Sara have com
mitted $3 million for construction
of the dormitory.
The residence, to be named
Kimball Hall, will be located just
south of Branner Hall and will
replace about 20 of the 116
trailers in Manzanita Park. Con
struction is scheduled to begin
next June and to be completed by
September 1991.
"The Kimballs' extremely gen

erous gift now makes it possible
for us to move toward our goal
of full housing for all undergrad
uates who want it," Kennedy said.
Last June, the Board of Trus
tees approved the concept of
building a new 200- space facility.
Less than 24 hours later, Kennedy
announced at Senior Class Day
that Trustees Peter Bing and
Thomas Ford had offered pledges
totaling $4 million for the project.
That amount was $3 million
short of the funding needed to
start the $10 million project. The
Kimballs' donation filled the gap.
"I was always frustrated that
the University couldn't guarantee
rooms for every undergraduate
student," said William Kimball,
former president of the Board of
Trustees and a co-chair of the
Centennial Campaign.
He said the "catalyst" for his

donation was the donation by
Bing and Ford.
With $7 million now committed
to the project, the University
hopes that more contributions will
flow in to cover the remaining
$3 million cost.
Kimball Hall will be composed
of several interconnected build
ings. There are no blueprints yet,
but the architects hope to present
a preliminary floor plan to the
Board of Trustees Oct. 10, indi
cating tentative sizes for the hall's
buildings.
The plan will be revised
throughout the year, and in Feb
ruary a final plan will be submit
ted to the Board with more detail
and specific floor plans. The hall
will be designed so that additional
wings can be added in the future.
"It is being masterplanned to
eventually allow for 500 to 650
beds on the site. It will have its
own dining facility and will be
modeled after Branner, Roble and
those type of buildings," Williams
said.
Kimball Hall will be designed
by the San Francisco-based ar
chitectural firm of Backen, Ar
rigoni and Ross, Inc.
Curtis Williams, director of fa
cilities project management, said
the firm was selected by the Ad
ministrative Council and Board of
Trustees based on recommenda
tions from both Williams and Uni
versity Architect David Neuman.
"The firm is programatically
sound and also economically rea
sonable," Williams said.
