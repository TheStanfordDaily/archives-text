## Now is time for pro-choice advocates 
### 
During the past summer while many
of us were away working at sum
mer jobs or just taking a break
from school, the Supreme Court voted
5-4 to uphold the provisions of a Missouri
law severely restricting women's access
to abortion through prohibitions against
the use of public facilities and the im
position of controversial viability tests.
Chief Justice William Rehnquist
refused to consider the law's preamble,
which declares that life begins at concep
tion, nor did the mfyority opinions ad
dress the crippling effects that such leg
islation could have on women who have
assumed that their reproductive rights
were protected by the landmark decision
of Roe v. Wade. As Justice William Black
mun noted in his impassioned dissent:
"Of the aspirations and settled under
standings of American 'women, of the in
evitable and brutal consequences of what
it is doing, the tough-approach plurality
utters not a word. This silence is callous.
It is also profoundly destructive of this
Court as an institution."
Here in California, despite the protec
tions offered by the state constitution's
explicit right to privacy, legislative at
tempts to restrict access to abortion and

family planning services persist. Gov.
George Deukmejian first tried to elimi
nate the Office of Family Planning and
then slashed its budget by two-thirds ar
guing that it is "ineffective" in reducing
abortions although state-funded abor
tions have declined by 27 percent since
1977.
This lack of funding means that
Planned Parenthood will no longer be
able to screen for cervical cancer or sub
sidize pregnancy tests. In Santa Clara
County alone, approximately 14,500 of
the 22,000 women receiving subsidies
may have to forego services.
In addition to these cutbacks, Sen. Pete
Wilson's proposed Crime Victims' ballot
initiative contains language that would
weaken California's explicit right to
privacy' which serves as the legal corner
stone of abortion rights in this state and
is the sole protection against restrictive
abortion laws that still exist in California
law. The initiative would limit state con
stitutional protections for criminal defen
dants, including privacy, to narrower
federal standards. Although no one can
predict whether this measure will be used
to restrict abortion in California, Harvard
Law Prof. Laurence Tribe has deemed it

"a dangerous booby trap for the women
of California."
Despite these setbacks, pro-choice ad
vocates still have cause to be hopeful
about the future of women's reproductive
rights. In the wake of the Webster deci
sion, a Newsweek public opinion poll con
firmed that a m£yority of Americans sup
port a woman's right to choose, with 58
percent indicating that they do not want
Roe v. Wade overturned. And now that
the Court has left the issue open to state
legislatures, more and more political can
didates are declaring themselves to be
pro-choice or moderating their anti
abortion stance. Although these are
promising signs, the attempts of many
state legislatures to restrict abortion and
the cases pending before the Supreme
Court make it crucial for pro-choice ad
vocates to mobilfze~Now more than ever,
it is time for the "silent" meyority of
pro-choice supporters to make themselves
heard — in the legislature, in the press,
and here at Stanford.
