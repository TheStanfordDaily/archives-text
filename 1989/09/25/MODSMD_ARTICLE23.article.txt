# Summer news highlights:
## From takeover carryover to spraying sprinklers 
### Elizabeth Howton Editorial staff 
Been gone all summer and
missed all the campus news? Not
to worry. Here are the highlights
of a fairly calm Stanford summer,
compiled from articles in The
Stanford Weekly (the summer
publication of The Stanford Daily)
and from Stanford University
News Service.

Noting that traditional Native
American religious beliefs hold an
cestral remains to be sacred,
Provost James Rosse announced
University plans to return the re
mains of about 550 Native Amer
icans to elders of the Ohlone-
Costanoan people. The decision
was earlier approved unanimously
by both the anthropology faculty
and a provost's advisory commit
tee on campus archaeology.
The Board of Trustees approved
"the concept" of demolishing 20
of the 116 aging Manzanita
trailers and replacing them with
a 200-person dormitory. Two
anonymous trustees also pledged
$2 million each toward the $10-
million project, and trustee Roy
Anderson agreed to match dollar
for-dollar the money raised by the
class of 1989, whose goal is
$50,000. Built in 1969 as "tem
porary emergency" housing, the
trailers were intended to be
removed in three to five years.
They celebrate their 20th anni
versary this fall.

After weeks of debate and de
liberation, 51 of the 53 students
charged with violating the Uni
versity's Policy on Campus Dis
ruption were sentenced by the
University to perform 75 hours
of community service work, Uni
versity President Donald Kennedy
announced. The students, who
were all involved in the May 15
occupation of Kennedy's office,
will also be on probation for one
year.
Participants in the office
takeover called for increased eth
nic studies and the hiring of a
professor to teach Asian-
American studies, among other
demands. Dean of Student Affairs
James Lyons said the University
would have no objection to the
protesters fulfilling their Univer
sity sentences and any county
imposed sentences concurrently.

Forty-seven of the students ar
rested in the takeover entered a
plea of no contest to the charge
of trespassing. District Attorney
Tom Farenholz dropped four other
charges, and Judge Stephen Man
ley indicated that the sentence will
be 40 hours of community service
and six months probation.
But because none Of the 47 ap
peared in court, Manley
postponed formal sentencing until
Oct. 6 because he wanted to speak
to the protesters in person. Man
ley also said the hours of commu
nity service must be counted
separately from the 75 hours of

community service imposed by the
University.
Four other students face the
more serious charge of "obstruct
ing a police officer in performing
a duty." They plan to enter their
pleag Oct. 6. Another student,
Louis Jackson, faces charges of
battery and inciting a riot, in ad
dition 1 to trespassing and obstruc
tion charges. Dan Barton, the
attorney for the students, said
that pressing the stricter charges
against the four students "is an
attempt to deflect attention from
Louis Jackson. They realized it
was politically unwise to single
out one black man."
Bert Gerow, Stanford professor
emeritus of anthropology, publicly
claimed ownership of hundreds of
Native American remains in an
effort to block University plans
to return them to descendants of
the Ohlone tribe. "These addi
tions were the direct result of my
research and teaching activities,"
Gerow said in a letter to Anthro
pology Chair James Gibbs.
Gibbs had the locks on the col
lection changed "to protect the
University's claim to the materials
until such time as ownership can
be formally determined."
An incriminating diary entry
led police to arrest 1988 Stanford
graduate James Ransom July 10
for the theft of approximately
$15,000 worth of University
owned computers. The diary pro
vided evidence that Ransom was
responsible for six computer bur
glaries in 1988, mostly from the
Hoover Institution.
The University received ap
proval for a revised general use
permit by a 6-0 vote of the Santa
Clara County Planning Commis
sion July 6. Five years in the
making, the permit includes a new
process for campus homeowners
and the University to resolve dis
putes. Expected to cover likely de

velopment through the year 2000,
the new permit would enable the
University to add 2.1 million
square feet of buildings and about
2,000 more people beyond previ
ously approved growth.
Officials for the Shrine of North
America announced plans to con
struct a $65 million medical fa
cility in Northern California at
either Stanford, UC-San Fran
cisco or UC-Davis. The Shrine is
a charitable and fraternal organ
ization that operates hospitals
specializing in burn treatment and
orthopedic medicine. Although
David Korn, vice president and
dean of the School of Medicine,
responded favorably to the pro

posal, no provisions for construc
tion of a new hospital were made
in Stanford's general use permit.
A University Sexual Assault
Task Force, initiated by the Rape
Education Project student group
and approved by Dean of Student
Affairs James Lyons in early May,
formed over the summer. Co
chaired by junior Suzanne
O'Brien and Health Promotion
Director Patricia Fabiano, the
task force also includes Director
of Residential Education Alice
Supton, Ombudsperson Leah
Kaplan, Asst. Director of Gradu
ate Residences Chris Griffith,
Stanford Police Chief Marv
Herrington and Alejandro Mar

tinez and Cathy Stevenson of
Cowell Student Health Center.
A faculty representative and
student members of REP,
Heighten Education on Acquaint
ance Rape and the Interfraternity
Council will make up the balance
of the committee, which will meet
at least four times per quarter
for 18 months to develop im
proved awareness of and re
sponses to rape on campus.
A search committee for an
Asian-American studies professor
was formed, pledging to begin its
search early this fall with the goal
of hiring the faculty member by
