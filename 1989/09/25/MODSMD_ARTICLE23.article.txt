# Summer news highlights:
## From takeover carryover to spraying sprinklers 
### Elizabeth Howton Editorial staff 
Been gone all summer and
missed all the campus news? Not
to worry. Here are the highlights
of a fairly calm Stanford summer,
compiled from articles in The
Stanford Weekly (the summer
publication of The Stanford Daily)
and from Stanford University
News Service.

Noting that traditional Native
American religious beliefs hold an
cestral remains to be sacred,
Provost James Rosse announced
University plans to return the re
mains of about 550 Native Amer
icans to elders of the Ohlone-
Costanoan people. The decision
was earlier approved unanimously
by both the anthropology faculty
and a provost's advisory commit
tee on campus archaeology.
The Board of Trustees approved
"the concept" of demolishing 20
of the 116 aging Manzanita
trailers and replacing them with
a 200-person dormitory. Two
anonymous trustees also pledged
$2 million each toward the $10-
million project, and trustee Roy
Anderson agreed to match dollar
for-dollar the money raised by the
class of 1989, whose goal is
$50,000. Built in 1969 as "tem
porary emergency" housing, the
trailers were intended to be
removed in three to five years.
They celebrate their 20th anni
versary this fall.

After weeks of debate and de
liberation, 51 of the 53 students
charged with violating the Uni
versity's Policy on Campus Dis
ruption were sentenced by the
University to perform 75 hours
of community service work, Uni
versity President Donald Kennedy
announced. The students, who
were all involved in the May 15
occupation of Kennedy's office,
will also be on probation for one
year.
Participants in the office
takeover called for increased eth
nic studies and the hiring of a
professor to teach Asian-
American studies, among other
demands. Dean of Student Affairs
James Lyons said the University
would have no objection to the
protesters fulfilling their Univer
sity sentences and any county
imposed sentences concurrently.

Forty-seven of the students ar
rested in the takeover entered a
plea of no contest to the charge
of trespassing. District Attorney
Tom Farenholz dropped four other
charges, and Judge Stephen Man
ley indicated that the sentence will
be 40 hours of community service
and six months probation.
But because none Of the 47 ap
peared in court, Manley
postponed formal sentencing until
Oct. 6 because he wanted to speak
to the protesters in person. Man
ley also said the hours of commu
nity service must be counted
separately from the 75 hours of

community service imposed by the
University.
Four other students face the
more serious charge of "obstruct
ing a police officer in performing
a duty." They plan to enter their
pleag Oct. 6. Another student,
Louis Jackson, faces charges of
battery and inciting a riot, in ad
dition 1 to trespassing and obstruc
tion charges. Dan Barton, the
attorney for the students, said
that pressing the stricter charges
against the four students "is an
attempt to deflect attention from
Louis Jackson. They realized it
was politically unwise to single
out one black man."
Bert Gerow, Stanford professor
emeritus of anthropology, publicly
claimed ownership of hundreds of
Native American remains in an
effort to block University plans
to return them to descendants of
the Ohlone tribe. "These addi
tions were the direct result of my
research and teaching activities,"
Gerow said in a letter to Anthro
pology Chair James Gibbs.
Gibbs had the locks on the col
lection changed "to protect the
University's claim to the materials
until such time as ownership can
be formally determined."
An incriminating diary entry
led police to arrest 1988 Stanford
graduate James Ransom July 10
for the theft of approximately
$15,000 worth of University
owned computers. The diary pro
vided evidence that Ransom was
responsible for six computer bur
glaries in 1988, mostly from the
Hoover Institution.
The University received ap
proval for a revised general use
permit by a 6-0 vote of the Santa
Clara County Planning Commis
sion July 6. Five years in the
making, the permit includes a new
process for campus homeowners
and the University to resolve dis
putes. Expected to cover likely de

velopment through the year 2000,
the new permit would enable the
University to add 2.1 million
square feet of buildings and about
2,000 more people beyond previ
ously approved growth.
Officials for the Shrine of North
America announced plans to con
struct a $65 million medical fa
cility in Northern California at
either Stanford, UC-San Fran
cisco or UC-Davis. The Shrine is
a charitable and fraternal organ
ization that operates hospitals
specializing in burn treatment and
orthopedic medicine. Although
David Korn, vice president and
dean of the School of Medicine,
responded favorably to the pro

posal, no provisions for construc
tion of a new hospital were made
in Stanford's general use permit.
A University Sexual Assault
Task Force, initiated by the Rape
Education Project student group
and approved by Dean of Student
Affairs James Lyons in early May,
formed over the summer. Co
chaired by junior Suzanne
O'Brien and Health Promotion
Director Patricia Fabiano, the
task force also includes Director
of Residential Education Alice
Supton, Ombudsperson Leah
Kaplan, Asst. Director of Gradu
ate Residences Chris Griffith,
Stanford Police Chief Marv
Herrington and Alejandro Mar

tinez and Cathy Stevenson of
Cowell Student Health Center.
A faculty representative and
student members of REP,
Heighten Education on Acquaint
ance Rape and the Interfraternity
Council will make up the balance
of the committee, which will meet
at least four times per quarter
for 18 months to develop im
proved awareness of and re
sponses to rape on campus.
A search committee for an
Asian-American studies professor
was formed, pledging to begin its
search early this fall with the goal
of hiring the faculty member by

fall 1990. The search will be in
terdisciplinary, focusing mainly
on the humanities and social
sciences. University officials have
not yet determined into which de
partment or at what level the pro
fessor will be hired.
Gordon Chang, the University's
only Asian-American studies pro
fessor, left for UC-Irvine last year
after Stanford did not grant him
tenure. Asian-American student
groups have been pushing for a
replacement for him since then.

A group of American and Soviet
college students announced plans
for a joint magazine focusing on
Soviet and American student cul
ture, to be published beginning
in January 1990. Several of the
founders are Stanford students,
including former Daily staffer
Susan McKean.
Economics Prof. Donald Brown
will chair the newly created
Provost's Special Committee on
Faculty Recruitment and Reten
tion, the University announced.
The five-member committee, with
two additional ex-officio mem
bers, was created in response to
the April 5 report of the Univer
sity Committee on Minority Is
sues.
Tresidder Union began under
going some visible changes as the
Marriott Corp. moved out and
Bon Appetit and Stanford Book
store management moved in. Bon
Appetit took over the food services
in Tresidder, while the Bookstore
began running The Store, now

known as the Tresidder Express.
The Baker Street counter will
begin serving frozen yogurt and
deli foods, while the Corner
Pocket will focus exclusively on
pizza.
Later this year, the Tresidder
Express may move into the space
vacated by the Academic Informa
tion Resources computer cluster
and the Computer Science Depart
ment when they moved to the sec
ond floor. The Corner Pocket
would then move into the Store's
space. However, that plan has yet
to be finalized.
A nine-person Stanford re
search team led by Electrical En
gineering Prof. G. Leonard Tyler
participated in the Voyager 2
probe of Neptune and its moons
Aug. 25. Among the findings the
Stanford team reported were the
density, atmospheric composition
and surface temperature of
Triton, one of Neptune's moons.
None of this information was
before known.

A defective fire sprinkler that
probably ran for at least an hour
damaged books and contents of
study carrels on the second floor
of Green Library in the early
morning hours of Sept. 5. Prelim
inary damage was set at $15,000
by Robert Beth, the University's
risk management officer. At least
one computer in a carrel was com
pletely soaked, and an estimated
2,200 books were damaged. The
water covered about 8,000 square
feet of carpet to a depth of one
inch. About 200 of the most heav
ily wetted books are being freeze
dried in a "blast freezer" the
library purchased several years
ago after previous flooding inci
dents.

Appointments
Assoc. Dean of Graduate
Studies Cecilia Burciaga will
head up implementation of the re
forms proposed in last spring's
report of the University Commit
tee on Minority Issues. She will
serve as acting associate provost
and affirmative action officer for
1989-90.
Hoover Institution Deputy Di
rector John Raisian was named
acting director of the institution
June 21 while the search contin
ues for a successor to W. Glenn
Campbell, who retired Aug. 31.
Raisian is one of the candidates
for the permanent position.
Carol Hoerner, formerly of
Genentech Corp., was named
Stanford's first director of
environmental health and safety
July 3. The position was created
by University President Donald
Kennedy a year ago following an
extensive investigation of health
and safety procedures on campus.
The investigation was prompted
by a former employee's accusa
tions of widespread waste and
mismanagement in the areas of
health and safety.
Kenneth Bloem was named
president and chief executive of
ficer of Stanford University
Hospital, the University an
nounced Sept. 5. Bloem is cur
rently executive vice president and
chief operating officer of the Uni
versity of Chicago Hospitals, and
he will come to Stanford in the
late fall.
Departures
Former astronaut Sally Ride
cut short her fellowship at Stan
ford to become director of the Cal
ifornia Space Institute at UC-San
Diego July 1. She was also ap
pointed a UCSD physics professor.
Ride was the fourth prominent
scholar to leave Stanford's Center
for International Security and
Arms Control because of a dispute
over the center's inability to ap
point its own professors. Ride had
reportedly expressed interest in
becoming a Stanford professor.
After 17 years as dean of the
Graduate School of Business,
Robert Jaedicke resigned Aug. 1.

Under Jaedicke, the business
school increased its emphasis on
international aspects of manage
ment and revived the public man
agement program. Donations to
the school under Jaedicke reached
record levels.
Senior Hoover Fellow and Grad
uate School of Business Prof.
Henry Rowen took leave from
both his positions June 26 to be
come assistant secretary of de
fense in charge of international
affairs. Rowen had previously
served as a deputy assistant sec
retary of defense from 1961 to
1965. His duties at the Pentagon
will include building alliances, es
tablishing security systems and
planning for contingencies.
Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons will resign his post at the
end of the 1989-90 school year to
pursue independent research proj
ects. Lyons began his Stanford
career in 1972 after serving a 10-
year term as dean of students at
Haverford College in Pennsylva
nia. Since his arrival, he has im
plemented student and faculty
task forces on various issues and
created a dean's award for out
standing service.
Prof. Lorenz Eitner, chair of
the Art Department, retired Aug.

31 after 26 years at the Univer
sity. Eitner was responsible for
upgrading the previously un
ranked department to one of the
best in the nation. Assoc. Prof.
Wanda Corn has assumed the po
sition of Art Department chair.
Deaths
Sidney Hook, 86, a mtyor figure
in American intellectual history,
died July 12 of heart failure at
the Stanford Medical Center. A
senior research fellow at the Hoo
ver Institution, Hook came to
Stanford in 1973 following his
retirement from New York Uni
versity. Born in Brooklyn, N.Y.,
in 1902, Hook received his Ph.D.
in 1927 from Columbia Universi
ty, where he studied under phi
losopher John Dewey.
Dewey's philosophy of prag
matism — also associated with
philosophers C.S. Pierce and
William James — argues that the
validity of a concept should be
tested by examining its practical
results. Hook later became a
leading proponent of Dewey's
ideas. An outspoken opponent of
totalitarianism, Hook was

awarded the Presidential Medal of
Freedom in 1985.
William Shockley, 79, a co
inventor of the transistor and a
professor emeritus of electrical en
gineering, died Aug. 12 of prostate
cancer at his campus home. De
spite sharing the 1956 Nobel
Prize for physics with John Bar
deen and the late Walter Brattain,
Shockley may be better remem
bered for his views on race and
intelligence.
The later part of his life was
spent working on his studies of
genetics in an effort to prove his
hypothesis that intelligence is an
inherited trait and that whites are
more intelligent than blacks. His
racial theories were ridiculed by
many of his former scientific col
leagues.
Shockley, Bardeen and Brat
tain's first semiconductor device
made the electronic age possible,
paving the way for technology now
found in most modern devices, in
cluding wristwatches, airplanes,
calculators and cars. Shockley
Semiconductor Laboratories, the
company he founded after leaving
Bell Laboratories in 1954, was in
strumental in the birth of the
Silicon Valley.

Four other students face the
more serious charge of "obstruct

Louis Jackson, faces charges of
battery and inciting a riot, in ad
dition 1 to trespassing and obstruc

attorney for the students, said
that pressing the stricter charges
against the four students "is an
attempt to deflect attention from
Louis Jackson. They realized it
was politically unwise to single
out one black man."
Bert Gerow, Stanford professor
emeritus of anthropology, publicly
claimed ownership of hundreds of
Native American remains in an
effort to block University plans
to return them to descendants of

Stanford Weekly (the summer
publication of The Stanford Daily)
and from Stanford University
News Service.

Noting that traditional Native
American religious beliefs hold an

Provost James Rosse announced
University plans to return the re

was earlier approved unanimously
by both the anthropology faculty
and a provost's advisory commit

The Board of Trustees approved
"the concept" of demolishing 20
of the 116 aging Manzanita
trailers and replacing them with

After 17 years as dean of the
Graduate School of Business,
Robert Jaedicke resigned Aug. 1.

Under Jaedicke, the business
school increased its emphasis on
international aspects of manage

Deaths
Sidney Hook, 86, a mtyor figure
in American intellectual history,
died July 12 of heart failure at
the Stanford Medical Center. A
senior research fellow at the Hoo
ver Institution, Hook came to
Stanford in 1973 following his
retirement from New York Uni

in 1902, Hook received his Ph.D.
in 1927 from Columbia Universi
ty, where he studied under phi
losopher John Dewey.
Dewey's philosophy of prag
matism — also associated with
philosophers C.S. Pierce and
William James — argues that the
validity of a concept should be
tested by examining its practical
results. Hook later became a
leading proponent of Dewey's
ideas. An outspoken opponent of
totalitarianism, Hook was

awarded the Presidential Medal of
Freedom in 1985.
William Shockley, 79, a co
inventor of the transistor and a
professor emeritus of electrical en
gineering, died Aug. 12 of prostate
cancer at his campus home. De

Shockley may be better remem
bered for his views on race and
intelligence.
The later part of his life was

Been gone all summer and
missed all the campus news? Not
to worry. Here are the highlights
of a fairly calm Stanford summer,
compiled from articles in The
Stanford Weekly (the summer
publication of The Stanford Daily)
and from Stanford University
News Service.

Noting that traditional Native
American religious beliefs hold an
cestral remains to be sacred,
Provost James Rosse announced
University plans to return the re
mains of about 550 Native Amer
icans to elders of the Ohlone-
Costanoan people. The decision
was earlier approved unanimously
by both the anthropology faculty
and a provost's advisory commit
tee on campus archaeology.
The Board of Trustees approved
"the concept" of demolishing 20
of the 116 aging Manzanita
trailers and replacing them with
a 200-person dormitory. Two
anonymous trustees also pledged
$2 million each toward the $10-
million project, and trustee Roy
Anderson agreed to match dollar
for-dollar the money raised by the
class of 1989, whose goal is
$50,000. Built in 1969 as "tem
porary emergency" housing, the
trailers were intended to be
removed in three to five years.
They celebrate their 20th anni
versary this fall.

After weeks of debate and de
liberation, 51 of the 53 students
charged with violating the Uni
versity's Policy on Campus Dis
ruption were sentenced by the
University to perform 75 hours
of community service work, Uni
versity President Donald Kennedy
announced. The students, who
were all involved in the May 15
occupation of Kennedy's office,
will also be on probation for one
year.
Participants in the office
takeover called for increased eth
nic studies and the hiring of a
professor to teach Asian-
American studies, among other
demands. Dean of Student Affairs
James Lyons said the University
would have no objection to the
protesters fulfilling their Univer
sity sentences and any county
imposed sentences concurrently.

Forty-seven of the students ar
rested in the takeover entered a
plea of no contest to the charge
of trespassing. District Attorney
Tom Farenholz dropped four other
charges, and Judge Stephen Man
ley indicated that the sentence will
be 40 hours of community service
and six months probation.
But because none Of the 47 ap
peared in court, Manley
postponed formal sentencing until
Oct. 6 because he wanted to speak
to the protesters in person. Man
ley also said the hours of commu
nity service must be counted
separately from the 75 hours of

community service imposed by the
University.
Four other students face the
more serious charge of "obstruct
ing a police officer in performing
a duty." They plan to enter their
pleag Oct. 6. Another student,
Louis Jackson, faces charges of
battery and inciting a riot, in ad
dition 1 to trespassing and obstruc
tion charges. Dan Barton, the
attorney for the students, said
that pressing the stricter charges
against the four students "is an
attempt to deflect attention from
Louis Jackson. They realized it
was politically unwise to single
out one black man."
Bert Gerow, Stanford professor
emeritus of anthropology, publicly
claimed ownership of hundreds of
Native American remains in an
effort to block University plans
to return them to descendants of
the Ohlone tribe. "These addi
tions were the direct result of my
research and teaching activities,"
Gerow said in a letter to Anthro
pology Chair James Gibbs.
Gibbs had the locks on the col
lection changed "to protect the
University's claim to the materials
until such time as ownership can
be formally determined."
An incriminating diary entry
led police to arrest 1988 Stanford
graduate James Ransom July 10
for the theft of approximately
$15,000 worth of University
owned computers. The diary pro
vided evidence that Ransom was
responsible for six computer bur
glaries in 1988, mostly from the
Hoover Institution.
The University received ap
proval for a revised general use
permit by a 6-0 vote of the Santa
Clara County Planning Commis
sion July 6. Five years in the
making, the permit includes a new
process for campus homeowners
and the University to resolve dis
putes. Expected to cover likely de

velopment through the year 2000,
the new permit would enable the
University to add 2.1 million
square feet of buildings and about
2,000 more people beyond previ
ously approved growth.
Officials for the Shrine of North

Been gone all summer and
missed all the campus news? Not
to worry. Here are the highlights
of a fairly calm Stanford summer,
compiled from articles in The
Stanford Weekly (the summer
publication of The Stanford Daily)
and from Stanford University
News Service.

Noting that traditional Native
American religious beliefs hold an
cestral remains to be sacred,
Provost James Rosse announced
University plans to return the re
mains of about 550 Native Amer
icans to elders of the Ohlone-
Costanoan people. The decision
was earlier approved unanimously
by both the anthropology faculty
and a provost's advisory commit
tee on campus archaeology.
The Board of Trustees approved
"the concept" of demolishing 20
of the 116 aging Manzanita
trailers and replacing them with
a 200-person dormitory. Two
anonymous trustees also pledged
$2 million each toward the $10-
million project, and trustee Roy
Anderson agreed to match dollar
for-dollar the money raised by the
class of 1989, whose goal is
$50,000. Built in 1969 as "tem
porary emergency" housing, the
trailers were intended to be
removed in three to five years.
They celebrate their 20th anni
versary this fall.

After weeks of debate and de
liberation, 51 of the 53 students
charged with violating the Uni
versity's Policy on Campus Dis
ruption were sentenced by the
University to perform 75 hours
of community service work, Uni
versity President Donald Kennedy
announced. The students, who
were all involved in the May 15
occupation of Kennedy's office,
will also be on probation for one
year.
Participants in the office
takeover called for increased eth
nic studies and the hiring of a
professor to teach Asian-
American studies, among other
demands. Dean of Student Affairs
James Lyons said the University
would have no objection to the
protesters fulfilling their Univer
sity sentences and any county
imposed sentences concurrently.

Forty-seven of the students ar
rested in the takeover entered a
plea of no contest to the charge
of trespassing. District Attorney
Tom Farenholz dropped four other
charges, and Judge Stephen Man
ley indicated that the sentence will
be 40 hours of community service
and six months probation.
But because none Of the 47 ap
peared in court, Manley
postponed formal sentencing until
Oct. 6 because he wanted to speak
to the protesters in person. Man
ley also said the hours of commu
nity service must be counted
separately from the 75 hours of

community service imposed by the
University.
Four other students face the
more serious charge of "obstruct
ing a police officer in performing
a duty." They plan to enter their
pleag Oct. 6. Another student,
Louis Jackson, faces charges of
battery and inciting a riot, in ad
dition 1 to trespassing and obstruc
tion charges. Dan Barton, the
attorney for the students, said
that pressing the stricter charges
against the four students "is an
attempt to deflect attention from
Louis Jackson. They realized it
was politically unwise to single
out one black man."
Bert Gerow, Stanford professor
emeritus of anthropology, publicly
claimed ownership of hundreds of
Native American remains in an
effort to block University plans
to return them to descendants of
the Ohlone tribe. "These addi
tions were the direct result of my
research and teaching activities,"
Gerow said in a letter to Anthro
pology Chair James Gibbs.
Gibbs had the locks on the col
lection changed "to protect the
University's claim to the materials
until such time as ownership can
be formally determined."
An incriminating diary entry
led police to arrest 1988 Stanford
graduate James Ransom July 10
for the theft of approximately
$15,000 worth of University
owned computers. The diary pro
vided evidence that Ransom was
responsible for six computer bur
glaries in 1988, mostly from the
Hoover Institution.
The University received ap
proval for a revised general use
permit by a 6-0 vote of the Santa
Clara County Planning Commis
sion July 6. Five years in the
making, the permit includes a new
process for campus homeowners
and the University to resolve dis
putes. Expected to cover likely de

velopment through the year 2000,
the new permit would enable the
University to add 2.1 million
square feet of buildings and about
2,000 more people beyond previ
ously approved growth.
Officials for the Shrine of North
America announced plans to con
struct a $65 million medical fa
cility in Northern California at
either Stanford, UC-San Fran
cisco or UC-Davis. The Shrine is
a charitable and fraternal organ
ization that operates hospitals
specializing in burn treatment and
orthopedic medicine. Although
David Korn, vice president and
dean of the School of Medicine,
responded favorably to the pro

posal, no provisions for construc
tion of a new hospital were made
in Stanford's general use permit.
A University Sexual Assault
Task Force, initiated by the Rape
Education Project student group
and approved by Dean of Student
Affairs James Lyons in early May,
formed over the summer. Co
chaired by junior Suzanne
O'Brien and Health Promotion
Director Patricia Fabiano, the
task force also includes Director
of Residential Education Alice
Supton, Ombudsperson Leah
Kaplan, Asst. Director of Gradu
ate Residences Chris Griffith,
Stanford Police Chief Marv

ance Rape and the Interfraternity
Council will make up the balance
of the committee, which will meet
at least four times per quarter
for 18 months to develop im

was formed, pledging to begin its
search early this fall with the goal

after Stanford did not grant him
tenure. Asian-American student
groups have been pushing for a
replacement for him since then.

A group of American and Soviet
college students announced plans
for a joint magazine focusing on
Soviet and American student cul
ture, to be published beginning
in January 1990. Several of the
founders are Stanford students,
including former Daily staffer
Susan McKean.
Economics Prof. Donald Brown
