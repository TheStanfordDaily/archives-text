# Cajun Cannon, brave Brian key cool Cardinal comeback
## 
### Mark Rogowsky Senior staff writer 
Steve Smith didn't expect to play in
Saturday's game. He had been shaky in
two starts and wasn't even given a
chance to finish the Oregon State game
two weeks ago.

starting job — a decision no one argued
with.
Then Saturday arrived. Johnson was
asked to do the nearly impossible: lead
the 0-2 Cardinal past a superb Oregon
team with a particulary stingy defense
— a tall order considering Stanford had
managed to score but 19 points in its
first two weeks.
Several days earlier, Johnson learned
that he would be without his top rusher,
Jon Volpe. Stanford's number two back,
Charlie Young, was also injured. That
meant the Cardinal would have to put
the ball in the air early and often.
But Johnson would be doing the
throwing — all of it. Smith would watch
from the sidelines. In the early going,
Johnson was playing fairly well.
With newfound protection from the
offensive line, Johnson hit the open man
and moved Stanford up and down the
field. At least up to the Oregon 25 or
so. For some reason, whenever the Car
dinal threatened to cross the Duck 20-
yard line, it was as if the team was the
German army standing at the Maginot
Line — but they couldn't find a Belgium
to sneak through.
A holding penalty here, a sack there
and Stanford simply failed to punch it
in. While the defense did a solid job, it

appeared the Cardinal was headed for
a third straight loss.
The non-starters, Smith among them,
could do nothing but watch hopelessly
from the sidelines. With a second less
than nine minutes remaining, Oregon
punted the ball away and Stanford took
possession at its own 42.
Johnson brought the troops back onto
the field for what seemed like a go
through-the-motions, try-to-avoid-the
shutout, last-ditch effort. The first play
of the drive was a Scott Eschelman run
off left tackle. The portions of the crowd
that hadn't left yet must have given
serious thought to heading for the exits.
What was Green thinking? Was he
going to run out the clock?
The next play Johnson hooked up with
Walter Batson on a slant for a 30-yard
gain. Stanford was once again at the
Duck 25. A short pass and a incomple
tion put the Cardinal at the Oregon 21
— its deepest penetration of the game.
Johnson took the next snap, dropped
back and hit Gary Taylor, a third
stringer a week ago, in the flat. Taylor

stepped right, looked at Derek Horton
as if to say "See ya later, sucker,"
headed left and raced into the end zone.
On the Stanford sideline, spirits were
elevated. The defense took over and held
the Ducks to just a single first down.
After a decent punt return and a per
sonal foul, the Cardinal found itself at
the Oregon 39.

of possibility.
Four plays later, disaster struck.
Johnson was sacked and had to leave
the game. Smith, caught up in wave of
emotion, didn't get a chance to think
about the situation. He was about to
be sent in, ice cold, to perform a task
that even Randall Cunningham might
find impossible.
None of the pressures he faced
opening the season as a rookie starter.
No time to think about the things that
could go wrong — or have gone wrong.
Just go in there and run the offense,
like it's done in practice. No pressure,
just give us a miracle. Score 11 points
in three minutes and you're a hero.

man of two weeks ago, was suddenly

completion went for no gain before

for 11 yards to the Duck 28.
Afterwards, Smith appeared

down in the dumps to the top of
the world in 193 of the most
