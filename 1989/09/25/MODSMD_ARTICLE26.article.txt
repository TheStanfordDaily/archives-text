# Cardinal water polo pounces on Brown Invitational teams
## 
### Nat Cousins Editorial staff 
The East Coast may have more
culture and better luge runs, but
when it comes to water polo, the
West is definitely best.
Just one week after floundering
to a sixth-place finish in the Irvine
Tournament, the sixth-ranked
Stanford men's water polo team
went on a feeding frenzy in Rhode
Island this weekend, feasting on
the weak Atlantic competition in
the Brown Invitational Tourna
ment. Stanford breezed to the
title, posting a 6-0 record.
"We played the best teams from
the East and really showed the
domination of the West in water
polo," Coach Dante Dettamanti
said. "After a disappointing finish
in Irvine, we really got our game
together."
The Cardinal outscored oppo
nents 86-30 in the eight-team
tournament, ending an early
season offensive drought. Every
member on the squad scored in
the tournament, even goalkeeper
Todd Kemp. Stanford heads into
Friday's game at Fresno State
with a 13-3 mark.
"We came into the tournament
needing to work on offense," Det
tamanti said. "We really got things

Coach Dante Det
tamanti said. 'After a
disappointing finish
in Irvine, we really got
our game together;

on some things. It has been a
good time to travel, but now we
are anxious to get home."
The Cardinal sank five ranked
team* at Brown, including 12th
ranked Arkansas-Little Rock, the
team Dettamanti considers the
best east of the Rocky Mountains.
The Trojans, who folded 14-5 to
Stanford, finished second.
After bombing unranked ions
17-7, Stanford ripped 19th-ranked
Harvard 19-7 with three goals
each from Jeff Oeding, Colin
Keely and Greg Olson, and two
apiece from Rick McNair, Steve
Millham and Chuck Maguy.
Next on the firing line was
16th-ranked Massachusetts-

Amherst, as the Cardinal cruised
to a 21-5 victory with Millham
and Maguy netting three goals
each.
Dettamanti's men pulled out to
an 8-0 lead before beating
Arkansas-Little Rock 14-5.
Maguy, who tallied 13 goals in the
tournament, led the way with
three, while Oeding and Millham
each added a pair.
The Cardinal sunk lOth-ranked
Navy twice during its five-day,
seven-game trip. In a non-league
contest Thursday, the Cardinal
clobbered the Midshipmen 14-6.
During the tournament, Eric
Blum's three goals highlighted a
15-6 triumph.
Stanford concluded its eastern
swing by bombing Brown 14-7,
riding senior Greg Loos' four
goals.
Despite the Cardinal triumphs
in the pool, Stanford suffered a
defeat out of the water, falling
from first to sixth in the national
poll. California, which lost to
Stanford earlier in the season,
claimed the top spot, followed by
Irvine, USC and UCLA.
"We should be in the top four,"
said Dettamanti. "Pepperdine was
our only really bad loss."
After an alumni showdown Sat
urday, Stanford will battle eighth -
ranked UC-Santa Barbara.
