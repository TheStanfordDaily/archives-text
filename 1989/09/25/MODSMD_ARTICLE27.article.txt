# Women's soccer loses game, wins respect in Colorado
## 
### Chris Crader Editorial staff 
Never has a loss been such a
positive thing.
For the women's soccer team,
however, a 1-0 overtime loss to
third-ranked Colorado College in
Colorado Springs Saturday
showed just how far the team,
currently ranked seventh in the
nation, has come.
Stanford, 6-1, defeated Division
II power Cal State-Hayward 4-0
Sept. 15, Texas Christian 5-0
Sept. 17 and Northern Colorado
5-1 Thursday.
"It was excellent," Coach Ber
hane Andeberhan said of the
team's two-game swing through
Colorado. "I am absolutely
thrilled. ... It skyrocketed our
confidence."
Stanford nearly tied the Tigers,
except for a shaky goal with a
mere minute, 38 seconds remain
ing in overtime.
"We were a little tired there at
the end," Andeberhan said. "But
we were still going. The ball was
in our penalty box, in front of the
goal. Their player pushed the ball
with her hand intentionally. The
referee was screened and couldn't
see it.
"Two of our players stopped. I
guess they showed their inexperi
ence. That gave her the extra time
to score it.... The referee was
completely screened — you can't
blame him. We earned at least a
tie."
Stanford began the week at
Hayward, where the Cardinal took
it to the home team from start

If there's a better
team than
Colorado College,
I'd like to see it.

to finish. Freshman Julie Foudy
got Stanford on the board early,
scoring an unassisted goal 12
minutes into the game. Junio~
Jennifer Bloomer followed with
her first goal of the year on a
pass from Blair Elliott which
Elizabeth Joneschild redirected to
her in front of the goal.
Jennifer Rowland, the team's
leading scorer in 1988, tallied the
third goal, as Bloomer and Jones
child were credited with the as
sist. Junior Lisa Sime finished
the scoring. Sime had a
breakaway and was tripped in the
penalty box. She took the result
ing penalty kick and put it away
in the upper left-hand corner.
Stanford easily handled TCU at
Maloney Field as Rowland scored
twice on passes from Foudy.
Joneschild, Sime and freshman
Kirby Seale also scored with
Rowland, Joneschild, Seale and
Michelle Sullivan picking up as
sists.
Rowland notched her eighth
goal of the year less than eight
minutes into the Northern
Colorado game, but then some
thing new happened. For the first
time in 1989, the Cardinal was
scored against.
"The referee made one of his
six ridiculous calls," Andeberhan

said. "Nobody had any clue what
he was talking about. He awarded
them a free kick inside the
box. ... I talked to him after the
game, and I still didn't know what
he called. But we came right back
and scored."
Sime undertook that task,
taking a pass from Foudy and
beating the keeper. The Cardinal
tallied three more in the second
half as Foudy, Bloomer and
Rowland each scored. Freshman
Carolyn Einstein had two assists
in the game.
"Carolyn Einstein had a phe
nomenal game against Northern
Colorado," Andeberhan said. "She
was unbelievable.... She's been
a tremendous addition to the
team."
Despite the fact that Stanford
was playing without two of its top
players, freshman Jennifer Potok
and sophomore Heather Mclntyre,
the Cardinal played even with the
No. 3 Tigers. Potok, who scored
three goals in her first collegiate
game, sprained both her knee and
ankle two weeks ago. She played
a little but Andeberhan decided
it would be safer to keep her on
the bench. Mclntyre, an All-West
selection as a freshman last year,
has yet to play this year due to
an ankle sprain incurred the first
day of practice.
"If there's a better team than
Colorado College, I'd like to see
it," Andeberhan said. "Without
pulling out all the stops we were
dead even with them. .. . Three
great scoring chances for them.
Three great scoring chances for
us. I have nothing to complain

about."
The key for Stanford this year
has been its offensive punch. The
squad gave up a paltry 11 goals
in 19 games last year and the
defense and junior goalkeeper
Elise Edwards have played even
better this year as they have al
lowed only two goals in seven
games.
But with the addition of Foudy,

a U.S. national team player, to
the midfield, Stanford's attack
has blossomed, helping both by
scoring and by controlling the ball.
The most telling statistic is that
Rowland and Sime led the team
last year with nine and seven
goals, respectively. After only
seven games this year, Rowland
has nine goals and Foudy seven.
Stanford will continue on the

toughest schedule in school his
tory when the team travels south
to meet No. 15 Santa Clara Wed
nesday night. The Broncos just
defeated No. 2 North Carolina
State yesterday, but the Wolfpack
was without six of its top players
due to injury and illness. "It
should be a fun game," Andeber
han said. "They're a very good
team."

Colorado College, I'd like to see
it," Andeberhan said. "Without
pulling out all the stops we were
dead even with them. .. . Three
great scoring chances for them.
Three great scoring chances for
us. I have nothing to complain

about."
The key for Stanford this year
has been its offensive punch. The
squad gave up a paltry 11 goals
in 19 games last year and the
defense and junior goalkeeper
Elise Edwards have played even
better this year as they have al
lowed only two goals in seven
games.
But with the addition of Foudy,

a U.S. national team player, to
the midfield, Stanford's attack
has blossomed, helping both by
scoring and by controlling the ball.
The most telling statistic is that
Rowland and Sime led the team
last year with nine and seven
goals, respectively. After only
seven games this year, Rowland
has nine goals and Foudy seven.
Stanford will continue on the

toughest schedule in school his
tory when the team travels south
to meet No. 15 Santa Clara Wed
nesday night. The Broncos just
defeated No. 2 North Carolina
State yesterday, but the Wolfpack
was without six of its top players
due to injury and illness. "It
should be a fun game," Andeber
han said. "They're a very good
team."

Sophomore midfielder Elizabeth Joneschild evades a defender for the Stanford soccer team. The
Cardinal hooters lost to Colorado College, but remain a strong national contender.
Never has a loss been such a
positive thing.
For the women's soccer team,
however, a 1-0 overtime loss to
third-ranked Colorado College in
Colorado Springs Saturday
showed just how far the team,
currently ranked seventh in the
nation, has come.
Stanford, 6-1, defeated Division
II power Cal State-Hayward 4-0
Sept. 15, Texas Christian 5-0
Sept. 17 and Northern Colorado
5-1 Thursday.
"It was excellent," Coach Ber
hane Andeberhan said of the
team's two-game swing through
Colorado. "I am absolutely
thrilled. ... It skyrocketed our
confidence."
Stanford nearly tied the Tigers,
except for a shaky goal with a
mere minute, 38 seconds remain
ing in overtime.
"We were a little tired there at
the end," Andeberhan said. "But
we were still going. The ball was
in our penalty box, in front of the
goal. Their player pushed the ball
with her hand intentionally. The
referee was screened and couldn't
see it.
"Two of our players stopped. I
guess they showed their inexperi
ence. That gave her the extra time
to score it.... The referee was
completely screened — you can't
blame him. We earned at least a
tie."
Stanford began the week at
Hayward, where the Cardinal took
it to the home team from start

If there's a better
team than
Colorado College,
I'd like to see it.

to finish. Freshman Julie Foudy
got Stanford on the board early,
scoring an unassisted goal 12
minutes into the game. Junio~
Jennifer Bloomer followed with
her first goal of the year on a
pass from Blair Elliott which
Elizabeth Joneschild redirected to
her in front of the goal.
Jennifer Rowland, the team's
leading scorer in 1988, tallied the
third goal, as Bloomer and Jones
child were credited with the as
sist. Junior Lisa Sime finished
the scoring. Sime had a
breakaway and was tripped in the
penalty box. She took the result
ing penalty kick and put it away
in the upper left-hand corner.
Stanford easily handled TCU at
Maloney Field as Rowland scored
twice on passes from Foudy.
Joneschild, Sime and freshman
Kirby Seale also scored with
Rowland, Joneschild, Seale and
Michelle Sullivan picking up as
sists.
Rowland notched her eighth
goal of the year less than eight
minutes into the Northern
Colorado game, but then some
thing new happened. For the first
time in 1989, the Cardinal was
scored against.
"The referee made one of his
six ridiculous calls," Andeberhan

said. "Nobody had any clue what
he was talking about. He awarded
them a free kick inside the
box. ... I talked to him after the
game, and I still didn't know what
he called. But we came right back
and scored."
Sime undertook that task,
taking a pass from Foudy and
beating the keeper. The Cardinal
tallied three more in the second
half as Foudy, Bloomer and
Rowland each scored. Freshman
Carolyn Einstein had two assists
in the game.
"Carolyn Einstein had a phe
nomenal game against Northern
Colorado," Andeberhan said. "She
was unbelievable.... She's been
a tremendous addition to the
team."
Despite the fact that Stanford
was playing without two of its top
players, freshman Jennifer Potok
and sophomore Heather Mclntyre,
the Cardinal played even with the
No. 3 Tigers. Potok, who scored
three goals in her first collegiate
game, sprained both her knee and
ankle two weeks ago. She played
a little but Andeberhan decided
it would be safer to keep her on
the bench. Mclntyre, an All-West
selection as a freshman last year,
has yet to play this year due to
an ankle sprain incurred the first
day of practice.
"If there's a better team than
Colorado College, I'd like to see
it," Andeberhan said. "Without
pulling out all the stops we were
dead even with them. .. . Three
