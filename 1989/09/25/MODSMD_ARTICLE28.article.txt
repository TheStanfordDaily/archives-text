# Cardinal spikers stung by Huskers
## Asper's nagging injury, inexperienced passing slow Cardinal progress 
### David Earnest Senior staff writer 
After the Stanford women's vol
leyball team dominated at 18th
ranked Colorado State last Wed
nesday, the Cardinal entered last
weekend's Firs Tier Invitational in
Lincoln, Neb., with a 4-2 record
and a desire to correct its troubles
on offense. However, a nagging
back injury to senior setter Lara
Asper hampered Stanford's
highly-touted offense as the fifth
ranked Cardinal lost to No. 7 Ne
braska 15-11, 15-11, 11-15, 15-4
in the championship match of the
invitational on Saturday.
"It's like losing your starting
quarterback," Coach Don Shaw
said of Asper's injury. "When we
lost the second game, I didn't
think it was worth [keeping her
in the match]."
Shaw wants Asper well-rested
for Wednesday night's match
against No. 8 California. Asper's
availability for that match is un
certain, pending an examination
of her back today.
Without Asper's experienced
setting to guide the offense, Stan
ford struggled in the final two
games of the championship
match. Freshman Carrie
Feldman, who started for Asper
in a loss to Pacific Sept. 12 and
has been backing her up fre
quently, replaced Asper in the
third game but was unable to cure

the ills of the team's offense.
Freshman hitter Bev Oden and
sophomore hitter Kristin Klein led
the Cardinal attack with 12 kills
each. Oden's .310 hitting percent
age for the match brought her
season average to .376, the best
among Stanford's starters.
"Bev played pretty well," Shaw
said. "But we didn't play well
enough as a team to utilize her
fully."
Nebraska's Carla Baker led the
way for the 'Huskers with 14 kills
and only one error. Nebraska hit
.220 as a team to Stanford's .123.
"We struggled throughout the
whole weekend. We're still not
running on all cylinders right
now," Shaw said. "Nebraska is a
little further along than we are."
In the first match of the tour
nament Friday, Stanford appeared
to be firing up its powerful offense
as the team hit an impressive .400
in the first game and downed
Pittsburgh 15-2. In game two,
however, the offense generated a
meager .170 team hitting percent
age before recovering slightly, hit
ting .186 and .217 in the final
two games. Stanford dropped the
second game 15-10 but won the
match with 15-12 and 16-14 vic
tories.
The Cardinal then faced 11th
ranked Kentucky Saturday after
noon and advanced to the cham
pionship match by struggling back
from an 0-2 game deficit to defeat

'It's like losing
your starting quar
terback. When we
lost the second
game, I didn't think
it was worth [keep
ing her in the
match].'

the Wildcats 12-15, 9-15, 15-4, 15-
7, 15-13. Klein, last year's Pacific
10 Conference Freshman of the
Year, again led the team with 24
kills. Team captain Laura Olesen
added 23.
Stanford committed 34 team er
rors but was helped by dismal
hitting by the Wildcats, who could
only muster a .167 team hitting
percentage in the match's find
three games.
Asper played the full match
against Pittsburgh, but Feldman
and junior Karen Anderson
shared setting duties in the Ken
tucky match, with Anderson back
ing up Feldman.
Stanford started last week's

road trip by traveling to Colorado
State's Moby Gym to face the 5-4
Lady Rams. Asper's back spasms
did not bother her as she set every
point and led the Cardinal to a
three-game sweep of Colorado
State, 15-11, 15-13, 15-11. Oden
again was the offensive star, hit
ting .478 and helping the team
overcome an off-day by Klein, who
committed seven errors and hit
only .045.
Stanford enters the thick of its
Pacific 10 Conference schedule
this week, beginning with a match
in Berkeley Wednesday. Stanford
has won its only two conference
matches thusfar, beating Wash
ington and Washington State last
week. California has raced to 9-1
this season and will be the first
challenge of a demanding confer
ence schedule.
Card notes
Stanford's defeat of Washington on
Sept. 16 avenged last year's upset loss
to the Huskies in the NCAA playoffs.
Klein and Cooper led the Cardinal,
hitting .406 and .481 respectively. The
previous night, Oden served three aces
and tallied seven kills to down Wash
ington State.
Along with Asper, sophomore hitter
Nicole Appleman and junior hitter
Cheryl Conly have been slowed by
injuries. Appleman is nursing a
sprained ankle and Conly is expected
to return soon from a broken wrist
suffered in preseason camp.

State, 15-11, 15-13, 15-11. Oden

overcome an off-day by Klein, who
committed seven errors and hit
only .045.

Pacific 10 Conference schedule

After the Stanford women's vol
leyball team dominated at 18th
ranked Colorado State last Wed
nesday, the Cardinal entered last
weekend's Firs Tier Invitational in
Lincoln, Neb., with a 4-2 record
and a desire to correct its troubles
on offense. However, a nagging
back injury to senior setter Lara
Asper hampered Stanford's
highly-touted offense as the fifth
ranked Cardinal lost to No. 7 Ne
braska 15-11, 15-11, 11-15, 15-4
in the championship match of the
invitational on Saturday.
"It's like losing your starting
quarterback," Coach Don Shaw
said of Asper's injury. "When we
lost the second game, I didn't
think it was worth [keeping her
in the match]."
Shaw wants Asper well-rested
for Wednesday night's match
against No. 8 California. Asper's
availability for that match is un
certain, pending an examination
of her back today.
Without Asper's experienced
setting to guide the offense, Stan
ford struggled in the final two
games of the championship
match. Freshman Carrie
Feldman, who started for Asper
in a loss to Pacific Sept. 12 and
has been backing her up fre
quently, replaced Asper in the
third game but was unable to cure

the ills of the team's offense.
Freshman hitter Bev Oden and
sophomore hitter Kristin Klein led
the Cardinal attack with 12 kills
each. Oden's .310 hitting percent
age for the match brought her
season average to .376, the best
among Stanford's starters.
"Bev played pretty well," Shaw
said. "But we didn't play well
enough as a team to utilize her
fully."
Nebraska's Carla Baker led the
way for the 'Huskers with 14 kills
and only one error. Nebraska hit
.220 as a team to Stanford's .123.
"We struggled throughout the
whole weekend. We're still not
running on all cylinders right
now," Shaw said. "Nebraska is a
little further along than we are."
In the first match of the tour
nament Friday, Stanford appeared
to be firing up its powerful offense
as the team hit an impressive .400
in the first game and downed
Pittsburgh 15-2. In game two,
however, the offense generated a
meager .170 team hitting percent
age before recovering slightly, hit
ting .186 and .217 in the final
two games. Stanford dropped the
second game 15-10 but won the
match with 15-12 and 16-14 vic
tories.
The Cardinal then faced 11th
ranked Kentucky Saturday after
noon and advanced to the cham
pionship match by struggling back
from an 0-2 game deficit to defeat

'It's like losing
your starting quar
terback. When we
lost the second
game, I didn't think
it was worth [keep
ing her in the
match].'

the Wildcats 12-15, 9-15, 15-4, 15-
7, 15-13. Klein, last year's Pacific
10 Conference Freshman of the
Year, again led the team with 24
kills. Team captain Laura Olesen
added 23.
Stanford committed 34 team er
rors but was helped by dismal
hitting by the Wildcats, who could
only muster a .167 team hitting
percentage in the match's find
three games.
Asper played the full match
against Pittsburgh, but Feldman
and junior Karen Anderson
shared setting duties in the Ken
tucky match, with Anderson back
ing up Feldman.
Stanford started last week's

road trip by traveling to Colorado
State's Moby Gym to face the 5-4
Lady Rams. Asper's back spasms
did not bother her as she set every
point and led the Cardinal to a
three-game sweep of Colorado
State, 15-11, 15-13, 15-11. Oden
again was the offensive star, hit
