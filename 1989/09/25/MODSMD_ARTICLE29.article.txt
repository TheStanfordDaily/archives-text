# Booters battle rain, beat Old Dominion

### John Louie Staff writer 
Rain and high winds
prompted cancellation of the
men's soccer game at Hartford
College yesterday. Over the
weekend, however, the Cardi
nal improved its season record
to 3-4-1 with a 2-1 win over
Old Dominion.
Sophomore midfielder Rhett
Harty, Stanford's leading
scorer last year, led the attack
with one goal. Freshman for
ward Lance Killian also scored
for the Cardinal.
Following a 2-0 loss to UN
LV, the win over Old Dominion
boosted Stanford's record to 1-1
on the current road trip.
Despite losing six seniors and
having one of the toughest
schedules in the nation, Coach
Sam Koch still believes 1989
can be a fruitful year. "We will

be young but our juniors and
sophomores are very steady
and consistent," Koch said.
"They can be counted on. We
also had a good recruiting
season and some freshmen
have a chance of making an
immediate impact."
"This is definitely our tough
est schedule ever, and it will
be a great challenge," he added.
In Sept., the team posted a
3-0 win over UC-Davis and a
7-0 triumph over San Jose
State. Besides the loss to UN
LV, Stanford has fallen to In
diana 2-0, Seton Hall 3-2, and
Cal Poly SLO 3-0. The 2-2 tie
came against Fresno State.
The team squares off against
Harvard Wednesday in Boston.
The road trip ends Sept. 30
against North Texas State.
The next home game is
scheduled for Oct. 14 against
Illinois State at 2 p.m.
