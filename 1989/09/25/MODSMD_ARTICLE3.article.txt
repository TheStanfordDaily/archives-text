# University price-fixing probe
## Feds investigating Stanford 
### Amy Rosenfeld Editorial staff 
While Stanford is one of the
latest schools to be investigated
by a U.S. Department of Justice
probe into a possible price-fixing
scheme, top University officials
said they do not expect Stanford
to be implicated in any antitrust
charges.
The Justice Department is in
vestigating allegations that
several top universities and col
leges are violating antitrust laws
by exchanging information on tui
tion, salaries and financial aid
packages before they are set.
On Sept. 12, Stanford and the
University of Southern California
became the first West Coast
schools to receive a civil investi
gative demand from the govern
ment. The demand asks for
detailed financial information
dating back to 1985.
According to a survey published
in The Chronicle of Higher Edu
cation, at least 40 schools — most
in the Northeast — have received
similar requests.
University Vice President and

General Counsel John Schwartz
said Stanford administrators were
"not surprised" when the request
arrived. "If the Justice Depart
ment is going to look into . ..
major universities, you're boun<l
to get around to those that are
on the West Coast," he said.
Schwartz added that he does
not anticipate "any liability by the
University whatsoever."
Twenty-three of the schools un
der investigation belong to the
Overlap Group, an organization
of selective institutions that
meets regularly to discuss tuition,
salaries and financial aid.
Stanford has "explicitly
refused" to join this group,
Schwartz said, adding that the
University has a policy dating
back to the early 1980s that for
bids the sharing of information
with other schools before prices
are set.
Although there is nothing un
lawful about exchanging informa
tion, there is a fine line between
simply sharing facts and exchang
ing them for the purpose of for
malizing an agreement or an un
derstanding between institutions,

'I don't think the
exchange serves
much of a useful
purpose.'
— John Schwartz

Schwartz explained.
"We didn't even want to start
down the road" toward possible
price-fixing situations, he said.
According to Vice President and
Provost James Rosse, the policy
reflects a "concern on our part
that we be clear of suspicion of
attempting to influence" other in
stitutions. Similar policies are
common among industrial and
commerical enterprises, he said.
The Overlap Group claims its
actions are designed to prevent
bidding wars for top students by
offering similar tuition and finan
cial aid packages, thus leading
students to choose an institution
on the basis of merit and not cost.
But both Schwartz and Rosse
said they do not see Stanford at
a disadvantage because it is not
involved in this group's discus
sions.
"I don't think the exchange
serves much of a useful purpose,"
Schwartz said.
While Schwartz stressed that
Stanford has nothing to fear from
the probe, he said difficulty will
arise in gathering the great
amount of information the Justice
Department has requested.
The original request included a
Sept. 28 deadline for supplying
the documents and information,
a deadline which Schwartz said
will be impossible to meet.
Schwartz and other University
representatives will confer with
Justice Department officials this
week to determine a "realistic
time frame" for gathering the in
formation, he said.
The most important decision of
ficials face is determining the

scope of the government's inquiry,
because the wording in the re
quest is very broad, Schwartz
said. "We think we know what
they want and we think that it's
not as broad as how it's worded,"
he said.
The demand includes requests
for internal memos, telephone
records, appointment books, travel
vouchers and expense account
records. So far, the University has
just begun to determine where
the information is and how much
exists, Schwartz said. "We're get
ting together a long, long list . ..
without even trying to look at"
the documents yet, he said,
In a related incident, a Wesleyan
University student recently filed
suit against Wesleyan and 11
other schools, including Stanford,
for sharing information and con
spiring to fix tuition rates.
Schwartz said he is aware of
the charge, but is not "sitting
around worrying about it" since
Stanford has yet to be served with
a complaint. There are many suits
filed against Stanford that never
get served, he said, adding that,
similar to the government inves
tigation, this suit is "not valid in
respect to Stanford."

probe into a possible price-fixing
scheme, top University officials
said they do not expect Stanford
to be implicated in any antitrust
charges.
The Justice Department is in
vestigating allegations that
several top universities and col
leges are violating antitrust laws
by exchanging information on tui
tion, salaries and financial aid
packages before they are set.
On Sept. 12, Stanford and the
University of Southern California
became the first West Coast
schools to receive a civil investi
gative demand from the govern
ment. The demand asks for
detailed financial information
dating back to 1985.
According to a survey published
in The Chronicle of Higher Edu
cation, at least 40 schools — most
in the Northeast — have received
similar requests.
University Vice President and

General Counsel John Schwartz
said Stanford administrators were
"not surprised" when the request
arrived. "If the Justice Depart
ment is going to look into . ..
major universities, you're boun<l
to get around to those that are
on the West Coast," he said.
Schwartz added that he does
not anticipate "any liability by the
University whatsoever."
Twenty-three of the schools un
der investigation belong to the
Overlap Group, an organization
of selective institutions that
meets regularly to discuss tuition,
salaries and financial aid.
Stanford has "explicitly
refused" to join this group,
Schwartz said, adding that the
University has a policy dating
back to the early 1980s that for
bids the sharing of information
with other schools before prices
are set.
Although there is nothing un
lawful about exchanging informa
tion, there is a fine line between
simply sharing facts and exchang
ing them for the purpose of for
malizing an agreement or an un
derstanding between institutions,

'I don't think the
exchange serves
much of a useful
purpose.'

Schwartz explained.
"We didn't even want to start
down the road" toward possible
price-fixing situations, he said.
According to Vice President and
Provost James Rosse, the policy
reflects a "concern on our part
that we be clear of suspicion of
attempting to influence" other in
stitutions. Similar policies are
common among industrial and
commerical enterprises, he said.
The Overlap Group claims its
actions are designed to prevent
bidding wars for top students by
offering similar tuition and finan
cial aid packages, thus leading
students to choose an institution
on the basis of merit and not cost.
But both Schwartz and Rosse
said they do not see Stanford at
a disadvantage because it is not
involved in this group's discus
sions.
"I don't think the exchange
serves much of a useful purpose,"
Schwartz said.
While Schwartz stressed that
Stanford has nothing to fear from
the probe, he said difficulty will
arise in gathering the great
amount of information the Justice
Department has requested.
The original request included a
Sept. 28 deadline for supplying
the documents and information,
a deadline which Schwartz said
will be impossible to meet.
Schwartz and other University
representatives will confer with
Justice Department officials this
week to determine a "realistic
time frame" for gathering the in
formation, he said.
The most important decision of
ficials face is determining the

scope of the government's inquiry,
because the wording in the re
quest is very broad, Schwartz
said. "We think we know what
they want and we think that it's
not as broad as how it's worded,"
he said.
The demand includes requests
for internal memos, telephone
records, appointment books, travel
vouchers and expense account
records. So far, the University has
just begun to determine where
the information is and how much
exists, Schwartz said. "We're get
ting together a long, long list . ..
without even trying to look at"
the documents yet, he said,
In a related incident, a Wesleyan
University student recently filed
suit against Wesleyan and 11
other schools, including Stanford,
for sharing information and con
spiring to fix tuition rates.
Schwartz said he is aware of
the charge, but is not "sitting
around worrying about it" since
Stanford has yet to be served with
a complaint. There are many suits
filed against Stanford that never
get served, he said, adding that,
similar to the government inves
tigation, this suit is "not valid in
respect to Stanford."
