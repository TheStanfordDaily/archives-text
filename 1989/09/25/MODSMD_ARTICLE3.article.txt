# University price-fixing probe
## Feds investigating Stanford 
### Amy Rosenfeld Editorial staff 
While Stanford is one of the
latest schools to be investigated
by a U.S. Department of Justice
probe into a possible price-fixing
scheme, top University officials
said they do not expect Stanford
to be implicated in any antitrust
charges.
The Justice Department is in
vestigating allegations that
several top universities and col
leges are violating antitrust laws
by exchanging information on tui
tion, salaries and financial aid
packages before they are set.
On Sept. 12, Stanford and the
University of Southern California
became the first West Coast
schools to receive a civil investi
gative demand from the govern
ment. The demand asks for
detailed financial information
dating back to 1985.
According to a survey published
in The Chronicle of Higher Edu
cation, at least 40 schools — most
in the Northeast — have received
similar requests.
University Vice President and

General Counsel John Schwartz
said Stanford administrators were
"not surprised" when the request
arrived. "If the Justice Depart
ment is going to look into . ..
major universities, you're boun<l
to get around to those that are
on the West Coast," he said.
Schwartz added that he does
not anticipate "any liability by the
University whatsoever."
Twenty-three of the schools un
der investigation belong to the
Overlap Group, an organization
of selective institutions that
meets regularly to discuss tuition,
salaries and financial aid.
Stanford has "explicitly
refused" to join this group,
Schwartz said, adding that the
University has a policy dating
back to the early 1980s that for
bids the sharing of information
with other schools before prices
are set.
Although there is nothing un
lawful about exchanging informa
tion, there is a fine line between
simply sharing facts and exchang
ing them for the purpose of for
malizing an agreement or an un
derstanding between institutions,

'I don't think the
exchange serves
much of a useful
purpose.'

Schwartz explained.
"We didn't even want to start
down the road" toward possible
price-fixing situations, he said.
According to Vice President and
Provost James Rosse, the policy
reflects a "concern on our part
that we be clear of suspicion of
attempting to influence" other in
stitutions. Similar policies are
common among industrial and
commerical enterprises, he said.
The Overlap Group claims its
actions are designed to prevent
bidding wars for top students by
offering similar tuition and finan
cial aid packages, thus leading
