# 'Renaissance': Reinforced against quakes, renovated Roble reopens
## 
### Jonathan Eisenberg Editorial staff 
Above the main entrance are
the words "Roble Hall Renais
sance." Students have revived res
idential life in Roble for the first
time in two years, after construc
tion workers renovated the old
dormitory.
Roble was closed in December
1987 when a study revealed that
the building was seismically un
stable. Since then, workers have
been erecting concrete towers
around some of the rooms to brace
the structure as well as upgrading
some of the facilities.
Along with a fresh coat of paint
and new room carpeting, the 80-
year-old dorm now boasts a more
elaborate recreation room, a big
ger dining area, an open kitchen
to complement University Food
Service and a stairway to connect
the "penthouse" in the A-wing to
the main building.
The electrical, plumbing and
fire alarm systems have been
upgraded, ceiling sprinkler sys
tems and more fire exits installed,
and front entrance ramps for first
floor handicapped access con
structed.
"The place is definitely spruced
up ... It looks brighter," said Ann
Porteus, who returns to Roble
with her husband Evan as resi
dent fellows.
Project Manager Jonathan
Ryan, who brought in the $7.3

million job "real close" to budget
and almost on schedule, said that
a crew of three to five constmc
tion workers will remain at Roble
for one more week to add the
finishing touches.
Residents have been reporting
some minor problems that need
to be corrected, such as closet
space blocked by newly installed
pipes and water pressure in the
C-wing too low for showers. Also,
some new telephone jacks do not
work.
Roble is the first Stanford dorm
to have a phone service allowing
residents to make long distance
calls on any phone in the system
with a personal access code. Res
idents are also able to call other
numbers in the system, including
many University facilities as well
as faculty and staff, by dialing
only the last five digits.
Workers also found some unex
pected problems during the reno
vation, such as asbestos insulation
around the original plumbing. As
a result of the additional work
required, the county fire marshal
and county health director only
granted their approval for the
reopening on Sept. 11 instead of
the scheduled Sept. 1.
Some of the resident assistants
had already arrived Sept. 10, ex
pecting to move in. They spent
the night in Ujamaa House in
stead of Roble, and workers later
moved the RAs' belongings into
Roble.

Workers also
found some unex
pected problems
during the renova
tion.

However, consulting architect
Michael Willis had deemed the job
"substantially complete" by the
contract deadline of Sept. 1. The
contractor was Overaa Construc
tion Company.
Ryan characterized the 270
days of construction as a "push
all along," with many workers
putting in overtime.
Nevertheless, the cost of the
renovation was about one-third
the cost of building a new dorm,
Ryan said.
William Magill, senior building
inspector for Santa Clara County,
oversaw the improvements in the
facilities and called them "100
percent better than before."
Ryan said he hoped that Roble
is "revitalized to a point where it
will be (in good condition) for an
other 80 years."
Meanwhile, head RA Dante
Rodriguez predicted that this year
will see Roble as a center of
campus social life because stu
dents will want to see the dorm's
new features.

Orientation volunteers welcome arriving students to a renovated, seismically sound Roble Hall last
week. Closed nearly two years for a $7.3 million earthquake-proofing project, the 80-year-old dorm
reopened just ten days after the estimated completion date. Though the major work is finished, some
lingering problems are still being worked out.
