# Cardinal comeback quashes Ducks, 18-17
## 
### Chris Crader Editorial staff 
Coach Denny Green must have
told his troops not to fire until
they saw the whites of their op
ponent's eyes.
"I kept looking in people's eyes
and nobody had a look of sur
render," said safety Tony Trous
set about the Cardinal, as they
overcame a 17-point deficit to
stun Oregon 18-17. "The Oregon
players looked like they were
trying not to lose instead of trying
to win. I saw that look . . . and
it's like an animal, you close in
for the kill."
After missing his first three
field goals of the game, John Hop
kins hit a 37-yarder with no time
remaining to give Stanford a
thrilling 18-17 win over Oregon
at Stanford Stadium Saturday.
The Cardinal, 1-2 overall and
1-2 in the Pacific 10 Conference,
trailed 17-0 with less than eight
minutes remaining in the game
but staged one of the most im
probable rallies in recent memory
to beat the 23rd-ranked Ducks on
the final play of the game.
Oregon fell to 2-1 overall, 1-1
in the Pac-10.
"The thing I'm most proud of
is that we went against a good
team that was playing well and
we hung in there," Green said
after his first win here. "Our guys
had a little more fortitude and
hung in there."
Despite playing most of the

game without three of the team's
top running backs and the last
few minutes without starting
quarterback Brian Johnson, the
Cardinal offense hit the Ducks for
414 yards of total offense. Before
Saturday, Stanford was averaging
228.5 yards per game, last in the
Pac-10.
Jon Volpe, a 1,000-yard rusher
last year, missed the game due to
a knee injury incurred earlier in
the week. Charlie Young,
projected as Volpe's backfield
mate, also did not suit up, having
reii\jured his knee a week ago. He
has yet to play a down this year
and could be out for the season.
Things appeared to be going al
right, however, when redshirt
freshman Jay Jay Lasley ran for
36 yards on his first four carries
of the game. Lasley displayed both
power and quickness, but
sprained his knee on his fourth
run and was lost for the day after
carrying a Duck defender six
yards.
Quarterback Brian Johnson's
passing and fullback Scott Eschel
man's running and receiving kept
the offense going, however, and
the Cardinal's young offensive line
played what was clearly its best
game of the season.
Both teams moved the ball well
between the 30s but neither got
into the end zone. Hopkins had
chances from 49 and 42 yards but
missed both. Gregg McCallum
missed a 49-yarder for the Ducks.


K®n Bear — Daily
Teammates storm John Hopkins after his game-winning 37-yard field goal. He had missed his previous five tries.
Hopkins said he planted his right foot
too far forward on the first one. The second
appeared to be tipped at the line, dying
right before the crossbar.
Early in the second quarter, Oregon
quarterback Bill Musgrave heated up as
he beat a seven-man blitz by flipping the
ball to fullback Dondre Bausley in the flat.
With part of the Cardinal defense blitzing
and part in single coverage deep down the
field, Bausley had a lot of green in front
of him and flew 41 yards to Stanford's 22.
The Ducks got on the board the very
next play as Musgrave threw his seventh
touchdown pass of the young season to an
open Terry Obee in the back of the end
zone. Musgrave was not as lucky when he
faked the point-after attempt, as free safety
Tony Trousset was in tight coverage on
Ngalu Kelemeni in the end zone, forcing
Musgrave to throw the ball away.
A few minutes later Air Musgrave struck
again. On third-and-18 from his own 33,
Musgrave hit Tony Hargain over the
middle. Hargain, cornerback Tuan Van Le
and Trousset had a big collision, but Har
gain held on for a 40-yard gainer.
Two plays later Musgrave hit Obee in
the end zone. Musgrave rolled right on the
point-after play and threw back across his
body to hit Hargain for two more. Stanford
could do nothing in the final 37 seconds
of the first half and went into the locker
room trailing 14-0.
"At halftime we (the defense) got a pretty
good chewing," Trousset said. "It was well
deserved. We just decided to buckle down
and play"
The defense was on fire in the third
quarter, holding the Ducks to minus one
yard of offense through their first three
drives.
Stanford's offense did nothing to close
the gap, however, as Johnson threw his
second interception of the game, both to
cornerback Chris Oldham.
On the Cardinal's other drives, Hopkins
missed a 42-yarder due, in part, to a high
snap, and the Cardinal went three downs
and punted.
But the Cardinal defense kept plugging
away, hoping that the tide would eventually
turn for the offense. "I have faith in them,"
inside linebacker Jono Tunney said. "The
only thing we can do is do our job."
Hinckley agreed. "You gotta put your
trust in the offense," he said. "They put
their trust in us. We know they can do it?
This whole year we've known they can do
it. This time they did it."
But before they did it, the Ducks put
three more points on the board. Musgrave,
Bausley and Derek Loville moved the ball
into field goal range at the start of the
fourth quarter, and when McCallum hit a
28-yarder, it was 17-0.
After a pair of punts, the Cardinal offense
got rolling. Johnson hit Walter Batson on
a slant pattern for 30 yards. Two plays
later, Johnson hit halfback Gary Taylor in
the flat. Taylor faked inside, ran outside
and coasted into the end zone, putting Stan
ford on the board with 7:19 remaining.
The Hopkins PAT cut the score to 17-7.
The Cardinal defense held Oregon to one
first down and then Alan Grant returned
an ensuing Penso punt 15 yards. A late hit
of Grant gave Stanford 15 more yards,
placing the pigskin on the Duck 39 with
4:33 to play.
Johnson hit tight end Jim Price for eight.
After an incompletion, he hit Eschelman
for seven more and the first down. Johnson
was back to pass again from the 24, but
an Andre Williams sack cost the Cardinal
seven yards and knocked a battered
Johnson out of the game with a shoulder
injury. Redshirt freshman Steve Smith,
who was shaky in starting the first two
games, came in to continue the drive.
"I stayed in the game (mentally) the

whole time," Smith said. "Brian first got
hurt in the second quarter. ... I tried to
stay up and be ready for the game. I knew
I could be in there at any time."
Facing a second-and-17 situation, Smith
dropped back to pass. He found no one
open, but scrambled 11 yards to escape the
rush. He found Batson for 14 on the next
play, moving the ball to the seven and
giving him a first down with 1:37 remain
ing.
He hit Eschelman for two, then found
tight end Turner Baur in the flat for what
looked like six. Oldham made a key tackle,
however, keeping Baur a foot from the end
zone. Smith snuck the ball over on the
next play.
Green elected to go for two and Smith
rolled out and found a leaping Eschelman
in the back of the end zone to cut the
margin to 17-15 with 1:11 to play.
Stanford lined up eight guys to Hopkins'
left on the kickoff and Hopkins executed
a perfect onside kick. The ball took two
small hops then jumped up into the air. A
Duck reached for it but Jimmy Klein, Vince
Otoupal and a host of Cardinal specialists
crushed all the Oregon players in the area
and Cory Booker was able to pull the ball
down.
"The kick was perfect," Hinckley said.
"I mean I'm no expert — I'm a linebacker.
But as I'm sitting there on the sidelines,
I'm thinking, 'This has to be a perfect
kick.' When the kick was there, we knew
we had it."
With the remaining members of the
35,000-person crowd watching in gleeful
disbelief, Stanford had the ball on its own
49. Smith then took over again. During his
senior year at Covington High School in
Folsom, La., Smith led his team 98 yards
in two minutes for a come-from-behind
win in the state semifinals, throwing an
11-yard TD pass with five seconds left.
The following week, in the state finals, he
led a 70-yard drive in the last two minutes
and finished with a TD pass on fourth
and-25 for a one-point win.
The Cfyun Cannon did it again Saturday.
He hit Batson for 12 to get the ball to the
Oregon 39. Then, he found Eschelman for
no gain and threw to Price for 11. He
missed a diving Jon Pinckney over the
middle on the next play, but the Ducks
were offside, and the five-yard penalty took
Stanford to the 23 with 40 ticks left.
Smith ran a quarterback sneak for three
yards to get the ball in the middle of the
field* ami the Cardinal ran the clock down
fo fwe seconds before expending its last
time out.
Hopkins, who had missed five straight
field goals over the past two games, went
onto the field, but Oregon called a time
out to try to ice him.
"I went back to the sideline, kneeled
down and prayed," Hopkins said. "I was
calm. ... I felt pretty good. ... As I went
out, I said, 'This is the moment I've been
waiting for all my life.'"
The kick went through the uprights, the
clock showed 00:00 and Stanford had its
first win of the year.
Smith finished a perfect 6-for-6 for 42
yards and he and Johnson combined for
312 yards through the air while completing
two-thirds of their passes. Eschelman had
10 catches for 29 yards and ran 11 times
for 50 more yards — his best game as a
collegian.
For the Ducks, Musgrave threw for 213
yards, but he never really hurt the Cardi
nal. The Oregon ground game averaged a
paltry 2.2 yards per carry and Stanford
held the Duck offense to 68 yards in the
second half.
Card notes
True freshman Paul Stonehouse made his
debut as a Cardinal, handling all the punting
duties against Oregon. The high school Ail-
American kicked four times for a 30.5-yard
average.
