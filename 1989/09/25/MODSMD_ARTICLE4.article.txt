# Cardinal comeback quashes Ducks, 18-17

Coach Denny Green must have
told his troops not to fire until
they saw the whites of their op
ponent's eyes.
"I kept looking in people's eyes
and nobody had a look of sur
render," said safety Tony Trous
set about the Cardinal, as they
overcame a 17-point deficit to
stun Oregon 18-17. "The Oregon
players looked like they were
trying not to lose instead of trying
to win. I saw that look . . . and
it's like an animal, you close in
for the kill."
After missing his first three
field goals of the game, John Hop
kins hit a 37-yarder with no time
remaining to give Stanford a
thrilling 18-17 win over Oregon
at Stanford Stadium Saturday.
The Cardinal, 1-2 overall and
1-2 in the Pacific 10 Conference,
trailed 17-0 with less than eight
minutes remaining in the game
but staged one of the most im
probable rallies in recent memory
to beat the 23rd-ranked Ducks on
the final play of the game.
Oregon fell to 2-1 overall, 1-1
in the Pac-10.
"The thing I'm most proud of
is that we went against a good
team that was playing well and
we hung in there," Green said
after his first win here. "Our guys
had a little more fortitude and
hung in there."
Despite playing most of the

game without three of the team's
top running backs and the last
few minutes without starting
quarterback Brian Johnson, the
Cardinal offense hit the Ducks for
414 yards of total offense. Before
Saturday, Stanford was averaging
228.5 yards per game, last in the
Pac-10.
Jon Volpe, a 1,000-yard rusher
last year, missed the game due to
a knee injury incurred earlier in
the week. Charlie Young,
projected as Volpe's backfield
mate, also did not suit up, having
reii\jured his knee a week ago. He
has yet to play a down this year
and could be out for the season.
Things appeared to be going al
right, however, when redshirt
freshman Jay Jay Lasley ran for
36 yards on his first four carries
of the game. Lasley displayed both
power and quickness, but
sprained his knee on his fourth
run and was lost for the day after
carrying a Duck defender six
yards.
Quarterback Brian Johnson's
passing and fullback Scott Eschel
man's running and receiving kept
the offense going, however, and
the Cardinal's young offensive line
played what was clearly its best
game of the season.
Both teams moved the ball well
between the 30s but neither got
into the end zone. Hopkins had
chances from 49 and 42 yards but
missed both. Gregg McCallum
missed a 49-yarder for the Ducks.
