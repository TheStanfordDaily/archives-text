Introducing the Class of '93
Just who are those eager young students
out there, maneuvering through bollard traps
and wondering if Food Service is always this
tasty? Dean of Undergraduate Admissions
Jean Fetter has provided a few statistics on
this year's freshmen and transfer students:
• The freshman class was selected from
14,912 applicants. Admission was offered to
2,626 (17.6 percent of the total), and 1,567
accepted. Of those enrolling, 54.9 percent are
men and 45.1 percent are women.
• Members of the Class of '93 hail from 37
foreign countries and every state except Ver
mont. The largest state representation is that
of California (32.3 percent of the class), fol
lowed by New York, Texas, Washington and
Illinois.
• Asian-American freshmen constitute 18.1
percent of the class (compared to 16 percent
last year). Black, Chicano and Native American
freshmen represent 8.4, 8.3 and 1.2 percent of
the class, respectively (compared to 10.1, 8.6
and 1.1 percent in 1988).
• The 113 transfer students were selected
from 1,211 applicants (31 others were accepted
but did not enroll). The transfer pool is 61.9
percent male and 38.1 percent female.
Some fountains running again
The long dry spell is finally over for some
campus fountains.
Turned off all last year because of a drought
in Northern California, at least two of the
fountains have been switched on again. Cheryl
Jensen, water manager for Operations and
Maintenance, said they're on to stay and even
tually will be joined by all the others on
campus.
The weekend of Sept. 16 brought a
downpour to the Bay Area, and Jensen said
the early rain — and the arrival of new stu
dents and their parents for Orientation — con
tributed to her decision to turn on the foun
tains.
"We were eventually going to have to turn
them on anyway. It does a lot of damage to
them when they're turned off," Jensen said.
