# Boathouse bulldozing scheduled for today

### Brad Hayward Editorial staff 
A piece of Stanford history will
be knocked down, scooped up and
hauled away in dump trucks
today.
The Lake Lagunita Boathouse,
closed in April when a University
committee deemed it unsafe and
in danger of collapse, will be bull
dozed beginning this morning.
"We couldn't imagine keeping
the building open for people just
to have accidents happen, and put
ting a fence around it would make
the lake look so menacing," said
Michael Ramsey-Perez, director of
Student Organization Services.
A brief "Bon Voyage" ceremony
is scheduled for 8:30 a.m. today
at the barbecue pit next to the
Boathouse. The dismantling
should begin shortly after, and the
entire operation should be com
plete sometime Wednesday.
A center for spring quarter
water activities and the annual
Big Game Bonfire, the 50-year-old
Boathouse has deteriorated in
recent years. The upper deck, for
merly used for dances and parties,
has been closed for several years
because of safety concerns.
The structure was completely
closed last spring when engineers
told the Lake Commission, a panel
of University officials and stu
dents, that the wooden pilings
supporting the building were dan
gerously weak. The Commission
closed the building and relocated
its one resident, a facility mana
ger, to other campus housing.
The engineers' report estimated
that repairing the structure would
cost $500,000. "We couldn't see
throwing that kind of money at
it. We don't even have that kind

of money," Ramsey-Perez said.
The demolition, to be performed
by Cleveland Wrecking Co. of San
Francisco, will cost about $18,000.
There are no immediate plans
to replace the Boathouse, but the
University is committed to having
some kind of replacement struc
ture on the site, Ramsey-Perez
said.
The Lake Commission, chaired
by Assoc. Dean of Student Affairs
Michael Jackson, will spend much
of this year finding out what the
community would like to see on
the site and determining reason
able options.
In the meantime, Ramsey-Perez
said aquatic activities can con
tinue at the lake next spring if
two things are in supply —
lifeguards and rain. The lake was
empty last spring because winter
rains fell short, and a regional
drought prevented officials from
diverting water from other
sources into the basin.
The current Boathouse is the
third on the site. A small struc
ture graced Lagunita's shores un
til 1913, when a two-story replace
ment was built. That structure
lasted until 1938, when a balcony
collaped during a carnival, dump
ing 25 spectators into the water
and seriously injuring two. The
current Boathouse was built the
following year.
