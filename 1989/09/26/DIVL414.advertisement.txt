NEW ARCHITECTURE
The course provides an overall view of the process and
practice of architecture. Major emphasis: insight into all
aspects of the architect's practice; the functions of each
stage of the design cycle, required team, government re
quirements and interactions with consultants, engineers,
contractors, finance institutions and the client. Students will
work in teams on a design project (homeless shelter) as a
mechanism to illustrate each facet of the design effort.
Taught by prominent architects/contractor
from the Bay Area.
Open to a maximum of 30 graduate students. Undergrad
uates also admitted by permission. No prerequisites. Regis
