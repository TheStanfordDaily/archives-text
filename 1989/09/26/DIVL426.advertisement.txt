EVERY DAY 25,000 FACES ARE BURIED IN THE DAILY
They read our paper because they want to know what's going on at Stanford â€” and they
know there's no better source than The Stanford Daily.
If you want a chance to have 50,000 eyes staring at your work, come to one of our
orientation meetings. Meet with the editors and pick up an assignment. Positions are open
for writers, photographers, columnists, editorial board members, graphic artists and page
designers.
Meetings are TODAY at 1 p.m. and THURSDAY at Noon.
But feel free to stop by anytime. Or give us a call at 723-4632.
