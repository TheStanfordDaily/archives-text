Some long distance com
panies promise you the ni(x)n,
but what you really want is de
pendable, high-quality service.
That's just what you'll get when
you choose AT&T Long Distance
Service, at a cost that's a lot less
than you think. You can expect
low long distance rates, 24-hour
operator assistance, clear con
nections and immediate credit
for wrong numbers. And the
assurance that virtually all of
your calls will go through the
first time. That's the genius of
the AT&T Worldwide Intelligent
Network.
When its time to choose,
forget the gimmicks and make
the intelligent choice, AT&T.
If you'd like to know
more about our other AT&T
Long Distance products or
services, including the AT&T
Card, contact your Stanford
University AT&T Student
Campus Manager or call us at
1-800-222-0300.
AT&T
The right choice.
