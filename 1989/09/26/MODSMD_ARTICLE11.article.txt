# Senate agrees to drug plan

WASHINGTON (AP) - Senate
Democrats reached a tentative
agreement with the White House
late yesterday on a $8.8 billion
package to wage the nation's war
on drugs, including an across-the
board cut in other programs to
pay for it.
The agreement provides $900
million more than President Bush
had asked his nationally televised
anti-drug speech Sept. 5. Congres
sional Democrats had criticized
that request as too little to make
headway against the drug scourge
and demanded that more be spent.
The compromise figure went a
little less than halfway toward the
$2.2 billion increase that had been
proposed by Senate Appropria
tions Commitee Chairman Robert
C. Byrd, D-W.Va.
But nearly all the increase —
$800 million — is to be devoted
to drug treatment, education and
prevention programs that Demo
crats said were most seriously un
derfunded in Bush's proposal.
"The American people wanted
more than the president re
quested, and this gets more,"
Byrd told reporters. "It's not a
final solution, but it's a good first

step toward fighting the war on
drugs."
Sen. Mark O. Hatfield, R-Ore.,
the chief negotiator for Senate Re
publicans, sought to minimize any
Democratic advantage from the
accord by pointing to Bush's lead
ership in proposing the anti-drug
package in the first place.
"This is a bipartisan war," Hat
field said, adding that he expected
many Senate Republicans to sup
port the compromise package.
"The Democrats don't have any
greater degree of support for the
drug war than the Republicans."
Left unresolved were several
legislative initiatives Bush had
proposed on habeas corpus and
the death penalty to strengthen
the prosecution of drug dealers.
Those awaited talks with Senate
Judiciary Committee Chairman
Joseph Biden, D-Del., who was out
of town on yesterday.
Discussions aimed at finding a
compromise had broken off on Fri
day after an apparent stalemate
was reached. Byrd, the chief
Democratic negotiator, com
plained that the White House had
been"a shadow participant" in
the negotiations and was causing

the breakdown.
But Hatfield said Byrd telep
honed him Friday night and the
two met on Saturday to begin put
ting the talks back on track.
The agreement, if finalized
today when other key senators
return to Washington, was ex
pected to free four major money
bills needed to keep programs
running after the fiscal year ends
Sept. 30: transportation; foreign
aid; veterans, housing and space;
and labor, health and education.
Passage of the bills by the Senate
was expected as early as today.
Under the compromise, the in
creased drug funding — $3.1 bil
lion more than is being spent in
the current fiscal year — will be
paid for by cutting most federal
programs by 0.43 percent. The cut
does not affect Social Security and
other benefit programs.
The cut also means a dent of
$1.3 billion in next year's $288.2
billion Pentagon budget. But in
the case of defense spending, the
agreement allows the flexibility
the administration had sought to
allocate the cuts to areas where
the pinch can be minimized.
