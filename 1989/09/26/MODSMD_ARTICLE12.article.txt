# Soviet government plans drastic cuts in defense spending
## 
### 
MOSCOW (AP) — The government
yesterday unveiled a $750 billion budget
that cuts military spending by 8.3 percent
and increases financing for social needs,
reflecting the Soviet Union's shifting
priorities under Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
Finance Minister Valentin Pavlov said
the government is planning to cut the
$192 billion deficit in half by raising $83
billion in new revenues and trimming
expenditures by $10.3 billion.
He told the opening of the fall session
of the Supreme Soviet legislature that
military spending could be cut because
the Soviet Union's "realistic and con
structive foreign policy" had led to an
improvement in international relations.

The decision to cut military spending
from $119 billion to $109 billion is in
keeping with a directive from the Con
gress of People's Deputies parliament to
cut military spending by 14 percent by
1991, Pavlov said.
Military research alone will be cut by
$3.4 billion, he said.
Officials say the 1990 budget is of an
"emergency character" because of the def
icit that has spun out of control as the
country's economic situation worsens.
The budget deficit is only the second the
Soviet government has acknowledged.
The finance minister said the govern
ment was planning to raise pensions for
60 million retirees by an average of 15

percent and reorient the Soviet economy
toward fulfilling social needs.
Pavlov did not immediately say how
the government would raise the extra
money.
Earlier in the day, Gorbachev told the

Supreme Soviet that the government will
take firm steps to settle the ethnic dis
pute over Nagorno-Karabakh if Armenia
and Azerbaijan cannot end it quickly.
"If the situation doesn't stabilize, I
think our government, along with the
republics, will have to take concrete
steps," Gorbachev said over the dispute
over the autonomous region of Nagorno-
Karabakh in Azerbaijan.
Armenia and Azerbaijan, two neighbor
ing southern Soviet republics, have been
locked in a bitter 19-month dispute over
control of the enclave. About 100 people
have died in the ethnic conflict.
An economic blockade of mainly Chris
tian Armenia, which receives more than

80 percent of its food and fuel via pre
dominantly Moslem Azerbaijan, has left
shelves bare and industry at a virtual
standstill.
Gorbachev did not say what measures
he had in mind, but in replying to leg
islators' questions Gorbachev indicated
that he wanted the problem resolved
within days.
Located in the Caucasus Mountains in
the southern Soviet Union north of Iran,
Nagorno-Karabakh's area is 1,760 square
miles, slightly smaller than Delaware.
The 1979 Soviet census put Nagorno-
Karabakh's population at 162,000, of
which 76 percent were ethnic Armenians
and 23 percent ethnic Azerbaijanis.
