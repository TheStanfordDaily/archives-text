# President proposes chemical weapons ban
## 
### 
WASHINGTON CAP) - The United States
and the Soviet Union are the only two nations
to acknowledge having chemical weapons, al
though up to a dozen, including Libya and
Iran, are thought to have the grisly substances
or the ability to make them, experts said
yesterday.
President Bush, addressing the U.N. Gen
eral Assembly, proclaimed his readiness to
destroy 80 percent of U.S. chemical weapon
stores if Moscow agrees to the same stockpile
level, and urged other nations to sign a mul
tilateral pact to ban them entirely.
Bush, however, did not suspend production
of new U.S. chemical weapons, and his offer
did not appear to go beyond legislation passed
by Congress requiring the government to
destroy old chemical weapons stocks by 1997.
The president's proposal "might focus in
ternational attention on chemical weapons and
lead to a multilateral treaty," said Lee
Feinstein of the Arms Control Association, a
disarmament lobby in Washington.
But it may instead produce a U.S.-Soviet
deal on chemical weapons and divert attention
from production by other countries, he said.
Private analysts believe the United States
has 30,000 tons of chemical weapons. The

Soviets have said they have "no more than
50,000.
Delegates to the 40-nation Conference on
Disarmament ended their most recent meeting
in Geneva last month without any clear idea
of when it would be possible to conclude a
global ban on chemical weapons.
The conference, which meets again in No
vember, is stalled on the issue of how to
monitor the production of chemical weapons,
which experts say can be made in factories
similar to those that make fertilizer or other
compounds.
"The problem we have is that nobody has
determined how to (monitor) it in an effec
tively verifiable way, because chemical weap
ons can be made in just about any kind of
chemical plant," Gen. Colin Powell said earlier
this year, before he was nominated chairman
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
Also in dispute are the size of chemical
weapons stockpiles, and even the number of
countries that have them.
U.S. intelligence officials have said that
Libya is building the world's largest chemical
weapons plant at Rabta. Libyan leader Moam
mar Gadhafi has said the factory is designed

to produce pharmaceuticals.
In 1984, the United Nations concluded that
Iraq had used lethal chemical agents against
Kurds along the Iran-Iraq border, although
Iraq has not admitted it.
Other nations thought able to make their
own chemical weapons are Burma, China,
Iran, Israel, Libya, North Korea. Syria,
Taiwan and probably Egypt, said Elisa Harris,
a scholar who closely tracks the issue at the
Brookings Institution in Washington.
The size of the U.S. and Soviet stockpiles
is not publicly known, although those two
governments last weekend signed an agree
ment to exchange and verify data on their
chemical arsenals, including the right to on
sight inspection.
The United States has disclosed what type
of weapons it has and where they are stored,
but not the size of the stockpiles. The Arms
Control Association estimated the size of the
U.S. stock at about 30,000 tons.
In 1987, the U.S. government, after an 18-
year moratorium, began to manufacture a
new generation of "binary" chemical weapons,
which consist of two toxic substances that
become lethal when mixed together.
