Brazil will give vote
to its 16-year-olds
RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil
(AP) — Brazil has lowered the
voting age from 18 to 16, the
only country in the world other
than Nicaragua to allow
citizens so young to vote.
"Why shouldn't I be ex
cited?" said Marcio Santos
Martins, a prep-school student.
"Just because I'm 16 doesn't
mean I'm not politically ma
ture or don't take voting
seriously."
The lowering of the voting
age is not expected to have any
dramatic effect on the outcome
of the election. Just 4.5 million
Brazilians under 18 — less
than 6 percent of the total
voting population of 81.5 mil
lion — registered to vote by
the Aug. 6 deadline, according

to the government's Supreme
Electoral Tribunal.
But the voting experiment
has sparked harsh debate
across this country of 144 mil
lion people on the role teen
agers should play in Brazilian
society.
"Young Brazilians today are
being confronted with reality
at an earlier age," said Helena
Quadrado, director of the
McCann-Erickson reserch and
planning department in Sao
Paulo, Brazil's biggest city.
In Brazil, 16-year-olds can
work, pay taxes, marry and
open bank accounts, she said.
Allowing 16- and 17-year
olds to vote will help cement
democracy in Brazil's nascent
republic and discourage the
young from tacitly accepting
future military takeovers, said
Sen. Afonso Arinos of Rio de
Janeiro, a leading of the lower
voting age.
