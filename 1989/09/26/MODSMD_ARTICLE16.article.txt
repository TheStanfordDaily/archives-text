Kennedy clouds line
between skepticism
and narrow-mindedness

EVEN THE MOST clueless
frosh had some clue what
University President Donald
Kennedy was alluding to when he
used the words "agendas" and
"values" in his welcoming address
Friday.
The coda of his address warned
entering students against being too
quick to abandon the "fundamental
views" they have developed thus
far. He advised them "to harbor a
healthy mistrust of conventional
wisdom and of what is passed off
as 'correct politics,' because the
work you have already done for
yourself may well be better."
Though Kennedy made his state
ments in a subtle and general man
ner, it was clear that the Agenda
for Action's takeover of his office
brought the thoughts to mind.
Council of Presidents member
Ingrid Nava provided an eloquent
counterpoint to Kennedy's warn
ing. For her, a Chicana from Texas
— and probably for many others
arrested May 15 — her "funda
mental views" needed little modi
fication to bring them into the
Agenda for Action and ultimately
into the President's office.
Kennedy's welcoming addresses
usually link events of the past year
to his hopes for the incoming class'
next four. Compared to four years
ago, when he challenged freshmen
to "question authority," his tone
this year was unusually conserva
tive.
Kennedy's motivations for this
shift could be read in a number of
ways.
We hope that by urging caution
in adopting new views Kennedy

was urging a freer discourse on
issues of race and ethnicity and
trying to prevent the hegemony of
political correctness from squelch
ing honest airing of views.
We hope Kennedy intended to
create an atmosphere in which all
students, minority and white, are
able to express themselves freely.
As recent Stanford graduate
Marcus Mabry wrote in this week's
Newsweek, a dialogue — rather
than parallel monologues — should
be the goal.
But others might feel Kennedy
was trying to discourage students
from opening their minds to new
ideas. By urging "a healthy
mistrust," we hope Kennedy did
not unwittingly further some stu
dents' already-existing mistrust of
minority student groups.
According to the University
Committee on Minority Issues
report, most Stanford students
have scant exposure to people of
color before coming here, which
increases the likelihood that they
lack understanding of students
from different backgrounds.
If the University is truly com
mitted to creating a multicultural
environment, why is Kennedy em
phasizing skepticism over openness
to different points of view?
Earlier in his speech, Kennedy
said plainly, "There is one question
you need never ask another stu
dent: 'What are you doing here?'"
Perhaps that point should have
been stressed more strongly, given
that there are students here who
would ask such questions of mi
nority students.
Kennedy seems to avoid con
fronting that danger in his concern
for white students who feel pres
sured by the political climate here
to keep silent. Both forms of silenc
ing are serious problems, and both
must be addressed simultaneously
— a difficult balance to maintain.
