## African-Americans brutalized by police 
### 
I have had to come face to face in
recent months with the Santa Clara
County legal system, and the experi
ence has taught me a lot about our so
ciety. Three weeks after the May 15
protest at President Kennedy's office, on
the day before finals were to begin, a
warrant was issued for my arrest.
The warrant included six charges —
obstructing police justice, trespassing,
unlawful assembly, refusal to disperse,
inciting to riot and battery. Scared and
confused, I contacted a lawyer, told my
teachers that I wouldn't be able to take
my final exams, and turned myself in at
the police station. After being booked, I
was released on my own recognizance.
I do not know the motivation of the
police officers and the district attorney
who have sought to incarcerate me, but
I cannot stop thinking about a few simple
facts. Of the 600 or so people who par
ticipated that day in the protest and
rallies, I am the only one to face these
six charges. I was the only African Amer
ican to speak while the bus was sur
rounded. I am the vice chairman for ex
ternal affairs of the Black Student Union.
As a double major in history and
African and Afro-American Studies, I
have read a lot about the history of black
community relations with the police. On
the 15th, I was aware that the last time
Stanford students were arrested fora
sit-in, in 1985, Robby Perkins, the only
black student to participate, emerged
from the county jail with bruises over
his body. The BSU at that time explained
to the Stanford administration that the
treatment of Robby was not an isolated

incident, but rather part of an old pattern
of improper treatment of black people on
campus.
At Virginia Beach, Virginia, this past
Labor Day, the governor called in the
national guard to "keep the peace" be
cause thousands of black college students
were gathering for an end of summer
weekend. The National Guard arrested
more than 1,000 students and young
people when they were given the order
to clear the streets.
Last January, on Martin L. King, Jr.'s
birthday, off-duty black policeman Don
Jackson arranged a "sting" of the Long
Beach police to prove the arbitrary nature
in which the police treat black people.
After he was pulled over, while driving
legally, the arresting officer rammed Don
Jackson's head through a plate glass win
dow while Jackson was waiting to be
frisked. The footage was shown on the
Today show.
Don Jackson is not a relative of mine,
but he is my brother, if you know what
1 mean. He wrote a column in the New
York Times where he said, "It has long
been the role of the police to see that
the plantation mentality is passed from
one generation of blacks to another. No
one has enforced these rules with more
zeal than the police."
The reality of African-American his
tory bears out the truth of Jackson's
words. The police are the ones who ar
rested black folks trying to exercise their
constitutional right to sit at a lunch
counter or sit in the front of the bus.
FBI records prove the existence of a na
tionally coordinated effort, the Counter

Intelligence Program (COINTELPRO),
which was consciously designed to
"prevent the rise of a Black messiah"
and to prevent unity among black groups
in the 19605. J. Edgar Hoover's FBI had
an almost maniacal obsession with dis
crediting and neutralizing Martin L.
King, Jr.
In 1989, we are still faced with the
reality of an unjust, unequal society
where the police are the armed enforcers
of the status quo. As an African-American
leader, I know that I risk personal
hardship when I stand up for change,
but that is a price I am willing to pay.
Frederick Douglass risked his safety by
advocating the abolition of slavery. Mar
tin L. King, Jr. was arrested dozens of
times in his efforts to end segregation
and bring about and economic
equality. Sacrifice in the cause of justice
is nothing new.
Despite the challenges before me, I can
do no less than continue to raise my
voice in opposition to injustice and ine
quality. I want the Stanford community
to equally protect and respect all of its
members. I want an African and Afro-
American Studies program that is a na
tional model in the pursuit of knowledge
and truth about black people. I want a
society where every human being has the
capacity to develop to her or his fullest
potential. I will not be deterred in my
efforts to bring this new society to frui
tion.

Despite the challenges before me, I can
do no less than continue to raise my
voice in opposition to injustice and ine
quality. I want the Stanford community

American Studies program that is a na

and truth about black people. I want a
society where every human being has the
capacity to develop to her or his fullest
potential. I will not be deterred in my
efforts to bring this new society to frui
tion.

I have had to come face to face in
recent months with the Santa Clara
County legal system, and the experi
ence has taught me a lot about our so
ciety. Three weeks after the May 15
protest at President Kennedy's office, on
the day before finals were to begin, a
warrant was issued for my arrest.
The warrant included six charges —
obstructing police justice, trespassing,
unlawful assembly, refusal to disperse,
inciting to riot and battery. Scared and
confused, I contacted a lawyer, told my
teachers that I wouldn't be able to take
my final exams, and turned myself in at
the police station. After being booked, I
was released on my own recognizance.
I do not know the motivation of the
police officers and the district attorney
who have sought to incarcerate me, but
I cannot stop thinking about a few simple
facts. Of the 600 or so people who par
ticipated that day in the protest and
rallies, I am the only one to face these
six charges. I was the only African Amer
ican to speak while the bus was sur
rounded. I am the vice chairman for ex
ternal affairs of the Black Student Union.
As a double major in history and
African and Afro-American Studies, I
have read a lot about the history of black
community relations with the police. On
the 15th, I was aware that the last time
Stanford students were arrested fora
sit-in, in 1985, Robby Perkins, the only
black student to participate, emerged
from the county jail with bruises over
his body. The BSU at that time explained
to the Stanford administration that the
treatment of Robby was not an isolated

incident, but rather part of an old pattern
of improper treatment of black people on
campus.
At Virginia Beach, Virginia, this past
Labor Day, the governor called in the
national guard to "keep the peace" be
cause thousands of black college students
were gathering for an end of summer
weekend. The National Guard arrested
more than 1,000 students and young
people when they were given the order
to clear the streets.
Last January, on Martin L. King, Jr.'s
birthday, off-duty black policeman Don
Jackson arranged a "sting" of the Long
Beach police to prove the arbitrary nature
in which the police treat black people.
After he was pulled over, while driving
legally, the arresting officer rammed Don
Jackson's head through a plate glass win
dow while Jackson was waiting to be
frisked. The footage was shown on the
Today show.
Don Jackson is not a relative of mine,
but he is my brother, if you know what
1 mean. He wrote a column in the New
York Times where he said, "It has long
been the role of the police to see that
the plantation mentality is passed from
one generation of blacks to another. No
one has enforced these rules with more
zeal than the police."
The reality of African-American his
tory bears out the truth of Jackson's
words. The police are the ones who ar
rested black folks trying to exercise their
constitutional right to sit at a lunch
counter or sit in the front of the bus.
FBI records prove the existence of a na
tionally coordinated effort, the Counter

Intelligence Program (COINTELPRO),
which was consciously designed to
"prevent the rise of a Black messiah"
and to prevent unity among black groups
in the 19605. J. Edgar Hoover's FBI had
an almost maniacal obsession with dis
crediting and neutralizing Martin L.
King, Jr.
In 1989, we are still faced with the
reality of an unjust, unequal society
where the police are the armed enforcers
of the status quo. As an African-American
leader, I know that I risk personal
hardship when I stand up for change,
but that is a price I am willing to pay.
Frederick Douglass risked his safety by
advocating the abolition of slavery. Mar
tin L. King, Jr. was arrested dozens of
times in his efforts to end segregation
and bring about and economic
equality. Sacrifice in the cause of justice
is nothing new.
Despite the challenges before me, I can
do no less than continue to raise my

quality. I want the Stanford community
to equally protect and respect all of its
