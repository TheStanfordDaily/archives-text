## 
### Michael Friedly Staff writer 
A celebration of cultural diversity at
Stanford was the theme of the freshman
Orientation program "The Fire Within"
held last night before a packed audience
at Memorial Auditorium.
Sponsored jointly by the Asian-American
Student Association, the Stanford Ameri
can Indian Organization, the Black Student
Union and MEChA, a Chicano/Latino stu
dent group, the annual gathering praised
the "cultural flame that burns within us,"
according to Council of Presidents member
Chin-Chin Chen, who opened the event.
Through various displays of ethnic danc

ing and music, the groups demonstrated
the rich history of the four communities
of color. Underlying the displays was a plea
for recognition of the differences that exist
among the groups.
Brian Baker of SAIO began his organi
zation's presentation with an attack on the
"stereotyping and racism" that still exist
toward Native Americans, citing the use
of Indians as mascots for sports teams.
Baker commended the University's actions
to change the mascot from the Indians to
the Cardinal in the 1970s but called the
continuing stereotype "extremely offen
sive."
Baker aldo mentioned the col
lection of Native American arti
facts for historical research as a
"source of pain and anger" but
lauded the University's recent ef
forts to return Native American
bones to tlie original peoples.
The speech was followed by a
slide presentation from Pat Seka
quaptewa of her Hopi
tribe, depicting ordinary life 'on
the reservation. SAIO finished
with a performance from the
Apache Eagle Feather Dancers,
who showcased Pueblo tribal
dances, including an impressive
display of a Native American hoop
dance.
AASA members Richard Suh
and Sophia Shing began the

group's presentation with the
recognition of the 20th anniver
sary of the Asian-American
organization.
The AASA presentation also in
cluded a performance of a tradi
tional Chinese folk dance and a
slide presentation showing a brief
history of the struggle of Asian-
Americans against racism.
' MEChA focused on the pride of
Ohicano and Latino students in
its display of cultural diversity.
The speakers encouraged the
freshmen to "celebrate our differ
ences" and to end the racism that
still exists. An illustration of the
problem was given as a speaker
related how she was mistaken for
a worker instead of a student on
campus.
Progressive action was encour
aged to end the racism, including
a statement in support of the

takeover of University President
Donald Kepned/s office.
A performance of a Mexican folk
dance by the Ballet Folklorico an<J
the ballad "El Corrido de
MEChA," a song originally com
posed by ihembers of MEChA and
sung by Marip EscamiUa, demon
strated the cultural heritage of
the Chicano/Latino group.
The BSU began with a re
minder of the,racism that still
remains at Stanford, chastising
the insensitivity of those respon
sible for posting the racist posters
found last fall in Ujamaa House,
the black theme house. Poetic
readings, jazz and gospel music,
and African rhythmic dances all
conveyed the pride of the black
st'-dents and their ties to "Mother
Africa." The athletic performance
of the Kuumba Dancers, com
prised of students, was received

with a standing ovation
The political agenda of the BSU
came to the surface in a statement
by a member of the black gospel
music group, who said that "fight
ing police brutality" against junior
Louis Jackson would be a focus
of the BSU's efforts this fall. Jack
son *is currently facing criminal
charges for his role in the May
15 takeover.
Jackson came to the stage later
fora musical interpretation of a
song by John Coltrane. Coltrane's
jazz melody seemed to be marred
by notes that were off-key but
created, according to Jackson,
"unique harmonies" that were
greatly improved as a result of
the notes. He compared this to a
multi-cultural community, in
which people of color didn't seem
to fit. The whole community, how
ever, was enhanced, he explained.
