A celebration of cultural diversity at
Stanford was the theme of the freshman
Orientation program "The Fire Within"
held last night before a packed audience
at Memorial Auditorium.
Sponsored jointly by the Asian-American
Student Association, the Stanford Ameri
can Indian Organization, the Black Student
Union and MEChA, a Chicano/Latino stu
dent group, the annual gathering praised
the "cultural flame that burns within us,"
according to Council of Presidents member
Chin-Chin Chen, who opened the event.
Through various displays of ethnic danc

ing and music, the groups demonstrated
the rich history of the four communities
of color. Underlying the displays was a plea
for recognition of the differences that exist
among the groups.
Brian Baker of SAIO began his organi
zation's presentation with an attack on the
"stereotyping and racism" that still exist
toward Native Americans, citing the use
of Indians as mascots for sports teams.
Baker commended the University's actions
to change the mascot from the Indians to
the Cardinal in the 1970s but called the
continuing stereotype "extremely offen
sive."
