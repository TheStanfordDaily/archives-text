## Stanford Bachelors are an unethical Alumni club 
### 
The Stanford Bachelors have gene
too far!
The Stanford Bachelors are an
Alumni Club chartered by the Stanford
Alumni Association. In return for
receiving such a charter, a club is
expected to abide by certain guidelines
and "promote ongoing communication
between Stanford and its alumni." The
Bachelors have blatantly disregarded
the intent of these guidelines.
The Bachelors maintain a huge
computerized mailing list of singles.
Under the guise of Stanford fund
raising functions, thousands of these
singles are invited to mammoth dance
parties throughout the Bay Area once
or twice a month. The youngest and
most attractive females are then
recruited to attend small, intimate
parties at country clubs, private homes,
fine restaurants, chartered yachts, ski
weekends at the Stanford Alpine
Chalet, luxury bus tours to the wine
country, etc.
What is the purpose of the large
parties? To "promote ongoing commu
nication between Stanford and its

alumni?" How could they. There are
only 15 to 25 Stanford alumni present.
The remaining 400 to 1,200 guests
have nothing to do with Stanford
whatsoever.
To raise money for Stanford? The
Bachelors collect large sums of money
at these functions and they do make
contributions to Stanford. It is sus
pected that most of the funds are used
to subsidize the small parties. Surely,
the University must have more dig
nified and controlled fund-raising
methods.
Or is the real purpose of these
parties fora handful of middle-aged
Stanford graduates to meet impres
sionable young women?
At the parties, guests are requested
to fill out registration cards which are
unabashedly sorted into different
stacks. This sorting frenzy is especially
noticeable at the women's registration
table. One can only speculate on what
basis a woman qualifies for stack No.l
as opposed to stack N0.2 or N0.3.
Looks? Age? Bust size? Skirt length?
Stanford alumni women are system-

atically, aggressively and deliberately
discouraged from joining the club.
Evidently, they do not measure up to
the qualifications mentioned above. As
a result, the club has not one woman
member.
The Bachelors are openly practicing
age discrimination. As is stated in
their invitations, anyone over 40 is not
welcome.
The Stanford Bachelors Club is run
by an "old boy" network. The president
is hand-picked by a five member Board
of Directors. This Board consists of
(guess what!) mostly former club presi
dents. There are no elections for presi
dent or any other club officers, nor are
binding votes accepted on any club
issues. A great setup to perpetuate the
status quo.
Nobody would object if the Bachelors
confined their activities to Alumni
Association sanctioned activities such
as small private parties, speaker events,
educational functions, etc., and invited
guests of their choosing. In spite of the
statement "by invitation only," func
tions are well-publicized and definitely

not private. Anyone willing to pay the
"donation" is admitted.
The Bachelors' arrogance and im
pudicity is perhaps best illustrated by
their bylaws. The bylaws state that
"the Club exists for the purpose of
providing an atmosphere conducive to
meeting women the members find
attractive." That may be perfectly
normal. The Alumni Association, how
ever, should not lower itself to the
level of a singles pick-up bar and
become a vehicle for this sort of activ
ity.
It is incomprehensible that a great
institution like Stanford Alumni Asso
ciation should help the Bachelors clean
house. Age and sex discrimination
must stop. The structure of the club
ought to be redefined. There should be
a reasonable ratio between Stanford
alumni and other guests at the Bache
lors' events.
The Stanford Bachelors have become
an anachronism and an embarrassment
to Stanford. Something must be done
about them.
