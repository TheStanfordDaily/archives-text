# Questions for frosh in CIV to consider
## 
### 
I would like to make a suggestion.
When this year's freshmen get through
studying their "world civilization"
courses, familiarizing themselves with
every corner of the globe, I would like
to suggest that the following two ques
tions be included in their final exam:
1. In September of this year, tens of
thousands of East Germans fled to
West Germany through Hungary. When
asked why he was leaving his
homeland, one East German youth
said, "You people have no idea what
it's like to live in a country where you

can't develop the talents with which
you were born."
Explain.
2. After 50 years of Soviet rule,
shoppers in the Soviet Union still find
it impossible to buy the most simple
articles of everyday life. There is a
national shortage of soap. Consumers
say they never see meat or fresh vege
tables. One Western reporter told of
entering a dimly lit provincial super
market and finding only a few jars of
pickled cucumbers and some canned
herring in rotting tomato sauce.
Why?
You should spend no more than ten
minutes on each question.
