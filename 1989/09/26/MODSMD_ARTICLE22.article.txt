# Campbell still holds position at Hoover
## 
### 
In the first issue of the new aca
demic year, you state that it is now
possible for editors to put the paper
and themselves to bed at a sane hour.
Obviously this did not prevent an
error in your first edition, where you
state that I retired Aug. 31. Actually I
became Counselor, with a six percent
salary increase to $132,500 per annum,
plus each year another such increase.
In addition, I still have my office, sup
port staff, parking place, and car and
driver for Hoover business, and will
continue to have all this until at least

August 31, 1995 when I will be 71
years of age.
W. Glenn Campbell
Counselor, Hoover Institution
