P ear not, Bug Me fans, the Bug
will soon be back from his sum
mer break.
And for those of you who are
interested in being the Bug, get
out a pencil and your phone book.
This year we will be selecting a
Bug by judging your writing sam
ples, with emphasis being placed
on 1) your sense of humor and
2) how accurately and thoroughly
you answer Bug questions. If you
would like to be the Bug, send us
two questions of your own crea
tion with their corresponding
answers, being sure to demon
strate that you know where to
find the information. If you wish
to enjoy Bug humor, read on and
er\joy.

Dear Bug Me,
Was Yogi Berra named after
Yogi Bear, or vice versa?
— George Steinbrenner, grad
student
For those of you who aren't big
followers of American sports, Yogi
Berra was a Hall of Fame catcher
and later a coach and manager
(short-lived, as is the tradition
with Yankee skippers) for the
New York Yankees. Born
Lawrence Peter Berra on May 12,
1925, Berra made his first ap
pearance with the Yankees in
1946, by which time he had picked
up the nickname "Yogi" for
reasons I couldn't find out (maybe
something having to do with his
religious preferences).
I talked to a public relations
representative for the Yankees,
and after laughing at me he said,
"I definitely don't think Yogi
Berra was named after Yogi and
800-800. That's not a question I
would have asked Yogi when he
was coaching here, either."

Hmmmm. ..
Undeterred, I then called the
creators of Yogi Bear, Hanna-
Barbara Productions in Los An
geles. The public relations folks
there told me that Yogi Bear made
his debut on the "Huckleberry
Hound" show in 1958.
They said although Yogi Bear's
character was actually patterned
on Art Carney's Ed Norton char
acter in"The Honeymooners" TV
show, the name was "definitely
borrowed from Yogi Berra."

Dear Bug Me,
Why is there a Modess machine
(you know, it sells those things)
in the men's restroom (Room 32)
at Roble Gym?
— Fred
Perhaps a more appropriate

question here would be why you
are unable to utter, much less
write, the word "tampon" when
you don't even sign your last
name. The question is a valid one,
however, as the University is ac
tually selling tampons in the
men's room in question.
Jean Helliwell, the facility co
ordinator of Roble Gym, and I
had a good laugh about this. She
knew nothing about the machine
(which makes sense when you
think about it because it is in the
men's room) but conceded the pos
sibility of its existence.
Prior to 1975, according to Hel
liwell, Roble Gym was for women
only and that infamous Room 32
was a women's room. When the
gym went coed, the bathroom
made the change as well.
Hopefully it got some counsel
ing first.
The machine is probably empty,
Helliwell said, but she says she'll
check it out and submit a work
order to have it removed.
I observed, however, that the
machine vends its wares for only
a nickel. You can't get many
things fora nickel anymore.
Maybe it should stay where it is.
And the notorious Bug ..

Dear Bug,
During a heated discussion, my
friend and I made a bet regarding
the anatomy of various large
mammals. Naturally, to settle it
we decided to turn to the most
respected authority on campus,
The Bug. How large is the repro
ductive organ of a male blue
whale? A respectable sum rides
upon the answer.
— Moby Dick
Now then, can we please dis
pense with this "male reproduc
tive organ" nonsense and refer

hereafter to the whale's member
by its scientific name: the
"schlong."
Surprising as it may seem,
Moby, there isn't a whole lot of
literature out there dealing with
the private member of the blue
whale — Balaenoptera Musculus
to you scientific types. There are
a couple of reasons for the dearth
of research in this area, not the
least of which is that the whale's
privates don't hang out there
where everybody can see them,
but rather are neatly tucked in
side the body, ready to emerge for
mating or at whale fraternity par
ties.
When not being used, the
cetacean penis is curled up inside
the body in an S-shape, attached
to the pelvic bone by two rigid

muscles. When these muscles
slacken and the body of the organ
fills with blood, the penis is
pushed out of a slit in the whale's
body and is ready for action.
Having dealt scientifically with
the anatomical specifications, it's
time to dive into the more prurient
vital statistics. I'd strongly rec
ommend at this point that you sit
down, pour yourself a stiff drink
and ask the children to leave the
room. Remember, this data is
being given for informational pur
poses only and should not be used
in an imprudent manner — such
as to gross people out.
Assuming your large male blue
whale is roughly 90 to 100 feet
long and weighs 130 tons, you
can expect the sucker to have a
penis which is roughly 10 feet long
and a foot in diameter.

To put this into perspective, the
average 5-foot-10 human would
need a seven-inch span, erect, to
have the same body length to
penis ratio as the blue whale. The
blue whale's testes, which are on
the inside of the body, behind the
kidneys, can be up to two-and-a
half feet long and weigh 100
pounds. I refuse to try to put this
into a human perspective, as I am
not about to weigh my . . . oh,
never mind.
So what does a blue whale do
with a 10-foot wiener? As it turns
out, not a whole heck of a lot.
Blue whales, it seems, are only
privileged to mate during one
short period of the year, unlike
some higher order creatures
which mate, say, every Thursday
night. In fact, there is a great
deal of speculation about exactly
how whales even go about mating,
because: a) they do it underwater,
and b) it lasts less than 30
seconds. It is generally acknowl
edged that whales mate side by
side near the surface of the water,
or belly to belly while poking verti
cally out of the ocean.
In any event, whales are known
to be very gentle and tender dur
ing courtship and copulation, dur
ing which they make those mys
terious whale sounds that are
known to arouse scientists. An
English translation of those
sounds might be as follows:
Male whale: "Hey babe, I've got
a 10-foot male reproductive or
___ M
gan.
Female whale: "Oh yeah?
(Snicker, snicker.) I've got 30
seconds to kill."
Interestingly, in big whales the
only skin that is smooth enough
for human use is that which
covers the penis. Although it had
no commerial value, whalers often
used to turn the skin of the blue
whale penis into useful domestic
articles. Such as a sofa.
