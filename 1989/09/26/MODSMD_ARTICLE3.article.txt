# Probe targets radiation use
## State finds violations, orders report on safety program 
### Jock Friedly Editorial staff 
After an unannounced March inspec
tion of laboratories and voluminous doc
uments, state officials are investigating
Stanford for more than 30 violations of
state and University safety regulations.
The Department of Health Services
found the violations after a routine,
weeklong inspection of some laborato
ries permitted to use radioactive
substances, and the regulatory agency
ordered Stanford to "perform a critical
review of the program" to determine
whether the violations were sympto
matic of a larger problem.
The agency has not yet dropped its
investigation, but one state official said
it will when Stanford submits an ade
quate review of its entire Health Physics
Department.
Despite the large number of viola
tions, none of them were considered to
be a serious threat to the safety of
anyone involved, according to Joseph
Takahashi, associate health physicist
with the department's Radiologic Health
Division.
After the department sent Stanford
the results of its inspection, the Uni
versity formed an ad hoc task force that
completed its report last month. The

report is now being reviewed by the
vice provost for research. The text of
the report probably will not be made
public, according to various University
officials, although some said a summary
of the report's results probably will be
released.
If the full report is not released as
some speculated, this would mark the
first review of laboratory safety that
the University has not been willing to
make public in more than a year and
a half. At that time, the Department of
Health and Safety was shaken by an
employee's allegations of mismanage
ment, cover-up and unethical behavior
concerning safety.
But according to Environmental
Health and Safety Director Carol
Hoerner, Health Physics will add one
more employee to its staff to help deal
with an increasing paper trail to track

the use of radioactive materials.
The ongoing investigation that has
caused the University to review its ra
diation safety program has dragged on
for months because of earlier commu
nication problems between Stanford and
the state. Several times the state sent
back requests for clarification of corre
spondence from Stanford. After months
of sending letters back and forth, Uni
versity officials met last week in
Sacramento with state officials to dis
cuss their differences of opinion.
"The inspectors were very receptive,"
Hoerner said. "I think there was an
appreciation that we have a sound pro
gram."
But in the initial report, the depart
ment criticisms included:
• Stanford's radiation safety program
is not controlled by the University's "ra
diation safety committee." State inspec
tors said Stanford should describe what
mechanism is in place to review the
Health Physics program.
• More frequent audits should be
made to ensure that personnel are qual
ified to handle radioactive materials.
• A better system should be devised
to prevent researchers from obtaining
more radioactive shipments than they
