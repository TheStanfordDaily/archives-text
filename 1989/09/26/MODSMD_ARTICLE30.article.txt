# Vegetarian event offers food for thought and stomach
## 
### Jennifer Schmid Editorial staff 
Now is the time many students'
thoughts begin to drift toward
[Domino's pepperoni pizza, Togo's
everything-on-it subs, and yes,
Food Service's "mystery meat."
Before you bite into that next
piece of pepperoni, however, take
note: World Vegetarian Day 1989
occurs Sun., Oct. 1, and in
celebration of the event, the Stan
ford Vegetarians and many other
co-sponsors have arranged an all
day symposium, entitled "Living
Lightly on the Earth — What One
Person Can Do."
The planned events, which will
take place in Dinkelspiel Audito
rium from 9:30 a.m.to 5 p.m., in
clude talks by Dr. Michael Klaper,
author and scientific director of
the environmental group
Earth Save; Jan Hartke, chair of
Earth Save and vice-chair of the
group Blueprint for the Environ
ment; and John Jeavons, execu
tive director of Ecology Action and
expert on biointensive farming.
Other features of the sympo
sium — which focuses on the en
vironmental aspects of vegetarian
eating — include a cooking dem
onstration by nutritionist and
cooking instructor Jennifer
Raymond, a vegetarian luncheon,

food tasting, panel discussions of
ethical, health and environmental
issues, and entertainment by
singer Alice Di Micele.
Admission is $8 for students
and senior citizens, and $12 for
community members.
The impetus behind such a
gathering is two-fold, according to
graduate student and Stanford
Vegetarians founding member In
der Singh. The groups' first ob
jective for the event is to create
a community for vegetarians on
campus — Singh estimates about
5 percent of the Stanford popula
tion is vegetarian.
The second objective "is to
make information accessible to
the public," Singh said. "Whether
someone is concerned with nutri
tion and wants to know more
about vegetarian alternatives, or
if they are more concerned with
the environment and would like
to know how eating habits affect
it, we [will] have something for
everybody."
Singh noted that 200 people are
already preregistered to attend
the symposium and estimated
that actual attendance will range
from 400 to 600 community mem
bers.
Stanford Vegetarians co
founder Lynn Gale said the plan
ners of last year's World Vegetar

ian Day symposium, attended by
over 300 people, tried to address
all the issues of vegetarianism
equally, from health benefits to
the ethical problems of "factory
farming."
This year, she said, "We thought
the environment was an appropri
ate theme because there has been
so much recent interest in envi
ronmental problems."
Singh added, "Most people
don't know the connection be
tween what we eat and how it
affects the environment." He ex
plained that problems ranging
from deforestation and soil ero
sion to the ever-dwindling supply
of fossil fuel are affected by a
person's decision to eat meat.
For example, Singh said, over
46 million acres of U.S. forest
have been converted to grazing
land for cattle in a period of seven
years.
Other environmental problems
affected by the production of meat
include the scarcity of fossil fuels,
water pollution and a drain on
the overall water supply.
Raymond, who is also a private
caterer, said choosing a vegetarian
diet is a concrete step one person
can make toward saving the en
vironment.
The purpose of a cooking dem
onstration, she said, "is to show

how easy it is to cook vegetarian
food and how great it tastes .. .
it gives people the bridge between
wanting to be a vegetarian and
actually doing so."
She added that while environ
mental concerns are important,
there are also significant health
benefits derived from a vegetarian
diet. Avoiding meat, which is high
in fat and cholesterol, is "exactly

what health experts are telling us
to do," said Raymond.
But, how easy is it, actually, for
a vegetarian to survive on the
Stanford campus?
According to Lois Ohms,
dietician and assistant manager
of University Food Service, there
is always a vegetarian entree of
fered at Food Service lunches and
dinners. Ohms said Food Service

has tested several new recipes in
the past year, creating entrees
such as "oat burgers" — a dish
she claimed is very tasty
Singh said he gives Food Service
credit for trying to meet vegetar
ian needs, but added that all too
often dorm options contain too
much cheese and eggs, defeating
the idea of a diet low in fat and
cholesterol.

a vegetarian to survive on the
Stanford campus?
According to Lois Ohms,
dietician and assistant manager
of University Food Service, there
is always a vegetarian entree of
fered at Food Service lunches and
dinners. Ohms said Food Service

has tested several new recipes in
the past year, creating entrees
such as "oat burgers" — a dish
she claimed is very tasty
Singh said he gives Food Service
credit for trying to meet vegetar
ian needs, but added that all too
often dorm options contain too
much cheese and eggs, defeating
the idea of a diet low in fat and
cholesterol.

Now is the time many students'
thoughts begin to drift toward
[Domino's pepperoni pizza, Togo's
everything-on-it subs, and yes,
Food Service's "mystery meat."
Before you bite into that next
piece of pepperoni, however, take
note: World Vegetarian Day 1989
occurs Sun., Oct. 1, and in
celebration of the event, the Stan
ford Vegetarians and many other
co-sponsors have arranged an all
day symposium, entitled "Living
Lightly on the Earth — What One
Person Can Do."
The planned events, which will
take place in Dinkelspiel Audito
rium from 9:30 a.m.to 5 p.m., in
clude talks by Dr. Michael Klaper,
author and scientific director of
the environmental group
Earth Save; Jan Hartke, chair of
Earth Save and vice-chair of the
group Blueprint for the Environ
ment; and John Jeavons, execu
tive director of Ecology Action and
expert on biointensive farming.
Other features of the sympo
sium — which focuses on the en
vironmental aspects of vegetarian
eating — include a cooking dem
onstration by nutritionist and
cooking instructor Jennifer
Raymond, a vegetarian luncheon,

food tasting, panel discussions of
ethical, health and environmental
issues, and entertainment by
singer Alice Di Micele.
Admission is $8 for students
and senior citizens, and $12 for
community members.
The impetus behind such a
gathering is two-fold, according to
graduate student and Stanford
Vegetarians founding member In
der Singh. The groups' first ob
jective for the event is to create
a community for vegetarians on
campus — Singh estimates about
5 percent of the Stanford popula
tion is vegetarian.
The second objective "is to
make information accessible to
the public," Singh said. "Whether
someone is concerned with nutri
tion and wants to know more
about vegetarian alternatives, or
if they are more concerned with
the environment and would like
to know how eating habits affect
it, we [will] have something for
everybody."
Singh noted that 200 people are
already preregistered to attend
the symposium and estimated
that actual attendance will range
from 400 to 600 community mem
bers.
Stanford Vegetarians co
founder Lynn Gale said the plan
ners of last year's World Vegetar

ian Day symposium, attended by
over 300 people, tried to address
all the issues of vegetarianism
equally, from health benefits to
the ethical problems of "factory
farming."
This year, she said, "We thought
the environment was an appropri
ate theme because there has been
so much recent interest in envi
ronmental problems."
Singh added, "Most people
don't know the connection be
tween what we eat and how it
affects the environment." He ex
plained that problems ranging
from deforestation and soil ero
sion to the ever-dwindling supply
of fossil fuel are affected by a
person's decision to eat meat.
For example, Singh said, over
46 million acres of U.S. forest
have been converted to grazing
land for cattle in a period of seven
years.
Other environmental problems
affected by the production of meat
include the scarcity of fossil fuels,
water pollution and a drain on
the overall water supply.
Raymond, who is also a private
caterer, said choosing a vegetarian
diet is a concrete step one person
can make toward saving the en
vironment.
The purpose of a cooking dem
onstration, she said, "is to show

how easy it is to cook vegetarian
food and how great it tastes .. .
it gives people the bridge between
wanting to be a vegetarian and
actually doing so."
She added that while environ
mental concerns are important,
there are also significant health
benefits derived from a vegetarian
diet. Avoiding meat, which is high
in fat and cholesterol, is "exactly

what health experts are telling us
to do," said Raymond.
But, how easy is it, actually, for
a vegetarian to survive on the
Stanford campus?
