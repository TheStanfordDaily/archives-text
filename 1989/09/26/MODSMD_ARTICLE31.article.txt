## Sign-ups begin Thursday IMs kick off fall season with an array of athletics 
### Nat Cousins Editorial staff 
With a spirited Stanford theme of "have
fun" and "no forfeits," the intramural fall
sports season kicks off this week with a
full schedule of league registrations and
staff meetings.
Registration for all league sports will be
Thursday and Friday from 1 p.m. to 3 p.m.
in the intramural office, room 354 in En
cina Gym. However, lines for the popular
fall season usually begin forming in the
morning, and competition for the best
times often results in some of the longest
lines on campus.
"The intramural department apologizes
for the long lines when captains or man
agers sign up for team round-robin sports,"
said Howie Dallmar, University Intramural
Director. The IM staff starts sign-ups at 1
p.m. on Thursday of registration week and
finishes in about 90 minutes. "We are also
open to sign-ups on Friday at the same
time," Dallmer said.
According to Dallmar, 170 football teams,
140 four-player volleyball teams and 40
coed inner tube water polo squads will be
registered during the two-day period.
Coed leagues, often the most popular in
the intramural department, are scheduled
for football (four men and three women),
volleyball (two men and two women) and
inner tube water polo (four men and three
women).
"All teams are taken care of," Dallmar
stressed. "You may not receive your
preferred time but all are accommodated.
If you are put on a waiting list, it is only
to fill up leagues, and you are placed in a
league after the first week of round-robin,"
he said.
Basketball, often the most difficult ac
tivity to schedule because of the shortage
of suitable playing space, should be easier
to schedule now with the anticipated re
opening of Old Pavilion. Many varsity
sports will move their practices from
Maples Pavilion to Old Pavilion, "allowing
us to schedule basketball at more civilized
times," Dallmar added.
The staff will continue to crack down on
forfeits, despised by the intramural depart
ment. "Stanford has far less forfeits than
other universities of comparable enroll
ments, but that is certainly no excuse for
the. number -that we do have," Dallmar
continued.

'The purpose of the intra
mural sports program is to
provide every student and
staff member at Stanford
University the opportunity
to compete and participate
in an athletic or recreational
activity that he or she will
enjoy/

program is to provide every student and
staff member at Stanford University the
opportunity to "compete and participate in
an athletic or recreational activity that he
or she will ei\joy," wrote Dallmar in the
IM handbook.
"The activities encompassed provide keen
competition, exercise and social benefits
that cannot be found in any other part of
the educational program."
