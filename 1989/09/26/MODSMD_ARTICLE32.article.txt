# Football ticket sales skyrocket
## 
### Greg Gottesman Editorial staff 
It's hard to get excited about a 20-
yard end-around when no one is sit
ting in the seat next to you.
Cardinal football fans should not
have this problem in 1989.
According to ticket manager Konn
Rauschenbach, ticket purchases have
ballooned this year, surpassing esti
mated sales in some sections of Stan
ford Stadium by almost 170 percent.
Stanford students will buy approx
imately 5,500 season tickets this year,
compared to 3,572 last season.
Plan A sales, for non-students and
non-faculty members, have swelled
from 1988's mark of 12,500 to 13,500,
while Plan B purchases have moved
from 1,170 to 2,050.
Sales in faculty-staff plans also rose,
albeit not as dramatically Faculty
£taff Plan A ticket purchases increased

from 2,025 last season to 2,125. Plan
B sales jumped from 215 to 280.
According to Rauschenbach, the fact
that ticket applications were mailed
with the tuition packets represents a
big reason for the increase. "We made
it much more convenient," she said.
Junior linebacker Vince Lawler
added, "The new coach (Denny Green)
is mostly responsible for the sales.
Everybody is curious to see the
changes in our program."
"I think the increase is mainly be
cause a lot is expected out of us,"
junior strong safety Roger Valdovinos
said. "People are going to see a dif
ference, a big difference. It's already
evident, and the changes are for the
better."
Lawler said a large crowd does in
fluence play on the field. "The crowd
makes a huge difference. It gets your
adrenalin going to hear all that noise."
According to group sales coordina

tor Jim Dugoni, the recent increase
is not surprising. "In 1986, we went
to the Gator Bowl, so ticket sales went
up leading to the 1987 season," he
said. "When we didn't perform well,
sales went down for 1988. This year,
with the new coaching staff and prob
ably the best home schedule we have
had in a decade, we were bound to
have a pretty good year. If the team
starts improving iike it did against
Oregon, we can expect to do even bet
ter."
Despite the Notre Dame sellout Oc
tober 7, the first non-Big Game sellout
since 1980, students can still obtain
tickets to the game by purchasing a
season plan. Season tickets, which in
clude all five remaining home games,
cost $35. The price fora Notre Dame
ticket is $11, while a Big Game ticket
runs at $24. "You don't have to be a
Stanford graduate to figure out which
is the better deal," Rauschenbach said.
