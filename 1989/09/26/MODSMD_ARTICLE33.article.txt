Did everyone see the football game
Saturday? It was one of those once
in-a-lifetime type of comebacks
you read about but never have a chance
to see in person. It would be like going
to game one of last year's World Series
to see Gibson's homer, or sitting and
watching the Loyola Marymount hoop
team score 181 points against U.S. In
ternational, while giving up a mere 150.
Alright, maybe it wasn't quite that ex
citing, but it was definitely the best end
ing to a game in Stanford Stadium in
recent memory. Looking at the big pic
ture, however, what does it really mean?
I mean, is our football team good, lucky,
unlucky (remember Oregon State?), bad,
or what? Well, the great thing is, you
just don't know.
Everyone on the team obviously did
their part and, if Stanford plays
like it did Saturday, especially on
defense, the team could easily win six
games this year. Of course, 72 hours ago,

a lot of people were thinking the team
might not win any. But that's why they
play the games, I guess.
Under Coach Denny Green, the football
team has taken many strides in the right
direction. The first, and foremost, is by
signing one of the top recruiting classes
in the nation.
David Calomese. Glen Cavanaugh.
Dinny Hansen. Steve Hoyem. Glyn Mil
bum. Ellery Roberts. Remember those
names. None has played a down for the
Cardinal yet, but believe me, they can

play. And Green brought them here.
Green also brought his offensive
schemes. They didn't look too hot during
the Arizona and Oregon State games.
But Green appears to have finally
debugged his offense. Instead of execution
errors against Oregon Saturday, there
was only execution. In fact, the Stanford
offense executed the Ducks to the tune
of 414 yards.
There can be no doubt that the team
is getting better. With the schedule Stan
ford plays — it was ranked the third-most
difficult in the nation before the season
began — no game is a pushover and
Stanford might not win as many games
as is hoped around here.
No matter what, though, football
games are something that should
not be missed. Stanford is clearly
good enough to be in every game it plays,
and that leads to exciting football. If you
have read this far, you must be at least
a fair sports fan. As such, you must

And the best thing
about college athletics
is that there is at least
one sport for everyone,
in fact, there are about
four or five for most
people.

realize that college football is way more
exciting than the professional variety.
Okay, so the pros have Ickey and Ran
dall and Singletary and Rice. Watching
men indifferently earn their paychecks
by hitting each other repeatedly just does
not compare, however, to watching your
dormmates clobber and get clobbered by
their opponents with only personal and

school pride on their minds. Have you
ever seen NFL fans moved enough to
tear down goalposts?
Just a week ago, Southern Methodist
beat Connecticut, a mere Division II
school. Watching a team beat one of the
have-nots of the NFL is pretty boring,
but the Mustangs fans were so excited
they tried to tear down a goalpost. The
goalpost won, but you just can't get that
kind of crowd enthusiasm in pro sports.
Have you ever seen an NBA game com
pare to either Miracle at Maples I or II
(Freshman, ask your RAs about how
Todd the god scored 27 in the second
half to lead Stanford over 'Zona)?
And the best thing about college ath
letics is there is at least one sport for
everyone. In fact, there are about four
or five for most people.

play. And Green brought them here.
Green also brought his offensive
schemes. They didn't look too hot during
the Arizona and Oregon State games.
But Green appears to have finally
debugged his offense. Instead of execution
errors against Oregon Saturday, there
was only execution. In fact, the Stanford
offense executed the Ducks to the tune
of 414 yards.
There can be no doubt that the team
is getting better. With the schedule Stan
ford plays — it was ranked the third-most
difficult in the nation before the season
began — no game is a pushover and
Stanford might not win as many games
as is hoped around here.
No matter what, though, football
games are something that should
not be missed. Stanford is clearly
good enough to be in every game it plays,
and that leads to exciting football. If you
have read this far, you must be at least
a fair sports fan. As such, you must

Okay, so the pros have Ickey and Ran

men indifferently earn their paychecks
by hitting each other repeatedly just does
not compare, however, to watching your
dormmates clobber and get clobbered by
their opponents with only personal and

school pride on their minds. Have you
ever seen NFL fans moved enough to
tear down goalposts?
Just a week ago, Southern Methodist
beat Connecticut, a mere Division II
school. Watching a team beat one of the
have-nots of the NFL is pretty boring,
but the Mustangs fans were so excited
they tried to tear down a goalpost. The
goalpost won, but you just can't get that
kind of crowd enthusiasm in pro sports.

Did everyone see the football game
Saturday? It was one of those once
in-a-lifetime type of comebacks
you read about but never have a chance
to see in person. It would be like going
to game one of last year's World Series
to see Gibson's homer, or sitting and
watching the Loyola Marymount hoop
team score 181 points against U.S. In
ternational, while giving up a mere 150.
Alright, maybe it wasn't quite that ex
citing, but it was definitely the best end
ing to a game in Stanford Stadium in
recent memory. Looking at the big pic
ture, however, what does it really mean?
I mean, is our football team good, lucky,
unlucky (remember Oregon State?), bad,
or what? Well, the great thing is, you
just don't know.
Everyone on the team obviously did
their part and, if Stanford plays
like it did Saturday, especially on
defense, the team could easily win six
games this year. Of course, 72 hours ago,

a lot of people were thinking the team
might not win any. But that's why they
play the games, I guess.
Under Coach Denny Green, the football
team has taken many strides in the right
direction. The first, and foremost, is by
signing one of the top recruiting classes
in the nation.
David Calomese. Glen Cavanaugh.
Dinny Hansen. Steve Hoyem. Glyn Mil
bum. Ellery Roberts. Remember those
names. None has played a down for the
Cardinal yet, but believe me, they can

play. And Green brought them here.

schemes. They didn't look too hot during
