# Athletes of the Week
## 
### 
After a long (but not long enough) summer
vacation, The Daily's Athlete of the Week
award is back for its second year. Without
further ado, then, the Athletes of the Early
Part of September are Jennifer Rowland of
women's soccer and Gary Taylor of the foot
ball team.
Rowland, a 5-foot-4 junior forward from
Sacramento, Calif, has been the catalyst of

the women's soccer team's rise to a No. 7
national ranking. In seven games — the
team is 6-1 — Rowland has tallied nine
goals and three assists. She has scored a
goal in every game in which the Cardinal
hasn't been shut out.
What is most amazing about her goal total
is that Rowland led the team in scoring last
year with nine goals in 19 games.

Taylor, a 5-11, 197-pound sophomore
halfback from Mountain Home, Idaho, was
a key figure in the football team's amazing
come-from-behind 18-17 win over 22nd
ranked Oregon Saturday.
Things were looking pretty bleak as Stan
ford stared at a 17-0 deficit. The Cardinal
offense had managed only 10 points in 172
minutes of action. How was it supposed to
score 18 points in under eight minutes?
For starters, how about giving the ball to
Taylor? With the ball on the Duck 21, quar
terback Brian Johnson dropped back to pass.
He could find no one open downfield, so he
dumped the ball off to Taylor, who had
circled out of the backfield.
Taylor caught the swing pass with Derek
Horton in front of him. Taylor appeared to
take ofT for the middle of the field, but went
outside instead. Horton was frozen in his
tracks, Taylor had nothing but green in
between him and the end zone, and Stanford
was on the board.
Taylor, who has been listed behind Jon
Volpe, Charlie Young and Jay Jay Lasley

on the depth chart this season, scored the
touchdown that gave Stanford hope in a
game that seemed hopeless. The Cardinal
mounted two more drives and won the game
on the last play, a 37-yard John Hopkins
field goal.
Taylor, who was converted from quarter
back at his own request last year, ran for
23 yards on seven carries and caught three
passes for 46 total yards Saturday
