CINCINNATI (AP) - Boomer
Esiason threw three touchdown
passes and Jim Skow led a second
half defensive surge as the Cin
cinnati Bengals beat the Cleveland
Browns 21-14 Monday night,
handing Cleveland its first loss of
the season.
Esiason, who had just three TD
passes in nine previous games
against the Browns, matched that
output. He had second-quarter
scoring tosses of 8 and 16 yards
to tight end Rodney Holman, then
hit James Brooks with a 19-yarder
5:05 into the second half to put
the Bengals ahead for good.
But it took two late goal-line
stands by the Bengals to win it,
the second ending at the 3-yard
line with 1:41 left when Eric
Thomas knocked down a fourth
down pass.
Skow, meanwhile, was credited
with two sacks on Cleveland's
first two possessions of the second
half, giving Cincinnati good field
position both times. He also
dumped Tim Manoa for no gain
on a fourth-and-one at the Ben
gals' 9 with 7:62 left.
The first time Skow got a sack,
the Bengals capitalized, going 49
yards in six plays, capped by the
TD pass to Brooks from Esiason,
who finished with 14 completions

in 20 attempts for 104 yards, plus
34 yards rushing on five carries.
The second time, Jim Gallery, who
later blew a 44-yarder, missed a
48-yard field-goal attempt.
But it didn't matter as the de
fense almost completely shut
down Cleveland, sacking Bemie
Kosar six times and holding the
Browns without a first down in
both the first and third quarters.
Kosar, who threw for 163 yards
and two touchdowns in the first
half, finished with 15 completions
in 23 attempts for 203 yards.
It was the 11th straight home
win for the Bengals, now tied with
the Browns for first in the AFC
Central at 2-1. They got 78 yards
rushing from rookie Eric Ball,
replacing the injured Ickey Woods.
The Bengals had the ball all
but 3:22 of the first quarter but
couldn't score.
Then came four straight touch
downs on four straight posses
sions for the Ohio rivals.
Cincinnati started it, scoring
2:19 into the second period on an
8-yard pass to Holman. It came
at the end of a 49-yard, five-play
drive that featured a 31-yard pass
from Esiason to Tim McGee and
came one play after an illegal mo
tion penalty negated a 4-yard TD
pass to Eddie Brown.
