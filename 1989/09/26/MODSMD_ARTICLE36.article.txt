Think about it. If the athletes
can spend four or more hours a
day to practice their sport and
still get good grades, can't you
spend two hours watching them?
You don't need to tell your
parents you spent the whole
day watching the field
hockey game. Stanford academics
really isn't as tough as you think.
You'll have time to write that
paper after the game is over.
Come on. You can blow off that
problem set two hours to watch
a soccer game.
You only go to college once. If
you think about it, what are you
going to remember longer? How
to take a partial derivative? Or
watching that John Hopkins field
goal go through the uprights Sat
urday?
