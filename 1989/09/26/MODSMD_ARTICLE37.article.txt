Frustrating.
That's how many players on
the Stanford women's field
hockey team described Satur
day's double-overtime, sudden
death game against Chico State.
After 90 minutes of play, the
Cardinal emerged from its first
home game with a 0-0 tie.

Saturday's game

"We played pretty well
throughout the game," Coach
Sheryl Johnson said. Stan
ford's record is now 1-3-1 overall
and 1-1-1 in the Northern Pacific
Conference.
Johnson's defensive strategy
for the game included a halftime

position change, which placed
senior defender Michelanne
Baker on one of the Wildcats'
hot-shooting forwards. "Mic
helanne really took that player
out of the game and shut her
down," Johnson said. "She's our
best marker and really keeps the
defense organized."
In addition, Junior sweeper
Ellen Lee was able to lead the
Cardinal defense in foiling the
Wildcats' offensive strikes.
Also contributing to Stanford's
outstanding defense was
goalkeeper Caroline Clevenger.
Clevenger, a junior, neutralized
14 Wildcat shots during the
game.
"The team played very
strong," sophomore defender
Lara Filson said. "Against lowa,
we lost our endurance at the end
of the game. Against Chico
State, though, we stuck it out
through both of the overtimes."
The fourth-ranked Hawkeyes
defeated Stanford 4-1 Sept. 15
in a fast-paced match played on

the artifical surface at Califor
nia.
Despite fine defensive play,
however, Stanford failed to take
advantage of shooting opportu
nities Saturday, a problem which

has plagued the team through
out the season. Chico State took
30 shots during the game, eclips
ing the Cardinal's seven. Against
Pacific last Wednesday, Stanford
took 12 shots, the most this
season.
"Our team passes a lot," soph
omore forward Michelle Beynet
added. One of the team's top
scorers last year, Beynet went
on to explain that, although the
team can get the ball in front
of the goal, "sometimes we just
can't get our shots ofT."
"Chico State played an entirely
different game than we did,"
sophomore midfielder Susan
Leckrone said. "They would just
hit it and run, while we looked
for the pass more."
The Cardinal also is trying to
overcome a lack of experience
after losing seven seniors to
graduation.
"We have a very young team
this year, and we're still learn
ing," Johnson explained.
