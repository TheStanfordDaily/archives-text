### Alan Lewis 
University officials, faculty and
students welcomed new graduate
students at a convocation yester
day in Dinkelspiel Auditorium
and encouraged their transition
from learning as students to be
coming professionals and critical
scholars.
Administrators introduced the
students to Stanford's commit
ment to a multicultural commu
nity, while a graduate student
speaker criticized academia for of
ten training scholars to be disen
gaged from the process of social
transformation.
Elizabeth Traugott, vice
provost and dean of Graduate
Studies, introduced University
President Donald Kennedy, An
thropology Chair James Gibbs
and graduate students Sue
Kolodin and Laura Gomez to an
audience of about 250 graduate
students.
In her own speech, Traugott
specified Stanford's vision "to be
come a multicultural community:

one in which assimilation is no
longer the mode of thought, but
pluralism." She defined pluralism
as "understanding and respect for
the diverse views of people of all
colors, nations and creeds."
Traugott also encouraged stu
dents to pursue a "life of the
mind" — a necessity for both
learning and teaching — and chal
lenged them to reconcile their
individual identities with mem
bership in a culturally diverse
group. Students should rethink
the notion of community and nur
ture differences without creating
divisiveness, she said.
Kennedy likewise addressed the
Stanford community's current
transition toward diversity but
also focused on predicted in
creases in job opportunities for
graduates of higher education.
In contrast to the administra
tors' comments, Gomez, a gradu
ate student in sociology and law,
criticized academic communities
for their lack of minority faculty
and graduate students.
She also attacked the value

free, morally indifferent status of
the objective scholar who portrays
the world with clarity rather than
seeking to transform it. By re
taining subjectivity as an academ
ic, she said, one is "capable of
acting on and impacting the world
around us."
Gomez exhorted her fellow stu
dents not to concede to the "so
ciety of one" found in many
academic communities in which
tokenism and a loss of one's ex
periential ideas prevail. "When
Stanford fails to include all voices
in the academic discourse, it fails
in its primary mission to further
the search for knowledge and
truth," she warned.
Gibbs adopted a historical ap
proach and focused on the period
of colonization following the "dis
covery" of America by Columbus.
Gibbs dismissed the notion of
American culture as a "melting
pot" because he said this notion
views European culture as the as
similator and successor of Native
American and African-American
cultures.
