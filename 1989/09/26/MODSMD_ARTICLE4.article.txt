# Much ado about how much
## Administrators upset about salary printing 
### Jock Friedly Editorial staff 
University administrators are in a
fuss over their salaries, not because they
are too high or too low, but because
they are being published in newspapers
all over the country.
Reporters have published salaries of
top university administrators in the last
two weeks, after learning that even
private universities have to supply.somf 1
salary information in the publicly avail
able Internal Revenue Service Form
990.
In these disclosures, it was revealed
that Stanford pays some of its physi
cians well above what University Pres
ident Donald Kennedy takes home. In
fact, Dr. Norman Shumway, a leading
heart surgeon who took home $389,245
in 1987, was paid more than twice Ken
nedy's salary of $182,917. Kennedy is
also given free housing, a chef, a per
sonal assistant to his family, a
housekeeper, two groundskeepers and
a house manager.
Columbia University's president took
home $275,000, and presidents from
Boston University, the University of
Chicago and Howard University are
among those whose paychecks rank
above Kennedy's.
Lower down the list, Harvard Uni
versity president and Stanford alumnus
Derek Bok made $138,027, and Wash

ington University's president netted
only $99,999.96, the lowest salary in
the nation fora major private univer
sity.
Although Kennedy had to release his
1987 salary to comply with the law, he
told The Daily he would not reveal any
more than he has to, so he refused to
say what he is making this year until
the University submits its Form 990.
"I consider it an outrage," said W.
Glenn Campbell, former director of the
Hoover Institution, who earns some
$132,500. "They've always hidden the
president's salary around here."
The policy of not releasing adminis
trative salaries is a long-standing Uni
versity policy, not just with the
president's salary but with members of
the entire faculty and staff as well. Even
with a new federal law requiring all
private universities to disclose certain
top salaries, the University still takes
the position that nothing more than

the required amount will be released.
"It's generally considered a highly per
sonal matter," according to Stephen
Peeps, associate vice president for public
affairs.
The policy is at odds with Campbell's
view about his own salary, which is
supplemented by a car and driver, the
luxurious Hoover office, office staff and
his own parking spot. Campbell has al
ways disclosed his salary, which he said
rates well below the $160,000 average
for directors of comparable think tanks
in the country.
"It's crazy," he said last week. "They
should've been paying me more."
Now that Campbell has retired from
his Hoover directorship to a position of
counselor for life, he receives more
money than he ever did as director. His
1988 salary was $106,112, and even he

is puzzled why he gets much more
money now that he does much
less work.
Other top administrators'
salaries for 1987 include:
• David Korn, vice president
and dean of the School of Medicine
- $210,917
• James Rosse, vice president
and provost — $145,334
• William Massy, vice president
for business and finance —
$140,688
• John Schwartz, vice president
and general counsel — $132,042
• Robert Street, vice president
for information resources —
$125,917
• Robert Freelen, vice president
for public affairs — $111,396
• John Ford, vice president for

development — $96,375
The professors who earned the
most money at Stanford were:
• Surgery Prof. Norman Shum
way — $389,245 plus benefits of
$51,285
• Surgery Prof. Edward Stinson
— $352,137 plus benefits of
$46,491
• Surgery Prof. John Hanberry
— $343,764 plus benefits of
$45,878
• Surgery Prof. Philip Oyer —
$313,961 plus benefits of $42,355
• Surgery Prof. Gerald Silver
berg — $238,410 plus benefits of
$35,880
Stanford salaries depend on a
number of complex, interrelated
factors.
"We want to remain competitive
in the labor market," said Paul
Fearer, compensation manager of
Personnel Services. "We do a lot
of labor market analysis."
