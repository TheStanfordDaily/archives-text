Burst pipe douses computers
Several University computer systems were
down this weekend due to a flood affecting the
Academic Information Resources' computers, ac
cording to AIR Director Ralph Gorin.
The flood occurred late Saturday morning when
a hose supplying cold water burst in the Center
for Educational Research at Stanford, where the
computers are located.
The msyority of affected systems were opera
tional by Sunday afternoon. Some systems were
still down yesterday afternoon because scheduled
work on them was delayed when they were wet,
Gorin said. They were expected to be running
late yesterday.
Gorin said the damage was"in the small num
ber of thousands of dollars" and added that "ex
pert, attentive and swift help" was given by Uni
versity Plumbing and Electrical shops.
A second hose, the same age as the one that
burst, will be replaced to hopefully ensure the
future safety of the computers.
State majority leader offers class
This fall, Stanford undergraduates can learn
about public policy-making from one of
Sacramento's own movers and shakers.
Barry Keene, the majority leader of the Cali
fornia State Senate and a Stanford alumnus, will
teach Public Policy 184, "California State Gov
ernment: Politics, Policy, Performance." The
course will study the structure of decision making
and examine pending policy issues, includ
ing ethics in government, environmental regula
tion and the state budget.
Keene has served in the Senate since 1978 and
represents the northern California coast. He holds
both bachelor's and law degrees from Stanford.

Whatever happened to
.. .William Chace? The former Stanford Eng
lish professor and vice provost for academic plan
ning and development was inaugurated as pres
ident of Wesleyan University last Saturday.
In an address, Chace — whose inauguration
came 11 months after he officially took office
last October — called for Wesleyan to undertake
a revamping of its curriculum, place more em
phasis on undergraduate teaching and reiterate
its commitment to "true diversity."
"Diversity, genuinely understood and
embraced, is not casual liberal tolerance of any
thing and everything not yourself," Chace said.
"Instead, diversity is, in action, the sometimes
painful awareness that other people, other races,
other voices, other habits of mind, have as much
integrity of being, as much claim upon the world,
as you do."
Incidentally, for those who were wondering why
University President Donald Kennedy departed
early from Friday night's Orientation program,
he was hurrying to catch a plane. Kennedy was
a speaker at Chace's inauguration the next day.
Meal card photos to be retaken
For those who haven't heard, all students on
University Food Service need to get their meal
card photos retaken.
Food Service is changing management compan
ies for its meal card services, and the old cards
just won't do. Photos for new cards will be taken
at Larkin in Stern Hall this week, and all who
need them must smile for the camera before
noon Friday.
Students won't notice much difference in their
meals aside from the new cards. But the new
card company, CBORD of Ithaca, N.Y., will pro
vide Food Service with more statistics.
