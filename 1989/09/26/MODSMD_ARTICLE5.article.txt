# Public service requirement splits debaters
## 
### John Snyder 
A faculty debate on community service Sunday
began with both debaters taking the same position.
In fact, it took a question from a student in the
audience to engage the speakers in disagreement
and debate.
Speaking in Kresge Auditorium, Assoc. Dean of
the Law School Tom Mcßride and David Rosenhan,
professor of psychology and law, discussed the
proposition that "students who engage in community
service at the expense of scholarly excellence waste
their Stanford tuition." The debate was presented
as part of this year's freshman Orientation program.
In their opening remarks, both speakers agreed
that community service is an integral part of the
Stanford experience.
"You can't do it all from books, and you can't do
it all from community service," Rosenhan said about
learning in a college setting.
Mcßride echoed Rosenhan and even referred to
the debate as a "false dichotomy," a discussion be
tween two nearly identical positions.
