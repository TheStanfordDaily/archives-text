# Public service requirement splits debaters
## 
### John Snyder 
A faculty debate on community service Sunday
began with both debaters taking the same position.
In fact, it took a question from a student in the
audience to engage the speakers in disagreement
and debate.
Speaking in Kresge Auditorium, Assoc. Dean of
the Law School Tom Mcßride and David Rosenhan,
professor of psychology and law, discussed the
proposition that "students who engage in community
service at the expense of scholarly excellence waste
their Stanford tuition." The debate was presented
as part of this year's freshman Orientation program.
In their opening remarks, both speakers agreed
that community service is an integral part of the
Stanford experience.
"You can't do it all from books, and you can't do
it all from community service," Rosenhan said about
learning in a college setting.
Mcßride echoed Rosenhan and even referred to
the debate as a "false dichotomy," a discussion be
tween two nearly identical positions.
Expanding on Rosenhan's posi
tion, he added that many of Stan
ford's most outstanding students
have served the community.
Through effective time manage
ment, he said, "You can take your
passion, make it happen, you can
have it all."
The spark which eventually
revealed the differences in the
debaters' positions was a question
about the speakers' opinions on
the concept of a community serv
ice distribution requirement at
Stanford.
Mcßride was against such a re
quirement and said "the essence
of service is the voluntary quality"
and that much of the value of the
service would be lost if service
were required.
Mcßride said the courses he
teaches feature community serv
ice opportunities, and such an ap
proach is more effective than a
general requirement would be.
Rosenhan said that a commu
nity service requirement would be
a positive step. "Having been
forced, you get a chance to taste
it." This push would help shy or
lethargic students find the initia
tive to get out of their dorms and
get involved in the community, he
added.
When questioned, however,
Rosenhan said he did not support
linkage of public service to finan
cial aid because such a policy
would discriminate against those
receiving financial support.
