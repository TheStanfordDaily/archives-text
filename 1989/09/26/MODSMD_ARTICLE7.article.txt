# Faculty debate hearkens back to speech issue
## 
### Jill Daniels Staff writer 
Two Law School professors sparred over issues
of free speech and offensive expression Sunday in
a debate recalling last year's community discussion
on proposed interpretations of the Fundamental
Standard.
In the hour-long debate, Prof. Robert Weisberg,
a criminal law specialist, argued that speech should
be restricted when it infringes on other human
rights. Constitutional law Prof. William Cohen
maintained, however, that doing so would necessar
ily encroach upon political and artistic expression.
The event, sponsored by Residential Education
and held as part of the freshman Orientation pro
gram, was attended by more than 100 people in
Cubberley Auditorium.
Weisberg spoke first, reminding students of a May
1988 incident at Otero House that to some evoked
images of the Ku Klux Klan. (Seven masked fra
ternity members held a candelight vigil in support
of a student suspended from University housing for
homophobic actions.)
Weisberg also discussed an in
cident last October at Ujamaa
House in which two white Lagu
nita residents posted a racially of
fensive poster on a black student's
door.
"No one has an absolute right
to speak," Weisberg said. "Speech
can morally and properly be
restricted (when the words are)
verbal missiles aimed at injuring
others."
Cohen countered that assertion,
referring to the recent Supreme
Court decision permitting bur
ning of the flag in order to protect
political expression. "The argu
ment for banning (offensive
speech) at Stanford parallels Jus
tice (William) Rehnquist's opin
ion," Cohen said.
"If you start banning ideas, no
matter how vulgarly expressed,
you run into problems," he said.
He cited examples of how the
novel The Satanic Verses could

be offensive to Moslems, "The
Merchant of Venice" could be of
fensive to Jewish people and"The
Last Temptation of Christ" could
be insulting to fundamentalist
Christians.
In his rebuttal, Weisberg said
the Constitution reads, "Congress
shall make no law" prohibiting
free speech. He added that the
14th Amendment forces states to
comply with the above mandate.
However, Stanford is a private
university and consequently is not
bound to this rule, Weisberg ex
plained. The Fundamental Stand
ard debate last spring focused on
whether the University should
take advantage of this status and
the Standard more clear-cut
to explicitly make offensive acts
a violation.
The First Amendment "need
not be tolerated" when it allows
individuals to violate others'
rights to be free of racial harrass
ment, Weisberg suggested. By
limiting free speech, "Stanford
could become an oasis fora more
polite medium of exchange," he
said.
