Let Casio make your most complex courses look
easy. With simple-to-use scientific calculators
that offer high-powered features. Without the
high price.
Our 8-digit Solar Plus rM fx-300A is easy
to read and operates even in the dimmest light.
Its 128 functions make it a valuable addition
to virtually any math or science course. The
fx-300A performs statistical and fractional
calculations. And it stores six computations
in memory.
Fbr more power, tap into our Solar Plus
fx-115N. This 10-digit scientific calculator gives
you 154 functions. It offers computer math for
everything from binary to hexadecimal calcula
tions. Linear regression analysis. And an
applications workbook that makes the fx-115N
simple to use.
Our 12-digit fx-4200P data calculator is
in a class by itself. The dot matrix LCD lets you
see alpha-numeric formulas, names and tech
nical data exactly as written. The replay feature
prompts you to solve for different values of a
variable without inputting the formula each
time. Plus, there's a powerful 279-step memory
and 150 advanced functions.
No matter what courses you're taking
Casio has a scientific calculator t hat's of major
importance. At a price that's a minor subject.

Let Casio make your most complex courses look
easy. With simple-to-use scientific calculators
that offer high-powered features. Without the
high price.
Our 8-digit Solar Plus rM fx-300A is easy
to read and operates even in the dimmest light.
Its 128 functions make it a valuable addition
to virtually any math or science course. The
fx-300A performs statistical and fractional
calculations. And it stores six computations
in memory.
Fbr more power, tap into our Solar Plus
fx-115N. This 10-digit scientific calculator gives
you 154 functions. It offers computer math for
everything from binary to hexadecimal calcula
tions. Linear regression analysis. And an
applications workbook that makes the fx-115N
simple to use.
Our 12-digit fx-4200P data calculator is
in a class by itself. The dot matrix LCD lets you
see alpha-numeric formulas, names and tech
nical data exactly as written. The replay feature
prompts you to solve for different values of a
variable without inputting the formula each
time. Plus, there's a powerful 279-step memory
and 150 advanced functions.
No matter what courses you're taking
Casio has a scientific calculator t hat's of major
importance. At a price that's a minor subject.
