Smith Corona presents three products that can
help make school work academic.
The Smith Corona PWP 2000 Personal Word
Processor is in a class by itself. It's so compact it can
fit in the most compact dorm room. Yet, thanks to
features like a built-in disk drive, 100,000 character
Data Disk capacity, and a crystal clear display, it
makes it easy to transform B s into As.
For those who prefer an electronic typewriter,
the Smith Corona XD 4600 is the typewriter of
preference. With its 16 character display and ap
proximately 7,000 characters of editable memory,
you can have the convenience of word processing
features with the simplicity of a typewriter.
Of course, the pocket-size Spell-Right" 300P
also comes with impeccable references. In this
case, a built-in electronic dictionary, a thesaurus,
a calculator, even a collection of challenging
word games.
So if you're thinking Magna Cum Laude at
the end of this year, -rrnnc.
