# Budget deficit hits Tresidder
## 
### Elizabeth Howton Editorial staff 
Tresidder Union hasn't made any money for
several years, but with the recent management chan
geover the pinch will be felt in Tresidder's budget
rather than by an outside corporation.
The deficit for fiscal year 1989-90 will be about
$210,000 — 10 percent of Tresidder's $2 million
budget, according to Tresidder Director Bobbi
Braden.
Tresidder plans to change its hours of operation,
reduce operating expenses, impose a hiring freeze
and call for voluntary transfers and retirements in
order to reduce the budget deficit.
"Only after exploring these options will we con
sider enforced layoffs," Braden said.
The deficit results from a change in the relation
ship between Tresidder and its food service provider.
When Marriott Corp. was the contractor, it guar
anteed Tresidder a fixed annual return, regardless
of how much the food services were actually making.
The company decided to pull out of Tresidder last
spring because it was losing large amounts of money
— about $400,000 annually, by Braden's estimate.
With Bon Appetit Co., however, Tresidder simply
pays the company a fee to manage the food services
and then Tresidder takes the bottom line for itself
— whether it's a profit or a loss.
For this year, that figure is about $150,000 less
than what Tresidder received from Marriott, and
it's likely to continue to be a loss for at least the
next two or three years, Braden said. "We're hoping
it will turn around, but realistically we don't think
we'll see any real growth for a couple of years,"
she said.
Another factor producing the deficit is the lower
rent Tresidder will be receiving for The Store's
space. Tresidder does not set the rent for the space,
but contracts to the highest bidder, which was the
Stanford Bookstore.
The annual revenues from The Store — now
called Tresidder Express — will be about $70,000
less this year than they were under Marriott.
However, Braden said she feels that in the long
run, Tresidder will become more profitable because
of the new management. Part of the problem after
Marriott took over from Saga Corp. in 1985, she
said, was "there was a perception that service was
getting worse."
Some students disliked the impersonal feeling that
resulted from Tresidder being run by a large cor
poration. Bon Appetit, a much smaller, locally-owned
company, is expected to reverse that trend.
Braden said the "fairly cosmetic" renovations that
have taken place in the past month are not a sig
nificant cause of the deficit and will be paid for
out of Tresidder's reserves.
However, capital expenses of the larger changes
that are tentatively scheduled for later this year or
next summer will be paid for largely from University
facilities reserves and the Bookstore's contract with
Tresidder, with only a small amount coming out of
Tresidder's reserves.
Those changes are also expected to increase Tres
idder's revenues. They include moving Tresidder
Express into the space vacated by the LOTS-2 com
puter cluster, expanding Tresidder's kitchen into
the Tresidder Express space and possibly moving
the Corner Pocket closer to the kitchen and the
pizza ovens.
Braden noted that Tresidder's kitchen has not
been remodeled since it was built 27 years ago.
