# Ex-frosh fraternize in Frost
## Screams and smiles characterize Sophomore Celebration 
### Doug Fine 
An emotional scene of friend
meeting long-missed friend
greeted the onlooker at Frost Am
phitheater yesterday as the Soph
omore Celebration took place in
the waning hours of the day.
According to coordinator Kris
tin Strout, the event served as a
single "welcome" opportunity for
sophomores amid a "huge abun
dance" of freshman welcoming ac
tivities.
Students clustered around signs
naming their previous year's
dorms, and by 4:45 p.m., the
screaming recognition of last
year's hallmate was a common
sound.
Even the transfers got into the
act, although their reminiscing
was of locations such as as Co
lumbia and UCLA rather than
Stanford. A few sarcastic, "I
missed you so much!" comments
were, however, overheard in the
transfer section.
University President Donald
Kennedy opened the event, calling
the sophomore year "a time for
fewer, perhaps stronger friend
ships," and added that the second
year of college can be "possibly
discouraging." He urged the stu

dents to search for the domain of
intellectual commitments without
gearing their education solely
toward occupational areas.
Kennedy's speech was followed
by Dean of Undergraduate
Studies Thomas Wasow's
humorous explanation of the
etymology of the word "sopho
more." Wasow explained the
apparent dichotomy of the word,
pointing out that "soph" was from
the Latin word for wise and
"more" from the Latin for moron.
Wasow finished by recognizing
the Boothe Prize winners for writ
ing and Western Culture.
Junior Allison May spoke of
ways to avoid the dreaded "soph
omore slump," a subject about
which she said she was very
knowledgeable. May told a story
about her sophomore year, during
which she missed midterms,
dropped two of four classes and
wasn't speaking to her parents.
May said that following a spon
taneous road trip to Seattle, she
re-evaluated her situation. She
took her midterms, declared a
and re-established ties with
her family.
The organized portion of the
event culminated with the reading
of the names of the 50 President's

Award winners, given to sopho
mores for outstanding academic
performance during their fresh
man year. As Kennedy read off
the names of the winners, dorms
cheered enthusiastically for mem
bers of their previous year's res
idence.
Finally, Kennedy announced
that the speeches were over, and
the students immediately jumped
up to nearby tables of boxed din
ners and soda.
For most students, the event
was a success not because of
speeches or awards, but for the
chance to see old friends and
ponder the limited amount of time
left on the Farm. Sophomore
Anne Blanche Adams probably
said it best: "The best part was
seeing all my friends from Toyon,
reminiscing and asking them
about their summers."
