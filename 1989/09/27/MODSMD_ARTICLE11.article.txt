## Hungary liberalizes laws 
### 
BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) — Par
liament yesterday adopted liberal laws
that guarantee the rights of Hungarians
to travel abroad and even to emigrate.
The session that opened yesterday is
to decide a series of key bills designed
to pave the way for next year's elections,
the first in more than 40 years that will
be freely contested by more than one
party.
The volume of legislation led deputies
to vote for extending the session past
Friday, when it had been set to end.
The house also was to review changes
in the penal code this week but
postponed until Oct. 17 discussion of
other key bills, including a law on the
functioning of political parties, an elec
toral law and constitutional changes that
will remove references to the leading
role of the Communist Party.
The Communists have committed
themselves to multiparty elections and
have pledged to go into opposition if
they lose.
More than 70 percent of the 387 par
liament deputies are Communist Party
members.
In the past, Hungary's Parliament met
four times a year for less than a week,
essentially rubber-stamping the Commu
nist government's policies.
In recent months, however, indepen
dents and some reform-minded Commu
nist members of Parliament have
sparked considerable debate and even
forced revisions on some key legislation.
The new laws adopted yesterday lift
most restrictions on travel, meaning
that Hungarians no longer need to seek
permission from authorities for foreign
travel or emigration, and that Hun
garians who emigrated — even those
who were forced to because of their po

litical views — may return at any time.
The laws take effect Jan. 1.
Interior Minister Istvan Horvath told
a news confernce after the bills were
adopted that "Freedom of movement is
no longer dependent on the arbitrariness
of the authorities."
He said the new bills were in line
with the Universal Declaration of
Human Rights.
Hungary's emerging liberal policies
were demonstrated by the government's
decision to remove the barbed wire and
other obstacles along its western border
with Austria, and to allow thousands of
East Germans seeking to emigrate to
the West to cross legally into Austria.
The decision this month to let the
East Germans go has deeply angered
Hungary's hard-line East bloc allies.
Also yesterday, four opposition mem
bers became the first freely elected non-
Communists to take their seats in the
house since the Communists con
solidated power in 1948. They won a
majority vote in recent freely contested
by-elections.
"Never in the past 42 years was being
an MP such an honor," said Gabor Ros
zik, one of the opposition members.
"We can all be proud regardless of
how we got here, to be able to participate
in this transition," he said.
Roszik, who was accompanied to the
session by a group of supporters waving
Hungarian flags, said the participation
of the four opposition members marked
"one of the most significant steps of the
revolution under way in Hungary, as we
move from dictatorial socialism to de
mocracy. "
The fall session of Parliament was
marked by another first. An electronic
voting system was installed to ensure
an accurate count.
