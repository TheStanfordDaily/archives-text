# East Germans leave embassy
## Accept amnesty offer, guaranteed emigration 
### 
PRAGUE (AP) - About 130 East Ger
man refugees out of about 1,200 camped
out in the West German Embassy garden
left the compound yesterday to accept an
offer of guaranteed emigration within six
months of returning home.
But refugees estimated that about 120
ucwcoiiiyra scaled the embassy fence yes
leraay. New "refugees arrived while people
boarded buses to leave at the other end of
the compound.
East German emissary Manfred Vogel
said those willing to return could emigrate
without facing prosecution for "flight from
the republic" and other offenses.
The 130 or so refugees left the embassy
in two buses and private cars, and spokes
men said an additional 100 intend to follow
them today.
The flow of East German refugees into
Poland also increased yesterday, with some
camping out on streets near the West Ger
man Embassy in Warsaw, uncertain where
they would spend the night. The number
of refugees appeared to have risen to more
than 400 people. Newcomers registered
with West German officials at a kiosk near
the embassy staffed by a member of the
diplomatic staff.
On the Austrian border with Hungary,
authorities said yesterday that the number
of East Germans crossing into Austria since
Hungary opened its borders for them stood
at 21,424 yesterday morning, about 950
more than the day before.
From Austria, the East Germans rapidly

proceed to West Germany, which offers
them immediate citizenship.
Refugees said East German emissaries
in Prague would hold two sessions today
to submit their offer for more people to
vacate the West German mission and go
home.
All East German citizens who announce
themselves ready to leave the Bmtn Km- 1
bassy receive a piece of paper to serve as
a document for them to cross the East
German border without trouble at two
checkpoints.
Spokesmen for the refugees who took
part in the negotiations said Vogel issued
a written guarantee which was handed over
to West German government officials
taking part in the talks.
The guarantee reportedly stipulates the
right to emigrate within six months after
returning to East Germany.
Even while Vogel conferred with the ref
ugees, newcomers arrived, most of them
families with children.
The embassy in Warsaw, crowded with
refugees, was closed last week to prevent
more people from entering. At least some
of the newly arrived East Germans were
told to fend for themselves Monday evening
in finding a place to sleep.
Part of the overflow was absorbed by a
former seminary at Tarchomin, just outside
Warsaw, lent by Roman Catholic Church
officials to the West German authorities.
There the number of East German in
habitants was up to 152 yesterday, com
pared to just 16 a week ago.
