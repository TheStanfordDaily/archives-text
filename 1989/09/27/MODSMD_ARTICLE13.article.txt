# Americans killed in Philippines
## Gunmen ambush civilian workers on eve of Quayle visit 
### 
MANILA, Philippines (AP) — Gun
men believed to be Communist rebels
ambushed and killed two American
civilians working at a U.S. military base
yesterday, shortly before Vice President
Dan Quayle arrived to discuss the future
of U.S. military installations in the
Philippines.
Today, Quayle condemned the killings
as "cowardly murders" and said the
slayings will "only serve to strengthen"
U.S. support for President Corazon
Aquino.
The victims were employees of Ford
Aerospace Corp., which contracts to
maintain an electronic warfare training
range at Camp O'Donnell. The camp is
a U.S.-run facility about 50 miles north
of Manila and 12 miles from the U.S.
Clark Air Base.
Ford Aerospace spokesman Norman
Black identified the victims as William
Thompson, 45, and Donald Buchner, 44.
He said both were retired from the U.S.
Air Force. Their hometowns were not
known.
Also yesterday, gunmen killed a mem
ber of President Aquino's presidential
guard, about a mile from where the
president will meet with Quayle today.
The attacks followed a series of bom
bings this month and came amid
growing opposition to U.S. military in
stallations in the Philippines.
The Americans slowed their car as
they approached a dump truck and a
jeep blocking a highway near Capas, 60
miles north of Manila, police said. Six
men sprang from the jeep and riddled
their car with gunfire, according to
police Lt. Pepito Pimentel.
The assailants then opened the car
door and pumped bullets into the vic
tims, Pimentel said. The attack occurred
about 5 p.m.
"We deplore this senseless and
cowardly act of terrorism," State De
partment spokesman Richard Boucher
said in Washington. "Acts like this will

not deter us in our resolve to support
the democratic government in the
Philippines."
Col. Florentino Amorabon, a spokes
man for the Philippine Constabulary in
central Luzon island, said the assassins
were believed to be members of the
New Peoples Army, which operates in
the area.
In April, rebels killed U.S. Army Col.
James Rowe as he was driving to the
headquarters of the U.S. Joint Military
Assistance Group in Quezon City, near
Manila. In October 1987, rebels killed
three Americans in simultaneous at
tacks outside Clark Air Base.
The United States operates Clark Air
Base, the Subic Bay naval base and four
smaller installations in the Philippines,
but there are increased calls for an end
to the U.S. military presence.
As Quayle arrived, hundreds of lef
tists burned his effigy and an American
flag while chanting "Bases out! Quayle
go home!"
Quayle arrived in Manila about 7:30
p.m. from Japan for a visit expected to
focus on the future of the bases, which
operate under a lease that expires in
September 1991.
In a speech Wednesday to a business
group, Quayle deplored the killings.
"It should go without saying that

these cowardly murders deserve the
strong condemnation of all civilized men
and women," Quayle said. "The people
of the Philippines, like the the people
of the United States, are sickened by
the acts of vicious terrorists who wish
to drown freedom in the blood of inno
cent men and women."
Acting Foreign Secretary Manuel Yan
said Quayle was bringing a letter from
President Bush believed to include a
proposal to begin talks on extending the
lease.
Two hours before Quayle's arrival,
about 150 members of the League of
Filipino Students and the Youth for
Nationalism and Democracy reached the
airport terminal and began a noisy dem
onstration against the visit.
Protesters shouted "Quayle go home,
bases out!" and "Yankees go home!"
They carried banners reading "Quayle
visit — a curse."
After negotiations with police, the
group agreed to pull back about a half
mile away along the main road into
Manila. Police estimated the crowd grew
to nearly 1,000 by the time Quayle ar
rived.
Earlier, nine policemen were injured
and nine students were arrested when
security forces broke up a rally at
Manila's Adamson University, officials
said.
Also Tuesday, suspected rebels killed
Capt. Carlos Daileg, a staff officer of
the Presidential Security Group, in an
ambush in the city's Pandacan district.
He was the fourth member of the pres
idential guard slain in the past four
months.
That killing occurred about one mile'
southeast of where the president will!
hold talks with Quayle on Wednesday. ;

not deter us in our resolve to support
the democratic government in the
Philippines."
Col. Florentino Amorabon, a spokes
man for the Philippine Constabulary in
central Luzon island, said the assassins
were believed to be members of the
New Peoples Army, which operates in
the area.
In April, rebels killed U.S. Army Col.
James Rowe as he was driving to the
headquarters of the U.S. Joint Military
Assistance Group in Quezon City, near
Manila. In October 1987, rebels killed
three Americans in simultaneous at
tacks outside Clark Air Base.
The United States operates Clark Air
Base, the Subic Bay naval base and four
smaller installations in the Philippines,
but there are increased calls for an end
to the U.S. military presence.
As Quayle arrived, hundreds of lef
tists burned his effigy and an American
flag while chanting "Bases out! Quayle
go home!"
Quayle arrived in Manila about 7:30
p.m. from Japan for a visit expected to
focus on the future of the bases, which
operate under a lease that expires in
September 1991.
In a speech Wednesday to a business
group, Quayle deplored the killings.
"It should go without saying that

these cowardly murders deserve the
strong condemnation of all civilized men
and women," Quayle said. "The people
of the Philippines, like the the people
of the United States, are sickened by
the acts of vicious terrorists who wish
to drown freedom in the blood of inno
cent men and women."
Acting Foreign Secretary Manuel Yan
said Quayle was bringing a letter from
President Bush believed to include a
proposal to begin talks on extending the
lease.
Two hours before Quayle's arrival,
about 150 members of the League of
Filipino Students and the Youth for
Nationalism and Democracy reached the
airport terminal and began a noisy dem
onstration against the visit.
Protesters shouted "Quayle go home,
bases out!" and "Yankees go home!"
They carried banners reading "Quayle
visit — a curse."
After negotiations with police, the
group agreed to pull back about a half
mile away along the main road into
Manila. Police estimated the crowd grew
to nearly 1,000 by the time Quayle ar
rived.
Earlier, nine policemen were injured
and nine students were arrested when
security forces broke up a rally at
Manila's Adamson University, officials
said.
Also Tuesday, suspected rebels killed
Capt. Carlos Daileg, a staff officer of
the Presidential Security Group, in an
ambush in the city's Pandacan district.
He was the fourth member of the pres
idential guard slain in the past four
months.

southeast of where the president will!

MANILA, Philippines (AP) — Gun
men believed to be Communist rebels
ambushed and killed two American
civilians working at a U.S. military base
yesterday, shortly before Vice President
Dan Quayle arrived to discuss the future
of U.S. military installations in the
Philippines.
Today, Quayle condemned the killings
as "cowardly murders" and said the
slayings will "only serve to strengthen"
U.S. support for President Corazon
Aquino.
The victims were employees of Ford
Aerospace Corp., which contracts to
maintain an electronic warfare training
range at Camp O'Donnell. The camp is
a U.S.-run facility about 50 miles north
of Manila and 12 miles from the U.S.
Clark Air Base.
Ford Aerospace spokesman Norman
Black identified the victims as William
Thompson, 45, and Donald Buchner, 44.
He said both were retired from the U.S.
Air Force. Their hometowns were not
known.
Also yesterday, gunmen killed a mem
ber of President Aquino's presidential
guard, about a mile from where the
president will meet with Quayle today.
The attacks followed a series of bom
bings this month and came amid
growing opposition to U.S. military in
stallations in the Philippines.
The Americans slowed their car as
they approached a dump truck and a
jeep blocking a highway near Capas, 60
miles north of Manila, police said. Six
men sprang from the jeep and riddled
their car with gunfire, according to
police Lt. Pepito Pimentel.
The assailants then opened the car
door and pumped bullets into the vic
tims, Pimentel said. The attack occurred
about 5 p.m.
