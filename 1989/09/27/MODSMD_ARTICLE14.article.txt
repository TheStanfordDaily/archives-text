S. African detainee freed
(AP) — Authorities have released a
prominent anti-apartheid activist who
went on a hunger strike after being
detained without charge last month,
his attorney said.
Trevor Manuel, who was freed yes
terday, is one of the top-ranking
leaders in Cape Town of the banned
United Democratic Front, the coun
try's largest anti-apartheid coalition.
Manuel, who has been detained pre
viously, was held in the central city
of Bloemfontein and refused to eat
for two weeks of his 30-day confine
ment, attorney Essa Moosa said.
Before his most recent detention,
Manuel was under police restrictions
that limited his movements. Moosa
said he did not know if any new re
strictions had been placed on his
client.
Many activists have ignored the
police orders as part of a nationwide
defiance campaign that began in Au
gust.
The government released hundreds
of detainees earlier this year after they

launched a hunger strike, and only a
few dozen were being held without
1 Mi i
However, human rights groups es
timate that the number has risen to
about 250. More than 30,000 people
have been detained without charge for
varying lengths of time under the
three-year-old state of emergency.
In other developments yesterday,
the Appeal Court in Bloemfontein
ruled that employees may not be
forced to work overtime.
The Congress of South African
Trade Unions, the country's largest
black labor federation, has called on
members not to work overtime to
protest a controversial labor law that
limits the? ability of unions to strike.
South African Breweries contested
the union's decision, but the Appeal
Court said no worker could be "com
pelled to perform work he is not con
tractually obliged to do."
