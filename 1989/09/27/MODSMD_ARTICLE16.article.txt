## Hail, Kimball hail! 
### 
THE MONEY FINALLY came
Thanks to the generous
donation of alumnus William Kim
ball, Stanford can start building
the $10 million dorm that will help
bring the simple dream of four
years of guaranteed housing closer
to reality.
It will also move the University
closer to removing all the Manzan
ita trailers — the "temporary
housing" units built 20 years ago.
Kimball's donation of $3 million
follows on the heels of $4 million
put forward by Trustees Peter
Bing and Thomas Ford in June.
But much of the credit should
go to the donor of the smallest
chunk — the Class of 1989. Their
$50,000 pledge has led to —
abracadabra — $7 million in
alumni donations.
Students listed undergraduate
housing as their highest priority
next to undergraduate scholarships
for the Centennial Campaign
fundraising. But the University
had to drop new housing as a

fundraising goal last February be
cause they supposedly could not
find any alumni who shared the
students' concern.
Unless other generous alumni
miraculously appear, students will
have to put their money where
their mouths are — by providing
the remaining $3 million through
higher room and board bills.
When Kimball opens in 1991, it
will provide a net of 140 spaces
for the 400 or so undergrads who
do not get assigned through the
Draw. The 200-bed dorm will
replace 20 Manzanita trailers,
which house three people each.
Last fall, when Rains Houses
opened for graduate students, 200
new spaces for undergrads were
created at no extra cost to students.
Rains was financed through the
issuing of public bonds.
Of course, it's hard to ask for
new housing for free. Budget con
straints are tight all over the Uni
versity, but undergraduate housing
should be given high priority. The
students think so, and now so do
the alumni.
