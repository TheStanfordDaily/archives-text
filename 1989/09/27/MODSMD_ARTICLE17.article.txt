# A 						Renovated Roble
## 
### 
WITH THE renaissance of
Roble Hall, residential life
returns to one of the most
popular dormitories on campus.
Considering the University's
track record on some construction
projects, including last year's long
delays on the Lomita Mall utilities
project, many held their breath
when the University promised to
have Roble finished by September.
Count at least 280 prospective
Roble residents in that figure.
But the University's Project
Manager Jonathan Ryan and the
contractor, Overaa Construction
Company, saw the project through
â€” getting it completed only 10 days

late and nearly on budget.
The workers themselves deserve
much of the credit. Both Ryan and
resident fellow Ann Porteus gave
praise all around for the renova
tion.
Some minor problems remain,
but residents were anticipating
them. The staff of Roble has
responded to residents' complaints
swiftly in most cases.
The sign that declared the dorm
"Rubble Hall" will live in the
minds of most Stanford students
for years, but at least for this year,
280 students will not have to live
in remodeled study rooms.
