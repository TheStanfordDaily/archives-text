## Daily photo misrepresents message of â€˜Princess' 
### 
We were happy to be a part of
"The Fire Within." However,
we were disappointed with the
coverage of the program that appeared
in The Daily on Tuesday. It seems The
Daily missed the point of the entire
program.
We are particularly disappointed with
the segment on the Stanford American
Indian Organization. The paper was
eager to plaster an eight-inch by six
inch picture of the fictional character
"Princess Twanapokatotalot" that we
recreated in order to make a point.
However, there was no explanation of
the role the "Princess" played in the
speech that was presented.
The Daily should have done one of
two things. First, since the article
included no mention of the ficticious
"Princess," The Daily should not have
put the picture in the paper. Second, a

As it was published,
the Daily represented
our entire presentation,
as well as the SAIO,
with an oversized
Enquirer-style picture.

brief caption should have been included
under the picture. Both of these op
tions seem to be obvious.
As is, it appears as if the ficticious
"Princess" was performing some mysti
cal ritual at "The Fire Within." Per
haps people, especially those who did

not attend, thought that she had some
thing to do with the Pueblo dances
that were performed.
We "invited" "Princess
Twanapokatotalot" to translate my
speech into "Hollywood Injun English"
in order to mock those "Injuns" who
only "live" in the Media. She repre
sented the stereotype American culture
still perpetuates today, one we are
trying so hard to combat because it
demeans our heritages and identities as
Native Americans.
The point of the "Princess" was to
exaggerate the stereotype to such an
extent that its ludicrousness would
become obvious to the observers. In
other words, The Daily didn't get the
point of the presentation it was suppos
edly covering.
As it was published, The Daily repre
sented our entire presentation, as well

as the SAIO, with an oversized
Enquirer-style picture. It is ironic that
what we have to say about the issues
that affect us, what we struggle for in
order to change, and how we celebrate
and keep our culture alive were repre
sented by a large picture of the main
stream stereotype of Native Americans.
That image died in our presentation.
When Marcy Harris-Babcock, Alaskan
Tlingit, took off her black wig, blue
and yellow feathers and elastic head
band that she bought at the drug
store, she symbolized the death of the
Hollywood Ir\jun. You missed the point
On Tuesday, The Stanford Daily, as a
representative of the mass media, kept
that image alive.
