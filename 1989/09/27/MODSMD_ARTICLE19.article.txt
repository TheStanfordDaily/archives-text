# Kennedy overpaid vs. UC's administrators
## 
### 
The story about administrators'
salaries in yesterday's Daily has in
trigued me so much that I am writing
my second letter to the Daily in two
days. This will only be my third letter
in thirty years — the previous one
having been written some time in
1968, if my memory serves me correct
ly-
As you may know, distinguished
public universities such as the Univer
sity of California have long made their
salaries public. In the fiscal year 1989
Chancellor Ira Heyman at UC-Berkeley
and Chancellor Charles Young at
UCLA made $142,900 each. In the
Current fiscal year they will make
$163,600 each.

My question is: who is overpaid —
University President Donald Kennedy
at $182,716 and probably rising to
$200,000 in the current year or these
men at UC-Berkeley and UCLA?
In my opinion, the answer is obvious
since all three people have approxi
mately equal perks, such as free
housing, food and beverage, etc. In
addition UC-Berkeley is always rated
as the number one research university
in the country in the various surveys
of the past decades, and UCLA is not
far behind.
Incidentally, the president of the UC
system, David Gardner, will be making
$230,600 this academic year. Virtually
all the Regents, including myself, feel
that if anything, he is underpaid, since
he is the president of a university sys
tem which is about seven times as
large as Stanford University and which
raises $365 million per annum in

private gifts (alirost twice the Stanford
total).
