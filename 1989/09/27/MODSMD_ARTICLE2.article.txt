# University cancels talks with USW
## Union charges gender discrimination 
### Mike Friedly Staff writer 
The United Stanford
Workers union presented the
bad news and the good news
at a press conference yesterday:
They asserted that women are
paid less than men for compa
rable work at Stanford, but
they announced that a long
delayed arbitration session
with the University addressing
the issue would take place
today.
Later yesterday, however,
the University Legal Office
abruptly canceled the sched
uled arbitration session, citing
conflicts with another arbitra
tion case.
According to Deborah Britt,
a technician who spoke at the
press conference, the Medical
Center's life science tech
nicians, whose job entails treat

ing animals used in medical
research, have the same level
of expertise as science and en
gineering technicians, but are
paid between seven and 21 per
cent less.
Because of the similarity in
job descriptions, the USW con
tends the jobs are comparable,
although science and engineer
ing technicians work with mac
hines instead of animals.
Britt and the USW maintain
that the difference in pay is
the result of sex discrimina
tion.
While 81 percent of life sci
ence technicians are women, 91
percent of the science and en
gineering technicians are men.
Because the Medical Center
requires two years of college
and two years of vocational
training, the educational levels

for the life science technicians are
on average greater than that of
the science and engineering tech
nicians. The latter position re
quires only two years of vocational
education and departments
throughout the University hire
these technicians.
The USW says it first filed a
grievance on this issue with the
University in 1983, and the case
was scheduled to be arbitrated
today and tomorrow.
At 4 p.m. yesterday, however,
the Legal Office abruptly canceled
both days of the grievance
hearing. USW attorney James Eg
gleston was informed by telephone
that the University was busy with
"other matters of collective bar
gaining," according to Eggleston.
Eggleston added that the Uni
versity has canceled grievance
hearings several times in the past
six years, while the USW has can
celed the arbitration on only one
occasion because of a personal
emergency.
After the cancellation, the USW
yesterday accused the University
of "legal obstructionism" to delay
the hearing. USW President Alan
Wagner cited last year's lengthy
arbitration, which concluded the
case should be arbitrated, as an
example of the University's efforts

to block the grievance process.
University Legal Office Staff
Counsel Michael Vartain did not
return phone calls yesterday to
respond to the charges, but Uni
versity lawyer Susan Hoerger said
the wages earned by life science
technicians are the result of ne
gotiations and collective bargain
ing between the University and
the USW.
The different wages have no
bearing on gender issues, Hoerger
said.
USW member Michael Tatham
charged that the University ad
ministrators are "liars, are afraid
to face the issue, and are sexist"
for postponing the arbitration.
The sudden cancellation
"proves exactly what we're say
ing" about University efforts to
block the hearings, according to
Britt. She charged that the Uni
versity is trying to break down
the will of those filing the suit so
that the case will be dropped.
The University is currently in
the midst of another labor rela
tions negotiation with the Stan
ford police. According to USW
member Michael Tatham, the
University canceled the negotia
tions with the USW because of
the work on the police hearings.
Hoerger, who is handling both
the USW hearings and the police
department case, confirmed that
today is being reserved for nego
tiations between the police and

the University. "The University
does not like taking arbitration
off the schedule," Hoerger said,
but it occasionally does so under
emergency circumstances.
However, Hoerger gave no ex
planation why the University can
celed tomorrow's arbitration. The
police department has informed
the University that it would not
be available for arbitration on
Thursday, for reasons of public
safety.
Hoerger would not specify the
nature of the work being done on
the police department case be
cause of an agreement between
the University and the police de
partment not to discuss the case
with the press.
The USW is seeking to upgrade
the classification of the life science
technicians to the level of science
and engineering technicians. They
are also seeking retroactive com
pensation since 1983, when the
case was originally filed.
A new date for arbitration is
difficult to set, depending on the
schedules of the University and
the USW. Tatham predicted it
would probably take another six
to 10 months to schedule a new
date.
At the press conference, Janet
Cook, an executive officer for the
California chapter of the National
Organization for Women, made a
guest appearance. She pointed out
that while women have made

ber of professions to women, they
are atill being discriminated
against in pay.
For every dollar that white men
earn, Hispanic, black, and white
women earn only 51, 54, and 61
cents, respectively, according to
Cook. "It's a struggle that we will
win when we value the contribu
tions that each sex makes in the
world," said Cook. She said Cali
fornia's NOW would give as much
support to the USW as it needed
in pursuing its comparable worth
cases.
Wagner stressed that the life
science technicians case is only
one of many grievances against
the University. He also cited the
Row House cooks and the
Housekeeping Departments as
other problem areas for compara
ble worth on which the USW is
focusing.

At a press conference yesterday, United Stanford Workers
union member Deborah Brltt voiced concerns that the Medical
Center practices gender discrimination in setting salaries for
its technicians.
for the life science technicians are
on average greater than that of
the science and engineering tech
nicians. The latter position re
quires only two years of vocational
education and departments
throughout the University hire
these technicians.
The USW says it first filed a
grievance on this issue with the
University in 1983, and the case
was scheduled to be arbitrated
today and tomorrow.
At 4 p.m. yesterday, however,
the Legal Office abruptly canceled
both days of the grievance
hearing. USW attorney James Eg
gleston was informed by telephone
that the University was busy with
"other matters of collective bar
gaining," according to Eggleston.
Eggleston added that the Uni
versity has canceled grievance
hearings several times in the past
six years, while the USW has can
celed the arbitration on only one
occasion because of a personal
emergency.
After the cancellation, the USW
yesterday accused the University
of "legal obstructionism" to delay
the hearing. USW President Alan
Wagner cited last year's lengthy
arbitration, which concluded the
case should be arbitrated, as an
example of the University's efforts

to block the grievance process.
University Legal Office Staff
Counsel Michael Vartain did not
return phone calls yesterday to
respond to the charges, but Uni
versity lawyer Susan Hoerger said
the wages earned by life science
technicians are the result of ne
gotiations and collective bargain
ing between the University and
the USW.
The different wages have no
bearing on gender issues, Hoerger
said.
USW member Michael Tatham
charged that the University ad
ministrators are "liars, are afraid
to face the issue, and are sexist"
for postponing the arbitration.
The sudden cancellation
"proves exactly what we're say
ing" about University efforts to
block the hearings, according to
Britt. She charged that the Uni
versity is trying to break down
the will of those filing the suit so
that the case will be dropped.
The University is currently in
the midst of another labor rela
tions negotiation with the Stan
ford police. According to USW
member Michael Tatham, the
University canceled the negotia
tions with the USW because of
the work on the police hearings.
Hoerger, who is handling both
the USW hearings and the police
department case, confirmed that
today is being reserved for nego
tiations between the police and

the University. "The University
does not like taking arbitration
off the schedule," Hoerger said,
but it occasionally does so under
emergency circumstances.
However, Hoerger gave no ex
planation why the University can
celed tomorrow's arbitration. The
police department has informed
the University that it would not
be available for arbitration on
Thursday, for reasons of public
safety.
Hoerger would not specify the
nature of the work being done on
the police department case be
cause of an agreement between
the University and the police de
partment not to discuss the case
with the press.
The USW is seeking to upgrade
the classification of the life science
technicians to the level of science
and engineering technicians. They
are also seeking retroactive com
pensation since 1983, when the
case was originally filed.
A new date for arbitration is
difficult to set, depending on the
schedules of the University and
the USW. Tatham predicted it
would probably take another six
to 10 months to schedule a new
date.
At the press conference, Janet
Cook, an executive officer for the
California chapter of the National
Organization for Women, made a
guest appearance. She pointed out
that while women have made

ber of professions to women, they
are atill being discriminated
against in pay.
For every dollar that white men
earn, Hispanic, black, and white
women earn only 51, 54, and 61
cents, respectively, according to
Cook. "It's a struggle that we will
win when we value the contribu
tions that each sex makes in the
world," said Cook. She said Cali
fornia's NOW would give as much
support to the USW as it needed
in pursuing its comparable worth
cases.
Wagner stressed that the life
science technicians case is only
one of many grievances against
the University. He also cited the
Row House cooks and the
Housekeeping Departments as
other problem areas for compara
ble worth on which the USW is
focusing.
The United Stanford
Workers union presented the
bad news and the good news
at a press conference yesterday:
They asserted that women are
paid less than men for compa
rable work at Stanford, but
they announced that a long
delayed arbitration session
with the University addressing
the issue would take place
today.
Later yesterday, however,
the University Legal Office
abruptly canceled the sched
uled arbitration session, citing
conflicts with another arbitra
tion case.
According to Deborah Britt,
a technician who spoke at the
press conference, the Medical
Center's life science tech
nicians, whose job entails treat

ing animals used in medical
research, have the same level
of expertise as science and en
gineering technicians, but are
paid between seven and 21 per
cent less.
Because of the similarity in
job descriptions, the USW con
tends the jobs are comparable,
although science and engineer
ing technicians work with mac
hines instead of animals.
