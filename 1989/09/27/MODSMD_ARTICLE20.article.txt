# Keeton helping out with food services

Food service: high cholesterol, unap
petizing entrees and long lines. Why
can't it get its act together? But at
dinner last night in Roble Hall, I saw
heartening signs of improvement.
I was pleasantly surprised by the
assistant manager of Roble Food Serv
ice, who asked me if I had any ques
tions or complaints after she noted a
student's concern about styrofoam
cups. I truly appreciated the food serv
ice management's direct contact with
students, a contrast to their typical

questionnaires.
And when I was told that the
checker was Jim Keeton, the manager
of University Food Services himself, I
was truly impressed. He was covering
for a shortage of workers.
It reminded me of a story I read in
the book "In Search of Excellence,"
which examines why the great compan
ies in the US are successful. The story
explains how Delta Airlines top man
agement personnel help out in baggage
handling during the busiest time of the
year for their company, Christmas
season.
I sincerely hope University Food
Services will continue with this kind of
customer service, even after the desper
ately needed hashers are hired, and
through this contact learn how to
satisfy students' wishes better.
