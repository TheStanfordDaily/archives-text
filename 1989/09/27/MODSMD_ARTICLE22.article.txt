## Asian-American students seek change 
### 
I was one of the people who partici
pated in the takeover last spring. But
I wouldn't fit your stereotype of the
radical rabble-rouser who just runs
around taking over buildings.
In fact, because of stereotypes of Asian-
American women, people probably think
that I am quiet, submissive and hard
working. Actually, I'm just your typical
Asian-American Stanford student.
I grew up in a small urban area that
is predominantly white. Spokane is not
a place where an Asian-American person
is encouraged to feel pride in her heritage.
Not being able to learn about the ac
complishments of my people, I always
felt like an outsider, a foreigner.
Here at Stanford, through my involve
ment in the Asian American Student As
sociation, I've come to value my ethnicity.
By meeting othQj; Ajgian-Americans and
learning about it£/ history and culture,
I have developed a sense of pride in my
identity. ■ ? r " *• '
When I todk the one Asian-American
history class offered at Stanford, I
learned that we have built this country
in the face of racist violence, discrimina
tory legislation and economic exploita
tion.
We first arrived in North America more
than 200 years ago. We built the rail
roads, developed the farm lands and es
tablished the fishing industry and
canneries. We worked in factories, fields
and mines.
In fact, our labor built the railroads
that made Leland Stanford his millions.
While we gave our lives and labor to
build this country, exclusion acts were
passed to prevent our families from im
migrating. We were paid low wages and

even forced into concentration camps.
However, Asian-Americans resisted op
pression. We used any legal means nec
essary to gain a better life for ourselves.
Here at Stanford, AASA continues this
tradition by working to build a commu
nity on this campus. A large part of this
effort is to develop Asian-American
Studies so that our heritage may be un
derstood and respected. After all, this
will contribute to the multicultural com
munity that Stanford aspires to be.
During last year's efforts, I sat in meet
ings where administrators said to our
faces that Asian-Americans had not been
in this country long enough, that we had
not impacted the nation significantly
enough, that Asian-American Studies is
not intellectual enough to hire one pro
fessor in Asian American Studies.
I could not accept the disrespect that
the University showed to the people who
built this country. Many of my friends
and I participated in the May 15 takeover
of University President Donald Kennedy's
office because we saw the fight for Asian
American Studies at Stanford as a fight
for the dignity and respect of our people.
It wasn't easy for many of us involved
in the takeover. When one of my friend's
parents found out she was arrested, they
refused to come up for her graduation
ceremony. Her parents could not under
stand why she had to rock the boat to
make changes.
On May 24, the University created a
tenure-track position for an Asian-
American Studies Professor. Also after
the takeover, many of the other demands
from the Agenda for Action were met.
Despite those difficult \\ for my
friend, she told me that she never

Having a tenure-track
professor is a step in
the right direction.
However, we need
many professors, staff,
an office — a depart
ment.

regretted being arrested. She had done
her part to make Stanford better.
Racism and ignorance cannot be erad
icated by the hiring of just one professor.
Only a few weeks ago a letter appeared
in a newspaper at the College,.of Sat
Mateo entitled "Who do you Hate?" The
letter explained why Asians are such a
menace to society and why we deserve
to be hated.
Having a tenure-track professor is a
step in the right direction. However, we
need many professors, staff, an office —
a department. That's why AASA will con
tinue to push for the development of
Asian-American Studies at Stanford.
Of course, sometimes, our families and
friends may not agree with our actions.
However, I know that building a multi
cultural community is a vision that the
majority of us share and that we will all
continue to do the right thing!
