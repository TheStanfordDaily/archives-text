## Stanford scientist develops theory on origin of life on Earth Early life might have been violently destroyed, then reborn 
### Jock Friedly Editorial staff 
If the dinosaurs had it rough,
earlier life on Earth may have
had it even rougher.
A Stanford scientist is now ad
vancing a theory that a large as
teroid hit the Earth, turning it
into a molten mess, many millions
of years before an asteroid is
thought to have sent dinosaurs to
an untimely demise. That collision
may have destroyed any existing
life forms that had taken root in
the young, cooling world.
More importantly, the theory
refines scientists' thinking about
when and where life could have
begun its evolution intc its present
condition.
Geophysics Prof. Norman Sleep
developed the theory with col
leagues on the National Aeronau
tics and Space Administration's
Committee on Planetary Biology
and Chemical Evolution.
Since the early 19705, Berkeley
scientists have found evidence for
an asteroid hitting the Earth that
might have been responsible for
the extinction of the dinosaurs.
That theory has been growing in
favor among scientists since it was
introduced.
Even before that, only about 50
million years after the fomation
of the Earth, a 630-mile-diameter
asteroid hitting the Earth might
have formed the moon. In this
massive collision, a large chunk
of the mantle, the outer layer of
the Earth, might have been
wrenched away to form the moon.
Sleep and his colleagues add an
other twist to the theory. What
if a meteorite, not quite as large
as the cataclysmic moon-forming
collision, hit Earth, destroying all
life on the planet shortly after it
was created?

What if a meteorite,
not quite as large
as the cataclysmic
moon-forming col
lision, hit Earth,
destroying all life
on the planet
shortly after it was
created?

The odds for such a collision
with an asteroid capable of
destroying all early life are not
necessarily low, the scientists
found. The big question scientists
need to answer to show that this
theory is plausible is when it oc
cured. Life is thought to have ex
isted at least 3.77 billion years
ago on Earth.
Whenever it happened, scien
tists know it would take a fairly
good-sized asteroid to destroy life.
Scientists believe an asteroid
270 miles in diameter would have
been enough to boil the oceans
away from the intense energy re
leased in such a collision. A few
asteroids currently found in the
solar system are about that size
and presumably more large as
teroids could be found in the early
history of the solar system.
Scientists speculate that a
smaller asteroid, 120 miles in
diameter, could have generated
enough energy to vaporize the up
per part of the ocean where pho
tosynthetic creatures, those that
generate their own food from the
energy of sunlight, could have
lived.

A similarly sized meteor struck
the moon to form its Imbrium
basin, and since scientists calcu
late that the Earth is 23 times
more likely to be struck than the
moon, the chances of such a
scenario are not at all bad.
The results of such a collision
would be catastrophic to most, if
not all, life. "Anything on land
would be in serious trouble, but
it might not wipe out all life,"
Sleep said.
The first life might have hidden
away at the bottom of the ocean
where it would have been better
protected from the intense boil-off
of the upper ocean. Some scien
tists now believe life could have
thrived near the sea bottom's high
temperature vents, which can heat
water to 350 degrees Celsius. If
an energetic collision heated and
boiled off much of the ocean, the
organisms accustomed to the hot
environment may have thrived in
the post-collision sea.
That theory, now being ad
vanced by a few scientists, could
answer why life continued to exist
on Earth even though there was
a decent probability for such a
large collision.
Even if life was photosynthetic
and died in a violent collision, sci
entists may never be able to con
firm that fact. Sleep said it is
very difficult to determine
whether life ever formed on Earth
before a giant collision because
the "very well-prepared rocks"
would have to survive to this day.
Sleep admits the theory that
asteroids played a crucial part in
creating the moon, killing the
dinosaurs and perhaps destroying
all primitive life, is lacking a con
crete foundation. "The lack of an
other theory that works is the
reason this theory is preferred
now," Sleep said.

may have destroyed any existing
life forms that had taken root in
the young, cooling world.
More importantly, the theory
refines scientists' thinking about
when and where life could have
begun its evolution intc its present
condition.
Geophysics Prof. Norman Sleep
developed the theory with col
leagues on the National Aeronau
tics and Space Administration's
Committee on Planetary Biology
and Chemical Evolution.
Since the early 19705, Berkeley
scientists have found evidence for
an asteroid hitting the Earth that
might have been responsible for
the extinction of the dinosaurs.
That theory has been growing in
favor among scientists since it was
introduced.
Even before that, only about 50
million years after the fomation
of the Earth, a 630-mile-diameter
asteroid hitting the Earth might
have formed the moon. In this
massive collision, a large chunk
of the mantle, the outer layer of
the Earth, might have been
wrenched away to form the moon.
Sleep and his colleagues add an
other twist to the theory. What
if a meteorite, not quite as large
as the cataclysmic moon-forming
collision, hit Earth, destroying all
life on the planet shortly after it
was created?

What if a meteorite,
not quite as large
as the cataclysmic
moon-forming col
lision, hit Earth,
destroying all life
on the planet
shortly after it was
created?

The odds for such a collision
with an asteroid capable of
destroying all early life are not
necessarily low, the scientists
found. The big question scientists
need to answer to show that this
theory is plausible is when it oc
cured. Life is thought to have ex
isted at least 3.77 billion years
ago on Earth.
Whenever it happened, scien
tists know it would take a fairly
good-sized asteroid to destroy life.
Scientists believe an asteroid
270 miles in diameter would have
been enough to boil the oceans
away from the intense energy re
leased in such a collision. A few
asteroids currently found in the
solar system are about that size
and presumably more large as
teroids could be found in the early
history of the solar system.
Scientists speculate that a
smaller asteroid, 120 miles in
diameter, could have generated
enough energy to vaporize the up
per part of the ocean where pho
tosynthetic creatures, those that
generate their own food from the
energy of sunlight, could have
lived.

A similarly sized meteor struck
the moon to form its Imbrium
basin, and since scientists calcu
late that the Earth is 23 times
more likely to be struck than the
moon, the chances of such a
scenario are not at all bad.
The results of such a collision
would be catastrophic to most, if
not all, life. "Anything on land
would be in serious trouble, but
it might not wipe out all life,"
Sleep said.
The first life might have hidden
away at the bottom of the ocean
where it would have been better
protected from the intense boil-off
of the upper ocean. Some scien
tists now believe life could have
thrived near the sea bottom's high
temperature vents, which can heat
water to 350 degrees Celsius. If
an energetic collision heated and
boiled off much of the ocean, the
organisms accustomed to the hot
environment may have thrived in
the post-collision sea.
That theory, now being ad
vanced by a few scientists, could
answer why life continued to exist
on Earth even though there was
a decent probability for such a
large collision.
Even if life was photosynthetic
and died in a violent collision, sci
entists may never be able to con
firm that fact. Sleep said it is
very difficult to determine
whether life ever formed on Earth
before a giant collision because
the "very well-prepared rocks"
would have to survive to this day.
Sleep admits the theory that
asteroids played a crucial part in
creating the moon, killing the
dinosaurs and perhaps destroying
all primitive life, is lacking a con
crete foundation. "The lack of an
other theory that works is the
reason this theory is preferred
now," Sleep said.
