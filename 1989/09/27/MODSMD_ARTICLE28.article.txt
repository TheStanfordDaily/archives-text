Infection detection improved
Armed with the latest gene-tracking technology, Stanford sci
entists have developed a new method for detecting a common
infection which is potentially fatal to AIDS patients and dangerous
to newborns.
Dr. John Boothroyd, associate professor of microbiology and
immunology, and colleagues identified a gene unique to the
one-celled microbe Toxoplasma gondii, whic'i infects 15 to 20
percent of the U.S. population. By means of a highly sensitive
technique in which DNA, the genetic material, is amplified, it
is possible to detect very small numbers of this infectious agent
in samples from individuals suspected of being infected.
The findings, which have not yet been fully tested in humans,
were reported in last month's issue of The Journal of Clinical
Microbiology.

We're talking good chemistry
The marvelous Chemistry Prof. Dick Zare is no alchemist,
but somehow he has found gold for his laboratory.
Three of the 18 new National Science Foundation chemistry
fellows in the United States have selected Zare's lab as the site
for their postgraduate research. The winners of the prestigious
awards will each receive $26,000 annually to work for one to
two years in the lab on their own projects.
Evan Williams, who hails from Cornell, will work on developing
new biochemistry instruments; Jonathan Sweedier from the Uni
versity of Arizona will examine the chemical makeup of mollusk
nerve cells; Lynmarie Posey of Yale will investigate ion-molecule
reactions important in semiconductors.
