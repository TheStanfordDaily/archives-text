# New Macintoshes make computer buying like ice cream shopping

### Mark Rogowsky Senior staff writer 
With the Sept. 20 introduction
of the Macintosh Ilci and Porta
ble, Apple Computer has begun
to resemble Baskin and Robbins
— there are now eight flavors of
Macintosh to choose from.
In 1984, there was one and only

one Macintosh. You
could take it or
leave it, not unlike
Henry Ford's "any
color you want as
long as it's black"
deal on the original
Model T. Today,
with the Macintosh
coming in many dif
ferent sizes, shapes

and levels of power, you're more
likely to find one closely tailored
to your needs.
But what of the new machines?
How can you determine if they're
the right ones for you?
The Ilci is Apple's fastest com
puter to date. Fitted with a
Motorola 68030 chip running at

25MHz, the microprocessor runs
50 percent faster than the 16MHz
68030 inside the llx and Ilex. In
addition, the 8-bit, 266-color video
chips are now provided on the
motherboard. You can plug in an
Apple Color RGB monitor without
adding a video card.
The Ilci allows you to easily
add an optional memory cache

card (to be provided
by third-party ven
dors at first and by
Apple in the near
future). With a
cache, actual com
puting speed can be
increased by an
other 20 to 30 per
cent.
What that means

in the real world is that you can
expect a speed increase versus the
Ilex of 30 to 80 percent depending
upon the application. If you want
to maximize performance, Apple
recommends purchasing a sepa
rate video card. Moving the chips
onto the motherboard has made
the video more CPU intensive —

and therefore it slows down the
computer a bit.
Other than the faster chip and
the on-board video, the Ilci ia the
Ilex. It looks the same on the
outside and is pretty much func
tionally identical.
The cost differential between
the two machines is just about
$1,000. But when you consider
that you get the color card free
(a $400 value at Bookstore prices),
the overall difference is small if
you want to run Apple's 13-inch
color monitor. If you need speed
and guaranteed compatibility, and
if you have the extra cash, the
Ilci is probably the machine for
you.
The Portable is one of those
almost machines. Almost great.
Almost fast enough. Almost
affordable. Check that, not nearly
affordable at $3,968 with a hard
disk, $3,540 without (again, Book
store prices).
First, the pluses. It's beautiful,
it has a fantastic screen, and it's
a Macintosh. It has a full-size
keyboard, sans numeric keypad,

and a trackball built in. If you
need a numeric keypad, you can
replace the trackball and buy an
optional mouse.
It runs for up to 10 hours on
its lead-acid battery. That's much
longer than any other full
featured portable. Apple did a su
perior job of power management
to achieve such long battery life.
Unlike machines with nickel
cadmium batteries, you don't
have to let the battery empty
before recharging it.
The microprocessor is twice as
fast as the one in the SE, but the
machine is far slower than a II
or Ilex. If you're used to a fast
Macintosh, the Portable will dis
appoint you. The slow processor
was chosen because it's available
in a low-power, CMOS version.
The 68030 is not yet available as
a CMOS chip.
System 6.0.4, new for the por
table, has a Sleep feature that lets
you essentially shut the machine
down to save the battery, but also
allows you to pick up exactly
where you left off with a simple

If you need speed
and guaranteed com
patibility — and if you
have the extra cash —
the Macintosh Ilci is
probably the machine
for you.

press of a key. There's also a desk
accessory that tells you how much
life is left in the battery.
The screen is terrific in that it
updates instantly. Earlier port
ables had pixels that couldn't turn
off quickly enough, so there'd be
an after-image left behind. Apple's
active matrix LCD screen technol
ogy doesn't suffer from that prob
lem at all.
The downside is that, though
the screen can be ready easily
from all angles and is very sharp,

it can't be read in dim light be
cause it lacks what's called back
lighting, an illuminated panel lo
cated behind the screen. As with
the slow microprocessor, Apple
chose to forego backlighting to ex
tend battery life.
Finally, the machine is fairly
heavy at about 15 pounds and
fairly large. The machine comes
with its own black, padded carry
ing case (Apple logo included) that
you can sling over your shoulder.
You just better have a strong
shoulder.
This desk will have a portable
on it as soon as Apple slips in the
fast chip and adds the backlight.
The machine will never be light
enough for it to truly deserve the
Portable moniker. Still, a Macin
tosh you can move is long
overdue. And, for a first effort,
the Macintosh Portable is impres
sive.
Go see one at the Bookstore or
in town. Unless you need the por
tability today, though, put off
buying until the price drops or
the functionality increases.
