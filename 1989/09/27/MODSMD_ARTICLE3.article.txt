Students detoured by bulldozers
and cranes this fall can look for
ward to an end to the incon
veniences by the close of the quar
ter. The bulk of heavy construc
tion to repair roads and utilities
on the Stanford campus is sched
uled to be completed during the
next few months.
Within the year, the building
and renovation of several facili
ties, including the much
anticipated Ford Athletics Field
House, will be finished.
Surface work on Campus Drive
between Panama Street and
Quarry Road was completed in
time for the home football game
against Oregon Saturday. The
road is now clear for through traf
fic, according to Michael
McKnight, facilities project man
ager.
The entire project, scheduled
originally for a Nov. 30 comple
tion, should be done in a few
weeks. Now only minor repairs of
steam piping remain to be done.
Also finished for the most part
is the reconstruction of the
Lomita Mall utilities, located be
hind the Quad by the physics
tank. Crews are waiting for
rainier weather to start planting

grass in the mall, McKnight said.
Re-routing of utilities in con
junction with the construction of
the new Gilbert Biology building
— near Herron Hall, west of the
Oval — is progressing well. The
"first phase" is finished, and fur
ther projects are not yet clearly
defined, McKnight said.
Cooling Tower 4, near the co
generation power plant on the
west side of campus, should be
operational by June 1, 1990,
McKnight said. The rest of the
project, including landscaping,
could be finished a few months
later.
One delay in the otherwise
smoothly-running facilities work
is the resurfacing of the Hoover
Pavilion parking lot. Slated for an
Oct. 30 completion, the work will
instead be postponed until next

spring, according to McKnight.
Heading the list of new addi
tions on campus is the Ford Ath
letic Field House, a building that
meets "the immediate needs of
the Stanford athletic depart
ment," associate director of facil
ities project management Gene
Kershner said.
According to Kershner, the Held
house will provide increased in
door recreation space, including
multi-purpose courts, gymnastic
facilities and a "viewing corridor."
The construction is now under
way, after a request from the
Board of Trustees earlier this
month for an increase in the
budget to $10 million. It is still
on schedule for an August 1990
completion.
The Peterson Labs, housed in
the sandstone buildings behind
the Quad, are being renovated at
a cost of $1.42 million to add
12,000 square feet of office space
for the Materials Science and En
gineeering Department and the
Civil Engineering Department's
Center for Integrated Facility En
gineering.
Targeted for a February 1990
finish, the expansion of the Peter
son Labs is on schedule.
