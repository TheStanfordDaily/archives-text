## Cardinal starters battered Brian Johnson will start at quarterback if he is healthy 
### Chris Crader Editorial staff 
Despite the fact that Stanford
posted its biggest win of the past
few years in coming back to beat
Oregon Saturday, the euphoria is
only good for two days, according
to football Coach Denny Green.
"It's time to stop taking pats
on the back and start preparing
for the game," Green said at yes
terday's press conference. "We're
just looking at it as a chance to
be .500. That's our motivation."
There can be no doubt that San
Jose State (1-1) will be motivated
when it travels to Stanford Sta
dium Saturday to face the 1-2
Cardinal. The Spartans have per
ennially taken a "let's go beat up
the rich brats" sort of attitude
into this game and should be es
pecially tough after playing a poor
game against Pacific Saturday.
The Spartans beat the Tigers
41-32, but they scored a touch
down at the end to put Pacific
away for good. San Jose State got
out to a 34-7 lead but started
going through the motions, allow
ing UOP to mount a comeback.
"Last week we started out great
and went downhill," Spartan
Coach Claude Gilbert said. "It was
too easy for us. They (UOP) didn't
quit. . .. They gradually fought
back and got us in trouble. They
gave us quite a scare there at the
end."
Leading the way for the Spar
tans Saturday will be fullback

Johnny Johnson, tailback Sheldon
Canley and quarterback Matt
Veatch. Canley and Johnson are
third and 11th respectively in the
nation in all-purpose running, and
Veatch is sixth nationally in total
offense.
Trying to stop them will be a
Cardinal defense that played its
best game of the young season
against Oregon Saturday.
"Defensively we're pleased,"
Green said. "We're getting better,
and I think we're going to keep
getting better."
Green especially cited the play
of outside linebacker Rob
Hinckley and defensive tackle
Lester Archambeau. Both had
been suffering from minor inju
ries through the early part of the
season. But according to Green,
both were able to practice full
time last week and the extra
repetitions made the difference.
Hinckley, in fact, was honored
by the Pacific 10 Conference as
the Pac-10 defensive Player of the
Week. He had 11 tackles against
Oregon, including a tackle-for
loss.
Another player who impressed
Green on defense is true freshman
inside linebacker Dave Garnett.
Garnett was also in on 11 tackles.
"We gave up some big plays,"
Green said. "Other than that, we
played a pretty consistent game
[on defense]."
However, Stanford's problems
lie on the other side of the ball.
With injuries hitting the backfield

like Hugo hitting the Atlantic
coast, Green is nearly out of run
ning backs. A quick rundown of
the players in this saga:
• Jon Volpe — The third 1000-
yard rusher in Stanford history
sprained his knee in practice last
week and missed the Oregon
game. He is very unlikely for this
week, and Green has said that if
he is questionable for the Oct. 7
Notre Dame game, Volpe will
probably miss it to get ready for
the conference games that follow.
• Charlie Young — Stanford's
leading receiver last year has not
played a down after injuring his
knee in spring practice. Young
reiryured the knee two weeks ago
and will have surgery this week.
In all probability, he is out for
the season.
• Jay Jay Lasley — Projected as
the No. 2 halfback behind Young
in the preseason, Lasley started
against Oregon and ran well. He
sprained his knee midway
through the first quarter, how
ever, and will be lost for three to
four weeks.
• Tommy Vardell — Vardell, the
second-string fullback, missed the
Oregon game with a shoulder in
jury. He may play this weeked.
• Herbie Berry — "Herbie Berry?
I thought he was a safety." Berry
came to Stanford as one of Cali
fornia's top high school running
backs and played that position
while redshirting last year. He

Freshman Jay Jay Lasley is assisted off the field after spraining his knee in Saturday's amazing
18-17 victory over Oregon. Lasley, who started at halfback because of an Injury to Jon Volpe, rushed
for 36 yards on four carries against the Ducks but will miss this Saturday's game against San Jose
State.
