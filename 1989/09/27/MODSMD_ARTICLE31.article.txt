# Spikers ready to battle Bears
## 
### David Earnest Senior staff writer 
On paper, the Stanford women's
volleyball team is one of the two
or three best in the country. On
the court, the women are having
problems proving they deserve
that distinction.
"We're struggling right now a
little bit," Coach Don Shaw said.
"[Practice] has taken a lot out of
I us; we're kind of burned out."
! The team's home opener Friday
in the refurbished Old Pavilion
will provide a boost, but the Car
dinal must first travel to
Berkeley's Harmon Gym tonight
to face the eight-ranked California
Golden Bears, who enter the
match with a 9-1 record. With

tonight's action, Stanford (6-2),
which dropped from No. 5 to No.
6 in this week's AVCA/Tachikara
Poll, wraps up a grueling, season
opening nine-match road trip.
California rode a nine-game
winning streak to the No. 8 spot

ranking despite a loss to No. 4
Pacific last Friday. Stanford also
lost to Pacific Sept. 13, and the
Cardinal lost the championship
match of last week's Firs Tier In
vitational to host Nebraska.
Despite their similar records
and rankings, Stanford and Cali
fornia enter tonight's match well
aware of the legacy of their
riva!i y. Stanford has won the last
11 matches with the Bears and
leads the series 23-3. Leading Cal
ifornia's effort to break the Car
dinal's winning streak tonight are
outside hitter Tiffany Rochelle,
with 139 kills, and setter Holly
McPeak, who leads the team with
134 digs.
Tonight's match offers Stanford
another opportunity to test its
injury-plagued offense against a
top-10 team. Freshman outside
hitter Bev Oden is recovering
from an ankle injury but will play.
Senior setter Lara As per, who has
recently been slowed by back
spasms, may play tonight pending
results of a magnetic resonance
imager examination she had yes
terday. Freshman Carrie Feldman
and junior Karen Anderson will
set if Asper cannot play.
Last week the team struggled
at the Firs Tier Invitational in Lin
coln, Neb. Stanford was chal
lenged by unranked Pittsburgh
and then had to come from 0-2
down to defeat No. 11 Kentucky.
The Cardinal then lost to seventh
ranked Nebraska, a team that
Shaw said was "a little further
along than we are right now."
Because Stanford started prac
ticing a week later than most
teams, the team has faced more
polished competition. Along with
the demanding season-opening
road trip, injuries to key players
have hurt the Cardinal offense.
With Asper injured, Stanford's 11-
game winning streak against Cal
ifornia may be in jeopardy
tonight.
"Every time we play Cal it's a
big match. We just need to go out
ready to play and show them that
we can beat them from the be
ginning," Asper said.
A victory over California will
demonstrate that the team has
overcome some of its early season
difficulties. Without those prob
lems, Stanford may soon regain
its preseason No. 2 ranking.

ranking despite a loss to No. 4
Pacific last Friday. Stanford also
lost to Pacific Sept. 13, and the
Cardinal lost the championship
match of last week's Firs Tier In
vitational to host Nebraska.
Despite their similar records
and rankings, Stanford and Cali
fornia enter tonight's match well
aware of the legacy of their
riva!i y. Stanford has won the last
11 matches with the Bears and
leads the series 23-3. Leading Cal
ifornia's effort to break the Car
dinal's winning streak tonight are
outside hitter Tiffany Rochelle,
with 139 kills, and setter Holly
McPeak, who leads the team with
134 digs.
Tonight's match offers Stanford
another opportunity to test its
injury-plagued offense against a
top-10 team. Freshman outside
hitter Bev Oden is recovering
from an ankle injury but will play.
Senior setter Lara As per, who has
recently been slowed by back
spasms, may play tonight pending
results of a magnetic resonance
imager examination she had yes
terday. Freshman Carrie Feldman
and junior Karen Anderson will
set if Asper cannot play.
Last week the team struggled
at the Firs Tier Invitational in Lin
coln, Neb. Stanford was chal
lenged by unranked Pittsburgh
and then had to come from 0-2
down to defeat No. 11 Kentucky.
The Cardinal then lost to seventh
ranked Nebraska, a team that
Shaw said was "a little further
along than we are right now."
Because Stanford started prac
ticing a week later than most
teams, the team has faced more
polished competition. Along with
the demanding season-opening
road trip, injuries to key players
have hurt the Cardinal offense.
With Asper injured, Stanford's 11-
game winning streak against Cal
ifornia may be in jeopardy
tonight.
"Every time we play Cal it's a
big match. We just need to go out
ready to play and show them that
we can beat them from the be
ginning," Asper said.
A victory over California will
demonstrate that the team has
overcome some of its early season
difficulties. Without those prob
lems, Stanford may soon regain
its preseason No. 2 ranking.

On paper, the Stanford women's
volleyball team is one of the two
or three best in the country. On
the court, the women are having
problems proving they deserve
that distinction.
"We're struggling right now a
little bit," Coach Don Shaw said.
"[Practice] has taken a lot out of
I us; we're kind of burned out."
! The team's home opener Friday
in the refurbished Old Pavilion
will provide a boost, but the Car
dinal must first travel to
Berkeley's Harmon Gym tonight
to face the eight-ranked California
Golden Bears, who enter the
match with a 9-1 record. With

tonight's action, Stanford (6-2),
which dropped from No. 5 to No.
6 in this week's AVCA/Tachikara
Poll, wraps up a grueling, season
opening nine-match road trip.
California rode a nine-game
