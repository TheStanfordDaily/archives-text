# Old Pavilion will open Friday
## 
### Mark Anderegg 
The typical college student is
all too familiar with "all
nighters." The typical construc
tion worker is not.
The workers on Stanford's Old
Pavilion, however, are becoming
less and less typical, as they
struggle to make the complex
ready for this Friday's women's
volleyball match with Oregon
State.
"We need it [Old Pavilion] done
by 7:30 p.m. Friday," said Shelly
Wilder, Old Pavilion facility man
ager. "The guys will be working
around the clock to make sure
we're ready for that first volley
ball match."
The main gym in the renovated
pavilion is complete and has been
used for volleyball practice for the
last three weeks. The administra
tive offices and storage rooms are
also finished.
"All we have left is the
restrooms and lobby area," said
Pete Wenzel, Old Pavilion facility
manager. "We'll get them done."
Once this construction has been
completed, Stanford will concen
trate the whole of its efforts on
a building which will sit behind
Old Pavilion. This new building,

'I think it looks: !*;
; r* • in j i
beautiful,' said
Steve Brown, proj
ect manager, 'and I
expect the finished
complex to look
even better.'

now only in its embryonic stages,
will be connected to the pavilion.
The finished product, located on
Serra street straight across from
Encina, will be called the Ford
Complex, named after the alumni
who made the construction possi
ble.
"We aren't paying for this," said
Wenzel. "A generous grant from
the Fords allowed us to do the
renovation."
The finished product, scheduled
to be completed in approximately
one year, will include complete
locker room facilities, as well as
more offices and storage space. "I
think it looks beautiful," said
Steve Brown, project manager,

"and I expect the finished complex
to dock arm.better."
Pavilion m alrady slated to 1
host a number of activities. Vol
leyball matches will perhaps be
the most visible events, but a va
riety of other significant athletic
programs will find their home in
the new Old Pavilion as well. In
additon, both the men and the
women spikers will be practicing
in the new complex. Neither the
wrestlers nor the gymnasts will
practice in the facility, but both
will hold their meets there.
"They love it," said Wilder in
reference to the athletes already
using the arena. "They really en
joy having their own place to prac
tice and not having to worry about
being bumped off the courts by
other teams."
Aside from practice time and
space, the new building also
serves the important purpose of
providing a small arena for
matches and meets which have
traditionally received minimal
crowd support. What were very
sparse crowds in Maples Pavilion
will be big crowds in Old Pavilion.
"This place should see some
capacity crowds," said Wilder.
Intramurals will also find a
niche in the new building, as IM
volleyball is scheduled to operate
out of the renovated facility. Other
appropriate IM events may also
find their way into the soon-to
be-completed Ford Center. Recrea
tional activities such as aerobics
and pick-up basketball games will
also occur in the center. This
should provide much-needed relief
for Roble Gym and Wilbur courts,
according to Wilder.
Although the entire process for
such a large undertaking is bound
to be a long one, the actual con
struction for this project started
last January, Brown said. The
seven months it took to finish the
renovation may well have been an
even shorter length of time had
the construction crew not run into
problems with the floor.
"A concrete slab was supposed
to exist under the old floor," said
Brown, "but when we got to it,
we found it wasn't there."

Construction continues inside the Old Pavilion, which will be renamed the Ford Complex upon
completion. The women's volleyball team is scheduled to play Oregon State inside the refurbished
facility on Friday night.
