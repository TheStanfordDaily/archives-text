# Old Pavilion will open Friday
## 
### Mark Anderegg 
The typical college student is
all too familiar with "all
nighters." The typical construc
tion worker is not.
The workers on Stanford's Old
Pavilion, however, are becoming
less and less typical, as they
struggle to make the complex
ready for this Friday's women's
volleyball match with Oregon
State.
"We need it [Old Pavilion] done
by 7:30 p.m. Friday," said Shelly
Wilder, Old Pavilion facility man
ager. "The guys will be working
around the clock to make sure
we're ready for that first volley
ball match."
The main gym in the renovated
pavilion is complete and has been
used for volleyball practice for the
last three weeks. The administra
tive offices and storage rooms are
also finished.
"All we have left is the
restrooms and lobby area," said
Pete Wenzel, Old Pavilion facility
manager. "We'll get them done."
Once this construction has been
completed, Stanford will concen
trate the whole of its efforts on
a building which will sit behind
Old Pavilion. This new building,

'I think it looks: !*;
; r* â€¢ in j i
beautiful,' said
Steve Brown, proj
ect manager, 'and I
expect the finished
complex to look
even better.'

now only in its embryonic stages,
will be connected to the pavilion.
The finished product, located on
Serra street straight across from
Encina, will be called the Ford
Complex, named after the alumni
who made the construction possi
ble.
"We aren't paying for this," said
Wenzel. "A generous grant from
the Fords allowed us to do the
renovation."
The finished product, scheduled
to be completed in approximately
one year, will include complete
locker room facilities, as well as
more offices and storage space. "I
think it looks beautiful," said
Steve Brown, project manager,

"and I expect the finished complex
to dock arm.better."
Pavilion m alrady slated to 1
host a number of activities. Vol
leyball matches will perhaps be
the most visible events, but a va
riety of other significant athletic
programs will find their home in
the new Old Pavilion as well. In
additon, both the men and the
women spikers will be practicing
in the new complex. Neither the
wrestlers nor the gymnasts will
practice in the facility, but both
will hold their meets there.
"They love it," said Wilder in
reference to the athletes already
using the arena. "They really en
joy having their own place to prac
tice and not having to worry about
being bumped off the courts by
other teams."
Aside from practice time and
space, the new building also
serves the important purpose of
providing a small arena for
matches and meets which have
traditionally received minimal
crowd support. What were very
sparse crowds in Maples Pavilion
will be big crowds in Old Pavilion.
"This place should see some
capacity crowds," said Wilder.
