# Autumn signals the return of sports
## 
### 
The beginning of the school
year is a strange time at
Stanford. Unlike your typ
ical university, where class begins
in late August, the football team
starts play long before the stu
dents have returned.
So instead of wondering what
the season will be like in the first
few days, Stanford students —
and players — already have a
pretty good idea.
This year the idea was 0-2 and
what'll we do. Looks like another
losing season on the Farm. Re
member the good ol' days when
Elway was coach.
Saturday, though, Stanford Sta
dium did its best impression of a
Field of Dreams. The Brian
Johnson-led Cardinal built the
momentum, and the scoring drive
finally came.
Steve Smith finally got a chance
to ease the pain of his first two
college games. And, the Cardinal
went the distance — three times
in eight minutes — to come up
with a win they'll be talking about
when Johnson is a five-year vet
eran with the Yankees.
R returning to school brings
with it a lot besides Alcoa
like Fantastic Finishes. All
summer, many of us have been
sitting around in New York, Gary,
Big Sky and Visalia wishing we
had a dorm full of people to roust

up for a volleyball game.
They're back and ready to play
volleyball, football, hoops, fill in
the blank. They'll even commit to
doing it once a week in IMs.
When I was a freshman, our
first IM football game was a coed
contest against Whitman. None of
us knew where Whitman was.
When our opponents told us it
was in the Cowell Cluster, there
still wasn't a single soul on our
Rinconada squad who knew where
Whitman was.
The other thing we didn't know
was that we hadn't a prayer of
winning the game. They had
reached the semifinals of the
playoffs last year and knew what
they were doing. Don't get me
wrong; they weren't too intense.
They were just good.
Still, on our first play from
scrimmage I snapped the ball to
the quarterback, ran out into the
flat, caught the ball and raced all

the way into the end zone. Our
conversion failed, but we were still
overjoyed.
Not only were we going to win,
we were going to kill them. With
that adage about the best laid
plans of mice and men being its
usual applicable self, however,
things went awry.
They scored soon after and
eventually went on to trounce us
31-6. In nine more games that
year (four coed, five all
university) we would never again
have the lead, let alone win.
Nonetheless, people came out


MARK ROGOWSKY
every week to have fun and to
compete. We were competitive,
you see, usually falling by 7-0 and
13-6 scores. Through the time we
spent together, we became close
friends and I'm pretty sure it
didn't matter that we never won.
Besides, we had success later
in the year playing basketball, soc
cer and softbail. It was a lot more
fun then.
What's my point? I'm not
really sure. It's some
thing about sports and
friends. Something that you can
eryoy when you're screaming your
head off while Stanford sur
mounts an insurmountable defi
cit.
Or while you're on the grass of
the stadium actually beating the
Ducks after they were already cer
tain they'd beaten you.
It's the feeling of being with
your friends, playing IMs, experi
encing the stuff that memories
that last a lifetime are made of.
