# Einstein part of Stanford's new offensive genius
## 
### Chris Crader Editorial staff 
Carolyn Einstein has usually
not been overlooked.
In high school she led her soccer
team in scoring all four years.
She also played basketball
there, and was named that team's
MVP her senior year.
When it came time to go to
college, Stanford soccer Coach
Berhane Andeberhan was inter
ested in her. But he also was
recruiting a U.S. national team
player and a few regional team
players.
When Andeberhan signed Julie
Foudy, Jennifer Potok and Kirby
Seale, they attracted most of the
attention. But Einstein has made
her bid for the limelight as a mem
ber of Stanford's freshman class

and has had a definite role in
Stanford's 6-1 start and No. 10
national ranking.
When asked about Einstein's
play this year, Andeberhan admit
ted she had exceeded his expec
tations. "It's one of those cases
when I'm glad I'm wrong," he
said. "She's even faster and
quicker than I expected."
Einstein has seen a great deal
of playing time this year and has
tallied three assists in only seven
games, going into Stanford's clash
at seventh-ranked Santa Clara
tonight. A big reason for that has
been a switch in her position from
forward to midfield.
"This is actually the first time
I've played halfback," Einstein
said. "It's been hard. ... I'm still
pretty inexperienced at the posi
tion but I'm learning."
According to Andeberhan, one
of Einstein's best attributes is her
ability to hit good passes and
crosses to set up scoring oppor
tunities. Instead of being a for
ward, where her job would be to
run down such balls, Einstein now
makes the passes and Stanford's
forwards finish the plays.
"She is a lot more comfortable
with her face to the goal than
with her back to the goal," An
deberhan said. "She's a lot more
effective at midfield."
In addition to making the po
sition switch, she has also had to
make the change from high school,
to top-level collegiate soccer.
"I like it more than high school
soccer," she said of college ball.
"You're playing with more good,
experienced players. I mean I

played with good players in high
school but all the players here are
good.
"During preseason practice I
didn't feel very comfortable about
my playing. A lot of people have
come from national teams and
stuff like that. I was pretty sur
prised to be playing. Pleasantly
surprised."
Einstein has played at right
outside halfback this year, split
ting time with sophomore Kim
Peterson. "Kim starts for us most
of the time and she does a good
job," Andeberhan said. "When
Carolyn comes in there there is
no drop off."
Under Andeberhan the Cardi
nal has improved from 4-11-4 in
1987 to a national power. The

improvement between last year
and this year has been dramatic,
as exemplified in a game against
third-ranked Colorado College in
Colorado Saturday. Stanford
played even with the Tigers the
entire game before giving up a
disputed goal in overtime.
"I think we improve in each
game," Einstein said. "After play
ing a team like that and losing
1-0 in the last two minutes, you've
got to feel confident. It was a good
game. I think we deserved to
win. ... It was a disappointing
loss but it also helped us realize
how good we really are and how
good we can end up. We can be
one of the top teams.
"I really think we have definite
potential. ... I think that we can

The Cardinal has scored 29
goals while giving up a mere two
in seven games this year.
"Everybody works really well
together," Einstein said. "We've
got so many good players who are
good as individuals but also work
well together as a team."
In addition to the talent,
Einstein cited Andeberhan as a
big reason for the squad's arrival
on the national scene.
"He knows a lot about soccer,"
she said. "He's very easy to work
with. He knows when it's time to
be serious but he's got a great
sense of humor. He just seems to
have the respect of everyone."

Peterson. "Kim starts for us most
of the time and she does a good
job," Andeberhan said. "When
Carolyn comes in there there is
no drop off."
Under Andeberhan the Cardi
nal has improved from 4-11-4 in
1987 to a national power. The

improvement between last year
and this year has been dramatic,
as exemplified in a game against
third-ranked Colorado College in
Colorado Saturday. Stanford
played even with the Tigers the
entire game before giving up a
disputed goal in overtime.
"I think we improve in each
game," Einstein said. "After play
ing a team like that and losing
1-0 in the last two minutes, you've
got to feel confident. It was a good
game. I think we deserved to
win. ... It was a disappointing
loss but it also helped us realize
how good we really are and how
good we can end up. We can be
one of the top teams.

The Cardinal has scored 29
goals while giving up a mere two
in seven games this year.
"Everybody works really well
together," Einstein said. "We've
got so many good players who are
good as individuals but also work
well together as a team."
In addition to the talent,
Einstein cited Andeberhan as a
big reason for the squad's arrival
on the national scene.
"He knows a lot about soccer,"
she said. "He's very easy to work
with. He knows when it's time to
be serious but he's got a great
sense of humor. He just seems to
have the respect of everyone."

Carolyn Einstein has usually
not been overlooked.
In high school she led her soccer
team in scoring all four years.
She also played basketball
there, and was named that team's
MVP her senior year.
When it came time to go to
college, Stanford soccer Coach
Berhane Andeberhan was inter
ested in her. But he also was
recruiting a U.S. national team
player and a few regional team
players.
When Andeberhan signed Julie
Foudy, Jennifer Potok and Kirby
Seale, they attracted most of the
attention. But Einstein has made
her bid for the limelight as a mem
ber of Stanford's freshman class

and has had a definite role in
Stanford's 6-1 start and No. 10
national ranking.
When asked about Einstein's
play this year, Andeberhan admit
ted she had exceeded his expec
tations. "It's one of those cases
when I'm glad I'm wrong," he
said. "She's even faster and
quicker than I expected."
Einstein has seen a great deal
of playing time this year and has
tallied three assists in only seven
games, going into Stanford's clash
at seventh-ranked Santa Clara
tonight. A big reason for that has
been a switch in her position from
forward to midfield.
"This is actually the first time
I've played halfback," Einstein
said. "It's been hard. ... I'm still
pretty inexperienced at the posi
tion but I'm learning."
According to Andeberhan, one
of Einstein's best attributes is her
ability to hit good passes and
crosses to set up scoring oppor
tunities. Instead of being a for
ward, where her job would be to
run down such balls, Einstein now
makes the passes and Stanford's
forwards finish the plays.
"She is a lot more comfortable
with her face to the goal than
with her back to the goal," An
deberhan said. "She's a lot more
effective at midfield."
In addition to making the po
sition switch, she has also had to
make the change from high school,
to top-level collegiate soccer.
"I like it more than high school
soccer," she said of college ball.
"You're playing with more good,
experienced players. I mean I

played with good players in high
school but all the players here are
good.
"During preseason practice I
didn't feel very comfortable about
my playing. A lot of people have
come from national teams and
stuff like that. I was pretty sur
prised to be playing. Pleasantly
surprised."
Einstein has played at right
outside halfback this year, split
ting time with sophomore Kim
Peterson. "Kim starts for us most
of the time and she does a good
job," Andeberhan said. "When
Carolyn comes in there there is
no drop off."
Under Andeberhan the Cardi
