# Stanford booters hope to reach .500 plateau at Harvard
## Cardinal challenges Crimson 
### Andrew Wilcox Staff writer 
The Cardinal men's soccer team
will be seeing red today as they
take on the highly regarded Har
vard Crimson in Cambridge,
Mass. to round out the East Coast
leg of their current road trip.
The Harvard booters, who failed
to live up to lofty expectations
last year, are trying to vindicate
themselves this season and look
to be a tough opponent for Stan
ford.
Crimson coach Mike Getman,
who has lost several strong Eu
ropean players to graduation, is
now concentrating on developing
home-grown talent, although Har
vard is still buoyed by foreign
players recruited by Getman's
predecessor. The unranked Cardi
nal, who are 3-4-1 on the season,
will attempt to reach the .500
mark after splitting the previous

two matches of this Eastern
swing. Stanford's last chance to
even its record was aborted Sun
day as a match against host Uni
versity of Hartford in the finals
of the Kenney, Webber and Lowell
Constitution Cup was rained out.
In the opening round of the
tournament, the Cardinal scored
an impressive 2-1 victory over Old

Dominion in a game marred by
heavy rains throughout the sec
ond half. The downpour did not
seem to bother Stanford's offense,
as they tallied both goals in the
second half after a defensive battle
left the game in a scoreless dead
lock at the half.
Freshman Lance Killian, who
has been playing like a veteran,
put the Cardinal on top midway
through the second stanza. Killian
deflly accepted a pass from Randy
Mann and converted from 12
yards out. Sophomore Rhett
Harty scored what turned out to
be an important insurance goal
ten minutes later, booting in a
15-yard direct kick to give Stan
ford a 2-0 cushion before Old
Dominion's Anthony Blunt scored
to provide the final 2-1 margin.
The Cardinal travels to Texas
this weekend for matchups with
Southern Methodist and North
Texas State and does not play at
home until Oct. 14.
