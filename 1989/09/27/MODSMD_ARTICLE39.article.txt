# Holy Cow! Cubs clinch
## 
### 
MONTREAL (AP) - At the
start, the New York Mets had
more talent, St. Louis and
Philadelphia had more stars and
Montreal and Pittsburgh had
more potential.
At the end, the Chicago Cubs
had the only more that matters
— victories.
The Cubs clinched the Na
tional League East champion
ship last night, beating
Montreal 3-2 about an hour
after second-place St. Louis lost
4-1 at Pittsburgh.
The Cubs became the first
team to earn a playoff spot, and
did it the same way they've been
winning all year — aggressive
offense and good pitching.
Ryne Sandberg, the only
everyday starter left from
Chicago'B last title team in 1984,
dashed home from first base on
an error in the eighth inning
and Greg Maddux and Mitch
Williams made it stand up.
"After we got that close, I

wasn't going to blow it," Wil
liams said after striking out
pinch hitter Mike Fitzgerald
with the tying run on third base
to end the game.
That made Don Zimmer a
champion for the first time as
a manager in 11 seasons and
made meaningless this week
end's three-game series at St.
Louis. The next big game for
the Cubs will be Wednesday
night at Wrigley Field, almost
certainly against San Francisco,
as Chicago tries to reach its first
World Series since 1945.
"I don't care who we play,"
Zimmer said. "I just want to
enjoy this for a day."
The Cubs and Giants split 12
games this season. Each team
went 3-3 at its home park, al
though San Francisco's big hit
ters will come East trying to
cause problems.
But getting out of trouble has
been the Cubs' strength all year.
After a 77-85 finish last season,

prospects did not look good after
they went 9-23 in spring train
ing.
"I thought we had a lot of
holes to fill," Andre Dawson ad
mitted. "I thought we had a lot
of things to put behind us."
And they did. A seven-game
winning streak early in the
season put them in first place,
and the Cubs' confidence grew.
In early May, the starting out
field of Dawson, Jerome Walton
and Mitch Webster went on the
disabled list in a span of five
days.
"We knew that was going to
be a tough time," Dawson said.
"But we hung through it. We
played as a team, not as indi
viduals."
The Cubs neither led nor
trailed by more than 3 games
all summer. On Aug. 7, Chicago
took first place for good, beating
co-leader Montreal 5-2 on a
seven-hitter by Maddux and a
home run by Sandberg.
