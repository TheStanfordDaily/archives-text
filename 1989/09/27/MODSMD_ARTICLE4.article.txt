# Senior Class 'abolished'
## Insurance coverage for class events is in jeopardy 
### Brent Bigler Staff writer 
This year the Senior Pub Night may find
itself in suds if the Senior Class cannot
find its way out of an insurance bottleneck.
However, the Senior Class Presidents
plan to go ahead with traditional senior
events like Pub Night, Casino Night and
Senior Disorientation.
The problems began June 6 when the
ASSU Senate found itself sobered by a 300
percent increase in insurance payments, ac
cording to Sandra Leal, the ASSU's finan
cial manager. ASSU insurance rose to
$45,000, up from $15,000 last year.
University insurers told the senate "the
Senior Class was going to be a huge risk
factor," Leal said. She explained that the
spring 1988 drowning of Robert Yuan at
Senior Weekend fueled the insurers' con
cern.
According to Leal, the ASSU then voted
to give 'em the axe. "What we decided was
the Senior Class was too expensive to sup
port," she said. "The Senior Class was writ
ten out of the bylaws."
Michael Ramsey-Perez, assistant dean of
student affairs and director of Student Or
ganization Services, said that according to
the pre-June 6 bylaws, "The only organized
class [was] the senior class."
Now, Leal said, "The Senior Class doesn't
exist as part of the ASSU" and thus its
events are no longer insured by the ASSU.
But all of this leaves the Senior Class
Presidents more than a bit miffed. In a
group interview last night, the presidents
— Patrick Devine, Leslie Hatamiya, Jeff
Kraitzer and Michael Roark — said they
learned by accident last Thursday night
that the class was not insured.

But all of this leaves the
Senior Class Presidents
more than a bit miffed.

The presidents disputed the claim that
the class is a chancy bet. In fact, they said
the insurer only mentioned "in a flippant
way" that the Senior Class is a possible risk.
The presidents said that as of last Friday
they expected to have to cut all senior
activities for the entire year, because they
felt they could not accept personal respon
sibility for any accidents resulting from a
Senior Class-sponsored event.
Nonetheless, Ramsey-Perez has high
hopes for this year's traditional activities.
"Absent any other arrangement, the Senior
Class's big activities would be covered by
the University's other insurance," he said.
Ramsey-Perez characterized extracur
riculars such as "Full Moon in the Quad"
as big activities.
There is, however, a little hitch in this
plan, according to the Ramsey-Perez. "Each
event must be approved by the University
for it to be covered," he said. "We are
looking at the Senior Class in a very dif
ferent way. We shall be providing them [the
presidents] with much more preplanning
advice."
The biggest advantage to this, added
Ramsey-Perez, is that "the officers have a
really good reason to feel assured that what
they're planning is going to go well."
But the Presidents do not want much
advice. Such advice, they said,
would be a liability and require
them "to go through gobs of
paperwork" just to get an event
off the ground.
So the big question is what hap
pens next. Leal said that in June
the ASSU recommended that the
Senior Class Presidents research
financial support from the
Alumni Association. But the
presidents said neither they nor
the Alumni Association were in
formed of this option.

Right now, said Leal, the presi
dents must apply to become a vo
luntary student organization. She
said that the class will then exist
as another club on campus and
will benefit from the University's
$1 million self-insurance policy.
Indeed, the presidents have
done this, but are still unsure of
the class's insured status. They
said that at the moment all that
exists is a "verbal agreement" be
tween the University and the class
to insure activities. Nonetheless,
the presidents are preparing to
put on all events as planned.
But the ultimate goal for the
presidents is to once again become
a part of the ASSU.
