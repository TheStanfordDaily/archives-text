LOS ANGELES (AP) - The
defending World Series champion
Los Angeles Dodgers have had a
terrible year, but another win
over the San Francisco Giants
tonight will surely make the off
season a little easier to take.
Rookie Ramon Martinez and
Jay Howell combined to pitch a
four-hitter last night as the
Dodgers beat the Giants 2-1, pre
venting their bitter rivals from
clinching the National League
West championship for the second
straight day.
Los Angeles beat San Francisco
5-2 Monday night, but the Giants
clinched a tie for the division
crown when Cincinnati beat
second-place San Diego 5-3. The
Padres remained alive Tuesday
night by beating the Reds 3-1.
"I play the game like it means
something to our ballclub," said
Dodgers manager Tom Lasorda,
whose team is 75-83 and 16 games
behind San Francisco. "I don't
want anyone, let alone the Giants,
to clinch a title and celebrate in
our ballpark."

The Giants, four games ahead
of San Diego with four games
remaining, will send NL earned
run average leader Scott Garrelts,
14-4, to the mound tonight. He'll
oppose NL shutout leader Tim
Belcher, 14-12.
If the Dodgers make it three
straight and San Diego beats the
Reds again, the division title will
be decided during the three-game
series between the Giants and
Padres at San Diego starting Fri
day night.
Despite the two straight losses,
the Giants were upbeat after
Tuesday night's game.
"It's going to get done," said
infielder Matt Williams, who
grounded into a forceout to end
Tuesday night's game. "It might
not have been last night or
tonight, but it's going to get
done."
"We'll postpone it for another
day, that's all," Manager Roger
Craig said. "They outplayed us.
We've been doing it the hard way
all year long. Those guys aren't
going to roll over and play dead.
They're trying to win, too. We're
going to do our best to do it to
morrow night."
"I'm not frustrated," said first
baseman Will Clark, whose first
inning homer provided the Giants
with their only run against Mar
tinez and Howell. "As long as we
get it done, it doesn't matter

when. We want to win, period.
That's the bottom line."
Martinez, 6-4, walked two and
struck out 11 in 8 2-3 innings.
He issued his only two walkfl, to
Kevin Mitchell and Ernest Riles,
with two outs in the ninth inning.
Howell then came on and needed
only one pitch to end the game.
"It was a curve ball," said Wil
liams, who grounded the ball
crisply into the hole at short,
where Alfredo Griffin fielded it
and threw to second for the force.
"I was looking for it, got it, didn't
do anything with it. Sometimes
they go through, sometimes they
don't."
"With Matt Williams, I know
he's a good fastball hitter," Howell
said. "He knew I was going to
throw him a breaking pitch. He's
going to see breaking balls from
me. I'm not going to throw him
a fastball and let him beat me."
The Dodgers scored the win
ning run off Kelly Downs, 4-7, in
the bottom of the sixth inning
when Willie Randolph scored from
third base on Eddie Murray's
double-play grounder. Randolph
and Lenny Harris had sta ted le
inning with singles.
The Giants took a 1-0 lead in
the first on Clark's 23rd homer
of the season.
The Dodgers tied it in the fifth
on a two-out double by Jose Gon
zalez.
