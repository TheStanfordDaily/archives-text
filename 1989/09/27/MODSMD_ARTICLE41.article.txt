OAKLAND (AP) - Curt
Young made the most of his
brief time on the mound for
the Oakland Athletics this
season, even if his 5-9 record
fails to accurately reflect that
effort.
"He's one pitcher we just ha
ven't been able to score runs
for all year," said manager
Tony La Russa after the A's
lefthander allowed two runs in
7 1/3 innings to help the A's
clinch a tie for the American
League West division title with
a 4-3 victory over Texas last
night.
Young wasn't around to get
the decision, even though he
left with a 2-1 lead. Reliever
Dennis Eckersley came on with
two on and one out in the
eighth. The Rangers scored a
run to tie it on Harold Baines'
RBI ground out following a
double steal, but Dave Hender
son's two-run homer in the bot
tom of the eighth won the game
for the A's.
"I've admired the way he's
handled his infrequent outings
- no excuses, no complaints,"
said La Russa. "Here's a guy
who's pitched as well as
anybody on this club at times
for the past few years. The first
half of '87, he was our best
pitcher."
Young, whose 3.80 ERA is a
better indicator of his contri
bution this season, made 20
starts as the fifth man in the
rotation.
"This is a great place to
pitch," said Young. "My strat
egy was that I wasn't going to
lose because of being wild, after
not pitching for so long."
Young walked three, but only
one came around to score on
him. He pitched five innings
of no-hit ball before Mike Stan
ley singled to center to lead off
the sixth and eventually scored
the Rangers' first run.
"I'm not expecting any more
starts, but I'm just glad to help

us clinch the tie," said Young.
"I look forward to wrapping it
up, even though I'm not in
volved."
Texas manager Bobby Valen
tine was happy with the way
his team came back against one
of the league's best relievers in
Eckersley, but is not looking
forward to seeing an Oakland
championship celebration at
his team's expense.
"I want to get out of town
before that happens," said
Valentine. "I don't want to see
it. I don't want to talk about
it."
Henderson's homer, his 15th
of the season and second in
two nights, came off reliever
Gary Mielke after Walt Weiss
led off the eighth with a bunt
single off Texas starter and
loser Mike Jeffcoat (9-6). Weiss
went all the way to third when
third baseman Dean Palmer's
throw sailed over first for a
two-base error.
After Rickey Henderson's
grounder failed to bring home
the run, Dave Henderson hit a
1-0 pitch to settle it.
"I was just trying to hit a
fly ball," said Henderson, "and
sometimes, fly balls go out of
the park."
Eckersley, 4-0, picked up the
win despite blowing his third
save in the last six opportuni
ties.
Jose Canseco's fourth-inning
double drove in the first A's
run. Dave Parker doubled and
scored the A's second run in
the seventh when Ranger sec
ond baseman Fred Manrique
bobbled Tony Philips' infield
single, and the error allowed
Parker to score all the way
from second when he bowled
over catcher Chad Kreuter on
a bang-bang play.
Pete Incaviglia doubled and
scored on Thad Bosley's
sacrifice fly for the Rangers'
final run in the ninth.
