# Authors draw on their childhood pain
## 
### Jill Daniels Staff writer 
Two American women with very different
backgrounds both explained Monday night
how they had used the medium of literature
to uncover their sometimes troubling
childhoods.
In the first of several Branner Presents, a
series of presentations sponsored by Branner
Hall, authors Amy Tan and Kaye Gibbons
discussed how experiences growing up had
influenced their writing.
Their hour-long presentation began with
both authors reading excerpts from their books
and then discussing the environments in which
they grew up. Afterward, the authors fielded
questions from a standing-room-only crowd
that filled Branner's main lounge.
Tan began the presentation, reading a se
lection from her book "The Joy Luck Club."
The book presents the problems Chinese im
migrants and their descendants face living in
America.
Tan's fictional stories, loosely based on her

own family history, often seem unreal, she
said. For example, she told about her grand
mother who cut off part of her arm in order
to feed a sick family member. Even to herself,
her family stories "sound exotic and removed,"
she said.
Tan added that she found it difficult to
relate to old, Chinese traditions. "When I was
six, I felt like an American girl trapped in a
Chinese body," she explained.
When Tan began writing her book, however,
her early tension between Chinese background
and American upbringing was resolved. She
said her writing helps her form a more stable
identity by forcing her to confront the often
painful and confusing issues of cultural as
similation.
"I don't personally believe Chinese charac
ter and American culture can't mix," Tan said.
Gibbons' work, though less serious in tone,
also revealed the influence of her childhood
experiences. The tone and content of many of
her passages reflected her Southern back
ground and the small, 25-person community
in which she grew up.

Her selections, read from "Ellen Foster"
and "A Virtuous Woman," were humorous in
tone and kept the audience laughing as she
shared the story of a young woman who was
embalming her grandmother.
Gibbons said she had been greatly influ
enced by author Flannery O'Connor's use of
humor to diffuse a potentially maudlin situ
ation.
Both authors suggested that painful child
hood experiences also influenced a writer's
development.
"The writer breed is not raised like everyone
else." Gibbons said. "Every writer who has
made a significant contribution has experi
enced something that made that child feel odd
or estranged from the community.
"I don't think writing is something you
choose to do," she added, explaining that writ
ers write because they need to and are com
pelled from within.
Tan added that in order to be good, people
must write for the sake of writings, not to
publish.
