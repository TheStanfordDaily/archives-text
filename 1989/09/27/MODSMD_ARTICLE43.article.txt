# Professors debate merits of legalized drugs
## 
### Ashok Rai 
Even though two professors
poked fun at the war on drugs
while entertaining new students
at a faculty debate in Dinkelspiel
Auditorium Sunday, they both
recognized the seriousness of the
question of legalizing drugs.
Ron Howard, professor of
engineering-economic systems,
and Senior Lecturer Barry Katz,
who heads the Values, Technology,
Science and Society track of Cul
tures, Ideas and Values, had

similar liberal outlooks, making
the debate less polarized and more
of a entertaining discussion.
Howard and Katz agreed that
the government lies about drug
use and that many of the myths
associated with drugs are a con
sequence of prohibition.
Howard said he believed "peace
ful honest people have the right
to be left alone," and went on to
accuse the U.S. Government of
intruding into the lives of its
citizens. He called for "parent and
individual responsibility" to

counter the drug menace rather
than government intervention.
Katz, however, was skeptical of
this argument for privatization.
He insisted that drugs, especially
crack, should remain illegal be
cause of the "power of the private
sector to mess with our minds"
and sell us goods that are "useless
and sometimes downright danger
ous."
Howard, however, stood his
ground, telling those in the audi
ence who were afraid they might
succumb to the advertising blitz

to "Just say NO!"
The Dinkelspiel audience
seemed to thoroughly enjoy the
humor generated onstage. Katz
acknowledged that the drug prob
lem is "so acute that even the
President of the United States has
noticed it, which is a sure sign
that it may be too late." Howard
likened the government's war
aginst drugs to an "employment
and make-work program" — by
the time the country rids itself of
crack, the real danger will have
become ice, a new amphetamine.
