# P/NC now harder to pass

Students who plan to take pass/no credit
classes this fall will need to work a little
harder to earn a passing grade because of
a redefinition of passing requirements that
will take effect today.
The new grading system will raise the
minimum passing grade from a D- to a C-,
following recommendations by the Univer
sity's Committee on Academic Appraisal
and Achievement.
The P/NC grade option has been popular
among students experimenting with diffi
cult courses since its introduction in 1973,
but committee member Orrin Robinson,
chair of the German Department, foresees
little change in student interest in the op
tion.
"If you elect to take a class, you should
expect to do satisfactory work in that class,
and we feel that a D is less than satisfac
tory," Robinson said. "The changes will
only eliminate those with no intention of
doing satisfactory work."
There are currently two forms of P/NC
grading: student-elected, which is requested
by the student, and instructor-elected,
which includes only courses where no per

manent letter grades are given.
A passing grade in a student-elected
course is recorded as a " -I-" on the student's
transcript, while instructor-elected passes
are represented by a "P." The new system
will retain the " + " but change the "P" to
an "S" for "satisfactory" to indicate that
the student had no choice in the grading
option.
While student reaction is varied, many
students say they are not bothered by the
change and don't see much difference be
tween a C- and a D-.
Sophomore Ellen Posman said, "It is less
stressful to know that I can take a class
for enjoyment without the pressure of
grades, but I don't think the new rule will
change much."
Sophomore Leigh Pryor agreed, adding,
"it would make people feel that they had
to put some effort into a class."
One other academic policy change imple
mented by the committee requires that
midterm exams that fall outside of regular
class hours must be announced during the
first week of classes and reasonable alter
native times for these exams must be of
fered to students.
