The Axe is gone — but not for long
As even the most fatuous frosh has figured
out, the Axe has become the symbol of the rivalry
between Stanford and UC-Berkeley. However, the
home of the Axe, a trophy case in Tresidder
Union, has been empty this year, leading to a
rumor that the Axe had been stolen.
Stanford students can rest assured, however,
that the Axe rests in safe hands. Pat Broun,
chair of the Axe Committee, said it was removed
only for a few days to be cleaned.
It was scheduled to be returned last Thursday,
but Broun said that as an Orientation coordinator
he has been "very, very busy." He promised the
return of the famed weapon early next week.
Finally, there is absolutely nothing to fear. As
Broun said, "We're not hiding it from anyone."

No mo fro yo at the Co Po
Fro yo at Baker Street? It doesn't quite have
the same ring as that time-honored Stanford
phrase "fro yo at the Co Po."
But starting this week, the popular frozen
snack was moved from the Corner Pocket to the
newly remodeled Baker Street, located in a more
central and accessible section of Tresidder Union.
Mary Duffy, director for marketing of Bon
Appetit Co., said the new setup would make
getting fro yo easier and faster for customers,
who formerly had to wait in very long lines to
buy yogurt. New flavors, toppings and non-fat
varieties will also be offered.
Baker Street's other specialties — muffins,
bagels, donuts and other pastries — will remain
the same, but its physical layout has been
redesigned.

Paul Szczesiul, associate director of Tresidder,
explained the changes were part of Tresidder
food service's new approach toward how food
looks and tastes.
But will it still taste the same?

Smokers needed to get patched
Smokers who have tried quitting — unsuccess
fully — at least once can try again using a new
nicotine skin patch offered at Stanford University
Medical Center.
Researchers in the Stanford Stop Smoking Pro
gram need volunteers who smoke at least one
pack of cigarettes per day, are in general good
health and are age 21 to 65. Participants will
receive a free physical examination and will take
part in six evening support group sessions.
Some volunteers will receive skin patches that
release small quantities of nicotine into the skin,
a process believed to help smokers quit. Other
participants will receive placebo patches to de
termine the comparative effectiveness of the nic
otine patches.

A victory for Campbell's team

sofltball team of U.S. Rep. Tom Campbell, the
Stanford law professor who represents Califor
