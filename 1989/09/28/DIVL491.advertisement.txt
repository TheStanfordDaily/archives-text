SOCRATES
COMPUTER CATALOG OF THE LIBRARIES
FREE INSTRUCTION
The Libraries are offering free hands-on instruction for students,
faculty and staff in the use of Socrates, the online library catalog.
Three types of workshops are available: Introduction to Socrates
(for those unfamiliar with Socrates or new Socrates users), and
(for experienced Socrates users interested in efficient ways to
search for library materials in the Humanities and Social Sciences)
Socrates for Humanists and Social Scientists. Each of the science
libraries also offers Socrates training. Contact the reference staff
in the appropriate library for details.
Due to limited class size, advance registration is required. All
workshops will be held in the McDermott Room (Rm 175) in Green
Libary.
