Make the right decision. They did.
Kimberly Lofler, Junior
Macintosh SE user
Over 30,000 Stanford students, faculty,
and staff have purchased Macintosh
computers. There are two great
decisions you can make as a student:
1. Attend Stanford
2. Buy a Macintosh
You've already made one good choice,
now make the other.
