"I feel very strongly about giving
my kids a head start nutrition
ally. At Whole Foods, I can
shop with a clear conscience.
I like the whole approach. The
emphasis is on healthy foods
and good nutrition. Kven the
natural baby food is great.
And it's surprisingly affordable.
I did comparison shopping for
several weeks. I found Whole
Food's prices were comparable
to Safeway, but their product
is superior."
