# Hospital faces waste disposal infractions
## 
### Jock Friedly Editorial staff 
The Santa Clara County district attorney has filed
charges against Stanford University Hospital for
improperly disposing of potentially infectious
hypodermic needles at the Palo Alto landfill.
Hypodermic needles were found to have spilled
out of a sharps container — a heavy plastic red
container for syringes and needles — that was in
correctly mixed with ordinary garbage. "There were
dozens of them spread on the ground," said Clark
Akatiff, a dump employee.
The University faces at least $100 and possibly
as much as $1,000 in fines for the violation of a
business and professional code requiring disposal
methods to make infectious waste "reasonably safe
from an accidental cutting or sticking."
The University, which has taken corrective meas
ures since the district attorney brought charges, is
required to separate the Hospital's infectious waste
from non-infectious waste and to burn the infectious
waste at Stanford's Environmental Safety Facility.
Workers at the landfill discovered the shattered
container with the needles last week and promptly
notified the toxics division of the Santa Clara County
Department of Environmental Health. The health
department notified the district attorney's office,
and the University hauled off the waste, including
the load of noninfectious waste that might have
had contact with the needles.
Hospital officials have still not determined how
the potentially infectious waste became mixed with
the ordinary garbage, but they have narrowed down
the list of possible offenders.
In the past few years, the Hospital has been cited
several times for violations of the waste stream
codes. In an incident Akatiff termed "major," red
bags of infectious waste were found in the Hospital's
waste at the dump two years ago. Other incidents
involved false alarms, in which non-infectious waste
was placed in the containers.
"This is the first time there has been an incident
with syringes," said Manfred Hayes, associate di
rector of the Hospital.
Hayes said that on several occasions, the Hospital
staff has prevented infectious waste from being
mixed in the normal waste stream. "Periodically
our housekeepers have found inappropriate dis
posal," Hayes said.
In an investigation last spring, The Daily found
numerous disposal violations within the Medical
Caiter, none of which indicated a
clear risk to safety, but which
demonstrated that the Medical
Center has had difficulty
complying with regulations.
The Daily found open, full red
bags — the bags used to hold the
infectious waste — with poten
tially infectious waste in an ordi
nary garbage can. The Daily also
found numerous examples of non
infectious garbage mixed in the
red bags. These examples showed
that the Medical Center employees
or students are not all fully aware

of, or are not always careful
about, the regulations on waste
removal.
At least one employee of Health
and Safety, who resigned in
protest over the University's
safety program almost two years
ago, has complained about the
mixing of non-infectious and in
fectious waste.
The University has made the
following changes in its disposal
system since the recent charges
were made:
• The Hospital's loading dock
where all non-infectious waste is
kept has been secured, in order
to screen all the trash going into
the compactor.

• A continuous log of all users
of the compactor has been estab
lished.
• All non-infectious waste ma
terial is screened before it leaves
the Hospital's nursing units.
• An additional inservice train
ing section for all housekeeping
staff on proper handling of infec
tious waste has been conducted.
• All red sharps containers are
being labeled to identify where
each container originated.
• A memo was issued to certain
administrators warning them of
the incident and the Hospital reg
ulations.
Hayes said Hospital administra
tors have learned from the mis
take.
"I think it is an education proc
ess," he said.
