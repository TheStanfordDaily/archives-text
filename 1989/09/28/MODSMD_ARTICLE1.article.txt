# Hospital faces waste disposal infractions

The Santa Clara County district attorney has filed
charges against Stanford University Hospital for
improperly disposing of potentially infectious
hypodermic needles at the Palo Alto landfill.
Hypodermic needles were found to have spilled
out of a sharps container — a heavy plastic red
container for syringes and needles — that was in
correctly mixed with ordinary garbage. "There were
dozens of them spread on the ground," said Clark
Akatiff, a dump employee.
The University faces at least $100 and possibly
as much as $1,000 in fines for the violation of a
business and professional code requiring disposal
methods to make infectious waste "reasonably safe
from an accidental cutting or sticking."
The University, which has taken corrective meas
ures since the district attorney brought charges, is
required to separate the Hospital's infectious waste
from non-infectious waste and to burn the infectious
waste at Stanford's Environmental Safety Facility.
Workers at the landfill discovered the shattered
container with the needles last week and promptly
notified the toxics division of the Santa Clara County
Department of Environmental Health. The health
department notified the district attorney's office,
and the University hauled off the waste, including
the load of noninfectious waste that might have
had contact with the needles.
Hospital officials have still not determined how
the potentially infectious waste became mixed with
the ordinary garbage, but they have narrowed down
the list of possible offenders.
In the past few years, the Hospital has been cited
several times for violations of the waste stream
codes. In an incident Akatiff termed "major," red
bags of infectious waste were found in the Hospital's
waste at the dump two years ago. Other incidents
involved false alarms, in which non-infectious waste
was placed in the containers.
"This is the first time there has been an incident
with syringes," said Manfred Hayes, associate di
rector of the Hospital.
Hayes said that on several occasions, the Hospital
staff has prevented infectious waste from being
mixed in the normal waste stream. "Periodically
our housekeepers have found inappropriate dis
posal," Hayes said.
In an investigation last spring, The Daily found
numerous disposal violations within the Medical
