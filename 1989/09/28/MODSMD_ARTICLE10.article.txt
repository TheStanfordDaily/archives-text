## Canyon plane crash kills 10 
### 
TUSAYAN, Ariz. (AP) - A
sightseeing plane making its final
approach for landing veered into
a wooded hill near the Grand Can
yon Airport yesterday, killing 10
people and injuring the other 11
people aboard, eight critically.
The aircraft's wings were
sheared off by tall Ponderosa
pines but some passengers sur
vived because the fuselage of the
de Havilland DHC-6 Twin Otter
remained largely intact, said
Coconino County Sheriff Joe Ric
hards. The two crew members
were killed, he said.
National Park Service Ranger
Paul Crawford, who was among
the first to reach the wreckage,
said some of the passengers were
walking around when he arrived
at the scene on a small ridge about
300 yards east of a runway.
"They were shellshocked. They
had that empty, dazed look," he
said.
The twin-engine Grand Canyon
Airlines plane was on its second
flight of the day and making its
final approach to the airport when

The survivors 'were
shellshocked. They
had that empty, dazed
look.'

the accident occurred, said Ronald
L. Warren, the airline's vice pres
ident and general manager. He
said it was cleared for landing.
"Preliminary reports indicate
the aircraft touched down nor
mally on the runway, became air
borne again, and veered to the
east side of the airport," he said.
Federal Aviation Administra
tion spokeswoman Elly Brekke
said the plane was about 1,500
feet down the 9,000-foot runway
when it veered to the right, then
to the left and into an open space
where it descended into trees and
crashed, flipping over.
Warren said the plane had left
the airport at 9 a.m. for the one
hour scenic flight, which covers
about 100 miles, and was on

schedule for its arrival when it
crashed at about 9:55 a.m.
All 19 passengers were Ameri
cans, he said. Several were from
California and many were from
the East Coast. Two of the dead
were Modesto, Calif., City Coun
cilman John Sutton and his wife.
Donna.
The airport is located about five
miles south of the Grand Canyon.
Ten of the injured were taken by
ambulance, airplane and helicop
ter to the Flagstaff Medical Center
about 75 miles away.
The injured suffered fractures,
lacerations and head wounds, said
hospital spokeswoman Ann
Hartman-Kolacky. Eight were
listed in critical condition and two
were stable. The 11th person
wasn't brought to the hospital,
apparently because the injuries
weren't that bad, she said.
Warren said the pilot was in his
mid-40s and had worked for the
airline for 40 years. He said the
pilot was also a training officer
and "accustomed to handling un
usual occurances, unusual events.
