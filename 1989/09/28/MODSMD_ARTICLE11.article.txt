Colombian president visits U.S.
BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) — President Virgilio
Barco headed for Washington yesterday to talk
with President Bush about Colombia's war on
drugs after announcing his government had
reached a peace accord with a leading rebel group.
Barco said, however, there would be no peace
for the nation's cocaine cartels. He is to address
the United Nations tomorrow and said he would
ask more countries to help Colombia in its drug
battle.
As Barco began his trip, Britain announced it
will give "substantial" anti-terrorist aid, training,
communications and other help to Colombia in
its drug war. British Foreign Secretary John
Major made the announcement to the U.N. Gen
eral Assembly in New York. He did not mention
a dollar amount.
Before leaving for Washington, Barco told
Colombians that democracy was at stake in the
fight.
"This criminal organization wants to destroy
the most precious thing Colombians have — their
democracy," he said in a surprise nationwide
speech on radio and television late Tuesday.
The peace treaty with the April 19 Movement,
known as M-19, is a major achievement for Barco.
Congressional approval still is needed for mi\jor
aspects of the accord, however.
He said the accord was signed Tuesday after
noon at a guerrilla base camp in Santo Domingo,
a village in the Andes mountains.
The treaty calls for M-19's estimated 2,000
guerrillas to turn in their weapons in exchange
for pardons and the right to form a political party.
The treaty also calls for a national referendum

on 53 proposals, including agrarian reform to
give land to peasants and programs to provide
more housing for the poor.
Angolan guerrillas call for peace
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) — An
golan guerrilla leader Jonas Savimbi has proposed
a five-point peace plan calling for an African
force to supervise a truce in his country's 15-year
civil war, according to reports yesterday from
London and Portugal.
Savimbi's plan, outlined to a congress of his
National Union for the Total Independence of
Angola at his bush headquarters in Jamba, south
eastern Angola, was reported by the British
Broadcasting Corp. in London and Correio da
Manha, a Portuguese newspaper in Lisbon.
The U.S.-backed guerrillas are proposing direct
talks with the Marxist government that won
power shortly after independence from Portugal
in 1975; a cease-fire and release of all political
prisoners; a transitional government of national
unity; immediate re-writing of the constitution;
and free and fair elections.
According to the reports, the plan calls for a
monitoring force from several African nations to
supervise the cease-fire three months after it
begins, formation of a transitional government
within nine months and, six months later, elec
tions supervised by the United Nations and the
Organization of African Unity.
A June 24 cease-fire mediated by Zaire's Pres
ident Mobutu Sese Seko quickly broke down, with
each side blaming the other.
Efforts to bring them together for new talks
have failed.
