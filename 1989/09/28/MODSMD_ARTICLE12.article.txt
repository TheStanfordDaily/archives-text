MANILA, Philippines (AP) —
Vice President Dan Quayle said
yesterday that the Philippines ac
cepted a call for new talks on the
future of U.S. military bases and
expressed hope that a new pact
will provide "for a longtime stay"
here.
"I now have a letter from Pres
ident (Corazon) Aquino respond
ing to a letter I delivered on the
behalf of President Bush in my
possession," Quayle told reporters
during a visit to the Corregidor
battlefield.
"The letter is a positive letter.
We will commence negotiations
and discussions on the future of
the facilities here in the Philip
pines. I am confident we will come
to a mutually acceptable agree
ment. I am also hopeful that that
mutually acceptable agreement
will provide for a longtime stay
by the United States."
The talks are expected to begin
in December. The lease on the six
U.S. bases expires in September
1991 and opposition to them is
growing among Filipinos, who see
the facilities as an infringement
on national sovereignty.
Quayle was to depart later
today for Malaysia.
Yesterday, police hurled tear
gas to disperse 2,000 leftists
demonstrating against Quayle
and the U.S. bases.
His visit was also marked bv

the killing of two American
civilians near a U.S. base hours
before he arrived from Japan on
Monday. Police suspect commu
nist rebels were responsible.
QuayLe pledged thai—the
ambush-slayings would not drive
Americans from the Philippines
and said a majority of Filipinos
want the bases to remain.
"Let me be direct: terrorists will
not drive Americans from the
Philippines," he told U.S. troops
and dependents at Clark Air Base
and the Subic Bay naval base, the
largest of the six American instal
lations here.
Police fired tear gas after dem
onstrators refused to end an anti
base rally near the presidential

palace. Riot police also drove back
hundreds of others who tried to
march to the main gate at Clark
during Quayle's appearance.
Police arrested 157 people for
joining anti-Quayle rallies in the
capital.
Quayle met for about an hour
with Mrs. Aquino early Tuesday
and gave her a letter from Bush
suggesting talks begin in Decem
ber on allowing the bases to
remain.
Mrs. Aquino's executive secre
tary, Catalino Macaraig, said the
government had agreed to the
talks and would give Quayle for
mal notice before he leaves.
Any agreement on extending the
bases' lease must be ratified by
two-thirds of the 23-member Sen
ate, where opposition to the bases
is strong.
Mrs. Aquino, who is to visit
Washington in November, has
refllßed to say whether she will
support a lease extension. She told
Quayle she did not want to discuss
the bases in detail during her
visit, officials said.
In 1985, Mrs. Aquino signed a
manifesto calling for closing the
bases in a move to solidify the
opposition against Ferdinand
Marcos, who was the Philippine
president at that time. But after
taking office in 1986, Mrs. Aquino
said she would keep her options
open.
