# Demonstrators march for desegregation in South Africa

EAST LONDON, South Africa (AP) -
Tens of thousands of protesters demand
ing "justice, peace and freedom" marched
yesterday through an East London
seaside resort in what probably was
South Africa's largest legal demonstra
tion.
In Johannesburg, the city council voted
to desegregate buses, swimming pools
and recreation centers.
The decision to integrate all public fa
cilities controlled by the city, South
Africa's largest, counters wishes of most
white voters who in a poll earlier this
year approved desegregating buses and
recreation centers but opposed opening

"whites-only" pools to blacks.
Among those marching in East London
was the white managing director of the
city's Mercedes-Benz car manufacturing
plant and many of the company's black
employees, who were given the day off
to take part.
Police estimated the crowd at 25,000
to 40,000.
The largest previous government
approved rally was a march in downtown
Cape Town two weeks ago by '20,000 to
25,000 people.
There have been mass demonstrations
across the country since President F.W.
de Klerk announced Sept. 13 that au

thorities would not break up lawful,
peaceful protests.
The East London rally for "justice,
peace and freedom" was led by David
Russell, the Anglican archbishop of
Grahamstown, along with other local
clerics and human rights lawyers.
Protesters clogged the downtown area
and most shops closed for the day. Mar
chers danced, chanted and sang freedom
songs, and some carried the green, gold
and black flag of the outlawed African
National Congress guerrilla movement.
Rally leaders marched to the headquar
ters of the security police and presented
written demands for the release of polit

ical prisoners, legalization of banned op
position groups and lifting of the 3-year
old state of emergency.
There was a heavy police presence, in
cluding armored vehicles and a helicopter.
Rut officers stood aside and no incidents
were reported.
All the approved rallies in the past two
weeks have been peaceful except for some
minor looting at a march last week in
southeastern Pietermaritzburg. In
Pretoria, police used clubs Saturday to
disperse some women trying to proceed
with a protest march that was not au
thorized.
Yesterday's rally was part of a nation

wide protest campaign launched Aug. 2
targeting segregated schools, hospitals,
beaches, buses and other facilities.
In Johannesburg, white students at
Rand Afrikaans University jeered 200
black students who marched yesterday to
protest segregated dormitories. About 75
percent of students at the overwhelmingly
white university voted last week to main
tain segregated residences, the black stu
dents said.
The Johannesburg City Council vote
does not affect schools, neighborhoods or
hospitals that are segregated by national
and provincial laws.
