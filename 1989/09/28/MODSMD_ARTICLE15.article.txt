Tresidder's new look gets
mixed reviews along with
constructive suggestions

MANY OF US waited with
great anticipation for the
transformation of the
c osest thing we have to a student
union. We have witnessed the sir
rival of new management, the con
clusion of the loud and messy
construction, and the equivalent of
culinary musical chairs. The
results are still coming in, but
what we have seen so far is mixed.
On the negative side, there is
the Store. The old Store had char
acter, it had a certain familiarity
to it, and it had such basic staples
as $1.69 Doritos, vitamins and Pez
candy. With the financially lucra
tive Bookstore taking over man
agement of our corner store, we
expected big things and major
changes. We got a new look, rear
ranged shelves, a camera to detect
shop-lifters and computer-aided
check-out machines, but the price
for those changes was costly.
Thousands of students have
eagerly returned to campus only
to be disappointed by the develop
ments at the Store. Where is the
clock? Where is the sign? Where
are the Pez, the $1.69 Doritos and
the vitamins? And why do sodas
cost more? These developments are
disturbing, unsettling and demand
immediate answers.
Students must stay vigilant on
this issue because if we turn our
backs, we may lose the Black Mus

lim Bakery cookies and the Od
walla "Juice for Humans," and
then what will we do?
On a more positive note, the ren
ovation of the rest of Tresidder
has enhanced the union signifi
cantly. There are numerous small
improvements such as better
tasting pizza, the removal of bird
excrement from many of the out
side chairs and a better variety of
items a + the Corner Pocket.
More fundamentally, the
revamped Baker Street offers a
greater abundance of choices (in
cluding salad, no less), and the new
Bon Appetit is the closest thing to
a real restaurant that this campus
has seen in ages. Bravo!
The Coffee House continues to
offer its usual selections (if just a
tad bit overpriced), and remains a
popular gathering place for stu
dents. One suggestion for that
venerable institution is to provide
some coherence to the musical se
lections. Without question, the
music spans a wide spectrum, but
if you happen to come in on a
night when they are playing the
kind of music that you cannot
stand, then you're out of luck. A
schedule of what kind of music will
be played when will go a long way
to alleviate that problem.
On the whole, we must say that,
as the school year begins, we have
a better Tresidder than we did
when classes finished in June.
With just a few minor adjustments
in most areas — and some quick
shoring up of The Store — we can
create the kind of union that offers
the same high standards of excel
lence that we have come to expect
at Stanford.
