## A
						possible solution to drug problem 
### 
National Drug Czar William Ben
nett may be on the right track
with his "boot camp" program for
first-time drug users in Washington, D.C.
For the first time this signals moving
beyond strict enforcement and conven
tional education to deal with the drug
problem.
Still the impression conveyed by
reports so far is that the emphasis is
still too much on punishment and not,
as it should be for first-time offenders,
on improving their outlook and determi
nation to succeed.
Drugs did not originate in the 19605,
but that period saw them become an
important part of American society. The
"innocence" of the middle-class flower
children with their marijuana took a
nasty turn as the years passed and new,
dangerous drugs like crack became avail
able to the poor who did not have the
flower children's option of rejoining so
ciety when they grew up.
Today, millions in the American un
derclass who are at odds with mainstream
society, have escaped from hopelessness,
poverty and responsibility to others by
using and dealing in drugs. It is often
said that the solution to the drug problem
lies in dealing with demand and supply.
That may well be so, but it must be
recognized that the "demand" is fueled
by hopelessness and a declining sense of
personal responsibility to others across
society generally — whether in the upper
strata or the underclass. "Supply," in
turn, provides a way out by creating the
opportunity to make money from the

trade.
The roots of drug abuse and the multi
billion dollar business accompanying it
result from the disjunction of society —
poverty, alienation, declining individual
responsibility and an unwillingness to try
to succeed through personal efforts. For
all their value, the "just say no" cam
paign, typical educational programs, drug
trade interdiction and simple punishment
do not come to grips with these problems.
Clearly law enforcement is critical when
it comes to dealing with drug lords who
demonstrate the operational techniques
of revolutionary leaders, including a will
ingness — if not eagerness — to employ
ruthless methods in exercising power.
We see this on the streets of Miami,
Los Angeles, and Newark. It has reached
its most aggravated form yet in Colombia,
where hundreds of judges, investigative
journalists and others have been mur
dered for trying to enforce the law or

even report on drug dealers and their
activities.
These drug leaders prey on those
seeking to escape from poverty and
responsibilty by selling them drugs or by
drawing them into the business. Many,
revolting against the lives they live and
indifferent to the consequences of their
actions on society, enter the trade.
When Americans become really serious
about resolving the drug problem — and
despite much talk, they are not serious
yet — they will have to go beyond treating
the symptoms and dig down to the roots.
And this brings us back to Bennett's "boot
camp"and other ideas.
Bennett should convene a federal task
force to coordinate and advise, based on
what is learned from the Washington ex
periment and other projects. In addition
to guidance, some federal money should
be made available when it is needed to
fund good programs in states or cities
that are short of cash.
Successful programs, like the boot
camps, will require commitment and
work by everyone involved but they must
offer far more than grueling exercise. To
succeed they must develop hope, confi
dence, purpose, resourcefulness and re
sponsibility, and thus increase both self
esteem, commitment to one's family and
friends and community-mindedness.
These are the qualities to save individuals
as well as civilizations.
