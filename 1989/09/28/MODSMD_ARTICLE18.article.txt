## Freedom of speech debate misrepresented in Daily 
### 
I appreciate the editor's willingness
to print a correction to the article,
appearing in the Sept. 25 edition,
reporting my freshman orientation
"debate" with Prof. William Cohen on
the subject of free speech and racial
harassment.
Unfortunately, the correction was
placed so unobtrusively on the last
page that it reached only a tiny frac
tion of the audience that saw the
original front-page story; moreover, it
did not correct the story with suficient
detail. Therefore, permit me a few
further words in correction.
The Daily story quotes me as taking
a line on the free speech controversy
that would support very broad anti
harassment rules, even recognizing that

It should have been pain
fully obvious that I was
propounding arguments to
which I did not necessarily
subscribe.

they might significantly curtail free
speech.
However, the moderator of the
"debate" Ms. Mica Martin, made it
quite explicit that Professor Cohen and
I were not there to espouse our own
positions. Rather, our goal was to
reconstruct some of the arguments

made on both sides of the debate,
regardless of whether these arguments
reflected the actual views of whichever
one of us was making a particular
argument.
To underscore that format, at several
key points in the "debate" I prefaced a
particular argument in favor of one of
the proposals with wording like "This
is one of the arguments that was
offered for the proposal."
It therefore should have been pain
fully obvious that I was propounding
arguments to which I did not necessar
ily subscribe: our goal was to help
educate new students on the range of
debate that occurred last year and was
likely to recur.
Second, regardless of context, the

story quotes me as uttering one very
odd statement that I can hardly imag
ine ever making, even if I were imput
ing it to others: I am quoted as saying
that under certain circumstances, "The
First Amendment need not be
tolerated."
Only if my goal were to parody, not
to reconstruct, one of the positions
taken in the debate last year would I
have spoken with such hostility toward
the First Amendment. Surely I must
have said something more along the
lines of (again, making the point as a
hypothetical argument) "The First
Amendment need not always be ad
hered to."
