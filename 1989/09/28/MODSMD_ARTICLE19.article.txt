# Campbell's show of wealth repulsive
## 
### 
This letter is in response to Glenn
Campbell*B first letter to the Septem
ber 26 issue of the Daily. I am aston
ished at Mr.Campbell's childish effort
to point out that he is still unfortun
ately around.
It is bad enough that he gets a "six
percent salary increase to $132,000 per
annum," plus each year another such
increase, an office, support staff and
chauffeur, but I find it repulsive that
he brags about it.
I would think that one who accepts
such excess would choose to be modest
about it. I'm surprised Mr. Campbell
didn't put his thumbs in his ears,
wave his fingers, stick out his tongue
and say, "Nannie, nannie, nannie."
