BERKELEY, Calif. — It's not often
California's Harmon Gym is considered
a haven for Stanford sports teams, but
last night was such a night.
After opening with eight straight road
matches, the Cardinal women's volley
ball team showed it was glad to be at
least back in the Bay Area, if not at
home, defeating eighth-ranked Califor
nia 15-3, 15-12, 14-16, 15-5.

Cardinal spikers win 3-1.

The Cardinal had just returned from
a swing to the Midwest where the team
played three matches in 24 hours over
the weekend in a tournament.
"I thought we had a pretty good
match," Cardinal Coach Don Shaw said.
"I think we're a little more tuned in."
Stanford, now 7-2 overall, 3-0 in the
Pacific 10 Conference, finally plays at
home this weekend as Oregon State and
Oregon visit Old Pavilion Friday and
Saturday nights. The Golden Bears fell
to 9-2 with their second consecutive
loss and are 2-1 in the Pac-10.
Stanford again played without senior
setter Lara Asper, who did not suit up
for the contest due to a back injury.
Freshman Carrie Feldman filled in for
Asper and played well according to
Shaw.
"I thought Carrie played great," he
said. "She did everything we asked her
to do. She executed the game plan."
Stanford started very quickly, taking
the first game of the match in a hurry.

'Sometimes teams start
slow. Stanford took it and
started going with it. You
can't give a team like that
anything.'

The Cardinal's passing, which has been
inconsistent this season, was on and
Kristin Klein's hitting and Bev Oden's
blocking kept the 1,407 Cal fans quiet.
Stanford continued strong in the sec
ond game but the Bears came back to
take an 11-8 lead. Stanford rebounded
to tie it at 12 and three Oden blocks
later it was 2-0.
"Sometimes teams start slow," Cal
Coach Dave DeGroot said. "Stanford
took it and started going with it. You
can't give a team like that anything."
Stanford got off to a 10-8 lead in the
third game. Two Lisa Arce kills, how
ever, tied the score. Stanford got a little
ragged at that point, as the team let
two balls drop due to miscommunica
tion. The game went back and forth for
a while, but Cal finally pulled it out
when Klein hit a ball long.
The Cardinal came back strong in the
fourth game, however, racing from 7-5
to 14-5 as senior Laura Olesen served
eight straight points. Tiffany Rochelle
saved two match points with kills for
Bear sideouts but hit long on match
point No. 3 to end the match.
"I thought we played really well, es
pecially the first two games," Feldman
said. "The third game we had a lot of
communication errors. . . . And the
crowd got noisy. But the fourth game
we pulled through and won."
Klein had perhaps her best hitting
night of the season, totaling a match
high 22 kills and hitting for a .439
percentage She also added 13 digs.

Oden had six kills, 10 digs and 10
blocks, Amy Cooper had two aces, 14
digs and nine blocks and Olesen finished
with 13 kills.
Arce had 17 kills, 14 digs and six
blocks to lead Cal. Rochelle finished
with 16 kills and 15 digs, while setter
Holly McPeak had two aces and 15 digs.
The win was the 12th straight for
Stanford over the Bears but ended an
other streak as Cal had not won as
much as a game off the Cardinal since
1985.
Shaw said his team went out with
the idea of serving hard and concen
trating on passing well, and succeeded.
"By starting out serving tough, we
forced them out of whatever offense
they had," he said. "They had to set
high and outside a lot and that's fine
with us. . . . Tonight we served and
passed well."
Feldman agreed. "The passing was
really strong," she said. "We were pass
ing really well. It was the strongest I've
seen in a while."
Feldman made her third start in
Asper's absence last night and is feeling
more and more confident. "Each game
I get a lot more comfortable," she said.
"Oregon State and Oregon this weekend
— hopefully we'll play really well against
them, and that will turn us around and
get us going good."
