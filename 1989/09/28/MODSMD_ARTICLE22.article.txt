# Roggeman reveals Denny Green's soft side
## 
### 
My summer vacation ended early this
year, just as it has for the last four.
Around the middle of August, when
most students begin to get tired of their sum
mer jobs and suntanning starts to get boring-,
the football team reports for pre-season prac
tice. We call it early ball.
Upon arrival, the new coach, Dennis Green,
had posted an ominous message in the weight
room: "All upperclassmen report to the foot
ball stadium on Monday, August 14. Bring
good running shoes."
Rumors started spreading immediately. The
first day of fall camp is traditionally reserved
for a conditioning test. However, we are used
to running wind sprints in cleats, so the com
ment about good running shoes led to wide
speculation over what sort of test we would
run. I heard everything from an early running
of the "Bay to Breakers" to a hard quarter
mile.
I actually started a rumor of my own. I
told everyone Coach Green was going to show
up with marshmallows, graham crackers and
chocolate bars, so we could all make smores.
Not too many people believed it.
As it turned out, we had to run a mile.
The desired time for linemen was 6 minutes,
30 seconds. Weighing in at a not so svelte
250, I hoped the coaches meant six hours and
30 minutes. Wrong.
I survived the mile, moved into Camp Toyon,

and our real practice schedule began the next
day. The wake-up call came in the form of a
bull horn sounded at 6:30 a.m. (there's that
number again). I had not gotten up that early
since my paperboy days.
We ate breakfast and got taped for our 9:00
a.m. practice. The workout ended at around
11:30. The rest of the day consisted of lunch,
meetings, another practice, dinner, more
meetings and lights-out at 11:00 p.m. With
such a busy schedule, days feel like weeks,
and free time is like gold.
Since free time is such a precious entity, it
is crucial to have a good roommate with whom
to spend it. Mine was the same person it has
been for the last three years, Les Archambeau.
The best way Les and I have found to make
the most of free time is by playing cards. Our

favorite game is cribbage because it is rela
tively mindless, and we both think we are
better than each other. Besides, there is no
better way to unwind after a day of fierce
competition than by engaging in a little fierce
cribbage.
Although Toyon is perennially one of the
most popular residences in the Draw, most
of the men on our team could not wait to get
away once the weekend came. The team oasis
is the house owned by Mark Hanson's (NT
'92) parents in Menlo Park. Every weekend
during pre-season practice about 20 to 30
players drop in on Clive and Sue. They always
have plenty of soda and mineral water for the
patch couch potatoes growing in front of their
television screen. I do not understand how
they put up with us.
Maybe the best thing about early ball is
that it ends.
When the week before our first game rolled
around, everybody started to change. The an
noying sticky tape residue that gets caught
in back of our ankles started to disappear,
the offensive linemen stopped hoarding all of
the ice cream sandwiches, and the marks left
from adhesive spray on Chuck Gillingham's
thighs began to fade. All of us were much
happier because we knew that, on Saturday,
we would finally get to hit players from a
different team. I guess we find joy in the
strangest things.
