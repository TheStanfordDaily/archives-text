# Golden State deals Sampson to Kings

OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -
The Golden State Warriors,
who described Ralph Sampson
as a franchise player when they
acquired him two years ago,
traded him to the Sacramento
Kings Wednesday night for
journeyman forward-center
Jim Petersen.
The trade relieves the War
riors of Sampson's $1.9 million
salary and a player who didn't
fit into General Manager and
Coach Don Nelson's plans.
On the other side, it gives
guard-strong Sacramento a
front line of Sampson, Waymon
Tisdale and rookie No. 1 draft
pick Pervis Ellison.
The 7-foot-4 Sampson has
been plagued by knee injuries
ever since he arrived from
Houston with Steve Harris in
a December 1987 trade for Joe
Barry Carroll and Eric

"Sleepy" Floyd. He averaged
just 9.3 points, 6*6 rebounds
and 22.7 minutes in 90 games
as a Warrior.
"The tough part of a trade
is you always lose a player and,
in this case, it is especially
tough because we lost an out
standing player who is also a
terrific person," Sacramento
coach Jerry Reynolds said.
"As far as acquiring Ralph,
I'm extremely thrilled. I know
he'll make a valuable contribu
tion to our team."
Last spring, Nelson said the
1989-90 season would be
"Sampson's year." But the
former University of Virginia
star never fit into the Warriors'
small-sized, up-tempo style,
and the summertime acquisi
tions of 7-footerB Alton Lister
and Uwe Blab made him even
more expendable.
