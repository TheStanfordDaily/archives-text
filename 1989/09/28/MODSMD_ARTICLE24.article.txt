# A's repeat as AL West champs
## 
### 
OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) - Mul
tiple injuries, vastly improved
competition in the American
League West and the no-repeat
jinx — Oakland overcame them
all.
"We should have folded, but we
didn't," first baseman Mark
McGwire said. "That's why this
year is a lot more special. To
repeat, with all the injuries we've
had, is really something."
Oakland clinched the division
title Wednesday night with a 5-0
victory over the Texas Rangers.
It appears the front office
tinkered just enough with the
1988 AL champions' roster to pro
vide a cushion over California and
Kansas City. Two high-priced ac
quisitions — Mike Moore and
Rickey Henderson — ultimately
made the difference.
Moore, whose ERA during seven
seasons with Seattle was 4.38, is
2.68 this year with an 18-11
record. He and Oakland's other
starters (three-time 20-game win
ner Dave Stewart, Bob Welch, and
Storm Davis) make up one of
baseball's best quartets this dec
ade at 74-35. It's just what the
A's were hoping for when they
spent $3.95 million to lure the
free agent with a three-year con
tract.
Henderson, the hometown hero,
scored 512 runs and stole 336
bases during a 4Vfe-year interlude
with the New York Yankees. He
returned on June 21 in the trade
for Luis Polonia, Eric Plunk and
Greg Cadaret and stirred MVP
talk with his superb leadoff skills
and league-leading base-stealing.
"I guess they went out and got

somebody who could get them
over the hump," Henderson said
of his once and current team,
which he expects to re-sign with
in the off-season.
The stalwarts of last year's 104-
58 team again made big contribu
tions — once they had their aches
and pains treated.
Jose Canseco, McGwire, Dennis
Eckersley and Walt Weiss all spent
time on the disabled list but
played well down the stretch. Car
ney Lansford is vying for his sec
ond AL batting crown and has
stolen a career-high 37 bases.
Dave Parker silenced whispers
about the ravages of age by
leading the team in RBIs.
"The one thing I did do — if I
stay here or not — is prove I'm
still an offensive machine," said
Parker, a free agent at season's
end.
Manager Tony La Russa skill
fully juggled his lineup in the
early going, and preached hard
work and an unflappable attitude
that paid off in remarkable con
sistency Oakland has won or tied
41 of its 50 series and never lost
more than four straight games.
The A's have been swept only
twice and suffered only one losing
month, going 13-14 in June.
"Some teams have to put to
gether a streak to stay with the
pack," Dave Stewart said. "We're
the kind of club that just stays
there. Over 10 games another club
might go 9-1 or they might go
1-9. We go 6-4."
The Athletics have been in first
or second place for all but seven
days this season. But in contrast
to last season, when they reeled

off a 14-game winning streak and
breezed to the title by 13 games,
the 1989 race has been tight.
The offense sputtered at times,
particularly during the first-half
absence of Canseco with a broken
left wrist. McGwire, an early in
jury casualty himself (back), is
more than 40 percentage points
off his career .271 average. Dave
Henderson is even further off; last
year he hit a career-best .304 with
24 homers. The A's also missed
Eckersley for 40 days due to a
bad shoulder strain.
They didn't pass the Angels for
good until Aug. 21 when Oakland
beat Detroit 6-1 in the midst of
a five-game winning streak while
California was losing three in a
row.
When Eckersley gave up a
ninth-inning homer for the second
time in a week on Sept. 18, the
A's were in danger of starting a
10-game road trip with four
straight losses and their lead over
the Royals and Angels was poten
tially down to IV2 games. Instead,
Dave Henderson hit a lOth-inning
homer to beat Cleveland, and Oak
land pulled away with victories in
six of its next seven games —
three saved by Eckersley.
Eckersley remains the league's
best closer with 32 saves in 36
opportunities, a 1.50 ERA and a
remarkable strikeouts-to-walks
ratio of 53-3 in 54 innings. Todd
Burns, Rick Honeycutt and Jim
Corsi (combined 2.29 ERA) also
are having outstanding years,
with the bullpen racking up 56
saves, not far off last year's record
of 65.

had, is really something."
Oakland clinched the division
title Wednesday night with a 5-0
victory over the Texas Rangers.
It appears the front office
tinkered just enough with the
1988 AL champions' roster to pro
vide a cushion over California and
Kansas City. Two high-priced ac
quisitions — Mike Moore and
Rickey Henderson — ultimately
made the difference.
Moore, whose ERA during seven
seasons with Seattle was 4.38, is
2.68 this year with an 18-11
record. He and Oakland's other
starters (three-time 20-game win
ner Dave Stewart, Bob Welch, and
Storm Davis) make up one of
baseball's best quartets this dec
ade at 74-35. It's just what the
A's were hoping for when they
spent $3.95 million to lure the
free agent with a three-year con
tract.
Henderson, the hometown hero,
scored 512 runs and stole 336
bases during a 4Vfe-year interlude
with the New York Yankees. He
returned on June 21 in the trade
for Luis Polonia, Eric Plunk and
Greg Cadaret and stirred MVP
talk with his superb leadoff skills
and league-leading base-stealing.
"I guess they went out and got

somebody who could get them
over the hump," Henderson said
of his once and current team,
which he expects to re-sign with
in the off-season.
The stalwarts of last year's 104-
58 team again made big contribu
tions — once they had their aches
and pains treated.
Jose Canseco, McGwire, Dennis
Eckersley and Walt Weiss all spent
time on the disabled list but
played well down the stretch. Car
ney Lansford is vying for his sec
ond AL batting crown and has
stolen a career-high 37 bases.
Dave Parker silenced whispers
about the ravages of age by
leading the team in RBIs.
"The one thing I did do — if I
stay here or not — is prove I'm
still an offensive machine," said
Parker, a free agent at season's
end.
Manager Tony La Russa skill
fully juggled his lineup in the
early going, and preached hard
work and an unflappable attitude
that paid off in remarkable con
sistency Oakland has won or tied
41 of its 50 series and never lost
more than four straight games.
The A's have been swept only
twice and suffered only one losing
month, going 13-14 in June.
"Some teams have to put to
gether a streak to stay with the
pack," Dave Stewart said. "We're
the kind of club that just stays
there. Over 10 games another club
might go 9-1 or they might go
1-9. We go 6-4."
The Athletics have been in first
or second place for all but seven
days this season. But in contrast
to last season, when they reeled

off a 14-game winning streak and
breezed to the title by 13 games,
the 1989 race has been tight.
The offense sputtered at times,
particularly during the first-half
absence of Canseco with a broken
left wrist. McGwire, an early in
jury casualty himself (back), is
more than 40 percentage points
off his career .271 average. Dave
Henderson is even further off; last
year he hit a career-best .304 with
24 homers. The A's also missed
Eckersley for 40 days due to a
bad shoulder strain.
They didn't pass the Angels for
good until Aug. 21 when Oakland
beat Detroit 6-1 in the midst of
a five-game winning streak while
California was losing three in a
row.
When Eckersley gave up a
ninth-inning homer for the second
time in a week on Sept. 18, the
A's were in danger of starting a
10-game road trip with four
straight losses and their lead over
the Royals and Angels was poten
tially down to IV2 games. Instead,
Dave Henderson hit a lOth-inning
homer to beat Cleveland, and Oak
land pulled away with victories in
six of its next seven games —
three saved by Eckersley.
Eckersley remains the league's
best closer with 32 saves in 36
opportunities, a 1.50 ERA and a
remarkable strikeouts-to-walks
ratio of 53-3 in 54 innings. Todd
Burns, Rick Honeycutt and Jim
Corsi (combined 2.29 ERA) also
are having outstanding years,
with the bullpen racking up 56
saves, not far off last year's record
of 65.
OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) - Mul
tiple injuries, vastly improved
competition in the American
League West and the no-repeat
jinx — Oakland overcame them
all.
"We should have folded, but we
didn't," first baseman Mark
McGwire said. "That's why this
year is a lot more special. To
repeat, with all the injuries we've
had, is really something."
