While names like Steve
Smith, Janet Evans and Todd
Lichti fill headlines, McNair
has quietly been leading the
water polo team to national
prominence. As the two-meter
man, a position he compared

to the center on a basketball
team, McNair scored 38 goals
and helped his team capture a
No. 4 national ranking.
McNair, however, doesn't
seem to mind his anonymity.

said McNair, a junior. "I get
embarrassed if someone comes
up to me and says, 'I saw you
playing water polo.' That's not

why I play. I get more satis

being around the guys on the
team. There's a lot of under
standing and close friend
ships."
Last year, McNair was
named to the second team all-
American and second team all-
