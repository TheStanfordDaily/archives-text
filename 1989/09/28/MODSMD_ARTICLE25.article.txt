# McNair quietly paces polo team

Rick McNair?
While names like Steve
Smith, Janet Evans and Todd
Lichti fill headlines, McNair
has quietly been leading the
water polo team to national
prominence. As the two-meter
man, a position he compared

to the center on a basketball
team, McNair scored 38 goals
and helped his team capture a
No. 4 national ranking.
McNair, however, doesn't
seem to mind his anonymity.
"I like to keep a low profile,"
said McNair, a junior. "I get
embarrassed if someone comes
up to me and says, 'I saw you
playing water polo.' That's not

why I play. I get more satis
faction out of winning and just
being around the guys on the
team. There's a lot of under
standing and close friend
ships."
Last year, McNair was
named to the second team all-
American and second team all-

Tournament squad at NCAAs. He
is considered Stanford's "most im
proved player" over the last two
seasons. In addition, at 21, he is
the second youngest player on the
U.S. National team.
"I was extremely intimidated
for three to four months," McNair
said about being one of the team's
youngest members. "The guys are
so much bigger and quicker."
He compared the transition be
tween college and national-level
water polo to the one between
high school and college-level
sports — difficult, to say the least.
"I don't know about everyone
else, but for me, freshman year
was just tough. Dante (Coach
Dante Dettamanti) was constantly
yelling at me. It was a lot of hard
work, and I struggled. But it was
good for me, a character builder,"
McNair said.
"It was brutal (the first year),"
he added. "I traveled, but only
played 16 out of 30 games. And
I didn't get a lot of satisfaction
out of the daily grind."
The "grind" consists of at least
three hours of practice, five-days
a- week, nine months a year.
Games are played on the

weekends.
For McNair, college workouts
are supplemented by national
team practices every other week
end. Come Olympic time, the 18
to 20 member team is cut down
to 12 players, who will compete
as the U.S. Olympic team.
"I'll have to see how things pan
out for '92," McNair said. "It will
depend on how many people retire
and how I do personally."
Making the team also would in
volve moving to southern Califor
nia, where the squad practices
twice daily as the Olympics ap
proach.
Another personal goal for
McNair is winning a national
championship for the Cardinal.
"I'd love to be on a team that
wins a national championship.
There's no reason we can't do it,"
he said.
But McNair did not always
dream of going to the Olympics
or of playing championship
quality water polo.
"I played baseball and soccer
until sixth grade," he explained.
"I also swam, but only in a recrea
tional program on weekends.
When I got to high school, I was
going to play football, but I tried
it for a day and hated it. So I
decided to go out for water polo."
Good choice.
