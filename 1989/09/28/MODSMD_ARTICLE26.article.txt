# Santa Clara survives late Cardinal surge
## 
### Michael Clayton 
Last night, fate played havoc
with the golden plans of the Stan
ford women's soccer team.
After sitting out seven games
because of a sprained ankle suf
fered in an preseason practice, All-
American candidate Heather
Mclntyre prepared to make her
1989 season debut against Santa
Clara at Buck Shaw Stadium.
With the addition Mclntyre, a full
time starter last year, Stanford,
a rising national power, would
seem to be unbeatable.

Feeling "ready to go, ready to
play," Mclntyre began her season
20 minutes into the game. She
felt a little tentative on the field
but knew that her game had re
turned to almost 100 percent.
Despite Mclntyre's successful
entrance and a tremendous come
back, however, fate threw the
plans of the lOth-ranked Cardinal
into temporary confusion. After
falling behind 3-0, the Cardinal
fought back only to leave Santa
Clara with a 4-3 loss.
With the loss the Cardinal fell
to 6-2. The Broncos improved to
7-2.
"It is great to be back and play
ing with the team," said Mclntyre,
a sophomore. "Regardless of the
final score of the game, we felt
satisfied with our effort. We fell
into a three-goal deficit in the first
10 minutes. It's hard to climb out
of a hole like that, but we did.

It's hard to climb
out of a hole like that,
but we did.'

The important thing is that we
never gave up; we have to look
at this game as« a moral victory."
Junior Lisa Sime headed the
fight back by opening Stanford's
scoring nearly midway through
the first half to pull the score to
3-1. She followed with her sixth
goal of the season 20 minutes into
the second half.
"I was very pleased, especially
at this point in the game," Coach
Berhane Andeberhan said. "We
were fighting an uphill battle, and
we refused to lose our com
posure."
The seventh-ranked Broncos,
however, put the game out of
reach with a goal midway through
the second half, making the score
4- 2.
Freshman standout Julie Faudy
finished the Cardinal scoring late
in the game with her eighth goal
of the season.
"The most significant indicator
of this game is the manner in
which we held our composure,"
Andeberhan said. "It was a very
tough game, but we will learn
from it.
"We will look at the mistakes,
realize that soccer is not always
fair, not always logical," he added.
"We will find ways to come back.
It does not feel good right now,
but we will be back."
This weekend will be the team's
first opportunity to compete at
home in front of the recently re
turned Stanford students.
