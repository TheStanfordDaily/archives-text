# Giants fall to LA 1-0, still clinch NL berth

### 
LOS ANGELES (AP) - The
San Francisco Giants matched
their longest losing streak of 1989
Wednesday night, suffered a series
sweep for the first time this
season — and won the National
League West.
While the Giants were losing
their third straight, 1-0 to Tim
Beloher and the Los Angeles
Dodgers, the Cincinnati Reds beat
San Diego 2-1 in 13 innings to
eliminate the Padres.
The Giants needed a victory —
or a Padre loss — to win the
West, but Belcher pitched a four
hitter to deny San Francisco a
chance of doing it on its own for
the third straight day.
San Francisco had not been
swept in a series since July 1988.
The Padres tied Cincinnati 1-1
in the ninth inning and then went
to extra innings.
And the Giants waited, waited
and waited some more before the
Reds finally pulled it out.
Giants manager Roger Craig sat
anxiously in his office awaiting
the results of the Reds-Padres
game.
"It looks like we got to do it
now. All we got to do is go down
there and win one game," Craig
said.
Of the 1-1 tie still being played
out in San Diego, Craig said,
"There's nothing I can do about
it."
"I guess it's good for baseball,"

Craig said with a smile, "but bad
for me."
Giants slugger Will Clark,
facing waves of reporters as he
sat in the clubhouse, said, "We
would have liked to have won it
on the field. But right now, we'll
take it any way we can get it."
And that's just the way the
Giants got it.
Some of the Giants waited to
see if a celebration was in order,
while others drifted out of the
clubhouse.
Belcher, winning for the
seventh time in a row, extended
his mgyor-league leading shutout
total to eight, and also took over
the NL strikeout lead by fanning
11.
Belcher has 200 strikeouts to
196 for Jose DeLeon of St. Louis,
who will get one more start.
Belcher definitely won't, since
he is scheduled to undergo sur
gery Thursday morning for bone
chips in his right, throwing, hand.
The chips obviously haven't both
ered his pitching, but a decision
was made to have them removed,
anyway.
In his final start of the season,
Belcher, 15-12, beat the Giants'
Scott Garrelts. Garrelts, 14-5,
went seven innings, allowing one
run on three hits.
The Dodgers' run came in the
first inning, when Alfredo Griffin
led off with a double, went to third
on a groundout, then scored on
Mike Davis' single.
