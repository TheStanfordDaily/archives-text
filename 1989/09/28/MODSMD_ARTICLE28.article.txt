Stanford 2
Harvard 1

Despite starting five fresh
men, the Cardinal played well
under pressure to even its
record at 4-4-1. The Harvard
win followed a 2-1 victory over
Old Dominion Saturday.
Senior sweeper Mark Semi
oli, a leading candidate for All-
America honors, converted on
a penalty kick 10 minutes into
the first overtime to provide
the winning margin. The goal,
Semioli's fourth on the year,
came after a Crimson player
was called for a hand ball inside
the penalty box.
Harvard's Roger Chapman
started the scoring on a shot
Stanford goalkeeper Kyle
Krpata deflected into the net
while trying to clear a crossing
pass.
The fluke score seemed to

inspire the Cardinal hooters,
who turned up their play a
notch after falling behind 1-0.
"We came out flat and didn't
play well in the first half, but
we changed some things and
came out storming in the sec
ond half," Coach Sam Koch
said.
Senior forward Chris Porch,
who sat out the first half with
a sore hamstring, put Stanford
on the board to knot the score
at 1-1 midway through the sec
ond stanza. Porch scored on a
run up the right side after a
perfect set-up from junior for
ward Todd Caven.
Porch, the squad's second
leading scorer last year, broke
out of a scoring slump, tallying
his first goal this season. Caven
recorded his fourth assist.
After Semioli put the Cardi
nal on top in th 6 first overtime,
the team continued to attack.
"Once Harvard was behind, we
were sure they would press us,"
Koch said.
Sophomore forward Rhett
Harty narrowly missed several
chances to put the game away,
but Krpata stymied the Crim
son on the other end.
Stanford narrowly averted a
tie as a Harvard shot missed
by inches with only two seconds
in the second and final over
time.
