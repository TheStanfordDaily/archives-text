## Eurythmics roll the best into 'One'

THE STANFORD DAILY'S ENTERTAINING WEEKLY

"Revival" is an appropriate title for the Euryth
mics new release â€” especially considering the
renaissance this British duo has recently expe
rienced.
With a new contract from Arista Records,
Dave Stewart and Annie Lennox have put out
an album that will satisfy die-hard Eurythmics
fans, as well as reclaim those who were first
sold on the haunting sound of their blockbuster
debut album "Sweet Dreams."
The new album, "We Too Arc One," is
Eurythmics at their best. The addictive songs
seamlessly combine the duo's early 80's
synthesized-pop roots with a strong shot of
rhythm and blues.
With its synthesized pop intro, "Don't Ask
Me Why" mesmerizes like the 1982 Eurythmics
track "Here Comes the Rain Again." Yet Len
nox's rediscovery of soulful roots catapults
"Don't ask me why" in an entirely new direc
tion.
Likewise, Lennox's vocal acumen effectively
evokes haunting imagery of unfulfilled lives and
dreams in "Angel," "Sylvia," and the dramatic
"You Hurt Me (And I Hate You)."
Just as important as Lennox's vocals is Dave
Stewart's musical genius.
His work in the bluesy and spirited title track
"We Too Are One," reveals R ik B roots and
calls to mind an all-time best Eurythmics hit,
"Missionary Man."
The R & B influence is more clearly evident
in "Revival," a funky tune about getting a new
lease on a tired and mundane life.
More than recent Eurythmics releases "(I Love
To Listen To) Beethoven" and"I Need A Man,"
the tracks on "We Too Are One" better captivate
listeners, drawing them into the Eurythmics'
hypnotic world.
The entire album compels vocally, musically
and lyrically. For the Eurythmics, "We Too Are
One" is verv much a revival.
