# BSU gathering aid for protester
## Incitement charge still pending 
### John Wagner Editorial staff 
As Louis Jackson awaits his
next day in court, the Black Stu
dent Union is spearheading a
drive to convince the administra
tion it should use its influence to
have charges against the student
protester dropped.
Jackson, who is an ASSU
senator and vice chair of the Black
Student Union, is still facing five
misdemeanor charges stemming
from the May 15 takeover of Uni
versity President Donald Ken
nedy's office. The charges —
which include incitement to riot
and battery — carry a maximum
penalty of two years in jail.
Jackson, a junior, is the only
protester who has been charged
with incitement to riot. According
to a police report issued after the
takeover, Jackson incited those
outside Building 10 by telling
them to block a police bus used
to detain arrested protesters.
The same police report reveals,
however, that other protesters
were also inciting the crowd.
Jackson said the district attor
ney told him he was the only per
son inciting the crowd who could
be identified from police
videotapes. "I've been told I was
a special case," Jackson said.
Jackson's distinction by the
Santa Clara County district attor
ney has led the BSU and Keith
Archuleta, director of the Black

Community Services Center, to
believe that racism was behind
the arrest of Jackson, who is
black.
"In this day and age people get
tired if you talk about racism,"
Archuleta said. But, he said, the
apparent inability of the police to
identify others who were inciting
the crowd leaves him very suspi
cious.
According to Archuleta, Jack
son was the only black male
protestor who made speeches to
the crowd outside Building 10
during the takeover.
