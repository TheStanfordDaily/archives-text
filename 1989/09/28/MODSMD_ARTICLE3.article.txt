# BSU gathering aid for protester
## Incitement charge still pending 
### John Wagner Editorial staff 
As Louis Jackson awaits his
next day in court, the Black Stu
dent Union is spearheading a
drive to convince the administra
tion it should use its influence to
have charges against the student
protester dropped.
Jackson, who is an ASSU
senator and vice chair of the Black
Student Union, is still facing five
misdemeanor charges stemming
from the May 15 takeover of Uni
versity President Donald Ken
nedy's office. The charges —
which include incitement to riot
and battery — carry a maximum
penalty of two years in jail.
Jackson, a junior, is the only
protester who has been charged
with incitement to riot. According
to a police report issued after the
takeover, Jackson incited those
outside Building 10 by telling
them to block a police bus used
to detain arrested protesters.
The same police report reveals,
however, that other protesters
were also inciting the crowd.
Jackson said the district attor
ney told him he was the only per
son inciting the crowd who could
be identified from police
videotapes. "I've been told I was
a special case," Jackson said.
Jackson's distinction by the
Santa Clara County district attor
ney has led the BSU and Keith
Archuleta, director of the Black

Community Services Center, to
believe that racism was behind
the arrest of Jackson, who is
black.
"In this day and age people get
tired if you talk about racism,"
Archuleta said. But, he said, the
apparent inability of the police to
identify others who were inciting
the crowd leaves him very suspi
cious.
According to Archuleta, Jack
son was the only black male
protestor who made speeches to
the crowd outside Building 10
during the takeover.
A flier put out by the BSU


Louis Jackson
states that "whether intentional
or not, the prosecution of Louis
Jackson has ugly racial over
tones." The flier charges "Stan
ford University, the Stanford
Police Department and the Santa
Clara District Attorney's office
with contributing to a pattern of
racist treatment of black leaders."
BSU Chair Calvin Martin last
night called the charges against
Jackson a result of "blatant rac
ism." Martin said that "freeing
Louis Jackson" will be the BSU's
main political concern this fall.
BSU efforts currently include a
petition drive and fundraising to
pay Jackson's legal fees. Petitions,
which are being circulated
through residences, call for Ken
nedy to make sure that all charges
against Jackson are dropped.
Kennedy said yesterday that
while he is concerned about Jack
son's case, he does not plan to
ask the district attorney to drop
the charges against Jackson.
Kennedy said he would act in
accordance with the University's
Policy on Arrests and Prosecu
tions. The policy states that once
student arrests have been made,
"the University follows a general
policy of non-interference."
Kennedy said he did not believe
the charges against Jackson were

part of a pattern of racist treat
ment of black leaders.
Martin said he was frustrated
by Kennedy's complacency. "I
think he should take some kind
of stand," Martin said. "We're
taking it as a slap in the face
from the administration."
Archuleta said he thought the
University should feel obligated
to send a message about Jackson's
case to the district attorney's of
fice. While the impetus does not
necessarily have to come from
Kennedy, Archuleta said, the Uni
versity has to tell the district at
torney his treatment of Jackson
"is not tolerable."
If the University is truly com
mitted to multiculturalism, it
should feel obligated to protect
Jackson from unfair treatment,
Archuleta said. "We've got to put
our money where our mouth is."
Asst. District Attorney Tom
Fahrenholz, who is handling the
case, did not return phone calls
yesterday.
Stanford police Capt. Raoul
Niemeyer said yesterday that his
department is refusing to discuss
the accusations of racism. "I have
a feeling that Mr. Jackson is
trying to litigate this through the
media and we're not going to do
that," Niemeyer said. "We're not
about to fall into that trap."
According to a police report,
Stanford police Officer Keith
Viveiros videotaped Jackson out
side Building 10. The report says

that Jackson is "clearly depicted
inciting the crowd" on the tape.
Viveiros recognized Jackson and
knew him by name from previous
demonstrations, the report says.
A supplement to the police
report, written by Viveiros,
recommends "that the District At
torney issue a complaint against
Jackson for violations of trespass
and interfering with lawful busi
ness and battery."
The battery charge Jackson is
facing stems from an encounter
with Mandy MacCalla, a recep
tionist in the President's office.
According to the police report,
Jackson was "one of the individ
uals who initially occupied the
building and grabbed a reception
ist by the elbow and attempted
to force her outside."
MacCalla said in an interview
last night that while Jackson did
place his hands on her, he did
not injure her in any way. "At no
time did I feel physically threat
ened," she said.
MacCalla has signed a civil com
promise agreement saying she has
no complaint against Jackson. In
an Aug. 25 court hearing, how
ever, the judge refused to drop
the battery charge.
Jackson's next hearing date is
scheduled for Oct. 12.
The warrant for Jackson's ar
rest was issued June 9, more than
three weeks after the May 15
takeover of Kennedy's office. Ac
cording to Susan Hoerger, a staff

counsel in the University's legal
office, a delay in issuing charges
is not unusual.
Jackson participated in the May
15 takeover of Building 10 but
left the building before Santa
Clara Country sheriff's deputies
began making arrests that after
noon. Fifty-six protesters were ar
rested for occupying or blocking
access to the building.
According to protesters, Uni

versity administrators agreed on
the day of the takeover that
charges would not be sought
against those who left Kennedy's
office before the arrival of sheriff s
deputies.
However, University Vice Pres
ident and General Counsel John
Schwartz said yesterday that no
such agreement was ever reached.
The police report says that
while Jackson was one of several

people who addressed the crowd
during the takeover, "Jackson did
not merely speak about the cause
of the demonstration."
According to the report: "At one
point, Jackson shouted at the
crowd and, once he had their at
tention, told them that they could
not let the police officers take the
prisoners off the bus and away

from the Stanford campus. He
told the crowd that he was not
going to stand for it and that they
were not to move from blocking
the bus until the students were
released.
"Jackson continued to tell the
crowd that they must prevent the
bus from leaving. He told them
that the police had tow trucks to
remove the blocking cars and the
crowd must go there and stop that
from happening. He further told
them to link arms in front of the
bus."
Forty-seven of the students ar
rested in the takeover entered a
plea of no contest June 5 to the
charge of trespassing. Fahrenholz
dropped four other charges and
Judge Stephen Manley indicated
that the sentence would be 40
hours of community service and
six months probation.
Jackson said he thought it
would be reasonable if his charges
were reduced to match those of
the other protesters. "I could deal
with that," he said.
Stanford's Policy on Arrests and
Prosecutions was drafted in 1985
following an occupation of Old
Union in protest against the Uni
versity's investment policy in
South Africa.
The arrests policy states that
the University will inform police
of a known or suspected crime
and allow law enforcement author
ities to investigate and prosecute

the case as they see fit, without
attempts at intervention in the
process.
According to the policy, Stan
ford "neither 'presses' nor
'withdraws' charges, which as a
matter of law can only be done
by the prosecutor in any event;
nor does it attempt to persuade
or influence authorities in one di
rection or another."
The policy states that the Uni
versity attempts to resolve stu
dent demonstrations "without
recourse to the police."
Once arrests have been made,
however, the University follows a
general policy of non-interference,
the policy says.
According to the policy, "It has
seemed inappropriate for the Uni
versity to make a second judgment
that the particular concerns of
one group are so important, com
pared to those of another, or that
the beliefs of one group are so
sincerely held, compared to those
of another, that it should in the
one case, but not in the other,
seek or support a dismissal of
charges."
