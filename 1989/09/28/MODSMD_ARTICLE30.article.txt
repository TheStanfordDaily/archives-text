# PIZZA
## A 						slice of life turns 100 
### Martha Brockenbrough Editorial staff 
For most Stanford students,
pizza consumption is not just a
hobby — it's a way of life.
Believe it or not, the midnight
snack of choice turns 100 this year.
It's true. Scholars have traced
the origins of the humble pie all
the way back to Mesopotamia in
the 4th century B.C. — where
leavened bread was topped with
game stew — and to the Greeks
and Romans, who preferred using
oil and herbs.
But the modern masterpiece
owes its existence to a Neapolitan
pizzaiolo, Raffaele Esposito.
Legend says Esposito delivered
three different pizzas to the queen
Her favorite, topped with
tomatoes, basil and mozzarella, is
the original from which all modern
pizza has sprung.
In honor of this epic anniversary,
and in celebration of the 2,400
dairy farmers in California who
produce the 100 million pounds of
mozzarella cheese that top our piz
zas, Governor George Deukmejian
has declared October "Real Cali
fornia Cheese Pizza Month."
The Daily is not to be outdone

by Deukmejian, however. In the
spirit of Pizza Awareness, this
week's Intermission is devoted to
the pursuit of the classic Italian
pie.
And so our pursuit does not sink
to the level of the trivial, here are
a few choice tidbits about our fa
vorite cheesy concoction:
• Americans gobble the equiva
lent of 75 acres of pizza every day;
• Thin crust wins the popularity
contest by a slim margin — 48
like their crust thin ; 46 percent
favor the thick stuff, and six per
cent just can't decide;
• Of the 540 million pounds of
cheese produced in California,
nearly 20 percent is scattered on
top of pizzas nationwide;
• Of pizzeria pizza eaten at
home, 32 percent is delivered and
68 percent is carried out;
• Cheese tops the favorite pizza
topping charts, followed by pep
peroni, mushrooms, extra cheese,
sausage green pepper and onion,
according to "Pizza Today";
• "Pizza pie" is redundant; and
• The largest pizza ever made —
100 feet long and one inch wide
— sprang from an oven in Havana,
Florida.
Now isn't that interesting. . . .
