# Pizza guru dishes up some deep wisdom
## 
### Jason Bloomstein Senior staff writer 
Like you, I've had my share of late
night study sessions where I get to
gether with friends, crack open the
books and, of course, order a pizza.
Fortunately for me, tonight my
homework is the pizza itself. The
honor has befallen me to eat many
slices of pizza from different places
in the Bay Area and tell you what I
think. I'm just trying to ao my duty
as a patriotic Califomian to celebrate
the California Real Cheese Pizza
Month.
(Really, though, I'm from the
Chicago area, enough qualifications I
think to be a pizza guru (Go Cubs).
If I can get my fellow pizza con
sumers to agree â€” I'll order from
Round Table Pizza for a good, inex
pensive meal. After cutting through
the small pool of grease on top, 1 am
more often than not delighted with

what I eat.
The flaky crust, which treads the
fine line between wimpy thinness and
overwhelming thickness, is topped
with a generous supply of rich pizza
sauce. Round Table is also not sparing
with toppings. A pepperoni pizza looks
not unlike a pink and purple version
of the surface of the moon.
Best of all, if you can't agree with
your friends on what type ot pizza to
get, Round Table offers personal size
pizza, the kind that looks like those
painted on the cover of microwave
pizza boxes. Tiy not to have a Round
Table pizza delivered, though, if you
want to eat it this vear. My former
suitemates can testify to this.
Real connoisseurs do not limit
themselves to a single establishment.
When I want the toppings piled high,
I mean so high that I can almost
climb on top of it and look down over
Hoover Tower (or Blackwelder
House), I give Ramona's a buzz. The

crust and sauce are somewhat inferior
to Round Table, but you can barely
see them with all the onions and meat
hogging most of the space. Really, the
top of a Ramona's pizza almost looks
as if the cooks sowed seeds of sausage
into the sauce and harvested a bumper
crop. I think you get my point.
Domino's Pizza deserves mention
for what I consider the "loyalty" of a
neighborhood mutt. Say Food Service
cooks up another culinary enigma,
you know in 30 minutes a relatively
decent disc of 'zza will be waiting at
your door.
Being from the Chicago area, the
last place I would consider great pizza
to be from would be Cuba. I've always
associated that island with cigars and
nuclear missiles.
But Jose's incorporates unique and
delightful Cuban cooking with the
even more unusual flair of San Fran
cisco style dough. On a flaky, almost
chewy, sourdough crust, Jose liberally

spreads a tangy, barbeque-style sauce.
The word is the Applewood Inn has
"the best 'roni pizza around," and this
claim is not too far from the truth.
Pepperoni takes on a new meaning
when you bite into a healthy-size slice
of Applewood's pizza, almost suc
culent enough to make vegetarians
reconsider.
Being a die-hard Cardinal basketball
fan, I of course had to try out Frankie,
lohnny, and Luigi, Too because they
host that nifty dough throwing contest
at Maples Pavilion every year.
But when it comes to making ex
cellent, down-home style pizza, they
don't mess around. All the ingredients
are generously apportioned, and the
result is a "classic" pizza, almost a
work of art. I don't dine too often at
Frankie, Johnny, and Luigi, Too (al
though it is a great place to take a
date), because, though they don't pur
port to be Chicago-style, eating their
pizza kind of makes me homesick.
