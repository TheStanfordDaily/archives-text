# Drugs are ruining this country, like the Commies that came before them
## 
### 
Like George Bush says, we gotta do
something about this drug thing. It's an
enormous problem Important enough
that the President went on TV last week
and showed an actual bag of "crack"'
cocaine that drug enforcement agents had
confiscated that same day from the Vice
President.
Drugs didn't used to be this country's
most serious problem During the Reagan
administration, Communism was the big
gest threat to the United States. President
Reagan would give extremely popular
speeches on TV in which he would show
via color charts how, like killer bees, Com
munism was spreading from Central
America up through Mexico and into the
southern United States
It wasn't long, said Reagan, until Texans
would be walking around spouting Com
munist doctrines like "Y'all come back
now, y'hear, comrade." Naturally,
Reagan's inspirational speeches would get
the public all nled up, and before long,
people would get on the phone to call
their Congressmen, who unfortunately
were not available to receive calls as they
were currently committing numerous eth

ical violations, many of which involved
livestock.
So following Reagan's lead, President
Bush made a speech on TV in which he
emphasized the enormity of the drug prob
lem It was a speech watched by a sizeable
audience (approximately the same size as
that garnered by Fox Network for shows
with titles like "America's Most Wanted
Criminals Kill People In Front of the
Camera"), mainly because "Celebrity
Squid Rodeo" had been pre-empted
In the speech, Bush outlined his Three-
Part $8.8 Billion Plan to rid this nation
of drugs, which goes like this:
(1) Congress collects $8 8 billion to fight
drugs.
(2) This takes all the money in the
United States out of circulation.
(3) Cocaine users have nothing to snort
their coke with except cheap plastic straws
and quit out of disgust.
Such a plan is strongly endorsed by
Drug Czar William Bennett, who has
stated that drugs are unquestionably the
greatest of all threats to civilization Of
course, two years ago, when he was Sec

retary of Education, Bennett said that Stan
threats to civilization. Amazing what those
drugs can do to a man
But it's no wonder that Bush is con
cerned. Today's drugs are far more pow
erful and dangerous than the stuff our
parents used to fool around with when
they were in college
It used to be in the '60s you'd go to a
party, maybe take a few tokes of marijuana
or a hit of LSD, and there weren't any
nasty side effects to worry about unless
you count the fact that your kids would
grow up to have the I.Q. of a breath mint.
Today's drugs are newer, synthesized stuff
with officious names like crack, PCP,
MDA and CPPC.
In fact drugs come in entire categories
these days, the most notable being the
Hallucinogens (bromo-mescaline, mush
rooms, Jim Bakker), the Stimulants (caf
feine, amphetamines, amphibians), the
Depressants (cocaine, novocaine, "Black
Rain") and the Stewarts (Ethyl, Leroy, lack,
Sally, Leroy Jr.) Users of these narcotics
may experience diverse sensations: intense
pleasure, wild mood swings, mild or

senous dizziness, the fire within, etc.
Which brings us back to Drug Tsar
William Bennett, who has pledged to put
both the iunkie and the casual user of
drugs behind bars, a pledge that if fulfilled
will nd this nation not only of the scourge
of drugs but also the National Basketball
Association, Guns N' Roses and all 16-
year-old boys.
This is part of the policy of "Zero
Tolerance," which makes the possession
of any amount of illegal drugs a crime
This policy is especially enforced on the
seas, where Coast Guard officials arc al
ford's proposed Western Culture revisions
were unquestionably the greatest of all

lowed to seize boats if they find so much
as one Extra-Strength Tylenol on board.
Of course, while they're arresting the
passengers of a pleasure cruiser for pos
session of recreational drugs, 30 or 40
cargo ships flying the flag of Colombia
float on by. But hey, as Drug Zsa Zsa
William Bennett says: "You've got to draw
the line somewhere (snort]."
Meanwhile, back on land, education is
being used to keep young people from
turning to drugs. For instance, on TV
there are a number of public service an
nouncements in which popular and ex
tremely hairv rock and roll stars such as
lon Bon Jovi tell kids that they don't have
to take drugs to be cool.
Of course, how many kids are going to
sell a million albums and play stadiums
in front of thousands of screaming
teenagers? Let's get real here Every time
/ see the Bon Jovi public service an
nouncement I get the urge to shoot up

Like George Bush says, we gotta do
something about this drug thing. It's an
enormous problem Important enough
that the President went on TV last week
and showed an actual bag of "crack"'
cocaine that drug enforcement agents had
confiscated that same day from the Vice
President.
Drugs didn't used to be this country's
most serious problem During the Reagan
administration, Communism was the big
gest threat to the United States. President
Reagan would give extremely popular
speeches on TV in which he would show
via color charts how, like killer bees, Com
munism was spreading from Central
America up through Mexico and into the
southern United States
It wasn't long, said Reagan, until Texans
would be walking around spouting Com
munist doctrines like "Y'all come back
now, y'hear, comrade." Naturally,
Reagan's inspirational speeches would get
the public all nled up, and before long,
people would get on the phone to call
their Congressmen, who unfortunately
were not available to receive calls as they
were currently committing numerous eth

ical violations, many of which involved
livestock.
So following Reagan's lead, President
Bush made a speech on TV in which he
emphasized the enormity of the drug prob
lem It was a speech watched by a sizeable
audience (approximately the same size as
that garnered by Fox Network for shows
with titles like "America's Most Wanted
Criminals Kill People In Front of the
Camera"), mainly because "Celebrity
Squid Rodeo" had been pre-empted
In the speech, Bush outlined his Three-
Part $8.8 Billion Plan to rid this nation
of drugs, which goes like this:
(1) Congress collects $8 8 billion to fight
drugs.
(2) This takes all the money in the
United States out of circulation.
(3) Cocaine users have nothing to snort
their coke with except cheap plastic straws
and quit out of disgust.
Such a plan is strongly endorsed by
Drug Czar William Bennett, who has
stated that drugs are unquestionably the
greatest of all threats to civilization Of
course, two years ago, when he was Sec

retary of Education, Bennett said that Stan
threats to civilization. Amazing what those
