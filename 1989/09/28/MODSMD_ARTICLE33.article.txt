## Aussie dancers open Lively Arts season 
### 
The Lively Arts at Stanford is kicking off its 20th season — and
the programming has never been better. There's not a more diverse
or stimulating calendar of events anywhere in the Bay Area.
No, this isn't the guy who you down in White Plaza. He's part of
the Sydney Dance Company, the controversial but popular dance
troupe from Down Under. Check out the West Coast premiere of
"Daphnis and Chloe," the Graeme Murphy production that made
this group famous.
And what's more, the company will dance the United States
premiere of Ohad Naharin' "Arbos."
They have been called "wonderfully theatrical, downright
sophomoric, kinky, tongue-in-cheek, out of this world, sexually
precocious. . . an amalgam of high camp, low camp and summer
camp."
Come see what all the noise is about, Tuesday, 8 p.m. in Memorial
Auditorium. Tickets available through Tresidder Ticket Office.
Admission $22, $20, $18, $16.
