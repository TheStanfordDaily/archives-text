# New Vietnam film a big winner
## 
### Gene Anaya Senior staff writer 
If you're tired of this summer's
children's movies, like "Batman"
and "Lethal Weapon II," you
should check out Norman
Jewison's latest film, "In Country."
In a word, it's awesome.
After such atrocious exploitation
films of the Vietnam era as last
year's "1969," this summer's
"Casualties of War," and every
body's favorite, "Platoon," I fully
expected "In Country" to be
saturated with scenes of racial vi
olence directed at innocent Viet
namese civilians, claustrophobic
jungle scenes, college student
protests and other stereotypical
images of the Vietnam War era.
Fortunately, I was disappointed.
But only in this respect.
Even with Bruce Willis in a
sensitive role with facial hair, "In
Country" captures all that a movie
can and should be. To fully ap
preciate Willis' performance, you
should forget his previous roles and
simply accept him as "Emmett,"
a country boy who served his time

"in country" during the Vietnam
War and never fully returned
home.
Although Willis gets top billing,
it is Emily Lloyd's superb perform
ance as Samantha Hughes, Em
mett's niece and high school
graduate in Hopewell, Kentucky,
that makes the film. Sam is strug
gling with the troubles of growing
up (boyfriends, college, a friend's
unexpected pregnancy) while at the
same time trying to learn about
the war that killed her father before
she was even born — a war that
no one wants to talk about.
It is the sincerity and innocence
that Lloyd breathes into her char
acter that gives Sam, the southern

accented blonde, depth and spirit.
In her quest to learn about the
father she never knew, Sam
catches a glimpse of a distant
world with "Bouncing Betties" and
"cliques" — a world in which men
took ears off the dead as souvenirs.
Frank Pierson and Cynthia
Cidre's excellent screenplay
balances the mood between
everyday humor and the somber
issues related to the Vietnam War.
Pierson and Cidre should be lauded
for their success in avoiding the
pitfalls of resorting to sentimental
and stereotypical images and
dialogue related to the Vietnam
War in adapting Bobbie Ann
Mason's book of the same name.
The only let-down in the plot
occurs at the end of the film when
Sam and Emmett take a trip to
Washington, D.C. to visit the Viet
nam War Memorial. Their charac
ters are developed well enough that
it isn't necessary that they go
through a Hollywood-style ending.
Not to say that the final scenes
at the wall aren't moving; it's just
that the film could have stood on
its own without them.
