# 'Romero' worthy of being labeled powerful
## 
### Elizabeth Laurence 
A lot of movies labeled "power
fill" and "important" have graced
the silver screen in recent years â€”
and John Duigan's "Romero"
stands solidly in their ranks.
In 1977 El Salvador's Church,
controlled by the country's military
dictatorship, appointed Oscar
Romero as Archbishop. The
Church expected that frail, bookish
Romero would not make waves.
But the military assassination of
Romero's friend, the zealous
Father Grande (Richard Jordan),
drove Romero from his study to
the front lines of the battle against
government repression.
In a short time Romero, played
by Raul Julia, transformed the
Church from a government puppet
to a voice and comforter of the
people. But Romero's humanitar
ianism cost him his life.
His actions were so controversial
that fliers bearing the words, "Be
a patriot, kill a priest!" circulated.
In 1980, just three years after his
appointment, Romero was shot to
death at the altar.
"Romero" combines this true
story with compelling cinematog
raphy and a capable cast to create
a rich, multifaceted film.
Julia skillfully conveys Romero's
metamorphosis from a distant in
tellectual to a leader.
Mute at the sight of Father
Grande's corpse, Romero later
finds the courage to accuse El Sal
vador's President of lying about

Grande's death.
Nonetheless, Julia convincingly
portrays Romero's discomfort as a
leader outside his preferred aca
demic environment.
Careful filming of faces spot
lights the inner turmoil of Sal
vadorans torn between allegiance
to church and state.
Romero himself struggles to rec

oncile religious conviction with
self-preservation.
Jumping from bloody massacres
to aristocratic soirees, the camera
captures vast division between El
Salvador's economic classes. Del
icate baroque music ironically ac
companies brutal scenes.
The murder of a high-born min
ister of agriculture who favored

land reform prevents viewers from
condemning the upper class as a
whole.
The greatest success of Romero
is its thorough portrayal of a com
plex story.
Because the film does not get
mired in a single issue, it provides
a vivid picture of Romero's trans
formation and martyrdom.
