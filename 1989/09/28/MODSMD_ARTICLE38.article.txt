# Only a sprinkle despite forecast of heavy 'Rain'

### Jason Moore 
Imagine a pizza made with
the most mouth-watering ingre
dients that but only manages
to satisfy hunger, and really
doesn't taste better than any
other pizza. "Black Rain" is that
type of film.
Starring Michael Douglas,
"Black Rain" is fairly exciting,
although it fails to realize its
full potential.
After opening scenes that es
tablish the film's corrupt-cop
subplot and the übiquitous
presence of motorcycles, the
film kicks into gear when Nick
Conklin (Michael Douglas) and
Charlie Vincent (Andy Garcia)
witness the assassination of a
couple of Japanese mobsters.
Bold New York cops that they
are, Nick and Charlie pursue
the killers. Moments after ap
prehending Sato, the main as
sassin, Nick leams that he and
Charlie must escort the suspect
to Osaka, Japan.
Predictably, Sato escapes.
Nick and Charlie are forced to
work with the Japanese author
ities to catch their man., and
from that point on, the story
offers no real surprises.
Lack of an original plot is
only one of the flaws that keep

the film from being exceptional.
The dialogue, particularly
Douglas' lines, sounds like it
was written by a couple of writ
ers fired from"The Streets of
San Francisco."
Screenwriters Craig Bolotin
and Warren Lewis briefly touch
upon some intriguing ideas —
the rebellion of Japan's youth
against tradition, the demotion
of Americans to objects of en
tertainment, and the psycholog
ical effects of the atomic
bombing of Hiroshima.
Yet, the writers never pene
trate the surface of these issues.
Other flaws include the ne
glect of Kate Capshaw and the
premature exit of Andy Garcia's
character.
Visually, "Black Rain"
delivers the goods. Director Rid
ley Scott's camera captures
Osaka as a modern version of
Scott's 1982 film, "Blade Run
ner."
The two bright spots in the
cast are Andy Garcia and Ken
Takaura. Garcia proves to be a
charming, likeable counter
weight to a satisfactory
Douglas. As assistant Inspector
Masahiro, the Osaka cop as
signed to Nick and Charlie,
Takaura effectively portrays his
character's inner conflict.
