# 'Innocence' gone, Henley still stunning
## 
### Mark Pinkus 
The question of the evening at the
Shoreline Amphitheatre last Saturday
was what Eagles classics Don Henley
would revive. A stranger sitting next to
me even bet me a dollar that I was wrong
when I told him "Desperado" was a def
inite.
The two of us, along with a near sold
out crowd, waited in anticipation for
Henley. The crowd was all the more
eager because Henley hasn't toured ex
tensively since 1985, and his new album
has spent the better part of two months
on Billboard's Top Twenty.
After a somewhat engaging 45-minute
set by Edie Brickell and the New
Bohemians, Henley finally hit the stage,
joined by a very impressive seven-piece
band and three useless back-up singers.
Looking like he could be Bono's father,
the black-clothed, ponytail-sporting Hen
ley spent most of the first hour playing
songs from his latest release.
Anyone who thought Henley was still
the same down-home Texan who sang
about such party-time issues as booze
and women has failed to listen to his
latest lyrics.
In case the biting words from the new
album didn't properly spotlight Henley's
political bent, he introduced certain
songs — like his new single "If Dirt were

Dollars" — with such remarks as, "I
read an article about Reagan and Star
Wars and now I officially pronounce
today as 'Screw Reagan Day."'
Henley's complex lyrics separate him
from the average singers and writers
tooting their horns about political causes,
though. The lyrics, coupled with his pow
erful yet fragile voice, leave the listener
entertained and reflective.
The title track off the first album,
Henley's third number, is a perfect ex
ample. "The End of Innocence" lyrics
invite the audience to contemplate such
lines as "But happily ever after fails/ And
we've been poisoned by these fairy tales/
Offer up your best defense/ But this is
the end/ This is the end of innocence."
New songs dominated the first -Hour,
although "Sunset Grill," a tune from
"Building the Perfect Beast," Henley's
second solo album, rose above the rest.
His on-stage intensity even topped the
studio version.
At this point Henley must have
realized that the crowd wouldn't get up
out of their seats and dance unless he,
as he put it, took "a trip down memory
lane."
These words alone were enough to get
the crowd up and screaming.
Few classic rock songs seem timeless,
and when Henley took a familiar seat
behind the drums for "Hotel California,"

he offered up one of those rare perform
ances. The familiar guitar conclusion
was awesome in its perfection.
But wait — there was more. Staying
behind his drums for one more song,
Henley scorched the audience with "Life
in the Fast Lane." The 12-year-old lyrics
haven't lost an ounce of their original
potency.
The set closed after just an hour and
a half with a tight rendition of "Boys of
Summer." Henley returned for a second
and final encore, and although it lasted
only two songs, he made the best of,
them.
As expected, he played "I Will Not Go
on Quietly," as his back-up band tried
to fill the shoes of Axl Rose, the back-up
singer on the album.
Once things settled down a bit and
band introductions were out of the way,
the piano hit the opening notes of the
song so many were waiting for. My
honorable neighbor forked over the dol
lar, and couples put their arms around
each other as Henley moved the audience
with "Desperado."
In these twilight moments of the show,
it became clear why Henley was such a
force in the seventies and again in the
eighties. Few musicians combine pas
sion, honesty and talent the way Henley
does.
