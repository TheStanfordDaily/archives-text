# Music Dept. to tune up auditorium's acoustics
## 
### Jock Friedly Editorial staff 
To better Dinkelspiel Auditori
um's less-than-outstanding acous
tics, the Music Department has
begun a several-year renovation
that is expected to cost hundreds
of thousands of dollars.
So far, officials in the School of
Humanities and Sciences have al
located about $125,000 to the
Music Department for Dinkelspiel
improvements, but the depart
ment hopes to receive much more
money over the next few years to
further the planned renovations.
Many of the renovations were
suggested by an acoustician who
tested the auditorium in the
spring. His finding that the
auditorium needs a host of im
provements came as no surprise
to those familiar with the hall.
Student musicians say they
have had to deal with the acousti
cally lackluster hall for years and
with noisy activities outside the
hall, including toilet flushing, that

have often affected the many doz
ens orf concerts, musicals and
operas performed each year in the
720-seat hall.
The renovation involves mostly
small changes to the building
rather than major structural
changes. For example, the air sys
tem is being cleaned, the
entrances to the auditorium will
be fitted with acoustically sealed
sets of double doors and the toilets
in the lobby bathrooms will be
fitted with quieter parts.
The acoustician's recommenda
tions, developed with the help of
department members, are for the
most part settled, but details of
the future renovations are not en
tirely secure.
"What has to happen in the fu
ture is under study," said John
Planting, manager for the Music
Department.
The Music Department has been
stymied in past years by tight
funding, and the current budget
crisis in the School of Humanities
and Sciences may slow the im
provements even more.
