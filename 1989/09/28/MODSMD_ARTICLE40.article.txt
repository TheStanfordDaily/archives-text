# Shaffer's album good 'Coast to Coast'
## 
### Tim Marklein Editorial staff 
You see him every night with David
Letterman, but it's time to "say hello"
to Paul Shaffer in a whole new way.
With the release of a new album, it's
time the talents of Paul and"The World's
Most Dangerous Band" were taken
seriously. "Coast to Coast" should do
just that.
With blues, jazz, rap, pop and funk
songs, "Coast to Coast" is Paul's version
of a party in major cities throughout the
United States. Using songs that try to
represent the flavor of New Orleans,
Chicago, New York, Miami, Memphis,
Los Angeles, Detroit and Minneapolis,

Paul and the band present a virtual
panorama of United States music.
The guest musicians on the album far
outnumber the city count. Ben E. King,
Wilson Pickett, The Tower of Power
Horns, The Fresh Prince, Brian Wilson
and George Clinton just begin the list.
Add to that the normal dangerous band
members • Sid McGinniss, Will Lee and
Anton Fig - and you have a cornucopia
of talented musicians.
Unlike his mimicking antics on "Late
Night," Paul's playlist is nothing imita
tive. Even a cover of "Louie Louie" has
the usual deadpan delivery characteristic
of Shaeffer, a pleasant surprise compared
to many cover tunes that try to duplicate
the original.

The best song is the first single, "When
the Radio Is On," a tune that jams with
a mixture of rap and soul to proclaim
the greatness of New York radio.
During the summer break when only
reruns of Letterman are shown around
the country, Paul made a stop at Mil
waukee's Summerfest music extravagan
za, playing to two standing room
audiences at the Miller Jazz Oasis.
Judging from the fun that both crowds
were having, about 90 percent of the
audiences will probably buy the album.
Paul said the mini-tour provided a wel
come break, proving to fans that the
band can play more than 10 seconds of
a song. Alter this album, nobody will
settle for less.
