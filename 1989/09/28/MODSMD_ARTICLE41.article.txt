# No radio silence
## Soviet's debut has promise 
### Tim Marklein Editorial staff 
Eurythmics mastermind Dave Stewart
is involved in more "projects" than
anyone in the music business, and Boris
Grebenshikov may be his best gamble yet.
The liner notes include a journalist's
praise that the Soviet "re-introduces us
to all that made rock 'n' roll so vital in
our own lives, only now — historically
— through the vision of a Russian
songwriter/ poet who isn't a stranger, but
belongs here."

The praise is fitting, and Boris seems
to be the driving force behind the album,
even under Stewart's production. The first
single, "Radio Silence," is a riveting ex
ample of Grebenshikov's power, coupled
with lyrics of a singer waiting to reach
a mass audience.
The song's lyrics show Grebenshikov's
anticipation for this moment: "It's
strange I don't feel like a stranger/ I feel
like I belong here/ I feel like I've been
waiting for a long time/ And now I can
tell you some stories."
I'm anxiously waiting to hear more.
