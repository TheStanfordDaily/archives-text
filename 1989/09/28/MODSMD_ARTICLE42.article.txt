# Let the good taste, not the decor, fool you at Fontana's

When you're looking for Fon
tana's Italian Restaurant, don't
pass up the coffee-shop-looking
place on the right as you're driving
north through Menlo Park that's
Fontana's Italian.
The atmosphere in some areas
of this high-class Italian restaurant
is not up to par with its cuisine.
Near the entrance is a Denny's-like
kitchen where chefs work behind
a tall counter. Unless you like
seeing the person who creates your

dinner, request a table near the
back.
And because Fontana's Italian is
popular, it tends to be noisy and
crowded. Try another place if
you're looking for candlelight and
soft music. Don't let this deter
you from experiencing this fantas
tic restaurant, though. Fontana's
Italian food and service more than
make up for what it lacks in am
bience.
Because Fontana's Italian spe
cializes in fish, my guest and I
started our gastric adventure with

the Caliman Fntti recommended
by our server, Steve. An inexpen
sive, yet enthralling appetizer, the
squid was fried in a light batter
and topped with rich marinara
sauce and agiago cheese.
But the calimari was a mere
f>relude in comparison to the next
evel of dining.
From the vast selection of pastas
on the menu, we chose Fettuccini
Contadina. The delectable cream
sauce and fresh, perfectly steamed
vegetables beautifully offset the
marinara of the appetizer. In ad

dition, the portion was generous
one order more than satisfied the
two of us.
Next came Minestrone Soup, a
selection that later seemed inap
propriate in the context of our en
tire menu. Perhaps we were
anxious to get to the main entree,
but the soup was not as satisfying
as our other selections.
Our main entree choice was
standard: Veal Parmigiana. Beyond
compare as far as taste, appear
ance, portion size and dressing

(gorgeously rich tomato sauce and
cheese), the veal was, unfortunate
ly, sliced too thinly. Regardless, it
was a wonderful climax to the
night's Italian fare.
The dessert that followed was
consistent with Fontana's Italian
style beautifully prepared and de
licious. The name captures the
rapture Pure Chocolate Decadence,
a sliver of pure chocolate sur
rounded by raspberries and
whipped cream.
Prices are comparable to most

decent Italian restaurants a good
meal ranges anywhere from $25
to $50 per couple.
Don't look for pizza here,
though. The humble pie is below
Fontana's Italian's high cuisine.
It's a great place to go for fan
tastic Italian food but you may
want to try another place if you're
asking someone to marry you.
Fontana's Italian is located at
1825 El Camino Real in Menlo
Park. Call 321-0601 for reserva
