# 'Uncommon women' shines despite common beginning
## 
### Martha Brockenbrough Editorial staff 
Reunions — and the accompa
nying trips down memory lane —
are among the flimsiest gimmicks
in show business.
And "Uncommon Women and
Others" opens and concludes with
one of the most uninspired
reunions imaginable.
Picture seven squealing Mount
Holyoke classmates meeting in a
restaurant lounge for the first time
in six years. The acting in this
first scene was too exaggerated to
be convincing, and the set would
have been impossible to identify
as a lounge without the program
notes.
It is unfortunate that Pulitzer
prize winning playwrite Wendy
Wasserstein used this cheap tactic
to introduce her characters. Yet the
script, and later examples of re

spectable acting, overcame this
early offense. The rest of the play
easily justified the cost of a ticket.
A series of recollections from
members of the class of 1972, "Un
common Women and Others" stirs
up issues that still touch college
women — relationships, the con
tradiction of traditional "gracious
living" with ambition, and insecu
rity about the future and the
seemingly endless transitions that
it entails.
Amy Michelle Prosser, although
overbearing in the restaurant
scene, later offered one of the play's
better moments as her character,
Muffet, struggled to reconcile fem
ininity with feminism. Prosser
spoke convincingly of her desire to
"meet her prince" while retaining
her identity afterwards.
Yet even the most independent
characters of the play had their
problems.

Laurie Fosner played Kate, an
outwardly independent, career
oriented soul. Yet at the reunion,
Kate admitted that her chosen path
was a lonely one. "It never occurred
to me that anyone wouldn't want
me to be quite so uncommon."
Issues like these are broached
with honesty and sensitivity, yet
Wasserstein doesn't insult the au
dience with pat solutions.
Although women may identify
with the characters in this produc
tion more readily than men, "Un
common Women and Others" is
apt entertainment for both halves
of the Stanford audience.
