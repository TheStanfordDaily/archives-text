# Fac Sen to re-examine ties with Hoover
## 
### Brad Hayward Editorial staff 
The Faculty Senate, meeting this afternoon,
may create a new committee that would study
ways in which to "restructure relations" be
tween the Hoover Institution and the rest of
the University.
The resolution calling for the faculty com
mittee originated in the spring of 1988, when
57 faculty members signed a petition asking
the Board of Trustees to either bring Hoover
under "normal academic governance" or end
relations between the think tank and Stan
ford.
The Faculty Senate revised the resolution
in October, toning it down to a call for a
committee to define the concept of normal
academic governance and then consider ways
in which relations could be restructured.

English Prof. Ronald Rebholz and Political
Science Prof. John Manley initiated the peti
tion drive. "The essential problem is Hoover's
independence [from the University]," Manley
told the Senate.
Both Rebholz and Manley are long-time crit
ics of Hoover.
Consideration of the resolution in October
was delayed following a request from Univer
sity President Donald Kennedy to avoid
making new arrangements until a new Hoover
director could be appointed. The Senate agreed
to take up the issue again at its first session
this fall.
Former Hoover director W. Glenn Campbell
stepped down from his post Aug. 31 and as
sumed his new position as counselor to the
institution. Deputy director John Raisian be
came acting director while the search for a
permanent director continued.

Campbell warned at an Aug. 30 press con
ference that "all hell will break loose" if Ken
nedy and Provost James Rosse "don't repel
the Huns . . . and protect the independence
of the Hoover Institution."
The Senate's intentions may not be as
threatening as Campbell maintains. The res
olution being considered today includes lan
guage suggested in a letter by Political Science
Prof. Alexander George and 16 colleagues
delivered to the Senate in October:
"Normal academic governance does not
mean tight central control and the loss of
proper academic independence," the letter
reads. "We do not believe Hoover scholars
need fear that closer relations will mean out
side domination."
In 1985, however, 40 senior researchers at
Hoover told the Senate, "We believe that the
existing rules (of governance) are sound.
