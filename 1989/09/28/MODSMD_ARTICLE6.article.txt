## 
### Raoul Mowatt Staff writer 
Members of the Class of 1991
gathered to recall past achieve
ments and set the tone for the
remainder of their undergraduate
years at yesterday's Junior Con
vocation.
Like Tuesday's Sophomore
Celebration, the Junior Convoca
tion provided opportunities to
renew long-standing friendships
and to make new ones.
The Convocation also symboli
zes a turning point in a student's
academic career. After having ex
plored a variety of interests, most
third-year students begin in-depth
coursework for their msyors.
To mark the significance of the
change, the Convocation was a
more formal program, held in
Memorial Church with a full com
plement of organ music. The
Sophomore Celebration, in con
trast, featured the Stanford Band
in the less somber Frost Amphi
theater.

Also attending the Convocation
were representatives from the
Stanford community, including
faculty and trustees, who ex
pressed both praise and advice for
the juniors.
In the keynote address, Ewart
Thomas, dean of the School of
Humanities and Sciences, re
flected on the importance that
1991 will have for both the junior
class and for the University.
According to Thomas, the Con
vocation is really a celebration of
the latitude that is possible in the
present academic system.
Originally, Stanford was
marked with sharp divisions be
tween underclassmen and upper
classmen, Thomas said. Gradually,
these divisions have weakened to
the point where any students can
take distribution requirements or
graduate-level courses more free
ly-
Juniors should realize "the im
portance of self-definition and the
burden of autonomous decision,"
Thomas added.

"Thomas was inspirational and
entertaining," said Jill Banatoski,
a biological sciences major.
University President Donald
Kennedy, in his address to the
junior class, expressed hopes that
declaring a would "be a
source of joy, as curiosity gives
way to mastery,"he said.
Dean of Undergraduate Studies
Thomas Wasow urged juniors to
seek individualized programs and
research opportunities. "These ac
tions involve taking the initiative
and knocking on lot of doors, but
it's worth it,"he said.
Anna Scott, an anthropology
welcomed her classmates
back to what she called "this mul
tifaceted, multicultural,
multimoney-taking place." She
then read six original poems in
her first public reading
A second performer, Sean Bot
kin, recipient of the Humanities
and Sciences Award in Music,
played a piano selection from
Liszt's Transcendental Etude.
