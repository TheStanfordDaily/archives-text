Party to benefit hurricane victims
The Phi Delts are having a party — and this
one is serving more than one "social purpose."
The fraternity has pledged $500 to help victims
of Hurricane Hugo, which struck the South
Carolina coast with 135 mph winds a week ago.
The storm may be the nation's costliest ever; the
economic toll for South Carolina alone ranges
from $1 billion to $3 billion.
The storm also left up to 75,000 people out
of their homes this week.
Phi Delt members will be collecting donations
at tonight's party to add to their own donation.
All donations will be given to the Red Cross, and
those who give $1 or more will receive an armband
with the Red Cross emblem on it.
The party starts tonight at 9:30 at the Phi
Delt house.
