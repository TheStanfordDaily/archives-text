# Debate over free speech rages on college campuses

### Amy Rosenfeld Editorial staff 
A recent outbreak of racial incidents
on the nation's college campuses has led
to vigorous debate over how far a uni
versity can go in prohibiting racial and
other forms of harassment without
violating First Amendment rights to
freedom of expression.
At several schools across the country,
including the University of Michigan,
Brown University, Emory University,
the University of Wisconsin system and
the University of California system, the
debate has precipitated the establish

ment of new anti-harassment policies or
the amendment of existing student con
duct codes.
Michigan's policy overturned
The question of whether these policies
violate the First Amendment was tested
directly last month when a University
of Michigan anti-harassment policy was
ruled unconstitutional in U.S. District
Court.
The first such challenge to a univer
sity harassment policy, the suit was filed
by the American Civil Liberties Union
on behalf of a Michigan graduate stu
dent.

The initial policy, which was imple
mented in the spring, would punish stu
dents for such offenses as hanging a
Confederate flag on a dormitory door
or saying women are not as skilled in
sports as men, according to Noah Finkel,
a reporter at The Michigan Daily.
Michigan attorney Elsa Cole, who
wrote the original policy, said it was
motivated by a series of incidents in the
winter of 1987 including racist fliers in
dorms and racist jokes broadcast on the
campus radio station.
Robert Sedler, the ACLU attorney
who represented the student, described
the language of the policy as "overbroad

and vague," adding, "You can't prohibit
ideas no matter how offensive they are."
There were about 45 complaints filed
under the policy, but only one went all
the way to a hearing, Cole said. She
stressed that in every case where a stu
dent was disciplined, the punishment
was agreed upon by each party involved.
However, Stanford Law Prof. Gerald
Gunther called the history of cases ex
amined under the Michigan policy a
"horror story." Gunther, who has read
the text of the trial and decision, said
most of the Michigan complaints were
filed by white students against minority
students â€” "to some extent" the oppo

site of the policy's original intent to
protect minority students.
In one instance, Gunther said, a black
student used the term "white trash"
when talking with a white student, who
later filed a complaint. The black student
was subsequently required to write a
three-page letter of apology to the white
student. In other instances, students
were required to write apologies which
were published in the campus newspa
per.
The University of Michigan has until
Oct. 8 to appeal the decision. Although
