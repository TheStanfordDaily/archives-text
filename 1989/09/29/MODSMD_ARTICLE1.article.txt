# Debate over free speech rages on college campuses
## 
### Amy Rosenfeld Editorial staff 
A recent outbreak of racial incidents
on the nation's college campuses has led
to vigorous debate over how far a uni
versity can go in prohibiting racial and
other forms of harassment without
violating First Amendment rights to
freedom of expression.
At several schools across the country,
including the University of Michigan,
Brown University, Emory University,
the University of Wisconsin system and
the University of California system, the
debate has precipitated the establish

ment of new anti-harassment policies or
the amendment of existing student con
duct codes.
Michigan's policy overturned
The question of whether these policies
violate the First Amendment was tested
directly last month when a University
of Michigan anti-harassment policy was
ruled unconstitutional in U.S. District
Court.
The first such challenge to a univer
sity harassment policy, the suit was filed
by the American Civil Liberties Union
on behalf of a Michigan graduate stu
dent.

The initial policy, which was imple
mented in the spring, would punish stu
dents for such offenses as hanging a
Confederate flag on a dormitory door
or saying women are not as skilled in
sports as men, according to Noah Finkel,
a reporter at The Michigan Daily.
Michigan attorney Elsa Cole, who
wrote the original policy, said it was
motivated by a series of incidents in the
winter of 1987 including racist fliers in
dorms and racist jokes broadcast on the
campus radio station.
Robert Sedler, the ACLU attorney
who represented the student, described
the language of the policy as "overbroad

and vague," adding, "You can't prohibit
ideas no matter how offensive they are."
There were about 45 complaints filed
under the policy, but only one went all
the way to a hearing, Cole said. She
stressed that in every case where a stu
dent was disciplined, the punishment
was agreed upon by each party involved.
However, Stanford Law Prof. Gerald
Gunther called the history of cases ex
amined under the Michigan policy a
"horror story." Gunther, who has read
the text of the trial and decision, said
most of the Michigan complaints were
filed by white students against minority
students — "to some extent" the oppo

site of the policy's original intent to
protect minority students.
In one instance, Gunther said, a black
student used the term "white trash"
when talking with a white student, who
later filed a complaint. The black student
was subsequently required to write a
three-page letter of apology to the white
student. In other instances, students
were required to write apologies which
were published in the campus newspa
per.
The University of Michigan has until
Oct. 8 to appeal the decision. Although
The history of cases
examined under the
Michigan policy is a
'horror story.'
— Gerald Gunther

Sedler said he doesn't think an
appeal is likely, he added that "it
doesn't matter" because he
believes the decision "will be up
held" anyway.
In the meantime, Cole said,
Michigan has adopted an interim
policy which "much more nar
rowly defines prohibitive speech"
as an "epithet, slur or invective
with a discriminatory animus di
rected toward an individual with
intent to injure or harm."
The interim policy is effective
until Dec. 31, when a permanent
policy will take its place, Cole said.
She said she believes the new
policy is "narrow enough that
there should not be a constitu
tional problem."
Stanford's controversy
The debate came to Stanford in
March when the Student Conduct
Legislative Council, the body re
sponsible for changes to the be
havior code, proposed a
controversial interpretation of the
University's Fundamental Stand
ard.
The initial interpretation
asserted that all members of the
Stanford community have a right
to be free from personal attacks
which "by accepted community
standards degrade, victimize, stig
matize or perjoratively
characterize them on the basis of
personal, cultural or intellectual
diversity." The statement was also
designed to apply to defamation
of groups.
The SCLC's actions were
precipitated by a number of racist
events on campus, including the
posting of racist fliers in Ujamaa
House and the repeated harassing
of a resident assistant in Otero
House by a student who made ho
mophobic remarks.
Outcry from community mem

bers, who argued the interpreta
tion violated the fundamental
right to freedom of speech and
debate, led to a revamping of the
proposal in May.
The second interpretation nar
rowed offenses to "harassment by
vilification" and "fighting words"
which are addressed directly to
an individual or group of persons
and "commonly understood to
convey, in a direct and visceral
way, hatred or contempt" of those
people on the basis of "sex, race,
color, handicap, religion, sexual
orientation or national and ethnic
origin."
According to Stanford Judicial
Affairs Officer Sally Cole, the sec
ond draft of the proposal will be
considered by this year's SCLC.
However, she added, all the ap
pointments for the committee
must be made before the amend
ment can be released for public
debate and reviewed.
Stanford Law Prof. Thomas
Grey, who was a member of the
SCLC last year and helped to
rework the initial proposal, said
he is planning to submit a slightly
altered proposal to this year's
SCLC. Grey's interpretation is "in
substance" the same as last year's
revamped form and will be "con
sistent with the court decision"
in the Michigan case, he said.
The proposal, which will be
made available to the public next
week, will confine the definition
of harassment to "fighting words"
against an individual or small
group, exempting any kind of gen
eral discussion, such as in a class
room, Grey explained.
The term "fighting words"

comes from the 1942 U.S. Su
preme Court case Chaplinsky v.
New Hampshire. The decision
qualified the First Amendment to
prohibit speech directed toward
an individual or group of individ
uals which is likely to evoke a
violent reaction.
Both Grey and Gunther said it
is difficult to predict what effect
the Michigan decision will have
on proceedings at Stanford and
agreed that the Michigan policy
was broader than the second
Stanford proposal.
Because Stanford is a private
university, the court decision in
volving Michigan, a public school,
is "not directly relevant" to Stan
ford, Grey said. However, the
Stanford administration wants to
be consistent with the Constitu
tion, he said.
The University has made a vo
luntary commitment to the com
munity to enforce the First
Amendment, Gunther said, adding
that this "can be a legally enforce
able commitment."
Debate at other schools
The question of whether the
right to be free from harassment
and the right to freedom of speech
can be reconciled is being dis
cussed at several other univer
sities, both private and public,
throughout the United States.
Emory, Brown and the Wiscon
sin and UC systems have all re
cently adopted anti-harassment
policies.
According to Emory's Campus
Life Handbook for 1989-90, a
policy was implemented this year
which states that "harassment of
any person or group of persons
on the basis of race, color, na
tional origin, religion, sex, sexual
orientation, age, handicap or vet
eran status is a form of discrim
ination specifically prohibited in
the Emory University communi
ty-"
The policy further qualifies this
harassment as "epithets, demean-

ing depictions ... or threatened
or actual abuse or harm" which
have "the purpose or reasonably
forseeable effect of creating an of
fensive, demeaning, intimidating
or hostile environment" for those
being harrassed.
A similar policy was adopted at
Brown last spring. According to
Dean of Students David In man,
the issue was in committee when
homophobic and racist graffiti
were discovered in a dorm. This
incident prompted Brown's new
President Vartan Gregorian to
bypass the committee and imme
diately establish an effective
policy in consultation with uni
versity lawyers, Inman said.
The policy is essentially a
revised form of the sexual har
assment section of Brown's Stand
ards of Student Conduct, Inman
said. It defines harassment as "the
subjection of another person,
group or class of persons to in
appropriate, abusive, threatening
or demeaning actions based on
race, religion, gender, handicap,
ethnicity, national origin or sexual
orientation."
The policy is "self-regulating"
and only put into effect if a stu
dent complains, Inman said.
Since both Brown and Emory
are, like Stanford, private univer
sities, they also are not legally
bound to uphold the First Amend
ment, and both policies state that
they are not intended to limit
scholarly debate or the free ex
change of ideas.
Yet Inman said Brown "sets
very high academic standards and

very high community standards,"
and since the university is a
private association of people, the
First Amendment does not neces
sarily apply. Inman added that
there has not been a community
uproar in reaction to the policy.
Issues at public schools
The issue has been a little trick
ier at the California and Wiscon
sin statewide universities. As
public systems, the schools are re
quired to abide by the Constitu
tion.
According to Patricia Hodulik,
an attorney for the Wisconsin sys
tem, an amendment to the exist
ing student conduct code was
implemented Sept. 1. The policy,
which was over a year in the
making, was preceded by a series
of racist events on campus, she
said.
Under the new code, "racist and
discriminatory comments, epi
thets or behavior directed at an
individual or small group" are
prohibited, Hodulik said. It is fur
ther necessary to prove "intent to
create an intimidating or hostile
environment" and "intent to
demean," she said.
Since the school year has just
begun, there have not been any
cases tried under the policy, she
said, but added that she knows
of a few under investigation.
The student body has been
"relatively supportive" and reac
tion "generally favorable," but
there is always a chance that,
since Wisconsin is a public system,
the policy will be challenged in

court, Hodulik said.
The Wisconsin American Civil
Liberties Union has threatened to
sue but has yet to follow up on
this threat, Hodulik said. "We'll
just have to wait and see," she
said, adding that the Michigan
policy was "quite a bit broader"
than Wisconsin's.
The new policy in the UC sys
tem also runs the risk of being
challenged in court. However, ac
cording to Rick Malaspina, a
spokesperson for the system,
while the policy may invite chal
lenges, UC attorneys "are confi
dent they're on firm legal
ground."
On Sept. 21, UC President Da
vid Gardner sent a letter to the
chancellors of all nine UC schools
amending the system's existing
Student Conduct Policy.
The new policy prohibits the
use of "personally abusive epi
thets . . . inherently likely to
provoke a violent reaction." These
epithets include "derogatory ref
erences to race, ethnicity, religion,
sex, sexual orientation, disability
and other personal characteris
tics" which might lead to a "hos
tile and intimidating
environment."
In his letter, Gardner wrote
that the UC system strives for
campuses that "foster the values
of mutual respect and tolerance
and are free from discrimination."
While the policy is not intended
to limit free speech, it recognizes
that "words can be used in such
a way that they no longer express
an idea, but rather are used to
injure and intimidate, thus un
dermining the ability for individ
uals to participate" in university
life, Gardner wrote.
It remains to be seen how uni
versities will resolve the conflict
between free speech and freedom
from harassment. However, what
ever they decide, it is sure to be
an issue that will dominate aca
demic life this year and extend to
other areas of society.

cently adopted anti-harassment
policies.
According to Emory's Campus
Life Handbook for 1989-90, a
policy was implemented this year
which states that "harassment of
any person or group of persons
on the basis of race, color, na
tional origin, religion, sex, sexual
orientation, age, handicap or vet
eran status is a form of discrim
ination specifically prohibited in
the Emory University communi
ty-"

ing depictions ... or threatened
or actual abuse or harm" which
have "the purpose or reasonably
forseeable effect of creating an of
fensive, demeaning, intimidating
or hostile environment" for those
being harrassed.
A similar policy was adopted at
Brown last spring. According to
Dean of Students David In man,
the issue was in committee when
homophobic and racist graffiti
were discovered in a dorm. This
incident prompted Brown's new
President Vartan Gregorian to
bypass the committee and imme
diately establish an effective
policy in consultation with uni
versity lawyers, Inman said.
The policy is essentially a
revised form of the sexual har
assment section of Brown's Stand
ards of Student Conduct, Inman
said. It defines harassment as "the
subjection of another person,
group or class of persons to in
appropriate, abusive, threatening
or demeaning actions based on
race, religion, gender, handicap,
ethnicity, national origin or sexual
orientation."
The policy is "self-regulating"
and only put into effect if a stu
dent complains, Inman said.
Since both Brown and Emory
are, like Stanford, private univer
sities, they also are not legally
bound to uphold the First Amend
ment, and both policies state that
they are not intended to limit
scholarly debate or the free ex
change of ideas.
Yet Inman said Brown "sets
very high academic standards and

very high community standards,"
and since the university is a
private association of people, the
First Amendment does not neces
sarily apply. Inman added that
there has not been a community
uproar in reaction to the policy.
Issues at public schools
The issue has been a little trick
ier at the California and Wiscon
sin statewide universities. As
public systems, the schools are re
quired to abide by the Constitu
tion.
According to Patricia Hodulik,
an attorney for the Wisconsin sys
tem, an amendment to the exist
ing student conduct code was
implemented Sept. 1. The policy,
which was over a year in the
making, was preceded by a series
of racist events on campus, she
said.
Under the new code, "racist and
discriminatory comments, epi
thets or behavior directed at an
individual or small group" are
prohibited, Hodulik said. It is fur
ther necessary to prove "intent to
create an intimidating or hostile
environment" and "intent to
demean," she said.
Since the school year has just
begun, there have not been any
cases tried under the policy, she
said, but added that she knows
of a few under investigation.
The student body has been
"relatively supportive" and reac
tion "generally favorable," but
there is always a chance that,
since Wisconsin is a public system,
the policy will be challenged in

court, Hodulik said.
The Wisconsin American Civil
Liberties Union has threatened to
sue but has yet to follow up on
this threat, Hodulik said. "We'll
just have to wait and see," she
said, adding that the Michigan
policy was "quite a bit broader"
than Wisconsin's.
The new policy in the UC sys
tem also runs the risk of being
challenged in court. However, ac
cording to Rick Malaspina, a
spokesperson for the system,
while the policy may invite chal
lenges, UC attorneys "are confi
dent they're on firm legal
ground."
On Sept. 21, UC President Da
vid Gardner sent a letter to the
chancellors of all nine UC schools
amending the system's existing
Student Conduct Policy.
The new policy prohibits the
use of "personally abusive epi
thets . . . inherently likely to
provoke a violent reaction." These
epithets include "derogatory ref
erences to race, ethnicity, religion,
sex, sexual orientation, disability
and other personal characteris
tics" which might lead to a "hos
tile and intimidating
environment."
In his letter, Gardner wrote
that the UC system strives for
campuses that "foster the values
of mutual respect and tolerance
and are free from discrimination."
While the policy is not intended
to limit free speech, it recognizes
that "words can be used in such
a way that they no longer express
an idea, but rather are used to
injure and intimidate, thus un
dermining the ability for individ
uals to participate" in university
life, Gardner wrote.
It remains to be seen how uni
versities will resolve the conflict
between free speech and freedom
from harassment. However, what
ever they decide, it is sure to be
an issue that will dominate aca
demic life this year and extend to
other areas of society.
A recent outbreak of racial incidents
on the nation's college campuses has led
to vigorous debate over how far a uni
versity can go in prohibiting racial and
other forms of harassment without
violating First Amendment rights to
freedom of expression.
At several schools across the country,
including the University of Michigan,
Brown University, Emory University,
the University of Wisconsin system and
the University of California system, the
debate has precipitated the establish

ment of new anti-harassment policies or
the amendment of existing student con
duct codes.
Michigan's policy overturned
The question of whether these policies
violate the First Amendment was tested
directly last month when a University
of Michigan anti-harassment policy was
ruled unconstitutional in U.S. District
Court.
The first such challenge to a univer
sity harassment policy, the suit was filed
by the American Civil Liberties Union
on behalf of a Michigan graduate stu
dent.

The initial policy, which was imple
mented in the spring, would punish stu
dents for such offenses as hanging a
Confederate flag on a dormitory door
or saying women are not as skilled in
sports as men, according to Noah Finkel,
a reporter at The Michigan Daily.
Michigan attorney Elsa Cole, who
wrote the original policy, said it was
motivated by a series of incidents in the
winter of 1987 including racist fliers in
dorms and racist jokes broadcast on the
campus radio station.
Robert Sedler, the ACLU attorney
who represented the student, described
the language of the policy as "overbroad

and vague," adding, "You can't prohibit
ideas no matter how offensive they are."
There were about 45 complaints filed
under the policy, but only one went all
the way to a hearing, Cole said. She
stressed that in every case where a stu
dent was disciplined, the punishment
was agreed upon by each party involved.
However, Stanford Law Prof. Gerald
Gunther called the history of cases ex
amined under the Michigan policy a
"horror story." Gunther, who has read
the text of the trial and decision, said
most of the Michigan complaints were
filed by white students against minority
students — "to some extent" the oppo

site of the policy's original intent to
protect minority students.
In one instance, Gunther said, a black
student used the term "white trash"
when talking with a white student, who
later filed a complaint. The black student
was subsequently required to write a
three-page letter of apology to the white
student. In other instances, students
were required to write apologies which
were published in the campus newspa
per.
The University of Michigan has until
Oct. 8 to appeal the decision. Although
The history of cases
examined under the
Michigan policy is a
'horror story.'
— Gerald Gunther

Sedler said he doesn't think an
appeal is likely, he added that "it
doesn't matter" because he
believes the decision "will be up
held" anyway.
In the meantime, Cole said,
Michigan has adopted an interim
policy which "much more nar
rowly defines prohibitive speech"
as an "epithet, slur or invective
with a discriminatory animus di
rected toward an individual with
intent to injure or harm."
The interim policy is effective
until Dec. 31, when a permanent
policy will take its place, Cole said.
She said she believes the new
policy is "narrow enough that
there should not be a constitu
tional problem."
Stanford's controversy
The debate came to Stanford in
March when the Student Conduct
Legislative Council, the body re
sponsible for changes to the be
havior code, proposed a
controversial interpretation of the
University's Fundamental Stand
ard.
The initial interpretation
asserted that all members of the
Stanford community have a right
to be free from personal attacks
which "by accepted community
standards degrade, victimize, stig
matize or perjoratively
characterize them on the basis of
personal, cultural or intellectual
diversity." The statement was also
designed to apply to defamation
of groups.
The SCLC's actions were
precipitated by a number of racist
events on campus, including the
posting of racist fliers in Ujamaa
House and the repeated harassing
of a resident assistant in Otero
House by a student who made ho
mophobic remarks.
Outcry from community mem

bers, who argued the interpreta
tion violated the fundamental
right to freedom of speech and
debate, led to a revamping of the
proposal in May.
The second interpretation nar
rowed offenses to "harassment by
vilification" and "fighting words"
which are addressed directly to
an individual or group of persons
and "commonly understood to
convey, in a direct and visceral
way, hatred or contempt" of those
people on the basis of "sex, race,
color, handicap, religion, sexual
orientation or national and ethnic
origin."
According to Stanford Judicial
Affairs Officer Sally Cole, the sec
ond draft of the proposal will be
considered by this year's SCLC.
However, she added, all the ap
pointments for the committee
must be made before the amend
ment can be released for public
debate and reviewed.
Stanford Law Prof. Thomas
Grey, who was a member of the
SCLC last year and helped to
rework the initial proposal, said
he is planning to submit a slightly
altered proposal to this year's
SCLC. Grey's interpretation is "in
substance" the same as last year's
revamped form and will be "con
sistent with the court decision"
in the Michigan case, he said.
The proposal, which will be
made available to the public next
week, will confine the definition
of harassment to "fighting words"
against an individual or small
group, exempting any kind of gen
eral discussion, such as in a class
room, Grey explained.
The term "fighting words"

comes from the 1942 U.S. Su
preme Court case Chaplinsky v.
New Hampshire. The decision
qualified the First Amendment to
prohibit speech directed toward
an individual or group of individ
uals which is likely to evoke a
violent reaction.
Both Grey and Gunther said it
is difficult to predict what effect
the Michigan decision will have
on proceedings at Stanford and
agreed that the Michigan policy
was broader than the second
Stanford proposal.
Because Stanford is a private
university, the court decision in
volving Michigan, a public school,
is "not directly relevant" to Stan
ford, Grey said. However, the
Stanford administration wants to
be consistent with the Constitu
tion, he said.
The University has made a vo
luntary commitment to the com
munity to enforce the First
Amendment, Gunther said, adding
that this "can be a legally enforce
able commitment."
Debate at other schools
The question of whether the
right to be free from harassment
and the right to freedom of speech
can be reconciled is being dis
cussed at several other univer
sities, both private and public,
throughout the United States.

the way to a hearing, Cole said. She
stressed that in every case where a stu
dent was disciplined, the punishment
was agreed upon by each party involved.
However, Stanford Law Prof. Gerald
Gunther called the history of cases ex
amined under the Michigan policy a
"horror story." Gunther, who has read
the text of the trial and decision, said
most of the Michigan complaints were
filed by white students against minority
students — "to some extent" the oppo

site of the policy's original intent to
protect minority students.
In one instance, Gunther said, a black
student used the term "white trash"
when talking with a white student, who
later filed a complaint. The black student
was subsequently required to write a
three-page letter of apology to the white
student. In other instances, students
were required to write apologies which
were published in the campus newspa
per.
The University of Michigan has until
Oct. 8 to appeal the decision. Although

Sedler said he doesn't think an
appeal is likely, he added that "it
doesn't matter" because he
believes the decision "will be up
held" anyway.
In the meantime, Cole said,
Michigan has adopted an interim
policy which "much more nar
rowly defines prohibitive speech"
as an "epithet, slur or invective
with a discriminatory animus di
rected toward an individual with
intent to injure or harm."
The interim policy is effective
until Dec. 31, when a permanent
policy will take its place, Cole said.
She said she believes the new
policy is "narrow enough that
there should not be a constitu
tional problem."
Stanford's controversy
The debate came to Stanford in
March when the Student Conduct
Legislative Council, the body re
sponsible for changes to the be
havior code, proposed a
controversial interpretation of the
University's Fundamental Stand
ard.
The initial interpretation
asserted that all members of the
Stanford community have a right
to be free from personal attacks
which "by accepted community
standards degrade, victimize, stig
matize or perjoratively
characterize them on the basis of
personal, cultural or intellectual
diversity." The statement was also
designed to apply to defamation
of groups.
The SCLC's actions were
precipitated by a number of racist
events on campus, including the
posting of racist fliers in Ujamaa
House and the repeated harassing
of a resident assistant in Otero
House by a student who made ho
mophobic remarks.
Outcry from community mem

bers, who argued the interpreta
tion violated the fundamental
right to freedom of speech and
debate, led to a revamping of the
proposal in May.
The second interpretation nar
rowed offenses to "harassment by
vilification" and "fighting words"
which are addressed directly to
an individual or group of persons
and "commonly understood to
convey, in a direct and visceral
way, hatred or contempt" of those
people on the basis of "sex, race,
color, handicap, religion, sexual
orientation or national and ethnic
origin."
According to Stanford Judicial
Affairs Officer Sally Cole, the sec
ond draft of the proposal will be
considered by this year's SCLC.
However, she added, all the ap
pointments for the committee
must be made before the amend
ment can be released for public
debate and reviewed.
Stanford Law Prof. Thomas
Grey, who was a member of the
SCLC last year and helped to
rework the initial proposal, said
he is planning to submit a slightly
altered proposal to this year's
SCLC. Grey's interpretation is "in
substance" the same as last year's
revamped form and will be "con
sistent with the court decision"
in the Michigan case, he said.
The proposal, which will be
made available to the public next
week, will confine the definition
of harassment to "fighting words"
against an individual or small
group, exempting any kind of gen
eral discussion, such as in a class
room, Grey explained.
The term "fighting words"

comes from the 1942 U.S. Su
preme Court case Chaplinsky v.
New Hampshire. The decision
qualified the First Amendment to
prohibit speech directed toward
an individual or group of individ
uals which is likely to evoke a
violent reaction.
Both Grey and Gunther said it
is difficult to predict what effect
the Michigan decision will have
on proceedings at Stanford and
agreed that the Michigan policy
was broader than the second
Stanford proposal.
Because Stanford is a private
university, the court decision in
volving Michigan, a public school,
is "not directly relevant" to Stan
ford, Grey said. However, the
Stanford administration wants to
be consistent with the Constitu
tion, he said.
The University has made a vo
luntary commitment to the com
munity to enforce the First
Amendment, Gunther said, adding
that this "can be a legally enforce
able commitment."
Debate at other schools
The question of whether the
right to be free from harassment
and the right to freedom of speech
can be reconciled is being dis
cussed at several other univer
sities, both private and public,
throughout the United States.
Emory, Brown and the Wiscon
sin and UC systems have all re
cently adopted anti-harassment
policies.
According to Emory's Campus
Life Handbook for 1989-90, a
policy was implemented this year
which states that "harassment of
any person or group of persons
on the basis of race, color, na
tional origin, religion, sex, sexual
orientation, age, handicap or vet
eran status is a form of discrim
ination specifically prohibited in
the Emory University communi
ty-"
The policy further qualifies this
harassment as "epithets, demean-

ing depictions ... or threatened
or actual abuse or harm" which
have "the purpose or reasonably
forseeable effect of creating an of
fensive, demeaning, intimidating
or hostile environment" for those
being harrassed.
A similar policy was adopted at
Brown last spring. According to
Dean of Students David In man,
the issue was in committee when
homophobic and racist graffiti
were discovered in a dorm. This
incident prompted Brown's new
President Vartan Gregorian to
bypass the committee and imme
diately establish an effective
policy in consultation with uni
versity lawyers, Inman said.
The policy is essentially a
revised form of the sexual har
assment section of Brown's Stand
ards of Student Conduct, Inman
said. It defines harassment as "the
subjection of another person,
group or class of persons to in
appropriate, abusive, threatening
or demeaning actions based on
race, religion, gender, handicap,
ethnicity, national origin or sexual
orientation."
The policy is "self-regulating"
and only put into effect if a stu
dent complains, Inman said.
Since both Brown and Emory
are, like Stanford, private univer
sities, they also are not legally
bound to uphold the First Amend
ment, and both policies state that
they are not intended to limit
scholarly debate or the free ex
change of ideas.
Yet Inman said Brown "sets
very high academic standards and

very high community standards,"
and since the university is a
private association of people, the
First Amendment does not neces
sarily apply. Inman added that
there has not been a community
uproar in reaction to the policy.
Issues at public schools
The issue has been a little trick
ier at the California and Wiscon
sin statewide universities. As
public systems, the schools are re
quired to abide by the Constitu
tion.
According to Patricia Hodulik,
an attorney for the Wisconsin sys
tem, an amendment to the exist
ing student conduct code was
implemented Sept. 1. The policy,
which was over a year in the
making, was preceded by a series
of racist events on campus, she
said.
Under the new code, "racist and
discriminatory comments, epi
thets or behavior directed at an
individual or small group" are
prohibited, Hodulik said. It is fur
ther necessary to prove "intent to
create an intimidating or hostile
environment" and "intent to
demean," she said.
Since the school year has just
begun, there have not been any
cases tried under the policy, she
said, but added that she knows
of a few under investigation.
The student body has been
"relatively supportive" and reac
tion "generally favorable," but
there is always a chance that,
since Wisconsin is a public system,
the policy will be challenged in

court, Hodulik said.
The Wisconsin American Civil
Liberties Union has threatened to
sue but has yet to follow up on
this threat, Hodulik said. "We'll
just have to wait and see," she
said, adding that the Michigan
policy was "quite a bit broader"
than Wisconsin's.
The new policy in the UC sys
tem also runs the risk of being
challenged in court. However, ac
cording to Rick Malaspina, a
spokesperson for the system,
while the policy may invite chal
lenges, UC attorneys "are confi
dent they're on firm legal
ground."
On Sept. 21, UC President Da
vid Gardner sent a letter to the
chancellors of all nine UC schools
amending the system's existing
Student Conduct Policy.
The new policy prohibits the
use of "personally abusive epi
thets . . . inherently likely to
provoke a violent reaction." These
epithets include "derogatory ref
erences to race, ethnicity, religion,
sex, sexual orientation, disability
and other personal characteris
tics" which might lead to a "hos
tile and intimidating
environment."
In his letter, Gardner wrote
that the UC system strives for
campuses that "foster the values
of mutual respect and tolerance
and are free from discrimination."
While the policy is not intended
to limit free speech, it recognizes
that "words can be used in such
a way that they no longer express
an idea, but rather are used to
injure and intimidate, thus un
dermining the ability for individ
uals to participate" in university
life, Gardner wrote.
It remains to be seen how uni
versities will resolve the conflict
between free speech and freedom
from harassment. However, what
ever they decide, it is sure to be
an issue that will dominate aca
demic life this year and extend to
other areas of society.
A recent outbreak of racial incidents
on the nation's college campuses has led
to vigorous debate over how far a uni
versity can go in prohibiting racial and
other forms of harassment without
violating First Amendment rights to
freedom of expression.
At several schools across the country,
including the University of Michigan,
Brown University, Emory University,
the University of Wisconsin system and
the University of California system, the
debate has precipitated the establish

ment of new anti-harassment policies or
the amendment of existing student con
duct codes.
Michigan's policy overturned
The question of whether these policies
violate the First Amendment was tested
directly last month when a University
of Michigan anti-harassment policy was
ruled unconstitutional in U.S. District
Court.
The first such challenge to a univer
sity harassment policy, the suit was filed
by the American Civil Liberties Union
on behalf of a Michigan graduate stu
dent.

The initial policy, which was imple
mented in the spring, would punish stu
dents for such offenses as hanging a
Confederate flag on a dormitory door
or saying women are not as skilled in
sports as men, according to Noah Finkel,
a reporter at The Michigan Daily.
Michigan attorney Elsa Cole, who
wrote the original policy, said it was
motivated by a series of incidents in the
winter of 1987 including racist fliers in
dorms and racist jokes broadcast on the
campus radio station.
Robert Sedler, the ACLU attorney
who represented the student, described
the language of the policy as "overbroad

and vague," adding, "You can't prohibit
ideas no matter how offensive they are."
There were about 45 complaints filed
under the policy, but only one went all
the way to a hearing, Cole said. She
stressed that in every case where a stu
dent was disciplined, the punishment
was agreed upon by each party involved.
However, Stanford Law Prof. Gerald
Gunther called the history of cases ex
amined under the Michigan policy a
"horror story." Gunther, who has read

The policy is "self-regulating"
and only put into effect if a stu
dent complains, Inman said.
Since both Brown and Emory
are, like Stanford, private univer
sities, they also are not legally
bound to uphold the First Amend
ment, and both policies state that
they are not intended to limit
scholarly debate or the free ex
change of ideas.
Yet Inman said Brown "sets
very high academic standards and

very high community standards,"
and since the university is a
private association of people, the
First Amendment does not neces
sarily apply. Inman added that
there has not been a community
uproar in reaction to the policy.
Issues at public schools
The issue has been a little trick
ier at the California and Wiscon
sin statewide universities. As
public systems, the schools are re
quired to abide by the Constitu
tion.
According to Patricia Hodulik,
an attorney for the Wisconsin sys
tem, an amendment to the exist
ing student conduct code was
implemented Sept. 1. The policy,
which was over a year in the
making, was preceded by a series
of racist events on campus, she
said.
Under the new code, "racist and
discriminatory comments, epi
thets or behavior directed at an
individual or small group" are
prohibited, Hodulik said. It is fur
ther necessary to prove "intent to
create an intimidating or hostile
environment" and "intent to
demean," she said.
Since the school year has just
begun, there have not been any
cases tried under the policy, she
said, but added that she knows
of a few under investigation.
The student body has been
"relatively supportive" and reac
tion "generally favorable," but
there is always a chance that,
since Wisconsin is a public system,
the policy will be challenged in

court, Hodulik said.
The Wisconsin American Civil
Liberties Union has threatened to
sue but has yet to follow up on
this threat, Hodulik said. "We'll
just have to wait and see," she
said, adding that the Michigan
policy was "quite a bit broader"
than Wisconsin's.
The new policy in the UC sys
tem also runs the risk of being
challenged in court. However, ac
cording to Rick Malaspina, a
spokesperson for the system,
while the policy may invite chal
lenges, UC attorneys "are confi
dent they're on firm legal
ground."
On Sept. 21, UC President Da
vid Gardner sent a letter to the
chancellors of all nine UC schools
amending the system's existing
Student Conduct Policy.
The new policy prohibits the
use of "personally abusive epi
thets . . . inherently likely to
provoke a violent reaction." These
epithets include "derogatory ref
erences to race, ethnicity, religion,
sex, sexual orientation, disability
and other personal characteris
tics" which might lead to a "hos
tile and intimidating
environment."
In his letter, Gardner wrote
that the UC system strives for
campuses that "foster the values
of mutual respect and tolerance
and are free from discrimination."
While the policy is not intended
to limit free speech, it recognizes
that "words can be used in such
a way that they no longer express
an idea, but rather are used to
injure and intimidate, thus un
dermining the ability for individ
uals to participate" in university
life, Gardner wrote.
It remains to be seen how uni
versities will resolve the conflict
between free speech and freedom
from harassment. However, what
ever they decide, it is sure to be
an issue that will dominate aca
demic life this year and extend to
other areas of society.
