# Roble faces hasher shortage
## 
### Amy Arends 
At first Roble Hall residents
were worried whether they would
be able to move into their dor
mitory on time — now they're
wondering whether they will be
fed on time.
With the shutdown of Roble last
year for safety renovations, Roble
Food Service Manager Lynn
Howard says she is having trouble
finding enough students to fill the
hashing jobs in the dorm's 300-
pereon dining room.
"In the past, we usually have
had several returning hashers in
September who worked the pre
vious school year. With Roble

closed for a year and a half, I
only had one returning hasher
this September," Howard said.
With 210 shifts to fill and the
average worker filling five shifts,
Howard has had to hire off
campus help to fill the gap.
Sophomore Don Conolly, a
Roble resident, says he has al
ready been affected by the lack of
employees. "Getting a meal takes
longer, and I've noticed the man
ager has been serving us," said
Conolly.
Howard, who has worked for
University Food Service for 22
years, said, "Twenty years ago, it
was a privilege to work at meals
as a hasher" At that time Roble

was an all-female dormitory and
male students worked as hashers.
"In the last five years, it has
been difficult to fill the positions
because more jobs are available
in the students' prospective
msyors. We try and keep the wage
competitive," she said.
Conolly feels that "a job with
food service is a last resort be
cause you get dirty and smelly."
However, sophomore Roble resi
dent and food service worker Nir
mal Agarwal said working at food
service is a great job. "You meet
a lot of people. It's quite a social
job. It's more fun than working
in a library."
