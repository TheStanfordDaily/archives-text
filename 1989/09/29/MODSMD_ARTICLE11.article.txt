### Doug Fine 
Although the plans are still
sketchy, Stanford Bookstore Man
ager Eldon Speed said yesterday
that the Bookstore is planning a
$2.5 million renovation and ex
pansion project.
Following approval of the proj
ect by the Board of Trustees Sept.
12, construction is tentatively
scheduled to begin in January for
the yearlong project.
The Bookstore will open an un

derground floor, according to
Speed, and all of what is now the
Bookstore will be involved in the
remodeling.
"We'll do our best to make it
as convenient as we can," Speed
said. "We'll probably have a few
'excuse our dust' signs."
The plan includes moving of all
non-book materials to the second
floor, clearing the entire first floor
for books only. This area presently
houses such items as school sup
plies and Stanford memorabilia in

addition to books.
"The project will significantly
increase the area devoted to
books," Speed said, and added that
the project's goal is to increase
that area by one-and-a-half floors.
The subterranean area will fur
ther increase space, since it is cur
rently used for receiving only.
According to Speed, the reno
vation and expansion will be
financed by the Bookstore, an in
dependent corporation which rents
the property from the University.
