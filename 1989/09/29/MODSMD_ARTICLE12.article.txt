## Marcos death causes tension President Aquino will not allow a Philippine burial 
### 
MANILA, Philippines (AP) â€”
Troops and police went on full alert
Friday and security was reinforced at
vital installations after President
Corazon Aquino banned the burial of
Ferdinand Marcos in the Philippines.
The 72-year-old Marcos, who ruled
longer than any Philippine president,
died Thursday in exile in Hawaii, and
opposition leaders urged Mrs. Aquino
to reconsider and "close a painful
chapter in our history."
Early Friday, Brig. Gen. Rodolfo
Biazon, chief of the National Capital
Region Defense Command, ordered
the alert in the Manila area. Biazon
reinforced security at all radio and
television stations, electric power
plants, telephone exchanges and other
essential installations.
Marcos supporters announced plans
for a Roman Catholic Mass and rally
Friday, but there was no sign of trou
ble early Friday. Marcos loyalists have
been blamed for some of the six armed
attempts to topple Mrs. Aquino since
she took power Feb. 25, 1986, after
a popular uprising ended Marcos' 20-
year rule.
Manila radio stations interrupted
their programming to announce his
death, and the former president's fel
low northerners wept at the news.
Manila newspapers bannered news of
Marcos' death in Friday's editions.
"The national mood hinges on the
question of forgiveness from both
sides," said the Philippine Daily In
quirer in a front-page editorial. "Noth
ing less than the fate of the nation
hinges on the story's resolution."

In a statement Thursday, Mrs.
Aquino expressed her condolences to
Marcos' family but ruled out any
burial in the Philippines.
"In the interest of the safety of
those who will take the death of Mr.
Marcos in widely and passionately
conflicting ways, and for the tran
quility of the state and the order of
society, the remains of Ferdinand E.
Marcos will not be allowed to be
brought to our country until such time
as the government, be it under this
administration or the succeeding one,
shall otherwise decide."
In Washington, State Department
spokesman Richard Boucher said the
Federal Aviation Administration

would seek to prevent any flight from
carrying Marcos' body from the
United States to the Philippines.
One Marcos supporter, Oliver
Lozano, said loyalists would stage a
symbolic funeral march to protest
Mrs. Aquino's decision, but he did not
say when.
Marcos' only son, Ferdinand Marcos
Jr., told Manila television station
GMA that the family would try to
persuade Mrs. Aquino to change her
mind. Nicanor Yniguez, former
speaker of the National Assembly,
called Mrs. Aquino's refusal "the
height of sacrilege."
Marcos' death was announced after
the close of the business day in the
Philippines, and there was little public
reaction to the passing of the man
who ruled 21 years, longer than any
other Filipino leader.
"I'm not surprised," said Jazmine
So, 42, a Manila merchant. "It was
expected. I don't know what will hap
pen, but the situation will not affect
me."
In Marcos' home province of Ilocos
Norte, many wept at the news of his
death.
"It is painful, but what can I do,"
said Ernie Suarez, a former soldier in
Batac, 230 miles north of Manila. "We
wanted him back alive and we still
want him to return now that he's
dead."
"Our family cried when we heard
about the news," said Gigi Nalupta,
29, in a telephone interview from
Batac. "We are sick at heart because
we loved him very, very much."
