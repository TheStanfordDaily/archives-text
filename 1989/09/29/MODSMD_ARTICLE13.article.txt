# EPA adds 93 toxic sites to Superfund cleanup list

### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - The Environ
mental Protection Agency on Thursday
added 93 toxic waste sites, including five
at two nuclear weapons plants, to its pri
ority list for cleanup under the federal
Superfund law.
The additional sites and the removal of
31 others from the list brings to 1,194 the
number of waste sites where chemicals or
other material have been judged so much
of a threat that they are eligible for federal
funds for cleanup.
The federal Superfund law since 1980
has allocated more than $8 billion, raised
through taxes on chemicals and crude oil,
for removal of toxic materials from the top
priority sites, but so far cleanup has been
concluded at only a handful of sites.
The additional target locations for
cleanup announced Thursday were spread
over 32 states and Puerto Rico. Seventeen
of the additional sites were in Pennsylva
nia, nine in California and seven in Wash
ington state.
Among the new sites were 11 federal
facilities including the Rocky Flats
plutonium processing plant in Colorado and
four in the government's nuclear complex
near Hanford, Wash.
These facilities joined 52 other military
installations, nuclear fuel processing plants
and other plants already on the EPA pri
ority cleanup list.
As the EPA added to the number of sites
eligible for federal Superfund cleanup
funds, it also announced that 27 sites pre
viously on the priority list had been shifted
to a different cleanup program. Although
cleanup activities would continue on those
sites, the federal money would come from
another program.
These 27 sites are active hazardous waste
treatment, storage or disposed installations

that will be handled under the federal waste
disposal law.
Four sites were deleted altogether from
the cleanup list. The agency said it had
downgraded the threats posed by the four.
The priority list of 1,194 cleanup sites
represents the worst of an estimated 30,000
hazardous waste dumps in need of treat
ment or cleanup in the country.
The EPA has been under sharp criticism
from Congress and elsewhere for its failure
to make more progress. Earlier this month,
a study by the Rand Corp. concluded that
the Superfund program has been "super
slow."
During the program's first eight years
cleanup was finished at only 34 of the
1,175 sites on the priority list at the time,
the Rand Corp. analysis said. The report
also criticized the agency for not spending
more of the money provided by Congress
for cleanup and for not recovering more
of the costs from polluters.
EPA officials have acknowledged prob
lems in the Superfund program and re
cently announced plans to pursue polluters
more vigorously to get them to pay more
for cleanups.
