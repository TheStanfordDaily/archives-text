viet Foreign Minister Eduard A.
Shevardnadze on Thursday pro
posed to act as an intermediary
between Israel and the PLO and
offered to hold a meeting between
them on Soviet soil.
Shevardnadze made the com
ment to reporters after meeting
with Israeli Foreign Minister
Moshe Arens. Both men praised
the improvement in Soviet-Israeli
relations but said there were no
immediate plans to resume full
diplomatic ties, severed by the
Soviets 22 years ago during the
1967 Middle East war.
The ministers discussed the
stalemated Mideast peace process,
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir's election plan for the oc
cupied territories and a wide
range of bilateral issues, including
consular relations and direct air
links between Moscow and Tel
Aviv.
Arens, speaking first to
reporters after the meeting, said
he urged the Soviet Union to en
dorse the Israeli peace initiative.
"The Soviet Union does not reject
that initiative," he said, "and it
sees some positive aspects in the
initiative. I hope we will eventu

Shevardnadze said, "I urged
Foreign Minister Arens to engage
in dialogue and direct contact with
the PLO." He added that in the
Soviet view, no Middle East settle
ment could succeed without the
participation of the Palestine Lib
eration Organization.
"I even proposed my good of
fices to organize such a meeting
(between Israel and the PLO) on
the territory of the Soviet Union,"
he said. "That could be a very
good meeting and a sensation for
reporters," he said.
Arens had departed and there
was no immediate comment from
the Israeli side on the Soviet offer.

However, Israel refuses to nego
tiate with the PLO, which it views
as a terrorist group.
Shevardnadze said the Soviet
Union still hoped for an interna
tional conference on the Middle
East and said the five permanent
members of the U.S. Security
Council — the Soviet Union,
United States, China, Britain and
France — should be involved in
a settlement.
Israel rejects any conference
that would impose a settlement
on it and calls instead for bilateral
talks with its neighbors.
Later Thursday, Arens, of the
right-wing Likud bloc, was to
meet with Secretary of State
James A. Baker 111 and Egyptian
Foreign Minister Esmat Abdul
Meguid.
Israeli Finance Minister
Shimon Peres, head of the center
left Labor Party, was to meet with
Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak. Arens was to meet
Mubarak on Friday.
Mubarak's plan attaches condi
tions to Shamir's election plan
and contains several points that
are opposed by Likud. One of
those is the principle of trading
land for peace. The Labor Party
has endorsed Mubarak's plan.
