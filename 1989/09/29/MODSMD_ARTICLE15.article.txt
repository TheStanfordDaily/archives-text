Junk mail saved
WASHINGTON (AP) - The
House, reversing a decision
made 72 hours earlier, voted
Thursday to save the free mass
mailings that members of Con
gress send to constituents.
However, the 274-137 vote
that adopted a House-Senate
compromise on a money bill
would cut the mailings in half
— from six to three annually
It was the first reduction in
the program, but the vote saved
the mailings from earlier votes
that called for their virtual ex
tinction.
The House voted 245-137
Tuesday to instruct its members
of a House-Senate conference
committee to back Senate lan
guage virtually ending the free
mass mailings and give the es
timated $45 million saving to
the war on drugs.
The conferees, two hours lat
er, ignored both the House in
struction and an 83-8 Senate
vote Sept. 7 against use of the
newsletters.
Rep. Vic Fazio, D-Calif., au
thor of the compromise, said
conferees knew members
wanted to save the newsletters

and privately thanked him for
doing so. He said the grateful
House members included 14 Re
publicans who had voted to stop
the mailings.
The Senate hasn't considered
the compromise. House mem
bers charge senators began the
anti-mail drive while privately
backing the current system.
Several House members
warned that if the Senate
doesn't accept the compromise,
they would introduce legislation
to stop senators from using cam
paign contributions for office ex
penses. The House is prohibited
by its rules from such use of
campaign funds.

— Zsa Zsa Gabor, dressed in
red and arrayed in jewels,
threatened Thursday to call
police on a mob of reporters who
surrounded her Rolls-Royce as
she awaited a jury verdict in
her police-slapping case.
Saying "No comment, no com
ment, no comment," the weary
looking actress pushed through
a crush of photographers,

camera crews and reporters
shagging her as she walked to
her car during a lunch break.
"Don't scratch the car," she
snapped at the media mob,
pointing to some nearby Beverly
Ilills police officers. "There's
the police."
A six-woman, six-man jury
deliberated 90 minutes on Wed
nesday and all day Thursday
without reaching a verdict. They
were ordered to return at 9 a.m.
Friday.
Miss Gabor, following her
June run-in with Officer Paul
Kramer, could receive up to 18
months in jail if convicted of
misdemeanor battery on a police
officer, disobeying an officer's
orders, driving with an expired
license, and having an open con
tainer of alcohol in her car.
She was fined $500 earlier for
violating what she called a "gag
ging order" by commenting to
reporters on witnesses in the
case.
"I came here to show you guys
I'm not afraid," she told
reporters. "I'm wearing my big
diamonds today. I worked for it.
I earned it."
"I'm feeling confident and
happy," she said.
