## Prices need fixing 
### 
Justice Dept. probe is
the result of a larger
tuition problem

IT IS UPLIFTING to hear Uni
versity officials say that they
deplore the information
sharing practices of the Overlap
Group, a collection of 23 colleges
under investigation by the Justice
Department for colluding on tui
tion rates, faculty and administra
tor salaries and financial aid
packages.
Vice President and General
Counsel John Schwartz said the
University has consistently refused
to be a member or take part in
the group's regular meetings. A
University policy dating back to
the early 1980s forbids the sharing
of information with other schools
before prices are set.
It is up to the Justice Depart
ment to decide whether the meet
ings violate the anti-trust laws, but
the practice should be abandoned
for the sake of higher education.
Member universities claim that
sharing the information enables
them to set comparable rates so
students can choose schools based
on merit rather than cost.
In an ideal world where financial
aid packages actually cover the dif
ference between cost and ability to
pay, that argument would fly. But
the plain fact is that many students
are forced to make decisions based
primarily on the cost of the colleges
they are considering.
Tuition is a key factor in any
high school senior's decision
making process. It's a factor that

forces several students to attend
state universities or local commu
nity colleges, simply because they
cannot afford the cost of a highly
rated private university they would
prefer to attend.
For some, the high cost means
joining an armed forces college pro
gram to make education afforda
ble, a move which can cost some
students two to four years of their
lives.
As tuitions continue to rise un
abated, it's time for the Overlap
Group and other private univer
sities to tighten their belts and
start competing in the "open mar
ket." If they are forced to go head
to-head to attract students,
budgets may get serious attention
by administrators seeking control
over costs.
True, students are paying the
high rates voluntarily and many
do receive aid. But the situation
doesn't look as if it going to change
in the near future because certain
"elite" universities have control of
the college market. As tuition rates
rise, the question of whether or
not students are getting what they
pay for will be sounded louder and
with more force.
The problem of high tuition
rates at Stanford and other private
universities must be addressed
soon, especially now that the total
annual cost of many universities
has reached the $20,000 mark.
If, when Stanford complies with
the Justice Department probe and
opens its files, the University is
found "not guilty," the fact that
Stanford's tuition has risen right
along with tuition at Overlap
Group universities leaves open the
question of the University's "in
nocence."
