## Whose death penalty is it, anyway? 
### 
HAVING BEEN AWAY from New
York City for a few weeks, I called
back to see how things were going
at home.
"It's horrible," my wife told me. "The
city is getting so violent. Last week a
Puerto Rican woman was shot in the
head because she tried to fight drug
dealers on her block. This week the Mafia
executed a garbageman because he tried
to run a route in their territory. It seems
as if the violent people have taken over
society. If you don't do what they want,
they just kill you."
Sitting here in California, I feel much
the same way. All this, I think, should
serve notice to those generally wise judi
cious individuals who run our government
that — this time at least — the public
may be right about the death penalty.
In one recent poll by The New York
Daily News, 95 percent of the respondents
wanted capital punishment. It would be
hard to get that many people to agree
whether or not the earth really rotates
around the sun.
Yet all the while, the people who ac
tually have the responsibility for enforc
ing the public will still hesitate. Like
Pontius Pilate, they don't want blood on
their hands.
In light of this, let me try rephrasing
the issue for a moment. The question
may no longer be whether or not we
have a death penalty. We already have
one being meted out on the street every
day.
The real question is, who is going to
enforce it? Is it going to be the two-bit
thug or mafioso, or the street corner
drug dealer who decides that the fate of
the "mushrooms" in his path are less

important than his desire to settle things
with the drug dealer on the next block?
Or will the state, in all its imperfect
majesty, finally take upon itself the
awesome power of taking life in order to
rectify its ultimate jurisdiction over so
ciety?
This is neither as abstract nor as in
significant as it may sound. After all,
while most of us will pledge our allegiance
to the flag and pay our taxes, however
reluctantly, we still retain much of our
private worlds and personal loyalties.
Some people don't hold much regard for
the will of the majority — as is their
right — and there are some neighbor
hoods where the power of what we call
"the government" hardly matters at all.
In particular, many poor neighbor
hoods have literally become little duchies
ruled almost entirely by vice lords and
drug dealers. What makes the power of
these people so immediate and convincing
is that they are willing to take life in
order to enforce their will. Next to this,
the powers of the government seem
rather uncertain and insignificant.
Sure, the state may come in once in
awhile and carry someone off to jail,
maybe even lock them up for a "life sen
tence." But everybody knows that sooner
or later the jails will become too crowded
or some clever lawyer will get the
criminals out on a technicality. Then
there they will be, back again, and woe
to anyone who has questioned their au
thority in the meantime.
In 17th century France, dueling was
commonplace among university students
and murders were frequent. When Car
dinal Richelieu came to power under
Louis XIII, he made dueling punishable

by death. Everyone laughed at the idea.
In sheer defiance, one handsome and
popular 19-year-old student immediately
went out and fought a duel, seriously
wounding his opponent. He was arrested,
tried and sentenced to be hanged.
The university population was
stunned. It had only been a joke. The
student had a marvelous life ahead of
him. The lesson had been learned. How
could Richelieu go ahead and sacrifice
such a glorious future for an abstract
principle?
But the sentence was carried out.
Dueling ended. France became more
"civilized."
The two common justifications for the
death penalty are that: 1) it permanently
incapacitates a specific criminal, and 2)
it serves as a general deterrent against
others committing similar crimes.
To these, I think, "a third' sHouM be
added. By assuming the awesome respon
sibility of taking life, the state asserts
that its purposes are more important
than anyone else's. In an autocracy, that
might seem frightening, but in a democ
racy, where the people ultimately do rule,
it is something we all can and do accept.
So to the Gov. Mario Cuomos and Su
preme Court Justice William Brennans
of the world, who still hesitate over this
issue, think of it in this way: if you don't
enforce the death penalty, someone else
will. And that person will neither have
your public mandate, nor will he be car
rying it out against guilty people.

popular 19-year-old student immediately
went out and fought a duel, seriously
wounding his opponent. He was arrested,
tried and sentenced to be hanged.
The university population was
stunned. It had only been a joke. The
student had a marvelous life ahead of
him. The lesson had been learned. How
could Richelieu go ahead and sacrifice
such a glorious future for an abstract
principle?
But the sentence was carried out.
Dueling ended. France became more
"civilized."
The two common justifications for the
death penalty are that: 1) it permanently
incapacitates a specific criminal, and 2)
it serves as a general deterrent against
others committing similar crimes.
To these, I think, "a third' sHouM be
added. By assuming the awesome respon
sibility of taking life, the state asserts
that its purposes are more important
than anyone else's. In an autocracy, that
might seem frightening, but in a democ
racy, where the people ultimately do rule,
it is something we all can and do accept.
So to the Gov. Mario Cuomos and Su
preme Court Justice William Brennans
of the world, who still hesitate over this
issue, think of it in this way: if you don't
enforce the death penalty, someone else
will. And that person will neither have
your public mandate, nor will he be car
rying it out against guilty people.

HAVING BEEN AWAY from New
York City for a few weeks, I called
back to see how things were going
at home.
"It's horrible," my wife told me. "The
city is getting so violent. Last week a
Puerto Rican woman was shot in the
head because she tried to fight drug
dealers on her block. This week the Mafia
executed a garbageman because he tried
to run a route in their territory. It seems
as if the violent people have taken over
society. If you don't do what they want,
they just kill you."
Sitting here in California, I feel much
the same way. All this, I think, should
serve notice to those generally wise judi
cious individuals who run our government
that — this time at least — the public
may be right about the death penalty.
In one recent poll by The New York
Daily News, 95 percent of the respondents
wanted capital punishment. It would be
hard to get that many people to agree
whether or not the earth really rotates
around the sun.
Yet all the while, the people who ac
tually have the responsibility for enforc
ing the public will still hesitate. Like
Pontius Pilate, they don't want blood on
their hands.
In light of this, let me try rephrasing
the issue for a moment. The question
may no longer be whether or not we
have a death penalty. We already have
one being meted out on the street every
day.
The real question is, who is going to
enforce it? Is it going to be the two-bit
thug or mafioso, or the street corner
drug dealer who decides that the fate of
the "mushrooms" in his path are less

important than his desire to settle things
with the drug dealer on the next block?
Or will the state, in all its imperfect
majesty, finally take upon itself the
awesome power of taking life in order to
rectify its ultimate jurisdiction over so
ciety?
This is neither as abstract nor as in
significant as it may sound. After all,
while most of us will pledge our allegiance
to the flag and pay our taxes, however
reluctantly, we still retain much of our
private worlds and personal loyalties.
Some people don't hold much regard for
the will of the majority — as is their
right — and there are some neighbor
hoods where the power of what we call
"the government" hardly matters at all.
In particular, many poor neighbor
hoods have literally become little duchies
ruled almost entirely by vice lords and
drug dealers. What makes the power of
these people so immediate and convincing
is that they are willing to take life in
order to enforce their will. Next to this,
the powers of the government seem
rather uncertain and insignificant.
Sure, the state may come in once in
awhile and carry someone off to jail,
maybe even lock them up for a "life sen
tence." But everybody knows that sooner
or later the jails will become too crowded
or some clever lawyer will get the
criminals out on a technicality. Then
there they will be, back again, and woe
to anyone who has questioned their au
thority in the meantime.
In 17th century France, dueling was
commonplace among university students
and murders were frequent. When Car
dinal Richelieu came to power under
Louis XIII, he made dueling punishable

by death. Everyone laughed at the idea.

popular 19-year-old student immediately
