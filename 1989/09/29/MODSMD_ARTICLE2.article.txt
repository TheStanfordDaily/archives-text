# Stanford team presents new cancer remedy

A team of Stanford scientists announced yesterday
a potential lymphatic cancer treatment which may
have widespread implications for other cancers.
The treatment involves using antibodies, the
body's natural proteins that can help destroy cancer
cells. The new research suggests that a class of
antibodies, custom-made by researchers for one pa
tient, can be used for certain other patients with
lymphatic cancer.
The study of lymphatic cancer, which is fatal in
about 50 percent of the cases, was published yes
terday in The New England Journal of Medicine.
"In the past, we've made antibodies limited for
each patient," said Ronald Levy, a professor of med
icine who headed the study.
Now, however, researchers found that some 20
antibodies can be used in treatment of one-third of
all B cell lymphomas, or lymphatic cancers. Four
percent of patients respond to the most common
monoclonal antibody used.
Previously, doctors could treat only a very small
number of lymphomas, and, typically, patients would
have to wait a year before the monoclonal antibodies
were ready for treatment. With the new discovery,
however, screening for the correct antibody type
takes only a couple hours and treatment can begin
immediately.
Because they used only human tissues in their
experiments, researchers must still determine
whether their method will be valid in humans. Levy's
group has just begun testing the antibodies on
humans to determine whether the antibodies will
be as effective as the research suggests.
Using monoclonal antibodies for treatment of can
cers is relatively new, and Levy has pioneered the
use of the specialized antibodies for lymphomas.
Levy showed in February that this form of treatment
was useful in shrinking previously untreatable lym
phatic cancers.
Monoclonal antibodies can be injected into patients
where they "label" cancer cells for destruction by
the body's natural defenses.
