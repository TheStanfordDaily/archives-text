## University stalling on issue of comparable worth 
### 
I AM WRITING in regard to the
University's attitude toward women
and its relationship to United
Stanford Workers.
On Sept. 27 and 28, arbitration
hearings were set for the reclassifica
tion grievance of the life science tech
nicians at the Stanford Medical Center.
Yesterday the University canceled out.
This means a grievance filed six
years ago will remain unheard and
unsettled for at least six more months.
The University has stalled and stalled
on this issue. There are many disturb
ing aspects to this event.
1. The University's reasons for can
celing. They claim they have negotia
tions with the Police Officers Associa
tion those two days. We contacted
them and we told the Wednesday date
was "iffy" and nothing was set for
Thursday.
2. The canceling of this arbitration

is something we have seen all too
often. Despite rhetoric to the contrary,
this action only reinforces the reality
of Stanford not wanting to solve prob
lems. This case has seen other legal
obstacles, all meant as a delay tactic.
3. This case deals with a group of
workers, 81 percent of whom are wom
en. Their physical science counterparts
are 93 percent men. Despite similar
skills levels and work requirements,
the life science technicians group is 7
to 21 percent less than the male group.
We view this as a case of comparable
worth. Obviously, the University wants
to avoid this issue. It is a slap in the
face not just to these workers but to
the community as a whole.
4. This is not the first instance of
the University denigrating an issue of
keen interest to women. During the
contract negotiations last fall, the USW
made a proposal to look at the prob-

This is not the first in
stance of the Univer
sity denigrating an

to women.

lems involved with child care. All we
asked for was a committee to meet
three or four times a year to discuss
the issue. This was not even enter
tained by the University, despite tes
timony from a worker who was forced
to on occasion leave her child in her
car.
It makes me sick just thinking about
it.

These policies do nothing but hurt
the University. Whether it's Donald
Kennedy or the Legal Office that really
sets these policies can be left up to the
reader. No matter where these policies
come from, however, they do nothing
but hurt morale and put the Univer
sity in a bad light.
As far as the USW is concerned,
we've brought up problems of discrimi
nation against ethnic groups as well as
comparable worth problems in the
past. Once again we bring up compara
ble worth problems.
I just want the community to know
that we shall continue to fight the
abuses practiced by the University. We
hope you will all do the same. If their
is a silver lining, it can only be the
University is running out of groups to
abuse and discriminate against.
