# Alum group checking club's compliance
## 
### 
I must write to express my dismay
at Judy Weisner's letter about the
Stanford Bachelors Club that was
printed in the Sept. 26 Daily. Your
"Letters Policy," which appeared two
inches below the letter in question,
states letters "must include name,
phone number and Stanford affiliation,
if any."
Weisner's letter has been circulated
widely among University officers and
trustees, as well as in the Stanford
Alumni Association office where it was
directed. All of these letters arrived in
blank envelopes with no return address
or phone number, and they are un
traceable.
No such person exists in alumni

records, we haven't found her in the
Bay Area telephone directories and she
is not on the Bachelors Club mailing
list.
As her letter stated, the Stanford
Bachelors Club is a chartered club of
the Stanford Alumni Association and is
therefore subject to certain guidelines.
Those include, in no uncertain terms, a
provision that all alumni are welcome
at all events, regardless of their sex,
race, religion or creed.
For the last few months, Alumni
Director Bill Stone and I have been
working closely with the club's leader
ship to ensure they are in complete
compliance with these and other provi
sions. Club officers have acknowledged
there are serious issues to be ad
dressed and are seeking to satisfy us
that mutually agreeable solutions are
possible.
