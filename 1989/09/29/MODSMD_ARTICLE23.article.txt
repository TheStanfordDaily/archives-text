## Banning racist speech on campus would aggravate racism 
### 
A PERENNIALLY important
question is: should we defend
racist and other hate speech?
The most recent incarnation of this
recurring issue is provoked by the
current rise of racist speech on
campus. As civil libertarians who are
deeply committed to eradicating racism,
we find this extremely disturbing.
But that does not necessarily mean
that we should regulate racist speech. I
do believe — deeply and firmly — that
both the U.S. courts and the ACLU
are correct in rejecting laws which
would prohibit hate speech.
I know that words can and do hurt
— brutally so. Thus, the justification
for not outlawing them is not at all
based on unawareness of this fact.
First, let me establish that civil
libertarians agree that some speech can
be viewed as a verbal assault which
may be subject to government regula
tion. And that speech that constitutes
fighting words is only a narrow por-

tion of the overall category of racist
speech.
However, my point is that even
prohibiting all racist speech would not
end racism. Worse yet, suppressing
racist speech could actually aggravate
racism.
The question whether any particular
racist speech constitutes a regulable
verbal assault is heavily fact-bound. We
can't a priori define certain words as
inherently off-limits, but rather have to
examine them in the overall context in
which they are uttered.
This is consistent with the Supreme
Court's definition of the "fighting
words" exception to protected free
speech. The Court has applied the
exception only towards words whose
utterance, under the particular circum
stances, tend to incite an immediate
breach of peace.
This points to the problem with the
Stanford rule: while it purports to use
the "fighting words" standard, it in

fact goes well beyond that concept. But
if the Stanford rule were rewritten to
incorporate the Supreme Court's cur
rent fighting words doctrine, I don't
think civil libertarians would oppose it.
We don't treat racist fighting words
differently from other fighting words.
Now, there are some intermediate
situations where reasonable civil liber
tarians will differ as to whether the
fighting words exception was satisfied
under the particular facts and circum
stances.
Most civil libertarians would not
advocate a rule broader than the Stan
ford rule if it would go beyond insults
directly targeted at one individual or
small group.
Of course, the ACLU vigorously
supports civil rights legislation outlaw
ing private discriminatory acts, but
that's a far cry from outlawing private
speech.
Meanwhile, what remains is the
larger problem of racism — of which

all these words are just a symptom. I
think it would be far more construc
tive for us to devote our energies to
devising strategies for combating rac
ism itself than to dotting the i's and
crossing the t's about the particular
narrow subset of racist slurs that
might be regulable consistent with the
first ammendment.
We've made it the highest organiza
tional priority to combat racism. But
we must never forget that racist speech
is only a symptom of racism problem.
And that problem will not be solved by
banning its symptom.
There is no psychological or empiri
cal evidence that punishing name
callings would change deeply held
attitudes. Banning racist speech might
well aggravate the problem, for two
reasons.
First, it's impossible to draw narrow
regulations precisely specifying the
particular words and contexts which
should lead to such sanctions.

Consequently, authorities inevitably
have great discretion in determining
precisely which words and which
speakers will be punished — striking
at the very heart of free speech values.
One ironic result is that likely tar
gets of punishment are members of
minority groups themselves.
Second, attempts to suppress racist
speech often have the effect of glorify
ing the racist speakers. Psychological
studies reveal that whenever there is
an attempt to censor speech, racist
speakers may appear as martyrs or
heroes.
The positive effect of racist speech is
that the public consciousness has been
raised.
Focusing on racist speech diverts us
from less convenient, more expensive,
but ultimately more meaningful ap
proaches to the underlying problem.
