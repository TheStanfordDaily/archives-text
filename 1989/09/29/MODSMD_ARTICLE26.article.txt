trying not to cry.
"I was trying to explain to her
that I couldn't go into the bath
room because there was a ghost
in there. You think this would be
one of those typical cute little kids
stories, but she told me, 'I said
you must have seen a ghost be
cause I haven't taught you the
word "ghost" before.'"
In the process of creating "The
Joy Luck Club," Tan found her
self both drawing upon and claim
ing her personal history.
"There is a story about a
woman who is a widow and is
thrown out from her family," she
said, "because she, after being
raped, becomes the third con
cubine to a rich man. That is a
story that is also true, that hap
pened to my grandmother. My
mother was the little girl watching
her when her mother committed
suicide from an overdose of
opium.
"These sound so very exotic and
removed, and I think I was
removed from them tor such a
long time."
However, Tan said the stories
are still very much a part of her.
"These stories . . . are things that
run through the blood of my
grandmother and my mother and
they are in me if I can look for
them," she said.
By exploring her experiences
through writing, Tan came to
grips with her own identity as an
Asian-American woman, an iden
tity which she has found affirm
ing.
"What was wonderful about
writing the book was a realization:

Amy Tan, an Asian-American
writer, made a brilliant entrance
onto the American literary scene
with her first novel, "The Joy
Luck Club," a New York Times
best seller. Tan's success is an
example of a growing development
in American literature. Increas
ingly, the most promising, inno
vative works being published and
read reflect the diversity of Amer
ican people, drawing upon an au
thor's specific experiences and
history.
In this spirit, "The Joy Luck
Club," published earlier this year,
explores the relationships among
four Chinese-American women
and their daughters. The novel
received much critical acclaim, es
tablishing Amy Tan as an exciting
new presence on the literary
scene.
Speaking in front of a packed
audience in the Branner Hall
lounge Monday, Tan traced her
vocation as a writer to her family
experiences and history.
"I truly feel as a writer what
motivates you, what starts those
instincts as a writer are things
that happen in childhood," she
said. As a child, her mother had
fostered an active imagination,
she said.
"She would say things to me
and never really curtailed my
imagination. If anything, she fed
it. She was telling me this story
the other day about how, when I
was 3 years old, I had woken up
from a nap and there were strange
people in the house and I was

By exploring her experiences through writing,

Asian-American woman, making it something
affirming.

I didn't have to choose anymore.
I didn't have to say that if I
wanted Chinese character, I
couldn't have American character;
I could have both. That was such
a wonderful discovery to me in
writing this book, because I've had
feelings about my cultural identity
that have changed over time."
At age six, Tan said, she
believed she was an American girl
trapped in a Chinese body. Later,
she felt that when she said she
was Chinese that "I was lying
somehow because I couldn't speak
Chinese and there were lots of
things I didn't know, and then a
real desire to learn much more
about my family."
In particular, the self-discovery
Tan went through informed her
relationship with her own mother.
"When I was growing up, one of
the things that I promised myself
was that I would not be like my
mother. ... It wasn't until later
that I saw that so many of my
strengths had come from her, and
it was really that sense of surviv
ing many things in life. She's the
first one who would say, this story
is all fiction, and I haven't begun
to tell the true story of her life."
Tan has been writing fiction
full-time since mid-1987, but she
originally worked as a business

writer. In a Daily interview before
her Branner appearance, Tan de
scribed the transition:
"I had three stories .. . and an
agent saw one of the stories in a
magazine and contacted me and
was really very persistent. She
said she wanted to be my agent.
I told her that I wasn't a fiction
writer, I was a business writer,
but she said she believed in me,
she thought I could write fiction
and she found a publisher. She
had me write a proposal."
With a publisher arranged even
before she wrote most of the book,
both the pressures and the hopes
were high. "I think that panic,
that sense of panic, it works well
for that first book, it's your
chance, this is your chance to
break into it, and do it," she ex
plained.
"I have to get this done real
fast and move on to the next book,
get advances, and never have to
go back to business writing .. .
That would have been, that had
become my personal hell."
Looking back, the series of
events leading up to the publica
tion of her first novel still
surprises her, and surprises fellow
writers even more. "Mine is a very

told since then. I was so removed
from everything, I didn't realize
how unusual it was until after it
happened, and then everyone
reminded me, This does not hap
pen, this simply does not happen,
so don't take it for granted.'"
With only one in 450 submitted
manuscripts ever reaching publi
cation, and 48,000 books pub
lished last year, very few fiction
writers can sustain themselves
through their writing. Near the
end of her presentation in Branner
Monday, Tan responded to a stu
dent's query on breaking into the
professional writing field.
"How can you be a full-time
writer, how can you make enough
money to be a full-time writer, or
how do you first get into it? . ..
I can only say that what I did
was really to write because I
wanted to write and I used the
resources that I had. It wasn't

it was the idea that I wanted to
find a voice, and it was something
that I could work on for the rest
of my life and that in itself would
be worth it.

"When I was growing up, one of
the things that I promised myself
was that I would not be like my
mother. ... It wasn't until later
that I saw that so many of my
strengths had come from her, and
it was really that sense of surviv
ing many things in life. She's the
first one who would say, this story
is all fiction, and I haven't begun
to tell the true story of her life."
Tan has been writing fiction
full-time since mid-1987, but she
originally worked as a business

writer. In a Daily interview before
her Branner appearance, Tan de
scribed the transition:
"I had three stories .. . and an
agent saw one of the stories in a
magazine and contacted me and
was really very persistent. She
said she wanted to be my agent.
I told her that I wasn't a fiction
writer, I was a business writer,
but she said she believed in me,
she thought I could write fiction
and she found a publisher. She
had me write a proposal."
With a publisher arranged even
before she wrote most of the book,
both the pressures and the hopes
were high. "I think that panic,
that sense of panic, it works well
for that first book, it's your
chance, this is your chance to
break into it, and do it," she ex
plained.
"I have to get this done real
fast and move on to the next book,
get advances, and never have to
go back to business writing .. .
That would have been, that had
become my personal hell."
Looking back, the series of
events leading up to the publica
tion of her first novel still
surprises her, and surprises fellow
writers even more. "Mine is a very

different kind of story, I've been
told since then. I was so removed
from everything, I didn't realize
how unusual it was until after it
happened, and then everyone
reminded me, This does not hap
pen, this simply does not happen,
so don't take it for granted.'"
With only one in 450 submitted
manuscripts ever reaching publi
cation, and 48,000 books pub
lished last year, very few fiction
writers can sustain themselves
through their writing. Near the
end of her presentation in Branner
Monday, Tan responded to a stu
dent's query on breaking into the
professional writing field.
"How can you be a full-time
writer, how can you make enough
money to be a full-time writer, or
how do you first get into it? . ..
I can only say that what I did
was really to write because I
wanted to write and I used the
resources that I had. It wasn't
with the idea of getting published,
it was the idea that I wanted to
find a voice, and it was something
that I could work on for the rest
of my life and that in itself would
be worth it.
"I also wanted to write stories
for my mother and have it so she
could read them and just enjoy
them as stories."
trying not to cry.
"I was trying to explain to her
that I couldn't go into the bath
room because there was a ghost
in there. You think this would be
one of those typical cute little kids
stories, but she told me, 'I said
you must have seen a ghost be
cause I haven't taught you the
word "ghost" before.'"
In the process of creating "The
Joy Luck Club," Tan found her
self both drawing upon and claim
ing her personal history.
"There is a story about a
woman who is a widow and is
thrown out from her family," she
said, "because she, after being
raped, becomes the third con
cubine to a rich man. That is a
story that is also true, that hap
pened to my grandmother. My
mother was the little girl watching
her when her mother committed
suicide from an overdose of
opium.
"These sound so very exotic and
removed, and I think I was
removed from them tor such a
long time."
However, Tan said the stories
are still very much a part of her.
"These stories . . . are things that
run through the blood of my
grandmother and my mother and
they are in me if I can look for
them," she said.
By exploring her experiences
through writing, Tan came to
grips with her own identity as an
Asian-American woman, an iden
tity which she has found affirm
ing.
"What was wonderful about
writing the book was a realization:

Amy Tan, an Asian-American
writer, made a brilliant entrance
onto the American literary scene
with her first novel, "The Joy
Luck Club," a New York Times
best seller. Tan's success is an
example of a growing development
in American literature. Increas
ingly, the most promising, inno
vative works being published and
read reflect the diversity of Amer
ican people, drawing upon an au
thor's specific experiences and
history.
In this spirit, "The Joy Luck
Club," published earlier this year,
explores the relationships among
four Chinese-American women
and their daughters. The novel
received much critical acclaim, es
tablishing Amy Tan as an exciting
new presence on the literary
scene.
Speaking in front of a packed
audience in the Branner Hall
lounge Monday, Tan traced her
vocation as a writer to her family
experiences and history.
"I truly feel as a writer what
motivates you, what starts those
instincts as a writer are things
that happen in childhood," she
said. As a child, her mother had
fostered an active imagination,
she said.
"She would say things to me
and never really curtailed my
imagination. If anything, she fed
it. She was telling me this story
the other day about how, when I
was 3 years old, I had woken up
from a nap and there were strange
people in the house and I was

I didn't have to choose anymore.
I didn't have to say that if I
wanted Chinese character, I
couldn't have American character;
I could have both. That was such
a wonderful discovery to me in
writing this book, because I've had
feelings about my cultural identity
that have changed over time."
At age six, Tan said, she
believed she was an American girl
trapped in a Chinese body. Later,
she felt that when she said she
was Chinese that "I was lying
somehow because I couldn't speak
Chinese and there were lots of
things I didn't know, and then a
real desire to learn much more
about my family."
In particular, the self-discovery

relationship with her own mother.
