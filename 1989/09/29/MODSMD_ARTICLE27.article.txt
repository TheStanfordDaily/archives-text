# Thought-provoking mural seeks a new home

Notice anything new around
Tresidder lately?
Thinking of decorating your
dorm with original art this year?
Stanford Workshops on Political
and Social Issues class number
149 has the answer to your ques
tions, and it's hanging on an out
side wall at Tresidder behind the
Coffee House. There you will find
the colorful mural from a
SWOPSI class entitled, "What is
to be Undone? Anarchist Theory
and Practice."
The mural has been at Tresid
der all summer, but is only tem
porarily occupying the space, ac
cording to class member Jeanne
Lorenz. If no one expresses an
interest in taking it home soon,
it will probably "end up in storage
somewhere," she said.
SWOPSI staff member Made
line Larson said the spring quar
ter class was basically "an intro
duction to the political theory and
history of anarchy." The class also
explored the modern anarchist
movement, according to Larson,
who added that the movement is
fairly strong in the San Francisco
area.
Lorenz said the mural, which
covers an area of 72 square feet,

was hung one night at the end of
last spring quarter as an "action
project." The whole idea of the
project, she said, "was to get out
and do something which bypassed
hierarchy, as an example of how
anarchy can be a good thing."
As a result, the class purposely
did not contact Tresidder for per
mission to hang the mural. Lorenz
said they were later told that if
they had gone through the proper
channels, "It would have taken
months to get the painting in
place."
Unfortunately, further renova
tions scheduled for Tresidder in
clude a large window where the
painting now hangs.
Lorenz said the mural was
painted in three sections, which
can be separated. The first section
shows a dismal, gray world, with
people tied down by bureaucracy
and hierarchy. She said the people
"see a light at the end of the
tunnel .. . they are reaching out
for what they see to be (a better
society)."
The second panel of the mural
depicts people deciding to take ac
tion. They help each other "over
the wall" — a symbolic hurdle —
to a better world.
Finally, the third section shows
the people moving toward Utopia.
