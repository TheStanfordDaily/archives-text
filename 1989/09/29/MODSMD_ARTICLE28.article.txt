## Cardinal, Spartans to spar Green says team will concentrate on stopping Johnson 
### Chris Crader Editorial staff 
Hoping to match last week's
result, but not necessarily the
means to that end, the Cardinal
football team takes the field to
morrow with one goal in mind —
a win.
"We're just looking at it as a
chance to be .500," Coach Denny
Green said. "That's our motiva
tion."
After a heart-stopping 18-17
comeback victory over Oregon last
week, Stanford is currently 1-2
overall and 1-2 in the Pacific 10
Conference. San Jose State, the
Cardinal's foe for Saturday, enters
the game 1-1 and 1-0 in the Big
West.
"I think this week we have to
continue to work hard and not
look past San Jose State," tailback
Gary Taylor said. "They come in
here and they want to beat us
bad. . . . That's the way it's going
to be this year."
The Spartans are coming off a
win against Pacific in which San
Jose State jumped out to a 34-7
lead in the third quarter. The
Tigers came back, however, and
the Spartans lost their intensity,
but recovered in time to put the
game out of reach with a late
touchdown, 41-32.
"We're trying to fit all the
pieces together," San Jose State
Coach Claude Gilbert said. "I
think we're starting to do that."
The Spartans currently have
one of the top offenses in the na
tion, led by their backfield. Quar
terback Matt Veatch is ranked
sixth nationally in total offense
at 280.5 yards per game, while
the running backs, Johnny
Johnson and Sheldon Canley,
average 372 all-purpose yards per
game.
Johnson, considered the super
star of the backfield, caught 11
passes for 203 yards last week.

Last year, he rushed for 1,200
yards and caught 60 passes,
marking the first time in NCAA
history that a player has accom
plished both those feats in the
same season.
"Our linebackers against
Johnny — that's a tough
matchup," Green said. "He makes
first downs and he scores. . . . He's
a very difficult guy to stop. He's
going to get the ball more than
he got it last week."
But if the Cardinal overlooks
Johnson, Canley could have a big
day. He is currently sixth in the
nation in all-purpose running,
averaging 220.5 yards per game.
He rushed for 142 yards last
week.
Trying to stop them will be a
Cardinal defense coming off its
best outing of the season.
Stanford limited Oregon to only
68 yards of total offense in the
second half and stopped the Ducks
repeatedly when Oregon was
trying to run out the clock.
"Defensively, we're pleased,"
Green said. "We're getting better,
and I think we're going to keep
getting better. . . . We gave up
some big plays. Other than that,

we played a pretty consistent
game."
Freshman inside linebacker
Dave Garnett will be making his
second start tomorrow after re
cording 11 tackles against Oregon.
"David came in and played well,"
Green said.
Stanford's secondary also will
be tested as Veatch has no trep
idation when it comes to airing it
out. He currently is averaging 296
yards passing per game.
Like the Cardinal defense, Stan
ford's offense is coming off its best
game of the season. The offense
produced 414 yards of total of
fense in the win and was able to
move the ball all day long.
Injuries, however, have
decimated the Cardinal backfield.
In addition, starting quarterback
Brian Johnson will not play due
to a sprained right shoulder. That
leaves redshirt freshman Steve
Smith as the starter and fresh
man John Lynch as the backup.
As far as the running back sit
uation goes, Jon Volpe, Charlie
Young and Jay Jay Lasley are out
for sure. To make matters worse,
starting fullback Scott Eschelman
will likely not play due to a cervi
cal pinched nerve he suffered in
practice Tuesday.
The good news is that fullback
Tommy Vardell, who was expected
not to play, is now listed as
probable. He is suffering from a
sterno-clavicular joint injury and
will be listed as the backup full
back behind Todd Burton. Gary
Taylor will start at halfback.
The patchwork backfield will be
facing an aggressive Spartan de
fense that will blitz as often as
possible. The unit is led by line
backer Everrett Lampkins and
noseguard George Muraoka, the
team's top two tacklers. Safety
Hesh Colar, who was a starter as
a true freshman last year, leads
the secondary, although he is suf
fering from a bruised shin.

he got it last week."
But if the Cardinal overlooks
Johnson, Canley could have a big
day. He is currently sixth in the
nation in all-purpose running,
averaging 220.5 yards per game.
He rushed for 142 yards last
week.
Trying to stop them will be a
Cardinal defense coming off its
best outing of the season.
Stanford limited Oregon to only
68 yards of total offense in the
second half and stopped the Ducks
repeatedly when Oregon was
trying to run out the clock.
"Defensively, we're pleased,"
Green said. "We're getting better,
and I think we're going to keep
getting better. . . . We gave up
some big plays. Other than that,

we played a pretty consistent
game."
Freshman inside linebacker
Dave Garnett will be making his
second start tomorrow after re
cording 11 tackles against Oregon.
"David came in and played well,"
Green said.
Stanford's secondary also will
be tested as Veatch has no trep
idation when it comes to airing it
out. He currently is averaging 296
yards passing per game.
Like the Cardinal defense, Stan
ford's offense is coming off its best
game of the season. The offense
produced 414 yards of total of
fense in the win and was able to
move the ball all day long.
Injuries, however, have
decimated the Cardinal backfield.
In addition, starting quarterback
Brian Johnson will not play due
to a sprained right shoulder. That
leaves redshirt freshman Steve
Smith as the starter and fresh
man John Lynch as the backup.
As far as the running back sit
uation goes, Jon Volpe, Charlie
Young and Jay Jay Lasley are out
for sure. To make matters worse,
starting fullback Scott Eschelman
will likely not play due to a cervi
cal pinched nerve he suffered in
practice Tuesday.
The good news is that fullback
Tommy Vardell, who was expected
not to play, is now listed as
probable. He is suffering from a
sterno-clavicular joint injury and
will be listed as the backup full
back behind Todd Burton. Gary
Taylor will start at halfback.
The patchwork backfield will be
facing an aggressive Spartan de
fense that will blitz as often as
possible. The unit is led by line
backer Everrett Lampkins and
noseguard George Muraoka, the
team's top two tacklers. Safety
Hesh Colar, who was a starter as
a true freshman last year, leads
the secondary, although he is suf
fering from a bruised shin.

Sophomore wide receiver Jon Pinckney will try to barrel over San Jose defenders this Saturday as
he did against Oregon cornerbacks last week.
Hoping to match last week's
result, but not necessarily the
means to that end, the Cardinal
football team takes the field to
morrow with one goal in mind —
a win.
"We're just looking at it as a
chance to be .500," Coach Denny
Green said. "That's our motiva
tion."
After a heart-stopping 18-17
comeback victory over Oregon last
week, Stanford is currently 1-2
overall and 1-2 in the Pacific 10
Conference. San Jose State, the
Cardinal's foe for Saturday, enters
the game 1-1 and 1-0 in the Big
West.
"I think this week we have to
continue to work hard and not
look past San Jose State," tailback
Gary Taylor said. "They come in
here and they want to beat us
bad. . . . That's the way it's going
to be this year."
The Spartans are coming off a
win against Pacific in which San
Jose State jumped out to a 34-7
lead in the third quarter. The
Tigers came back, however, and
the Spartans lost their intensity,
but recovered in time to put the
game out of reach with a late
touchdown, 41-32.
"We're trying to fit all the
pieces together," San Jose State
Coach Claude Gilbert said. "I
think we're starting to do that."
The Spartans currently have
one of the top offenses in the na
tion, led by their backfield. Quar
terback Matt Veatch is ranked
sixth nationally in total offense
at 280.5 yards per game, while
the running backs, Johnny
Johnson and Sheldon Canley,
average 372 all-purpose yards per
game.
Johnson, considered the super
star of the backfield, caught 11
passes for 203 yards last week.

"Our linebackers against

first downs and he scores. . . . He's
a very difficult guy to stop. He's
going to get the ball more than
he got it last week."
