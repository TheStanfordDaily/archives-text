# Spikers set to crunch Ducks in new gym
## 
### David Earnest Senior staff writer 
After opening the season with nine straight
road matches, the Stanford women's volleyball
team is ready for home. However, home may
not be ready for it.
Tonight the newly renovated Old Pavilion
will host its first sporting event in 20 years
when the Cardinal hosts Oregon State. Con
struction work has continued throughout the
week to ready the facility, now home to the
men's and women's volleyball teams, for
tonight's 7:30 p.m. first serve.
The team has practiced for the last three
weeks on the floor in Old Pavilion and the
coaching staffs have moved into their new
offices within the building. But crews have
been working to complete the pavilion's
restrooms and ticket booth area.
The team, however, willingly accepts the
dust and inconvenience in anticipation of play
ing for the first time in front of a favorable
crowd.
"We're pretty excited to start the home
schedule," Stanford Coach Don Shaw said.
"Now every good play we make will be amp
lified by the crowd rather than. . . quieting
the (opposition) crowd."
"[The crowdl is going to make a big differ

ence this year, a huge difference," junior setter
Karen Anderson said.
Working with a partisan crowd, Stanford
(7-2) will battle the Beavers tonight and then
face Oregon tomorrow night. After Wednes
day's four-game triumph over No. 8 California,
the sixth-ranked Cardinal tops the Pacific 10
Conference with a 3-0 conference record. USC
and UCLA, who Stanford will face in Los
Angeles at the end of next week, share the
conference's second spot with 2-0 records.
Oregon State is 0-4 in conference games
while Oregon is 1-3. But the Ducks have won
all their non-conference games to amass an
impressive 10-3 record. The Beavers are 4-1
in non-conference games.
"Both Oregon and Oregon State are im
proved this year," Shaw said. "We can't get
caught sleeping or they'll surprise us."
Stanford enters the weekend after dominat
ing Cal on Wednesday night in a match that
showcased the Cardinal's talented squad.

Sophomore Kristin Klein hit .439 for the
match with 22 kills and Klein, freshman Bev
Oden, sophomore Amy Cooper and senior
Laura Olesen together tallied 48 digs. The
team appears to have corrected many of their
offensive troubles from earlier in the season.
"We sided out well [on Wednesday night],"
Shaw said. "When our blocking and passing
off the serve are going, we usually play pretty
well."
"Our passing was pretty good," Klein said.
"Carrie [Feldman] did a great job setting.
That always helps."
Feldman, a freshman, started the California
match for injured senior setter Lara Asper,
who continues to suffer from a back injury.
Asper will likely not play in this weekend's
matches and does not appear likely to return
soon.
"[Asper's injury isl not something I'm going
to worry about because it's something we
have no control over," Shaw said.
In the meantime, Feldman will start the
weekend matches after effectively engineering
Wednesday's victory.
"Carrie did a good job sticking to the game
plan," Shaw said of the match. "She's doing
well running the offense."
Feldman had 43 assists in the match and
is second in sets on the team only to Asper.
