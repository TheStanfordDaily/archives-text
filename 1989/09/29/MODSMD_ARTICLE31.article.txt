Although his name is not as
familiar as some of these other
successful mentors, women's soc
cer coach Andeberhan has made
dramatic strides in the past two
seasons, bringing his squad into
the ranks of the nation's top
teams.
More explicitly, Andeberhan
brought a program which had won
a mere 12 games from 1985-87
to a 1988 record of 13-4-2 and a
No. 17 national ranking. This
season, the young team, composed
primarily of underclassmen (only
four seniors), raced to a 6-0 record
and a No. 10 ranking before losing
its last two games.
Previous to bringing his suc
cessful coaching tactics to Stan
ford, Andeberhan received a
degree in zoology from UCLA and
captained the Bruin soccer team.
Alter receiving a master's degree
at Loma Linda University, An
deberhan moved into coaching
and headed the men's soccer pro
gram at Cal State Los Angeles for
six seasons. He won four confer
ence championships and led his
team to the 1981 NCAA Division
II finals. That year he was recog
nized as the Far West Coach of
_the Year.

At Stanford, Andeberhan has
infused a winning attitude into
the women's soccer program.
After posting the 13-4-2 record
last season, Stanford landed a
talented recruiting class, includ
ing the nation's top recruit, Julie
Foudy.
According to freshman stand
out Carolyn Einstein, Andeber
han's positive attitude and
persistent encouragement fortified
her decision to come to Stanford.
"I cannot say I came to Stanford
exclusively for soccer," she said.
"Academic excellence was the pri
mary lure, but having Berhane's
positive attitude was definitely en
ticing."
Andeberhan's coaching style at
tempts to turn the negative points
of each game into positives. "He
is always supportive but that
doesn't mean he'll shirk from tell
ing us what we need to do,"
Einstein said.
After Wednesday night's loss to
a talented Santa Clara squad, the
team's record fell to 6-2. "The
game was frustrating," Andeber
han said. "But we need to look
at every game as a new opportu
nity to learn."
Saturday will be the first op
portunity for returning Stanford
students to see Andeberhan's win
ning style in action. The squad
will square off against an alumni
team at 10 a.m. on Harry Maloney
Field.
