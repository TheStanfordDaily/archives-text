# Three tennis recruits spark Card machine

After capturing last year's
national championship in ac
cordance with pre-season
expectations, the 1990 Stan
ford women's tennis team ap
pears to be further solidifying
its position within the col
legiate ranks.
The returning quartet of All-
Americas — Sandra Birch,
Debbie Graham, Lisa Green,
and Teri Whitlinger — is ac
companied this year by three
outstanding freshman recruits:
Meredith McGrath, Mario Car
ruth and Heather Willens.
McGrath, the top-ranked 18-
and-under player in the United
States last year and the con
sensus number-one college
recruit in the country, comes
to Stanford from Midland,
Mich. A precocious child,
McGrath first swung a tennis
racquet at the age of eight as
a response to what she called
"sheer boredom."
Quickly surpassing the chal
lenges posed by her first op
ponent, her mother, McGrath
instantly recognized her excep
tional ability. Nevertheless,
McGrath's athletic fervor
prompted her to pursue all
available sports including bas
ketball, soccer and other
"neighborhood games."
As an impressive collection
of tennis accolades continued
to pile in her room and as her
playing time simultaneously in
creased, McGrath began to at
tract national attention. At 12,
McGrath traveled to her first
nationals, and at 15 she won
the national title in her age
group.
Ranked 89th in the world in
singles and 44th in doubles,
McGrath is justifiably consid
ered a "superstar" by Stanford
Coach Frank Brennan. In 1987,
McGrath was presented the
Maureen Connolly Brinker
award as the most outstanding
junior player in the country.
Recently, she advanced to the
finals of the Wimbledon Junior
Championships, won the U.S.
Open Juniors Doubles Cham
pionships for the third straight
year, and was the runner-up
at this year's U.S. Open in the
professional bracket of mixed
doubles. Most notably, at the
Virginia Slims in Wichita,
Kan., McGrath defeated Raf
faella Reggi, then the 20th
ranked player in the world.
McGrath also has played dou
bles with Pam Shriver.
A highly energetic individual,

I want to be the
fifth All-America on
this squad. I know
the competition is
tremendous, but I
think I can do noth
ing but help the
team.

McGrath is marked by both an
irrepressible drive to excel in
tennis as well as an awareness
that Stanford is first a place
to grow as an individual. "I
intend to stay here four years.
I just have to mature so much,"
she said. "But I'm not against
evaluating where I am and
turning pro."
Initially, however, McGrath
seeks to strengthen several key
aspects of her game. An ag
gressive player, McGrath has
vanquished opponents previ
ously with a serve-and-volley
approach. At this level of ten
nis, McGrath suspects she will
need to more fully develop this
technique.
"It will take longer to develop
the foot speed here," she ex
plained. "I'm not yet sure how
much to serve and volley"
Despite her reservations, her
immediate goals are straight
forward. "I want to be the fifth
All-America on this squad. I
know the competition is tre
mendous, but I think I can do
nothing but help the team."
Brennan is in complete con
cord with this assessment. De
scribing his most celebrated
recruit, Brennan tersely
quipped, "She's the number
one player in the nation.
Everyone wants her."
Heather Willens, a California
native, similarly initiated her
tennis career at the age of
seven. Steeped in tradition,
Willens has been influenced by
her grandfather Frankie Albert
— a former Stanford quarter
back and a National Football
Foundation Hall of Famer —
as well as by her mother, once
the national collegiate tennis
champion who has been in
ducted into Stanford's Hall of
Fame. Following in such
eminent footsteps, Willens
quickly acclimated to the hard
courts of Southern California
and became a noted tourna
