# Three tennis recruits spark Card machine

After capturing last year's
national championship in ac
cordance with pre-season
expectations, the 1990 Stan
ford women's tennis team ap
pears to be further solidifying
its position within the col
legiate ranks.
The returning quartet of All-
Americas — Sandra Birch,
Debbie Graham, Lisa Green,
and Teri Whitlinger — is ac
companied this year by three
outstanding freshman recruits:
Meredith McGrath, Mario Car
ruth and Heather Willens.
McGrath, the top-ranked 18-
and-under player in the United
States last year and the con
sensus number-one college
recruit in the country, comes
to Stanford from Midland,
Mich. A precocious child,
McGrath first swung a tennis
racquet at the age of eight as
a response to what she called
"sheer boredom."
Quickly surpassing the chal
lenges posed by her first op
ponent, her mother, McGrath
instantly recognized her excep
tional ability. Nevertheless,
McGrath's athletic fervor
prompted her to pursue all
available sports including bas
ketball, soccer and other
"neighborhood games."
As an impressive collection
of tennis accolades continued
to pile in her room and as her
playing time simultaneously in
creased, McGrath began to at
tract national attention. At 12,
McGrath traveled to her first
nationals, and at 15 she won
the national title in her age
group.
Ranked 89th in the world in
singles and 44th in doubles,
McGrath is justifiably consid
ered a "superstar" by Stanford
Coach Frank Brennan. In 1987,
McGrath was presented the
Maureen Connolly Brinker
award as the most outstanding
junior player in the country.
Recently, she advanced to the
finals of the Wimbledon Junior
Championships, won the U.S.
Open Juniors Doubles Cham
pionships for the third straight
year, and was the runner-up
at this year's U.S. Open in the
professional bracket of mixed
doubles. Most notably, at the
Virginia Slims in Wichita,
Kan., McGrath defeated Raf
faella Reggi, then the 20th
ranked player in the world.
McGrath also has played dou
bles with Pam Shriver.
A highly energetic individual,

I want to be the
fifth All-America on
this squad. I know
the competition is
tremendous, but I
think I can do noth
ing but help the
team.

McGrath is marked by both an
irrepressible drive to excel in
tennis as well as an awareness
that Stanford is first a place
to grow as an individual. "I
intend to stay here four years.
I just have to mature so much,"
she said. "But I'm not against
evaluating where I am and
turning pro."
Initially, however, McGrath
seeks to strengthen several key
aspects of her game. An ag
gressive player, McGrath has
vanquished opponents previ
ously with a serve-and-volley
approach. At this level of ten
nis, McGrath suspects she will
need to more fully develop this
technique.
"It will take longer to develop
the foot speed here," she ex
plained. "I'm not yet sure how
much to serve and volley"
Despite her reservations, her
immediate goals are straight
forward. "I want to be the fifth
All-America on this squad. I
know the competition is tre
mendous, but I think I can do
nothing but help the team."
Brennan is in complete con
cord with this assessment. De
scribing his most celebrated
recruit, Brennan tersely
quipped, "She's the number
one player in the nation.
Everyone wants her."
Heather Willens, a California
native, similarly initiated her
tennis career at the age of
seven. Steeped in tradition,
Willens has been influenced by
her grandfather Frankie Albert
— a former Stanford quarter
back and a National Football
Foundation Hall of Famer —
as well as by her mother, once
the national collegiate tennis
champion who has been in
ducted into Stanford's Hall of
Fame. Following in such
eminent footsteps, Willens
quickly acclimated to the hard
courts of Southern California
and became a noted tourna
ment player at the age of 10.
Willens has accumulated a vast
array of honors. This year, she
was celebrated as the Athlete of
the Year by the Intercollegiate
Federation of Los Angeles.
Most recently, Willens reached
the finals of the Southern Cali
fornia Sectionals in the 18-and
under division and won doubles
at the same competition. For such
accomplishments, she was rated
the 1 lth-best junior player in the
country last year, despite being
only 17 years old.
Her most valuable ability, in her
own estimation, is her "ability to
think."
"I play a backcourt game," she
explained. "I don't have a strong
serve-and-volley game, but I'm a
hard-hitting player from the
baseline. My father coached me
and patterned my game after
Jimmy Connors. I hit a two
handed backhand and hit the ball
real flat. It benefits me because

it stops me from being nervous.
Besides, it's exciting."
Differing widely from other
players on the team, Willens has
no intention of turning pro and
would like to pursue a degree in
business following graduation.
She is most proud of the the bal
ance she has struck between her
game, her social life, and her ac
ademic performance, noting that,
in high school, she was able to
"get good grades while being able
to stay involved in tennis."
Willen's first collegiate
challenge will occur Oct. 23, at
the Ririan All-America tourna
ment, where sophomore Kylie
Johnson and other top players will
compete.
Carruth, a Californian hailing
from Bullard High School in
Fresno, advanced in much the
same fashion. At the age of eight,
Carruth refined her interest in
the game through clinics and
other lessons. Gradually, her abil
ities improved, culminating in
several qualifications to the na
tionals in the 12's division.
Growing comfortable with the
baseline, Carruth ascended the

ranks and established herself as
a dominant force in women's ten
nis. In 1988, Carruth won the
prestigious 16-and-under Na
tional Hardcourt Championships.
During her 1988 victory, Carruth
defeated Andra Kelser, the No.
1-ranked junior in the country at
the time.
Highlighting her honors, Car
ruth took the Ojai Tournament
championship this year in South
em California
Stanford always seemed ideal
for Carruth. "I always wanted to
go here," she said. "It's the best
of both worlds. We have the best
education and the best tennis."
Like Willens, Carruth — whose
father played tennis here — rep
resents another generation of
Stanford athletics.
Carruth's future path at Stan
ford is not as defined as
McGrath's or Willen's. She has no
certain plans for a pro career and
intends to assess her situation
during her junior year. Currently,
she hopes simply to "work hard
and improve each year" while en
joying the company of a team she
feels "fortunate to be on."

junior player in the country.
Recently, she advanced to the
finals of the Wimbledon Junior
Championships, won the U.S.
Open Juniors Doubles Cham
pionships for the third straight
year, and was the runner-up
at this year's U.S. Open in the
professional bracket of mixed
doubles. Most notably, at the
Virginia Slims in Wichita,
Kan., McGrath defeated Raf
faella Reggi, then the 20th
ranked player in the world.
McGrath also has played dou
bles with Pam Shriver.
A highly energetic individual,

I want to be the
fifth All-America on
this squad. I know
the competition is
tremendous, but I
think I can do noth
ing but help the
team.

McGrath is marked by both an
irrepressible drive to excel in
tennis as well as an awareness
that Stanford is first a place
to grow as an individual. "I
intend to stay here four years.
I just have to mature so much,"
she said. "But I'm not against
evaluating where I am and
turning pro."
Initially, however, McGrath
seeks to strengthen several key
aspects of her game. An ag
gressive player, McGrath has
vanquished opponents previ
ously with a serve-and-volley
approach. At this level of ten
nis, McGrath suspects she will
need to more fully develop this
technique.
"It will take longer to develop
the foot speed here," she ex
plained. "I'm not yet sure how
much to serve and volley"
Despite her reservations, her
immediate goals are straight
forward. "I want to be the fifth
All-America on this squad. I
know the competition is tre
mendous, but I think I can do
nothing but help the team."
Brennan is in complete con
cord with this assessment. De
scribing his most celebrated
recruit, Brennan tersely
quipped, "She's the number
one player in the nation.
Everyone wants her."
Heather Willens, a California
native, similarly initiated her
tennis career at the age of
seven. Steeped in tradition,
Willens has been influenced by
her grandfather Frankie Albert
— a former Stanford quarter
back and a National Football
Foundation Hall of Famer —
as well as by her mother, once
the national collegiate tennis
champion who has been in
ducted into Stanford's Hall of
Fame. Following in such
eminent footsteps, Willens
quickly acclimated to the hard
courts of Southern California
and became a noted tourna
ment player at the age of 10.
Willens has accumulated a vast
array of honors. This year, she
was celebrated as the Athlete of
the Year by the Intercollegiate
Federation of Los Angeles.
Most recently, Willens reached
the finals of the Southern Cali
fornia Sectionals in the 18-and
under division and won doubles
at the same competition. For such
accomplishments, she was rated
the 1 lth-best junior player in the
country last year, despite being
only 17 years old.
Her most valuable ability, in her
own estimation, is her "ability to
think."
"I play a backcourt game," she
explained. "I don't have a strong
serve-and-volley game, but I'm a
hard-hitting player from the
baseline. My father coached me
and patterned my game after
Jimmy Connors. I hit a two
handed backhand and hit the ball
real flat. It benefits me because

it stops me from being nervous.
Besides, it's exciting."
Differing widely from other
players on the team, Willens has
no intention of turning pro and
would like to pursue a degree in
business following graduation.
She is most proud of the the bal
ance she has struck between her
game, her social life, and her ac
ademic performance, noting that,
in high school, she was able to
"get good grades while being able
to stay involved in tennis."
Willen's first collegiate
challenge will occur Oct. 23, at
the Ririan All-America tourna
ment, where sophomore Kylie
Johnson and other top players will
compete.
Carruth, a Californian hailing
from Bullard High School in
Fresno, advanced in much the
same fashion. At the age of eight,
Carruth refined her interest in
the game through clinics and
other lessons. Gradually, her abil
ities improved, culminating in
several qualifications to the na
tionals in the 12's division.
Growing comfortable with the
baseline, Carruth ascended the

ranks and established herself as
a dominant force in women's ten
nis. In 1988, Carruth won the
prestigious 16-and-under Na
tional Hardcourt Championships.
During her 1988 victory, Carruth
defeated Andra Kelser, the No.
1-ranked junior in the country at
the time.
Highlighting her honors, Car
ruth took the Ojai Tournament
championship this year in South
em California
Stanford always seemed ideal
for Carruth. "I always wanted to
go here," she said. "It's the best
of both worlds. We have the best
education and the best tennis."
Like Willens, Carruth — whose
father played tennis here — rep
resents another generation of
Stanford athletics.
Carruth's future path at Stan
ford is not as defined as
McGrath's or Willen's. She has no
certain plans for a pro career and
intends to assess her situation
during her junior year. Currently,
she hopes simply to "work hard
and improve each year" while en
joying the company of a team she
feels "fortunate to be on."

Freshmen Mario Carruth (left), Meredith McGrath and Heather Wlllens will make an already invincible
women's tennis team even more so.
After capturing last year's
national championship in ac
cordance with pre-season
expectations, the 1990 Stan
ford women's tennis team ap
pears to be further solidifying
its position within the col
legiate ranks.
The returning quartet of All-
Americas — Sandra Birch,
Debbie Graham, Lisa Green,
and Teri Whitlinger — is ac
companied this year by three
outstanding freshman recruits:
Meredith McGrath, Mario Car
ruth and Heather Willens.
McGrath, the top-ranked 18-
and-under player in the United
States last year and the con
sensus number-one college
recruit in the country, comes
to Stanford from Midland,
Mich. A precocious child,
McGrath first swung a tennis
racquet at the age of eight as
a response to what she called
"sheer boredom."
Quickly surpassing the chal
lenges posed by her first op
ponent, her mother, McGrath
instantly recognized her excep
tional ability. Nevertheless,
McGrath's athletic fervor
prompted her to pursue all
available sports including bas
ketball, soccer and other
"neighborhood games."
As an impressive collection
of tennis accolades continued
to pile in her room and as her
playing time simultaneously in
creased, McGrath began to at
tract national attention. At 12,
McGrath traveled to her first
nationals, and at 15 she won
the national title in her age
group.
Ranked 89th in the world in
singles and 44th in doubles,
McGrath is justifiably consid
ered a "superstar" by Stanford
Coach Frank Brennan. In 1987,
McGrath was presented the
Maureen Connolly Brinker
award as the most outstanding
junior player in the country.
Recently, she advanced to the
finals of the Wimbledon Junior
Championships, won the U.S.
Open Juniors Doubles Cham
pionships for the third straight
