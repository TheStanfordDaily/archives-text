# Cardinal hockey looks to capture Big Game
## 
### John Louie Staff writer 
Stanford's rivalry with Califor
nia is never one to be taken lightly.
Traditionally, games, scores and
futures are decided in the final
seconds.
For the Stanford women's field
hockey team, tomorrow's game
against conference-leader Cal is
destined to live up to this tradi
tion. When Stanford last met Cal,
the Cardinal needed a last-second
goal by junior Katherine Pyrde to
put the Bears away 2-1 in sudden
death overtime.
The team is expecting the usual
tough match, but it hopes the
home field advantage will give
them the needed edge. "The pace
should be a lot slower for Cal,
who normally plays on artificial
turf," Coach Sheryl Johnson said.
"We've had a lot of practice on
grass fields."
"Cal isn't used to grass," added
sophomore forward Erin Mcßride.
"Hopefully, we are going to set
the pace of the game."
A different playing surface will
not be Stanford's only weapon
against the Bears. Already a solid
defensive team, the Cardinal
hopes to increase its offensive
threat by shuffling positions for
tomorrow's game. "Changing the
lineup should create more of a

scoring threat in the midfield,"
Johnson said.
By starting sophomore Susan
Leckrone at left midfielder in
stead of center midfielder,
Johnson hopes to barrage the
Bears with more shots. "The last
time we played Cal we only took
five shots, while they took 20,"
Johnson said. "Susan can cut by
the forwards well and is a good
shooter. Hopefully, this will get
her free and in scoring position."
Freshman Chris Trevino, who
normally plays left back, is sched
uled to start at center midfielder,
and junior Clare Stephens should
start at right midfielder. "Chris
is a good defensive player,"
Johnson said. "She will be able
to set up Susan and Clare for the
shots."
For Stanford, currently ranked
fourth in the Northern Pacific
conference, a victory over Cal to
morrow would raise their record
to 2-3-1 overall and 2-1-1 in the
conference. More importantly,
though, Stanford would remain
undefeated against Cal this
season.
"California's playing style is a
lot like ours," Johnson explained.
"They're more of a passing team
and support each other really
well."
"If we can get more shots off,
we should win," Mcßride said.
