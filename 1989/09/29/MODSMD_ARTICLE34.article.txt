# Daily alum ushers Greeks into 1989
## 
### Buck Montana Senior staff writer 
Following a long summer va
cation in Tahiti, everyone's fa
vorite Greeks are back at it. For
those of you not familiar with
the Greek of the Week, here is
a brief explanation.
Six members of The Daily's
staff, Nat Cousins, Chris Crader,
Dave Earnest, Greg Gottesman,
David Hirning and Mark Rogow
sky, make their predictions on
10 preselected college football
games every week in an effort
to display their powers of prog
nostication.
Additionally, each week they

are joined by a Guest Greek,
who contributes his knowledge,
or lack thereof, to The Daily's
readers. The person with the
most correct picks at the end of
the season wins the prize, a case
of Henry Weinhard's.
Trying to get the Guest Greek
off to a good start this year is
Jon Weisman, Daily Class of '89.
After serving as a sports editor
and the beat reporter for the
best Cardinal basketball team in
nearly half a century, Weisman
is currently working at the Los
Angeles Daily News.
Weisman was never a member
of the regular Greek panel dur
ing his time here, but is willing,

albeit hesitantly, to participate.
"I think I've always eschewed
the responsibility but I guess it's
as inevitable as ... umm ...
well, you get the idea.
"I gave up on my chances to
participate when I graduated. I
never thought it possible. I al
ways thought of it as ethereal.
Now I can revel in the embar
rassment of being part of it."
Weisman boldly vaticinated a
tie between Pittsburgh and West
Virginia. In another bold divina
tion, he expects San Diego State
to beat Utah, scoring 10 to the
Utes' square root of 99. Unfortu
nately, the square root of 99 is
not an easily printable number

and was replaced in the chart
by a nine.
Basically, my gut sense is that
it will be a close game, but not
a tie,"he said.
And when he was asked to
explain how Harvard was going
to score negative four points in
its epic struggle with Army, he
sagely explained:
"Penalties."
He wasn't kidding when he
called his picks "insouciant."
The smart money this year is
on the defending champion, Ear
nest. But if his Colorado Buf
faloes fall, it would be a boon
to the Husky contingent of Got
tesman and Hirning.
