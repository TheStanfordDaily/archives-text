Water polo coach Dante Det
tamanti is tired of being on the
road.
His Cardinal aqua men have
been away from home constantly
and continue that trend as they
square off against Fresno State
in Fresno this afternoon at 3 p.m.
Though the trips have been nec
essary and to exotic locations such
as Hawaii and Rhode Island, Det
tamanti still wants to cut down
on the travel time.
"We have traveled a lot this
season," Coach Dettamanti said.
"I mean, it is great to go to Hawaii
and then play on the East Coast,
but we're ready to play at home."
The team blew out Fresno 12-6
at the Irvine tournament earlier
in Sept. This game could be dif
ferent, however, as, for the first

time in Dettamanti's tenure, he
will take the team down on the
day of the game rather than the
night before.
"Doing it this way will save a
couple bucks and keep the guys
off the road," Dettamanti said.
The combination of traveling on
game day and an inferior oppon
ent would lead to thoughts of a
possible upset. Dettamanti is
aware of this but not worried. "I
usually find a way to get (the
team) excited," he said.
A loss to Fresno State this
weekend could play games with
the team's confidence before its
home opener this Sunday against
highly-ranked UC-Santa Barbara.
Having squeaked by the
Gauchos 7-6 just two weeks ago,
the team would seemingly need
to be at full mental strength. Det
tamanti, however, is not worried.
"This team has been pretty good
about taking things game by

1 mean, it is great to
go to Hawaii and then
play on the East
Coast, but we're
ready to play at
home.'

game," he said.
According to Dettamanti, the
13-3 Cardinal will rely on speed
and finesse rather than strength
in Friday's game. "This team is
the quickest I have ever coached
Stanford," Dettamanti said.
We just don't happen to be that
big. We're not like Cal who can
run over you. We have to use a
lot of finesse."
