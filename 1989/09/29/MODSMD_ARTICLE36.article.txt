# Booters to face 10th-ranked SMU

sports fans have found an unlikely
substitute for their football team,
which is just returning from a
NCAA-sanctioned two-year death
penalty, in the powerhouse men's
soccer squad.

Playing on turf could
be a disadvantage for
us because we're not
used to it, but we
should be able to
handle it.

The Cardinal booters head into
SMU's Ownby Stadium tonight to
face the lOth-ranked Mustangs in
the opening round of the SMU
Lettermen's Classic and will wind
up the tournament tomorrow
against North Texas State.
Stanford, riding high after a
dramatic 2-1 overtime victory over
Harvard, will attempt to climb
above the .500 barrier and extend
a two-game winning streak, which
has raised its record to 4-4-1.
"The Mustangs will be one of
the toughest opponents we play
this year," Coach Sam Koch said.
SMU returns nine starters from
a team that reached the NCAA
quarterfinals and finished 11th
in the polls last year.
Among the returnees for SMU
are fullback Kevin Grimes, a first
team All-American, forward
Larry McPhail, the squad's
leading scorer last year, and
goalkeeper Matt Frederick, who
surrendered a stingy 0.71 goals
per-game last year. "They have
some great players. We've got our
work cut out for us," Koch said.
Fatigue should be a factor
this weekend, as the Cardinal has
barely had time to rest after a
two-game East Coast visit. Inju
ries also have hampered Stanford,
which played without three
regulars at Harvard.

Goalkeeper Chris Helling, one
of the walking wounded for the
Cardinal, will return from a
rotator cuff injury tonight against
SMU, and freshman keeper Kyle
Krpata, who performed exception
ally in the last two victories, will
man the nets against North
Texas, according to Koch.
The Cardinal also must contend
with a foreign playing surface this
weekend, as Ownby Stadium
sports an astroturf field. "Playing
on turf could be a disadvantage
for us because we're not used to
it, but we should be able to handle
it," Koch explained.

Koch added that scrimmaging
Boston University on astroturf in
Boston before the Harvard game
helped the squad become more
accustomed to the artificial grass
surface.
As the season nears the halfway
point, the youthful Cardinal
squad still is jelling. Five fresh
men have started both of the last
two games, but Koch said they
are not playing like freshmen.
"They've all had experience in
pressure situations."
"We don't know each other on
the field yet," Koch said. "Every
game together helps."
