# Plans to study ties with Hoover nixed
## Fac Sen says no new committee 
### Morgan Slain Staff writer 
No new committee will be
formed to study ways of "restruc
turing relations" between the
Hoover Institution and the rest
of the University, the Faculty Sen
ate decided yesterday evening.
After more than an hour of
lively debate, the senators voted
18-15 to defeat the motion to
create the committee. The narrow
margin was extraordinary for the
Senate, which generally has lop
sided or unanimous votes.
The motion originated in a 1988
petition from 57 faculty members
that asked the Board of Trustees
to bring Hoover under "normal
academic governance" or end re
lations between the University
and Hoover's political activities.
Last year, the Senate watered
down the resolution, calling for a
committee investigation and
postponing voting until yesterday.
At the start of discussion, the
motion seemed a sure winner.
Three professors in succession
spoke out in favor of creating the
committee. One of them, Political
Science Prof. John Manley — a
key organizer of last year's peti
tion — issued a strong denounce
ment of Hoover's goals and its
political bias.
"Hoover is a think tank with a
mission and a political bent, and
this is why its continued indepen
dence is so vital to the (Hoover)
Institution," Manley said. A think
tank with such ardently conser
vative views and goals "has no
place on a university campus," he
added.

But after the initial surge in
favor of the motion, University
President Donald Kennedy spoke
out against it. Kennedy, who suc
cessfully urged the Senate last
year to delay the vote, said, "What
was unfinished business a year
ago is still unfinished business."
Both Kennedy and Provost
James Rosse said that Hoover's
cooperation with the University
is improving rapidly, and forming
the committee could jeopardize
the warming relations.
Philosophy Prof. Michael Brat
man offered a compromise amend
ment to the motion that called for
the proposed committee to work
with the Hoover director and the
Committee on the Professoriate.
After the amendment passed,
speakers' views on the motion
swung back and forth. Biology
Prof. Robert Simoni suggested
that, instead of forming the com
mittee, the Senate should have
Rosse give regular reports on re
lations with Hoover.
But Economics Prof. Kenneth
Arrow responded that an investi
gating committee would not
hinder Hoover operations or its
improving relations with the Uni
versity.
Senate Chair Carolyn Lougee,
professor of history, ordered a
voice vote, but the opposing sides
were equally loud. The 18-15 tally
against the motion was an
nounced after a second vote —
this time by hand.
Despite the defeat, Manley
maintained his sense of humor.
As he left the meeting room, he
smiled and said, "Well, I thought
we won the voice vote."
