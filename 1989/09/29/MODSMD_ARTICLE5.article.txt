# Protesters given conditions, options for service penalties
## 
### Sophia Shing Staff writer 
The 51 protesters sentenced by the Uni
versity to perform 75 hours of community
service for the May 15 takeover of Building
10 have been given a list of more than 75
options to help them complete their re
quired hours.
The students have until the end of the
school year to serve their sentences, which
are penalties for violating the Policy on
Campus Disruptions.
The work must be done on campus, and
the students must not receive pay or aca
demic credit for doing it. In addition, the
work must not be something the student
"would have done anyway," according to a
handout given to the students by the Dean
of Student Affairs Office at meetings yes
terday and Wednesday.
The options include a wide array of vol
unteer jobs, including tutoring children for
Barrio Assistance, data entry for the
Alumni Association, helping the Student-
Police Relations Panel, cleaning offices in
the Undergraduate Studies building and
hashing for University food service.
Sophomore Mae Lee, one of the students
who faces a community service sentence,
said, "I'm glad that we can turn our pun
ishment into something positive and con
tinue our involvement in serving the com
munity."
For the students who have graduated
since the occupation, the University will

allow the service hours to be completed at
a location convenient to the individual. Stu
dents who have gone overseas must either
fulfill their service hours abroad or when
they return to the United States.
However, these conditions only apply to
the 75 hours of service imposed by the
University.
Most protesters are also facing an addi
tional 40 hours of service imposed by Santa
Clara County. The specifications for the
40 court-appointed hours community serv
ice have not yet been outlined.
The students are scheduled to appear in
court next Wednesday and Friday for for
mal sentencing. Most agreed to plead no
contest last June to the charge of trespass
ing.
In addition, they will be on probation
for six months, at which time the trespass
ing charge, a misdemeanor, will be dropped
from their criminal records.
Five students who demonstrated outside
of the building are facing more serious
charges. Senior Matt Price is being charged
with three misdemeanors while sopho
mores David Adler, Hazim Ansari and Paul
Valdez have each been charged with
obstructing the duties of a police officer.
Junior Louis Jackson is being charged with
six misdemeanors.
These students may have harsher sen
tences to fulfill than the other protesters.
Jackson could face up to two years in jail
if he is found guilty of battery and inciting
to riot.
