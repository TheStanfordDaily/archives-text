Rain dampens 'all-campus' party
Coffee House regulars were treated to a free
concert last night when rain forced the second
annual All-Campus Welcome Back Celebration to
move inside.
The party, organized by the Concert Network,
Tresidder Union and the ASSU, featured live
music from two bands, free soft drinks and eight
raffle prizes. The last-minute change in location
caused one of three originally scheduled bands
to cancel and the party to start an hour late.
Originally slated for the Tresidder back patio,
the party, which cost about $5,000, did not attract
a large crowd. Those who went, however, said
they enjoyed the music.
The first band to perform was Dr. Loco's Rock
in' Jalapeno Band, a Latino rock band led by
Anthropology Assoc. Prof. Jos6 Cuellar.
The night concluded with the performance of
the I World International Rockers, a Reggae band.
Voice Farm, the third band that was scheduled
to play, had to cancel because the Coffee House
was too small for their act.

Pub Night undaunted by 'abolition'
Though their organizational status is still un
certain, the Senior Class Presidents went ahead
with this year's first Pub Night, held at the Edge
(formerly the Vortex) last night.
President Jeff Kritzer said that the presidents
are "not worried" about the insurance liability.

"Right now we're under a verbal agreement —
and there's no reason to doubt it — that the
University will cover us" if anything goes wrong
at an event, he said.
Kritzer added that the Senior Class has initi
ated the process of becoming a voluntary student
organization, but has also asked the ASSU to
research whether insurance costs would actually
increase if the Senior Class were reincorporated
into the ASSU.
In the mean time, the presidents get to keep
their space in the ASSU offices, but will have
to pay an as-yet-undetermined "facilities charge"
to the ASSU for the space, Kritzer said.

Police contract talks kept quiet
The University and the Police Officer's Asso
ciation are currently negotiating to renew Stan
ford's contract with its police officers, which ex
pired last summer.
No explanation has been offered as to why it's
taking so long to renew the contract or whether
the delay is affecting police services, though the
public safety department reportedly would not
hold talks Thursday through Sunday for "public
safety reasons."
Sue Hoerger, the University's chief negotiator,
told The Daily that she and the union's chief
negotiator, Tony Spitarelli, had agreed not to
comment to the press about the talks.
