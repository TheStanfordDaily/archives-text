All these can be yours if you enter the
exciting world of sports journalism at The
Stanford Daily. We need writers and
photographers to cover Stanford sports. There
are many non-sports related positions open as
well. If you're interested, come by our offices
at The Storke Publications Bldg. (across from
Terman Pond), or give us a call at 723-4632.
Ask for Chris Crader, Nat Cousins
or Greg Gottesman.
