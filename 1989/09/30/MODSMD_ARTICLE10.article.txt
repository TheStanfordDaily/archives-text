# San Jose State-Stanford Matchups
## 
### 
San Jose State

Stanford

Johnson comes into today's
game as a known offensive force.
He became the first player in col
lege history to rush for 1,200
yards and catch 60 passes last
year. The running back has been
used more as a pass-catcher this
season, as evidenced by his 11
recptions for 203 yards last week
against Pacific. Trying to stop
him will be the talented Stanford
linebacking corp. Led by inside
backer Tunney, the Cardinal has
been very strong against the run
this season, but the team has
shown difficulty covering the
short passing game.

San Jose State loves to blitz.
The Spartans have played a very
aggressive defense for several
years and it has served them well.
What this means, however, is that
the Spartan defensive backs are
often left in single coverage on
the opposing receivers. If that
happens, Clarke and his backfield
mates will have problems han
dling Batson, a speedster who
knows how to get open. If the
Spartan blitz doesn't reach the
Cardinal quarterback, Clarke
could find himself watching Bat
son and Stanford light up the
scoreboard.

Smith will start his third game
for Stanford today, and he is
hoping it won't be much like the
first two. In those games, Smith
did not get enough protection and
was about as calm as would be
expected of a freshman quarter
back seeing many 275-pound pas
srushers coming at him. In his
relief performance last week, how
ever, the Folsom, La., native
looked cool enough to earn the
moniker the Cajun Cucumber.
Colar, who is nursing a bruised
shin, will see a lot of Smith today,
either on blitzes or in coverage.

Stanford-San Jose State games
have often been wild affairs, and
if this one lives up to that repu
tation, it could well come down
to the kicking game. San Jose
State has a fine kicker in Kirk,
a senior who has yet to miss a
kick this season. He is 8-for-8 on
extra points and 2-for-2 on field
goals. Stanford sends out Hop
kins, a junior who has been in
consistent this year. Hopkins is
3-for-3 on points-after, but is a
mere 2-for-7 on field goal at
tempts.

The basis of the Spartans de
fense is to try to stop runners in
the backfield and to try to sack
passers before they have a chance
to throw. Muraoka is one of the
players most responsible in the
defenses' ideal of making the big
play before the other team makes
it against you. Lining up against
him is Gillingham, one of the most
experienced members of Stan
ford's offensive line. The Cardinal
line had its best outing of the
year last week, but will have to
do even better to open holes for
the starting running backs and to
give Smith a chance to go long.

The Spartans have one of the
best running back combinations
in the nation in Canley and
Johnson. On the other side of the
ball, Stanford has been tough
against the run all year. So, San
Jose State will likely try to throw
screen and swing passes, plays
that have hurt Stanford, in an
effort to move the ball. Canley
has been the big ground-gainer
for the Spartans but he is also a
fine receiver. If SJSU tries to
throw him the ball, it will be up
to Hinckley either to cover him
or to sack quarterback Matt
Veatch before he can unload.

goals. Stanford sends out Hop
kins, a junior who has been in
consistent this year. Hopkins is
3-for-3 on points-after, but is a
mere 2-for-7 on field goal at
tempts.

The basis of the Spartans de
fense is to try to stop runners in
the backfield and to try to sack
passers before they have a chance
to throw. Muraoka is one of the
players most responsible in the
defenses' ideal of making the big
play before the other team makes
it against you. Lining up against
him is Gillingham, one of the most
experienced members of Stan
ford's offensive line. The Cardinal
line had its best outing of the
year last week, but will have to
do even better to open holes for
the starting running backs and to
give Smith a chance to go long.

The Spartans have one of the
best running back combinations
in the nation in Canley and
Johnson. On the other side of the
ball, Stanford has been tough
against the run all year. So, San
Jose State will likely try to throw
screen and swing passes, plays
that have hurt Stanford, in an
effort to move the ball. Canley
has been the big ground-gainer
for the Spartans but he is also a
fine receiver. If SJSU tries to
throw him the ball, it will be up
to Hinckley either to cover him
or to sack quarterback Matt
Veatch before he can unload.
