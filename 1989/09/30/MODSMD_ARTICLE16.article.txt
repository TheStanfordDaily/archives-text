# Stanford running out of backs (and knees too)
## 
### David Hirning Editorial staff 
There's a rumor going around the Pacific
10 Conference these days that if you walk
by Stanford football Coach Denny Green's
office, you just may see this sign in the
window:

The prospect may seem slightly funny,
but chances are you won't catch Green or
any other Stanford fans laughing. Instead,
most Cardinal folks seem to be busy trying
to remember the last time things have been
so bad in the backfield for Stanford.
After only three games, the top five run
ning backs on Green's depth chart are
sidelined with injuries. In simple terms,
third- and fourth-stringers in preseason
camp are now starting, and may continue
to do so for anywhere from a week to the
entire season. Only one of the players
(Tommy Vardell) has a chance of playing
today.
A rundown: Jon Volpe left knee sprain,
out probably two more games. Charlie
Young more left knee sprains, will have
surgery this weekend to determine his
status. Vardell sterno-clavicular joint
bruise, day-to-day status. Jay Jay Lasley
right knee sprain, gone for about a
month. Scott Eschelman cevical nerve
pinch, doubtful for today.
How bad is it? Backing up sophomore
Gary Taylor at halfback is true freshman
walk-on Mike Buckley. However, should the
carnage continue and Taylor join the bunch
being bandaged on the bench, Green will
likely preserve Buckley's redshirt year and
go with sophomore Herbie Berry. Berry
was one of the top high school running
backs in California two years ago.
The catch is, Berry was a free safety
last Saturday. "I suppose if we need to, we
could pull some more guys from the de
fense," Green half-joked at a press confer
ence Tuesday. "We think he'll pick it up
fast."
What happened? No one is quite sure,
but some suspect that the gods of college
football are once again making sure that
Stanford football remains known chiefly
for its quarterbacks and not its halfbacks.
After all, everyone knows that Heisman
Trophy-winner Jim Plunkett and consen
sus All-American John Elway both starred
on the Farm. But why don't running backs
Darrin Nelson and Brad Muster command
the same respect in the minds of football
fans?
Answer: Both were injured at the height
of their success and thus were thwarted
in their quest for Heisman glory. Notice
also that both have gone on to very suc
cessful pro football careers their injuries
just slowed them up enough to allow them
to take a backseat to the Stanford QBs.
Most everyone remembers Muster,
touted as a Heisman Trophy candidate
going into the 1987 campaign. Coming off
a banner junior year in which he gained
1,053 yards, expectations were high for
Muster and for the Cardinal as a team.
Instead of leading Stanford to a second
consecutive bowl game, Muster led the
cheering from the bench as a nagging ankle
injury prevented him from playing half the
season. The Cardinal stumbled to a 5-6
season and Muster didn't bother going to
New York for the Heisman banquet.
Further back in Stanford annals is the
ominous story of Nelson, who as a true
freshman ~ gained the most rushing yards
in one season of any Stanford hack ever.
He also set an unprecedented standard by
becoming the first player in collegiate his
tory to gain 1,000 yards and catch 50 passes
in a season.

The next year, 1978, Nelson did it again.
Besides getting the second-highest rushing
yardage total for a season (he missed his
freshman total by eight yards), he doubled
his touchdowns to six and did the 1,000-50
thing again for good measure.
For his junior year, the hype was im
mense. Darrin Nelson for All-America,
Heisman Trophy, Player of the Century,
... you get the picture. Stanford had won
the 1978 Bluebonnet Bowl in a magnificent
comeback, and with a freshman quarter
back named Elway who was supposed to
be a great one, the sky was the limit.
But the Curse of the Stanford Running
Back would have none of this. Nelson was
forced to sit out the 1979 season after
being injured, and redshirted in order to
save his final two years of eligibility. Stan
ford slipped to 5-5-1 and did not go bowling
over the holidays.
Maybe it was the layoff, but Nelson
didn't come back and rack up the numbers
in 1980 that everyone by then expected of
him. He "slipped" to 889 yards, and eternal
glory would not be his. The Quarterback
U. reputation was cemented as Elway threw
for 2,889 yards and 27 TDs.
Enter Jon Volpe, who followed the set
tradition and had an outstanding sopho
more year. But after gaining 1,027 yards
and getting the nod from the Stanford
Sports Information Department as an All-
America candidate, boom! Knee injury.
Volpe has not yet been 100 percent, did
not play at all last week against Oregon,
and has managed only 120 yards rushing
for the season.
Young is another victim, a budding star
in 1987 who scored two touchdowns in
Stanford's narrow season-opening loss at
Washington that year. But injuries limited
his time, and he gained only 130 yards
rushing in nine games.
After a healthy 1988 in which Young
caught 43 passes as a slotback to lead the
team in receiving, he injured his back and
sat out spring practice. Then, as he was
on his way to recovery, he re-injured his
knee this fall and hasn't played a down in
1989.
With this preponderance of evidence,
Stanford fans should have seen the
harbingers of doom as Lasley, a redshirt
freshman, stepped in for the injured Volpe
last week and quickly gained 36 yards on
five carries. Sure enough, Lasley was down
and out of the ball game with a knee injury
before the first quarter ended.
And so the only question left to be asked
is, does Stanford have enough warm bodies
to run the ball? "Not if guys keep going
down like they have," running backs Coach
Tyrone Willingham said. "I've never seen
anything like this before, but that's foot
ball. Something new every day."
Green, a former running backs coach at
Stanford under Bill Walsh in the '7os,
realizes, like Willingham does, that all the
Cardinal can do is go with the players who
are healthy. "(The players) have to rally
behind the guy that's in there, if they want
to win," Green said. "We have to adapt,
and use a style of play without a lot of
running backs." Green also afforded him
self a brief, luxurious glimpse of the future
in his assessment of the "Running Back
Ward."
"Next season we could have 10 running
backs and not lose one of them." Two
top-flight running backs, Glyn Milburn and
Ellery Roberts, are sitting out this year
after transferring from Oklahoma and
Miami, and both are "talented players" who
Green says will definitely help the team.
But for the present, Green may be busy
distributing hastily-produced recruitment
posters with a stern Uncle Sam-like char
acter in a Stanford hat pointing out at the
onlooker. The caption would read: "Stan
ford wants YOU to play halfback this Sat
urday."

Gary Taylor at halfback is true freshman
walk-on Mike Buckley. However, should the
carnage continue and Taylor join the bunch
being bandaged on the bench, Green will
likely preserve Buckley's redshirt year and
go with sophomore Herbie Berry. Berry
was one of the top high school running
backs in California two years ago.
The catch is, Berry was a free safety
last Saturday. "I suppose if we need to, we
could pull some more guys from the de
fense," Green half-joked at a press confer
ence Tuesday. "We think he'll pick it up
fast."
What happened? No one is quite sure,
but some suspect that the gods of college
football are once again making sure that
Stanford football remains known chiefly
for its quarterbacks and not its halfbacks.
After all, everyone knows that Heisman
Trophy-winner Jim Plunkett and consen
sus All-American John Elway both starred
on the Farm. But why don't running backs
Darrin Nelson and Brad Muster command
the same respect in the minds of football
fans?
Answer: Both were injured at the height
of their success and thus were thwarted
in their quest for Heisman glory. Notice
also that both have gone on to very suc
cessful pro football careers their injuries
just slowed them up enough to allow them
to take a backseat to the Stanford QBs.
Most everyone remembers Muster,
touted as a Heisman Trophy candidate
going into the 1987 campaign. Coming off
a banner junior year in which he gained
1,053 yards, expectations were high for
Muster and for the Cardinal as a team.
Instead of leading Stanford to a second
consecutive bowl game, Muster led the
cheering from the bench as a nagging ankle
injury prevented him from playing half the
season. The Cardinal stumbled to a 5-6
season and Muster didn't bother going to
New York for the Heisman banquet.
Further back in Stanford annals is the
ominous story of Nelson, who as a true
freshman ~ gained the most rushing yards
in one season of any Stanford hack ever.
He also set an unprecedented standard by
becoming the first player in collegiate his
tory to gain 1,000 yards and catch 50 passes
in a season.

The next year, 1978, Nelson did it again.
Besides getting the second-highest rushing
yardage total for a season (he missed his
freshman total by eight yards), he doubled
his touchdowns to six and did the 1,000-50
thing again for good measure.
For his junior year, the hype was im
mense. Darrin Nelson for All-America,
Heisman Trophy, Player of the Century,
... you get the picture. Stanford had won
the 1978 Bluebonnet Bowl in a magnificent
comeback, and with a freshman quarter
back named Elway who was supposed to
be a great one, the sky was the limit.
But the Curse of the Stanford Running
Back would have none of this. Nelson was
forced to sit out the 1979 season after
being injured, and redshirted in order to
save his final two years of eligibility. Stan
ford slipped to 5-5-1 and did not go bowling
over the holidays.
Maybe it was the layoff, but Nelson
didn't come back and rack up the numbers
in 1980 that everyone by then expected of
him. He "slipped" to 889 yards, and eternal
glory would not be his. The Quarterback
U. reputation was cemented as Elway threw
for 2,889 yards and 27 TDs.
Enter Jon Volpe, who followed the set
tradition and had an outstanding sopho
more year. But after gaining 1,027 yards
and getting the nod from the Stanford
Sports Information Department as an All-
America candidate, boom! Knee injury.
Volpe has not yet been 100 percent, did
not play at all last week against Oregon,
and has managed only 120 yards rushing
for the season.
Young is another victim, a budding star
in 1987 who scored two touchdowns in
Stanford's narrow season-opening loss at
Washington that year. But injuries limited
his time, and he gained only 130 yards
rushing in nine games.
After a healthy 1988 in which Young
caught 43 passes as a slotback to lead the
team in receiving, he injured his back and
sat out spring practice. Then, as he was
on his way to recovery, he re-injured his
knee this fall and hasn't played a down in
1989.
With this preponderance of evidence,
Stanford fans should have seen the
harbingers of doom as Lasley, a redshirt
freshman, stepped in for the injured Volpe
last week and quickly gained 36 yards on
five carries. Sure enough, Lasley was down
and out of the ball game with a knee injury
before the first quarter ended.
And so the only question left to be asked
is, does Stanford have enough warm bodies
to run the ball? "Not if guys keep going
down like they have," running backs Coach
Tyrone Willingham said. "I've never seen
anything like this before, but that's foot
ball. Something new every day."
Green, a former running backs coach at
Stanford under Bill Walsh in the '7os,
realizes, like Willingham does, that all the
Cardinal can do is go with the players who
are healthy. "(The players) have to rally
behind the guy that's in there, if they want
to win," Green said. "We have to adapt,
and use a style of play without a lot of
running backs." Green also afforded him
self a brief, luxurious glimpse of the future
in his assessment of the "Running Back
Ward."
"Next season we could have 10 running
backs and not lose one of them." Two
top-flight running backs, Glyn Milburn and
Ellery Roberts, are sitting out this year
after transferring from Oklahoma and
Miami, and both are "talented players" who
Green says will definitely help the team.
But for the present, Green may be busy
distributing hastily-produced recruitment
posters with a stern Uncle Sam-like char
acter in a Stanford hat pointing out at the
onlooker. The caption would read: "Stan
ford wants YOU to play halfback this Sat
urday."

Both Charlie Young, top, and Brad Muster have had great seasons at Stanford only
to be hampered by injury the following year.
There's a rumor going around the Pacific
10 Conference these days that if you walk
by Stanford football Coach Denny Green's
office, you just may see this sign in the
window:

The prospect may seem slightly funny,
but chances are you won't catch Green or
any other Stanford fans laughing. Instead,
most Cardinal folks seem to be busy trying
to remember the last time things have been
so bad in the backfield for Stanford.
After only three games, the top five run
ning backs on Green's depth chart are
sidelined with injuries. In simple terms,
third- and fourth-stringers in preseason
camp are now starting, and may continue
to do so for anywhere from a week to the
entire season. Only one of the players
(Tommy Vardell) has a chance of playing
today.
A rundown: Jon Volpe left knee sprain,
out probably two more games. Charlie
Young more left knee sprains, will have
surgery this weekend to determine his
status. Vardell sterno-clavicular joint
bruise, day-to-day status. Jay Jay Lasley
right knee sprain, gone for about a
month. Scott Eschelman cevical nerve
pinch, doubtful for today.
