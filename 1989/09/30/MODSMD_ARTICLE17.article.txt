# CARDIAC CARD
## Stanford caps miracle comeback with last-second field goal 
### 
Though many fans headed for the
exits midway through the
fourth quarter last week, the
guys who really mattered the
players never believed the Ducks had
won the game.
All day, the Stanford defense kept
Oregon and "Air Musgrave" in check.
And, quarterback Brian Johnson was
moving the offense up and down the
field. The Cardinal just couldn't punch
it in to the end zone.
That is, until B.J. hocked up with Gary
Taylor in the flat. Taylor faked inside,
headed toward the sideline and raced in
for the TD. Suddenly, Stanford had life.
Minutes later, Johnson was knocked
out while moving the Cardinal to a sec
ond score. Steve Smith came off the
bench and completed the drive, sneaking

in to the end zone on a keeper. He hit
Scott Eschelman for the two-point con
version and suddenly the Ducks' lead
was trimmed to two.
Unfortunately for Stanford, there were
only 71 ticks left on the clock. The home
team would need a perfect onside kick
and they got one. John Hopkins per
formed the task, Cory Booker recovered
and the Cardinal needed nothing more
than to move into field-goal range.
The Smith-led offense did just that,
getting it to the Duck 20. Hopkins, who
had missed five straight field goals, came
in and booted the game winner.
An improbable, perhaps impossible,
comeback was suddenly a reality. The
players went crazy, the crowd went crazy
and there was much rejoicing down on
The Farm.
