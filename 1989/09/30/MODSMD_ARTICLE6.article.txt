## Stanford hopes it knows the way to shut down San Jose 
### Mark Rogowsky Editorial staff 
Right after one of the most
thrilling wins in the recent history
of Stanford football, Coach Denny
Green was talking Rose Bowl.
This year.
"No chance!" you say. Maybe,
but if the Cardinal (1-2) is going
to make noise this season, the
first thing the team has to do is
get by San Jose State today.
"No problem!" you say. Maybe,
but Brian Johnson is out with a
sprained shoulder. Redshirt fresh
men Steve Smith, a hero last
week, will be back in a starting
role where he's struggled so far.
And, if the Cardinal overlooks
the Spartans (1-1), it could be a
long day. While the San Jose State
defense may be suspect the
unit nearly squandered a 34-7
lead last week the offense is
potent. With a capital P.
The offense has managed to
rack up an average of 447 yards
per game. The Spartan machine
is fueled by a gifted backfield trio:
quarterback Matt Veatch, tailback
Sheldon Canley and running back
Johnny Johnson.
Veatch has completed his passes
at an excellent 59.7-percent clip
and has thrown for 592 yards. He
has thrown for three TDs. His
favorite target is Johnson who
will certainly be a high-round
choice in the NFL draft next
spring. ,
Johnson, one of the premier
backs in the nation last year, has
only carried the ball 12 times this
year. To make up for his lack of
action on the ground, though, he's
caught 19 passes for 262 yards.
And, don't be surprise if San Jose
State Coach Claude Gilbert has
Johnson carry the ball a bit more
often today.
Even if he doesn't, the Stanford
defense should have its hands full
with Canley. A pint-sized back of
the Jon Volpe/Joe Morris build,
Canley is a dynamic runner with
a 5.1 yard-average (See story,
page 4).
If wide receiver Kevin Evans is
able to play, the Cardinal will face
a potentially devastating triple
threat in Johnson, Canley and
Evans. Getting to Veatch and con
taining Canley are high priorities.
The good news for Stanford is
that they had to control Oregon's
Bill Musgrave last week and
they did.

As a matter of fact, the Cardinal
defense has been solid all season
and seems to be getting better.
Scott Palmbush, Aaron Rembisz
and Lester Archambeau have been
stuffing the run well and provid
ing increased pressure.
The linebacking corps espe
cially the left side of Rob Hinckley
and Jono Tunney has done
exactly what's been asked of it.
Hinckley, one of 14 finalists for
the Butkus Award honoring the
nation's top linebacker, was
named Pacific 10 Conference De
fensive Player of the Week for his
efforts against Oregon.
But, as well as the front seven
has played, it's the Stanford sec
ondary that's being drenched in
a shower of accolades. Considered
a cut below mediocre entering last
season, the Cardinal defensive
backfield is now regarded as one

of the best in the Pac-10.
Cornerbacks Kevin Scott and
Alan Grant are shining as the
stars of the unit. Blessed with
natural ability, great work ethics
and the "you can't beat me" ar
rogance needed to succeed at cor
ner, Grant and Scott have given
up less than a handful of big plays
in the past season and a half.
Tuan Van Le, the Cardinal's
No. 3 corner but its No. 1 show
man, has made big plays off the
bench in each game.
On the other side of the ball,
Stanford has an opportunity to
light up the scoreboard against
the consistently inconsistent Spar
tan defense. But the squad will
have to do it without Jon Volpe,
Charlie Young, Jay Jay Lasley and
probably Scott Eschelman.
That puts Gary Taylor the
man whose juke-and-go touch

down reception gave Stanford life
last week into a starting role
with freshman walk-on Mike
Buckley as his backup. The only
good news is that Tommy Vardell,
who was believed to be out, is
making excellent progress and
should be available.
At wide receiver, Stanford can
be delighted that it's getting pro
duction out of Ed McCaffrey, Wal
ter Batson, Jon Pinckney, et al.
Tight ends Jim Price and Turner
Baur have also caught their share
of passes.
Assuming the Cardinal line,
coming off an excellent showing
against the Ducks, can pick up
the blitzing of the Spartans' "46"
defense, Smith could have his first
big game as a collegian. It would
also give him a lot of confidence
heading into next week's battle
with No. 1 Notre Dame.

On special teams, Stanford has
a number of positive signs to point
to while still asking a number of
nagging questions.
On the plus side, Scott and
Grant have been terrific on kickoff
returns. Last week, Scott turned
a fumbled kickoff into a 38-yard
gain. Grant's punt returns have
been acceptable, but nothing like
the ones he produce in 'B7 when
he led the nation. Opponents
aren't hurting the Cardinal with
long returns.
Green still has to be high from
the team's performance on the on
side kick against Oregon. Not only
did Hopkins generate the perfect
bounce, but Jimmy Klein's
ideally-timed burial of two Ducks
was critical in allowing Stanford
to recover the ball.

Halfback Gary Taylor, the man who scored Stanford's first touchdown against Oregon last week is
making his first start for Stanford today.

If Stanford is
to beat the
Spartans, the
defense must
keep Johnny
Johnson on his
back and out
of the end zone
today.
Hopkins, who had uncharac
teristically missed five straight
field goals, booted the game win
ner minutes later.
The punting is still a sore point.
High school Ail-American Paul
Stonehouse took over the chore
from Hopkins but failed to
impress with a 30.5-yard average.
Spartan punter Jim Hughes has
an unspectacular 40.9 average
and San Jose State's kicker, Jim
Kirk, really hasn't been called
upon too often.
