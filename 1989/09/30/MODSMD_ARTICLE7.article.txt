# Four-star 'General'
## Spartan running back marches out of teammate's shadow, steps into limelight 
### Chris Crader Editorial staff 
Sheldon Canley is having a terrific
season.
The San Jose State tailback is currently
third in the nation in all-purpose running.
He is also in the nations top 20 in rushing,
averaging 108 yards per game. He has
caught nine passes in only two games. And
he is averaging 21 yards per kickoff return.
In addition to all these impressive sta
tistics, however, there is something more
amazing, more unbelievable, that Canley
has done this year.
Going into his team's third game of the
season, no one has even heard of him. Such
is the life of Johnny Johnson's running
mate.
You see, Johnson ran for over 1,200 yards
and caught more than 60 passes last year,
a combination never before done in NCAA
history.
But Canley isn't worried about what the
media thinks; he's worried about helping
his team win.
"I'm just out there doing what I can
do," he said. "I'm out there getting the
job done."

Getting the job done is exactly what Can
ley, who at 5-foot-8 and 193 pounds also
goes by the name the Little General, has
done. Johnson, the fullback, has been used
more as a decoy and as a receiver this year
and the result has been a well-balanced,
explosive Spartan offense. Canley is averag
ing 221.5 yards of all-purpose running
(rushing, receiving and kick returns) per
game and Johnson is averaging 150.5 while
quarterback Matt Veatch is throwing for
296 yards per contest.
"I feel very confident about our offense,
all-around," Canley said. "They have to
concentrate on stopping both Johnny and
me. Now I see what an offense could do."
Before coming to San Jose State, Canley
was the offense. After graduating from
Lompoc High School in Lompoc, Calif.,
Canley went to Allen Hancock Junior
College. He rushed for 485 yards and scored
six touchdowns as a freshman, then went
wild.
As a sophomore he ran, caught passes,
returned kickoffs and returned punts. He
finished with 1,272 yards rushing, third
among California JC players, and had a
total of 1,897 all-purpose yards. But be
cause he was carrying the ball so much,
he spent little time working on his other
skills.

"At Hancock and in high school I didn't
have to block much," he said. "At Hancock
they just tried to give me the ball a lot. I
mean a lot, a lot."
So how often did you run the ball? "One
game I had, oh, 40-umm ... 47 carries. It
was a school record.
"Here we pass a lot more. I just had to
adjust to blocking, picking up the blitz. . . .
It took a little work to get used to it."
Canley transferred to San Jose State
prior to the 1988 season but was immedi
ately hit by misfortune. He sprained his
ankle during the preseason and had to sit
out the opener. It had healed enough that
he was able to play in the second, third
and fourth games, but then he re-injured
it. He missed the rest of the season and
applied for, and was granted, a redshirt
year.
"When they recruited me, they told me
I could come in right away and play," he
said, "and that's what happened, at least
until I got hurt.... I played three games.
I was only playing 55 percent but I did
alright."
Alright, indeed. In those three games he
had 420 yards of all-purpose running and
two touchdowns. After the injury, he didn't
much like the idea of sitting and watching
from the sidelines, but admits now that it
has made him a better player for this
season.
"I feel it's better to be in there running
it," he said. "But the games I played in
last year I found myself thinking, not react
ing. Now, after going through spring ball
and fall camp, I'm just out there reacting."
With Canley able to run without stopping
to think, defenses better look out. He ran
track both in high school and at Hancock
and said his best times are a 10.6 100-meter
dash and a 4.36 40. With that kind of
speed and good moves to go along with it,
Spartan Coach Claude Gilbert isn't really
surprised at Canley's start.
"He's not necessarily a surprise in terms
of the way he's running the ball," Gilbert
said. "We recruited him out of Hancock
JC believing he had a lot of talent. He
really does. He has excellent speed and
catches the ball very well. He's a complete
player now.
"I think Sheldon offers us the kind of
speed and elusiveness to break open for
the big play more than any other back
we've had here for some time."
But despite Canley's obvious display of
talent, the big story according to much of
the local media has been that Johnson isn't
carrying the offense like he did last year.
But Johnson isn't worried about not get
ting the ball as often and Canley isn't
worried about not getting any attention.
"I feel pretty good about [the offense],"
Johnson said. "Some of the writers don't
but I don't give a damn about them."
Gilbert also feels its ridiculous to worry
about who carries the ball when Canley is
averaging 5.1 yards per rush. "I'm kind of
under the impression that Sheldon Canley
could run for 200 yards and there'd still
be questions about why Johnny Johnson
didn't get 35 carries."
The Stanford coaching staff is just hoping
that situation doesn't play itself out today.

a combination never before done in NCAA
history.
But Canley isn't worried about what the
media thinks; he's worried about helping
his team win.
"I'm just out there doing what I can
do," he said. "I'm out there getting the
job done."

Getting the job done is exactly what Can
ley, who at 5-foot-8 and 193 pounds also
goes by the name the Little General, has
done. Johnson, the fullback, has been used
more as a decoy and as a receiver this year
and the result has been a well-balanced,
explosive Spartan offense. Canley is averag
ing 221.5 yards of all-purpose running
(rushing, receiving and kick returns) per
game and Johnson is averaging 150.5 while
quarterback Matt Veatch is throwing for
296 yards per contest.
"I feel very confident about our offense,
all-around," Canley said. "They have to
concentrate on stopping both Johnny and
me. Now I see what an offense could do."
Before coming to San Jose State, Canley
was the offense. After graduating from
Lompoc High School in Lompoc, Calif.,
Canley went to Allen Hancock Junior
College. He rushed for 485 yards and scored
six touchdowns as a freshman, then went
wild.
As a sophomore he ran, caught passes,
returned kickoffs and returned punts. He
finished with 1,272 yards rushing, third
among California JC players, and had a
total of 1,897 all-purpose yards. But be
cause he was carrying the ball so much,
he spent little time working on his other
skills.

"At Hancock and in high school I didn't
have to block much," he said. "At Hancock
they just tried to give me the ball a lot. I
mean a lot, a lot."
So how often did you run the ball? "One
game I had, oh, 40-umm ... 47 carries. It
was a school record.
"Here we pass a lot more. I just had to
adjust to blocking, picking up the blitz. . . .
It took a little work to get used to it."
Canley transferred to San Jose State
prior to the 1988 season but was immedi
ately hit by misfortune. He sprained his
ankle during the preseason and had to sit
out the opener. It had healed enough that
he was able to play in the second, third
and fourth games, but then he re-injured
it. He missed the rest of the season and
applied for, and was granted, a redshirt
year.
"When they recruited me, they told me
I could come in right away and play," he
said, "and that's what happened, at least
until I got hurt.... I played three games.
I was only playing 55 percent but I did
alright."
Alright, indeed. In those three games he
had 420 yards of all-purpose running and
two touchdowns. After the injury, he didn't
much like the idea of sitting and watching
from the sidelines, but admits now that it
has made him a better player for this
season.
"I feel it's better to be in there running
it," he said. "But the games I played in
last year I found myself thinking, not react
ing. Now, after going through spring ball
and fall camp, I'm just out there reacting."
With Canley able to run without stopping
to think, defenses better look out. He ran
track both in high school and at Hancock
and said his best times are a 10.6 100-meter
dash and a 4.36 40. With that kind of
speed and good moves to go along with it,
Spartan Coach Claude Gilbert isn't really
surprised at Canley's start.
"He's not necessarily a surprise in terms
of the way he's running the ball," Gilbert
said. "We recruited him out of Hancock
JC believing he had a lot of talent. He
really does. He has excellent speed and
catches the ball very well. He's a complete
player now.
"I think Sheldon offers us the kind of
speed and elusiveness to break open for
the big play more than any other back
we've had here for some time."
But despite Canley's obvious display of
talent, the big story according to much of
the local media has been that Johnson isn't
carrying the offense like he did last year.
But Johnson isn't worried about not get
ting the ball as often and Canley isn't
worried about not getting any attention.
"I feel pretty good about [the offense],"
Johnson said. "Some of the writers don't
but I don't give a damn about them."
Gilbert also feels its ridiculous to worry
about who carries the ball when Canley is
averaging 5.1 yards per rush. "I'm kind of
under the impression that Sheldon Canley
could run for 200 yards and there'd still
be questions about why Johnny Johnson
didn't get 35 carries."
The Stanford coaching staff is just hoping
that situation doesn't play itself out today.

After missing most of last season with an ankle injury, tailback Sheldon Canley has
been a big cog in San Jose State's explosive offense.
Sheldon Canley is having a terrific
season.
The San Jose State tailback is currently
third in the nation in all-purpose running.
He is also in the nations top 20 in rushing,
averaging 108 yards per game. He has
caught nine passes in only two games. And
he is averaging 21 yards per kickoff return.
In addition to all these impressive sta
tistics, however, there is something more
amazing, more unbelievable, that Canley
has done this year.
Going into his team's third game of the
season, no one has even heard of him. Such
is the life of Johnny Johnson's running
mate.
You see, Johnson ran for over 1,200 yards
and caught more than 60 passes last year,
