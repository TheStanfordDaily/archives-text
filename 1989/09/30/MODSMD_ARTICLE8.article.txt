# Cardinal dominates series, but...
## 
### David Hirning Editorial staff 
Denny Green and the rest of the
Cardinal players have heard the question
too many times this past week: "So, do
you think there's a chance you might
overlook San Jose State this year?"
The question seems a reasonable one.
Stanford merely plays the third-toughest
schedule in all of college football this year,
and one week from today's game a fairly

good football team from South Bend,
Ind., comes into town.
But, as Green and his players have
reiterated countless times, this game
means too much to the Spartans for
Stanford to take it lightly. And if one looks
back at this historic series, it is when the
Cardinal is at its best that San Jose State
has come up with some shocking
victories.
Stanford overwhelmingly leads
the overall series, 36-8-1, but in
this decade the Cardinal has
struggled to a narrow 5-4 edge.
In fact, the Spartans surprised
Stanford three consecutive years
CBl-'B3), wherL a coach by the
name of Jack El way was the head
man for SJSU.
The history of the rivalry goes
back nearly as far as The Big
Game, but has been neither as
competitive or as consistent. Al
though the first game was played
in 1900, the two schools played
only five games before World War
11, and San Jose State did not
score on Stanford in any of them.
In the inaugural year of the
rivalry, not one, but two games
were played between the then-
Indians of Stanford and some
thing called San Jose Normal (as
opposed to the wilder squad
known as San Jose Bizarre, per
haps). These games were both lop
sided victories for Stanford (35-0
and 24-0), which lost to its own
alumni later that year, 14-0.
The Spartans (Normals?) did
not appear again on the Stanford
schedule until 1933, when even
the more acceptable moniker of
San Jose State did not help and
they were soundly thrashed, 27-0.
San Jose State made the journey
north for two more consecutive
years, but each time failed to score
while giving up large totals to the
Indians.
After 13 more years of regroup
ing and hard practice, San Jose
State returned to the Farm in
grand fashion in 1948, piling up
20 points and losing a close game,
26-20. This began a 10-year run
of games between the two schools,
all held at Stanford.
It is worth noting here that in
fact all 45 games have been played
in Stanford Stadium, due mostly
to the close proximity of the two
schools and the larger capacity of
Stanford's facility.
This series, which ended when
the two teams didn't meet in
1958, went Stanford's way nine
times. The Spartans' first victory
in twelve tries finally came in
1954, as Roy Hiram intercepted
Stanford great John Brodie on the
San Jose State 16-yard line in the
final minutes to preserve a 19-14
triumph.
Apparently sensing the shocking
upset coming, an elderly Stanford
fan had a heart attack in the
stands during the first quarter.
Brodie may have had some med
ical complications as well the
future consensus All-American
was picked off five times. Another
soon-to-be Ail-American for Stan
ford was involved in this one, a
tackle by the name of Paul Wig
gin. It would not be the last time

he would come up short against
the Spartans.
Stanford shrugged off the loss
and went on to post 15 wins in
the next 16 games against San
Jose State. Included in this
stretch were consecutive 68-20
and 63-21 shellackings in 1968
and 1969. In 1970, Stanford again
handled the Spartans easily,
before Heisman Trophy-winner
Jim Plunkett quarterbacked the
Cardinal to a Rose Bowl victory
over Ohio State.
In 1971, Stanford changed its
scheduling and played the Spar
tans the week before Big Game
instead of early in the year as
was (and is) the custom. Big mis
take. The (still) Indians were a
very good team that year, and
when the San Jose State game
rolled around they were 9-1 and
had a second consecutive Rose
Bowl berth locked up.
The Spartans had not beaten
Stanford since 1960, and there
were few who thought this would
be the year they would end their
skein. Las Vegas oddsmakers
refused to quote a pointspread or
take bets on the contest, according
the Nov. 12, 1971 issue of The
Stanford Daily. Although Stanford
Coach John Ralston vehemently
denied it, this one seemed in the
bag.
But the Spartans won, 13-12.
Stanford placekicker Rod Garcia,
who led the nation with 14 field
goals entering the game, missed
all five of his attempts. His last
flub came with 13 seconds left,
and as the chip-shot 20-yarder was
carried wide by swirling winds,
the Spartans had won the Santa
Clara County Championship.
Stanford did bounce back to
defeat Michigan in the Rose Bowl
by an identical score of 13-12 that
year, but the loss will probably
never be forgotten by Cardinal
faithful. Stanford outgained the
Spartans by an estimated (accord
ing to a disgusted Ralston) 320
yards. And the Cardinal could not
recover in time for the California
game, dropping their first Pacific
10 Conference game of the season,
22-14.
San Jose State apparently
rallied from this win, and tied
Stanford in 1974 before beating
them in a 36-34 thriller in 1975.
The following year, Stanford and
quarterback Guy Benjamin had to
come back from a 23-14 deficit
with two TDs in the final quarter
to win 28-23.
In 1977, a freshman running
back named Darrin Nelson broke
loose against the Spartans,
gaining 211 yards on only 20
carries. Nelson not only set a new
single-game rushing mark for
Stanford, but he also established
a new record for most yards rush
ing in one season. (The former
mark stood until last season, when
Jon Volpe gained 220 yards on

the ground against Washington.)
Stanford won three more times
to run its win streak in the series
to five. Stanford had hired Wig
gin, the former All-American
tackle, as head coach in 1980. San
Jose State was coached by Jack
Elway, who at the time was best
known as the father of the Stan

ford quarterback, John Elway.
What followed in the next three
seasons was almost good enough
to make a daytime television soap
opera ("All My Children"?). Elway
the elder beat Elway the younger
twice, 28-6 in 1981 and 35-31 in
1982. The latter loss, along with
the infamous "The Play" versus

California, deprived John Elway
of a winning record (and maybe
even the Heisman) his senior year.
And when San Jose State did
it once more for good measure in
1983 (23-10), the combination of
the three wins may have cost Wig

gin his W>. When Stanford went
looking for a new coach, they
didn't look any farther than the
man who had shown a penchant
for beating them so regularly.
Jack Elway lasted five seasons
as Stanford's coach, posting a very
respectable 4-1 mark against the
Spartans. The Cardinal pulled out
a narrow victory in Elway's first
season, 28-27, and followed with
two more wins.
But, after a bowl season in 1986

and with a Heisman Trophy can
didate (Brad Muster) at running
back for Stanford, the San Jose
State Jinx came back in 1987.
The Spartans staged a late-game
rally and pulled off the upset, 24-
17, sending Stanford spinning to
an 0-4 start and a 5-6 season.
As Denny Green enters his first
year as coach of Stanford's foot
ball team, he need only look at
history to find reasons not to
overlook the Spartans. And should
the unexpected occur and San
Jose State defeat the Cardinal, he
can look to Elway, Wiggin, and
Ralston for solace and commisera
tion as deep as the rivalry is long.
