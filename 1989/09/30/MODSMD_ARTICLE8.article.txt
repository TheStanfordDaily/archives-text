# Cardinal dominates series, but...
## 
### David Hirning Editorial staff 
Denny Green and the rest of the
Cardinal players have heard the question
too many times this past week: "So, do
you think there's a chance you might
overlook San Jose State this year?"
The question seems a reasonable one.
Stanford merely plays the third-toughest
schedule in all of college football this year,
and one week from today's game a fairly

good football team from South Bend,
Ind., comes into town.
But, as Green and his players have
reiterated countless times, this game
means too much to the Spartans for
Stanford to take it lightly. And if one looks
back at this historic series, it is when the
Cardinal is at its best that San Jose State
has come up with some shocking
victories.
