## Wide receiver finding success far from home 
### Rob Johnstone 
Jon Pinckney could have played
his college football close to home
at Penn State, or he could have
gone to play for perennial national
power Michigan. Luckily for the
Cardinal, however, he chose to
travel nearly 3,000 miles from
home to come to the West Coast
and play for Stanford.
The sophomore wide receiver is
currently emerging as one of the
top receivers in the Pacific 10
Conference. Pinckney played his
football at Bethelehem High
School in Bethlehem, Penn.,
where he was heavily recruited
by many of the major college foot
ball powers, and was wooed per
sonally by Joe Paterno, the
legendary coach at Penn State.
Despite this, however, Pinckney
decided to come to Stanford and
the West Coast, citing a number
of reasons. He liked the Cardinal's
strong passing attack, and the fact
that Stanford plays in one of the
toughest conferences in the coun
try. On his recruiting trip to Stan
ford he was impressed by the
campus atmosphere, and, he ad
mits, California's good weather
didn't hurt either.
Pinckney started last week at
wide receiver for the Cardinal, but
that really isn't too important to
him, as he quickly points out. In

stead, he is dedicated to the team
concept and feels it is much more
important to just get some playing
time and be able to contribute.
"I'd rather be in there on a crucial
third and eight than on the first
play of the game," he said.
Pinckney's most memorable col
lege reception to date would have
to be his 75-yard TD reception
last year in the waning minutes
of the Oregon State game. With
Stanford trailing by four points,
Pinckney sprinted by the man cov
erage and hauled in a long one
from Jason Palumbis, putting
Stanford ahead by three and
causing bedlam in Stanford Sta
dium.
Unfortunately for Pinckney and
the Cardinal, Oregon State came
back to kick a field goal for a
20-20 tie and steal the redshirt
freshman's spotlight. But the
result didn't take away from
Pinckney's memorable contribu
tion. When asked about his in
creasing emergence as a top
Pac-10 receiver and the pressure
that this entails, Pinckney says
that he really doesn't compare
himself with other receivers and
that outside pressure doesn't
bother him at all.
"The most pressure I feel comes
from within myself," he said, "the
drive to continually improve and
succeed."

He also points out that with
the strong receiving corps of the
Cardinal (Walter Batson, Ed
McCaffrey, Chris Walsh and
others catch passes with
Pinckney), there may be enough
pressure just to be one of the top
receivers on his own team. "The
friendly competition between the
receivers drives you to do better
and improve yourself," he ob
served.
"You can't slack off when you
have such a talented receiving
corps. We may not have one guy
getting 70 catches a year, but in
the long run, we'll be better off."
When asked about the team's
chances for the rest of this season,
Pinckney is decidedly optimistic.
"The last seven minutes of the
Oregon game isn't even the best
we can play," he claimed. "Things
are just beginning to come to
gether. With a new offense, and
a new coach, it was a little difficult
at first. But you can see it all
coming together now on the prac
tice field. We've got some strong
games ahead of us."
Pinckney also stated that the
team is not looking past today's
San Jose State game to the much
heralded showdown with No. 1
Notre Dame next Saturday. "With
San Jose's big offense, we need to

wide receivers the past two seasons.
worry about them first," he said.
Indeed, San Jose has scored over
60 points in their two games,
while Stanford has scored just 37
in its three contests.
It would be easy for Pinckney
and the rest of the Cardinal of
fense to use injuries to top players
Jon Volpe, Charlie Young, and
Brian Johnson as a convenient ex
cuse for not putting more points
on the board. Instead, he
downplays the importance of
these missing leaders.

"We're not going to go out there
and roll over," he said. "Whoever
is starting a particular week is
treated as he should be, a starter.
Just look at the job Jay Jay (Las
ley) did last week."
This week even Lasley is hurt,
and Stanford may go to the air
early and often. As Pinckney
noted, "(The Spartans) play a
blitzing defense, which often
leaves the receivers in one-on-one
situations. So the receivers will
have to do well, or it could be a
long day."
Cardinal fans should be very
glad that this young man came
west two years ago to play for
Stanford.

that Stanford plays in one of the
toughest conferences in the coun
try. On his recruiting trip to Stan
ford he was impressed by the
campus atmosphere, and, he ad
mits, California's good weather
didn't hurt either.
Pinckney started last week at
wide receiver for the Cardinal, but
that really isn't too important to
him, as he quickly points out. In

stead, he is dedicated to the team
concept and feels it is much more
important to just get some playing
time and be able to contribute.
"I'd rather be in there on a crucial
third and eight than on the first
play of the game," he said.
Pinckney's most memorable col
lege reception to date would have
to be his 75-yard TD reception
last year in the waning minutes
of the Oregon State game. With
Stanford trailing by four points,
Pinckney sprinted by the man cov
erage and hauled in a long one
from Jason Palumbis, putting
Stanford ahead by three and
causing bedlam in Stanford Sta
dium.
Unfortunately for Pinckney and
the Cardinal, Oregon State came
back to kick a field goal for a
20-20 tie and steal the redshirt
freshman's spotlight. But the
result didn't take away from
Pinckney's memorable contribu
tion. When asked about his in
creasing emergence as a top
Pac-10 receiver and the pressure
that this entails, Pinckney says
that he really doesn't compare
himself with other receivers and
that outside pressure doesn't
bother him at all.
"The most pressure I feel comes
from within myself," he said, "the
drive to continually improve and
succeed."

He also points out that with
the strong receiving corps of the
Cardinal (Walter Batson, Ed
McCaffrey, Chris Walsh and
others catch passes with
Pinckney), there may be enough
pressure just to be one of the top
receivers on his own team. "The
friendly competition between the
receivers drives you to do better
and improve yourself," he ob
served.
"You can't slack off when you
have such a talented receiving
corps. We may not have one guy
getting 70 catches a year, but in
the long run, we'll be better off."
When asked about the team's
chances for the rest of this season,
Pinckney is decidedly optimistic.
"The last seven minutes of the
Oregon game isn't even the best
we can play," he claimed. "Things
are just beginning to come to
gether. With a new offense, and
a new coach, it was a little difficult
at first. But you can see it all
coming together now on the prac
tice field. We've got some strong
games ahead of us."
Pinckney also stated that the
team is not looking past today's
San Jose State game to the much
heralded showdown with No. 1
Notre Dame next Saturday. "With
San Jose's big offense, we need to

worry about them first," he said.
Indeed, San Jose has scored over
60 points in their two games,
while Stanford has scored just 37
in its three contests.
It would be easy for Pinckney
and the rest of the Cardinal of
fense to use injuries to top players
Jon Volpe, Charlie Young, and
Brian Johnson as a convenient ex
cuse for not putting more points
on the board. Instead, he
downplays the importance of
these missing leaders.

"We're not going to go out there
and roll over," he said. "Whoever
is starting a particular week is
treated as he should be, a starter.
Just look at the job Jay Jay (Las
ley) did last week."
This week even Lasley is hurt,
and Stanford may go to the air
early and often. As Pinckney
noted, "(The Spartans) play a
blitzing defense, which often
leaves the receivers in one-on-one
situations. So the receivers will
have to do well, or it could be a
long day."
Cardinal fans should be very
glad that this young man came
west two years ago to play for
Stanford.
Jon Pinckney could have played
his college football close to home
at Penn State, or he could have
gone to play for perennial national
power Michigan. Luckily for the
Cardinal, however, he chose to
travel nearly 3,000 miles from
home to come to the West Coast
and play for Stanford.
The sophomore wide receiver is
currently emerging as one of the
top receivers in the Pacific 10
Conference. Pinckney played his
football at Bethelehem High
School in Bethlehem, Penn.,
where he was heavily recruited
by many of the major college foot
ball powers, and was wooed per
sonally by Joe Paterno, the
legendary coach at Penn State.
Despite this, however, Pinckney
decided to come to Stanford and
the West Coast, citing a number
of reasons. He liked the Cardinal's
strong passing attack, and the fact
that Stanford plays in one of the
toughest conferences in the coun
try. On his recruiting trip to Stan
ford he was impressed by the
campus atmosphere, and, he ad
