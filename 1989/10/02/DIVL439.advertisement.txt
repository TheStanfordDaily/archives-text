STUDENT LOANS?
Because we do more than just talk about great service.
Other banks may claim to have quick service and a complete line of education loan programs. But compare
their products and services to ours and you'll see why we re the lender more California students choose.
Service

unnecessary confusion. The result - fast, professional service by a concerned and caring staff.
Loan Alternatives
One sure way to measure a bank's commitment to education finance is to look at the number of different loan
programs they offer.
Educational Funding Services offers not only the Stafford, SLS and PLUS loans...but MEDLOANS a loan program for
allopathic medical students...as well as CONSERN a loan program for families with higher incomes.
