# Beyond childhood horizons
## Media focuses attention on homeless frosh 
### Janine De Fao Staff writer 
Freshman Lupe Vasquez con
sidered her childhood dreams
"exaggerated." She used to wish
that she had a house like those
of her classmates, or new
clothes. Now, she has more than
she ever could have imagined.
Vasquez, who until two weeks
ago was homeless, has not only
found a home at Stanford but
has received national media at
tention in the process.
It is likely that Vasquez is
one of the only students in the
country to attend a mcyor uni
versity after being homeless.
Vasquez told her story to a
group of newspaper and televi
sion reporters Friday morning
outside Elliott Program Center.
The press conference was called
after Vasquez was inundated
last week by calls and visits from
reporters, interfering with her
work.
Vasquez told reporters, "I
don't want all this attention that
I'm getting. It doesn't seem like
I deserve it. I just want to be
an ordinary Stanford student."
However, Vasquez is not an
average student. In fact, ABC
News found her so extraordi
nary that it featured her Friday
as its "Person of the Week" on
World News Tonight.
Born in Mexico, Vasquez was
living in a homeless shelter in
Oxnard, Calif., near Los An
geles, before she moved into her
freshman dorm. Her family
moved to the shelter a year ago
after being evicted from their
small apartment when they
could not pay the rent.
At the shelter, Vasquez, her
mother, stepfather and four
siblings shared one room con
taining beds and a table. Though
her parents spoke no English,
Vasquez learned the language
in school and now speaks it
fluently.
After school, Vasquez would

do her homework on her bed
while fighting the distractions
of her 3, 4, and 5-year-old
siblings. However, Vasquez con
siders her family lucky to have
found the shelter. If not, they
may have ended up living in a
car.
"It didn't get to that point,"
she said. "It would have if we
hadn't found the shelter. The
shelter was the best place I ever
lived in. Roomwise, it was the
biggest."
For much of her life, her fam
ily moved often so that her par
ents, itinerant farm workers,
could follow the crops. Cur
rently, her stepfather is a janitor
at the shelter.
Although the family did not
have a permanent home,
Vasquez was always able to stay
in school.

"I didn't have to leave school
to work or I wouldn't be here,"
she said.
Vasquez said that she often
questioned her situation but
never gave up.
"I kept asking myself, 'Why?
Why me?' But I knew that I
had to accept it. I told myself,
'I'm going to get out of here,' "
she said.
Vasquez attributed her suc
cess in overcoming her situation
both to her hard work and to
her mother.
"My mother has been the best
motivating factor in my life. All
I can remember, even before
kindergarten, is that she just
said, 'Try your best.' She never
pressured me," she said.
Vasquez said that she always

conference.
got good grades and always
wanted to go to college.
"I just didn't think it would be
Stanford. I applied just to see if
I would get in. I was really over
whelmed," she said. Vasquez also
applied to five other schools, in
cluding UCLA and UC-Berkeley,
and gained admission to all of
them.
In high school, another motivat
ing factor was Vasquez's drive to
prove to her teachers that she
could do well because she felt dis
criminated against as a poor
Hispanic.
"I never liked my teachers. I
thought they were out to get me
and I wanted to prove to them
that I could get good grades," she
said. "Before senior year I never
spoke to any of my teachers, then
I found out that they just wanted
to help me."
"Senior year I realized, 'I am
going to go further. I am going

to progress.' "
Now that Vasquez has proven
that her situation can be over
come, she would like to be a role
model for other poor or homeless
students, especially those in the
Hispanic community.
"Being in the situation I've been
in, I've seen so many sad cases
of kids who have the capabilities
and don't use them," she said.
She added that she can already
see a change in the attitude of
her ninth-grade sister. "She was
really rebellious, but now she has
dreams and goals and wants to
go to college," Vasquez said.
Vasquez is able to attend Stan
ford because of generous financial
aid. She said that she is receiving
$10,000 from the University,
$7,000 from the federal govern
ment, $3,000 in private scholar
ships and a $1,000 loan.
Although her financial situation
is drastically different from many
students, Vasquez doesn't think
it separates her from them.
"So far I've really fit in. I don't
think I'm the only student from
a background like mine," she said.

Vasquez requested to live in
Ujamaa House, the black theme
house, so that she can learn about
people from different cultures.
She said that the food is "okay,"
but that the dorm is just as loud
as where she used to live.
She is planning on meyoring in
engineering because she has "al
ways been good in math and sci
ence," but she doesn't "want to
close [her] mind to any field."
"I might also want to get in
volved in a political or Hispanic
group, but not yet," Vasquez said.
She also expressed interest in
working with Hispanic students
in a tutoring program.
"I would like [to work with
children from that background!
because I can relate to them. I
know where they're coming
from," she said.
She said that the message she
would like to give them is "to
believe in yourself. That's what
really kept me going."
Vasquez said that after gradu
ation, "The first thing I plan to
do is help my mother out. My
family is my first priority."

close [her] mind to any field."
"I might also want to get in
volved in a political or Hispanic
group, but not yet," Vasquez said.
She also expressed interest in
working with Hispanic students
in a tutoring program.
"I would like [to work with
children from that background!
because I can relate to them. I
know where they're coming
from," she said.
She said that the message she
would like to give them is "to
believe in yourself. That's what
really kept me going."
Vasquez said that after gradu
ation, "The first thing I plan to
do is help my mother out. My
family is my first priority."
Freshman Lupe Vasquez con
sidered her childhood dreams
"exaggerated." She used to wish
that she had a house like those
of her classmates, or new
clothes. Now, she has more than
she ever could have imagined.
Vasquez, who until two weeks
ago was homeless, has not only
found a home at Stanford but
has received national media at
tention in the process.
It is likely that Vasquez is
one of the only students in the
country to attend a mcyor uni
versity after being homeless.
Vasquez told her story to a
group of newspaper and televi
sion reporters Friday morning
outside Elliott Program Center.
The press conference was called
after Vasquez was inundated
last week by calls and visits from
reporters, interfering with her
work.
Vasquez told reporters, "I
don't want all this attention that
I'm getting. It doesn't seem like
I deserve it. I just want to be
an ordinary Stanford student."
However, Vasquez is not an
average student. In fact, ABC
News found her so extraordi
nary that it featured her Friday
as its "Person of the Week" on
World News Tonight.
Born in Mexico, Vasquez was
living in a homeless shelter in
Oxnard, Calif., near Los An
geles, before she moved into her
freshman dorm. Her family
moved to the shelter a year ago
after being evicted from their
small apartment when they
could not pay the rent.
At the shelter, Vasquez, her
mother, stepfather and four
siblings shared one room con
taining beds and a table. Though
her parents spoke no English,
Vasquez learned the language
in school and now speaks it
fluently.
After school, Vasquez would

do her homework on her bed
while fighting the distractions
of her 3, 4, and 5-year-old
siblings. However, Vasquez con
siders her family lucky to have
found the shelter. If not, they
may have ended up living in a
car.
"It didn't get to that point,"
she said. "It would have if we
hadn't found the shelter. The
shelter was the best place I ever
lived in. Roomwise, it was the
biggest."
For much of her life, her fam
ily moved often so that her par
ents, itinerant farm workers,
could follow the crops. Cur
rently, her stepfather is a janitor
at the shelter.
Although the family did not
have a permanent home,
Vasquez was always able to stay
in school.

"I didn't have to leave school
to work or I wouldn't be here,"
she said.
Vasquez said that she often
questioned her situation but
never gave up.
"I kept asking myself, 'Why?
Why me?' But I knew that I
had to accept it. I told myself,
'I'm going to get out of here,' "
she said.
Vasquez attributed her suc
cess in overcoming her situation
both to her hard work and to
her mother.
"My mother has been the best
motivating factor in my life. All
I can remember, even before
kindergarten, is that she just
said, 'Try your best.' She never
pressured me," she said.
Vasquez said that she always

conference.
got good grades and always
wanted to go to college.
"I just didn't think it would be
Stanford. I applied just to see if
I would get in. I was really over
whelmed," she said. Vasquez also
applied to five other schools, in
cluding UCLA and UC-Berkeley,
and gained admission to all of
them.
In high school, another motivat
ing factor was Vasquez's drive to
prove to her teachers that she
could do well because she felt dis
criminated against as a poor
Hispanic.
"I never liked my teachers. I
thought they were out to get me
and I wanted to prove to them
that I could get good grades," she
said. "Before senior year I never
spoke to any of my teachers, then
I found out that they just wanted
to help me."
"Senior year I realized, 'I am
going to go further. I am going

to progress.' "
Now that Vasquez has proven
that her situation can be over
come, she would like to be a role
model for other poor or homeless
students, especially those in the
Hispanic community.
"Being in the situation I've been
in, I've seen so many sad cases
of kids who have the capabilities
and don't use them," she said.
She added that she can already
see a change in the attitude of
her ninth-grade sister. "She was
really rebellious, but now she has
dreams and goals and wants to
go to college," Vasquez said.
Vasquez is able to attend Stan
ford because of generous financial
aid. She said that she is receiving
$10,000 from the University,
$7,000 from the federal govern
ment, $3,000 in private scholar
ships and a $1,000 loan.
Although her financial situation
is drastically different from many
students, Vasquez doesn't think
it separates her from them.
"So far I've really fit in. I don't
think I'm the only student from
a background like mine," she said.

Vasquez requested to live in
Ujamaa House, the black theme
house, so that she can learn about
people from different cultures.
She said that the food is "okay,"
but that the dorm is just as loud
as where she used to live.
She is planning on meyoring in
engineering because she has "al
ways been good in math and sci
ence," but she doesn't "want to
close [her] mind to any field."
"I might also want to get in
