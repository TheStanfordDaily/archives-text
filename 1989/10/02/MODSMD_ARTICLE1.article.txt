# Beyond childhood horizons
## Media focuses attention on homeless frosh 
### Janine De Fao Staff writer 
Freshman Lupe Vasquez con
sidered her childhood dreams
"exaggerated." She used to wish
that she had a house like those
of her classmates, or new
clothes. Now, she has more than
she ever could have imagined.
Vasquez, who until two weeks
ago was homeless, has not only
found a home at Stanford but
has received national media at
tention in the process.
It is likely that Vasquez is
one of the only students in the
country to attend a mcyor uni
versity after being homeless.
Vasquez told her story to a
group of newspaper and televi
sion reporters Friday morning
outside Elliott Program Center.
The press conference was called
after Vasquez was inundated
last week by calls and visits from
reporters, interfering with her
work.
Vasquez told reporters, "I
don't want all this attention that
I'm getting. It doesn't seem like
I deserve it. I just want to be
an ordinary Stanford student."
However, Vasquez is not an
average student. In fact, ABC
News found her so extraordi
nary that it featured her Friday
as its "Person of the Week" on
World News Tonight.
Born in Mexico, Vasquez was
living in a homeless shelter in
Oxnard, Calif., near Los An
geles, before she moved into her
freshman dorm. Her family
moved to the shelter a year ago
after being evicted from their
small apartment when they
could not pay the rent.
At the shelter, Vasquez, her
mother, stepfather and four
siblings shared one room con
taining beds and a table. Though
her parents spoke no English,
Vasquez learned the language
in school and now speaks it
fluently.
After school, Vasquez would

do her homework on her bed
while fighting the distractions
of her 3, 4, and 5-year-old
siblings. However, Vasquez con
siders her family lucky to have
found the shelter. If not, they
may have ended up living in a
car.
"It didn't get to that point,"
she said. "It would have if we
hadn't found the shelter. The
shelter was the best place I ever
lived in. Roomwise, it was the
biggest."
For much of her life, her fam
ily moved often so that her par
ents, itinerant farm workers,
could follow the crops. Cur
rently, her stepfather is a janitor
at the shelter.
Although the family did not
have a permanent home,
Vasquez was always able to stay
in school.

"I didn't have to leave school
to work or I wouldn't be here,"
she said.
Vasquez said that she often
questioned her situation but
never gave up.
"I kept asking myself, 'Why?
Why me?' But I knew that I
had to accept it. I told myself,
'I'm going to get out of here,' "
she said.
Vasquez attributed her suc
cess in overcoming her situation
both to her hard work and to
her mother.
"My mother has been the best
motivating factor in my life. All
I can remember, even before
kindergarten, is that she just
said, 'Try your best.' She never
pressured me," she said.
Vasquez said that she always
