Duke bans Orientation parties
Fraternities, sororities and other living groups
at Duke University began the year under a two
week moratorium on open parties involving al
cohol. The ban followed recommendations made
by the Alcohol Policy Review Committee formed
last year to examine alcohol policy at the Uni
versity.
Living group parties were closed to non
members during Orientation (August 22-27) and
during the first two weeks of the semester, until
Sept. 10.
According to Dean for Student Life Suzanne
Wasiolek, the administration did not want the
emphasis at the beginning of the school year to
be on drinking. Rather, students had the oppor
tunity to establish their own social patterns, hope
fully free of the alcohol traditionally associated
with open parties, she said.
Freshmen should not have to "deal with (al
cohol) or deal with the pressure," said Paul Bum
balough, assistant dean for student life.

SJSU senate boots members
Tired of chronic attendance problems within
its ranks, the Associated Students at San Jose
State dismissed Director of Student Services
Kevin Hejnal after he was absent from the board's
past three meetings.
Hejnal and Director of Communications Susie
Laymon both were absent from the Sept. 15
meeting and thus became eligible for removal.
Laymon had already submitted her resignation
to Associated Students President Scott San
tandrea.
The meeting was also significant because all
other directors were present for the first time
this semester and because the removal action

appears to end a chronic absentee problem that
has stifled the board's ability to operate.
Board members may be removed from office
if they are absent from three or more consecutive
meetings, or if they miss four meetings in a
semester, according to the rules and procedures
followed by the body.
Because three directors had already missed two
consecutive meetings, discussion of their possible
removal was placed on the agenda for the board
meeting.
The third director on the edge made the meet

TKE pilot pledge elimination
National Tau Kappa Epsilon fraternity leaders
are experimenting with the idea of eliminating
"pledging."
But local fraternity members see the change
as a poor idea and doubt it will sweep the Greek
system.
"I don't see any point to it. I think they'll
have a hard time getting it (the proposal)
through," said Washington State TKE President
Kraig Enyard.
The change, voted on by delegates from 280
chapters at an August convention in Indianapolis,
Ind., would eliminate the first-semester pledge
period from the initiation process by Sept. 1,
1991.
"This implementation time will provide us with
an opportunity to fine-tune the new program
and educate our chapters in its use," said T.J.
Smith, executive vice president and chief execu
tive officer of national TKE.
Instead of going through a pledge period, new
members would be initiated within the first two
weeks of joining the fraternity.
