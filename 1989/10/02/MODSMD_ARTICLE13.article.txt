MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) â€”
Nicaraguans began registering
yesterday to vote in February's
national elections as American
congressmen and other observers
watched for evidence of fraud.
Nearly 5,000 booths nationwide
were opened to register the esti
mated 1.9 million voters.
President Daniel Ortega was the
first in line at the booth serving
his area, an upper-class neighbor
hood in centred Managua. Dressed
in his military uniform, Ortega
arrived with his wife, Rosario
Murillo, and several of their
children.
Speaking to reporters, Ortega
called on all Nicaraguans to reg
ister "so there will be massive
participation" in the balloting
Feb. 25 for president, vice presi
dent, a new legislature and
mayors.
Ortega advanced the date of
1991 elections as part of a peace
accord he and four other Central
American presidents signed in Au
gust. He pledged opposition can
didates could campaign without
harassment and with a free press,

and that the balloting would be
fair.
As part of the pact, the five
presidents agreed to disband the
U.S.-supported rebels, known as
Contras, by Dec. 8. Most of the
Contras are based across the bor
der in Honduras.
In a news release the Defense
Ministry said a group of rebels
attacked a military patrol about
110 miles north of Managua Sat
urday. The release, issued Sunday,
said one soldier and two Contras
were killed in the gun battle.
Ortega and Vice President Ser
gio Ramirez are seeking re
election on the ticket of the ruling
leftist Sandinista National Liber
ation Front. Both were elected in
1984.
There were some irregularities
at Ortega's booth yesterday. It
opened an hour late at 8 a.m., the
representative of the National Op
position Union coalition on the
board did not show up and his
deputy arrived without any iden
tification. The deputy was sent
home to get it but hours later had
not returned.

Violeta Barrios de Chamorro,
presidential candidate of the op
position alliance and publisher of
the newsaper La Prensa, regis
tered at a booth in her neighbor
hood alter attending Mass.
Joao Baena Soares, general sec
retary of the Organization of
American States, a team from the
United Nations and four U.S. con
gressmen were among the foreign
ers observing the registration
process.
"I see that people are
motivated, and that there's a great
interest in registering," Baena
told reporters after visiting 11
registration booths in Leon, 56
miles northwest of Managua and
Nicaragua's second largest city.
Rep. David Drier, R-Calif.,
Howard Coble, R-N.C., Cass
Balenger, R-N.C., and Porter
Goss, R-Fla., were among those
visiting the booths.
Heavy rain in most of the coun
try made many roads muddy,
making access to the booths dif
ficult in rural areas.
In the 1984 elections, Ortega
showed up to register without any
identification.
