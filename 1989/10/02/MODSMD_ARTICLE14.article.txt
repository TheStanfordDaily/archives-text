# Mexican president visits U.S. to discuss relations, sign accords

### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Mexican Pres
ident Carlos Salinas de Gortari arrived
here yesterday on an official visit that
the Bush administration hopes will rein
force the steady improvement in U.S.-
Mexican relations. Seven agreements are
expected to be signed during Salinas' stay.
President Bush, who has met with
Salinas twice previously, invited the
Mexican leader to his retreat at Camp
David for a family dinner last night. A
more formal meeting is planned for the
White House tomorrow.
The agreements they were to sign dur
ing the visit were symbolic of increased
U.S.-Mexican cooperation since Bush and
Salinas assumed the presidency of their
respective countries within a few weeks
of each other less than a year ago.
The pacts cover such issues as trade,
investment, the environment, tourism
and law enforcement, according to U.S.

officials.
Officials from both sides seemed
relieved that the spirit of hostility which
characterized cross-border relations dur
ing the Reagan administration has largely
disappeared.
U.S. officials, who briefed reporters
Friday on the condition they not be iden
tified by name, said Mexican authorities
have been very cooperative in attempting
to regulate the flow of undocumented
aliens from Central America over the past
six months.
Even more encouraging to the admin
istration has been evidence of a serious
Mexican effort to curb drug smuggling.
"There's a msyor national commitment
by the Salinas administration to drug
interdiction," one U.S. official told
reporters. He added that 25 percent of
Mexico's armed forces work on drug
eradication and interdiction.

Twenty-five percent of
Mexico's armed forces
work on drug eradica
tion and interdiction.

During a visit to Mexico in August,
Secretary of State James A. Baker 111
hailed Salinas' economic policies as "bold
and farsighted."
U.S. officials believe that Mexico's pro
gram of tax reform, encouraging foreign
investment and lowering trade barriers
could serve as a model for other nations
In July, Mexico reached an agreement
with commercial banks that provides for,
among other things, a reduction in the

country's debt servicing obligations. Pay
ments on the country's $107 billion
foreign debt have contributed to a sharp
decline in living standards over the past
seven years.
One official who briefed reporters Fri
day noted that a year ago there were
widespread predictions of political tur
moil and economic catastrophe in Mexico.
"To President Salinas' great credit, he
has, I think, surprised all of the skeptics
with his performance politically and eco
nomically. And what he is doing with the
Mexican economy is, in the history of
that country, revolutionary," the official
said.
U.S.-Mexican tensions also have eased
because both countries are pursuing far
less ideological policies in Central
America.
Mexico disagreed profoundly with the
Reagan administration's military involve

ment in Central America. During that
same period, State Department officials
were embittered by Mexico's efforts to
undercut American policy toward that
region.
With officials known more for prag
matism than ideological militancy in
charge now in both countries, the rela
tionship between the respective foreign
ministries is better than at any time in
years.
Still, disagreements remain. As an ex
ample, Mexico opposed U.S. efforts in
the Organization of American States this
past summer for decisive action against
Panamanian leader Manuel Antonio Nor
iega.
In contrast to the U.S. policy of not
recognizing Panama's government,
Mexico is one of the few Latin American
countries which still has an ambassador
accredited in Panama.
