WASHINGTON (AP) - Three members
of the Tiananmen Square democracy move
ment who fled China after the crackdown
last summer led about 3,500 demonstrators
Sunday to protest the 40th anniversary of
communist rule in their homeland.
The marchers walked in a downpour
from the Lincoln Memorial to the Chinese
Embassy to protest the violent clampdown
on the student democracy movement in
Beijing's Tiananmen Square. Nearly 2,000
other marchers demonstrated in Los An
geles and San Francisco.
"The Chinese government must stop kil
ling," said Shen Tong, one of the three
pro-democracy leaders. "We appeal to
peace-loving people all over the world to
stand together with us and fight for a
China in which basic freedoms are guar
anteed."
Another of the three emigres, Wu'er
Kaxi, told a small news conference outside
the Chinese Embassy that "the attitude of
the American people as well as that of
Congress has been clear since the events"
of the crackdown. Asked whether he had
any specific criticisms or demands of the
Bush administration, he replied, "No com
ment."
Shen, Wu'er and the third leader, Liu
Yan, were in Washington for a fast and
protest. Police estimated the crowd of mar
chers at 3,500.
Other protests were planned in Chicago,
Houston, Los Angeles, Minneapolis, San
Francisco, New York, Bonn, Hong Kong
and Paris, with participation at U.S. uni
versities and colleges.
In San Francisco, 1,200 people shouted

and waved signs outside the Chinese con
sulate in a noisy but peaceful protest
against National Day, the celebration of
the 40th anniversary of the People's Re
public of China.
Protesters during the three-hour dem
onstration said four decades of communism
had been a failure for China and blasted
the Chinese government's repression of the
pro-democracy movement.
Many of the signs pledged to remember
the "martyrs" of democracy, hundreds of
students who were killed when troops fired
on Bering's Tiananmen Square last June.
"If you see your people killed in such a
brutal way, you will come here," one
woman said outside the consulate, whose
doors remained closed.
Police reported no arrests or problems
because of the protests.
In Los Angeles, some 700 people gathered
peacefully outside the Chinese consulate
downtown waving human rights signs,
singing peace songs and cheering speeches
by university students, Christian cler
gyman and community leaders.
The crowd, mainly Chinese natives,
formed a semicircle on the street in front
of a military tank, two tents, a 5-foot
Goddess of Liberty statue and a gray coffin,
on which dozens of spectators placed white
flowers.
The Joint Committee of Chinese Stu
dents and Scholars sponsored the two-hour
protest which included a re-enactment of
the student massacre and a mock trial.
Ting Huang, a computer engineer and
native Chinese, donned a T-shirt with a
picture of Deng Xiaoping, the 85-year-old
senior leader in China.
