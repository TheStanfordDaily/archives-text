Noriega cages opposition
PANAMA CITY (AP) — Ricardo Arias
Calderon, a former opposition candi
date for vice president, and eight sup
porters were aiTested Sunday by the
Panamanian police, an opposition co
alition said.
The Civic Democratic Opposition
Alliance said in a news release that
Arias and eight other members of his
Christian Democratic Party were ar
rested while they toured the country
side campaigning for the ouster of
Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, the
country's military chief who controls
the government.
ADOC, as the opposition coalition
is known by its Spanish initials, said
the nine were arrested in the western
province of Veraguas on orders of the
provincial attorney general for alleged
subversive activities.
"We have received news indicating
that Dr. Arias Calderon will be in
dicted during the night on charges of
inciting civil disobendience, subversive
activities and public disorder, as well
as acting against the economic integ
rity of the state," the news release
said.
It was signed by Guillermo Cochez
and Arellano Lennox, two Christian
Democratic Party leaders. The party
is a member ADOC.
Arias Calderon ran as one of two
opposition vice presidential candidates

in the May 7 national elections on a
ticket led by presidential candidate
Guillermo Endara. The government
annulled the returns, which showed
the opposition winning by a landslide.
Sex 'researchers' on trial
EUGENE, Ore. (AP) — A physician
and his wife face prostitution-related
charges for allegedly conducting a
phony research project that included
a sex tour of West Coast college cam
puses.
Rodney Thorp Wood, 60, of South
Hampton, N.Y., was scheduled to ap
pear in court this week on a charge
of promoting prostitution; his wife,
Nancy Steffen Wood, 44, was charged
with prostitution, Eugene police Sgt.
Rick Gilliam said last week.
Police say Rodney Wood
photographed encounters between his
wife and young men.
A 19-year-old University of Oregon
student who allegedly participated in
a "research" session with the Woods
is also charged with prostitution.
The couple visited the Oregon
campus two weeks ago, telling male
students they were "evaluating the
sexual potential of the mature female"
and would pay participants for taking
part in research sessions, Gilliam said.
Nancy Wood distributed "letters of
introduction" explaining the supposed

research project to young men on
campus, Gilliam said. Men were
promised $10 for each orgasm either
participant had during the session, he
said.
Police were tipped by two students
and an officer, posing as a student,
contacted the couple at their hotel.
They were charged Sept. 16.
Police later found a list of schools
including Oregon State University,
the University of Washington, the
University of Victoria, British Colum
bia, and the University of California
at Berkeley, Gilliam said.
"They were traveling the West
Coast with major universities on their
itinerary," Gilliam said. "As I under
stand from a background check in
New York, they're real affluent and
giving away this kind of money isn't
going to hurt them any."
"Because there was money ex
changed for a sexual act, it was pros
titution," Gilliam said. Police believe
the couple were not doing sex research
for an Oxford University project, as
they claimed, but were exercising their
own interests, he said.
The charge of promoting prostitu
tion, a felony, carries a maximum
penalty of five years in prison and a
$100,000 fine. Prostitution, a mis
demeanor, carries a maximum penalty
of one year in jail and a $2,500 fine.
