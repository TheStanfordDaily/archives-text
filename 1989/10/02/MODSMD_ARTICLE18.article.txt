## Wasting our trust 
### 
Radioactive substances
are not to be played with.
And University safety of
ficials appear to be playing with
something just as sensitive: the
trust of the community.
During a routine inspection of
University laboratories and docu
ments in March, the state's Depart
ment of Health Services found 32
violations of regulations governing
the use of radioactive materials.
The DHS ordered Stanford to
perform an in-house review to de
termine if the violations were iso
lated or symptomatic of a larger
problem. The University then
created a task force to perform the
review, and the final report is now
being assessed by the vice provost
for research.

Despite the large number of vi
olations, none was considered a
serious safety threat, a DHS
spokesman said. But two things
are disturbing about the Universi
ty's review.
First, it is questionable whether
the University can perform an ob
jective review of itself. More
serious, however, is the indication
from University officials that the
task force review most likely will
not be released to the public.
Though some officials said a
summary of the report's results
may be made public, a summary
is simply not enough. Members of
the community can only trust the
task force's findings — whatever
they may be — if a/7 of the findings
are made available.
