# Silent about sexism
## 
### 
SERIOUS accusations should
be taken seriously. And for
Stanford this will mean res
ponding to the imputations of
gender discrimination set forth by
the United Stanford Workers last
Tuesday.
The USW has charged Stanford
with paying the Medical Center's
female employees less than the
male employees for comparable
work. The life science technicians,
who happen to be 81 percent wom
en, are paid up to 21 percent less
than the science and engineering
technicians, who are 91 percent
men.
After a long-delayed arbitration
session with the University, the
USW was put off once again. The
University canceled the meeting at
the last minute, explaining that
they had conflicts with another ar
bitration case.
The University has neither made
any effort to discuss the issue with

the USW nor denied the accusation
with any solid arguments. They
have only stated that the different
wages have no bearing on gender
issues.
The University has been aware
of the issue for six years, according
to the USW, and the constant
deferring of the discussion makes
the administration appear insensi
tive to the concerns of the USW.
The USW, on the other hand,
has prepared statistics, organized
speakers around the cause, includ
ing a representative of the National
Organization for Women, and has
put forth efforts to discuss the
issue with the administration.
Unless the University responds
to the claims of gender discrimi
nation in a prompt, respectful and
sensitive manner, their dedication
to fair treatment of the USW, as
well as to ending sexism within
this institution, will seriously be
put into question.
