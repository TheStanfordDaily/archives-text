# Overhead costs threatening competitive research edge
## 
### Ken Yew Staff writer 
For every $1 campus scientists
spend to perform their research,
Stanford takes away 74 cents to
pay for administrative costs and
for research facilities. The high
overhead costs, researchers fear,
are causing the University to lose
its competitive research edge.
Researchers must pay the Uni
versity 74 percent of their total
grant money, a figure which may
rise as high as 86 percent in 10
years, according to Robert Byer,
vice provost and dean of research.
Overhead costs, or indirect
costs, are charged to researchers
to offset the costs of maintaining
research facilities and administra
tive services the University pro
vides. Research funds are an im
portant source of income for the
University, as funds paid by
grants for overhead go directly
into the University's budget.
Stanford's explosion of campus
construction does not help mat

ters, either â€” it is one of the
prime factors driving up the per
centage of grant monies set aside
for activities other than research.
As a result of the high overhead,
Stanford researchers are left with
less money than their colleagues
at many other institutions. In
fact, in a 1987 survey, a Univer
sity subcommittee found that
Stanford's indirect cost rate was
second highest among 12 compa
rable private institutions. And
Stanford's overhead rate is more
than twice that of some public
institutions.
Competitors at other univer
sities doing similar research have
"a distinct advantage," according
to Robert Simoni, chair of the
Biological Sciences Department.
Overhead costs are not
deducted from the total amount
the researchers get from grants
but are included in the original
grant the professors request.
However, Biological Sciences Prof.
Sharon Long said research grant
agencies typically "look at the

total amount, are relatively ap
palled and give less."
These agencies tend to give the
same amount to professors from
different institutions regardless of
their respective overhead costs,
Long said. As a result, Stanford
professors are usually left with
less money to pay for graduate
student research assistants and
supplies than researchers at most
other schools.
A particular concern of re
searchers is that the large over
head imposes a time burden upon
Stanford researchers as well as a
financial one. Because of the
reduced funds from each grant,
researchers must obtain grants
from several agencies. This ties
up Stanford scientists in admin
istrative tasks and takes time
away from research projects.
The fear of rising overhead
costs at Stanford was fueled by
the University subcommittee's
report two years ago estimating
only ones to suffer from the in
creasing overhead costs. Social
scientists are asked to pay just as
much as the physical scientists,
even though they tend to use less
space for their research.
Economics Prof. Kenneth Ar
row said the projected overhead
rate increase discriminates
against social science researchers
because they are not using the
research facilities that the higher
rates are paying for. He said the
University does not discriminate
between the various types of re
search done because it feels "the
administrative nuisance is not
worthwhile."
Byer said there is an inherent
"tension" between the need for
more research facilities and the
desire to let researchers obtain
the most money possible for their
projects. He said researchers who
are already established in labs
may be harmed by paying for new
buildings they will never get to
use. However, to those scientists

who need research space, the cost
may seem justified.
Byer said the University is
making "an investment in the fu
ture" by building new research
facilities Stanford scientists will
need later. He added that the Uni
versity is trying to lobby the
federal government to fund more
overhead costs so that scientists
will be better able to fund their
projects.
While concluding that Stanford
remains competitive with other
universities, the University sub
committee found "faculty as a
whole are expending more effort
to obtain grants and contracts."
The report said high overhead
costs are not a problem peculiar
to Stanford. According to the sub
committee, federal grant agencies
have not kept pace with rising
costs of doing research, thus sci
entists everywhere must request
more grants.
The subcommittee found that
public universities, like the Uni
versity of California schools, have
an estimated 20 percent lower
overhead rate because of the
larger amount of government sup

port they receive.
The subcommittee reported
that Stanford's indirect cost rate
in 1987 was 73 percent, compared
with Columbia University's 74
percent and Yale University's 72
percent. Harvard University was
slightly lower at 68 percent. But
Johns Hopkins University stood
at 60 percent and at 58 percent.
Among public universities, UC-
Berkeley was at 46 percent and
UC-San Diego was at 42 percent.
The lowest figure in the survey
was 33 percent, at the UC-San
Francisco Medical School.
Professors leaving
Stanford's overhead costs were
large enough to make at least one
researcher pack his bags
for another university. Electrical
Engineering Prof. John Madey,
inventor of the free electron laser,
moved his project to Duke in 1987
because his overhead costs were
going to rise to $2 million a year.
"The costs exceeded what I could
carry in my projects," Madey said.
Madey's move was a significant
blow to Stanford because he took
$10 million in defense-funded re

search equipment with him to
Duke.
Although his departure sent
waves of resentment through the
Stanford research community,
Madey said he does not blame
Stanford for its high overhead.
"All universities are facing a prob
lem with cost,"he said. "Stanford
has a special problem, the most
serious cause being that it is in
an expensive part of the country."
The high cost of maintaining
personnel and staff at Stanford
raises the cost of operations.
Madey estimated Stanford's over
head to be 25 percent higher than
at Duke.
Madey's case highlighted the
need for the University to address
the high costs of performing re
search on campus. Physics Prof.
Douglas Osheroff said the Uni
versity must take "prudent steps
from keeping the overhead from
going higher." Otherwise, he said,
the costs to do research at Stan
ford would be so high as to force
more professors to leave.
Byer said federal agencies have
been talking about capping the
overhead rates at universities.
