# Overhead costs threatening competitive research edge
## 
### Ken Yew Staff writer 
For every $1 campus scientists
spend to perform their research,
Stanford takes away 74 cents to
pay for administrative costs and
for research facilities. The high
overhead costs, researchers fear,
are causing the University to lose
its competitive research edge.
Researchers must pay the Uni
versity 74 percent of their total
grant money, a figure which may
rise as high as 86 percent in 10
years, according to Robert Byer,
vice provost and dean of research.
Overhead costs, or indirect
costs, are charged to researchers
to offset the costs of maintaining
research facilities and administra
tive services the University pro
vides. Research funds are an im
portant source of income for the
University, as funds paid by
grants for overhead go directly
into the University's budget.
Stanford's explosion of campus
construction does not help mat

ters, either â€” it is one of the
prime factors driving up the per
centage of grant monies set aside
for activities other than research.
As a result of the high overhead,
Stanford researchers are left with
less money than their colleagues
at many other institutions. In
fact, in a 1987 survey, a Univer
sity subcommittee found that
Stanford's indirect cost rate was
second highest among 12 compa
rable private institutions. And
Stanford's overhead rate is more
than twice that of some public
institutions.
Competitors at other univer
sities doing similar research have
"a distinct advantage," according
to Robert Simoni, chair of the
Biological Sciences Department.
Overhead costs are not
deducted from the total amount
the researchers get from grants
but are included in the original
grant the professors request.
However, Biological Sciences Prof.
Sharon Long said research grant
agencies typically "look at the

total amount, are relatively ap
palled and give less."
These agencies tend to give the
same amount to professors from
different institutions regardless of
their respective overhead costs,
Long said. As a result, Stanford
professors are usually left with
less money to pay for graduate
student research assistants and
supplies than researchers at most
other schools.
A particular concern of re
searchers is that the large over
head imposes a time burden upon
Stanford researchers as well as a
financial one. Because of the
reduced funds from each grant,
researchers must obtain grants
from several agencies. This ties
up Stanford scientists in admin
istrative tasks and takes time
away from research projects.
The fear of rising overhead
costs at Stanford was fueled by
the University subcommittee's
report two years ago estimating
