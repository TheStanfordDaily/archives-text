## Death penalty only illusion of justice 
### 
ON JULY 14, 1989, Horace Dunkins
was electrocuted in Alabama's
electric chair. He had been sen
tenced to death in 1981 for murder.
He knew he was going to die. What
he didn't know was that the wires which
would send 2,000 volts of electric current
through his body had been improperly
connected.
It took nine minutes for him to die.
That's not an execution — it's torture.
In the United States we not only botch
executions — the entire judicial process
which sentences people to die is itself
contaminated.
We execute arbitrarily and with eco
nomic and racial biases. Killers of white
victims, for instance, are much more
likely to be executed than killers of black
victims.
We execute the mentally retarded and
emotionally disturbed — James Terry
Roach, executed in South Carolina in
1986, had a personality disorder and the
intellect of a 12-year-old child.
We execute children. Paula Cooper was
sentenced to die in Indiana for a murder
she committed when she was 15. After
her case attracted international attention,
her sentence was commuted to 60 years
imprisonment.
It is time to ask ourselves some hard
questions: Can we entrust a flawed legal
system with dispensation of the ultimate
penalty, one without recall? Does execut
ing criminals make our country a better
place in which to live? What role should
this cruel, racist roulette have in America
as we approach the 21st century?

Congress need not
resort to poisoning,
hanging, or electrocut
ing criminals in order
to impress upon the
public the importance
of its legislative mis
sion.

low William Tucker's "Viewpoint" of
Sept. 29, "Whose death penalty is it, any
way?,", is an exercise in illogic and omis
sion.
His central argument — that the state
must kill criminals in order to prove its
authority — is ludicrous. "By assuming
the awesome responsibility of taking life,"
Tucker writes, "the state asserts that its
purposes are more important than
anyone else's."
The democratic state receives its au
thority to rule by virtue of its having the
consent of the governed. Congress need
not resort to poisoning, hanging, or
electrocuting criminals in order to
impress upon the public the importance
of its legislative mission.
Tucker also repeats the truism which
holds that the death penalty "perma
nently incapacitates a specific criminal."

Clearly, killing a person tends to in
capacitate him or her. But so does life
imprisonment, a punishment devoid of
malice and barbarism, and which, if ap
plied erroneously, at least can be over
turned. The death penalty is irrevocable.
A staggering number of people have
been executed or sentenced to death by
state courts, only to be found innocent
later. Had Tucker's Cardinal Richelieu
lived in a different France, he would have
heard the Marquis de Lafayette declare:
"I shall ask for the abolition of the death
penalty until I have the infallibility of
human judgment demonstrated to me."
Careful readers may note that the au
thor did not offer proof of the "deter
rence" argument. Why did he fail to cite
studies showing that the death penalty
deters crime? Because there are none.
No research has ever demonstrated the
so-called "deterrent" effect of killing
criminals. _
To the contrary, the Bowers-Pierce
study, conducted in the United States
between 1907 and 1963, determined that
homicide rates actually increased after
an execution.
Violent crime in our country must be
stopped. The death penalty is an in
human, ineffective gesture toward doing
so. It may provide some with the illusion
of "justice," diverting attention from real
solutions to our nation's problems, but
it degrades us all as it degrades the person
who receives it.
