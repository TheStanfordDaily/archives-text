## Stanford Bachelors Club does not discriminate by age 
### 
As stated in a Stanford Alumni
Association mailing that went out
to Stanford graduates in the Bay
Area, the Stanford Bachelors Club
desires to provide an atmosphere for
singles to meet, foster friendships and
professional relationships with other
single alumni of various backgrounds
and interests and to maintain contact
with the Stanford culture.
We do this through a variety of
events, including large formal and
informal dances, Sunday gatherings,
speakers, back-packing trips and on
campus tennis tournaments.
As part of our efforts to promote
contact with the University, about 20
of our members are registered with the
Alumni Contact Service so that we can
serve as a sounding board for graduat
ing seniors. We will be assisting at the
Alumni Association tent prior to the
Big Game. Also, we have requested
four speakers from the University for
club functions.
In her Sept. 26 letter to the Daily,
Judy Weisner states that "it is sus
pected that most of the funds (raised
at large parties) are used to subsidize
the small parties." In fact, we donate

proceeds from our parties to various
University groups even though this is
not expected of any alumni group.
Net proceeds of our larger functions
that aren't contributed to the Univer
sity are then used to subsidize smaller
events.
For our Symphony Series, we were
able to finance the mailing regarding
the events, and we will also help sub
sidize the cost of speakers we are
trying to arrange with the Music
Department in coiyunction with the
symphony.
Weisner chided our club for the low
number of Stanford alumni present at
some of our functions. In our most
recent newsletter, our calendar of
events lists 17 scheduled functions for
the last four months of the year. At
two-thirds of these, attendance by club
members will be 50 percent or more.
I would like to think that Weisner
would consider this to be a "reasonable
ratio between Stanford alumni and
other guests." Also, Stanford graduates
who attend our parties but don't
belong to the club receive the same
name tags as our guests. Therefore,
until the end of the party, no one has
any way to estimate the number of

alums at these larger functions.
In the letter, it was hinted that we
are a group of middle-aged Stanford
graduates who unabashedly sort cards
in a frenzy at the women's registration
table.
First, half of our officers graduated
from Stanford in the 1980s. We are
actively recruiting recent graduates
(which we define as people 35 years
old or younger), but we don't dis
courage alumni outside this age range.
I believe the Alumni Association has a
goal to have greater involvement from
recent graduates as well.
Our target age range for guests is
singles under the age of 40. We stated
at the bottom of the most recent invi
tation that "Stanford Bachelor Events
are for Members and for Guests
(Singles under 40) by invitation."
Second, any card-sorting is done for
both men and women, as we're trying
to have the same demographics for our
guests as we are for our members.
Nonetheless, anyone with an invitation
is not refused admission at the door.
Due to space limitations, we have to
restrict attendance at some of our
functions. We hired a guard to ask for
invitations at one function and we will

have a computer printout of invitees at
one of our upcoming functions.
Women who have attended our
smaller function tend to be alumnae,
those who've helped us at our larger
functions and are friends of club mem
bers. The "typical" woman attending
one of our events is a college graduate
in a professional career.
Club officer positions tend to be
filled on a volunteer basis and we
encourage all of our members to help
coordinate events. Prior to becoming
president, I had served in two different
positions in the club and was one of
three people under consideration for
the club presidency. Two of the individ
uals interviewing me had a copy of my
resume.
We would have liked to address
Weisner's concerns to her personally.
She's not a Stanford graduate and we
don't know her address. I'm uncertain
as to her motives for writing her
letter. As a club, we can't please every
one, and our focus must remain on
meeting the needs and interests of our
club members.
