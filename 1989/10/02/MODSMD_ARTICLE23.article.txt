# Some questions for Hoover media fellow to consider as well
## 
### 
I am surprised that in the first week
of classes, Hoover Institute Fellow
William Tucker would rush so
vigorously to expose his cynicism and
condescension to incoming freshmen.
I assume he wants all students to
respect his viewpoints on their sub
stantive merits rather than be repulsed

by his rather disrespectful tone. In his
Sept. 26 letter to the Daily, he belittles
the project of becoming globally literate
in his first reference to "world civiliza
tion courses," which he says (with
tongue in cheek) familiarize freshmen
with "every corner of the globe."
Why such a cynical tone? Is he
honestly on the side of students who
will have to develop a broad under
standing of the world in order to make
wise and sensitive decisions when we
are in his shoes?
Furthermore, he somehow thinks a
fair and honest treatment of commu
nism and democracy will not occur in

these classes. The questions he asks
point to his desire to see democratic
capitalism venerated on the basis of
the material comforts some of us eiyoy
here in the United States. I guess this
level of thinking is all he expects from
incoming Stanford students:
In communist countries like East
Germany and the Soviet Union, there
are food shortages and people cannot
develop their creative and intellectual
talents. Thprefore, communism is a
sham and we should focus our atten
tion on refining our own system.
Maybe we students could think of a
few questions that Tucker could an-

swer. For instance, why would a huge
power like the United States spend
resources that are greatly needed to
improve such "luxuries" as education
and health care instead to create and
maintain a US presence in a small and
poor country like Nicaragua?
Why does a country that is rich
enough to feed the entire world allow
children to starve at home? I hope
Tucker would want to dedicate equal
time to hard-hitting questions about
our "civilized" nation.
