## Christopher's fantastic view of 1992 Fuentes depicts a corrupt, broken Mexico

"Christopher Unborn"
by Carlos Fuentes
Farrar, Straus and Giroux, $22.95.

In "Christopher Unborn," Mexican writer Carlos
Fuentes describes his vision of Mexico s future in
1992. Narrated by Christopher, a gestating infant
in his mother's womb, Fuentes' novel characterizes
Mexico as economically dominated by the United
States, divided by deep class differences, threatened
by expanding tourism and faced with a social in
frastructure on the point of collapse. The strength
of Fuentes' prose augments the power of his mes
sage, and Fuentes' skilled way with words holds the
reader's attention*
Christopher is part seer and-part philosopher.
The product of 6 relationship between Angeles and
Angel, two youtig revolutionaries, Christopher is
born of somev%at uttidealistic motivations. Angeles
and Angel coo&ive him on an Acapulco beach as
part of a plan to win a government-sponsored contest
commemorating the 500 th anniversary of the arrival
of Christopher Columbus in the New World.
Although the revolutionary couple do want to win
the contest, it is not their only reason for having
a baby. Asked by Angeles why he wants to conceive
a child, Angel explains. "Because I am happy . . . 1
am possessed of the most intimate, reactionary hap
piness!" Here as elsewhere/Fuentes' manipulation
of language approaches poetry: "... jmy divine An
geles," says Angel, "I drink the wine of your nalglass,
I hear the toll of your knelglass, I bury my nose
in your knolgrass, Oh your Mexican ass my Angeles
mia . . . \ \A
Equally striking in "Christopher Unborn" are the
staccato dialogues, the word-plays and the interplay
of the Spanish and English languages (Acapulco,
Kafkapulco, Acapulque, Kickapulco all are names
for the same resort). The repetition of sounds and
the stream of consciousness in Fuentes' narrative
both are reminiscent of James Joyce. Though orig
inally written in Spanish, "Christopher Unborn"
maintains this richness in the English translation,
probably due to Fuentes' involvement in the trans
lation process.

'But soon there shall be no time for happiness, and we shall all be
sad, old and young alike,' my father went on, taking off his glasses —
tinted violet, gold-framed, utterly John Lennonish.
'Why do you want a child, then?' my mother said, sighing again.
'Because soon there will be no time for happiness.'

The language and the style, impressive as they
are, do not detract from Fuentes' characters. Angel,
Angeles and Christopher are the most developed
and initially are described only indirectly through
their interactions. Angeles is only developed in re
lation to Angel, and she is described as having no
personal past: her first moment of being seems to
have taken place when the two met. Their characters
develop and are intertwined slowly through the
glimpses that Christopher has into the past and
the present.
It is Christopher's telling of the story that is
Fuentes' most successful literary device. Christo
pher sometimes addresses the reader directly, beg
ging him or her to continue reading, and at other
times conducts rambling, introspective monologues.
Though his narrative is primarily personal at first,
Christopher begins to interweave external, past
events such as the massacre of students at Tlateloco
ill 1968, the 1985 Mexico City earthquake and the
Mexican Revolution into his story, creating a realistic
backdrop for Fuentes' novel.
Sometimes Christopher's narrative becomes dif
ficult to follow, switching abruptly from one scenario
to the next. This "disconnected" feeling is common
to other "fantastic" works of Latin American litera
ture. Otherworldly contact and characters, an ill
defined boundary between the imagined and the
"real," and the unquestioned acceptance of these
are all features of novels by writers such as Silvina
Ocampo, Isabel Allende, Jorge Borges and Gabriel
Garcia M&rquez.
Christopher's narration from the womb is one of
the most obvious examples of the fantastic. There
are, of course, many fascinating others. Angel's par
ents invent a number of impossible and metaphysical

objects, including one that creates a 14th person
when only 13 dinner guests arrive. Another example
is the mythological vagina dentata, a not-so-pleasant
dream come true in a character named Colasa. Such
fantastical elements are mentioned in an almost
offhand way, as part of the "reality" of Fuentes'
novel. Fuentes' use of the fantastic is horrific yet
disciplined.
Fuentes' criticism of the United States and its
influence also remains subtle and controlled
throughout the book. The theme of aggressive
Americanization, introduced at the beginning of the
novel, is an ongoing satiric device. The assault on
Mexico's language and economy by the industrial
McDonald's culture of the United States, reinforced
by an occupying American military force, is pointed
but not overdone.
Weighing in at over 500 pages, "Christopher Un
born" is not a simple beach read. Its complexity
makes it both rich and sometimes frustrating.
Thus the largest flaw in this book: Fuentes simply
tries to cover too much area. Some critics suggest
that Fuentes may be aiming for this year's Nobei
Prize in literature, which may explain his wide
scope. Walking the line between political satire and
philosophy, "Christopher Unborn" certainly is am
bitious. The reader comprehends the intricacies and
many subplots of the novel only at its end, which
make it sometimes difficult to follow. "Christopher
Unborn" does take patience.
Fuentes depicts a dismal Mexico, unlikely to im
prove and difficult to change. The government stifles
the masses with meaningless symbols, the rich hold
power exclusively and corruption is commonplace.
Some of Fuentes' strongest images also are the most
distasteful. The sewers threaten to back up and
engulf the capital. Even the tourist paradise of

Acapulco is destroyed by its residents' waste. And
just following Christopher's conception, Angel and
Angeles look up to find diarrhea raining down on
them from a passing parachutist. Mexico is a country
of broken dreams, drowning in its own filth, "a
country of sad men and happy children."
The question that rings throughout the novel is
this: Is Mexico in 1992 a place where any child
should be born? Fuentes offers no indication that
it is. The strength of his characters is undermined
by the hopelessness of their situation. One can only
hope that, like Orwell, Fuentes is an excellent
novelist, but a poor prophet.

this: Is Mexico in 1992 a place where any child
should be born? Fuentes offers no indication that

novelist, but a poor prophet.

"Christopher Unborn"
by Carlos Fuentes
Farrar, Straus and Giroux, $22.95.
Reviewed by Adrianne Estill
In "Christopher Unborn," Mexican writer Carlos
Fuentes describes his vision of Mexico s future in
1992. Narrated by Christopher, a gestating infant
in his mother's womb, Fuentes' novel characterizes
Mexico as economically dominated by the United
States, divided by deep class differences, threatened
by expanding tourism and faced with a social in
frastructure on the point of collapse. The strength
of Fuentes' prose augments the power of his mes
sage, and Fuentes' skilled way with words holds the
reader's attention*
Christopher is part seer and-part philosopher.
The product of 6 relationship between Angeles and
Angel, two youtig revolutionaries, Christopher is
born of somev%at uttidealistic motivations. Angeles
and Angel coo&ive him on an Acapulco beach as
part of a plan to win a government-sponsored contest
commemorating the 500 th anniversary of the arrival
of Christopher Columbus in the New World.
Although the revolutionary couple do want to win
the contest, it is not their only reason for having
a baby. Asked by Angeles why he wants to conceive
a child, Angel explains. "Because I am happy . . . 1
am possessed of the most intimate, reactionary hap
piness!" Here as elsewhere/Fuentes' manipulation
of language approaches poetry: "... jmy divine An
geles," says Angel, "I drink the wine of your nalglass,
I hear the toll of your knelglass, I bury my nose
in your knolgrass, Oh your Mexican ass my Angeles
mia . . . \ \A
Equally striking in "Christopher Unborn" are the
staccato dialogues, the word-plays and the interplay
of the Spanish and English languages (Acapulco,
Kafkapulco, Acapulque, Kickapulco all are names
for the same resort). The repetition of sounds and
the stream of consciousness in Fuentes' narrative
both are reminiscent of James Joyce. Though orig
inally written in Spanish, "Christopher Unborn"
maintains this richness in the English translation,
probably due to Fuentes' involvement in the trans
lation process.

'But soon there shall be no time for happiness, and we shall all be
sad, old and young alike,' my father went on, taking off his glasses —
tinted violet, gold-framed, utterly John Lennonish.
'Why do you want a child, then?' my mother said, sighing again.
'Because soon there will be no time for happiness.'

The language and the style, impressive as they
are, do not detract from Fuentes' characters. Angel,
Angeles and Christopher are the most developed
and initially are described only indirectly through
their interactions. Angeles is only developed in re
lation to Angel, and she is described as having no
personal past: her first moment of being seems to
have taken place when the two met. Their characters
develop and are intertwined slowly through the
glimpses that Christopher has into the past and
the present.
It is Christopher's telling of the story that is
Fuentes' most successful literary device. Christo
pher sometimes addresses the reader directly, beg
ging him or her to continue reading, and at other
times conducts rambling, introspective monologues.
Though his narrative is primarily personal at first,
Christopher begins to interweave external, past
events such as the massacre of students at Tlateloco
ill 1968, the 1985 Mexico City earthquake and the
Mexican Revolution into his story, creating a realistic
backdrop for Fuentes' novel.
Sometimes Christopher's narrative becomes dif
ficult to follow, switching abruptly from one scenario
to the next. This "disconnected" feeling is common
to other "fantastic" works of Latin American litera
ture. Otherworldly contact and characters, an ill
defined boundary between the imagined and the
"real," and the unquestioned acceptance of these
are all features of novels by writers such as Silvina
Ocampo, Isabel Allende, Jorge Borges and Gabriel
Garcia M&rquez.
Christopher's narration from the womb is one of
the most obvious examples of the fantastic. There
are, of course, many fascinating others. Angel's par
ents invent a number of impossible and metaphysical

objects, including one that creates a 14th person
when only 13 dinner guests arrive. Another example
is the mythological vagina dentata, a not-so-pleasant
dream come true in a character named Colasa. Such
fantastical elements are mentioned in an almost
offhand way, as part of the "reality" of Fuentes'
novel. Fuentes' use of the fantastic is horrific yet
disciplined.
Fuentes' criticism of the United States and its
influence also remains subtle and controlled
throughout the book. The theme of aggressive
Americanization, introduced at the beginning of the
novel, is an ongoing satiric device. The assault on
Mexico's language and economy by the industrial
McDonald's culture of the United States, reinforced
by an occupying American military force, is pointed
but not overdone.
Weighing in at over 500 pages, "Christopher Un
born" is not a simple beach read. Its complexity
makes it both rich and sometimes frustrating.
Thus the largest flaw in this book: Fuentes simply
tries to cover too much area. Some critics suggest
that Fuentes may be aiming for this year's Nobei
Prize in literature, which may explain his wide
scope. Walking the line between political satire and
philosophy, "Christopher Unborn" certainly is am
bitious. The reader comprehends the intricacies and
many subplots of the novel only at its end, which
make it sometimes difficult to follow. "Christopher
