Choosing a College: A Guide for Parents and
Students"
By Thomas Sowell
Harper and Row, $7.95
Reviewed by Jon Reider
In the popular American tradition of self-help
books, a new genre of breezily written "how-to"
college guides have appeared, usually written by
experienced college admissions professionals, college
guidance counselors or journalists specializing in
education.
Now Thomas Sowell, admittedly an outsider to
the admissions profession, has entered this market
with a book of straight talk.
Sowell is a Senior Fellow at the Hoover Institution
and has an extensive record of publications in eco
nomics and sociology. He has a reputation as a
thoughtful, scholarly conservative, unafraid of con
troversy and highly critical of standard liberal pro
grams — such as affirmative action— for helping
the disadvantaged. This is a viewpoint rarely posited
in the college admissions profession, and his book
makes a useful contribution to the national discus
sion on such varied issues as the use of SAT's,
Asian-American quotas and minority life on mostly
white campuses.
The book was less "conservative" than I had
expected and showed that Sowell wanted to reach
a broad audience which did not necessarily share
his ideological framework.
"Choosing a College" has many strengths: easy
readability, broad coverage of topics and basically
good common sense advice. He is especially good at
helping students sort through the plethora of college
handbooks and at coaching them on how to read
between the lines of glossy brochures. He gives
sound advice about visiting colleges, including a
plea for students to inspect the bookstore and library
holdings, not just the quality of cafeteria food.
Sowell is particularly devastating, and deservedly
so, when he tackles the well-publicized rankings of
colleges. He is also helpful at recommending the
virtues of small, lesser-known colleges which provide
quality programs.
His advice to minority students is realistic and
not condescending. It is what you might expect from
him: work hard and don't assume that help from
liberal affirmative action policies will actually help
you in the long run, since they may put you in a
college which is not appropriate for you. Advocates
of increased minority enrollment at elite institutions
won't like this part of the book, and Sowell provides
no alternative to the idea of returning to a mostly
white (and Asian) campus if affirmative action were
to be curtailed.
Here, as elsewhere in the book, his message is
consistent: look for colleges which fit you, not one
with glamour or a name. The book is devoid, for
the most part, of ideological code words or cheap

'On something as important as choosing a college, parents
should not defer to, or be intimidated by, educators who have
failed so many children in so many ways for so long. Many
educators are good at smooth and lofty talk, delivered with
airs of certainty and an implication that you must be very
backward if you disagree or even question.'

shots at "colleges awash in affirmative action offi
cers," which can be found in other recent articles
of his. Yet, in his chapter on the varieties of college
environments, he indulges in some anecdotal
criticism of gay and lesbian influences at certain
colleges. I doubt that this provides a full and fair
portrayal of life at these schools, although there is
nothing wrong with providing information about
colleges where students from conservative families
are likely to feel more comfortable.
Sowell's chapter on college admissions is titled,
without imagination, "The Admissions Game." He
writes with savage disdain for what he considers
to be the manipulative nature of college admissions

professionals, and he places too much emphasis on
psyching out the system. This is one of the few
places in the book where his ideological preconcep
tions seem to take hold over a more judicious ap
proach.
The advice he gives sounds realistic to the unin
itiated, but it is ultimately cynical and undercuts
the very goal he professes to endorse elsewhere:
putting education ahead of prestige. He makes sur
prisingly little attempt to explain how things work
from the inside of the admissions process, except
to condemn it for subjectivity. "Scientific, it ain't,"
he says at one point.
Of course, the process is not entirely scientific,

and I don't think even Sowell would want it to be,
nor could he design a system that was totally "sci
entific" (I assume he means "objective") if he wanted
to. Yet, if he had taken the trouble to actually talk
to someone on a college admissions staff about the
"subjective" side of the process, he would have
discovered that the process is much less whimsical
and arbitrary than he seems to think. Ironically,
such information, which is readily available, would
help his audience become more sensitive consumers,
which is his announced goal.
Another flaw is that while he has obviously done
extensive research (the book is full of useful statis
tics, which are rarely gathered in one place), in an
attempt to avoid a stiff academic tone, he rarely
cites his sources. Thus at times he succumbs to a
piece of conventional wisdom, which he has accepted
unquestioningly or has failed to check apparently
anomalous facts.
For example, he claims, without citing any
evidence, that college admissions personnel are, by
and large, relatively young, inexperienced and with
out scholarly backgrounds. At Stanford, in contrast,
four out of 12 staff members have a Ph.D., and I
have met many peers at other institutions with
equivalent credentials. Much of this information is
based on an uncited study of Harvard, and it reveals
an unfortunate tendency of Sowell's to construct
flimsy generalizations from a single case of dubious
typicality.
On another front, late in the book he cites the
statistic that in one year Stanford's number of
Asian-American admissions doubled. In fact, what
happened was that Undergraduate Admissions
changed its coding of Asian-American Permanent
Residents to include them among Asian-Americans
for the first time in 1986. Actually, the increase
was far less than 100 percent.
He also gives at least one piece of spectacularly
misleading advice on increasing your chances at
very selective schools — applying to more of them
if your credentials are roughly competitive. While
the individual examples are trivial in themselves,
they are troubling since they lead me to wonder
how much of his other research has comparable
glitches.
Despite its faults, Sowell's book is a useful addition
to the literature. It is fun to read and gives largely
reasonable advice. Yet it is hardly without flaws or
significant omissions. The destructive proliferation
of Early Action/Early Decision programs is not even
mentioned, and the issue of financial aid, crucial
for so many families today, is only touched upon.
So the book should best be considered only one of
several potential sources of advice in this contro
versial area.

Choosing a College: A Guide for Parents and
Students"
By Thomas Sowell
Harper and Row, $7.95
Reviewed by Jon Reider
In the popular American tradition of self-help
books, a new genre of breezily written "how-to"
college guides have appeared, usually written by
experienced college admissions professionals, college
guidance counselors or journalists specializing in
education.
Now Thomas Sowell, admittedly an outsider to
the admissions profession, has entered this market
with a book of straight talk.
Sowell is a Senior Fellow at the Hoover Institution
and has an extensive record of publications in eco
nomics and sociology. He has a reputation as a
thoughtful, scholarly conservative, unafraid of con
troversy and highly critical of standard liberal pro
grams — such as affirmative action— for helping
the disadvantaged. This is a viewpoint rarely posited
in the college admissions profession, and his book
makes a useful contribution to the national discus
sion on such varied issues as the use of SAT's,
Asian-American quotas and minority life on mostly
white campuses.
The book was less "conservative" than I had
expected and showed that Sowell wanted to reach
a broad audience which did not necessarily share
his ideological framework.
"Choosing a College" has many strengths: easy
readability, broad coverage of topics and basically
good common sense advice. He is especially good at
helping students sort through the plethora of college
handbooks and at coaching them on how to read
between the lines of glossy brochures. He gives
sound advice about visiting colleges, including a
plea for students to inspect the bookstore and library
holdings, not just the quality of cafeteria food.
Sowell is particularly devastating, and deservedly
so, when he tackles the well-publicized rankings of
colleges. He is also helpful at recommending the
virtues of small, lesser-known colleges which provide
quality programs.
His advice to minority students is realistic and
not condescending. It is what you might expect from
him: work hard and don't assume that help from
liberal affirmative action policies will actually help
you in the long run, since they may put you in a
college which is not appropriate for you. Advocates
of increased minority enrollment at elite institutions
won't like this part of the book, and Sowell provides
no alternative to the idea of returning to a mostly
white (and Asian) campus if affirmative action were
to be curtailed.
Here, as elsewhere in the book, his message is
consistent: look for colleges which fit you, not one
with glamour or a name. The book is devoid, for
the most part, of ideological code words or cheap

'On something as important as choosing a college, parents
should not defer to, or be intimidated by, educators who have
failed so many children in so many ways for so long. Many
educators are good at smooth and lofty talk, delivered with
airs of certainty and an implication that you must be very
backward if you disagree or even question.'

shots at "colleges awash in affirmative action offi
cers," which can be found in other recent articles
of his. Yet, in his chapter on the varieties of college
environments, he indulges in some anecdotal
criticism of gay and lesbian influences at certain
colleges. I doubt that this provides a full and fair
portrayal of life at these schools, although there is
nothing wrong with providing information about
colleges where students from conservative families
are likely to feel more comfortable.
Sowell's chapter on college admissions is titled,
without imagination, "The Admissions Game." He
writes with savage disdain for what he considers
to be the manipulative nature of college admissions

professionals, and he places too much emphasis on
psyching out the system. This is one of the few
places in the book where his ideological preconcep
tions seem to take hold over a more judicious ap
proach.
The advice he gives sounds realistic to the unin
itiated, but it is ultimately cynical and undercuts
the very goal he professes to endorse elsewhere:
putting education ahead of prestige. He makes sur
prisingly little attempt to explain how things work
from the inside of the admissions process, except
to condemn it for subjectivity. "Scientific, it ain't,"
he says at one point.
Of course, the process is not entirely scientific,

and I don't think even Sowell would want it to be,
nor could he design a system that was totally "sci
entific" (I assume he means "objective") if he wanted
to. Yet, if he had taken the trouble to actually talk
to someone on a college admissions staff about the
"subjective" side of the process, he would have
discovered that the process is much less whimsical
and arbitrary than he seems to think. Ironically,
such information, which is readily available, would
help his audience become more sensitive consumers,
which is his announced goal.
Another flaw is that while he has obviously done
extensive research (the book is full of useful statis
tics, which are rarely gathered in one place), in an
attempt to avoid a stiff academic tone, he rarely
cites his sources. Thus at times he succumbs to a
piece of conventional wisdom, which he has accepted
unquestioningly or has failed to check apparently
anomalous facts.
For example, he claims, without citing any
evidence, that college admissions personnel are, by
and large, relatively young, inexperienced and with
out scholarly backgrounds. At Stanford, in contrast,
four out of 12 staff members have a Ph.D., and I
have met many peers at other institutions with
equivalent credentials. Much of this information is
based on an uncited study of Harvard, and it reveals
an unfortunate tendency of Sowell's to construct
flimsy generalizations from a single case of dubious
typicality.
On another front, late in the book he cites the
statistic that in one year Stanford's number of
Asian-American admissions doubled. In fact, what
happened was that Undergraduate Admissions
changed its coding of Asian-American Permanent
Residents to include them among Asian-Americans
for the first time in 1986. Actually, the increase
was far less than 100 percent.
