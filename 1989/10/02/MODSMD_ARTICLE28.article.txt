You Make The Call
With 2:17 remaining in the third quarter, officials ruled that San Jose State receiver Kevin Evans
(88) scored a touchdown on a 22-yard pass from Spartan quarterback Matt Veatch. Side judge
Don Carey, a Big West Conference official, initially did not signal for a touchdown nor an incomplete
pass. But after consultation, the officials decided that Cardinal cornerback Kevin Scott (3) had
illegally interfered with Evans and that Evans had caught the ball in the end zone, giving San Jose
a 34-30 lead — one they would never relinquish. In addition, the 15-yard pass interference penalty
against Scott was assessed on the ensuing kickoff. Photo 1 — Evans headed for the goal line,

The pass sailed high, forcing Evans to jump backwards. Photo 2 — It appeared Scott would
come down with the ball for an interception. Photo 3 — After Scott fails to control the pass,
Evans sees a chance to make the catch. He is falling though, and his hands are face down. It
seems he will be unable to catch the ball. Photo 4 — Evans uses his palms to break his fall and
the ball falls to the ground. The official is screened from the play. If you said this was not a
touchdown, you made the right call.
