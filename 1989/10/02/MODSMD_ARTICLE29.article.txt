# Spartans pummel Stanford in offensive slugfest
## 
### Chris Crader Editorial staff 
In a game that was expected to
match the big-play, explosive of
fense of San Jose State against
the big-play, rock-solid defense of
Stanford, one thing became clear
very quickly:
The big plays won.
Despite the fact that Stanford
quarterback Steve Smith threw
for 384 yards' Saturday, the Spar
tans came up with even more big
plays and beat the Cardinal 40-33.

"I thought we played well
enough to win," Stanford Coach
Denny Green said. But San Jose
State's ability to produce the big
play and some officiating that was
dubious at best dropped the Car
dinal to 1-3 on the year going into
this weekend's game against No.
1 Notre Dame.
San Jose State upped its record
to 2-1.
The game featured nine lead
changes, 830 yards of total offense
and 57 points in the middle two
quarters alone. But the Cardinal
defense, which had been the
team's strength so far this season,
could not stop the Spartans and
the Cardinal offense did not con
tinue to match SJSU point-for
point in the fourth quarter.
Entering the game with four of
its top five running backs not

suiting up due to injury, all 58,000
people in Stanford Stadium knew
the Cardinal was going to throw
early and throw often. The stategy
worked through nearly three
quarters, but Stanford's offense
stalled in the final period.
Through the first 41 minutes
of the game, Smith was an in
credible 22-for-29 (.759) for 342
yards, but he was a mere 6-23
(.261) for 42 yards the rest of the
way. Ed McCaffrey was his favor
ite target, catching 10 balls for
165 yards.
"We did some things well,"
Green said, "but we gave up way
too many big plays. . . . Our run
ning game was not there. We
didn't control the line of scrim
mage. . . . Today we just didn't
quite get it done."
On the first play from scrim
mage, Smith threw an intercep
tion as linebacker Dave Moss
stepped in front of the intended
receiver, Ed McCaffrey. Six plays
later Sheldon Canley ran it in
from the eight and it was 7-0.
Things got better for the Car
dinal offense, but the State offense
didn't slow down. The Cardinal
defense gave up nine plays of 20
yards or more, accounting for 301
of the Spartans' 416 total yards.
The biggest of the big plays
came with Stanford leading 30-28
near the end of the third quarter.
With a first down on their own
19, Spartan quarterback Matt
Veatch threw a pass that was
batted down by Cardinal line
backer Dave Garnett. On the next
play, Veatch threw an overhand
lateral pass to wide receiver Doug

Hooker, who then aired it out
downfield. Kevin Evans was about
10 yards past the Stanford sec
ondary at this point, but Hooker
underthrew the ball. Evans made
the catch and the fact that he had
to come back to the ball allowed
the defense to catch him after a
59-yard gain to the Cardinal 22.
On the next play, Veatch went
back and saw the 6-foot-4 Evans
in single coverage by 5-11 corner
back Kevin Scott. Veatch heaved
the ball way up into the air past
the two and since Scott was be
hind Evans, an interception
looked likely. Scott tried to hold
his ground, Evans basically
backed into him, out-jumped Scott
and fell to the ground.
The official closest to the play
signalled to stop the clock but no
official signalled for a touchdown.
Then a flag was thrown.
The officials spent several
minutes trying to figure out what
happened, then came the shocker.
They decided Evans had caught
the ball, they decided Scott was
guilty of pass interference and
they decided that the 15-yard
penalty could be assessed on the
following kickofT.
"I imagine I've seen worse of
ficiating, but I can't say where,"
Green said. "That's a reference to
the whole game. (They said) our
guy pushed off on him; their guy
did indeed catch it; the ball didn't
bounce off the ground; you can
assess the 15 yards on the kick
ofT."
And what did it look like to
you, Denny? "(Offensive) pass in
terference, obviously. Everybody's

got the same right to the ball.
"Sixty-five thousand people saw
the ball was dropped but a few
officials didn't. Sixty-five thou
sand fans saw pass interference
but the officials didn't."
Scott was also shocked by the
play that gave the Spartans the
lead for good. "As far as the in
terference, I can't argue the call,"
he said. "That was his call. When
they gave him the touchdown. . . .
Well, he didn't catch the ball. It
hit the ground."
"I was in front of him. He was
coming over my back. I can't see
how I could have interfered with
him."
Referee Larry Thompson ex
plained the call after the game.
"The side judge ruled that the
receiver was pushed at the 5-yard
line," Thompson said. "It was
then ruled that the offensive
receiver possessed the ball, that
he came down with the ball in
his possession. It was six points
and defensive interference was
called on the play.
"The confusion resulted be
cause the touchdown was not
called immediately. The TD deci
sion should have been given at
the time, and it was not."
For what it's worth, the side
judge, the man who made the call,
was Don Carey, a Big West official.
The Spartans went for two on
the extra point attempt, but Can
ley was stopped on an option play.
The touchdown did give the Spar
tans a 34-30 lead, however, and
the resulting kickoff, taken from
the 50, put Stanford in a hole at
their own 21.

Illegal motion and a sack of
Smith meant freshman Paul
Stonehouse had to punt from his
own end zone. The Spartans took
over on the 34 but were stopped
when Alan Grant stopped Canley
on fourth and 1. Two plays later,
Smith was intercepted by line
backer Everett Lampkins, and
Lampkins rambled 39 yards for a
touchdown.
Card notes
One other area of concern is the
punting game. Freshman Paul
Stonehouse made his college debut
last week, punting four times for a
30.5-yard average. Saturday he kicked
four times for 31.5 yard√ü. Green still
remains confident, however, that

Stonehouse will find the form that
made him a high school All-American
by averaging 43 yards.
Placekicker John Hopkins tied a
school record by booting four field
goals in one game. He hit from 36,
54, 35 and 46 yards, missed from 49
and had a 27-yarder blocked. It was
the seventh time a Stanford kicker
had made four field goals in one game
and the third time Hopkins had done
it. The 54-yarder was also a career
best.
Nine different players caught passes
in the game and Stanford recorded
its two longest plays from scrimmage,
a 41-yard pass to tight end Jim Price
and a 49-yard pass to Walter Hatson.
