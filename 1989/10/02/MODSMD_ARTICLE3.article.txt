Physics Emeritus Prof. William
Fairbank, a pioneer in the study
of low-temperature superconduc
tivity who was known for his en
ergy and engaging attitude toward
students, died Saturday while jog
ging. He was 72.
A nationally-known seniors
runner, Fairbank collapsed at
about 10 a.m. on Alpine Road near
the Stanford campus. A physician
passing by stopped to help but
found no pulse. It was later de
termined that Fairbank died of a
massive heart attack.
Fairbank's work, centering on
the ability of some materials to
offer no resistance to an electrical
current if they are cooled to near
absolute zero — where molecular
activity stops — has been the basis
of hundreds of physics experi
ments.
Physics department faculty
looked to Fairbank for guidance

on diverse topics related to low
temperature physics, and at least
a dozen experiments currently un
derway at Stanford stem from his
work.
"His influence on the depart
ment is incalculable," Physics
Chair Alexander Fetter said last
night. "Stanford would be a very
different place without his influ
ence. He would never relinquish
his enthusiasm or vigor."
Fairbank is survived by his wife
and three sons. Funeral arrange
ments have not been set.
Fairbank was widely known for
his hard work and his dedication
to students. "He was always ready
and willing to talk about physics
with anybody, particularly under
graduates," said Physics Prof.
Walter Meyerhof.
One of Fairbank's graduate stu
dents said Fairbank "never closes
his door to work out a problem.
Progress is always a product of
conversation, and it is difficult or
impossible to break off one of
these conversations. Sometimes

he'll just follow you if you have
an errand across campus, talking
all the way."
A single unifying principle
