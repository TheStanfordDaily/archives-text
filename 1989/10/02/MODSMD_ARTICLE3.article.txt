# Physics pioneer Fairbank dies
## 
### Brad Hayward Jock Friedly Editorial staff 
Physics Emeritus Prof. William
Fairbank, a pioneer in the study
of low-temperature superconduc
tivity who was known for his en
ergy and engaging attitude toward
students, died Saturday while jog
ging. He was 72.
A nationally-known seniors
runner, Fairbank collapsed at
about 10 a.m. on Alpine Road near
the Stanford campus. A physician
passing by stopped to help but
found no pulse. It was later de
termined that Fairbank died of a
massive heart attack.
Fairbank's work, centering on
the ability of some materials to
offer no resistance to an electrical
current if they are cooled to near
absolute zero — where molecular
activity stops — has been the basis
of hundreds of physics experi
ments.
Physics department faculty
looked to Fairbank for guidance

on diverse topics related to low
temperature physics, and at least
a dozen experiments currently un
derway at Stanford stem from his
work.
"His influence on the depart
ment is incalculable," Physics
Chair Alexander Fetter said last
night. "Stanford would be a very
different place without his influ
ence. He would never relinquish
his enthusiasm or vigor."
Fairbank is survived by his wife
and three sons. Funeral arrange
ments have not been set.
Fairbank was widely known for
his hard work and his dedication
to students. "He was always ready
and willing to talk about physics
with anybody, particularly under
graduates," said Physics Prof.
Walter Meyerhof.
One of Fairbank's graduate stu
dents said Fairbank "never closes
his door to work out a problem.
Progress is always a product of
conversation, and it is difficult or
impossible to break off one of
these conversations. Sometimes

he'll just follow you if you have
an errand across campus, talking
all the way."
A single unifying principle


William Fairbank
motivated much of Fairbank's
work. Coined "Fairbank's princi
ple" by colleague Leonard SchifT,
it is that "any experiment can be
done better at a lower tempera
ture."
Other scientists have not only
used this principle to learn more
about the nature of superconduc
tivity but have applied it to re
search in areas ranging from sub
atomic particle composition to
blood flow.
Fairbank provided the basis for
one of Stanford's most ambitious
research projects ever — one cos
ting more than $100 million to
test Einstein's theory of general
relativity.
The experiment, now almost 30
years old, aims to launch a space
satellite containing gyroscopes
lined with the element niobium
and supercooled to detect
previously-undetectable effects of
space-time as Einstein predicted.
In stunning early work at Duke
University, Fairbank discovered
the phase separation of helium-3

and helium-4 and discovered the
superfluid phase transition of
helium — discoveries upon which
the entire subject of low
temperature physics depends.
He also found the flux quan
tization of superconductors, an
event providing the basis for Stan
ford physicist Bias Cabrera's 1982
detection of a monopole, or single
magnetic charge. That discovery,
however, has not been duplicated
or confirmed, and Cabrera him
self has doubted the validity of
his results.
An area in which Fairbank had
a huge influence was gravity wave
detection. As yet scientists have
not been able to measure gravity
waves. But Fairbanks work set
the stage for a current experiment
in the High Energy Physics Lab
oratory in which an aluminum
bar is cooled to the point that its
superconductivity can record the
passing of a gravity wave.
His most recent work included
magnetic resonance imaging, a
process intended to enable physi
cians to obtain better images of
the human heart.
Fairbank used his low
temperature expertise in a search
for an isolated quark, believed to

be the main constituent of matter.
His announcement in 1981 that
he had succeeded caused him
some of his only scientific embar
rassment in an otherwise brilliant
career. The quark theory main
tains that quarks do not exist
alone, and few believed Fairbanks
"discovery."
Fairbank and his graduate stu
dents have been occupied with the
problem ever since, and Fairbank
was actually in his lab at work
on the quark problem the night
before his death.
Born in Minneapolis, Fairbank
graduated in 1939 from Whitman
College in Washington state. He
served at the University of Wash
ington and the Massachusetts In
stitute of Technology before earn
ing his Ph.D. from Yale.
He was assistant professor of
physics at Amherst College from
1947 to 1952 and then moved to
Duke University to become a full
professor. He came to Stanford in
1959.
Fairbank and his brother,
Henry, a professor emeritus of
physics at Duke, performed their
first experiment in superconduc
tivity in 1947, using liquid
helium.

Other scientists have not only
used this principle to learn more
about the nature of superconduc
tivity but have applied it to re
search in areas ranging from sub
atomic particle composition to
blood flow.
Fairbank provided the basis for
one of Stanford's most ambitious
research projects ever — one cos
ting more than $100 million to
test Einstein's theory of general
relativity.
The experiment, now almost 30
years old, aims to launch a space
satellite containing gyroscopes
lined with the element niobium
and supercooled to detect
previously-undetectable effects of
space-time as Einstein predicted.
In stunning early work at Duke
University, Fairbank discovered
the phase separation of helium-3

and helium-4 and discovered the
superfluid phase transition of
helium — discoveries upon which
the entire subject of low
temperature physics depends.
He also found the flux quan
tization of superconductors, an
event providing the basis for Stan
ford physicist Bias Cabrera's 1982
detection of a monopole, or single
magnetic charge. That discovery,
however, has not been duplicated
or confirmed, and Cabrera him
self has doubted the validity of
his results.
An area in which Fairbank had
a huge influence was gravity wave
detection. As yet scientists have
not been able to measure gravity
waves. But Fairbanks work set
the stage for a current experiment
in the High Energy Physics Lab
oratory in which an aluminum
bar is cooled to the point that its
superconductivity can record the
passing of a gravity wave.
His most recent work included
magnetic resonance imaging, a
process intended to enable physi
cians to obtain better images of
the human heart.
Fairbank used his low
temperature expertise in a search
for an isolated quark, believed to

be the main constituent of matter.
His announcement in 1981 that
he had succeeded caused him
some of his only scientific embar
rassment in an otherwise brilliant
career. The quark theory main
tains that quarks do not exist
alone, and few believed Fairbanks
"discovery."
Fairbank and his graduate stu
dents have been occupied with the
problem ever since, and Fairbank
was actually in his lab at work
on the quark problem the night
before his death.
Born in Minneapolis, Fairbank
graduated in 1939 from Whitman
College in Washington state. He
served at the University of Wash
ington and the Massachusetts In
stitute of Technology before earn
ing his Ph.D. from Yale.
He was assistant professor of
physics at Amherst College from
1947 to 1952 and then moved to
Duke University to become a full
professor. He came to Stanford in
1959.
Fairbank and his brother,
Henry, a professor emeritus of
physics at Duke, performed their
first experiment in superconduc
tivity in 1947, using liquid
helium.
Physics Emeritus Prof. William
Fairbank, a pioneer in the study
of low-temperature superconduc
tivity who was known for his en
ergy and engaging attitude toward
students, died Saturday while jog
ging. He was 72.
A nationally-known seniors
runner, Fairbank collapsed at
about 10 a.m. on Alpine Road near
the Stanford campus. A physician
passing by stopped to help but
found no pulse. It was later de
termined that Fairbank died of a
massive heart attack.
Fairbank's work, centering on
the ability of some materials to
offer no resistance to an electrical
current if they are cooled to near
absolute zero — where molecular
activity stops — has been the basis
of hundreds of physics experi
ments.
Physics department faculty
looked to Fairbank for guidance

on diverse topics related to low
temperature physics, and at least
a dozen experiments currently un
derway at Stanford stem from his
work.
"His influence on the depart
ment is incalculable," Physics
Chair Alexander Fetter said last
night. "Stanford would be a very
different place without his influ
ence. He would never relinquish
his enthusiasm or vigor."
Fairbank is survived by his wife
and three sons. Funeral arrange
ments have not been set.
Fairbank was widely known for
his hard work and his dedication
to students. "He was always ready
and willing to talk about physics
with anybody, particularly under
graduates," said Physics Prof.
Walter Meyerhof.
One of Fairbank's graduate stu
dents said Fairbank "never closes
his door to work out a problem.
Progress is always a product of
conversation, and it is difficult or
impossible to break off one of
these conversations. Sometimes

he'll just follow you if you have
an errand across campus, talking
all the way."
A single unifying principle


William Fairbank
motivated much of Fairbank's
work. Coined "Fairbank's princi
ple" by colleague Leonard SchifT,
it is that "any experiment can be
done better at a lower tempera
ture."
Other scientists have not only
used this principle to learn more
about the nature of superconduc
tivity but have applied it to re
search in areas ranging from sub
atomic particle composition to
