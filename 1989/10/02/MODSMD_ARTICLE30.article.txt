# Aerial attack shines
## 
### Mark Rogowsky Senior staff writer 
Amid all the fireworks of Sat
urday's South Bay Shootout, it
would be easy to overlook a
great individual effort.
But when that effort was put
forth by 6-foot-6 wide receiver
Ed McCaffrey, it's hard not to
notice. McCaffrey's all-world
performance was all the more
impressive considering the
junior sat out all of last season
with a thigh iiyury.
In the Cardinal's first three
games, McCaffrey played well
and showed signs of the promise

that he demonstrated as a soph
omore in 1987. McCaffrey
caught 10 passes for 175 yards
in those opening contests.
Saturday, McCaffrey added
another 10 catches for 165 yards
— and his first two touchdowns
of the year. Nearly doubling
one's season totals, especially
when they were as good as
McCaffrey's, in a single game
seems like an impressive
achievement.
McCaffrey, though, was un
moved. "I thought I played OK,"
he said of a performance that
made his injury seem like ancient
history. M [But] winning some foot
ball games is the reason to come
back. Unless we start winning,
it's not going to be too much fun."
"All the statistics mean nothing
when you lose," McCaffrey added.
Aside from his disappointment
about the loss, McCaffrey was also
critical of his play. "I started to
slip," he noted. "I didn't play as
well as I would have liked in the
second half. I thought I missed
the opportunity to make a differ
ence.
Indeed, the entire Cardinal of
fense sputtered in the late going,
but it hardly makes sense to put
the blame on McCaffrey. Quarter
back Steve Smith completed
three-quarters of his passes in the
first 40 minutes and only one
fourth of his attempts in the last
20.
"[San Jose State] changed their
defense in the second half," said
Smith, coming off his best overall
game as a collegian. "They played
almost all nickel and did a lot of
switching between zone and man.
It was hard to tell (what they
were doing)."
In the early going, it didn't mat
ter what the Spartans did. It
seemed like every couple of
minutes Smith hooked up with
McCaffrey for a long gainer. The
tandem was responsible for gains
of 38 and 31 yards in the first
half. McCaffrey had six catches
by halftime.
After the intermission, McCaf
frey caught the ball four more
times, but only one of those came
after the midway point of the
third quarter.
In the fourth, Smith threw the
ball in McCaffrey's direction seven
times and only once did McCaffrey
catch it. Once an official ruled
McCaffrey had trapped the ball
("I thought it was a catch," he
said) and once he simply dropped
it.
The others were errant throws
as a result of Spartan pressure
and the general breakdown of the
Cardinal offense. "We made some
serious mistakes," McCaffrey
said. "We looked good at times;
other times we looked really poor."
He called it a "lack of execu
tion" and laid blame on himself
aria the team at-large.
