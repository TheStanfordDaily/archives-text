Respect your elders. Saturday
morning the women's soccer team
beautifully, although perhaps un
willingly, exhibited utmost elderly
respect at Harry Maloney Field.

Cardinal 4
Alumnae 1

Despite the 4-1 final score, for
nearly the entire first half the
Cardinal women hesitantly
restrained from an aggressive at
tack and struggled against the
alumnae squad. For over 30
minutes neither team could break
the 0-0 deadlock. Then the elder
alumnae, fortified by the addition
of four Stanford seniors, broke the
ice.
Nancy Geisse, Class of 1983 and
a former Ail-American and U.S.
national team player, found a gap
in a confused Cardinal defense 36
minutes into the first half and
skillfully chipped the ball over
charging Cardinal goalie Elise Ed
wards to put the alumnae ahead
1-0.
Recognizing that such tentative
play and respect for this opponent
would create problems, the Car
dinal finally began to exhibit the
aggressive teamwork that has
brought them national recogni
tion.
Five minutes after the first
goal, sophomore Elizabeth Jones
child evened the score by picking
up a ball which had deflected off
the alumnae goalie's hands and
promptly kicked it into the right
side of the goal.
"We seemed really slow early
on," Joneschild said. "People just
didn't seem into the game; we
need to work on starting off more
quickly."
Once Joneschild found the back
of the net, her teammates seemed
ready to follow. Five minutes into
the second half, freshman Julie
Foudy pushed the ball to the right
side of the field where classmate
Carolyn Einstein one-touched the
ball just over the goalie's hands
onto junior Jennifer Rowland's

foot. Rowland pulled in the deflec
tion and banged it into the back
of the goal to give Stanford a 2-1
lead.
"They really began to exhibit
their superior team organization,"
Geisse noticed. "Stanford played
exceptionally well together."
Five minutes after Rowland's
goal, freshman Kirby Seale
crossed the ball from the right
side of the field to junior Jennifer
Bloomer at the top of the penalty
box. Bloomer picked up the pass,
recognized she had the goalie
caught halfway up in the penalty
box, dribbled to her right, find
snuck the ball into the lower right
corner to make the score 3-1.
"Instead of continually trying
to score quickly like we did in the
first half," Joneschild said, "we
began to work a possession game
and utilize the openings. That is
how we would like to play."
Bloomer scored her second goal
of the game 10 minutes later after
Foudy adeptly maneuvered
around two opponents to create
the opening to cross the ball from
the right side of the field. Bloomer
caught Foudy's pass with her
right foot and volleyed the ball
into the net to finish the morn
ing's scoring.
"With our first-string seniors
playing for the other team, we
had the opportunity to allow some
players who have not played ex
tensively to gain some quality
game time," Joneschild said. "Our
entire team needs to be prepared
to play in game situations."
Wednesday afternoon at 3:30
p.m., the lOth-ranked Cardinal (6-
2) will travel to Moraga to con
tinue the regular season against
18th-ranked St. Mary's.
