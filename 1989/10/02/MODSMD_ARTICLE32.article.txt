# Water polo squad sweeps to dual non-league wins
## 
### T.C. Hall Staff writer 
After 17 games in alien envi
ronments, the Stanford men's
water polo team returned home
yesterday and dispensed with
eighth-ranked UC-Santa Barbara
8-6.
The fifth-ranked Cardinal's
first home contest of the 1989
season was a come-from-behind
affair that saw the team trail 3-2
at the half and then outscore the
Gauchos 4-1 in the third quarter
to take control of the game.

"All game I had been talking to
the (team) about tenacity and
toughness, doing all they could
do to get the ball in the goal. I
saw some of that today," said
Coach Dante Dettamanti.
The Stanford win runs the
team's record to 15-3 including
Friday's 13-4 flogging of Fresno
State.
Junior Colin Keely put the Car
dinal on the board two minutes
into the first quarter, scoring on
a two-on-one counterattack. Keely

nullified his efforts by committing
a dead-ball foul that allowed Santa
Barbara a six-on-five advantage
and their first goal. Stanford had
two "power-play" type situations
of its own, but two Jeff Oeding
blocked shots left the score at the
end of the first quarter tied up
at one.
The second quarter opened up
with Stanford controlling the
sprint and getting a quick lob shot
by Chuck Maguy. The shot
typified the Cardinal's first-half
frustrations as it made it over the
outstretched arms of the Gaucho
goalkeeper but did not have
enough juice, as a Santa Barbara
defender scooped the ball out
before it could float over the line.
The gasps from the crowd
turned into cheers soon enough,
however, as Maguy found the net
on Stanford's next six-on-five, and
put the Cardinal up 2-1. Santa
Barbara brushed off its own
missed six on five opportunity by
catching the Stanford defense off
guard, scoring on a long cross-pool
pass on the transition that put
the team uo 3-2 at the half.
Stanford missed on four of five
power-play chances in the first
half while Santa Barbara came up
good on two of their three tries.
Dettamanti attributed this to a

special defense he had been im
plementing, but Santa Barbara
had seen it during their last meet
ing and obviously had acjjusted.
Dettamanti put his men back into
the pool with the standard defense
and a few strong thoughts.
"We should have been ahead
three or four goals at the half,
and they knew it," said Det
tamanti. "We needed a spark in
the game, someone who could
turn it around."
Jon Swerdloff proved he was
ready to be that spark just 15
seconds into the half as he beat
his man on the opening drive and
scooped the ball in to break the
tie and begin a Stanford offensive
onslaught. A Santa Barbara foul
on a Stanford man in position
allowed senior Oeding to put the
team ahead 4-3 on a four-meter
penalty shot.
Santa Barbara came back down
only to have Swerdloff steal the
ball and pass over to Steve Mil
lham open on the wing. Millham
brought the ball in and executed
a perfect lob shot to give the Car
dinal some insurance space and a
5-3 lead. Santa Barbara threat
ened when it scored its only goal
of the quarter on its next six on
five, but Stanford's Greg Olson
ended the threat.
