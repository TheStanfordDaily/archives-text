### David Earnest Senior staff writer 
With the opening of the home
schedule this weekend, the Stan
ford women's volleyball team
hoped that the partisan crowds in
raucous Old Pavilion would help
the team generate some momen
tum going into Thursday night's
match against the second-ranked
UCLA Bruins. But after beating
Oregon State Friday night, the
unranked Oregon Ducks defeated
the Cardinal in a five-game, come
from-behind match.

Ducks 3, Cardinal 2

When senior outside hitter Mic
hele Krebsbach put away Steph
anie Snyder's set at 14-8 in the
fifth game, Oregon capped their
rally to beat Stanford 3-15, 15-9,
9-15, 15-3, 15-8. Oregon overcame
game deficits of 0-1 and 1-2 and
a 6-0 Stanford lead in the second
game to win its second upset of
the weekend.
On Friday night, Oregon sur
prised No. 8 California by sweep
ing the Golden Bears at home,
15-11, 15-13, 15-12. The sixth
ranked Cardinal fell to 8-3 overall
and 4-1 in the Pacific 10 Confer
ence. The Ducks upped their
record to 13-3 with a 3-3 confer
ence mark.
"I think the momentum kind
of swung our way and we took
advantage of it" Oregon Coach
Gerry Gregory said. "Stanford's
got a tremendous team and any
time you beat a team of that
caliber you've got to feel good
about yourself."
Krebsbach may be feeling the
best of all. Although she hit only
.267 for the match, Krebsbach
consistently came up with the big
kills in the fourth and fifth game.
Krebsbach hit through Stanford's
Jessica Benton's block to clinch
game four 15-3 and killed for a

point, side out and match point
in game five.
"I just wasn't holding back [in
game five]. I really wanted to
win," Krebsbach said. "We feel if
we can beat Stanford in their
place, we have the confidence that
we can beat anyone."
After dominating in the first
game, Stanford's passing
struggled and the team was hurt
by service errors. With Stanford
leading 6-1 in game two, sopho
more hitter Amy Cooper served
long to give the ball back to
Oregon, which then tallied 10 con
secutive points and eventually
won the game 15-9.
"We just struggled as a unit,"
Stanford Coach Don Shaw said
after the match. "We couldn't get
anything going offensively and
Oregon took advantage of that.
They played very well."
"Our minds weren't in tonight's
game. I don't know where they
were," freshman hitter Bev Oden
said. "We can't afford to dwell on
what has happened here."
The team will spend the week
preparing for Thursday night's
match against UCLA. The Bruins
and Stanford were tabbed the
preseason favorites in the Pac-10,
but playing well in Los Angeles
after a tough loss may prove to
be too demanding for the Cardi
nal.
"We have to play a lot better
than we did tonight in order to
be successful in L.A.," Shaw said.
"I hope ... we work hard in prac
tice and start feeling better about
ourselves. That's the foremost
thing in my mind right now: Mon
day's practice. It's the next day
we'll have together to try and im
prove as a team."
On Friday night, Stanford won
the inaugural match in the new
Old Pavilion by sweeping Oregon
State 15-10, 15-7, 15-9. Senior hit
ter Laura Olesen hit .291 and
tallied 9 digs to lead the Cardinal
over OSU, which fell to 4-6 on
the season and continues to oc

cupy the Pac-10 cellar.
"We were a little inconsistent
[on Friday night]," Shaw said.
"We had our moments when we
played pretty well, then we had
other moments when we just
bumbled around.
"We just need to be more con
sistent. That's what we're striving
for, to be better every time we
play. We played a lot better (when
we beat Cal last Wednesday), and
that's not what I'm looking for,"
Shaw said.
The Cardinal has three days of
practice to prepare for UCLA and
No. 10 USC, whom Stanford plays
on Friday night. The Trojans and
Bruins may present the toughest

challenge for the Cardinal yet this
season. The two L.A. teams are
undefeated in league play and
Stanford has yet to prove that it
can win consistently. All three of
the Cardinal's losses have been to
teams who were ranked lower
than Stanford or were unranked.
If Stanford is to challenge for
this year's national title, for which
they were considered a strong con
tender in the preseason, the Car
dinal must find more consistency
and beat two talented teams in
front of hostile crowds. If Stanford
cannot play with consistency at
home, as the team demonstrated
this weekend, doing so on the road
may be an impossible task.

the season and continues to oc

cupy the Pac-10 cellar.
"We were a little inconsistent
[on Friday night]," Shaw said.
"We had our moments when we
played pretty well, then we had
other moments when we just
bumbled around.
"We just need to be more con
sistent. That's what we're striving
for, to be better every time we
play. We played a lot better (when
we beat Cal last Wednesday), and
that's not what I'm looking for,"
Shaw said.
The Cardinal has three days of
practice to prepare for UCLA and
No. 10 USC, whom Stanford plays
on Friday night. The Trojans and
Bruins may present the toughest

challenge for the Cardinal yet this
season. The two L.A. teams are
undefeated in league play and
Stanford has yet to prove that it
can win consistently. All three of
the Cardinal's losses have been to
teams who were ranked lower
than Stanford or were unranked.
If Stanford is to challenge for
this year's national title, for which
they were considered a strong con
tender in the preseason, the Car
dinal must find more consistency
and beat two talented teams in
front of hostile crowds. If Stanford
cannot play with consistency at
home, as the team demonstrated
this weekend, doing so on the road
may be an impossible task.

Cardinal hitlers Kristin Klein (16) and Bev Oden (10) elevate for a
block against Oregon State. Klein and Oden fueled the Cardinal
attack to an easy win over the Beavers, but Oregon upset Stanford
Saturday.
With the opening of the home
schedule this weekend, the Stan
ford women's volleyball team
hoped that the partisan crowds in
raucous Old Pavilion would help
the team generate some momen
tum going into Thursday night's
match against the second-ranked
UCLA Bruins. But after beating
Oregon State Friday night, the
unranked Oregon Ducks defeated
the Cardinal in a five-game, come
from-behind match.

When senior outside hitter Mic
hele Krebsbach put away Steph
anie Snyder's set at 14-8 in the
fifth game, Oregon capped their
rally to beat Stanford 3-15, 15-9,
9-15, 15-3, 15-8. Oregon overcame
game deficits of 0-1 and 1-2 and
a 6-0 Stanford lead in the second
game to win its second upset of
the weekend.
On Friday night, Oregon sur
prised No. 8 California by sweep
ing the Golden Bears at home,
15-11, 15-13, 15-12. The sixth
ranked Cardinal fell to 8-3 overall
and 4-1 in the Pacific 10 Confer
ence. The Ducks upped their
record to 13-3 with a 3-3 confer
ence mark.
"I think the momentum kind
of swung our way and we took
advantage of it" Oregon Coach
Gerry Gregory said. "Stanford's
got a tremendous team and any
time you beat a team of that
caliber you've got to feel good
about yourself."
Krebsbach may be feeling the
best of all. Although she hit only
.267 for the match, Krebsbach
consistently came up with the big
kills in the fourth and fifth game.
Krebsbach hit through Stanford's
Jessica Benton's block to clinch
game four 15-3 and killed for a

point, side out and match point
in game five.
"I just wasn't holding back [in
game five]. I really wanted to
win," Krebsbach said. "We feel if
we can beat Stanford in their
place, we have the confidence that
we can beat anyone."
After dominating in the first
game, Stanford's passing
struggled and the team was hurt
by service errors. With Stanford
leading 6-1 in game two, sopho
more hitter Amy Cooper served
long to give the ball back to
Oregon, which then tallied 10 con
secutive points and eventually
won the game 15-9.
"We just struggled as a unit,"
Stanford Coach Don Shaw said
after the match. "We couldn't get
anything going offensively and
Oregon took advantage of that.
They played very well."
"Our minds weren't in tonight's
game. I don't know where they
were," freshman hitter Bev Oden
said. "We can't afford to dwell on
what has happened here."
The team will spend the week
preparing for Thursday night's
match against UCLA. The Bruins
and Stanford were tabbed the
preseason favorites in the Pac-10,
but playing well in Los Angeles
after a tough loss may prove to
be too demanding for the Cardi
nal.
"We have to play a lot better
than we did tonight in order to
be successful in L.A.," Shaw said.
"I hope ... we work hard in prac
tice and start feeling better about
ourselves. That's the foremost
thing in my mind right now: Mon
day's practice. It's the next day
we'll have together to try and im
prove as a team."
On Friday night, Stanford won
the inaugural match in the new
Old Pavilion by sweeping Oregon
State 15-10, 15-7, 15-9. Senior hit
ter Laura Olesen hit .291 and
tallied 9 digs to lead the Cardinal
over OSU, which fell to 4-6 on
the season and continues to oc

cupy the Pac-10 cellar.
