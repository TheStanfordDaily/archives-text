# Booters blanket Texas opponents

Men's soccer Coach Sam Koch
had been worried about how his
team would perform this week
end, as the Cardinal faced 10th
ranked Southern Methodist and
North Texas on an astroturf play
ing surface to complete a grueling
four-game road trip.
But after Stanford's consecutive
1-0 victories in SMU's Letter
man's Classic in Dallas, Koch may
be thinking about installing
astroturf at Maloney Field.

Cardinal 1, Eagles 0

The Cardinal, which raised its
record to 6-4-1 with its third and
fourth straight wins, pulled off a
shocker Friday night to snap the
Mustangs' 12-game unbeaten
streak at Ownby Stadium, which
stretched all the way back to the
1987 NCAA tournament.

Although SMU dominated the
action for most of the match, re
cording three times as many shots
as Stanford, senior goalkeeper
Chris Helling shut down the Mus
tangs with some stellar play in
the net.
Helling, who sat out the previ
ous two games with a broken
finger and a recurring rotator cuff
injury, earned honors as outstand
ing defensive player of the tour
nament.
While Helling and the defense
frustrated the SMU offense, soph
omore midfielder Rhett Harty
broke the deadlock 15 minutes
into the second half, skying above
a crowd to head in a centering
pass from Todd Caven. Harty, who
led the squad in scoring last year
as a freshman, tallied his fourth
goal, to tie him for the team lead.
It looked as if the lead was
short-lived, as the Mustangs'
Patrick Krejs put one past Hel
ling, but Stanford received a break
when the goal was nullified by an
offside penalty. SMU continued to
threaten, but failed to convert on
several golden opportunities.
