# Campbell fires parting shots in report

### Jock Friedly Editorial staff 
In the Hoover Institution's 1988 an
nual report, W. Glenn Campbell issues
his last fiery words as director, reflect
ing on his 30 troublesome years at the
top of the tower.
In the report's introduction, the un
restrainable former director adds more
bitter comments about the long history
of tension between Hoover and Stan
ford. Despite the turbulence, Campbell
calls his career "happy and rewarding,"
giving credit — in his typically loyal
fashion — to the Hoover scholars, to
the staff and to his wife and Hoover
fellow Rita Ricardo-Campbell.
Campbell points to his many successes
as director, including development of
the Hoover libraries, which are the "lar
gest private archival repository in the
United States."

The former director
outlines 30 years of
'harassment' by the
University's adminis
tration and faculty.

During his 30 years, the endowment
of the think tank jumped from $2 mil
lion to $125 million, which he proudly
points out is far larger than the endow
ments of Stanford's Graduate School of
Business, Law School and School of En
gineering.
Campbell attributes the success of
Hoover to the work of his colleagues —
work which he says required "protecting
the integrity of the academic process at

the Hoover Institution from a small,
but significant, cadre of intolerant left
wing professors at Stanford."
The former director outlines 30 years
of "harassment" by the University's ad
ministration and faculty. Among the
casualties Campbell attributes to the
"left-wing" faculty is the Reagan Libra
ry, which was the topic of great debate
a few years ago.
"Motivated by petty partisanship and
political intolerance, the faculty critics
spewed venom hardly becoming to a
great academic institution," he says
about the drive to keep the Reagan
Library from campus.
Campbell also blasts the administra
tion, particularly University President
Donald Kennedy and Board of Trustees
Chair James Gaither, for what he calls
the "grossly unfair" manner in which
