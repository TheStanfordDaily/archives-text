# Grad student copies for African schools
## 
### Lora Dawn Headrick 
Most students are used to spending
significant amounts of money at Kinko's
or Copymat for course readers each
quarter. But some professors are turn
ing to a new student-run copy service
that provides course readers at a lower
cost to students and at the same time
raises money to send textbooks to South
Africa.
Phillip Lawes, a graduate student in
economics, created Paper Tigers copy
service to help fund his non-profit or
ganization, the African Schools Project,
which operates out of the Bechtel In
ternational Center.
The ultimate goal of the project is to
fight South Africa's apartheid policies.

To accomplish this objective, Lawes is
using academia's most powerful weapon
â€” the printed word. So far, Paper Tigers
has made readers for about 25 courses,
he said.
Lawes, a native of Jamaica, aims to
send between 3,000 and 4,000 college
textbooks to South African schools not
funded by the South African govern
ment. According to Lawes, the textbooks
"provide an alternative education to the
government's curriculum." He currently
has about 1,000 books.
Civil Engineering Prof. Gil Masters,
who is using Paper Tigers for his course
readers this year, said, "I thought it
was a neat idea . . . and I'd rather have
my readers made on campus."
Likewise, History Asst. Prof. Richard

Roberts said Paper Tigers' link to the
African Books Project was the "primary
reason" he chose it to make his course
readers. "Anybody that does good work
like that is worth supporting," he said.
Both professors said that another fac
tor in their decision was that ASSU
Lecture Notes is no longer making
course readers.
Last year 12 students were involved
with the project, accepting contributions
from large book donors such as the Stan
ford Bookstore, Sacramento State Uni
versity and other organizations which
have donated as many as 30 or 40 cases
of books at a time.
Lawes, who is taking time off from
school to single-handedly run the
project, hopes to send a 20-foot
shipping container of books to
South Africa by mid-November.
Lawes estimates that the cost
of the shipping will run above
$4,000. In order to meet this ex
pense, Lawes operates the copy
service. According to Lawes, the
cost of a reader rilns betwen $5.25
and $43, depending on how much
material the professor wants in
cluded. Paper Tigers' base rate is
2.75 cents per page.
While Paper Tigers has helped

raise some funds needed to ship
the books to South Africa, Lawes
knows that proceeds will not be
able to cover the total cost. "I've
been seeking private donations
and I think the money will come,"
he said.
In the meantime, Lawes sug
gests that students who are inter
ested in the project participate in
a book-sorting slated to take place
in early November. "Sorting 4,000
book isn't a one-person job," he
said.
In the next few weeks, Lawes
will be asking various on-campus
groups to pledge one or two hours
of sorting. "If we have enough
help, it could all be done in a
day,"he said.
