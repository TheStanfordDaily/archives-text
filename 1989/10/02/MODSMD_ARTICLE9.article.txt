Student ii\jured in car encounter
Stanford freshman Scott Minkow, 18, was hit
by a pick-up truck on Junipero Serra Boulevard
near the intersection of Campus Drive East early
Friday morning.
Minkow, a Branner Hall resident, was "heavily
intoxicated" at the time of the 1:12 a.m. accident,
according to Capt. Marvin Moore of the Stanford
Police Department. Moore said Minkow was
"pretty banged up" but did not sustain any life
threatening injuries.
Minkow was taken to Stanford University
Hospital by Palo Alto aid units and was in stable
condition by Friday afternoon. He was released
Sunday.
Hospital officials would not reveal the nature
of Minkow's injuries pending investigation of the
incident. The California Highway Patrol will be
investigating the case, though a spokesman said
Friday an accident report had not yet been filed.
Details of the accident were not available.

Man reveals all to jogger
Stanford Police are warning female visitors to
the Foothills to be on the lookout for a man who
wants to offer an unexpected view.
A female jogger encountered the man on a trail
near the Dish Thursday at about 5:30 p.m., said
Stanford Police Chief Marv Herrington. The man
"indecently exposed himself' to her before fleeing
down the trail.
Police have received other similar complaints
in recent months, though it is unlikely that the
same man is involved in all incidents, Herrington
said.
The man involved in Thursday's incident is
described as a 30-year-old white male, six feet
in height and weighing 195 pounds. He has light
brown, medium-length hair with a full beard and

appeared dissheveled. Wearing a tan shirt and
dark shorts, he was riding a dark-colored moun
tain bike.

Panic attack victims sought
If you sometimes experience panic attacks —
and not just before the final you didn't prepare
for — Stanford University Medical Center wants
you.
Volunteers are being sought for two separate
studies. The first, for volunteers between 18 and
65 years of age, will involve a new medication
to treat panic. Volunteers should be able to take
oral medication and have recently experienced
panic attacks.
In the second study, physicians are seeking
people suffering from panic who have adolescent
children. (You don't suppose there's a connec
tion. . ..)
For more information, call 725-8773.
