The new sound in music:

*v.v
Music Industry:
Listen to the new sound. Hear who the music world is
putting down. It's called bigotry and it goes something like
this. "Niggers... get outta my way/Don't need to buy none/
Of your gold chains today" and "Jews are wicked... (re
sponsible for) a majority of wickedness that goes on across
the globe."
The first quote is lyrics. Frightening enough in itself, but
the fact that it comes from a Guns and Roses album that
sold 9 million copies, is worse.
The second quote was actually given in an interview in
the Washington Times by "Professor Griff" from the popu
lar rap group Public Enemy.
Have we, as a nation, grown apathetic about the racial,
religious and sexual bias that is beginning to permeate our
society?
What happened to the good old days when the music in
dustry was THE voice of positive social change?
When Dylan sang "The Times, They Are 'A Changing",
he meant for the better, and the music industry was behind
that. Music like "Give Peace A Chance" spread love, instead
of hate.
The music industry is powerful. It can, and has, made
a difference. Isn't it about time that it takes a firm stand
against the immoral spread of hatred and bigotry? If we all
work together, "We Shall Overcome" once again.
