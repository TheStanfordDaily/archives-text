# Spring opening for Chile
## Kyoto, Santiago added to Overseas opportunities 
### Gregory Nailer 
While students have already
headed to the Far East for the
opening of the University's largest
overseas center in Kyoto, Japan,
others will soon be able to make
plans to go south of the equator
to Chile.
Last year, the Overseas Studies
program had planned to open its
first Latin America program in
Buenos Aires, Argentina, but,
largely due to the unstable polit
ical situation there, decided in
mid-September to move its pilot
program to Santiago, Chile.
Counting on the continued fa
vorable political and economic
climate of Chile in the next year,
in addition to abundant interest
and enthusiasm for the program
here on campus, Director of the
Latin America Program Edmundo
Fuenzalida plans to take the first
group of participants in the Latin
America program this spring.
The Chile program is designed
and operated in association with
Chile's Catholic University and
will use that institution's facili
ties.
The Stanford Japan center,
where students are already in
their residences, will hold its of
ficial opening Nov. 12 when the
construction of all facilities will
be complete.
The date was chosen, according

to Law Prof. Tom Heller, director
of the Overseas Studies Center,
because it "is considered in
Japanese culture to be a day of
especially good fortune for the
launching of new enterprises."
Many of the classrooms are not
yet complete, and classes are
being held in temporary facilities.
The permanent center is being
funded largely by Japanese con
tributions of about $6 million.
Heller said the Japan center is
located "in one of the richest and
most traditional cultural areas of
the country," while the Chile pro
gram will be in"the center of all
social studies for the region."
Aside from their shared purpose
to "expand the breadth and depth

of the undergraduate's curricu
lum," the two campuses differ in
many ways.
"They are similar in the fact
that they both aim to achieve
overseas the kind of learning en
vironment that we have here at
home," Heller said. "But they dif
fer in approach because the cam
puses themselves are located in
very different environments."
The Japan center offers two
programs for Stanford students.
The first program focuses on the
language and cultural aspects of
the country and is described by
Heller as "the program focusing
exclusively on Japanese studies."
