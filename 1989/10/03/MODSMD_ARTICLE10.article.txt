# Unhoused papers may get offices

Currently unhoused student
publications might get space of
their own soon, thanks to the
Stanford Student Directory.
This year's directory profits
may help fund renovation of the
Storke Annex, a wing of the
Storke Publications Building, and
construction of a new building for
currently unhoused student or
ganizations.
The directory, a non-profit pub
lication published annually, lists
student phone numbers and ad
dresses, student services and
other organizations. It also con
tains yellow pages, recruiter ads,
a dining guide, a San Francisco
activity section and, this year, an
enlarged coupon section.
"Revenue from ads pays for the
whole thing," said junior Morris
Sim, project manager for the di
rectory. "The University doesn't
give us anything except for office
space."
Although the directory is man

have a crying need
for more space.'

aged by students, it is under the
supervision of Student Organiza
tion Services as well as the
Registrar's Office. Money the di
rectory makes goes to SOS.
Profit from the previous year
is used for production of the di
rectory the next year. Anything
over operating costs helps fund
student groups, according to Mi
chael Ramsey-Perez, director of
SOS.
"New publications have a
crying need for more space. Con
verting the Storke Annex into a
better shared activities center
along with building some more
space would help," Ramsey-Perez
said.
The Storke Building is located

across from the Terman Engi
neering Center. Currently the
Storke Building houses The Stan-i
ford Daily, The Chaparral and The'
Stanford Quad.
Publications which would ben
efit from the renovation include
Dial Tone, Sequoia, The Stanford
Review and Release Magazine.
Organizers say this year's di-.
rectory will be distributed during
Big Game Week in November.

For the record

A story on research overhead
costs in yesterday's Daily may
have misled some readers.
The story should have stated
that for every $1 campus scien
tists spend to perform research,
the University requires an addi
tional 74 cents for administrative
and other indirect costs. It is gen
erally not the case that the Uni
versity takes away 74 percent of
researchers' grant monies.
