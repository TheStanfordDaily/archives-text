## Gorbachev seeks strike ban 
### 
MOSCOW (AP) — President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev urged the
legislature yesterday to impose a
15-month ban on strikes that he
says are wrecking the Soviet eco
nomy and threatening develop
ment.
• Gorbachev spoke at the end of
a stormy two-hour legislative
debate on a proposal of emergency
economic measures put forward
by First Deputy Premier Lev
Voronin, the Tass news agency
said.
Gorbachev urged legislators to
discuss the strike ban overnight
and be ready to vote on it today.
He referred to the possible ban
on strikes as a "necessary mea
sure .... which are called for to
protect democratization from
anarchy and irresponsible man
agement."
Plans for future economic de
velopment are "under threat" be
cause of the strikes, he said.
• Emergency measures to bolster
the rapidly faltering economy
bvershadowed Premier Nikolai I.
ilyzhkov's lengthy presentation of
fei package of legislation covering
the government's long-term pro
posals on property, ownership and
Use of land, and taxes.
• Voronin told the legislature the
Soviet economy had lost $6.15 bil
lion in July and August alone due
to strikes and that supplies of fuel
are low enough that the country
might be unable to supply enough
heat to see Soviet citizens through
the winter.

The most damaging of a series
of strikes to hit the Soviet Union
this year was a walkout in July
by thousands of coal miners in
the far north, Siberia, and the
Don Basin of the eastern Ukraine.
That strike alone cost the coun
try millions of rubles, and the
government agreed to a package
of economic and social improve
ments that officials say will cost
about $3 billion.
Strikes also have become a way
of expressing ethnic discontent.
Such actions have idled the
Nagorno-Karabakh region, the
center of a dispute between the
neighboring Caucasus republics of
Armenia and Azerbaijan.
In Moldavia and Estonia, Rus
sian and other workers walked off
jobs at factories and offices during
the summer to protest laws that
they said favored the majority
Moldavians and Estonians.
After legislators expressed con
tradictory viewpoints during a
debate, Gorbachev proposed they
return today to vote on the strike
ban, and an overwhelming
msyority agreed, Tass said.
The package of government pro
posals also calls for imposing a
"special form of administration"
on railroads in Armenia and Azer
baijan, with the ministries of rail
roads, defense and interior re
sponsible for protecting the rail
roads and their workers.
Armenian activists say Azer
baijani railroad workers recently
have blocked the trains that Ar

menia depends upon for 80 per
cent of the goods brought in from
other parts of the Soviet Union.
Food stores have been emptied
of many basic goods and there is
no fuel even for vehicles such as
ambulances.
Gorbachev said when the Su
preme Soviet opened its fall ses
sion Sept. 25 that decisive steps
would have to be taken if rails to
Armenia were not cleared.
Ryzhkov and radical deputies
both named the law on property
as the most important of five key
economic reforms presented to the
legislature, but they disagreed on
what it should say.
Ryzhkov said the central gov
ernment must learn to refrain
from interfering in local economic
affairs — including its tendency
to claim all forms of property for
itself.
"As long as about 90 percent of
the basic means of production
belong in the framework of one
owner — the government — all
talk about developing a market
will remain empty words, and
progress is impossible," he said.
But progressive Deputy Anatoly
Sobchak of Leningrad said the
government's proposal still started
from the point of view that the
state had priority of ownership,
and individuals were last.
He said it should be just the
opposite.
Ryzhkov said the government
saw no reason to allow private
ownership of land.
