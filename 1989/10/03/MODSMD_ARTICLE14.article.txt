# Mubarak and Bush strive for better Israeli-Palestinian relations
## 
### 
; WASHINGTON (AP) - Egyptian P res "
ident Hosni Mubarak met with President
Bush yesterday on Mideast peace efforts
and said he saw a "golden opportunity"
for a breakthrough between Israel and
the Palestinians.
Mubarak said failing to seize the op
portunity "would be a grave mistake"
and that he and Bush agreed "to work
closely together in order to utilize the
existing momentum."
"The continuation of the status quo is
hazardous to both" Israel and the Pal
estinians, the Egyptian leader told
reporters after an Oval Office session
lasting nearly an hour.
However, even as Mubarak sought to
promote his plan, which includes a
demand that Israel agree in principal to
giving up seized lands, aides to Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir said the Israeli
leader does not intend to alter his own
Palestinian peace initiative.
Monday's White House session came
amid new concern that settling Jewish
immigrants from the Soviet Union in the
Israeli-occupied West Bank could

'We believe the poten
tial is great for further
progress.... It would
be a grave mistake to
miss the golden oppor
tunity existing today.'
— Hosni Mubarak

threaten peace efforts.
Bush administration officials reacted
coolly to an Israeli request for $400 mil
lion in housing loan guarantees for about
100,000 Jewish emigres from the Soviet
Union. Israeli officials have said some
dwellings probably will be in the West
Bank.
"The United States policy is to oppose
additional settlements in the occupied ter
ritories," Secretary of State James A.

Baker 111 said. And presidential press
secretary Marlin Fitzwater declared,
"Our policy is we don't allow U.S. aid to
be used for resettlement in the West
Bank."
Still, Baker and Mubarak were both
upbeat about peace prospects.
"I think it's fair to say that we all hope
that conditions exist for progress," said
Baker.
The Egyptian president, after his meet
ing with Bush, Baker and Vice President
Dan Quayle, said: "We believe the poten
tial is great for further progress. . . It
would be a grave mistake to miss the
gnlderi opportunity existing today."
In Jerusalem, Yossi Ahimeir, a spokes
man for Shamir, said the Israeli leader
does not intend to alter his own peace
plan despite pressure from Egypt, the
United States or the rival Israeli Labor
Party.
"Only five months have passed" since
Shamir presented his plan for electrons
as a first step toward negotiations, and
the prime minister "does not see any
reason to change it,"the spokesman said.

Shamir's plan calls for elections in the
occupied territories to choose delegates
for negotiations with Israel. However,
final status on the lands occupied by
Israel since the 1967 Middle East war
would be decided later.
Mubarak told reporters here the essen
tial next step in the peace process is to
persuade the Israelis and the Palestinians
to enter into a dialogue "without
preconditions."
Mubarak's meeting came as the United
States was seeking to persuade a reluc
tant Israel to open discussions with Pal
estinians basefl on Mubarak's proposals.
U.S. officials fegard the 10-point Egyp
tian plan as a complement to Shamir's
proposal for elections in which Palestin
ians would select representatives to ne
gotiate with Israel on limited self
government in the occupied territories.
"The Egyptian ten points .... do not
represent a competing proposal. They rep
resent a means of getting a dialogue es
tablished," Baker said yesterday.
Mubarak made a similar comment.
A key element of Mubarak's proposal

is the convening of talks between Israelis
and Palestinians in Cairo — so far
resisted by Shamir. The Israeli leader
also opposes Mubarak's suggestion that
voting rights be extended to Arabs living
in East Jerusalem and to Palestinians
who live outside the occupied territories.
And Shamir has rejected Mubarak's
suggestion that the outcome of any ne
gotiations be self-determination for the
Palestinians.
On prospects of a summit with Shamir,
Mubarak noted that he had talked to
Shamir by phone last Friday and dis
cussed preparations for such a meeting.
But, he said, "such a meeting should
come out of something. Otherwise, it
would have negative reactions from the
peoples of both sides. I don't want to
make complications. That's why any
meeting needs a thorough preparation."
Quayle, meanwhile, told reporters at a
luncheon on Monday that the adminis
tration would be "very supportive ....
(of) a dialogue between Shamir and
Mubarak that can be meaningful."
