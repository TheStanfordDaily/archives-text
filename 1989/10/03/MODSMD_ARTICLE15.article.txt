Calderon freed
PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) - Op
position leader Ricardo Arias Calderon
and eight companions were freed after
being held 20 hours and questioned
about their efforts to curtail the gov
ernment's funds, the Defense Forces
announced Monday.
However, Attorney General Carlos
Villalaz said by telephone all nine still
face charges of "crimes against the
state, crimes against the administra
tion of justice and crimes against the
national economy."
Arias, a former vice presidential can
didate, was arrested Sunday while in
Veraguas province, 180 miles west of
the capital, to promote the opposition
campaign against the government con
trolled by Gen. Manuel Antonio Nor
iega.
A statement by former presidential
candidate Guillermo Endara said the
opposition "reiterates its promise to
keep fighting for the establishment of
a democratic system of government
and full respect for human rights by
the peaceful means we have been fol
lowing, despite the escalation of vio
lations and attacks from the dic
tatorial regime."
Arias and Endara, who is in the
13th day of a hunger strike, are urging
supporters to delay paying taxes and
utility bills and to boycott the state
controlled lottery and gambling

casinos to increase pressure on the
government, which has been badly
hurt by U.S. economic sanctions.
Bloody Sunday
COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) — Thirty
one people died in the bloodiest 24-
hour period since the government
declared a unilateral cease-fire last
week, military officials reported yes
terday.
Twenty-four people were murdered
by Sinhalese radicals, six were killed
by soldiers they had ambushed, and
a jailed Sinhalese extremist commit
ted suicide, the officials said.
A soldier and a child were wounded
in the ambush Sunday at Girikola
village, 25 miles south of Colombo,
said the officials, whose names cannot
be used under briefing rules.
The deaths brought the total to 59
since the government proclaimed the
cease-fire Wednesday. It originally was
called for three days, then extended
until 6 a.m. Tuesday.
President Ranasinghe Premadasa
instructed the military to halt oper
ations against members of the
People's Liberation Front, a Sinhalese
radical group, but said they were al
lowed to defend themselves.
He declared the truce to give the
radicals among the Sinhalese, Sri
Lanka's predominant ethnic group, an

opportunity to end their 2-year-old
uprising and join peace talks. At least
5,000 people have been killed in the
violence.
New British arms policy
LONDON (AP) — In a major policy
reversal, the opposition Labor Party
dropped its once-cherished policy of
unilateral nuclear disarmament.
At its annual conference, the
socialist movement voted to adopt a
new platform that would commit a
Labor government to scrapping Brit
ain's nuclear weapons only in a
negotiated arms deal.
Ditching the non-nuclear doctrine,
which had been a factor in Labor's
successive defeats by Conservative
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher
since losing power in 1979, is part of
a mfyor policy overhaul.
Anti-nuclear activists had accused
the party of betraying its principles.
"Britain does not need nuclear
weapons; there is no Soviet nuclear
threat," declared Tony Benn, a former
Cabinet minister and veteran left
wing legislator, during a some
times impassioned debate.
The delegates voted by 3.6 million
to 2.4 million for the new policy, after
moderate trade union leaders swung
the huge votes of their entire mem
berships behind party leader Neil Kin
nock.
