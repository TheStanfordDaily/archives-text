# Supreme Court will decide sobriety checkpoint case
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme
Court, embarking on a term laced with
controversial issues, said yesterday it will
decide whether police nationwide may use
sobriety checkpoints in trying to curb
drunken drivers.
The case accepted by the court, which
poses the question of whether police offi
cers may use checkpoints to spot drunken
drivers, presents the latest test of strength
for the court's newly solidified conservative
majority.
Michigan courts struck down that state's
sobriety checkpoint program as an uncon
stitutional invasion of privacy, but courts
in other states have upheld virtually identi
cal police tactics.
In its usual start-of-term flurry, the
court issued orders in more than 1,000
cases — denying review to most and agree
ing to study 22. They will be among 150
or so disputes to be decided by the end of
the term in July.
The use of police sobriety checkpoints in
Michigan was attacked shortly after state
police began using them in 1986. The pro
gram was modeled after one used in Mar
yland.
At a checkpoint site, police directed all
traffic headed in one direction to a roadside
area where officers checked motorists for
signs of intoxication.
If there was no immediate evidence of
intoxication, the motorist was given a traf
fic safety brochure and allowed to drive

away. The average delay was about 30
seconds.
At one such checkpoint, Michigan state
police troopers checked 126 vehicles in less
than an hour and detained two drivers for
sobriety field tests. One driver was arrested
on drunken-driving charges.
The state police department was sued
soon after the checkpoint program began.
The lawsuit alleged that the checkpoints
violated the Fourth Amendment's ban on
unreasonable police searches and seizures.
State courts banned the checkpoints,
citing "the potential for an unreasonable,
subjective intrusion on individual liberty
interests."
In defending the checkpoint program,
Michigan Attorney General Frank Kelley
told the justices that fighting drunken
driving is a "grave and legitimate public
interest."
He said Michigan's checkpoint program
is valid even if it is not the most effective
police procedure available or may carry the
"potential of generating fear and surprise
in some motorists."
Lawyers for those who successfully chal
lenged the checkpoint program urged the
justices to reject the appeal.
They said the "warrantless, suspicionless
seizure" of a vehicle at a sobriety check
point could lead to drivers and passengers
being required to get out and being sub
jected to pat-down searches. They said
police officers may use such occasions to
inspect a vehicle's contents.
