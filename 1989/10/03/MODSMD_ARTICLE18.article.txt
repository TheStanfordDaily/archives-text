## Justice for Jackson 
### 
Stanford should stand
up for equal treatment
in Louis Jackson case

LOUIS JACKSON is clearly
being unfairly singled out by
Santa Clara County for his
participation in the May 15
takeover of University President
Donald Kennedy's office. Jackson,
the only black male protester who
spoke outside Building 10, is now
facing six misdemeanor charges —
including battery and incitement
to riot — and a possible jail sen
tence of two years.
The female receptionist in Ken
nedy's office against whom Jackson
allegedly committed battery has
signed a civil compromise agree
ment saying she never felt threat
ened by Jackson and has no com
plaint against him.
The same police report that cites
Jackson for inciting the crowd to
riot notes that others incited the
crowd as well. Jackson has been
identified from a video tape made
by Stanford police. Others appar
ently could not be identified from
the tape.
The police report says that Jack
son was known by name and by
several arresting officers for his
involvement in previous demon
strations. Jackson is a prominent
leader in the Black Student Union
and is well-known on campus for
his activism.
It is all too plausible that the
Stanford police targeted Jackson
because they see him only as a
black militant leader — a mislead
ing stereotype which carries ugly
racial overtones.
The district attorney's decision
to press charges against Jackson
was based upon a reading of the
Stanford police's report of the May
15 takeover. In the report, an ar

resting officer recommends to the
district attorney that Jackson be
charged.
Some would argue that Jack
son's treatment is not racist be
cause many of the other arrestees
were students of color. However,
the historical baggage carried by
the black militant radical stereo
type could have affected his treat
ment and not that of other students
of color.
Meanwhile,' Kennedy and other
administrators have been hiding
behind the University's Policy on
Arrests and Prosecutions.
Drafted in 1985, the policy states
that the University follows a gen
eral policy of non-interference once
arrests have been made at student
demonstrations. The rationale: It
is inappropriate for the University
to make a judgment that the par
ticular concerns of one group are
so important compared to those of
another that the Unversity should
support a dismissal of charges.
It is ludicrous, however, for Ken
nedy not to speak out against the
injustices being imposed upon
Jackson.
At the very least, Kennedy
should make it clear to the district
attorney that the University will
not tolerate the selective prosecu
tion of Jackson for the contrived
charges of battery and incitement
to not and that Jackson's treat
ment should not differ from that
of the other protesters.
The administration's com
placency thus far has sent a chilling
message to students of color at
Stanford. If the University is truly
committed to the vision of a mul
ticultural community, where
people of all color are treated fairly
under the law, then something
ought to be done here.
There comes a time when a Uni
versity needs to back up its lofty
rhetoric with concrete commit
ment.
