Academics must become focus of Stanford in 1990s

WITH THE beginning of a new
academic year, the entire Stan
ford community is faced with
one of its greatest challenges, and at
the same time, one of its greatest
opportunities: to determine the direc
tion and mode in which Stanford will
enter the 19905.
Although it is undoubtedly true that
education, politics and social progress
are all erueial issues in a diverse com
munity such as Stanford, it is also
true that a delicate balance must be
preserved for the community to move
forward. The time is right for aca
demic excellence to reemerge as an
issue of public focus.
If Stanford is to retain its preemi
nence as an academic institution, and
at the same time become a model
community through utilization of its
diversity, the members of the commu
nity must actively seek to attain that
goal. Members of the Stanford commu

nity can no longer look at issues
through the narrow lens of interest
groups, but rather, must recognize the
interdependence of all aspects of our
community.
There is little question that Stan
ford's reputation has suffered as a
consequence of the turmoil during
recent years. Academic excellence and
progressive social policy, however, are
not mutually exclusive.
Certain common sense guidelines will
have to be followed by all interested
parties if Stanford is to regain direc
tion, and at the same time, to obtain
an optimal solution.
First, all groups should commit
themselves to limiting their discussion
and activities to constructive forums. It
is primarily the University's responsi
bility to ensure that these avenues
exist, and conversely, student groups
must first seek solutions within this
framework.

The media should not be the prin
cipal avenue for airing dissatisfaction.
Conversely, both sides must dedicate
themselve to the creation of alterna
tive, more constructive means of dis
cussion and debate.
The sit-in last spring, though pos
sessing justifiable cause, is the type of
activity that must be replaced by a
constructive and cooperative dialogue.
This is the first step towards a unified
community.
Second, those striving for change
must attempt to be explicit in what
they seek. To demand change and
expect it is inappropriate when the
precise nature of the changes is un
clear. Specific demands, however, can
be addressed in a constructive manner.
A willingness to compromise must
accompany the transition from ambigu
ous statements to specific requests.
Once again, this willingness must be
multilateral.

Most importantly, though, the discus
sion, and when necessary, the debate,
must be framed in terms of the best
long-term academic interests of Stan
ford. Social and academic progress can
no longer be viewed as separate or
mutually exclusive entities.
Academic preeminence is the founda
tion from which Stanford derives the
strength to make difficult changes.
Similarly, constructive change contri
butes to the academic potential of
Stanford. Disunity and disputes, how
ever, are detrimental to both.
The atmosphere in which the Stan
ford community conducts its activities
— political, educational and social — ie
directly influenced by the approach
employed by interested individuals and
groups. This is another arena in which
Stanford can and should be the leader
in finding a constructive solution.
