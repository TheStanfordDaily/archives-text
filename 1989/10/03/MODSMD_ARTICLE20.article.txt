# Death penalty isn't everything Tucker makes it out to be
## 
### 
William Tucker's Viewpoint "Whose
Death Penalty Is It, Anyway?" no
doubt accurately captures some of the
public fears that underlie the over
whelming m£yority support for the
death penalty. However, its justification
for that support is misleading.
For one thing, Tucker suggests that
rising public support for capital pun
ishment is an understandable, if not
entirely logical, response to increasing
criminal violence in the United States.
However, a very large fraction of the
increase in public support for the
death penalty from a low point in the
1960*8 to a high point today occurred

during a stretch of years from about
1979 until about 1987 when violent
crime and homicide rates in the United
States actually declined.
One problem in drawing inferences
from the public's perception of increas
ing crime is that the American public
is always perceiving an increase in
crime, even when crime is decreasing.
Second, Tucker notes that one of the
common justifications for the death
penalty is its power as a general deter
rent. Though he does not expressly
subscribe to this view, he implies some
sympathy for it. In that context, he
should have noted the pretty well
established consensus of social scien
tists that the death penalty does not
deter homicide any more effectively
than life imprisonment.
Two of the categories of killers cited,
drug dealers and Mafia killers, are
likely to be particularly unheedful of

the threat of the ultimate sanction,
especially since they have more imme
diate threats of annihilation to worry
about.
Indeed, at least respectable anecdotal
evidence suggests that instituting capi
tal punishment in a particular jurisdic
tion may temporarily increase the
homicide rate there — by inspiring and
emboldening angry people with the
image of state-sanctioned killing.
Tucker's key point seems to be that
the state ought to carry out executions
to symbolically reassure its frightened
citizens that it is still the main politi
cal force to be reckoned with. He may
be right, but there's a dificult empiri
cal question as to whether this largely
symbolic gesture is the reassurance the
populace really wants — or more im
portantly — really needs.
