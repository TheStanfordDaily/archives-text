## A 						day in the life of a tough journalist 
### 
VETERAN journalists like to think
they've seen it all. they enter the
newsroom with a sort of swagger;
approach the assignment desk as if to
say, what's it going to be today? Give me
a fire, a plane crash, a snowstorm. . . .
"Nothing can shock me anymore," says
Julie, who started reporting for KING-5
news straight out of college and has been
here ever since. She looks at me through
her dark sunglasses. "When you've been
in the business 25 — make that 20 —
years longer, you come back and tell me
if anything can surprise you."
Oh yeah? Julie didn't look so cool when
we all stood swearing around the radio
that morning in July — hearing about
what was to become the shocker of the
summer.
I had walked in late and saw that
Something Big Was Happening. I tapped
Randy on the shoulder. As assignment
editor, it's Randy's job to know every
thing.
"Larry Sturholm was murdered this
morning, " he said in a low voice. Oh
hhhh. Big news. I nodded. Uh-huh. A
few minutes went by. Tact is not a
newsroom specialty.
"Who's Larry Sturholm?"
Everyone in Seattle knew by the end
of that day. The funny, energetic features
reporter from our competition across
town — KIRO Channel 7 News — had
been murdered by a jealous rival in a
love triangle. As the lurid details
emerged, we found that Sturholm had
been at home with his lover, nurse
Deborah Sweigert, when her enraged ex
boyfriend William Pawlyk burst in with

Those of us in the newsroom, we're different.
Weather-beaten. Hardened Another murder,
another day, right? Still... when something shocking
happens to one of our own, we're reminded we're not
so tough.

a knife — and stabbed both of them to
death. Ick. It made a great lead though.
Suddenly in the lazy days of summer we
had a big story.
Those of us on the desk — Randy and
me — knew that was going to mean a
lot of calls. Within minutes after KING
aired an update, the phones lit up with
callers anxious for more details.
"Is this KING?" one elderly woman's
voice quavered over the line.
Yes. . ..
"Oh, I just wanted to say how terribly,
terribly sorry I am about your weather
man," she said, her voice breaking.
Say what?
She must be thinking of our early
morning weatherman, the comic and
slightly goofy Larry Shick.
You must be thinking. . . .
"Oh, thank goodness," she exclaimed.
Yes, our Larry is fine.
"I just love Larry Shick," she contin
ued.
That's nice.
"He just seems like — like if you had
a picnic, he would bring the wood," she
went on tearfully.
0k....
Now, I didn't make that up. That

woman actually thinks of Larry Shick as
someone who would be honored to haul
wood at her family outing.
And why not? Challenge any bleary
eyed resident in your home to look as
cheery and welcoming (even well-dressed)
at 5:45 a.m. every morning. Not to men
tion nice. Hey, this guy beats family any
day. Larry, come on into my living room.
Every day!
But those of us in the newsroom, we're
different. Weather-beaten. Hardened. We
know what Larry looks like at 5:30 a.m.
when he comes in. We see him through
a fog of suicides and car accidents droning
on through the scanners every day.
Another murder, another day, right?.
Still .. . when something shocking
happpens to "one of our own," those of
us in the newsroom are reminded we'iie
not so tough. Even Julie. She's seen a
lot. But she can't see what will happen
this fall.
Our Larry, however, is fine, thank you.

voice quavered over the line.
Yes. . ..
"Oh, I just wanted to say how terribly,
terribly sorry I am about your weather
man," she said, her voice breaking.
Say what?
She must be thinking of our early
morning weatherman, the comic and
slightly goofy Larry Shick.
You must be thinking. . . .
"Oh, thank goodness," she exclaimed.
Yes, our Larry is fine.
"I just love Larry Shick," she contin
ued.
That's nice.
"He just seems like — like if you had
a picnic, he would bring the wood," she
went on tearfully.
0k....
Now, I didn't make that up. That

woman actually thinks of Larry Shick as
someone who would be honored to haul
wood at her family outing.
And why not? Challenge any bleary
eyed resident in your home to look as
cheery and welcoming (even well-dressed)
at 5:45 a.m. every morning. Not to men
tion nice. Hey, this guy beats family any
day. Larry, come on into my living room.
Every day!
But those of us in the newsroom, we're
different. Weather-beaten. Hardened. We
know what Larry looks like at 5:30 a.m.
when he comes in. We see him through
a fog of suicides and car accidents droning
on through the scanners every day.
Another murder, another day, right?.
Still .. . when something shocking
happpens to "one of our own," those of
us in the newsroom are reminded we'iie
not so tough. Even Julie. She's seen a
lot. But she can't see what will happen
this fall.
Our Larry, however, is fine, thank you.
