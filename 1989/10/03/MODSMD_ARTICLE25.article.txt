## Problem of homelessness touches one Stanford student 
### 
"Tell me where a homeless shelter
is," screamed a woman who was
wrapped in layers of torn, lice-infested
winter clothing.
It was sweltering in Washington,
D.C., probably with 90 percent
humidity. As the homeless woman slug
gishly walked along the aisle of the
bus and demanded the driver to take
her to a nearby shelter, I pretended
that she was invisible. The woman's
voice grew louder and louder, but all
of us in the bus continued to ignore
her.
I was in D.C. as a summer intern,
conducting some research on the
health care provision under the
Stewart McKinney Homeless Assistance
Act, but that morning all I could think
about was getting off at the next bus
stop.
Besides feeling physically intimidated,
I wanted to get away from a possibly
complicated situation to enjoy the city
before the hustle and bustle of life
filled the sidewalks.
That morning I did manage to es
cape from the bus, but I could not
escape from the image of the homeless

woman in my mind. I wondered
whether she had a family of her own,
a partner in life or a child she gave
birth to. Countless questions were
asked, but none could be answered.
Articles on homelessness used to
cover the front pages of many msyor
publications two years ago. It seems
that issues concerning homelessness
lost in a popularity contest. The faces
of the homeless are no longer staring
at us from the covers of magazines or
the pages of newspapers.
Even though it is no longer a
"trendy" issue, the problem of home
lessness, unfortunately, has not disap
peared. The Stewart B. McKinney
Homeless Assistance Act, enacted in
July 1987 defines a "homeless" person
as an individual who lacks a fixed,
regular and adequate nighttime resi
dence, or an individual who has a pri
mary nighttime residence that is a
supervised or publicly operated shelter
designed to provide temporary living
accomodations, an institution that pro
vides a temporary residence for individ
uals intended to be institutionalized, or
a public or private place not designed

It seems that the is
sues concerning home
lessness lost in a
popularity contest.

for, or ordinarily used as, a regular
sleeping accomodation for human
beings.
According to recent studies, the num
ber of homeless is between 200,000
(the U.S. Department of Housing and
Urban Development, 1984) and three
million (the National Coalition of the
Homeless). Despite this difference in
numbers, different agencies agree that
the number of liomeless people has
grown tremendously in recent years.
It is also important to recognize that
the homeless population is heterogene
ous. I met Jona one night when I was
working with a homeless health care
outreach van in D.C. For ten years he

has been a faithful fixture at the
McPherson Square Park while the
Veterans' Administration was deciding
whether to help him. Jona has a metal
plate in his head from an injury he
suffered while serving in the Vietnam
War.
Then I met Francis. I met Francis
through a residential program at
Madera last year. After losing his par
ents in his sophomore year at Stanford,
he was left to pull himself up by his
own bootstraps. He was homeless for a
number of years before he started
working at a homeless shelter in San
Francisco. His case was a fortunate
one because he is now a director at
one of the San Francisco shelters.
Like many other Stanford students, I
think I can accomplish anything once I
set my mind to it. Even with my op
timism, however, I know that the
homelessness will continue to be one
spectrum of life in the U.S.
Last year when I was selling tickets
to a benefit concert for the homeless at
White Plaza, a homeless person ap
proached me and questioned how I
could be any help to homeless people

when I was a part of an institution
perpetuating inequalities in our society.
I see the validity in his view, but I
don't have courage even to attempt to
break out of the system.
Also, I still believe that each of us
can try to improve the situation and
that our system is better than any
other system that I know.
On Oct. 7, homeless advocates as
well as other concerned people are
marching in Washington, D.C. to raise
awareness of the problem. The march
is called "Housing NOW!" I am plan
ning on writing to my congressman
and senators to support the cause.
I have come to realize that I am too
selfish to give up the lifestyle as one
of the privileged, but I hope that I can
help to improve the situation in my
own small ways.
Maybe holding on to the idea that 1
can improve the situation while still
enjoying the luxuries as one of the
privileged is my way of justifying my
existence and retaining my sanity.

ous. I met Jona one night when I was
working with a homeless health care
outreach van in D.C. For ten years he

has been a faithful fixture at the
McPherson Square Park while the
Veterans' Administration was deciding
whether to help him. Jona has a metal
plate in his head from an injury he
suffered while serving in the Vietnam
War.
Then I met Francis. I met Francis
through a residential program at
Madera last year. After losing his par
ents in his sophomore year at Stanford,
he was left to pull himself up by his
own bootstraps. He was homeless for a
number of years before he started
working at a homeless shelter in San
Francisco. His case was a fortunate
one because he is now a director at
one of the San Francisco shelters.
Like many other Stanford students, I
think I can accomplish anything once I
set my mind to it. Even with my op
timism, however, I know that the
homelessness will continue to be one
spectrum of life in the U.S.
Last year when I was selling tickets
to a benefit concert for the homeless at
White Plaza, a homeless person ap
proached me and questioned how I
could be any help to homeless people

when I was a part of an institution
perpetuating inequalities in our society.
I see the validity in his view, but I
don't have courage even to attempt to
break out of the system.
Also, I still believe that each of us
can try to improve the situation and
that our system is better than any
other system that I know.
On Oct. 7, homeless advocates as
well as other concerned people are
marching in Washington, D.C. to raise
awareness of the problem. The march
is called "Housing NOW!" I am plan
ning on writing to my congressman
and senators to support the cause.
I have come to realize that I am too
selfish to give up the lifestyle as one
of the privileged, but I hope that I can
help to improve the situation in my
own small ways.
Maybe holding on to the idea that 1
can improve the situation while still
enjoying the luxuries as one of the
privileged is my way of justifying my
existence and retaining my sanity.

"Tell me where a homeless shelter
is," screamed a woman who was
wrapped in layers of torn, lice-infested
winter clothing.
It was sweltering in Washington,
D.C., probably with 90 percent
humidity. As the homeless woman slug
gishly walked along the aisle of the
bus and demanded the driver to take
her to a nearby shelter, I pretended
that she was invisible. The woman's
voice grew louder and louder, but all
of us in the bus continued to ignore
her.
I was in D.C. as a summer intern,
conducting some research on the
health care provision under the
Stewart McKinney Homeless Assistance
Act, but that morning all I could think
about was getting off at the next bus
stop.
Besides feeling physically intimidated,
I wanted to get away from a possibly
complicated situation to enjoy the city
before the hustle and bustle of life
filled the sidewalks.
That morning I did manage to es
cape from the bus, but I could not
escape from the image of the homeless

woman in my mind. I wondered
whether she had a family of her own,
a partner in life or a child she gave
birth to. Countless questions were
asked, but none could be answered.
Articles on homelessness used to
cover the front pages of many msyor
publications two years ago. It seems
that issues concerning homelessness
lost in a popularity contest. The faces
of the homeless are no longer staring
at us from the covers of magazines or
the pages of newspapers.
Even though it is no longer a
"trendy" issue, the problem of home
lessness, unfortunately, has not disap
peared. The Stewart B. McKinney
Homeless Assistance Act, enacted in
July 1987 defines a "homeless" person
as an individual who lacks a fixed,
regular and adequate nighttime resi
dence, or an individual who has a pri
mary nighttime residence that is a
supervised or publicly operated shelter
designed to provide temporary living
accomodations, an institution that pro

According to recent studies, the num
ber of homeless is between 200,000
(the U.S. Department of Housing and
Urban Development, 1984) and three
million (the National Coalition of the
Homeless). Despite this difference in
numbers, different agencies agree that
the number of liomeless people has
grown tremendously in recent years.
