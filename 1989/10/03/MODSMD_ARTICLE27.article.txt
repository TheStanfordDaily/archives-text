## Amazing revelations of frosh roommate assignments Or, how you were blessed to live with that impossible person. . . 
### Amy Rosenfeld Editorial staff 
Is your freshman roommate
your best friend? Can you still
remember her or his name?
Maybe you just wonder how you
two — or three or four — wound
up together in the first place.
Well, you needn't wonder much
longer, for Betsy Wallace and
Steve Lippman have the answer
to all your pressing questions. As
the two student coordinators of
this year's Freshman Information
Project, Wallace and Lippman
spent the entire summer deciding
who should live where and with
whom.
Based in the Housing Center,
the project deals with just about
everything which "happens to
freshmen from the time (Dean of
Undergraduate Admissions) Jean
Fetter admits them until they
show up for Orientation," said
Rodger Whitney, director of the
Housing Center.
But, while the coordinators as
sign Cultures, Ideas and Values
tracks, oversee summer mailings,
place freshmen in dormitories and
produce the froshbook, perhaps
their most famous — and intrigu
ing — job is matching roommates.
After a computer makes initial
CIV and dorm assignments using
the preference forms from Ap
proaching Stanford, the coordina
tors "balance each house to meet
Stanford's ideals of diverse mul
ticultural communities and sup
portive dorm environments," said
Wallace, a senior.
The computer program is very
basic, however, and the balancing
job is not so simple. 1,570 fresh
men were assigned this year, and
Wallace and Lippman changed
1,100 dorm assignments and/or
CIV sections by hand.
The project strives to achieve
balance in each house by roughly
matching house statistics and per
centages to those of the class,
while at the same time keeping
students' preferences in mind.
! "It's like a puzzle," said Lip
pman, a junior. If you move a
student with a certain ethnicity
is an athlete and an engineer
from New England, "you're going
(o impact" all those percentages
in the house, he explained.
• While aiming to create a

microcosm of the class in each
dorm, the coordinators also want
to ensure that no student feels
too isolated. For example, two or
more Native American students
are usually grouped together in a
dorm, although mirroring class
statistics would place only one Na
tive American student in a house.
Wallace stressed that the coor
dinators never honor requests for
specific dorms or roommates.
"Which doesn't mean we don't
get them," Lippman added.
According to Whitney, "some
people . . . have a sense of dorms
already and think they under
stand the character" of a partic
ular house. But, that dorm "will
very likely be something different
this year," he added.
It is only after all this shuffling
is complete and final housing as
signments are mailed out that the
coordinators begin to match up

roommates.
The main criteria considered in
matching roommates are different
intended mayors, different home
regions and different ethnic back
grounds, Wallace said. They also
try not to match two varsity ath
letes or two students from private
schools, but do look for similar
interests and hobbies, she said.
If something prevents two
people who look like they would
be compatible from being room
mates — maybe they're from the
same state or in the same CIV
section — Lippman and Wallace
tried to place them near each
other in the same hallway or wing,
Lippman said.
These decisions can be impor
tant in determining who will meet
whom and who will be friends.
Lippman put it all in perspective,
speculating on the ramifications
of placing two freshmen who are

"really into rock music and want
to be in a rock band" in the same
hall:
"Then it would be cool because
you can tell your kids who are
listening to Stripe Lizard, 'Yeah,
I got them together, " he said.
The coordinators also have to
decide who will live in the few
freshman singles in Branner Hall
and Rinconada House. Some
years, the rooms go to students
with particular disabilities. Other
times, the coordinators look for
"somebody who appears to be very
outgoing" and has held leadership
positions, Wallace said.
Background, interests and
hobbies are all serious topics,
criteria that could make or break
a friendship. But, what about
names? Everyone has heard the
famous tale of four frosh named
Matthew, Mark, Luke and John
who were placed in a Roble quad
one year.
"I've heard that, too," Lippman
said, adding that he also heard
people are matched by rhyming
names or in reverse alphabetical
order. All myths, he insisted.
With all the guidelines the co
ordinators have to follow, "the
only thing we don't have to look
at is the name," explained Lip
pman, whose freshman roommate
was also named Steve.
"Names go through cycles,"
Whitney said. "There will be years
in which you'll find a prepon
derance of certain names like Da
vid, Michael or Jennifer.
"We'll probably go through the
Heathers stage now," he laughed.
According to Housing Center
Assistant Director Bill Georges,
who oversees the project, "our
goal when matching roommates
isn't to match people who will be
best friends. Our goal is to match
people who will be compatible and
learn from each other."
But, Georges added, "if you
happen to luck out and your room
mate's your best friend for four
years of college, that's great."
Whitney said the process has a
very high rate of success. A good
proportion of freshman room
mates stay together, at least as
part of the same draw group, he
said.
Stanford's policy is not to reas
sign roommates during fall quar
ter and after that only in extreme

situations, Whitney said. "The
number of people who complain
at the beginning of the quarter
is very, very small and the num
ber we actually move at the end
of fall quarter is negligible," he
added.
The Freshman Information
Project process actually begins in
the spring when the Housing Cen
ter receives about 70 applications
for one position, Georges said. A
coordinating position requires a
two year commitment and the
team always consists of a senior
who worked on the project the
previous year and a junior who
will continue the following year,
he explained.
The applicants are weeded out
in a two-interview process which
involves representatives from
several areas of the University.
"All the Freshman Information
Project principles and policies are
under purview of the Freshman
Information Flow Group," Whit
ney said. The group is a commit

tee of administrators and faculty
from the Registrar's Office, the
Undergraduate Advising Center,
CIV, Freshman English, Residen
tial Education, the Admissions
Office, Undergraduate Studies,
the Housing Center and other
areas, he explained.
After the final selection, the
two coordinators work with aca
demic officers from the above de
partments and other areas of the
university to plan the Freshman
Mailing Checklist, which helps
frosh keep track of the volumes
of information they will receive
from Stanford.
Everything new students see
before they reach the Farm goes
through the project coordinators,
Wallace said. It's all "official in
formation" and no student organ
ization can contact freshmen
independently.
The coordinators also staff the
project's office all summer,


answering questions through the
mail and the freshman "informa
tion hotline."
"I only had two days of vacation
this summer and I went to visit
my freshman roommate in
Kansas City," Lippman said, il
lustrating both the success of the
project and the intensity of the
coordinators' summer schedule.
Students have been in charge
of the project for over a decade,
Whitney said, adding that Stan

ford's procedure is very different
from other schools where room
mates are assigned via computer
programs or administrators.
"Students are more sensitive to
things than a group of adminis
trators who don't live in dorms,"
he noted.
And despite the hard work and
long hours, "our job is really fun,"
Wallace insisted, adding that they
got all kinds of funny letters and
questions over the summer.
Whitney added that the tone of
the letters varies immensely.
Some students even send ques
tionnaires with boxes for the co

ordinators to check.
Oddly enough, one of the more
common questions was whether
students can buy bikes at Stan
ford, said Lippman.
Another interesting and recur
ring oddity was the response the
office used to receive regarding
its "residence display card," which
asked students to send a photo to
be displayed in their dorm. Before
the name of the form was
changed, some students used to
send pictures of their hou3es,
Whitney said. "We don't know to
this day whether they were
serious."
