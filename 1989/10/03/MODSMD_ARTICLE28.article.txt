# Spirited Stanford mascot wants to leave a personal touch
## 
### Baldwin Lee Editorial staff 
Sophomore Gil Blank is usually 120 pounds
on a 5-foot-6 frame, but when game day comes,
110 pounds of green mattress, foam and felt
transform Blank into Stanford's 9-foot mascot,
the Tree.
Talking while crashed on his bed on a Sun
day night, Blank's spirited personality seems
to be the key to his ability to play Stanford's
larger-than-life mascot. A Stanford football
game normally takes three to five pounds off
of Blank, but he says he is able to stay fueled
due to his composition, "99 percent hormone."
Blank said he became the Tree because it
is a role in which he could carry on a part
of Stanford tradition despite of his lack of
musical abilities.
He was given the mantel of the Tree last
March and has approached his role with a
never-say-die attitude. Because tradition dic
tates that only one person shall be the Tree
in a given year, if Blank misses a game, the
Tree misses a game.
Sitting barefoot in his dorm room, the mark
on his foot where Blank stepped on a nail
two weeks ago is still evident. Although he
was on crutches the day he injured himself,
Blank wanted to perform at a football rally
the same day in spite of the wound. He
couldn't fit the crutches in the Tree top, but
improvised and appeared that day as the Stan
ford Stump.
School loyalty and tradition are two values
that are important to Blank — values respon
sible for his desire to be the Tree since the
second day of his freshman year.
According to Blank, his first impression of
the Tree occurred during the Leland Stanford
Junior University Marching Band's orienta
tion rally, where starry-eyed Blank ran into
"Satan incarnate Drum Major Dylan Thomas
spewing magic from his baton," leading the

band and a cavorting Tree in a band standby
song, "White Punks on Dope."
Blank said he decided that night, "I was
going to be the Tree and it didn't matter
what it took."
He has taken over the role of the Tree from
junior William Thomas, who became a legacy,
according to Blank.
The difference in styles and size between a
belligerent Thomas, who is approximately six
feet tall and weighs 250 pounds, and a much
smaller Blank, has resulted in interesting sit
uations.
"William did a great job of setting me up
to get killed by every mascot," Blank said.
Although he sees himself as the "penul
timate symbol" of Stanford's athletic rivalries,
Blank said he wants to be more friendly toward
other mascots, leaving rivalries on the sym
bolic level. He said he feels all mascots belong
to a common fraternity of sorts, and he asks
other mascots, "Are you as hot as I am?" to
break the ice when he first meets them.
In regard to the fight between Oski, the
UC-Berkeley mascot, and the Tree during last
year's Big Game, Blank said he was "approach
ing Oski with no intention of rolling over the
little shit." However, while Blank wants to
be a more gentle Tree, he is not necessarily
willing to turn the other cheek. "If it should
come to blows, I have two things to tell Oski:
It is at Stanford this year and I have my
boxing gloves," commented Blank, whose Tree
has slimmed down to a leaner fighting weight
this year.
Blank said he feels sorry for Oski because
the rules governing Oski are "fascist": the
identity of the person playing Oski is not
revealed, he is not allowed to speak, and he
never makes eye contact. In a covert mission
to scout out this year's Oski — during which
he posed as a UC-Berkeley freshman — Blank
advised the UC-Berkeley drum major that
Oski should be less uptight.

Blank wants to show the more human side
of the Tree by revealing the individual un
derneath the costume and developing a
rounded personality for the Tree.
As the Tree, Blank said he wants to main
tain a human connection with the crowd. For
example, he said he finds no problem with
flipping off the top of his Tree outfit to confort
a child who may be initially frightened by his
appearance.
Blank also has human fears as the Tree.
He said he attempted to create a costume
that looked more like a tree than Thomas'
"surreal" costume from last year. However,
Blank said some of his intentions may have
been lost in the artistic transformation of two
Sealy Posturepedics, green felt, foam and car
pet into a Tree costume. Blank confided that
his greatest fear is to be mistaken for an
asparagus.
As a tradition-bound New Jerseyite origi
nally not far from the Ivy halls of Princeton
University, Blank hopes to add his own page
to the legacy of the Tree, which has been
around officially for about 15 years, according
to LSJUMB manager John Sherman.
One of Blank's inspirations as Tree is the
creation of a room in the Band Shak called
"The Forest." In Blank has decreed that each
Tree in the following years must steal one
tree-related sign to adorn the walls of the
forest. One example might be Palm Drive,
although he is not officially confirming the
christening sign of the Tree's new room.
Although the tradition of the Tree is char
acterized by change, with a new Tree and a
new Tree costume each year, Blank hopes to
leave his mark and legacy. "You can only be
the Tree one time in your life," he said. "I
hope that I can at least add a little tradition
... so that 20 years from now they will re
member Gil the Tree, who freaked out when
ever the Band played 'White Punks on Dope.'"
