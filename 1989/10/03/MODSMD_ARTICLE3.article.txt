1 In an effort to modernize its
research facilities, the Stanford
University Libraries are currently
undergoing a overhaul of
the card catalog system, as well
as planning renovation of Meyer
Library and introducing a com
puterized circulation system.
Since 1987, the 14 University
libraries have been converting the
card catalog system to a computer
catalog system, Socrates. So far,
66 percent of the conversions have
been completed.
Most of the work has been done
by library staff, but this approach
was recently changed. For the next
four years, an Ohio-based com
pany will make the conversions,
according to David Weber, direc
tor of University Libraries.
But not all conversions will be
handled by the subcontracted
company. The most difficult cir

The conversion has resulted in
an increasing dependency on the
Socrates system for an accurate
listing of all library materials cur
rently available. This is a situation
that both users and non-users of
computers must face, said Eddy
Hogan of the University Libraries
data and information division.
The library system is helping
to ease this transition by offering
three different workshops:
• "Introduction to Socrates" for
new Socrates users,

• "Socrates for Social Scien
tists" for experienced Socrates
users interested in efficient ways
to search for library materials in
the social sciences, and
• "Socrates for Humanists" for
experienced Socrates users
searching for materials in the hu
manities.
The University Libraries also
plan to increase its number of
on-line Socrates terminals. "The
Faculty Senate Committee on Li
braries is committed to adding
more terminals in various library
locations latef this academic year,
possibly by the winter quarter,"
Weber said.
Weber said he did not think
restrictions in this fiscal year's
budget would seriously hamper
the libraries' computerization,
adding that the decrease in fund
ing represents a "moderate net
reduction, but we are optimistic
