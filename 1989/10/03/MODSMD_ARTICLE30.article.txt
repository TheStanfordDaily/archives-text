## Tar Heels outshoot Cardinal 5-0 
### John Louie Staff writer 
If you don't shoot, you can't score.
The theory is simple, but proper ex
ecution is much more complex. And
when you are squaring off against the
no. 2-ranked team in the country, it's
hard to get any breaks.
Crippled by this lack of shots which
has plagued the Stanford women's field
hockey team all year, the Cardinal was
shut out by the Tar Heels of North
Carolina, 5-0 in Berkeley.

"They ran circles around us," soph
omore forward Michelle Beynet said.
."Everyone on the team did the best
they could, but they were more on top
of their game."
I Cardinal spirits fell during the

opening minutes of the game when
North Carolina scored two quick goals.
"Their first two goals really put the
team down," forward Erin Mcßride
said. "We got our spirits back up at
halftime, but we still couldn't get a lot
of shots off."
Stanford did have opportunities in
the game, but breakaways by junior
forward Katherine Pyrde and Beynet
proved fruitless. North Carolina's vic
tory came right on the heels of a 4-0
trouncing of Chico State, who recently
tied Stanford 0-0.
"They weren't as aggressive as some
of the other teams we've played, but
they had a lot of finesse," sophomore
defender Lara Filson said. "The team
really had its skills down well."
Playing the game on the quick artifi
cial turf of California erased any hope
of a "home area" advantage for the Car
dinal, which practices on grass. "One
thing is that we're not as used to turf,"
Mcßride said. "Sometimes, we were just
out of position for some of the passes,

which just rolled too fast."
With the loss, Stanford's record
dropped to 1-4-2 overall. The team is
1-1-2 in the Northern Pacific Confer
ence.
Stanford entered the bout with North
Carolina after battling Cal to a 0-0,
double-overtime tie on Saturday. For
the Cardinal, this standoff was the sec
ond tie game in a row. The team tied
Chico State Sep. 23 by the same score.
"Everyone on the team played well,"
sophomore midfielder Susan Leckrone
said of the game against Cal. "We had
a much cleaner game against Cal. No
one on the team slacked off."
In its first meeting early this Sep
tember, the Cardinal stunned the Bears
at Cal with a 1-0 victory.
Although Stanford dominated the en
tire game last Saturday, goals just
wouldn't come easily, and the Cardinal
failed to notch another Bear kill for the
season.
