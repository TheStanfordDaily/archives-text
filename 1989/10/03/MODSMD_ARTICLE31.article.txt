# AP football pollsters need to awake, smell the Sanka

Who are these guys who vote in the
Associated Press football poll, and
what are they thinking?
Ever since way before you and I were
born, the AP has been conducting a weekly
college football poll. When the end of the
year came, they then would determine who
the national champion was — albeit the
unofficial national champion.
The system has worked reasonably well
through the years, with an expected com
plaint every now and then from a coach
who feels his team was snubbed.
Every once in a while, coaches get to
gether and propose a playoff system to
replace the bowl system, thus determining
a true national champion. The idea has
always been voted down, however, and we
are left with a bunch of writers voting for
who the best team in college football really
is.
I, for one, am a little worried about this.
How do these guys come up with
their picks? Often, the top 20
(whoops, the AP has gone to a top
25 this year, for no apperent reason) is
pretty logical, but weird things happen of
ten enough for me to whine a little.
A fine case of this occured two weeks
ago. Notre Dame was ranked No. 1 in the
nation and Michigan was ranked No. 2.
The teams were scheduled to play that
Saturday and the hype, as one would
suspect, was enormous.
To the typical viewer, looking at the polls,
would lead one to believe that Notre Dame
was the slightly better team and should be
the favorite — by a point or so.
They played the game, and the Fighting
Irish won. Barely. The final was 24-19,
thanks to two kickoff returns that Raghib
Ismail returned for touchdowns.
The Wolverines had a chance to come
back, but they botched an onside kick play
and Notre Dame ran out the clock.
Basically, it seemed like a pretty close
game. That would seem to imply that the
people who felt that Notre Dame was
slightly better than Michigan were right,
and that the teams should retain their
positions in the poll.
Michigan dropped from No. 2 to No.
5, though. Now I have heard two
different theories for how teams
are ranked by voters in these polls. The
first I will call the "results method," and
the second the "best-team" method.
Under the results method, a team is
ranked solely by its performance. Thus,
despite the fact that they lost to the best
team in the country, Michigan still lost

and deserved to fall in the poll.
The problem with this theory is that
Michigan should have fallen further. If the
poll is designed to represent how a team
has fared, then an interesting idea presents
itself.
If Podunk State kicks a last-second field
goal to pull out a 44-43 win over cross-town
rival Podunk Junior College, their record
would be 1-0. Now after Michigan lost to
Notre Dame, the Wolverines fell to 0-1.
Thus, according to this theory, Podunk
State should be ranked higher than Mich
igan because they have a better record.
This sounds pretty ridiculous, but what
other explanation is there?
If we go by the best-team method, Mich
igan shouldn't really fall at all. The poll
sters who watched the game would have
seen two pretty even teams, with Notre
Dame coming out on top. Now if Michigan
played even with the No. 1 team in the
country, why should they fall in the polls?
So which is it? Which method do they
use? My opinion is that they just
make it up as they go along, display
ing no logic. If it's the best team method,
why would Michigan fall? An even better
counter-example occured in soccer a couple
weeks ago.
The Stanford women, ranked seventh at
the time, played at No. 3 Colorado College.
The teams were even through 90 minutes
of regulation, but with under two minutes
remaining in overtime, Colorado College
scored.
In my book, Stanford looked like a pretty
good team by staying even with a team
ranked a lot higher than itself. The Car
dinal fell three spots in the poll the next
week, even though the only other game
the Cardinal played that week was a 5-1
win.
If it's the results method that they're
using, why don't the Podunk States of
college football make it into the top 25
more often, at least early in the season?
