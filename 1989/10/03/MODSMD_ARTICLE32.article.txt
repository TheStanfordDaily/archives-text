# Stanford's Cevaer captures lead with 73 in Butler National
## 
### Brian W. Webber 
Sophomore Christian Cevaer carded a
One-over-par 73 yesterday to take the
lead in the ninth Annual Butler National
Invitational Classic and put the men's
golf team in sixth place in its inaugural
event of the 1989 campaign.
The Cardinal trails first-place Okla
homa State by 14 strokes at the famed
Butler National Golf Club in Oak Brook,
111.
After an outstanding freshman season,
Cevaer is showing no signs of the infa
mous "sophomore slump." His arrival at
Stanford was certainly a catalyst for
Stanford's excellent play last year.
Raised in France, the former Junior
World Champion rose quickly to the chal
lenge presented by the American col
legiate circuit. With Cevaer playing
number one, the Cardinal linksters
reached the NCAA regional qualifying

tournament. Only a frustrating final
round of qualfying prevented Stanford
from reaching the NCAA Championships
for the first time since 1986.
Cevaer earned numerous individual
honors in his first year of collegiate golf,
culminating with the prestigious Pac-10
individual title. Following the season, he
was named as an All Pac-10 First Team
selection.
Cevaer, who was unavailable for com
ment, did not rest on his impressive
laurels over the summer. He returned to
his native Europe and continued to excel,
winning his last two French events.
Because of his strong play over the
summer, team member Steve White proj
ects an equally impressive second season
for Cevaer. "He will dominate this year.
Christian will prove he should be consid
ered among the nation's best," White
said.
Cevear has skillfully navigated the dif

ficult Butler National course thus far,
posting a two day total of par 144. He
leads Bryan Pemberton of USC and
Tulsa's Scott Petersen by one stroke en
tering the final day of play.
Cevaer is joined in Chicago by four
other Stanford golfers. Senior Don Chris
tiansen has provided the team with
steady rounds of 76 and 77. Seniors Mark
Funseth (80- 78) and Brad Benbrook (81-
82) have struggled at Butler, but the two
squad veterans should improve in today's
final round.
Junior transfer Johan Remmelgas fol
lowed his opening 76 with a disappointing
84 yesterday. Hailing from Sweden, Rem
meglas joins Cevaer in providing the Car
dinal with a European accent this season.
Stanford posted rounds of 303 and 310
in the first two days of play. The seven
shot swing can be attributed to blustry
playing conditions that plagued the home
of the Western Open yesterday. Widely

considered one of the toughest stops on
the PGA Tour, Butler becomes even more
difficult when the winds blow.
First day leader Miami of Ohio blew
its lead after the team's score ballooned
by 18 strokes. Oklahoma State took over
first place yesterday with a team score
of 296. Stanford is currently behind OSU,
Tulsa (appropriately nicknamed "The
Golden Hurricanes"), Oklahoma, USC
and Duke.
Beyond Butler, expectations are high
for another successful season. Cevaer
alone makes the Cardinal a legitimate
contender for the Pac-10 title.
Coach Wally Goodwin, as he enters his
third year at the team's helm, finds him
self with the luxury of an extremely large
and experienced roster.
"We're really deep this year," White
said. Stanford returns seven seniors to
this year's talented squad. Goodwin un
doubtedly will look for leadership from

his upperclassmen as the squad strives
to reach the NCAA postseason tourna
ment.
"While Cevaer and Remmeglas are im
portant in bringing new talent to the
team, you cannot underestimate the im
portance of the senior's leadership to this
team's success," said Brad Joondeph, who
is working with the team as a part-time
assistant coach.
This week's Butler Invite starts the
Cardinal on the "Road to Innisbrook,
Florida," site of the 1990 NCAA Division
I Men's Golf Championship. Stanford
needs to be ranked among the top nine
teams in its district to be invited to the
NCAA regional qualifier. At the regional,
the team must secure a top-nine finish
to reach Innisbrook.
The Cardinal returns to Stanford Wed
nesday to prepare to host its Fall Invi
tational Tournament, which will be played
October 12-15.

World Champion rose quickly to the chal
lenge presented by the American col
legiate circuit. With Cevaer playing
number one, the Cardinal linksters
reached the NCAA regional qualifying

tournament. Only a frustrating final
round of qualfying prevented Stanford
from reaching the NCAA Championships
for the first time since 1986.
Cevaer earned numerous individual
honors in his first year of collegiate golf,
culminating with the prestigious Pac-10
individual title. Following the season, he
was named as an All Pac-10 First Team
selection.
Cevaer, who was unavailable for com
ment, did not rest on his impressive
laurels over the summer. He returned to
his native Europe and continued to excel,
winning his last two French events.
Because of his strong play over the
summer, team member Steve White proj
ects an equally impressive second season
for Cevaer. "He will dominate this year.
Christian will prove he should be consid
ered among the nation's best," White
said.
Cevear has skillfully navigated the dif

ficult Butler National course thus far,
posting a two day total of par 144. He
leads Bryan Pemberton of USC and
Tulsa's Scott Petersen by one stroke en
tering the final day of play.
Cevaer is joined in Chicago by four
other Stanford golfers. Senior Don Chris
tiansen has provided the team with
steady rounds of 76 and 77. Seniors Mark
Funseth (80- 78) and Brad Benbrook (81-
82) have struggled at Butler, but the two
squad veterans should improve in today's
final round.
Junior transfer Johan Remmelgas fol
lowed his opening 76 with a disappointing
84 yesterday. Hailing from Sweden, Rem
meglas joins Cevaer in providing the Car
dinal with a European accent this season.
Stanford posted rounds of 303 and 310
in the first two days of play. The seven
shot swing can be attributed to blustry
playing conditions that plagued the home
of the Western Open yesterday. Widely

considered one of the toughest stops on
the PGA Tour, Butler becomes even more
difficult when the winds blow.
First day leader Miami of Ohio blew
its lead after the team's score ballooned
by 18 strokes. Oklahoma State took over
first place yesterday with a team score
of 296. Stanford is currently behind OSU,
Tulsa (appropriately nicknamed "The
Golden Hurricanes"), Oklahoma, USC
and Duke.
Beyond Butler, expectations are high
for another successful season. Cevaer
alone makes the Cardinal a legitimate
contender for the Pac-10 title.
Coach Wally Goodwin, as he enters his
third year at the team's helm, finds him
self with the luxury of an extremely large
and experienced roster.
"We're really deep this year," White
said. Stanford returns seven seniors to
this year's talented squad. Goodwin un
doubtedly will look for leadership from

his upperclassmen as the squad strives
to reach the NCAA postseason tourna
ment.
"While Cevaer and Remmeglas are im
portant in bringing new talent to the
team, you cannot underestimate the im
portance of the senior's leadership to this
team's success," said Brad Joondeph, who
is working with the team as a part-time
assistant coach.
This week's Butler Invite starts the
Cardinal on the "Road to Innisbrook,
Florida," site of the 1990 NCAA Division
I Men's Golf Championship. Stanford
needs to be ranked among the top nine
teams in its district to be invited to the
NCAA regional qualifier. At the regional,
the team must secure a top-nine finish
to reach Innisbrook.
The Cardinal returns to Stanford Wed
nesday to prepare to host its Fall Invi
tational Tournament, which will be played
October 12-15.
