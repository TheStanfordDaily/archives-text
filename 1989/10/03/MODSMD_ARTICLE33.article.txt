# Bears crunch Eagles; Tomczak hurls 3 TDs

CHICAGO (AP) - Mike
Tomczak threw three touchdown
passes and Richard Dent led a de
fense that overcame Randall Cun
ningham's fourth-quarter heroics
as the Chicago Bears remained
unbeaten with a 27-13 victory
over Philadelphia Monday night.
Tomczak had a 14-yard touch
down pass to Dennis McKinnon
and a 1-yarder to Matt Suhey in
the second quarter, then threw a
36-yard scoring pass to James
Thornton with 6:08 left in the
game after the Eagles had come
within a touchdown.
He finished 24-of-38 for 266
yards.
Dent, meanwhile, was credited
with two of Chicago's four sacks.
The Bears, who held the Eagles
to just 73 yards in the first half,
also intercepted four Cunningham
passes.
But the Eagles quarterback,
limited to just 53 passing yards
before halftime, came alive in the
fourth period after the Bears had
taken a 20-3 lead on Neal Ander
son's 2-yard touchdown run with
3:13 left in the third quarter.
First Cunningham threw a 24-
yard touchdown pass to Greg Gar
rity with 2:54 gone in the fourth
quarter. Then he hit Cris Carter
with a 37-yard pass to the 2 after

Wes Hopkins recovered Ander
son's fumble, setting up a 19-yard
field goal by Luis Zendejas with
10:01 left. Cunningham finished
with 32 completions in 62 at
tempts for 401 yards. The 62
passes was a team record.
But Chicago came right back,
going 63 yards in seven plays, with
Tomczak and Thornton hooking
up for the clinching score.
The win ran Chicago's record
to 4-0, gave the Bears a two-game
lead in the NFC Central and left
them as one of the NFL's three
unbeaten teams. They haven't
been out of first place in their
division in 83 games dating back
to the first game of 1984.
It also continued Coach Mike
Ditka's mastery over Buddy Ryan,
his one-time defensive coordinator
and long-time rival. The Bears are
4-0 over the Eagles since Ryan
took over as Philadelphia's head
coach after leaving the Bears after
their Super Bowl victory in 1986.
It was the teams' first meeting
since the fog game last winter,
when the Bears eliminated the
Eagles from the playoffs.
The Bears have never lost to
the Eagles in Chicago in 13 games,
dating back to 1933.
