# Athletes of the Week
## 
### 
Although neither the football nor the
women's volleyball team won Saturday, those
two teams are where one would look to find
The Daily's Athletes of the Week. On the
men's side, Ed McCaffrey was too spectac
ular to ignore. For the women, Kristin Klein
led the sixth-ranked spikers to two victories

in three matches.
Klein, a 6-foot sophomore from Pacific
Palisades, Calif., led the Cardinal to tri
umphs over eighth-ranked California and
Oregon State before Stanford fell to Oregon.
In a match carried live on Pacific Sports
Network from Harmon Gym at Berkeley
Wednesday, Klein had 22 kills in the 15-3,
15-12, 14-16, 15-5 victory. Klein also hit
.439 and added one service ace, 13 digs and
two blocks.
Klein and her teammates then played the
first match in the "new" Old Pavilion Friday.
Stanford faced a spirited Oregon State team
but Klein and teammate Laura Olesen had
13 kills apiece to key the 15-10, 15-7, 15-9
win. Klein added eight digs in the match.
Saturday, the Cardinal suffered a 3-15,
15-9, 9-15, 15-3, 15-8 upset loss at the hands
of the Oregon Ducks. Klein had seven kills
and eight digs.
The Cardinal is 8-3 overall and 4-1 in the
Pacific 10 Conference.

McCaffrey, a 6-6 junior from Allentown,
Penn., was the big-play receiver in a game
full of big plays. The Cardinal eventually
lost 40-33 to San Jose State but McCaffrey
! had 10 receptions for 165 yards.
| After a fine sophomore season in 1987,
McCaffrey was forced to sit out all of 1988
' due to a deep thigh bruise which calcified.
He was off to a good start this year, totalling
10 catches for 175 yards through the first

three games. But Saturday he simply went
wild.
He was the favorite target of quarterback
Steve Smith in a game that featured 384
yards of Cardinal passing. He also caught
two touchdowns, doubling his career total.
