## 
### Sarah Gannett 
Much like classes, Stanford
sailors were off to a fast start last
week, battling California in the
inaugural "Big Sail" at Berkeley
and dominating the Northern
Singlehanded Elimination Series
at Santa Cruz.
While the Golden Bears were
too much for the Cardinal Satur
day, Stanford rebounded to pick
up first, fourth, seventh and
eighth in Sunday's series.
In the first annual "Big Sail"
on Saturday, Cal made the most
of its home-water advantage, win
ning the first two races in a best
of-three series. The host of the
event, the Berkeley Yacht Club,
provided two J-29 sailboats, which
were sailed by eight-member
crews from each school.
Stanford competitors included
skipper Dave Dowd, Robert
Brown, Sue Kown, Scott Dale,
Matt Dunbar, Cathy Petzold,
Peter Somers and Paul Brother
ton.
"We were impressed by Cal's
performance. We were impressed
by the whole regatta," Dowd said.
Stanford controlled most of the
first race in the "Big Sail" but,

after splitting tacks on the final
leg, Cal was able to find a better
breeze on the left side and win
the race by a boat length.
In the second race, Cal had bet
ter boat speed in the increased
winds and led the Cardinal by 18
seconds at the first mark. Stan
ford ended up losing the race by
several boat lengths. "During the
first spinnaker set, we lost the
halyard up the mast, and Cal was
able to gain another minute on
us," Coach Blake Middleton said.
"After that, it was follow-the
leader to the finish line."
Stanford did not let Saturday's
loss to the Bears hinder its per
formance on Sunday. Senior A 1
Sargent grabbed first place over
two Cal boats and a host of teams
from all over Northern Calfornia.
The races were sailed off Santa
Cruz with changing wind condi
tions. Stanford had several other
impressive finishers. Junior Rick
Rosen placed fourth, sophomore
Matt Sanford seventh and fresh
man Haley King eighth. By finish
ing in the top eight, Sargent,
Rosen, Sanford and King qualified
to compete in the next round of
competition, the Pacific Coast
Championships in Los Angeles.
