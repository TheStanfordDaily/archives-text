# Scudamore could propel Cardinal cross country to NCAAs
## 
### Andrew von Nordenflycht Staff writer 
An invitation to the NCAA championships
has long been the goal of the Stanford men's
cross country team.
Last year, the squad finished second in the
Pacific 10 Conference and sixth in the NCAA
District 8 region, one place shy of the national
meet. According to Coach Scott Chisam, this
year's team is more intent than ever on going
to the NCAAs. "If we keep knocking on the
door, we're eventually going to bust through,"
Chisam said.
One of the runners who will be knocking
the loudest is sophomore David Scudamore.
Last season, Scudamore was the top freshman
runner — not only in the Pac-10 — but in
the entire Western region. With a year behind
him, Scudamore looks to join the other two
returning lettermen, seniors Mark and Eric
Mastalir, as legitimate contenders for national
recognition.
"He's not a freshman, mentally, anymore,"
Chisam said. "Without a doubt, he's a top-10
runner in the Pac-10."
Scudamore never really was a freshman, as
far as running is concerned. His consistency
and strength last year surprised his coach and
teammates. "There is a saying that the one
thing you can expect freshman to do is 'crash
and burn,'" Chisam said. "But with Dave,
that was just not the case. Every race was
outstanding."
Mark Mastalir, the leader of the squad,
echoed Chisam's view: "Dave is so consistent.
All year we expected him to bomb sometime,
«but it never happened."
Scudamore agrees that consistency rather
than speed is his forte. But running well all
race long and all season long does not come
without work. Developing and maintaining
physical and mental stamina are essential to
overcoming the fatigue and pain of distance
running.
"I don't have great speed, but I'm a pretty
consistent runner," Scudamore said. "The

year we expected him to

happened.

sport is at least half mental. . . . You have to
practice being tough mentally in workouts and
get used to pain."
Such toughness requires putting the same
intensity into weekday mile-repeats as a Pac-10
meet. Chisam admires Scudamore's ability to
galvanize the rest of the team during work
outs, saying he "forcrs the other guys to raise
their level."
Over the summer, Scudamore built his
strength by logging a huge number of miles.
Because of his stamina,
Scudamore is a constant threat. "[Dave
doesn't have] a lot of speed, but he has lots
of strength," Mastalir explained. "He never
tires and saves his strength for surges. He's
a big threat from a couple miles out."
Scudamore brilliantly displayed this ability
last year in a meet against California in which
he placed fifth. "Cal was where he really stood
out," Chisam said. "At two and a half miles
[of a four mile race], he made a move to the
front and tried to win it. He showed what he
could do."
Scudamore, from Palos Verdes, credits his
successful adjustment to college competition
to the quality of his high school training. "It
was a hard-core program," Scudamore said.
"The tough competition made it easier [at
Stanford]."
Becoming a freshman again was a huge
adjustment. "As a freshman, you must remind
yourself that you won't be winning like you
did as a senior," Scudamore said.
After a successful freshman year,
Scudamore went to the World Junior Cross
Country Championships in Norway last

March. Although an ir\jury (which also kept
him out of the track season) hampered his
performance, he felt he learned quite a bit
competing against runners from 50 other na
tions.
Scudamore dreams of the Olympics and
hopes to make another journey across the
Atlantic to Barcelona in 1992. But his plans
are not completely solidified. "I'll just keep
running and see where I am in three years,"
Scudamore said. "Runners don't really peak
until their late 20s, so I have some time."
What could possibly make people suffer the
tremendous exertion and pain, not to mention
the obscurity, of distance running? After
talking to Scudamore, one realizes it is
precisely the adversity, obscurity, and pain
which keeps him going. Overcoming these ob
stacles makes the triumph most sweet.
"When everything comes together, the
ground seems to fly beneath you," Scudamore
said. "[You feel like] you can conquer anything
... like a god."
The other thing that keeps Scudamore run
ning is the close unity of the team. Cross
country, unlike track, is essentially a team
sport. While only five top finishers count in
a team's score, the placement of all seven
runners can affect the final standings. Strat
egies of pack running are as important as
individual tactics, and a team running in a
well-organized pack can be intimidating.
"The team goal is the NCAAs and that's
most important to me," Scudamore said.
"His attitude really lifts the team since he
always tries to win, not just place," Chisam
said. "He's always looking for an opening. If
he finds one, he'll knock you out. He's got
to be a catalyst."
In the first two meets of the season,
Scudamore placed ninth at Minnesota and
fourth at Ohio State. Despite a slow start,
Scudamore believes he has a "very realistic"
chance at being one of the top 10 in the
region. Top five? "Well, I'd be pretty ecstatic,"
he laughed.

Sophomore superstar Dave Scudamore hopes some of the hard
work he did in practice yesterday will carry the Cardinal to an
NCAA berth.
