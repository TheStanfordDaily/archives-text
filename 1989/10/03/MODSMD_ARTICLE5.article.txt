# Stricter loft policy adopted
## Under the new guidelines, safety comes first 
### Raoul Mowatt Staff writer 
In an effort to make Stanford
housing safer, Housing and
Food Services has adopted stric
ter guidelines which will limit
the size of lofts in dormitory
rooms.
But because of delays in im
plementing the new policy, some
illegal lofts and confused stu
dents have been left hanging in
the balance.
The new policy forbids the
construction of free-standing
elevated platforms which would
present fire hazards. Under the
plan, lofts — including perma
nent ones built by the Univer
sity — cannot prevent fire
sprinklers or smoke detectors
from functioning.
Furthermore, lofts cannot oc
cupy more than one-third of a
room's area, according to speci
fications in the plan.
The plan also stipulates that
any carpeting applied vertically
to a loft must be flame-proofed.
In additon, lofts cannot obstruct
windows or doors that could be
used as a means of escape in
an emergency.

Guard rails and sturdy lad
ders are also required by the
plan to prevent accidents.
The shift to the new policy
began over the summer at the
suggestion of the Environmen
tal Health and Safety depart
ment.
"We at the Health and Safety
office are pessimists," explained
Raymond Gamma, the Univer
sity fire marshal. "We look at a
building and say, 'We have a
problem.' We want safe facilities
for all students at Stanford."
Though "most of the build
ings (at Stanford) are pretty
safe," lofts put their owners at
extra risk, Gamma explained.
Prominent among the additional
dangers caused by lofts is car
bon monoxide, which might rise
to incapacitate a loft inhabitant,
he said.
The new policy represents an
effort "to stay within the
groundwork of good sense and
state regulations," Gamma said.
However, according to Asst.
Director of the Row Jack Chin,
this policy does not mean the
downfall of lofts. "What stu
dents need to know is that they
can still build lofts if they meet

[the proper] criteria," he said.
"If they are planning to build
lofts, they should consult with
their local facilities office."
While many of the permanent
lofts which violated the new
rules were removed from stu
dent rooms over the summer,
others were not. The Housing
Office is still undecided about
what action to take on those
permanent lofts that fail to meet
the new specifications and are
still standing.
"We already had students
move in, and it's not reasonable
to disrupt students' lives to do
something," said Keith Guy, di
rector of Housing and Food
Services.
The University might wait
until the end of the academic
year to remove the remaining
illegal lofts, Guy added.
The Cowell Cluster houses,
which have permanent lofts in
many of their rooms, may be
hurt by the policy. Many stu
dents have been attracted by the
lofts, which they considered per
manent features of the Cowell
Cluster houses.
