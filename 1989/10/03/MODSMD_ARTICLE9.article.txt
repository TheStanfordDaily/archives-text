AASA to vote on committee reps
The Asian American Students Association will
meet Thursday night to select two students who
will serve on the committee to search for a tenure
track professor in Asian-American Studies.
The meeting, open to all students, will be held
at 9 p.m. in the Asian American Activities Center
at the Old Union Clubhouse.
Those present will vote for two students to serve
on the search committee. The two selected must
then be approved by the ASSU Senate, said AASA
issues co-chair Quynh Tran.
Four faculty members have already been named
to the committee. They are: History Prof. Peter
Duus, Assoc. Prof, of History Estelle Freedman,
Economics Prof. Lawrence Lau and Assoc. Prof,
of Anthropology Sylvia Yanagisako.
I Officials hope to have a professor in place by
fall 1990, but the "unknown circumstances of the
search" prevent them from making any promises,
according to Asst. Dean of Academic Affairs
Kathryn Gillam.
History lecturer Gordon Chang, who previously
taught the University's only course in Asian-
American Studies, left Stanford at the end of last
year to assume a tenure-track position at UC-Irvine.
Student organizations had pressured University
officials for such a position to be created at Stan
ford, but officials stalled on the issue, citing finan
cial constraints and the need to address more press
ing priorities.
That changed on May 24, when the administra
tion announced it would initiate an inter
departmental search for a tenure-track professor.
Dean Jean destroys the rumors
In a recent article in The Stanford Magazine,
Dean of Undergraduate Admissions Jean Fetter

dispels some common myths about the Stanford
admissions process and emphasizes the importance
of being yourself on your application.
Among the myths in her article, entitled "Behind
the Dean's Door," Fetter includes:
Myth: Stanford has quotas for specific parts of
the country and specific schools. Denying the ge
ographic distribution myth, Fetter says there are
no quotas of any kind; rather, students are con
sidered as individuals.
Myth: It is a disadvantage to apply to Stanford
from a private high school or (counter-myth) it is
a disadvantage to apply to Stanford from a public
school. Whether an applicant is from a private or
public school is irrelevant, she says. "We do not
distinguish between one type of school and an
other," she writes.
Myth: In the application process, gimmicks make
a difference. Since she became dean of undergrad
uate admissions in 1984, Fetter has received pop
corn, homemade candy, brownies, stuffed animals
and videos, as well as other gimmicks — none of
which has made a difference in the admissions
process.
Myth: Stanford is only for wealthy children. Fet
ter says Stanford is one of the few universities in
the country to maintain a "need-blind admissions
policy" because of donations of alumni and others.
Myth: Students with grade point averages and
test scores below a minimal cut-off need not apply.
While grades and test scores are important, other
qualitative information such as rigor of the aca
demic program and grading scales are taken into
account, writes Fetter. In addition, achievements
outside the classroom are taken into account.
Myth: Stanford turns down better qualified stu
dents to include less qualified minorities. While
Stanford is committed to reaching out to under
represented groups, Fetter repeats that Stanford
has no quotas and no particular statistics in mind
when choosing students.
