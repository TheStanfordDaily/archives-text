# Ohlone bones: Weighing scientific, cultural values
## 
### Jason Bloomstein Senior staff writer 
Some of the Ohlone Indian tribe's
skeletal remains date back more than
5,000 years. But the ancient remains,
now located at the Stanford Museum,
raise brand-new legal and moral issues
for the University, which intends to
return the bones for reburial.
In June, Stanford announced plans
to give an estimated 550 bones of the
Ohione-Costanoan tribe, a tribe in
digenous to the Bay Area, to the few
hundred living tribe members, most of
whom live in California.
But Anthropology Prof. Bert Gerow
is fighting the University's decision. In
a recent interview, Gerow said he refuses
to relinquish any of the artifacts, most

of which he says he discovered over the
past 40 years.
Gerow's resistance unearths the age
old tension between the quest for sci
entific knowledge and a respect for
native cultures and traditions. Gerow
claims scientists deserve much of the
credit for the acquired knowledge the
public — including Native Americans
themselves — know of early Indian life.
"It is for 1 Native Americans'] benefit
not to proceed with the burial," he said.
The local Ohlone Indian tribe has
find authority to decide whether the
transfer of bones should occur.
But Anthropology Department Chair
James Gibbs said the scientific value of
the remains may convince the tribe
members to forego their right to all the

bones.
The tribe, as well as the scientific
world, is now waiting for the results of
a study of the bones by UC-Santa Bar
bara Anthropology Prof. Philip Walker.
A spokesperson for the Ohlone Indi
ans would not comment on the Ohlone's
decision until she receives the report.
Gibbs said his department recognizes
that scientific pursuit and cultural re
spect "are both ethical positions."
By submitting the results of Walker's
report to the tribe and giving them the
final say over the bones, Gibbs said the
Anthropology Department is "trying to
recognize both positions."
The attempt to walk the fine line
between science and culture may become
moot if Gerow's claim to legal ownership

of the bones holds true.
Gerow said he uncovered most of the
bones when he was doing research as a
professor of anthropology and archaeol
ogy here, but the archaeological sites
were not on Stanford property and he
did not receive funding from the Uni
versity.
According to Gerow, he never turned
the deeds to the bones over to Stanford,
and he claims they are legal 'v his.
Assoc. Staff Counsel Tom 1 jnner, the
lawyer representing Stanford, would not
comment on the specific legal issues in
volved.
Others involved in the dispute, how
ever, said the controversy brings up is
sues previously unaddressed.
University Provost James Rosse, who

said he has asked Gerow to relent, said
he has never come across such a complex
issue of ownership while at Stanford.
Rosse said he believes a researcher's
intellectual property such as field notes
belong to the individual professor, but
physical property discovered using Uni
versity resources and personnel belongs
to Stanford.
University Archaeologist Barbara
Bocek said any archaeological discover
ies belong to the owner of the land on
which the artifacts were found. Gerow
said most of the remains he found were
on lands of real estate developers who
hired him to remove archaeological re
mains before the construction of build-
ings and homes.
Although the legal issues
remain nebulous, the University
must try to tackle the issue be
cause it represents one manifesta
tion of a larger movement by
minority groups in asserting their
cultural identity, according to
Gibbs.
He said anthropologists nation
wide are increasingly recognizing
the cultural impacts of their re
search as opposed to the scientific
implications.
Gibbs attributed much of the
rising sensitivity to heritage and
reburial to a "more educated and
articulate" pool of minority or
ganizations that are bringing at
tention to the importance of their
traditional values.
John LaVelle, chair of the
American Indian Lecture Series
at UC-Berkeley, where the issue
is also under discussion, said Na
tive American groups have always
held sacred the concept of bone
ownership, and research institu
tions are becoming more attuned
to their claims.
"Indians have, always been
sensitive to the treatment of their
dead, and they are finding it
easier to educate scientific insti
tutions because they are seeing
more sensitivity," he said.
"The same thing is happening
in the Third World where minor
ity groups are calling for repatria
tion," Gibbs said. "This is a large
movement for Native American
rights and for all human rights."
As the first institution in the
country to decide to return Native
American remains, Stanford has
probably contributed significantly
to a national awareness of the
issue, according to Gibbs.
Gibbs said Stanford's stance di
rectly persuaded the University
of Minnesota, University of South
Dakota and the University of Ne
braska to follow suit.
Furthermore, Stanford's deci

'Stanford has set a
trend. It hopefully will
be picked up by
Berkeley.'

sion had a large impact on the
Smithsonian Institute's decision
to return ancient remains earlier
this year, according to Gibbs.
LaVelle said he believes the
University's decision also
prompted Berkeley to begin
studying the possibility of return
ing some of the 10,000 bones in
its Lowie Museum of Anthropol
ogy.
