## Panamanian coup attempt fails to topple Noriega regime 
### 
PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) —
Troops loyal to Gen. Manuel Antonio Nor
iega put down an attempted coup by rebel
forces yesterday, retaking the headquar
ters of the Panamanian Defense Forces
after a six-hour gun battle.
As the fighting sputtered to an end,
Noriega met with reporters in the De
fense Forces headquarters. He told them,
"This incident corresponds to the perma
nent aggression of U.S. forces against the
tranquillity of our country. The proof is
that U.S. forces closed access routes to
the barracks."
The rebels "surrendered to General
Noriega in person," said Defense Forces
spokesman Edgardo Lopez, who was
with Noriega.
Rebel troops seized the headquarters
during the morning but failed to capture
Noriega. Troops loyal to the general, who
commands the Defense Forces and con
trols the government, launched a coun
terattack and defeated the insurgents.
The United States, which has been
trying to oust Noriega since he was in
dicted nearly two years ago in Florida
on drug charges, denied any involvement
in the coup attempt. The uprising was
launched by junior Defense Forces offi
cers.
U.S. troops assigned to the Panama
Canal Zone took up positions about 600
yards from the headquarters, placed be

tween the fighting at the compound and
U.S. installations at Fort Amador and
Quarry Heights. However, a spokesman
for the U.S. Southern Command said the
American troops took no part in the fight
ing and were dispatched for security
reasons.
Reacting to the news reports from
Panama, Senior Research Fellow William
Ratliff of the Hoover Institution
remarked that he was "not surprised" at
either the coup itself or its outcome.
"Many people want Noriega out of
power — the last election showed it,"
Ratliff said. Noriega's voiding of the elec
tion results only added to people's dis
satisfaction with him, said Ratliff.
However, Ratliff also noted that many
people in Panama also have a significant
stake in Noriega and his government.
Noriega has done many things to improve
Panama, particularly in the area of ed
ucation, and many people are dependent
on his government for their livelihood.
As a result, there is a "strong degree of
loyalty to Noriega and his regime."
According to Ratliff, the middle level
of the military, which apparently staged
the coup, must not have received the
support from the people of Panama that
it had been expecting. "At first, the news
from Panama sounded encouraging."
He believes that at some point in the
fighting, "people's perceptions of the coup

must have shifted," possibly because Nor
iega began to regain control over his
forces. The people "climbed on the win
ning side" and without the support of
the people, the rebels could not succeed.
Ratliff believes that the failure of this
coup will make any future attempts much
more difficult. Based on what happened
after an earlier coup attempt against Nor
iega, "there will be a cleaning-up within
the defense forces." Noriega will try to
consolidate his power and remove anyone
not loyal to him, thereby reducing the
chances for another coup.
Ratliff also questioned President Bush's
claim that there was no U.S. involvement
in this coup attempt. While he does not
think that the United States was directly
involved, he does think that there might
have been indirect involvement, especially
considering that the United States has
been working for the ouster of Noriega
for the past two years.
"At the very least," he said, "the
United States had prior knowledge of the
attempted coup." As evidence, he states
that according to one of his sources, the
U.S. military in the area were armed and
on full alert, indicating that they had
known in advance or had learned very
quickly what was happening.
It was the second time in 18 months
that Nbriega had survived a coup at
tempt.

Rebellious troopsers seized the head
quarters and shooting broke out around
7 a.m. In a radio broadcast, the insurgents
claimed Noriega had been ousted, but
loyal forces soon took control of the broad
cast networks.
"We want to underline that the situa
tion in the country has been duly con
trolled to guarantee the peace and tran
quillity that the state should assure for
its citizens," said a statement released by
Justice and Interior Minister Olmedo
Miranda.
It declared an 8 p.m.-to-5 a.m. curfew
and said the news media could report
only official statements on the revolt.
Panama's provisional president, Fran
cisco Rodriguez, speaking to the U.N.
General Assembly in New York, said an
attempted coup against his government
had been crushed.
Rodriguez, in his midafternoon ad
dress, did not accuse the United States
of complicity in the revolt but said Wash
ington had undermined his nation with
"financial terrorism, economic blackmail
and political interference." The rebels'
claimed in a broadcast around noon that
they had overthrown Noriega and retired
top officers, but that communique was
not repeated.
An officer loyal to Noriega later said
the general was at an undisclosed location

controlling the operations against the in
surgents.
White House spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater said Tuesday afternoon in
Washington that officials had heard early
"rumblings" of the uprising. He said later
it appeared that Noriega's forces "are
back in control."
A communique by loyalists, read over
Channel 2 television, said, "The
nationalist officers of all ranks and in
all the barracks countrywide have con
firmed their loyalty to the fatherland . . .
and to our Commander-in-Chief Gen.
Manuel Antonio Noriega." Troops of the
Southern Command were put on Delta
Alert, the highest level of readiness.
About 12,000 U.S. soldiers are sta
tioned in Panama, many within five miles
of Panama City. All U.S. civilian depen
dents were moved onto U.S. military in
stallations July 1 because of violence that
followed Panamanian elections held May
7. Noriega nullified the results of the
vote, which showed the opposition win
ning.

iega put down an attempted coup by rebel
forces yesterday, retaking the headquar
ters of the Panamanian Defense Forces
after a six-hour gun battle.
As the fighting sputtered to an end,
Noriega met with reporters in the De
fense Forces headquarters. He told them,
"This incident corresponds to the perma
nent aggression of U.S. forces against the
tranquillity of our country. The proof is
that U.S. forces closed access routes to
the barracks."
The rebels "surrendered to General
Noriega in person," said Defense Forces
spokesman Edgardo Lopez, who was
with Noriega.
Rebel troops seized the headquarters
during the morning but failed to capture
Noriega. Troops loyal to the general, who
commands the Defense Forces and con
trols the government, launched a coun
terattack and defeated the insurgents.
The United States, which has been
trying to oust Noriega since he was in
dicted nearly two years ago in Florida
on drug charges, denied any involvement
in the coup attempt. The uprising was
launched by junior Defense Forces offi
cers.
U.S. troops assigned to the Panama
Canal Zone took up positions about 600
yards from the headquarters, placed be

tween the fighting at the compound and
U.S. installations at Fort Amador and
Quarry Heights. However, a spokesman
for the U.S. Southern Command said the
American troops took no part in the fight
ing and were dispatched for security
reasons.
Reacting to the news reports from
Panama, Senior Research Fellow William
Ratliff of the Hoover Institution
remarked that he was "not surprised" at
either the coup itself or its outcome.
"Many people want Noriega out of
power — the last election showed it,"
Ratliff said. Noriega's voiding of the elec
tion results only added to people's dis
satisfaction with him, said Ratliff.
However, Ratliff also noted that many
people in Panama also have a significant
stake in Noriega and his government.
Noriega has done many things to improve
Panama, particularly in the area of ed
ucation, and many people are dependent
on his government for their livelihood.
As a result, there is a "strong degree of
loyalty to Noriega and his regime."
According to Ratliff, the middle level
of the military, which apparently staged
the coup, must not have received the
support from the people of Panama that
it had been expecting. "At first, the news
from Panama sounded encouraging."
He believes that at some point in the
fighting, "people's perceptions of the coup

must have shifted," possibly because Nor
iega began to regain control over his
forces. The people "climbed on the win
ning side" and without the support of
the people, the rebels could not succeed.
Ratliff believes that the failure of this
coup will make any future attempts much
more difficult. Based on what happened
after an earlier coup attempt against Nor
iega, "there will be a cleaning-up within
the defense forces." Noriega will try to
consolidate his power and remove anyone
not loyal to him, thereby reducing the
chances for another coup.
Ratliff also questioned President Bush's
claim that there was no U.S. involvement
in this coup attempt. While he does not
think that the United States was directly
involved, he does think that there might
have been indirect involvement, especially
considering that the United States has
been working for the ouster of Noriega
for the past two years.
"At the very least," he said, "the
United States had prior knowledge of the
attempted coup." As evidence, he states
that according to one of his sources, the
U.S. military in the area were armed and
on full alert, indicating that they had
known in advance or had learned very
quickly what was happening.
It was the second time in 18 months
that Nbriega had survived a coup at
tempt.

Rebellious troopsers seized the head
quarters and shooting broke out around
7 a.m. In a radio broadcast, the insurgents
claimed Noriega had been ousted, but
loyal forces soon took control of the broad
cast networks.
"We want to underline that the situa
tion in the country has been duly con
trolled to guarantee the peace and tran
quillity that the state should assure for
its citizens," said a statement released by
Justice and Interior Minister Olmedo
Miranda.
It declared an 8 p.m.-to-5 a.m. curfew
and said the news media could report
only official statements on the revolt.
Panama's provisional president, Fran
cisco Rodriguez, speaking to the U.N.
General Assembly in New York, said an
attempted coup against his government
had been crushed.
Rodriguez, in his midafternoon ad
dress, did not accuse the United States
of complicity in the revolt but said Wash
ington had undermined his nation with
"financial terrorism, economic blackmail
and political interference." The rebels'
claimed in a broadcast around noon that
they had overthrown Noriega and retired
top officers, but that communique was
not repeated.
An officer loyal to Noriega later said
the general was at an undisclosed location

controlling the operations against the in
surgents.
White House spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater said Tuesday afternoon in
Washington that officials had heard early
"rumblings" of the uprising. He said later
it appeared that Noriega's forces "are
back in control."
A communique by loyalists, read over
Channel 2 television, said, "The
nationalist officers of all ranks and in
all the barracks countrywide have con
firmed their loyalty to the fatherland . . .
and to our Commander-in-Chief Gen.
Manuel Antonio Noriega." Troops of the
Southern Command were put on Delta
Alert, the highest level of readiness.
About 12,000 U.S. soldiers are sta
tioned in Panama, many within five miles
of Panama City. All U.S. civilian depen
dents were moved onto U.S. military in
stallations July 1 because of violence that
followed Panamanian elections held May
7. Noriega nullified the results of the
vote, which showed the opposition win
ning.
President Bush told reporters in Wash
ington: "There were rumors around that
this was some American operation, and
I can tell you that is not true. Nobody's
sure what's happening there."
