# Lebanese consider new constitution
## 
### 
TAIF, Saudi Arabia (AP) — Lebanese
legislators considered a proposal yester
day to expand the 99-seat Parliament,
giving Moslems more representation un
der a new constitution aimed at ending
the long sectarian civil war.
They also examined ways of increas
ing the powers of the prime minister,
traditionally a Sunni Moslem, Lebanese
sources said on condition of anonymity.
Sixty-three of Parliament's 73 surviv
ing deputies have been meeting in Taif
since Saturday in a session removed
from Lebanon because of a battle that
began in March between Christians and
a Moslem alliance led by Syrian troops.
At the United Nations in New York,
Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk al
. -Shara said his country would not with
* draw its 40,000 soldiers and claimed
the military presence guarantees some
stability in Lebanon.
• In the General Assembly, he said
V Syria would help a Lebanese govern
*ment of "national reconciliation to ex
»tend its authority all over the Lebanese
I! territory, motivated by the special
' Syrian-Lebanese relationship."
» In Tehran, Iran, leaders of the two

main Moslem militia factions in
Lebanon, Druse chieftain Walid
Jumblatt and Nabih Berri, head of the
Shiite militia Amal, conferred with
Iran's spiritual leader, Ayatollah Ali
Khamenei.
Tehran radio, monitored in Cyprus,
said Khamenei told them: "Lebanon is
an Islamic country, and control must
be wrenched out of Maronite (Christian)
hands."
The trip to Tehran by Jumblatt and
Berri prompted fears among some leg
islators that Iran would try to under
mine their peace efforts.
A new charter they are considering
would give the Cabinet the power to
veto presidential decisions. The author
ity of the president himself, a Christian
under Lebanon's 46-year-old unwritten
national covenant, would otherwise
remain untouched.
Christians have dominated the gov
ernment, army and judiciary since
Lebanon gained independence from
Pran6e in 1943. They were considered
to be the majority in 1943, but Moslems
now are estimated to account for 55
percent of the 4 million people.

Conference sources said the legisla
tors were moving toward "balancing and
overlapping powers" of the president,
prime minister and the Parliament
speaker, who traditionally is a Shiite
Moslem.
The draft charter was put forth by
an Arab League committee of Saudi
Arabia, Algeria and Morocco, which has
a mandate to settle the 14-year-old civil
war by the end of November.
Sources said the draft would increase
the number of deputies in the uni
cameral Parliament to from 99 to 128,
but many legislators appeared to favor
adding only nine seats, all for Moslems.
Ten days ago, the Arab committee
succeeded in halting six months of
bloody duels between Christian army
units under Gen. Michel Aoun and
Syrian troops.
Syria sent troops into Lebanon under
a 1976 peacekeeping mandate from the
Arab League.
Christiana want Ibe Syrian soldier*
removed, describing them as an occu
pation force rather than peacekeepers.
The legislators are expected to form
ulate the charter while in Taif.
