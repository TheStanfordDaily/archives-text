Obscene art compromise
WASHINGTON (AP) - The House
approved restrictions on federal aid
for "obscene" art on yesterday, a com
promise that eased away from even
stricter limitations pushed by Sen.
Jesse Helms and other conservatives.
The 381-41 vote sent a spending bill
containing the provision to the Senate,
where final congressional approval
was expected this week. The arts lan
guage was adopted on a voice vote.
The rules, governing monies dis
pensed by the National Endowment
for the Arts and the National Endow
ment for the Humanities, would ap
parently be the first time the govern
ment has limited aid to art based on
a work's content, according to Barry
Lynn of the American Civil Liberties
Union and First Amendment lawyer
Floyd Abrams.
"But it's a compromise, and it's a
vast improvement over the initial lan
guage," Lynn said.
The legislation bars endowment of
ficials from issuing grants for exhibi
tions that they consider "obscene,"
including works depicting sadomasoc
hism, homoeroticism, sexual exploita
tion of children or individuals engaged
in sex acts. In addition, the officials
must find that the work lacks "serious
literary, artistic, political or scientific
value."

Helms, R-N.C., had sought to
prohibit federal aid for obscene or in
decent art, and for works offensive to
a religion, ethnic group, race, age
group, or the disabled. The original
House version of the bill contained
no such language.
House-Senate negotiators chiseled
the compromise last week after the
Senate, which had approved Helms'
amendment on a voice vote in July,
reversed itself and instead voted sup
port for milder restrictions.
Homeless march planned
WASHINGTON (AP) - Tens of
thousands of people have begun ar
riving in the capital to petition Con
gress and the Bush administration to
lift the homeless from the streets and
make housing more affordable for all
Americans.
Organizers remained coy yesterday
as they have for months, about the
turnout they expect for three days of
activities culminating in a "Housing
Now!" march Saturday on the na
tional Mall.
But the breadth of their sponsor
ship, coupled with a massive planning
effort dating to early in the year, could
produce one of the largest demonstra
tions Washington has seen in years.
"We're saying enough is enough,"
said Washington homeless activist

Mitch Snyder. "Today the streets in
Boston, New York and Washington
look like those in Calcutta. This dem
onstration is to provide some will and
some backbone to the administration
and Congress."
The march and related events, in
cluding a lobbying siege of individual
members of Congress by an estimated
4,000 people on Thursday and Eriday,
is backed by more than 200 organi
zations, including the AEL-CIO, the
U.S. Conference of Mayors, the
YMCA, the YWCA, the National Ur
ban League, Catholic Charities USA,
the Southern Christian Leadership
Conference and the National Organi
zation for Women.
More than 200 show business per
sonalities and dozens of state and local
officials, including Gov. Richard
Celeste of Ohio and Mayor Raymond
L. Elynn of Boston, also have lent
their support. The Hollywood contin
gent is led by actress Valerie Harper
and actor Jon Voight.
Snyder, head of the Community for
Creative Non-Violence, and Barry
Zigas, president of the National Low-
Income Housing Coalition, are among
the principal organizers of the march.
At a news conference Tuesday, Zigas
repeatedly declined to predict a turn
out, other than to say "It's going to
be a mt\jor, event." He said
more than half the participants would
actually be homeless people.
