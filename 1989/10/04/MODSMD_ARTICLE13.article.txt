# East Germany bans travel
## 
### 
PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) — East
Germany issued an order yesterday ban
ning free travel to Czechoslovakia but
agreed that at least 10,000 of its citizens
already in Prague could emigrate to the
West.
East German leader Erich Honecker ac
cused West Germany of "insolently break
ing promises" by letting the East Germans
into its embassies in Prague and Warsaw.
"They believe in West Germany that they
can destabilize East Germany with a broad
based attack, but it will not work," he said
in his first major speech since returning
to work after a long convalescence from
gallbladder surgery. ADN, the official East
German news agency, carried his remarks.
The crackdown on travel came after hun
dreds of East Germans stormed through
police lines to get inside the embassy in
Prague.
They climbed facades, rooftops and a
fence to reach the crowded compound.
Many were left blood-spattered by police
and some fell unconscious inside the
grounds.
Rudolf Seiters, Chancellor Helmut Kohl's
chief of staff, initially said East German
refugees would begin leaving Prague for
West Germany by train last night, but their
departure was delayed for hours.
Police were withdrawn from the railroad
station at 10 p.m., and an hour later the
refugees were still in and around the em
bassy, waiting in freezing weather.
Seiters said an estimated 4,700 refugees

in the the embassy and about 6,000 milling
outside would be traveling west.
He said Kohl was informed of the East
German decision by Premier Ladislav
Adamec of Czechoslovakia.
East Germany's decision appeared to be
part of an effort to avoid possible embar
rassing disturbances during celebrations of
the communist state's 40th anniversary
Saturday. Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gobachev is scheduled to attend.
Thousands of East Germans have
streamed across the border into neighbor
ing Czechoslovakia and to other Soviet bloc
countries in the last few weeks in an at
tempt to reach West Gemany.
ADN said the travel ban stemmed from
reports "that certain circles in West Ger
many are preparing provocations" in con
junction with the celebrations.
Last weekend, East Germany agreed to
the departure of about 7,000 refugees from
the West German embassies in Prague and
in Warsaw, Poland, but said it was a one
time arrangement.
Previously, East Germans did not need
a visa or passport to reach Czechoslovakia,
but ADN said such documents would be
required from now on. That effectively bans
all ordinary East Germans from traveling
to Czechoslovakia.
It also will make it much more difficult
for East Germans to reach Hungary, where
the liberal leadership opened its western
border Sept. 11, since the usual route to
Hungary is through Czechoslovakia.
