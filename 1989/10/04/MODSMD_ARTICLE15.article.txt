Jewish students must
be excused from class
on day of Yom Kippur

This Sunday evening
begins the holiest day of the
Jewish year. Yom Kippur,
the Day of Atonement, is the cul
mination of ten days of repentance
which begin with Rosh Hashanah,
the Jewish New Year.
Jews spend the Yom Kippur fas
ting and praying to atone for their
sins and seek forgiveness for those
who have wronged them. The
holiday offers people a chance to
reflect on the year's events and
begin the new year with a clean
slate.
Yom Kippur begins on Sunday
and continues until sundown Mon
day night. While ASSU Sunday
Flicks has moved this week's film
to Saturday night to accomodate
religious services in Memorial Au
ditorium Sunday, classes will still

be held Monday.
Faculty members should be
aware that a number of their stu
dents will be unable to attend class
Monday because they are observ
ing Yom Kippur. Professors should
let students know that they are
excused from class.
All faculty members receive an
annual letter from the Registrar's
office alerting them to the dates
of holidays for all religions that
they should consider when plan
ning class schedules.
Hillel will also be mailing a letter
this week to Jewish faculty saying
that if they wish to cancel classes
Monday they will be setting a fine
example for Jewish students.
The letter goes on to state that
some Jewish students have felt in
timidation or disapproval when
missing class for Jewish holidays
in the past.
Religious diversity is part of the
multiculturalism for which Stan
ford is striving, and accommodat
ing students when religion conflicts
with academics is an important
step toward this goal.
