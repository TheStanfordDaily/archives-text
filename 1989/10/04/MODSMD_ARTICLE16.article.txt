## Get a salary refund 
### 
The University could learn a lot
from the ASSU, especially from
the student government's election
process.
Every spring, student groups
making fee requests are placed on
the ASSU general election ballot
for all students to decide whether
the group deserves its money. If
the group earns approval by 50
percent of the student body, it wins
its fee assessment and gets its
money.
The catch comes the following
fall, when students who do not be
lieve the student group worthy of
their money can get a fee refund

— to be taken away from that
group's allotment.
In the spirit of making Stanford
more accountable to student needs,
maybe administrators' salaries
could be worked in much the same
way. It would be preposterous to
propose that students vote to de
termine the actual salaries, but
salary refunds may work.
The system may even work to
the University's advantage. If stu
dents are truly upset that Univer
sity President Donald Kennedy will
not meet with them, they would
not have to take over his office.
They could just yank away their
$15 contribution to his salary.
