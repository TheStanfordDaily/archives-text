Kennedy's message to frosh is finally realistic

A CONSERVATIVE has been
defined as a liberal that's been
mugged by reality.
While such a definition might in
some ways border on the trivial, it
nevertheless neatly reflects a deeply
fundamental principle of conservative
thought. Namely, creatively searching
for tomorrow's solution based upon the
learned experience brought on by
historical developments within the
context of human reality.
Quite simply, conservatism recognizes
that naive or misfounded notions,
regardless of how "brilliant" their
intentious, will not bring about positive

results.
It seems our President, Don Ken
nedy, has finally learned the lesson. In
his address to freshman, he urged
Stanford's newest students to place
some value in their already formed
fundamental views and to "harbor a
healthy mistrust of conventional wis
dom, and of what is passed off as
'correct polities', because the work you
have already done for yourself may
well be better."
This sounds an awful lot like what
moderate groups on campus have been
advocating all along. Even true conser
vatives have no problem with Jesse

Jackson speaking on campus repeat
edly, David Brown and the People's
Platform ranting and raving until their
Third World hearts are content, nor
with Rebholz and Manley spending all
of their time writing letters to The
Daily vilifying Hoover instead of any
thing remotely scholastic.
Unfortunately, what we have seen
over the past few years is the growth
of a pervasive attitude on campus,
propagated noticeably by those in
Residential Education, in certain publi
cations and in various academic circles,
that any challenge to Leftist assump
tions is unacceptable and must not be

tolerated.
Don Kennedy, a President who has
been noteworthy in his capitulation to
the often outrageous demands of radi
cal groups, has been truly impressive
with his newfound openmindness. His
advice, "In response for all those who
will invite you to accept their agenda
and their values, you should ask hard
questions, make them prove everything
twice, and then decide," can hardly be
improved upon. Hopefully, in the fu
ture no more mugging will be re
quired.
