# USW will receive arbitration meeting without delay
## 
### 
This letter responds briefly to your
editorial of Oct. 2, concerning the
pending life science technician arbitra
tion.
First, Daily readers should be aware
that it is not unusual for arbitrations
to be postponed when there are calen
dar conflicts or witnesses are unavail
able.
The United Stanford Workers them
selves twice removed this arbitration
from the calendar on short notice last
Feb. 22 and 23 — on one day because
the Union attorney himself had a pro
fessional conflict, and on the next be
cause the person the Union said was
their only remaining witness was ill.
Second, in this case, to minimize the
effects of postponement the University
has proposed using an October 1989
date before the same arbitrator. While
the Union has not yet responded to
this proposed date, if accepted the ac-

The United Stanford
Workers themselves twice

tual delay will be less than a month
(as compared with the seven month
delay which resulted from the Union
taking the case off the calendar last
February).
Finally, while it is generally the Uni
versity's policy not to comment in
detail on the merits of a matter that is
still in litigation, a few important facts
should be known by the interested
reader.
Wages of the life science technicians
as well as the science and engineering
technicians are the result of agree
ments by USW and Stanford in collec
tive bargaining negotiations.
In the past several contracts the
Union has agreed to these wage ranges
of the life science technicians and of
the science and engineering technicians.

Indeed, just last Oct. 31, 1988, the
Union reportedly "enthusiastically"
recommended the new three-year con
tract for ratification by its members.
That contract was reached without any
dispute over the wage ranges for life
science technicians or science and engi
neering technicians.
