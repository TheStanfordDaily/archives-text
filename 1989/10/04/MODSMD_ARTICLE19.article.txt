# Singling out of Jackson is definite case of racism
## 
### 
I am writing to express my dismay
and outrage over what is happening to
Louis Jackson. The police charges con
fronting him stem from a clearly racist
attitude. Jackson was singled out for
prosecution because he is an effective
black leader and he represents a threat
to the status quo.
I don't understand why President
Kennedy won't acknowledge that this
case requires special treatment. I don't

care what university policy has been in
the past: now is a time for action.
By remaining mute, Kennedy is per
petuating the racist forces which are
working against Jackson. I hope he has
enough vision to see beyond this policy
he clings to, and that he will join
Jackson in standing up for what is
right.
