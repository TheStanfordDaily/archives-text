# University struggling for hashers
## 
### Brent Bigler Staff writer 
Hashers have it made these days. Usually
found quietly doling out dollops of some
times questionable concoctions, they are
now the most wanted commodity on
Campus.
Well, maybe not quite.
But it is true that University Food Serv
ice is finding itself faced with a hasher
shortage to the tune of 50 or 60 people,
according to Karolyn Gaskin, administra
tive assistant of Housing and Food Services.
Facing the worst hasher shortage in four
years, Food Service is "not able to provide
the service we're expected to provide," said
James Keeton, manager of University Food
Service.
The reason? Gaskin said it's modern
times. "In the good old days, [hashing] was
really social. Times have changed. Attitudes
have changed," she said.
Nowadays, Gaskin added, "Nobody ever
knows what a hasher is when you put it
on your resume."
Hashing does not offer some of the ad
vantages that working in places such as a
library does, said Tina Parks, assistant
Food Service manager in Wilbur Hall. In
the food service line, she notes, it is im
possible do homework and dish out victuals
at the same time.
But Food Service has an incentive plan
that is sure to have prospective hashers
licking their chops. "[There is] something
new that we've started this year," Parks
said. "Each shift [hashers] work, they get
to eat for free."
In addition, added Keeton, some hashers
will have the opportunity to save money
on their meal plan.
"For students who work 12 hours a week
or more, we'll give them an option to
change down to the 10-meal plan," Keeton
said. Currently, students purchase one of
three weekly meal plans: 19
meals, 14 meals or 10 meals.
Keeton also said Food Service
is ending the two-tiered schedule
of paying hashers. High school
students who worked for Food
Service were traditionally paid a
wage of about $1 less per hour.
Now they earn the same salary
as Stanford students, according to

Keeton.
Parks said most of the scarcity
stems from fewer freshmen who
want to be hashers. "We depend
on the freshmen coming in. We
have a lot less freshmen apply
ing," she said.
Parks said that only about half
of those freshmen who indicated
an interest in hashing for Wilbur
actually started working. "They
signed up to work, but when they
got here, they changed their
minds," she said.
