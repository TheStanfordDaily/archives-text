## Vasquez story is unique 
### 
IT'S HARD NOT TO be jealous of
some of the people you meet or hear
about at Stanford. There are students
who have published novels, won gold
medals, patented inventions, received
prestigous awards and, after a while,
being vice-president of the synchronized
swimming club in high school doesn't
seem like such a big deal anymore.
There's no question that for mere mor
tals Stanford can be a humbling experi
ence, what with being surrounded by ac
ademic standouts who are also well
known for their other achievements.
Now there is another frosh to add to
the list of famous undergraduates. Lupe
Vasquez, who was homeless before enter
ing Stanford, has received national at
tention for her inspiring success story.
Vasquez was able to enroll in a mtyor
university despite her background of
poverty and homelessness.
Some people will see Vasquez's story
as a shining example of the American
Dream. She worked hard and was
rewarded for her dedication and devotion.
The system works, they'll say. But the
fact that her entrance into college has
turned into such a media event shows
that the system doesn't work often
enough.
Can you imagine Joe Rothchild 111,
who attended an eastern prep school being
mobbed by the press for enrolling at Stan
ford? Of course not. It seems ridiculous.
It isn't a major event for Joe Rothchild
111 to get into a school like Stanford; in
fact, it's almost expected. Just as it's al
most expected that someone with a back
ground like Vasquez's will never enter

college.
Unfortunately for the poor and minor
ities, Vasquez is merely an exception to
the rule. While some people with back
grounds similar to hers do make it into
college, many others do not finish high
school.
While racism or classism may not be
as overt as in the past, some school of
ficials still harbor misguided attitudes
about the intelligence and abilities of dif
ferent races and classes. Children who
come from poor or minority families may
be steered toward vocational classes
rather than college preparatory courses.
They may receive blatant or subtle signals
that they are not expected to go to college
or that they do not have the ability to
succeed in higher education. These signs
can be reinforced with scores on IQ tests
or the SAT which often are culturally
biased toward middle class whites.
Thus when someone with a disadvan
taged background does succeed, it is quite
an achievement, considering the societal
obstacles built into the system. Unfortu
nately, however, these success stories are
still relatively infrequent, and hence the
hoopla over Vasquez's entrance.
Spike Lee made a similar observation
about his own experience on a television
special about racism entitled "R.A.C.E."
One panelist on the show chided Lee for
his cynicism about the lack of opportu
nities for blacks in the United States.
He pointed out that Lee had achieved
phenomenal success and therefore blacks
could prosper. Lee said that was the point.
While he and some other African Amer
icans are singled out as successful black

The fact that Vasquez's
entrance into college has
turned into such a media
event shows that the sys
tem doesn't work often
enough.

men, garnering a lot of publicity, most
blacks still must struggle against insti
tutionalized racism and public attitudes
to achieve even the smallest measure of
success.
Vasquez certainly deserves the recogni
tion she's receiving for succeding in a
society that does not make it easy for
her. Hopefully her example will inspire
other disadvantaged children to develop
their abilities to the fullest.
It feels great to go to a school with
talented people like Vasquez. But it will
feel even better if someday another
Vasquez will be able to enter Stanford,
throw paper at Flicks, eat fro yo at Tres
idder, read Plato's "Republic" and cheer
at Big Game without having to hold a
press conference to answer questions
about it.
