## Stanford team hopes to have results in coming weeks Cold fusion research rising from its obscure grave 
### Jock Friedly Editorial staff 
Materials Sciences Prof. Robert
Huggins hasn't held a press con
ference recently announcing a cold
fusion discovery. But as more data
on cold fusion experiments
steadily streams in from around
the world, skeptics are keeping
ominously quiet.
Huggins held a press conference
last year to announce the stun
ning results of an important con
trol experiment that showed that
the cold fusion craze was "not
just weird chemistry," as some
critics had proclaimed.

The general situa
tion is that you've got
to believe that some
thing is happening.
You've got to assume
that part of what is
happening is a nu
clear process.'
— Robert Huggins

Scientists and the general public
followed the quick-paced cold fu
sion announcements, and many
had high hopes that fusion —
never thought possible at temper
atures found on earth — would
be a limitless, pollution-free
source of energy. Those high hopes
were tossed when skeptics —
mostly physicists — pronounced
the subject dead.
Cold fusion is not yet dead,
Huggins says, and the idea has
never been closer to being dubbed
real, rather than crackpot, sci
ence.
For whatever reason, physicists
are no longer quoted in newspa
pers blasting cold fusion. Perhaps
the silence is a result of the
media's loss of interest in the sub
ject; but others are beginning to
speculate that skeptics cannot
cdunter the positive results that
have been reported in recent
weeks suggesting that cold fusion
is real.
By Huggins' count, 19 labs have

reported finding excess heat when
they pass a current through a pal
ladium electrode soaked in heavy
water, a form of water composed
of deuterium, or heavy hydrogen,
rather than ordinary hydrogen.
Critics have argued that the heat
might be a matter of unaccounted
chemical reactions or sloppy sci
ence rather than cold fusion.
Much more importantly,
though, scientists have recently
found tritium, a triply heavy form
of hydrogen, that can be positive
proof that some nuclear process,
such as fusion, occurred. At least
13 labs, again by Huggins' count,
have reported finding tritium in
their experiments. So much
tritium has been found in some
labs that some people say it can
only be explained by fusion.
According to scientists, tritium
measurements are relatively easy,
child's play by comparison to
many other measurements that
cold fusion researchers have
made. Measurements of tritium
by several labs can hardly be
refuted, he adds, unless contam
ination is occuring somehow.
But as one cold fusion expert
says, tritium has been known to
accumulate in some of the
strangest ways. David Worledge,
a physicist at Palo Alto's Electric
Power Research Institute that
oversees much of the cold fusion
research in the country, said
tritium contamination is thought
to be one of the most troublesome
matters yet to be resolved.
Worledge points out, however,
that the confirmation by several
labs indicates that the tritium
contamination is highly unlikely.
"The general situation is that
you've got to believe that some
thing is happening," Huggins
says. "There's lots of verifica
tion."
Huggins has always chosen his
words carefully around reporters.
Even at the height of excitement
last April, Huggins never used the
words cold fusion to describe what
he was seeing in his red Rubber
maid picnic cooler experiment.
Rather, the electrochemist
would say that the phenomenon
was unexplicable using current
theory. Months later, Huggins
now says, "You've got to assume
that part of what is happening is

a nuclear process." In other
words, fusion.
Many critics have yet to be ex
posed to much of the information
available to the cold fusion re
searchers. Physics Prof. Walter
Meyerhof, an adamant critic of
cold fusion researchers and par
ticularly Huggins, is now defer
ring all questions, saying he has
not been keeping in touch with
the field.
Like other top nuclear physi
cists, Meyerhof is not willing to
abandon years, even decades, of
research that seem to indicate
that fusion is not naturally pos

sible on the earth. He, like many
scientists, do not want to be
burned by falling for another pos
itive result that turns out to be
experimental error.
Despite the need for skepticism,
others have seen tremendous
promise in the experiments. For
example, EPRI, which is funded
privately by the energy industry,
has even begun making a docu
mentary on cold fusion.
Although cold fusion might be
come one of the greatest self
delusions in history, EPRI had
gambled because the stakes are
so high. As a result of the excite

ment over cold fusion, Huggins,
who gets his funds from EPRI,
works without worrying too much
about funding difficulties.
During the summer the Hug
gins team has scrambled to get
back into the action of cold fusion
research. Because of building
renovations, he had to move his
lab to another building, and the
move disrupted the research
schedule for two months.
Meanwhile, Huggins changed
his entire operation, redesigning
everything from the data collec
tion apparatus to the calorimeters
that measure heat.

Gone is the red Rubbermaid pic
nic cooler that housed the baby
food sized jars producing the
fusion. Now Huggins uses a blue
picnic cooler to hold the five high
tech jars that will house the ap
paratus. A Macintosh 11X
computer will collect the data and
spit the results out immediately,
cutting down the amount of data
analysis.
"We're just about back in busi
ness," Huggins says as he
prepares to begin his new research
later this week.
The team hopes to have results
sometime in the next few weeks.
