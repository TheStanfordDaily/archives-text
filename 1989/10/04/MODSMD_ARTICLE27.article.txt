# The 						tooth fairy doesn't like it, but sugar may not be all that bad

### Sue Biggins 
Coke or diet Coke? What's the
difference? You lose weight by
drinking diet soda, right?
These are common questions
that pop up in the ongoing debate
about the benefits of artificial
sweeteners. A widespread belief
that sugar is harmful has made
artificial sweeteners very popular
in recent years.

However, it has never been
shown that artificial sweeteners
aid in weight loss or control. Some
studies indicate that artificial
sweeteners may even increase ap
petite.
Nor has it been shown that
sugar poses any more of a threat
to the body than the increased
risk of cavities. Because they
replace sugar, artificial
sweeteners do help to prevent
tooth decay.
They are also good for diabetics
as a sugar replacement. However,

for the healthy person, it is ques
tionable whether artificial
sweeteners are really a healthy
alternative to sugar.
Before the 19705, cyclamates
and saccharin were the common
artificial sweeteners. Cyclamates
were proven carcinogenic and
banned in 1970.
Saccharin was later shown to
be carcinogenic, but is not banned
currently. Just after saccharin was
determined a carcinogen, a new
artifical sweetener was approved
by the Food and Drug Adminis
tration — aspartame. The sweet
ener is known to most people as
"Nutrasweet."
Because Nutrasweet is so new,
the long-term effects are un
known. The lifespan of a rat is
too short to indicate what the ef
fects of 50 years of Nutrasweet
consumption will be. Presently,
Nutrasweet has not been shown
to be carcinogenic.
There have been numerous
reports by people suffering from
physical disorders due to Nutras
weet. The most common side ef
fects are headaches, depression,
visual blurring, dizziness and con
fusion. Many women also report
menstrual problems due to
Nutrasweet consumption.
In 1981, the FDA set a maxi
mum safety level of 34 milligrams

of aspartame per kilogram body
weight per day in 1981. That limit
is estimated to be above 15 diet
drinks a day for a 150 pound
adult.
Although the FDA does not re
quire manufacturers to disclose
the amount of Nutrasweet in their
products, the content of most
products is small. Eating products
with Nutrasweet, therefore, is not
an immediate health hazard, but
excessive consumption should be
avoided.
Diet sodas are the most com
mon source of Nutrasweet. The
sweetener is also found in gelatin,
yogurt and numerous other prod
ucts. The sugar substitute Equal
contains aspartame, while sac
charin is the sweetener in Sweet
'n Low. If you are trying to avoid
saccharin, you should realize that
fountain machines dispensing
soda contain saccharin as well as
aspartame.
Although Nutrasweet has not
been shown to be unhealthy, try
to consume the sweetener in
moderation. The fate of all other
sweeteners has not been good, and
it is wise to be careful with all of
them.
Just remember, many studies
on the sweetener still are in prog
ress.
