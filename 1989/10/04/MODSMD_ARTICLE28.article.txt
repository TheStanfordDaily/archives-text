# What is the big fiber craze all about?
## 
### 
Health reports often buzz
about the benefits of a high fiber
diet. Similarly, advertisers boast
about their product's fiber con
tent, and we have all seen oat
bran added to just about every
thing. Even with all the atten
tion fiber has received, it is still
unclear to many what fiber
really is and why it is important.
What is fiber?
Fiber refers to substances
found in plant foods that are
not digestible by human en
zymes. Although gut bacteria
can digest some types of fiber,
the calorie contribution from
these is close to nothing. There
fore, fiber is basically calorie
free.
What kinds of fiber are there ?
There are two basic kinds â€”
soluble and insoluble. Soluble fi
ber is the cholesterol-lowering
fiber that is mostly digestible.
Insoluble fiber is not digestible,
and helps to prevent colon can
cer by decreasing the transit
time of food in the digestive
tract. This decreases the car

cinogens' exposure time in the
tract.
How does fiber lower choles
terol?
Soluble fiber binds to choles
terol, preventing it from circu
lating in the plasma. Soluble fi
ber decreases heart disease be
cause plasma cholesterol is
linked to heart disease.
What else is good about fiber?
Fiber is good for weight con
trol because it is naturally found
in low-fat, low-sugar foods and
is itself very low-calorie. It also
aids in weight control because
it binds to the bile necessary
for fat digestion. Bile breaks
down fat so it can be digested;
when there is less bile available,
you cannot digest as much fat.
Fiber is good for satiety be
cause it is bulky and absorbs
water, making you feel full
faster. Additionally, fiber
creates a bulkier stool to help
protect against constipation.
Is there anything bad about
fiber?

Too much of just about any
thing is not good. An excessive
fiber intake may prevent absorp
tion of important and essential
nutrients. Because Americans
have such a low fiber intake,
this is actually not a common
problem.
How much fiber is healthy?
The current recommended
daily allowance is 30 to 40
grams.
What foods are high in fiber?
Whole grains, beans
(garbonzo and kidney espe
cially), seeds, fresh fruits, brown
rice and fresh vegetables are all
high in fiber.
How can I increase my fiber
intake at Stanford?
Wilbur bread is a good whole
grain bread. Eat whole wheat
instead of white bread on sand
wiches and toast. Eat lots of
fresh fruit. The dorm salad bars
usually have lots of vegetables,
including beans.
