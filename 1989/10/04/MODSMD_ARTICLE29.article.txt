Q./ just started an office job.
• / spend the day photocopy
ing — a Stanford education put
to good use. Between feeding in

originals and pushing the magic
start button I've had some time
to wonder — how do these mac
hines actually work?
A. The photocopier is truly an
• amazing machine. Just
think, without it, there would be
no ASSU lecture notes and no
Poli Sci 35 readers to carry
around in your backpack.
But despite its weighty impli
cations (you didn't think you'd
get through a column with no bad
puns), the basic copier concept
isn't too difficult to understand.
At least not the way David Owens
explains it in the February 1986
Atlantic Monthly where he also
writes, "Much of journalism con
sists of photocopying things that
other people have written and
finding slightly better ways to
write them again." If nothing else,
my version is shorter.
The heart of a typical plain
paper copier is a cylinder called
a "photoreceptor." The surface of
the cylinder is coated with a spe
cial substance, called selenium,
that holds a static electric charge,
but only in the dark.
When the surface is exposed to
light, it discharges. The element
selenium is one of the few mate
rials that has this property of
"photoconductivity," and it is
commonly used in copy machines.
In a photocopier, a very strong
light is shined against the docu
ment of your choice (or in your

eyes if you don't close the cover).
A system of mirrors and lenses
transfers light reflected from the
paper to the charged photorecep
tor. Where the document was
dark, the cylinder stays charged;
where it was light, the cylinder
loses its charge.
Next the exposed part of the
cylinder is coated with toner, a
very fine powder of dry ink par
ticles. The toner sticks to the
charged parts of the cylinder in
the same way that socks stick to
gether if you put them in the
dryer without fabric softener.
The cylinder now rolls over a
piece of blank paper and prints
an exact copy of your original doc
ument. A small heater, called a
"fuser," warms up the paper, mel
ting the toner so it will stick per
manently. Meanwhile, the cylinder
is decharged and cleaned, ready
to start over again.
Color photocopiers are only

slightly more complicated. A copy
is made using a filter that blocks
out all but the magenta light and
is printed with magenta colored
ink. Two more copies are made
on top of the first with cyan (blue
green) and yellow ink. As you may
have learned in first grade art,
by mixing these three you can
make any color you want. (The
same thing works with red, blue
and green, but the copier makers
seem to like the fancier names).
Laser printers work in about
the same way as photocopiers.
However, instead of reflecting
light off a document, the light
comes to the photoreceptor
straight from a computer driven
laser.

W . Stanford student submit
brilliant, original, scintillating
questions to your column?
A .You've asked an excellent
• question. Submitting Sci
ence Bug questions is actually
very easy. You go to The Stanford
Daily offices, walk in the front
door and look straight ahead.
There, painfully thumbtacked on
a very hard cementlike wall
(cleverly disguised with wallpaper
so it looks like a normal bulletin
board), is the Science Bug box.
Simply write your question on a
piece of paper, fold it up and slip
it in the slot. That's all! It's easy.
