NASA looks to Stanford for pointers
Stanford physicist Arthur Walker Jr. has been selected to head
a $120 million project to build high-resolution telescopes for the
U.S. space station Freedom.
Walker will build pointers that are capable of directing the
high-resolution telescopes to the correct place in space so that
scientists can study the sun, planets, stars and the galaxy. Walker
estimates that his lab will get $35 million over the next six or
seven years to fund the pointer research.
Last year, Walker and his graduate student, Joakim Lindblom,
announced they had developed the first X-ray telescope that
obtained the most detailed images of the sun yet. A similar
telescope will accompany the multi-billion dollar space station
if it ever gets off the ground.
Neuroscientists navigate the brain
Stanford University neuroscientists have discovered evidence
of a "navigation" system important to the development of the
brain.
The system consists of a group of "pioneering" nerve cells in
the fetal brain which maps pathways for later-growing adult
nerve fibers to reach their destination, the researchers said.
According to Neurobiology Prof. Carla Schatz, "It's as if early
on, somebody leaves a trail of bread crumbs that later nerve
fibers can follow to get to the right place."
The finding is important because it is from the study of such
developmental scaffolds and their roie in brain development that
scientists hope to better understand the function of the central
nervous system and its diseases.
While this basic research does not have clinical applications,
it may provide clinical lessons, Schatz said. "You can imagine,
for instance, that certain congenital neurological defects that
occur during development might come about if these pioneer
neurons were to make mistakes, thereby leading the later
growing connections down the wrong path."
