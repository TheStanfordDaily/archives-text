## Cardinal backfield still limping for Notre Dame 
### Chris Crader Editorial staff 
A funny thing happened on the
way to the Coliseum.
Coach Denny Green and his
Christians had a strange idea. It
went something like this:
"These lions aren't that tough.
I mean they're pretty good and
all, but we're pretty good too. I
have this feeling that if we do our
best, we could pull off the biggest
upset Rome has ever seen."
Well, perhaps the comparison
isn't quite exact, but the Cardinal
football team is currently a 20V2-
point underdog to top-ranked
Notre Dame. Despite this, how
ever, Green and the Stanford
players believe Stanford can
knock off the nation's No. 1 team.
With a good week of prepara
tion and some good schemes —
and Green and his staff have some

good schemes — "we've got a
great chance to go out there and
pull off a major upset," center
Chuck Gillingham said at Stan
ford's weekly press conference
yesterday."I wouldn't stand up
here and tell you that if I didn't
truly believe it."
"We have to play a mistake-free
football game to win and we ha
ven't done that yet, but I think
we can."
Stanford enters the game 1-3
overall after losing to San Jose
State Saturday in one of the
wildest offensive affairs Stanford
Stadium has seen in some time.
Notre Dame, meanwhile, comes
west with a 4-0 record after pum
meling Purdue 40-7 last Saturday.
Of course, if you ask Irish
Coach Lou Holtz, the greatest
woofer of all time, Stanford should
be about a three-point favorite.
After Holtz belittled his own team

some, a reporter asked him if he
thought Notre Dame was over
rated this year.
"If people are saying we're the
No. 1 team, one of the top three
teams in the country, then yes, I
think we're overrated," he said.
"I would say that we are not a
top-10 team at this time."
Holtz went on to say that the
Irish may have as many talented
starters as last year's national
champions, but the team is rather
short on depth, especially at run
ning back. That is something
Green can appreciate, as all the
depth the Cardinal had at running
back is spending most of its time
in the training room getting treat
ment.
The Stanford backfield should
definitely look better-populated
than it did against San Jose Strte,

however. The team's top two full
backs, Scott Eschelman and
Toiamy Vardell, both may play.
Eschelman missed Saturday's
game with a cervical nerve pinch
but will likely be ready for the
Irish.
Vardell, who had a bruised col
larbone entering the San Jose
State contest, ran like
gangbusters the first quarter last
week then rebruised his collar
bone. Green expects that Vardell
could be practicing again as soon
as today, however.
At halfback, Charlie Young and
Jay Jay Lasley are both still out
but Jon Volpe just might be ready
to go come Saturday. The only
other major injuries are the sore
back of outside linebacker Rob
Hinckley and the injured shoulder
of quarterback Brian Johnson.
Hinckley should be able to play,
according to Green, but the jury
is still out on Johnson.
But despite all these question
marks, Green and Co. still think
they can win. "The biggest thing
you've gotta do against Notre
Dame is not let them get a big
lead," Green said. "You don't want
to spot them 14 points early. Like
other good teams, the longer you
can stay with them, the more vul
nerable they get. We feel we can
play with Notre Dame."
