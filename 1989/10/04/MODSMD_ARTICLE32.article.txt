Hype. Isn't it great?
Sports journalists across the land bom
bard us each day with some outlandish
prediction or some outrageous claim.
Hardly a week goes by without a mention
of someone being the "best ever in their
sport."
Turn to the sports page of any major
metropolitan daily. You'll find results.
You'll find features. You'll find news of
the latest scandal. And, you'll find hype.
The Bay Area is particularly strong in
the hype department. With the 49ers —
the best football team of all time; Roger
Craig — baseball's best manager; and
Don Nelson — a basketball genius in the
John Wooden mold, there's no shortage
of hyperbole.
Writers for The Daily, I must admit,
are guilty of the same crime as our pro
fessional counterparts. We tell you how
many national championships Stanford

will win, we tell you how great the new
recruits will be, we tell you all sorts of
things that probably aren't true.
It's all part of the business. Sports is
supposed to be fun. All the armchair
athletes in the world (myself included)
live their lives vicariously through sports
figures to make themselves feel better.
If I use this space to tell you all the
reasons why Notre Dame will blow Stan
ford off the football field Saturday it's
not going to be a lot of fun.
Everyone knows that the Irish are the
national champs. They're undefeated so
far this season. The Cardinal is 1-3. Notre
Dame has the best team speed in college
football. Without sugarcoating it, Stan
ford does not have the best team speed

in college football.
Having fun yet?
Of course not. What we all really want
to hear is this: "In Saturday's Stanford-
Notre Dame game, the Cardinal will do
the improbable, if not the impossible.
Stanford will shock the complacent Irish
and leave the field with a 24-20 victory."
"I told you I didn't think we could
beat them," Coach Lou Holtz will say
afterward. "I warned our guys to be
ready, but they obviously weren't."
No, no, I mean it. We're going to win
Saturday. Before 86,000 screaming fans,
the Cardinal is going to leave the Fighting
Irish dumbfounded. Stanford will beat
the No. 1 team in the country!
Yes!
I can't wait for the kickoff. Ever since
the gun sounded in the San Jose State
game, I've been anxious. I predicted the
upset late Saturday afternoon and I'm
sticking to my guns.
For me, the sports writer, it's a "can't
lose" deal. Let's say Stanford does win
(and they will), I look like a genius. If
the score is 24-20, I look like Wile E.
Coyote Supergenius.
Okay, let's say the Cardinal gets killed.
You figure I was just adding to the hype

by making the pick in the first place. My
vaticination of a Notre Dame defeat gets
lumped in the circular file with all the
failed sports picks that came before it.
In recent years, Sports Illustrated
called the Cleveland Indians the best
team in the American League, predicted
Dan Pasqua would win the home run
title and tabbed Kelly Downs as the Cy
Young Award Winner. The SI wizards
even selected Wyoming as their preseason
No. 1 in college basketball.
Recently they told us that Stanford
freshman Bob Whitfield would be an NFL

All-Pro in 1995.
Outside of the Whitfield pick (on which
the jury is still out), the experts at
America's foremost sports authority
didn't do too well.
Has anyone stopped buying SI? Outside
of a couple of nuns angered by the swim
suit issue, I don't think so.
Will you stop reading The Daily if
Notre Dame wins? I certainly hope not.
You'll probably be back to read about
how Stanford will go to the Rose Bowl
next year, how the women's tennis team
will win 10 straight NCAA crowns and
how Mike Montgomery's recruiting
prowess has assured us of 20-win seasons
well into the future.
