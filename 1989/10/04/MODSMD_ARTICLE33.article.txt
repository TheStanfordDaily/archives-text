OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) - Is
there anything the Oakland
Athletics can't do?
Power. Pitching. Speed.
The dimension Rickey Hen
derson added to the A's was
never more evident than in
Game 1 of the best-of-7 Amer
ican League playoffs on Tues
day night.
Henderson broke up a poten
tial double play ball with a hard
slide into second baseman Nel
son Liriano in the sixth inning
as the A's rallied to beat
Toronto 7-3.
"It was a great slide," Hen
derson said. "With my speed I
have to get down there."
Dave Stewart, who also
opened the last season's playoff
sweep against Boston, pitched
with his heart to give the A's
the advantage over Toronto.
Toronto starter Dave Stieb
took a 3-2 lead into the sixth
inning when Mark McGwire led
off with a long home run over

the left-field fence to tie it.
One out later, Tony Phillips
singled and stole second. Jim
Acker replaced Stieb and Mike
Gallego legged out an infield
single.
Acker then hit Henderson on
the wrist to load the bases.
"It's got a little swelling, but
it's OK," Henderson said.
Carney Lansford, who
finished second in batting in
the AL at .336, hit a hard
grounder to Tony Fernandez
at short that looked like a sure
double play.
Fernandez made the flip to
get the force, but Henderson
was down to second in a flash
and his slide caused Liriano to
make a wild throw allowing two
runs to score.
"That was a situation we
couldn't let get away," Hender
son said. "That was the game."
Lansford was given an RBI, but
Henderson gets the credit.
"It was a double play ball all
the way," Toronto manager Cito
Gaston said. "Nelson had a good
grip. If he makes a good throw
we have him."
Henderson came back to Oak
land on June 20 in a trade with
the New York Yankees and
sparked the A's offense the rest
of the season. He led the league
with 77 steals, including 52 of 58
with Oakland.
"I'm part of it, but it's our big
guys who get it going," Henderson
said.
"That's our style," Oakland
manager Tony La Russa said.
"We're a very aggressive team."
Stewart allowed five hits,
struck out six and walked three
in eight innings. Stewart, who has
three consecutive 20-game sea
sons, has won nine of his last 11
decisions against the Blue Jays.
Dennis Eckersley, who had 33
saves, got the last three outs in
a no-save situation.
Game 2 of the playoffs is sched
uled for 12:06 p.m. PDT Wednes
day. Todd Stottlemyre (7-7) is
scheduled to start for the Blue
Jays against Mike Moore (19 -11).
The playoffs shift to the
Sky Dome on Friday. The Blue
Jays won 20 of their last 26 home
games.
Ernie Whitt, the last original
Blue Jay, gave the Blue Jays a
3-1 lead when he led off the fourth
inning with a home run.
Oakland closed to within 3-2 in
the fifth when Lansford singled

'I'm part of it, but
it's our big guys
who get it going.'

with one out, stole second and
scored on Dave Parker's opposite
field, broken-bat single to left. In
postseason play last season,
Parker did not have an RBI in
27 at-bats.
The pitching duel that was ex
pected got off to a shaky start as
neither Stewart nor Stieb had
command.
Stieb walked Henderson leading
off the first inning. Henderson
swiped second but Stieb got out
of the jam.
George Bell, who started in left
field despite a sore right elbow,
led off the second with a single
and moved to third when Fernan
dez followed with a hit-and-run
single to left field. With Whitt
batting, Fernandez stole second.
Whitt hit a 3-2 pitch to center
field for a sacrifice fly. Kelly
Gruber walked and, after Lee
Mazzilli struck out, Liriano sin
gled home Fernandez to make it
2-0.
Liriano, who batted .263, was
a .311 hitter with runners in scor
ing position.
The A's, 54-27 at home, came
right back in the bottom of the
second when Dave Henderson led
off with a home run deep over
the left-field fence.
The A's added two runs in the
eighth when Gallego scored on
Duane Ward's wild pitch and
Lansford singled home Rickey
Henderson.

the New York Yankees and
sparked the A's offense the rest
of the season. He led the league
with 77 steals, including 52 of 58
with Oakland.
"I'm part of it, but it's our big
guys who get it going," Henderson
said.
"That's our style," Oakland
manager Tony La Russa said.
"We're a very aggressive team."

struck out six and walked three
in eight innings. Stewart, who has

Dennis Eckersley, who had 33
saves, got the last three outs in
a no-save situation.

the fifth when Lansford singled

who get it going.'

with one out, stole second and
scored on Dave Parker's opposite
field, broken-bat single to left. In
postseason play last season,
Parker did not have an RBI in
27 at-bats.
The pitching duel that was ex
pected got off to a shaky start as
neither Stewart nor Stieb had
command.
Stieb walked Henderson leading
off the first inning. Henderson
swiped second but Stieb got out
of the jam.
George Bell, who started in left
field despite a sore right elbow,
led off the second with a single
and moved to third when Fernan
dez followed with a hit-and-run
single to left field. With Whitt
batting, Fernandez stole second.
Whitt hit a 3-2 pitch to center
field for a sacrifice fly. Kelly
Gruber walked and, after Lee
Mazzilli struck out, Liriano sin
gled home Fernandez to make it
2-0.
Liriano, who batted .263, was
a .311 hitter with runners in scor
ing position.
The A's, 54-27 at home, came
right back in the bottom of the
second when Dave Henderson led
off with a home run deep over
the left-field fence.
The A's added two runs in the
eighth when Gallego scored on
Duane Ward's wild pitch and
Lansford singled home Rickey
Henderson.
OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) - Is
there anything the Oakland
Athletics can't do?
Power. Pitching. Speed.
The dimension Rickey Hen
derson added to the A's was
never more evident than in
Game 1 of the best-of-7 Amer
ican League playoffs on Tues
day night.
Henderson broke up a poten
tial double play ball with a hard
slide into second baseman Nel
son Liriano in the sixth inning
as the A's rallied to beat
Toronto 7-3.
"It was a great slide," Hen
derson said. "With my speed I
have to get down there."
Dave Stewart, who also
opened the last season's playoff
sweep against Boston, pitched
with his heart to give the A's
the advantage over Toronto.
Toronto starter Dave Stieb
took a 3-2 lead into the sixth
inning when Mark McGwire led
off with a long home run over

the left-field fence to tie it.
One out later, Tony Phillips
singled and stole second. Jim
Acker replaced Stieb and Mike
Gallego legged out an infield
single.
Acker then hit Henderson on
the wrist to load the bases.
"It's got a little swelling, but
it's OK," Henderson said.
Carney Lansford, who
finished second in batting in
the AL at .336, hit a hard
grounder to Tony Fernandez
at short that looked like a sure
double play.
Fernandez made the flip to
get the force, but Henderson
was down to second in a flash
and his slide caused Liriano to
make a wild throw allowing two
runs to score.
"That was a situation we
couldn't let get away," Hender
son said. "That was the game."
Lansford was given an RBI, but
Henderson gets the credit.
"It was a double play ball all
the way," Toronto manager Cito
Gaston said. "Nelson had a good
grip. If he makes a good throw
we have him."
