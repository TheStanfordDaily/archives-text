OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) - Is
there anything the Oakland
Athletics can't do?
Power. Pitching. Speed.
The dimension Rickey Hen
derson added to the A's was
never more evident than in
Game 1 of the best-of-7 Amer
ican League playoffs on Tues
day night.
Henderson broke up a poten
tial double play ball with a hard
slide into second baseman Nel
son Liriano in the sixth inning
as the A's rallied to beat
Toronto 7-3.
"It was a great slide," Hen
derson said. "With my speed I
have to get down there."
Dave Stewart, who also
opened the last season's playoff
sweep against Boston, pitched
with his heart to give the A's
the advantage over Toronto.
Toronto starter Dave Stieb
took a 3-2 lead into the sixth
inning when Mark McGwire led
off with a long home run over

the left-field fence to tie it.
One out later, Tony Phillips
singled and stole second. Jim
Acker replaced Stieb and Mike
Gallego legged out an infield
single.
Acker then hit Henderson on
the wrist to load the bases.
"It's got a little swelling, but
it's OK," Henderson said.
Carney Lansford, who
finished second in batting in
the AL at .336, hit a hard
grounder to Tony Fernandez
at short that looked like a sure
double play.
Fernandez made the flip to
get the force, but Henderson
was down to second in a flash
and his slide caused Liriano to
make a wild throw allowing two
runs to score.
"That was a situation we
couldn't let get away," Hender
son said. "That was the game."
