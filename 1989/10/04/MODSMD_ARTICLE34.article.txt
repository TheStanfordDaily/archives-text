EL SEGUNDO, Calif. (AP) -
Art Shell became the first black
head coach in modern NFL his
tory Tuesday, when he was named
to replace Mike Shanahan, who
was fired by the Los Angeles
Raiders.
Shell, 42, who was the Raiders'
offensive line coach, was named
to the Pro Football Hall of Fame
this year. He retired as a player
after the 1982 season after 15
years as one of the top offensive
tackles in pro football, all with
the Raiders, and immediately
joined the team's coaching staff.
IDavis interviewed first-year
Stanford coach Denny Green
before hiring Shell, the Associated
Press reported. Green, who is also
black, was an assistant coach for
the San Francisco 49ers before
being hiring by Stanford. How
ever, Stanford athletic depart
ment officials denied knowledge
of any contact between the
Raiders and Green. Raider offi
cials could not be reached for com

ment.
"No coach likes to see another
coach relieved of his duties. But
in the coaching profession, one
person's missed opportunity is an
other person's opportunity of a
lifetime," Green said.
"I want to wish the best to Art
Shell. He's a fantastic man. He's
an excellent football coach and a
diehard Raider," Green continued.
"I know that he's an advocate of
cooperation and communication.
And I feel very positively that all
signs for the Raiders will be point
ing up under his leadership and
direction."]
Shell joined the Raiders as a
third-round draft choice in 1968
from Maryland State, now
Maryland-Eastern Shore. He
played in 207 NFL games, the
third-highest total in Raiders' his
tory, and played in the Pro Bowl
eight times.
In 1923, Fritz Pollard became
the first black to coach an NFL
team, when the Hammond, Ind.,

Pros named him player-coach.
A press conference was sched
uled at 6:30 p.m. EDT to intro
duce Shell as the Raiders' head
coach.
Shanahan, 37, was in the sec
ond year of a three-year contract.
The Raiders are 1-3 this season,
having lost to AFC West oppo
nents Kansas City, Denver and
Seattle the past three weeks.
Shanahan was 7-9 in his first
season as coach last year.
Shanahan left the Raiders'
training facility about 30 minutes
after being told by A 1 Davis, the
team's managing general partner,
that he had been fired. Shanahan
wouldn't discuss the matter with
the media.
Shanahan was hired Feb. 29,
1988, to replace Tom Flores, who
retired after being the Raiders'
head coach for nine seasons. In
1987, Flores' final season, the
team had a 5-10 record, its worst
in 25 years.
The Raiders won two Super

Bowls under Flores, after the
1980 season while they were still
playing in Oakland and following
the 1983 campaign, their second
in Los Angeles. Including postsea
son games, the Raiders were 91-
56-0 under Flores.
Flores now is general manager
of the Seahawks, who beat the
Raiders 24-20 Sunday at the Los
Angeles Coliseum despite trailing
17-7 after three quarters.
Despite their losing record in
1988, the Raiders would have won
the championship in their weak
division had they beaten the
Seahawks in the season finale at
the Coliseum. But Seattle won a
wild 43-37 decision.
Davis opted for Shanahan over
several Raiders' assistants who
wanted the job after Flores
stepped down. Shell was one of
those assistants.
