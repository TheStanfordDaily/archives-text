# Booters to challenge the Gaels
## 
### Michael Clayton 
The time has come to remember
what happened last autumn to the
Stanford women's soccer team.
After compiling an exceptional
13-4-2 regular-season record, the
Cardinal was overlooked by the
NCAA selection committee. But
the real shock was that the selec
tion committee bypassed what
most people believed to be the
region's No. 2 and No. 3 teams,
UC-Santa Barbara and Stanford,
respectively, to select St. Mary's
College.
The Gaels, a team which Stan
ford had beaten earlier in the
season, were chosen along with
California as the only representa
tives from the West.
Today, at 3:30 p.m., Stanford,
ranked 16th nationally, will visit
that NCAA postseason represen
tative when they travel to Mot *
to face the 12th-ranked Gaels.
Again this year, these two teams
will be among those vying for
spots in the postseason tourna
ment. Currently, in another poll,
Stanford is ranked second in the
West region; St. Mary's is third.

Judging from last year's selection
process, only one of these teams
will receive the highly treasured
invitation.
"I cannot say that this is the
game of the year for us," Coach
Berhane Andeberhan stated, "but
it definitely is one of those games
in which we need to play well."
According to Andeberhan, the
NCAA committee will heavily con
sider the games between the top
-20 teams in determining the
postseason selections. "We don't
. "e to win all of our top-20
gamer*, we need to win some
of them. I. we split these games,
we will be in excellent shape," he
said. "We have already beaten top
-20 Division 11 squads; now we
need to mark up a couple top-20

Division I victories."
Today's game will pit the Car
dinal against a very solid, well
rounded St. Mary's squad. The
Gaels (8-2-1), strengthened by a
program well-supported with ath
letic scholarships, have had an ex
cellent recruiting season and will
field a team that, according to
Andeberhan, is solid in every
aspect of the game.
The Cardinal (6-2), coming off
an impressive 4-1 exhibition vic
tory against an alumnae team
Saturday, will take the field
fighting off internal challenges.
Freshman Kirby Seale, freshman
Katie Geib, and junior Jenny
Bloomer have each missed prac
tices this week due to illness, and
freshman .Jennifer Potok and
sophomore Heather Mclntyre
have both been recovering from
injuries.
Against Santa Clara, the Car
dinal started slowly, falling behind
3-0 early in the game, but rallied
before losing 4-3. "One of our
main objectives is to be playing
at full steam when the opening
whistle blows," Andeberhan
noted.
