# Golfers run out of steam in Butler National
## Stanford's Cevaer lands second with 77 
### Brian W. Webber 
After entering yesterday's final round as
the leader, sophomore Christian Cevaer
posted a five-over-par 77 at the ninth an
nual Butler National Invitational Classic
to finish in second place.
The men's golf team completed its
opening tournament of the fall season in
eighth place, 28 strokes behind victorious
Oklahoma State.
Coming off rounds of 73 and 71, Cevaer
entered yesterday's competition with sole
possession of first place. His three-day total
of 221 was two off the pace set by Scott
Heinlein of Oklahoma State, who claimed
the individual title.
Cevaer saw his lead disintegrate with a
disastrous 15th hole at the Butler National
Golf Course in suburban Chicago. His triple
bogey on that hole dashed all hopes for
victory.
Stanford Coach Wally Goodwin described
Cevaer's play as "simply outstanding."
Goodwin felt that Cevear's tournament was
even more impressive in light of the defend
ing Pacific 10 Conference champion's
rigorous summer schedule.
After classes ended in June, Cevaer re
turned to his native France and won the
final two events of the season. He imme
diately returned to Stanford and had only
a few days to unwind before leaving for
the Butler Invite. "He hardly had time to
catch his breath," Goodwin said.

In team competition, the final round
proved troublesome for the Cardinal
linksters. Despite ideal playing conditions,
Stanford dropped two places from its day
two finish. The squad was bested by Okla
homa State, the defending national cham
pion Oklahoma Sooners, Tulsa, Duke, USC,
Kent State, and Miami of Ohio.
The three Stanford seniors who journied
to Chicago experienced somewhat disap
pointing finishing performances. Don
Christiansen's 81 negated his excellent
early rounds of 76 and 77. Brad Benbrook
and Marc Funseth both shot well in qual
ifying play, but quickly learned just how
demanding the Butler course can be. Their
three-day totals of 246 and 239, respec
tively, are a testament to the difficulty
presented by the home of the PGA's West
ern Open.
Transfer junior Johan Remmeglas recov
ered from Tuesday's 84 by carding a fine
round of 78. Goodwin was especially
pleased by the adjustment Remmeglas has
made at Stanford. "Johan has adjusted
marvelously, both as an athlete and a per
son," Goodwin said.
Remmeglas' path to the Farm was cer
tainly circuitous. He came to Stanford from
Sweden via Florida Community College in
Jacksonville. He looks to have risen to the
challenge presented by the NCAA Division
I with remarkable speed.
Stanford now turns its attention to host
ing the U.S. Intercollegiate.
