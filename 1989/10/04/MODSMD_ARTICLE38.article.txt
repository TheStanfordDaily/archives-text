# Twins mirror Card cross country wins
## 
### Mark Anderegg 
Eric and Mark Mastalir were
the two top cross country pros
pects in the nation out of high
school four years ago and are the
two men expected to lead the
talented Cardinal cross country
squad this year.
But first and foremost, the
Mastalirs are simply good guys.
Doubly good. Because Mark and
Eric are identical twins.
"Eric and Mark are very work
able runners," said coach Scott
Chisam, who is in his fourth year
at Stanford. "They've always
given everything they could to me
and to the program. They are both
the type of runners I really enjoy
working with."
Eric suffered a very severe ac
hilles injury last year and was
forced to red shirt the track
season after finishing third in the
Pacific 10 Conference at 5000
meters in 1988. When asked about
trying to come back, his response
was adamant.
"If every time you had an injury
or a bad season you stopped run
ning," he said, "I would have
stopped running a hell of a long
time ago."
But he has not stopped, and
neither he nor his brother foresee
any problems this year.
Mark, who suffered a similar,
but less severe injury last year,
reflected on his past while assert
ing success for the Mastalirs this

season. "It [adversity] is some
thing I have to deal with," he
said. "Since it's come to this last
season, it's going to take a lot to
stop us. I think we'll get the job
done."
Although the intensity of this
pair of runners borders on ex
treme self-pressure, Eric and
Mark are able to successfully walk
the fine line between success and
utter failure. "They are extremely
intense, and at times a little nega
tive," said Chisam. "I joke with
them because they literally get
upset at the World when things
aren't going well. But when the
gun goes off, they are ready to go."
Thus far in the 1989 campaign
the Mastalirs seem ready to live
up to the dreams which accom
panied them when they graduated
from Jesuit High School in
Sacramento. On Sept. 16 in Min
neapolis the twins finished first
and third, sandwiching teammate
Bill Crowley. Eric completed the
eight kilometer course in a solid
25:32 and Mark was just behind
in 26:09. The next week in Co
lumbus, Ohio, Mark ran a great
time of 25:18 to finish second
overall. Although Eric missed the
Ohio State meet because of his
lingering achilles problem, the
Cardinal was still able to run its
season record to 2-0.
The Mastalirs will lead the Car
dinal charge this weekend as Stan
ford hosts the Stanford Invite.
Racing starts at 9 a.m. Saturday
