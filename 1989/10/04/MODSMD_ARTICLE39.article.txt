"My favorite president," confessed Art Buch
wald to a packed Kresge Auditorium last
night, "was Richard Nixon, who made me rich
when he said, 'I'm not a crook.' "
One of America's most popular humor
columnists, Buchwald won the 1982 Pulitzer
Prize for Outstanding Commentary and au
thored several books including the recent "I
Think I Don't Remember" and "While Reagan
slept."
Buchwald spoke with characteristic wit on
topics as diverse as his undergraduate expe
rience at USC and the National Rifle Associ
ation.

But politics provided Buchwald with fertile
hunting grounds. Remembering being with
Ronald Reagan when he said, "Trees cause
more pollution than automobiles," Buchwald
spoke of a sign he saw hanging from a tree
in California: "Chop me down before I kill
again."
Buchwald described his column as a "politi
cal cartoon in words," crediting politicians
with providing him a livelihood.
"I had high hopes for George Bush during
the campaign when he said the Japanese at
tacked Pearl Harbor on Sept. 7," he said.
Buchwald said that newspapers and
magazines provide him with ideas, adding that
real people and real situations are often fun

nier than any he can make up.
Nearly half of Buchwald's columns have
nothing to do with politics. He said his most
successful column was entitled, "How to have
an affair with your wife."
As a humor columnist, Buchwald said, "I
obviously have to be against everything."
Buchwald's wit won him a standing ovation.
Sophomore Jim Ron called it the "best one
man comedy show I have seen in a long time."
Junior Elisabeth Kalman found Buchwald
"much funnier than his columns."
Buchwald's speech was the first of the ASSU
Speakers Bureau presentations this quarter.
The Speakers Bureau has also scheduled
Kurtis Sliwa, founder of the Guardian Angels.
