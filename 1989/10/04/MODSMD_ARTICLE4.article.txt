# Double coverage
## Senior Class insured by University, ASSU policy 
### Tim Marklein Editorial staff 
In the past two weeks, the Senior
Class has gone from believing it had
no insurance coverage to actually
being covered twice.
Although the ASSU Senate removed
the class from its bylaws June 6 to
decrease insurance costs, the ASSU's
current insurance package — which
runs through March 1990 — assumes
the Senior Class as an ASSU organi
zation, according to ASSU Financial
Manager Sandra Leal.
The group's hasty removal from the
ASSU, which the Senior Class Presi
dents did not learn about until two
weeks ago, led the presidents to scurry
to arrange some coverage for the
group's events.
The presidents were told the current
ASSU policy ended Sept. 1, according
to Senior Class President Patrick
Devine.
Last Monday, the Senior Class Presi
dents met with University administra
tors to work out a plan to insure the
class's activities until an alternate ar
rangement can be worked out. The
resulting plan covers the class under
the University's $1 million self
insurance program, a blanket sum set
aside to pay for claims against student
groups or University departments.
That arrangement leaves the class
with two policies that include them,
a situation the presidents hope to solve
by petitioning for reinstatement as an
ASSU organization and ending their
status as a voluntary student organi
zation.
President Jeff Kritzer said the vo
luntary status does not fit the Senior
Class anyway, since all seniors are
members.
In a meeting with the ASSU Senate's
Administration and Rules Committee
last night, the presidents began their
battle by presenting the committee
with a three-page description of the
issue's history.
Since the Senior Class is already
included in the current ASSU cover-

The ASSU's current in
surance policy, which
lasts through March
1990, was negotiated
when the Senior Class
was still part of the
ASSU.

age, the senate has the option of
reinstating the Senior Class into the
bylaws with no added insurance ex
pense, at least until March 1990.
Leal said more factors must be taken
into account, though, since she is cur
rently preparing an informational
packet about the ASSU to send to
different insurance companies. Leal
said she will try to get two insurance
estimates, one including the Senior
Class and one excluding the class, but
the proper presentation remains un
certain.
"If we put them in the limelight,
how much is that going to bias the
insurance companies?" she said, add
ing that she will probably attach a
letter to the package explaining the
Senior Class situation.
The class was written out of the
bylaws soon after the senate learned
of the inflated cost of the ASSU's new
insurance policy, which was arranged
in March after the former insurer
pulled out of the California insurance
game. The new policy cost $45,000,
compared to the $15,000 policy from
the previous year, an increase that
may have been due to the short amount
of time the ASSU had to find another
insurer.
"We were forced to find another
company in a matter of days," Leal
said.
Constitution State, the company
that insured the ASSU for several pre
vious years, cut its California opera-
