# Double coverage
## Senior Class insured by University, ASSU policy 
### Tim Marklein Editorial staff 
In the past two weeks, the Senior
Class has gone from believing it had
no insurance coverage to actually
being covered twice.
Although the ASSU Senate removed
the class from its bylaws June 6 to
decrease insurance costs, the ASSU's
current insurance package — which
runs through March 1990 — assumes
the Senior Class as an ASSU organi
zation, according to ASSU Financial
Manager Sandra Leal.
The group's hasty removal from the
ASSU, which the Senior Class Presi
dents did not learn about until two
weeks ago, led the presidents to scurry
to arrange some coverage for the
group's events.
The presidents were told the current
ASSU policy ended Sept. 1, according
to Senior Class President Patrick
Devine.
Last Monday, the Senior Class Presi
dents met with University administra
tors to work out a plan to insure the
class's activities until an alternate ar
rangement can be worked out. The
resulting plan covers the class under
the University's $1 million self
insurance program, a blanket sum set
aside to pay for claims against student
groups or University departments.
That arrangement leaves the class
with two policies that include them,
a situation the presidents hope to solve
by petitioning for reinstatement as an
ASSU organization and ending their
status as a voluntary student organi
zation.
President Jeff Kritzer said the vo
luntary status does not fit the Senior
Class anyway, since all seniors are
members.
In a meeting with the ASSU Senate's
Administration and Rules Committee
last night, the presidents began their
battle by presenting the committee
with a three-page description of the
issue's history.
Since the Senior Class is already
included in the current ASSU cover-

The ASSU's current in
surance policy, which
lasts through March
1990, was negotiated
when the Senior Class
was still part of the
ASSU.

age, the senate has the option of
reinstating the Senior Class into the
bylaws with no added insurance ex
pense, at least until March 1990.
Leal said more factors must be taken
into account, though, since she is cur
rently preparing an informational
packet about the ASSU to send to
different insurance companies. Leal
said she will try to get two insurance
estimates, one including the Senior
Class and one excluding the class, but
the proper presentation remains un
certain.
"If we put them in the limelight,
how much is that going to bias the
insurance companies?" she said, add
ing that she will probably attach a
letter to the package explaining the
Senior Class situation.
The class was written out of the
bylaws soon after the senate learned
of the inflated cost of the ASSU's new
insurance policy, which was arranged
in March after the former insurer
pulled out of the California insurance
game. The new policy cost $45,000,
compared to the $15,000 policy from
the previous year, an increase that
may have been due to the short amount
of time the ASSU had to find another
insurer.
"We were forced to find another
company in a matter of days," Leal
said.
Constitution State, the company
that insured the ASSU for several pre
vious years, cut its California opera-
tions after Proposition 103 was
approved in last November's elec
tions. Tri-Star Indemnity now
carries the student government's
insurance.
All the policies were arranged
by insurance broker Darryl Nel
son, vice president of Marsh and
McClennan, a San Jose firm.
Once the Office of Student Af
fairs — which pays two-thirds of
the ASSU's insurance premiums
— learned of the new cost, they
told senators to look for ways to
decrease the liability cost. Elimi
nating the Senior Class and the
Boathouse was the first action
taken.
"It was the end of the year,
they were pushing stuff through
and this went with it," Senior
Class President Michael Roark
said.
Leal said the confusion over the
policy dates may have occurred
because the Constitution State
policy was written for September
to September, but the new policy
was initiated in March on an an
nual basis.
The presidents' handout to
senators made it clear that a law
suit by the parents of Robert
Yuan, a student who died from
hypothermia when his canoe cap
sized during a storm at Stanford's
Sierra Camp in the spring of 1988,
did not name the Senior Class.
According to the handout, only
the Alumni Association and Stan
ford University were named.
Yuan's death, and its associa
tion with a Senior Class event,
prompted a comment by Univer
sity insurance agents last spring
that the class might be a reason
for the tripling of the ASSU's in
surance expense.
"Someone will take a small
comment like that and blow it
up," Leal said. Because insurance
"experts" had mentioned the
Senior Class and the Boathouse
as possible reasons for the in

crease, she said the senate "acted
on everything that was said."
Kritzer said yesterday the class
wants to petition to rejoin the
ASSU permanently, since he pre
dicted insuring the Senior Class
does not substantially increase the
cost of the ASSU's general insur
ance.
University officials also expect
the Senior Class to again become
part of the ASSU. "As a creature
of the ASSU Bylaws, we expect
the presidents to try to get covered
by the ASSU," said Michael
Ramsey-Perez, director of Student
Organization Services.
The reinstatement decision may
not be as quick and easy as the
presidents would like, however.
Leal said she has not been able
to get a clear-cut price difference
from the insurance broker,
making it unclear whether inclu
sion of the Senior Class is a large
liability or not.
"It's hard for the ASSU because
it's not a typical company," she
said. "(The insurance companies)
need to have an idea about all
the things that are involved in
insuring the ASSU."
Roark said the insurance broker
said to him that "the quotes
would probably be about the
same," whether or not the Senior
Class was included.
Although the arrangement with
the University would take care of
the coverage, Kritzer said the
Senior Class would prefer the
ASSU arrangement.
"The (University arrangement)
adds a lot of extra paperwork, and
we'd rather be more indepen
dent," he said. "Now, any time
we go outside the University, like
getting outside contracts with a
DJ, we have to get the Universi
ty's permission beforehand."
Instead of keeping the Senior
Class out of the ASSU, Devine
suggested that the ASSU find a
less expensive insurance company.
"They could shop around a little
more. If the clothes at Nord
strom's are too expensive, then
maybe you should look at Macy's."

because the Constitution State
policy was written for September
to September, but the new policy
was initiated in March on an an
nual basis.
The presidents' handout to
senators made it clear that a law
suit by the parents of Robert
Yuan, a student who died from
hypothermia when his canoe cap
sized during a storm at Stanford's
Sierra Camp in the spring of 1988,
did not name the Senior Class.
According to the handout, only
the Alumni Association and Stan
ford University were named.
Yuan's death, and its associa
tion with a Senior Class event,
prompted a comment by Univer
sity insurance agents last spring
that the class might be a reason
for the tripling of the ASSU's in
surance expense.
"Someone will take a small
comment like that and blow it
up," Leal said. Because insurance
"experts" had mentioned the
Senior Class and the Boathouse
as possible reasons for the in

crease, she said the senate "acted
on everything that was said."
Kritzer said yesterday the class
wants to petition to rejoin the
ASSU permanently, since he pre
dicted insuring the Senior Class
does not substantially increase the
cost of the ASSU's general insur
ance.
University officials also expect
the Senior Class to again become
part of the ASSU. "As a creature
of the ASSU Bylaws, we expect
the presidents to try to get covered
by the ASSU," said Michael
Ramsey-Perez, director of Student
Organization Services.
The reinstatement decision may
not be as quick and easy as the
presidents would like, however.
Leal said she has not been able
to get a clear-cut price difference
from the insurance broker,
making it unclear whether inclu
sion of the Senior Class is a large
liability or not.
"It's hard for the ASSU because
it's not a typical company," she
said. "(The insurance companies)
need to have an idea about all
the things that are involved in
insuring the ASSU."
Roark said the insurance broker
said to him that "the quotes
would probably be about the
same," whether or not the Senior
Class was included.
Although the arrangement with
the University would take care of
the coverage, Kritzer said the
Senior Class would prefer the
ASSU arrangement.
"The (University arrangement)
adds a lot of extra paperwork, and
we'd rather be more indepen
dent," he said. "Now, any time
we go outside the University, like
getting outside contracts with a
DJ, we have to get the Universi
ty's permission beforehand."
Instead of keeping the Senior
Class out of the ASSU, Devine
suggested that the ASSU find a
less expensive insurance company.
"They could shop around a little
more. If the clothes at Nord
strom's are too expensive, then
maybe you should look at Macy's."
In the past two weeks, the Senior
Class has gone from believing it had
no insurance coverage to actually
being covered twice.
Although the ASSU Senate removed
the class from its bylaws June 6 to
decrease insurance costs, the ASSU's
current insurance package — which
runs through March 1990 — assumes
the Senior Class as an ASSU organi
zation, according to ASSU Financial
Manager Sandra Leal.
The group's hasty removal from the
ASSU, which the Senior Class Presi
dents did not learn about until two
weeks ago, led the presidents to scurry
to arrange some coverage for the
group's events.
The presidents were told the current
ASSU policy ended Sept. 1, according
to Senior Class President Patrick
Devine.
Last Monday, the Senior Class Presi
dents met with University administra
tors to work out a plan to insure the
class's activities until an alternate ar
rangement can be worked out. The
resulting plan covers the class under
the University's $1 million self
insurance program, a blanket sum set
aside to pay for claims against student
groups or University departments.
That arrangement leaves the class
with two policies that include them,
a situation the presidents hope to solve
by petitioning for reinstatement as an
ASSU organization and ending their
status as a voluntary student organi
zation.
President Jeff Kritzer said the vo
luntary status does not fit the Senior
Class anyway, since all seniors are
members.
In a meeting with the ASSU Senate's
Administration and Rules Committee
last night, the presidents began their
battle by presenting the committee
with a three-page description of the
issue's history.
Since the Senior Class is already
included in the current ASSU cover-

The ASSU's current in
surance policy, which
lasts through March
1990, was negotiated
when the Senior Class
was still part of the
ASSU.

age, the senate has the option of
reinstating the Senior Class into the
bylaws with no added insurance ex
pense, at least until March 1990.
Leal said more factors must be taken
into account, though, since she is cur
rently preparing an informational
packet about the ASSU to send to
different insurance companies. Leal
said she will try to get two insurance
estimates, one including the Senior
Class and one excluding the class, but
the proper presentation remains un
certain.
"If we put them in the limelight,
how much is that going to bias the
insurance companies?" she said, add
ing that she will probably attach a
letter to the package explaining the
Senior Class situation.
The class was written out of the
bylaws soon after the senate learned
of the inflated cost of the ASSU's new
insurance policy, which was arranged
in March after the former insurer
pulled out of the California insurance
game. The new policy cost $45,000,
compared to the $15,000 policy from
the previous year, an increase that
may have been due to the short amount
of time the ASSU had to find another
insurer.
"We were forced to find another
company in a matter of days," Leal
said.
Constitution State, the company
that insured the ASSU for several pre
vious years, cut its California opera-
tions after Proposition 103 was
approved in last November's elec
tions. Tri-Star Indemnity now
carries the student government's
insurance.
All the policies were arranged
by insurance broker Darryl Nel
son, vice president of Marsh and
McClennan, a San Jose firm.
Once the Office of Student Af
fairs — which pays two-thirds of
the ASSU's insurance premiums
— learned of the new cost, they
told senators to look for ways to
decrease the liability cost. Elimi
nating the Senior Class and the
Boathouse was the first action
taken.
"It was the end of the year,
they were pushing stuff through
and this went with it," Senior
Class President Michael Roark
said.
