# Janet Evans honored as top female athlete

NEW YORK (AP) - As she
has said before, Stanford fresh
man Janet Evans would rather
swim than count money.
After winning three gold
medals in the 1988 Olympic
Games at Seoul, she realized
the choice was hers to make.
"I had friends tell me that
all I had to do was sign and
I'd be set for life," Evans said
of the potential endorsements.
"I want to keep swimming. I
have no regrets about that."
So the selling of Janet Evans
never happened. Instead, the
18-year-old Californian,
honored last night as the Wom
en's Sports Foundation's
Amateur Sportswoman of the
Year, took her stroke to Stan
ford.
"The minute you talk to an
agent, your college eligibility is
over," said Evans, honored
along with tennis Grand Slam
winner Steffi Graf.
Graf was named Professional
Sportswoman of the year by
the foundation.
Evans is preparing for her
first intercollegiate competi
tion. She will swim against
arch-rival California in Stan
ford's first meet Nov. 17.
The Placentia, Calif., native
doesn't know which events
she'll swim for Coach Richard
Quick, who was also her coach
in the Olympics.
Evans, who won the 400- and
800-meter freestyle and the
400-meter individual medley at
Seoul, said she was widely
recruited during her senior
year at El Dorado High School.

'People say I can't
go any faster, but I
believe I can if I
keep training hard. I
train as hard as
anybody out there.'

"It came down to Stanford,
Texas, Florida and USC," she
said. "I really like it at Stan
ford."
She plans to msgor in com
munications. But there will be
little change in her workout
regimen, which includes weight
training to build more upper
body strength.
Evans, who began swimming
at age 4, holds world records
in the 400, 800 and 1,500 free
style events.
"People say I can't go any
faster, but 1 believe I can if I
keep training hard," Evans
said. "I train as hard as
anybody out there.
"I never get tired of it," she
said when asked if she could
be setting herself up for burn
out.
She will not ease off in train
ing.
"If you get a lackadaisical at
titude, that's when you don't
do well."
There's the 1992 Olympics
and the possibility of lucrative
endorsements.
