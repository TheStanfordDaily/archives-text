# Concern for Rodins sparks debate

Automobile fumes and emis
sions from a nearby parking lot
may add a devilish cast to Rodin's
"Gates of Hell" and other delicate
bronze sculptures in Stanford's
Rodin Sculpture Garden, Art His
tory Prof. Albert Elsen has
charged.
Debate over the vacant parking
lot's future, which has been raging
between Elsen and the Chemistry
Department for 11 months, may
come to a head this month when
the University Committee on
Parking and Transportation hears
the issue.
The disagreement began in No
vember 1988 when Chemistry De
partment Administration Services
Manager John Kennedy circulated
a petition asking the Office of
Transportation Programs to
reopen the temporary 50-car
parking lot between the Art
Museum and the Anatomy Build
ing.
When a nearby four-story
parking garage holding 1,000 cars
was built in 1985, the gravel lot

was closed. Now parking is sparse.
Because of the lack of parking
near the Keck Science Building,
"It's a highly emotional issue,"
said Kennedy.
"My interest is just driving to
work and finding a place to park,"
he said.
The petition, which was signed
by 135 members of the Chemistry
Department, worries Elsen. He
said that exhaust fumes, gravel
and dust from cars in the
reopened lot would damage the
bronze sculpures of the Rodin
Sculpture Garden.
"Those bronzes are of great aes
thetic, didactic and monetary
value," Elsen said. "The next step
would be to want to park in the
Sculpture Garden."
Opening the parking lot "would
only add to the pollution which
is a problem we have to fight,"
Elsen said.
"When that big parking garage
was put in, there was no environ
mental impact study made to de
termine the potential damaging
effects of automobile emission pol
lution being blown into the gar

den. Now, without any further
impact study, they want to add to
that," he said.
In a March letter to the Parking
and Transportation Committee,
Elsen and Art Museum Director
Lorenz Eitner proposed that a
grove of tall trees be planted in
place of the gravel lot "to provide
a buffer against the thousands of
daily auto emissions coming from
the garage to the windward side
of the garden."
The Committee on Parking and
Transportation has asked the
Planning Office to prepare a site
plan which would combine a tem
porary parking lot with additional
landscaping, according to Thomas
Auer, Office of Transportation
Programs manager. •
"We believe this would be a rea
sonable compromise between the
two competing interests," Auer
said.
"The parking lot is not perma
nent, since that is a long-term
building area for the museum,"
Auer said, noting that construc
tion will begin on a nearby
parking structure area in 1990.

Fumes and car emissions have Art History Prof. Albert Elsen worried. Elsen contends the bronze
sculpures of the Rodin Sculpture Garden may be damaged if a parking lot near the garden is reopened.
