# Tragedies to be phased out by June 1991

Laying out a plan to carry Stan
ford computing into the next dec
ade, Director of Academic
Information Systems Ralph Gorin
announced last week that the
TOPS-20 computer operating sys
tem, known as the Tragedies, will
be phased out by June 1991.
The Tragedies will be replaced
by a new variety of computer op
erating systems including UNIX
individual and community-shared
computers, individual Macin
toshes and, eventually, a NeXT
computer system.
Closing TOPS-20 will free up
enough funds to allow an expan

sion into new areas such as the
NeXT computer, Gorin said. To
balance the University budget, ex
pansion in future projects de
mands phasing out old ones, he
added.
Declining usage of the
Tragedies allowed AIR to close
down two of the Tragedies, Lear
and Othello, last year, and AIR
has proposed that Hamlet be shut
down at the end of the quarter,
leaving Macbeth as the sole sur
vivor of the quartet.
Installed at Stanford in 1976,
TOPS-20 originally provided com
puter science students with a sys
tem that was easy to program.
But now, most computer science

classes have switched to the even
easier Macintosh, Gorin said.
In addition, Gorin said the large
numbers of personal computers
on campus also have reduced the
need for basic computer instruc
tion formerly provided by TOPS
-20.
TOPS-20 has also fallen out of
favor with software engineers,
Gorin said. "Most of the software
activity going on today is in the
UNIX, Mac [systems], OS and
OS/2," Gorin said.
Computer mail and other work
done on the TOPS-20 system will
be moved to currently operating
UNIX systems by 1991.

Experts consider UNIX more
flexible than TOPS-20 because it
allows people to work on many
different computers, such as IBM.
UNIX also allows people to work
at a single computer workstation
rather than sharing a mainframe.
Although Gorin said that UNIX
is hard to learn, he noted that
researchers at Stanford and at
companies that create UNIX
software are taming UNIX with
user-friendly programs.
Gorin said that he welcomes
any comments on the closure of
TOPS-20. AIR will provide faculty
and staff with support during the
transition period, he added.
