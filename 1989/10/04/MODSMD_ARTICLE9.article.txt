Police watch party closely
Stanford Police presence at the Theta
Delta Chi Fraternity party over the weekend
lent some credence to speculation that the
department would step up enforcement fol
lowing Friday's early morning automobile
accident involving an intoxicated freshman.
Although Police Captain Marvin Moore
said that the department was "just following
long-standing policy" with its presence at
fraternity parties Friday and Saturday
nights, the patrols did seem out of the or
dinary to some.
Mureithi Davis, Theta Delt social chair,
said that four policemen patrolled outside
the Theta Delt house starting about 12:45
a.m.
"I'd never seen anything like that before,"
said Davis, who has been a member of the
Theta Delts for two years. "They seemed
to be watching for people (leaving the party)
with open containers. We're always very
strict about open containers — we never let
anyone carry them out the door."
However, Moore said the number of police
officers sent to the party was not unusual.
Even though a "minor incident" occurred
inside the party while the police were out
side, Davis said that the police did not stop
the party, but let fraternity members handle

the problem. Davis would not describe the
incident.
Davis said he appreciates that the police
are "putting frats in the driver's seat" when
it comes to alcohol control at parties. "We're
really responsible. We're not a bunch of
drunken fools who can't throw a party. We're
aware of the liability issue," Davis said.
"Their presence was kind of good. I sup
port them being there just in case we need
them," he said.
Freshman Scott Minkow, who was hit by
a pickup truck Friday morning, spent the
weekend at Stanford University Hospital
and was released Sunday.

Library director will retire
David Weber, director of the Stanford Uni
versity Libraries for the past 20 years, will
retire after a search is completed for his
successor. He is 65.
Provost James Rosse announced the im
pending change at the Sept. 28 Faculty Sen
ate meeting. He said he would name a search
committee during the current academic year.
Rosse said Weber had offered to step down
as of Aug. 31, 1989, but "I asked him to
stay on until an orderly succession could be

completed."
In a memorandum to library staff mem
bers, Weber said he had reached an age at
which he and University officials felt that
"change in administrative officers leads to
a healthy renewal of an organization."
Weber said he hoped to continue working
in some capacity on a part-time basis after
his retirement.
Weber said that in the coming months
the library will conduct a survey of faculty
and students concerning the adequacy of
collections and services, conduct a staff self
survey, formulate a new collection develop
ment budget model for the 1990s and es
tablish a new statement of goals and objec
tives for the period 1990 to 1995.
During his library career, Weber has
played a leading role in the design and con
struction of the Engineering, Earth Sciences,
Art and Biology libraries and the east wing
of Green Library. Total University library
collections have grown from one million to
more than five million volumes during his
tenure.
Weber was involved in development of the
Research Libraries Information Network,
which is the national database system of
the Research Libraries Group, and in the
creation of the Stanford-Berkeley coopera
tive program.
