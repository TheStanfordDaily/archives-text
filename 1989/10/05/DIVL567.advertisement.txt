The creator of the nationally syndicated comic strip "Cathy," will be
on hand to promote and sign her apparel line which includes cotton
T's with graphics depicting "Cathy" at Stanford. She will also sign
copies of her "Cathy" books, such as Men Should Come With Instruc
tion Booklets and Thin Thighs in Thirty Years. "Cathy" greeting cards
and gift items will also be available. This popular author rarely makes
public appearances and will only be visiting one other university in the
country in connection with this promotion.
