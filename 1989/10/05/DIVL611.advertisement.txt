"What separates this produce
department from the larger
chains is that we buy independ
ently. We have the option to buy
from the smaller farmers, and
as a result, we get the freshest,
highest quality produce avail
able. Most of it is organically
grown. Our produce is fresher,
it tastes better, and it has higher
nutritional value. We're giving
the customers something that
tastes better and is better
for them."
