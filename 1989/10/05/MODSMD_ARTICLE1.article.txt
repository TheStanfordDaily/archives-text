# 53 protesters sentenced, lectured
## 
### John Wagner Editorial staff 
Fifty-three of the protesters ar
rested in the May 15 takeover of
University President Donald Ken
nedy's office were sentenced yes
terday to 40 hours of community
service and six months probation
on the charge of trespassing.
Prior to sentencing the protest
ers, Judge Stephen Manley gave
a 15-minute lecture on the neces
sity to work within the law when
pushing for change. "We cannot
have a society without a willing
ness to work within the law," he
said.
Feeling they had exhausted all
other avenues of change, the
Agenda for Action coalition took
over Kennedy's office in May with
the hope of furthering multicul
turalism and democratic educa
tion at Stanford.
In June, Manley indicated how
the protesters would be punished
but said he wanted to delay formal
sentencing until yesterday so that
he could speak to the protesters
in person.
While Manley lauded the stu
dents' commitment to bettering
society and said the University
was the appropriate place to
create a dialogue about important
issues, he condemned their tac
tics.
"It is the framework in which
that dialogue takes place that con
cerns me," he said. "The Univer
sity is not always an ivory tower,
but it's not a combat zone either."

In a press conference following
the sentencing, coalition members
applauded the positive effects they
feel the takeover has had on the
University.
"We have secured the hiring of
an Asian-American history pro
fessor, the democratic selection of
a full-time dean for the Chicano
community, more money for
teaching assistants, a commitment
to funding for Native American
and Afro-American Studies and
affirmative action status for
Hawaiian-Americans," said Sop
hia Sorensen, speaking on behalf
of the ASSU's Committee on De

mocracy in Education, one of the
groups that staged the takeover.
"Our causes were just and ben
eficial to the whole student body
and our commitment has moved
the University one step closer to
a truly multicultural education,"
Sorensen said.
Manley indicated that those
sentenced yesterday would have
until Jan. 24 to perform 40 hours
of service either at a "minority
agency" or an agency which helps
the needy and homeless. Manley
told the protesters the punish
ment would be an opportunity to
both "make amends for what took

place" and to do "work at which
you can make a positive contri
bution."
Service hours imposed by Santa
Clara County will have to be
counted separately from the serv
ice hours which have been im
posed on the protesters by the
University, Manley said. Protest
ers are required to complete 75
hours of community service work
at Stanford for having violated
the University's Policy on Campus
Disruption.
Manley also said that if any of

Alto Municipal Court. Inside the courtroom, Taylor read a statement
on behalf of the group explaining the reasons for their actions.
the protesters engage in illegal ac
tivities during their six-month
probation period, they will face
much stiffer penalties. He said he
did not expect this to be the case.
"I see no reason for you ever to
return here," Manley said.
"You've demonstrated to me your
willingness to work within the law
during the next year."
Forty-seven of the protesters

entered pleas of "no contest" in
June to the charge of trespassing,
a misdemeanor, at which time As
st. District Attorney Tom Fahren
holz dropped four other mis
demeanor charges.
Yesterday four other students
— Diana Blank, Michael Roark,
Nadeem Hussain and Sathaya Tor
— entered the same plea and had
their other charges dropped as
well. Fahrenholz did not appear
in court.
Another four students — David
Adler, Hazim Ansari, Matt Price
and Paul Valudez — have been

charged with obstructing the
duties of a police officer in addi
tion to trespassing. These four
students will undergo sentencing
Friday.
Louis Jackson, who is facing six
charges — including incitement to
riot and battery — will return to
court Oct. 12 for another pre-trial
hearing. (See related article.)
Prior to sentencing the protest
ers, Manley agreed to listen to a
group statement read by BSU
member Cheryl Taylor on behalf
of the 53 students being sentenced.
Taylor called the statement an op

portunity "to explain who we are
and the reasons behind the bold
action we took."
The coalition, Taylor said,
"acted out of our deepest belief
in the fundamental ideals of Stan
ford, and more broadly, of this
country — that all people are
treated equal, and that our insti
tutions and education should
reflect that equality."
"It is in keeping with that spirit,
and out of respect for the laws of
this country, that we accept the
penalty for our demonstration."

the needy and homeless. Manley
told the protesters the punish
ment would be an opportunity to
both "make amends for what took

place" and to do "work at which
you can make a positive contri
bution."
Service hours imposed by Santa
Clara County will have to be
counted separately from the serv
ice hours which have been im
posed on the protesters by the
University, Manley said. Protest
ers are required to complete 75
hours of community service work
at Stanford for having violated
the University's Policy on Campus
Disruption.
Manley also said that if any of

on behalf of the group explaining the reasons for their actions.
the protesters engage in illegal ac
tivities during their six-month
probation period, they will face
much stiffer penalties. He said he
did not expect this to be the case.
"I see no reason for you ever to
return here," Manley said.
"You've demonstrated to me your
willingness to work within the law
during the next year."
Forty-seven of the protesters

entered pleas of "no contest" in
June to the charge of trespassing,
a misdemeanor, at which time As
st. District Attorney Tom Fahren
holz dropped four other mis
demeanor charges.
Yesterday four other students
— Diana Blank, Michael Roark,
Nadeem Hussain and Sathaya Tor
— entered the same plea and had
their other charges dropped as
well. Fahrenholz did not appear
in court.
Another four students — David
Adler, Hazim Ansari, Matt Price
and Paul Valudez — have been

charged with obstructing the
duties of a police officer in addi
tion to trespassing. These four
students will undergo sentencing
Friday.
Louis Jackson, who is facing six
charges — including incitement to
riot and battery — will return to
court Oct. 12 for another pre-trial
hearing. (See related article.)
Prior to sentencing the protest
ers, Manley agreed to listen to a
group statement read by BSU
member Cheryl Taylor on behalf
of the 53 students being sentenced.
Taylor called the statement an op

portunity "to explain who we are
and the reasons behind the bold
action we took."
The coalition, Taylor said,
"acted out of our deepest belief
in the fundamental ideals of Stan
ford, and more broadly, of this
country — that all people are
treated equal, and that our insti
tutions and education should
reflect that equality."
"It is in keeping with that spirit,
and out of respect for the laws of
this country, that we accept the
penalty for our demonstration."
Fifty-three of the protesters ar
rested in the May 15 takeover of
University President Donald Ken
nedy's office were sentenced yes
terday to 40 hours of community
service and six months probation
on the charge of trespassing.
Prior to sentencing the protest
ers, Judge Stephen Manley gave
a 15-minute lecture on the neces
sity to work within the law when
pushing for change. "We cannot
have a society without a willing
ness to work within the law," he
said.
Feeling they had exhausted all
other avenues of change, the
Agenda for Action coalition took
over Kennedy's office in May with
the hope of furthering multicul
turalism and democratic educa
tion at Stanford.
In June, Manley indicated how
the protesters would be punished
but said he wanted to delay formal
sentencing until yesterday so that
he could speak to the protesters
in person.
While Manley lauded the stu
dents' commitment to bettering
society and said the University
was the appropriate place to
create a dialogue about important
issues, he condemned their tac
tics.
"It is the framework in which
that dialogue takes place that con
cerns me," he said. "The Univer
sity is not always an ivory tower,
but it's not a combat zone either."

In a press conference following
the sentencing, coalition members
applauded the positive effects they
feel the takeover has had on the
University.
"We have secured the hiring of
an Asian-American history pro
fessor, the democratic selection of
a full-time dean for the Chicano
community, more money for
teaching assistants, a commitment
to funding for Native American
and Afro-American Studies and
affirmative action status for
Hawaiian-Americans," said Sop
hia Sorensen, speaking on behalf
of the ASSU's Committee on De

mocracy in Education, one of the
groups that staged the takeover.
"Our causes were just and ben
eficial to the whole student body
and our commitment has moved
the University one step closer to
a truly multicultural education,"
Sorensen said.
Manley indicated that those
sentenced yesterday would have
until Jan. 24 to perform 40 hours
of service either at a "minority
agency" or an agency which helps
the needy and homeless. Manley
told the protesters the punish
ment would be an opportunity to
both "make amends for what took

place" and to do "work at which

bution."
