# 'Dope-in' clouds Pell Grant policy
## 
### Alex Hoye 
A protest on the steps of a dorm
at UC-Berkeley Friday has left
more than a cloud of smoke be
hind at college campuses.
At the demonstration, about 50
Berkeley students lit up 500 ma
rijuana joints and passed them
around as a crowd of 2,000 gath
ered to watch.
The 50 students are calling
themselves DOPE, Defend Our
Personal Ethics, and they came
out to protest a new finanical aid
stipulation proposed by President
Bush in his "War on Drugs."
Bush's new requirement affects
students who receive Pell Grants,
aid awarded to low-income higher
education students.
Under the plan, Pell Grant
recipients must sign a release
stating that they will not use or
make illegal drugs.
DOPE'S smokey tactics did not
seem to uspet very many of the
onlookers, said Steve Markowitz,

editor of the Daily Cal student
newspaper.
According to Markowitz, only
three students in the large crowd
actively opposed DOPE's actions.
Although there were no arrests,
the Berkeley police videotaped the
event, Berkeley public informa
tion officer Ray Colvig said.
Colvig said police reviewed the
tapes yesterday afternoon and
probably would not make any ar
rests because they have no
physical evidence of wrongdoing.
Berkeley did not authorize the
smoke-in, Colvig said, adding that
the school is still "not certain"
whether Bush's requirement will
prove effective at Berkeley.
Pell Grants, named for Sen.
Claiborne Pell (D-R.1.), who es
tablished the federal aid program,
are funds awarded to about three
million students nationwide an
nually.
Colvig said Bush's new policy
raises questions about enfor
ceability for Berkeley administra

tors. The policy singles out
Grant recipients but not recipients
of other forms of federal aid »-
and all Berkeley students receive
some federal funds, he said. >'
While Stanford is a private ift
sitution and not all students here
receive federal aid, several stu
dents are Pell recepients. ! •
Eyi Aono, a Stanford Pell Grant
recipient, said the policy unfairly
discriminates against those who
need finanical aid. .■»*.
"The more wealthy people
aren't put on the spot, but the
poor people that need this money
are," he said.
Markowitz said that the future
of DOPE activities at Berkeley re
mains in a haze.
However, he predicted that
groups other than DOPE will
most likely hold smoke-ins later
this month. He said a group that
hopes to promote the legalization
of marijuana for religious pur
poses told him they would stage
smoke-ins at UCLA and Berkeley.
