# Danish visitors to analyze businesses
## 
### Elisabeth Loeb 
Fifteen Danish students got
their first look at American
capitalism yesterday and will
spend the next month at Stanford
analyzing and comparing Danish
and American business environ
ments.
The Danish students, who are
from the Copenhagen School of
Business, arrived on campus yes
terday. They are taking part in a
monthlong program called the
Scandinavian Consortium for Re
search Exchange.
By the same token, Stanford
students at the Graduate School
of Business had a chance to study
the Danish economic system last
month with the exchange pro
gram.
The Stanford students studied
the regulatory environment, the
social environment and labor re
lations in a welfare state, said Bill

Hughson, one of the graduate stu
dents who traveled to Denmark
and took part in the exchange.
Hughson said that during his
time in Denmark, the students
researched three Danish compan
ies, including Privatbanken,
Radiometer and ISS Interna
tional.
Besides studying the economic
environment of Denmark, Hugh
son said the Stanford students
also embarked on an "intense"
study of the Danish culture, so
ciety, political system and Den
mark's neighbor relations.
The American students also
spent time at Norsk Hydro in
Oslo, Norway and at Volvo in
Goteberg, Sweden.
The Danish students will follow
a program similar to what the
Stanford students experienced, ac
cording to Hughson. The students
will analyze American corpora
tions including Sun Micro Sys

tems, Ray Chem and Citicorp
Savings.
The students participating in
the exchange — from both coun
tries — have undertaken their
own business venture to raise
funds for the exchange.
With the go-ahead from the
Business School, the students
formed a finance committee and
have raised money to cover some
of the costs of their expedition,
Hughson said.
Some of the companies provid
ing funds for the exchange are
Lucky Stores, Monitor Company,
Pacific Bell, Citicorp Savings and
Eastman-Kodak.
"All the students involved con
tributed much hard work in order
to organize the program," Hugh
son said.
Although this was the first year
of the exchange, Hughson said the
program "has definite potential to
be repeated next year."
