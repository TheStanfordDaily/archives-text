## Colombia fires police officers for drug traffic links 
### 
BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) —
The national police said yesterday
they had fired 2,075 officers,
many for having links to drug
traffickers, and the government
urged Colombians to rally behind
its 7-week-old war on cocaine car
tels.
. The appeal by President Virgilio
Barco's government was issued
Tuesday after the Supreme Court
approved an emergency decree
that allows those accused of traf
ficking by the United States to
be extradited.
' Reman Catholic bishops issued

a statement calling the murder of
a Bishop Jesus Emilio Jaramillo,
reportedly kidnapped by leftist
guemllas, "vile, sacrilegious and
pitiless." His death apparently
was not connected to the drug
war.
Gen. Miguel Gomez Padilla, the
national police chief, began an
anti-corruption drive in the
80,000-man force in February,
soon after taking over from a gen
eral who was forced out because
of connections with drug traffick
ers.
El Tiempo, a Bogota newspaper,

said in a story published yester
day that 2,075 policemen had been
dismissed or forced to resign for
taking bribes from traffickers.
It said hundreds of others had
quit because of low pay or other
complaints. Starting policemen
receive about $150 a month.
Col. Alfredo Salgado of the na
tional police told The Associated
Press the story was accurate.
The paper quoted Gomez, the
police chief, as saying infiltration
by drug rings made the dismissals
necessary. El Tiempo said the gen
eral noted "the drug traffickers'

great capacity to bribe at all levels
of national life."
In its appeal, the State Security
Council — President Barco, five
Cabinet ministers and the attor
ney general — urged Colombians
to resist pressure from the traf
fickers. It cited bombings, assas
sinations and other terrorist acts
intended to turn people against
the government.
The statement said traffickers
were trying to create the impres
sion that the government, by
refusing to negotiate with them,
was indirectly responsible for the

violence.
Although there has been no
public demand for negotiations
with the drug rings, the subject
has become a daily topic of dis
cussion and many Colombians
support such talks.
Barco and the others said they
would not yield to threats and
terrorism and repeated previous
vows not to negotiate with the
cartels.
Reports said the government
was preparing to extradite an
other drug figure.
Caracol, a national radio chain,

said authorities had completed the
paperwork on Ana Rodriguez de
Tamayo, wanted by a federal court
in Miami on charges of conspiracy
and drug trafficking. It said she
could be extradited at any time.
Army Col. Fernando Gonzalez
said in an interview broadcast
Tuesday that Bishop Jaramillo
was kidnapped Monday in north
eastern Colombia by the National
Liberation Army.
He said the guerrillas appar
ently wanted to use the bishop to
carry a message to the govern
ment.
