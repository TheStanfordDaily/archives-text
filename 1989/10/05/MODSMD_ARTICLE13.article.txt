PERTH-ANDOVER, New
Brunswick (AP) — A U.S. Air
Force tanker jet exploded in the
air yesterday over Canada, killing
at least three of four crew mem
bers, authorities said.
A panel of military and civilian
officials was being assembled in
an attempt to determine what
caused the four-engine jet to blow
up and crash, setting fire to woods
near this border town, Air Force
qfficials said.
The KC-135A tanker was re
turning from a refueling mission
tp Loring Air Force Base in Lime
stone, Maine, less than 20 miles
from the crash site.
, "Three bodies have been recov
ered, but not the fourth," said
Capt. Kellie Rebscher, a spokes
woman at I^oring.
Rebscher confirmed that the
plane exploded in the air and that
it was not equipped with a "black
bdfc" that could have recorded
crew members' final words. She
said the crew was in radio contact
with the Loring control tower "a
few minutes before the explosion
and they never indicated anything
was wrong."
Efforts to locate the missing
man continued many hours after
thg predawn explosion, which wit
nesses said looked like fireworks
anil felt like an earthquake.
P€j>ple living nearby said they

heard saw a flash of light, then
Bmelled burning rubber and diesel
fumes.
"The noise! My whole house
shook — windows and every
thing," said Anita Davenport, a
nearby resident.
Chunks of twisted metal and
other crash debris were scattered
over a wide area, said those who
reached the scene before the Air
Force seal it off. The tail of the
jet was fairly intact, coming to
rest about a half-mile from the
fuselage, which landed in a ravine.
Cold winds dusted the wreckage
with a light snow.
The plane was returning from
a refueling mission when it went
down at around 6 a.m. in a heavily
wooded valley north of this com
munity of about 1,900 people, just
across the border from Fort Fair
field, Maine, the Air Force said.
The jet, which Rebscher said
was 25 years old, is a Boeing 707
reconfigured as a tanker for re
fueling fighters and bombers
based at Loring. An aircraft
needing fuel moves in behind the
tanker plane and nuzzles a fuel
receiving arm into a long boom
protruding from a KC-135.
Rebscher said she was uncer
tain whether the Loring plane had
unloaded its refueling tanks prior
to the explosion. She also said she
did not know the altitude at which

the explosion occurred.
The victims' identities were

tion of relatives.
Yesterday's explosion was the
third crash involving a KC-135
this year.
On Sept. 20, an Alaska National
Guard KC-135 exploded and
burned while taxiing to park at
Eielson Air Force Base, killing two
people. On Jan. 31, all 19 people
aboard a KC-135 died when it
crashed on takeoff from Dyess Air
Force Base in Texas. A KC-135
crash in 1988 killed six crewmen
at Wurtsmith Air Force Base in
Michigan.
