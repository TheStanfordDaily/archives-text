tßush supports peace
*
: WASHINGTON (AP) -
tPresident Bush yesterday
purged Zaire's President Mobutu
*Sese Seko to settle his differ
tenceg with Angolan rebel leader
Monas Savimbi amid reports
*that Mobutu has disrupted the
•flow of U.S. arms to Savimbi's
♦guerrillas.
• Mobutu was summoned to
•the White House from New
♦York to discuss the deteriora
tion in his relations with
•Savimbi and the faltering June
cease-fire which Zaire mediated
between the rebels and An
. gola's Soviet-backed govern
ment, who have been fighting
for 14 years.
Mobutu, Savimbi and An
gola's foreign minister, Pedro
van Dunem, were all in Wash
ington on yesterday, but none
of them met.
Mobutu returned to New
York where he addressed the
U.N. General Assembly on
Wednesday afternoon. During
Mobutu's speech at the United
Nations, U.N. guards hustled
six people out of the visitors'
gallery after they shouted
"Murderer" at him.
Aid for Poland
WASHINGTON (AP) - The
Bush administration, under
heavy pressure from Congress
to do more for the new gov
ernment of Poland, yesterday
proposed a $200 million grant
to help that country restruc
ture its economy.
The aid, which would require
congressional approval, would
be in addition to $219 million
in economic and food aid pre

viously announced by the ad
ministration.
The proposal came as House
and Senate Democrats pro
posed even larger sums of aid
to the new Solidarity-led gov
ernment than sought by Bush
— and invited the labor union's
leader, Lech Walesa, to address
a joint meeting of Congress on
Nov. 15 to outline his hopes
for Poland's future.
Democratic leaders of both
chambers joined Tuesday to
dismiss again Bush's $219 mil
lion package of initiatives in
Eastern Europe as "grossly in
adequate" and "timid."
They unveiled an aggressive
Democratic legislative program
of grants and loans with a po
tential economic impact of
more than $3.7 billion.
Record cocaine bust
WASHINGTON (AP) - The
Coast Guard seized a ship car
rying more than 11,000 pounds
of cocaine and is escorting the
vessel to New Orleans, a Coast
Guard official said yesterday.
He called it the "largest
maritime cocaine seizure in
history."
The ship was seized in the
Gulf of Mexico several days ago
and the Coast Guard has been
escorting it to New Orleans
since then, said Coast Guard
Lt. Cmdr. Jim Simpson.
"A Coast Guard cutter found
them in the gulf, boarded them
and found the dope," Simpson
said, adding that he didn't
know the details of why the
cutter's crew decided to board
the vessel, what kind of ship
it is or what country's flag it
flies.
