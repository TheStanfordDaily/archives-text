# Democrats postpone flag-burning bill action

WASHINGTON (AP) - Senate
Democrats put the brakes on a
bill to ban flag desecration late
last night, saying a pair of
Republican-sponsored changes in
the wording would leave it vul
nerable to a Supreme Court chal
lenge.
"The one thing we are required
to avoid doing, or giving the court
an excuse to suggest we are doing,
is to proscribe any communicative
ideas ... any speech," Sen. Joseph
Biden, D-Del., said as the Senate
postponed action.
He said, however, that the court
might well interpret the proposed
changes as an effort to limit free
dom of speech.
Sponsors had expected to pass
the bill yesterday afternoon but
instead ended up hoping to win
approval on Thursday.
The bill is a response to the
uproar that followed a decision by
the Supreme Court that over
turned a Texas flag-burning ban
last June.
Lawmakers also acknowledged
that the bill represents a move to
head off a proposed constitutional
amendment against flag-burning,
set to come before the Senate in
mid-October.
A number of senators, mainly
Democrats, say amending the

Constitution is not the proper way
to deal with the issue, but many
other lawmakers say it is the only
way to get around the court de
cision.
President Bush has called for a
constitutional amendment against
flag burning, as have many con
gressional conservatives.
At issue were only three words
that Republicans sought to add
to the House-passed legislation.
One amendment offered by Mi
nority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan.,
would make it clear that flag
desecration was banned only if it
occurred "publicly."
The other, sponsored by Sen.
Pete Wilson, R-Calif., would make
it illegal to "physically defile" the
flag.
The Supreme Court in the
Texas case ruled in effect that
flag-burner Gregory Lee Johnson
was convicted not for setting a
flag afire but because he was en
gaging in political protest. It said
that limited his freedom of speech
and overturned the law on that
ground.
Bill sponsors want the measure
to avoid that problem by banning
any flag desecration, regardless of
whether it involves political
protest.
Debate over exactly what the

'Of all things, today in the United States of
America we need to encourage our people to
be less afraid, speaking what they believe,
letting their minds and hearts give rise to
what they truly think ought to be done.'
— Sen. Bob Kerrey D — Nebraska

Republican amendments would do
meandered into semantic thickets
unusual even for the Senate floor.
Biden said drily it was too bad
former Sen. S.I. Hayakawa, R-
Calif., a noted authority on
semantics as well as a politician,
was not still around to help out
with the debate.
The bill differs only slightly
from an existing federal law
against flag burning.
Current law bans any action
that "knowingly casts contempt
upon any flag of the United States
by publicly mutilating, defacing,
defiling, burning or trampling
upon it." It provides for penalties
of up to a $1,000 fine and a year
in jail. The Texas law had a
similar wording.
"The statutory approach in my
opinion is a futile and ineffective

gesture which will not pass the
constitutional test at all," Hatch
said.
Some critics said that there is
no wide outbreak of flag burning
in the United States and that the
bill would encroach on freedom of
speech as a means of fighting a
danger that does not exist.
"It's not needed for the main
tenance of demc~-°,£ic freedom,"
Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb. said.
"Of all things, today in the
United States of America we need
to encourage our people to be less
afraid, speaking what they be
lieve, letting their minds and
hearts give rise to what they truly
think ought to be done," Kerrey
told the Senate.
The flag represents the very
heart of what it means to be an
American.
