# House votes to aid Nicaraguan opposition at polls
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - The
House voted last night to spend
an additional $9 million openly to
help the opposition in next year's
Nicaraguan elections after the
Bush administration promised
not to use the CIA to influence
the outcome.
The House action, on a vote of
263-156, sent the measure to the
Senate, where it could come up
this week.

Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista
government and its incumbent
president, Daniel Ortega, "have all
the resources of the state at their
disposal," said Rep. Mickey Ed
wards, R-Okla.
The coalition opposing the San
dinistas operates out of a shabby
office with almost no equipment
and doesn't even have a fully
working telephone, proponents of
the aid package argued.

Opponents of the aid argued
that it is wrong for the United
States to intervene in foreign elec
tions, and that doing so will only
further the U.S. image of heavy
handed interference.
"I fear the infusion of such a
large amount of money will in
fact act to cripple the very people
we're trying to help," said Rep.
David Obey, D-Wis.
Agreement was made possible

after Secretary of State James A.
Baker 111 and other senior offi
cials conveyed private assurances
to Congress that if the aid goes
forward, the administration will
not use CIA contingency funds to
support the opposition in secret.
Of the total package, $8 million
would flow through the National
Endowment for Democracy, a
government-supported organiza
tion which promotes free election*.
