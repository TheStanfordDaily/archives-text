## Safe waste disposal 
### 
Response to disposal
violations may mark
new safety commitment

THIS TIME, they did the
right thing.
Officials at Stanford Uni
versity Hospital, under fire for a
serious health violation, reacted
quickly and installed new controls
that may bring an end to a recur
ring problem.
The Santa Clara County district
attorney filed charges against the
hospital last week for disposing of
potentially infectious hypodermic
needles at the Palo Alto landfill.
Landfill employees found dozens
of needles spilled from a container
incorrectly mixed with regular gar
bage. As a result, the University
will be fined between $100 and
$1,000 for violating a code requir
ing disposal methods to make in
fectious waste "reasonably safe"
from accidental human contact.
Hospital officials have not deter
mined how the potentially infec
tious needles became mixed with
nonhazardous waste, but they have
narrowed the list of possible of
fenders to a few Medical Center
clinics.
Employees at the hospital are
required to separate infectious
waste from non-infectious waste
and burn the infectious waste at
the University's Environmental
Safety Facility. In this case, they
slipped.
It wasn't the first time. In recent
years the hospital has been cited
on several occasions for waste dis
posal violations.
In at least one incident, bags of
infectious waste were found at the
landfill when they should have
been incinerated. There have also
been false alarms in which non
infectious waste was placed in the

infectious waste bags — and the
bags made it all the way to the
dump.
Furthermore, in an investigation
last spring, The Daily found
several waste handling violations
in the Medical Center. Open red
bags with potentially infectious
waste inside were stored in an or
dinary garbage can, and in several
instances non-infectious garbage
was mixed in the bags specified
for infectious waste.
These violations did not indicate
any significant health risk in and
of themselves, but they demonstra
ted that enforcement of waste dis
posal policies was lax at best.
Hospital officials said last week's
incident was the first involving
syringes and added that employees
have often prevented infectious
waste from going to the landfill.
But instead of letting the issue
rest with such rationalizations, of
ficials took concrete steps to rem
edy the problem.
The hospital acted quickly last
week to institute several changes
in its waste disposal system.
Among these changes were setting
up a screening system of all trash
going into the Hospital's compac
tor, ensuring that all non
infectious waste material is ex
amined before it leaves nursing
units and training all housekeeping
staff on proper handling of infec
tious waste.
Hospital officials deserve ap
plause for reacting so swiftly. If
the changes are as effective as they
have the potential to be, infectious
waste may not continue popping
up in all the wrong places.
It is hoped that the hospital's
reaction represents a renewed,
long-term commitment to safe han
dling of unsafe materials — and
not simply a band-aid solution to
be removed when the media atten
tion disappears.
