# Coalition throws energy behind Jackson
## 
### John Wagner Editorial staff 
With yesterday's sentencing of most protesters
arrested in the Building 10 takeover behind them,
members of the Agenda for Action coalition are
now focusing all their energy on supporting Louis
Jackson, who they believe has been unfairly sin
gled out by the district attorney.
Jackson still faces six misdemeanor charges
stemming from the May 15 takeover of University
President Donald Kennedy's office. The charges
— including incitement to riot and battery —
carry a maximum penalty of two years in jail.
But coalition members feel Jackson's role in
the protest was no different than those who were
sentenced yesterday on the charge of trespassing.
In addition to statements made on Jackson's
behalf at a press conference yesterday, the student
of color groups on campus and the ASSU's Com

mittee on Democracy in Education are organizing
to gather campuswide and statewide support for
Jackson.
Members of the coalition made appearances at
dorm meetings across campus last night seeking
support for a petition drive to support Jackson
and fundraising efforts to help pay Jackson's
legal fees. The coalition is also planning to recruit
supporters at a table in White Plaza, to write
messages of support in chalk across campus and
to raise money to pay for a full-page ad in The
Daily.
On the state level, the student of color groups
are tapping into statewide minority student net
works to gain solidarity for Jackson's cause.
In court, coalition member Cheryl Taylor read
a group statement before Judge Stephen Manley,
voicing concern about the unequal treatment of
Jackson.
"[Jackson's] participation in the
demonstration was not unique
and was no more formative or
violent than the actions of any of
the other members," Taylor said.
"We believe that for justice to be
served, Louis Jackson should be
treated as an equal member of a
group effort."
Following yesterday's sentenc
ing, the coalition held a press con
ference on the steps of the Palo
Alto Municipal Court.
Speaking on behalf of the black
students arrested in the takeover,
Lyzette Settle questioned the mo
tives for additional charges
against Jackson. "It is clear that
Louis Jackson is being singled
out," siie said. "Throughout the
day there were some 15 to 20
people who said, in essence, the
same thing that Louis Jackson

said that day. These people are
just as identifiable as Louis Jack
son, yet Louis Jackson, a black
male, is the only one charged with
inciting to riot."
The Stanford police report that
implicates Jackson for inciting the
crowd says that other protesters
were inciting the crowd as well.
Jackson, however, is the only
protester named in the report for
doing so, and, according to Asst.
District Attorney Thomas Fahren
holz, therefore the only protester
being charged with incitement to
riot.
Jackson'B distinction by the dis
trict attorney has led the BSU
and Keith Archuleta, director of
the Black Community Services
Center, to believe that racism was
behind the arrest of Jackson, who
is black.
Yesterday, Settle raised doubts
about the University's commit
ment to pluralism. "How can
Stanford truly stand for diversity,
pluralism and acceptance if it al
lows the urgust singling out of a

member of the Stanford commu
nity?" she said. "Stanford Univer
sity should strive to hold their
employees, the Stanford police, ac
countable and not allow the police
to ur\justly punish individuals
who stand up for the values that
Stanford claims to uphold."
Speaking on behalf of the
Asian-American students involved
in the takeover, Marli Higa
praised Jackson's dedication to
multiculturalism and called the
prosecution of Jackson U just one
example of the rising number of
attacks against people of color."
"[Jackson] comes from a tradi
tion of people such as Martin Lu
ther King, Jr.," Higa said. "His
prosecution is an attack on the
efforts of people to work for pro
gressive change. We rally behind
him in recognition of the common
history of struggle we share as a
people of color."
Statements of support were also
read at the coalition's press con
ference by Council of Presidents

member Ingrid Nava, CODE
member Sophia Sorensen,
MEChA co-chair Anna Mata, and
Matthew Wambua, a member of
a black student organization at
UC-Berkeley.
