						kinder, gentler 'Fire' 
### 
ON SEPT. 25, the students of color
organizations and the ASSU
Council of Presidents presented
Stanford's frosh and new students with
the second edition of "The Fire Within,"
a program designed to introduce Stan
ford's ethnic minority communities.
While the purpose of the program re
mained the same as last year, the ap
proach differed radically.
Last year's pain, anger and frustration
had seemingly been replaced by a lighter,
more celebratory message of ethnic di
versity here at Stanford. Humor, music
and dancing supplanted last year's fiery
speeches attacking racism and prejudice.
While it is true that there was a con
sistent message that racism is alive, well
and still intolerable in the 19905, I
couldn't help but see that strong and
powerful message fade from the limelight
it had a year ago.
As one of my friends put it,"It was
double sugar coated."
In a way, though, it worked. Seemingly,
most of the audience enjoyed the pro
gram. People left the auditorium smiling,
remembering the jokes, the dances and
the lively music. Even those of us who
have devoted so much time and energy
to improving the conditions for ethnic
minorities were refreshed by the beauty
of our many different cultures.
It felt good to put away our hurt and
pain, our anger and frustration. That
night, we all became the Model Minority,
laughing, dancing and smiling, making
everyone else happy.
It seemed fine until someone told me
that they were glad that the program

had been more celebratory; he didn't
want to deal with the long, heated dis
cussions that had followed last year's pre
sentation. Something didn't seem right.
Is that really what we want? Should
we be happy to simply avoid the conflict?
At Stanford, it's easy, sometimes too
easy, to sidestep the controversy. All too
often, we put on the blinders and take
the safe, well-beaten path. Don't get in
volved, don't make noise, don't rock the
boat.
For a lot of us students from Wester
nized, middle-class, suburban back
grounds, this makes a whole world of
sense. Why not just mind our own busi
ness and stick to our grades, and our
jobs, and our power resumes.
Just be happy and don't worry about
that other stuff. Someone else will take
care of it.
The problem, however, is that when
we pull our heads from the sand, we're
still faced with the same realities that
were there before. We still live in that
world filled with Vincent Chins, Virginia
Beaches and abnormally high dropout
rates for minorities in grades K-12.
We still face an uneducated society that
believes the only worthwhile culture
came from Western Europe. We still have
thousands of aging Japanese-Americans
that have yet to see a president keep his
promise that justice would be served for
their unfounded internment.
"The Fire Within" might have been
lighter and more inviting, but for a good
reason. No one, especially frosh in their
first week at Stanford, wants to be lecu
tured on how bad and how unfair the

world is.
This year's "The Fire Within" helped
Stanford's new students to see that it's
not always pain and strife, blood and
tears. There's a sense of humor and beau
ty, too.
What should be remembered, though,
is that at the center of the double sugfcr
coating is a world of problems and con
flicts for minorities that we may not want
to acknowledge, much less address. But,
ignoring or glossing over the issues will
never make them go away.
