## Indirect costs are plaguing all academic programs 
### 
THE headline story in Monday's
Daily, "Overhead costs threaten
ing Stanford's competitive re
search edge," misses the point. The
headline is quite correct — overhead
costs are seriously damaging our re
search programs.
But focusing on the research pro
grams only hides the fundamental
problem: uncontrolled indirect costs in
all areas of the University, and the
failure to explicitly recognize these
costs, are damaging all the academic
programs in all areas of the University.
Overhead costs aren't associated just
with research, and they don't primarily
"offset the costs of maintaining re
search facilities."
They represent (mostly) the real
though indirect costs of doing business,
providing facilities and space and
administrative support for any kind of
academic program in any area of the
university. And, they are just about as
large, and as out of control, for every

kind of academic activity in every area
of the university.
The indirect costs of providing space,
facilities, heat and light, record
keeping, payroll, personnel services,
roads, policing and so on are just
about the same for a faculty member
or grad student or secretary in the
Electrical Engineering or the English
Departments: an additional cost of 70
percent to 90 percent of each individ
ual's direct salary, if you use direct
cost as a base.
Maintaining an employee with a
$25,000 salary at Stanford really costs
close to $50,000 in real money — in
"loaded dollars," as they say — no
matter where the employee works.
If the visible overhead rate on spon
sored research is currently 74 percent
and rising, then the hidden overhead
rate on teaching and all other aca
demic activities is at least as large and
rising at least as rapidly. But only the
indirect costs of sponsored research are

explicitly made visible and collected as
an immediate "overhead" or tax.
This makes overhead-paying re
searchers very aware of indirect costs
and the policy decisions that drive
them.
The entirely comparable indirect
costs of all other university activities
are hidden from the people performing
those activities and paid by the univer
sity as an unrecognized subsidy, which
makes all those people largely unaware
of the burden of indirect costs and
unconcerned with keeping them as low
as possible.
About five percent of Stanford's
faculty members are responsible for
about two-thirds of the collected over
head; about two-thirds of Stanford's
faculty have no contact with overhead
at all.
Stanford's continuing financial prob
lems are likely to improve only when
we are all forced to look at every
activity taking place and costing money

on campus, and to make an explicit
decision whether that activity is one of
the direct objectives of the University
— one of the things the University
exists to do — or whether it is part of
the indirect costs which (should) exist
only to support the direct objectives.
All our direct objectives should then
be budgeted and funded, and priority
decisions made, in comparably honest
"loaded" dollars; and all these direct
activities should have to pay an ex
plicit, visible overhead of similar mag
nitude.
All the indirect activities will then
have to be supported by these explicit
overhead taxes, which will focus our
minds remarkably on which of these
indirect expenses we really want or
need. We're all paying for them now,
of course, in a hidden sort of way; it's
just that too many of us don't realize
we're doing it.
