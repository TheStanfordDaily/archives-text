# Louis Jackson should accept consequences of breaking the law
## 
### 
After reading about the plight of
protester and activist Louis Jackson of
the Black Student Union in last Thurs
day's Daily, I can't help but become
angry and disgusted by the wanton
and careless use of the word "racism"
by the BSU and its supporters.
After reading the article twice, it
seems to me that Jackson's accusation
of racism on the part of the Santa
Clara County district attorney's office
rests on the fact that he was the only
person singled out to be charged with
the intent to incite a riot.

I once had a college professor who
related an incident that he had in
court many years ago. Having been
ticketed for speeding at 65 miles per
hour, this professor of mine thought
that he would contest the ticket in
court since he felt that he had been
unfairly singled out to be ticketed
among many other speeding drivers.
The presiding judge asked him one
simple question: "Were you driving
faster than 55 miles per hour?" If so,
you are guilty. End of case.
Like the judge in the previous case,
I fail to see the relevance of other's
guilt or innocence in the case of Jack
son. Racism shows its ugly head in
many ways, but I am glad that I don't
see any of it in Jackson's case.
< What I do see is someone who acted
without understanding the conse-

quences of his actions. Jackson in
structed other protesters to block the
bus, was videotaped by Stanford police
officer Keith Viveiros outside of Build
ing 10 "inciting the crowd," and was
clearly one — if not the most impor
tant — leader during the May 15
takeover of University President
Donald Kennedy's office.
And finally, the most disturbing part
of the whole affair is that Jackson
essentially admits his own guilt by
saying that he could deal with being
charged with the same misdemeanor(s)
as other protesters. Jackson seems to
want to be the "big fish" but not ac
cept the punishment commensurate
with the position.
Before anyone labels me a racist, I
want to ada a few words about myself.
Being an Asian-American and having

immigrated to this country from
Burma, one of the poorest nations in
the world, I am very much aware of
all forms of racism and the plight of
minorities in this country.
However, I am also very much aware
of the potential for polarization, resent
ment from the white community, and
alienation of white moderates when
charges of racism are thrown around
carelessly and without basis. It's easy
to use racism as a crutch, but some
times it's important to examine our
selves also.
Come on, Louis, learn to take re
sponsibility for your actions and stop
using charges of racism as a shield.
