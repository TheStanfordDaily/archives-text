## Coming single European Economic Community is great news 
### 
Europe is planning its greatest
change since World War 11. By
the end of 1992, 12 European
countries will create a single economic
market for the movement of goods,
people, services and capital. This
united Europe will become the third
major capitalistic power, along with the
United States and Japan.
The plan requires the approval of
over 300 legislative actions that will
eliminate barriers to trade. The coun
tries involved are the United Kingdom,
France, West Germany, Italy, Spain,
Portugal, Greece, Denmark, Belgium,
Netherlands, Luxembourg and Ireland.
The reason for the single market
plan is that West Europeans believe
that they are falling further behind the
U.S. and Japan in computers, telecom
munications, aerospace, energy and
biotechnology.
The "Europe 1992" plan has three
goals: (1) the elimination of physical
barriers between countries, including
each country's customs posts, (2) the
suspension of all value-added or excise
taxes on goods or services traded
among European countries, and (3) the
removal of regulations on goods and
services, on bids for goods and services
and on capital requirements for invest
ing across borders.

The impetus for European unity can
be traced far back in European history
to the common cultural heritage of the
continent founded on Greek and
Roman contributions. More recently,
Winston Churchill in 1946 encouraged
Europe to unite.
Under the Treaty of Rome in 1957,
the framework was created for the
European Community. In 1968, the
first step was taken toward a free
internal European market when inter
nal tariffs were eliminated. In 1987,
the Single European Act which out
lined the 1992 plan was ratified by
each national legislature.
The United States supports Europe's
growing economic strength. After World
War II when these countries were in
shambles, the U.S. was worried that
they would be attracted to communism
or socialism. U.S. aid to Greece and
Turkey, the Marshall Plan, the crea
tion of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization — were all successful
attempts to strengthen Europe.
The European market is extremely
important today. It is the largest eco
nomic bloc in the world, representing
29 percent of the world's $14.7 trillion
gross national product. That includes
the twelve European Community coun
tries plus Austria, Finland, Iceland,

Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, and
Turkey.
In terms of population, the Euro
pean Community has 325 million — 20
percent higher than the U.S. and twice
that of Japan. The European 12 com
prise the world's greatest trading area.
They have 20 percent of the world's
trade. They are the world's largest
exporter and importer, with over half
of their trade being within the Com
munity.
Overcoming initial skepticism, the
European people are now enthusiastic
about the 1992 plan because the
benefits of the single market will be
significant: a six percent increase in
gross domestic product, the creation of

two million new jobs, and a six percent
reduction in prices. In a nutshell,
Europeans are looking forward to an
even higher standard of living.
The single market will help to foster
larger-sized European industries which
will be better able to compete interna
tionally. A single market will make it
easier for companies to do business in
Europe, including those from the Pen
insula, as they will need only one base
in the area, not one in each of the 12
countries.
The difficult areas requiring resolu
tion for the plan are the rationaliza
tion of tax rates, especially the value
added taxes which vary widely between
states. Another problem is achieving

product standardization in industries
such as telephone, television, etc.
The integration plan will try to
license professional persons on an
area-wide basis — in the field of law,
medicine, dentists, teachers, architects,
etc. Behind much of the opposition to
change is the whole question of
sovereignty, the transfer of authority
from national governments to the
Economic Community.
Over the past several years, a huge
momentum has been built up toward
the single market concept because of
the publicity about the expected
benefits. The case in favor of the plan
rests on the argument that the people
will benefit more within a competitive
European-wide market than they will
within a collection of purely national
markets.
Current trends in Europe toward
privatization (the sale of formerly
nationalized industries), less govern
ment regulation, and now the single
economic market is great news, coming
as it does in tandem with the move
ment of the Soviet Union and China
away from centrally-directed economies.
