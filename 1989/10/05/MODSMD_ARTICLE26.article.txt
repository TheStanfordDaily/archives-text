## St. Mary's silences booters 1-0 Gaels shut down Stanford attack in critical game 
### Chris Crader Editorial staff 
MORAGA, Calif. — Being a national
power isn't always as fun as it seems.
You see, when you're one of the "haves"
of college soccer, you usually end up
scheduling all the other "haves" instead
of facing a bunch of "have-nots."
And a lot of the "haves" are pretty
good, as the Cardinal women's team will
attest.

After getting off to a 6-0 start this
year and rising to a No. 7 national
ranking, Stanford found a lot of the
aforementioned "haves" popping up on
the schedule. After a 1-0 loss to the
latest top-notch opponent, St. Mary's,
here yesterday, the Cardinal has fallen
to 6-3 and a No. 16 ranking.
The Gaels, ranked 12th in the latest
poll, scored seven minutes into the sec
ond half and then fought off all subse
quent Stanford attacks to make the goal
stand up. Stanford had previously lost
1-0 in overtime at No. 2 Colorado Col
lege and 4-3 at seventh-ranked Santa
Clara.
"We weren't fired up," fullback Blair
Elliott said. "We were there, and we
were out on the field, but we weren't
fired up to play."
In addition to the improvement of the
competition, and the plethora of road
games, the Stanford players also have
had to adjust to classes after going with
out them for nearly the first month of
the season.

'We weren't fired up. We
were there, and we were
out on the field, but we
weren't fired up to play.'

The Gaels also played a more relaxed
defense in the midfield than the Car
dinal has seen this year and it hurt
Stanford's ability to set up scoring op
portunities.
"They played really low-pressure de
fense, which we weren't used to,"
midfielder Jen Bloomer said. "Then
when we passed the ball to our forwards
they pounced on it. 1 think that threw
us out of rhythmn and we didn't adjust
to it."
The two teams played very evenly
throughout the first half, but right after
intermission the Gaels struck. Jill Ben
son was dribbling the wrong way along
the right sideline, then reversed the ball
quickly. She then hit a cross into the
middle of the field, where Kim Johnson
ran on to it. She had gotten past the
defense and kicked the ball past charg
ing Stanford goalkeeper Elise Edwards
for the game's sole goal.
Following the score, Stanford Coach
Berhane Andeberhan tried several com
binations of players in an effort to keep
fresh players up front. He even tried
three forwards (instead of the usual
two) for a while, but nothing worked
to get Stanford on the board.
The Cardinal did control most of the
action after the goal, but Stanford only
had one good chance. Midfielder Julie
Foudy hit a good lead pass to forward

Jennifer Rowland. Rowland then
crossed the ball in front of the g<>al,
and while the ball got past the Gael
goalkeeper, it was one step out of the
reach of freshman Anne Hoge's foot.
That was with about 10 minutes
remaining, and while Stanford kept the
ball in the St. Mary's end most of the
rest of the game, the team had nothing
to show for it.
"We never really got into it this
game," Bloomer said. "It'll be good to
play at home."
Fortunately, a home game is exactly
what is next in store for the team.

Card notes
Stanford was without the services of two
players for yesterday's contest. Freshmen
Kirby Seale and Katie Geib both made the
trip, but neither suited up thanks to the
generic cold-type thing that seems to be going
around campus.
For whatever reason, the Gaels chose to
play the match in their football stadium. It
was a lovely setting, with hills and trees
and open space all around, but it seemed a
little weird to be sitting in a college stadium
about the size of the one in which my high
school football team played.
The smattering of fans seemed to always
have something to say, but following in the
Ronald Reagan mold, what they said usually
neither made Bense nor was relevent. They
would complain to the referee at the wrong
times, and they made several comments that
were apperently supposed to be amusing (to
them) and insulting (to the Stanford players,
coaches and fans). Sadly, the aforementioned
comments showed their speakers to have
about the wit of a roll of lifesavers.
