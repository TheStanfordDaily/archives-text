# Football hurts, but watching from the sideline is painful
## 
### 
After encountering a near death expe
rience on my bike by the clock tower, I
was reminded of my most memorable
moment on a football field.
It was not a bone crushing sack or a
crucial fumble recovery from days of yore.
Unfortunately, my most memorable mo
ment came in the second quarter of last
year's San Diego State game when I in
jured my right knee.
Luckily, we were not on Monday Night
Football or in the Super Bowl so no
gruesome replay survives of my knee
touching the turf sideways. When the
guard from SDSU rolled into my leg, 1
felt a quick sharp pain followed by a
numbing sensation. You've probably ex
perienced something similar when you
stubbed your toe really hard on you bed
post. Dake Walden, one of our trainers,
straightened my leg out for me and asked
if I wanted to try to walk on it. I remem
bered that a high school coach once told
me, "If you can walk on it, you can play
on it." So I stood up and gave it a try.
My first step on the iryured leg was
solid and did not hurt too badly I thought

I must really be a baby for lying down
so long when I was able to walk off the
field. Then I took my second step and
felt my knee joint buckle and slide
sideways. I told Dake I didn't want to
walk on it anymore.
The worst part of getting hurt was
that my Mom and Dad were both at the
game. There is nothing worse in my fam
ily than making Mom and Dad worry,
and I knew that they were worried. When
I crutched out of the locker room with
my right leg in an immobilizer, they could

tell it was something serious.
My dad is an ex-professional football
player (Chicago Bears '54-'57), and he
injured his knee once. He knew what I
was going to go through, and his face
showed concern.
The following morning I met with Don
Bunce, one of our team doctors. The
diagnosis was that I had torn my anterior
cruciate ligament. I had two choices.
One, I could undergo arthroscopic sur
gery immediately to clean up any car
tilage damage and try to rehabilitate the
muscles surrounding the knee in order
to make up for the missing ligament. Or,
two, I could have the knee reconstructed,
taking a tendon graft from my kneecap
and screwing it into place as a ligament.
The first procedure, if successful, would
only have kept me out four to six weeks,
the second nine to twelve months. I chose
the first.
When I tried to come back and play
six weeks later, my knee collapsed on me
again, so I resorted to alternative two.
I decided to let Doctor Bunce do the
surgery. I figured that if his hands were

good enough to complete 24 of 44 passes
for 290 yards in Stanford's last Rose Bowl
appearance (1972), then they were good
enough to rebuild my knee.
I was prepared for the pain after the
surgery, but I wasn't ready for the in
convenience. I used to envy people who
had those little convalescent golf carts,
because they could scoff at the "no
motorized vehicles zone" and drive
straight into the Quad. But every bump
that jostled my new knee and every bol
lard that lowered its shoulder to knock
me off course, made me realize that it
is a mournful day when one is sentenced
to a golf cart.
I also wasn't ready for the mighty time
commitment that comes along with a
reconstructed knee. I spent five to seven
hours a day in the training room and
weight room treating and rehabilitating
my knee. Homework after such a day
became an after thought (at least I had
an excuse) and my social life consisted
of a lot of television.
There were many times when my
humble lineman's intellect waxed

philosophical and I asked myself why I
bothered. And, there were too many times
when no answer came. Then came spring.
While I stood on the sidelines and
watched our team go through spring prac
tice, I understood why I was putting in
the time. I was jealous of the guys who
were able to practice. The games from
the previous three seasons seemed more
precious than they had ever been. I
wanted another chance to run through
the band as "All Right Now" reverberated
in my helmet. I wanted to play.
I got my wish. After blowing out a
knee, many people never reach the field
again. Although my role on the team has
been limited to snapping on punts and
field goals, I savor each play.
I almost had another memorable mo
ment in the Oregon game. On a field
goal attempt in the second quarter, a
Duck fell on my good leg. It was only
sprained. I am proud to say that I have
another memorable moment: snapping on
the winning field goal. Now I just have
to keep avoiding those bikes.

only have kept me out four to six weeks,
the second nine to twelve months. I chose
the first.
When I tried to come back and play
six weeks later, my knee collapsed on me
again, so I resorted to alternative two.
I decided to let Doctor Bunce do the
surgery. I figured that if his hands were

good enough to complete 24 of 44 passes
for 290 yards in Stanford's last Rose Bowl
appearance (1972), then they were good
enough to rebuild my knee.
I was prepared for the pain after the
surgery, but I wasn't ready for the in
convenience. I used to envy people who
had those little convalescent golf carts,
because they could scoff at the "no
motorized vehicles zone" and drive
straight into the Quad. But every bump
that jostled my new knee and every bol
lard that lowered its shoulder to knock
me off course, made me realize that it
is a mournful day when one is sentenced
to a golf cart.
I also wasn't ready for the mighty time
commitment that comes along with a
reconstructed knee. I spent five to seven
hours a day in the training room and
weight room treating and rehabilitating
my knee. Homework after such a day
became an after thought (at least I had
an excuse) and my social life consisted
of a lot of television.
There were many times when my
humble lineman's intellect waxed

philosophical and I asked myself why I
bothered. And, there were too many times
when no answer came. Then came spring.
While I stood on the sidelines and
watched our team go through spring prac
tice, I understood why I was putting in
the time. I was jealous of the guys who
were able to practice. The games from
the previous three seasons seemed more
precious than they had ever been. I
wanted another chance to run through
the band as "All Right Now" reverberated
in my helmet. I wanted to play.
I got my wish. After blowing out a
knee, many people never reach the field
again. Although my role on the team has
been limited to snapping on punts and
field goals, I savor each play.
I almost had another memorable mo
ment in the Oregon game. On a field
goal attempt in the second quarter, a
Duck fell on my good leg. It was only
sprained. I am proud to say that I have
another memorable moment: snapping on
the winning field goal. Now I just have
to keep avoiding those bikes.

After encountering a near death expe
rience on my bike by the clock tower, I
was reminded of my most memorable
moment on a football field.
It was not a bone crushing sack or a
crucial fumble recovery from days of yore.
Unfortunately, my most memorable mo
ment came in the second quarter of last
year's San Diego State game when I in
jured my right knee.
Luckily, we were not on Monday Night
Football or in the Super Bowl so no
gruesome replay survives of my knee
touching the turf sideways. When the
guard from SDSU rolled into my leg, 1
felt a quick sharp pain followed by a
numbing sensation. You've probably ex
perienced something similar when you
stubbed your toe really hard on you bed
post. Dake Walden, one of our trainers,
straightened my leg out for me and asked
if I wanted to try to walk on it. I remem
bered that a high school coach once told
me, "If you can walk on it, you can play
on it." So I stood up and gave it a try.
My first step on the iryured leg was
solid and did not hurt too badly I thought

I must really be a baby for lying down
so long when I was able to walk off the
field. Then I took my second step and
felt my knee joint buckle and slide
sideways. I told Dake I didn't want to
walk on it anymore.
The worst part of getting hurt was
that my Mom and Dad were both at the
game. There is nothing worse in my fam
ily than making Mom and Dad worry,
and I knew that they were worried. When
I crutched out of the locker room with
my right leg in an immobilizer, they could

tell it was something serious.
My dad is an ex-professional football
player (Chicago Bears '54-'57), and he
injured his knee once. He knew what I
was going to go through, and his face
showed concern.
The following morning I met with Don
Bunce, one of our team doctors. The
diagnosis was that I had torn my anterior
cruciate ligament. I had two choices.
One, I could undergo arthroscopic sur
gery immediately to clean up any car
tilage damage and try to rehabilitate the
muscles surrounding the knee in order
to make up for the missing ligament. Or,
two, I could have the knee reconstructed,
taking a tendon graft from my kneecap
and screwing it into place as a ligament.
The first procedure, if successful, would
only have kept me out four to six weeks,
the second nine to twelve months. I chose
the first.
When I tried to come back and play
six weeks later, my knee collapsed on me
again, so I resorted to alternative two.
