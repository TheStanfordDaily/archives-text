OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) - Jose
Canseco missed the start of the
show, so Rickey Henderson stole
it.
Henderson sparked a two-run
rally in the fourth inning with
two stolen bases, and the Oakland
Athletics beat the Blue Jays 6-3
for a 2-0 lead in the best-of-7
American League playoffs.
"That's what I'm here for,"
Henderson said. "1 want to make
things happen."
That's just what he did.
Canseco, who is hitless in his
last 22 postseason at-bats, was in
the starting lineup but was
scratched when he had a migraine
headache before the game. He
pinch hit in the A's three-run
sixth inning and struck out. He
walked in the eighth.
"He didn't feel well before the
game, he was vomiting, Oakland
manager Tony Russa said.
Only two of 11 teams have
rallied from a 2-0 deficit to win
the AL playoffs â€” Milwaukee in
1982 and Kansas City over
Toronto in 1985.
So there is hope for the Blue
Jays.
"I hope we're careful, La Russa
said. "We're confident, but we
have to be careful."
The A's have won six straight
K layoff games, while the Blue Jays
ave dropped five in a row.
W I don't think they're in
timidated by me," Henderson
said. "I just think they're aware
that when I get on with a hit or
a walk I'm a threat.'
Once again, the A's put together
a combination of power, pitching
and speed to beat the Blue Jays.
Starter Mike Moore allowed
three hits in seven innings, Mark
McGwire had three hits and Dave
Parker hit his first home run in
25 postseason games spanning 93
at-bats.

"I've been on the mound when
Rickey was on the bases," Moore
said. "He can make you lose your
concentration."
Henderson had two singles and
two walks, and has been on base
seven times in nine plate appear
ances. He has six steals in the
series, breaking the playoff record
of five previously held by Davey
Lopes (1981) and Steve Sax
(1988), both with Los Angeles.
"Everyone has to worry about
Rickey," Toronto manager Cito
Gaston said. "Let him steal sec
ond, throw to third and maybe
we can get him there."
Henderson stole both second
and third in the fourth and
seventh innings.
"If I can get a good jump I go,"
said Henderson, who has 871
lifetime steals.
The A's are now 49-18 in day
games this season, while the Blue
Jays are 23-28.
The AL playoffs take a day off
before moving to Toronto for
Game 3 on Friday night. Storm
Davis (19-7) is scheduled to pitch
for the A's against Jimmy Key
(13-14).
The Blue Jays were 34-20 at
the Sky Dome, including winning
20 of their last 26 home games.
Toronto is 10-0 when the dome is
shut as it will be Friday night.
"I'm sure they will be confident
when they get home," La Russa
said. "We have a lot of respect for
this team."
Toronto starter Todd Stot

tlemyre, who was 7-3 in his last
15 starts, held the A's to two hits
and no runs on 26 pitches in the
first three innings.
The Blue Jays grabbed the lead
in the third inning on Fred
McGrifTs run-scoring grounder.
But just as he had done in Game
1, Henderson got the A's going
again.
Henderson walked leading off
the fourth, and stole second and
third.
The previous AL record for
steals in a series was four by
Kansas City's Amos Otis in 1978.
Carney Lansford, who hit .336
this season, followed with a single
to left over a drawn-in infield to
tie the score. Lansford moved to
second on Parker's grounder to
first, and scored on McGwire's
double down the left-field line.
Moore, who won a career-high
19 games, entered Game 2 with
a 4-12 lifetime record against
Toronto, having lost seven of
eight.
"I was a little nervous before
the game," Moore said. "1 was a
little concerned going into the
game."
Oakland was breezing along
when Rick Honeycutt relieved
Moore to start the eighth and
loaded the bases with none out
on a single by Nelson Liriano and
walks to Lloyd Moseby and
Mookie Wilson.
Dennis Eckersley relieved and
McGrifT singled to right to make
it 6-2. But Eckersley, who had 33
saves, got George Bell to hit into
a 4-6-3 double play as Moseby
scored the Jays' third run. Eck
ersley, who saved all four Oakland
playoff victories last season,
earned his first of the series.
The A's chased Stottlemyre in
the sixth when Parker led off with
a long home run to right field
and McGwire followed with a
single.
