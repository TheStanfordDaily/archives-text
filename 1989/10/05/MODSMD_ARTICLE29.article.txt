The magic of the fall clas
sic, the World Series, caught
the imagination of sports
fans way back when the
game moved from sand lot
to the grass diamond.
Even though much of
baseball has now moved to
artificial turf luxury-domes,
this year's baseball playoffs
offer a special opportunity
for baseball fans every
where, especially in the Bay
Area and at Stanford.
For the first time ever,
the San Francisco Giants
and the Oakland Athletics
have won their divisions in
the same year and have the
chance to face each other in
the World Series. Local fans
of the Pacific Sock Exchange
(Kevin Mitchell and Will
Clark) and the Bash Broth
ers (Jose Canseco and Mark
McGwire) are already
celebrating the anticipated
Bay Bridge, BART, or Al
catraz series, as it has been
tagged.
To build on the October
excitement, the Giants are
joined in the National
league by everybody's fa
vorite Cinderella story — the
Chicago Cubs. The Toronto
Blue Jays, a relatively new
entry to the mfyors, take on
Although tickets to the best-of
seven playoff and World Series
games are already sold-out to the
Oakland Coliseum and Candles
tick Park, campus interest has
been piqued by the meyor league
excitement.

"The Cubs are so happy just to
be in the playoffs, that I don't
think they'll beat the Giants,"
said junior Pat Broun, a diehard
Giants fan from Fremont. "The
Giants remember 1987 and
they're not going to blow it in the
playoffs."
"It's tough to be in the Giants'
shoes because everybody's rooting
for the Cubs," Broun continued.
"But I think the Giants will win
in six or seven."
"The Giants will beat the Cubs
in five games," predicted sopho
more Jeff Holzman as he watched
Giants slugger Will Clark launch
his first of two home runs in an
11-3 defeat of the Cubs yesterday.
"But I think the A's will beat
them in the World Series."
But not everyone at Stanford
is rooting for the A's or Giants,
and not everyone cares.
Explained Naperville, Illinois
native, Cub fanatic and Don Zim
mer imitator John May, "I haven't
said anything all year — I'm just
going to eryoy it."
It should be another October
classic.
