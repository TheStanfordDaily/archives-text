# Chair vacancy keeping this year's SCLC in starting blocks
## 
### Raoul Mowatt Staff writer 
The Student Conduct Legisla
tive Council grabbed the attention
of the Stanford community last
year by twice trying to reinterpret
the University's Fundamental
Standard and limit certain types
of expression.
But before this year's SCLC can
tackle the tough issues of how to
protect individuals from harass
ment and harmful speech, the
council must wait for the Univer
sity to select a faculty member to
chair the group.
Graduate School of Business
Prof. George Parker has stepped
down as chair of the committee
after his the expiration of his one
year term.
The University is considering
several candidates to replace
Parker but has no set time
schedule for the search, said Mar

lene Wine, a spokesperson for the
President's Office.
Until the position is filled, "We
don't know about what the SCLC
will be doing this year," she said.
The council consists of the
chair, six other faculty members
and five students who are elected
by the student body.
The six faculty members who
sat on the committee last year
are returning this year. The five
students who will serve still have
to meet final University approval,
according to Wine.
Although Ravi Bellur, Perry
Friedman, Constantino Pena, In
grid Nava and Edwin Sasaki have
been nominated by the ASSU as
representatives to the SCLC, their
nominations are pending the ap
pointment of a new faculty chair.
Although the SCLC failed to
create a final proposal that recon
ciled freedom of expression and
freedom from verbal harassment,

its accomplishments last year
were noteworthy, Parker said.
"Our discussions were very
fruitful," he said. "The process of
talking about these problems
elevates the campus, and that
process is in some ways an end
in and of itself."
Parker predicted that the free
speech debate will still spark "lots
of discussion" this year.
"But whether something hap
pens will depend on if momemen
tum can carry over from last
year," he added.
The committee first addressed
the issue in response to an inci
dent at Ujamaa House last Octo
ber when two freshmen defaced a
poster in a racially offensive man
ner.
Some members said the First
Amendment protected such ex
pression, while others claimed
that the action violated the Fun
damental Standard, the Universi
ty's 98-year-old code of ethics.
After the University's judicial
office determined that the fresh
men involved in the Ujamaa inci
dent were exempt from punish
ment under the Standard, minor
ity groups and other students
sought an amendment to the
Standard that would punish stu
dents for using offensive speech.
Although the SCLC has yet to
meet as a group this year, its
members are currently setting

goals for the committee as indi
viduals.
"If the changes that were made
last year (to the original proposal)
don't get passed, I don't know
where we go from there," Nava
said. Nava, an ex-officio member
of the council, is also a Council
of Presidents member.
One possibility is the creation
of a student-run discrimination
grievance board, Nava said. The
board, which is still in the plan
ning stages, would deal with in
cidents of racial and sexual har
assment on a case-by-case basis.
"Students want to have their
own body that would judge actions
like those," Nava said.
The SCLC will most likely con

other universities, many of which
are also debating how to protect
students from abusive language
while allowing the maximum
amount of free speech, said Sally
Cole, the University's Judicial Af
fairs Officer. Cole is also an ex
officio member of the SCLC.
The SCLC will also actively seek

input from minority groups here
on campus, said Bellur. He and
other student representatives hope
to attend meetings held by the
Black Student Union and MEChA,
a Chicano/Latino student organi
zation.
"The problem is people have
been talking above each other and
not to each other," Bellur said.
Once a new faculty chair is
found, the SCLC plans to hold an
orientation for the new student
members, Cole said.
"In one way or another, we'll
continue the agenda begun last
year of developing an interpreta
tion of the Fundamental Standard
in the area of discriminatory har
assment," Cole said.

council must wait for the Univer
sity to select a faculty member to
chair the group.

Prof. George Parker has stepped
down as chair of the committee
after his the expiration of his one
year term.
The University is considering
several candidates to replace
Parker but has no set time
schedule for the search, said Mar

lene Wine, a spokesperson for the
President's Office.
Until the position is filled, "We
don't know about what the SCLC
will be doing this year," she said.
The council consists of the
chair, six other faculty members
and five students who are elected
by the student body.
The six faculty members who
sat on the committee last year
are returning this year. The five
students who will serve still have
to meet final University approval,
according to Wine.
Although Ravi Bellur, Perry
Friedman, Constantino Pena, In
grid Nava and Edwin Sasaki have
been nominated by the ASSU as
representatives to the SCLC, their
nominations are pending the ap
pointment of a new faculty chair.
Although the SCLC failed to
create a final proposal that recon
ciled freedom of expression and
freedom from verbal harassment,

its accomplishments last year
were noteworthy, Parker said.
"Our discussions were very
fruitful," he said. "The process of
talking about these problems
elevates the campus, and that
process is in some ways an end
in and of itself."
Parker predicted that the free
speech debate will still spark "lots
of discussion" this year.
"But whether something hap
pens will depend on if momemen
tum can carry over from last
year," he added.
The committee first addressed
the issue in response to an inci
dent at Ujamaa House last Octo
ber when two freshmen defaced a
poster in a racially offensive man
ner.
Some members said the First
Amendment protected such ex
pression, while others claimed
that the action violated the Fun
damental Standard, the Universi
ty's 98-year-old code of ethics.
After the University's judicial
office determined that the fresh
men involved in the Ujamaa inci
dent were exempt from punish
ment under the Standard, minor
ity groups and other students
sought an amendment to the
Standard that would punish stu
dents for using offensive speech.
Although the SCLC has yet to
meet as a group this year, its
members are currently setting

goals for the committee as indi
viduals.
"If the changes that were made
last year (to the original proposal)
don't get passed, I don't know
where we go from there," Nava
said. Nava, an ex-officio member
of the council, is also a Council
of Presidents member.
One possibility is the creation
of a student-run discrimination
grievance board, Nava said. The
board, which is still in the plan
ning stages, would deal with in
cidents of racial and sexual har
assment on a case-by-case basis.
"Students want to have their
own body that would judge actions
like those," Nava said.
The SCLC will most likely con

sider events and policies affecting
other universities, many of which
are also debating how to protect
students from abusive language
while allowing the maximum
amount of free speech, said Sally
Cole, the University's Judicial Af
fairs Officer. Cole is also an ex
officio member of the SCLC.
The SCLC will also actively seek

input from minority groups here
on campus, said Bellur. He and
other student representatives hope
to attend meetings held by the
Black Student Union and MEChA,
a Chicano/Latino student organi
zation.
"The problem is people have
been talking above each other and
not to each other," Bellur said.
Once a new faculty chair is
found, the SCLC plans to hold an
orientation for the new student
members, Cole said.
"In one way or another, we'll
continue the agenda begun last
year of developing an interpreta
tion of the Fundamental Standard
in the area of discriminatory har
assment," Cole said.
