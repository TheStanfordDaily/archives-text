# Chair vacancy keeping this year's SCLC in starting blocks
##

The Student Conduct Legisla
tive Council grabbed the attention
of the Stanford community last
year by twice trying to reinterpret
the University's Fundamental
Standard and limit certain types
of expression.
But before this year's SCLC can
tackle the tough issues of how to
protect individuals from harass
ment and harmful speech, the
council must wait for the Univer
sity to select a faculty member to
chair the group.

Prof. George Parker has stepped
down as chair of the committee
after his the expiration of his one
year term.
The University is considering
several candidates to replace
Parker but has no set time
schedule for the search, said Mar

lene Wine, a spokesperson for the
President's Office.
Until the position is filled, "We
don't know about what the SCLC
will be doing this year," she said.
The council consists of the
chair, six other faculty members
and five students who are elected
by the student body.
The six faculty members who
sat on the committee last year
are returning this year. The five
students who will serve still have
to meet final University approval,
according to Wine.
Although Ravi Bellur, Perry
Friedman, Constantino Pena, In
grid Nava and Edwin Sasaki have
been nominated by the ASSU as
representatives to the SCLC, their
nominations are pending the ap
pointment of a new faculty chair.
Although the SCLC failed to
create a final proposal that recon
ciled freedom of expression and
freedom from verbal harassment,

its accomplishments last year
were noteworthy, Parker said.
"Our discussions were very
fruitful," he said. "The process of
talking about these problems
elevates the campus, and that
process is in some ways an end
in and of itself."
Parker predicted that the free
speech debate will still spark "lots
of discussion" this year.
"But whether something hap
pens will depend on if momemen
tum can carry over from last
year," he added.
The committee first addressed
the issue in response to an inci
dent at Ujamaa House last Octo
ber when two freshmen defaced a
poster in a racially offensive man
ner.
Some members said the First
Amendment protected such ex
pression, while others claimed
