# Giants batter Cubs
## 
### 
CHICAGO (AP) - Will Clark
spent all season in the shadow of
Kevin Mitchell. In the spotlight
at Wrigley Field on Wednesday
night, he finally moved ahead of
his teammate — barely.
Clark drove in a record six runs,
going 4-for-4 with two homers,
including a grand slam, and over
shadowed Mitchell's three-run
shot as San Francisco routed the
Chicago Cubs 11-3 in the opening
game of the National League
playoffs.
Pitching may dominate the
postseason, but not this time.
Clark's slam off 19-game winner
Greg Maddux landed on Sheffield
Avenue beyond the right-field
bleachers and made it 8-3 in the
fourth inning. By then there had
already been four home runs and
13 hits.
Clark set a playoff record for
RBIs and tied the all-time post
season record set by Bobby Rich
ardson for the New York Yankees
in the 1960 World Series. Clark
hit his only big-league grand slam
this season, against Mike Maddux,
Greg's brother.
Mitchell, who led the mtgors
with 47 home runs and 125 RBIs
this season, contributed his homer
and a single to the Giants' 13
hits. Clark, who batted .333 and
had 23 home runs and 111 RBIs,
walked ahead of Mitchell's home
run onto Waveland Avenue in left
field.
Scott Garrelts, the league's
earned run average champion,
struggled early yet lasted seven
innings for the victory.
Mark Grace hit a two-run
homer in the first inning for the
Cubs and Ryne Sandberg, who
had three hits, homered in the
third.
That was all the 39,195 fans —
not including those packing the
adjacent rooftops — had to cheer
about on a warmer-than-expected

AM)

night. There had been frost warn
ings the previous evening, but the
game-time temperature of 55
degrees and light winds even had
home-plate umpire Doug Harvey
in short sleeves.
Game 2 will be Thursday night
with Chicago's Mike Bielecki (18-
7) facing Rick Reuschel (17-8).
Clark, facing the team that has
given him the most trouble
throughout his career, hit an RBI
double during a three-run first
inning and a solo home run in
third. With the bases loaded and
two outs in the fourth. Cubs man
ager Don Zimmer went to the
mound to talk to Maddux and
Clark hit the next pitch out of
the park.
Clark, a .407 hitter with run
ners in scoring position this
season, tied the NL playoff mark
for hits. He hit .360 for the Giants
in the 1987 playoffs, a seven-game
loss to St. Louis.
Neither Clark nor Mitchell like
to hit at Wrigley Field or against
Chicago. Going into the gams,
Clark had hit just two home runs
in 141 career at-bats versus th®
Cubs — his lowest total against
any team — and had no homers
and just five RBIs in 48 tries this
season. Mitchell hit only .189
against Chicago this year.
That wasn't evident this tims.
Mitchell, the league leader in total
bases, and Clark, the runner-up,
went wild.
