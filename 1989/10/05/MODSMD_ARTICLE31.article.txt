# Racing legend dies at stud farm

### 
PARIS, Ky. (AP) — Secretariat,
whose 1973 Triple Crown triumph
stamped him as the "people's
horse," was humanely destroyed
on Wednesday. He was 19 — get
ting on for a horse but awfully
young for such a great guy.
"Maybe he was not the world's
greatest racehorse," his owner,
Helen Chenery, said, "but he was
a charismatic person. ...
"The dream is over."
Secretariat's 31-length victory
in the Belmont Stakes gave
America its first Triple Crown
winner in 25 years. In a year of
turmoil — including Watergate
and Vietnam — it also gave the
country a hero, and Americans
latched on as though he were
human.
"Secretariat was like the Arnold
Palmer or Sugar Ray Leonard of
horse racing," John Sosby, man
ager at Claiborne Farm, once said.
"He's a people's horse."
Gus Koch, assistant manager at
Claiborne, said Secretariat had an
incurable condition known as
Laminitis, an inflammation of the
inside of the hoof.
He was put down at 11:45 a.m.
EDT at Claiborne Farm in Paris,
where he stood at stud, said Koch.
"Of course, I'm terribly sorry
to lose an old friend," Chenery

'To me, he was always
No. 1, the greatest
horse anybody ever
saw. Everybody
thought he was going
to be great before he
ever started, and he
was.'

said. "As long as he was alive, his
memories had more immediacy."
Koch said Secretariat's condi
tion "rapidly worsened" on Tues
day, putting the chestnut stallion
in "extreme pain for the first
time." Secretariat was to be
buried at the farm Wednesday.
Koch said Walter Kaufman, res
ident veterinarian at the farm, put
the animal to sleep. The condition
was diagnosed on Labor Day,
Koch said.
"When the inflamation occurs,
swelling results," Koch said. "And
since there is little room for swell
ing, this is a very painful condi
tion."
Not only did Secretariat win the
Kentucky Derby and Belmont

Stakes in record time, but he
probably also would have set a
record in the Preakness if the
timing hadn't malfunctioned.
Secretariat won 16 of 21 races
in two years, but most fans re
member the Belmont best. Al
ready a winner in the Derby and
Preakness, Secretariat barreled
down the homestretch at Belmont
Park, and, amazingly, he was
alone. It was 31 lengths back to
Twice a Prince. Using the cus
tomary racing equivalent of one
fifth of a second per length,
Secretariat was under the wire
for 6 1-5 seconds before Twice a
Prince came along.
Not since Citation won the
Triple Crown in 1948 had any
horse managed to win all three
races, let alone in the style of
Secretariat.
Some still consider Man o' War
the greatest horse of all time. It's
the old Joe Louis-Muhammad Ali
argument.
"To me, he was always No. 1,
the greatest horse anybody ever
saw," said Lucien Lauren, who
trained Secretariat. "Everybody
thought he was going to be great
before he ever started, and he was.
"He gave me the biggest thrills
of my life. He was the greatest
of them all," said Lauren, now

training at Arlington Park in
Chicago.
But "Red," as the Claiborne
farmhands referred to the bur
nished chestnut, was something
of a disappointment in the breed
ing shed, even though he got 85
percent of his mares in foal and
managed to be No. 25 among
leading active sires.
A good sire, not a great one.
"Everybody still wants him to
duplicate himself, and I just don't
think that will happen," said John
Sosby, manager of Claiborne
Farm. "I hope he lives long
enough that we will see that."
But he didn't. The closest he
came was with his son, Risen Star,
who won the Preakness and Bel
mont Stakes in 1988 before retir
ing.
Risen Star wasn't much to look
at. His father was a matinee idol
in comparison. Spotting a camera,
he'd strike a regal pose. When
visitors dropped by his IU-acre
paddock, he charged down the hill,
snorting and bellowing.
"He loves it," Sosby said. "It's
'Look at me, I'm the king.' If he
could talk, he might be the type
to brag a little. He'd say, 'My kids
might not have beaten your kids,
but hey, look at me. I outran you,
and look at my records.'"

down the homestretch at Belmont
Park, and, amazingly, he was
alone. It was 31 lengths back to
Twice a Prince. Using the cus
tomary racing equivalent of one
fifth of a second per length,
Secretariat was under the wire
for 6 1-5 seconds before Twice a
Prince came along.
Not since Citation won the
Triple Crown in 1948 had any
horse managed to win all three
races, let alone in the style of
Secretariat.
Some still consider Man o' War
the greatest horse of all time. It's
the old Joe Louis-Muhammad Ali
argument.
"To me, he was always No. 1,
the greatest horse anybody ever
saw," said Lucien Lauren, who
trained Secretariat. "Everybody
thought he was going to be great
before he ever started, and he was.
"He gave me the biggest thrills
of my life. He was the greatest
of them all," said Lauren, now

training at Arlington Park in
Chicago.
But "Red," as the Claiborne
farmhands referred to the bur
nished chestnut, was something
of a disappointment in the breed
ing shed, even though he got 85
percent of his mares in foal and
managed to be No. 25 among
leading active sires.
A good sire, not a great one.
"Everybody still wants him to
duplicate himself, and I just don't
think that will happen," said John
Sosby, manager of Claiborne
Farm. "I hope he lives long
enough that we will see that."
But he didn't. The closest he
came was with his son, Risen Star,
who won the Preakness and Bel
mont Stakes in 1988 before retir
ing.
Risen Star wasn't much to look
at. His father was a matinee idol
in comparison. Spotting a camera,
he'd strike a regal pose. When
visitors dropped by his IU-acre
paddock, he charged down the hill,
snorting and bellowing.
"He loves it," Sosby said. "It's
'Look at me, I'm the king.' If he
could talk, he might be the type
to brag a little. He'd say, 'My kids
might not have beaten your kids,
but hey, look at me. I outran you,
and look at my records.'"
PARIS, Ky. (AP) — Secretariat,
whose 1973 Triple Crown triumph
stamped him as the "people's
horse," was humanely destroyed
on Wednesday. He was 19 — get
ting on for a horse but awfully
young for such a great guy.
"Maybe he was not the world's
greatest racehorse," his owner,
Helen Chenery, said, "but he was
a charismatic person. ...
"The dream is over."
Secretariat's 31-length victory
in the Belmont Stakes gave
America its first Triple Crown
winner in 25 years. In a year of
turmoil — including Watergate
and Vietnam — it also gave the
country a hero, and Americans
latched on as though he were
human.
"Secretariat was like the Arnold
Palmer or Sugar Ray Leonard of
horse racing," John Sosby, man
ager at Claiborne Farm, once said.
"He's a people's horse."
Gus Koch, assistant manager at
Claiborne, said Secretariat had an
incurable condition known as
Laminitis, an inflammation of the
inside of the hoof.
He was put down at 11:45 a.m.
EDT at Claiborne Farm in Paris,
where he stood at stud, said Koch.
"Of course, I'm terribly sorry
to lose an old friend," Chenery

'To me, he was always
No. 1, the greatest
horse anybody ever
saw. Everybody
thought he was going
to be great before he
ever started, and he
was.'

said. "As long as he was alive, his
memories had more immediacy."
Koch said Secretariat's condi
tion "rapidly worsened" on Tues
day, putting the chestnut stallion
in "extreme pain for the first
time." Secretariat was to be
buried at the farm Wednesday.
Koch said Walter Kaufman, res
ident veterinarian at the farm, put
the animal to sleep. The condition
was diagnosed on Labor Day,
Koch said.
"When the inflamation occurs,
swelling results," Koch said. "And
since there is little room for swell
ing, this is a very painful condi
tion."
Not only did Secretariat win the
Kentucky Derby and Belmont

Stakes in record time, but he
probably also would have set a
record in the Preakness if the
timing hadn't malfunctioned.
Secretariat won 16 of 21 races
in two years, but most fans re
member the Belmont best. Al
ready a winner in the Derby and
Preakness, Secretariat barreled
down the homestretch at Belmont
Park, and, amazingly, he was
alone. It was 31 lengths back to
Twice a Prince. Using the cus
tomary racing equivalent of one
fifth of a second per length,
Secretariat was under the wire
