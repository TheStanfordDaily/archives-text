If practice makes perfect, this
team will be unbeatable.
Stanford women's volleyball
Coach Don Shaw has worked the
Cardinal women's team hard in
practice this week in preparation
for today's match at No. 2 UCLA.
After losing to 18th-ranked
Oregon on Saturday night in a
five-game match Stanford should
have won, Shaw seemed deter
mined to have his team ready for
today's conference showdown.
"I hope that we come back
strong this week and work hard
in practice and start feeling a little
better about ourselves," Shaw
said after the loss on Saturday.
"We just need to be ready for
practice on Monday. That's the
thing that's first and foremost in
my mind, Monday's practice.
That's the first opportunity we'll
have to try and improve as a
team."
Freshman hitter Laurie Sawin
shared her coach's evaluation on
Saturday. "Maybe we're not doing
the job in practice," she said, "and
that's where we've got to work
[on our problemsl."
The attitude of the team, how
ever, is surprisingly upbeat after
three practices and one tirade by
Shaw on Tuesday. Shaw exploded
late during Tuesday practice "to
get the point across," in his words.
"Every once in a while I've got
to lose it . . . just to get them to
snap out of it," Shaw said on
Tuesday. "We've really picked up
the pace in practice. [It's] been
much more difficult physically
and in turn mentally the team is
tougher, because when you're
tired you've got to work that

much harder to concentrate."
Shaw's philosophy toward pre
paring for the Bruins has brought
the Cardinal together this week
and engendered the teamwork
Shaw demands.
"We've been having some tough
practices," sophomore hitter Amy
Cooper said. "It's good for the
team because ... we have to work
more as a team to get through
them."
"[Last weekend] ... we played
to survive and to avoid losing,"
senior Laura Olesen, the team
captain, said. "What I think we've
beai trying to do this week in
practice is play to win, to take it
as a challenge. Hopefully it will
carry over to [tonight]."
The match tonight is the most
important so far this season for
both UCLA and Stanford. The
Bruins are undefeated in Pacific
10 Conference play at 4-0 and 9-1
overall, their only loss coming at
the hands of No. 1 Hawaii. Stan
ford, though 8-3 overall and
ranked sixth, trails UCLA by a
single game in the conference
standings. Tonight's match, along
with the rematch Nov. 3 at Stan
ford, are expected to decide the

conference championship.
The Bruins field one of the
most experienced and talented
teams in the country, led by last
year's Pac-10 Player of the Year,
Daiva Tomkus. Tomkus has hit
an impressive .442 this season,
which leads the Bruins, as well
as heading the list in kills (111),
service aces (16) and blocks (70).
Sophomore Elaine Youngs is sec
ond in kills and junior Samantha
Shaver leads in digs.
Stanford will counter the Bruin

attack without senior setter Lara
Asper, who continues to recover
from a back injury. Shaw said that
he is concerned that Asper may
have a herniated disk which will
require surgery. Freshman Carrie
Feldman has performed ad
mirably in Asper's place and will
likely start tonight.
Shaw, however, has indicated
that he is considering changes in
the starting lineup but refuses to
speculate on who may replace
whom.

"We're at a tough time right
now," he 3aid. "But it's still the
beginning of October, so there's
no need to panic. We just need to
start putting the pieces together.
We've been dealt a setback, but
we need to do the best we can
and make the most of the situa
tion."
"If we can just play at the same
consistent level, instead of one
game really well and the next ter
rible, we should be fine," junior
hitter Cheryl Conly said.
