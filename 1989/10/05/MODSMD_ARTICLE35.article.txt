# Coalition statement

### 
The following is the statement read yesterday in court by Cheryl Taylor on behalf
of the 53 students who were sentenced.

We, 53 of the students who participated
in the May 15 takeover of University Pres
ident Donald Kennedy's office, would like
to take this opportunity to explain who
we are and the reasons behind the bold
action we took.
At Stanford, members of our coalition,
the Agenda for Action Coalition, are active
in many areas of campus life. Our group
includes resident assistants, Public Serv
ice Center coordinators, academic assis
tants, varsity athletes, student body
senators and student body presidents —
students who contribute to virtually every
aspect of student life.
As members of the Stanford commu
nity, we are proud of the accomplish
ments of our school. More than that,
though, we are committed to the better
ment of our University and the realization
of its vision of democratic education.
It is out of this commitment to demo
cratic education that each of us became
involved in contributing to the multicul
tural advancement of the University.
Many of us, as members of organiza
tions tnat represent the communities of
color on campus, formulated proposals,
worked in research committees and met
with administrators throughout the year
to obtain a tenure track position for a
professor to teach Asian-American
studies, a full-time dean for the Chi
cano/Latino ethnic center and an im

proved Afro-American Stud'es program.
We talked to graduate stuoent teaching
assistants, surveyed undergraduates
about the quality of their class sections
and again met with administrators to relay
the need for improvement in this area.
Students have been pushing for some
of our issues for up to 20 years, and
despite much hard work last year, it
looked like another year would end with
out any concrete improvement.
We are pleased that the court has
recognized the group effort of our coa
lition and that we are being given equal
penalties. However, we are distressed
that one of our peers, Louis Jackson,
has been viewed as having an outstand
ing role in the takeover. His participation
in the demonstration was not unique and
was no more formative or violent than
the actions of any of the other members.
We believe that for justice to be served,
Louis Jackson should be treated as an
equal member of a group effort.
On May 15, we acted out of our
deepest belief in the fundamental ideals
of Stanford, and more broadly, of this
country — that all people are equal, and
that our institutions and education should
reflect that equality. It is in keeping with
that spirit, and out of our respect for the
laws of this country, that we accept the
penalty for our demonstration.
