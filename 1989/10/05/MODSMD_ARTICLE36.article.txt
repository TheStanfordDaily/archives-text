# Judge Manley's comments

The following is the speech Judge Stephen Manley gave the 53 protesters prior to sentencing them yesterday.

All of you appearing here to be sen
tenced are appearing here based on
my insistence that you be present.
There's a reason for that. And that is
this: In today's court system ... it is
possible to be sentenced in the ab
sence of counsel and have no contact
so to speak with the court system. I
think it's very important that you do
have contact with the court system
and know something about us, what
we stand for and particularly what my
view is regarding sentencing in this
case.
There's a tremendous number of
cases we're required to hear, and we
often do not have the time to spend
to review in detail with defendants in
dividually the basis for the sentence
as indicated. However, in your cases,
when they were first presented to me,
I met with your attorneys. I met with
the district attorney. I even invited one
of your representatives to be present
in the hopes that you would be ap
prised of the procedures in court.
Subsequent to the plea of no con
test, I have listened to representatives
of Stanford University's Department of
Public Safety. I have taken the time,
ladies and gentlemen, to examine the
underlying issues that led you to
protest and subsequent events.
These issues are not new. Your
spokesperson quite eloquently stated

them, witf. respect to curriculum, hiring
professors, deans, respect of ethnic
diversity, discrimination grievance
boards. These and many others issues
exist today, not only at Stanford Uni
versity but other campuses, and
they're going to continue to exist be
cause education at a higher level is
always going to be a question-and
answer proposition, a dialogue be
tween students, professors and those
who are in control of the university. It
is the framework in which that dialogue
takes place that I am concerned with,
and I believe that it has been ad
dressed by your leaders. The university
is not an ivory tower, but at the same
time it's not a combat zone either.
I am well aware, as I'm sure you
are from your studies, that there will
always be those in our society that
because of the importance of one issue
or another, feel that they are not re
sponsible to the law, that the law itself
is an enemy, that the courts are an
enemy, and that they will not abide by
the law.
Although we can have a thousand
resolutions to the kind of society we
want to have for all of us, we cannot
have a society without a willingness
to work within the law as it exists to
achieve change.
I have a sense that some of you
may have had some difficulty under

standing the distinction between the
penalties imposed by the University
and the punishments we've imposed
— and there is a distinction — and
this is the reason I was unwilling to
make the punishment I impose con
current with the punishment of the Uni
versity.
The University has its own proce
dures and policies and penalties and
the ultimate prerogative as a private
institution to suspend students or ter
minate their relationship with the Uni
versity.
The court stands in a different po
sition. It is only when the University
calls in law enforcement that we be
come involved and it is my hope that
this does not happen again in the fu
ture — that you are able to work out,
within the confines of the University
and within your own community ... a
resolution, and I greatly appreciate the
sincerity of your leader's words as to
an expression all 53 of you intend to
do in the future. However, you should
also be aware and understand ... that
probation not only involves your being
able to clear your record but your
abiding by the law. If that does not
take place, there are additonal
proceedings that take place ... and
additional punishments and penalties.
However, I see no reason for you
to ever return here ...
