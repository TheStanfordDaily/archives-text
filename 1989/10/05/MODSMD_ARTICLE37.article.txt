## THE
						STANFORD DAILY'S ENTERTAINING WEEKLY Lively Arts celebrates 20 years Bright stars light up Lively Arts 
### Martha Brockenbrough Editorial staff 
In a University as extraordinary as
Stanford, all too often the outstanding
appears ordinary, and the noteworthy
just doesn't get noticed.
And in a University as technically
oriented as Stanford, the performing arts
are among the first programs that fall
into the abyss of obscurity — like the
Stanford Summer Festival that used to
take place annually in Frost Amphithea
ter.
Even with internationally acclaimed
groups like the Joffrey Ballet and the
Boston Symphony Orchestra on the
season schedule, the festival lost money
and was canceled by the University 20
years ago.
"The University understood the im
portance of presenting cultural programs
at a major institution like Stanford," said
Lois Wagner, director of University
Events and Services. To fill that com
munity need, the University introduced
the Lively Arts at Stanford, a program
organized by University Events and Serv
ices.
And two decades later, the Lively Arts
has never been better.
As Wagner said, "We used our 20th
anniversary as an excuse to pull in
brighter stars than in the past."
That is an understatement, consider
ing the rich tapestry of performers sched
uled to visit Stanford through the Lively
Arts this year.
Brightest among those stars is legen
dary Israeli-born violinist Itznak
Perlman, whose only appearance in the
Bay Area this year will be at the Lively
Arts on Oct. 22.
Names as big as Perlman's indicate
the Lively Arts' reputation as a major
programmer in the region. Yet diverse
presentations are just as important as
attracting the world-famous performers,
Wagner said. "We want to be able to
enhance the (CIV) program."
Various acts recommended by the per
forming arts faculty and ticket buyers
are considered when the Lively Arts di
rectors sit down to decide each season's
acts. "Anyone can call and make
(programming) suggestions," Wagner
said.
Lively Arts programmers keep this in
put in mind when they visit agents at
an annual scheduling conference. Then
they compare the availability and cost
of each performer with the Lively Arts'
facilities and budget.
Logistics are not the sole programming
concern, however. Wagner stressed that
the schedule must remain "full
rounded." She added, "We want every
type of person to have something they'd
like to see."
In addition to luminaries like Perlman,
this year's Lively Arts schedule includes
"young artists who need the recognition
of a major institution like Stanford,"
Wagner said, as well as "ethnic program
ming to help students understand
cultural diversity."
"It's not only entertainment," Wagner
added. "With it we're bringing an edu
cation to help understand the different
cultures so that we can embrace and
appreciate them."
Wagner is most excited about Afncan-
Amencan performer John O'Neal who
will play a fictional folk character created
dunng the Civil Rights Movement of the
19605.

As "Junebug Jabbo Jones," O'Neal
weaves a three-part tale recounting the
Black experience throughout their tur
bulent history in the United States .
"People are really going to learn some
thing," she said.
The Lively Arts program presents di
versity that cuts across cultural lines, as
well. Scheduled to appear Oct. 14 is dis
abled poet and playwright Neil Marcus
performing "Storm Reading."
Marcus, originally a Berkeley resident,
suffers from a physically — but not men
tally — degenerating disease. "He has
set out to help people understand the
lives of disabled people better," Wagner
said.
His brother Roger who is an actor,
and Veteran Access Theatre performer
Kathryn Voice, who signs "Storm
Reading," develop this understanding

with Marcus in his unique three
character play.
This diverse menu of performers in
dicates broader programming that Wag
ner has favored since she became
University Events and Services Director
five years ago.
"We're still presenting everything that
we did before, but the programming has
been expanded in all areas," she said.
Her ambition is only checked by lack
of facilities, and the University require
ment that the Lively Arts program "break
even," Wagner saia.
"We don't make it on ticket sales."
About 69 percent of the Lively Arts' rev
enue comes from ticket sales, as com
pared to the national average of 60
percent for similar programming agen
cies.
