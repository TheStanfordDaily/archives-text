# Keith Terry defies the imagination
## Amazing world-premiere show opens next week 
### 
Gravity-defying Keith Terry will world
premiere "Sound Proof," his often bizarre,
always entertaining new performance work
in Memorial Auditorium next Thursday and
Friday at 8 p.m.
Terry pulls music and rhythm out of
everything from his armpits to raw vegeta
bles, rubber balls and plastic bubble wrap
in a multiple-work performance commis
sioned by the Lively Arts.
In one number, Terry performs a
monologue as a survivor of spontaneous
human combustion. And in another sketch,
Tferry demonstrates sleeping and eating to
the beat as a character obsessed with
rhythm. He transforms everyday household
items — scissors, dust busters and a bucket
of water — into percussion instruments dur
ing his obsession routine.
Terry also demonstrates a global perspec
tive on some cultural changes that the
United States is currently experiencing.
Since 1983, Terry has joined his creative

energy with choreographer Kimi Okada. He
has also worked with Bobbv McFerrin, Robin
Williams and The Pickle Family Circus.
Other performing experiences include
stints with the San Francisco Mime Troupe,
and at the Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival.
Terry has been featured on a PBS special,
"The Lonesome Pine."
His performances have taken him from
the Far East to the Pacific Northwest. In
fluences on his art have been just as diverse,
ranging from Japanese Taiko drumming to
Ethiopian armpit music.
He has several soundtracks under his belt,
including "Salmon on the Run," a PBS Nova
presentation and "Bridge of Dreams," a Betty
Walberg film.
Tickets to "Sound Proof' are $15 and $13,
with a $3 student discount. As with all
Lively Arts events, tickets can be bought at
the Tresidder ticket window, or through
dormitories.
