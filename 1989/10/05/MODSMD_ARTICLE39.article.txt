# Lyme Disease has Mom and Surgeon Admiral Koop 'ticked' off
## 
### 
When I was young my mother used to
tell me, "Andrew, you must never ex
change bodily fluids with anyone else,"
although she meant as Chnstmas gifts.
Still, this brings up an important point:
We are in the midst of a worldwide health
crisis. This has been hammered home
time and time again by former U.S. Sur
geon General C. Everett Koop, who is a
respected figure in the medical community
despite the fact that his mother still
dresses him in sailor suits.
Of course, as everyone knows, the num
ber one most absolutely fatal disease in
the world right now is Lyme Disease, an
incurable illness caused primarily by
Newsweek magazine. That's right,
Newsweek. Used to be nofoxiy caught
Lyme disease. Then suddenly Newsweek
put an ugly photo of a giant tick on its
cover and BOOM! the disease spread like
wildfire. Also, a number of people mistook
the cover photo for Dan Quayle, which
helped launch the Republican ticket into
the White House.
The symptoms of Lyme Disease include
tiredness, nausea, pain in the joints, dis
orientation and the general feeling of being
a postal employee. If you experience any
of these symptoms you should see a doctor

immediately, or pos3ibly even talk to one.
Left untreated, a person infected with
Lyme Disease could conceivably turn into
the maggot-like thing that Geena Davis
gave birtn to in"The Fly." At least it's
fun to imagine that that could happen.
(Have Geena Davis as a mom, I mean.)
Luckily, since it is spread by infected
ticks, Lyme Disease is easy to prevent,
providing the tick wears a condom.
Another scourge that has reared its ugly
head (we're not talking about Dan Quayle
this time) is high cholesterol, which is
the vogue malady these days. I mean,
everylxidy's got it. If you don't have high
cholesterol you should seriously consider
ing renting some.
Found in many foods, cholesterol is a
chemical substance that causes severe
medical difficulties, most notably a
proliferation of commercials for oat bran.
It also causes hardening of the arteries
(scientific term: "artdecosclerosis"). Cut
ting down on your cholesterol, though, is
as simple as watching what you eat. As
a public service, listed below are some
foods that are high in cholesterol, and
others that are cholesterol-free.
Foods high in cholesterol: Meats,
breads, dairy products, Porpoise McNug

gets®, fruit, vegetables, desserts.
Cholestcrol-frcc foods: Mucus, ticks.
Like Lyme Disease, high cholesterol is
a relatively new problem in modern soci
ety. In medieval times, for instance, people
didn't worry about their cholesterol be
cause everyone ate "natural" foods and
maintained "sensible" diets and were fre
quently "disemboweled" by a passing
knight on horseback before tne age of 40.
Now up to this point we've ignored
perhaps the most serious health problem
of them all: smoking. Smoking cigarettes
is one of the leading causes of cancer,
along with other scientifically-proven can
cer causes such as eating carcinogenic
foods, exposure to asbestos, trading base
ball cards, jogging, playing with kittens
and trout fishing.
During his tenure as Surgeon Admiral,
Dr. Koop helped strengthen anti-smoking
laws, including changing the warning on
cigarette ads to: WARNING: IT'S ALL
OVER, PAL! Of course, that warning is
in a little box in the comer of the adver
tisment, while the rest of the ad, thanks
to cigarette companies, is dedicated to con
vincing you that smoking is, in fact,
GOOD for you:
"Come up to Lucky Stroke and feel the

mentholated, lubricated, smcnith, filtered
gixxiness of these babies course through
your body. Ybu've come a long way, baby,
but until you pop one of these puppies
in your mouth and feel the healing power
of nicotine you aren't all the way there.
Remember, four out of five smokers of
Lucky Stroke metastasize quickly and die
with relative ease."
To combat these misleading advertis
ments, educators have come up with their
own public service announcements, such
a 9 the one in which a teenager lights up
a cigarette at a party, only to find his high
school friend? moving rapidly away from

him at a velocity close to that achieved
by Chuck Yeager in the movie "The Right
Stuff." Then, leaving their disgusting com
patriot to puff on his cigarette in a corner,
the teenagers climb into their cars and
drive off joyfully toward some typical and
harmless high school activity, such as sel
ling "crack."
I know, all this IS frightening — Lyme
Disease, cholesterol, cancer, teenagers
having drivers licenses — but you should
also know that the United States is blessed
with one of the most comprehensive na
tional health care plans in the world It's
a health plan that guarantees any man,
woman or child suffering from a serious
illness will be hired to work the front
counter at a McDonalds restaurant, par
ticularly if they have open sores.
Really, though, with medical technology
what it is today, the chances of your dying
during your lifetime arc extremely slim
By not smoking, exercising regularly and
eating a sensible diet, you should be as
sured of a long and healthy life. Jutt re
member the old adage "You are what you
eat." It's still good advicc, even today. And
please pass the nuts

TIPS ON ADULTHOOD
When I was young my mother used to
tell me, "Andrew, you must never ex
change bodily fluids with anyone else,"
although she meant as Chnstmas gifts.
Still, this brings up an important point:
We are in the midst of a worldwide health
crisis. This has been hammered home
time and time again by former U.S. Sur
geon General C. Everett Koop, who is a
respected figure in the medical community
despite the fact that his mother still
dresses him in sailor suits.
Of course, as everyone knows, the num
ber one most absolutely fatal disease in
the world right now is Lyme Disease, an
incurable illness caused primarily by
Newsweek magazine. That's right,
Newsweek. Used to be nofoxiy caught
Lyme disease. Then suddenly Newsweek
put an ugly photo of a giant tick on its
cover and BOOM! the disease spread like
wildfire. Also, a number of people mistook
the cover photo for Dan Quayle, which
helped launch the Republican ticket into
the White House.
The symptoms of Lyme Disease include
tiredness, nausea, pain in the joints, dis
orientation and the general feeling of being
a postal employee. If you experience any
of these symptoms you should see a doctor

immediately, or pos3ibly even talk to one.
Left untreated, a person infected with
Lyme Disease could conceivably turn into
the maggot-like thing that Geena Davis
gave birtn to in"The Fly." At least it's
fun to imagine that that could happen.
(Have Geena Davis as a mom, I mean.)
Luckily, since it is spread by infected
ticks, Lyme Disease is easy to prevent,
providing the tick wears a condom.
Another scourge that has reared its ugly
head (we're not talking about Dan Quayle
this time) is high cholesterol, which is
the vogue malady these days. I mean,
everylxidy's got it. If you don't have high
cholesterol you should seriously consider
ing renting some.
Found in many foods, cholesterol is a
chemical substance that causes severe
medical difficulties, most notably a
proliferation of commercials for oat bran.
It also causes hardening of the arteries
(scientific term: "artdecosclerosis"). Cut
ting down on your cholesterol, though, is
as simple as watching what you eat. As
a public service, listed below are some
foods that are high in cholesterol, and
others that are cholesterol-free.
Foods high in cholesterol: Meats,
breads, dairy products, Porpoise McNug

gets®, fruit, vegetables, desserts.
Cholestcrol-frcc foods: Mucus, ticks.
Like Lyme Disease, high cholesterol is
a relatively new problem in modern soci
ety. In medieval times, for instance, people
didn't worry about their cholesterol be
cause everyone ate "natural" foods and
maintained "sensible" diets and were fre
quently "disemboweled" by a passing
knight on horseback before tne age of 40.
Now up to this point we've ignored
perhaps the most serious health problem
of them all: smoking. Smoking cigarettes
is one of the leading causes of cancer,
along with other scientifically-proven can
cer causes such as eating carcinogenic
foods, exposure to asbestos, trading base
ball cards, jogging, playing with kittens
and trout fishing.
During his tenure as Surgeon Admiral,
Dr. Koop helped strengthen anti-smoking
laws, including changing the warning on
cigarette ads to: WARNING: IT'S ALL
OVER, PAL! Of course, that warning is
in a little box in the comer of the adver
tisment, while the rest of the ad, thanks
to cigarette companies, is dedicated to con
vincing you that smoking is, in fact,
GOOD for you:
"Come up to Lucky Stroke and feel the

mentholated, lubricated, smcnith, filtered
gixxiness of these babies course through
your body. Ybu've come a long way, baby,
but until you pop one of these puppies
in your mouth and feel the healing power
of nicotine you aren't all the way there.
Remember, four out of five smokers of
Lucky Stroke metastasize quickly and die
with relative ease."
To combat these misleading advertis
ments, educators have come up with their
own public service announcements, such
a 9 the one in which a teenager lights up
a cigarette at a party, only to find his high
school friend? moving rapidly away from

him at a velocity close to that achieved
by Chuck Yeager in the movie "The Right
Stuff." Then, leaving their disgusting com
patriot to puff on his cigarette in a corner,
the teenagers climb into their cars and
drive off joyfully toward some typical and
harmless high school activity, such as sel
ling "crack."
I know, all this IS frightening — Lyme
Disease, cholesterol, cancer, teenagers
having drivers licenses — but you should
also know that the United States is blessed
with one of the most comprehensive na
tional health care plans in the world It's
a health plan that guarantees any man,
woman or child suffering from a serious
illness will be hired to work the front
counter at a McDonalds restaurant, par
ticularly if they have open sores.
