# Grey re-enters Fundamental Standard debate
## 
### Jeff Brock 
Last year, Law Prof. Thomas
Grey thrust himself into the
middle of a campuswide debate
to limit free speech and protect
individuals from harassment by
proposing an interpretation of
the Fundamental Standard.
The interpretation met with
the approval of the Student Con
duct Legislative Council but
never became University policy.
This year, Grey is again at
work on interpreting the Stand
ard. He said his latest interpre
tation is different from last
year's only in word choice, not
in substance.
The interpretation was re

leased yesterday to The Daily,
Campus Report and the SCLC.
While the SCLC has yet to
hold a meeting and set an
agenda, Grey said he hopes the
council will talk with him about
his interpretation and will strive
to make it University policy.
According to Grey, the inter
pretation deals with the "dis
ciplinary side of discriminatory
verbal abuse on campus."
Grey's proposal emphasizes
four points:
• Since Stanford is "com
mitted to the principles of free
inquiry and expression," stu
dents must respect the rights of
others to express opinions which

many students may find "abhor
rent."
• Harassment of students on
the basis of sex, race, color,
handicap, religion, sexual orien
tation or national and ethnic
origin is a violation of the Stand
ard.
• Prohibited harassment in
cludes discriminatory intimida
tion by threats of violence and
personal insults.
Furthermore, speech is
deemed harassment if it:
• Is intended to insult an in
dividual or small number of in
dividuals (but "group
defamation." or an insult con-
cerning large social groups that
is directed to the campus at large,
is allowed),
• Is addressed directly to an in
dividual or small number of indi
viduals, or
• Uses "fighting" words or non
verbal symbols which "convey
direct and visceral hatred or con
tempt for human beings" on a
discriminatory basis.
According to Grey, his interpre
tation draws the line between
protected free speech and "per

sonal vilification" that is discrim
inatory.
He said that an intent to insult
must be present for speech to be
considered harassment.
In his proposal, Grey points out
that there are some cases in which
students should not be prosecuted
for using insulting terms.
He notes a case in which a stu
dent who hears members of a mi
nority group using insulting
terms for their own group in a
joking way might thoughtlessly
use these terms in the same way.
"Such a person should be told
that this is not funny, but should
not be subject to disciplinary
proceedings," Grey said.
