# Disappear into Su Hong for delightful Chinese
## 
### David Chang Staff writer 
Recently, we made a surprise
visit to Su Hong Restaurant in
Menlo Park to investigate some
rumors of delectable Mandarin and
Szechuan cooking. For the most
part, we weren't disappointed.
Su Hong Restaurant is located
in the middle of a row of
storefronts on El Camino Real.
Once we went inside, though, we
discovered a tastefully decorated
waiting room, complete with a
well-stocked bar. Before long, a
table was found for our party of
seven in one of several dining
rooms.
We kicked the meal off with a
plate of mu shu pork ($6.50),
which we ordered without pork for
the vegetarians in the party. De
spite the Sunday evening crowd,
the dish was brought out promptly,
and we were occupied with folding
mu shu pancakes and consuming
them while the other dishes were
being prepared.
The mu shu suffered from either
undercooking or the absence of the
pork, because the crunch of the
cabbage dominated the flavor of
the carrot slices, ginger, black
mushrooms and onion. The plum
sauce provided a good firm ground
ing for the dish, though.
From there, we went on to the
spicy eggplant in garlic sauce
($5.25), another dish that we or
dered vegetarian. The eggplant
chunks were cooked to a tender
firmness that went well with the
zesty seasonings.
The sweet-and-sour chicken
($6.50), a traditional favorite, was
pleasant in a mildly sweet version
of sweet-and-sour sauce that
reminded me of the flavor of
cherries. Served with diced pine
apple and green and red bell pepper
slices, the crunchy chicken was
quick to disappear.

One of my favorites was the gen
eral's chicken ($6.95), a plateful
of small, batter-fried cnicken
pieces. For the price, this dish had
little substance or meatiness; it
was more like an appetizer. But
the hot, crunchy niblets were light
and tasty.
For seafood, we ordered the scal
lops with garlic sauce ($7.95), an
other spicy dish. The good-sized
scallop chunks were extremely
tender, complemented by crunchy
water chestnuts and carrots. The
chef did a good job of judging spici
ness, since the relatively mild scal
lops weren't overwhelmed by the
powerful sauce.
The overall winner, in my op
inion, was the delicious prawns in
lobster sauce ($7.95). The prawns
were firm and fresh in the mixture
of sauce, peas and egg. The egg
evidently was beaten and then
cooked in the sauce, allowing it to
absorb faint flavors of lobster, gar
lic and butter. A tender and subtle
combination.
Hot entrees were clearly marked
in the menus; the names were
printed in red ink. Service was
prompt, and the servings were rea
sonable. Unfortunately, the rice
was dry and overcooked — a sig
nificant flaw that shouldn't be dif
ficult to correct — but I was able
to forgive that when we received
a free plate of fried bananas, still
hot, complete with whipped cream
and a brown sugary topping that
left a satisfying peanut aftertaste.
The fried bananas are com
plimentary to all evening diners,
but we left feeling like we had
received special treatment. Careful
cooking, few flaws, good service
and moderate prices. Not bad at
all.

Su Hong Restaurant is located at
