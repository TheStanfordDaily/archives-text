If you've been searching for an
escape from the traditional dining
experience, Jose's Cuban Restau
rant on El Camino is the place for
you. Jose's offers unique dishes
that are guaranteed to please even
the pickiest of palates.
For the down-home eater, Jose
himself cooks up dishes that a
fiercly loyal clientele raves about.
"A cook is like a chemist," Jose
says, "You just keep trying until
you get it right."
And Jose has gotten it right.
From ribs to pizza to empanadas
— golden-baked pastries stuffed
with cheese, chicken, beef or veg
etables — Jose hits the mark every
time.
Pizza connoisseurs must try

Jose's creations, which were
around years before designer pizza
came in to vogue. Fie used to serve
up Flawaiian-style pizza and an
exotic creation with calamari.
But now that these are com
monplace, Jose has moved on to
new horizons of culinary creativity.
Fiis pizza now features a sweet,
doughy crust topped with barbeque
sauce and whatever the serious
eater's heart desires.
Jose's legendary ribs, smothered
in a tangy barbeque sauce, even
come with a bib — and yes, the
server will tie it on you.
His most unusual dish, however,
is the empanada. Melted cheese,
meat, chicken or vegetables
seasoned to a zippy perfection fill
a light, flaky pastry. The em
panadas are so popular that Jose

has opened a factory next door
where frozen ones are sold.
The atmosphere provides almost
as much incentive to eat at Jose's
as the food. Dried flowers decorate
each wooden table; plants and
cured prosciutto hams dangle from
the ceiling; and, of course, the one
and only Jose is there, working his
kitchen wizardry.
Meals usually cost anywhere
from $6.50 to 12 dollars. Portions
are generous, though, and well
worth the moderate prices Jose
charges.
Next time you're heading down
El Camino, stop at Jose's. You'll
be glad you did.

Jose's is located at 2275 El Camino
Real.
