# Petite Gourmet
## Subtle sophistication 
### Denise Morris 
In the midst of Stanford Shopping Center glitz,
the Petite Gourmet — a sandwich shop and gourmet
deli — exudes subtle sophistication.
I found myself wanting to grab a pair of non
prescnption glasses and wildly gesticulate with the
tweedy intellectuals who gather there.
European warmth oozes from the brick-laid floor
to the wooden cabinets laden with pottery vessels,
imported cookies, artistic paraphernalia, including
cow-shaped milk pitchers and elephant mugs.
This warmth is fostered by a staff that believes in
the business and works together to provide personal
service to its customers.
And their sandwiches are magnifique! At least two
inches of fixings lie between the bread of your choice.
And unlike a typical deli sandwich, Petite Gourmet
creations are carefully constructed to satisfy your
personal taste.
In addition to sandwiches, Petite Gourmet offers
a variety of imported cheeses, fresh pasta salads,
meat and vegetarian dishes. The candy case is stocked
daily with fresh confections made in a local French
patisserie.
And to eliminate hours of cooking, gourmet entrees
are also sold by the half pint. If you plan to entertain
famished guests, Petite Gourmet can cater your affair.
But for someone who just wants to hang out, the
cafe atmosphere is inviting.
You could happily sip espresso at an outside table
with a friend, watching the capitalists go by.

Petite Gourmet is located at the Stanford Shopping
Center between The Emporium, Units and Thinker
Toys.
