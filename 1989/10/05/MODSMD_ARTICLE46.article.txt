# Frankie, Johnnie, Luigi and some tasty Italian food, too

Every so often, a newspaper makes a
mistake, and the next day it runs a
sheepish correction in a special corner of
the news section.
In Intermission, we don't like to miss
out on any of the fun of screwing up.
And when we arc caught in the wrong,
we'll eat our words — literally.
A restaurant guide printed in the Ori
entation Issue of The Daily recom
mended avoiding the Italian Dinners at
Frankie, Johnnie & Luigi Too, a classy
Italian restaurant in Mountain View.
Since that guide was written, however,
the restaurant has introduced new Italian
dinners to their line-up.
And, the rookie recipes are a smashing
success. No longer are Frankie, Johnnie
& Luigi Too pasta dishes an example of
high-density dining.
In step with a more sophisticated,
health-conscious clientele, the restaurant
offers considerably lighter cuisine from
all over Italy.
One particularly good dish, prawns
napolitana, illustrates this new focus.
Tiger prawns and bay shrimp and mush
rooms seasoned with fresh garlic, shallots
and scallions are generously heaped over

delicate linguini and covered with feather
light tomato sauce. The result — a meal
that doesn't drag you down.
You can still find traditional, creamy
imports from Northern Italy, however.
Consuming a plate full of glorious lin
guine broccolini — pasta tossed with
broccoli, sage, gorgonzola and fontina
cheeses — was practically a religious ex
perience (although my arteries are threat
ening devil worship in retaliation).
The sauteed vegetable appetizer — per
fectly cooked carrots, broccoli, beans and
cauliflower in a delicate cream sauce —
managed to surpass even the broccoli
linguine, though.
The pizza, however, was a different
story. The crust, although nice and crispy
on the bottom, was overcooked on the
edges, bland and practically naked of
sauce. The little bit that did make it on
the pizza was flavorless anyhow — adding
more sauce probably wouldn't have
rescued the dish.
Visit Frankie, Johnnie & Luigi, Too if
you want to impress a date or feed your
folks on parent's weekend. The service
is excellent, the decor tasteful.

Frankie, fohnnie Luigi, Too is located
at 939 West El Cammo Real in Mountain
View. Call 967-5384 for reservations.
