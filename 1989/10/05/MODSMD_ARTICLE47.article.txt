# Nothing tops the Grateful Dead live
## 
### Mark Pinkus Staff writer 
Spending an evening with six Berkeley
students may not be the typical way to
enjoy a Sunday night for a Stanford stu
dent, but last weekend at the Shoreline
Amphitheater, nothing was typical.
Two decades ago Bill Graham said,
"There is nothing like a Grateful Dead
concert." And now that the eighties are
waning, Graham's proclamation proves
to be just as true as ever.
The Grateful Dead rolled into town
for three shows at Shoreline last week
end, once again proving their vitality as
musicians. But there's more to the Dead
than just the music.
The average fans coming to the average
concert at Shoreline tend to arrive about
a half hour late and will most likely talk
to no one else at the show except the
people they came with.
The average fans expect to hear the
hits. They plan on sitting down through
out most of the evening, and certainly
during the slow songs.
And if they happen to buy shirts, they

buy the ready-made kind from vendors
inside the pavilion.
The opposite of this — and a whole
lot more — goes down at a Dead show.
Show — and not concert — is the
only way to describe the event that is
the Grateful Dead in a live performance.
The parking lot was filled hours before
the show even began, with the usual
home-made items up for sale. Anything
from magic brownies to tie-dyes could
be purchased for a reasonable price.
And just when this Deadhead was sure
it was the same old parking lot scene,
though, I stumbled across a massage
table where a peculiar-looking woman
was giving some grateful person a rub
down while others waited in the wings.
Readers who have never experienced
a Dead show are probably wondering if
the band actually played.
Realize, however, that to many die
hard Dead fans, the music is only part
of the reason for going. Many don't even
go inside, preferring instead to pass the
time with bongoes, guitars and long
haired friends.
But here's what the people on the in

side saw.
Twenty minutes late as usual, the
band sashayed on stage and tuned for
five minutes. After attending 27 Dead
shows, I still haven't figured out why
such a routine activity isn't handled by
some roadies backstage. But I guess it's
just another example of the Dead's at
titude — nothing is routine.
"Jack Straw" started things off in the
right direction, and the following
"Ramble on Rose" told the near-capacity
crowd that they were in store for one
hot show.
As the evening wore on, Garcia lost
vocal intensity and clarity.
It was Garcia's golden voice during
"Knockin' On Heaven's Door" that
forced my arms around the shoulders of
my blue-and-gold-clad comrades.
As the crowd filed out, one of those
Bear-backers asked me to get him tickets
for the Dead shows in Frost this spring.
"Sorry buddy," I told him about the
two best shows of the year, "Those tick
ets are for us."
See you there.
