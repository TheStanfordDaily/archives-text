# Dr. Feelgood doesn't...
## 
### Gene Anaya Senior staff writer 
Their last hit was "Girls, Girls, Girls."
With their new release, "Dr. Feelgood," they
have expanded their artistic horizons to in
clude a song with two different words in its
title.
(Before "Girls,. . ." came "Smoking in the
Boys' Room" with five words. But it was a
cover tune, so it doesn't count.)
Of course, I'm talking about Motley Criie,
whose most inspiring quality is that they
have two umlauts in their name. Although
half the band's members have recently gone
through drug treatment programs, they have
yet to become true rock icons. They're still
more like rock cartoons.
Chorus:
They're Motley Criie, Criie, Criie
Their album sucks, hut it's really had,
tiie, tiie, tiie
They're Motley Criie, Criie, Criie
And their new album, "Dr. Feelgood," does
little to change this fact. After the jamming
title song, which sounds damn good, the
rest of "Dr. Feelgood" simply fails to live
up to its musical potential. Not even the
pretentious pseudo-metal ballads "Without
You" and "Time For Change," with Skid
Row on backup vocals, are enough to ensure
the same audience that listens to similar

trash by really lame bands, like Warrant
and Bullet Boys.
Instead of going for substantial lyrics or
shredding heavy metal tunes, Motley Criie
aimed for commercial success. But the only
list on which this album will rate highly is
the PMRC's Christmas banning list. Only
AC/DC and Whitesnake have written songs
as suggestive as the Criie's "She Goes
Down" (with Cheap Trick's Robin Zander
lending a helping voice), and "Rattlesnake
Shake."
Guitar solo
Titles aren't the only examples of the
Criie's licentiousness. Nikki Sixx's lewd
lyrics, such as "Snake wants to spit / Call
9-7-6 and let my hand do the rest," permeate
the album.
Of course, bassist Sixx doesn't deserve all
the blame — en, 1 mean credit. After all,
he did co-write most of the music with
guitarist Mick Mars, whose performance
wanes, along with the rest of the album,
after the first track.
Accordion solo
The best way to characterize "Dr. Feel
good" is done by the Criie themselves in
the song "Same Ol' Situation." After four
albums, Motley Criie is still churning out
the same ol' crap. Perhaps they should take
their own advice and realize that it's "Time
For Change."
