# 'Johnny Handsome' looks good
## 
### Jason Moore 
"Johnny Handsome" creates an at
mosphere as distinct as 100 percent
humidity.
Director Walter Hill takes the viewer
on a fascinating journey into the New
Orleans of neon beer signs and peeling
paint — the home of armed robber
Johnny Handsome.
Both enigmatic and pathetic, Johnny
(Mickey Rourke) carries the social and
psychological burden of a grotesquely
deformed face. The only world he
knows is the seedy one of strip-joints,
charity wards and prison farms.
Opening with a failed armed robbery,
the film quickly shifts to Johnny's op
portunity for escape from his hellish
world. A near fatal stabbing at a Lou
isiana prison brings him under the care
of the compassionate prison doctor.
Dr. Resher (Forest Whitaker), moved
by compassion for Johnny, and inter
ested in testing his social theories, of
fers Johnny a new life via reconstruc
tive surgery and speech therapy.
Johnny begins his new life as a

shipyard worker and wins an early
parole. All the while New Orleans
Police Lieutenant Jones (Morgan
Freeman) hovers over Johnny, waiting
for him to return to his criminal ways.
When Johnny meets Donna, a com
puter operator at the shipyard, he
seems well on his way to a normal
life. Yet all of this crumbles away as
Johnny begins to plot revenge on the
murderers of his surrogate big brother.
The last third of the film becomes
a conventional, although interesting,
armed robbery story.
Solid performances are the norm in
"Johnny Handsome." Especially con
vincing is Mickey Rourke. His
portrayal of Johnny evokes imagery of
a wounded animal that yearns for help.
Based on John Godey's novel, "The
Three Worlds of Johnny Handsome,"
Ken Friedman's script provides believ
able dialogue and an effective, though
unoriginal, resolution to the story.
"Johnny Handsome" explores one
man's attempt to change the physical
and mental states of his life — and it
is that element of the film that makes
it worth seeing.


Lieutenant Jones, played by Morgan
Freeman, is ready to pull the trigger
on Johnny if he reverts to his pre
surgery life of crime.
