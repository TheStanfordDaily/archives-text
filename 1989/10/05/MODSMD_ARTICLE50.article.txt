# 'Music Teacher' a masterpiece

### Sarah Laurence 
"The Music Teacher" is one of
those few films that leave you full
and satisfied, as if you just stepped
away from a good meal.
The love story of an ex-opera
singer, his wife and two proteges,
"The Music Teacher" begins with
a wholesome batter of sympa
thetic, realistic characters and a
simple plot, which director Gerard
Corbiau bakes to perfection and
glazes with a combination of clas
sical music and beautiful scenery
that recalls "A Room With a
View."
Joachim Dallayrac (lose van
Dam), an opera star in his prime,
astonishes the turn-of-the century

European art world by leaving the
stage to open a music school in
his secluded French chateau.
His sole pupil is a beautiful 18-
year old, Sophie, played by Anne
Roussel. Dallayrac plucks a second
student, Jean (Phillipe Volter),
from the village square after
hearing Jean sing while he picked
the pockets of the townspeople.
When Sophie and Jean are in
vited to a singing competition in
England sponsored by Prince Scot
ti, Dallayrac's old rival, Dallayrac
realizes his students are ready to
emerge from the shelter of his
tutelage.
Sophie and Jean perform bril
liantly at the competition, in spite
of Scotti's many attempts to

destroy their composure.
Scotti even arranges a masked
singing duel between Jean and his
own protege, Areas. Their tense
showdown will keep you on the
edge of your seat.
The filmmakers thoughtfully in
cluded subtitles not only to the
mostly French dialogue, but also
to the German and Italian song
lyrics.
This touch enhances scenes
where the characters sing rather
than speak their feelings. "The
Music Teacher's" soundtrack con
tains works by Mahler, Schubert,
Mozart and other giants.
Always, music sets the mood in
"The Music Teacher."


The masked characters of Jean and Arcus battle one another with their voices during a gripping
scene from the "Music Teacher," now playing at The Aquarius in Palo Alto.
