# Draw places all but handful

With the exception of a handful of un
dergraduate men who are still in search of
on-campus housing, all students who took
part in last spring's Draw and would accept
any kind of housing have been assigned a
residence.
All female undergraduates, female grad
uate students and male graduate students
on the waiting list who were willing to
take any on-campus spot were assigned as
of yesterday, said Rodger Whitney, assistant
dean of residential affairs and director of
Student Housing. "Probably less than 10"
undergraduate males, who are now a week
into the quarter, are still unsure of their
residence status, Whitney said.
Also, those students who would only ac
cept certain residences probably will not
be accommodated, Whitney said.
Whitney said he hoped to place the
remaining male undergraduates into on
campus residences within the next tew
days.
Last year, the University managed to
provide housing for all those who remained
on the waiting list by the start of classes.
The Housing Center never made any
promises to repeat last year's feat, Whitney
said. But he added that he was pleased
with this year's accomplishment of placing
all female and male graduate students who
needed housing.
Despite the reopening of Roble Hall and
its 295 Bpots, Whitney said there is still
not enough housing on the campus to ac
commodate all undergraduates.

Even if the remaining undergraduate
men receive housing, there will still be
students, such as those who did not par
ticipate in the Draw, who will want housing
but cannot get it, Whitney said.
The waiting list period continues until
Dec. 1.
"What we ... say in the summer is that
you should stay on the waiting list through
out and come to walk-ins because in some
years, we accommodate everybody on the
waiting list by the time walk-ins are over.
For women this year, we did. It's not a
fine science to know how the spaces are
going to fill and who's going to drop at the
last minute," he said.
The undergraduate men still on the
waiting list are those who drew numbers
close to 5,000, and some entered the Draw
late.
Admitting that the current waiting list
system has its problems and distracts stu
dents from their studies while they search
for housing, Whitney said that finding "100
percent undergraduate housing" is a "mtyor
goal" for himself and the University.
