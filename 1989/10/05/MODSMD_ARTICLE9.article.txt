Job possibilities to be offered
It's not too soon for seniors and others to start
the inevitable job hunt, as Career Faire '89 will
be held in White Plaza (or in the Inner Quad in
case of rain) on Friday from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m.
Over 151 employers, including businesses, gov
ernment agencies and public-interest organiza
tions will attend the fair. The annual event is
designed to give students and employers an in
formal opportunity to discuss general career op
portunities as well as specific information about
each organization.
This year's Career Faire will be "the largest
ever held at Stanford," according to Yolanda
Morales, coordinator of recruitment activities for
the fair, which is sponsored by the Career Plan
ning and Placement Center.
"Diversity in career opportunities has ex
panded, and these organizations want to see Stan
ford students at all levels, from freshmen to
Ph.D.s," she said.
Twenty-nine percent of this year's fair partic
ipants will be public service organizations, the
highest percentage ever. The fair will be divided
into liberal arts, technical and public serv
ice/education areas.
Career Faire '89 will also include for the first
time a breakfast with employers for Stanford
students with disabilities. The breakfast will be
held from 8:30 to 9:30 a.m. in the Cypress Room
of Tresidder Union.
Career Faire '89 will be open to all Stanford
students. A list of organizations at the fair can
be picked up at the CPPC through Friday, and
maps of the fair will be available at the CPPC
information booths at both ends of White Plaza
the day of the event.

Equal bathroom rights for all
It's a sensitive situation.
Students in the School of Education have
formed a new coalition called CESS POOL —
the Coalition for Equity for Stanford Students:
Program for Objective Organization of
Lavatories.
It seems that the Cubberley Building, which
houses the school, features three public
bathrooms for men but only one for women.
Furthermore, about 65 percent of the school's
students are female, according to Anne Gaddy,
associate dean for administration.
Coalition members said complaints of the in
equity have been filed time and again in recent
years, but no action has been taken. Gaddy said
converting a bathroom from male to female would
cost the University about $8,000.
So last week, CESS POOL members took the
matter into their own hands and converted one

men's bathroom to a women's by changing the
sign on the door — a less expensive remedy.
Two days later, according to a press release,
"the new sign was forcibly removed." CESS
POOL then purchased a second sign stating that
the bathroom is for "Women" only.
Gaddy said the school's administration was not
responsible for removing the sign. She added
that both she and Dean Marshall Smith support
the idea of having another women's lavatory.
"If people are willing to turn urinals into flower
pots, it's fine with me," Gaddy said.

Dorm reps are off and running
The ASSU's dorm representative system began
its second year of operation last night with an
organizational meeting addressing the purpose
and responsibilities of dorm reps.
Freshmen dominated the gathering of about
50 students in the ASSU's office. Each of the
four COP members took several minutes to speak
about what role they expect the dorm represen
tatives to play this year.
According to COP member David Brown, the
dorm representative system was created last year
in order to facilitate interaction between the
ASSU and students. The COP instituted the sys
tem as part of its overall plan to make the ASSU
more active.
COP member Aimee Allison went on to state
that representatives will be responsible for dis
seminating information about ASSU activities
and helping the COP members gauge student
reaction.
Solina Kwan, a former representative and now
a member of the ASSU Senate, said that the
dorm representative system is "an opportunity
for the student government to reach out to stu
dents and make their position really mean some
thing."

Red Cross asks for relief funds
The Palo Alto Area Chapter of American Red
Cross is sending out an urgent plea for funds to
help families left in the wake of Hurricane Hugo.
Initial estimates reveal it will cost the Red
Cross at least $42 million to aid the hurricane
victims. The response will be the single most
costly disaster relief effort in the organization's
108-year history, said spokesperson Susan Shaw.
About 100,000 families have been affected by
the storm.
Interested in helping? Send your check, marked
"Hurricane Relief," to the American Red Cross
at 400 Mitchell Lane, Palo Alto, Calif. 94301.

Red Cross asks for relief funds
The Palo Alto Area Chapter of American Red
Cross is sending out an urgent plea for funds to
help families left in the wake of Hurricane Hugo.
Initial estimates reveal it will cost the Red
Cross at least $42 million to aid the hurricane
victims. The response will be the single most
costly disaster relief effort in the organization's
108-year history, said spokesperson Susan Shaw.
About 100,000 families have been affected by
the storm.

Job possibilities to be offered
It's not too soon for seniors and others to start
the inevitable job hunt, as Career Faire '89 will
be held in White Plaza (or in the Inner Quad in
case of rain) on Friday from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m.
Over 151 employers, including businesses, gov
ernment agencies and public-interest organiza
tions will attend the fair. The annual event is
designed to give students and employers an in
formal opportunity to discuss general career op
portunities as well as specific information about
each organization.
This year's Career Faire will be "the largest
ever held at Stanford," according to Yolanda
Morales, coordinator of recruitment activities for
the fair, which is sponsored by the Career Plan
ning and Placement Center.
"Diversity in career opportunities has ex
panded, and these organizations want to see Stan
ford students at all levels, from freshmen to
Ph.D.s," she said.
Twenty-nine percent of this year's fair partic
ipants will be public service organizations, the
highest percentage ever. The fair will be divided
into liberal arts, technical and public serv
ice/education areas.
Career Faire '89 will also include for the first
time a breakfast with employers for Stanford
students with disabilities. The breakfast will be
held from 8:30 to 9:30 a.m. in the Cypress Room
of Tresidder Union.
Career Faire '89 will be open to all Stanford
students. A list of organizations at the fair can
be picked up at the CPPC through Friday, and
maps of the fair will be available at the CPPC
information booths at both ends of White Plaza
the day of the event.

Equal bathroom rights for all
It's a sensitive situation.
Students in the School of Education have
formed a new coalition called CESS POOL —
the Coalition for Equity for Stanford Students:
Program for Objective Organization of
Lavatories.
It seems that the Cubberley Building, which
houses the school, features three public
bathrooms for men but only one for women.
Furthermore, about 65 percent of the school's
students are female, according to Anne Gaddy,
associate dean for administration.
Coalition members said complaints of the in
equity have been filed time and again in recent
years, but no action has been taken. Gaddy said
converting a bathroom from male to female would
cost the University about $8,000.
So last week, CESS POOL members took the
matter into their own hands and converted one

men's bathroom to a women's by changing the
sign on the door — a less expensive remedy.
Two days later, according to a press release,
"the new sign was forcibly removed." CESS
POOL then purchased a second sign stating that
the bathroom is for "Women" only.
Gaddy said the school's administration was not
responsible for removing the sign. She added
that both she and Dean Marshall Smith support
the idea of having another women's lavatory.
"If people are willing to turn urinals into flower
pots, it's fine with me," Gaddy said.

Dorm reps are off and running
The ASSU's dorm representative system began
its second year of operation last night with an
organizational meeting addressing the purpose
and responsibilities of dorm reps.
Freshmen dominated the gathering of about
50 students in the ASSU's office. Each of the
four COP members took several minutes to speak
about what role they expect the dorm represen
tatives to play this year.
According to COP member David Brown, the
dorm representative system was created last year
in order to facilitate interaction between the
ASSU and students. The COP instituted the sys
tem as part of its overall plan to make the ASSU
more active.
COP member Aimee Allison went on to state
that representatives will be responsible for dis
seminating information about ASSU activities
and helping the COP members gauge student
reaction.
Solina Kwan, a former representative and now
a member of the ASSU Senate, said that the
dorm representative system is "an opportunity
for the student government to reach out to stu
dents and make their position really mean some
