Responding to student demands for smaller classes
and higher-paid graduate instructors, the University
has increased the budget for teaching assistants in
the School of Humanities and Sciences by 8 percent
for this year.
Dean of Humanities and Sciences Ewart Thomas
told a small group of graduate and undergraduate
students representing the ASSU Committee on De
mocracy in Education Sept. 14 that he planned to
increase funding for TAs by $260,000.
Part of the new funds will be used to train new
TAs and to hire more for all departments in the
School of Humanities and Sciences.
The increased hiring should help decrease average
class section size. Last year, the School of Human
ities and Sciences operated with approximately 60
fewer TAs than normal because of a freeze in the
TA budget that amounted to a 6 percent cut from
the previous year's budget after cost-of-living in
creases, Thomas said.
Angered by the freeze, last spring a coalition of
graduate and undergraduate students surveyed TAs
and students on what they believe should be the
University's top priorities. Most responded that they
were concerned that teaching at Stanford had been
neglected in favor of research.
Backed by results of these surveys that indicated
TAs ranked third — to scholarships and University
housing — in importance to students, the movement
gained momentum. Coalition leaders met with
Thomas several times to discuss the problem.
Thomas said he worked with a group called the
TA Study Group that consisted of faculty, staff and
students, including members of CODE and Council
of Presidents member David Brown.
"We had a couple of productive meetings" with
the group, Thomas said.
The Office of the Dean of Humanities and
Sciences, however, never officially announced the
increase in funding.
"I felt there was a little more press (last year)
than was needed," Thomas said. "It's not something
we normally would announce."
Reaction to the increase by students who had
pushed for the changes has been for the most part
positive.
"It's a victory for the students in that it showed
we had faith in our ability to make a difference
and improve our education," history graduate stu-
