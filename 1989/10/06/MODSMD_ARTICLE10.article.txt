# Fuentes lauds 'polyculturalism'

### Cecilia Tom 
"The novel is the language of
imagination," said Mexico's
leading novelist and critic Carlos
Fuentes in a speech last night in
a packed Kresge Auditorium.
A novelist's job, as Fuentes said
he sees it, is to employ a
"knowledge-imagination
language" complex to explore
"human possibility in history." He
said he believes that ultimately a
writer can affect social values and
bring about growth, democracy
and justice by creating a critical
society that is no longer passive
or uninvolved.
"The imagination of the future
is related to the imagination of
the past," he said. "We can't sep
arate what we are able to imagine
from what we can remember."
Fuentes also stressed the im
portance of "polyculturalism" and
interaction in enhancing cultural
continuity. The novel gives a cul
ture identity by asking questions
about "nomination and voice,
memory and desire," he said.
Fuentes was introduced as a
versatile writer who had won in
ternational acclaim by exploring
complex human themes and writ
ing styles. In 1984, he received

1 only make love in
Spanish. There's so
much more to be said
in it:

the National Prize in Literature,
Mexico's highest literary award,
and in 1988 he received the
Miguel de Cervantes Prize in
Madrid.
Fuentes began writing in the
early 19505, at a time when the
novel as a form of writing was
said to be dead. He told the au
dience that he felt "rushed and
mutilated" in many ways because
society seemed to be dominated
by movies, journalism, or other
modes of communication.
There was much information,
but very little knowledge, he said.
With a great urge to write, he
sought answers to the question
of what a novel could say that no
other medium could. According to
Fuentes, the potentiality of the
novel stems from the "geography
of novel," novelists all over the
world who share a same "verbal
imagination."
Most of Fuentes' novels are in

his native Spanish. "I only make
love in Spanish," he said. "There's
so much more to be said in it."
Fuentes said he believes that
the main motivation of many
Hispanic writers is to articulate
their tradition, to find a time and
a space for their words. "The
knowledge in a novel is based on
imagination; it requires language
to become literature," he said.
Fuentes signed autographs for
his admirers after the program.
He told The Daily that he was
overwhelmed by the attentiveness
of the audience and delighted with
the warm reception he received.
Ten of Fuentes' novels have
been published in this country,
including "The Death of Artemio
Cruz," "A Change of Skin" and
"The Old Gringo." He has taught
in various universities, the
most recent being Princeton,
Dartmouth, Washington Univer
sity in St. Louis, Harvard and
Cornell.
Fuentes' visit was sponsored by
the Adviser to the President for
Chicano Affairs, the Americas
Program, Residential Education,
Campus Affairs, the Humanities
Center, Latin American Studies
and the Spanish and Portuguese
Department.
