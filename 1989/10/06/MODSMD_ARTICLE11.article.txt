# Schwartz issues statement:
## No intervention for Jackson 
### John Wagner Editorial staff 
University Vice President and
General Counsel John Schwartz
said yesterday that the University
will not intervene in the court
case of Louis Jackson.
In a written statement,
Schwartz reaffirmed the Univer
sity's commitment to its Policy on
Arrests and Prosecutions, which
states that the University never
intervenes in the criminal cases
of students.
Jackson, a junior, is facing six
misdemeanor charges — including
incitement to riot and battery —
in connection with the May 15
takeover of University President
Donald Kennedy's office.
Schwartz's statement came in
response to various requests from

the community, including a Daily
editorial and a petition drive by
students calling on Kennedy to
intercede.
Schwartz's statement appears
on page 4.
Jackson is the only student in
volved with the protest who is
being charged with battery and
incitement to riot. Fifty-three of
the protesters involved in the
takeover were sentenced to 40
hours of community service and
probation Wednesday on the
charge of trespassing. The cases
of four other protesters, who have
been charged with obstructing the
duties of a police officer, are still
pending. Those students will enter
pleas today.
The police report that impl
icates Jackson for inciting to riot
also notes that several other pro

testers were inciting the crowd,
but does not mention them by
name.
Due to Jackson's distinction,
members of the Agenda for Action
coalition, the group which staged
the takeover, have charged that
Jackson, who is black, is the vic
tim of a "selective prosecution"
with "ugly racial overtones."
In his statement, Schwartz
questioned that claim: "In the
present case, supporters of Mr.
Jackson claim he has been singled
out for prosecution. We are not
aware of any evidence to support
that view. If such evidence exists,
it may be a proper part of his
defense, and all those with rele
vant knowledge should make it
available to his attorney."
Jackson returns to court on
Oct. 12 for a pre-trial hearing.
