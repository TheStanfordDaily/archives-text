## Costa Rican embassy taken over

SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP)
â€” Twenty relatives of political prisoners
and "disappeared" people stormed the
Costa Rican Embassy and seized 19
hostages Thursday to protest against
Salvadoran President Alfredo Cristiani's
rightist government.
"We are here to denounce human
rights violations and so that the Costa
Rican government pressures Cristiani
to end the repression against the
people," a spokeswoman for the mostly
women activists said in an interview.
Reports conflicted on whether the ac
tivists were armed.
Special National Police units sur
rounded the six-story Central American
Building, but no violence was reported.
The embassy is on the third floor.
Costa Rican Ambassador Jesus
Manuel Fernandez told The Associated
Press by telephone from the embassy
that he asked military authorities at
the scene to lift the cordon around the
building. He said his request was being
considered. Monsignor Arturo Rivera
Damas, the Roman Catholic archbishop
of San Salvador, entered the embassy
shortly after nightfall, presumably
trying to resolve the standoff.
Consul General Humberto Murillo
and First Secretary Rene Aldama also

were held. Most other hostages were
people visiting the embassy on business.
Fifteen journalists and five people from
the Green Cross, a local first aid group,
also were inside but not considered
hostages.
Red Cross personnel took sandwiches
to those inside.
Fernandez, who has a heart condition,
said he was "fine ... I have been
brought my medicine, and the Red Cross
doctor examined me." He said there
were 20 demonstrators, most of them
women.
Fernandez said earlier some demon
strators were armed, but he did not
identify the weapons.
Reporters said they saw a handgun
tucked into the waistband of at least
one young man who stormed the mis
sion. They also said demonstrators
carried newspaper-wrapped packets
that appeared to have a fuse.
Government spokesman Mauricio
Sandoval told reporters the takeover
was "an act of provocation" but was
being dealt with "calmly, so no one gets
hurt."
The activists' spokeswoman, who
refused to give her name, said they had
no weapons.
The spokeswoman said the activists

belonged to The Federation of Commit
tees of Mothers and Relatives of Polit
ical Prisoners, Disappeared and Assas
sinated People of El Salvador. She said
they planned to stay at the embassy
until its demands were met.
The Federation of Committees for the
past eight years has protested the kid
napping and killing of suspected leftists
by rightist death squads.
"It is very sad that there are people
who believe that violence can be the
good instrument to get what they want,"
said President Oscar Arias of Costa Rica
when informed of the embassy takeover.
Arias, winner of the 1987 Nobel Peace
Prize for devising a Central American
peace plan, spoke at a news conference
in San Jose, Calif., where he was visit
ing. He said he would return home if
the situation grew worse.
In San Jose, Costa Rica, Foreign Min
istry spokesman Dino Starcewic said,
"Shortly after midday, a woman em
ployee at the embassy called us to say
that a group of attackers had seized the
embassy and taken people hostage, and
that they are heavily armed, with rifles
and even hand grenades."
The activists went past security
guards pretending they wanted to apply
for visas to go to Costa Rica.
