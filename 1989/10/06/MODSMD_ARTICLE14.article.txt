arrested 99 people, but clashes kept up
and reporters saw additional arrests.
No injuries were reported immediately.

break up the groups.
On Oct. 5, 1988, voters rejected a
proposal that Pinochet, who seized

power in a 1973 coup, remain president
until 1997. The result obliged the right
wing military president to call elections,
now scheduled for Dec. 14.
Police estimated more than 1,000
people took part in Thursday's protests.
Skirmishes persisted for hours.
Police said 15 bombs exploded Wed
nesday night, causing a brief electrical
blackout along a 1,370-mile stretch of
the narrow country, including Santiago,
the capital city where more than 4 mil
lion of Chile's 12 million people reside.
Targets included eight high-voltage
power towers, five bank branches and
two campaign offices of the pro
government presidential candidiate,
former Finance Minister Hernan Buchi.
No one claimed responsibility. Leftist
extremist groups frequently have
toppled electrical towers as part of a
campaign to undermine the Pinochet
government.
