# Hungary congress heats up

BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) — Commu
nist reformers and orthodox Marxists
traded charges and threats Thursday as
they prepared for what could be the most
turbulent and important party congress in
41 years of Communist power here.
Recent commitments by reform-minded
Communist leaders to democracy, a market
economy and international human rights
have put Hungary on the forefront of
liberalism within the Soviet bloc.
But they have resulted in growing
polarization within the party, and conser
vatives have said they will seek to oust
reformist leaders at the congress that opens

Friday. •
A groundswell of sentiment against
reform and a return to Marxist orthodoxy
would in turn doom plans for free elections,
agreed to by Communists leaders and the
political opposition.
The reformers want to cleanse the com
mmunist Hungarian Socialist Workers
Party of orthodox elements and do not dis
count a split if that proves impossible.
They also favor changing the party's
name — some suggest calling it the Hun
garian Socialist Party or the Socialist Dem
ocratic Union. Conservatives vehemently
oppose removing all reference to Workers.
