Communists egg Disney president
PARIS (AP) — President Michael Eisner of
Walt Disney Co. was pelted with eggs and ketchup
by Young Communists when he arrived at the
Paris stock exchange Thursday to announce the
sale of stock in the new European Disneyland.
The Young Communists, some sporting masks
of Disney characters, were protesting government
spending on park-related public works.
EuroDisneyland SCA, the company building
the park outside Paris, said it plans to raise $970
million on European stock exchanges.
When Eisner and EuroDisneyland President
Robert Fitzpatrick showed up at the exchange in
cars driven by people in Mickey Mouse and Pluto
outfits, they confronted banners reading, "Uncle
Scrooge Go Home."
The Communist Party's youth organization
issued a statement condemning the park a3 part
of a "feeble subculture" and said the $6.4 billion
in government spending on it should go instead
to schools or unemployment relief.
Senate votes to defend flag
WASHINGTON (AP) - The Senate on Thurs
day overwhelmingly approved a statutory ban on
defacing the American flag after defeating a pro
posed revision that sponsors said could prove
fatal in a future court test.
President Bush said he respected "the inten
tion" but would continue to push for a consti
tutional amendment instead.
The 91-9 final vote came after maneuvering

by Senate Republicans, who say along with Bush
that amending the Constitution rather than pass
ing a simple statute is the only effective way to
counter last June's Supreme Court decision
throwing out a Texas flag-burning law.
The bill, which previously passed the House
but now returns there for consideration of Senate
changes, calls for up to a $1,000 fine and a year
in jail for burning or otherwise defacing the flag.
Both houses are to consider a proposed amend
ment to the Constitution later this month.
The Democrats say they have carefully worded
their bill to protect it against an expected new
court challenge on free-speech grounds.
Hunger striker harassed
PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) — Eight armed
men in civilian clothes fired in the air outside
the office where opposition leader Guillermo En
dara was on a hunger strike Thursday, dispersing
scores of supporters gathered outside.
Some of the gunmen entered Endara's office
and took his secretary with them, but the sec
retary was later released.
"At 4 p.m. armed civilians came and fired in
the air," Endara told journalists after the eight
gunmen left. "It was if they were invisible because
the police (directing traffic at a nearby corner)
did nothing."
The former opposition presidential candidate
said he would continue his 16-day-old hunger
strike as part of a campaign to oust Gen. Manuel
Antonio Noriega.
