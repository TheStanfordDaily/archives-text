# Law threatens space shuttle flight
## 
### 
CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)
— NASA starts the countdown
Monday, but Thursday's launch
of the space shuttle Atlantis
depends on whether a federal
judge permits its five astronauts
to dispatch the nuclear-powered
Galileo probe to Jupiter.
Anti-nuclear activists have sued
to halt the flight, arguing that a
launch accident could spread ra
dioactive plutonium over densely
populated parts of Florida. The
space agency maintains the dan
ger is almost non-existent.
Both sides will argue their cases
in U.S. District Court in Wash
ington, D.C., at 10 a.m. Tuesday.
Judge Oliver Gasch then will
decide whether to grant a tempo
rary restraining order to stop the
launch, or to let the countdown
proceed. This is the first time
anyone has gone to court to stop
a NASA launch.
The plutonium argument over
shadows the fact that the mission
involves the most expensive, most
sophisticated unmanned space
probe ever built, a vehicle one
mission official calls "the Rolls-
Royce of spacecraft."
After a six-year outward jour
ney, Galileo, priced at $1.4 billion,
is to shoot a probe into Jupiter's
atmosphere and then orbit the
planet for two years.
Mission planners say its inves

tigation of Jupiter and its moons
will be the most scientifically rich
that interplanetary exploration
has witnessed. The 1979 Voyager
views of Jupiter and its satellites
were fascinating, but Galileo's
images will be 1,000 times clearer,
they say.
The countdown is to start at 8
a.m. Monday. If Gasch does not
rule quickly, the count will pause
at the 11-hour mark, for several
days if necessary, awaiting a de
cision. Several critical steps, in
cluding fueling the shuttle, occur
after that point.
If Gasch gives the green light,
and no other problems arise, At
lantis is scheduled to blast off at
1:29 p.m. Thursday.
The activists vow that if they
lose in court, they will physically
try to stop the liftoff.
"We are going to attempt to
enter the launch area and sit on
the launch pad," said Bruce Gag
non, coordinator for the Florida
Coalition of Peace and Justice,
one of three groups that filed the
suit.
Extra security measures have
been in force several days, includ
ing closing to the public several
roads approaching Kennedy Space
Center. These roads are normally
closed only on launch days.
NASA officials are concerned
that Thursday's brief, 10-minute

launch window would vanish if
protesters penetrate the launch
zone with a boat or plane in the
count's final minutes.
At issue are Galileo's two gen
erators and their fuel: 48 pounds
of radioactive plutoi\ium-238
dioxide.
The activists say that if the
space shuttle crashed or exploded*
as the Challenger did in 1986, the
poisonous plutonium would be re
leased into the air.
NASA has said the "highest
probability of launch-area release
of plutonium due to a shuttle ac
cident is less than 1 in 2,500 and
such a release would have no ap
preciable adverse effects on the
population."
The agency quotes health phys
icists who say this type of
plutonium is relatively harmless
unless a particle is inhaled or
lodges in an open wound, where
it could cause cancer. Generally
the particles do not travel far in
air and can be stopped by a piece
of paper or unbroken human skin.
In tests, empty graphite
plutonium containers have been
blown up, shot at and burned to
determine how they survive all
types of accidents. They have
withstood pressures far greater
than those generated by the Chal
lenger explosion, say NASA and
the Energy Department.
