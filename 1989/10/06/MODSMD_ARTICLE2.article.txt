will not be possible without eco
nomic growth and stability.
He suggested that wealthy
lender nations have a responsibil
ity to help the progress of peace
by easing the demands placed
upon the economies of poorer
countries by tight loan repayment
schedules.
"It is not wrong, but right, that
allowances be made for poorer na
tions," Arias said. He stressed as
well the importance of both
greater access to foreign markets
and stable market prices in the
region's quest for economic and
political autonomy.
The president cited Costa Rica's
own efforts to promote economic
growth. "But," ne added, "we are
also committed to doing this in
our own time."
Costa Rica, which abolished its
army in 1948, has eryoyed uni
nterrupted democratic govern
ment for 100 years.
Arias, elected president in 1986,
entered the spotlight of interna
tional relations in 1987 when rep
resentatives of the five largest
Central American nations signed
the "Arias plan," calling for po
litical reform as well as an end
to hostilities in the region.
For his efforts toward peace in
Central America, Arias was
awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in
October 1987.
In his introduction of Arias,
Stanford Law School Dean Paul
Brest emphasized that a commit
tee of Stanford Law School facul

ty, chaired by Prof. William Gould,
had recommended Arias as the
recipient of the Ralston award al
most a week before his Nobel
prize was announced.
The Ralston prize, which in
cludes a cash award of $30,000,
is made "for original and distin
guished contribution to the devel
opment of the role of law in
international relations." The se
lection panel for the award in
cludes the University president,
the chief justice of the California
Supreme Court, and the
secretary »general of the United
Nations.
Arias is the fourth person ever
to be honored with the award.
Past recipients are Prime Minister
Olof Palme of Sweden, Ambassa
dor Tommy T.B. Koh of Singapore
and former U.S. President Jimmy
Carter.
Arias, who spoke for almost 40
minutes, reflected upon issues he
felt were integral not only to the
peace of Central America, but also
to the peaceful future of the entire
international community. Arias
decried the "arms race" in the
region, caused in large part by
what he called "an East-West con
frontation" between the United
States and the Soviet Union.
Arias challenged the audience,
"Let anyone stand up in this room
and say without hesitation" what
good such armed conflict has
achieved "in my tortured Central
America." However, Arias com
mended the progress made in the
last three years, saying, "The bal
ance in Central America has been
tipped in favor of freedom, de
mocracy and peace."
