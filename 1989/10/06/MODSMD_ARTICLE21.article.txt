Ancient library system
will finally be replaced
by advanced system

IT'S BAD ENOUGH to have to
carry 10 books home from the
library in your backpack. But,
it's even worse when you have to
fill out 10 little cards for the
privilege of getting a backache on
the bike ride home.
A recently announced plan to im
plement an Automated Circulation
I System in the University's 17 li
l braries would use a computer scan
* ner to read bar codes on books and
- student identification cards.
* Stanford is one of the few uni
versities in the nation that has yet
to convert to a computerized or
* electronic book-loaning procedure.
* The new system would save time
'I and paper for students and library
i employees.
* r Another step towards moderniz
i ing the library system is the con

version of the card catalog system
to the Socrates computer catalog
system.
A comprehensive computer cat
alog system will make the some
what intimidating scope of the
library system's roughly 5,740,162
volumes accessible to all at the
push of a button or two. By com
bining data on books of all years,
all subjects and all libraries, the
system will eliminate the need to
dash back and forth between libra
ries or drawers in the card catalog.
The transfer to Socrates, which
began in 1987, is expected to be
complete in four years. The
Automated Circulation System is
still a vision, though David Weber,
director of University Libraries,
said he expects the system to be
in place in three or four years.
This imminent completion of the
computer catalog system should be
a cue to go ahead with the moder
nization of the book-loaning pro
cedure.
Now all you need is a computer
that can carry the books home for
you.
