■* The opening of the University's
overseas campus in Kyoto, Japan
and the announced Latin American
program in Santiago, Chile reflect
- the multiculturalism that Stanford
\ is striving to achieve.
* Traditionally, Europe was the
- place to go when college students
* planned to study abroad. Stan
* ford's other seven overseas cam
puses are all located in Europe.
Likewise, until recently most
university curricula was Eurocen
tric and based mainly on the West
ern roots of American heritage.
But a growing movement on col
lege campuses is promoting an em

phasis on all the world's cultures
and an increasing awareness of the
non-Western heritage of the
United States.
Last year, the replacement of the
Western Culture requirement with
the Cultures, Ideas and Values pro
gram hinted at Stanford's commit
ment to multicultural education.
The creation of overseas studies
centers outside of Europe further
illustrates this commitment.
Kyoto and Santiago are a good
start. But there are still significant
areas of the world unrepresented
by Overseas Studies. Programs in
areas such as Africa, the Middle
East or India would make Stan
ford's overseas opportunities more
well-rounded.
