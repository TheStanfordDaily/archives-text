## Campus bullied by radicals 
### 
AS THE SCHOOL YEAR begins and
a new class begins to educate itself
in the ways of Stanford, the inci
dents of last spring will inevitably be
rehashed, reinterpreted and celebrated.
University President Donald Kennedy's
advice in his welcoming address to in
coming frosh and transfer students to
have a "healthy mistrust" of the conven
tional wisdom is thus essential for the
new members of the Stanford community
to consider.
I did not attend Kennedy's address and
do not know its specifics, but The Daily's
skeptical response to his message only
underscores the thrust of his speech: Do
not be won over simply by the loudest
voices.
Authority at Stanford now resides with
the campus's radical left wing — it is
the new thought police, dictating "cor
rect" student politics and intimidating
dissenters.
While The Daily is the most reflective
and balanced of the groups that make
up the power structure, it also has a
stake in the structure's continued
predominance hence its suspicious re
sponse to Kennedy's speech.
I did not hail the occupation of the
President's Office last spring as a glorious
triumph of student activism.
Rather, the occupation and subsequent
events struck me not only as bad politics,
but also as another indication that the
radical leftists on campus have succeeded
in becoming Stanford's loudest, shrewd
est propagandists.
I am apparently in the campus minority
in my disagreement with the Cultures,
Ideas and Values reform, the stated need

for a tenure-track position in Asian-
American studies and many of the goals
pushed by the Agenda for Action.
The vast mcyority of Stanford students
are intelligent enough to discard racist
and sexist ideas without having their
hands held and being told what courses
they must take.
But give the Agenda for Action credit.
They lobbied and fought hard for what
they believed to be right. Whether they
are right is irrelevant. In doing so, how
ever, they became the campus bully, the
800-pound gorilla of Stanford, the au
thority that Kennedy urged students to
question in his welcoming address four
years ago.
In the name of an atmosphere of free
and open discourse, they blocked a
campus speech by Contra leader Adolfo
Calero. Now, I'd like, to„see.

They attacked an administration that
had actively supported the overthrow of
Western Culture for foot-dragging on ed

enough to drown out anyone working

Then they really blew it. The protesters
embraced the spirit of the '60s as their

Instead, they just whined. I doubt that
Martin Luther King, Jr. would have been
proud of such cowardice.
The goal Louis Jackson expressed in
The Daily on Sept. 26, of "a society where
every human being has the capacity to
develop to her or his fullest potential,"
is the highest call that can be made to
the incoming Stanford students. But
those students must also feel free to dis
agree with the dominant view of how to
achieve such a goal while still sharing in
that ultimate aim.
