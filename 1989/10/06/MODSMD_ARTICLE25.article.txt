## University can't ignore policy rules for Jackson case 
### 
THE AUTHORS of the recent
petition "Equal Justice Under
the Law," the Oct. 3 Daily edito
rial "Justice for Jackson," as well as
Others in the Stanford community have
expressed various concerns about the
Louis Jackson case. These include
questions about Stanford's involvement
in the criminal proceedings to requests
that the University intervene now in
an effort to persuade the District
Attorney's Office to dismiss one or
more of the charges pending before the
court. In short, the University is being
asked, at the very least, to make an
exception to its Policy on Arrests and
Prosecutions in matters involving
campus arrests.
That policy, which has been in effect
since the early 19705, sets out the
many reasons for its adoption, and
need not be repeated here. For the
community's convenience, we are
republishing that document and urge
people to read it.
The policy itself has been, and is,
never to intervene in criminal cases,
either on behalf of its students (or
other members of this community) or
to urge prosecution. Claims made in
the petition that the University inter

vened in the 1971 Bazile case or the
1985 Perkins case are simply untrue.
The University is regularly urged to
depart from this policy — by parents,
students, alumni and others — usually
on the assertion that the charges are
unwarranted, unfair or selective. That
determination, however, is properly
made by judges and/or juries, based on
evidence and testimony produced in
court. If the University were to at
tempt to interfere or intervene with
public authorities, however, it would
abandon a consistent and principled
policy for one that is expedient, oppor
tunistic, and which would (ironically)
result in selective prosecution.
In the present case, supporters of
Jackson claim he has been singled out
for prosecution. We are not aware of
any evidence to support that view. If
such evidence exists, it may be a
proper part of his defense, and all
those with relevant knowledge should
make it available to his attorney.
It should be recognized, however,
that Stanford has assisted Jackson and
other students in areas where the
University could properly act. In Jack
son's case, he was not subject to spe
cial University penalties for his role in
the May 15 building occupation or in

the events outside; indeed, we pursued
a general policy of leniency with re
spect to all student protesters charged
with institutional misconduct, and did
not — as our disciplinary system
would have permitted — assess differ
ential sanctions against Jackson or the
other two students whose actions con
stituted a differing magnitude of mis
conduct. '
In addition, I briefed Mandy Mac-
Calla carefully on her options regard
ing the battery charge brought on her
behalf by the District Attorney's Office
against Jackson, with the result that
she consulted with his attorney and
signed a civil compromise agreement.
According to the law — Penal Code
sections 1377-1379 — it is now up to
the court to accept or reject that
privately reached agreement. (Contrary
to The Daily editorial, Ms. MacCalla's
compromise agreement did not say she
did not feel threatened by and has no
complaint against him. The agreement
is that she accepted Mr. Jackson's
apology as satisfaction for her iryury.)
The District Attorney's Office is
ultimately responsible for bringing
charges against individuals whose
conduct appears to have violated the
law. Sometimes, the officers at the

scene make an immediate judgment
that an arrest is appropriate; some
times, as in Jackson's case, the DA
issues an arrest warrant later, after
reviewing all the evidence — which, in
this instance, would have included the
videotape of the May 15 events.
In either situation, only the DA can,
and does, make the decision to initiate
or not initiate formal criminal proceed
ings. Of course, when submitting a
report of an incident that appears to a
police officer to be a chargeable of
fense, it is standard procedure for the
officer to recommend to the DA that a
charge be filed.
Stanford did not urge prosecution of
Jackson: The decision to prosecute
appears to have been made on the
basis of the reports and recommenda
tions of police officers who witnessed
events that appeared to them to con
stitute chargeable offenses, and the
supporting evidence they had amassed.
When the issue is, for instance,
whether the safety of the public, in
cluding the safety of country peace
offices, was threatened, the decision
clearly belongs solely to the District
Attorney's Office.
