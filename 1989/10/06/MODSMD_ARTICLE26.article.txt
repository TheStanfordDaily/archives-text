# Fraternity flier objectifies dead
## 
### 
We would like to express our disap
pointment with the recent flier for the
Alpha Epsilon Pi "Passion Night"
party. With the efforts of numerous
campus groups to combat harmful
stereotypes, it is unfortunate that AEir
chose to put a photo of a pouting,
sexually-available Marilyn Monroe on
their flier.
This, clearly, objectifies dead people.
By putting Monroe on their flier, the

Objectification of the
deceased is a phenome
non that is responsible for
most of the world's ills,
including war, frogs and
Detroit.

members of AEtt are saying that the
deceased are nothing more than objects
that can be tossed around like some
sort of cultural icon. Sure, she is

pretty much just lying around these
days, but by putting her on the flier
she is seen as a decoration instead of a
living, breathing dead person.
Objectification of the deceased is a
phenomenon that is responsible for
most of the world's ills, including war,
hunger, drought, blight, murder, frogs,
blood, death of the first-born male
child and Detroit.
We hope that in the future AEn will
think hard before slandering the dead.
