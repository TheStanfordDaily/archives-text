## Small-town code prevents hard-nosed reporting 
### 
I QUIT MY JOB this summer._l can't
really say my resignation was any
thing but a symbolic gesture of
protest, but I couldn't think of any other
way to get out of that mess.
I worked this summer in Lake Tahoe
as a reporter for a small weekly news
paper, one with a weekly circulation less
than one-third the size of this paper's
daily readership. Lake Tahoe, picturesque
and pristine, is small. That, in part, is
why I quit.
Small-town journalism is very different
from big-city journalism, and I don't
know if I can ever read a small-town
paper without taking the reports with a
little grain of salt. A small-town reporter
can't afford to anger any sources, because
that anger can come back later to haunt
the newspaper, both in the loss of
credibility and advertising dollars. The
goal of the paper, therefore, is to keep
people happy, and unpleasant news is not
always welcome.
Unfortunately, all news isn't pleasant.
I started investigating a report of sexual
abuse of children at Squaw Valley Ski
Corporation's day care center. The San
Jose Mercury News broke the story about
how two sets of parents thought their
children had been abused at the day care
center.
The day care center, operating without
the required license, had hired a convicted

killer to work with the children. The
popular ski corporation had also hired,
and later fired, two men who sang ofT
color songs to the children. The setting
could hardly have been better for a
molester.
One of the hardest phone calls I ever
made was to one abused child's mother,
who wanted to warn other parents of the
possibility that Squaw Valley's day care
center was harboring a pedophile. After
some time, the 3-year-old daughter —
who was in the room with the mother
— could sense we were talking about her
terrifying experience. "No mommy, no!"
the child yelled. "Don't tell!"
I quickly said goodbye. If I remember
correctly, I was shaking.
I called the Placer County sheriffs
spokesman, and he wasn't happy. The
story is an exaggeration, he told me. He
hedged my questions about the case, in
sisting again and again that the abuse
couldn't have happened at Squaw Valley.
The editor and the publisher of the
paper decided the story was too big for
me to handle alone, so they assigned
another reporter to help out. It was a
big mistake, and I only wish it had been
the biggest mistake they had made.
The other reporter was very friendly,
too friendly, to her sources. She greeted
sheriff's officers with hugs rather than
handshakes, she spoke in a friendly chill-

like tone to some of the town's most
important people and she had been
warned at least once by the paper that
she could be fired for such conduct.
Perhaps because she had only a few
more weeks in Tahoe before she was to
take another job, she ignored the warn
ings. And so, not to disappoint her friends
and perhaps because she really hoped the
abuse hadn't happened, the reporter sig
nificantly rewrote the article to discredit
the mother of the abused child.
She hid documents from me which she
had obtained, she was not forthright with
me and she limited my ability to speak
freely on the telephone.
The reporter would have been fired
instantly at most other newspapers.
Nevertheless, she stayed on the payroll.
The next week, I started to probe into

the sheriff's investigation of the abuse.
Three months after the first two reports
were filed, investigators had uncovered
nothing in the case. The mother of the
3-year-old girl said the sheriffs depart
ment had told her they were going to
close investigation of the case, before they
had tried to find other victims.
One-and-a-half weeks after the initial
appearance of the article, which seemed
to keep the investigation alive, the
sheriff's office finally mailed letters and
questionnaires to some of the parents
whose children had attended the day care
center. Only 100 of the thousands of par
ents who left their children at the center
received questionnaries.
The questionnaire read more like a
publicity tool of Squaw Valley than a
sheriffs investigation of a felony. The
questionnaire asked questions like, "Did
you enjoy your stay at Squaw Valley?"
and "Do you think you will go back next
year?" Only one question dealt with pos
sible abuse, and only indirectly at that.
From all appearances, the sheriff's de
partment was helping to cover up details
of the case. I don't think money was
involved. There is something more subtle,
far more insidious, than money that
makes a cover-up work in a place like
Tahoe.
I might call it friendship, but it is more
encompassing than just that. Rather, it

is the small-town code of conduct that
governs every interaction that occurs in
the community. The code includes a sense
of cooperation, one that builds and binds
communities and creates the very fabric
of society.
But there is that flip side to the small
town code that I learned so well while I
was in Tahoe. For the community to hold
together, there has to be a trust in one's
neighbors — a trust that they will do no
wrong, a trust that everything will be
OK in the end.
It was that small-town code of trust
that led the sheriffs office to back off
the investigation. It was that small-town
code that led my fellow reporter to stab
me in the back. It was that same small
town code that led the publisher to refuse
to accept my story implicating some of
his Kiwanis Club buddies in the cover-up.
So, I quit my job, my small-town job.
I let a lot of people down, but I just
couldn't stomach it anymore. I refuse to
put up with that kind of conduct.
