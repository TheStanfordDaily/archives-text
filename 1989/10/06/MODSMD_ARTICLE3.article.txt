## Investigation of student injury underway 
### Jill Daniels Staff writer 
The Phi Delta Theta Fraternity has been
placed on social suspension pending the
results of an investigation of their account
ability in a recent accident.
A freshman hit by a pickup truck early

Jack Chin, residence dean for Branner.
The freshman, who was "heavily intox

Fraternal Affairs Adviser Michael Hughes

Chin said.

preparation, he added.
Hughes said he is working with Parker
Blackman, president of the Phi Delts, to
review how the party was managed.
"We're trying to move as quickly as pos

He added that it is unclear, at present,
who will pass final judgment. Currently,
Hughes is preparing a report that will be
reviewed by Conklin and Assoc. Deans of
Student Affairs Michael Jackson and Norm
Robinson.
At that time, "it will be determined
whether I or the Interfraternity Council
should handle the matter," Hughes said.
The Phi Delts received formal notifica

Blackman, explaining that the Phi Delts
are "not allowed to have functions at the
house or attend another function as a
