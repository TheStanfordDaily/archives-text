# Phi Delts suspended
## Investigation of student injury underway 
### Jill Daniels Staff writer 
The Phi Delta Theta Fraternity has been
placed on social suspension pending the
results of an investigation of their account
ability in a recent accident.
A freshman hit by a pickup truck early
Friday morning was walking home after
attending a Phi Delt party, according to
Jack Chin, residence dean for Branner.
The freshman, who was "heavily intox
icated" according to Stanford Police Cap
tain Marvin Moore, was hit at 1:12 a.m.
on Junipero Serra Boulevard near Campus
Drive East.
The student was hospitalized with minor
injuries and was released Sunday.
Director of the Row Diana Conklin and
Fraternal Affairs Adviser Michael Hughes
are "conducting an investigation as to the
circumstances surrounding the incident,"
Chin said.
"Whenever any organization throws any
kind of event, it always has some sort of

liability," Chin said. However, "it is too
early to even speculate" what would happen
if the fraternity is cited for irresponsible
preparation, he added.
Hughes said he is working with Parker
Blackman, president of the Phi Delts, to
review how the party was managed.
"We're trying to move as quickly as pos
sible, but we need to be as thorough as
possible," Hughes said.
He added that it is unclear, at present,
who will pass final judgment. Currently,
Hughes is preparing a report that will be
reviewed by Conklin and Assoc. Deans of
Student Affairs Michael Jackson and Norm
Robinson.
At that time, "it will be determined
whether I or the Interfraternity Council
should handle the matter," Hughes said.
The Phi Delts received formal notifica
tion of their suspension yesterday, said
Blackman, explaining that the Phi Delts
are "not allowed to have functions at the
house or attend another function as a
house."
"We're doing everything we can
to remedy the situation," Black
man said. "We're not happy we're
on social suspension, but then
again we're not happy someone
got hurt," Blackman said.
Blackman also said members
passed around a Froshbook and
did not recall seeing the freshman
at the party. He noted that there
were several other fraternity par
ties that night.
In three of the last four years,
the Phi Delts have been placed
on social probation during fall
quarter. In the most recent inci
dent, almost exactly a year ago,
the Phi Delts were placed on "in
definite social suspension" be
cause of a Kamikaze party that

the Dean of Student Affairs Office
said focused "wholly" on alcohol.
The suspension lasted from Oct.
6, 1988 to Jan. 19, 1989, when
the Phi Delts were again allowed
to hold social events after submit
ting a report to then-Fraternal
Affairs Adviser Joe Pisano outlin
ing a plan to make their parties
safer.
Last year's Phi Delt President
Russell Pangborn said in January,
"We know that we have a history
to make up f0r.... The University
is becoming intolerant of us, and
it has been implied that if there
are any more problems, we may
lose the house. . . . We know
they're not going to give us any
more chances."
But Blackman said the Phi
Delts are "absolutely not" worried
about losing their house.
Conklin agreed it was too early
to speculate about possible
penalties for the fraternity.
