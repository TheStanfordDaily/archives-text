Want a recipe for a fun, irreverent, and
wacky dessert for your ears? Just take four
lefties, three Libras, two vegetarians, a Milli
Vanelli wanna-be and a redhead, and add five
brand-new, equally distinctive individuals and
season to taste. According to this diverse
group, just a sample will convince you that
you have found the perfect temptation for
your ears — Mixed Company.
Their humor, wild posters, and spur-of-the
moment performances have made this 16-
member coed a cappella singing group one of
the hottest and most well-received groups on
campus.
Their style is an attempt to "popularize a
cappella music for the general audience," ac
cording to their music director, Greg Martin.
This effort includes a repertoire of David
Bowie, ELO, the Eagles, James Brown, the
Jackson 5 and the Beatles.
But fans of Mixed Company contend the
real magic of the group comes from its fun
loving style of performances, which utilize
jokes and stories as introductions to their
musical numbers. Second-year member Rich
Ellinger, a sophomore, described the process
of choosing these humorous interludes as ex
periments in which a joke's flop means that
the other members can be "smug about it
later."
Group members say this comfortable,
family-like, put-your-feet-on-the-coffee-table

atmosphere is what distinguishes Mixed
Company from many other campus groups.
Ellinger said, "As a group, we spend more
time than any other group 'just hanging out
together.' " Martin, also a second-year mem
ber, agreed with Ellinger, adding that the
time spent together is "frightening."
In fact, "frightening" is what you might
think if you have seen their latest wave of
publicity in the form of "bad guy" posters.
Mixed Company hopes, however, that after
people hear them sing, the objects in the
pictures will seem, as the poster warns, "nicer
than they appear."
This "frightening" poster certainly did not
scare away prospective Mixed Company mem
bers. Auditions were held last week and the
competition was intense: 104 students audi
tioned for only five spots in the group.
Martin, a sophomore, said that he is really
happy with the new talent that was welcomed
into the group on a retreat to San Mateo last
weekend. This retreat gave the new members
the opportunity to get acquainted and to begin
learning the many songs that make up Mixed
Company's repertoire of pop and classic rock
fitted to a capella form.
Mixed Company has not always enjoyed such
popularity, however. It began in the minds of
a few students in 1985 who, seeing no coed
a cappella singing groups on campus, decided
to start one of their own.
Graduate Bonnie Zare, a sophomore in 1985,
organized a meeting for "all those interested

in forming a coed singing group." Gina
DeLuca, also a sophomore at the time, went
to the meeting after having been denied mem
bership in the all-male Fleet Street singing
group. Zare, DeLuca and friend Fritz Stewart
formed the nucleus of what was to soon be
come Mixed Company.
When searching for a name to reflect their
unique coed status, "The name Mixed Com
pany came completely out of the blue," DeLuca
said, "but we liked it and it stuck."
The beginnings were somewhat rocky for
the group, as rehearsals for the 16-member
group often "turned out to be only four or
so people," DeLuca said. "I think the first
time that all 16 members showed up was at
our first concert."
This first concert, held at Soto in the spring
1986, was very well received, according to the
group's members. In autumn 1986, Mixed
Company became much more organized, with
set rehearsal times, auditions and a tradition
of Wednesday night dorm meeting shows. They
began to acquire a group of fans who enjoyed
what DeLuca described as the "crazy, fun
loving style of the group" and they were well
on their way to campus success.
They went on their first spring-break tour
in 1988. Mixed Company brought their dis
tinctive blend of a cappella music to 12 East
Coast states in 11 days, adding a St. Louis
detour on the way home.
Faced with such success, Mixed Company
cut their first album that same year. It was
called "The Loudest Voice Wins," a title that
senior Jenny Wolsk, a former Mixed Company
member, attributed to the strong soloists in
the group at that time. This album featured
such hits as "Road to Nowhere," "She Blinded
Me With Science" and "Leland's Island." It
sold more than 500 tapes on campus and on
tour.
Since this breakthrough in popularity,
Mixed Company has continued to prosper.
They are now beginning their fifth year, arid
they will be recording their second album this
winter. Ellinger, the recordings supervisor for
the group, said that the tapes will be released
in time for their spring break tour which is,
as yet, "unspecified."
Mixed Company is a completely student-run
organization with specific offices and titles,
yet members said that they utilize a very
democratic method of song selection. Any
group member can nominate a song for group
consensus as to whether "it is cool or not,"
according to Ellinger.
Once a song is chosen, one member of the
group arranges it for four-part harmony. Mar
tin said that they do not always try to recreate
the song exactly, but instead prefer to add
distinctive touches of their own. He jokingly
added that they "use a little discretion, but
not too much."
Students at dorm meetings this year will
have the opportunity to experience the fourth
year of Mixed Company's Wednesday night
performances. They can also catch them at
University events and off-campus shows which
can be scheduled through Business Manager
Liz Noteware at 323-9536.
