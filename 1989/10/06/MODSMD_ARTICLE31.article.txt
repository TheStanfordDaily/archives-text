# Campus escort service offers a safe lift back to the dorm
## 
### Dan Sommerfield 
Fifteen years ago, anyone who wanted
to walk on campus at night would have
had only two options: walk with friends
or aquaintances, or walk completely
alone. These days, as many people know,
there exists another alternative — the
SURE escort service.
SURE, which stands for Stanford
United for Rape Elimination, first ap
peared in 1978. The purpose behind its
founding and operation has always been
simple: to provide a safe walk home for
students.
The service, which receives around 10-
13 calls a night, operates with three em
ployees per shift and two golf carts. One
SURE worker, the shift coordinator,
stays behind in the office to answer calls
and coordinate pick-ups while the other
workers provide the actual transport
across campus. According to SURE co
directors Geoff Hoefer and Todd White,
the golf carts can easily handle most calls
received. The co-directors said it is their
goal to guarantee service within five
minutes, as they are afraid that if they
tell someone, "We'll be there in fifteen
minutes," the person might decide
against using SURE and walk home
alone.
Until as recently as two years ago,
SURE was confined to a small, obscure
office behind the Women's Center near
Toyon Hall. Such a non-central location
made it extremely difficult to dispatch
SURE escorts to the farther reaches of
campus within the promised five
minutes. These days, the SURE office is
on the second floor of Tresidder Union,
right next to the ASSU's Student Organ
ization Services.
The SURE co-directors said they en
joyed the benefit of being funded by SOS.
Their funding represents part of the
"extra services" (about $27) that appears
on every student's bill each quarter. This
money allows SURE to purchase golf
carts to speed service, pay its employees,
and take care of any other expenses they
may have.
Hoefer, who is the director of SURE's
publicity and finances, said publicity an
nouncing SURE's presence has improved
greatly over the years. Still, he com
plained, too few people knew about the
service even last year. With this in mind,
Hoefer and other SURE employees spent
most of last spring and this year's ori
entation spreading the word about the
service. Apparently the effort has been
fairly successful, as an ASSU poll last
spring revealed that 95 percent of female
undergraduates know about SURE.
Despite this recent success, however,
Hoefer is still working hard to ensure

We feel that if SURE's
presence on campus is
overwhelming, it would
be a significant deter
rent to any attacks on
campus.'

that 100 percent of female students know
how to use the escort service. He hopes
that, through a combination of flyers,
phone stickers and bright, glow-in-the
dark whistles bearing SURE's name and
number, everyone will learn about the
program.
Another plan lined up for this year is
the installation of a sophisticated two
way radio communications system. White
explained, "The communication system
was kind of my brain child — I thought
it would be more efficient and would
improve the service dramatically to have
an advanced communication system
similar to (those used by) the police."
Both White and Hoefer agree that such
a system would make it much easier for
an escort to reach a caller faster. For
example, if a call came in requesting an
escort from Wilbur Hall to the Medical
Center, the office could contact a golf
cart that might be heading from Green
Library to Escondido Village, and give it
the new assignment. The cart would then
pick up the person waiting at Wilbur on
its way back from Escondido. Under the
present system, the cart would have to
travel all the way back to the office in
Tresidder, get the assignment and then
trek right back to Wilbur to pick up the
next person.
The communication system could also
alleviate the strain of being bombarded
by too many calls at once. "One of the
problems of the service is that we only
have three people working (at any one
time)," explained White. "If 13 calls come
within five minutes, there's not much we
can do."
Except in the last few years, SURE
has been run exclusively by volunteers.
The recent change to paid employees has
generated some controversy, since paid
workers may take the job simply for the
cash. Hoefer said he felt this isn't the
case, and added that the change helps
employees consider SURE a "serious job,"

rather than something to do just when
they feel like it.
In addition, the transition to paid em
ployees has allowed many students who
are extremely interested in SURE, but
who otherwise wouldn't have the time,
to participate without holding another
job. According to Joel Severson, a new
SURE worker, "I became really interested
in the subject of rape, and (wanted to)
get involved in campus projects dealing
with it. I was looking for a way of being
active, and that I could do this and also
earn money was a godsend."
Damon Whitsitt, a shift coordinator,
agreed with this philosophy: "I had heard
about [SURE] from someone who was
working there. It sounded like a really
good service to provide something differ
ent, and it's a service that needs to be
provided."
"At first I needed a job," Whitsitt said,
"but I do have a problem with working
at something that's (not) meaningful to
me." He said he realized the best aspect
of SURE when he wasn't working: "Un
like working in the bookstore, here you
come home after work and really feel
good about what you've done, which to
me is very important."
The availability of the service has been
established; a question students might
have, however, is whether a "safe"
campus like Stanford really provides
enough demand for it. Hoefer insisted
that there is indeed such a demand, and
cited the annual student vote on ASSU
project funding as proof of this. According
to him, SURE receives "overwhelming
support" each year in the polls.
White, who has held some position in
SURE for the last three years, said,
"From the time that I started working,
the business increased about 200 per
cent." Business, he said, has increased
from a maximum of three calls a night
to the average of about thirteen calls on
heavy nights.
White also offered the little known fact
that, although SURE's publicity is aimed
almost exclusively at women, the program
is actually open to anyone. "We never
turn anyone down," he said, although he
is somewhat dismayed by the fact that
many of SURE's male clients misuse the
service. "In my experience," he said, "90
percent of the men who called just didn't
want to walk."
SURE's relationship with other campus
support groups has improved greatly
since its inception. When the service first
appeared, it was disliked by women's
groups on campus, who accused SURE
of being nothing but a "bunch of macho
men" escorting "frail, defenseless"
women around campus. Now SURE, the

Women's Center, the Rape Education
Project and Heightened Education on Ac
quaintance Rape all enjoy healthy
cooperation. Hoefer said he plans to run
several joint projects with these other
organizations in the near future.
Hoefer also plans to send flyers and
notices to similar escort services on other
campuses. He feels that because Stanford
is a "safe" campus, White and he have
had the time and money to improve the
service, buy more golf carts, and plan
the communications system. Hoefer is
worried that other escort services such
as the University of Michigan Safe Walk
system are too besieged by calls to really
devote any attention to improvement. He
hopes that by sending out flyers, he can
give these other systems fresh insight
into how to make their campuses safer.
So far, SURE has done a perfect job

of protecting its clients — no one has
ever attacked a person who was being
escorted. Hoefer cited an even larger ben
efit of the system: "We feel that if SURE's
presence on campus is overwhelming, it
would be a significant deterrent to any
attacks on campus."
Hoefer admitted, however, that the
problem of rape runs much deeper than
attacks by strangers. "I think that the
mtyority of attacks on campus are prob
ably date rapes," he said, "and unfortu
nately an escort service can't do much
about that." His hope, however, is that
"whenever there is any discussion of rape
in any form, it makes people better able
to deal with date rape." Hoefer added
that with the cooperation of the on
campus Women's Center and the Rape
Education Project, the frequency of date
rapes can be reduced.

The availability of the service has been
established; a question students might
have, however, is whether a "safe"
campus like Stanford really provides
enough demand for it. Hoefer insisted
that there is indeed such a demand, and
cited the annual student vote on ASSU
project funding as proof of this. According
to him, SURE receives "overwhelming
support" each year in the polls.
White, who has held some position in
SURE for the last three years, said,
"From the time that I started working,
the business increased about 200 per
cent." Business, he said, has increased
from a maximum of three calls a night
to the average of about thirteen calls on
heavy nights.
White also offered the little known fact
that, although SURE's publicity is aimed
almost exclusively at women, the program
is actually open to anyone. "We never
turn anyone down," he said, although he
is somewhat dismayed by the fact that
many of SURE's male clients misuse the
service. "In my experience," he said, "90
percent of the men who called just didn't
want to walk."
SURE's relationship with other campus
support groups has improved greatly
since its inception. When the service first
appeared, it was disliked by women's
groups on campus, who accused SURE
of being nothing but a "bunch of macho
men" escorting "frail, defenseless"
women around campus. Now SURE, the

Women's Center, the Rape Education
Project and Heightened Education on Ac
quaintance Rape all enjoy healthy
cooperation. Hoefer said he plans to run
several joint projects with these other
organizations in the near future.
Hoefer also plans to send flyers and
notices to similar escort services on other
campuses. He feels that because Stanford
is a "safe" campus, White and he have
had the time and money to improve the
service, buy more golf carts, and plan
the communications system. Hoefer is
worried that other escort services such
as the University of Michigan Safe Walk
system are too besieged by calls to really
devote any attention to improvement. He
hopes that by sending out flyers, he can
give these other systems fresh insight
into how to make their campuses safer.
So far, SURE has done a perfect job

of protecting its clients — no one has
ever attacked a person who was being
escorted. Hoefer cited an even larger ben
efit of the system: "We feel that if SURE's
presence on campus is overwhelming, it
would be a significant deterrent to any
attacks on campus."
Hoefer admitted, however, that the
problem of rape runs much deeper than
attacks by strangers. "I think that the
mtyority of attacks on campus are prob
ably date rapes," he said, "and unfortu
nately an escort service can't do much
about that." His hope, however, is that
"whenever there is any discussion of rape
in any form, it makes people better able
to deal with date rape." Hoefer added
that with the cooperation of the on
campus Women's Center and the Rape
Education Project, the frequency of date
rapes can be reduced.

Fifteen years ago, anyone who wanted
to walk on campus at night would have
had only two options: walk with friends
or aquaintances, or walk completely
alone. These days, as many people know,
there exists another alternative — the
SURE escort service.
SURE, which stands for Stanford
United for Rape Elimination, first ap
peared in 1978. The purpose behind its
founding and operation has always been
simple: to provide a safe walk home for
students.
The service, which receives around 10-
13 calls a night, operates with three em
ployees per shift and two golf carts. One
SURE worker, the shift coordinator,
stays behind in the office to answer calls
and coordinate pick-ups while the other
workers provide the actual transport
across campus. According to SURE co
directors Geoff Hoefer and Todd White,
the golf carts can easily handle most calls
received. The co-directors said it is their
goal to guarantee service within five
minutes, as they are afraid that if they
tell someone, "We'll be there in fifteen
minutes," the person might decide
against using SURE and walk home
alone.
Until as recently as two years ago,
SURE was confined to a small, obscure
office behind the Women's Center near
Toyon Hall. Such a non-central location
made it extremely difficult to dispatch
SURE escorts to the farther reaches of
campus within the promised five
minutes. These days, the SURE office is
on the second floor of Tresidder Union,
right next to the ASSU's Student Organ
ization Services.
The SURE co-directors said they en
joyed the benefit of being funded by SOS.
Their funding represents part of the
"extra services" (about $27) that appears
on every student's bill each quarter. This
money allows SURE to purchase golf
carts to speed service, pay its employees,
and take care of any other expenses they
may have.
Hoefer, who is the director of SURE's
publicity and finances, said publicity an
nouncing SURE's presence has improved
greatly over the years. Still, he com
plained, too few people knew about the
service even last year. With this in mind,
Hoefer and other SURE employees spent
most of last spring and this year's ori
entation spreading the word about the
service. Apparently the effort has been
fairly successful, as an ASSU poll last
spring revealed that 95 percent of female
undergraduates know about SURE.
Despite this recent success, however,
Hoefer is still working hard to ensure

We feel that if SURE's
presence on campus is
overwhelming, it would
be a significant deter
rent to any attacks on
campus.'
- Todd White

that 100 percent of female students know
how to use the escort service. He hopes
that, through a combination of flyers,
phone stickers and bright, glow-in-the
dark whistles bearing SURE's name and
number, everyone will learn about the
program.
Another plan lined up for this year is
the installation of a sophisticated two
way radio communications system. White
explained, "The communication system
was kind of my brain child — I thought
it would be more efficient and would
improve the service dramatically to have
an advanced communication system
similar to (those used by) the police."
Both White and Hoefer agree that such
a system would make it much easier for
an escort to reach a caller faster. For
example, if a call came in requesting an
escort from Wilbur Hall to the Medical
Center, the office could contact a golf
cart that might be heading from Green
Library to Escondido Village, and give it
the new assignment. The cart would then
pick up the person waiting at Wilbur on
its way back from Escondido. Under the
present system, the cart would have to
travel all the way back to the office in
Tresidder, get the assignment and then
trek right back to Wilbur to pick up the
next person.
The communication system could also
alleviate the strain of being bombarded
by too many calls at once. "One of the
problems of the service is that we only
have three people working (at any one
time)," explained White. "If 13 calls come
within five minutes, there's not much we
can do."
Except in the last few years, SURE
has been run exclusively by volunteers.
The recent change to paid employees has
generated some controversy, since paid
workers may take the job simply for the
cash. Hoefer said he felt this isn't the
case, and added that the change helps
employees consider SURE a "serious job,"

rather than something to do just when
they feel like it.
In addition, the transition to paid em
ployees has allowed many students who
are extremely interested in SURE, but
who otherwise wouldn't have the time,
to participate without holding another
job. According to Joel Severson, a new
SURE worker, "I became really interested
in the subject of rape, and (wanted to)
get involved in campus projects dealing
with it. I was looking for a way of being
active, and that I could do this and also
earn money was a godsend."
Damon Whitsitt, a shift coordinator,
agreed with this philosophy: "I had heard
about [SURE] from someone who was
working there. It sounded like a really
good service to provide something differ
ent, and it's a service that needs to be
provided."
"At first I needed a job," Whitsitt said,
"but I do have a problem with working
at something that's (not) meaningful to
me." He said he realized the best aspect
of SURE when he wasn't working: "Un
like working in the bookstore, here you
come home after work and really feel
good about what you've done, which to
me is very important."
The availability of the service has been
established; a question students might
have, however, is whether a "safe"

that 100 percent of female students know
how to use the escort service. He hopes
that, through a combination of flyers,
phone stickers and bright, glow-in-the
dark whistles bearing SURE's name and
number, everyone will learn about the
program.
Another plan lined up for this year is
the installation of a sophisticated two
way radio communications system. White
explained, "The communication system
was kind of my brain child — I thought
it would be more efficient and would
improve the service dramatically to have
an advanced communication system
similar to (those used by) the police."
Both White and Hoefer agree that such
a system would make it much easier for
an escort to reach a caller faster. For
example, if a call came in requesting an
escort from Wilbur Hall to the Medical
Center, the office could contact a golf
cart that might be heading from Green
Library to Escondido Village, and give it
the new assignment. The cart would then
pick up the person waiting at Wilbur on
its way back from Escondido. Under the
present system, the cart would have to
travel all the way back to the office in
Tresidder, get the assignment and then
trek right back to Wilbur to pick up the
next person.
The communication system could also
alleviate the strain of being bombarded
by too many calls at once. "One of the
problems of the service is that we only
have three people working (at any one
time)," explained White. "If 13 calls come
within five minutes, there's not much we
can do."
Except in the last few years, SURE
has been run exclusively by volunteers.
The recent change to paid employees has
generated some controversy, since paid
workers may take the job simply for the
cash. Hoefer said he felt this isn't the
case, and added that the change helps
employees consider SURE a "serious job,"

rather than something to do just when
they feel like it.
In addition, the transition to paid em
ployees has allowed many students who
are extremely interested in SURE, but
who otherwise wouldn't have the time,
to participate without holding another
job. According to Joel Severson, a new
SURE worker, "I became really interested
in the subject of rape, and (wanted to)
get involved in campus projects dealing
with it. I was looking for a way of being
active, and that I could do this and also
earn money was a godsend."
Damon Whitsitt, a shift coordinator,
agreed with this philosophy: "I had heard
about [SURE] from someone who was
working there. It sounded like a really
good service to provide something differ
ent, and it's a service that needs to be
provided."
"At first I needed a job," Whitsitt said,
"but I do have a problem with working
at something that's (not) meaningful to
me." He said he realized the best aspect
of SURE when he wasn't working: "Un
like working in the bookstore, here you
come home after work and really feel
good about what you've done, which to
me is very important."
The availability of the service has been
established; a question students might
have, however, is whether a "safe"
campus like Stanford really provides
enough demand for it. Hoefer insisted
that there is indeed such a demand, and
cited the annual student vote on ASSU
project funding as proof of this. According
to him, SURE receives "overwhelming
support" each year in the polls.
White, who has held some position in
SURE for the last three years, said,
"From the time that I started working,
the business increased about 200 per
cent." Business, he said, has increased
from a maximum of three calls a night
to the average of about thirteen calls on
heavy nights.
White also offered the little known fact
that, although SURE's publicity is aimed
almost exclusively at women, the program
is actually open to anyone. "We never
turn anyone down," he said, although he
is somewhat dismayed by the fact that
many of SURE's male clients misuse the
service. "In my experience," he said, "90
percent of the men who called just didn't
want to walk."
SURE's relationship with other campus
support groups has improved greatly
since its inception. When the service first
appeared, it was disliked by women's
groups on campus, who accused SURE
of being nothing but a "bunch of macho
men" escorting "frail, defenseless"
women around campus. Now SURE, the

Women's Center, the Rape Education
Project and Heightened Education on Ac
quaintance Rape all enjoy healthy
cooperation. Hoefer said he plans to run
several joint projects with these other
organizations in the near future.
Hoefer also plans to send flyers and
notices to similar escort services on other
campuses. He feels that because Stanford
is a "safe" campus, White and he have
had the time and money to improve the
service, buy more golf carts, and plan
the communications system. Hoefer is
worried that other escort services such
as the University of Michigan Safe Walk
system are too besieged by calls to really
devote any attention to improvement. He
hopes that by sending out flyers, he can
give these other systems fresh insight
into how to make their campuses safer.
So far, SURE has done a perfect job

of protecting its clients — no one has
ever attacked a person who was being
escorted. Hoefer cited an even larger ben
efit of the system: "We feel that if SURE's
presence on campus is overwhelming, it
would be a significant deterrent to any
attacks on campus."
Hoefer admitted, however, that the
problem of rape runs much deeper than
attacks by strangers. "I think that the
mtyority of attacks on campus are prob
ably date rapes," he said, "and unfortu
nately an escort service can't do much
about that." His hope, however, is that
"whenever there is any discussion of rape
in any form, it makes people better able
to deal with date rape." Hoefer added
that with the cooperation of the on
campus Women's Center and the Rape
Education Project, the frequency of date
rapes can be reduced.
