### Marli Marinelli 
La Casa Italiana, Stanford's
Italian theme house at 526
Mayfield, quietly blends in with
the other Row houses. That is,
however, until every Saturday
night, when La Casa Italiana tears
off its veil of conformity and
dramatically transforms into La
Pizzeria.
Complete with flickering can
dlelight, red-checked tablecloths,
and classical music playing softly
overhead, La Pizzeria maintains
its status as the only cozy Italian
restaurant at Stanford University
— a place where ravenous patrons
can share a romantic, relaxed
meal.
La Pizzeria debuted at Stanford
during autumn 1978 and has
maintained its delectable Satur
day night custom through the
'80s. Students Melissa Pashigian,
Joe Herrera and Dean Sussman
make up this year's managing
staff of La Pizzeria, which is or
ganized and run entirely by resi
dents of La Casa Italiana.

According to Sussman, the main
purpose of the restaurant is the
promotion of "fun, tradition, and
the responsiblity to share Italian
culture. . . . It's our way of giving
the Stanford community a little
taste of Italy."
At the beginning of each year,
the profits are put back into the
restaurant. Once debts are
cleared, the money goes into a
house fund for the purpose of pur
chasing such permanent items as
VCRs and microwaves.
Between 130 to 200 Stanford
students and community mem
bers sample the authentic cuisine
every Saturday night, according
to the managers. The menu in
cludes pizza, calzone, salad bar
and various house specialties. The
alia capricciosa is a great favorite
among pizza buffs. The topping
is an egg, baked in the center,
surrounded by olives, artichoke
hearts, ham or whatever the cus
tomer prefers.
The ingredients are fresh and
usually imported from Italy or
purchased from an Italian manu-

facturer. And, naturally, each
pizza is coated with warm, oozing
mozarella.
Sussman stresses the fact that
all recipes have been originally
taken from Italians.
Alcoholic beverages cannot be
served, as La Pizzeria is under
University regulation. However,
patrons are free to bring their
own bottle of wine, especially,
adds the managers, "if it's Italian
wine!"
And, naturally, each pizza is
coated with warm, oozing

mozarella.
The margherita, the basic
cheese pizza, costs $3.50, and the
customer can choose additional
toppings for $.50 apiece. Calzone
costs $4.50 per serving and the
salad bar is an additional $1.50.
And, consistent with the Italian
theme, La Pizzeria includes a 10
percent tip in the bill.
For those who live in residences
and dorms that do not offer meals
on Saturday evenings, and for
those in search of a pleasant, Ital
ian dinner, La Pizzeria is an
economical and convenient
solution. Seating is available be
tween 5:30 and 9:30 every Satur
day night, excepting holidays,
three-day weekends, Dead Week
and finals week. Reservations can
be made by calling 853-9776. They
are strongly recommended, espe
cially for large groups.
Entrees at La Pizzeria should
have you fantasizing over
Venetian gondolas, a pleasing al
ternative to the usual Saturday
night cardboard slabs from the
local pizza shops.
