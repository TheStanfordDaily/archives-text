## Cardinal looks to recapture winning spirit against GWU 
### Michael Clayton Staff writer 
Remember the painful, draining feeling
that settles into your stomach after strug
gling through your first midterm. Despite
all of your hard work, somehow that il
lusory aced test eluded your grasp.
Such a feeling has settled into the
stomachs of the Stanford women's soccer
team. After months of preparation and
after quickly attaining a 6-0 record which
placed the Cardinal into the No. 6 national
ranking, Stanford has fallen into a frus
trating midseason rut.
The squad, which in the first six games
outscored opponents 29-1, has lost their
last three games and has fallen to No. 16
in the national rankings. The most frus
trating point of the season, according to
Coach Berhane Andeberhan, came Wednes
day night when the Cardinal fell to St.
Mary's by the score of 1-0.
"We have now played nine games. Of
those games, I have been pleased with seven
of the games," Andeberhan said. "The
opening game against Western Washington
and our last game against St. Mary's were
the only matches in which I didn't feel we
played up to our capabilities. We played an
incredible game against Colorado College
and played extremely well against Santa
Clara. I guess the law of averages must
catch up with you at some point. We just
weren't the same team."
Andeberhan seemed to feel the Stanford
squad was stretching for partial credit in
this crucial match-up. Although he noted
positive contributions, such as frosh stand
out Julie Faudy playing a phenomenal game
while attempting to shake triple coverage,
he remarked that mental lapses seemed to
break the fortuitous Cardinal momentum.
"A lot of good work went to waste," he
said. "We just couldn't convert the open
pass when we had possession, and on de
fense we seemed to be continually losing
track of people."
This Sunday the team will attempt to
escape from the frustrations of midseason
doldrums. George Washington University
will travel to Harry Maloney Field to take
on the struggling Cardinal squad at 10
a.m. With almost no background on this
squad from Washington, D.C., the Cardinal
women will head to the field unprepared
for an extensive test but ready for a pop
quiz.
"All I can say about George Washington
is that I don't know a lot about their

squad," Andeberhan said. "Thursday night
they play in Santa Clara, and I'll be there
to scout out their team."
The last time Stanford played George
Washington was in 1987 at the end of a
three-game road skid. After falling to
Northern Colorado and Colorado College,
the Cardinal lost 2-0 to the less talented
George Washington squad. After that, the
Cardinal squad squirmed to a dismal 4-11-4
final season record.
"I remember a very aggressive, physical
team in 1987," Andeberhan recalled, "but
there may be very little correlation with
that team and this year's George Washing
ton team. There definitely is no correlation
between our team in 1987 and our team
now."
Stanford (6-3) hopes to get back on the
winning track this weekend before difficult
tests against the top-20 squads again fill
its schedule.
In upcoming games, the Cardinal will
face No. 1 North Carolina, No. 3 UC-Santa
Barbara, No. 9 Virginia, No. 10 Wisconsin
and No. 18 California. So far this season,
Stanford has lost to No. 2 Colorado College,
No. 5 Santa Clara and No. 12 St. Mary's.
Andeberhan feels the Cardinal needs to
split its games against top-20 squads in
order to have a substantial bid for an in
vitation to the NCAA postseason tourna
ment. For the bid, the women's team needs
to rediscover its winning ways soon.
"I am beginning to wonder whether the
added pressure of the new environment
and the challenging academic courses has
begun to take a toll on the team," An
deberhan said. "We need to adjust to these
added challenges as soon as possible. We
need to play to our highest capabilities
against George Washington."

A positive note for the Stanford team is that
after weeks of fighting various injuries and ill
nesses, the team has begun to regain its health.

this crucial match-up. Although he noted
positive contributions, such as frosh stand
out Julie Faudy playing a phenomenal game
while attempting to shake triple coverage,
he remarked that mental lapses seemed to
break the fortuitous Cardinal momentum.
"A lot of good work went to waste," he
said. "We just couldn't convert the open
pass when we had possession, and on de
fense we seemed to be continually losing
track of people."
This Sunday the team will attempt to
escape from the frustrations of midseason
doldrums. George Washington University
will travel to Harry Maloney Field to take
on the struggling Cardinal squad at 10
a.m. With almost no background on this
squad from Washington, D.C., the Cardinal
women will head to the field unprepared
for an extensive test but ready for a pop
quiz.
"All I can say about George Washington
is that I don't know a lot about their

squad," Andeberhan said. "Thursday night
they play in Santa Clara, and I'll be there
to scout out their team."
The last time Stanford played George
Washington was in 1987 at the end of a
three-game road skid. After falling to
Northern Colorado and Colorado College,
the Cardinal lost 2-0 to the less talented
George Washington squad. After that, the
Cardinal squad squirmed to a dismal 4-11-4
final season record.
"I remember a very aggressive, physical
team in 1987," Andeberhan recalled, "but
there may be very little correlation with
that team and this year's George Washing
ton team. There definitely is no correlation
between our team in 1987 and our team
now."
Stanford (6-3) hopes to get back on the
winning track this weekend before difficult
tests against the top-20 squads again fill
its schedule.
In upcoming games, the Cardinal will
face No. 1 North Carolina, No. 3 UC-Santa
Barbara, No. 9 Virginia, No. 10 Wisconsin
and No. 18 California. So far this season,
Stanford has lost to No. 2 Colorado College,
No. 5 Santa Clara and No. 12 St. Mary's.
Andeberhan feels the Cardinal needs to
split its games against top-20 squads in
order to have a substantial bid for an in
vitation to the NCAA postseason tourna
ment. For the bid, the women's team needs
to rediscover its winning ways soon.
"I am beginning to wonder whether the
added pressure of the new environment
and the challenging academic courses has
begun to take a toll on the team," An
deberhan said. "We need to adjust to these
added challenges as soon as possible. We
need to play to our highest capabilities
against George Washington."
Card notes
A positive note for the Stanford team is that
after weeks of fighting various injuries and ill
nesses, the team has begun to regain its health.
Andeberhan noted that the team sorely missed
