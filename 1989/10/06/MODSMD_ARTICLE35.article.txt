# Irish pose toughest challenge
## Stanford will look to Smith's arm for miracle against No.1 team 
### Chris Crader Editorial staff 
"It's been a difficult season. . .. It's
a football team that's not comfortable
with itself and is not used to playing
together."
Coming into this weekend's Stanford-
Notre Dame game, that quote could
have come from only one person: Fight
ing Irish Coach Lou Holtz.
Despite the fact that his team is 4-0
and ranked No. 1 in the nation, Holtz
is still worrying. And despite the fact
that his team is 1-3 and 20Vfe-point. un
derdogs, Stanford Coach Denny Green
is a little glad to see the Irish at Stanford
Stadium tomorrow.
"I think this is a good opportunity
for our players," Green said. "We feel
we can play with Notre Dame."
Center Chuck Gillingham agrees.
"This week we've got a great chance,"
he said. "There are only 11 teams that
have a chance to knock these guys off,

12 counting a bowl game. It's a great
challenge, but also a great opportunity."
To make the most of that opportunity,
however, Stanford will need its best
game of the season. Leading the attack
for Notre Dame is quarterback Tony
Rice, one of the leading Heisman
Trophy candidates.
"He's definitely their man," strong
safety Rob Englehardt said. "He's really
quick. ... He's a slippery guy. If you
watch films, you don't see anyone stick
ing him. You see three or four guys
grabbing his ankles and eventually trip
ping him up."
Rice is currently Notre Dame's leading
rusher, having run for 294 yards. Be
hind him are fullback Anthony Johnson
and tailback Ricky Watters.
Each has rushed for over 200 yards
and both are also among the Irish's
leading receivers.
Rice, primarily a runner, has also

been a passer, to the tune of 513
yards so far. His leading target is
Raghib "Rocket" Ismail, who has
11 catches for 241 yards and a
21.9-yard average. Watters and
tight end Derek Brown are also
averaging more than 18 yards per
catch.
Ismail is at his most dangerous,
however, when he is returning
kickoffs. He ran two back for

touchdowns against Michigan, the
first and second times in 32 years
that that had been done against
the Wolverines.
Since then, no one has kicked
to him, according to Holtz. "We
kick deep to Ismail every day
when we work on kickoffs," Holtz
said, "but nobody else has. I don't
know if Stanford will, but I would
if I were them."
Green confessed to have a few
ideas of how to avoid being hurt
by the Rocket, then joked, "We
hope to kick off a lot."

If Stanford is to kick off a lot,
the Cardinal must continue to im
prove its execution on offense. For
much of last Saturday's game, the
Cardinal was moving the ball well,
but the offense sputtered a little
from time to time. Notre Dame's
defense is a lot better than San
Jose State's, however, so Stanford
will need to be clicking on all
cylinders.
Stanford's offense will be miss
ing Jon Volpe, Charlie Young and
Brian Johnson, but fullbacks
Scott Eschelman and Tommy Var
dell are both expected to play.
