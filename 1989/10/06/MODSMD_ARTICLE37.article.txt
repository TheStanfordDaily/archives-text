# Cubs score six in first to topple Giants 9-5, series evened at one all

### 
CHICAGO (AP) - The Chicago
Cubs still cannot stop San Fran
cisco's sluggers. That's OK, be
cause Mark Grace and friends
solved Rick Reuschel and salvaged
the split at Wrigley Field they
needed.
Pitcher Mike Bielecki, the worst
hitter in the major leagues, sin
gled to spark a six-run first inning
and Chicago held the Giants at
bay, winning 9-5 and tying the
National League playoffs at one
game each.
"Seems we got beat pretty good
last night and weren't supposed
to be on the same field with
them," Cubs manager Don Zim
mer said. "I didn't feel that way,
and we showed it."
The Cubs bounced back from
Wednesday night's 11-3 rout in a
hurry. They chased the 40-year
old Reuschel with five hits, in
cluding an RBI double by Grace,
and Jerome Walton capped the
outburst against reliever Kelly
Downs with his second single of
the inning.
That, along with a three-run
double by Grace that made it 9-2

(KM)

in the sixth, was enough for three
Chicago pitchers to withstand San
Francisco's long balls.
Kevin Mitchell, who led the
majors with 47 home runs, con
nected for the second straight
night and singled twice. Will
Clark, who drove in a record six
runs in the opener, singled and
walked and extended his streak
of reaching base to seven. Matt
Williams and Robby Thompson
also homered, giving the Giants a
6-2 edge in that department in
the two games.
The Cubs, though, won Game
2 and sent the series back to San
Francisco even.
"We didn't expect to beat the
Giants twice here," Grace said.

"They're too good for that."
San Francisco didn't think it
could win two, either.
"We came into this hoping for
a split," Manager Roger Craig
said. "But after we won the first
one, we hoped to win the next
one, too."
The next three games will be
in Candlestick Park. Rick
Sutcliffe (16-11) will start against
San Francisco's Mike LaCoss (10-
10) at 8:20 p.m. EDT Saturday.
The Cubs stopped Clark when
it mattered most in Game 2,
maybe because of a move Zimmer
might have made one night ear
lier. Chicago led 6-2 in the fifth
when the Giants put runners on
second and third with two outs.
Zimmer pulled Bielecki and
brought in lefty Paul Assenmac
her to face the left-handed Clark,
who grounded out on the first
pitch.
In Wednesday night's opener,
Zimmer was second-guessed . for
leaving in struggling Greg Mad
dux — even though Assenmacher
was warmed up — to face Clark
with two outs and the bases

loaded in the fourth. Clark hit
the first pitch for a grand slam
that broke the game open.
"That was probably one of my
toughest decisions of the year,"
Zimmer said of lifting Bielecki.
"He needed just one more out for
the victory, but my mind was
made up, just like it was last
night."
Les Lancaster pitched four in
nings for the victory. Because
Bielecki did not last five innings,
Assenmacher would have been in
line for the win, but he gave up
two singles to start the sixth and
was relieved.
An all-day rain that stopped
shortly before game time failed to
dampen the spirits of the sellout
crowd of 39,195 and fans standing
five deep on the nearby rooftops.
A slight wind blowing out, which
helped two fly balls carry into the
bleachers in Game 1, seemed to
favor the Giants.
Bielecki began the game by
walking Brett Butler, but then
picked him off. And when the in
ning ended, the fans were on their
feet and the Cubs' dugout was

We didn't expect to
beat the Giants
twice here. They're
too good for that.

charged as Reuschel walked to the
mound.
Reuschel began his career with
the Cubs in 1972 and won 129
games for them before being
traded in 1981. He returned to
Chicago in 1983 and went 5-5 in
1984, but was left off the Cubs'
postseason roster.
Walton, one of three rookies in
the lineup, singled sharply on the
first pitch and Reuschel was in
trouble, almost like he was in the
All-Star Game when Bo Jackson
and Wade Boggs led off with home
runs.
Ryne Sandberg, who got three
hits in the opener, got a hit-and
run triple on Reuschel's third
pitch. Grace doubled into the ivy

in right field with one out for a
2-0 lead.
Reuschel fanned Andre Dawson
for the second out, but an RBI
single by Luis Salazar and a single
by Shawon Dunston brought on
Downs.
"They hit the good ones and
the bad ones,' said Reuschel, who
had an 11-3 career record against
the Cubs. "They seemed to have
better location on where they hit
my pitches than where I threw
them."
Joe Girardi walked on a full
count to load the bases, bringing
up Bielecki. This season, Bielecki
was 3-for-70 with 35 strikeouts
and just three RBIs, the poorest
hitter for any major leaguer with
at least 35 at-bats.
Bielecki ran the count full and
then singled up the middle, scor
ing two runs, and Walton followed
with a bloop single to center that
made it 6-0.
"I don't know if that was the
biggest hit, Mark's came later, but
it was the biggest hit for me,"
Bielecki said.
