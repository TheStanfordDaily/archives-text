# Consistency costs Stanford in five-game loss to UCLA
## 
### David Earnest Senior staff writer 
Junior L'tter Cheryl Conly predicted on
Wednesday that if the Stanford women's
volleyball team was to beat No. 2-ranked
UCLA last night, it would have to play
consistently.
Conly was right. The Cardinal suffered
once again from inconsistent play and lost
to the Bruins in what Coach Don Shaw
called a "roller coaster match," 7-15, 16-14,
2-15, 15-7, 6-15.

"They just played a little better than we
did," Shaw said after the match. "We had
our moments. We played well at times but
we weren't consistent."
Stanford, now 4-2 in the Pacific 10 Con
ference and 8-4 overall, will try and re
bound from the loss to the Bruins tonight
against No. 11 USC.
Although the Cardinal rallied from 0-1
and 1-2 game deficits to knot the match
at two games apiece, Stanford came up
short in the fifth game Coach Andy Banac
howski of UCLA altered his rotation in the

fifth game of the match to create advan
tageous matchups with the Stanford rota
tion.
"Any time you go to a fifth game, it's
anybody's match," Shaw said. "I didn't
think the changed matchups would make
that much of a difference. As a coach, you
can't get involved in that kind of chess
game and second guess yourself. I had to
go with what was working."
UCLA freshman middle blocker Marissa
Hatchett led the Bruins on the night, tal
lying three solo blocks and nine block as
sists while hitting .400. Senior Daiva
Tomkus, last year's Pac-10 Player of the
Year, was also impressive with 19 kills and
a .351 hitting percentage.
The Stanford attack, on the other hand,
could only muster a .164 hitting percentage
on the night and hit over .200 in only one
game. Sophomore Kristin Klein's 19 kills
were essentially negated by senior hitter
Laura Olesen's -.029 hitting percentage.
The rest of the team could fare no better
r nst the Bruin defense Shaw used every
,er who suited up for the match but
was unable to engineer a victory in the
crucial fifth game
"UCLA played very well defensively,"
Shaw said. "Their outside blockers looked
great.
