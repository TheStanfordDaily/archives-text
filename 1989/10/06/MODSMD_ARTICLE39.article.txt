# Johnson looks past football to baseball future with Yankees

New York Yankees last year, the
two-sport athlete spent a few
weeks last summer training with
the organization's single-A club.
Although the Yankees drafted
him as a third baseman, Johnson
told them he wanted to play the
position that had captured the at
tention of pro ball scouts during

There's a lot more riding on
Brian Johnson's throwing arm
than a future as Stanford's start
ing quarterback.
The Stanford senior already has
begun a promising career in pro
fessional baseball. Drafted by the

his senior year at Skyline High
School in Oakland, Calif. "I told
them I wanted to catch," Johnson
said. "So they sent their hitting
instructor and their catching in
structor to the team that I was
at, as well as their top adminis
trative people. They saw me catch
one day and were ve: excited

'Baseball is my first love. But I wasn't in
desperate need of the money, so I did what I
wanted to do, what I thought I'd have the
most fun doing, and what interested me the
most.'
— Brian Johnson

about it and said, 'We want you
to catch also.'"
The Yankees were not the first
club to recognize Johnson's po
tential as a catcher. During his
senior year of high school,
Johnson was courted by several
franchises. Charlie Silvera,
second-string catcher for the New
York Yankees from 1948 to 1956,
and now a scout for the Mil
waukee Brewers, remembers
Johnson. "The last time I saw
Brian was during his last season
in high school," Silvera said.
"Everyone considered him one
of the top picks in the country,"
he said, adding that Johnson
"would have been the number one
first-round draft pick" had he
decided to go pro right out of high
school.
But Johnson turned down the
Montreal Expos and other inter
ested clubs to pursue a career in
college sports. "Baseball is my
first love," Johnson said. "But I
wasn't in desperate need of the
money, so I did what I wanted to
do, what I thought I'd have the
most fun doing, and what inter
ested me the most."
A skilled quarterback as well as
a baseball player, Johnson was

recruited for both sports at Stan
ford. He accepted a football schol
arship that would allow him to
play on both teams.
A redshirt freshman in 1986,
Johnson started the last seven
games of the 1987 football season
for Stanford, in which the football
team went 5-2. During the previ
ous spring, Johnson played on
Stanford's 1987 NCAA College
World Series champion baseball
team. After the '87 football
season, Johnson traded his shoul
der pads for a baseball bat, hitting
.319 as the 1988 NCAA champion
team's starting left-fielder.
After starting four games for
Stanford's football team in the fall
of '88, Johnson was pulled in fa
vor of freshman quarterback
Jason Palumbis. Selected by coach
Denny Green as this year's start
ing quarterback, Johnson suf
fered a fourth-quarter shoulder
injury against the Oregon Ducks
which has so far prevented him
from further play this season.
Although Johnson reports that
the shoulder is healing rapidly,
such an injury to his throwing
arm could hurt his career as a
professional baseball player. "I ha

ven't heard from the Yankees
about the ii\jury yet, but I bet I
will pretty soon," Johnson said.
He is pleased with his treatment
at the hands of the Yankee or
ganization. "They've been really
good with me," he said. In fact,
due to his professional status,
Johnson is no longer eligible for
Stanford sports scholarships.
(According to NCAA rules, an ath
lete who is being paid by a pro
fessional sports franchise may not
play in the sport for which he is
paid, nor may he accept a school
scholarship to play in other
sports.)
Accordingly, the Yankees have
agreed to pay for his last two
years of school. A political science
Johnson would like to en
roll in a co-term program next
year in order to play one more
season on Stanford's football
team.
While he enjoys the sports and
social life at college, Johnson is
looking forward to his chance at
a professional baseball career. "If
you can play well defensively and
hit well too, you have a good shot
at a career as a catcher," Johnson
said. "I have been fortunate
enough to be able to do those
things so far. I need a little more
luck though, as everybody does
getting through this system."
Former Yankee catcher Silvera,
who played behind Yogi Berra on
seven World Series Champion
teams, is convinced Johnson will
make it to the "Show."
"He's a kid who will go very
far, very fast." Clearly, there's a
big career riding on that throwing
arm.

The New York Yankees are betting that Brian Johnson's arm will be as golden behind the plate as
it is behind Cardinal offensive linemen.
