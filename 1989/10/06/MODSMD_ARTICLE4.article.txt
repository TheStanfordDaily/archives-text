# Louis Jackson at forum: Charges are harassment
## 
### Raoul Mowatt Staff writer 
As part of a UC-Berkeley forum examin
ing police brutality last night, junior Louis
Jackson said he viewed the six misdeamnor
charges he faces in connection to the
takeover of Building 10 as police harass
ment.
Speakers at the forum sought to inform
an audience of more than 400 students
from around the Bay Area about what they
view as a recent rise in racially-motivated
harassment among police officers and about
ways for minorities to protect themselves.
Jackson, the vice chair of the Black Stu
dent Union, recounted the events leading
up to the May 15 occupation of University
President Donald Kennedy's office, saying
"On May 15, I did the right thing."
Jackson is the only protester being
charged with incitement to riot and battery.
"I've come to realize that the police are
not my friends," Jackson said.

In response to police encroachment, Jack
son said people should "come together like
the fingers closing in a fist, do the right
thing, and fight the power."
Jackson received a standing ovation from
the capacity crowd at Wheeler Auditorium.
Many students there also supported Jack
son by signing a petition asking that the
charges against him be dropped. Jackson's
next court date is Oct. 12. If found guilty,
he could face a two-year jail term and a
$2,000 fine.
Other speakers at the forum pointed to
the pervasiveness of prejudice among the
nation's police departments.
Don Jackson, a former police officer, left
the force to form an organization that doc
uments instances of police brutality.
"As a police officer, I woke up and
realized I was black. I decided to shake
the chains of my mentality and get off the
plantation," Jackson said. "Many of you
have not made that choice," he
added.
This January, Don Jackson ar
ranged a sting operation to dem
onstrate prejudice among some
police officers. He was driving
peacefully down a Long Beach
street late one night. Police ap
proached his car and had him pull
over. The two officers proceeded
to beat him, although he was com
plying with the officers' requests,
he said. One officer shoved Jack
son's head through a window.
Don Jackson had set up a video

camera in his car and recorded
his mistreatment. NBC News also
filmed the beating.
Calling Southern California
"the new South," Don Jackson
described a number of other acts
of police brutality. He also pre
sented several racially offensive
fliers that had been found in
Southern California police depart
ments.
"[But] these types of incidents
are not limited to any one police
department. It's a pattern
throughout the whole country," he
cautioned. "I'm watching a rapid
deterioration of treatment of
people of color by the police."
To end police harassment, indi
viduals must stand up for their

rights, he said. In another
videotaped exchange with police,
Don Jackson showed how in
formed and assertive action can
protect minorities.
He also stressed the need to
make individual police officers ac
countable for their actions. He
called for departments to educate
police officers about the commu
nities in which they work and to
revoke the licenses of officers
found guilty of brutality.
UC-Berkeley's African Student
Association held the forum in re
sponse to a July 16 incident in
volving alleged police brutality.
The incident occurred following a
black fraternity party at a
Berkeley nightclub.
