Jackson said he viewed the six misdeamnor

In response to police encroachment, Jack
son said people should "come together like
the fingers closing in a fist, do the right
thing, and fight the power."
Jackson received a standing ovation from
the capacity crowd at Wheeler Auditorium.
Many students there also supported Jack
son by signing a petition asking that the
charges against him be dropped. Jackson's
next court date is Oct. 12. If found guilty,
he could face a two-year jail term and a
$2,000 fine.

nation's police departments.
Don Jackson, a former police officer, left

"As a police officer, I woke up and
realized I was black. I decided to shake
the chains of my mentality and get off the
plantation," Jackson said. "Many of you
