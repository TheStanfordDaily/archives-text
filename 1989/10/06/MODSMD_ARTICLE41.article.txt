# Water polo looks to drown Anteaters
## Coach says Stanford needs win to be legitimate contender for NCAA crown 
### T.C. Hall Staff writer 
There's an underworld few Stanford
students get to see. It's a world full of
speed, stamina, big guys in little
Speedos and water . . . lots of water.
The world of water polo opens to the
Stanford community today as the fifth
ranked Cardinal hosts the second
ranked Anteaters of UC-Irvine.
"This is the biggest game of the year
for us," Dettamanti said. "This is the
first good team we have played since
the Irvine tournament. If we want to
win the NCAAs, we need to win this
kind of game."
Though it is still early in the season,
Dettamanti knows that it is critical for
the squad to move up in the rankings
and show itself as a force. The sentiment
is shared by his players.
"This is a big game for us," junior
holeman Chuck Maguy said. "We can't
make any mistakes. We really need to
prove ourselves."
This task won't be an easy one, as
the Irvine squad is loaded. "They
definitely deserve their No. 2 ranking,"
Dettamanti said. Irvine's only loss this
season has come against No. 1 Califor
nia, a team that Stanford beat in the
first game of the season. This would
be comforting if Stanford had not al
ready lost to the Anteaters 9-7 in the

NCAAs, we need to

Irvine tournament Sept. 15.
The talent of the Irvine squad rests
with three people: goalie Chris
Duplanty, fieldman Juliene Harvey, and
hole Tom Ward. Duplanty was one of
the goalies for the '88 Olympic team,
and Harvey started for the U.S. Na
tional team this summer. According to
Dettamanti, Ward is just "strong."
To combat these threats, Dettamanti
will be pressing more and is putting
Eric Blum on Harvey, and Rick McNair
on Ward. All he can hope for against
Duplanty is that the team shoots well.
The key, however, will be to contain

Harvey, whom Dettamanti calls a
"tough, tenacious bulldog of a player
who does everything for the team."
To win, Stanford cannot commit the
kind of errors they had in the first
Irvine game.
"We literally gave them two goals in
the last game," Dettamanti said. "Irvine
is the kind of team that can capitalize
on your mistakes. We just can't make
mistakes."
Errors, however, will not be the teams
only concern. Once again, Stanford is
facing a team that is slightly bigger.
"The team needs to be physical," Det
tamanti said. "I consider Irvine the pre
mier team in the country. Along with
Cal and ourselves, Irvine is in the upper
echelon of water polo in the country."
A win would not only boost Stanford's
national ranking but give the team con
fidence going into a game against the
University of Southern California to
morrow in Berkeley at 10 a.m.
"USC is a young, hungry team that
pulled off a few upsets at the Irvine
tournament," Dettamanti said. "They
can't be overlooked."
For now, however, the Anteaters of
Irvine represent the task at hand.
"The guys must rise to the challenge,"
Dettamanti said. "If they want to win
it, they are going to have to work for
it. This game will show what kind of
team we have."
