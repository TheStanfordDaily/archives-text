# UCLA, SDSU stand in way of soccer team's playoff hopes
## 
### Andrew Wilcox Staff writer 
While most of this weekend's
attention will be focused on the
football team's clash with No. 1-
ranked Notre Dame, the Stanford
men's soccer squad will have its
own chance to knock off the top
team in the nation as the Cardinal
faces UCLA Sunday after doing
battle at San Diego State tonight.
Riding a four-game winning
streak which has raised its record
to 6-4-1, Stanford heads south to
play its "two most important
games so far this season." "These
are teams we have to beat to reach
the NCAAs," Coach Sam Koch
said.
"If we split this weekend, we're
in the hunt, but if we lose both
[gardes] our backs are agajpst the
wall. We'll' 4 HaW a gb6d' Idea of
our NCAA chances after this
weekend."
The Cardinal received a look at
the Aztecs last weekend when
both squads competed in the
Southern Methodist Lettermen's
Classic in Dallas. Although they
did not meet in the tournament,
the two teams both defeated SMU

and North Texas, with SDSU
claiming the championship by
virtue of a larger goal differential.
The Aztecs, who stand at 6-3-1,
boast one of the most dangerous
front lines in the country. Leading
the attack are junior Eric
Wynalda, called "very explosive"
by Koch, and sophomore Jeff
Betts. Koch said the Cardinal will
focus on keeping the ball away
from Wynalda, which would "cut
down a portion of their of
fense."
Despite the impressive showing

at the SMU tournament, SDSU
is unsettled in the midfield area,
where no one has taken control
for the Aztecs. "They have so
much firepower up front, but the
midfield is average comparative
ly," Koch said.
UCLA, Sunday's foe, should
provide Stanford its toughest test
of the year. The undefeated
Bruins, though ranked second in
the most recent poll, must cur
rently be considered the top team
in the country because No. 1 Vir
ginia has since lost.
The Bruins are strong in all
areas, as the top recruiting class
in the country reinforced what
would have already been an ex
ceptional squad. Freshman Chris
Henderson, the Gatorade Na
tional Player of the Year as a high
school senior, and sophomore Cobi
Jones, both of whom possess
"lightning speed" according to
Koch, head up a stellar midfield
line.
Although the Bruins possess no
apparent weaknesses, they are
hardly invincible. Senior forward
Bill Thompson, UCLA's leader
and superstar, is out for the
season with a broken leg.
