### Baldwin Lee Editorial staff 
Fourteen men's and women's
cross country teams will roll into
Stanford Saturday for the Holiday
Inn Stanford Invite, a meet both
Cardinal teams look forward to
as a gauge for the upcoming cham
pionship season.
Races will begin at the second
tee of the Stanford Golf Course,
with women starting at 10:30 a.m.
and men starting at 11 a.m.
According to junior Melanie
Bloch, traditional powerhouses
UC-Irvine, UCLA and Oregon will

provide the stiffest competition
for the female Card.
Arkansas, Arizona and New
Mexico, three men's teams ranked
in the top 10 nationally, are slated
to perform Saturday, although
Arkansas may miss the meet due
to injuries.
Bloch said the women want to
move past last year's "off-season,"
when the team did not qualify for
Districts.
According to Mastalir, to fulfill
its expectations the men's team
must reach the NCAA Chamion
ships.
