After battling the second
ranked team in the country, you
would think the Stanford women's
field hockey team would treat to
morrow's Alumni Game as a
leisurely match.
Wrong.
Coming off a 5-0 loss to the
University of North Carolina, the
Cardinal will square off against
an exceptional, all-star alumni
squad.

"It will be a tough match,"
Coach Sheryl Johnson said. "It's
just like any regular game."

Like any other adversary, to
morrow's opponent boasts quite a
menacing lineup. Ail-Americans
Alison Smith and Karen Jones,
who graduated from Stanford last
year, are scheduled to lead tomor
row's alumni roster. Smith and
Jones are both currently alter
nates for the national field hockey
team.
In addition, assistant coaches
Andi Wolpert and Suzanne Doi
are scheduled to play for the
alumni. Both coaches were All-
Northern Pacific Conference

awardees and helped lead Stan
ford to three straight conference
championships.
"I'm really excited for tomor
row's game," senior co-captain
Beth Le winger said. "I've played
with so many of the returning
alumni that playing against them
will be different."
"The team already has a really
strong defense," Le winger said.
"Tomorrow, we'll be able to work
on our biggest problem — scor
ing."
