# Irish student becomes Daily's newest Greek
## 
### Buck Montana Senior staff writer 
Welcome back to Greek of the
Week. Today, our Guest Greek
is none other than Debbie Char
les worth.
Who, you may ask, is Debbie
Charlesworth? Well, she's per
fectly qualified to be the Guest
Greek because she is topical.
A senior at Notre Dame, she

is visiting Stanford to watch the
game and visit her close amiga,
Daily features editor Jennie
Schmid.
And she knows football. So
well that she didn't even hesitate
before picking Air Force over
Navy.
Actually, The Daily tried to
get San Francisco 49ers quar
terback Joe Montana as the
Guest this week, as he is a grad

uate of Notre Dame. But he was
too busy to get back to us up
here, so it's a no go fo' Joe.
Charlesworth showed herself
to be no dummy in the ways of
the Greeks, fitting right in with
some fine predictions and a
wacky score (56-3). "I heard
there might be a chance to do
this so I was on the next flight
out," she said. "I hope it stays
sunny. I want to get a tan before

I go back to Notre Dame so all
my friends will hate me."
She will have a tough time
living up to the standard set by
her predecessor, however, as Jon
Weisman went 8-2 to take the
overall lead as the Guest. Weis
man also correctly picked the tie
between Pittsburgh and West
Virginia in what was clearly an
historic occasion.
