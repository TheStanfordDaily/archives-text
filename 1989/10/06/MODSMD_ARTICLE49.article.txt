# Business School working to incorporate globalization
## 
### Ed Palattella 
As Stanford's Graduate School
of Business reviews its purpose
today and Saturday at its last
alumni reunion of the decade,
many of the faculty say it can
look ahead to covering a large sub
ject in the years to come.
That subject is the world.
According to many business
school faculty and staff, the
globalization of markets will be
one of the most important aca
demic issues facing the school in
the 19905.
Along with the study of busi
ness ethics and the effects of non
market forces, many faculty say
globalization will be a subject stu
dents must understand if they
wish to contribute to the con
stantly changing business world.
"I don't know if it's the most
important issue, but it is certainly
one of the most important things
we have been working on," said
John Roberts, professor of eco
nomics and associate dean of the
School of Business. On Saturday,
Roberts will deliver a speech,
"Globalizing the GSB," as part of
the alumni reunion.
"We recognize globalization as
more important," said Charles
Bonini, associate dean of the
school. "Twenty years ago,
America was self-sufficient;
foreign goods were only a small
percentage of the economy.
"It's not that way anymore.
Companies need to compete on a
world market. They need to po
sition and advertise their prod
ucts."
Dean Robert Jaedicke, in an in
terview with the Stanford Busi
ness School Magazine last March,
predicted the globalization of
markets as one of five issues that
"will be of necessary importance
in the future."

The globalization of
markets will be one of
the most important
academic Issues
facing the school in
the 19905.

"The world is rapidly develop
ing into a borderless society, at
least in the sense of interdepen
dent economies, trade, business
linkages and so forth," said
Jaedicke.
"It will be increasingly difficult
for business leaders to compete
and prosper in the future — no
matter where they are located —
if they don't have a basic under
standing of the forces at work
when the marketplace includes
players from countries from
around the world."
Although Jaedicke, dean since
1983, will retire from his post in
August or as soon as his replace
ment is named, the school will
continue to focus on his globaliza
tion prediction. And according to
faculty members, the globaliza
tion studies won't be difficult to
undertake because the school has
been focusing on the issue all
along.
"In terms of people and pro
grams," Roberts said, the
globalization program has
expanded in the last 10 years. "On
the people side," he said, there
were 10 foreign-born faculty
members 10 years ago. There are
now 29. He said a large number
of American-born faculty have
also become experts on interna
tional issues within that time.
The business curriculum has
expanded in the last decade as
well, Roberts said. Within 10

years, he said, the number of
courses dealing with international
issues has jumped from five to 17.
Roberts also cited changes in
the school's language requirement,
as well as the opening of a Stan
ford campus in Kyoto, Japan, next
month, as contributing to the
school's globalization process.
Others agreed that the advances
were considerable.
"Twenty-five years ago, the
Stanford Business School began
to look at the changing business
environment," said Charles Hol
loway, Herbert Hoover professor
at the school. In 1980, Holloway
said, the school also launched a
core course in "Business and the
Changing Environment."
The course, he said, "pulls to
gether political, economic and eth
ical factors that influence
business."
One of those factors, Holloway
said, has always been globaliza
tion. He said the issue has been
given more publicity recently be
cause of noticeable examples of
market expansion, such as the
Sony Corp.'s buying of Columbia
Pictures last week.
"There is more visibility," Hol
loway said.
George Parker, a professor of
management and director of ex
ecutive education, said the school
had already made strides toward
understanding the international
marketplace.
"We are partway there," Parker
said of globalization. "There is al
ready one world economy. There
is a (globalization) mentality as
well as the curriculum."
Like Bonini, Parker linked the
growth of globalization to the
United States' increased depen
dency on foreign goods and
markets. Gone are the days, he
said, when the American economy
could survive on its own.

"So much in the world has
changed," Parker said. He said
the "explosive growth" of Third
World countries was a main part
of the change.
Also adding to the market ex
pansion, Parker said, is the forma
tion of the European Economic
Community in 1992, an action
that will eliminate trade barriers
between the EEC nations and
make Europe more of a single
economic force.
Roberts mentioned the EEC as
a factor in globalization, but cited
other elements as well, such as

the development of satellites, fac
simile machines, low-cost jet
travel and other high-tech innova
tions. The fact that there has not
been a major war in 44 years has
been another benefit to world
trade, he said.
The U.S. trade deficit has also
added to the globalization,
Roberts said. As the United States
relies on foreign capital to finance
its deficit, Roberts said, it also
uses that money to buy foreign
goods. An example of globaliza
tion's influence, Parker said, will
be found in the use of the word

"international" in describing busi
ness courses.
"There will be a possible demise
of 'international' in course titles,"
Parker said. "It will be so impor
tant that all courses will be in
ternational."
"I think the issues will perme
ate the curriculum; that is what
is happening in business, too.
Reviewing the School of Busi
ness' work on globalization, Hol
loway was encouraged, but said
the school has much more to ac
complish. "I wouldn't want to say
we've done it all," he said.

other elements as well, such as

the development of satellites, fac
simile machines, low-cost jet
travel and other high-tech innova
tions. The fact that there has not
been a major war in 44 years has
been another benefit to world
trade, he said.
The U.S. trade deficit has also
added to the globalization,
Roberts said. As the United States
relies on foreign capital to finance
its deficit, Roberts said, it also
uses that money to buy foreign
goods. An example of globaliza
tion's influence, Parker said, will
be found in the use of the word

"international" in describing busi
ness courses.
"There will be a possible demise
of 'international' in course titles,"
Parker said. "It will be so impor
tant that all courses will be in
ternational."
"I think the issues will perme
ate the curriculum; that is what
is happening in business, too.
Reviewing the School of Busi
ness' work on globalization, Hol
loway was encouraged, but said
the school has much more to ac
complish. "I wouldn't want to say
we've done it all," he said.

As Business School alumni meet this weekend, the school will be looking to adapt to an Increasingly
global economy.
As Stanford's Graduate School
of Business reviews its purpose
today and Saturday at its last
alumni reunion of the decade,
many of the faculty say it can
look ahead to covering a large sub
ject in the years to come.
That subject is the world.
According to many business
school faculty and staff, the
globalization of markets will be
one of the most important aca
demic issues facing the school in
the 19905.
Along with the study of busi
ness ethics and the effects of non
market forces, many faculty say
globalization will be a subject stu
dents must understand if they
wish to contribute to the con
stantly changing business world.
"I don't know if it's the most
important issue, but it is certainly
one of the most important things
we have been working on," said
John Roberts, professor of eco
nomics and associate dean of the
School of Business. On Saturday,
Roberts will deliver a speech,
"Globalizing the GSB," as part of
the alumni reunion.
"We recognize globalization as
more important," said Charles
Bonini, associate dean of the
school. "Twenty years ago,
America was self-sufficient;
foreign goods were only a small
percentage of the economy.
"It's not that way anymore.
Companies need to compete on a
world market. They need to po
sition and advertise their prod
ucts."
Dean Robert Jaedicke, in an in
terview with the Stanford Busi
ness School Magazine last March,
predicted the globalization of
markets as one of five issues that
"will be of necessary importance
in the future."

The globalization of
markets will be one of
the most important
academic Issues
facing the school in
the 19905.

"The world is rapidly develop
ing into a borderless society, at
least in the sense of interdepen
dent economies, trade, business
linkages and so forth," said
Jaedicke.
"It will be increasingly difficult
for business leaders to compete
and prosper in the future — no
matter where they are located —
if they don't have a basic under
standing of the forces at work
when the marketplace includes
players from countries from
around the world."
Although Jaedicke, dean since
1983, will retire from his post in
August or as soon as his replace
ment is named, the school will
continue to focus on his globaliza
tion prediction. And according to
faculty members, the globaliza
tion studies won't be difficult to
undertake because the school has
been focusing on the issue all
along.
"In terms of people and pro
grams," Roberts said, the
globalization program has
expanded in the last 10 years. "On
the people side," he said, there
were 10 foreign-born faculty
members 10 years ago. There are
now 29. He said a large number
of American-born faculty have
also become experts on interna
tional issues within that time.
The business curriculum has
expanded in the last decade as
well, Roberts said. Within 10

years, he said, the number of
courses dealing with international
issues has jumped from five to 17.
Roberts also cited changes in
the school's language requirement,
as well as the opening of a Stan
ford campus in Kyoto, Japan, next
month, as contributing to the
school's globalization process.
Others agreed that the advances
were considerable.
"Twenty-five years ago, the
Stanford Business School began
to look at the changing business
environment," said Charles Hol
loway, Herbert Hoover professor
at the school. In 1980, Holloway
said, the school also launched a
core course in "Business and the
Changing Environment."
The course, he said, "pulls to
gether political, economic and eth
ical factors that influence
business."
One of those factors, Holloway
said, has always been globaliza
tion. He said the issue has been
given more publicity recently be
cause of noticeable examples of
market expansion, such as the
Sony Corp.'s buying of Columbia
Pictures last week.
"There is more visibility," Hol
loway said.
George Parker, a professor of
management and director of ex
ecutive education, said the school
had already made strides toward
understanding the international
marketplace.
"We are partway there," Parker
said of globalization. "There is al
ready one world economy. There
is a (globalization) mentality as
well as the curriculum."
Like Bonini, Parker linked the
growth of globalization to the
United States' increased depen
dency on foreign goods and
markets. Gone are the days, he
said, when the American economy
could survive on its own.

"So much in the world has
changed," Parker said. He said
the "explosive growth" of Third
World countries was a main part
of the change.
Also adding to the market ex
pansion, Parker said, is the forma
tion of the European Economic
Community in 1992, an action
that will eliminate trade barriers
between the EEC nations and
make Europe more of a single
economic force.
Roberts mentioned the EEC as
a factor in globalization, but cited
other elements as well, such as

the development of satellites, fac
simile machines, low-cost jet
travel and other high-tech innova
tions. The fact that there has not
