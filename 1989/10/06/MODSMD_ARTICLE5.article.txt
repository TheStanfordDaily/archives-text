# Soviet students postpone Stanford visit due to shortage of flights

### Liz Lempert Staff writer 
A delegation of Soviet exchange stu
dents who planned to visit Stanford later
this month has postponed its trip because
the students couldn't buy airline tickets.
Fifteen Soviets from Novosibirsk State
University in Western Siberia planned to
visit Stanford between Oct. 19 and Nov.
5 as part of a cultural exchange organized
by the Stanford/Soviet Exchange Project.
The trip has been tentatively postponed
until April.
Rob Eno, director of the project, at
tributed the difficulty of obtaining plane

tickets to a case of "demand over supply."
More Soviets want to visit abroad, but
the number of flights has not increased
enough to accommodate this growing
body of travelers.
"Now that the (Soviet) government is
more liberal and allowing more freedom,
more people are traveling abroad," he
said. Aeroflot, the only airline available
to Soviet fliers, is sold out of all its tickets
to the United States.
While other airlines besides Aeroflot
fly to the USSR, only Aeroflot accepts
rubles, the Soviet currency. Since rubles
are not legally transferable into other
currencies, Soviets cannot purchase tick

ets on other airlines, Eno said.
The Soviet students put in a request
for plane tickets last February, eight
months before the planned October flight,
allowing two months more than the sug
gested advance purchase period, he said.
University officials at Novosibirsk
never heard from Aeroflot about their
ticket request until August, when they
learned that their request was never re
ceived.
"I'm still a little hazy about how the
process worked," Eno said.
He said a change in the university's
staff could have led to some confusion.
While the request was being processed,

the administrator overseeing Novosibirsk
University's foreign matters was
replaced.
While Eno was in the Soviet Union
last month as part of the other half of
the exchange, he traveled to Moscow with
part of Novosibirsk's student delegation
and stood in line for three days outside
Aeroflot's travel agency.
"We were Number 150 the first day,
Number 50 the next and we finally got
called on at 5 p.m. the third day," Eno
recalled.
"The person at the desk said, No, we're
all sold out.' They were sold out as far
(in advance) as they offer tickets," Eno

said.
Novosibirsk's delegation has put in a
request for April plane tickets, and the
Stanford/Soviet Exchange Project is
making plans to host the group then.
Eno said the Soviet delegation's prob
lem with obtaining plane tickets is not
unusual. He said the New York Citizen
Exchange Council, a group that helped
the project with logistics in its first year,
told him it is a "common problem."
Those involved with planning for the
Soviet's stay are "really disappointed,"
Eno said. "All our planning for the host
ing is shot."
