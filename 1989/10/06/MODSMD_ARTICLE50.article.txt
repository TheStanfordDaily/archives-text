"Athletes should not be
treated as prime beef," said
Andy Geiger, director of Stan
ford athletics, in a forum last
night which focused on the role
of intercollegiate athletics in
the modern university.
The program began with
speeches by Geiger and the
Rev. E. William Beauchamp,
executive vice president of the
University of Notre Dame, and
then opened for questions from
the audience and a panel of
press members that included
John Roarbak, former owner
and general manager of KSTS
TV, channel 48 in San Jose,
Chris Crader, senior sports
editor of The Daily and
Leonard Koppett, editor
emeritus of the Peninsula
Times Tribune.
Although Notre Dame's and
Stanford's football teams will
compete against each other on
Saturday at Stanford Stadium,
Beauchamp and Geiger's views
blended harmoniously on the
message that college athletes
play an important role but that
athletics should never interfere
with their studies and their so
cial interaction.
Geiger went on to say that
athletes "should not be held in
special dormitories, should not

be given special disciplinary ar
rangements, should not be
given extraordinary privileges,
and should not be made a
demagogue above and beyond
the regime of those found to
be educationally best at the
given university.
"The student athletes must
be given the opportunity to ex
perience the university, rather
than to graduate with only
being able to say, 'I played foot
ball,' or 'I played basketball'
for X University," he said. "The
goal (of intercollegiate athle
tics) is to have complete inte
gration of the athletics into the
student body," he added.
Both speakers also said they
believed that college athletics
have been overhyped due to the
heated, emotional intensity the
American public brings out in
competitions, leading to uneth
ical actions such as com
promised admissions policies
concerning athletes.
While there are many nega
tive aspects to the overcompeti
tiveness in today's inter
collegiate athletics, Beauchamp
reminded the audience of the
positive effects of a strong ath
letic force.
"In varying degrees, athletic
programs have had an impact
in the development of our
major universities."
