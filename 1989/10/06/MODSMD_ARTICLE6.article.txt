# Beliefs and building community
## New Asian-American dean doesn't leave work at the office 
### Sophia Shing Staff writer 
Rick Yuen, the new full-time
assistant dean of Student Affairs
and director of the Asian Ameri
can Activities Center, cannot boast
of leaving his work at his desk
every night, because his life out
side of Stanford revolves around
many of the same beliefs he works
for on campus.
Yuen graduated from UC-
Berkeley with bachelor's degrees
in Asian-American studies and
sociology. He said he was very
involved in community service as
a student and vocally advocated
the legitimacy of ethnic studies
on his campus.
As early as his freshman year,
Yuen volunteered at a health clinic
in San Francisco's Chinatown. He
said that performing free cataract
and glaucoma eye tests gave him
a genuine appreciation of the
unique character of the China
town community.
A witness to the decrepit con
ditions in Chinatown, Yuen said

he believed that housing and other
basic needs were blatantly under
met in San Francisco. Though he
said he could clearly see these
injustices, learning the actual
facts through his Asian-American
studies courses showed him the
urgency of the situation.
"I knew Chinatown was
crowded, but when 1 learned that

it was the second densest area in
the nation next to Manhattan, I
was really shocked," Yuen said.
"It also has one of the highest
rates of tuberculosis in the coun
try."
Yuen added that a combination
of his involvement in community
service and research in Asian-
American studies provided him
with a sharper understanding of
the community. He emphasized
the importance for students to
learn about their history and how
their forefathers have contributed
to society.
Yuen encourages non-Asians to
study ethnic studies as well, be
cause he feels it will help increase
their appreciation of other cul
tures.
"Stanford has set trends in
working toward a multicultural
education . . . but I think that
striving for an appreciation of dif
ferences is also necessary for
pluralism to really develop," Yuen
said.

Yuen added that the number of
Asians all across the nation nearly
doubled between the '70s and the
'80s and is expected to double
from the '80s to the '90s. More
over, he said, the Bay Area has
the highest concentration of
Asians outside of Asia.
"We are a vibrant community
with rising numbers. There are
currently 30 Asian student organ
izations on campus with 10 form
ing just last year," Yuen said.
During Yuen's first year at UC-
Berkeley, a bachelor's program in
Asian-American studies was initi
ated. His alma mater also offers
a doctoral program in ethnic
studies.
Yuen commented, "It begins
with one class and one professor
and it grows from there. You have
to go one step at a time, but it
is important to always have prog

ress."
"We need to have both the in
stitutionalization and integration
of Asian-American studies, with
the former being the more critical
step we need to take," Yuen said.
One of the projects which Dean
Yuen is hoping to initiate at Stan
ford is a workshop series on un
derstanding Asian-Americans.
For these programs, Yuen plans
to bring various experts to
campus and making several social
services available to students as
well as holding informal discus
sions.
Yuen also intends to increase
joint-programming with Okada,
the Asian- American theme house.
This effort, he said, would help
to make the Asian community in
creasingly more united and lively.
His msyor undertaking for au
tumn quarter is the establishment
of an Asian-American Resource
Center. The center will house
books, videos and movies on
Asian-American issues.
