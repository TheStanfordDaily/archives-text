# Attitude shift sensed in ties with Hoover
## 
### Jock Friedly Editorial staff 
University President Donald Kennedy breathed a
deep sigh of relief Aug. 31.
A new face took over the directorship of the
Hoover Institution that day, and now — less than
two weeks after the Faculty Senate shot down a
proposal by leading Hoover critics to study the
relationship between the two institutions — other
University professors and administrators are begin
ning to sense that Hoover has changed markedly.
The sudden shift in attitudes has fueled specula
tion that the two institutions might be on a course
for more cooperation, in contrast to the critics'
suggestion that ties to Hoover be severed.

News analysis

"What has happened has been to remove the
barriers for cooperation," said James Gaither, chair
of the Board of Trustees.
That barrier's name is W. Glenn Campbell. Camp
bell, who was ousted from the directorship after
nearly 30 years of service, drew about as many
critics of the think tank as he did endowment dollars.
To be sure, Campbell built Hoover into what it
is today, but for years Campbell clashed with Stan
ford administrators, the Board of Trustees and more
recently the Hoover Board of Overseers.
Complementary resources
If Campbell was the reason for the previous hos
tility, acting director John Raisian is the reason for
the renewed sense of cooperation. By every account,
Raisian is a firm leader, an administrative moderate
who doesn't shoot off his mouth as his predecessor
was wont to do.
Many faculty members and administrators, par
ticularly Kennedy, have spoken glowingly of Raisian's
leadership ability.
"I think things are in very good hands," said
Gaither.
In something that has not been seen for years,
Raisian is turning the praise for himself into praise
for the Institution. Since Raisian took over just six
weeks ago, University officials are beginning to see
Hoover more as a resource to complement Stanford
rather than to compete with it.
"Hoover is a potentially valuable, untapped
resource for Stanford," according to Roger Noll,
director of the University's public policy program.
Besides the extensive archives, Noll said, Hoover
has a staff of impressive fellows with strong ties
to some of the nation's top policy makers.
Those resources, Noll and others are arguing,
should be much better utilized by Stanford. This
view has always gone head to head against the view
that Hoover should be divorced from Stanford, much
as SRI International was divorced from Stanford
two decades ago.
As one example of this clash, the Faculty Senate
voted against a proposal by long-time Hoover critics
John Manley, professor of political science, and
Ronald Rebholz, professor of English. Their proposal
