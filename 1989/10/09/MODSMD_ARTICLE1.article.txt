# Attitude shift sensed in ties with Hoover
## 
### Jock Friedly Editorial staff 
University President Donald Kennedy breathed a
deep sigh of relief Aug. 31.
A new face took over the directorship of the
Hoover Institution that day, and now — less than
two weeks after the Faculty Senate shot down a
proposal by leading Hoover critics to study the
relationship between the two institutions — other
University professors and administrators are begin
ning to sense that Hoover has changed markedly.
The sudden shift in attitudes has fueled specula
tion that the two institutions might be on a course
for more cooperation, in contrast to the critics'
suggestion that ties to Hoover be severed.

News analysis

"What has happened has been to remove the
barriers for cooperation," said James Gaither, chair
of the Board of Trustees.
That barrier's name is W. Glenn Campbell. Camp
bell, who was ousted from the directorship after
nearly 30 years of service, drew about as many
critics of the think tank as he did endowment dollars.
To be sure, Campbell built Hoover into what it
is today, but for years Campbell clashed with Stan
ford administrators, the Board of Trustees and more
recently the Hoover Board of Overseers.
Complementary resources
If Campbell was the reason for the previous hos
tility, acting director John Raisian is the reason for
the renewed sense of cooperation. By every account,
Raisian is a firm leader, an administrative moderate
who doesn't shoot off his mouth as his predecessor
was wont to do.
Many faculty members and administrators, par
ticularly Kennedy, have spoken glowingly of Raisian's
leadership ability.
"I think things are in very good hands," said
Gaither.
In something that has not been seen for years,
Raisian is turning the praise for himself into praise
for the Institution. Since Raisian took over just six
weeks ago, University officials are beginning to see
Hoover more as a resource to complement Stanford
rather than to compete with it.
"Hoover is a potentially valuable, untapped
resource for Stanford," according to Roger Noll,
director of the University's public policy program.
Besides the extensive archives, Noll said, Hoover
has a staff of impressive fellows with strong ties
to some of the nation's top policy makers.
Those resources, Noll and others are arguing,
should be much better utilized by Stanford. This
view has always gone head to head against the view
that Hoover should be divorced from Stanford, much
as SRI International was divorced from Stanford
two decades ago.
As one example of this clash, the Faculty Senate
voted against a proposal by long-time Hoover critics
John Manley, professor of political science, and
Ronald Rebholz, professor of English. Their proposal
was to form a committee to study
the relationship between Hoover
and Stanford.
Both Manley and Rebholz have
called for Stanford to sever ties
with the instituion because they
say Hoover has a mission — to
dispel the myths of Marxism —
that is contrary to ordinary aca
demic principles.
Much of the argument against
the proposal touched on Raisian.
Many of the proposal's critics, led
by Kennedy, said that relations
were improving since Raisian took
Hoover's helm and that a study
could only hurt that relationship.

It is exactly that attitude that
has Manley so upset. Manley fears
Raisian is less outspoken about
his political beliefs than Campbell
and that outsiders might not
notice Hoover's true mission.
"I'm really not that complex,"
Raisian said about the criticisms.
"I pretty much talk the way I
feel."
Nevertheless, the rejection of
the Manley-Rebholz proposal was
visibly a relief to Raisian, who is
grateful for the support from in
side and outside Hoover. "If I had
a contributing force then I'm glad
I did," Raisian said.
Thorny issues
To continue the trend of bet
tering relations, Stanford will

have to pull out the sharpest
thorn in the relationship between
the two institutions: faculty ap
pointments. One-fifth of the Hoo
ver fellows hold joint
appointments in other depart
ments, either as full professors or
as courtesy appointments.
In the past, though, individual
departments clashed with Hoover
over certain key scholars, includ
ing one that left lingering negative
feelings on both sides. In that
clash, Senior Fellow Bruce Bueno
de Mesquita, a top political scien
tist in his field, was denied an
appointment to the political sci
ence department.
But Raisian, who wants the
Bueno de Mesquita case to be the
exception rather than the rule,

said he doesn't "harbor hard
feelings toward the department."
Other examples such as John
Ferejohn, who is both at Hoover
and a political science professor,
show that the department can
work with Hoover.
The issue of faculty appoint
ments needs to be worked out this
year if possible, Raisian said.
On other fronts, there are new
areas in which the relationship
could improve under Raisian. One
project that was conceived during
Campbell's last year but now of
fers some hope to increase
Stanford-Hoover ties is Hoover's
television project.
The think tank hopes to build
a television studio with satellite
uplink that Hoover scholars —

and probably other Stanford pro
fessors — can use.
"This looks like a great teaming
project," Raisian said.
Raisian said he hopes the rela
tionship will improve even more
with a renewed emphasis on
public relations.
"I think there is a lot of work
that can be done to set the record
straight about what the Hoover
Institution is all about," Raisian
said. "I think that people will have
more of an open mind [toward
Hoover]."
A new era?
However, big questions about
the Hoover-Stanford relationship
remain. Those questions may not
be answered this year, Raisian is

only acting director while the
Hoover search committee still
looks for a permanent director.
While that search is pending
this year, few permanent changes
are expected in the relationship.
Ferejohn said, "I see a lot of
uncertainty. I would imagine
there will be shifts, but I don't
know what those will be. I think
it's too early to tell."
If the common sentiment is any
thing to hang a hat on, permanent
changes are more than likely
when Kennedy and the Board of
Trustees approve the next direc
tor.
According to Gaither, "A new
era has begun, and I'm going to
work very hard to make sure it
continues."

relationship between the two institutions — other
University professors and administrators are begin
ning to sense that Hoover has changed markedly.
The sudden shift in attitudes has fueled specula
tion that the two institutions might be on a course
for more cooperation, in contrast to the critics'
suggestion that ties to Hoover be severed.

News analysis

"What has happened has been to remove the
barriers for cooperation," said James Gaither, chair
of the Board of Trustees.
That barrier's name is W. Glenn Campbell. Camp
bell, who was ousted from the directorship after
nearly 30 years of service, drew about as many
critics of the think tank as he did endowment dollars.
To be sure, Campbell built Hoover into what it
is today, but for years Campbell clashed with Stan
ford administrators, the Board of Trustees and more
recently the Hoover Board of Overseers.
Complementary resources
If Campbell was the reason for the previous hos
tility, acting director John Raisian is the reason for
the renewed sense of cooperation. By every account,
Raisian is a firm leader, an administrative moderate
who doesn't shoot off his mouth as his predecessor
was wont to do.
Many faculty members and administrators, par
ticularly Kennedy, have spoken glowingly of Raisian's
leadership ability.
"I think things are in very good hands," said
Gaither.
In something that has not been seen for years,
Raisian is turning the praise for himself into praise
for the Institution. Since Raisian took over just six
weeks ago, University officials are beginning to see
Hoover more as a resource to complement Stanford
rather than to compete with it.
"Hoover is a potentially valuable, untapped
resource for Stanford," according to Roger Noll,
director of the University's public policy program.
Besides the extensive archives, Noll said, Hoover
has a staff of impressive fellows with strong ties
to some of the nation's top policy makers.
Those resources, Noll and others are arguing,
should be much better utilized by Stanford. This
view has always gone head to head against the view
that Hoover should be divorced from Stanford, much
as SRI International was divorced from Stanford
two decades ago.
As one example of this clash, the Faculty Senate
voted against a proposal by long-time Hoover critics
John Manley, professor of political science, and
Ronald Rebholz, professor of English. Their proposal
was to form a committee to study
the relationship between Hoover
and Stanford.
Both Manley and Rebholz have
called for Stanford to sever ties
with the instituion because they
say Hoover has a mission — to
dispel the myths of Marxism —
that is contrary to ordinary aca
demic principles.
Much of the argument against
the proposal touched on Raisian.
Many of the proposal's critics, led
by Kennedy, said that relations
were improving since Raisian took
Hoover's helm and that a study
could only hurt that relationship.

It is exactly that attitude that
has Manley so upset. Manley fears
Raisian is less outspoken about
his political beliefs than Campbell
and that outsiders might not
notice Hoover's true mission.
"I'm really not that complex,"
Raisian said about the criticisms.
"I pretty much talk the way I
feel."
Nevertheless, the rejection of
the Manley-Rebholz proposal was
visibly a relief to Raisian, who is
grateful for the support from in
side and outside Hoover. "If I had
a contributing force then I'm glad
I did," Raisian said.
Thorny issues
To continue the trend of bet
tering relations, Stanford will

have to pull out the sharpest
thorn in the relationship between
the two institutions: faculty ap
pointments. One-fifth of the Hoo
ver fellows hold joint
appointments in other depart
ments, either as full professors or
as courtesy appointments.
In the past, though, individual
departments clashed with Hoover
over certain key scholars, includ
ing one that left lingering negative
feelings on both sides. In that
clash, Senior Fellow Bruce Bueno
de Mesquita, a top political scien
tist in his field, was denied an
appointment to the political sci
ence department.
But Raisian, who wants the
Bueno de Mesquita case to be the
exception rather than the rule,

said he doesn't "harbor hard
feelings toward the department."
Other examples such as John
Ferejohn, who is both at Hoover
and a political science professor,
show that the department can
work with Hoover.
The issue of faculty appoint
ments needs to be worked out this
year if possible, Raisian said.
On other fronts, there are new
areas in which the relationship
could improve under Raisian. One
project that was conceived during
Campbell's last year but now of
fers some hope to increase
Stanford-Hoover ties is Hoover's
television project.
The think tank hopes to build
a television studio with satellite
uplink that Hoover scholars —

and probably other Stanford pro
fessors — can use.
"This looks like a great teaming
project," Raisian said.
Raisian said he hopes the rela
tionship will improve even more
with a renewed emphasis on
public relations.
"I think there is a lot of work
that can be done to set the record
straight about what the Hoover
Institution is all about," Raisian
said. "I think that people will have
more of an open mind [toward
Hoover]."
A new era?
However, big questions about
the Hoover-Stanford relationship
remain. Those questions may not
be answered this year, Raisian is

only acting director while the
Hoover search committee still
looks for a permanent director.
While that search is pending
this year, few permanent changes
are expected in the relationship.
Ferejohn said, "I see a lot of
uncertainty. I would imagine
there will be shifts, but I don't
know what those will be. I think
it's too early to tell."
If the common sentiment is any
thing to hang a hat on, permanent
changes are more than likely
when Kennedy and the Board of
Trustees approve the next direc
tor.
According to Gaither, "A new
era has begun, and I'm going to
work very hard to make sure it
continues."
University President Donald Kennedy breathed a
deep sigh of relief Aug. 31.
A new face took over the directorship of the
Hoover Institution that day, and now — less than
two weeks after the Faculty Senate shot down a
proposal by leading Hoover critics to study the
relationship between the two institutions — other
University professors and administrators are begin
ning to sense that Hoover has changed markedly.
The sudden shift in attitudes has fueled specula
