joined the protesters on the
Schoenhauser Allee.
However, police moved in to
drive demonstrators into side
streets several times, beating
many of them with truncheons
and clubs and using trucks with
steel-mesh barriers in front, wit
nesses said.
A middle-aged man who
watched the action from his apart
ment window said: "It's getting
worse and worse. Some day soon,
rocks and Molotov cocktails are
going to fly."
Hundreds of injuries were re
ported as police swinging
truncheons repeatedly charged
demonstrators in East Berlin on
Saturday and early Sunday. Police
punched, kicked, beat and dragged
the protesters away, and roughed
up Western journalists covering
the demonstrations.
The East German protests were
the largest since a workers' upris

ing was put down by Soviet forces
in 1953.
Despite the growing unrest and
the exodus of thousands of East
Germans to the West, East Ger
man leader Erich Honecker said
during talks with Gorbachev Sat
urday that he would stick to his
hard-line course.
An estimated 15,000 people
joined in pro-reform demonstra
tions over the weekend in East
Berlin, Leipzig, Dresden,
Potsdam, Jena and Plauen, ac
cording to West German television
and witness accounts.
ARD, a West German television
network, showed television
footage of helmeted East German
police in riot gear charging dem
onstrators in the historic city of
Leipzig, hitting them with
truncheons even after the protest
had been broken up.
In East Berlin the official East
German news agency called the
protesters "troublemakers."
For the fourth straight day
Sunday, East Germany barred
Western tourists from entering
East Berlin. Tourists were turned
away after being told "it is not
possible today" with no further
explanation.
The exodus of tens of thousands
of East Germans via Hungary,
Czechoslovakia and Poland deeply
embarrassed East Berlin's leader
ship during the weekend anniver
sary celebrations.
