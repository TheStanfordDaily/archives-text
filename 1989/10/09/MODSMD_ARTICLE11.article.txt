Chainsaw massacre
BABYLON, N.Y. (AP) - A
father was arrested and
charged yesterday with using
a chainsaw to cut up a car al
legedly driven by his son during
a hit-and-run accident that
killed a 15-year-old girl.
Vincent Senisi, 45, and Vin
cent Senisi Jr., 23, were being

Yovino said the younger
Senisi was driving his 1989

girl as she was crossing the
street.
The driver left the scene of
the accident and drove to his
workplace, a landscaping busi

aaid.
He said Senisi then allegedly
asked his father to cut up the
car with a chain saw in what
police say was an attempt to
dispose of the evidence.

same address in Deer Park,
were being held by county
police in Babylon and were to
be arraigned today.
Mason leaves campaign
NEW YORK (AP) - Com
edian Jackie Mason says the
staff of Republican mayoral
candidate Rudolph Giuliani is
so "incompetent" that it's hard
to know if "they're running a
campaign or they're running
for their life."
Mason resigned under pres
sure from the Giuliani cam

paign Sept. 27 after remarks
that the rabbi-turned-comed
ian made about blacks and
Jews were published in the Vil
lage Voice.
"I never saw a more incom
petent group of people in my
life," Mason says of the
Giuliani campaign staff in the
Oct. 16 issue of New York mag
azine.
"They look like they don't
know if they're running a cam
paign or they're running for
their lives or they should be
running for a bar on Second
Avenue." _
Irish car bombing
BELFAST, Northern Ireland
(AP) â€” A car bomb exploded
yesterday in a town near Bel
fast, killing a senior police of
ficer and wounding his wife,
police reported.
They also said Belfast police
found a bomb hidden in a
prison where most of the in
mates are suspected terrorists
and the explosive device was
part of an escape plan.
There was no claim of re
sponsibility for the car bomb
in Lisburn, 8 miles west of Bel
fast. A police spokesman said
the explosion killed Superin

slightly injured his wife.
The spokesman was unable
to say if the Harrises were in
the car at the time or if the

on their way to church when
the bomb went off.
Two other high-ranking of

Harry Breen and Superintend

to death by guerrillas of the
Irish Republican Army in
March as they crossed the bor
der after a meeting with police
in the Irish Republic.
