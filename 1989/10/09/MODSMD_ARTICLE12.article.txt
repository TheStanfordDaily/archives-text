BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) — Communists
at a historic congress have proclaimed their
party's death and the birth of a Socialist Party
aspiring to Western democratic ideals. But
the difference between the old and the new
remains unclear.
A document approved overwhelmingly by
the congress Saturday terminated the Com
munist Party — called the Hungarian Socialist
Workers Party — and proclaimed the Hun
garian Socialist Party its successor.
It was the first time a Warsaw Pact Com
munist party formally terminated its exis
tence. The move was part of preparations for
the first free national elections in 41 years.
Yesterday, the party daily Nepszabadsag ap
peared without its customary title-page cita
tion from the Communist Manifesto:
"Workers of the World Unite."
Instead of the usual masthead proclaiming
Nepszabadsag the central paper of the Hun
garian Socialist Worker's Party, Sunday's edi
tion simply identifed it as a "socialist paper.'
Although the congress document sought to
define ideological and practical differences be
tween the old and the new party, senior offi
cials differed over what that really meant.

Socialist Party."-—JBHBBfIp'T"
But Deputy Premier was
less optimistic that the cOTgress had managed
to bury the repressive Leninist past and create
a party in the Western democratic tradition.
Asked if the Hungarian Socialist Party was
truly new, he told reporters yesterday:"I don't
see the signs of that, although I honestly
would have welcomed it."
Since the congress opened Friday, radical
reformers have insisted that orthodox Com

munists would have no place in the new party.
But members of the old party are also mem
bers of the new party — at least temporarily
"I am not convinced that the so-called cleans
ing (of ranks) that is necessary actually has
happened," Medgyessy said.
Premier Miklos Nemeth, a key reformer,
told the congress that any new party would
have no room for "those with blood on their
hands" from past Communist excesses.
Membership is not automatically trans
ferable. The position paper said those wanting
to join the new party would first have to state
their intentions in writing.
But drastic language that would have barred
Communist conservatives was watered down
out of fears the msyority would reject the
-document. The paper stated instead that the
new party wants to "call in its ranks all those
who agree with its platform/ agree with its
ground rules."
Such ambiguity has resulted in the unsual
development of former Politburo member
Janos Berecz — among the most vehement
opponents of reform — asking to join the new
party Saturday, just hours after he declared
himself ready to be "tied to the stake" for
his Communist beliefs.
