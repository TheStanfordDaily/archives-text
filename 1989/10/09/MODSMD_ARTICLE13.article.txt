BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -
Another outbreak of violence
struck this country at war with
drug lords yesterday as fire
blamed on a bomb killed seven
people on a bus and the body of
an army secretary was found
riddled with bullets.
There were no immediate
claims of responsibility, but the
attacks came in the midst of a
7-week-old war that drug traffick
ers and government officials have
been waging.
Also yesterday, there were ac
cusations and denials over allega
tions that President Virgilio
Barco's government explored pos
sibilities of a truce with the Medel
lin drug cartel.
The driver of the bus in Bogota,
Luis Fernando Pataquiva, told the
RCN radio network that a man
and a woman apparently left a
bomb in the rear that exploded

moments after they got off.
Police said seven people were
killed and seven iryured, but local
news reports said seven were
killed and eight injured.
"Apparently the fire was caused
by an incendiary bomb," a na
tional police spokeswoman said on
condition of anonymity. She did
not elaborate.
Radio station Caracol reported
that a policeman at the scene said
the fire apparently started in a
five-gallon plastic container of
gasoline in the back of the bus.
Police said they found the body
of Mrs. Nury Veelasquez de
Vasquez, private secretary of the
commander of the Fourth Army
Brigade, shot 18 times.
Unidentified men dragged her
from a taxi in Medellin on Friday
and took her with them in their
car, police said.
Police said they found her bodv

next to a car near the town of
Marinilla about 8 miles northwest
of Medellin.
Authorities said they had no
motive in the crime, but the
Fourth Army Brigade has been
active in confiscating property of
suspected drug traffickers.
Before yesterday's reports of vi
olence, 148 bombings and other
attacks blamed on drug traffick
ers killed at least 10 people and
wounded 164 since Aug. 19, when
the traffickers declared war on
the government.
The government declared an
anti-drug crackdown Aug. 18, the
same day leading presidential
hopeful Sen. Luis Carlos Galan
was assassinated.
Joaquin Vallejo, a former inte
rior minister, said in reports pub
lished yesterday that he acted as
a go-between in truce negotiations
between the Medellin cocaine car-

Tel and the government before the
anti-drug crackdown began.
The new interior minister,
Carlos Lemos Simmonds, denied
that the government had talks
with drug traffickers.
"The government received a
proposal and immediately an
swered 'no,"' he told reporters
outside the presidential palace
moments after being sworn in,
replacing Orlando Velasquez.
Also sworn in yesterday was
Roberto Salazar Manrique as min
ister of justice and Enrique
Danies as communications minis
ter.
The report of the negotiations
was published Saturday in the
Bogota daily La Prensa, an
opposition-owned newspaper. Val
lejo backed the La Prensa account
in interviews published by two
other Bogota newspapers, El
Tiempo and El Espectador.
