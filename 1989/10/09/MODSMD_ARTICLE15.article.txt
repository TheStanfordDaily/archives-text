Examining relationship
with Hoover is crucial
during transition time
AMID continued criticisms of
the Hoover Institution and
determined efforts to protect
the think tank's independence, the
issues behind the debate about re
lations between Stanford and Hoo
ver have clouded.
A clear voice could come in the
form of a committee that would
define the concept of "normal ac
ademic governance" and would
consider ways that relations be
tween Hoover and Stanford could
be restructured.
Unfortunately, a proposal to
form such a committee fell flat at
the Faculty Senate meeting last
week.
For years now, Political Science
Prof. John Manley and English
Prof. Ronald Rebholz have criti
cized the relationship between
Stanford and Hoover. Then, in
spring 1988, the two professors in
itiated a petition drive asking the
Board of Trustees either to bring
Hoover under "normal academic
governance" or to end relations be
tween Hoover and Stanford.
University President Donald
Kennedy, who is a member of the
senate, spoke in opposition to the
proposal to form a new committee.
Kennedy explained that Hoover's
cooperation with the University is
improving rapidly and that form
ing the committee could swing re
lations back in the other direction
again.
Manley and Rebholz believe that
since Hoover is not formally
governed by the University, Stan
ford's strong ties to Hoover are
inappropriate. These concerns are

shared by many individuals in the
Stanford community and they
deserve at least to be examined
more closely.
The purpose of the committee
would not be to impose authority
over the think tank. Rather, the
committee could serve a similar
function as the University Com
mittee on Minority Issues, and,
similarly, could issue a report that
would attempt to clear up miscon
ceptions.
At the senate meeting, Kennedy
also expressed concern over the
fact that Hoover is entering an in
terim period, owing to the fact that
former Hoover director W. Glenn
Campbell was retired from his post
Aug. 31 and assumed his new po
sition as counselor to the Institu
tion.
Deouty director John Raisian is
serving as acting director while the
search for a permanent director
continues.
However, setting up a committee
during the interim period would
allow the committee to have infor
mation ready by the time a new
director is appointed. Guidelines
could be set up so that the new
director would have no misun
derstandings concerning Hoover's
relationship to Stanford.
The fact that 57 fatuity mem
bers, who signed Manley and Reb
holz's petition, are concerned about
Hoover's relationship to Stanford
and that the senate vote was so
close — 18-15 — is reason enough
to reconsider the proposal to form
a committee.
A committee does not have to
threaten the peaceful relationship
that Kennedy is attempting to
foster with Hoover; it only needs
to define this relationship and per
haps, in doing so, it can make this
relationship better and even more
peaceful.
