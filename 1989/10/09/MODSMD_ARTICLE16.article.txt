A public thank you
to Kennedy before
'Don-bashing' begins
I would like to publicly thank Uni
versity President Donald Kennedy for
the job he performs for the University.
It is quite reassuring to know that
the seat of power at Stanford is occu
pied by a person of such wisdom, ener
gy, compassion and diplomacy.
While I am saddened to see how few
undergraduates appreciate the skill
which he brings to the office of the
presidency, I must believe that if the
students had sufficient understanding
of the difficulties inherent in his posi
tion as arbiter and liaison between the
students, faculty, staff and the Board
of Trustees, they could not but
wonder, as I do, at his acumen.
So before the 1989-90 season of
"Don-bashing" officially commences, I
would like to proudly and publicly
voice my appreciation for his efforts
and accomplishments.
I can only hope that I speak for the
silent majority when I say, President
Kennedy, I support you all the way.

Kennedy is correct
not to intervene
on Jackson's behalf
Those who have been so quick to
denounce Louis Jackson's arrest as
"racism" have, in their zeal, ignored
several crucial issues.
Jackson's supporters raise the emo
tional issue of police racism to obscure
the fact that he broke the law and as
such should be punished. His partners
in crime defend him by saying that
others who engaged in similar miscon
duct do not tace jail sentences. This

justification is woefully inadequate.
They maintain that, since others
committed the same crimes, the
charges against him should be dropped.
On the contrary, if we had the
evidence, the other guilty parties
should be likewise prosecuted.
Carrying out justice equally is a
cause we can all support. However,
excusing the guilty because of potential
imperfections in the justice system
cannot be tolerated. Others guilty of
the same crimes as Jackson are invited
to turn themselves in and face the
same penalties.
University President Donald Kennedy
should be applauded for not caving in
to public sentiment by using University
influence to have Jackson released. If
Jackson is guilty, he should go to jail;
if he is innocent, he will go free. The
court, not the student body, should
decide.

Students must speak
out to assure Dead
concerts in spring
I agree with The Daily's opinion of
the Oct. 1 Grateful Dead show. It was
a terrific concert. My problem is with
the assuredness that there will be
Frost Amphitheater shows in spring.
Sadly, some of the higher-ups in the
University would like to see the Frost
shows canceled. This opinion was made
public by the former Dean of Student
Affairs James Lyons last spring. No
definite answer has yet been given
about this spring's shows.
Students should rally together to let
the University know that we want the
Dead back at Frost this year. The band
itself has called a halt to the camping
and vending about which the school
complained. This ban will be enforced
by the security personnel hired by the
band.

versity know that we

The University's objections to the
concert have been properly addressed.
The Grateful Dead at Frost in the
spring is a tradition; part of what
makes Stanford unique. The student
body needs a pledge from the Univer
sity not to interfere with the concert.
Let's not let a close-minded administra
tion deny the campus the Grateful
Dead experience.

People turned away
from Arias' speech
due to lack of seats
We are writing to express our disap
pointment and anger after being turned
away from Thursday's scheduled talk
by Costa Rican President Oscar Arias
Sanchez at Dinkelspiel Auditorium. All
of the publicity including a large ad in
The Daily encouraged the public to
attend this free lecture.
Although we arrived early the lim
ited seats available to the public had
been filled and we were turned away.
No provisions were made to broad
cast Arias' speech over KZSU or the
Stanford Cable Network.
We urge Stanford organizations spon
soring public events to clearly state the
availability of seating, and if a large
turnout is expected, every effort should

be made to broadcast the event at an
other location. Very limited seating
was available to the public for Thurs
day's address at Dinkelspiel, but none
of the publicity for the event stated
this fact.

And by the way ...
At a university that prides itself on
its equal treatment of the students of
all races and religions, why are there
classes today, on Yom Kippur, the
holiest of all Jewish holidays, when all
Jewish people are required to spend
the entire day in temple?

influence to have Jackson released. If
Jackson is guilty, he should go to jail;
if he is innocent, he will go free. The
court, not the student body, should
decide.

Students must speak
out to assure Dead
concerts in spring
I agree with The Daily's opinion of
the Oct. 1 Grateful Dead show. It was
a terrific concert. My problem is with
the assuredness that there will be
Frost Amphitheater shows in spring.
Sadly, some of the higher-ups in the
University would like to see the Frost
shows canceled. This opinion was made
public by the former Dean of Student
Affairs James Lyons last spring. No
definite answer has yet been given
about this spring's shows.
Students should rally together to let
the University know that we want the
Dead back at Frost this year. The band
itself has called a halt to the camping
and vending about which the school
complained. This ban will be enforced
by the security personnel hired by the
band.

Students should rally
together to let the Uni
versity know that we
want the Grateful Dead
back at Frost Amphi
theater this year.

The University's objections to the
concert have been properly addressed.
The Grateful Dead at Frost in the
spring is a tradition; part of what
makes Stanford unique. The student
body needs a pledge from the Univer
sity not to interfere with the concert.
Let's not let a close-minded administra
tion deny the campus the Grateful
Dead experience.

People turned away
from Arias' speech
due to lack of seats
We are writing to express our disap
pointment and anger after being turned
away from Thursday's scheduled talk
by Costa Rican President Oscar Arias
Sanchez at Dinkelspiel Auditorium. All
of the publicity including a large ad in
The Daily encouraged the public to
attend this free lecture.
Although we arrived early the lim
ited seats available to the public had
been filled and we were turned away.
No provisions were made to broad
cast Arias' speech over KZSU or the
Stanford Cable Network.
We urge Stanford organizations spon
soring public events to clearly state the
availability of seating, and if a large
turnout is expected, every effort should

be made to broadcast the event at an
other location. Very limited seating
was available to the public for Thurs
day's address at Dinkelspiel, but none
of the publicity for the event stated
this fact.

And by the way ...
At a university that prides itself on
its equal treatment of the students of
all races and religions, why are there
classes today, on Yom Kippur, the
holiest of all Jewish holidays, when all
Jewish people are required to spend
the entire day in temple?

A public thank you
to Kennedy before
'Don-bashing' begins
I would like to publicly thank Uni
versity President Donald Kennedy for
the job he performs for the University.
It is quite reassuring to know that
the seat of power at Stanford is occu
pied by a person of such wisdom, ener
gy, compassion and diplomacy.
While I am saddened to see how few
undergraduates appreciate the skill
which he brings to the office of the
presidency, I must believe that if the
students had sufficient understanding
of the difficulties inherent in his posi
tion as arbiter and liaison between the
students, faculty, staff and the Board
of Trustees, they could not but
wonder, as I do, at his acumen.
So before the 1989-90 season of
"Don-bashing" officially commences, I
would like to proudly and publicly
voice my appreciation for his efforts
and accomplishments.
I can only hope that I speak for the
silent majority when I say, President
Kennedy, I support you all the way.

Kennedy is correct
not to intervene
on Jackson's behalf
Those who have been so quick to
denounce Louis Jackson's arrest as
"racism" have, in their zeal, ignored
several crucial issues.
Jackson's supporters raise the emo
tional issue of police racism to obscure
the fact that he broke the law and as
such should be punished. His partners
in crime defend him by saying that
others who engaged in similar miscon
duct do not tace jail sentences. This

justification is woefully inadequate.
They maintain that, since others
committed the same crimes, the
charges against him should be dropped.
On the contrary, if we had the
evidence, the other guilty parties
should be likewise prosecuted.
Carrying out justice equally is a
cause we can all support. However,
excusing the guilty because of potential
imperfections in the justice system
cannot be tolerated. Others guilty of
the same crimes as Jackson are invited
to turn themselves in and face the
same penalties.
University President Donald Kennedy
should be applauded for not caving in
to public sentiment by using University
influence to have Jackson released. If
Jackson is guilty, he should go to jail;
if he is innocent, he will go free. The
court, not the student body, should
decide.
