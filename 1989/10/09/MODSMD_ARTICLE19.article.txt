## Blacks get a bad message 
### 
AS AN AFRICAN-AMERICAN
woman, I hold my Stanford edu
cation to be very dear. It is a pre
cious opportunity that I am fortunate
enough to attend one of the nation's finest
institutions of higher learning.
I believe that my college education is
a gift produced and given to me by the
marching feet, hard work and articulate
voices of my African-American
foreparents. Because so much is invested
in this gift given to very few black people,
I have an obligation to return it to the
African-American community.
Therefore, Stanford has an obligation
to allow me to study the true history
and contemporary conditions of our so
ciety so I can best serve or work with
the African-American community
Stanford must ensure that the envi
ronment here is conducive to optimal
learning. All students should be free to
discuss their views in respectful discourse
and should expect to be challenged in like
manner.
All of us have a right to be free from
any kind of harassment or intimidation.
Listening to University President
Donald Kennedy's welcoming speech to
the new students, expressing that all
Stanford students have a right to be here,
made me wonder if this statement applies
to African-American students.
Across America and at Stanford, I have
felt that black people at all levels of so
ciety have come under attack.
From Bensonhurst, where a black
youth was senselessly murdered by white
youths for being "at the wrong place at
the wrong time," to Stanford, where

Louis Jackson, vice chair of the Black
Student Union, is being singled out for
selective prosecution over the May 15
takeover of Kennedy's office for defending
students right to fight for a multicultural
education, black people get the message
that we are not welcome.
Here at Stanford, where acts of clear
racist harassment and intimidation have
been turned into issues of free speech
and de facto defenses of racists, black
people get a clear message: "Go back
where you came from, you do not belong
here."
I feel this message every day, even
under all of Stanford's veils of pluralism
and respect for multicultural diversity.
My financial aid was cut by almost 70
percent from my first year to my senior
year. I may not be able to complete my
African and Afro-American studies mtyor
because the program is shamelessly un
derfunded and the faculty who teach in
it are few in number.
On a daily basis, I am asked to act
African-American to those who wonder
why I dare to raise issues concerning
black people in class.
Nevertheless, I believe, with all the
attacks directed against African-
Americans in society and here on the
"Farm," Stanford's promotion of the
ideals of a pluralistic community and re
spect for all people has the greatest op
portunity for becoming a reality.
If this institution truly desires a plu
ralistic community in which all members
are respected and not merely tolerated,
then more funds must be committed to
the financial aid of students of color over

A human relations board must be es
tablished which sends the message that
any act of racism, sexism and homophobia
will not be tolerated. Ethnic studies de
partments must be developed by the ad
ministration as institutions that contrib
ute to the intellectual life and multicul
turalism of the University.
