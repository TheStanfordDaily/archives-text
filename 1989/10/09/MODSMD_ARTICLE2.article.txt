# Passion for hearts of stone
## New earth sciences dean eager to recruit

When it comes to geology, too many stu
dents have hearts of stone.
But W. Gary Ernst, the new dean of the
School of Earth Sciences, is a true romantic.
After nearly 30 years at UCLA, Ernst has
come to Stanford to show students the
rewards of his lifelong love.
"It's an exciting time to be in the earth
sciences. That's why it hurts me that there
aren't more students coming along, because
they could share that excitement," Ernst
said.
Ernst will try to convey some of that
passion next fall, when he will be teaching
the introductory class in earth sciences. At
present, he is limiting his teaching to a
seminar as he becomes accustomed to Stan
ford.
"I've got a lot to understand about the
administration of the school. I don't even
know the lingo yet," Ernst said.
It will be challenging to take an already
reputable school and improve it, Ernst said.
One of the biggest problems he faces is
declining undergraduate participation in
his department.
During the energy crisis of the 19705,
people became more aware of the increased
need for earth science expertise. But the
high level of interest created a surplus of
majors, the dean said, leaving many un
employed.
Though demand for earth scientists re

enough students, and
the need will grow in the
future.'

mains relatively high, students are fright
ened away from the field by a perceived
lack of openings, Ernst explained. Some
also fear that possibilities in the earth
sciences will decline over the next few years,
he said.
Earth Sciences will hold open houses and
other events for undergraduates to acquaint
themselves with some of the new possibil
ities for earth science mayors, Ernst said.
As America's energy consumption con
tinues to be high, many more scientists
are needed to optimize our limited supply
of oil, water and other precious resources,
he explained.
As many Third World countries moder
nize, they will face increased demands for
fuels as well, he added.
"We're down at rock bottom," the earth
scientist said. "We can't turn out enough
students, and the need will grow in the
future."
