# Passion for hearts of stone
## New earth sciences dean eager to recruit 
### Raoul Mowatt Staff writer 
When it comes to geology, too many stu
dents have hearts of stone.
But W. Gary Ernst, the new dean of the
School of Earth Sciences, is a true romantic.
After nearly 30 years at UCLA, Ernst has
come to Stanford to show students the
rewards of his lifelong love.
"It's an exciting time to be in the earth
sciences. That's why it hurts me that there
aren't more students coming along, because
they could share that excitement," Ernst
said.
Ernst will try to convey some of that
passion next fall, when he will be teaching
the introductory class in earth sciences. At
present, he is limiting his teaching to a
seminar as he becomes accustomed to Stan
ford.
"I've got a lot to understand about the
administration of the school. I don't even
know the lingo yet," Ernst said.
It will be challenging to take an already
reputable school and improve it, Ernst said.
One of the biggest problems he faces is
declining undergraduate participation in
his department.
During the energy crisis of the 19705,
people became more aware of the increased
need for earth science expertise. But the
high level of interest created a surplus of
majors, the dean said, leaving many un
employed.
Though demand for earth scientists re

future.'

mains relatively high, students are fright
ened away from the field by a perceived
lack of openings, Ernst explained. Some
also fear that possibilities in the earth
sciences will decline over the next few years,
he said.
Earth Sciences will hold open houses and
other events for undergraduates to acquaint
themselves with some of the new possibil
ities for earth science mayors, Ernst said.
As America's energy consumption con
tinues to be high, many more scientists
are needed to optimize our limited supply
of oil, water and other precious resources,
he explained.
As many Third World countries moder
nize, they will face increased demands for
fuels as well, he added.
"We're down at rock bottom," the earth
scientist said. "We can't turn out enough
students, and the need will grow in the
future."
At Stanford, the number of
earth science majors has dropped
from 147 in 1982-83 to 26 last
year. The number of undergrad
uates majoring in the earth
sciences is also declining at schools
nationwide, according to Ernst.
"[Earth science careers are] not
going to get cold," Ernst said.
"Right now there are a lot of jobs
going begging. People who get in
now are going to have many more
job opportunities."
Even non-geologists should take
introductory courses in his school,
Ernst said. By taking such classes,
they will develop a better grasp
of social issues.
"That's the liberal arts experi
ence, to do different things that
aren't necessarily your line of
work," he said.
Ernst received his bachelor's
degree from Carleton College, his
master's from the University of
Minnesota, and his doctorate from
Johns Hopkins University. His

field of expertise is petrology.
Ernst had directed UCLA's De
partment of Earth Sciences, and
more recently, its Institute of
Geophysics and Planetary
Physics.
The 6-foot-5 dean is a former
college football player and a
longtime UCLA Bruins fan. Ernst
will be in London the weekend of
the upcoming game between the
Bruins and the Cardinal.
"I love UCLA," Ernst said.
"[But] I'm going to be rooting for
Stanford, because they're paying
my salary," Ernst said.

take earth science courses will develop a better grasp of social issues.
