## Current ties with Hoover show corrupting power of money 
### 
LORD ACTON was half-right.
Money, as well as power, tends to
corrupt; together, money and
power corrupt absolutely.
The corruption of Stanford Univer
sity is a good example.
When the Faculty Senate, following
pleas by University President Donald
Kennedy, recently declined even to
study placing the Hoover Institution
(an independent, conservative think
tank) under normal academic gover
nance, the corrupting power of money
was plain for all to see.
Thirty years ago, when W. Glenn
Campbell was made director of Hoover,
its income was $389,000, its endow
ment was only $2 million, and there
were only a handful of Hoover fellows.
Today, Hoover's budget is $15.7
million, its endowment is $125 million,
its physical plant has more than
tripled in size and its 86 resident
scholars equal the number of faculty
members in the Political Science, His
tory and Economics Departments com
bined.
Hoover runs it own presses, places
hundreds of opinions articles every
year in newspapers whose combined
circulation exceeds 60 million, has a
satellite link-up so national and inter
national media can tune into Stanford

What is wrong is that Hoo
ver is an independent, po
litically active think tank

great university.

for policy opinions, and is reportedly
planning a $100 million fund drive
that will nearly double its operations
("1987 Hoover Annual Report", pp.
11-18, 104; Peter Duignan, The Hoover
Institution on War, Revolution, and
Peace, 1989, passim; and press ac
counts).
Universities need money, so what is
wrong here?
What is wrong is that Hoover is an
independent, politically active think
tank pushing programs aided by the
good name of a great university.
No university in the country has
anything like Hoover. The closest
example was Georgetown University's
Center for Strategic and International
Studies, but when CSIS embroiled
Georgetown in controversy and
mounted a fund drive, Georgetown

called in a panel of outside consultants
and severed connections with the think
tank.
As one of the consultants, Stanley
Katz of the American Council of
Learned Societies, said CSIS provided
"a valuable service, but not one to be
served by a university" (New York
Times, Nov. 28, 1987).
Stanford's mission is education.
Hoover's is policy research and ad
vocacy. The two necessarily conflict,
and Stanford necessarily pays the
price.
When, for example, the Washington
Post broke the story of the Justice
Department's report that Edwin Meese
engaged in "conduct which should not
be tolerated of any government employ
ee," Stanford received damaging na
tional publicity. Meese was identified as
"a fellow with two conservative think
tanks, the Heritage Foundation in
Washington and Stanford University's
Hoover Institution ..." (San Francisco
Chronicle, Jan. 17, 1989).
In truth, Hoover is not Stanford's
Institution. It operates independently of
Stanford, but this distinction is lost to
most people outside Stanford. The
University is regularly identified with
the activities of the conservative think
tank.
Some people say, "Oh, you just don't

to see.

like Hoover because it is conservative."
But if liberal donors offered a uni
versity millions of dollars for a
Franklin Delano Roosevelt Institution
on Social Justice, and all the univer
sity had to do to get the money was
lode the other way while the FDR
Institution pushed liberal causes, no
self-respecting institution would touch
such funds.
Why, given the obvious costs to
Stanford's reputation, doesn't the
University do something about Hoover?
W. Glenn Campbell candidly answered

this question in the New York Times:
"The average donor to a mtyor univer
sity is conservative; that's why Stan
ford would be foolish to sever its
relations with us." (Nov. 28, 1987)
People who care about Stanford's
integrity have been consistently
rebuffed by Kennedy and the Board of
Trustees, but there are some hopeful
signs. A year ago, 57 faculty members
— including a Nobel laureate, a winner
of the Mac Arthur Prize and a Pulitzer
Prize-winning historian — signed an
open letter supporting normal academic
governance. And the recent senate vote,
though won by Kennedy, was close; a
shift of just two votes would have
changed the outcome.
As long as Hoover's political arm
operates from Stanford, people will
understandably identify it with Stan
ford. But perhaps, if more people
become aware of what is going on
here, and see its importance to higher
education generally, the final outcome
may be different.
All who believe the University's only
legitimate mission is the independent
pursuit of truth have a stake in the
continuing fight at Stanford over the
Hoover Institution.
