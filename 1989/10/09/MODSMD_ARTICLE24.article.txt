I Some don twill pants and pith helmets
and hope to find the sweeping vistas made
famous by Karen Blixen. Others go in
search of the classic African wilderness
adventure.
• For these and a hundred other reasons,
Europeans and Americans have once
begun trekking — and writing —
their way across the Sahara and through
the savannahs of Africa.
From its mottled khaki book jacket, it
ip obvious that Stuart Stevens' "Malaria
Dreams" is pandering to just such a
Banana Republic audience. Told with the
wink of the long-suffering traveller who
lias had one too many gin and tonics in
tfre airport lounge, "Malaria Dreams" is
a bumpy, anecdotal account of a real trip
Stevens made through francophone
Africa.
I Stevens goes to Bangui in the Central
African Republic with vague plans to
retrieve his friend's Land Rover and drive
it back to Europe. When Stevens dis
covers that nearly everyone in the C.A.R.
considers his friend to be a diamond
smuggler, he decides to save his own skin
4ad leave the vehicle behind.
• Nevertheless he chooses to push on
V*th his overland journey through West
ern Africa and across the Sahara, inex
plicably lured by what he can only
dfscribe as the "out there."
♦An African neophyte, Stevens cheer-
Mlly confesses his near-total ignorance
of the continent. He is not helped in this
?sgard by his travelling companion, ex
faphion model Ann, who brings p&t6 and
Italian "Vogue" magazines with her from
France.
; jit is this sometimes self-deprecating,
bdbes-in-the-woods tone that dominates
tlte book. Stevens omits none of the pre
dictable African adventure themes, in
cluding insects, disease, arbitrary police
oppression, crime and corruption,
Africa seems a very ill-ordered
plfece indeed: armies of stinging ants in
vade sleeping bags, countless func
tionaries must be bribed, military border

guards seize passports and French %
doctors knowingly give AlDS
tainted blood transfusions to their
patients.
Throughout, Stevens' irony is laced
with the cynicism of The Old Africa
Hands he meets on his journey. "Foreign
aid is to the C.A.R. what cocaine is to
Colombia," he deadpans at one point. He
repeats with evident glee the claim that
one recent African ruler ate a number of
his subjects' children. Later he claims to
be adapting to Africa: now he lies to get
what he wants and ignores all advice.
An important facet, however, of
Stevens' voyage through Black Africa is
missing: Africans. Stevens plods through
the bush with his new, Gucci-shod French
friends, is saved by itinerant playboy Ital
ian auto mechanics, drinks with German
anthropology students and runs across
Polish car smugglers in the Sahara. Other
expatriates include incompetent Peace
Corps types, and cloistered American em
bassy personnel who watch "Conan the
Barbarian" on their videocassette recor
ders.
The only Africans we do meet are a
jumble of obstructionist bureaucrats,
drunken border guards, price-gouging
traders and 12-year-old fixers and
wheeler-dealers. They are people that
have been reduced to anecdotes.
Africa thus emerges in "Malaria
Dreams" as the white person's shared
private joke. "Look, we've got a real prob
lem here," Stevens tells his friend Lucien
over the telephone. "Oh yes," the dia
mond smuggler quips, "Africa."
The result is a tension, a contest, that
exists between the Africans and the Euro-
Americans in this book, one that is best

sum
marized
by an ironic
acronym creat- "1
ed by an offic
ial at the Ameri
can embassy: "WAWA," or West Africa
Wins Again.
At one point, Stevens acknowledges the
curious, white-dominated perspective he
is getting of Africa, saying, "Life in
Berbtrati continued in a pleasant colonial
bubble." True, he may be unblinkingly
reporting what he saw in his travels. But
nowhere does he try to break out or even
question the post-colonial expatriate
clique he characterizes so well and with
such humor. Amassing his stories like
trophies from a hunting expedition, he
never really seems to descend from his
Land Rover to get a feel for the land.
Thus even before opening "From Cape
to Cairo" we have reason to hope for a
more sensitive approach to Africa from
David Ewing Duncan. Eschewing Land
Rovers, motorcycles ai)d jet travel, 30-
year-old Duncan opts for a bicycle as his
mode of transport from South Africa to

II Egypt.
lj The reader is spared, however, long
discussions of the pseudo-philoso
a| phical merits of a particular de-
JA railleur or brake cable. Duncan's
' voyage is more humanistic than
metaphysical. Significantly, he
begins his story with a refer-
Wr m ence to his experiences as a
relief worker in Sudan, sur-
I M rounded by dying children.
He explains that he has chosen
W to travel through Africa because
M he feels it will help him in his
W search for "human fundamentals."
He says, "... my quest was, in a
way, a repudiation of the tendency in
our era to depend so much on numbers,
theories and quick, titillating, journalistic
sketches. I was looking for something
deeper. ..."
He is not, he underlines, a member of
"the new brigade of Africa bashers." Nor
is he a khaki romantic. Though he takes
the route of the former British Empire
it is not out of nostalgia, he tells us, but
rather to understand the folly and failure
of the enterprise.
Quickly leaving Cape Town, which he
calls a transplanted Euro-American city,
Duncan pedals out to Crossroads, the
infamous apartheid-regulated black
township. His goal, he repeats, is to
"make contact."
It is a laudable effort, though the
reader winces a bit each time Duncan
jumps from his bicycle to press his ear
nest questions on old men and children
who have grown up in the townships.
When he is removed by South African
police it almost seems to be a favor.
In contrast to Stevens' bode, however,
it is often these Africans who do the
speaking in Duncan's book. He gives an
aged village headman's rambling oral his
tory as much space as the precise com
ments of a government official who is
irritated by intruders into his first-class
train car.
Duncan fleshes out his story with back
ground and information from standard
journalistic interviews conducted with
government officials along the way. By
devoting a chapter to each country he
has the time and space to do a decent
job of fleshing out the eight countries he
travels through.
The enthusiasm and exuberance Dun
can displays in the first chapters of the
book is tested when he arrives in Zambia,
where he is attacked by a group of vil

'I found myself enjoy
ing the moment. Every
one had said I was
crazy to go to Africa,
that there were danger
ous sorts of people
and situations worth
avoiding. Now, at least,
I'd found a bit of both.'

lagers and arrested for being a South
African spy.
The arbitrary, senseless arrest shakes
him badly. It is not just because of the
immediate physical danger, but also be
cause he cannot understand why he, a
liberal white, had drawn the enmity of
a village mob. He says,"I had some
grossly misplaced conviction that this
couldn't be happening to me. No, not to
me! Not a reasonable, fair individual like
myself! I sympathized with their fears
about South Africa. I loathed apartheid
as much as the next fellow. But what
did this matter to the mob?"
Sobered by this experience and subse
quently abandoned by his original travell
ing companion, Duncan is forced to travel
alone for a time. These pages, in which
Duncan's perceptions are uncolored by
his American biking companions, are,
along with the chapter on Zimbabwe, the
best parts of the book.
It is striking that despite his initial
intentions, Duncan, like Stevens, also
ends up spending a great deal of time
with the white and expatriate communi
ties in these former British colonies. He
either camps out alone in the wilderness
or spends the night in shabby travellers'
hotels. Throughout, he cites the magor
European explorers and writers who have
come before him — including one who
made the voyage entirely on foot — and
who are his frame of reference.
He is able to "make contact" only with
white big-game guides and holdout
plantation families who hide behind
