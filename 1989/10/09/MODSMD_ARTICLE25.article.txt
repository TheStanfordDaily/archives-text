## Stanford beats the Fight out of the Irish, but loses Turnovers cost Cardinal upset opportunity 
### Chris Crader Editorial staff 
Looking at the stats from Saturday's
game with top-ranked Notre Dame, it looks
a lot like Stanford should have won.
But you don't play games on paper. The
Cardinal and the Irish played on grass
instead, and on the grass, Stanford had
three interceptions and one fumble while
Notre Dame didn't make any mistakes.
The final result was a 27-17 Irish win that
dropped the Cardinal to 1-4 on the season.

"The way we played I thought we should
have won but it didn't work out that way,"
inside linebacker Dave Garnett said. "We
got their attention but I wish we would
have gotten their attention more. By win
ning, you know."
Stanford ran more plays for more yards
and more first downs than the Fighting
Irish, but came out short in the only statis
tic that matters — the score. If nothing
else, however, the game showed how far
the Cardinal has come since the season
opening 19-3 loss at Arizona.
"Our guys played hard," Stanford Coach
Denny Green said. "Defensively we played
extremely well against an offense that
didn't make mistakes. ... Our mistakes
hurt us."
"We had five or six mental breakdowns
that really hurt us," inside linebacker Jono
Tunney said. "I thought they were good
because . .. they didn't make mistakes like
we do. .. . Mental mistakes are not accept
able at this level. We still have some of
those on our defense."
Stanford made almost no mistakes the
first quarter and the result was a 6-0 Car

dinal lead. The Cardinal defense held the
Irish to exactly zero yards of total offense
on their first three drives.
Stanford got nowhere its first two drives,
but then Steve Smith and the short passing
game took over. Stanford marched to a
third-and-five situation on the Notre Dame
30 when Smith hit Walter Batson along
the sidelines.
The bad news was that Batson couldn't
hold on to the Elwayesque high-velocity
pass, so John Hopkins came on, and he
missed a 47-yard field goal. The good news
was that an Irish player roughed Hopkins
on the attempt, giving Stanford an auto
matic first down.
Tommy Vardell lost two yards from the
15, Smith threw incomplete and then Green
inexplicably called an off-tackle run on
third and 12. He apparently wanted to get
the ball in the middle of the field for the
three-point try, but he gave up all hope of
getting the first down. Vardell got nothing,
but Hopkins made the 34-yarder to make
it 3-0.
After Stanford held Notre Dame on three
plays, the Cardinal was in business again.
The Irish punter, Craig Hentrich, made his
one bad punt of the day, giving Stanford
the ball on the Irish 32. Hopkins booted
a 42-yarder and Notre Dame was down
6-0. The Cardinal's points were the first
of the year for the team in the first quarter.
At the start of the second quarter, the
Irish offense got rolling. Quarterback Tony
Rice went 38 yards keeping the ball on the
option and Anthony Johnson gave Notre
Dame the lead with a seven-yard run on
the next play.
"They hit our seams and were able to
run in them that series," Garnett said.
"On that one drive that was a mental lapse
on our part, somewhat."

another mistake. Smith threw over the middle to
tight end Jim Price, but the throw was behind the
receiver. Price got a hand on it, but that only served
to tip the ball up in the air. Irish safety D'Juan
Francisco grabbed the ball and ran 20 yards to the
Cardinal 30.
Notre Dame's ground game drove the ball again
and scored to take a 14-6 lead into halftime.
The Cardinal mounted a drive afler stopping the
Irish, however, and a touchdown pass to Ed McCaf
frey and a one-yard run by Vardell on the conversion
(Notre Dame committed pass interference on Stan
ford's first two-point attempt to move the ball to
the one) tied it all up at 14 with only 24 minutes
left in the game.
Then, the unthinkable happened. Green had
decided to try not to kick off to Raghib Ismail, the
Irish's kickoff returner who leads the nation in that
category. Green had Hopkins kick a high ball to
the 25 the first time Stanford kicked off and the
result was a fair catch. The second time the Cardinal
kicked off, Ismail moved up and Hopkins kicked it
over his head.
To open the second half, Hopkins kicked high to
Ismail at the 20. But after Stanford tied the game,
Ismail fielded the not-high-enough kick at his 18
and ran 66 yards before Alan Grant finally caught
him. Notre Dame took four plays to score from the
16 and Stanford was down by a touchdown again.
After two consecutive non-league games, Stanford
will return to Pacific 10 Conference play this week
end at Washington State. Despite the team's 1-2
record in league play, Cardinal players are still
thinking Rose Bowl.
"We're 1-2, we've been playing hard and getting
a little better," McCaffrey said. "This week we've
got to get a lot better. We're playing a good team.
We've got to make it click. . . . We're still in the
race for the Pac-10 title."
Card notes
Stanford played the entire game without Butkus Award
finalist Rob Hinckley. The outside linebacker missed the
game due to a back injury suffered last week but should
be ready to play next week. Running back Jon Volpe may
also return next week.
On the downside, starting free safety Tony Trousset
injured his knee and may need surgery. He will definitely
be out for the WSU game. His backup, Scyon Albert,
fractured his ankle and will be out for the year. True
freshman Jimmy Klein and Herbie Berry, who was con
verted from free safety to running back two weeks ago,
will share time at that position.
Smith was 39-for-68 for 282 yards, just missing the
NCAA record for most attempts in a game. The record
is 71, set by Sandy Schwab of Northwestern in 1982
versus Michigan. The Wildcat coach that year: Denny
Green.

category. Green had Hopkins kick a high ball to
the 25 the first time Stanford kicked off and the
result was a fair catch. The second time the Cardinal
kicked off, Ismail moved up and Hopkins kicked it
over his head.
To open the second half, Hopkins kicked high to
Ismail at the 20. But after Stanford tied the game,
Ismail fielded the not-high-enough kick at his 18
and ran 66 yards before Alan Grant finally caught
him. Notre Dame took four plays to score from the
16 and Stanford was down by a touchdown again.
After two consecutive non-league games, Stanford
will return to Pacific 10 Conference play this week
end at Washington State. Despite the team's 1-2
record in league play, Cardinal players are still
thinking Rose Bowl.
"We're 1-2, we've been playing hard and getting
a little better," McCaffrey said. "This week we've
got to get a lot better. We're playing a good team.
We've got to make it click. . . . We're still in the
race for the Pac-10 title."
Card notes
Stanford played the entire game without Butkus Award
finalist Rob Hinckley. The outside linebacker missed the
game due to a back injury suffered last week but should
be ready to play next week. Running back Jon Volpe may
also return next week.
On the downside, starting free safety Tony Trousset
injured his knee and may need surgery. He will definitely
be out for the WSU game. His backup, Scyon Albert,
fractured his ankle and will be out for the year. True
freshman Jimmy Klein and Herbie Berry, who was con
verted from free safety to running back two weeks ago,
will share time at that position.
Smith was 39-for-68 for 282 yards, just missing the
NCAA record for most attempts in a game. The record
is 71, set by Sandy Schwab of Northwestern in 1982
versus Michigan. The Wildcat coach that year: Denny
Green.

Freshman Bev Oden and sophomore Kristin Klein defend for Don Shaw's Stanford
spikers. Stanford has slumped to a three-game losing streak.
Looking at the stats from Saturday's
game with top-ranked Notre Dame, it looks
a lot like Stanford should have won.
But you don't play games on paper. The
Cardinal and the Irish played on grass
instead, and on the grass, Stanford had
three interceptions and one fumble while
Notre Dame didn't make any mistakes.
The final result was a 27-17 Irish win that
dropped the Cardinal to 1-4 on the season.

"The way we played I thought we should
have won but it didn't work out that way,"
inside linebacker Dave Garnett said. "We
got their attention but I wish we would
have gotten their attention more. By win
ning, you know."
Stanford ran more plays for more yards
and more first downs than the Fighting
Irish, but came out short in the only statis
tic that matters — the score. If nothing
else, however, the game showed how far
the Cardinal has come since the season
opening 19-3 loss at Arizona.
"Our guys played hard," Stanford Coach
Denny Green said. "Defensively we played
extremely well against an offense that
didn't make mistakes. ... Our mistakes
hurt us."
"We had five or six mental breakdowns
that really hurt us," inside linebacker Jono
Tunney said. "I thought they were good
because . .. they didn't make mistakes like
we do. .. . Mental mistakes are not accept
able at this level. We still have some of
those on our defense."
Stanford made almost no mistakes the
first quarter and the result was a 6-0 Car

dinal lead. The Cardinal defense held the
Irish to exactly zero yards of total offense
on their first three drives.
Stanford got nowhere its first two drives,
but then Steve Smith and the short passing
game took over. Stanford marched to a
third-and-five situation on the Notre Dame
30 when Smith hit Walter Batson along
the sidelines.
The bad news was that Batson couldn't
hold on to the Elwayesque high-velocity
pass, so John Hopkins came on, and he
missed a 47-yard field goal. The good news
was that an Irish player roughed Hopkins
on the attempt, giving Stanford an auto
matic first down.
Tommy Vardell lost two yards from the
15, Smith threw incomplete and then Green
inexplicably called an off-tackle run on
third and 12. He apparently wanted to get
the ball in the middle of the field for the
three-point try, but he gave up all hope of
getting the first down. Vardell got nothing,
but Hopkins made the 34-yarder to make
it 3-0.
After Stanford held Notre Dame on three
plays, the Cardinal was in business again.
The Irish punter, Craig Hentrich, made his
one bad punt of the day, giving Stanford
the ball on the Irish 32. Hopkins booted
a 42-yarder and Notre Dame was down
6-0. The Cardinal's points were the first
of the year for the team in the first quarter.
At the start of the second quarter, the
Irish offense got rolling. Quarterback Tony
Rice went 38 yards keeping the ball on the
option and Anthony Johnson gave Notre
Dame the lead with a seven-yard run on
the next play.
"They hit our seams and were able to
run in them that series," Garnett said.
"On that one drive that was a mental lapse
on our part, somewhat."

another mistake. Smith threw over the middle to
tight end Jim Price, but the throw was behind the
receiver. Price got a hand on it, but that only served
to tip the ball up in the air. Irish safety D'Juan
Francisco grabbed the ball and ran 20 yards to the
Cardinal 30.
Notre Dame's ground game drove the ball again
and scored to take a 14-6 lead into halftime.
The Cardinal mounted a drive afler stopping the
Irish, however, and a touchdown pass to Ed McCaf
frey and a one-yard run by Vardell on the conversion
(Notre Dame committed pass interference on Stan
ford's first two-point attempt to move the ball to
the one) tied it all up at 14 with only 24 minutes
left in the game.
Then, the unthinkable happened. Green had
