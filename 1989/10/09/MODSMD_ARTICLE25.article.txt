## Stanford beats the Fight out of the Irish, but loses Turnovers cost Cardinal upset opportunity 
### Chris Crader Editorial staff 
Looking at the stats from Saturday's
game with top-ranked Notre Dame, it looks
a lot like Stanford should have won.
But you don't play games on paper. The
Cardinal and the Irish played on grass
instead, and on the grass, Stanford had
three interceptions and one fumble while
Notre Dame didn't make any mistakes.
The final result was a 27-17 Irish win that
dropped the Cardinal to 1-4 on the season.

"The way we played I thought we should
have won but it didn't work out that way,"
inside linebacker Dave Garnett said. "We
got their attention but I wish we would
have gotten their attention more. By win
ning, you know."
Stanford ran more plays for more yards
and more first downs than the Fighting
Irish, but came out short in the only statis
tic that matters — the score. If nothing
else, however, the game showed how far
the Cardinal has come since the season
opening 19-3 loss at Arizona.
"Our guys played hard," Stanford Coach
Denny Green said. "Defensively we played
extremely well against an offense that
didn't make mistakes. ... Our mistakes
hurt us."
"We had five or six mental breakdowns
that really hurt us," inside linebacker Jono
Tunney said. "I thought they were good
because . .. they didn't make mistakes like
we do. .. . Mental mistakes are not accept
able at this level. We still have some of
those on our defense."
Stanford made almost no mistakes the
first quarter and the result was a 6-0 Car

dinal lead. The Cardinal defense held the
Irish to exactly zero yards of total offense
on their first three drives.
Stanford got nowhere its first two drives,
but then Steve Smith and the short passing
game took over. Stanford marched to a
third-and-five situation on the Notre Dame
30 when Smith hit Walter Batson along
the sidelines.
The bad news was that Batson couldn't
hold on to the Elwayesque high-velocity
pass, so John Hopkins came on, and he
missed a 47-yard field goal. The good news
was that an Irish player roughed Hopkins
on the attempt, giving Stanford an auto
matic first down.
Tommy Vardell lost two yards from the
15, Smith threw incomplete and then Green
inexplicably called an off-tackle run on
third and 12. He apparently wanted to get
the ball in the middle of the field for the
three-point try, but he gave up all hope of
getting the first down. Vardell got nothing,
but Hopkins made the 34-yarder to make
it 3-0.
After Stanford held Notre Dame on three
plays, the Cardinal was in business again.
The Irish punter, Craig Hentrich, made his
one bad punt of the day, giving Stanford
the ball on the Irish 32. Hopkins booted
a 42-yarder and Notre Dame was down
6-0. The Cardinal's points were the first
of the year for the team in the first quarter.
At the start of the second quarter, the
Irish offense got rolling. Quarterback Tony
Rice went 38 yards keeping the ball on the
option and Anthony Johnson gave Notre
Dame the lead with a seven-yard run on
the next play.
"They hit our seams and were able to
run in them that series," Garnett said.
"On that one drive that was a mental lapse
on our part, somewhat."

The Stanford defense turned in its best performance of the year Saturday, but Notre Dame's arsenal was too much
for the Cardinal.
