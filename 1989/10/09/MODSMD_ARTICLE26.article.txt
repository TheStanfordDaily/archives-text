# Moral victory may lead to conference wins down the road

Fifteen more plays from scrimmage.
Five more first downs. Twenty yards
more total offense. Seven fewer penalties.
, Four ifiorfc turnovers. Ten fewer points.
One more loss.
Going by the numbers, that's the story
of Saturday's Stanford-Notre Dame
game. A contest in which one No. 1 team
in the nation, riding a 16-game winning
streak came in to face a Cardinal squad
with one win in four tries — though the
victory did come against a top-20 team.
Expecting a blowout, the oddsmakers
spotted the Irish over 20 points. ABC
saw Notre Dame trounce Purdue last
week and decided to pass on televising
this one. For all his woofing, Fighting
Irish Coach Lou Holtz had to figure it
would be an easy day.
Stanford had scored only 70 points en

tering the game (33 of which came against
a mediocre San Jose State defense). And,
the Irish buried the Cardinal by a 42-14
count last year.
Instead of the prognosticated shellack
ing, though, the first non-Big Game sel
lout crowd in Stanford Stadium since
USC came to visit on Oct. 9, 1980 saw
an excellent football game. From both
teams. A feat made all the more impres
sive when one considers the Cardinal was
minus its top defensive player and a
troika of its best running backs.
Before the coin toss, the entire Notre

Dame team stepped up to the hash marks
in a show of support. The entire Stanford
squad followed, and the crowd roared.
After Steve Smith hooked up with Jim
Price for the game's initial first down,
the crowd roared again.
Loud cheers followed each of the Car
dinal's first two field goals that gave
Stanford a 6-0 lead, and made it seem
likely that a lot of bettors were going to
lose a lot of money.
It's likely the ABC execs were banging
their head against the wall, as well. The
first quarter came to a close with the
Irish trailing for the first time since Rice
led 3-0 Nov. 5 of last year.
When the Irish responded with a three
play blitzkrieg touchdown drive, the most
interesting off--''he-field event of the day
ensued. As Notre Dame set up to kick
off, the numerous Irish partisans
amongst the 86,000 in attendance began
making noise.

The usually silent Stanford contingent
responded by booing. Then, suddenly
satisfied with their ability to out-noise
the Irish fans, the Cardinal contingent
began to cheer for the home team. No
statistics are kept on decibel level, but
from this perspective it was the noisiest
moment in Stanford Stadium in five
years.
By halftime, an eight-point Notre Dame
lead had quieted things a bit — except
on the sideline. As center Chuck Gilling
ham explained, "They didn't dominate
the line of scrimmage, on either side."
Though they were supposed to.
It was clear enough to the Stanford
players that the game was far from over,
that they could beat the defending na
tional champions.
They have developed that attitude all
season. "When we went into the game,"
Smith said, "it didn't matter if they were
No. 1 or No. 800." The Cardinal didn't

go out to look "respectable," they went
out to win.
With 8:48 left to play in the third, it
seemed like Stanford just might ac
complish its goal. An Ed McCaffrey
touchdown reception followed by a
Tommy Vardell run on the two-point con
version attempt knotted everything at 14
apiece.
The same Stanford team that commit
ted so many offensive and defensive mis
takes a week ago against the Spartans
was playing as well as the best team in
college football. And everyone in the sta
dium, including the players and coaches
on both sidelines, knew it.
Unfortunately, this sweet moment (an
English teacher from back when said
James Joyce called it the "epiphany")
was short-lived.
In that aforementioned Rice game, im
mediately after the Owls kicked their
field goal Raghib "Rocket" Ismail
took the ensuing kickoff at the
Irish 13 and ran it 87 yards for
a touchdown. Rice never led again.
Rocket took off again Saturday
at just the right time. John Hop
kins, who had been trying to kick

the ball short to someone other
than Ismail, booted one to the
Notre Dame 18.
Ismail, who hadn't had the ball
come his way since singlehandedly
beating Michigan with two TD
returns, was ready. He took the
kick and sprinted down the field
66 yards. A saving tackle by Alan
Grant was the only thing that
kept Ismail from scoring.
Still, the damage was done. The
Cardinal's moment of momentum
was gone. The feeling of elation
on the Stanford sideline proved
as ephemeral as a dandelion in a
summer breeze.
When the gun sounded and the
scoreboard read Notre Dame 27,
Stanford 17 there was no joy to
be found among the Cardinal
players, no sense of satisfaction
at playing well against the best
in the sport. It was another loss
and with it came a good deal of
self-criticism.

"We made mistakes," line
backer Jono Tunney said bluntly.
"[lt was] not just getting beat. It
was direct assignment mistakes
directly responsible for them get
ting points."
Tunney explained that on
several occasions defensive
players simply failed to cover the
players they were supposed to. He
blamed the lapses on a "lack of
concentration" — nothing more,
nothing less.
On the other hand, Tunney
pointed to two things which bode
well for the future. "I've never

seen coaches do a better job of
putting us in position to make
the plays," he said, noting the
defense knew exactly what they'd
have to do to stop Notre Dame.
After last year and the first few
games this season when the de
fense became visibly frustrated at
the offense's inability to put points
on the board, things are looking
up.
"Once you do your job (on de
fense), they're going to take the
ball down and score," he added.
Still, amidst all the silver
linings, Tunney described the

dark cloud: "We have not played
60 minutes of good football."
Gillingham echoed the senti
ment and cited the turnovers as
crucial. "We don't turn the ball
over when we do, we win this
game," he said. "We beat the No.
1 team in the country."
Saturday it wasn't meant to be.
Rest assured, however, Stanford
will be as well prepared when it
takes on Washington State next
week. Maybe then the Cardinal
will come out on top in the only
numbers game that counts — the
final score.
