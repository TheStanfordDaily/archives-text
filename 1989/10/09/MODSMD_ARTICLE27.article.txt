# Card sets the pace at Stanford Invitational
## 
### Ed Pike Staff writer 
"No Trespassing, No Jogging"
reads the sign on the ninth hole
of the Stanford Golf Course. Any
casual joggers violating that sign
Saturday would have been
trampled by the 180 teams of
serious runners competing at the
Stanford-Holiday Inn Invitational
cross country meet.
The Cardinal men took second
in their first real test of the
season and the women finished
eighth out of a field of 13 in the
women's 5,000-meter race. Carol
Gray led the team with a 10th
place finish.
Over 1,000 athletes competed
Saturday, making a mockery of
traditional golf course rules. Sixty
college and 120 high school teams
ran Saturday, the first time both
events have been staged on the
same day.
The meet attracted high school
teams from as far away as New
Mexico and Oregon, making
Holiday Inn an obvious sponsor.
The top high school teams were
Camarillo in the boys' race and
Arroyo Grande in the girls'.
Recruiting aside, the men had
one goal going into this meet —
to repeat last year's dramatic vic
tory.
The men are aiming for the
NCAA Championships, and this
weekend's race was a good in
dicator of where they stand so far.
Arizona, ranked sixth in the na
tion, won the race with 51 points,
while Stanford tied UCLA at 109
despite competing without Eric
Mastalir. Even with him, however,
the Cardinal would have had a
difficult time keeping pace with
the Wildcats.
Stanford used the strategy that
led the men to win this race last
year — start in front and hang
on Seniors Mark Mastalir and Bill
Crowley and junior Jason Martin
started the race with eventual
winner Mark Davis of Arizona.
Sophomore Dave Scudamore also

ran to the front.
"I knew I had to get out so I
didn't get boxed in," said Crowley
This year's race was cut from
10,000 meters to 8,000 meters to
reflect this year's shorter Pacific
10 Conference Championships, so
the start became more important
than usual.
"We were winning the race at
the three-mile mark", said Coach
Scott Chisam. "Every one of the
top five people slipped back at
least two spots."
Mastalir was the top individual
finisher for Stanford, taking fifth
in 24:27. Mastalir ran a season
best time, with Crowley 12th in
24:49. Despite the fast start, both

ran even splits over both halves
of the course.
The men put all their compet
itors in the top half of the field
as Stanford showed talent and
depth.
Stanford has needed that depth,
with top returnee Eric Mastalir
training but held out of competi
tion until the Pac-10 meet.
The women also got off to a
good start, but could not back up
their top two runners. Gray
finished 10th in 17:41, followed
closely by junior Melanie Bloch in
12th.
Freshmen Ashley Black, Amy
McColl and Jill Shenkel ran in
their first home meet Saturday

and fared well, as did juniors
Jamie Fallon and Wendy Neely.
"We made a big improvement
since Ohio State" two weeks ago,
Chisam said. Chisam is hoping to
move into the top five at the Pac
-10 meet.
The women moved up one place
from last year's finish. With All-
American Gray back from her in
juries of last spring and Bloch
running well, the women may also
take individual honors at the con
ference meet.
Gray, who finished second in
the district meet last year, should
improve as the season continues.
"The men's goal is to win the
Pac-10", said Chisam.

"We made a big improvement
since Ohio State" two weeks ago,
Chisam said. Chisam is hoping to
move into the top five at the Pac
-10 meet.
The women moved up one place
from last year's finish. With All-
American Gray back from her in
juries of last spring and Bloch
running well, the women may also
take individual honors at the con
ference meet.
Gray, who finished second in
the district meet last year, should
improve as the season continues.
"The men's goal is to win the
Pac-10", said Chisam.
