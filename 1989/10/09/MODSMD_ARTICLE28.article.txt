# Men's soccer rocked by powerful Bruins
## 
### Andrew Wilcox Staff writer 
The best referee is usually
the one who draws little atten
tion, but yesterday the Cardi
nal men's soccer team had to
battle not only the No. 2 UCLA
Bruins in Los Angeles, but an
officiating crew which seemed
very inconsistent.
After maintaining a scoreless
deadlock with the Bruins for
90 minutes, Stanford was vic
timized by what appeared to
be several questionable calls
which helped UCLA to a 2-0
victory. The Bruins moved to
11-0-1 with the win and should
ascend to the top spot in the
polls following No. 1 Virginia's
loss last week.

The Cardinal loss, coupled
with a 2-0 defeat at the hands
of San Diego State Friday
night, not only snapped a four
game winning streak but also
dropped the squad to 6-6-1 and
dealt a harsh to blow to its
NCAA playoff aspirations.
The turning point yesterday
came only three minutes into
the first overtime period, when
Cardinal fullback Tim Keyes
was whistled for a tripping in
fraction in the penalty box, set
ting up a UCLA penalty kick.
After Bruin midfielder Cobi
Jones received a through pass
in the middle, Keyes gave chase
and appeared to make a legal
backtackle to defuse the threat.
However, Jones took a dive in
the hopes of convincing the ref
eree Keyes had tripped him.

The acting job worked, as an
official standing near the mid
field line awarded the Bruins
a penalty kick, much to the
Cardinal's disbelief. "I came up
from behind him, and I thought
I kicked it cleanly out of
bounds. I guess the ref didn't
see it clearly," Keyes said.
Stanford Coach Sam Koch
had barely started protesting
before he was assessed a red
card and ejected from the
game, this despite the fact that
Koch had not yet received a
yellow warning card, as is
standard procedure.
Once the commotion died
down, Bruin sweeper and co
captain Will Steadman coolly
drilled in the free kick to give
UCLA a 1-0 cushion.
"It was disappointing to have
the game played even for 90
minutes and then have the out
come decided by the referee's
decision. The result was hard
to take because we deserved
better," Koch said.
The Stanford booters soon
found themselves trying to
overcome the deficit with a
one-man disadvantage as
fullback Brandon Farley was
also slapped with a red card
and ejected. Farley, attempting
to prevent a breakaway, took
down Bruin fullback Mike Lap
per with a blatant trip, and the
Cardinal played with 10 men
the rest of the way.
The Bruins' Jones provided
the final 2-0 margin with only
one minute led, scoring on a
breakaway after eluding Cardi
nal sweeper Mark Semioli.
Although Stanford failed to
score for the second straight
game, it was not for lack of
opportunities.
