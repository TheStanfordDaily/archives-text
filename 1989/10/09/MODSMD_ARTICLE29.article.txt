# Booters bombard GWU
## Stanford scores three goals in overtime 
### Michael Clayton Staff writer 
For nearly 85 minutes yester
day, the Stanford women's soccer
team enjoyed an easy Sunday
morning cruise; however, just
before finishing the drive, a pesky
opponent pulled up next to the
Cardinal and issued a challenge
in the race to the finish line.
With the challenger in sight, the
Cardinal relinquished its calcu
lated energy conservation, pushed
on the accelerator, and sped by
the run-down car to the victory
circle.

Cardinal 4 (0T)
Colonials 1

In their first regular season
home game since Sept. 17, the
Stanford women played George
Washington (6-7-1) to a 1-1 regula
tion deadlock yesterday before
breaking away with three goals
in the first seven minutes of over
time to record a 4-1 win.
"We had to be pleased with the
overtime effort," freshman stand
out Julie Foudy said. "Before
overtime, however, we just
seemed to be hangin' in there."
Stanford, 7-3, dominated field
play in the first half of the game,
releasing a bevy of strong shots
on goal and controlling the ball
in the Cardinal offensive half for
over 35 minutes of the 45-minute
half. However, despite the con
stant pressure, the Cardinal
women were unable to convert

any shots into goals against
Colonial keeper Lora Mozer.
The Cardinal field domination
continued in the second half, and,
with less than five minutes ex
pired, senior Blair Elliott was
taken down by a hard Colonial
tackle within the penalty box.
Foudy converted the penalty kick,
her ninth goal of the season, to
put the Cardinal ahead 1-0.
With the security goal, the Car
dinal seemed to fall back into
cruise control, content to walk
away with the 1-0 victory. George
Washington, which had lost
Thursday night 4-0 to Santa Clara
and had beaten the University of
San Francisco 2-0 Saturday after
noon, could muster no offensive
threat besides a few transient op
portunities off corner kicks. The
Colonials were unable to maintain
possession of the ball for any sus
tained period throughout the sec
ond half, and the Cardinal
continued to quietly dominate.
However, with less than five
minutes left in the game, George
Washington surprised the drowsy
Cardinal team. Colonial
midfielder Lisa Zifcak snuck by
Stanford freshman Leni Nonos
hita and pushed the ball under
Cardinal goalie Elise Edwards'
hands to tie the score at 1-1. The
elated Colonials held off a furious
Stanford attack for the next four
minutes to preserve the regula
tion deadlock.
Stanford did not waste any of
the 30 minutes of overtime to se
cure the victory. Playing with
renewed energy, freshman Kirby
Seale chipped the ball onto
Foudy's foot less than one minute

into overtime. Foudy, who had
been shadowed throughout the
game with double and triple cov
erage, caught the pass and, with
the outside of her foot, pushed
the ball under the charging Mozer
to score her second goal of the
morning.
Five minutes later, junior Jen
nifer "Rocket" Rowland made the
score 3-1. Rowland converted her
10th goal of the season by picking
up a clearing pass from classmate
Lisa Sime at midfield, accelerated
past the sole defender, and then
dribbled around Mozer to roll the
ball into the net.
Not to be forgotten in the
rushed onslaught, less than 30
seconds later, freshman Carolyn
Einstein picked up a pass from
Rowland on the right side of the
goal and squeezed the ball
through a tiny angle under
Mozer's outstretched hands into
the left corner of the net.
The win breaks a three-game
losing streak for the 16th-ranked
Cardinal in which all three losses
were by one goal on the road to
top-20 teams.
Card notes
Fans at the game Sunday were
awakened from the slothful second
half pace by a little canine entertain
ment. After Potok and Colonial Beth
Rife collided and fell to the ground,
a black labrador attempted to make
his mark on the game. The dog
jumped around the field and onto the
players and refused to leave while his
owner frantically attempted to grab
his collar. Players and fans chuckled
at the brief excitement during the
suspension of play.
