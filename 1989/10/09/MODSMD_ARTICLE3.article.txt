# SCAAN targets CIA
## Group dumps 'corpses' in White Plaza 
### Wendie Schneider 
Shortly before noon Friday, a recruiter
at the Career Faire jokingly remarked to
a colleague that the CIA was getting a lot
of attention from students "who all must
want to go to Panama."
Not quite all.
A few minutes later, members of the
Stanford Central American Action Network
in military camouflage deposited nine
"corpses" — Stanford students made up to
resemble the victims of alleged CIA political
killings — at the feet of the recruiting team.
The body dump attracted attention at
the well-attended fair, with people gather
ing in anticipation before the actual event.
However, the crowd of bystanders never
numbered more than 50 students.
And most Stanford students seemed
more concerned with making it from table
to table than making a political statement.
SCAAN member Marcia Klotz said the
protest was aimed at violent covert activi
ties conducted by the CIA. Although
SCAAN focuses on Central American
events, members said the protest was di
rected more generally at CIA activities
worldwide, including political assassi
nations.
SCAAN members led chants questioning
their fellow students who persisted in ap
proaching the CIA table during the course
of the protest: "The CIA is no career; it's
a life of killing and fear."
Members of the CIA recruiting team,
seemingly unfazed by the protest, went on
with their recruiting efforts. CIA personnel
officer Wendell Lewis said he had "no com
ment" on the protest. He noted that stu
dents have the right to protest and the
CIA was "that kind of agency that does

attract attention."
Lewis was unwilling to give out details
of the jobs for which he was recruiting but
said students could expect to "participate
in worldwide information gathering."
Lewis could not recall encountering any
protests in his past visits to Stanford, but
said that in his experiences with protests
at other universities, the CIA tended to
receive a few more resumes than otherwise
because of the extra attention.
Michael Baek, a graduate student in Op
erations Research, said his views of the
CIA were unchanged by the protest, and,
"if anything, the protest helped me find
the table." Other students said they were
confused about the subject of the protest.
SCAAN members Steve Levitsky and Ben
Robinson said they would like to see CIA
prohibited from recruiting at Stanford. In
their opinion, the CLA represents covert
and subversive activity "that does not have
a place on a campus that represents open
ness and the freedom of debate," Levitsky
said.
Ruth Schneider, director of the Career
Planning and Placement Center, which
sponsored the fair, said that while students
certainly had the right to protest, she was
concerned they might be blocking other
students' access to the exhibitors in the fair.
She said as long as exhibitors meet
federal anti-discrimination legislation and
do not engage in unlawful activities they
are allowed to participate in the fair.
According to Schneider, no one has been
prohibited from attending the fair on those
grounds, and she does not foresee the CIA
"as a legitimate government agency" being
banned from the Stanford campus. She
