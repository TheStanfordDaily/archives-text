# Henderson leads A's to the promised land

TORONTO (AP) - The
most fitting way to preserve
Rickey Henderson's brilliant
playoff performance may be the
same one his World Series op
ponents push for as early as
next week — with one impor
tant twist.
Bronze Rickey's shoes — but
leave him in them.
"Speed," Toronto manager
Cito Gaston said Sunday after
Rickey's wrecking crew put the
finishing touches on the
demolition of his Blue Jays
with a 4-3 win for a five-game
playoff victory. "If I had to is
olate the one thing that's most
dangerous about him, it's his
speed.
"A walk to him is almost the
same thing as a triple. A single
is almost a triple," Gaston con
tinued in a mournful tone, al
most shivering at the memory.
"There's very few safe options
with a guy like him."
Rickey Henderson is 31 and
nearing the peak of his powers,
something that should give
pause to virtually everyone
that plays against him from
here on out.
He was instrumental in each
of Oakland's four victories, but
showcased a different talent in
each. The Most Valuable Player
award certified that much, but
left the biggest question still
unanswered.
"Can I get any better?" Hen
derson said. "I don't know. I'd

just love to continue playing as
well as I have. Anything can
happen. This time of year can
bring some things out of you
that you don't even know you
had."
In Game 1, he broke up a
double play by hitting Blue
Jays second baseman Nelson
Liriano with such velocity and
ferocity that Liriano's feeble,
and ultimately, wild relay to
first enabled the tying and win
ning Oakland runs to score. In
Game 2, Henderson stole four
bases, almost single-handedly
creating two runs, and man
aged to enrage the Blue Jays,
and get called a hot dog in the
bargain by Toronto catcher
Ernie Whitt, by tiptoeing the
last few steps on an uncon
tested steal of second base.
In Game 4, he flipped the
power switch and hit a pair of
two-run home runs. In Sun
day's clincher, Henderson
scored Oakland's first run after
walking to start the game,
stealing second and scoring on
Jose Canseco's single. He
muscled a triple two innings
later to score Oakland's second
run.
In this playoff peformance,
the whole was greater than the
sum of its parts. Henderson en
tertained with his skill, upset
his opponents with his flam
boyance, and ultimately made
winners of the teammates who
were along for the ride.
