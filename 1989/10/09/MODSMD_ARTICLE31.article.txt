## Mystifying losing streak continues 
### David Earnest Senior staff writer 
When the Stanford women's vol
leyball team lost to No. 2 UCLA
Thursday night, it was a tough,
five-game defeat that Stanford
could have won. But if Thursday's
loss was heartbreaking, then Fri
day night's defeat at the hands of
llth-ranked USC could be fatal.
The Cardinal dropped its third
straight match, losing to the
Women of Troy 15-11, 15-6, 16-14.

After losing to the Bruins, Stan
ford, now 4-3 in the Pacific 10
Conference, entered the match
against USC with an 8-4 record
and many questions surrounding
the iryury-plagued team. The loss
to the Trojans provided no
answers and only generated more
concerns.
"USC played the best I've ever
seen them," Stanford Coach Don
Shaw said. "It was a tough three
game match. For most of the
match we played very well."
But Shaw finds little consola
tion in some of the improvements
he saw in his team.
"We played better than we
played the night before [against
UCLA.] That's always our goal,
to improve," Shaw said. "It was
a moral victory for us. But a moral
victory is unfortunately not what
we need right now.
"I have a hard time remember
ing the last time we lost three
straight matches. I don't like
losing. I don't believe in moral
victories."
But the Cardinal did find the
one ingredient that Shaw has said
all season is missing from the
team's formula — consistency.

straight games, a fact that comes
as close to pleasing Shaw as any
thing over the weekend could.
"We played pretty smart [on
Friday], but USC played great,"
he said. "And our players off the
bench did a very good job."
Shaw made several substitu
tions in the third game of the
match. Senior hitter Jessica Ben
ton played her "best match at
Stanford," according to Shaw, and
juniors Cheryl Conly and Tracy
Hughes provided backcourt sup
port for the offense in the third
game.
"[The substitutes] played well
and started getting the ball to the
middle," Shaw said. "Bev [Oden]
played a good hitting game."
Stanford was able to post better
team and individual statistics to
reflect their improved, more con
sistent play. Benton hit .500 with
no hitting errors and Oden posted
a .424 hitting percentage. The
team was able to hit .250 for the
match, 85 points higher than in
the UCLA match and considerably
improved from most of its previ
ous matches.
But the Women of Troy played
stellar volleyball to counter Stan
ford's improved offense. Three of
USC's starting six hit better than
.400 and the team posted an un
believable match hitting percent
age of .335.
"I don't think overall we can
be proud of the way we're play
ing," he said. "And that's what's
frustrating."
