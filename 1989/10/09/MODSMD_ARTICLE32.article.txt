### T.C. Hall Staff writer 
The funny thing about the
game-winning shot in Stanford's
8-7 victory against the Anteaters
of UC-Irvine was that the guy
who scored it was not even think
ing "goal."
"I was trying to make a high,
hard shot," junior holeman Rick
McNair said. "I was thinking it
would get tipped out or hit the
cross bar and bounce back. I just
wanted to get a new shot clock."

Cardinal 8
Anteaters 7

With only two seconds left on
the shot clock this was smart
thinking, yet McNair did himself
one better — he scored. The goal
put the Cardinal up 8-6, and with
1:40 left in the game, gave the
team the cushion it needed to win.
As the crowd cheered, McNair

raised his arm and gave it a vic
tory pump. "It was really intense
today," McNair said later, "the
momentum pulled you along."
The second- and fifth-ranked
teams started the game showing
why the top five is so even. Both
teams came up and down the pool
alternately pressing on defense
and tossing the ball around
looking for the good shot. Irvine
had more problem with this as
twice their 35 second clock ran
out. The only goal of the quarter
came when senior Eric Blum
scored from two meters.
The second quarter saw the
Stanford offense come alive. The
quarter started inauspiciously as
a Jeff Oeding penalty allowed Ir
vine a six-on-five opportunity that
Julian Harvey used to even the
score 1-1. Chuck Maguy scored to
get Stanford back on top, but Har
vey showed why he was a member
of the national team as he made
a strong move at two meters and
once again evened up the score.
This proved to be the end of

the Irvine offense in the first half.
A backhand goal by McNair
brought the Cardinal back into
the lead 3-2 and an Irvine penalty
allowed Rick Millham to bring the
score to 4-2 and give the Cardinal
some breathing space.
Stanford won the fourth quar
ter sprint and used it to again go
up by three on SwerdlofFs second
goal of the game, but still Irvine
was not out of it. A four-meter
penalty shot allowed Warde to
bring the score to 7-5, and when
Eric Blum got ejected for his third
mayor penalty Irvine went up on
a 6-5 advantage and Warde tallied
his third goal of the game.
Suddenly it was a one goal game
and time was running out.
Stanford Coach Dante Det
tamanti, however, was not fazed.
"A team coming back is just
the nature of the game," said Det
tamanti. "I just told my guys that
they had to keep up the intensity."
The Stanford players did just
that.
