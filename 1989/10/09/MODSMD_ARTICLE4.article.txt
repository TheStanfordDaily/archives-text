# Abortion activists hit, miss in demonstrations

Stanford students on both sides of
the abortion issue were involved in
several demonstrations over the week
end, and at least three were arrested.
Stanford students Beth Bailey, Ken
Windus and Tim Moes joined the ranks
of the 96 Operation Rescue demon
strators who were booked and charged
with trespassing in an anti-abortion
demonstration in San Rafael Saturday.
Fearing that Operation Rescue was
planning to "hit" another Planned
Parenthood Clinic in San Mateo, about
25 pro-choice Stanford students,
alumni and employees rolled out of
bed at 5 a.m. the same morning to
perform a "defense" of that clinic.
The Stanford Pro-Choice Alliance
joined 60 others clad in matching white
T-shirts emblazoned with "pro-choice"
across the back who waited in front
of the clinic.
Reports from the network of infor
mants calling themselves the Bay Area

Coalition Against Operation Rescue
started trickling in to the groggy par
ticipants at about 8 a.m., indicating
the Operation Rescue vans and buses
were in motion.
Updated reports led the would-be
protesters to believe first that the anti
abortion group was not coming, then
that it was, and finally confirmed that
the caravan had chosen the San Rafael
clinic.
Reactions among the pro-choice
would-be demonstrators were mixed.
Some were relieved that the rally
would not occur at the facility, while
others were unhappy that they had
risen so early for nothing.
The Planned Parenthood coordina
tor assured the early risers that their
presence had been seen by Operation
Rescue scouts and if they had not been
at the clinic, it might have been "hit."
Operation Rescue regularly protests
in front of abortion clinics and tries
to prevent women from entering. There
were around 200 anti-abortion dem-

onstrators at the Sari Rafael clinic and
about the same number of Planned
Parenthood pro-choice alliance mem
bers attempting to keep the pathway
clear to the Marin County facility.
Both sides claimed victory in the
demonstration. Planned Parenthood
executive director Mary Jo Lazear
said, "They aren't stopping a single
abortion from being done," as most
were to be rescheduled or rerouted.
But Janice Keen, Stanford Students
for Life co-president, claimed that one
out of five women who miss their ap
pointments do not come back.
Windus, an Operation Rescue mem
ber who was arrested, asserted that
the "rescue" was "an effective way to

get the point across." No one was able
to enter the facility, and Windus
claimed, "No one would have wanted
to go through that crowd."
No violence was reported other than
the "usual pushing and shoving," he
said.
Several Stanford Pro-Choice Alli
ance members took part in a another,
smaller incident in Sunnyvale Friday.
According to Vince Ricci, who took
part in the demonstration, the Oper
ation Rescue members did not break
any laws during the demonstration,
but merely passed out literature, sang
and prayed.
Only a small crowd from each side
was on hand and again no violence
was reported, but Ricci said, "It was
like a battle.... It was really tense."
Both Planned Parenthood and Op
eration Rescue members predicted
more incidents in the coming year.
Large demonstrations occur approxi
mately once a month, according to
Windus.
