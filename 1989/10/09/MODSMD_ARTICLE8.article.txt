# Amid controversy, watchdog put to sleep

### Ken Yew Staff writer 
Lab technicians say Rosie was a well
loved watchdog and "mascot" to them,
protecting them at night.
But administrators at Stanford ani
mal laboratories say she was a danger
ous dog who "went after" lab employees
and was not suitable for adoption.
On the administrators' orders, Rosie
was put to sleep Friday.
Rosie, a 60-pound female pit bull and
boxer mix, worked at the Medical Cen
ter's Department of Laboratory Animal
Medicine for four years. Originally pur
chased for research, lab technicians at
the department took a liking to her and
convinced administrators to let her be
their watchdog and mascot.
"She loved us. She was a great dog,"
said Animal Health Technician Deborah
Britt, who had offered to adopt the dog
and accept legal responsibility for her.
After night watchmen were hired,
however, the dog only served as a blood
donor for research purposes. When a
new group of dogs was purchased for
this function, Rosie served no purpose
at the center and department adminis
trators decided to euthanize her.
According to Britt, Dr. Thomas
Hamm, director of the department,
agreed to let her adopt the dog four
weeks ago, but then announced Friday
the dog would be destroyed. Britt said
she pleaded with Hamm to let Rosie
live, even offering to pay $6 a day for
her board fees, but Hamm still decided
to kill the dog.
Hamm denies he told Britt she could
adopt the dog. "Even if I wasn't legally
responsible ... I'd still have a moral

and ethical responsibility" to keep the
dog out of the community, he said.
"What if some little kid cornered the
dog and got hurt? I'd never forgive
myself.
"The decision was made simply be
cause the dog was dangerous," he said.
Britt said Hamm's decision may have
been influenced by "a long history of
personal conflicts" between Britt and
Hamm.
Calling Britt "a disgruntled employ
ee," Hamm said, "I wouldn't let an an
imal suffer because of Debbie Britt."
Britt has been involved in a compa
rable worth labor dispute between the
United Stanford Workers union and the
University. Hamm said her involvement
was not a factor in his decision, but
speculated that she was trying to make
his department look bad. "Anything that
comes up, there's Debbie Britt," he said.
Animal Care Supervisor Reese Zasio
said the dog was not deemed safe
enough to be allowed to be adopted.
Zasio said that when the dog was orig
inally purchased, she tended to act ag
gressively, "growling and snarling, par
ticularly at men."
Zasio said that because the dog was
so aggressive, she was restricted to only
certain areas of the department.
Veterinary Nurse Susan Montana,
who worked with Rosie, said the dog
was not aggressive at all. "She was not
a biter. She didn't even come close to
it." Montana said Rosie could act ag
gressively toward strangers, but only as
a display. "She could put on quite a
show," she said. "That's what made her
an excellent watchdog."
Former Animal Health Technician
Eileen Osaki, who worked in the de

partment with Rosie for two years,
agreed, calling Rosie a "sweet, rather
submissive dog. 1 never once saw her
bite or attempt to bite anyone. ... She
was a member of the team."
Osaki added that Rosie was especially
close to Britt and another technician,
who is male. "It's not true that Rosie
was aggressive toward males â€” or
females," she said.
Montana said the dog was safe enough
to act as a companion "alone with a
woman all night long." She added that
Rosie was affectionate with male lab
technicians and did not act particularly
aggressive toward them.
Britt said she spent three and a half
years with Rosie alone at night, five
nights a week and never saw her bite
anyone. "You could stick your hand in
her mouth and she wouldn't do any
thing," she said.
But Hamm said, "[Rosie] had gone
after me a couple of times. ... I per
sonally knew it was a dangerous dog."
Zasio said the dog "did get along with
some people but there were others she
didn't like."
Patricia Elsen, president of the Palo
Alto Humane Society, said the dog may
not have liked certain people, "but
sometimes [dogs] don't like certain
people for good reason." She said the
Humane Society offered to have the dog
independently evaluated by experts to
determine whether the dog was a dan
ger. However, Elsen said, department
officials were determined to go ahead
with killing the dog.
Elsen added that there is a tendency
in biomedical research "to regard
animals as objects which are disposable,
like tissue."
