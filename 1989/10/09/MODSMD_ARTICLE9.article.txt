MacFest under the big top
The big top came to town last week,
but it was filled with marvels slightly
more technical than tigers and clowns.
The fifth annual MacFest, a three-day
event where companies demonstrated
Apple-related hardware and software
and raised a huge, white tent last Wed
nesday to hawk their wares.
Barry Crist, an Apple employee, de
scribed it as "a high-tech county fair."
Though some applications are scien
tifically oriented, MacFest was not for
the computer expert. "The whole intent
of MacFest is to reach out to people who
are not computer-literate and to show
them how easy it is," said Margie
Kriebel, the Apple account executive for
Stanford.
Traditionally held at Tresidder, the
Apple-sponsored affair moved to Wilbur
Field this year. Kriebel said, "We needed
more space, and we wanted to make it
a festival atmosphere."
With 64 companies displaying well
over 100 products, MacFest enjoyed a
huge success. Wednesday night's
invitation-only VIP event drew over 600
members of the faculty and staff, and
over 4,000 students visited the fair
Thursday and Friday.

Intellectual tailgaters?
Can sports and scholarship mix? How
about football and feminism? At Stan
ford, anything's possible.

In an effort to give football fans more
contact with the faculty, Stanford's Of
fice of Public Affairs has begun Sideline
Seminars, a program which offers free
pre-game lectures before two home
games this fall.
"We're trying to combine the best
Stanford has to offer, athletically and
academically," says program coordinator
Barbara Benjamin-Trevino.
Sideline Seminars will occur before
the Utah game Oct. 21 and the UCLA
game Nov. 4. Two seminars are offered
on each day from 10-11 a.m. If the lec
tures are well-received, more will be of
fered in the future.
One of the Oct. 21 presentations is
"Just Win, Baby: A Feminist Perspective
on Sports and Law," given by Law Prof.
Ellen Borgersen. According to Borger
sen, litigation and football are both
forms of ritualized combat.
At the same time, English Prof. Diane
Middlebrook will discuss "Sports and
Games and Football" and share contem
porary poems about the very American
sport of football.
On Nov. 4, James Adams, professor
and chair of the Values, Technology, Sci
ence, and Society Program, will explore
current thinking on being clever. "What's
New With Creativity?" is scheduled in
the Political Science Building, Room
161 J.
Also on Nov. 4, Sociology Prof. San
ford Dornbusch will discuss "Families,
Peers and Schools." Prof. Dornbusch will
use p. study of 10,000 high school stu
dents to provide insight into family be
havior. _ Sherromba Barbee
