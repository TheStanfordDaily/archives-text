Important Changes
at Cowell
We no longer cover emergency room visits (including
Stanford University Medical Center).
The fee schedule for additional services such as
immunizations, allergy, cholesterol screening, and
routine physical examinations have been increased to
reflect current costs of providing services.
If you are a continuing student on the Bankers United
Policy; please read your brochure for important
1989-90 changes.
Students watch your mailbox for information on an
upcoming voluntary dental plan.
