In what will surely be the easiest test of your intellect this term, Apple invites you
to try winning a tree Apple" Macintosh" Plus personal computer merely by finding it in
this drawing.
Well even give you a hint: It's not the table, the lamp,or the chair.
Now you re on your own.
To register, look for contest details where Macintosh computers are sold on your
campus. Oh, all right, well give you a hint for that, too: Look at the bottom of this ad.
But do it really; really fast. Because only one Macintosh is being given away on this
campus, and its going to happen soon.
Soon, as in right away Pronto. Quick like.
But hey, you can take a hint.

going to win a free Macintosh.
