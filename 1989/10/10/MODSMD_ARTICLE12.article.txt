## Lebanon struggles to end war 
### 
TAIF, Saudi Arabia (AP) —
Arab League mediators struggled
yesterday to salvage a peace plan
aimed at ending Lebanon's civil
war, and one of the Lebanese law
makers gathered for negotiations
said they were making headway.
Saeb Salam, a Sunni Moslem,
said the three-man Arab League
committee was trying "to devise
a mechanism that would guaran
tee" implementation of the peace
plan.
Lebanon's 33 Christian and 30
Moslem parliament members have
been meeting in this Saudi resort
since Sept. 30 to try to end their
nation's 14-year-old war.
Hard-line Christian deputies
who owe allegiance to Maronite
Catholic leader Gen. Michel Aoun
are demanding guarantees that
Syria pull out its 40,000 troops
from Lebanon before they will
cooperate.
The demand has blocked par
liament sessions for four days, and
the Arab League committee
sought help from Arab and other
powers, including the United
States, the Soviet Union and
France.
"The contacts of the tripartite
committee are moving very well,"
Salam told reporters in Taif.
The members of the committee
are King Fahd of Saudi Arabia,

'I affirm to my broth
ers in Lebanon that
success is inevitable,
and failure is not.'
— Saeb Salam

King Hassan II of Morocco and
President Chadli Bendjedid of Al
geria.
Salam did not elaborate but said
the deputies and the mediators
were "doing everything to make
the conference succeed."
The 87-year-old deputy declared
tearfully that "I affirm to my
brothers in Lebanon that success
is inevitable and failure is not."
Moslem legislators who support
the Syrians want more power in
Lebanon's Christian-dominated
government.
Under the peace plan presented
by the Arab mediators, sec
tarianism would be abolished
gradually as law and order were
restored.
Syrian forces in Beirut would
be withdrawn over two years and
relocated in the Bekaa Valley in
eastern Lebanon; a full pullout
would follow a security pact be
tween Beirut and Damascus.

The Christians want the
Syrians out within six months,
but many Moslems insist there
can be no withdrawal until the
Maronites agree to surrender
some of the power they have held
since Lebanon's independence
from France in 1943.
Under an unwritten covenant,
the president has always been a
Maronite Catholic, the prime min
ister a Sunni Moslem and the par
liament speaker a Shiite.
At independence, the Christians
were considered the msgority, but
Moslems now make up an esti
mated 55 percent of the 4 million
population.
In Beirut, the An-Nahar news
paper reported that the Arab
League committee was pressing
the Lebanese legislators to meet
deadlines it has set for elections.
The latest round of fighting in
Lebanon began in March when
Aoun fierce artillery battles killed
more than 900 people before a
cease-fire brokered by the Arab
League took hold Sept. 22.
The Syrian troops moved into
Lebanon in 1976, the year after
the civil war broke out, under an
Arab League peacekeeping man
date.
Aoun alleges the Syrians lost
their mandate by openly siding
with the Moslems.
