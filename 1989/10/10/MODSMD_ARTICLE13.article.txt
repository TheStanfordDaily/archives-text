# Arabs protest in West Bank; death toll rises on Day of Atonement

JERUSALEM (AP) â€” Israeli soldiers
opened fire yesterday on masked Arabs
who were marching with outlawed Pal
estinian flags in the West Bank town of
Nablus, killing one of them.
It was the second fatal shooting in as
many days in Nablus, the West Bank's
largest town, and occurred during an
army curfew imposed on the 120,000 res
idents.
Earlier yesterday, three soldiers were
injured when an assailant hurled a
firebomb at their patrol in Nablus, the
army said. One soldier suffered moderate
wounds, and two sustained minor inju
ries, the army said.

Also yesterday, a 5-year-old Palestinian
girl, Ulfat Nassar, was shot in the head
when Israeli troops clashed with stone
throwing Arab demonstrators in the
Tulkarem refugee camp northwest of
Nablus.
Doctors at Rafidya Hospital in Nablus
said she was in "extremely critical con
dition."
In an interview broadcast Sunday by
Israel television, Lt. Gen. Dan Shomron,
the army chief of staff, said the army
could not end the 22-month-old Palestin
ian uprising by itself.
"No doubt that this type of popular
uprising, no matter where it occurs, hap

pens from motivation that is impossible
to end in one action," he said. "It is a
long process. There is no such thing as
a military solution."
The violence came as Jews marked Yom
Kippur, the Day of Atonement, with fas
ting and prayers. The holiday, Judaism's
holiest, ended at sundown yesterday.
Shops and businesses were closed in
Arab east Jerusalem and in the occupied
West Bank and Gaza Strip to mark the
start of the 23rd month of the Palestinian
uprising against Israeli occupation.
The general strike was to continue
today, the fourth and final day of a series
of closures called by the underground

leadership of the uprising in sympathy
with residents of the town of Beit Sahour.
Israeli soldiers and tax collectors have
raided shops and homes in Beit Sahour,
near Bethlehem, for more than two weeks
because of an Arab boycott of taxes. Res
idents say more than $750,000 worth of
furniture and machinery has been con
fiscated.
In Nablus, about a dozen Palestinian
men were marching near the Najar Uni
versity campus when an army patrol
spotted them and gave chase, the army
said.
Witnesses said when the demonstrators
failed to stop, the soldiers opened fire,

killing one of the Palestinians. The army
identified the victim as Nidal El-Habash,
22.
Earlier, the army spokesman's office
confirmed that soldiers shot and killed a
masked Palestinian on Sunday who was
among a group demonstrating in the
Nablus central market.
The spokesman, who cannot be identi
fied by name under military rules, said
some of the Palestinians were armed with
swords or knives. He said troops opened
fire when the Palestinians failed to re
spond to shouts and warning shots.
Arab reports identified the man killed
Sunday as Ghassan Hudhud, 32.
