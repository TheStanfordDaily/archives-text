# Greek socialist movement fails

### 
;* ATHENS, Greece (AP) — Former Pre
r'mier Andreas Papandreou failed yesterday
;to persuade other leftist forces to join his
socialist camp in a coalition government.
- The collapse of that effort means Greeks
-will face new general elections in Novem
ber, only five months after the last voting.
Papandreou told President Christos
•Sartzetakis on Monday that he had failed
in his three-day presidential mandate for
forming a new government.
,' Emerging from the presidential palace
jn Athens, the 70-year-old Papandreou told
he outlined proposals of his Pan-
Hellenic Socialist Movement in a memoran
dum to the president. However, he did not
[ -elaborate.
;« Later in the day, Communist Party chief
'.JHarilaos Florakis was summoned to the

presidential palace, but he deciified to try
to put together a government.
The political crisis stems from the elec
tions on June 18, when no party won a
majority in parliament. Conservatives and
leftists banded togethar in an unusual al
liance to press forward legal action against
socialist officials accused of corruption, in
cluding Papandreou himself.
However, the alliance said it would gov
ern only temporarily, and its government
stepped down after three months. Conser
vative New Democracy Party leader Con
stantine Mitsotakis has agreed to remain
caretaker until a new government is
formed.
He too has rejected a presidential man
date to try to form a government, saying
he wanted to "quickly clear any obstacles
to elections" on Nov. 5.
