Bush OK after surgery
WASHINGTON (AP) - A cyst
removed from President Bush's right
middle finger was benign, a spokes
woman said yesterday.
The results of the pathological ex
amination were relayed to Bush as he
concluded a three-day weekend at
Camp David, the presidential retreat
in Maryland's Catoctin Mountains.
Returning to the White House,
Bush sported a white bandage on his
finger. He smilingly declined to talk
with reporters.
The cyst was removed during a 25-
minute surgical procedure Friday at

Walter Reed Army Medical Center,
with Bush receiving a local anesthetic.
"The pathology report is (that it is)
benign," said press aide Laura Melillo.
Physicians had said earlier they did
not believe the growth was cancerous.
The growth, measuring one centi
meter in diameter, had bothered Bush
for several years.
Soviets allowed to strike
MOSCOW (AP) — Legislators yes
terday gave Soviet workers the legal
right to strike, the first such measure
in the nation's history.

Following a daylong debate, the Su
preme Soviet legislature passed the
complex measure that bans strikes by
workers in almost a dozen sectors,
but also provides other workers with
a legal framework under which to
strike.
The Soviet Union's need for a such
a labor law became urgent this sum
mer, when hundreds of thousands of
coal miners went on strike for better
working conditions and political
change.
Although they were not expressly
forbidden by Soviet law, the few
strikes that broke out in recent years
were brutally suppressed.
