Small publications
may finally get much
needed office space

THANKS TO THE Stanford
Student Directory, unhoused
student publications may
soon have a place to call home.
The directory, managed by stu
dents and published annually, lists
student phone numbers, informa
tion on campus organizations and
advertisements for off-campus
businesses, among many other
things.
The directory also turns a profit.
Revenue from advertising pays for
the production of the directory,
and income over and above that
goes to the publication's supervis
ing agency, Student Organization
Services.
Organizers would not say how
much profit the directory will

realize this year, but they said the
profits may help fund renovation
of the Storke Annex, a wing of the
Storke Student Publications Build
ing. An addition to the main Storke
Building might also be con
structed.
The additional space created
would ease the housing crunch for
student publications and would
benefit publications such as Dial
Tone, Sequoia, The Stanford
Review and Release Magazine.
It's a unique opportunity for the
University, and it's definitely a step
in the right direction. Student or
ganizations of all kinds have a
serious need for more office space,
and in the last year some organi
zations — such as The Bridge —
have had to fight to keep the space
they have.
Student Organization Services
should take advantage of this op
portunity, and hopefully the Storke
addition can serve as a sign of
continued and increased commit
ment to housing student groups.
