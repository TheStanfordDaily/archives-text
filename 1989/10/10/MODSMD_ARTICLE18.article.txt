# Lofty security
## 
### 
HOUSING AND FOOD Serv
ices made the right move
when it recently tightened
restrictions on lofts in residences.
Housing officials adopted new
guidelines to limit the size of lofts
when the University fire marshal
determined that many existing
lofts are fire hazards and barriers
to safe emergency exits.
The new policy outlaws free
standing lofts that prevent fire
sprinklers or smoke detectors from
functioning.
Further, lofts cannot obstruct
windows or doors that might be
used as a means of escape, and
carpeting applied vertically to lofts
must be flame-retardant.
It may not be welcome to all

students, but the new policy is nec
essary. Despite the possible reno
vation hassles it creates, the policy
— simply put — may save someone
from getting seriously injured.
Housing and Food Services could
ease the transition by providing
students with blueprints for build
ing safe lofts. The students could
then build a structurally sound loft
from the start, rather than spend
ing some shaky nights in an un
stable loft before getting Univer
sity approval.
Housing and Food Services still
has to make up its mind about
when the new guidelines will really
go into effect and how extensive
the modifications will be — so stu
dents in affected rooms can settle
in for good.
