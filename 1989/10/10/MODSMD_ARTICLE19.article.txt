## Schwartz lacks a grasp of facts concerning Jackson 
### 
I WAS DISMAYED by University
Vice President and General Counsel
John Schwartz's Oct. 6 letter con
cerning the University's stance in the
case of Louis Jackson.
Rather than presenting an eloquent
assemblage of falsities, intimated as
truths in an attempt to justify a
laissez-faire policy, as Schwartz did, I
prefer to divulge the facts which speak
for themselves.
First, Schwartz writes, "Claims made
in the petition that the University
intervened in the 1971 Bazile case and
or the 1985 Perkins case are simply
untrue."
I chose to do some research in order
to better understand the meaning of
the untrue. On Nov. 13, 1985, in a
letter to Sheriff Robert Winter, Univer
sity President Donald Kennedy writes,
"Only a full and open account either
demonstrating that there was no im
proper conduct of acknowledging and
correcting any improprieties, can allevi

ate the disquiet on campus. ... It is a
matter of grave concern to me person
ally whenever there is a possibility that
any Stanford student may have been
injured because of an official transgres
sion."
Next, Schwartz writes that he is
unaware that Jackson is being singled
out for prosecution. Once again, the
facts:
On Wed., Oct. 4, 53 protesters each
received 40 hours of community service
and will be on probation for six
months. While they originally faced
five charges, four were dropped. Thus,
their sentence resulted from their not
contesting the remaining charge.
Louis Jackson continues to face six
charges.
Furthermore, the battery charge is
completely unfounded. In a statement,
Mandy MacCalla, the woman that
Jackson supposedly battered, writes,
"One young man put his hands on my
arms and attempted to push me

toward the back door. Other students
immediately advised him to take his
hands off me, which he did. ... At no
time did I feel physically threatened.
In fairness, I would have to say that I
was much ruder to the students than
they were to me."
In a supplemental statement, she
writes, "Jackson took me by the elbow
and started to push me toward the
rear door. I was not injured by his
action, nor was he able to make me
move. I had no marks or bruises as a
result of Jackson's actions."
Then, in a personal letter to Jack
son, MacCalla explains that she does
not hold Jackson personally responsible
and that she understands that the
morning of the takeover was an espe
cially tense period.
Though MacCalla refuses to press
charges, the District Attorney refuses
to drop the battery charge. These are
the facts. Jackson has been singled out
for selective punishment.

Finally, I congratulate Schwartz on
his factually correct paragraph in
which he states that Jackson and the
other protesters were punished equally
by the University, each receiving 75
hours of community service.
Still, it is necessary to mention that
the University also attempted to isolate
"leaders" by charging eight of the
protesters with an "especially egregious
violation of the Policy on Campus
Disruption." In the end, this charge
was dropped and all received equal
punishment.
Having shed some light on the mat
ter, one should ask why the University
refuses to intervene and why Schwartz
chooses to conceal, and even worse, to
distort the facts. Is Jackson being
singled out for selective punishment?
Can the University do anything for his
case? Let the facts decide.
