# Berkeley burglars nabbed
## Cal students arrested for theft at Sigma Chi 
### Brad Hayward Editorial staff 
If events over the weekend are
any indication, some Cal students
may be taking the Big Game
rivalry a little too seriously.
Stanford Police arrested two
UC-Berkeley students for bur
glary early Saturday morning
after they allegedly broke into and
stole several items from two Stan
ford fraternities. The alleged
burglars were caught by members
of the Sigma Chi fraternity, who
held them until police arrived.
Kyle Aquistapace, 20, and
George Theofanous, 19, both of
Berkeley, were each charged with
two counts of burglary. They were
released after being cited and
signing a promise to appear in
court, said Stanford Police Capt.
Raoul Niemeyer.
The series of events began late
Friday or early Saturday, when
residents of the Delta Kappa Ep
silon fraternity reported a missing
cordless phone and wallet, accord
ing to Niemeyer.

Don Griffin, a resident of the
house, said the stolen phone
belonged to his roommate and
that the burglars apparently
gained access t6 the room through
an open window.
Later that morning, a Sigma
Chi resident sleeping in his room
was awakened by the two
suspects. "They made a little too
much noise," said the resident,
who did not want to be identified.
The resident confronted the
suspects, who at first said "they
were looking for someone else,"
Niemeyer said. The resident
thought otherwise and called
other fraternity members, who
seized the suspects and called
police. Officers arrived on the
scene at 1:40 a.m. Saturday,
Niemeyer said.
The suspects "didn't put up any
fight," the resident said. "It was
pretty obvious" what they were
doing, he added.
The suspects were found with
a stolen Gucci watch and were in
the process of taking a stereo unit
when they were accosted,

Niemeyer said.
When officers searched the
suspects' vehicle they found the
cordless phone and wallet that had
been reported missing from the
Delta Kappa Epsilon house. Police
are now holding the cordless tele
phone as evidence, Griffin said.
In addition, officers found a
computer printer, radar detector,
AM/FM stereo carrying case,
bicycle light and bungy cord in
the suspects' vehicle. Police
suspect that those items were also
stolen, but they do not know from
whom. The suspects said the
items found in the car were not
stolen but were their own.
A dollar amount for the mer
chandise had not been determined
late yesterday.
Though the suspects were each
charged with two counts of bur
glary, additional charges may be
added if police determine that
items in the car were stolen by
the suspects in other incidents,
Niemeyer said.
The two will appear in Palo Alto
Municioal Court.
