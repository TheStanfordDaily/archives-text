# Debaters overlook real problem with Fundamental Standard
## 
### 
We would like to raise a point that
we aren't sure has been properly ad
dressed in the whole debate over what
the Fundamental Standard really
means.
The Standard is not, as some would
have it, an umbrella to shield the
Stanford community from the feelings
of fear and anger that other people's
actions may cause.
Rather, it's a mold, into which all
students must be pressed. Webster's
Dictionary defines a standard as a
criterion, and calling it fundamental
means that it's essential to how we

define ourselves as members of a com
munity. The Standard plainly states,
"Students are expected to show both
within and without the University
what is demanded of good citizens."
Today this means, "Thou shalt not
be racist. If you are, you have no place
here." Thirty years ago it probably
meant, "Thou shalt not be Commu
nist." It demands that students behave
and speak in a certain way in order to
be a student.
Speaking for ourselves alone, both of
us can say, "Screw the First Amend
ment, we can live with this." If Stan
ford doesn't want racists, great. It
doesn't affect us; burning crosses is
not our thing.
The point is that we should all
realize that liberty and "standards" or
credos of any type are not compatible.
If we like decent behavior, then we

must bag the Bill of Rights. If want
ideas to circulate unhindered, then we
must abandon any idea of holding stu
dents to an ideal standard of behavior,
no matter who prescribes it.
Tinkering with the Fundamental
Standard serves no purpose. The be
havior it demands from us is very
clear. Either Stanford should enforce
the type of behavior its community
consensus demands of students, or the
Fundamental Standard should be aban
doned altogether.
We are protesting against those who,
like the administration, claim we can
have our cake and eat it too.
So stop pussyfooting around and
talking about the Standard's "vague
ness." It's not vague. Come on
(Council of Presidents member) Ingrid
(Nava), (University President) Donald
(Kennedy) and everyone else. Tell us

what you think.
