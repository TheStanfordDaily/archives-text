## America's new religion 
### 
DESIGNER JEANS. Designer per
fume. Designer salad dressing.
And crack — designer nihilism.
Design has lost its sensibility and order.
The latest victim is religion. Welcome to
the religion of the '90s: designer religion
by George Bush, from the creators of
Reaganomics.
For those who missed the latest model
of designer religion introduced this sum
mer, it's called the "war against drugs."
Drugs are the gravest domestic problem,
quoth George Bush. Yes, from the ashes
of Jimmy Swaggart's lies and Tammy
Bakker's makeup rises a new brand of
religion. Leave it to the government to
put the morality back into Americhris
tianity.
Can't you just see it. . . . George Bush
at the altar of Memorial Church. Eager
students open their prayer books. The
responsive reading begir.s:
The Drug Lord's Prayer
Congregation: If we could just keep them
from the borders.
Reader (Bush): Then we could have a
beautiful place to live.
All: Donate $100 million. Stop drugs.
Congregation: If we could just keep them
from the schools.
Reader: Then we could have a beautiful
place to learn.
All: Donate $50 million. Stop drugs.
Congregation: If we could just keep them
from low-income housing. . . .
The drug war capped a summer of
victories for morality-minded politicians.
What started with a challenge of the sin
ful Roe v. Wade and continued with the

deification of the American flag, has now
ended with a full-fledged war on drugs.
Why the sudden burst of moral policies?
Americans seem to need an abstraction
on which they can lavish their faith. The
unfortunate result is that those of us
who don't need such restrictions, that is,
those who found the restraint not to eat
dessert before dinner even when Mommy
forgot to remind them about it, have
been deserted in the land of the not-so
free and home of the weak-willed.
As Time magazine was clever enough
to point out, if the American flag really
is declared sacred, then will it be legal
to sentence a prisoner with a tattoo of
the flag to the electric chair? I'd like to
extend this. Will it still be legal to lick
the back of a postage stamp with the
American flag? Isn't licking a form of
desecration? If not, then can protesters
lick and chew the flag in front of the
White House? How about pictures of the
flag? Will it be okay to throw away an
overexposed negative of the flag or will
it have to go into the Flag Hall of Fame?
Admittedly, it's unfair to treat all sub
jects with such levity. Drugs are a more
serious problem than flag-burning.
Nevertheless, both are symptoms — not
causes — of a society gone awry. If every
thing in America were hunky-dory then
maybe people wouldn't want to burn the
flag, and maybe people wouldn't have to
turn to drugs (for emotional and eco
nomic reasons).
By slapping us on the wrist and saying,
"no, no drugs" and "bad, bad flag
burners," the government encourages
people to discover other vices and symbols

By slapping us on the
wrist and saying, 'No,
no drugs' and 'Bad,
bad flag burners,' the
government encour
ages people to find
other vices and sym
bols of protest.

of protest. Dealing with the poverty, bu
reaucracy and illiteracy that might be at
the root of America's woes would be too
logical. It would be like proving God's
existence and taking the mystique out of
religion.
Although I reject this Americhris
tianity, I subscribe to a religion more
treacherous. I am aware of these prob
lems, yet I am satisfied writing a column
and not doing a damn thing about my
ideas.
