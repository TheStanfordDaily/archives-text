## Overhead costs becoming a cancerous disease in the University 
### 
Electrical Engineering Prof. A.E.
Siegman (The Daily, Oct. 5) should be
applauded for raising our consciousness
about overhead costs and the need for
all of us in administration to carefully
and responsibly analyze the activities
they support because they may or may
not be advancing the goals of the Uni
versity.
In the late 19605, when the univer
sities and the federal government
reached agreements legitimizing the
principles of indirect cost recovery, we
all rejoiced because we recognized that
these funds helped offset legitimate
overhead costs related to sponsored
research and the functioning of the
University.
At the same time, I recall, wc heard
warnings that if these funds were not
controlled carefully, they could foster
the development of an unprecedented
and powerful university bureaucracy
whose singular goal may become the
perpetuation of its own existence.
Several years later those fears have
come to haunt us. Bureaucracy is with

us now, and it's almost like an illness.
This illness, in fact, is not from a lack
of money, even though the University
has financial problems.
It stems from increasing throngs of
planners, administrative types, consult
ants, interpreters and enforcers of gov
ernment and non-government regula
tions, all accompanied by multitudes of
vaguely clerical persons with mysteri
ous duties. Many of these are undoubt
edly necessary and legitimate and are
contributing to the functioning of the
University. But others may not be.
They form metastasizing units that
proliferate and spread like cancer

throughout the University.
Two powerful causes may have com
bined to favor this cancerous invasion.
Universities have become very complex
and presidents in general have tended,
as they should, to rely on individuals
with backgrounds in business, law,
politics and administration. The
faculties of universities have been able
to offer little assistance to reduce
reliance on such professionals.
They have offered little or no help to
presidents who may have wished to
take a different course than to follow
the pressures of the moment, which

are inevitable when institutions rely
heavily on federal funds. And in a few
instances, faculty, particularly in the
biomedical sciences, have contributed to
the problem with outside pecuniary
interests and entrepreneurial ventures,
which may be legitimate, but which
society perceives as being at odds with
their status as professors and
recipients of federal research funds.
As a consequence, during this period,
universities have been brought increas
ingly under federal control, with rivers
of regulations cascading from Washing
ton to cure real or imagined abuses.
Whatever may be the intent or the
justification of federal control, the arbi
trary manner in which its regulations
are established and enforced makes
them essentially tyrannous. But the
most steady and insistent effect of
federal influence on the universities
has been to promote the growth of
bureaucracy to the neglect and harm
of the vitality of the universities as
centers of learning.
Cancer in the human body is a pro

gressive and deadly disease without as
yet reliable means of cure. Metastasiz
ing bureaucratoma or cancer in the
academic body may be equally deadly
to its inner life. Ajid while little has
been done to limit its ravages, there's
light at the end of the tunnel.
At a recent retreat of University vice
presidents and other key officers, the
costs of administration, the burden of
indirect costs and the rising tuition
costs, which must be kept under con
trol, were clearly recognized as con
cerns meriting top priority.
And University President Donald
Kennedy and Vice President and
Provost James Rosse are committed to
a determined effort to deal with these
issues in the coming months. In the
School of Medicine, Vice President and
Dean David Korn is equally committed
to this end and has already ordered
significant reductions in administration
in the months head.
