# '$40 fee increase threatens freedom'

The Daily Palo Alto
Citing the need for an in
crease in faculty salaries, the
Board of Trustees imposed a
quarterly tuition fee upon en
rolled Stanford students for the
first time in the University's
history.

In an outraged editorial con
demning this shift in policy, the
editor of the Daily Palo Alto
wrote, "The free Stanford that
thousands have learned to love
will no longer be that free in
stitution, welcoming those rich
and poor into its democratic
fold."
He continued, "Something
revolts within us when we
realize that the whole free
policy, one of the great things
of Stanford, has been swept
aside."
How much was this evil
precedent-setting tuition
charge? A staggering $40 per
quarter. Guess that's why they
call them the good old days.

The University administra
tion decided to move the an

nual Big Game Bonfire from
its traditional site on the dry
bed of Lake Lagunita to an
open field behind Branner Hall.
The group of administrators
making the decision included
University President Ray
Lyman Wilbur. According to
the administrators, disturb
ances in Roble Hall associated
with the previous year's Bon
fire that "were responsible for
a number of freshman women
flunking out of school," were
the motivating factor for the
change in location.
The administrators never actu
ally specified what these dis
turbances consisted of, but ap
parently they felt that Branner
freshmen could handle the se
vere academic pressures im
posed on a dorm by proximity
to the Bonfire better than Roble
freshmen had done.
Oct. 14, 1975
The Stanford Daily
In other Bonfire news, the
Council of Presidents an
nounced that they oppose the
tradition of the Bonfire, citing
its high cost and adverse im
pact upon the environment as
well as the promotion of algae
growth on Lake Lagunita.
No mention was made of fears
that students in Roble would
flunk out if Stanford held the
Bonfire on the Lag lakebed,
proving conclusively that stu
dents of the 1970s were better
prepared to deal with the rigors
of academic life than their
counterparts of the 19305.
