## Glow-in-the-dark query brings Bug back 
### Aram Irwin 
Summer's over, and the Bug is
back. Bug Me is the Stanford Dai
ly's column for enquiring minds
("like me!"), for people with bur
ning questions just waiting to be
put out.
If you wanna know something
but are too embarrassed to ask
anyone, ask me, and I'll print your
embarrassing question and your
name so everybody knows. On the
other hand, if you have a perfectly
unexciting question which you
simply don't have the motivation
to find the answer to yourself,
just Bug Me, and I'll do all the
boring interviews and research for
you myself (term paper help is
also available — just send $19.99
with your topic, and I'll send you
the paper).
You can ask the Bug anything.
Send Bug Me questions you would
normally address to Dear Abby,
Dr. Ruth, Carl Sagan or any com
bination thereof. Write to: Bug

Dear Bug Me,
I see bicycles locked up and
abandoned rusting away all over
campus. Whose are they? What
happens to them ? Can I take one
if it's been there a long time?
— Just Curious
Certainly you can take one! Al
though you may well end up being
charged with theft. In fact, when
I asked Stanford Police Captain
Raoul Niemeyer that same ques
tion he replied emphatically, "Ab
solutely not!" Captain Niemeyer
went on to explain Stanford's
policy on abandoned bikes,
dubbed the "Bicycle Abatement
Program."
Every June, theoretically,
Housing Facilities identifies and
tags all suspected bikes. If the
bikes aren't removed five days
after being tagged they are then
. . . well . . . abated (shudder) by
Facilities. After being abated, the
bikes are taken in for further
questioning. Those bikes that can
offer conclusive proof that they

were, in fact, stolen are released
on their own recognizance. The
rest are held in protective custody
in Stanford storage facilities after
being booked.
Facilities holds on to these bikes
until startled students return
from summer break to find their

bikes (gasp!) gone. Much to their
relief, students can reclaim their
bikes if they contact the Facilities
office and plead their case. But
don't think you can avoid the $10
summer bike storage fee at Stern
by faking abandoning your bike.
The Bug suspects that Facilities
exacts a goodly fee for its time
and effort. This University isn't
exactly non-profit, fella.
Anyway, the remaining un
claimed bikes are transferred to
the Stanford Police, who again
check for evidence that the bikes
aren't stolen. After 45 days, the
bikes are given to special charities.
In the past, the bikes were given
to the Marines, who probably
looked foolish riding three-speed
girls' Huffy bicycles anyway. The
ASSU has been pushing to have
the bikes auctioned ofT, but as
Capt. Niemeyer put it, auctions
are "not worth the pain and effort
to do."
"But hey," you say, "what kinda
dork would leave a perfectly good
bike just lying around?" Actually,
according to Capt. Niemeyer, all
kindsa dorks leave their perfectly
good bikes lying around — the
aforementioned summer

vacationers, the overseas stu
dents, the uninformed freshmen,
the fuzzies without a clue as to
how to fix a flat and of course
the graduating students who leave
their bikes behind after going on
to the bigger and better debts
which of course follow your Stan
ford education.
Dear Bug Me,
Why do glow-in-the-dark things
glow in the dark? And does their
power to glow ever wear out?
— Mike Swanson, Sophomore
Other than a most heinous ex
perience with a glow-in-the-dark
prophylactic, the Bug has not had
the opportunity to do much re
search on this exciting phenome
non, known as phosphorescence
(not to be confused with tumes
cence, as I found out). So I figured
I'd consult the Chemistry and
Physics Departments, figuring if
I couldn't get a straight answer
from them I could at least get
them to disagree (remember cold
fusion?).
Peter Schiffer and a bunch of
other grad students working for
low temperature Professor of
Physics Doug Osheroff were the
first to aid me in my quest. Bas
ically, they told me, there are cer
tain kinds of molecules whose
atoms' electrons, when exposed to
light, get real excited and literally
jump to a higher energy level.
When they're good and baked and
taken out of light, the electrons'
high energy levels decay, giving
off energy in the form of light.
So that's the physics of phos
phorescence, which maybe ex
plains how Close-Up toothpaste
works.
But I had questions yet, and I
wasn't about to let Mike Swanson
down. I contacted the Chemistry
Department next, where I spoke
to post-doctoral student Dee Pack
about this funky phenomenon.
Pack explained that radium used
to be used primarily for glow-in
the-dark paint on watch dials and
hands. Of course, Dee continued,
radium is radioactive, and the
guys and gals painting those watch
dials licked their brushes (as all

In the past, the
bikes were given to
the Marines, who
probably looked
foolish riding
three-speed girls'
Huffy bikes any
way.

really hip painters do). This led
to their tongues falling off.
Uncool, but as Dee put it,
"That's the price the capitalist
world pays for people to wear
glow-in-the-dark watches." So the
capitalists checked out other ways
of phosphorescing and decided on
chemaluminescent materials to
replace the radioctive ones.
Chemaluminescent materials are
the chemicals found in those Hal
loween glow-in-the-dark sticks.
The two liquids in the stick
mingle when combined, causing a
light emitting reaction and no end
of amusement. Chemalumines
cents can be organic as well as
synthetic and are produced by
fireflies, glow worms, deep sea
fish, cave creatures and former
homeowners in New Jersey's Love
Canal district. Other organic
phosphorescents are dredged up
from fungi and injected into your
typical glow-in-the-dark frisbee.
I asked Dee whether or not my
glow-in-the-dark frisbee would
ever stop glowing. Apparently,
some decay probably occurs.
Maybe one out of a thousand
times, something goes wrong and
a molecule of phosphorescent is
inactivated. Based on empirical
evidence, though, Dee had a better
answer to the question of how
long a glow-in-the-dark frisbee
will glow: "Usually you lose them
before they stop glowing as much.
Even more so with the glow-in
the-dark superballs."

prophylactic, the Bug has not had
the opportunity to do much re
search on this exciting phenome
non, known as phosphorescence
(not to be confused with tumes
cence, as I found out). So I figured
I'd consult the Chemistry and
Physics Departments, figuring if
I couldn't get a straight answer
from them I could at least get
them to disagree (remember cold
fusion?).
Peter Schiffer and a bunch of
other grad students working for
low temperature Professor of
Physics Doug Osheroff were the
first to aid me in my quest. Bas
ically, they told me, there are cer
tain kinds of molecules whose
atoms' electrons, when exposed to
light, get real excited and literally
jump to a higher energy level.
When they're good and baked and
taken out of light, the electrons'
high energy levels decay, giving
off energy in the form of light.
So that's the physics of phos
phorescence, which maybe ex
plains how Close-Up toothpaste
works.
But I had questions yet, and I
wasn't about to let Mike Swanson
down. I contacted the Chemistry
Department next, where I spoke
to post-doctoral student Dee Pack
about this funky phenomenon.
Pack explained that radium used
to be used primarily for glow-in
the-dark paint on watch dials and
hands. Of course, Dee continued,
radium is radioactive, and the
guys and gals painting those watch
dials licked their brushes (as all

In the past, the
bikes were given to
the Marines, who
probably looked
foolish riding
three-speed girls'
Huffy bikes any
way.

really hip painters do). This led
to their tongues falling off.
Uncool, but as Dee put it,
"That's the price the capitalist
world pays for people to wear
glow-in-the-dark watches." So the
capitalists checked out other ways
of phosphorescing and decided on
chemaluminescent materials to
replace the radioctive ones.
Chemaluminescent materials are
the chemicals found in those Hal
loween glow-in-the-dark sticks.
The two liquids in the stick
mingle when combined, causing a
light emitting reaction and no end
of amusement. Chemalumines
cents can be organic as well as
synthetic and are produced by
fireflies, glow worms, deep sea
fish, cave creatures and former
homeowners in New Jersey's Love
Canal district. Other organic
phosphorescents are dredged up
from fungi and injected into your
typical glow-in-the-dark frisbee.
I asked Dee whether or not my
glow-in-the-dark frisbee would
ever stop glowing. Apparently,
some decay probably occurs.
Maybe one out of a thousand
times, something goes wrong and
a molecule of phosphorescent is
inactivated. Based on empirical
evidence, though, Dee had a better
answer to the question of how
long a glow-in-the-dark frisbee
will glow: "Usually you lose them
before they stop glowing as much.
Even more so with the glow-in
the-dark superballs."

If you wanna know something

anyone, ask me, and I'll print your
embarrassing question and your

other hand, if you have a perfectly
unexciting question which you
simply don't have the motivation
to find the answer to yourself,
just Bug Me, and I'll do all the
boring interviews and research for
you myself (term paper help is
also available — just send $19.99

You can ask the Bug anything.

Dear Bug Me,
I see bicycles locked up and
abandoned rusting away all over
campus. Whose are they? What
happens to them ? Can I take one
if it's been there a long time?
— Just Curious
Certainly you can take one! Al
though you may well end up being
charged with theft. In fact, when
I asked Stanford Police Captain
Raoul Niemeyer that same ques
tion he replied emphatically, "Ab
solutely not!" Captain Niemeyer
went on to explain Stanford's
policy on abandoned bikes,
dubbed the "Bicycle Abatement
Program."
Every June, theoretically,
Housing Facilities identifies and
tags all suspected bikes. If the
bikes aren't removed five days
after being tagged they are then
. . . well . . . abated (shudder) by
Facilities. After being abated, the
bikes are taken in for further
questioning. Those bikes that can
offer conclusive proof that they

were, in fact, stolen are released
on their own recognizance. The
rest are held in protective custody
in Stanford storage facilities after
being booked.
Facilities holds on to these bikes
until startled students return
from summer break to find their

bikes (gasp!) gone. Much to their
relief, students can reclaim their
bikes if they contact the Facilities
office and plead their case. But
don't think you can avoid the $10
summer bike storage fee at Stern
by faking abandoning your bike.
The Bug suspects that Facilities
exacts a goodly fee for its time
and effort. This University isn't
exactly non-profit, fella.
Anyway, the remaining un
claimed bikes are transferred to
the Stanford Police, who again
check for evidence that the bikes
aren't stolen. After 45 days, the
bikes are given to special charities.
In the past, the bikes were given
to the Marines, who probably
looked foolish riding three-speed
girls' Huffy bicycles anyway. The
ASSU has been pushing to have
the bikes auctioned ofT, but as
Capt. Niemeyer put it, auctions
are "not worth the pain and effort
to do."
"But hey," you say, "what kinda
dork would leave a perfectly good
bike just lying around?" Actually,
according to Capt. Niemeyer, all
kindsa dorks leave their perfectly
good bikes lying around — the
aforementioned summer

vacationers, the overseas stu
dents, the uninformed freshmen,
the fuzzies without a clue as to
how to fix a flat and of course
the graduating students who leave
their bikes behind after going on
to the bigger and better debts
which of course follow your Stan
ford education.
