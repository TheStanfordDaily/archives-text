# 'You Can Make a Difference' event to explore education
## 
### Larry Cook 
Some Stanford students are not content
to lounge about in the sunshine. Some
are probably just waiting to get involved
with campus volunteer work and to learn
more about social issues.
For those students, the student organ
izers of the seventh annual "You Can
Make a Difference" conference have an
immediate way to get involved: volunteer
to help organize and run the 1990 'You
Can Make a Difference' conference, enti
tled "Changing Education for a Changing
World."
The aim of the student-run conference,
according to student organizer Goodwin
Liu, is to focus on an issue of pressing
concern and to inform the public of ways
they can get involved with the issue. Past
topics of the conference have included
racism, hunger, the family and, most re
cently, the environment.
This year, he said, conference organi
zers chose to explore the field of education
because "it's a really immediate prob
lem." Liu explained that the American
public has been giving more and more
attention to education as an area in need
of immediate improvement. "We felt it
was really time, judging from all the

media, to focus on this topic," he said.
Student organizer Pat McDonough
agreed that the primary goal of the con
ference is to educate participants, but he
added, "Hopefully people will then be
inspired to get involved (with the
issue).... The goal of the conference is
to show that one individual can make a
difference."

For instance, McDonough said, a stu
dent attending the conference may decide
to tutor or enter the field of education.
One tutor working with a child who is
having problems reading or solving math
problems, can make a discernible differ
ence in that child's education, she noted.
Or, she said, a student may simply be
come a better-informed individual be
cause for having taken the time to learn
more about an important subject
Liu said a secondary goal of the con
ference is to show student volunteers how
to organize and run a conference. He
said that while some students may al
ready have had experience planning and
organizing a campus event, the majority
of volunteers will have "a great learning
experience."
"Students learn everything from gen
erating community support to decision
making," he said.

'The aim of the student-run conference is to
focus on an issue of pressing concern and to
inform the public of ways they can get involved
with the issue.'

Liu said about 40 students began work
ing on this year's conference over the
summer, and added that he expects to
have over 100 volunteers by the time the
conference rolls around. Last year, he
said, there were 140 'You Can Make a
Difference' volunteers, which included at
least 40 faculty and staff members who
helped out with the conference.
More than 1,200 people attended the
highly successful event, which was high
lighted by a keynote address from Ted
Koppel.
Although plans are still tentative, the
conference is scheduled to include a panel
discussion entitled "The Role of Educa
tion in a Democracy," an educationally
oriented dramatic presentation similar to
the culturally oriented "The Fire Within,"
a field trip to local schools in order to

observe the educational process in action
and an educational technology fair.
In addition, there will be several
student-run workshops dealing with the
issue of education at a more in-depth
level. According to outreach committee
coordinator Heather Ramirez, students
interested in designing workshops should
attend the Speakers/ Workshop Commit
tee meeting Wed., Oct. 11. The conference
will end with an address from a yet-to
be-named keynote speaker.
Conference organizers hope to heighten
awareness on the subject of education
before the conference takes place next
Jan. 18, 19 and 20. Working with Resident
Assistants, they plan to hold dorm pro
grams such as: feature films and docu
mentary movies about education, with
structured discussions afterward;
speakers from Stanford and the sur

rounding communities who will talk
about specific educational topics; and
debates, presentations and discussions
which can form around issues of interest
to dorm residents.
According to Ramirez, a typical dorm
program might consist of showing a film
such as "Stand and Deliver" or "The
Lemon Grove Incident" and holding a
discussion afterward, or simply going to
see "Dead Poets Society."
In addition to initiating dorm pro
grams, organizers are sponsoring an on
going brown-bag lunch series, which will
feature knowledgeable speakers voicing
their opinions on a number of issues
relating to education. In the next install
ment of this series, Henry Levin, a pro
fessor at the Stanford School of Education
and the director of the Center for Edu
cational Research, will describe his work
around accelerated schools for at-risk
children today at noon in CERAS 304.
' According to publicity director Diane
Bisgeier, "It was the 130 volunteers that
got the most out of and made last year's
conference such a success. We're hoping
for similar support from the students,
faculty and community to aid this year's
conference. Anyone interested in becom
ing a volunteer should stop by the Haas
Center for Public Service."

to show that one individual can make a
difference."

For instance, McDonough said, a stu
dent attending the conference may decide
to tutor or enter the field of education.
One tutor working with a child who is
having problems reading or solving math
problems, can make a discernible differ
ence in that child's education, she noted.
Or, she said, a student may simply be
come a better-informed individual be
cause for having taken the time to learn
more about an important subject
Liu said a secondary goal of the con
ference is to show student volunteers how
to organize and run a conference. He
said that while some students may al
ready have had experience planning and
organizing a campus event, the majority
of volunteers will have "a great learning
experience."
"Students learn everything from gen
erating community support to decision
making," he said.

'The aim of the student-run conference is to
focus on an issue of pressing concern and to
inform the public of ways they can get involved
with the issue.'

Liu said about 40 students began work
ing on this year's conference over the
summer, and added that he expects to
have over 100 volunteers by the time the
conference rolls around. Last year, he
said, there were 140 'You Can Make a
Difference' volunteers, which included at
least 40 faculty and staff members who
helped out with the conference.
More than 1,200 people attended the
highly successful event, which was high
lighted by a keynote address from Ted
Koppel.
Although plans are still tentative, the
conference is scheduled to include a panel
discussion entitled "The Role of Educa
tion in a Democracy," an educationally
oriented dramatic presentation similar to
the culturally oriented "The Fire Within,"
a field trip to local schools in order to

observe the educational process in action
and an educational technology fair.
In addition, there will be several
student-run workshops dealing with the
issue of education at a more in-depth
level. According to outreach committee
coordinator Heather Ramirez, students
interested in designing workshops should
attend the Speakers/ Workshop Commit
tee meeting Wed., Oct. 11. The conference
will end with an address from a yet-to
be-named keynote speaker.
Conference organizers hope to heighten
awareness on the subject of education
before the conference takes place next
Jan. 18, 19 and 20. Working with Resident
Assistants, they plan to hold dorm pro
grams such as: feature films and docu
mentary movies about education, with
structured discussions afterward;
speakers from Stanford and the sur

rounding communities who will talk
about specific educational topics; and
debates, presentations and discussions
which can form around issues of interest
to dorm residents.
According to Ramirez, a typical dorm
program might consist of showing a film
such as "Stand and Deliver" or "The
Lemon Grove Incident" and holding a
discussion afterward, or simply going to
see "Dead Poets Society."
In addition to initiating dorm pro
grams, organizers are sponsoring an on
going brown-bag lunch series, which will
feature knowledgeable speakers voicing
their opinions on a number of issues
relating to education. In the next install
ment of this series, Henry Levin, a pro
fessor at the Stanford School of Education
and the director of the Center for Edu
cational Research, will describe his work
around accelerated schools for at-risk
children today at noon in CERAS 304.
' According to publicity director Diane
Bisgeier, "It was the 130 volunteers that
got the most out of and made last year's
conference such a success. We're hoping
for similar support from the students,
faculty and community to aid this year's
conference. Anyone interested in becom
ing a volunteer should stop by the Haas
Center for Public Service."
Some Stanford students are not content
to lounge about in the sunshine. Some
are probably just waiting to get involved
with campus volunteer work and to learn
more about social issues.
For those students, the student organ
izers of the seventh annual "You Can
Make a Difference" conference have an
immediate way to get involved: volunteer
to help organize and run the 1990 'You
Can Make a Difference' conference, enti
tled "Changing Education for a Changing
World."
The aim of the student-run conference,
according to student organizer Goodwin
Liu, is to focus on an issue of pressing
concern and to inform the public of ways
they can get involved with the issue. Past
topics of the conference have included
racism, hunger, the family and, most re
cently, the environment.
This year, he said, conference organi
zers chose to explore the field of education
because "it's a really immediate prob
lem." Liu explained that the American
public has been giving more and more
attention to education as an area in need
of immediate improvement. "We felt it
was really time, judging from all the

media, to focus on this topic," he said.
Student organizer Pat McDonough
agreed that the primary goal of the con
ference is to educate participants, but he
added, "Hopefully people will then be
inspired to get involved (with the
issue).... The goal of the conference is
to show that one individual can make a
difference."
