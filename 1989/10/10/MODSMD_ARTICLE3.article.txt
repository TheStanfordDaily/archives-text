# National study will have little effect on Stanford curriculum

While a report released yesterday by
the National Endowment for the Human
ities may alter distribution requirements
at colleges across the nation, University
administrators here said they did not
expect the report to affect Stanford.
According to an article in yesterday's
New York Times, the report found that
too many college students graduate with
insufficient exposure to the "basic
landmarks of history and thought."
The report recommends that colleges
should require students to pass a core of
courses in Western Civilization, foreign
language, social sciences, math and sci
ence. It also cites examples of questions
that a significant percentage of graduat
ing seniors were unable to answer cor

rectly.
A quarter of the students interviewed
in a Gallup Poll sponsored by the endow
ment were unable to distinguish the
thoughts of Karl Marx from the ideas
expressed in the United States Constitu
tion, and 24 percent said that Christopher
Columbus landed in the Western Hemi
sphere sometime after 1500.
Dean of Undergraduate Studies
Thomas Wasow was reluctant to say any
thing definite about the study before ac
tually seeing the data, but he offered a
few basic criticisms of the report.
Wasow criticized the size of the sample
from which the endowment collected its
information. The poll was based on 696
interviews with college seniors who at
tended four-year colleges or universities
in the United States. With over 3,000

colleges in the nation, interviewing 696
seniors is not even one student from every
four schools.
In addition to the size factor, colleges
are very different from one another,
Wasow said, adding that it is highly un
likely the endowment got a representative
sample of the population. "I don't think
Stanford has to be terribly worried," he
said.
Wasow said the proposals made by
Lynne Cheney, chair of the endowment
group, are based on the assumption that
education means being in command of a
fixed body of facts — an assumption
Wasow rejects.
"Education should be thought of as a
collection of abilities that need to be de
veloped," Wasow said. He added that the

ability to think critically and to know
where to get the answers are better in
dicators of effective education.
Charles Junkerman, assistant dean of
Undergraduate Studies, added, "Cultural
literacy is not the same as recognizing
names and dates." He said cultural
knowledge cannot be measured by this
type of survey.
"Cultural literacy is what Stanford is
aiming for," Junkerman said. "We are
working for the deeper, more meaningful
knowledge, such as the understanding of
other cultures."
Wasow also criticized Cheney's "50-
hour plan" which calls for 50 semester
hours — equivalent to 75 Stanford units
— of humanities courses. He called the
plan "unrealistic at a school like Stan

ford," which has a major engineering pro
gram and other technical schools.
Junkerman said he does not foresee
any changes in the distribution require
ments at Stanford stemming from the
release of this report. "I think we have
a very developed and responsible system
of distribution requirements. Our eight
areas generally surpass those of most uni
versities, even elite universities," he said.
The current system of distribution re
quirements includes three quarters of
Cultures, Ideas and Values, two
humanities courses and two social science
courses in addition to courses on math
ematical, natural and applied sciences.
"It seems to me we're doing substan
tially what they're recommending,"
Junkerman said.
