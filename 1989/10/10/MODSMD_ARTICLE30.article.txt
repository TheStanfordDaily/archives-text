## Computer crash ends with ticket confusion 
### Amy Howard 
Due to a computer overload in
the midst of hectic ticket sales for
the Stanford-Notre Dame game
last Saturday, seating arrange
ments for over 500 people were
obliterated from the computer's
memory, leaving several ticket
holders without seats and others
with extra ones.
According to Ticket Manager
Konn Rauschenbach, the game
had been sold out weeks before
the computer crash. "There was
just too much processing and ac
cessing of information at the same
time for our system to handle,"
she said.
Those not affected by the mix
up included the 25,000 season
ticket holders and the 25,000
Notre Dame fans.
In anticipation of accommodat
ing the 1,000 fans who were af
fected by the computer failure,
usher and ticket staffs were
boosted for the game. According
to Rauschenbach, however, the
"seatless" fans were more coop
erative than expected. "Nobody
was outwardly belligerent or
angry," she said.

cated, while those who never re
ceived tickets were told to pick
up vouchers at will call.
Fortunately, some empty seats
were created by fans who returned
their tickets for specially-offered
refunds. The Notre Dame alumni
club also returned undistributed
tickets to help ease the ticket of
fice's dilemma. In addition, some
fans who had received two sets of
tickets contacted the office to
clear up the mistake.
Those fans who used their extra
free tickets, however, will be
billed. According to Rauschen
bach, approximately 20 people fall
into this category.
The incident has caused the
ticket office to lose some confi
dence in the computer system.
"My faith in computers is
gradually being restored," Raus
chenbach said. "For a while, I
thought we would have to go back
to the recipe-card method of is
suing tickets."
