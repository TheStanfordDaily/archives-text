# Giant baseball diamonds outshine any gem
## 
### Lora Dawn Headrick 
This was my summer of
diamonds. Baseball diamonds.
First, of course, Candlestick
Park — a diamond in the rough.
Perched on a finger of rock jutting
into the San Francisco Bay, the
stadium is virtually inaccessible
from the freeway, and even on an
uncrowded day, the parking lot
exodus becomes a long, night
marish ordeal.

Commentary

Then there's the weather — hot
dog wrappers whirling in the
shifting winds, alternating sun
and cloud, night games at tem
peratures below 50 degrees.

But at the heart of this forbid
ding concrete edifice, beyond the
brooding overhang of the upper
deck (clearly an architectural af
terthought) and the cement wall
that restrains abusive fans from
clubbing lazy, inept right fielders
— in the midst of all this rugged
ugliness — lies a perfect diamond.
No zircon gem of astroturf hid
den from the light of day, but
emerald grass beneath an open
sky. The outfield is ringed by a
chain fence so that even the fans
in the cheap seats can see the
whole game. The infield, smooth
and flawless before the Giants
take up their positions, somehow
must bear still the cleat marks of
Willie Mays, Willie McCovey,
Bobby Bonds, and now Will Clark
and Kevin Mitchell — heroes with
diamonds on the soles of their
shoes, touching the corners to out
line for a wildly cheering crowd
the peaceful symmetry of base
ball
I took this field of diamonds
home with me this summer more
times than I can count — and not
only the vision of my beleaguered,
beloved Candlestick, but also the
diamonds that fell around me in
the left-field bleachers. The home
runs came with me, frozen in their
graceful flight as little diamonds

As a spectator, I took home the thrill of
well-played games; as a member of the press,
I took home conversations with the supermen
themselves.

on my scorecard. Matt Williams
gave me quite a few — he always
hit well when I was there — and
Mitchell rained down gemstones
as we held up our bare hands in
salute.
As a spectator I took home the
thrill of well-played games; as a
member of the press I took home
conversations with the supermen
themselves. On Aug. 9, I inter
viewed Dave Dravecky in the
Giants' dugout; the next day I
watched him pitch the game of
his life — and mine.
Press pass in hand, I ventured
into the clubhouse after a game
— as the only woman in the lock
erroom, I was the odd man out.
I may have appeared calm and
professional, but inside my mind
I was an ecstatic 10-year-old awed
by the giants, the Giantl, around
me.
It was a jewelled summer that
will glisten in my memory forever
— perfect, closed, complete as Will
Clark's home runjourneys around
the bases. Thinking I'd been to
the 'Stick for the last time this
season, I settled down to watch
my chiimpion/; win on television.
But now, in the October chill,
I am rich again. Last Saturday
night, I was back gathering
diamonds at Candlestick Park. My
best friend and I joined what was
at the time a crowd of 62,065 —
a record turnout for Candlestick
until 13 more showed up for Sun
day's game — as we watched the
Giants out hit, outrun, and out
shine the mutant Cubs (not
miracle but only accident can ex
plain that club's success this
year).
Both of us have been loyal, dis
appointed baseball fans since
childhood. Liz, who graduated

from Stanford in 1988, has en
dured the annual heartbreak that
the Red Sox dole out to their faith
ful. Such pathos, born of the suf
fering of loving a team that's good
enough to win and doesn't — un
like the sorrow of Cubs fans, who
cry about a team that is consis
tently incompetent — touched my
Heart, and I too became a BoSox
fan.
Of course, I was reared by my
father to be a true-blue Giants
fan; but 1 grew up in the '70s,
when the team was doing so
poorly that anyone could get a
box seat. Dad told me about the
'62 Series — he was there for the
last game, the last out, the last
hope — but I couldn't believe the
Giants would ever play in the Fall
Classic again. I was embarrassed
at school to tell people I liked the
Oiai\ts. Nobody likes a loser
(except Cubs fans).
But ! thi* summer I have been
vindicated, $nd Liz, who never
paid mucn attention to the Na
tional league, especially the West
ern Division, became a Giants fan
ak well. Now the two of us,
sharing together the scars of loss,
as well as a health} hatred for
the Yankees, Dodgers ;md Mets,
sat in the upper level box seats
(section 16, box IC, seats 11 and
12), witnessing the winning ways
of our winning team.
First, though, we had to get
there. I figured if we left at 3:30
p.m., we would make it in tune
for the opening pitch nt 5t20 p.m.
And we did make it . /. barely It
took us 4fi minutes to travel the
first 20-odd miles; it took us an
other 45 minutes to travel the
four miles from the freeway into
ft dirt parking lot.
My '69 Chevy Malibu, graced

with a beautiful V-8 idling engine,
overheated, as did my temper. A
ticket scalper looked at the steam
rising from my radiator as he
walked by waving his wares. "Girl,
you need water," he said. Thanks
buddy.
At 5:12, we parked the car and
raced across the dirt, the street,
the full parking lot, through the
gates and onto the overburdened
escalator at Gate F. Now it was
5:18, and we emerged from the
escalator at a point exactly oppo
site our seats along the third-base
line.
In a most unladylike fashion,
we raced through concession lines
and milling crowds, pausing only
to relinquish five bucks for a mag
azine so I could use the scorecard
in the back. We arrived at our
seats just in time to hear the very
last strains of the national an
them, sung by the garishly cos
tumed cast of "Beach Blanket
Babylon." As we took our seats,
I looked around and discovered
myself surrounded by Cubs fans.
Now, while I habitually
despised certain teams, as previ
ously mentioned, 1 had never
hated any baseball fan simply for
his or her loyalties. Never, that
is, until last Saturday night. At
my first postseason baseball
game, I underwent the necessary
and irreversible metamorphosis
from a fan who cheers for her
own team into a fan who vilifies
her team's opponents and attacks
their fans.
*'H£ started it first,'' 1 said to
Lir. as ahe returned from the con
cision line to find me traiiing
insults with the Cubs fan sitting
in front of us. Prybabty weary of
my loud and fervent cfle» ring for
my belnml Giants, he krmed back
in the. fourth inning and, crowed
to me. "No outs and the Cubs
have the loaded. What do
you think of that''*
I can't print what I thought of
that, and if I'd told him what I
thought of him that moment the
ushers would have come and
ejected me for anti-social behavior.
