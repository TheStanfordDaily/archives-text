After an 8-7 victory over No. 2 UC-Irvine

stretched its win streak to 12 by ending
the weekend with a 6-5 decision over USC
and an 11-6 trouncing of Air Force.

Though the game against USC was
played just 18 hours after the Irvine con
test, it was not mental or physical fatigue
that kept the game close.
"Everybody was psyched to play," Coach
Dante Dettamanti said. "We just missed
our shots."
The No. 6-ranked Trojans jumped out
to a first-quarter lead of 1-0 and matched
goals with Stanford in the second, ending
the first half with a 2-1 lead. Despite the
halftime score, however, Stanford was play
ing well.

"We were outplaying them in the first
half," Dettamanti said. "We were just not
shooting well. We must have made 20 shots
in the first half, and their goalie probably
had three saves. The rest were wide or off
the bar."
In the second half, the Cardinal broke
out of its shooting slump. At the end of
the third quarter, the score was knotted
at 4-4. In the fourth, Stanford surged ahead
with two tallies, making the score 6-4. USC
scored late, but Stanford ran out the clock
and took home the victory.
Jon Swerdloff was the high scorer with
two goals. Steve Millham, Rick McNair,
Greg Morris and Chuck Maguy had one
each.
The team's game against No. 12 Air Force
proved easier than expected. Air Force, con
sidered by Dettamanti to be "the best team
outside of California," was overwhelmed
early by the Stanford offense. After scoring
eight goals in the first half, the Cardinal
witnessed some tough Falcon goalkeeping
and managed only three in the second.
"We went ahead early and just cruised,"
Dettamanti said.
