# Green shows he's just short of being perfect
## 
### 
I like Denny Green.
I just wanted to say that
right up front. I think he's a
great coach and has done a large
number of good things to the
Stanford football program. But
after I've said all that, there are
a few bones I have to pick with
the man.
Not too many. But a couple.
The first is that kickoff thing
we tried to do Saturday against
Notre Dame. For those of you who
didn't see the game, here's the
background.
Notre Dame's kickoff returner
is a guy named Raghib Ismail.
They call him the Rocket, and it's
not because he hangs out at Cape
Canaveral. He's got blazing speed
and more moves than that guy
you saw at that party Saturday
night.
He ran back two kickoffs for
touchdowns in one game against
Rice last year to establish a name
for himself. This year, in the game
between No. 1 Notre Dame and
No. 2 Michigan, the Wolverines
played the Irish pretty even for
the first half. Ismail returned two
kicks for touchdowns in the sec
ond half — of 89 and 92 yards
— to singlehandedly win the
game. Basically, people have been
scared to death about kicking to
Ismail since then.
That's fair. The guy
definitely has proven that
he's the best kickoff
returner in college football. So
Green decided that we would play
it safe and try to keep Ismail from
launching himself against the
Cardinal. His plan was pretty
simple: kick the ball off really high
to about the Irish 25, have the
coverage team race down there
and force someone other than Is
mail to make a fair catch.
The first time Stanford tried
it, the plan worked — sort of.
John Hopkins took a short run-up
and kicked the ball high into the
air. The Cardinal coverage team
raced down the field, and Rodney
Culver signalled for a fair catch.
Ismail ended up catching the
ball at the Notre Dame 23 and
took off running, but Culver's sig
nal was in effect. The five-yard
delay of game penalty gave the
Irish the ball at their 18.
Green should have realized at
this point, however, that his idea
was not going to work that well.
First, his idea was for someone
else to catch the ball, but Ismail
had enough time to get under the
high kick and field it. Second,
Green wanted to force a fair catch,
but Ismail had no intention of
making a fair catch.
Stanford's second kickoff was
great. Ismail and his cohorts had
crept up to around the 15 to field
the short kick. Then Hopkins,
again taking the short run-up,
booted one over their heads.
The third kickoff, at the start
of the second half, was similar to
the first, except no fair catch was
signalled, and Ismail returned the
kick from the 20 to the 33. At
this point, it seemed obvious that
the strategy of denying Ismail the
ball was not working at all.
It got even more obvious.
Stanford had tied the game at
14; then Hopkins kicked high to
the Irish 18. The Stanford cover
age team was way back at the 35,
however, so Ismail eschewed the
fair catch, fielded the kick, tucked
it under his arm and pushed the
launch button. Sixty-six yards lat
er, Alan Grant disarmed the
Rocket at the Stanford 16. The

Irish scored in lour plays and
Stanford never got within seven
points again.
Now, I see nothing wrong
with treating Ismail with
respect by trying to kick
away from him. But he shouldn't
be treated like Superman.
Basically, Green treated Ismail
like he was from another planet.
Stanford's defense is designed to
react to what the opponent likes
to do but also to be so aggressive
that it forces the opponent to react
to what it does. Against Ismail,
however, Green and Stanford did
all the reacting, and Ismail did
what he pleased.

If Green's strategy worked, he
would be giving the Irish field
position at their 30 or so every
time. My feeling is that you don't
want to give Notre Dame that
kind of edge if you can help it.
Meanwhile, after only a week of
practice, Stanford's coverage of
this type of kick cannot be ex
pected to be as good as the stand
ard coverage the team uses in its
10 other games. And you don't
want to give Ismail that type of
edge.
In summation, don't try to up
set the top team in the country
by being cautious, especially
when, by using caution, you create
additional, different risks.
Of course it's easy for me to
second-guess Green after the
fact. . . .
My other big peeve is
Green's play-calling in
certain instances. The
score is 0-0 in the first quarter
Saturday, and Stanford is facing
a third-and-12 situation on the
Irish 17. Almost all of Stanford's
running backs are injured, espe
cially the fast ones, so the odds
of the Cardinal rushing for the
first down against Notre Dame
are about nil.
On the other hand, Stanford
has been moving the ball well
through the air. Stanford had 49
yards through the air and nega
tive yards rushing on the drive.
Logic would dictate trying to
throw for the first down (or into
the end zone) in an effort to get
a big jump on Notre Dame. If the
receiver isn't open, unload the ball
into the stands and kick the field
goal.
Green's call, however, was send
ing fullback Tommy Vardell off
tackle. He got zero yards.
True, he moved the ball into
the middle of the field to make
the field goal a little easier. But
all 86,000 people in the stands
wanted to see the team at least
try for the touchdown. You have
to go for the gusto if you expect
to beat No. 1.
The thing is, Green has done
this before. Against Oregon, on
third-and-seven, fullback Scott
Eschelman ran for one yard up
