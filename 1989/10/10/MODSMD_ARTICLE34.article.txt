# Giants clinch, stomp Cubs 3-2

### 
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -
The San Francisco Giants got
the ultimate Thrill from Will
and the Bay Area got its ultim
ate World Series.
Will Clark's bases-loaded
single with two outs in the
eighth inning gave the Giants a
3-2 victory over the Chicago
Cubs. With yesterday's victory,
San Francisco took the National
League pennant and set up a
Bay Bridge Series starting Sat
urday night against the Oakland
Athletics.
Clark, in one of the greatest
postseason performances ever,
set an NL playoff record with
13 hits and 24 total bases. His
single to center off Cubs ace
reliever Mitch Williams gave the
Giants their first pennant since
1962, four games to one.
The Cubs, though, fought un
til the end. With two out in the
ninth inning, Giants reliever
Steve Bedrosian gave up three
straight singles and a run before
retiring Ryne Sandberg on a
grounder to second.
Cubs Manager Don Zimmer,
who was second-guessed several
times in the series for not
changing pitchers, tempted fate
and Clark once too often.

Starter Mike Bielecki, who al
lowed only three hits in 7% in
nings, walked pinch-hitter
Candy Maldonaldo, Brett Butler
and Robby Thompson with two
outs in the eighth to load the
bases. Clark, who had eight RBI
in the series, then did what has
come to be expected.
It was yet another disappoint
ing loss for the Cubs, who have
not won a World Series since
beating Detroit in 1908 and
have not even been to one since
1945.
It was the 16th NL pennant
for the Giants since the World
Series started in 1903, with 14
coming when the team played
in New York. The Giants last
won a World Series in 1954
when they swept Cleveland.
It was the first time the
Giants have clinched a title of
any kind at Candlestick Park
and sets up the first "Subway
Series" since 1956 when the
New York Yankees beat the
Brooklyn Dodgers in seven
games.
The Giants and Athletics have
met each other three times in
the World Series, the last com
ing in 1913 when the A's played
in Philadelphia.

Rick Reuschel pitched eight
innings, allowing an unearned
run and seven hits.
Unlike the first four games,
the starting pitchers were in
command.
Reuschel, bombed in Game 2
at Chicago, allowed just the
tainted run in the third inning
and Bielecki pitched six score
less innings before the Giants
tied it.
Almost predictably, Clark
played the part of hero again
for the Giants and led off the
seventh with a triple into the
right-field corner.
Kevin Mitchell followed with
a sacrifice fly to deep center
field, tying the score.
The Cubs had runners at first
and third in the eighth with two
outs, but Reuschel got Andre
Dawson to hit a grounder back
to the mound, increasing to 14
the number of runners Dawson
left on base in the series.
With one out in the third,
Mitchell lost Walton's high fly
to left in the sun for a two-base
error.
Mitchell had his sunglasses on
but did not flip them down. The
ball glanced off his glove and
bounced a few feet away
