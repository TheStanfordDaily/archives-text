Stanford fans of all ages were
arrested Saturday during pre
game celebrations in front of
Stanford stadium.
Although the majority of
revelers were students, several
alumni in their 60s who were in
volved in a fist fight were also
cited.
Traditionally, fraternities, so
rorities and other student and
alumni groups hold tailgater par
ties before home football games,
and occasionally the police are un
wanted guests.
Several students said the break
ups of tailgaters before this week
end's Notre Dame game were
unfair and constituted harass
ment on the part of the Stanford
Police.
While at least four people were

cited as minors in possession of
alcohol, several students who were
over 21 were also forced to pour
out their beer, according to John
Connolly, president of the Sigma
Alpha Epsilon fraternity.
The SAE tailgater, held with
the Kappa Kappa Gamma and Pi
Beta Phi sororities, was among
those broken up by the police.
According to Pi Phi Social Man
ager Elizabeth Collett, police of
ficers approached a 21-year-old
SAE member who was asleep in
side his car. The officers woke
him up and gave him the choice
of going to the hospital or being
arrested, Collett said.
Although Connolly said the stu
dent was sober, he added, "I guess
the police assumed he was heavily
intoxicated at the time."
The student had been sleeping
out all night to save seats for the

fraternity and said he was too
tired when police tried to convince
him to leave the car, Connolly
said.
The student chose to go to the
hospital, and an ambulance ar
rived to transport him. A doctor
at the hospital said the student
was fine, and he returned to the
game by halftime.
The student, who did not want
to be identified, said "I think what
happened to me was ridiculous.
It never should have happened."
According to Collett, "It seems
the police were doing more harm
than good, and they had better
things to do than break up an
innocent tailgater that wasn't out
of control."
