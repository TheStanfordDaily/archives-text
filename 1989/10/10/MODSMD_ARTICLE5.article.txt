"I am often asked what is going
on in Poland. The citizens don't
even know what's going on in
Poland. Things are changing so
quickly that we all have to adjust
to the changes. I would say that
ail my 46 years of life experience
are invalid," Polish journalist and
historian Maciej Kozlowski told a
crowd of 140 last night in Florence
Moore Lounge.
"I was born during Nazi occu
pation. I was raised under a Com
munist system and learned how
to live in Communist system. 1
believed there was them and us.
We were in opposition, and they
were governing. Now all has
changed. Now, we have our own
government," he said.
"That's really nice feeling to

have our own government. For
the first time I feel at home in
my own country. It's a great
feeling."
However, Kozlowski said there
was a price for such a feeling.
"Everything has its high price,
and the Polish price for this de
mocracy and freedom we have . . .
is total ruin of the Polish eco
nomy.
"That's why the Communists
have given the power to us. If the
economy was still in more or less
good shape, they wouldn't give it
to us. There is a direct connection
between the economic situation
and the political freedom. "The
Communists are not exchanging
guns for butter, but are exchang
ing freedom for lack of butter.
The less butter, the more free
dom," said Kozlowski.

With the floundering economy
and high inflation, Poland's
unique experiment of trying to
change peacefully from totalitari
anism to non-totalitarianism is
made more difficult.
"I think the things that are hap
pening in Poland right now are
some of the most important events
happening in the 20th century.
We are experimenting to see if it's
possible to change from totalitari
anism to non-totalitarianism
peacefully. If we succeed in
Poland, it will be an example that
this peaceful way is possible.
"The danger is in the conflict
of ideals, not in the buildup of
arms. If we fail, I predict a very
set scenario, not only for our part
of the world, but for the entire
