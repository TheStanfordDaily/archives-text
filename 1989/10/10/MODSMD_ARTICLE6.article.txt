# Disabled students face obstacles

Editor's note: This is the first
of a four-part series on the ex
periences of disabled individ
uals at Stanford,

Last year's report of the Uni
versity Committee on Minority
Issues sparked extensive discus
sion of the minority experience
at Stanford. However, there is
one minority group that is often
overlooked â€” the disabled com
munity.

"It's irritating that handi
capped students are never in
cluded as minorities in issues
like UCMI," said Donna
Webster, a junior with a dis
ability that often requires her
to use a wheelchair. "We're
probably one of the 'minoritiest'
groups around."
Whether blind, deaf or in a
wheelchair, disabled students
encounter difficulties every day
with books, lectures, stairs and
other obstacles.
For moral support and aca
demic resources, disabled stu
dents can turn to the Disability
Resource Center. In addition to
establishing a supportive com
munity, the staff of the Center
works to make sure that dis
abled students are not excluded
from any facet of student life.
"It is not tenable for people
to be excluded in any way," said
Jim Bouquin, director and foun
der of the Center. "We are all
trying to emerge as a multicul
tural community. Disability is,

or ought to be, one more stripe
in multiculturalism."
Ten years ago, only six dis
abled students were enrolled at
Stanford. Today the Center
maintains contact with 85 dis
abled students, and Bouquin es
timates that there may be as
many as 40 more enrolled at
Stanford.
The Center provides services
for people with hearing, vision,
mobility and learning dis
abilities. In addition, it helps
people with severe respiratory
problems, severe diabetes, no
hands and other disabilities.
For blind or low vision stu
dents, reader service volunteers
record textbooks, read materials
to these students and help them
do research. The Center also
finds interpreters for deaf stu
dents.
"The primary commodity in
the University is information.
It is the institution's responsi
bility to get information to a
person in a mode that is appro
priate," Bouquin said.
In addition, disabled students
often have difficulty gaining
access to classrooms and resi
dences.
There are certain classrooms
on campus that are not
wheelchair-accessible, including
the second floor of buildings in
the Inner Quad. Students as
signed to classrooms they can
not reach should inform the
Registrar's office, Registrar
Sally Mahoney said.
She added that her office "will
work with the instructor to find
a classroom where all students
can take the class."
According to Jennifer Gould,
former manager of the Univer
sity's Accessibility Improvement
Project, the campus is much
more accessible than it was five
years ago. The University is
committed to making ongoing

improvements, and the only ob
stacle is money, she said. Gould
added that costs are hard to es
timate, as they vary according
to project and location.
The placement of one ramp
in Escondido Village cost about
$20,000 and the price of install
ing electric doors in many
campus buildings is "$3,000 to
$5,000 a pop," Gould said.
In addition, Bouqin said much
of the campus is easy to reach
because of its flat topography.
It is difficult, however, to esti
mate just how much of the
campus is accessible, he said.
"When someone talks about
percentage of accessibility, I
want to know what they mean,"
Bouquin said. "If there is a
ramp to a building, but a person
can't get in the door because
it's hard to maneuver, then the
building is not accessible."
According to Bouquin, Stan
ford has fulfilled its legal man
date and all facilities that house
programs can be reached.
However, bv law, buildings do
