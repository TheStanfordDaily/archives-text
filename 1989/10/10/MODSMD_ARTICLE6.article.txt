# Disabled students face obstacles

Editor's note: This is the first
of a four-part series on the ex
periences of disabled individ
uals at Stanford,

Last year's report of the Uni
versity Committee on Minority
Issues sparked extensive discus
sion of the minority experience
at Stanford. However, there is
one minority group that is often
overlooked — the disabled com
munity.

AT STAMFORD

"It's irritating that handi
capped students are never in
cluded as minorities in issues
like UCMI," said Donna
Webster, a junior with a dis
ability that often requires her
to use a wheelchair. "We're
probably one of the 'minoritiest'
groups around."
Whether blind, deaf or in a
wheelchair, disabled students
encounter difficulties every day
with books, lectures, stairs and
other obstacles.
For moral support and aca
demic resources, disabled stu
dents can turn to the Disability
Resource Center. In addition to
establishing a supportive com
munity, the staff of the Center
works to make sure that dis
abled students are not excluded
from any facet of student life.
"It is not tenable for people
to be excluded in any way," said
Jim Bouquin, director and foun
der of the Center. "We are all
trying to emerge as a multicul
tural community. Disability is,

or ought to be, one more stripe
in multiculturalism."
Ten years ago, only six dis
abled students were enrolled at
Stanford. Today the Center
maintains contact with 85 dis
abled students, and Bouquin es
timates that there may be as
many as 40 more enrolled at
Stanford.
The Center provides services
for people with hearing, vision,
mobility and learning dis
abilities. In addition, it helps
people with severe respiratory
problems, severe diabetes, no
hands and other disabilities.
For blind or low vision stu
dents, reader service volunteers
record textbooks, read materials
to these students and help them
do research. The Center also
finds interpreters for deaf stu
dents.
"The primary commodity in
the University is information.
It is the institution's responsi
bility to get information to a
person in a mode that is appro
priate," Bouquin said.
In addition, disabled students
often have difficulty gaining
access to classrooms and resi
dences.
There are certain classrooms
on campus that are not
wheelchair-accessible, including
the second floor of buildings in
the Inner Quad. Students as
signed to classrooms they can
not reach should inform the
Registrar's office, Registrar
Sally Mahoney said.
She added that her office "will
work with the instructor to find
a classroom where all students
can take the class."
According to Jennifer Gould,
former manager of the Univer
sity's Accessibility Improvement
Project, the campus is much
more accessible than it was five
years ago. The University is
committed to making ongoing

improvements, and the only ob
stacle is money, she said. Gould
added that costs are hard to es
timate, as they vary according
to project and location.
The placement of one ramp
in Escondido Village cost about
$20,000 and the price of install
ing electric doors in many
campus buildings is "$3,000 to
$5,000 a pop," Gould said.
In addition, Bouqin said much
of the campus is easy to reach
because of its flat topography.
It is difficult, however, to esti
mate just how much of the
campus is accessible, he said.
"When someone talks about
percentage of accessibility, I
want to know what they mean,"
Bouquin said. "If there is a
ramp to a building, but a person
can't get in the door because
it's hard to maneuver, then the
building is not accessible."
According to Bouquin, Stan
ford has fulfilled its legal man
date and all facilities that house
programs can be reached.
However, bv law, buildings do

of the row and fraternity houses
are inaccessible due to stairs.
Stairs must also be considered
when assigning disabled students
to campus housing. Stairs may
make it impossible for a student
to live in particular residences and
often limit a student to the first
floor. In addition, many disabled
students have to live near the cen
ter of campus to be able to get
to class. In such cases, the student
can request to be exempted from
the Draw.
According to Bill Georges, as
sistant director of housing, "The
(disabled) student must rank her
or his preferences for housing and
explain why those residences meet
their needs."
Sometimes the Housing office
suggests that students go through
the normal Draw procedure, and
if they do not receive a residence
which is feasible for them, they
are assigned as spaces open up.
The disabled student can ask

not have to be accessible as long
as disabled people can utilize the
programs or resources they house,
Bouquin explained.
"If Green Library was not
wheelchair accessible, but we had
a service that could go there and
bring the books to the [disabled]
student, that would satisfy the
law," he said. "But we want to
empower students to do things for
themselves."
Although much of Stanford is
accessible, Webster said her
wheelchair still prohibits her from
reaching many places on campus.
"I don't think people realize
what's inaccessible. I lived in
Cedro this summer, and the
laundry room is down three
flights of stairs," she said.
Webster also noted that many

1964, it's finally a law that you can't discrimi
nate against disabled people.'

for a particular roommate but is
asked to limit the request to one
person, Georges added.
Another important issue the
disabled community must address
is employment. According to Bou
quin, of all groups, disabled people
are the least employed, having a
two-thirds unemployment rate.
Even though disabled students
at Stanford are exceptional, "they
still face more (employment) bar
riers than their peers," Bouquin
said.
The Center employs disabled
students and staff and is working
to increase the number of disabled
University employees.
"It was just this year that na

tional civil rights legislation for
the disabled was passed," Bou
quin noted. "Twenty-five years
after the Civil Rights Act of 1964,
it's finally a law that you can't
discriminate against disabled
people."
In additon to the Center, there
are several disabled student or
ganizations on campus, including
support groups for disabled
women and students with learning
disabilities. There is also a
speaker's bureau which goes to
dorms and houses to discuss dis
abilities with non-disabled stu
dents.
"I don't know what's sparked
it, but there has been a growing

community of disabled students
in the past year," said Allison
May, a junior who is involved with
the Center, the speaker's bureau
and a women's group.
According to May, the speaker's
bureau started last spring and is
modeled after the Gay and Les
bian Alliance speaker's bureau.
The women's group, she said, is
a community support group.
"There are issues that confront
all women that are doubly so for
disabled women," May said. Some
of these issues are the threat of
rape, low job expectations and
learning to deal with generally ac
cepted stereotypes of what is con
sidered attractive, she said.
Although there is still much
room for improvement in ac
comodating disabled students,
Bouquin said Stanford "is a ter
rific model," adding that other
colleges, including Brown Univer
sity, are trying to follow its lead.
According to Bouquin, "Most

highly selective schools don't
really accommodate students with
disabilities."
Jannette Sampson, a legally
blind sophomore who uses many
of the Center's services, agreed
with Bouquin's assessment.
"I was thinking about going to
Dartmouth, so I called them, and
they said that they had a dean of
something, something, something
whooe fifth million priority it was
to help the disabled," Sampson
said. "They said, 'Well, we're re
quired by law to accomodate you,
so we'll work something out.' But
that was totally bogus."
"It really makes a difference if
there is someone whose job it is
to look out for you," Bouquin said.
"[Disabled] people are more em
powered because there are more
of them around," he said. "I'm
seeing that people are no longer
ashamed of their disabilities.
They're saying, 'It's part of me
— just like my hair color.' "
