Jobs stresses leadership values
The best employees want to be led, not man
aged, Steve Jobs, president of NeXT, Inc., told a
standing-room-only audience at the Graduate
School of Business Oct. 5.
"Management by objective doesn't work. By
the time you find out someone didn't do a very
good job, it's too late and you're out of business,"
Jobs said.
"The only thing I've seen that works is what
someone has called management by values. Find
people who are competent and really bright, but

more important, people who care about exactly
the same things you care about. They're extraor
dinarily likely to make the same decisions you
would make."
Jobs was one of the founders of Apple Com
puter.
