UNDERGRADUATE HONORS PROGRAM IN EDUCATION
The Stanford School of Education recently introduced an honors program
that will enable qualified undergraduates to engage in EDUCATIONAL RE
SEARCH Each snident's work in Education, and especially the honors the
sis, will build upon work done in the undergraduate major department. (An
average grade of B+ in the major field is required for entry.) Thus, for ex

a philosophy major would work with one of the School's philosphers of ed
ucation. Most undergraduate majors can be catered to. Students just starting
their junior year are encouraged to apply. (However, enrollment in honors
classes in Education is generally not restricted to honors students.)
