# Kennedy will not step in
## ASSU Senate, BSU continue to urge intervention 
### John Wagner Editorial staff 
As pleas increased yesterday for
University President Donald Ken
nedy to intervene in the Louis
Jackson case, Kennedy said there
was no reason to do so based on
the evidence he has seen.
Despite heavy lobbying by the
administration, the ASSU Senate
passed a resolution last night call
ing on Kennedy to intervene on
Jackson's behalf. Earlier in the
day, at a noon press conference,
members of the Black Student
Union and the United Stanford
Workers condemned Kennedy's
non-intervention.
Jackson, an ASSU senator and
vice chair of the BSU, is facing
six misdemeanor charges — in
cluding incitement to riot and bat
tery — in connection with the
May 15 takeover of Kennedy's of
fice.
Jackson is the only student in

facing incitement and battery
charges. He returns to court to
morrow morning for a pre-trial
hearing.
Those who are supporting Jack
son feel he has been unfairly sin
gled out by the district attorney
and are calling on Kennedy to
publicly condemn the unequal
treatment.
But Kennedy said in an inter
view last night that he had not
seen any evidence indicating that
Jackson was the victim of selec
tive prosecution. "Right now,
there's no basis for believing he
has been unfairly singled out,"
Kennedy said. "What we need is
something more than assertions."
Kennedy said he has no inten

tion of issuing a statement of out
rage at Jackson's treatment, as he
has been called upon to do. "I
don't know what fact I'm sup
posed to be outraged by," he said.
At yesterday's press conference,
BSU Chair Calvin Martin said
Kennedy's refusal to intervene in
Jackson's case is "unethical and
morally questionable." Kennedy
has "washed his hands" of Jack
son and delivered him to the dis
trict attorney, Martin said.
Those supporting Jackson feel
the use of evidence against him
is highly suspect. According to the
police report issued following the
May 15 takeover, Jackson incited
those outside Building 10 by tell
ing them to block a police bus
used to detain arrested prisoners.
The report says a police videotape
made at the protest shows Jack
son inciting the crowd.
The report says that other pro
testers were also inciting the
