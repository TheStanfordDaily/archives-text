# Kennedy will not step in
## ASSU Senate, BSU continue to urge intervention 
### John Wagner Editorial staff 
As pleas increased yesterday for
University President Donald Ken
nedy to intervene in the Louis
Jackson case, Kennedy said there
was no reason to do so based on
the evidence he has seen.
Despite heavy lobbying by the
administration, the ASSU Senate
passed a resolution last night call
ing on Kennedy to intervene on
Jackson's behalf. Earlier in the
day, at a noon press conference,
members of the Black Student
Union and the United Stanford
Workers condemned Kennedy's
non-intervention.
Jackson, an ASSU senator and
vice chair of the BSU, is facing
six misdemeanor charges — in
cluding incitement to riot and bat
tery — in connection with the
May 15 takeover of Kennedy's of
fice.
Jackson is the only student in
volved with the protest who is

■ Judge delays hearing for
four other protesters, page 12

facing incitement and battery
charges. He returns to court to
morrow morning for a pre-trial
hearing.
Those who are supporting Jack
son feel he has been unfairly sin
gled out by the district attorney
and are calling on Kennedy to
publicly condemn the unequal
treatment.
But Kennedy said in an inter
view last night that he had not
seen any evidence indicating that
Jackson was the victim of selec
tive prosecution. "Right now,
there's no basis for believing he
has been unfairly singled out,"
Kennedy said. "What we need is
something more than assertions."
Kennedy said he has no inten

tion of issuing a statement of out
rage at Jackson's treatment, as he
has been called upon to do. "I
don't know what fact I'm sup
posed to be outraged by," he said.
At yesterday's press conference,
BSU Chair Calvin Martin said
Kennedy's refusal to intervene in
Jackson's case is "unethical and
morally questionable." Kennedy
has "washed his hands" of Jack
son and delivered him to the dis
trict attorney, Martin said.
Those supporting Jackson feel
the use of evidence against him
is highly suspect. According to the
police report issued following the
May 15 takeover, Jackson incited
those outside Building 10 by tell
ing them to block a police bus
used to detain arrested prisoners.
The report says a police videotape
made at the protest shows Jack
son inciting the crowd.
The report says that other pro
testers were also inciting the

crowd, but does not identify them.
According to Asst. District Attor
ney Tom Fahrenholz, Jackson is
being charged because he is
named in the police report.
Yesterday, Martin questioned
Jackson's distinction by the dis
trict attorney.
"[Kennedy] knows, the press
knows, the police videotape shows
Louis was not the only participant
in the takeover, nor was he the
principal organizer," Martin said.
Kennedy said it was not appar
ent, based on his viewing of the
videotape, that others were incit
ing the crowd. He declined to com
ment on whether or not Jackson
appeared to be inciting the crowd
on tape.
At yesterday's press conference,
Law Prof. Charles Lawrence said
he was extremely disturbed by the
manner in which Jackson has
been singled out with additional
charges and called on Kennedy
"to come to [Jackson's] aid."
"Louis has been singled out
from among a number of students

who were engaged in the same
activity," Lawrence said. "This
process ... is common among the
police and is particularly loath
some when they select those mem
bers who are seen as most vul
nerable — and often the people
who are seen as most vulnerable
are blacks.
"The police count on the fact
that these individuals, those of us
who are black or people of color
or otherwise marginalized, will
not be supported by the rest of
the community.
"This is why the prosecutor has
singled out Louis Jackson — be
cause of his faith that the weight,
that the might of this great uni
versity will not stand behind
Louis Jackson. This is why I am
particularly disturbed and an
gered by the lack of action by the
administration so far."
USW representative Linda
Crouse said at the press confer
ence that she could "verify" that
"Donald Kennedy's administra
tion practices wall-to-wall dis
crimination."
The treatment of Jackson was
another example of this discrim
ination, she said.

According to Kennedy, the ad
ministration has been following
its Policy on Arrests Prosecutions
in regard to the Jackson case.
Drafted in 1985, the policy states
that Stanford does not interfere
with judicial proceedings once ar
rests of students have been made.
Lawrence said yesterday that
the University could stand behind
a general policy but also recognize
and speak out against "abuses"
of police and judicial authority.
Kennedy said he agreed with
Lawrence's point in principle, but
had no reason to believe the jud
icial system was being abused.
If evidence existed in the Jack
son case showing an abuse of the
system, "it would call for some
kind of comment," Kennedy said.
In yesterday's press conference,
the BSU continued to argue that
Kennedy had intervened in the
judicial system in the past. In
1985, following arrests made at a
sit-in in Old Union, Kennedy
wrote a letter to the Santa Clara
County Sheriff raising concern
about one black student, Robby
Perkins, who emerged from jail
with bruises on his body.

According to Kennedy, the let
ter he wrote in the Perkins case
did not set a precedent applicable
to Jackson's case. In the Perkins
case, Kennedy said, he requested
that information regarding the
treatment of Perkins be made
public, whereas he is being asked
to intervene in the judicial process
of Jackson's case.
The two actions "are not the
same thing at all," Kennedy said.
Jackson acted as master of cer
emonies at the press conference,
which was held in front of Build
ing 30 in the Inner Quad, where
the Afro-American studies pro
gram is located. Jackson said he
was standing in front of Building
30 because upgrading the Afro-
American studies program was
"the main issue I was fighting
for" in the takeover of Kennedy's
office.
The BSU has planned a silent
candlelight vigil this evening
which is scheduled to end in front
of Kennedy's office. According to
Martin, the vigil will be conducted
in "total silence" because "noth
ing more needs to be said" about
the injustices Jackson faces.

gered by the lack of action by the
administration so far."
USW representative Linda
Crouse said at the press confer
ence that she could "verify" that
"Donald Kennedy's administra
tion practices wall-to-wall dis
crimination."
The treatment of Jackson was
another example of this discrim
ination, she said.

According to Kennedy, the ad
ministration has been following
its Policy on Arrests Prosecutions
in regard to the Jackson case.
Drafted in 1985, the policy states
that Stanford does not interfere
with judicial proceedings once ar
rests of students have been made.
Lawrence said yesterday that
the University could stand behind
a general policy but also recognize
and speak out against "abuses"
of police and judicial authority.
Kennedy said he agreed with
Lawrence's point in principle, but
had no reason to believe the jud
icial system was being abused.
If evidence existed in the Jack
son case showing an abuse of the
system, "it would call for some
kind of comment," Kennedy said.
In yesterday's press conference,
the BSU continued to argue that
Kennedy had intervened in the
judicial system in the past. In
1985, following arrests made at a
sit-in in Old Union, Kennedy
wrote a letter to the Santa Clara
County Sheriff raising concern
about one black student, Robby
Perkins, who emerged from jail
with bruises on his body.

According to Kennedy, the let
ter he wrote in the Perkins case
did not set a precedent applicable
to Jackson's case. In the Perkins
case, Kennedy said, he requested
that information regarding the
treatment of Perkins be made
public, whereas he is being asked
to intervene in the judicial process
of Jackson's case.
The two actions "are not the
same thing at all," Kennedy said.
Jackson acted as master of cer
emonies at the press conference,
which was held in front of Build
ing 30 in the Inner Quad, where
the Afro-American studies pro
gram is located. Jackson said he
was standing in front of Building
30 because upgrading the Afro-
American studies program was
"the main issue I was fighting
for" in the takeover of Kennedy's
office.
The BSU has planned a silent
candlelight vigil this evening
which is scheduled to end in front
of Kennedy's office. According to
Martin, the vigil will be conducted
in "total silence" because "noth
ing more needs to be said" about
the injustices Jackson faces.
As pleas increased yesterday for
University President Donald Ken
nedy to intervene in the Louis
Jackson case, Kennedy said there
was no reason to do so based on
the evidence he has seen.
Despite heavy lobbying by the
administration, the ASSU Senate
passed a resolution last night call
ing on Kennedy to intervene on
Jackson's behalf. Earlier in the
day, at a noon press conference,
members of the Black Student
Union and the United Stanford
Workers condemned Kennedy's
non-intervention.
Jackson, an ASSU senator and
vice chair of the BSU, is facing
six misdemeanor charges — in
cluding incitement to riot and bat
tery — in connection with the
May 15 takeover of Kennedy's of
fice.
Jackson is the only student in
volved with the protest who is

■ Judge delays hearing for
four other protesters, page 12

facing incitement and battery
charges. He returns to court to
morrow morning for a pre-trial
hearing.
Those who are supporting Jack
son feel he has been unfairly sin
gled out by the district attorney
and are calling on Kennedy to
publicly condemn the unequal
treatment.
But Kennedy said in an inter
view last night that he had not
seen any evidence indicating that
Jackson was the victim of selec
tive prosecution. "Right now,
there's no basis for believing he
has been unfairly singled out,"
Kennedy said. "What we need is
something more than assertions."
Kennedy said he has no inten

tion of issuing a statement of out
rage at Jackson's treatment, as he
has been called upon to do. "I
don't know what fact I'm sup
posed to be outraged by," he said.
At yesterday's press conference,
BSU Chair Calvin Martin said
Kennedy's refusal to intervene in
Jackson's case is "unethical and
morally questionable." Kennedy
has "washed his hands" of Jack
son and delivered him to the dis
trict attorney, Martin said.
Those supporting Jackson feel
the use of evidence against him
is highly suspect. According to the
police report issued following the
May 15 takeover, Jackson incited
those outside Building 10 by tell
ing them to block a police bus
used to detain arrested prisoners.
The report says a police videotape
made at the protest shows Jack
son inciting the crowd.
The report says that other pro
testers were also inciting the

crowd, but does not identify them.
According to Asst. District Attor
ney Tom Fahrenholz, Jackson is
being charged because he is
named in the police report.
Yesterday, Martin questioned
Jackson's distinction by the dis
trict attorney.
"[Kennedy] knows, the press
knows, the police videotape shows
Louis was not the only participant
in the takeover, nor was he the
principal organizer," Martin said.
Kennedy said it was not appar
ent, based on his viewing of the
videotape, that others were incit
ing the crowd. He declined to com
ment on whether or not Jackson
appeared to be inciting the crowd
on tape.
At yesterday's press conference,
Law Prof. Charles Lawrence said
he was extremely disturbed by the
manner in which Jackson has
been singled out with additional
charges and called on Kennedy
"to come to [Jackson's] aid."
"Louis has been singled out
from among a number of students

who were engaged in the same
activity," Lawrence said. "This
process ... is common among the
police and is particularly loath
some when they select those mem
bers who are seen as most vul
nerable — and often the people
who are seen as most vulnerable
are blacks.
"The police count on the fact
that these individuals, those of us
who are black or people of color
or otherwise marginalized, will
not be supported by the rest of
the community.
"This is why the prosecutor has
singled out Louis Jackson — be
cause of his faith that the weight,
that the might of this great uni
versity will not stand behind
Louis Jackson. This is why I am
particularly disturbed and an
gered by the lack of action by the
