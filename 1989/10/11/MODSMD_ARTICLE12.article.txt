## Court rules for clinic 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - The
Supreme Court turned away free
speech arguments yesterday and
allowed the use of a federal rack
eteering law against 26 anti
abortion protesters in Philadel
phia.
The court let stand a successful
lawsuit against the protesters by
the operators of an abortion clinic
in that city.
Similar lawsuits, each invoking
the Racketeering Influenced and
Corrupt Organizations Act
(RICO), have been filed against
"pro-life" activists in cities such
as Pittsburgh, Chicago and Brook
line, Mass.
Using the federal law lets those
who win suits collect three times
whatever financial damages they
prove, a feature not available in
many suits filed under state law.
In the Philadelphia case, the clinic
operators were awarded about
$2,600 in tripled RICO damages.
In a series of past rulings, the
Supreme Court has permitted
broad use of the law — allowing
lawsuits by anyone whose prop
erty or business is harmed by a
"pattern" of illegal activities.

The litigation strategy has
proved troubling to some abortion
rights advocates, who fear that
political protesters will be labeled
"racketeers" and held financially
liable for nothing more than ex
pressing their views.
For example, American Civil
Liberties Union lawyer Antonio
Califa recently wrote: "The ACLU
believes that civil RICO's potential
for chilling First Amendment
rights of expression is enormous."
But in upholding a $108,000
award against the 26 Philadelphia
protesters last March, the 3rd
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said
their actions "went beyond ... con
stitutional rights of speech and
protest."
The tripled damages under
RICO formed only a small part
of the total damages. Of the
$108,000, $65,000 went to attor
ney's fees and more than $40,000
went to the clinic as non-RICO
damages.
The protesters on four occa
sions from 1984 to 1986 unlaw
fully entered the Northeast Wom
en's Center in Philadelphia. Ac

cording to trial testimony, protest
ers threw medical supplies on the
floor, damaged equipment, as
saulted the clinic's employees and
harassed patients.
Yesterday's action does not
preclude the nation's highest
court from granting review in
some future case in which more
peaceable anti-abortion demon
strators are sued under the rack
eteering law.
"This is one battle in a long
war," said Michael McMonagle,
one of the 26 Philadelphia pro
testers and executive director of
the Pro-Life Coalition of South
east Pennsylvania.
"We intend to continue our ef
forts to non-violently save children
and mothers from abortion at the
abortion facilities. This case will
not deter that one bit,"
McMonagle said.
Edmond A. Tiryak, the abortion
clinic's lawyer, said the Supreme
Court action "shows that our so
ciety will not tolerate the use of
fear and intimidation by religious
fanatics to impose their will on
women seeking abortion services."
