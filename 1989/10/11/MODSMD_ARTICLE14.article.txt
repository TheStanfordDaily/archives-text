# Space Shuttle Atlantis payload cleared for Monday launch

WASHINGTON (AP) — A federal judge
yesterday night rejected a request to
block the launch of the space shuttle
Atlantis and its nuclear-powered cargo,
saying "this court will not substitute its
own judgment" for that of space experts.
Three environmental groups had asked
that the liftoff be scrubbed on the
grounds the nuclear generators, used on
22 previous missions, posed unacceptable
risks.
"Countdown has already begun, and
the government states that the mission
is ready for launch," said U.S. District
Judge Oliver Gasch. "The court concludes
that NASA has complied with require
ments of the National Environmental
Protection Act."
After the judge ruled, though, the mis
sion was postponed, perhaps until Mon
day, because of a faulty engine control
system. It had been scheduled for launch
on Thursday.
The Florida Coalition for Peace and
Justice and two other environmental
groups had sought to stop the launch on
grounds that deadly plutonium-238
would spread across the skies of central

Florida in case of an accident.
"It is not the function of this court to
decide whether the government's decision
to go forward with the Galileo Mission
is a good one," he said in a written op
inion. Instead, he said, he only needed
to rule whether the environmental impact
statement filed by the National Aeronau
tics and Space Administration has enough
information "to allow the agency to take
a hard look at the issues and make a
reasoned decision."
Never before had a court been asked
to stop a manned launch.
Gasch said that granting a temporary
restraining order requested by the three
citizens' groups would have a costly ad
verse effect on the public interest — $164
million just to maintain the Galileo pro
-am until the next launch opportunity
in 18 months.
Long delays have already raised the
cost of the Galileo mission to $1.5 billion.
The three groups contended NASA
failed to follow environmental rules and
should be stopped from launching At

ability of an accident" that could spread

deadly plutonium over central Florida.
To gain momentum for its six-year trip
to Jupiter, the Galileo probe will be sent
looping around Venus and twice around
Earth. The citizens groups contend the
greatest danger will be when the probe
comes within 600 miles of Earth in De
cember 1990 and within 200 miles two
years later. But NASA says the chances
of an accident then are five in 10 million.
The probe will carry two electrical gen
erators, each carrying 24.7 pounds of
plutonium-238. These generators
produce electricity from the heat gener
ated by the radioactive decay of the
plutonium.
"An accidental plutonium release at
various stages of the mission mfgtrt ranse
an increase ih cancer rates — although
it is disputed whether increase would be

significant," Gasch said in his 17-page
opinion. "NASA concludes that the
residual risks associated with the Galileo
Mission are two to three times less than
many of the risks associated with
everyday life."
One of the plaintiff lawyers, Edward
Lee Rogers, said after the judge's /uling,
"We thought we had a very strong case
in terms of the violations of the National
Environmental Policy Act."
Rogers, attorney for the Florida Coa
lition for Peace and Justice, had argued
earlier that, "The so-called estimates of
risk are very tenuous themselves because
they (NASA) don't hat# good historical
data."

ence either," said Gasch at the hearing,
the day after the federal holiday honoring

the discoverer of America.
"He wasn't going to contaminate the
world," Rogers countered.
The coalition, which has threatened to
disrupt the launch physically if it doesn't
succeed in court, claims "irreparable
harm" can result if the shuttle should
have a launch explosion similar to the
one that destroyed Challenger and killed
its crew of seven in 1986.
"There is great disagreement as to the
likelihood of a plutonium release," said
Rogers.
But Steven Frank, a Department of
Justice lawyer arguing the NASA case,
accused the citizens groups of waiting
until the 11th hour before bringing their
suit and sitting out the environmental
hearings in the past few years.
"Some of the scientific missions
planned for Galileo would have to be
scrapped with a delay of even a few days,"
he told .Jtfdspß Gtfuch. NASA hopes to get
