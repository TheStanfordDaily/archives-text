Drug summit
WASHINGTON (AP) — President Bush has
accepted an invitation by the leaders of Peru,
Colombia and Bolivia to attend a summit con
ference on drugs, the White House announced
last night.
"The president will go," said White House press
secretary Marlin Fitzwater. He said that having
a summit within 90 days was "within the time
frame we have been considering. It's reasonable."
The three leaders are meeting in lea, Peru.
Their countries account for most of the cocaine
produced or processed in Latin America.
Fitzwater also said the United States had no
objection about inviting European leaders. The
press spokesman said the United States will be
in touch with Latin leaders concerning the time,
location and agenda items for a summit. He said
that security concerns would not stand in the
way of a summit. "That could be worked out."
As for a meeting Nov. 20 meeting of lower-level
officials for preliminary discussions, Fitzwater
said, "I'm sure that's fine with us."
Fitzwater said the most likely site for a summit
would be in one of the countries that extended
the invitation. He said the United States already
had considered having a drug summit in Jamaica,
Barbados, Venezuela and Colombia. "We've looked

at all kinds of options — I don't think that would
be an obstacle from our point of view."
More perestroika
Moscow (AP) — A three-eyed alien with a robot
sidekick landed by UFO and made a boy vanish
by zapping him with a pistol, a Soviet newspaper
reported yesterday, in a second day of strange
tales in the state-run media.
But as the bizarre saga of the space invasion
of the city of Voronezh unfolded for a second
day, a scientist whose words were used to buttress
the first published report voiced doubts, and said
he was in part misquoted.
"Don't believe all you hear from Tass," Genrikh
Silanov, head of the Voronezh Geophysical Lab
oratory, cautioned in a telephone interview with
The Associated Press from Voronezh. "We never
gave them part of what they published."
On Monday, the usually staid, official Soviet
news agency told the world that scientists had
confirmed an alien spaceship carrying giant
people with tiny heads had touched down in
Voronezh, a city of more than 800,000 people
about 300 miles southeast of Moscow.
As many as three aliens 13 feet tall left the
spacecraft, described as a large shining ball, and
walked in the park with a small robot.
