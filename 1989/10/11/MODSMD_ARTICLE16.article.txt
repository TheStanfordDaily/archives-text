# Florida commences abortion battle
## 
### 
TALAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -
State lawmakers yesterday con
vened a special session on abor
tion that drew thousands of chant
ing demonstrators and national
attention, although the Legisla
ture's Democratic leaders pre
dicted no new restrictions.
Republican Gov. Bob Martinez
called the 3-day session soon after
the U.S. Supreme Court in July
upheld a Missouri law giving the
state more authority to regulate
abortions.
Martinez's proposals include
banning public financing and use
of public resources for abortions,
expanding regulations for abor
tion clinics, requiring viability
tests on the fetuses of women who
are at least 20 weeks pregnant
and requiring physicians to tell
women seeking abortions about
the development of their fetuses.
Both the House and Senate met
for about a half-hour yesterday
and referred numerous bills,
many of them abortion-related, to
committees, which began work.
In the first vote of the session,
the Senate Health and Rehabilita
tive Services Committee rejected
by a 9-3 vote a seven-day waiting

period so a woman could undergo
pre-abortion counseling. The
panel also rejected by the same
margin a ban on use of public
funds, employees or facilities for
abortions.
The Senate Health and
Rehabilitative Services Commit
tee defeated the first four bills
yesterday, proposals which would
have pushed viability require
ments from 24 to 20 weeks, ban
public resources for abortion,
create a state center to promote
adoption as an alternative to abor
tion, and force women to wait a
week and undergo counseling
before having an abortion.
The head of the Senate Health
Care Committee, Sen. Jeanne
Malchon, predicted last night that
four other bills her panel was
scheduled to debate today will also
be defeated.
The House HRS committee,
meanwhile, heard testimony but
planned no action until later in
the week.
Despite widespread criticism by
Democrats that the session will
accomplish nothing and may
result in unconstitutional law,
Martinez repeated his view that

the entire package should be con
sidered.
"Having a hearing on each of
these bills is important to the
people of Florida," Martinez said.
"All of these, I think, deserve a
good debate." Inside, Senate
President Bob Crawford and
House Speaker Tom Gustafson,
both Democrats, promised that
both houses would give Martinez's
proposals due consideration.
There had been talk of ending
the session a few minutes after
it begins, but Crawford said that
wouldn't happen.
"I think they'll all be consid
ered," he said of the abortion pro
posals. "We will abide by the rules
of the Senate and I will enforce
those rules fairly."
Both Democrats predicted no
new restrictions on access to abor
tions, especially since the state
Supreme Court ruled last week
that the state's privacy law
protects a woman's right to an
abortion. The court knocked down
as unconstitutional a 1988
parental-consent law for Florida
minors seeking abortions and
protected women's abortion rights
in the first trimester.
