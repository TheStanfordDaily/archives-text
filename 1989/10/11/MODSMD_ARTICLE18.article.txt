## No double coverage 
### 
ASSU should welcome
senior class back
with open arms

RAGHIB ISMAIL, Notre
Dame's dangerous flanker
who has a kickoff return
average of 49.7 yards with two
touchdown runbacks in one game,
may need double coverage.
Stanford's Senior Class surely
does not.
Every year, the class organizes
several events for the class to get
together — regular Senior Pub
Nights, Full Moon in the Quad,
Senior Disorientation and Senior
Casino Night.
The class was created by the
ASSU Bylaws and was an ASSU
organization until June 6, when
the ASSU Senate's knees jerked
after hearing the cost of the new
insurance plan for the ASSU.
Before last March, the ASSU was
covered by a Constitution State
policy with an annual premium of
$15,000. When that company
pulled out of the California insur
ance game after Proposition 13 was
implemented, the ASSU negotiated
a new policy with Tri-Star Indem
nity for $45,000 per year.
That policy would run from
March 1989, when Constitution
State pulled out, until March 1990.
The tripling of the premium
caused the Office of Student Af
fairs, which pays for two-thirds of
the annual premium, to throw up
a red flag and call on the ASSU
to investigate ways to cut the cost.
In a meeting with key administra
tors and insurance personnel, two
liabilities were mentioned as pos
sible reasons for the increase —
the Boathouse and the Senior
Class.
The Boathouse was bulldozed at

the end of last month, removing
that as a liability for now.
The Senior Class was mentioned
as a factor because of a lawsuit by
the parents of Robert Yuen, a stu
dent who died on a Senior Class
trip. It turns out that the parents
were suing the University and the
Alumni Association, but not the
Senior Class.
Instead of checking the facts,
and realizing there were no large
liability problems with the Senior
Class, the senate voted to write
the class out of the bylaws, leaving
the class on its own.
Another fact the senate forgot
to remember: The insurance policy
already in effect, which assumes
the Senior Class as a part of the
ASSU coverage, runs through
March 1990.
When September rolled around,
the Senior Class Presidents learned
the class was not part of the ASSU
any longer, and they scurried to
make the class a "voluntary" stu
dent organization covered by the
University's $1 million self
insurance program.
As it stands, the Senior Class is
covered by the University's pro
gram, and the ASSU is paying for
an insurance policy that includes
the class in its coverage.
The problem can be easily solved
by the body that blew the play in
the first place: the ASSU Senate.
The class can become part of the
ASSU again with no additional in
surance cost, since the premium
already includes the class. Even
beyond March, the ASSU insur
ance broker has estimated that the
premium will not drop much if the
Senior Class is not included.
In the next few months, ASSU
financial manager Sandra Leal will
be seeking new estimates for next
year's insurance plan. That plan
should include the Senior Class
with no special mention of their
case.
