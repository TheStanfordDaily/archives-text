# ASSU personnel shortage delays funding for student groups

Board, which is responsible for reviewing
and granting requests for funding from
most student groups, has the most acute
personnel shortage.
Although the Program Board chair was
chosen last year, the remaining seats on
the six-member board have not been
filled.
Because the board has been unable to
convene, student groups wanting ASSU
funding cannot get it.
According to Talbot, the Nominations
Commission hopes to have these positions
filled by Friday so the requests for fund
ing can be approved.
Positions are also vacant on the Pub
lications Board, which controls funding
for the small student publications on
campus and allocates office space on
campus for these publications.
In addition, students are needed to

With 66 vacancies remaining, the
ASSU Nominations Commission is
having problems filling student positions
on University and ASSU committees, a
situation that has delayed funding for
student groups.
The openings are divided among official
University committees and three ASSU
committees: the Program Board, the Pub
lications Board and the Senate Associates.
Although some positions are usually
unfilled at the beginning of fall quarter,
the number of unfilled positions is un
usually high this year, according to Cecil
Talbot, the commission chair. The
Nominations Commission is responsible
for selecting the students to serve on
these committees.

work as Senate Associates, assisting the
ASSU Senate in a variety of ways.
University committees, which are com
posed of students and faculty, set Uni
versity policy on a variety of issues
ranging from the undergraduate curric
ulum to athletics.
Among the many positions to be filled
are seats on the Undergraduate and Res
idential Affairs Committee, the Subcom
mittee on Evaluation and Improvement
of Teaching, the Graduate Studies Com-

mittee, and the Subcommittee on Resi
dential Education.
The Nominations Commission has
made applications available for all of the
vacant positions. Applications can be
found in room 205 of the ASSU office
and are due Friday.
Talbot said he hopes all of the positions
will be filled by the end of the quarter.
Talbot said this year's problems oc
curred primarily because the commission
cot a late start. "This year's Nominations

Commission was not picked until last
May," he said, noting that normally, the
commission is chosen by the end of Winter
Quarter.
The Nominations Commission, consist
ing of Talbot and four other students,
interviews applicants for committee po
sitions and then makes recommendations
for the positions to the full ASSU Senate,
which votes on the recommendations. As
a general rule, the senate follows the
commission's recommendations.
Talbot cited a lack of interest among
the students as another reason for the
large number of vacant positions. He said
some students may not be interested be
cause some of the committees do not
meet as frequently as students would like.
While some committees meet once a
week, others meet only two or three times
a quarter.
