## Protecting potential lives 
### 
I HAVE SEEN the light.
When the Supreme Court made the
Webster decision this summer, limit
ing the availability of abortion, anti
abortion groups were everywhere,
crowing about their victory. And with all
the extra exposure these groups received,
they have convinced me.
Those Operation Rescue-type groups
that I used to categorize as depraved
thugs are actually completely right. Fer
tilized eggs are people too!
It doesn't matter that said eggs are
undeveloped and nonviable. That is
merely science and is completely irrele
vant to me and my .Operation Rescue
cronies. We believe that a fertilized egg
represents the potential ability to become
a fetus and that potential must be
protected.
After all, is a woman's right to choose
what she wants to do with her own body
really that important? It's not as if a
woman would have tha< mental or emo
tional capacities to make such a decision
anyway. (Operation Rescue has also
helped me realize the inferiority of the
female sex.)
So I now wholeheartedly support Op
eration Rescue and its goals and I plan
to join in their next riot, I mean, rally
outside of a legal abortion clinic. And
hopefully I'll have the opportunity to
modestly propose what I feel the group's
next mission of mercy should be.
You see, I've realized that eliminating
abortion is only the first step. If Oper
ation Rescue is seriously committed to
protecting potential lives, they must
bravely forge ahead. Outlawing abortion

is only the beginning — the next move
for our heroic group should be the
prohibition of menstruation.
Sound silly to you? If so, you must be
a Communist atheist who probably works
as a butcher in these child-killing fac
tories. Banning the monthly mass mur
ders of eggs by women across the country
is completely consistent with the Opera
tion Rescue philosophy — anything that
has the potential to develop into a fetus
must be protected at all costs. Millions
of eggs are being denied the chance to
become fertilized every day, a slaughter
of unbelievable proportions.
Does it matter that these eggs are only
half-people, unable to become a fully de
veloped fetus on their own? Of course
not. An unfertilized egg has the potential
to become a fetus just as a fertilized egg
does.
Neither can develop outside the womb,
but both, with proper care and enough
time, can become fetuses. The body itself
knows that menstruation is morally
wrong and produces pre-menstrual
syndrome, bloating and cramps as pun
ishment for women who allow it to con
tinue.
Obviously, someone is desperately
needed to speak out for these poor little
eggs, these demi-persons who make ar
dorous monthly journeys from the ovaries
to the uterus, only to be brutally expelled
from their happy homes into the harsh
world.
I think Operation Rescue is that group
and therefore I propose to them organ
ized protests at stores across the nation,
where supporters will sit with locked

morally wrong, and

menstrual syndrome,

punishment for women.

arms in front of feminine hygiene display!
and scream insults at any woman who
feels that she needs to purchase some
murderous maxi-pads. This 28-day cycle
of violence and bloodshed must stop!
This approach may seem a little unfair
to women because men's reproductive
fluids will be able to flow without fear.-
The explanation for this double standard
is simple.
Our beloved Operation Rescue leader,
Randy Terry, in his infinite wisdom will
never advocate any restriction that could
actually have a direct effect on himself/
God bless him.
