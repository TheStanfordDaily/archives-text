## Columnist uses bad analogies to support views 
### 
I AM WRITING in response to
Cheryl Taylor's column entitled
"Blacks get a bad message" (Oct.
9). I must begin by stating that I fully
believe in the ideals of complete
equality for which African-Americans
and other minority groups are striving.
I do, however, find it difficult to un
derstand the analogies and arguments
she chooses to support her views.
Her comparison of a race-related
murder in Bensonhurst to the plight of
Louis Jackson at Stanford was shock
ing. Attempting to link the victim of a
heinous crime to one who is accused of

a less severe crime is stretching an
analogy indeed, and only serves to
diminish the atrocity of the former
while sensationalizing the latter.
Perhaps a link between the two
incidents can be observed that unveils
a different truth: How would Taylor
react if the charges against those
accused in the Bensonhurst murder
were dropped because the prosecution
was uncertain that everyone involved
in the incident was brought to justice?
I myself would consider that an outra
geous act of injustice.
Taylor goes on to mention that her

financial aid has been cut by almost 70
percent over the span of four years at
Stanford, and that this has contributed
to her general feeling of unwelcome.
In the context of her column, this
implies that she has been treated
unfairly because of her minority status
and hints at racist influences in the
setting of financial support levels by
the University.
I, for one, would be quite interested
in a more complete disclosure of the
facts behind this statement, and per
haps one of her future columns could
address this issue in full. If the impli-

cation was not intended, then perhaps
the statement should not have been
used to support her hypothesis.
Finally, while I realize that Cheryl
Taylor feels an obligation to return a
gift to the African-American communi
ty, I hope that she and others, in the
spirit of forming a truly pluralistic
community, will choose to share their
gifts with everyone. For I believe that
in order for a society to achieve the
multicultural ideal, such an atmosphere
of unconditional sharing is fundamen
tal.
