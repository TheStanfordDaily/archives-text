# BSU fully supports Jackson and asks University to help
## 
### 
Tomorrow morning, Louis
Jackson will appear in Santa
Clara County court facing
charges stemming from the May 15
takeover. He may receive a sentence of
two years in prison and a fine.
We, the Black Student Union, ask
University President Donald Kennedy,
do you feel that Jackson is a felon?
President Kennedy may reply that
Jackson is not a felon or a criminal.
He simply chose to participate in a
law-breaking action and must face the
punishment. Others would add that the
protesters of the 1960s went to jail and
didn't complain.
Yes, that is true. We don't deny that
many protesters of that time went
willingly to jail for their causes. How
ever, the bottom line is this: today is
1989, not 1969. It is unreasonable to
expect someone to accept the same
treatment or to make the same
sacrifices as the activists of twenty

years ago.
It is Kennedy's lack of action, or
rather, choice of inaction which the
BSU finds most disturbing.
Over the years our roller coaster
relationship with the president has had
its moments. Through it all, he has
recognized those moments when our
cause was right and he stood by us.
In 1985 he took action on behalf of
Robby Perkins, a black student ar
rested for his involvement in a protest
to pressure the University to divest
from South Africa. What has stopped
him now?
Jackson alone is facing criminal
charges for actions on May 15. Ken
nedy knows, the press knows and the
police videotapes know that Jackson
was not the only participant of the
takeover nor was he a principal organ
izer.
Perhaps the administration is sin
gling Jackson out to deter any future
students from action. Perhaps not.
Regardless of the reason, we find the
University's actions in Jackson's case
unethical and morally questionable.
Kennedy has, in essence, washed his
hands of Jackson and delivered him to
the district attorney.
We truly believe that Kennedy knows

Jackson is innocent. We sincerely hope
that after tomorrow Kennedy can come
to terms with himself and still look the
BSU in the eye with a clear con
science.
