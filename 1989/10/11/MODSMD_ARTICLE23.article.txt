# Both Manley and Campbell resort to low-down tactics
## 
### 
The insinuation of Prof. John Man
ley's recent Viewpoint (Oct. 6) is
matched in scale only by the low blows
and preposterousness of the remarks of
former Hoover Institution director W.
Glenn Campbell in The Stanford
Review.
Manley brings up irrevelant facts,
such as the size of Hoover's $12.5 mil
lion endowment, in an apparent at
tempt to insinuate that the entire
proceeds are used to bribe Stanford
into putting up with Hoover.
Perhaps Manley's most egregious
intimation is that Hoover should be
changed because its "mission ... of

policy, research and advocacy" will
"necessarily conflict" with Stanford's
mission of "education."
Manley lectured my Western Culture
class last year, and all of the lecture's
points of interest and education were
incidental to Manley's stated purpose of
encouraging receptiveness toward the
radical left-wing ideas he advocates.
Campbell, on the other hand, es
chews insinuation in favor of out-and
out mudslinging, accusing his critics of
"trying to get a little local publicity"
and of being "obviously jealous." He
also, unbelievably, claimed not to have
a political agenda, stating, "Hoover
doesn't lean to the right."
When a person sinks to insinuations
or insults, refuses to admit that his
viewpoint is not absolute truth or uses
a lecture as a propaganda opportunity,
it does more than hinder my efforts to
become educated.
It tells me that the person is afraid
that his viewpoint cannot compete with
other ideas on its own merits. What
Manley and Campbell are really drag
ging through the mud is their own
credibility.
