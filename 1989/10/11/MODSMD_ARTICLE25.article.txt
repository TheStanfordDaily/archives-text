## MEChA supports Jackson fully and calls for University's help 
### 
STANFORD MEChA has a long
tradition of fighting for justice
and equality for all people. On
May 15, many of us participated in the
takeover of the President's office in an
effort to show the administration our
frustration with the processes we had
to work through in our efforts to
better our education as well as that of
all Stanford students.
Despite the progressive changes that
were achieved by the Agenda for Ac
tion, we find that one of our brothers
in struggle, Louis Jackson, continues to

be singled out by the legal system and
has received no support from the
University administration.
On Oct. 4, 53 of us were sentenced
by the legal system with 40 hours of
community service and six months
probation on a trespassing charge. We
have accepted our punishment with the
understanding that we acted collec
tively and should be treated equally
under the law.
However, Jackson has not received
equal punishment under the law and
faces a maximum penalty in excess of

two years in jail on six charges, includ
ing trespassing, inciting to riot and
battery.
However, there was no riot, he was
not trespassing on his own campus
and the woman he allegedly battered
has said that she at no time felt
threatened and has not pressed any
charges.
MEChA calls on Stanford to take an
active stand in support of Jackson and
to fight the tides of racism. We espe
cially call on University President
Donald Kennedy to once again come

forward in defense of a student that is
being unjustly treated by the legal
system as he did in 1985 when Robby
Perkins, a black student, was allegedly
strip-searched and beaten by police
after his involvement in an anti
apartheid sit-in in Old Union.
When Jackson goes to court on Oct.
12, we will all be with him because we
know that, historically, the denial of
African-Americans is a harbinger of
the undermining of the rights of all
people.
When African-Americans speak out

against the injustices of our society
and struggle for equal rights, we are
all empowered to join in the struggle
and raise our voices against inequality
We know the University shares our
sentiments to struggle for justice and
equality and will actively support
Jackson as we do LA UNION HACE
LA FUERZA!
