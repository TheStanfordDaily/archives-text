# Jackson should let the facts decide in the courtroom
## 
### 
There is currently much debate
about the situation involving Louis
Jackson and the charges he is facing. I
think that there are two issues in this
case which need to be looked at sepa
rately.
One issue is whether Jackson should
have been charged as he was. There
are two camps on the issue. The first
says that he committed the crime, and

thus the charges should stand. The
second argues that, because he was the
only one singled out and is black, the
charges are racist in nature and should
be dropped. The issue is more complex
than either position suggests.
Firstly, it is illegal to selectively en
force the law; there are cases in which
charges have been dropped because of
selective enforcement regardless of the
accused's innocence or guilt. The bare
fact that Jackson committed the crime
does not necessarily imply that the
charges should stand.
Secondly, simply because he was the
only one singled out and is black does
not prove that there was racism in
volved; it only suggests that that might

be the case. Jackson may have been
the only person against whom the
police had sufficient evidence to book a
case. It is up to the courts to examine
the specifics of this case to determine
whether the laws were selectively en
forced.
A second issue, completely separate
from the legal questions involved, is
whether Stanford should intervene.
Stanford has a standing policy of non
interference with the legal system on a
student's behalf.
This is meant to encourage students
to make mature judgments for which
they will be held accountable. I cannot
see how the policy could not apply in
this incident.

Before and during the rally, Jackson
knew full well of Stanford's policy. It
was his choice as to what extent he
would participate in the rally, including
each of the acts for which he is being
charged. Whether he is guilty or inno
cent has nothing to do with his rela
tionship to Stanford University.
