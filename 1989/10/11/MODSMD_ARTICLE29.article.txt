No press conferences, please
In a story about cold fusion that ran in last
week's science section, Materials Sciences Prof.
Robert Huggins said he hopes to have interesting
results from his experiments in the next few
weeks.
At least a couple of journalists called up The
Stanford Daily to ask when the press conference
will be held. Although last year Huggins an
nounced his big cold fusion results in a press
conference, he learned a valuable lesson and prob
ably will not do that again.
This time, Huggins says, the results will be
announced in One of the more traditional ways
for scientists: by publishing the results in a jour
nal or announcing them at a scientific conference.
Since cold fusion was introduced in March, a
supposedly mythical process for creating energy
producing fusion at room temperatures, several
researchers announced their results at press con
ferences. The original cold fusion announcement,
by researchers at the University of Utah has
been all but discredited, mostly because their
work was not properly subjected to scientific cri
tique before it was announced to a host of eager
newspaper reporters and broadcast journalists.
Minority biomedical program
The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious
Diseases is looking for talented minority students
in their junior or senior years or their first year
in graduate or medical school to participate in a
biomedical research program.
The institute, which is part of the National
Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Md., is spon
soring the program to acquaint academically

talented minority students with career opportu
nities in the broad field of biomedical research.
"This initiative grew out of the Institute's
concern about the underrepresentation of minor
ities in the scientific pool," said Vincent Thomas,
project officer of the intense program.
Students — //ho are provided with accommo
dations and round-trip tickets to the Bethesda
campus — will have the opportunity to participate
in a series of lectures, interviews and tour the
NIH Clinical Center, the world's largest biomedi
cal research facility.
Approximately 55 students will be selected for
the Feb. 11-16 program. The applications, which
can be obtained through the biology or chemistry
departments, are due Nov. 20.
President's Cancer Panel meets here
With the number of times that growths have
been removed from Presidents of the United
States in recent years, you might think the Pres
ident would have his own cancer panel.
He does, and it will be meeting Friday at
Stanford. The half-day meeting of the President's
Cancer Panel in Sherman Fairchild Auditorium
will focus on technology transfer.
At the end of the year, Arm&nd Hammer, the
panel chair, will go to the White House and
personally deliver the report to President George
Bush.
Participating in the meeting will be Samuel
Broder, director of the National Cancer Institute,
and David Korn, dean of the School of Medicine.
Also speaking will be Medicine Prof. Ronald Levy,
Cancer Biology Prof. Errol Friedberg and Niels
Reimers, director of technology licensing at Stan
ford.
