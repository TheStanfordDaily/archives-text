# Budget cut threatens gay center
## 
### Ed Palattella 
Facing funding cuts, the one
year-old Lesbian, Gay and Bisex
ual Community Center will have
a hard time establishing itself on
campus this year, its officers said.
University officials said the
cuts, like the budget constraints
for every other campus commu
nity center this year, are the result
of the University's overall deficit
and would not necessarily con
tinue in the future. The officials
said they will continue to help the
center create an organizational
base and expand its programs.
The budget climate created by
the University deficit "has af
fected all groups. But we are not
going to let the [center] become
a starveling child," said Michael
Ramsey-Perez, director of Student
Organization Services.
Community center officers said
the center's future would be hin
dered by the cuts.
"The funding is substantially
less than last year's," said Paul
Baer, one of the center's five of

ficers. "Our plan was that over
the first few years we would es
tablish ourselves, that things
would increase."
The center was founded last
September as an administrative
umbrella for the many gay, les
bian and bisexual groups on
campus, including the Gay and
Lesbian Alliance at Stanford and
the Stanford Organization for
Lesbian and Gay Equality.
Located on the second floor of
the Fire Truck House, the center
is considered a department of Stu
dent Affairs and receives Univer
sity funding, staff time, equip
ment, office space and support
from the Office of the Dean of
Student Affairs.
Ted Hardie, a former commu
nity center officer who last year
worked with the University to
create the center, called the 1989-
90 funding cuts "maddening."
Like the present officers,
Hardie said he thought the Uni
versity would increase the center's
funding for at least the first three
years of its existence. The cuts,

Hardie said, "were never dis
cussed."
Even though the University has
deficit problems, the center, be
cause of its newness, needs to be
treated differently when it comes
to funding, Hardie said.
"The issue here isn't tightening
the belt on a suit that has been
already made," he said, "but rip
ping apart the seams of a suit
that is in progress."
The center's officers weren't
sure which of the center's pro
grams would be most affected by
the funding decreases, but said
they knew the center would un
dertake less than it had initially
planned.
For example, the GALA Week
reception, held last May, cost
$500, Baer said. The center would
like to hold the event this year,
he said, but the limited budget
would pose problems.
One large event, he said, might
mean fewer smaller ones — a sit
uation that could result in less
publicity for the center.
"The nature of the center makes
publicity an important part" of
the budget, Baer said.
According to budget records,
the center last year received
$10,500 from the University, with
$5,000 alotted for salaries, $1,500
for start-up funds and $4,000 for
expendable materials and sup
plies.
This year records show the Uni
versity allocated $9,056 for the
center — $7,556 for salaries and
$1,500 for materials and supplies.

The center's proposed 1989-90
budget was $14,925, records said.
The operating budgets of the
five other community centers —
the Asian American Activities
Center, the Black Community
Services Center, El Centro
Chicano, the Women's Center and
the Native American Activities
Center — were frozen this year,
according to Michael Jackson, as
sociate dean of student affairs.
Jackson said the center used
last year's start-up funds to ac
quire a computer hard disk, to
make a sign and to buy and make
any other materials needed to es
tablish the center.
This year's budget will continue
to cover "baseline" costs needed

to operate the center, he said.
"When we began developing the
[center], the view was that we
would provide funds for the initial
start-up," Jackson said. "I said
we would hope to establish a
baseline."
"We will help the center to con
tinue to define itself," he said.
Ramsey-Perez called 1989-90 a
"clarifying year" for the center
and said its funding would change
next year once its priorities were
defined.
"Nothing is set in terms of
funding," Ramsey-Perez said.
"There are ways to maximize the
situation." If the need arises, the
center could get funds from other
departments, he said.

$500, Baer said. The center would
like to hold the event this year,
he said, but the limited budget
would pose problems.
One large event, he said, might
mean fewer smaller ones — a sit
uation that could result in less
publicity for the center.
"The nature of the center makes
publicity an important part" of
the budget, Baer said.
According to budget records,
the center last year received
$10,500 from the University, with
$5,000 alotted for salaries, $1,500
for start-up funds and $4,000 for
expendable materials and sup
plies.
This year records show the Uni
versity allocated $9,056 for the
center — $7,556 for salaries and
$1,500 for materials and supplies.

The center's proposed 1989-90
budget was $14,925, records said.
The operating budgets of the
five other community centers —
the Asian American Activities
Center, the Black Community
Services Center, El Centro
Chicano, the Women's Center and
the Native American Activities
Center — were frozen this year,
according to Michael Jackson, as
sociate dean of student affairs.
Jackson said the center used
last year's start-up funds to ac
quire a computer hard disk, to
make a sign and to buy and make
any other materials needed to es
tablish the center.
This year's budget will continue
to cover "baseline" costs needed

to operate the center, he said.
"When we began developing the
[center], the view was that we
would provide funds for the initial
start-up," Jackson said. "I said
we would hope to establish a
baseline."
"We will help the center to con
tinue to define itself," he said.
Ramsey-Perez called 1989-90 a
"clarifying year" for the center
and said its funding would change
next year once its priorities were
defined.
"Nothing is set in terms of
funding," Ramsey-Perez said.
"There are ways to maximize the
situation." If the need arises, the
center could get funds from other
departments, he said.
Facing funding cuts, the one
year-old Lesbian, Gay and Bisex
ual Community Center will have
a hard time establishing itself on
campus this year, its officers said.
University officials said the
cuts, like the budget constraints
for every other campus commu
nity center this year, are the result
of the University's overall deficit
and would not necessarily con
tinue in the future. The officials
said they will continue to help the
center create an organizational
base and expand its programs.
The budget climate created by
the University deficit "has af
fected all groups. But we are not
going to let the [center] become
a starveling child," said Michael
Ramsey-Perez, director of Student
Organization Services.
Community center officers said
the center's future would be hin
dered by the cuts.
"The funding is substantially
less than last year's," said Paul
Baer, one of the center's five of

ficers. "Our plan was that over
the first few years we would es
tablish ourselves, that things
would increase."
The center was founded last
September as an administrative
umbrella for the many gay, les
bian and bisexual groups on
campus, including the Gay and
Lesbian Alliance at Stanford and
the Stanford Organization for
Lesbian and Gay Equality.
Located on the second floor of
the Fire Truck House, the center
is considered a department of Stu
dent Affairs and receives Univer
sity funding, staff time, equip
ment, office space and support
from the Office of the Dean of
Student Affairs.
Ted Hardie, a former commu
nity center officer who last year
worked with the University to
create the center, called the 1989-
90 funding cuts "maddening."
Like the present officers,
Hardie said he thought the Uni
versity would increase the center's
funding for at least the first three
years of its existence. The cuts,

Hardie said, "were never dis
cussed."
Even though the University has
deficit problems, the center, be
cause of its newness, needs to be
treated differently when it comes
to funding, Hardie said.
"The issue here isn't tightening
the belt on a suit that has been
already made," he said, "but rip
ping apart the seams of a suit
that is in progress."
The center's officers weren't
sure which of the center's pro
grams would be most affected by
the funding decreases, but said
they knew the center would un
dertake less than it had initially
planned.
For example, the GALA Week
reception, held last May, cost
$500, Baer said. The center would
like to hold the event this year,
he said, but the limited budget
would pose problems.
One large event, he said, might
mean fewer smaller ones — a sit
uation that could result in less
publicity for the center.
