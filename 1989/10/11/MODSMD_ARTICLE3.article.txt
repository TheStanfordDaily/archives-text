# Budget cut threatens gay center

Facing funding cuts, the one
year-old Lesbian, Gay and Bisex
ual Community Center will have
a hard time establishing itself on
campus this year, its officers said.
University officials said the
cuts, like the budget constraints
for every other campus commu
nity center this year, are the result
of the University's overall deficit
and would not necessarily con
tinue in the future. The officials
said they will continue to help the
center create an organizational
base and expand its programs.
The budget climate created by
the University deficit "has af
fected all groups. But we are not
going to let the [center] become
a starveling child," said Michael
Ramsey-Perez, director of Student
Organization Services.
Community center officers said
the center's future would be hin
dered by the cuts.
"The funding is substantially
less than last year's," said Paul
Baer, one of the center's five of

ficers. "Our plan was that over
the first few years we would es
tablish ourselves, that things
would increase."
The center was founded last
September as an administrative
umbrella for the many gay, les
bian and bisexual groups on
campus, including the Gay and
Lesbian Alliance at Stanford and
the Stanford Organization for
Lesbian and Gay Equality.
Located on the second floor of
the Fire Truck House, the center
is considered a department of Stu
dent Affairs and receives Univer
sity funding, staff time, equip
ment, office space and support
from the Office of the Dean of
Student Affairs.
Ted Hardie, a former commu
nity center officer who last year
worked with the University to
create the center, called the 1989-
90 funding cuts "maddening."
Like the present officers,
Hardie said he thought the Uni
versity would increase the center's
funding for at least the first three
years of its existence. The cuts,

Hardie said, "were never dis
cussed."
Even though the University has
deficit problems, the center, be
cause of its newness, needs to be
treated differently when it comes
to funding, Hardie said.
"The issue here isn't tightening
the belt on a suit that has been
already made," he said, "but rip
ping apart the seams of a suit
that is in progress."
The center's officers weren't
sure which of the center's pro
grams would be most affected by
the funding decreases, but said
they knew the center would un
dertake less than it had initially
planned.
For example, the GALA Week
reception, held last May, cost
$500, Baer said. The center would
like to hold the event this year,
he said, but the limited budget
would pose problems.
One large event, he said, might
mean fewer smaller ones â€” a sit
uation that could result in less
