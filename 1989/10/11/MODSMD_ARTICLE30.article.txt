# Scientist's scanning technique might help identify oil reserves

A Stanford scientist is develop
ing a new technique to better map
the underground, which might
identify vast reservoirs of un
tapped oil and natural gas.
The new technique, developed
by Geophysics Assoc. Prof. Jerry
Harris, will use an imaging tech
nique comparable to a medical
CAT scan to produce images of
higher resolution of underground
features.
The technique of mapping the
underground with seismic waves
is not new. For years, seismic
waves have been used to detect
the many different features deep
beneath the ground.
"The value of this new applica
tion is that we have taken tech
nology off the shelf and put it to
use," Harris said of his new map
ping program.
To use the technology, scientists
emit a wave toward a receiver.
The different features of the sub
terranean world may weaken the
wave's force or change its
wavelength or frequency.
The way this data is handled
and collected is what Harris' ap
plication is trying to improve. A
new computer program Harris is
developing will be sensitive to
these characteristics of the higher
frequency seismic waves. Even

though high frequency seismic
waves have been used to map the
underground, never before have
scientists had such a data collec
tion program.
The improvements in the data
collection will give scientists a
more detailed view of the Earth's
outer crust, which could be put
to great use by the petroleum and
natural gas industries. Currently
only about one-fourth of the oil
in existing oil fields is being ex
tracted, oil experts estimate.
The effects of this improved
mapping technology could be felt
by consumer and producer as it
may successfully be used to im
prove the output of current oil
fields.
Further, Harris said the new
application could be used to direct
and control more accurately the
flow of steam — which is used to
help remove the petroleum —
toward the crude oil and provide
more clues about the nature of
the oil fields.
Because the exploration of a
new field is a greater expense to
the oil industry than further ex
traction from an existing field,
the new application could trans
late into more effective crude
removal from already discovered
oil fields.
Harris, who has been working

on this project at Stanford for one
year, said he hopes the new ap
plication will eventually become
versatile enough to help choose
the safest sites for underground
nuclear waste disposal or help
geophysicists learn more about
subterranean hydrological
features.
The first practical experiment,
which will test the effectiveness
of Harris' new CAT scan applica
tion, has already been run. The
new program was tested to detect
rifts, steam and water currents,
faults and other such under
ground features in an oil field in
South Texas.
"The response that I have
sensed is basically positive," said
Harris, but he was hesitant to
declare the application a complete
success. "We are experimen
talists," commented Harris, insist
ing that it was necessary to wait
until the results of this experi
ment were processed to determine
its real value.
Right now the CAT scan pro
gram has the ability to map fea
tures with widths of less than 10
meters from about 250 to 300
meters, but Harris aims to adjust
the system so it can identify fea
tures of meters in length at a
distance of kilometers.
