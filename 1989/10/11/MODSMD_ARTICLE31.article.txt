# High-stakes font wars have erupted in computer industry
## 
### Mark Rogowsky Senior staff writer 
Editor's note: This is the first in
a two-part series on the so-called
Font Wars that are shaking up
the computer industry. Part Two
will appear next week.

Three weeks ago at the Seybold
Electronic Publishing Conference
in San Francisco a bizarre soap
opera made its dramatic debut,
and it wasn't the latest "Dallas"
or "Dynasty."
Instead, it's a real-life, high
stakes game amongst some of the
titans of the computer industry
that has been dubbed the Font
Wars. At issue is one of the most
fundamental computer technolo-

gies; the displaying
and printing of type.
A little history
should prove illumi
nating. In the mid
-1970s when the per
sonal computer
came into being,
fonts (the various
typefaces such as
Helvetica, Times

and Century Schoolbook — which,
incidentally, is The Daily's font)
weren't an issue.
Screen displays, even when they
included graphics, always used
the same type style. It was blocky,
and usually ugly, but it allowed
the user to see what was going
on. Printers produced type in
either a low-quality dot pattern

or in a typeface that
matched the stand
ard IBM typewriter
(today, that typeface
is called Courier).
With the advent
of the Apple Macin
tosh, and more im
portantly the
LaserWriter, every
thing changed. In-

stead of printing everything in
Courier, now you could print in
Palatino, Zapf Chancery or any
of the thousands of typefaces that
previously were only available to
typesetting professionals. , _
As more people began to work
with these tools, the term desktop
publishing was invented to
describe the production of near

typeset., quality documents on a
personal computer and laser
printer.
From the start, though, there
was a problem. The technology
used to render the fonts on the
screen was — and is — different
from the technology used to print
the fonts on paper. The result is
the representation on the display
fails to match the output. In com
puter parlance, it's not WYSIWYG

(what you see is what you get).
In addition, most printers used
in desktop publishing are based
on a special language called
Postscript and owned by Adobe
Inc. Postscript describes fonts as
mathematical formulas for gener
ating the outlines of letters. The
alternative to storing outlines is
to store bit maps which are grids
that specify which dots should be
on and which should be off to

form a particular shape.
The only computer tnat uses
Postscript to display fonts on
screen is the NeXT which has an
installed base of less than 1,000.
The Macintosh displays screen
fonts using Quickdraw, an Apple
technology that is as old as the
original Macintosh.
Postscript can automatically
generate good-looking type in sizes
as small as the print you are
reading and as large as several
inches high — from one set of
outlines. Quickdraw, on the other
hand, needs a bit map for each
font size in order to eliminate the
jagged, stair-step look that you
often see produced on an Apple
Image writer.
The battle being fought today
between Adobe, Apple, Microsoft,
NeXT and IBM is over who will
determine how these two irrecon
cilable technologies are merged
into one uniform method of print
ing and displaying type.



When a computer tries to create a bit-map font in a larger size
than is available, the results are often unpleasant. Outline fonts,
on the other hand, can be accurately rendered in any size.
