# Light scattering causes dazzling, rosy sunsets

is the sun red at sunset?
A. Explaining why the setting sun is
• red requires first answering the age
old question of why the sky is blue.
Despite all the hype this question gets,
it isn't really one of the eternal puzzles
of the universe. The "blue-sky phenom
enon" is actually pretty simple to under
stand.
Usually the sun looks white. This is
because the rainbow of colors emitted by
the sun are mixed together and our eyes
can't separate them. But not all the light
we see comes straight from the sun. Some
gets scattered around first by the air and
dust particles that make up the atmos
phere.
Not all light scatters equally. Just as
a speeding tennis ball hit by Stanford's

By sunset, so much of the
sun's blue light is scattered
away that it looks red.

Sandra Birch would bounce farther than
one I tried to hit, light with higher energy
scatters more than does light with lower
energy. Since frequency is proportional
to energy, so too does higher frequency
light scatter better than lower frequency
light. Of visible light, blue light has the
highest frequency and red the lowest.
The difference in frequency isn't that
big — blue light has a frequency less
than twice that of red light — but because
of the way light scatters, this variation
makes a big difference. According to
Physics Prof. Douglas Osheroff, blue light

scatters almost 10 times more efficiently
than red.
The scattered blue light bounces
around in the atmosphere, and some
eventually makes it to earth. This is the
blue sky you see on a clear day.
Usually sunlight doesn't go through
very much air. Only the 20 miles of at
mosphere nearest earth have enough air
to do much scattering, Osheroff says.
This is enough to make the sky blue, but
it doesn't make a significant difference
in the sun's appearance.
However, when the sun drops to the
horizon, the light comes through the at
mosphere at an angle and travels through
the air for a much longer distance. The
light hits more particles and more of the
blue light is scattered.
By sunset so much of the blue light is
scattered away that the sun looks red.
The same thing can happen at other times
of day if the air is full of smoke or smog.
