## Card sails to second Stanford trails USC in opening regatta 
### Sarah S. Gannett 
After only one week of practice, the Stan
ford sailing team showed its depth at the
Stoney Burke Regatta at California last
weekend as six of the nine Stanford boats
competing placed in the top ten.
The Cardinal was led by Dave Dowd and
crew Lydia Snape in the "A" Division and
tri-captain Robert Brown and crew Susan
nah Mapes in the "B" Division. Dowd,
Snape, Brown and Mapes placed second
overall for Stanford, losing only to USC.
USC won the regatta, led by the only
returning Ail-American on the West Coast,
Bob Little and his crew Keith Farrel. Little
and Farrel won seven out of eight races
in their division.
"The last week of practice was really
just organized chaos," said Coach Blake
Middleton. "We didn't even make final cuts
until Thursday before the regatta, whereas
other schools have been sailing for five
weeks. That makes me very confident about
what this team can do in the future. We've
got the talent, and regular practice will
give us the consistency."
Despite their failure to capture first
place, the Stanford team overwhelmed the
regatta with 39 of its 41 members par

ticipating. The Cardinal had nine boats
competing in the races, while the next high
est entry was California's four boats.
While the Dowd-Snape-Brown-Mapes
finish was impressive, the depth of the
Stanford team was apparent in the strong
finishes of its other boats.
The Cardinal racked up first place
finishes in the races with Ted Huang and
crew tri-captain Sue Kown, Lewis Kofsy
and crew Jennifer Yeh, and Matt Sanford
and crew Deborah Claymon all scoring bul
lets. Sanford and Claymon won three
straight races Sunday to capture first place
in their division, teaming up with Brady
Sih and crew tri-captain Matt Dunbar to
score fourth overall.
The Stanford women's team also made
a strong showing with Kim Grose and crew
Robin Powers finishing sixth in their
divison. Other women's finishes included
eleventh and thirteenth places.
The team will be competing this weekend
in the single-handed Pacific Coast Cham
pionships and the Women's Fall Champi
onships at USC. Sailing for the Cardinal
in the single-handeds will be three North
em Champions: A 1 Sargent, Matt Sanford,
and Rick Rosen. Eight Stanford women
will sail in the Fall Championships.
