# New boat donated

Capping off an arduous six
month process, Stanford Direc
tor of Sailing Joe Petrucci has
given the Stanford Sailing As
sociation yet another enormous
boost. Through his efforts, a
1985 Dehler 35-foot racing
sloop named ACE has been
donated to the Association and
will be campaigned in up to
three mid-winter Bay Area
regatta series this year.
The German-made 3/4-ton
sailboat was donated by
Thomas and Brigitta Groh
mann of Tiburon, Calif.
ACE will compete with a
crew made up primarily of
Stanford students. Dave Lyons,
a graduate student in engineer
ing and captain of the 1987
MIT sailing team, and Tom
Dobroth, former commodore of
MlT's sailing program, will
head the campaign.
In the first practice session,
where lack of wind limited the
afternoon crew's maximum
boat speed to 3.5 knots, ACE
exhibited the ability to handle
well in light air. According to
Petrucci, a sister ship of ACE
won both the 1985 and 1986

3/4-Ton World Championships.
However, Petrucci stressed
that unlike the sailing team,
the Association focuses more
on recreation, teaching and the
cultivation of sailing's value "as
a lifetime leisure activity" than
competition.
It is no coincidence that
Stanford's boat donor program
is as old as Petrucci's tenure
as director of sailing at Stan
ford. Over his eight years as
director, he has coordinated
the donation and sale of over
100 boats, ranging in size from
10 to 90 feet. Donated boats
are usually put up for sale im
mediately, but a few, like ACE,
are maintained and used by the
Association for two to three
years.
In addition to ACE, the As
sociation's present fleet in
cludes a Freedom 21, a 40-foot
Swift, two 45-foot Garden
Ketches and the Association's
flagship, a 72-foot Herreshoff.
Boats are maintained with the
help of a volunteer staff and
are assigned a safety officer in
charge of maintenance, repair
and scheduling. All are avail
able to Association members
for use on weekends by reser
vation.
