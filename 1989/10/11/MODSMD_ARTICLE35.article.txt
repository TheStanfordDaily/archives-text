# Spikers falling short of potential

### 
In case you didn't know, the
women's volleyball team was
supposed to win a national
championship this season.
That's not to say anything was
guaranteed, for these things never
are. It's just that considering the
loss of Amy Hayes to graduation
and the addition of the best
recruiting class in the country to
a team that held the No. 2 spot
throughout last season . . .
Great things were expected of
the perennial Final Four squad
that for years came away one or
two victories short of the national
championship (last year, the team
actually needed to win four
matches more than they did).
Someone obviously forgot to tell
the team. The Cardinal (8-5, cur
rently No. 8 in the nation), having
lost only one match to a team
ranked below it in two years en
tering the 1989 campaign, has al
ready dropped four matches to
lower-rated teams this season.
Last weekend, Stanford went toe
to-toe with No. 2 UCLA only to
be pummeled the next night by
No. 6 USC.
In addition to the Women of
Troy, Oregon, UOP and Nebraska
have all headed into matches
against Stanford with a lower rat
ing and left with victories. Not

the stuff that NCAA champions
are made of.
The obvious question is "What
went wrong?" And, as usual, the
obvious answer — that losing set
ter Lara Asper explains the team's
troubles — isn't the right one.
Asper played in six of Stanford's
first eight mstchps. Though Stan
ford went 6-2 during that span,
most of the opponents weren't
among the upper echelon of col
legiate volleyball.
Since her injury, Stanford is 2-3
and looking like something less
than champions in the making.
But the problem isn't with the
setting. Freshman Carrie
Feldman has filled in admirably
for Asper.
The bottom line is that Stan
ford's passing and hitting has been
below par all year, and opponents

are capitalizing. And it doesn't
seem to matter if those opponents
are the mighty Bruins or the daffy
Ducks.
A few statistics will illustrate
the problems with the Stanford
attack. The team is hitting for an
aggregate .204 percentage. Among
the big names swinging less than
impressively: senior Jennifer
Chaffee at .140, sophomore Amy
Cooper at .169, senior Laura
Olesen at .147.
Even First-Team All-American
Kristin Klein has struggled. Hit
ting at a .265 clip a week ago,
Klein moved up to .280 after a
strong weekend. There is hope
that Klein's resurgence will be
come contagious.
If it isn't, look to the waning
moments of USC match as a
harbinger of things to come. In
Game 3, Stanford eventually fell
16-14 with a lineup of Feldman;
freshmen Bev Oden and Kristi
Paaso; and veteran reserves
Nicole Appleman, Tracy Hughes
and Jessica Benton.
Surely, things will turn around
— they could hardly get worse.
But if Stanford is to make noise
they'd better start Old Pavilion
reverberating this weekend. Good
starting points would be a reduc
tion in both serving and receiving

errors.
Oden (with 25 service errorsT 112
Cooper (24) and Olesen (20) are
not nearly as bad from behind
the service line as these stats
would indicate. Similarly, an im
proving in the passing by every
one on the team would go a long
way.
As true Stanford fans, you can
do your share by visiting cozy Old
Pavilion Friday and Saturday
when the Cardinal takes on No.
9 Arizona and Arizona State.
Cheer loudly for Coop, Ole and
Chaffee. They're all really good
players and shouldn't be hitting
for a combined percentage of un
der .150.
Maybe the roar of a sellout
croud rollicking from the rafters
will lift the Cardinal women out
of their funk and put them back
on track.
Things better happen soon,
though, if Stanford hopes to bask
in the Hawaiian sun (the Final
Four will be played there in De
cember).
