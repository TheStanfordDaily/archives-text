ing. The quarterback drops back to pass,
scrambles away from the rush, and des
perately heaves one to the back corner
of the endzone. There is a mad scramble

for the ball and your receiver comes down
with it for the touchdown!
Intramural football leagues started last
week, with some heart-stopping first
round games. In IM football's "Game of
the Week," Lambda Nu's "C" League
team scored with 45 seconds left to beat
Killer Macabees, 19-13. In a classic "B"
league dorm rivalry, the freshmen of
Branner overpowered Flo Mo, 14-6.
In the much-heralded Biz Game, Biz
2A triumphed over Biz 1A in an "A"
League game, 6-0. In the "Let's Prove
the Importance of the Extra Point
Game", Biz lß's "A" League team beat

Sigma Chi, 7-6.
In the double jeopardy category, Roble's
"B" team defeated Yost 12-0 at 2 p.m.on
Sunday and then came back at 3 p.m.
on the same field to beat Yost again in
a co-ed game, 29-0.
The "Idiot of the Week" award goes to
the alumnus who parked his station
wagon between the five yard line and
the goal line on IM Field number two
Friday afternoon, forcing the IM games
to be played around it.
In volleyball action last week, the
blowout award goes to Potter's women's
team, which beat Grove 15-0, 15-1. In

"B" league action, Cedro trounced
Trancos in a Wilbur grudge match, 15-10,
8-15, 15-13, as sophomore hitter Stewart
Coulter led the Cedroids. Toyon handled
Flo Mo easily, 15-3, 15-12. But Flo Mo
no. 2 saved face by pounding Burbank
15-2, 15-6.
In co-ed games. Physics Sucks crushed
Biz 28, 15-2, 15-7. Biz 1A had a difficult
time with Flo Mo, but persevered to win
15-9, 8-15, 15-12.
IM notes
Any team playing on Sunday whose team
number is between 7-12, your games this week

will be played on Saturday at the same time.
Also, in a much-applauded move, the 10 a.m.
Sunday league has been changed to an 11
a.m. Sunday league. The Intramural Office is
cracking down on obligation officiating this
year — if you don't fulfill your obligation,
you will not participate in the playoffs. If you
are unsure of your scheduled obligation times,
call the IM office. The IM office still needs
paid referees, so contact them if interested^
