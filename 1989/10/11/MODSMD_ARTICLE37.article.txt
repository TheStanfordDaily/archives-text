# Field hockey squad silenced by alumnae
## 
### John Louie Staff writer 
Old-timers' games are enjoyable
because of their nostalgic value.
The lineups, comprised of aging
stars of yesteryear, rarely pose a
menacing threat.
But in alumni games, the op
ponents are hardly aged and their
skills are not rusty. And when
returning alumni include team
members from dynasties of the
recent past, the opposing team can
be threatening indeed.
Such was the case for the Stan
ford women's field hockey team,
which fell 1-0 to an alumnae team
Saturday. Facing off against ex
teammates was definitely a chal
lenge for the younger Cardinal.
The 1989 model of the field
hockey team is 1-4-2 on the year
and has not scored a goal since a
Sept. 15 loss to lowa.
"The alumnae team was prob
ably one of the toughest teams
we have faced this season," junior
midfielder Clare Stephens said.
"Our team really didn't approach
the match with total intensity, but
there was still a lot of good hock
ey."
Returning Cardinal alumnae in

cluded three-time All-American
Alison Smith and Northern
Pacific Conference Player of the
Year Karen Jones. Both Smith
and Jones, 1989 graduates, are
currently alternates for the na
tional team.
In addition, Coach Sheryl
Johnson, Olympic medalist and
current co-captain of the national
team, took sides against the cur
rent Stanford squad. "It wasn't
really anything new," Johnson
said, "because I play against the
team a lot in practice."
Johnson was flanked by assis
tant coaches Suzanne Doi and
Andi Wolpert. Doi was a member
of the Cardinal field hockey pro
gram from 1982-85 and was All-
Nor-Pac her senior season. Wol
pert was the Cardinal's co-captain
in 1986 and was a second team
All-American.
Lena Smith scored the solo goal
for the alumnae team.
"All in all," Johnson said, "it
was a good game and good prac
tice."
"It was basically just a fun game
to play," forward Michelle Beynet
added.
The team's next match is Sat
urday at Chico State.
