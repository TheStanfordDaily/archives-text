# Athletes of the Week
## 
### 
While choosing who the Athletes of the
Week are is one of the toughest jobs here
at The Daily, somebody's got to do it. So,
without further ado, this week's winners,
chosen following long deliberation, are Julie
Foudy of the soccer team and Christian
Cevaer of the golf team.
Foudy, a 5-foot-6 freshman midfielder
from Laguna Niguel, Calif., scored two goals
in the Cardinal's 4-1 overtime win against

George Washington Sunday at Maloney
Field. Foudy, who played for the U.S. na
tional team while she was in high school,
is now Stanford's leading scorer with 10
goals and seven assists.
A few minutes into the second half of a
scoreless tie, Stanford fullback Blair Elliott
was tripped in the Colonial penalty box. The
result was a penalty kick, and Foudy took
it, beating the goalkeeper with a shot to the
lower-left corner.
George Washington tied the game with
less than five minutes remaining, however,
and overtime became necessary. Only a min
ute, seven seconds into the extra period,
however, Foudy took a pass from classmate
Kirby Seale and gave the Cardinal a 2-1 lead.
Stanford went on to score two more goals
in the next six minutes and posted a 4-1
win. The Cardinal is now 7-3 on the season
and will return to action Saturday against
U.S. International on Maloney Field at 10
a.m.

Cevaer, a sophomore from Paris, France,
took second in the men's golf team's first
tournament of the year at the Butler Na
tional Invitational Classic in Oak Brook, 111.
Overall, the Cardinal linksters placed
eighth in the 18-team tournament, shooting
a 930.
Cevaer, Stanford's top golfer last year,
opened the tournament with a 71 to take
the first-day lead. He shot a 73 on the

second day and had a one-stroke lead going
into the final day of the 54-hole tournament. â€¢
A final-day 70 by Oklahoma State's Craig ;
Hainline left Cevaer in second, but the tour- ;
nament provided a fine start for Cevaer's
sophomore season.
The men's golf team has returned home
and will host the Fall Invitational at the
Stanford Golf Course beginning Thursday
