# Cardinal defense prepared for high-octane Cougars
## 
### Chris Crader Editorial staff 
Coming off a game against the
No. 1-ranked team in the nation,
the Stanford football team's de
fense is probably ready for a va
cation. Taking a trip to eastern
Washington sounds like a pretty
good idea.
Unfortunately, when the Cardi
nal defenders get there, they will
quickly find themselves on a foot
ball field facing an offense that
is harder to stop than that of
top-ranked Notre Dame.
Stanford will face Washington
State Saturday night at 7:30 p.m.
in Pullman, Wash. The game will
be broadcast live on ESPN with
Mike Patrick doing the play-by
play and former Stanford great
Gene Washington doing the color.
After the loss of Coach Dennis
Erickson, who took the head
coaching position at Miami, and
quarterback Timm Rosenbach,
who turned pro after his junior
season, no one expected Washing
ton State to be much better than
ninth in the Pacific 10 Conference.
Today, however, the Cougars are
5-1, ranked 17th nationally and
averaging over 400 yards per
game of total offense.
"I think you'd have to go a long
way to find anyone who thought
we could duplicate [last year's 9-3

record and an Aloha Bow] win],"
WSU Coach Mike Price said, "ex
cept for the guys down in the
locker room and the new coaches
coming in ... This is where we
planned on being. I know plan
ning isn't the same as doing, but
it starts with your belief first."
The Cougars started the year
by thumping Idaho 44-7 and their
offense hasn't let up yet. They
reached the 40s in both of their
next two games, before being held
to 29 in a win over Wyoming.
Washington State suffered their
only setback in game five, as USC
quarterback Todd Marinovich
drove the Trojans the length of
the field for a touchdown and then
threw for a two-point conversion
with four seconds left in the game.
The final was 18-17.
The Cougars bounced back the
following week, however, to out
gun Oregon 51-38. Senior running
back Steve Broussard had a
career-high 205 yards rushing on
a school-record 41 carries. Mean
while, freshman quarterback
Aaron Garcia completed 18 of 25
passes for 276 yards. Overall,
WSU churned out 503 yards of
offense and held the Ducks to 55
yards on the ground.
Garcia, who began the year as
the starter for the WSU junior
varsity team, became the varsity's
starter when Brad Gossen i injured

his thumb against Oregon State.
"Our quarterback, Aaron Garcia,
is the only quarterback in Wash
ington State, no, make that NCAA
history, who started against Walla
Walla Community College and
then started against USC three
weeks later," Price said with a
smile.
"We have to have ourselves
really ready this week," Cardinal
Coach Denny Green said. "We're
going to have to throw the ball a
lot simply because of who we're
playing and how they commit to
stopping the run."
Stanford may, however, have
the services of Jon Volpe, a 1000-
yard rusher last year who has
missed the last three games due
to a knee injury. Volpe did not
practice today but may be able to
return to the field Saturday. Out
side linebacker Rob Hinckley, who
injured his back against San Jose
State, probably won't play this
weekend, according to Green.
Additionally, free safety Tony
Trousset underwent arthroscopic
knee surgery Monday. Doctors de
termined he tore his anterior
cruciate ligament. If he elects to
have surgery he will be out for
six to 12 months, while if he elects
to pass on surgery, it may or may
not completely heal by itself in a
period of completely indefinite
length.

Washington State will dare wide receiver Jon Pinckney and the rest of the Cardinal offense to equal last
weekend's 68-pass outing.
