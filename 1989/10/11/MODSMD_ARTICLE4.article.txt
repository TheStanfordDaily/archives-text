## Students to aid in search for Asian-American studies professor 
### Brent Bigler Staff writer 
The ASSU Senate unamimously approved the
nominations of two student representatives last
night to the search committee for an Asian-
American studies professor.
Graduate student Ron Nakao and junior Judy
Wu were nominated by the Asian American Students
Association and approved by the senate.
Council of Presidents member Chin-Chin Chen
said "both are very well-qualified candidates" for
the volunteer post.
Four faculty members have also been named to
the committee, including Asst. Dean of Student
Affairs Rick Yuen, the director of the Asian Amer
ican Activities Center.
In another agenda item, the senate retroactively
approved a $39,064.65 loan to the ASSU Typesetting
Service for the purchase of a color copier.
ASSU Financial Manager Sandra Leal released

the loan Aug. 30 without prior senate approval. She
said she approved the loan because doing so by that
date saved the ASSU $7,576.67.
Leal added that her decision was forced because
of the time constraint. "We had to decide then and
there to buy it," she said.
In other business, COP members announced
various service projects on which they are working.
Chen said the COP soon hopes to mitigate long
lines at the Post Office by providing a postage meter
in the ASSU office. She added that she was working
closely with the Post Office in finding other ways
to improve postal service.
COP member Ingrid Nava said she was working
on acquiring a video rental machine that would
allow students to rent movies on campus.
The senate also voted to approve the release of
budgetary reserves to three campus groups: Stan
ford in Government, Stanford Volunteer Network,
and Stanford Students Safe Transportation Program
(STOP). Budgetary reserves are funds left over from
the previous year's budget.
