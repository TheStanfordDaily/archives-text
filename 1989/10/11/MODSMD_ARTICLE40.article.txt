# Senate supports Jackson with COP bill
## 
### Brent Bigler Staff writer 
In a 12-3 vote, the ASSU Senate
last night approved a bill asking
that charges against Louis Jack
son be dropped.
The bill also asked University
President Donald Kennedy "recog
nize the ugly racial overtones of
the charges and intervene to op
pose" the prosecution.
Council of Presidents members
Aimee Allison, David Brown,
Chin-Chin Chen and Ingrid Nava
co-authored the bill.
Presenting an argument before
the senate in favor of Jackson,

BSU member Lyzette Settle char
acterized the charges he faces as
discriminatory and unfair.
"Out of all of the leaders, Louis
is black," she said. "Why did [the
police] single this one person
out?" Settle added.
Jackson is currently facing six
charges: obstructing police justice,
unlawful assembly, inciting to
riot, battery, trespassing, and
refusal to disperse.
But John Schwartz, University
vice president and general counsel,
said the University "think[s] it
would be irresponsible for the
ASSU" to approve the bill.
Schwartz attended the portion of

the senate meeting dealing with
the Jackson bill.
Schwartz said the senate would
disregard the reasons behind the
University's non-interference
policy if they approved the bill.
"Either you apply the policy in
a consistent way, or you don't
have a policy at all," he said.
University policy "is to inform
the police of a known or suspected
crime . .. without attempts at in
tervention in the process (of in
vestigation and prosecution)," he
said.
Jackson, an ASSU senator,
spoke on his own behalf during
the debate, although he excluded

himself from voting.
He said the police singled him
out because he is a recognized
activist. "The Stanford Police
know me by name. Don Kennedy
knows me by name. I don't think
it's any accident that they knew
who I was," he said.
Brown said that "the actual
things [Jackson] did were not
against the law."
Brown added that the COP
drafted the bill because, "The
charges seem like they were un
warranted."
Nava concurred with Brown.
"This bill calls for justice to be
done," she said.
