Hearings were delayed yester
day for four students charged with
resisting arrest in connection with
the May 15 takeover of University
President Donald Kennedy's of
fice.
Pre-trial hearings on the cases
of the four students — David Ad
ler, Hazim Ansari, Matthew Price
and Paul Valdez — have been
postponed until Nov. 1. Hearings
had been scheduled for yesterday
afternoon.
According to Judge Stephen
Manley, the delay was necessary
because the attorneys involved in
the case had not all made general
appearances before the court until

yesterday.
Peter Goldsheider, an attorney
representing three of the students,
said the delay was needed to "get
a hold of all the players," includ
ing the district attorney, who was
not present in court yesterday.
The only charge currently pend
ing against the four students is
resisting arrest. The 53 students
who were sentenced last week
were charged with trespassing.
According to Tony Press, the
attorney representing Price, the
students are facing the charge of
resisting arrest because that
charge carries a greater maximum
penalty than trespassing.
Resisting arrest carries a max
imum penalty of a year in jail,
Press said.
