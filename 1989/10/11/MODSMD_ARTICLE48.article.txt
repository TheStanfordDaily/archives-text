# Catalogs
## 
### 
You will need to learn to use two kinds of catalogs at Stanford —the online catalog and the card
catalog. We presently are in the process of transferring bibliographic records from the card catalog
to the online catalog, so that we can offer full online access to all holdings. As a result, neither is
complete. You sometimes must use both in order to determine if the material you need is at Stanford

Online Catalogs
Socrates and LOIS

Socrates is the name for the SUL online
catalog. Lane Medical Library has its own
online catalog and circulation system, known
as LOIS, in addition to Socrates. The online
catalogs usually are the best place to begin a
search because the most recently purchased
items will be found ONLY in Socrates or LOIS,
and the computer offers ways to search the
catalog that were not possible with the manual
catalog. Use either LOIS or Socrates to find
materials at Lane.
For which libraries will I find records in
Socrates?
• Meyer Library (all items)
• Branner Earth Sciences Library (all items)
• Green Library and the other Branches
(all items acquired since 1973 and some
acquired before 1973)
• Coordinate Libraries (most items acquired
since 1977)
Where can I search Socrates?
Socrates terminals are located in Green,
Meyer, the Branch libraries, Tanner (Philoso
phy Department library), the Hoover Institu
tion, the Robert Crown Law Library, and Lane
Medical Center. LOIS terminals are in the Lane
Medical Center.
Socrates and LOIS can be searched from
outside the libraries using terminals or com
puters connected to the Data Center at Forsythe
Hall such as those in some residence halls.

Faculty, students, and staff may obtain free
accounts that provide 24 hour access to
Socrates. Inquire at library reference desks.
How do I search Socrates?
Socrates is easy to use when you follow
the instructions on the screen. For more
advanced techniques, you can pick up a copy
of "Socrates: A User Guide to the Online
Catalog of the Stanford Libraries" or a two
page "Reference Guide to Socrates" at any
library service desk. To search LOIS, pick up a
copy of "A Reference Guide to LOIS." Socrates
and LOIS workshops are also available. See
INSTRUCTIONAL SUPPORT below.

Card Catalogs
The card catalog lists many holdings of the
Libraries of Stanford; however, cards for mate
rials acquired since 1973 have been pulled from
the union catalog in Green. Records for these
newer materials will be found only in Socrates.
Also, you should be aware that Green
Library's card catalog (located near the en
trance to the East Wing of Green Library across
from Meyer) does NOT contain records for:
• All materials acquired since 1973
• Meyer Library collection (all in Socrates)
• Most holdings of Jonsson Library of
Government Documents
• Holdings of Stanford Linear Accelerator
Library •
• Much of the non-book materials available
at Stanford (printed music, sound recordings,
manuscripts, archives, audiovisual items,

maps, etc.)
• Most holdings of Hoover
Institution Library and
Archives
Check with the appropriate
library to discover how you
can find records for these
materials.
