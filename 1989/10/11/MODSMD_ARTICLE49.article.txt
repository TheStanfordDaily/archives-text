courses like Freshman English, Continuing Education classes and other academic programs. For
several departments on campus such as Music and Slavic studies, reference librarians offer biblio
graphic courses to graduate students. In other departments, librarians teach how to use research
libraries and materials as part of a core graduate class. The subject specialists in any discipline can
work with faculty members to offer research methods instruction tailored to the specific needs of a
course. Contact the specialist in your area for further information.
