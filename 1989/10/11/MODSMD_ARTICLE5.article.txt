# Student not limited by blindness

### Janine De Fao Staff writer 
Editor's note: This is the second
article of a four-part series on
the experiences of disabled
people at Stanford.

In high school, Jannette
Sampson had a reputation for
being "stuck up."
"People would say to me, 'I
said hi to you and and you didn't
say anything back. You didn't
even look at me and smile,' "
she remembers.

But Sampson was not ignor
ing other students on purpose.
She didn't acknowledge them as
they passed because she
couldn't see them. Sampson is
legally blind.
Sampson was born with Star
gart's Disease, an extremely rare
and non-correctable retinal
problem. It causes her to be ex
tremely nearsighted, have poor
depth perception, and have
many blind spots in her vision.
Her condition has gotten
progressively worse and may
continue to do so.
"They tell me that I will never
go completely blind, but it's hard
to say. I could read until my
junior year of high school, but
I can't anymore," Sampson
says.
For a Stanford sophomore,
the inability to read is no small
disability. Sampson says she
feels lucky to be able to use the
resources available at the Dis
ability Resource Center.
"I do all my reading on tape,"
she explains. The taped books
are either ordered from a na

tional agency that does record
ings for the blind or read onto
tape by volunteers at the DRC.
Sampson does not read
braille, but says she probably
will have to learn.
Learning braille "takes an in
tensive six-month program and
I haven't had the time," she
says. But reading and writing

braille are necessary to function
in the business world, Sampson
says.
Braille "makes you a reading
person. You can't fold pages over
on a tape. You could do that
with a braille reader," she adds.

her from campus activities.
with beep tones, but Sampson
says she is not good at it because
she only started using tapes dur
ing her senior year of high school.
"I would give anything to be
able to skim," she says.
Sampson can write papers using
a computer with a large screen,
although she has difficulty be
cause her eyes are very light
sensitve. Her roommates usually
help proofread her work.
Sampson also receives research
help from volunteers and friends
who will locate materials for her
in the libraries.
"People are really helpful when
you get to know them. But they
think you're weird at first. It's
hard to explain to someone why
you don't say hi to them, and if
they don't really know you,
they're afraid to ask," she ex
plains.
To prevent misunderstandings,
Sampson made an announcement
at the first house meeting in
Toyon Hall, where she lives this
year. She explained that she was
legally blind and asked people to
make an effort to introduce them
selves to her more than once.
It was "kind of scary" explain
ing her condition to almost 200
people she hadn't met yet,
Sampson says. "You think people
will be supportive, but you don't
always know."
Although her vision limitations
do not endanger her in any way,
often cause her embarrass
ment, Sampson says. Because she
can't find classrooms, she has to
be walked to class in the begin
ning of the quarter. Sometimes,
she falls down at the bottom of
a flight of stairs because she can't
see the last step.
"I hate bollards with a passion,"
she says. "A lot of times they're

in my blind spot and then they'll
jump out of it and I'll gasp and
jump. I'm sure people think I'm
really strange.
"At times when things like that
happen, I feel really scared or em
barrassed and I hate it. But a
couple hours later I'll tell my
roommates the story and we'll all
just laugh about it," Sampson
says.
In addition to her roommates,
Sampson says she finds great sup
port in the disabled community.
"None of us are willing to com
plain [to non-disabled students]
because you don't want people to
think you hate the world. It's just
not socially acceptable to let cer
tain things make you angry," she
explains.
But within the disabled com
munity there is a special degree
of understanding, Sampson says.
"We'll say, 'You know what hap
pened to me today,' and everyone
will laugh and someone will say,
'I know. The same thing happened
to me yesterday,' " she says.
However, Sampson says she did
not receive support from some
members of the community when
her request for a Draw exemption
was granted last spring.
"Some people with more serious
disabilities didn't have their
(Draw exemption) petitions
granted and it was a difficult sit
uation," she recalls.
Sampson petitioned to live in
Toyon because it was close to
classes, a necessity because she
cannot ride a bike. She also
wanted to live in a triple.
"Heather (her freshman room
mate) did a lot for me. She would
help me read papers, pay bills and
tell me if my sweater matched my
pants. It's a big job and it gets
bigger the more I do. [Heather]
said she'd really like to have a
third person to help her,"
Sampson says.
Her exemption from the Draw

created "more resentment than
ever" from her peers and even
her close friends, she says.
"There were huge amounts of
services I received before and no
one seemed to resent them,"
Sampson says. These services in
cluded registering for classes ear
lier than other students so she
could get her books on tape and
having a longer time to take tests.
"It scared me that people could
be so closed-minded, especially my
friends," she says. "They thought
that I should go through the Draw
and then get into a place that was
convenient, but within those Draw
numbers — which I guess is
valid," she adds.
"People said that I didn't really
need to live in Toyon. But 'really
need' is the key to the whole thing.
What does 'really need' mean?"
she asks.
"I couldn't resent someone who
has never had a 'fair* physical
opportunity for getting any 'un
fair' opportunity they can," she
explains.
"Finally I just started to say, 'I
would switch Toyon for your
eyesight any day.' That would
really shut people up," Sampson
says.
This incident is one of the few
cases of discrimination Sampson
says she has encountered.
"I don't really worry about dis
crimination. I don't get a lot of
it because you really can't see my
disability," she explains.
However, the hidden nature of
her disability often causes
Sampson other problems.
Sampson, who sings with Mixed
Company, says she can't see faces
in the audience.
"It's funny because after a show
someone will say, 'You were
staring at that guy the entire
time!' and I'll just say, 'Well, I
couldn't see him!' "

legally blind, the sophomore does not let her disability keep
her from campus activities.
with beep tones, but Sampson
says she is not good at it because
she only started using tapes dur
ing her senior year of high school.
"I would give anything to be
able to skim," she says.
Sampson can write papers using
a computer with a large screen,
although she has difficulty be
cause her eyes are very light
sensitve. Her roommates usually
help proofread her work.
Sampson also receives research
help from volunteers and friends
who will locate materials for her
in the libraries.
"People are really helpful when
you get to know them. But they
think you're weird at first. It's
hard to explain to someone why
you don't say hi to them, and if
they don't really know you,
they're afraid to ask," she ex
plains.
To prevent misunderstandings,
Sampson made an announcement
at the first house meeting in
Toyon Hall, where she lives this
year. She explained that she was
legally blind and asked people to
make an effort to introduce them
selves to her more than once.
It was "kind of scary" explain
ing her condition to almost 200
people she hadn't met yet,
Sampson says. "You think people
will be supportive, but you don't
always know."
Although her vision limitations
do not endanger her in any way,
often cause her embarrass
ment, Sampson says. Because she
can't find classrooms, she has to
be walked to class in the begin
ning of the quarter. Sometimes,
she falls down at the bottom of
a flight of stairs because she can't
see the last step.
"I hate bollards with a passion,"
she says. "A lot of times they're

in my blind spot and then they'll
jump out of it and I'll gasp and
jump. I'm sure people think I'm
really strange.
"At times when things like that
happen, I feel really scared or em
barrassed and I hate it. But a
couple hours later I'll tell my
roommates the story and we'll all
just laugh about it," Sampson
says.
In addition to her roommates,
Sampson says she finds great sup
port in the disabled community.
"None of us are willing to com
plain [to non-disabled students]
because you don't want people to
think you hate the world. It's just
not socially acceptable to let cer
tain things make you angry," she
explains.
But within the disabled com
munity there is a special degree
of understanding, Sampson says.
"We'll say, 'You know what hap
pened to me today,' and everyone
will laugh and someone will say,
'I know. The same thing happened
to me yesterday,' " she says.
However, Sampson says she did
not receive support from some
members of the community when
her request for a Draw exemption
was granted last spring.
"Some people with more serious
disabilities didn't have their
(Draw exemption) petitions
granted and it was a difficult sit
uation," she recalls.
Sampson petitioned to live in
Toyon because it was close to
classes, a necessity because she
cannot ride a bike. She also
wanted to live in a triple.
"Heather (her freshman room
mate) did a lot for me. She would
help me read papers, pay bills and
tell me if my sweater matched my
pants. It's a big job and it gets
bigger the more I do. [Heather]
said she'd really like to have a
third person to help her,"
Sampson says.
Her exemption from the Draw

created "more resentment than
ever" from her peers and even
her close friends, she says.
"There were huge amounts of
services I received before and no
one seemed to resent them,"
Sampson says. These services in
cluded registering for classes ear
lier than other students so she
could get her books on tape and
having a longer time to take tests.
"It scared me that people could
be so closed-minded, especially my
friends," she says. "They thought
that I should go through the Draw
and then get into a place that was
convenient, but within those Draw
numbers — which I guess is
valid," she adds.
"People said that I didn't really
need to live in Toyon. But 'really
need' is the key to the whole thing.
What does 'really need' mean?"
she asks.
"I couldn't resent someone who
has never had a 'fair* physical
opportunity for getting any 'un
fair' opportunity they can," she
explains.
"Finally I just started to say, 'I
would switch Toyon for your
eyesight any day.' That would
really shut people up," Sampson
says.
This incident is one of the few
cases of discrimination Sampson
says she has encountered.
"I don't really worry about dis
crimination. I don't get a lot of
it because you really can't see my
disability," she explains.
However, the hidden nature of
her disability often causes
Sampson other problems.
Sampson, who sings with Mixed
Company, says she can't see faces
in the audience.
"It's funny because after a show
someone will say, 'You were
staring at that guy the entire
time!' and I'll just say, 'Well, I
couldn't see him!' "
Editor's note: This is the second
article of a four-part series on
the experiences of disabled
people at Stanford.

In high school, Jannette
Sampson had a reputation for
being "stuck up."
"People would say to me, 'I
said hi to you and and you didn't
say anything back. You didn't
even look at me and smile,' "
she remembers.

But Sampson was not ignor
ing other students on purpose.
She didn't acknowledge them as
they passed because she
couldn't see them. Sampson is
legally blind.
Sampson was born with Star
gart's Disease, an extremely rare
and non-correctable retinal
problem. It causes her to be ex
tremely nearsighted, have poor
depth perception, and have
many blind spots in her vision.
Her condition has gotten
progressively worse and may
continue to do so.
"They tell me that I will never
go completely blind, but it's hard
to say. I could read until my
junior year of high school, but
I can't anymore," Sampson
says.
For a Stanford sophomore,
the inability to read is no small
disability. Sampson says she
feels lucky to be able to use the
resources available at the Dis
ability Resource Center.
"I do all my reading on tape,"
she explains. The taped books
are either ordered from a na

tional agency that does record
ings for the blind or read onto
tape by volunteers at the DRC.
Sampson does not read
braille, but says she probably
will have to learn.
Learning braille "takes an in
tensive six-month program and
I haven't had the time," she
says. But reading and writing

braille are necessary to function
in the business world, Sampson
says.
