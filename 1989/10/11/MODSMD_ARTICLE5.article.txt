# Student not limited by blindness

Editor's note: This is the second
article of a four-part series on
the experiences of disabled
people at Stanford.

In high school, Jannette
Sampson had a reputation for
being "stuck up."
"People would say to me, 'I
said hi to you and and you didn't
say anything back. You didn't
even look at me and smile,' "
she remembers.

AT STAMFORD

But Sampson was not ignor
ing other students on purpose.
She didn't acknowledge them as
they passed because she
couldn't see them. Sampson is
legally blind.
Sampson was born with Star
gart's Disease, an extremely rare
and non-correctable retinal
problem. It causes her to be ex
tremely nearsighted, have poor
depth perception, and have
many blind spots in her vision.
Her condition has gotten
progressively worse and may
continue to do so.
"They tell me that I will never
go completely blind, but it's hard
to say. I could read until my
junior year of high school, but
I can't anymore," Sampson
says.
For a Stanford sophomore,
the inability to read is no small
disability. Sampson says she
feels lucky to be able to use the
resources available at the Dis
ability Resource Center.
"I do all my reading on tape,"
she explains. The taped books
are either ordered from a na

tional agency that does record
ings for the blind or read onto
tape by volunteers at the DRC.
Sampson does not read
braille, but says she probably
will have to learn.
Learning braille "takes an in
tensive six-month program and
I haven't had the time," she
says. But reading and writing

braille are necessary to function
in the business world, Sampson
says.
Braille "makes you a reading
person. You can't fold pages over
on a tape. You could do that
with a braille reader," she adds.

legally blind, the sophomore does not let her disability keep
her from campus activities.
