Computer Search Services
Commercial databases, some of which
correspond to familiar printed indexes and
abstracts, include references to journal and
newspaper articles, technical reports, confer
ence proceedings, patents, dissertations, gov
ernment documents, books, software, audio
visual media, and statistics. Database searches
can save you time and effort, and may identify
information not available in printed form.
The Libraries offer Computer Search
Services by which faculty, students and staff
can have access to hundreds of databases cov
ering virtually all fields â€”sciences, engineering
social sciences, humanities, business, medicine,
law and current events. Not all of the journals
and newspapers are available on Stanford
campus, but you should be able to get them
through Interlibrary Loan.
Through the Libraries' Computer Search
Services, you have various searching options
available to you. You have options for free
DO-IT-YOURSELF SEARCHING either by
using CD-ROM (Compact Disk-Read Only
Memory) or by an abbreviated and menu
driven version of one of the most widely used
commercial databases (Dialog's Knowledge
Index). Medical Center faculty, students and
staff also have access to Dialog Medical
Connection (via LANE-MEDLINE) for DO-IT
YOURSELF searching of the medical literature.
You might find these options useful for quick
and easy searches; however, not all libraries
provide each option. So check with your
library or pick up the "Computer Search
Services" brochure for specific services and
locations.

For more complicated searches,
you might want to have the reference
staff in your library do the search for
you. Costs for the WE-DO-IT-FOR
YOU searches vary. Quick searches to
answer questions may be free. Fees
are based on computer connect time
and number of references retrieved.
Students may be eligible for low cost
searches (flat rate of $5.00) via the
Support for Online Searching (SOS)
Program. Most libraries do searches
for you; for those which do not, staff
at Green Library can help you. Call
Eddy Hogan, Green Library, Reference
Desk, 725-1054, cn.dat@forsythe for
more information.

Equipment Support for Classrooms
The Media Center at Meyer Library offers
support to faculty and TA's who wish to use
computers, video and other types of equipment
in the classroom or in the Media Center for
instructional purposes. Media Center staff
(3-0566, cn.avs@forsythe), can describe services
and equipment available.
Circulation
Borrowing Materials
Loan periods range from one day to an aca
demic year. Current University ID cards serve
as library cards for faculty, students and staff.
Other eligible borrowers must present other
identification cards; check the Privileges Desk
in Green Library, East Wing (723-14^1) or the
loan desks of any library for specific informa
tion.
Renewing Loans
Procedures for renewing loans vary
depending upon your status (faculty, student,
etc.) and the librarv.

Recalling Materials
If the item(s) you need is charged to
another borrower who has had the item for at
least two weeks, most campus libraries will
recall the item(s) for you. If you receive a recall
notice, please return the materials promptly.
Fines for overdue recalls are high since another
person is inconvenienced by the delay.
Returning Materials
To avoid fines for lost or overdue library
materials, always return them on time to the
library from which they were borrowed.
Reserves
For most courses, especially in the
Humanities and Social Sciences, faculty can
request to have book and non-book material
placed on reserve at Meyer Librarv (contact Pat
Knobloch, 723-2201, cn.res@forsythe). Most
Branch Libraries (e.g., Engineering, Chemistry,
Education) and Coordinate Libraries (e.g., Law)
also have department-related material on
reserve. Students can borrow and renew
reserved material at the loan desk for various
loan periods.
