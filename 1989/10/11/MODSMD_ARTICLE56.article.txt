Photocopy
Photocopy machines are located through
out the library system. Copies usually cost 10c
each but may vary in cost at the Coordinate
Libraries. Change machines are located near
some photocopy machines. Using a COPI
CARD (similar to a debit card), eliminates the
need to have correct change and offers reduced
rates for volume purchasers. COPICARDS
may be purchased in denominations ranging
from 52 - 1,000 copies at the COPICARD sales
offices in Lane Medical Library, Green Library
(hours: Monday - Thursday, 1:00 - 4:30 p.m.),
and in $5.00 machines at Earth Sciences,
Engineering, Meyer, and Music libraries. These
cards CANNOT be used at the Graduate
School of Business (GSB) where another type
of card is available for purchase in Jackson
Library. The Photocopy Center, located in the
basement at GSB, may be used for high volume
or high quality copying jobs.
Services for Disabled Patrons
Services and equipment designed to pro
vide full benefit of the libraries to all disabled
patrons vary from library to library. Green and
Meyer libraries are accessible to persons with
limited mobility but not all branch libraries are
readily accessible. Call ahead for assistance.
See "A Guide for Patrons with Disabilities"
for specific information.
Action Boxes
We encourage user comments and recom
mendations. Drop comments into "Action
Boxes" located in the card catalog area in
Green, East Wing, and on the second floor of
Meyer, or by using the SUGGEST command on
Socrates. Look for prompt responses to com
ments on the bulletin board in the hallway
between the East and West Wings in Green
Library and near the stairway on Meyer,
second floor. Including your name and e-mail
or street address will allow us to respond to
you more directly.
