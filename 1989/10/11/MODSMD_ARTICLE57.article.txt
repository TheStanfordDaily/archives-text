Computer Workstations
You can have access to a computer for
course assignments requiring such use at
computer workstations in several library
locations. Non-course related use of the
workstations by students, faculty and staff is
possible if the machines are free. Computer
clusters can be found in Meyer (Macintosh and
IBM with printers), Engineering (Macintosh
plus printers) and Green Libraries (IBM PCs
without printers and IBM ATs with printers).
Restrictions in use may apply. Consultant
assistance is available in Meyer only. Use the
help microcomputer cluster command in
Socrates for more specific information.
Lane Library's Medical Informatics Train
ing Laboratory (MITL) at the Medical Center
has IBMs with some printers and plans to add
MACs in the near future. Some consultation is
available on medical school programs and
literature searching.
Typewriters
For those times when computers or hand
writing is just not appropriate, use one of the
two coin operated, self-correcting electric type
writers in Meyer Library on the second floor.

Wouldn't it be handy to put your personal
belongings in a secure place while you are in
the library or to store the books that you've
checked out and plan to use in the library?
Green and Meyer Library have lockers availa
ble to you by assignment on a quarterly basis.
