As members of the Stanford community
we benefit from 100 years of planning, building,
growing, and caring. Much of the libraries'
collections here for you today have been here
for many years, and their value and usefulness
to students develop and change with the
decades. But unfortunately many factors
conspire to shorten the life of library materials.
The libraries are committed to the preservation
of our collections but we cannot do the job
alone. When you use library materials we ask
that you accept the role of "caretaker." You help
to preserve Stanford's legacy of learning for
another 100 years when you:
■ Keep food and drink away from library mate
rials. Food and beverage spills damage paper,
obscure text, attract insects, and generally
make library materials unpleasant to use.
■ Make notes, comments, etc., on scrap paper
instead of marking library materials. Ink, in
particular, may contribute to the deterioration of
book papers.
■ Use bookmarks to hold your place instead of
creasing page corners. Dog-eared or creased
comers weaken paper.
■ Handle books carefully when photocopying.
Severe damage to bindings can result when
pressure is applied while photocopying.
