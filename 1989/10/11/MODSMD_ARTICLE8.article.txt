# Third parking lot means lots of new parking

The University plans to break
ground on a third multi-level
parking structure in early 1990,
in response to the increasing need
for parking in the developing Med
ical Center and Near West Campus
areas.
The latest fixture in the Uni
versity's parking structure series,
Parking Structure 111, will be lo
cated west of the Med Center, ac
comodating employees of both the
Med Center and the new Packard
Children's Hospital, scheduled to
open in late spring 1991.
According to Thomas Auer, pro
gram manager for the Universi
ty's Office of Transportation
Programs, funds for the multi

million dollar project will come
from two sources: "inevitable"
parking permit fee hikes over the
next few years and general plant
improvement tax revenues —
money from a 4 percent levy on
every building constructed on
campus.
Once completed, the new struc
ture should alleviate some of the
parking traumas that plague reg
ular Med Center patrons. A recent
survey taken by the Hospital Se
curity Service revealed that the
1,080-space structure adjacent to
the Medical Center reaches 90 per
cent capacity by 9 a.m. and re
mains packed until 3 p.m. every
day.
Patrons of the Med Center have
complained that by 9:30 a.m. they

have had to go as far as the Stock
Farm lot to find a space to park.
Auer says the University is
"playing a game of catch-up"
when it comes to providing more
parking spaces.
Although the University does
not like the idea of high-rise struc
tures — they cost about $10,000
per parking space to build — it
appears the multi-level units will
continue to multiply.
Only 60 percent full on an
average day, the 780-space
parking structure near Roble
Field is expected to be filled to
capacity once the Applied Materi
als Research building and the
Green Earth Sciences building are
constructed and occupied, Auer
said.

He even foresees the inevitabil
ity of a fourth multi-grade
parking unit as early as 1995.
"We're running out of room to
push out, so we have to push up,"
said Auer.
High-rise parking units, how
ever, are just one of many ideas
the University has in mind to
remedy the parking headache.
Transportation Programs also
plans to renovate many of the
existing lots on campus. Specifi
cally, plans are under way to pave,
illuminate, and provide better
access to the Stock Farm lot off
Welch Road.
In addition, Auer says that the
office is continually developing in
centive programs for those who
carpool or use public transit.
