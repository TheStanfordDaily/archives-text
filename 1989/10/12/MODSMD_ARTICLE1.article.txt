# 400 at vigil offer Jackson prayers, hope
## 
### John Wagner Editorial staff 
About 400 students gathered in White Plaza last
night bearing candles to voice their prayers and
support for junior Louis Jackson, who appears in
court this morning for a hearing on charges stem
ming from the May 15 takeover of Building 10.
Speakers during the vigil expressed support for
Jackson and outrage with the administration's
refusal to speak out on behalf of Jackson, who has
been charged with six misdemeanors — including
incitement to riot and battery — for his role in the
takeover of University President Donald Kennedy's
office.
"We are here tonight out of love for a brother,"
said Black Student Union member Lisa Fitts.
Fitts said the black community was extremely
angered by Kennedy's failure to see Jackson as the
victim of selective prosecution.
"That's been the problem all along — that [Ken
nedy] does not see," Fitts said.
BSU Chair Calvin Martin said that while the
BSU and other student of color groups had planned
the vigil, it was intended as a show of campuswide
support for Jackson.
Speakers at the vigil included representatives from
Stanford's student of color groups, the Council of
Presidents, student of color groups from UC schools,
the ASSU Committee on Democracy in Education
and Keith Archuleta, assistant dean of student af
fairs and director of the Black Community Services
Center.
Many speakers, including Archuleta, voiced con
cern that the treatment of Jackson was indicative
of a larger trend of dehumanization and criminaliza
tion of people of color on college campuses and
across the country.
Jackson told the crowd the real issue at hand
was broader than his own case. "It's not just about
me," Jackson said. "It's supporting the issues of
multiculturalism and diversity at Stanford."
The evening concluded with a prayer led by the
Rev. Floyd Thompkins a new associate dean at
Memorial Church. "Lately, God, we've begun to
wonder," Thompkins said. "Where is justice?"
Thompkins prayed that when Jackson goes to
court today "[God] will be our lawyer and [God]
will be our judge."
