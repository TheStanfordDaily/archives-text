## House approves abortion funds for rape, incest victims 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - The House
agreed yesterday to allow federally paid
abortions for poor women who are victims
of rape or incest, reversing nearly a dec
ade of more restrictive votes and inviting
a veto from President Bush.
By a 216-206 vote, the House rejected
the language it has kept in the law since
1981 and instead endorsed a more liberal
provision already passed by the Senate.
An effort by conservatives to reverse the
vote then failed, 212-207.
Federal aid for abortions, available un
der Medicaid, is now limited to poor
women whose lives have been er#langered
by a pregnancy.
Yesterday's vote came three months
after a Supreme Court ruling giving
states greater powers to restrict abor
tions.
Lawmakers and activists who say
women have a right to an abortion said
the ruling spurred supporters of their
position to make their views known to
their legislators. Opponents agreed.
"The political momentum on this issue
is so strong now that if President Bush
vetoes this, he'd be making a big mis
take," said Rep. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif.,

who led the fight for the eased limita
tions.
Rep. Henry Hyde, R-111., who has led
the anti-abortion fight in the House for
years, said, "I couldn't characterize it
any other way than as a defeat for the
unborn. I was surprised, upset and dis
appointed."
House members without strong posi
tions "felt they had the Supreme Court
to protect them" until the July ruling,
said Rep. Dale Kildee, D-Mich. and a
supporter of tougher restrictions.
Now, however, "it's no longer a vote
cast in a vacuum. It's a vote with real
consequences," he said.
The provision agreed to by the House
would allow Medicaid payments for abor
tions when the mother's life is in jeopardy
or when the pregnancy resulted from rape
or incest. Since 1981 — and as recently
as Aug. 2 — the House has voted for
language limiting federal aid to abortions
only in cases in which the woman's life
was in danger.
Just a year ago, the Senate caved to
the restrictive House position on
Medicaid abortion financing by a vote of
47-43.

The abortion provision is part of a
$156.7 billion measure to finance labor,
health and education programs for fiscal
1990, which began Oct. 1. The spending
bill, which was approved 364-56, now
moves to the Senate.
Bush threatened in August to veto the
bill if it contains the more liberal abortion
language. Administration officials
reiterated that threat Wednesday.
The president's senior advisers would
recommend a veto if Congress sent him
a bill that would pay "for abortions in
cases beyond when the life of the monther
is endangered," said Alixe Glen, a White
House spokeswoman.
Vice President Dan Quayle, answering
a reporter's question during a photo ses
sion, said, "There is no retrenchment at
all by the president on this very important
issue . ..
Just one disagreement remains to be
settled between the two chambers before
the legislation goes to Bush — whether
to accept a Senate proposal to ban federal
aid to programs that buy hypodermic
needles for intravenous drug users unless
the president certifies that the effort
helps prevent the spread of AIDS.

The political momentum
on this issue is so strong
now that if President Bush
vetoes this, he'd be
making a big mistake.'
— Rep. Barbara Boxer,
D-Calif

The bill also contains more than $1.5
billion for AIDS research and treatment;
$4 billion for job-training programs; $1.9
billion for alcohol, drug abuse and mental
health programs; $11.7 billion for welfare
programs, and $2.1 billion for education
for the handicapped.
The vote was the second abortion show
down in the House since the Supreme
Court's July 3 decision in the Webster
vs. Reproductive Health Services case.
On Aug. 2, the chamber voted to dram
atically liberalize abortion restrictions in
the District of Columbia. That was the
first time since 1980 that the chamber

had rejected tighter limits.
The August vote was considered less
politically risky than Wednesday's be
cause it affected only residents of the
nation's capital, leaving unchanged
federal laws that affect the whole country.
As have countless congressional
debates on abortion, Wednesday's fight
was raged over the rights of the mother
and the rights of the fetus.
"Rape and incest is a tragedy. Nobody
says it isn't," said Hyde. "But why visit
on the second victim, the unborn child
that is the product of that criminal act,
capital punishment?"
Boxer countered, "For the sake of
human compassion, at least allow the
females of this nation to decide for them
selves along with their God" whether
they will undergo an abortion,
At several points, the debate took a
personal turn.
"I'm a psychiatrist and a physician who
has treated victims of both rape and in
cest, said Rep. James McDermott, D-
Wash. "I must tell you the last thing
victims of assault need is to have control
over their own bodies taken away from
them yet again by the government."
