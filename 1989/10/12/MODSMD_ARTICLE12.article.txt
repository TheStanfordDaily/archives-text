PRETORIA, South Africa (AP)
— President F.W. de Klerk told
militant anti-apartheid leaders
yesterday he was ready to nego
tiate on black voting rights, but
they demanded more concessions
before serious talks begin.
The three-hour meeting with
Anglican Archbishop Desmond
Tutu and two other church
leaders came a day after de Klerk
announced his decision to free
eight longtime security prisoners,
including seven leaders of the out
lawed African National Congress.
In Washington, the State De
partment welcomed the plans for
release and urged "the release of
all political prisoners, including
Nelson Mandela," the nation's
most famous prisoner.

"I hope today's meeting will be
looked on as a milestone on the
positive road ahead," de Klerk
said after the talks.
But Tutu, the Rev. Allan
Boesak, president of the World Al
liance of Reformed Churches, and
the Rev. Frank Chikane, general
secretary of the South African
Council of Churches, said de
Klerk declined to give clear-cut
responses to their demands.
"We made it clear we need
results," Chikane said. "Without
results, we can't have negotia
tions."
The clergymen demanded the
lifting of the state of emergency,
legalization of the African Na
tional Congress and other banned
groups, the release of all detainees

and political prisoners, the lifting
of restrictions on political activity,
and clemency for prisoners on
Death Row.
"If these things happen, we'll
say to our people: give them (the
government) a chance. They are
serious," Tutu said.
However, the clergymen said
they would press on with calls for
tougher economic sanctions
against South Africa unless de
Klerk complied with their de
mands.
De Klerk said Mandela's status
was not discussed at yesterday's
meeting, but the 71-year-old
leader is widely expected to be
released within the next few
months.
