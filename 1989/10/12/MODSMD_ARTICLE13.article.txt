ICA, Peru (AP) — Police action
against cocaine suppliers is futile
unless the United States and Eu
rope reduce the demand that
drives the illicit trade, President
Carlos Andres Perez of Venezuela
said yesterday.
Perez spoke on opening day of
a summit of seven Latin American
presidents in this desert city that
also is to consider expelling
Panama as the eighth member of
the Group of Eight regional or
ganization.
Panama's membership was
suspended in 1988 after Gen.

Manuel Antonio Noriega arranged
the dismissal of President Eric
Delvalle, who had tried to fire
Noriega as military commander.
The Venezuelan leader called
Noriega's military rule a "masked
dictatorship." President Alan Gar
cia of Peru used his opening re
marks to "express publicly the
Peruvian people's and the
Peruvian government's repudia
tion and condemnation of the mil
itary dictatorship." In his re
marks on the drug trade, Peres
said: "The more demand grows
in the north, the more production

will grow in the south. Police ac
tions will be useless unless
demand is reduced."
Other opening statements also
expressed support for Peru,
Colombia and Bolivia, which ar
gue that President Bush's empha
sis on attacking the cocaine traffic
at the source is not enough.
The summit began the day after
Presidents Garcia, Virgilio Barco
of Colombia and Jaime Paz
Zamora of Bolivia invited Bush to
attend a drug summit in Latin
America within 90 days. Bush ac
cepted immediately
