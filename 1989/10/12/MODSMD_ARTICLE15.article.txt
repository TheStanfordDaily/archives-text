## Assistance for TAs 
### 
THE 8 PERCENT increase in
the Humanities and Sciences
budget for teaching assis
tants is good news for everybody.
The move represents a positive and
enlightened step for the University
and a triumph for student initia
tive.
The students involved with the
ASSU's TA Task Force last year
used information to their advan
tage, assessing the situation of
graduate student TAs by surveying
those in several departments to de
termine the greatest problem
areas. The survey determined
average discussion section size, a
statistic even the School of Human
ities and Sciences did not have at
their fingertips.
Armed with the results of the
survey, task force members met
with the Dean of Humanities and
Sciences Ewart Thomas and made

their case for a greater monetary
commitment to the work of TAs.
The administration responded
favorably to the new information,
holding what Thomas termed "a
couple of productive meetings"
with task force members and then
committing an additional $260,000
to this year's budget.
The new money will mean higher
salaries for graduate students
struggling to make ends meet and
a decrease in the size of most sec
tions. The smaller size will yield
increased individual attention,
which is key to a positive learning
experience.
Thanks to strong teamwork
based on a mutual desire to im
prove undergraduate education,
students in large lecture classes
will be getting more for their
money this year.
