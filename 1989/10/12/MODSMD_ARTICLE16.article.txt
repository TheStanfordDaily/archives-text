# Think about fumes

JUST WHAT is that guy sitting
in front of Meyer Library
thinking about? And why does
he look so worried?
Chances are, among the many
troubles that weigh down the
sculpted shoulders of Auguste
Rodin's "The Thinker" is the fate
of his brothers and sisters in
bronze over in the Stanford Art
Museum's Rodin Sculpture Gar
den.
For nearly a year, the garden
has been at the center of a raging
debate between Art History Prof.
Albert Elsen and the Chemistry
Department.
In November 1988, shortly after
"The Thinker" arrived at Stanford,
the Chemistry Department re
quested the re-opening of a tem
porary parking lot near the garden.
The lot had been closed following
the completion of a four-story

parking structure.
However, Elsen contends that
fumes, gravel and dust from cars
will damage the sculptures.
Stanford's Rodin collection is the
largest outside of Paris and is an
important and beautiful stop on
any visitor's tour of the campus.
If re-opening the temporary lot
will damage the artwork, then the
lot should remain closed. Re
opening the temporary lot would
not be very beneficial. The new
parking structure holds 1,000 cars
and opening the old lot would add
only 50 more spaces.
In addition, the University
should act on the Art Department's
suggestion that a grove of tall trees
be planted on the site of the tem
porary lot to act as a buffer against
pollution from the new parking
structure.
Maybe then "The Thinker" will
be able to relax a little.
