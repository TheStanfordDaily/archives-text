Equality of justice is what is sought for Jackson

DAVID JAMES writes in an Oct.
9 letter to The Daily, "Carrying
out justice equally is a cause we
can all support." James does not seem
to realize that equality of justice is
what is being sought in the case of
Louis Jackson â€” not an absence of
punishment, but fair and equal punish
ment.
The call to drop additional charges
selectively and unfairly meted out
against Jackson are based upon the
fact that hundreds of other students
were guilty of unlawful assemblage,
trespassing, and refusal to disperse.
At least 55 other students were
probably guilty of obstructing police
justice, and ten others of incitement to
riot, yet only Jackson faces possible
imprisonment. James believes that the
scapegoating of Jackson is "woefully
inadequate" justification for the belief

of many that equal punishment is not
being found in this case.
James believes that "if we had the
evidence, the other guilty parties
should be likewise prosecuted." The
evidence of which James speaks is a
videotape of the May 15 protest being
used by police as the key evidence to
selectively prosecute Jackson.
Are we supposed to believe that it
was only turned on when Jackson was
speaking? I would think not.
This is not a "potential imperfection'
of the justice system. The facts are
that the prosecution is claiming that
only Jackson is identifiable and this is
the reason why only he is being
prosecuted. This is not equality of
justice. How can James claim to sup
port it if he ignores these facts?
The facts surrounding the charge of
battery, which carries the strongest

threat of a jail sentence, were clearly
presented in Wednesday's Daily. How
ever, the main point that James and
others truly committed to equality
within the justice system must bear in
mind is that the "victim" of this crime
was, in her own words, "never injured,
threatened or otherwise harmed."
In fact, the victim never pressed
charges and as she wrote in a letter to
Jackson, never will. It is the police
department that is claiming they were
injured by the alleged battery. This
does not make sense to me or many
others who are wondering if justice
will be carried out equally.
Jackson was charged three weeks
after the fact. He missed all of his
final exams and is on academic proba
tion this year.
I do not believe that this timing was
an unfortunate coincidence made by

unknowing persons at the police de
partment. Although James may not be
aware, the Federal Bureau of Investi
gation has developed and implemented
programs in the past whose sole pur
pose was to identify and neutralize
potential leaders of the black communi
ty-
Those who think this only existed in
the '60s and '70s are sorely mistaken.
James may believe that it is "zeal"
or emotionalism which causes many
African-Americans to question the
motivations and ultimate goal of the
judicial and educational systems in this
country.
We are not blindly letting another of
our young men who has the strength
to work for the changes that will
benefit us all be cut down.
