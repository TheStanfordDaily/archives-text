# A 						real education is learning how to work with conservatives

Despite their use of statistics and
historical trivia, conversations and arti
cles push for excising the Hoover Insti
tution from the University because the
Hoover Institution is an able
fundraiser and a conservative think
tank.
These are hardly "crimes" that
deserve banishment.
Many of us, both students and facul
ty, seek solace, safety and sanctity of
ideas within the womb-like University
walls. To the outside world, American
colleges and universities represent
"liberal," a label here meaning a belief
that greater use of government is good
Here it is safe to think as imagina
tively and radically as one dreams. I
can understand that feelings of discom

fort, violation and trespassing take hold
when the "ivory tower" of Stanford is
actually Hoover Tower, inhabited by
men and women who think differently.
In the world beyond the womb live
wealthy and poor people, liberal think
ers and advocates and conservative
ones, too.
Much of life out there is unfair. Of
ten we have to interact with people
with whom we disagree.
We do not like them. Sometimes it is
because we find them aggressive, sel
fish and impolite. In board rooms,
union halls and laboratories, on base
ball diamonds, buses, and Congres
sional panels there is a person or a
group of people we want to wish, zap,
zing, vote, argue and pray away. In the
rare occasion we succeed, nefariousness
incarnate returns the following week
with another face and home phone
number.
In his recent article about Hoover,
Prof. John Manley writes, "Stanford's
mission is education." If this is so,

then the University cannot sever its
ties to Hoover.
Education is more than reading
books, writing papers and listening to a
professor talk about his or her ideas.
Sometimes it's learning there are
people who think less government is
better and are good at raising money
â€” and then learning to work with
them.
