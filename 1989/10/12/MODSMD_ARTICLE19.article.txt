# Pro-life activists insensitive to plight of poor and sick

Probably that one woman in five
that Janice Keen referred to in the
Oct. 9 Daily article ("Abortion activists
hit, miss in demonstrations") was
missing a Planned Parenthood appoint
ment not to get an abortion, but to be

screened for cancer or obtain birth
control or be treated for a sexually
transmitted disease.
How nice of Operation Rescue to
prevent said woman from obtaining the
health care she needs. Besides, even if
she had gotten inside the clinic, she
might not have been able to afford the
services she needed.
Aside from performing safe abortions
— an invaluable service in itself —
family planning clinics supply much
needed health care to women. Tradi
tionally these clinics have offered most
of their services on a sliding scale.
Now, thanks to California Governor
George Deukmejian, most of their state
funding — which did not go toward
funding abortions, by the way — is
gone, two-thirds to be exact. So prices
go up for everyone. And poor women
get hit the hardest.
