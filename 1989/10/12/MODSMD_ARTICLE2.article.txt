# Stanford enters energy feud
## Cogeneration Plant to raise University's fees 
### Liz Lempert Staff writer 
A dispute over energy costs is
simmering between the Univer
sity and the plant which supplies
Stanford with all of its electricity,
steam and chilled water.
The Cardinal Cogeneration Fa
cility, located at the corner of
Campus Drive and Via Ortega,
wants to charge the University
more for its services, said Adrian
Arima, an attorney for Stanford.
According to Arima, when the
facility was conceived five years
ago, officials at the cogeneration
plant overestimated the future
cost of energy. "A price increase
didn't happen as soon as Cogen
thought," and now the company
is not receiving the income it pre
dicted, he said.
The dispute could involve "tens

of millions of dollars," Arima said.
Despite the potentially high costs
involved, the two sides have not
officially discussed the matter
since May, Arima added.
The Cogen plant, operated
jointly by General Electric and
Kaiser Engineers, not only sup
plies Stanford with its energy, but
also serves as an emergency
backup power source for Stanford
Hospital.
According to the contract cur
rently under dispute, GE and
Kaiser sell power to the Univer
sity at the price charged by Pacific
Gas and Electric, the company
that supplied the University's en
ergy prior to the construction of
the cogenerator, Arima said.
According to Arima, changes in
PG&E's rate structure coupled
with the University's purchase of
a PG&E substation on campus

would have lowered Stanford's
PG&E rates for the last five years.
Since the University no longer
receives its energy from PG&E,
the dispute over cost is "all the
oretical," Arima explained.
"We don't want to pay more
than if we'd stayed with PG&E,"
he said.
Jim Marzonie, general manager
of the Cardinal Cogen plant,
would not comment on the plant's
arrangement with the University.
But Marzonie did say that he
was concerned about the rapid
rate of increase in the University's
energy consumption.
"Stanford's energy needs are in
creasing much more rapidly than
expected," Marzonie said, and
have far exceeded estimates made
by the University when the facil
ity was planned.
The plant is already "beyond
capacity for chilled water," and in
the next few years the "need for
steam may exceed the capacity of
the facility as currently situated,"
he said.
While the construction of a
fourth cooling tower is scheduled
to begin at the end of the month,
the tower will not affect the fa
cility's capacity to generate more
steam, Marzonie said.
"The new cooling tower may
provide additional capacity for

chilled water to the University,
but it is not a panacea," he said.
Eventually, Stanford must
reduce its consumption, he said.
"You can look at this as a mini
energy crisis. It's not that we don't
have the energy, it's that we can't
convert and deliver that energy,"
Marzonie said.
Cogeneration, the simultaneous
production of electrical and useful
thermal energy from a single fuel
source, came into vogue during
the energy crisis of the late '70s,
Marzonie said.
Recalling that "there was a
strong push in this country to
become more energy efficient and

more energy independent," Mar
zonie said cogeneration provided
a popular and more efficient al
ternative source of energy.
Prior to cogeneration, electric
ity was produced from burning
gas while steam was generated
separately, in boilers. These sys
tems wasted up to 67 percent of
potentially useful energy in the
conversion process, according to
Marzonie.
The cogeneration facility con
serves energy by producing both
electricity and steam at once. The
facility burns natural gas in tur
bines to produce electricity and
uses the heat generated in the
process to produce steam.
