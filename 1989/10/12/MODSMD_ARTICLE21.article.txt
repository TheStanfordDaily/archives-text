"In response to all those who will invite
you to accept their agendas and their
values, you should ask hard questions,
make them prove everything twice and
then decide."
— Donald Kennedy.
OVER the past couple of weeks,
Kennedy's words have been con
strued in any number of ways.
The interpretations range from support
for the liberal ideal of questioning au
thority to a carte blanche for conserva
tives to bash on the People's Platform
and people with Third World back
grounds.
While Kennedy's message may have
been well intended, so far it seems the
only thing it has produced is more
animosity between different groups on
campus.
"Hey, look! Now Don's on our side!"
"No he's not, he's still on our side!"
"Is not! Especially after last spring!"
"Is too! That Campbell guy at Hoover
just made fun of him!"
Really. Sometimes I wonder if this is
what he really wanted to come of his
speech: to have a bunch of people who
he wasn't even addressing in the first
place argue about what he really meant.
I'm sure he didn't want to be the prize
in some sort of political tug-of-war across
campus.
Maybe what he said might have been
better received if he had expressed what
a freshman told me last weekend. She
said, "I'm really sort of naive. I mean, I
don't know everything yet, but I'll learn."
Her words surprised me. For the first

time, I met someone at Stanford who not
only didn't have all the answers but was
honest enough to say it.
All too often, I've sat in that big lecture
hall, with a professor rattling off concepts
and formulas and vocabulary and equa
tions like they were going out of fashion.
Those of us who don't have a clue don't
ask questions; heaven forbid that anyone
find out we're confused. Those of us who
do understand ask useless questions to
flaunt what we already know.
Either way, not much progress is made.
In the same way, not much happens
when people with completely opposite
views try to engage in "intelligent" dis
cussion without listening to each other.
Most of the time that could be spent
listening and understanding is wasted on
preparing counterarguments.
No one comes away with much more
than a false sense of pride for not having
allowed the other person to win.
The point of all this isn't about egos
in a lecture hall or bickering in a debate
— but about how it all leads to some
serious misunderstandings. Problems of
race, religion and sexual orientation (just
to name a few) stem not from true ig
norance, but from the belief that we al
ready know everything about these
subjects.
Before anyone can be "educated" on
these topics, he or she must first accept
the fact that there's still more to learn,
that there's another perspective that may
be just as valid as what he or she already
calls true.
When 1 think of all of this, I wonder
if any of this understanding ever really

went on with the takeover of the presi
dent's office last spring. After the office
was cleared and the arrests were made,
there were a lot of meetings between the
administration and the student groups
involved.
There were also promises as well as
specific actions taken on the concerns
that were raised. The administration
found the time and the money to effect
some change.
What seemed missing, though, was for
someone — the administration, one of
the student groups, a police officer, the
district attorney, anyone — to say that
maybe they were wrong in even the small
est way.
After all, the entire ordeal was far from
ideal, when we look at it from either side
of the yellow police line.
It would be interesting to hear someone
mutter under his or her breath, "Yes,
we did make some mistakes."
It really would be refreshing for a
change from the endless propaganda com
ing from both sides. But maybe we're all
too old and mature for that.
Maybe we could leave it to that one
freshman to be so honest.

— but about how it all leads to some
serious misunderstandings. Problems of
race, religion and sexual orientation (just
to name a few) stem not from true ig
norance, but from the belief that we al
ready know everything about these
subjects.
Before anyone can be "educated" on
these topics, he or she must first accept
the fact that there's still more to learn,
that there's another perspective that may
be just as valid as what he or she already
calls true.
When 1 think of all of this, I wonder
if any of this understanding ever really

went on with the takeover of the presi
dent's office last spring. After the office
was cleared and the arrests were made,
there were a lot of meetings between the
administration and the student groups
involved.
There were also promises as well as
specific actions taken on the concerns
that were raised. The administration
found the time and the money to effect
some change.
What seemed missing, though, was for
someone — the administration, one of
the student groups, a police officer, the
district attorney, anyone — to say that
maybe they were wrong in even the small
est way.
After all, the entire ordeal was far from
ideal, when we look at it from either side
of the yellow police line.
It would be interesting to hear someone
mutter under his or her breath, "Yes,
we did make some mistakes."
It really would be refreshing for a
change from the endless propaganda com
ing from both sides. But maybe we're all
too old and mature for that.
Maybe we could leave it to that one
freshman to be so honest.
