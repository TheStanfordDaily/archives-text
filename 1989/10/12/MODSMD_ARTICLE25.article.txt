## Stanford golf course elevates green prices 
### Howard Caro 
If you want to make some divots
in the Stanford Golf Course this
year, plan on paying a bit extra
for the privilege.
Stanford's Athletic Department
recently announced a minor in
crease of student green fees from
$9 to $10 for the 1989-90 school
year. Increases for faculty, staff
and alumni golfers rose an
average of 6 or 7 percent as well.
Senior Associate Director of
Athletics Alan Cummings pointed
out that the athletic department
annually reviews the rates at the
golf course and implements
changes after September 1 of each
year. According to Cummings, the
previous rates were insufficient to
maintain the golfing facilities.
"Every year the cost of operat
ing the golf course is increasing,"
Cummings said. "We have to hire
a lot of people to maintain the
quality of the course."
The reaction of student golfers
around campus has been negative,
as expected. "Most students have
a limited supply of money," fresh
man Jon Siskin said. "The golf

course is for the school and the
students. They shouldn't raise our
rates."
"Unless they're making some
drastic improvements in quality
of play, I don't think they should
raise the rates," sophomore golfer
Dom DeMarco added.
Cummings, however, disagreed.
"Golf is a sport that costs money
for clubs, shoes, balls and green
fees. I don't see $10 per round as
stretching the students' budgets.
"Anyway, I think $10 for a
round is very reasonable. It's still
substantially lower than the rates
of other courses in the area and
elsewhere."
In addition, Cummings
reminded students that they do
not have to play golf. "You've got
to understand that [playing golf]
is part of the students' entertain
ment dollar," he said. "Such
spending is totally discretionary.
I know that the students have
limited entertainment money, but
other things, like movies and beer,
are continually going up in price
also. Anyway, I think that for a
course that was rated 20th best
in California, $10 is cheap."

Golfers will have to dig for a few extra quarters if they plan on
bogeying any holes at the Stanford Golf Course this year.
