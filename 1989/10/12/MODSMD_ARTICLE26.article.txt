# Nicknames pervade Cardinal football world
## 
### 
A lot of people ask me how I got the nick
name "Buck." I wish there was a long and
colorful tale about my name, but there isn't.
My Dad nicknamed my brother Rock after
Notre Dame's legendary Coach, Knute Rockne.
So when I came along, Dad thought I should
have a rugged nickname as well. He whittled
the list of choices to three: Bronco, Buffalo
and Buck. "Buck" was the only name that
Mom would let him call me (thanks, Mom).
Actually, Stanford football has a tradition
of great nicknames. "The Vow Boys" were so
labeled because they promised each other
never to lose to the USC, after they were
defeated their freshman year. The defense of
Stanford's 1971 Rose Bowl team was called
"The Thunder Chickens."
The litany of nicknaming survives on the
1989 squad.
For some inexplicable reason, the guys on
our team have found it necessary to give me
nicknames other than the one Dad tagged
onto me. Because our players are endowed
with a keen sense of perception, many of them
have noticed that I am not real tall and have
a receding hairline. They decided, at various
times, to call me "Ziggy," "Charlie Brown,"
and "Barney Rubble." One player, building
on the hairline theme, said, "His forehead is
so big it's a five-head."
Needless to say, I was called five-head for
a while.
But alas, I am not the only member of our
team to suffer from this naming ritual.
Much to Chuck Gillingham's chagrin, he
was born with an inordinately large head.
The simple name "Horsehead" suffices for
Chuck. Lester Archambeau is frequently in a

butler, 'Lurch.'

bad mood. Since it is so easy to get under
his skin, we call him "Itchy Scratchy Archie."
Many of our names are given out of con
venience. Matt Borkowski is "Bork," Estevan
Avila is "E" and Andy Papathanassiou is
"Papa."
Andy was given another name when he was
a freshman. John Barnes, an offensive tackle,
called him "Papa Can of Seafood" because it
rhymed with Andy's last name.
Some of the other labels are obvious. Chris
Hawkins is "Hawk" John Hopkins is "Hoppy,"

Rob Hinckley is "Hinck," and Ryan Shea is
"Ryno." 1 like to lengthen Ryan's name to
"Rhinoceros" just because no one else does.
In our video society, it is only natural that
television and movies would impact team nick
names. Derron Klafter has the misfortune of
resembling the "Adam's Family" butler,
"Lurch." Mario Shane is named "Sugar Bear"
after the lovable little cub that represents
Super Sugar Crisp. The Grinch Who Stole
Christmas served the team's purpose in the
case of Bryan Schultz. Because he is so small,
we named him "Boo," after 800 Who, the
brother of Cindy Lou Who, who was no more
than two.
The movie favorites begin with Aaron Rem
bisz. Because everyone enjoys a good Sylvester
Stallone movie, he is called "Rembo." Sticking
with the Sly Stallone theme, Bruce Lang is
called "Clubber," after Clubber Lang, the vil
lainous rival of Rocky in Rocky 111.
The team looked to a deeper and more
meaningful film when we decided to name
Darran Baird, "Bugar," due to his striking
resemblence to the character by the same
name in "Revenge of the Nerds." My personal
favorite, however, is Vince "Above the"
Lawler.
In some cases, a nickname doesn't stick. A
couple players tried to call Chuck Robinson
"Doctor Concussion," but no one else joined
them. Chuck is glad.
Scott Palmbush has a last name that looks
like it is a nickname. There have been so
many derivatives made out of his surname
that I decided to only share one. After receiv-
