### 
IRVING, Texas (AP) - Min
nesota general manager Mike
Lynn visited Herschel Walker's
home yesterday to try to per
suade the Dallas Cowboys' star
running back to join the
Vikings.
The package offered by the
Vikings reportedly includes
former Stanford superstar run
ning back Darrin Nelson, two
No.l draft picks, picks in the
second and third rounds and
three vetran players, including
Nelson and cornerback Carl
Lee.
"I told him all the reasons
why he should go to Minnesota,
but we still don't have a deal,"
Lynn said.
"I'm not disappointed and the

clock is ticking and it will con
tinue to tick until Tuesday at 4
p.m. (the NFL trading deadline).
There is no urgency in the sit
uation," Lynn said, promising
further talks.
Lynn talked about a trade
with Cowboys officials and
Walker's agents late Tuesday,
but Walker showed up for a
team meeting and morning
practice yesterday.
He was excused by Cowboys
coach Jimmy Johnson from the
afternoon session and met with
Lynn.
The winless Cowboys play
San Francisco Sunday and,
asked about his chances for
being with Dallas, Walker said,
"Good, I reckon. Nothing's hap

pened."
The Pro Bowl running back,
who has joked with reporters
for several days about his depar
ture, was more serious yester
day.
"I'm planning on playing with
the Cowboys unless something
changes," he said.
Walker didn't say what that
"something" could be.
"There are a lot of teams in
terested and we're listening to
what they say," he said.
Walker said he would not
refuse a trade to Minnesota.
"The issue is whether they (the
Cowboys) want to trade me. I'm
going to play no matter where
I am," he said.
