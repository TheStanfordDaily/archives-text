# Old Pavilion begins renovation schedule

Stanford volleyball fans who at
tended the Sept. 30 match against
Oregon at Old Pavilion and drank
from the state-of-the-art,
automatically-activated water
fountains were among the first to
experience the benefits of the
1987 plan for athletic renovation
at Stanford.
"The noticeable emergence of
interest in recreational athletics
during the past 10 years at Stan
ford University prompted a msyor
undertaking in 1987 to promote
athletic facilities for physical ed
ucation, recreation and in
tramurals," Senior Assoc.
Director of Athletics Alan Cum
mings said.
Recently, that 1987 "blueprint"
culminated in a two-part develop
ment agenda. In the immediate
future, the proposal will focus on
the improvement of the Athletics
East region, which includes Old
Pavilion and Ford Center. Old Pa
vilion, re-opened this past month,
will be appended by Ford Center,
an athletic annex presently under
construction. Planners addition
ally expect initiation of a West
Campus athletic center situated
next to the New West tennis
courts.
The crowded conditions of
Maples Pavilion, which presently
is utilized by four intercollegiate
teams as both a practice and com
petition facility, and the con
stricted space available for
weights at Encina Gym swayed
planners to concentrate immedi
ately on Athletics East. The ren
ovation of Old Pavilion as a
volleyball and physical education
facility constituted the first seg
ment of a possible remedy. How
ever, the crux of the dilemma will
be addressed by the creation of
the Ford Center for Sports and
Recreation situated immediately
behind Old Pavilion.
Expected to open in the middle
of Sept. 1990, the Ford Center
will feature a new gym for the
gymnastics team, more practice
space and additional volleyball,
basketball and badminton courts.
The arena will span an area com
parable to Old Pavilion and, in
the view of Cummings, will
"enable us to take a significant
step forward in accomplishing our
goal."
The Ford Center and Old Pa
vilion are also intended to serve
as catalysts to developments else
where. The space vacated in En
cina by the gymnasts will be
utilized to "significantly expand
the weight room for both student
and faculty usage," according to
Cummings.

'More space is a
good idea. The weight
room always seems
crowded.'

"More space is a good idea. The
weight room always seems
crowded," freshman crew athlete
Josh Geiger said.
According to Matt Maley, a
recreational user, "Later in the
day, at around 4:00 to 4:30 , the
weight room at Encina is so
crowded you have to work with
three or four people on the same
machine.
In addition, the renovation will
dramatically enhance the availa
bility of Maples Pavilion. "Last
year, the team really had a hard
time getting gym time in Maples,"
Cardinal volleyball middle blocker
Bev Oden said. "We had to prac
tice at odd hours. Now, we play
at the prime times."
Nevertheless, the marked im
provements will come at some ex
pense. The total program cost of
Ford Center is estimated at $10
million, provided completely by
alumni.
Progress at West Campus
depends upon the status of Roble
Gym. Currently, there is specula
tion that the space in Roble will
be converted into academic facil
ities. Consequently, planning for
a complex in the land adjacent to
the West Campus tennis courts to
replace the lost gymnasium has
begun. According to Cummings,
however, it is not clear which
steps at Roble or West Campus
will be taken next.
Currently, planners speculate
that the construction of the West
Campus facility will occur in a
"modular sense." First, the core
of the facility, the swimming pool
and lockers will be created and
then encircled by a number of ath
letic arenas. Included in the pos
sible expansion will be another
gymnasium, judo and martial arts
regions, a dance hall, weight
room, racquetball courts and a
courtyard. During the process, a
parking lot will be installed at the
tennis courts.
The initiation of such changes,
according to Cummings, coincided
with the arrival of Andy Geiger
as athletic director 10 years ago
and was catalyzed by a "coopera
tive administration."
"It was clear that we needed to
upgrade and improve our existing
facilities," Cummings said. "We
remain anxious to make further
improvements."
