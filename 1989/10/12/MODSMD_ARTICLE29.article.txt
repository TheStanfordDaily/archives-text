When college coaches begin to
build quality programs, they
count on talented recruiting
classes to make their programs
consistently strong. In addition to
a strong recruiting class, however,
a coach's dream is a quality walk
on who makes a significant dif
ference in changing the program.
Sophomore soccer player Michelle
Sullivan is that type of player.
"The clearest way to state it is
to say that Michelle has developed
into an integral part of the team,"
Coach Berhane Andeberhan said.

idea whether she would even be

part of the Stanford squad. After
playing two years of soccer on the
Maryland State Team and four
years on the varsity squad at Al

sington, Md., Sullivan selected
Stanford, hoping to play soccer
without having had much contact
with the Stanford program. She
had never seen the team play, had
only the statistics about the 4-11-4
program and had no feel for the
level of play on the team.
"It was hard to take the risk
of coming across the nation an
entire month before school started
with no idea if I had a chance to
make the team," Sullivan said.
Last season, Andeberhan wel
comed his first recruiting class, a

p'oup which did not include Sul
livan. Since many of the recruited
players came from the West Coast,
Andeberhan already had coached
many of the players on national
teams and watched others on
recruiting trips. Sullivan joined
classmates Tracy Allen and
Kristin McGibbons, both who
have been sidelined this season
with knee ii\juries, as the only
walk-ons selected for the squad.
This season, of the 10 freshmen
joining the squad only Wendy
Kevan, Lesley Edwards, and Katie
Geib survived the walk-on chal
lenge.
"The try-out period is the only
