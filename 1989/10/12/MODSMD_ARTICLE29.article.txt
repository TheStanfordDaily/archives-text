# Sullivan plays a Renaissance role in Cardinal soccer drama
## 
### Michael Clayton Staff writer 
When college coaches begin to
build quality programs, they
count on talented recruiting
classes to make their programs
consistently strong. In addition to
a strong recruiting class, however,
a coach's dream is a quality walk
on who makes a significant dif
ference in changing the program.
Sophomore soccer player Michelle
Sullivan is that type of player.
"The clearest way to state it is
to say that Michelle has developed
into an integral part of the team,"
Coach Berhane Andeberhan said.
Two years ago, Sullivan had no
idea whether she would even be

part of the Stanford squad. After
playing two years of soccer on the
Maryland State Team and four
years on the varsity squad at Al
bert Einstein High School in Ken
sington, Md., Sullivan selected
Stanford, hoping to play soccer
without having had much contact
with the Stanford program. She
had never seen the team play, had
only the statistics about the 4-11-4
program and had no feel for the
level of play on the team.
"It was hard to take the risk
of coming across the nation an
entire month before school started
with no idea if I had a chance to
make the team," Sullivan said.
Last season, Andeberhan wel
comed his first recruiting class, a

p'oup which did not include Sul
livan. Since many of the recruited
players came from the West Coast,
Andeberhan already had coached
many of the players on national
teams and watched others on
recruiting trips. Sullivan joined
classmates Tracy Allen and
Kristin McGibbons, both who
have been sidelined this season
with knee ii\juries, as the only
walk-ons selected for the squad.
This season, of the 10 freshmen
joining the squad only Wendy
Kevan, Lesley Edwards, and Katie
Geib survived the walk-on chal
lenge.
"The try-out period is the only
time you feel outside the team,"
Sullivan said. "Berhane gives
everyone a fair shot at try-outs,
but as a walk-on you know less
spots are available. After surviv
ing it, you're just another part of
the team."
According to Andeberhan, Sul
livan used excellent work habits
last season and this spring to be
come an essential part of this
year's team. He described Sullivan
as an incredibly hard worker who,
despite being hampered by illness
last winter and by a knee ir\jury
this summer, has become a reli
able force. Despite playing the pri
mary defensive position, sweeper,
for most of this season, Sullivan
has contributed one assist.
"She is a very versatile player
who has focused on the things the
team needed her to focus on,"
Andeberhan said. "She held the
team together earlier this fall
when [sophomore All-America
candidate] Heather Mclntyre went
down. Michelle took over at
sweeper."
Now that Mclntyre has re
turned to her position, Andeber
han has placed Sullivan in
different positions. Andeberhan
has played Sullivan at outside full
back in recent games and will
probably include her as a

'She is a very ver
satile player who

things the team
needed her to
focus on.'

defensive midfielder in upcoming
games.
"As long as I know beforehand,
I do like moving around," Sullivan
said. "I see it as a challenge. I get
to see the game from different
viewpoints."
Sullivan has also noticed a
marked difference in this year's
team. Along with a renewed level
of support from the athletic de
partment and with recently
attained corporate sponsorship,
she feels the program has quickly
grown bigger and better. Cur
rently, the team is ranked 19th
in the nation.
"I remember the team being
pretty unsure last year when we
looked at the incredibly difficult
schedule we had for 1989," she
said. "Now, with the talent on
this squad, we see it as a chal
lenge. Last year, we were always
the underdog. This year we're a
stronger team that can hang with
the top-20 squads."

the team."
According to Andeberhan, Sul
livan used excellent work habits
last season and this spring to be
come an essential part of this
year's team. He described Sullivan
as an incredibly hard worker who,
despite being hampered by illness
last winter and by a knee ir\jury
this summer, has become a reli
able force. Despite playing the pri

for most of this season, Sullivan
has contributed one assist.
"She is a very versatile player
who has focused on the things the
team needed her to focus on,"
Andeberhan said. "She held the
team together earlier this fall

down. Michelle took over at
sweeper."
Now that Mclntyre has re

"As long as I know beforehand,
I do like moving around," Sullivan
said. "I see it as a challenge. I get
to see the game from different

Sullivan has also noticed a

team. Along with a renewed level
of support from the athletic de

attained corporate sponsorship,
she feels the program has quickly
grown bigger and better. Cur

in the nation.
"I remember the team being
pretty unsure last year when we
looked at the incredibly difficult
schedule we had for 1989," she
said. "Now, with the talent on
this squad, we see it as a chal

the underdog. This year we're a
stronger team that can hang with
the top-20 squads."
