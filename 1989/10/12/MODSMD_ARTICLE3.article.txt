# Delivering protest to Domino's
## Pro-choice and safety supporters plan boycott 
### Angela Bakker Lisa Nellor 
Stanford's popular late-night
snack, Domino's Pizza, has come
under fire from two national
groups that recently organized
boycotts of the Michigan-based
company.
Growing concern over the pos
sible safety hazards of Domino's
guaranteed 30-minute delivery
time and alleged company ties to
anti-abortion groups have caught
the attention of pizza consumers
nationwide.
The Ann Arbor, Mich., chapter
of the National Organization for
Women has charged that Domino's
founder, Thomas Monaghan, who
has an estimated personal worth
of $480 million, has been donating
large sums of money to Operation

Rescue, an anti-abortion organi
zation.
The Michigan NOW chapter
picketed the Ann Arbor Domino's
and is now advocating a pizza
boycott.
Susie Avril, press aide for NOW
national headquarters, said the
organization is backing the local
boycott with "informational pick
eting" nationwide.
"There has never been a con
nection between Domino's and
Operation Rescue," said Ron
Siegrist, manager of the Palo Alto
Domino's.
However, he added that in 1988
Monaghan did make a $50,000
donation to the Michigan Com
mittee to End Tax-Funded Abor
tions. However, this sum was a
"personal contribution," Siegrist
said.

Siegrist emphasized that
Monaghan's actions did not nec
essarily reflect the opinions on
abortion held by local Domino's
owners and employees â€” the two
groups who, according to Siegrist,
would feel the greatest effects of
a Stanford boycott.
Graduate student Elizabeth
Wahl, founder of the Stanford
Pro-Choice Alliance, said that an
organized boycott of Domino's on
the Stanford campus is not pres
ently in effect, although the group
is working to spread information
about Domino's around the
campus.
Wahl said that a boycott would
"boil down to a matter of conven
ience" since Domino's is presently
the most popular pizza deliverer
