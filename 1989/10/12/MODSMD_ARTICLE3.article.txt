# Delivering protest to Domino's
## Pro-choice and safety supporters plan boycott 
### Angela Bakker Lisa Nellor 
Stanford's popular late-night
snack, Domino's Pizza, has come
under fire from two national
groups that recently organized
boycotts of the Michigan-based
company.
Growing concern over the pos
sible safety hazards of Domino's
guaranteed 30-minute delivery
time and alleged company ties to
anti-abortion groups have caught
the attention of pizza consumers
nationwide.
The Ann Arbor, Mich., chapter
of the National Organization for
Women has charged that Domino's
founder, Thomas Monaghan, who
has an estimated personal worth
of $480 million, has been donating
large sums of money to Operation

Rescue, an anti-abortion organi
zation.
The Michigan NOW chapter
picketed the Ann Arbor Domino's
and is now advocating a pizza
boycott.
Susie Avril, press aide for NOW
national headquarters, said the
organization is backing the local
boycott with "informational pick
eting" nationwide.
"There has never been a con
nection between Domino's and
Operation Rescue," said Ron
Siegrist, manager of the Palo Alto
Domino's.
However, he added that in 1988
Monaghan did make a $50,000
donation to the Michigan Com
mittee to End Tax-Funded Abor
tions. However, this sum was a
"personal contribution," Siegrist
said.

Siegrist emphasized that
Monaghan's actions did not nec
essarily reflect the opinions on
abortion held by local Domino's
owners and employees â€” the two
groups who, according to Siegrist,
would feel the greatest effects of
a Stanford boycott.
Graduate student Elizabeth
Wahl, founder of the Stanford
Pro-Choice Alliance, said that an
organized boycott of Domino's on
the Stanford campus is not pres
ently in effect, although the group
is working to spread information
about Domino's around the
campus.
Wahl said that a boycott would
"boil down to a matter of conven
ience" since Domino's is presently
the most popular pizza deliverer
to campus, but she added, "The
people who are really committed
to pro-choice and safety issues will
support the boycott."
Another cause of concern arises
from the 20 Domino's drivers who,
in the rush to deliver pizzas
within the guaranteed 30
minutes, were involved in fatal
accidents in 1988.
This driver death rate is "inex
cusably high, as high as the job
related death rate for the mining
industry," said Joseph Kinney of
the National Safe Workplace In
stitute, which has also organized
a boycott against Domino's.

The institute is attempting to
garner support for its boycott on
college campuses and is urging
students not to work as drivers,
Kinney said. Currently, there is
no such organized boycott at Stan
ford.
Despite the statistics and public
response, Monaghan told People
magazine that he stands behind
the 30-minute guarantee, claim
ing it encourages speed within the
store, not on the streets.
Siegrist agreed, adding that no
employees in his store have been
involved in automobile accidents
as a result of the 30-minute guar
antee.
"A delivery service places more
people in the position to be in
volved in accidents," he said,
noting that approximately 1,000

'There has never
been a connection
between Domino's
and Operation Res
cue.'

pizzas are delivered per week to
the Stanford campus alone.
Because of this fact, the fran
chise emphasizes safety over
delivery time, Siegrist said. He
estimated that less than 50 per
cent of the pizzas are delivered
within 30 minutes, a feature that
he said Stanford students "look
forward to" because of the $3 dis
count awarded if a pizza is late.
