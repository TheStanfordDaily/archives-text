# Cardinal rugby strives to match tradition of national excellence
## 
### Mark Davies Staff writer 
When considering Stanford
dominance in the world of col
legiate sports, tennis, swimming
and baseball come quickly to
mind. What not too many people
realize, however, is that Stanford
rugby possesses a tradition second
to none.
Stanford rugby — not Cardinal
football — defeated the Golden
Bears in the first Big Game in
1906. Moreover, Stanford ruggers
spearheaded victories in the 1920
and 1924 Olympic Games, scoring
all the United States' tries
(touchdowns) in 1924.
In addition to winning four
Pacific Coast Collegiate Rugby
Championships between 1937 and
1951, Stanford captured seven na
tional titles during the 1960s at

the Monterey National Tourna
ment. To this day, Stanford has
won more national titles than any
other collegiate team.
The 1980s, however, witnessed
a struggling Cardinal rugby team,
as evidenced by five consecutive
losing seasons.
Responding to the belief that
the future of Stanford rugby was
in jeopardy, concerned alumni
created the Stanford Rugby Foun
dation, composed entirely of dona
tions from past Stanford ruggers.
"The very fact that at least one
Stanford rugger, from the class
of 1936 to the present, has given
to the Foundation attests to the
passion and concern felt for Stan
ford rugby and its tradition of
excellence," said senior John
McPherson, president of the team.
Along with the foundation came
a new coaching staff, including

Franck Boivert of France, inter
nationally known for his unique
approach to the game.
The Cardinal finished its 1988-
89 season ranked eighth in the
nation, its best finish in over a
decade. Although much of the suc
cess stems from the caliber of
coaching, the credit for the team's
achievement ultimately rests with
the players. "In the end, it is the
players who will restore Stanford
University as a leading power in
collegiate rugby," former Cardinal
rugger Rich Cortez said.
In addition to returning many
starters from last season's na
tional top-10 team, the Cardinal
boasts several All-American can
didates.
"So far the turnout in response
to preseason recruitment has been

very promising," McPherson said.
"We are proud of last year's ac
complishments and extremely en
thusiastic and confident about the
season ahead."
The Cardinal team plans to
travel to Tucson, Ariz., Nov. 2-4
for a preseason tournament as
well as to host the Stanford Ten
a-Sides Tournament Dec. 2.
An organizational meeting will
be held tonight at the Hall of
Fame Room in Encina Gym begin

ing at 8:30 p.m. The first practice
will be held at 3:30 p.m. Monday
at the lacrosse fields next to
Maples Pavilion.
"We have three teams for all
different levels," McPherson said.
"Even if you have never played,
we encourage you to come out
and give it a shot."

For the record

sports department incorrectly re
ported the winner of an intra
