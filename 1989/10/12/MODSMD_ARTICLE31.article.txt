## Sculpture At Stanford Touring the outdoor museum

ENTERTAINING WEEKLY

The "Gates of Hell"
are a lot closer to The
Farm than many
Stanford students
realize.

In fact, Rodin's
masterful 19th cen
tury bronze work is

part of the Universi
ty's world-class collec
tion of outdoor sculp-

tures. But, while Stan
ford's Rodins draw many
visitors to campus each year,

the University is also home to
major works by several other artists.

By actively trying to acquire more sculp
tures than any other American university,
Stanford has put together a collection that

offers members of the community a unique
opportunity to expose themselves to art.
"Stanford is the only university in the country
that has both a sculpture garden and a cam
puswide program of outdoor sculptures," said
Art History Prof. Albert Elsen, who has worked
to acquire sculptures for the University since
1969. "UCLA has a sculpture garden now, and
Princeton has a program of outdoor sculptures,
but we have both."
Sculpture has been an important element of
the campus aesthetic since 1891. But most of
the sculptures presently on campus have arrived
here in the last 25 years.
In the mid-19605, Francois Stahly, a French
sculptor and resident artist at Stanford, donated
two of his works to the University: "Les
Oiseaux Flammes" stands on the Business
School patio, while "La Licome" guards the
entrance to the Faculty Club.
Resident artist Amaldo Pomodoro doubled
the number of bronzes on campus in the late
1960s when he designed a facade for the art
building and then balanced his "Cube"
precariously in front of the art museum.
But Stanford didn't get all of its sculptures
by making the resident artists work like slaves.
A panel of faculty experts was set up to

search far and wide for
private foundations
eager to donate sculp
tures from their collec
tions to the University
or to provide the funds
necessary for Stanford
to acquire specific
sculptures.
The panel works out
the logistics of the deals
and then makes recom
mendations to the Uni-

versity president, who
makes the final decisions. It sounds simple,
right?
Well, so far it has been. With Elsen as a
driving force on the panel, the University has
built up the second largest and most important
collection of Rodin sculptures in the world,
second only to the Paris Rodin museum.
In addition to the works by Rodin that are
housed in the art museum, there are 20 Rodin
sculptures in a carefully designed garden adja
cent to the museum, and seven others closer
to the center of campus.
The Rodin sculpture garden was dedicated
in May 1985. It was designed to conform as
closely as possible to models for gardens in
which Rodin intended his works to be dis
played.
"There is no other sculpture garden like it
in the world," says Art Assoc. Prof. Richard
Randell, who chairs the president's Panel on
Outside Art.
In the past, the panel has gotten everything
it has wanted — or almost everything.
Three years ago, the University vied for a
memorial to victims of the Holocaust and
genocide that was to be built in the Oval. But
the prospective donors wanted the memorial
to be built on the mall in Washington, D.C.
Last year, Isamu Noguchi, the designer of the
memorial, passed away. The memorial was
never built.
Now, the panel is working to commission a
sculpture by John Roloff for the Rains apart
ments to complement the already impressive
array of major works by major modern artists
that are displayed all over campus.

George Segal's "Gay Liberation" rests in front
of the Varian Physics Laboratory.
The "Pillars of Hercules III" by Mimitri
Hadzi on the Oval side of the Business School
provides another overarching opportunity for
enthusiasts.
The "Albers Stanford Wall" designed by Josef
Albers and built by skilled craftsmen in front
of the Physics Tank provides a modern alter
native to the sculptural reliefs on the arches
of Memorial Church.
Bruce Beasley's "Vanguard" gathers the sun
light in front of Kresge Auditorium, threatening
to focus it and zap drowsy students as they
leave their Poli Sci 35 lectures.
When it isn't being used as a ramp by
skateboard punks, Alexander Calder's "The Fal
con" brings shape and style to the rigid archi
tecture of Crown Quadrangle. "The Falcon"
stood outside of Calder's studio until his death
and became a symbol of his work.
The "Song of the Vowels," which guards the
main entrance to the Medical Center, also
stands out as a symbol of the work of sculptor
Jacques Lipchitz.
In all, there are 22 major sculptures spread
out across the campus in addition to the Rodins
in the sculpture garden.

Though they are beautiful to
look at and admire, Elsen said
Stanford's outdoor collection is de
signed for instruction, not for
decoration.
"The purpose of the outdoor pro
gram is to get people used to living
with art," ne said.
After a stressful week of classes,
most people just want to get away
from campus on the weekends if
they can. But instead, take some
time and go on a walking tour of
the campus sculptures.
There are many special nooks
and crannies on campus waiting
to be discovered. Places you can
return to again and again to find
solace and peace. And the oppor
tunities to leam are endless.

Pick a beautiful day and take

(or a trenchcoat) to expose yourself
to art.
