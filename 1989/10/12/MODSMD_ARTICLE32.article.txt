# Vollenweider dazzles at Greek Theater
## 
### Todd Santos 
Since the late 1970s a little
known, soft-spoken European
musician has been quietly
enchanting a select hut growing
following of American listeners
with a style of music so unique
and irresistable that it must be
heard to be described.
The musician — Andreas Vol
lenweider of Switzerland — is ac
companied by a host of other exotic
and bizarre instruments as he
strums a spine-tingling "electra
coustic" harp.
A short figure squatting behind
a mythical looking harp, Vollen
weider conducts a dreamy sym
phony of instruments, audio
effects and voices so unfamiliar
but intriguing to the American ear

that he won last year's Grammy
for "Best New Age Artist," the first
award of its kind ever given.
Vollenweider proved that he
more than deserved this award last
Friday night in a spell-binding stop
at Berkeley's Greek Theater. Fri
day's concert, spurred by the recent
release of his new album, "Danc
ing with the Lion," was the fifth
stop on Vollenwcider's first world
tour in three years.
In an exclusive interview with
The Daily before the concert, Vol
lenweider revealed some of what
makes him such an unusual, yet
compelling performer.
Born into a large family of
musicians, painters and actors in
Zurich, Switzerland, Vollenweider
describes his road to becoming a
musician as an incredible child

hood environment in which he was
"completely free — free and at
play."
He says that his parents encour
aged him to explore his creativity
and interests without traditional
bounds. And about school, Vollen
weider laughs, "I tried to stay away
from school as much as possible."
He says that formal training may
have made him a different and
probably less individualistic artist
than he is today. He is quick to
add that he is raising his two young
children the same way, so that
they too will be completely "free
to connect to the outside world —
to anything."
Vollcnweider avoids strict limits
of all kinds — including the limit
ing definition that people often im
pose on his music. Despite the joy

and honor he felt at winning the
Grammy for "Best New Age" artist,
he says that the term "New Age"
has no meaning for him and he
is uncomfortable with the label.
Despite the common belief that
much of his music comes from
Caribbean, East Asian, Indian and
Mediterranean sources, Vollen
weider says the ethnic imagery his
music evokes is due to the instru
ments he chooses.
Vollenweider looks forward to
his future as a performer, explain
ing that his music reflects the per
sonal and spiritual expansion that
he is experiencing every day. He
praises the new, multi-talented
band members and the fresh mu
sical ideas they have brought to
the tour.
