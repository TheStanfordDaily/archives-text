# Aim real high: Get your license and intelligence from the CIA
## 
### 
I checked out the Career Faire last
Friday and decided that a military career
is definitely where it's at. Preferably with
the CIA.lt was the first booth I visited.
"Hi," I said to the recruiter at the CIA
booth, stepping over several Fro Pros
,(,Frosh Protesters). "Can I get my license
to kill here?"
"Sure," he said. "Just fill out this form
and we'll have your license for you in a
jiffy. And you '11 need to take an eye test
— here, pick up this gun and see if you
can hit that protester in the neck."
KABOOOOOMH
"Nice shot! Here's your license. The
organ donor card is on the back, and
you do have a restriction on nighttime
covert activity
Ha ha ha. Of course, I'm kidding about
all this. As you and 1 know, the CIA is
definitely NOT a military organization,
but rather an "intelligence gathering" or
ganization. To this point they've gathered
most of the intelligence in the Pentagon
and they won't give it back.
The real military recruiters were at
the Career Faire, anyway, bringing their
slogans with them. You know: The Army
("Be All That You Can Be"); The Air
Force ("Aim High"); The Marines ("Aim
At The Vital Organs"). They had glossy
brochures that described in detail the

fabulous careers available in the military,
while conveniently skipping the part
about basic training.
Basic training, you see, is really the
whole problem with our military. If
you've watched any war movies lately
you know that the two most important
skills learned in basic training are (1)
standing at attention, and (2) making the
bed.
Now I don't have anything AGAINST
being able to make the bed. In fact, all
things considered, it's probably more
strategically important than being able
to do laundry. But for my money, our
soldiers would be better off learning how
to operate their weapons.
You see it time and time again in Viet
nam movies: the American soldiers, fresh
from six weeks of basic training, sneak
through the jungles on a raid into an
enemy camp, only to be cruelly ambushed
and massacred while making the beds
belonging to the Viet Cong.
But anyway, if I were going to join the
military I would definitely choose the Air
Force, because I think I could offer some
thing in terms of choosing a new color
scheme for the "Stealth" bomber. I mean,
black is just SO gauche. Slap a little
pastel on that baby and Congress would
be appropriating money left and right to

build more of 'em.
Money has always been a problem with
the Stealth bomber (known in military
terminology as the "B-2" or
"Riboflavin"). It is by far the most ex
pensive plane ever built by the military.
To put its cost into perspective, the $530
million spent on each aircraft is just
slightly more than Jose Canseco's yearly
salary. Although to be fair, Canseco has
proven unable to elude enemy radar.
The cost of the plane breaks down as
follows:
• Design and engineering — $5 million
• Parts and labor — $8 million
• Extended 5 year/50,000 mile protec
tion plan — $6 million
• "Batman" licensing fees — $509 mil
lion.
So as you can see, building the Stealth
was a costly operation. However, many
people feel its unique design is so strategi
cally important that money is no object.
Of course it isn't THEIR money. If the
people who actually make up the mili
tary's budget had to shell out their OWN
bucks for projects like this, we'd have a
Stealth Toyota.
Strategically speaking, the design of
the Stealth is important because the
aircraft cannot be detected by conven
tional radar. This makes it possible for

the airplane to sneak, undetected, into
Soviet airspace, very similar to how
commercial airliners are often able to
sneak, undetected, into mtyor American
airports while air-traffic controllers play
Nintendo on "those green screens with
all the cute little blips."
Sneaking into the Soviet airspace is
extremely important, strategywise, be
cause it allows us to blow the Soviets up
without them knowing who did it. This
could be good for big laughs in the White
House.
GORBACHEV (on phone): Comrade
Bush, did you American pigs just blow
up Moscow?

BUSH: Of course not fsound of snick
ering in the background). You're Russian
to false conclusions (huge giggles). It
must have been the Swiss.
Understanding how the Stealth works
requires a basic knowledge of how radar
operates. Basically, a radar system oper
ates hy projecting waves of energy from
a fixed transmitter on the ground toward
a moving object in the sky
These waves are then reflected off of
the object and returned to earth, where
they are received by whales. The whales
then relay the size and shape of the object
to marine biologists using a system of
clicks and whistles (known in scientific
terminology as "clicks" and "whistles"),
after which the marine biologists tele
phone the radar station to say something
to the effect that, "Shamu and Namu
are picking up an SS-20 missile heading
thisaway."
The Stealth is almost impossible to
pick up on radar because its unique shape
does not reflect radar waves. And the
cloaking device the military bought from
the Romulans is quite effective.
