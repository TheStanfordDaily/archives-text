Roble ragtime rage
Dust off your dancing shoes, flapper dresses and zoot suits and
turkey trot on over to Roble Gym this Saturday night for the
Ragtime and Roaring 20's Ball. The best part is, you don't even
have to know how to dance. Stan Isaacs, a favorite Bay Area
instructor, will teach easy-to-learn versions of the Castle Walk,
Turkey Trot and Charleston, among other 20's favorites. From 9
p.m. to midnight, the 12-piece Paul Price Society Orchestra will
blast dance tunes from the era. Stanford Dance faculty member
Gail Barton and her students will also perform special dance turns
during the evening. Student tickets are an incredibly reasonable
$7 at the door, and all proceeds will benefit the Stanford Dance
Division Scholarship Fund. For further information or tickets, call
856-8044.
Storm hits Saturday
"Storm Reading," a play written and performed by Neil Marcus,
will be presented this Saturday evening by the Lively Arts. A
Berkeley resident, Marcus is afflicted with dystonic musculorum
deformans, a physically crippling neurological disorder. Marcus
performs with his brother, Roger, and actress Kathryn Voice, who
translates "Storm Reading" into American Sign Language. The
three are members of Access Theater, a Santa Barbara-based
touring organization that specializes in presenting the talents of
differently abled performers. Tickets are $13 and $16, not including
a $3 student discount. Half-price rush tickets should be available
15 minutes before the performance, which will be at 8 p.m. in
Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
