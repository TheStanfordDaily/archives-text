# Selleck does 'Innocent Man'
## 
### Jason Moore 
Any film that opens like an
American Airlines commercial
is bound to be unoriginal.
For the most part, the plot
follows the notion that the ob
vious works best. By the end of
the first ten minutes all but the
most stoned moviegoers can
guess every remaining scene.
Case in point: Jimmie Rain
wood (Tom Selleck) is framed
by dirty cops. Jimmie goes to
prison. He "does a brother" to
avoid becoming his "wife"; he
is "put in the hole"; and he
finally becomes a "stand-up
dude." Last, but certainly not
least, Jimmie sets up the cops
who busted him.
One of the only original ideas
in "An Innocent Man" is casting
Tom Selleck as a jailhouse boy
toy.
Written by Larry Brothers, the
script overflows with enough
street talk to supply a whole
season of "Miami Vice." And it
seems ironic that Oscar

winning F. Murray Abraham,
who plays convict Virgil Cane,
speaks most of it.
Underneath this street talk,
however, lies a distinct three
part framework that makes this
film somewhat literary.
To Selleck's credit, his
portrayal of Jimmie Rainwood
represents a departure from the
security of his Magnum, P.I.
persona.
In the end you cannot help
but like his character, or at least
feel sony for him.
Director Peter Yates provides
"An Innocent Man" with a grim
visual style that does not call
attention to itself. The down
side is that he tends to drop
story lines with minimal expla
nation, and he does not do a
convincing job showing the pas
sage of three years, the supposed
time span of the film.
More than anything else, "An
Innocent Man" plays on our
worst nightmares. This, in and
of itself, is not bad — Alfred
Hitchcock's greatest films

cleverly manipulate our fears.
Yet, in this age of calls for
tougher criminal sentencing,
public outrage against drug
crimes and government efforts
to weaken our Constitutional
rights, the scenario in "An In
nocent Man," although simplis
tic, hits too close to home.
