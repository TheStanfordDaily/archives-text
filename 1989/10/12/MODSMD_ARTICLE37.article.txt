# Burt, Ernie reunite for film

Burt's at it again. Yes, Burt
Reynolds is starring in yet another
movie. But this time he's actually
acting.
In "Breaking In,"the latest work
to appear on the silver screen by
John Sayles, who also wrote the
screenplays to "Return of the
Secaucus Seven" and "Eight Men
Out," Reynolds plays Ernie, an
aging safe cracker in the not-so
hustle-and-bustle town of
Portland, Oregon.
After such cinemagraphic mas
terpieces as "Smokey And The
Bandit" and"The Cannonball
Run," Reynolds actually develops
a character beyond his silly ol' self.
Also for the first time, he takes
on a role of a character noticeably
older than his own actual age.
Reynolds does a surprisingly good
job of creating Ernie, although the
limp in his walk is somewhat less
than believable.
Anyway, one night while Ernie
is doing a job, he is surprised by
Mike (Casey Siemaszko from
"Young Guns"), who also happens

taining introduction,

young newcomer.

to have broken into the same
house that night, and a strange
partnership is born. Ernie does it
for money (preferably $20s and
$50s); Mike does it for kicks (free
food and short-sheeting beds).
Ernie thinks the kid is "wacko"
but senses some potential, so he
offers Mike a cut of the take, saying
he'd rather have an accomplice
than a witness. From then on,
Mike accompanies him on his
jobs.
After the fairly entertaining in
troduction, the plot develops into

a fairly predictable story about an
aging criminal teaching his dying
trade to a young newcomer, with
the usual ups and downs of friend
ship.
One of the many ups and downs
associated with this friendship oc
curs when Ernie introduces Mike
to Delphine and Carrie, two
women perfectly suited for the
night. Mike is shocked to learn
that Carrie is a hooker, who, like
himself, is learning the trade from
an old pro, Delphine.
Luckily, Sayles doesn't take the
Mike-Carrie affair too far. They
merely spend some quality time
together, and she causes some fric
tion between Mike and Ernie. Her
presence in the film is an example
of how Sayles includes subplots in
his screenplays that also explore
the same theme as the primary
action. In this movie, Sayles ex
plores the realm of those who live
in the other half of the city â€” the
half that is just outside the law.
Though the film offers few
surprises, Sayles' sometimes witty
dialogue and original ending
prevents the movie from being a
bore or a disappointment.
