# 'Gringo' star lacks substance

### Brad Bruner 
In "Old Gringo," the new pro
duction from FONDA films, a
spinsterly 19th-century teacher,
Harriet Winslow — played by Jane
Fonda — sets out to escape her
predictable life by accepting a
teaching position on the Mexican
frontier.
Harriet arrives in Chihuaha,
Mexico, just in time for a New
Year's celebration and an ambush.
For the habitually prim Harriet,
seeing a man shot in the head and
another slashed in the throat —
close enough that her white prairie
dress gets blood-stained — comes
as a shock.
She handles it, however, in the
same valiant way that all of
Fonda's characters do. Anyway,
she has other, more important
things on her mind than politics,
such as attention from an Old
Gringo, played by Gregory Peck,
and a young general, played by

fresh-from-"L.A. Law" Jimmy
Smits.
As she settles into the hacienda
lifestyle, Harriet befriends several
local women, including a jovial,
self-proclaimed whore, played by
Gabriella Roel.
Their friendship proves to be one
of the most interesting substories
of the film.
Although Fonda obviously per
ceived some political and social
relevance in Carlos Fuentes' novel
"Gringo Viejo" before she sat down
to adapt it to the screen, this movie
is still a self-serving vehicle.
The strong-spined Harriet is a
typical Jane Fonda type — strong,
adventurous and out to see that
change is made. It's unfortunate,
though, that Harriet is only con
cerned with her own life, and,
when the opportunity arises, find
ing a good man.
In the midst of the Mexican
revolution, it seems that a charac
ter such as Harriet should find a

larger scope than this. As "Old
Gringo" is, however, Fonda's Har
riet rarely seems more than one
dimensional.
Peck, on the other hand, is right
on target as the old American
searching the mesas of Mexico for
a different sort of success than he
had achieved back at home. Peck
is throaty, ponderous and utterly
believable.
Although "Gringo" is obviously
intended to be an epic of three
individuals tangled up in the messy
underbrush of the Mexican Revo
lution, it unfortunately emerges as
little more than a showcase tor its
star performers.
Though its wide-shot, fast
cinematography performs every
camera trick possible to give "Old
Gringo" a big, bold look, its utter
lack of suspense, and its lack of
a meaningful, unified scries of
events makes this film only pas
sively interesting.
