# Stale Bread, wilted Roses at Cal
## 
### Mark Pinkus Staff writer 
It was hot this Sunday at the
Greek Theatre in Berkeley. This,
however, is a reference to the heat,
and not the all-acoustic benefit
concert for the Bread & Roses or
ganization.
What had the makings of a great
day of music turned out to be a
sweatbath filled with more let
downs that highlights. The positive
side of it all, however, was that
all the money raised went to a
good cause.
Bread & Roses, a Marin-based,
non-profit organization, performs
over 500 free shows per year at
institutions ranging from
children's hospitals to prisons. In
its 15 years of existence, Bread &
Roses has featured major acts like
Jackson Browne and Robin Wil
liams, who have offered their tal
ents free of charge to the charity.
Executive director Mimi Farina
has neared bankruptcy more than
once — but with benefit concerts,
she remains just in the black.
The eight-act afternoon, spon
sored by Ben & Jerry's ice cream,
began promptly at 1 p.m. with the
Edloes, a four-person a capella
group.

For some reason, however, all
vocal groups such as these feel no
one will listen to their singing if
they aren't funny. The Edloes
should stick to singing — they're
much better in that arena.
And no one managed to shake
loose the mediocre note that
opened the concert. Kris Kristof
ferson, flanked by a run-of-the-mill
set, offered only two highlights —
a moving version of "They Killed
Him," written for Bob Dylan in
1986, and "Me and Bobby McGee,"
Kristofferson's first-ever hit.
The best part of the show was
the unplanned, but expected, arri
val of Farina's older sister, Joan
Baez Her three-song set was a def
inite teaser for this Sunday's show
at Frost Amphitheater.
The a capella version of "China,"
a track from her soon-to-be
released album, set the example
for how good an acoustic show
could be. The lyrics were mean
ingful, the vocals clear and sharp,
and the emotion in the song dug
deep into the audience.
After uninspiring sets by Jennifer
Warnes and Mickey Newbury, the
pressure lay on Graham Nash and
David Crosby to turn the show
around.
Even though they had to charter

their own plane from Washington,
where their original flight had been
delayed, the duo was in good
spirits. Free jokes about Crosby's
past experiences with drugs and
jail and constant mockery of
Nash's British accent forced the
musical performance into the back
seat.
Although the harmonies were
sweet, the only real intensity from
the set came when Nash left the
stage while Crosby performed "Al
most Cut My Hair."
The show was set to end at 6
p.m., in observance with the
Jewish holiday, Yom Kippur. When
6 p.m. rolled around before Bonnie
Raitt had a chance to perform, em
cee Herman Hesseman, star of the
television series "Head of the
Class," apologized for their failure
to stay on schedule. He said he
understood if some people had to
leave early.
More than half the crowd
breathed a sigh of relief as they
ducked out of the hot sun and
headed-home. No one may have
left disappointed, but no one
seemed overjoyed. They probably
realized that beside helping a good
cause, they touched up their fading
summer tans.
