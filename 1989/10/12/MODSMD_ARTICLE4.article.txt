# New paper rules?
## Fac Sen reviewing collaboration 
### Paul Owens 
In the aftermath of errors that
undermined 11 Stanford research
papers, the Faculty Senate today
will consider research guildelines
that may have far-reaching impli
cations nationwide.
The guidelines, which were de
veloped by the Senate's Commit
tee on Research, address the
question of who is responsible for
the content of a paper that may
contain error or fraud when a
group of researchers from several
disciplines collaborates.
The guidelines codify the prin
ciple that all authors who contrib
ute to a project or paper share
responsibility for the results, but
the guidelines are not intended to
settle the question of blame in
the event of error or fraud.
"The guidelines are suggestions
for researchers in collaboration to
help avoid misunderstandings,"
said committee member Peter
Galison, a history of science pro
fessor.
Research institutions from all
over the country are expected to
pay close attention to Stanford's
handling of the issue, and some
may follow suit with similar
guidelines.
This issue is arising more fre
quently as various branches of sci
ence become more and more
specialized, and collaboration is
essential. Rockefeller University
has recently been embroiled in
controversy over the nomination
of David Baltimore as its presi
dent. Baltimore, a Nobel laureate,
has come under scrutiny because
a colleague who co-authored a re
search paper with him may have
committed fraud.
Members of the research com
munity at Stanford have been
openly debating the collaboration
question ever since the University
announced last year that 11 col
laborative papers published by

University researchers would
have to be either clarified, cor
rected or withdrawn.
An audit found that each of the
papers — jointly prepared by
clinicians at the Mental Health
Clinical Research Center and bioc
hemists from the Psychiatry De
partment — were compromised by
data irregularities.
Following the audit, Medical
School Dean David Korn directed
a committee to investigate. The
committee, made up of faculty
from the medical school, did not
pinpoint blame for the errors. In
stead, it concluded that "all of the
authors of a given paper are re
sponsible for all of the material
that appears in that paper."
Psychiatry Prof. Jack Barchas,
a co-author of several of the
papers, criticized that conclusion
as "an effort to place blame across
a wide spectrum of faculty mem
bers, because the investigation
was inadequate to reconstruct
precisely what happened."
In a statement issued shortly
after the committee's findings
were made public, Barchas
pointed out that the work he had
contributed to the papers was
"correct and appropriate." He also
detailed and defended the efforts
he had made to keep informed of
the work of his collaborators.
This past May, the National In
stitute of Mental Health, which
had been conducting its own in
vestigation of the incident, attrib
uted the errors to two researchers
at the mental health center,
former director David Berger and
researcher Steven Stahl. Berger
and Stahl are no longer at Stan
ford.
The co-chair of the Institute's
investigating panel said, "I do not
think it is realistic to expect that
any of the other authors would
necessarily be able to identify
