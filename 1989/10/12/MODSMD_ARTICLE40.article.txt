# Baez to melt Frost on Sunday
## 
### Mark Pinkus Staff writer 
"I'm a fighter/' says loan Baez,
from a shady seat on the Coffee
House patio. "I've always been a
fighter. I just use different tools
from the conventional arma
ments."
Baez, a folk-singing phenome
non for the last 30 years, will bring
her most potent weapon — her
voice — to Frost Amphitheater this
Sunday afternoon.
While most veterans openly
curse the discomfort of "life on the
road," the still-beautiful 48-year
old couldn't be more excited about
her brand-new tour.
"For the first time in my life,
I'm looking forward to packing my
suitcases and going on tour," she
said, "I had, for many, many years,
too much stagefright to enjoy
myself."
Much of her excitement centers
around her new album, "Speaking
of Dreams," which includes three
original tracks.
Once labeled a mere "in
terpreter" of other people's songs,
Baez has blossomed into a top
songwriter.
The album's first track, "China,"
stands alone as one of the most
politically aware and powerful
songs of the decade. "China" was
inspired by the personal accounts
of witnesses to last June's Beijing
massacres.
In contrast to "China" is the
non-political "Speaking of
Dreams." Baez says of this touch
ing track, "That song is very ro
mantic. I wouldn't attach any
other significance to it except for
a massive crush."
Baez will perform these two
songs, along with a blend of old
and new material, throughout the
tour.
Baez values the contact with
others that she makes while on
the road. "Meeting people is a nice
process of breaking down the wall
between 'I'm just a regular person
and you're a star' — something

which is all baloney," she says.
And it's regular people that Baez
cares most about. This Sunday's
show will benefit Humanitas.
"It would be nice to be remem
bered as something more current
than the girl with the bare feet and
the long hair . . . which is how
masses of people will end up
remembering me."
So this Sunday come out and
hear just how relevant she is after
30 years in the business. And

when she sings her classic
"Diamonds and Rust," it will be
impossible not to think of her as
a rare gem among so many useless
trinkets.

loan Baez will perform in Frost
Amphitheater this Sunday at 2
p.m. Tickets, which are available
at Tresidder Ticket Office, cost $45
for priority seating and a back stage
pass to meet Baez after the show,
or $18.50 general admission.
