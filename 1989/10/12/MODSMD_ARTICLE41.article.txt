# The 						new Tears for Fears album sows seeds of disappointment
## 
### John Louie Staff writer 
Tears for Fears has some nerve.
It has been four years since "Songs from
the Big Chair," the vapid album that
charted two consecutive number-one
singles with "Everybody Wants to Rule
the World" and "Shout."
True Tears for Fears fans, hooked by
the group's debut album, "The Hurting,"
have waited for six years for the emotional,
soul-wrenching material that was disap
pointingly absent from "Songs from the
Big Chair."
With their new album, "The Seeds of
Love," Tears for Fears attempts to arise
from hibernation and once again take the

music world by storm.
The first single, "Sowing the Seeds of
Love," shows deceiving promise. Granted,
the song sounds uncannily like the Beatles'
"I Am the Walrus." But Roland Orzabal's
vocals and Curt Smith's reverberating
backgrounds intertwine so well with the
dreamlike synthesizers that one can't help
but be captivated.
Perhaps more surprisingly, the depth of
the lyrics of "Sowing the Seeds of Love"
show a marked improvement from the
widely criticized, banal chorus of "Shout."
The atmosphere of "Sowing the Seeds
of Love" carries over into the next track,
"Advice for the Young at Heart," which
seems to complement its predecessor.

The music and vocals compensate
somewhat for the shallow lyrics. Yet Tears
for Fears' musical talent cannot always
be used as a crutch. The aptly named
"Badman's Song," one of the album's
worst tracks, best exemplifies this.
The song's pathetic display of jazzy,
improvisational solos creates such cacop
hony that one wondeis if all of the
musicians were in the samerownvUtiring
the recording session.
Tears for Fears even ventures into the
realm of politics, with criticisms like
"Politician Grannie with your high ideals
/ Have you no idea how the Majority
feels?" The melodies, harmonies, voices
and lyrics all flow together to create a

catchy, enjoyable single with "Sowing the
Seeds of Love."
However, the remainder of the album
is riddled with the same faults that plagued
"Songs from the Big Chair."
In "Famous Last Words," trite phrases
like "When the saints go marching in,"
unsuccessfully supported by piano back
grounds, are clumsy and awkward. Al
though the album's recurring theme —
criticism of the present combined with
optimism about the future — is both in
sightful and important, the scattered
cliches detract from each track's individual
messages.
It's a pity, too, because "The Seeds of

Love" shows that Tears for Fears really
has something to say The album criticizes
problems of today's society, such as ram
pant violence ("Swords and Knives") and
exploitation of lesser-developed countries.
And sometimes the formula works. In
"Woman in Chains," a song about the
subjugation of women throughout history,
the music and lyrics mesh perfectly. With
lyrics like "Well I feel deep in your heart
there are wounds time can't heal / And I
feel somebody somewhere is trying to
breathe," the track flows and stings at the
same time.
Three impressive tracks out of eight
isn't all that bad of a ratio. But after
waiting four years, I just expected more.
