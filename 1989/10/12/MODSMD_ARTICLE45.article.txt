# You won't hear this on the radio
## 
### Steve Lippman Staff writer 
Tired of hearing nothing but
"Fine Young Guns N' Cannibals
with Neenah Cherry" every time
you turn on the radio? Besides the
usual categories of metal, post
modern, classic rock and all the
rest, music can be broken down
into two very simple categories —
stuff you hear on the radio and
stuff you don't.
Youssou N'Dour's latest album,
"The Lion," falls into this second
category, but just because it hasn't
been getting airplay doesn't mean
it isn't worth listening to.
But that's probably not surpris
ing to those of you who had to
drive out to Stanford through
stretches of radio wasteland where
all you could pick up was Cassey
Cassum's "American Top 40."
Youssou N'Dour comes from
Senegal and both his lyrics and his
music reflect a carerul blend of
traditional African sounds and
Western rock influences.
N'Dour performed with the Am
nesty International tour, and he
thanks his friend Peter Gabriel in

the album's liner notes for "being
the biggest promoter of music
without frontiers." Among the
album's strongest tracks is
"Shakin' the Tree," a duet N'Dour
sings with Gabriel. For those Peter
Gabriel fans going into withdrawal
awaiting the release of another al
bum from him, it is worth buying
the album just for this song, which
could easily compare with the best
tracks on "So."
But after you listen to "Shakin 7
the Tree" about three times in a
row (which is what I did), listen
to the other eight tracks on the
album. They prove that Youssou
N'Dour is an extremely talented
musician in his own right, whose
talent may well rival that of his
better-known friend, Peter Gabriel.
The songs on the album com
bine an incredible assortment of
percussion instruments, horns,
guitars and synth for a style that
is a lot more fun to listen to than
it is to try to characterize.
The music is complex but very
crisp and clear, and it sounds great
played loudly off a compact disc.
N'Dour has a wide vocal range
and his smooth voice draws you

into the lyrics, which deal with
everything from trust and the spir
itual destiny to the National Soccer
Team of Senegal.
In general the songs tend to be
upbeat and even somewhat "pop
ish," especially the album's title
track "The Lion/Gaiende." How
ever other songs, notably "Macoy,"
feature slow, soulful lyrics.
Indeed, the best part of the songs
can often be found in the combi
nation of percussion instruments
being played subtly in the back
ground.
N'Dour does most of his singing
in his native tongue of Senegal.
Some listeners may have trouble
getting into songs which for the
most part are not sung in English,
but N'Dour's voice is engaging and
expressive enough to transcend
this language barrier.
I found all the tracks holding
my interest. Perhaps in a few years
it will be Peter Gabriel who is
thanking Youssou N'Dour for
"being the biggest promoter of
music without frontiers." In the
meantime, Youssou N'dour is a
pleasant antidote to prolonged ex
posure to the radio.
