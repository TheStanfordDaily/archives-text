# Eating Greek on El Camino
## 
### Alex Hoye 
Seeing the maitre d' smartly
attired in his black tuxedo at the
posh entrance of the Acorn, we
feared a stifling evening in a
snobby, claustrophobically quiet
restaurant.
Our fears were instantly al
layed when Adrian, the maitre
d', flashed a warm smile and
asked in a charming Greek ac
cent how he could help us.
The dining is anything but sti
fling at this restaurant specializ
ing in Mediterranean cuisine.
Dining tables are placed in com
fortably decorated, sectioned-off
rooms. A fireplace — unlit, of
course — sat at the end of our
dining section, adorned with
various decorations that provided

both a Mediterranean and
homelike accent to the meal.
The staff is definitely formal
— but never stuffy.
Even better than the staff or
the charming atmosphere at The
Acorn is the incredible food.
The diverse menu offers every
thing from basics — like New
York steak and jumbo prawns
— to the restaurant's Mediter
ranean specialties.
Among the latter are great
Greek dishes like dolmades —
stuffed grape leaves with ground
sirloin and rice — and broiled
Athenian rack of lamb.
For starters, my recommenda
tion is the Mediterranean an
tipasto appetizer for two. This
spread provides a whole array of
customary appetizers from the

region, like tyropitas and feta
cheese.
For the main course, the veal
marsala was the best ever to melt
in my mouth.
The only drawback to this su
perb dining adventure is the
slightly-above-modest price tag
accompanying the meal.
With the special combination
of comfort and class, accompa
nied by superb cuisine, the Acorn
provides something that should
not be overlooked. Try it for your
next formal, parental visit or ex
travagant escape from campus
cuisine.

Open for lunch and dinner, The
Acorn is located on El Camino
Real, just as you enter Atherton.
