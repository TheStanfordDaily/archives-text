Editor's note: This is the third
article in a four-part series on
the experiences of individuals
with disabilities at Stanford.

Five years ago, Donna
Webster was fighting for her
life. After learning at age 16
that she had multiple sclerosis,

She required a tracheotomy
to breathe and spent nine
months in a hospital, six of them
in an intensive care unit in cri

Today, the Stanford junior is
in remission from her disease.
After spending four years in a
wheelchair, Webster is even able
to walk with the aid of crutches.
Unfortunately, it is impossible
to determine the permanency of
the remission.
Mutiple sclerosis is a disease
that affects the central nervous
system and, consequently, al
most every system of the body.
The cause is unknown, but
symptoms result from a
degeneration of the nerve
sheaths of the brain and spinal
cord. Symptoms often disappear
and return, sometimes after a
remission of several years.
"I might be great for the rest
of my life, or 1 may be the worst
ever next week," Webster says.
But Webster doesn't let this
uncertainty interfere with her
current life or future plans,
which include medical school.
"Having been a patient for so
long, I know what it's like," she

says."I know what kind of doc
tor I do, and do not, want to be."
She is also considering re
search and is currently working
at a local lab doing research on
multiple sclerosis.
"I love it. It's so great to think
that maybe someday I can have

a part in solving some of the
puzzles about M.5.," Webster
says."I want to be involved in
a dynamic phase of research."
She found this job after being
turned down for a position at
