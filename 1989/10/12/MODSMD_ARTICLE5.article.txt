# Student with MS to work for cure
## 
### Janine De Fao Staff writer 
Editor's note: This is the third
article in a four-part series on
the experiences of individuals
with disabilities at Stanford.

Five years ago, Donna
Webster was fighting for her
life. After learning at age 16
that she had multiple sclerosis,
Webster watched her body be
come paralyzed.

DISABLED
AT STANFORD

She required a tracheotomy
to breathe and spent nine
months in a hospital, six of them
in an intensive care unit in cri
tical condition.
Today, the Stanford junior is
in remission from her disease.
After spending four years in a
wheelchair, Webster is even able
to walk with the aid of crutches.
Unfortunately, it is impossible
to determine the permanency of
the remission.
Mutiple sclerosis is a disease
that affects the central nervous
system and, consequently, al
most every system of the body.
The cause is unknown, but
symptoms result from a
degeneration of the nerve
sheaths of the brain and spinal
cord. Symptoms often disappear
and return, sometimes after a
remission of several years.
"I might be great for the rest
of my life, or 1 may be the worst
ever next week," Webster says.
But Webster doesn't let this
uncertainty interfere with her
current life or future plans,
which include medical school.
"Having been a patient for so
long, I know what it's like," she

says."I know what kind of doc
tor I do, and do not, want to be."
She is also considering re
search and is currently working
at a local lab doing research on
multiple sclerosis.
"I love it. It's so great to think
that maybe someday I can have

a part in solving some of the
puzzles about M.5.," Webster
says."I want to be involved in
a dynamic phase of research."
She found this job after being
turned down for a position at

lab and plans to become a doctor.
the School of Medicine.
"I went in (for an interview)
and it really looked like [the med
ical school] was going to hire me.
The woman asked me to come
back the next day. But when I
arrived she said 'I'm sorry, but
I've discussed it with some other
people and physically we don't
think you'd be able to do this
job.' "
Webster disagreed.
"I think when someone says
that I can't do something, it spurs
me on to think that I can. I'd like
to let that lady [at the Medical
School! see the job I have now,"
she says.
Her experience at the Medical
School is not the only discrimina
tion Webster says she has expe
rienced at Stanford. Last year she
hoped to be a resident assistant
in Storey House, where she cur
rently lives.
"I was told that I couldn't be
an RA on the Row because I
couldn't get up the stairs if there
was an emergency. But I know
that there was a quadriplegic RA
here (in Storey House) a couple
years ago," she says.
"I think it's backward that RAs
are put upstairs anyway," she
adds, explaining that a student in
a wheelchair could not reach the
RA if he or she needed to.
But Webster is not one to get
discouraged and give up easily.
"I think I can do anything. I
didn't think that I'd graduate
from high school, and I didn't
think I'd be here, but I am," she
says.
After a nine-month stay in the
hospital during her junior year of
high school, she had to return to
school. In addition to being in a
wheelchair, she had lost all her
hair in experimental chemother
apy treatments.

"I came back to high school in
a wheelchair and with no hair.
No one in homeroom would look
at me. I wondered if they even
knew who I was."
Being the first person confined
to a wheelchair in her high school
was intimidating, she remembers.
"At first I was really timid. I
was always afraid of running over
people's toes in the hallways. Fi
nally, though, I stood up for
myself. Even though I couldn't do
it physically, I stood up for my
rights," she says.
When Webster became sick
again, this time with pneumonia,
she decided not to go back to high
school. Once recovered, she man
aged to convince officials at a com
munity college near her home in
Atlanta to let her complete her
high school degree by taking col
lege classes.
She applied as a transfer to
Stanford and was granted admis
sion to enter last fall. Once again,
her plans were delayed because
of her illness, and she started
classes in January.
"On my application, I wrote
about all the philosophic, philan
thropic and educational reasons
to come to Stanford," Webster
says."And then I added that I
wanted to come because it was
flat and there was no snow."
Webster says the topography
and weather were major draws to
someone who needed a wheelchair
to get around campus because
hills, snow and ice are dangerous.
Webster still encounters diffi
culties on campus.
"There are places on campus
that I have never seen and prob
ably never will see, because of
accessibility. Even if there are
ramps and curb cuts, you some
times have to go such a distance
to get to them that it's a waste
of energy. Sometimes you just
don't want to bother," she says.
But often, Webster does want
to bother. "If you really want to
participate, you figure out a way

1 think when some
one says that I can't
do something, it
spurs me on to think
that I can.'

— like having people lift you up
the stairs," she says.
Although her wheelchair is
sometimes limiting, Webster says
she is thankful that she has it.
"I think wheelchairs are great.
Years ago, people would just have
to lie in bed.
"After nine months of being
confined to a hospital bed, the
day I got my wheelchair was a
day of victory because I had the
freedom to move around," she
says.
Now, after much physical
therapy, Webster is able to walk
again. She still must use her
wheelchair to travel long dis
tances but can walk in her house
with the support of crutches or a
wall.
In addition to learning to walk
again, Webster, who played both
piano and horn competitively in
high school, has had to relearn
both instruments.
"After I was sick and had a
tracheotomy, I couldn't play for
two years. Then it was like learn
ing all over again," Webster says.
"Some of my ability has been com
promised because my lung
capacity is lower and I've lost
some muscle control."
Yet, Webster currently plays
with both the Stanford Symphony
and Alea, a new music ensemble.
Although she admittedly has a
disability, Webster does not like
the sound of the word.
"I don't like the term 'disabled,'
but I don't have a better one. I
hate 'physically challenged' and
the cutesy 'handi-capable,' " she
says. "We're people. We're crea
tive and adaptable."

the School of Medicine.
"I went in (for an interview)
and it really looked like [the med
ical school] was going to hire me.
The woman asked me to come
back the next day. But when I
arrived she said 'I'm sorry, but
I've discussed it with some other
people and physically we don't
think you'd be able to do this
job.' "
Webster disagreed.
"I think when someone says
that I can't do something, it spurs
me on to think that I can. I'd like
to let that lady [at the Medical
School! see the job I have now,"
she says.
Her experience at the Medical
School is not the only discrimina
tion Webster says she has expe
rienced at Stanford. Last year she
hoped to be a resident assistant
in Storey House, where she cur
rently lives.
"I was told that I couldn't be
an RA on the Row because I
couldn't get up the stairs if there
was an emergency. But I know
that there was a quadriplegic RA
here (in Storey House) a couple
years ago," she says.
"I think it's backward that RAs
are put upstairs anyway," she
adds, explaining that a student in
a wheelchair could not reach the
RA if he or she needed to.
But Webster is not one to get
discouraged and give up easily.
"I think I can do anything. I
didn't think that I'd graduate
from high school, and I didn't
think I'd be here, but I am," she
says.
After a nine-month stay in the
hospital during her junior year of
high school, she had to return to
school. In addition to being in a
wheelchair, she had lost all her
hair in experimental chemother
apy treatments.

"I came back to high school in
a wheelchair and with no hair.
No one in homeroom would look
at me. I wondered if they even
knew who I was."
Being the first person confined
to a wheelchair in her high school
was intimidating, she remembers.
"At first I was really timid. I
was always afraid of running over
people's toes in the hallways. Fi
nally, though, I stood up for
myself. Even though I couldn't do
it physically, I stood up for my
rights," she says.
When Webster became sick
again, this time with pneumonia,
she decided not to go back to high
school. Once recovered, she man
aged to convince officials at a com
munity college near her home in
Atlanta to let her complete her
high school degree by taking col
lege classes.
She applied as a transfer to
Stanford and was granted admis
sion to enter last fall. Once again,
her plans were delayed because
of her illness, and she started
classes in January.
"On my application, I wrote
about all the philosophic, philan
thropic and educational reasons
to come to Stanford," Webster
says."And then I added that I
wanted to come because it was
flat and there was no snow."
Webster says the topography
and weather were major draws to
someone who needed a wheelchair
to get around campus because
hills, snow and ice are dangerous.
Webster still encounters diffi
culties on campus.
"There are places on campus
that I have never seen and prob
ably never will see, because of
accessibility. Even if there are
ramps and curb cuts, you some
times have to go such a distance
to get to them that it's a waste
of energy. Sometimes you just
don't want to bother," she says.
But often, Webster does want
to bother. "If you really want to
participate, you figure out a way

1 think when some
one says that I can't
do something, it
spurs me on to think
that I can.'

— like having people lift you up
the stairs," she says.
Although her wheelchair is
sometimes limiting, Webster says
she is thankful that she has it.
"I think wheelchairs are great.
Years ago, people would just have
to lie in bed.
"After nine months of being
confined to a hospital bed, the
day I got my wheelchair was a
day of victory because I had the
freedom to move around," she
says.
Now, after much physical
therapy, Webster is able to walk
again. She still must use her
wheelchair to travel long dis
tances but can walk in her house
with the support of crutches or a
wall.
In addition to learning to walk
again, Webster, who played both
piano and horn competitively in
high school, has had to relearn
both instruments.
"After I was sick and had a
tracheotomy, I couldn't play for
two years. Then it was like learn
ing all over again," Webster says.
"Some of my ability has been com
promised because my lung
capacity is lower and I've lost
some muscle control."
Yet, Webster currently plays
with both the Stanford Symphony
and Alea, a new music ensemble.
Although she admittedly has a
disability, Webster does not like
the sound of the word.
"I don't like the term 'disabled,'
but I don't have a better one. I
hate 'physically challenged' and
the cutesy 'handi-capable,' " she
says. "We're people. We're crea
tive and adaptable."

that she had multiple sclerosis,
Webster watched her body be

She required a tracheotomy
to breathe and spent nine
months in a hospital, six of them
in an intensive care unit in cri

in remission from her disease.

Mutiple sclerosis is a disease
that affects the central nervous

The cause is unknown, but
symptoms result from a
degeneration of the nerve

and return, sometimes after a
remission of several years.
