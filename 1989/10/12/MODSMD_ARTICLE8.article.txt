# Voice Mail reaches Stanford
##

Listen up, there's a new voice
on the Farm.
Voice Mail, a communications
network which can send and
receive spoken messages from any
touch-tone phone, is spreading
throughout campus.
Already, Stanford has more
than 1,400 users of Voice Mail,
and its popularity is growing
rapidly. According to estimations
by the Information Resources Of
fice, Voice Mail attracts more
than 50 users per month.
Voice Mail gives its users a way
to send information by phone
when it is convenient for the
sender and a way to receive and
reply to that information when it
is convenient for the recipient.
Users may send the same mes
sage to dozens of people in
seconds, just by repeating the
message once and then pressing
a few buttons. A user may reply
to a message received by pressing
a single button, and the system
automatically sends the reply to
the correct person.
In addition, the system enables
a person to add comments to a
received message and forward it
to others who might be interested.
System users on campus in
clude staff in the Athletic Depart

ment, the Graduate School of
Business, the Bursar's Office, the
Computer Science Department,
Cowell Student Health Center, the
History Department, the Law
School, Nursing Services, the
Overseas Studies Office, the
Registrar's Office and Tresidder
Union — to name only a few.
How appealing is Voice Mail to
students?
"At other schools, it's been very
popular," said Jan Thomson, di
rector of Communication Serv
ices. Thomson cited Columbia
University as a foremost institu
tion where Voice Mail has
prevailed among students.
As for Stanford, Thomson could
not say whether or not students
favor Voice Mail systems as they
have yet to reach a large propor
tion of students here.
Thomson said Communication
Services does, however, plan to
extend Voice Mail service to stu
dent residences by next fall.
"When this window opens up
(to students) in September of
1990, it will improve communica
tion not only between students,
but between students and faculty
as well," said Bob March, manager
of Consulting Services for Com
munication Services.
According to Thomson, the

Voice Mail phenomenon first
reached the Farm three years ago
as a gift from the Octel Corpora
tion of Milpitas — one of the
leading manufacturers of these
systems — to the Business School.
Information Resources began
using Voice Mail experimentally
in the 1987-88 academic year, of
fering it free to any University
offices interested.
Last spring, Stanford purchased
Maxum, a larger Voice Mail sys
tem, and moved it from the Busi
ness School for campuswide
access.
Maxum now occupies 32 ports
on campus; it cost about $200,000
to install. The system can expand
up to 72 ports. It became opera
tional here in August.
Some systems serve simply as
answering machines, but others
are used as "enhance-call" proces
sors or "enhance-call" processing
boxes.
For instance, in the Athletic De
partment, Voice Mail enhances
ticket sales for mayor sports events
on campus by sending information
directly to Bass outlets in the Bay
Area.
"We think of this as a technol
ogy which will release people from
the telephone answering function,

The Cardinal Cogeneration Facility, which supplies all of Stanford's energy, is currently involved in
a dispute with the University about increasing its fees.
