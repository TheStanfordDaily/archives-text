Grad student wrestles down bulls
Who said there were no more real cowboys?
Grady Grisson, a graduate student studying
geology at Stanford, captured the California State
Championship title in the rodeo event known as
bulldogging in a competition held last weekend.
Bulldogging, also called steer wrestling, is one
of the more strenuous and exciting rodeo events,
Grisson said.
A steer is released from a pen and is given a
head start, and the contestant, mounted on a
horse, must overtake it. At speeds up to 30 mph,
the competitor jumps from the horse's back and
catches the steer by its horns and is dragged
alongside.
In a matter of seconds, the contestant must
bend the animal's neck around its body, twist its
nose and bring it to a stop.
Grisson competed the entire summer in rodeos
all over the state, sanctioned by the California
Cowboys Professional Rodeo Association.
Grisson, a Colorado native, began working on
ranches during the summer while he was still

in high school. By the time he was a junior at
Princeton, he had taken up bulldogging compete
tively.

Cowell lofts to stay — for now
Students in the Cowell Cluster who have re
cently learned they have illegal lofts in their
rooms will probably not have to tear them down
until next summer.
According to Jack Chin, assistant director of
the Row, it will not be necessary to inconvenience
students whose lofts were recently deemed illegal
by Housing and Food Services, except in the case
of lofts that are fire hazards.
The cluster's lofts have become the subject of
controversy ever since new safety specifications
for lofts were unveiled.
While Chin made it clear that all illegal lofts
would eventually be torn down, Row management
has decided not to force students to redecorate
immediately.
