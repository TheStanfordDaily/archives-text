The Faculty Senate yesterday accepted a list of
rules for multi-authored research papers, but some
members are still confused about the guidelines
contained in the Committee on Research annual
report.
The guidelines were designed to be a clear state
ment of existing University policy and "are almost
platitudes," said Applied Physics Prof. Arthur
Bienenstock, chair of the senate's Committee on
Research.
But some faculty members questioned whether
the guidelines were simply a restatement of existing
policy or actually a new creation that should require
further acceptance procedures in the faculty senate.
Research institutions across the country are ex
pected to pay close attention to Stanford's actions,
after errors forced 11 Stanford collaborative re
search papers to be clarified, corrected or withdrawn
last year.
Since the report dealt with reformulating old
policy rather than creating new guidelines, the sen
ate was not required to vote on it.
Provost James Rosse said that when he instructed
the committee to investigate University policy on
multi-authored research papers last year, no official
guidelines existed on paper. Rosse said he had found
Stanford's guidelines on research to be "unclear"
when faced with investigating an allegation of mis
conduct in multi-authored research last year.
Since Rosse encountered this confusion, "there
exists a portion of the community who does not
subscribe to these guidelines," Chemistry Prof. John
Brauman said.
No members of the senate raised objections to
the guidelines themselves. The four guidelines cover
issues facing multi-investigator research teams —
which often consist of colleagues from different dis
ciplines.
According to the guidelines:
• Principal investigators are responsible for the
validity of the publications on which they appear
as co-authors.
• All authors share responsibility for the published
result and should have the opportunity to review
all data.
• Each author in a group effort should have access
to the paper prior to its submission for publication.
• Early in the project, each research group should
define appropriate practices for the maintenance of
