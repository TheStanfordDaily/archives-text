# Fac Sen studies research policy

The Faculty Senate yesterday accepted a list of
rules for multi-authored research papers, but some
members are still confused about the guidelines
contained in the Committee on Research annual
report.
The guidelines were designed to be a clear state
ment of existing University policy and "are almost
platitudes," said Applied Physics Prof. Arthur
Bienenstock, chair of the senate's Committee on
Research.
But some faculty members questioned whether
the guidelines were simply a restatement of existing
policy or actually a new creation that should require
further acceptance procedures in the faculty senate.
Research institutions across the country are ex
pected to pay close attention to Stanford's actions,
after errors forced 11 Stanford collaborative re
search papers to be clarified, corrected or withdrawn
last year.
Since the report dealt with reformulating old
policy rather than creating new guidelines, the sen
ate was not required to vote on it.
Provost James Rosse said that when he instructed
the committee to investigate University policy on
multi-authored research papers last year, no official
guidelines existed on paper. Rosse said he had found
Stanford's guidelines on research to be "unclear"
when faced with investigating an allegation of mis
conduct in multi-authored research last year.
Since Rosse encountered this confusion, "there
exists a portion of the community who does not
subscribe to these guidelines," Chemistry Prof. John
Brauman said.
No members of the senate raised objections to
the guidelines themselves. The four guidelines cover
issues facing multi-investigator research teams —
which often consist of colleagues from different dis
ciplines.
According to the guidelines:
• Principal investigators are responsible for the
validity of the publications on which they appear
as co-authors.
• All authors share responsibility for the published
result and should have the opportunity to review
all data.
• Each author in a group effort should have access
to the paper prior to its submission for publication.
• Early in the project, each research group should
define appropriate practices for the maintenance of
data.
Bienenstock prefaced the pre
sentation of the guidelines by say
ing that the ability of research to
"discover work which has been
sloppy is the most powerful mech
anism" the University has for en
suring proper conduct.
"Multi-authored reports are
special since different people per
form different, specialized func
tions, and researchers are "par
ticulary vulnerable" to their co

workers' errors, he said.
In addition to creating guide
lines on multi-authored research,
the Committee on Research also
examined the problem of the lack
of time faculty have for research.
The committee tried to explore
the topic last spring by canvassing
the University community for
views on the possible sources of
"faculty overload," but received
only 20 responses from advertise
ments published in The Daily and
Campus Report inviting faculty
and others to comment.
According to the committee
report, "Informal conversations

with those who failed to respond
yielded statements like, 'I'm too
busy to read Campus Report or
The Stanford Daily.' "
The committee plans to explore
the problem of faculty time for
research in more depth this year.
In other business, Political Sci
ence Prof. John Manley ques
tioned what he termed President
Kennedy's "narrow and legalistic
approach" in the handling of the
Louis Jackson case.
Manley urged University offi
cials to make a "statement about
the deep faculty and student con
cern" for Jackson.
