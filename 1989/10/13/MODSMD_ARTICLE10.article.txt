No 'white punks on dope' need apply
Freshman Orientation this year was celebrated without the
traditional tune "White Punks on Dope" after controversy sur
rounding the message of the song led the Committee on Un
dergraduate Studies to prohibit the Stanford Band from playing
the song.
Committee members cut "White Punks on Dope" from the
Band's Orientation repertoire because they felt the title and
lyrics could be interpreted as presenting an image of Stanford,
or at least of the Band, as dominated by "spoiled, privileged
children who exult in their racial exclusivity and use drugs,"
the committee reported.
Band Manager Jonathan Sherman disagreed with the inter
pretation, saying the original intent of the song was to make
fun of this stereotype.
"The Band does not support 'white punks' or dope,' but is
advocating the satire of them," Sherman said. "The song is a
condemnation of that kind of lifestyle. It's very much tongue
in-cheek."
According to Sherman, Asst. Dean of Residential Education
Alice Supton originally approached the Band last spring and
requested that they not play on the first night of Orientation
at all because they were not on the schedule.
"We've never been on the schedule," Sherman said. "It was
always something we just did."
The committee finally agreed to let the Band play, but insisted
on having control of the performance because the Band was "so
out of bounds" last year.
