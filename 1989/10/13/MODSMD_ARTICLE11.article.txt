## Radical Korean students storm U.S. ambassador's home 
### 
SEOUL, South Korea (AP) â€”
Radical students armed with
firebombs and tear gas briefly oc
cupied part of U.S. Ambassador
Donald Gregg's residence early
Friday before riot police dragged
them out, officials said.
A U.S. State Department
spokesman in Washington said
Gregg and his wife were not in
jured in the attack.
Police said six male students
belonging to an "anti-U.S. death
squad" scaled the walls of Gregg's
residential compound and hurled
tear gas at guards who tried to
stop them from rushing the home.
The students locked themselves
inside one building and held off
riot police for about 30 minutes
before troops firing tear gas

smashed down a door and seized
them, police said.
"Drive out the Yankees!" the
students screamed as police
hustled them away.
Gregg and his wife, Meg, said
at a news conference they were
in bed about 6:30 a.m. when they
heard a blast and a guard warned
them by telephone that intruders
had entered the compound, which
is about one mile from the U.S.
Embassy.
The Greggs said they heard the
intruders on the other side of
their locked bedroom door, but
were able to escape the house by
another entrance and avoid an en
counter with the students.
The students however caused
extensive damage in the living

room, smashing artwork and pot
tery, Gregg said.
He said though that the incident
would have no impact on U.S.-
South Korean relations and that
the students represented a vocal
minority.
"This was the act of six people
who broke into our house," Gregg
said.
Police said the intruders were
armed with firebombs, tear gas
and steel bars. Yonhap, the South
Korean news agency, said the pro
testers also carried paint thinner
and what it described as a crude
homemade explosive.
Police said the intruders did not
use any weapons except for one
tear gas grenade they detonated
when forcing their way into the

compound in central Seoul.
Damage from the tear gas
grenade, which was apparently
captured police equipment, was
described as minor.
The students, who came from
three colleges in the Seoul area,
demanded a meeting with Gregg
to press for an end to U.S. trade
pressure on South Korea, police
said.
They shouted "Punish Gregg!"
and "We oppose U.S. trade pres
sure!" At least one student was
draped in a South Korean na
tional flag.
The students also demanded
South Korean President Roh Tae
woo call off his proposed trip Sun
day to Washington for talks with
President Bush and other U.S.

leaders.
Radical students have opposed
Seoul's close ties with the United
States, demanding Washington
stop pressuring Korea to accept
more U.S. products. The United
States has been seeking greater
access to South Korean markets
to help correct its huge trade im
balance with Seoul.
The radicals opposed Gregg's
appointment as ambassador be
cause he was a former CIA station
chief in Seoul in the 19705. They
claim Gregg, who arrived in Seoul
last month, was sent to help bol
ster the conservative South
Korean government.
The attack on his home came
two days after U.S. trade repre
sentative Carla Hills left Seoul

after talks with South Korean of
ficials. Hills and other U.S. offi
cials have demanded South Korea
drop its import barriers.
Radical students have attacked
U.S. diplomatic facilities in the
past, but most of the incidents
have been minor and no Ameri
cans have been seriously hurt.
The radicals are demanding the
withdrawal of the 43,000 U.S.
troops based in South Korea, but
they have little public support be
cause of their extreme political
views. Their support has declined
further in recent months because
of their sympathy for rival com
munist North Korea.
Gregg served as Bush's national
security adviser when Bush was
vice president.
