# Democrats defend abortion legislation

WASHINGTON (AP) - Dem
ocratic leaders in Congress
pressed President Bush on Thurs
day not to veto legislation that
would end a ban on federally
financed abortions for the "most
vulnerable American women" —
the poor who are victims of rape
or incest.
They acknowledged that sup
porters of the relaxed Medicaid
abortion limits do not have
enough votes to override Bush's
threatened veto but urged him to
reconsider.
House minority Leader Robert
Michel, R-111., said he had not
heard from Bush on the possible
abortion veto, but told reporters,
"I've never known him to go back
on his word."
But Senate Majority Leader
George Mitchell, D-Maine, in a
joint statement with House
Speaker Thomas Foley, said, "The
president's position is wrong. It is
harsh — terribly harsh — on the
poorest, most vulnerable Ameri
can women."
"Not only is this a reflection of
the majority position of the House
of Representatives, Democrat and

Republican, and the United States
Senate, but the American people
as well," said Foley, D-Wash.
"The president has the power
to deny an opportunity for poor
women to make a choice in their
tragic circumstances," he said.
Bush threatened in August to
veto the bill. "Our signal's out
there and he believes in it strong
ly, but will review the bill when
it gets here," White House Press
Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said
Thursday.
In an outcome that surprised
even the victors, the House voted
216-206 on Wednesday to reverse
a decade of restrictions on
Medicaid abortions. The vote was
in favor of permitting federal
money to be used to terminate
pregnancies for poor women who
are victims of rape or incest and
who report it promptly to author
ities.
The majority contained 27
members switched from support
ing restrictions in a similar vote
13 months ago, while only two
members switched the other way.
The provision would extend cur
rent law permitting Medicaid

abortions only in cases where a
woman's life was endangered by
pregnancy and she could not af
ford to pay for an abortion.
It is part of a $156.7 billion
measure to finance labor, health
and education programs for fiscal
1990 that has already been ap
proved by the Senate but remains
subject to final agreement on un
related issues.
The new provision is narrowly
drawn, permitting abortion when
the victims report the rape or in
cest "promptly," and officials said
the change might affect only a
small number of cases.
But it was widely viewed as a
symbolic victory for supporters of
abortion rights and came as pro
choice forces were benefiting from

an apparently changed political
climate on abortion since the Su
preme Court's ruling in July. That
ruling opened the way for in
creased state regulation of abor
tions and, according to pro-choice
forces, politically energized those
who oppose limits on the right to
an abortion.
Michel suggested there might
be room for a compromise if both
sides could agree to a provision
permitting Medicaid abortions
when the rape or incest victim
reported that act within 48 hours
of its occurance.
The House vote came on the
same day abortion rights groups
enjoyed another symbolic victory,
this time in Florida. The state
legislature, in a special session
called by Republican Gov. Bob
Martinez, rejected all the gover
nor's proposed abortion restric
tions.
"Certainly Florida and the vote
yesterday in Congress are reflec
tive of a new political movement,"
said Kate Michelman, executive
director of the National Abortion
Rghts Action League. "The
climate is changing."


Florida Governor, Bob Martinez, makes a point on his convictions in the
wake of the Florida legislature failing to act on any abortion issues during
his called special session of the legislature.
