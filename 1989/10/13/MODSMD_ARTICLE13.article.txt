# Panama covert action blocked
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Mem
bers of Congress barred at least
one covert operation in Panama
proposed by the administration,
intelligence sources said Thurs
day.
One member of the House In
telligence Committee alluded to
the congressional restrictions dur
ing debate on the appropriations
bill for intelligence agencies, say
ing President Bush's cautious re
sponse to the coup was justified
in part by interference from the
Democratic Congress.
"Who could expect this admin
istration or any administration,
or any intelligence agencies, to
make gutsy decisions when we
have lashed them, put them under
the whip, tethered them, told
them they better not do any
thing?" said Rep. Bud Shuster,
R-Pa.
In an apparent allusion to re
marks made earlier this week by
Senate Intelligence Committee

Chairman David Boren, D-Okla.,
Shuster noted that some on
Capitol Hill have claimed Bush
has received "everything he
wanted with regard to Panama."
"And yet we know there are
those who have gone to the White
House and threatened them with
exposure (of) classified informa
tion, and said, 'You dare not
engage in covert operations,'"
Shuster said.
Other knowledgeable congres
sional sources said members of
the House Intelligence Committee
had specifically barred the admin
istration from exercising un
specified options that could have
yielded better inside knowledge of
the Panamanian Defense Forces.
The administration had
notified Congress of the options
in an intelligence "finding," a doc
ument required to be given to Con
gress before undertaking covert
actions, the sources said.

Shuster mentioned po law
makers by name, but Hbuse Mi
nority Leader Robert Michel, R
-111., later called Shuster's remarks
significant.
Referring to lawmakers critical
of Bush's inaction — a group that
includes Boren — Michel said
there is "plenty in the (classified)
record ... to know that some of
these people are going far beyond
what they've got the right to say
about the administration's re
quests in the past, what was
granted and what was denied."
In another development, the
Bush administration denied Nor
iega's allegations the United
States paid $1 million to rebel
officers to launch last week's
failed coup.
"That's nonsense," said Penta
gon spokesman Pete Williams.
"Absurd," said State Depart
ment spokeswoman Margaret Tut
wiler.
