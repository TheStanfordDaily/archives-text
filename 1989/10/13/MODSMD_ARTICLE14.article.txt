NEW ORK (AP) — Fears that a computer
virus will trash information on some personal

computers are overblown, experts said Thursday,
but some alarmed users have taken steps to make
sure they don't wake up Friday the 13th with
the infection.
"Our advice to people is stop worrying," said
Dennis Steinauer of the National Institute of
Standards and Technology. "People should make
a backup copy of their files and don't call me in
the morning. There's virtually no way it can
spread around and cause any significant damage
at all."
