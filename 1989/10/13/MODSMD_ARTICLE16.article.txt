## Toward accessibility 
### 
Tomorrow, as part of the
Center for Public Service's
ninth annual Reach Out
Today, hundreds of students from
all over campus will volunteer their
time for a community cause.
But there are also causes right
here at Stanford that need time
from students — for more than
just one day.
The Disability Resource Center
provides many valuable services,
from recording books to oral inter
preters to promoting campus ac
cessibility for students with dis
abilities.
The center has a small staff of
paid employees, many of them stu
dents, but can always use volun
teers — particularly to record
books and articles on tape.
Before the DRC provided reader
services, students had to wait three
to four weeks to get recorded books
from a national agency. Now, they
can get materials at the start of
the quarter — but only if there
are volunteers to record them.

A minority group that is often
overlooked, the disabled commu
nity must deal with many issues
affecting daily life.
While Stanford is making strides
toward accessibility, there are
many definitions of accessibility.
If a student can reach his or her
room in a dormitory, but not the
laundry room or lounge, then the
dorm is not truly accessible. If a
ramp is built to a building, but
the door opens outward, making it
impossible for a student in a wheel
chair to open it, then the building
is not truly accessible.
Jim Bouquin, director of the cen
ter, says achieving accessibility is
a major goal, but he sees it as only
a "means to an end." Once full
accessibility is attained for the stu
dents, they can begin to explore
their disabilities as a part of their
personhood and the DRC can be
not only a service center, but a
cultural and community center as
well.
