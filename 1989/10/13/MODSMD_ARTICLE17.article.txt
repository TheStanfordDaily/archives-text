# Home in the Quad

THE GOOD NEWS is that al
most everyone who was in
last spring's Draw is living
somewhere on campus.
Rodger Whitney, director of Stu
dent Housing, said that "probably
less than 10" male undergraduates
still remain among a peculiar breed
of homeless people who shell out
over $13,000 a year to take college
classes. They may yet be housed
on campus sometime before Dec.
1, when the waiting list period
ends. Maybe winter will come late
this year.
While it certainly sounds great
to hear that all female undergrad
uates, female graduate students
and male graduate students who
were in the Draw received housing,
the housing problem at this Uni

versity has not been solved.
Last year, the University actu
ally did a better job of housing
everybody: those in the 1988 Draw
who remained on the summer
waiting list had a roof over his or
her head by the start of classes.
And there was no Roble Hall last
year. Of course, there were still
lots of people living off campus
unwillingly, as there are this year.
So the bad news is that the good
news isn't as good as it sounds.
It's still the same old story.
While Whitney and other Uni
versity administrators search for a
solution to the chronic housing
shortage, a few Stanford students
who go to classes in the Quad
aren't sure they won't be sleeping
there come nightfall.
