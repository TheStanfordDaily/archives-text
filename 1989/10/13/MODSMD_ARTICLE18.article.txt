### 
ASSU, BSU show racial bias to support Jackson

SIMPLY PUT, "It's time to grow
up." As it's been said many times
before, the students need to
realize that all actions have repercus
sions, especially those which are
against the law.
Calvin Martin and the Black Student
Union are showing their naivete and
possible racial bias in requesting that
all charges be dropped against Louis
Jackson.
Jackson's participation in the May 15
takeover led to six possible counts of
law breaking. As an adult, Jackson
knows his personal responsibility for
actions such as these. And he knows
what the results will most likely be.
No longer is mom able to jump in and

say, "He's too young, he didn't know
any better."
As it stands, groups such as the
BSU and the ASSU should not be
taking stances which potentially aid an
individual in breaking the law and
then request that he or she be set
free.
They should be giving their support
to students who attempt to have an
effect on the issues through proper
channels. In this case, they should not
be requesting that all charges be
dropped against Jackson, but instead
that all be charged.
They and I are outraged that Jack
son was singled out. But if they
wanted to show that they carried any

I question [the BSU's] mo
tives as to why they are
supporting Jackson and
not the law.

respect for law and order, they'd be
requesting that the prosecution be
more diligent in charging all partici
pants fairly according to their actions.
Instead, the two unions are simply
showing personal interest in protecting
one of their own and maybe others
within their group who might have
been participants as well and fear

further prosecutions. In other words, I
question their motives as to why they
are supporting Jackson and not the
law.
In Martin's Oct. 11 letter to The
Daily, he plainly says that Jackson is
guilty of taking part when he says,
. . and the police videotapes know
that Jackson was not the only partici
pant of the takeover . . yet he has
the gali to continue on and say, "We
truly believe that Kennedy knows
Jackson is innocent."
Clearly, this is contradictory. If he is,
Martin is not his defense, and I hope
that Jackson learns to use sound
judgment next time.
