# AASA supports BSU, Jackson and wants all charges dropped
## 
### 
The Asian American Students Associ
ation opposes the unjust prosecution of
Black Student Union vice-chair Louis
Jackson. We stand with the BSU in
their efforts to ensure that all charges
against him are dropped.
Jackson symbolizes the efforts of
students who have worked toward the
realization of multiculturalism at Stan
ford. He has demonstrated his commit
ment to this cause through his exten
sive involvement in the Western Cul
ture/CIV debate, the African and Afro-
American Studies Program, the Asian-
American Studies campaign and the
Chicano community's struggle for a
full-time dean.
We believe that if Stanford is truly
committed to creating a community
supportive of diverse cultures, it must

take a stand on behalf of the student
who is one of the greatest proponents
of multiculturalism.
