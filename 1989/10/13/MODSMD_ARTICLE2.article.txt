# Dukakis stresses reform
## Governor urges businesses to address public needs 
### Pam Weisz Staff writer 
Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis
told a standing-room-only crowd at the
Graduate School of Business last night
that the private and public sectors "must
unite" in order to improve the areas of
child care, education, health care and
the environment.
The speech, the keynote event of the
Business School's yearlong Public Man
agement Initiative program, took place

in Bishop Auditorium and was open only
to business students.
Dukakis explained that issues such as
child care, the environment and educa
tion used to be regarded as "soft, liberal"
issues. Now, however, these are consid
ered "cross-cutting main-line issues"
and are seen as important by the busi
ness community.
The governor also shared his views
on more personal issues. He said he

finds his work in the public sector
rewarding because of the "oppor
tunity to improve the quality of
life of [his] fellow citizens." The
tradeoff for this, though, is being
"exposed to public view all the
time."
Dukakis said he will not run
again for governor of Massachu
setts. He added that running for
president again is "something I
haven't thought about."
Dukakis did not pass up the
opportunity to poke fun at the
current administration. Referring
to the failed coup in Panama, he
said there are two things the
United States doesn't do very
well: "We don't overthrow govern
ments very well and we don't lie
about it very well."
Vice President Dan Quayle, he
said, "thinks Roe v. Wade are the
two options George Washington
had when crossing the Delaware."
