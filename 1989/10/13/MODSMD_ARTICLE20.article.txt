In the Wednesday article about Uni
versity committees, The Daily rightly
points out that there are a number of
student positions on the committees
that remain vacant, yet it fails to em
phasize the significance, not only of
filling the positions, but of having
students involved on these committees.
Decisions on many of these commit
tees directly concern students. The
faculty and staff who frequently attend

the meetings often feel uncomfortable
when they have to make choices affect
ing students, particularly when stu
dents do not show much interest at the
time these decisions are being made or
do not show up at all.
Being on a University committee is a
chance for students to interact with
faculty on a equal level since they of
ten share the same amount of voting
power. University committees also al
low students to affect decisions made
at Stanford which could have impor
tant implications for the rest of the
community.
While many of the committees do
need more members, many are already
filled and in full swing. Granted, some
of the apathy comes from students'
lack of knowledge about the various
committees. But some interest in learn
ing about the committees, and the
effects of their decisions, has to come
from the students themselves.
