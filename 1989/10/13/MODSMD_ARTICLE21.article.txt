# Students should seize chance to serve on University committees
## 
### 
In reading the story about the many
unfilled openings on University com
mittees (The Daily, Oct. 11), I decided
to write this short note to encourage
students to apply for these openings
before the deadline, Oct. 13.
Stanford wants and needs the contri
butions of students, and it is to no
one's advantage that openings remain.
We are receiving many calls from com
mittee assistants and chairs wondering
when the openings will be filled.
Service on committees is a
opportunity for students to find out
more about the University and to con
tribute to making policy. Take advan
tage of it! Both undergraduate and
graduate students are needed.
