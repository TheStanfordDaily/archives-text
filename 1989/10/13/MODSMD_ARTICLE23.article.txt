## Happy ties with Hoover 
### 
STANFORD and the Hoover Insti
tution seem to finally be getting
along. That news should cheer
anyone who has more than a passing
interest in seeing Stanford remain an
elite university and Hoover remain a
first-class think tank.
The benefits to a positive relationship
between the two should be obvious: each
has an outstanding library; each has a
first-rate, distinguished faculty; and each
plays a prominent role in national policy
and research matters. So why would
anyone want to divorce the two, and allow
them to lose access to the other's valuable
resources?
To tell you the truth, I'm not sure. As
a student, I enjoy and value the access
to Hoover's vast library and archive sys
tem, as well as to its renowned faculty;
where else in America can you discuss
the current U.S. policy in the Middle East
with the person who actually made the
policy, or learn about the interpersonal
politics of the Reagan Administration
from the people who were in the room?
Allowing Stanford students the oppor
tunity to take classes from Hoover schol
ars and use Hoover's resources results
only in brighter, better informed stu
dents. Not a bad objective for a university.
I would imagine faculties as talented
as Stanford's and Hoover's would also
want access to one another's intellectual
resources, as well as the added prestige
they bring to one another.
One senior fellow at Hoover admitted
that association with the University
"makes you think like a scholar," and

there can be no question that Stanford
benefits from its relationship with such
Hoover fellows as George Schultz, Milton
Friedman and Thomas Sowell.
That's why Prof. John Manley, in his
Monday "Viewpoint" in The Daily, con
founds me. Though he claims to speak
in defense of Stanford's reputation, the
implementation of his plan to bring Hoo
ver under "normal academic gover
nance," or divorce the two completely,
would bring irreparable damage to the
University's prestige.
Let's forget, for now, that two faculty
studies of the Stanford/Hoover relation
ship over the last five years have found
no grounds for changing the relationship,
and that the Faculty Senate just defeated
a motion for a further study. Let's look,
instead, at Manley's reasons for concern.
The danger in the relationship, Manley
states, rests on the assumption that Hoo
ver's "mission" is "policy research and
advocacy," while Stanford's aim is "educa
tion," and the two are inherently incom
patible. Wait a second. Is this the same
Prof. Manley that teaches Political Sci
ence 10? My friend Tim took that class.
And I quote: "That's all Manley's class
is about: Marxist ideology. It's deep, deep
left field."
So, some Hoover fellows advocate a
certain ideology with the results of their
research. Sounds like they're doing their
jobs. Yet Prof. Manley's own stated aim
is "education" (he works for a university,
after all), and he advocates a certain ideol
ogy-
According to Manley's own logic, the
two are incompatible. What does that

If Prof. Manley was truly
interested in Stanford's
reputation, he would leave
Hoover and Stanford
alone.

make Prof. Manley? At best, it makes
him irresponsible. At worst, it makes him
a hypocrite.
Despite the contradiction, Prof. Manley
has renewed his call for bringing Hoover
under "normal academic goverance." In
essence, it's a direct, if vaguely worded,
threat to the academic freedom of Hoover.
Hoover fellows are not forced to justify
their research to a superior or answer to
a faculty board of review. The threat
implied by "normal academic gover
nance," warns Hoover senior fellow John
Cogen, would scatter some of Hoover's
and Stanford's best minds to other insti
tutions, depriving Stanford and Hoover
of valuable resources.
If Prof. Manley was truly interested in
Stanford's reputation, he would leave
Stanford and Hoover alone. They're
doing just fine.

a hypocrite.
Despite the contradiction, Prof. Manley
has renewed his call for bringing Hoover
under "normal academic goverance." In
essence, it's a direct, if vaguely worded,
threat to the academic freedom of Hoover.
Hoover fellows are not forced to justify
their research to a superior or answer to
a faculty board of review. The threat
implied by "normal academic gover
nance," warns Hoover senior fellow John
Cogen, would scatter some of Hoover's
and Stanford's best minds to other insti
tutions, depriving Stanford and Hoover
of valuable resources.
If Prof. Manley was truly interested in
Stanford's reputation, he would leave
Stanford and Hoover alone. They're
doing just fine.
