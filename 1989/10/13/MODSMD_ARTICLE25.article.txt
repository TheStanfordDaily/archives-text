Working for minority
communities is
working for everyone
In her column in The Daily on Mon
day, Cheryl Taylor wrote that she felt
obligated, as an African-American
woman, to reinvest her talents and
education in the black community.
In his letter to The Daily on Wed
nesday, Jeffrey Crerie's response —
that she should help everyone, and not
just African-Americans — reflects a

notion that I have long felt needs to
be addressed.
When a person like Cheryl Taylor
involves herself in activities and organ
izations that help her own ethnic or
cultural community, her work is often
seen as special interest work that only
benefits minorities.
What needs to be understood is that
self-empowerment of ethnic minorities
— or women, or the gay community 01
any oppressed group — is a step for
ward for everyone.
Unleashing the human potential of
an entire people not only liberates that
specific group but also adds to the
cultural resources, knowledge and crea

tivity of society as a whole.
Crerie's suggestion that black com
munity work does not benefit
"everyone" suggests two obviously fal
lacious things: that African-Americans
are not an important part of everyone
and that their lives have consequence
only within their own communities.
Crerie seems to question Taylor for
her plans to specialize in Afro-
American causes. African and Afro-
American Studies is as relevant and
universal as any other — includ
ing aeronautics and astronautics, which
is Crerie's specialty.
I am not an African-American and I
am not a rocket scientist, but my life

has been shaped by the work of both
the Student Non-Violent Coordinating
Committee and NASA.
"Special interest" and "minority"
issues should be renamed and recog
nized for what they are — "com
munity" issues, of particular communi
ties and of our community as a whole.
