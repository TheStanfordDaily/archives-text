## First black grad returns to Stanford 
### Lyzette Settle Staff writer 
This past weekend was a busy
one for Stanford alumni, with
football activities and reunions
galore. In the midst of all this
activity, H.J. Bel ton Hamilton Jr.
was quietly honored at his fortieth
class reunion, as the first known
black graduate from Stanford
University.
Hamilton, a federal administra
tive law judge in Portland,
Oregon, told The Daily he is gen
erally accepted as the first black
graduate from Stanford, although
this fact cannot be absolutely
proven. At the time of his grad
uation in 1949, there were no
records kept of such things, nor
were applicants ever asked to note
their ethnicity when completing
admissions forms.
Believing that race should not
be an obstacle if someone wants
to do something, Hamilton said
he did not decide to apply to Stan
ford until someone told him he
could not.
This is typical of Hamilton's at
titude. He is a man determined
to do what he wants, regardless
of the negative expectations or
limitations people may apply to
him. His most popular phrase is:
"I'm a free man and I'll do what
ever I damn well please."
Thus, whenever he has been
told there was something he could
not do because of his ethnicity,
he has then responded by proving
that person wrong. This is cer
tainly demonstrated by the many
"firsts" Hamilton has achieved in
his lifetime. After he graduated
from Stanford, for example, he
became the first black assistant
attorney general in Oregon, and
eventually rose to the position of
chief counsel to the Oregon
Bureau of Labor. Hamilton has
also been the first chair of the
Oregon Urban League to hold that
title five times consecutively.
When reflecting upon all these
accomplishments, one must not
forget the time period in which
Hamilton was a student, a young
black man, at Stanford. Hamilton
said there may have been fair-

skinned black people on the Stan
ford campus that no one knew
about, but he was noticeably an
African-American, with a dark
complexion, ergo the title of the
first black man to graduate from
Stanford was bestowed upon him.
The 1940s were obviously a
much more segregated time pe
riod than today. At the time
Hamilton was a student, there
were housing, school and social
segregation laws in effect across
the nation. One might think that
Stanford during the mid- to late
40s would not have been the most
welcoming place for a black per
son. This, however, is not the
Stanford that Hamilton recalled
during his interview.
The Stanford community was
much more progressive than other
college campuses at that time, he
said. For example, at the Univer
sity of Oregon, from which Hamil
ton transferred, there were special
housing complexes for black stu
dents, as well as eating facilities
separate from the white students.
The Oregon Law School refused
to admit black students unless
they could show proof they had a
place to live off-campus.
Stanford had no such policy, nor
did it have special facilities for
black students, so Hamilton lived
in Toyon Hall with his white
peers. When asked if there were
any unpleasant incidents, he had
great difficulty remembering any.
He explained that he was quite
the novelty. There was no one
else who looked like him on
campus, so he was the person
everyone wanted to know.
Hamilton's social life was not
unlike that of any other student.
He went to the school dances, at
tended class and did his

homework. It might be interesting
to note that the dating situation
was even less of an option then
than it is now. The male students
on campus went to Mills College
in Berkeley to find women to date,
Hamilton recalled, because the
ratio of men to women at Stanford
was approximately 5 to 1.
Hamilton said he was not very
active in any of the extracurricu
lar activities, but took this time
to get the best education that
Stanford had to offer.
After leaving Stanford, Hamil
ton went back to Oregon and at
tended Northwestern School of
Law in Portland. During his time
as chief counsel to the Oregon
Bureau of Labor, Hamilton helped
propose and pass the Oregon Fair
Housing Act. Through the enact
ment of such a law, the issues of
employment discrimination, social
discrimination (segregated
bathrooms, being unable to sleep
at various hotels, motels, motor
inns, etc.), as well as housing dis
crimination were addressed. This
law, one of the first of its kind
in the nation, became a model for
many other states.
Hamilton's family side is just
as intriguing, if not more so, than
his political side. He has been
married to Midori Hamilton for
over 25 years. The couple, who
became the first Japanese-
American/African- American pair
in Oregon, has two children â€”
Konrad and Camille. Camille is a
city attorney in San Francisco, as
well as a Stanford graduate with
a degree in political science. Kon
rad, who is currently working
toward a Ph. Din history at Stan
ford, has followed in his father's
footsteps in many ways, such as
becoming involved in the Urban
League and in politics.
What is most unique about this
family, however, is that the
children have very strong cultural
identities. Both parents said they
were very aware of their respec
tive cultures and therefore taught
their children about their heri
tage. As a result, Camille and
Konrad have avoided the
confusion that many children of
mixed parentage possess.

Hamilton said he is currently
working on a book that deals with
the questions and misconceptions
people have concerning interracial
couples. It consists of family
newsletters that were sent during
Christmastime, as well as general
comments and discussion on the
issue of interracial marriages.
The Stanford of the late 40s
was a different reality for H.J.
Belton Hamilton than it is for the
hundreds of black students who
walk through its halls today. Now
there are political issues blacks
must deal with, which Hamilton
never had to face when he was
the only black student. This is a
sign of the changing times.
But Hamilton has some advice
for those students who feel the
need to fight for different issues
on the Stanford campus. Accord
ing to him, a person should never
"let anyone tell you what you
are," but should instead define
their personality for themselves
and "prepare to make independent
choices."
By refusing to allow people to
tell him what his boundaries were
and what he was not allowed to
do, Hamilton has made these de
cisions for himself throughout his
lifetime. It is because of this at
titude that he is now the first
acknowledged black graduate of
Stanford University.
