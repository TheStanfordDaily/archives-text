# Jackson case proceeds slowly
## 
### John Wagner Editorial staff 
Legal proceedings in the Louis
Jackson case stumbled forward
yesterday.
• The district attorney refused
to drop the battery charge against
Jackson.
• Jackson's attorney had lim
ited success in gaining access to
subpoenaed documents and pho
tographs which he said are critical
to Jackson's defense.
• And the resolution of both
matters was ultimately delayed
until further hearings.
Jackson, a junior, is facing six
misdemeanor charges in connec
tion with the May 15 takeover of
University President Donald Ken
nedy's office.
At yesterday's pre-trial hearing,
Jackson's lawyer, Joseph Bil
lings'ey, hoped to see Jackson's
battery charge dismissed and ac
quire several documents and
photos from the University's in

ternal investigation of the
takeover. The documents and
photos, Billingsley said, will be
used in trying to "highlight the
unfairness" of Jackson's distinc
tion by the district attorney

Jackson's defense, Billingsley
said, will require showing Jackson
has been treated differently than
other protesters for "impermis
sable purposes."
Jackson is the only student in
volved in the takeover of Ken
nedy's office who is facing six mis
demeanor charges.
But Billingsley had difficulty
yesterday trying to secure the doc
uments and photos he said are
needed to build his case. A sealed
package containing materials
from Stanford's internal investi
gation of the takeover was
delivered to the court by Jennifer
Westerlind of the University's Le
gal Office.
The district attorney tried to
block Billingsley's access to the
package, claiming many of the
documents and photos were
originals which should not leave
Stanford. Westerlind said in an
interview that most of the photos


Joseph Billingsley
were originals and had cost more
than $1,000 in printing costs.
Judge Stephen Manley noted in
court that he had no record of
Billingsley's discovery motion to
gain access to records. But Manley
directed the parties to consult and
requested that all materials be
made available to Billingsley un
less Stanford had specific objec
tions.
Any objections will be addressed
in a hearing on Oct. 18, Manley
decided.
The battery charge Jackson is
facing stems from his role in the
initial occupation of the Presi
dent's Office. According to the
police report on the incident, Jack
son was "one of the individuals
who initially grabbed a reception
ist [Mandy McCalla] by the elbow
and attempted to force her out
side."
Billingsley said yesterday that

Asst. District Attorney Tom Fah
renholz indicated in June that the
battery charge was likely to be
dropped.
McCalla also signed a civil com
promise agreement stating she
had no complaint against Jackson.
But Fahrenholz said in an in
terview last week that he had no
intention of dropping the charge,
despite McCalla's statement. "The
battery is still pending because
it's our decision, not hers," Fah
renholz said. "There was an un
lawful touching in my mind."
Fahrenholz appeared in a
closed-chambers conference yes
terday morning, but was not pres
ent at the open court hearing that
followed in the afternoon. He was
not available for comment yester
day afternoon.
According to Billingsley, Fah
renholz stood behind a statement
of opposition to dismissal of the
charges, which was drafted by his
office.
In the statement, the district
attorney argues that Jackson is

not entitled to a civil compromise
— which would in effect dismiss
the battery charge — because the
alleged battery was committed
during a riot.
The statement cites Penal Code
Section 1377, which says that a
misdemeanor cannot be dismissed
by civil compromise if the mis
demeanor is committed "riotous-
According to the statement, the
events surrounding the takeover
of Kennedy's office were riotous.
"The unruly assembly described
in the police report of this case
appears to qualify as a riot," the
statement says. "Certainly, [the]
defendant and his more than 40
associates terrorized and bullied
the occupants of Building 170 (sic)
in an effort to draw attention to
their private cause."
In court yesterday, Billingsley
called the district attorney's ar
gument "unfounded."
The motion to dismiss the bat
tery charge will be addressed on
Nov. 1, Manley said.

photos, Billingsley said, will be
used in trying to "highlight the
unfairness" of Jackson's distinc
tion by the district attorney

Jackson's defense, Billingsley
said, will require showing Jackson
has been treated differently than
other protesters for "impermis
sable purposes."
Jackson is the only student in
volved in the takeover of Ken
nedy's office who is facing six mis
demeanor charges.
But Billingsley had difficulty
yesterday trying to secure the doc
uments and photos he said are
needed to build his case. A sealed
package containing materials
from Stanford's internal investi
gation of the takeover was
delivered to the court by Jennifer
Westerlind of the University's Le
gal Office.
The district attorney tried to
block Billingsley's access to the
package, claiming many of the
documents and photos were
originals which should not leave
Stanford. Westerlind said in an
interview that most of the photos


Joseph Billingsley
were originals and had cost more
than $1,000 in printing costs.
Judge Stephen Manley noted in
court that he had no record of
Billingsley's discovery motion to
gain access to records. But Manley
directed the parties to consult and
requested that all materials be
made available to Billingsley un
less Stanford had specific objec
tions.
Any objections will be addressed
in a hearing on Oct. 18, Manley
decided.
The battery charge Jackson is
facing stems from his role in the
initial occupation of the Presi
dent's Office. According to the
police report on the incident, Jack
son was "one of the individuals
who initially grabbed a reception
ist [Mandy McCalla] by the elbow
and attempted to force her out
side."
Billingsley said yesterday that

Asst. District Attorney Tom Fah
renholz indicated in June that the
battery charge was likely to be
dropped.
McCalla also signed a civil com
promise agreement stating she
had no complaint against Jackson.
But Fahrenholz said in an in
terview last week that he had no
intention of dropping the charge,
despite McCalla's statement. "The
battery is still pending because
it's our decision, not hers," Fah
renholz said. "There was an un
lawful touching in my mind."
Fahrenholz appeared in a
closed-chambers conference yes
terday morning, but was not pres
ent at the open court hearing that
followed in the afternoon. He was
not available for comment yester
day afternoon.
According to Billingsley, Fah
renholz stood behind a statement
of opposition to dismissal of the
charges, which was drafted by his
office.
In the statement, the district
attorney argues that Jackson is

not entitled to a civil compromise
— which would in effect dismiss
the battery charge — because the
alleged battery was committed
during a riot.
The statement cites Penal Code
Section 1377, which says that a
misdemeanor cannot be dismissed
by civil compromise if the mis
demeanor is committed "riotous-
According to the statement, the
events surrounding the takeover
of Kennedy's office were riotous.
"The unruly assembly described
in the police report of this case
appears to qualify as a riot," the
statement says. "Certainly, [the]
defendant and his more than 40
associates terrorized and bullied
the occupants of Building 170 (sic)
in an effort to draw attention to
their private cause."
In court yesterday, Billingsley
called the district attorney's ar
gument "unfounded."
The motion to dismiss the bat
tery charge will be addressed on
Nov. 1, Manley said.
