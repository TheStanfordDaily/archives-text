# Jackson case proceeds slowly
## 
### John Wagner Editorial staff 
Legal proceedings in the Louis
Jackson case stumbled forward
yesterday.
• The district attorney refused
to drop the battery charge against
Jackson.
• Jackson's attorney had lim
ited success in gaining access to
subpoenaed documents and pho
tographs which he said are critical

• And the resolution of both
matters was ultimately delayed

Jackson, a junior, is facing six
misdemeanor charges in connec

At yesterday's pre-trial hearing,
Jackson's lawyer, Joseph Bil
lings'ey, hoped to see Jackson's
battery charge dismissed and ac

photos from the University's in

ternal investigation of the
takeover. The documents and
photos, Billingsley said, will be
used in trying to "highlight the
unfairness" of Jackson's distinc
tion by the district attorney

Jackson's defense, Billingsley
said, will require showing Jackson
has been treated differently than
other protesters for "impermis
sable purposes."
Jackson is the only student in
volved in the takeover of Ken
nedy's office who is facing six mis
demeanor charges.
But Billingsley had difficulty
yesterday trying to secure the doc
uments and photos he said are
needed to build his case. A sealed
package containing materials
from Stanford's internal investi
gation of the takeover was
delivered to the court by Jennifer
Westerlind of the University's Le
gal Office.
The district attorney tried to
block Billingsley's access to the
package, claiming many of the
documents and photos were
originals which should not leave
Stanford. Westerlind said in an
interview that most of the photos
