# 'Reach Out' is day of fun and service
## 
### Lisa Fitts 
Would you like to play games
with little children? Volunteer
at a rape crisis center? Make
sure that a homeless person
eats? This weekend, over 30
dormitories across campus will
spend a day showing their com
mitment to activities like these.
Saturday has been desig
nated as Reach Out Today â€”
the first major community
service project of the year.
Reach Out Today is an annual
event organized by the Stan
ford Volunteer Network (SVN).
While one purpose of Reach
Out Today is to help the com
munity, event organizers also
want to help cultivate a sense
of social consciousness at Stan
ford.
Sophomore Stace Beaulieu,
an event organizer, said she
hopes Reach Out Today will
"make Stanford students aware
of the problems surrounding us
in East Palo Alto and Menlo
Park and . . . make us realize
our ability to help others, while
having fun." Beaulieu said that
participants could promote fun
and enthusiasm by taking pic
tures and "just being them
selves."
Reach Out Today is usually
held on or near Halloween.
This year, however, the date
was moved up because of the
home football game on Hallow
een weekend. The earlier date
has caused some incon
veniences because many dorms
are not yet ready for a full-scale
dorm activity and some proj
ects traditionally have had a
Halloween theme.

The setbacks, however, have
not stopped over 30 dormitor
ies from participating in Reach
Out Today. Two such dorms
are Mirlo and Faisan.
Students from Mirlo will visit
a child development center,
where they will spend the day
with children between the ages
of two and six. The children
and Mirlo students will play
games and frost cupcakes to
gether. Marilyn Gray, Mirlo's
community service representa
tive, said she recognizes the im
portance of events like Reach
Out Today because the events
allow people who are afraid to
commit to community service
to get involved on a short-term
basis.
Mirlo was particularly enthu
siastic about attending the
child development center be
cause they enjoy working with
children, said Gray.
Students from Faisan will
visit the Channing Home, a
retired home for seniors where
several retired Stanford profes
sors are living. The students
will put on a talent show and
update the seniors on the latest
events on campus.
Coordinators hope Reach
Out Today will help remind the
Stanford community that there
is a world outside of Campus
Drive, and that students have
the power to make a difference.
It is the first of several com
munity service projects spon
sored by SVN. Future events
include the Holiday Sharing
Drive, Reach Out Today for
Valentine's Day, and Christmas
in April, an activity where the
students will build houses.
