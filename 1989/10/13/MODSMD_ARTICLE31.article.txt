# Renowned dancer uses movement as a form of therapy
## 
### Marli Marinelli 
Two dreamlike figures whirl across an
enormous stage in satin ballet slippers
to the strains of a haunting Tchaikovsky
melody.
The concept of "dance" might evoke
this image for many, yet the situation is
quite different in dance instruc
tor/choreographer Anna Halprin's classes.
There, the students perform passionately,
desperately, to the crushing reality of
their situation.
Every member of Halprin's class has
tested HIV positive for the AIDS virus.
They are not professional dancers, just
"regular" people. Monday, Oct. 16, Stan
ford students will have the chance to
observe Halprin's students in a presenta
tion entitled, "Movement Against AIDS,'
sponsored by Residential Education.
Halprin will speak and show a video

open to the public in the Elliot Program
Center at 7 p.m. The videotape will show
excerpts from "Circle the Earth," a per
formance given by people who either have
AIDS or cancer.
The structure will be loose and involve
audience participation, according to
Janice Ross, the Stanford dance instruc
tor who invited Halprin. Besides showing
the video, Halprin will also lecture on
her work with AIDS victims.
Ross, who is also a dance critic, said
the purpose of Halprin's workshops is to
use dance and movement to face one of
the most crucial problems of the '80s.
According to her, "One of the issues
about having AIDS is that people don't
touch you anymore, they don't hug you,
they don't get close to you. That's one
of the first things that movement does,
it bridges that gap."
Halprin, Founder and Director of San

Francisco's Tamalpa Dance Institute, is
heavily involved with the STEPS Theater
company, which sponsors the workshops
for people who have the AIDS virus. The
participants meet once or twice a week
and release themselves in the dance
movement. They are also encouraged to
use drawing and artwork as a means of
expression.
According to Ross, "You start drawing
pastel on paper images of what you think
the AIDS virus looks like in your body.
Next, (Halprin) will say, can you dance
that image? And she will tell you there
are people in the workshop whose red
blood cell count rose dramatically after
two weeks of doing the movement, be
cause it gave them an emotional and
physical lift not to feel so powerless any
more. One of the people that works with
her is the longest living survivor of AIDS
he's had AIDS for seven years now."

Nationally renowned for her talent,
Halprin has forced American society to
take note of her powerful statements
through her dancing, said Ross. In the
late '60s, she was among the first to
participate in controversial nude dancing.
"She's very unusual right now among
choreographers, in that she's always dealt
with social issues in dance, and she feels
very strongly that you don't just make
a dance, but you somehow relate to the
state of society and make efforts to
change it, or alert people to the need for
change," she said.
"I think (the program) will expand
minds, both toward issues about AIDS
and issues about dance," said Ross.
"Anna would be very open to start a new
chapter here, if there were interest. This
group is not just for the people with
AIDS, it is for the support network (they
need) also."
