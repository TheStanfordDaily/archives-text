## Stanford, WSU meet in injury bowl 
### Chris Crader Editorial staff 
This weekend marks the debut of a
new bowl game. No, it's not the Copper
Bowl. Nor is it the John Hancock Bowl.
In addition to the 18 bowl games that
exist already, Stanford and Washington
State will be playing a new one Saturday
night.
Welcome to the Backfield Injury
Bowl. Kickoff is at 7:30 p.m. tomorrow
at Martin Stadium in Pullman, Wash.,
and the game will be televised live on
ESPN.
Introductions are in order, first for
the visiting Cardinal. Stanford enters
tomorrow's game with a 1-4 overall
record, 1-2 in the Pacific 10 Conference.
Leading the way for Stanford are:
halfback Charlie Young, out for the year
with a knee injury; halfback Jay Jay
Lasley, out for at least another week
with a knee sprain; halfback Jon Volpe,
out for at least two weeks after under
going arthroscopic knee surgery Wed
nesday; quarterback Steve Smith, ques
tionable for tomorrow after spraining
his ankle at practice Wednesday; and
quarterback Brian Johnson, wlx) has
missed the last two games with an in
jured shoulder.
The home team, the Cougars, enter
the game with a 5-1 record, 2-1 in the
Pac-10. Topping their list is injured
quarterback Brad Gossen, out with a
thumb injury, and running back Rich
Swinton, who has missed their last four
games with a hamstring injury.
Despite the uncertainty caused by the
injuries, however, one thing is for sure:
there will be an awful lot of passes.
The Cougars have long been known
as a team that loves to throw the ball
and have thrown it for 265 yards per
game. For Stanford, Smith threw 68
passes against Notre Dame last week,
three short of the NCAA record. And
at a press conference this week, Stan
ford Coach Denny Green said the Car
dinal is going to throw the ball a lot
this week.
"We could go to midnight with us
throwing the ball and Stanford throw
ing the ball," Cougars Coach Mike Price
said. "It could be a four- or five-hour
marathon."

Throwing the ball for Washington
State will be redshirt freshman Aaron
Garcia, who began the year as the
starter on the WSU junior varsity team.
After leading the JV to a one-point won
over Walla Walla Community College,
Garcia was named the varsity's starter
when Brad Gossen went down with a
thumb injury.
In Gossen's absence Garcia has
thrown for 885 yards and seven touch
downs. "He's just playing great for us
right now," Price said. "For him to be
doing what he's doing right now is
amazing. He's only 18.
"His stature isn't that impressive.
You see him and you don't think he's
a college quarterback. Boy, inside he's
a giant of a kid."
Garcia will likely be without the serv
ices of the team's leading receiver, Tim
Stallworth, who has a knee injury. Gar
cia, however, will be able to throw and
hand off to Steve Broussard, who is
perhaps the top running back in the
Pac-10.
Broussard gained only 409 yards in
the Cougars' first five games, but ran

for 205 on a school-record 41 carries
against Oregon last weekend. "Steve
Broussard will play well whenever he
gets the ball," Price said. "He is every
thing an All-American should be."
If Broussard, who is also the Cougars
No. 2 receiver with 18 catches, continues
to put up the numbers he has, he will
be in line for such honors.
" Broussard's a great back, especially
on (artificial) turf," defensive tackle
Lester Archambeau said. "He can cut
on a dime and make a hole where there
isn't one."
In an effort to stop him and the
spread-out Cougar passing attack, Stan
ford has changed its defense yet again.
Stanford will likely play a lot of its
nickel defense, with five defensive backs,
and use only three linebackers. With
injuries to outside linebackers Rob
Hinckley and Bruce Lang, Charlie
Lough has been seeing a lot of time
with the first unit this week in practice.

the ball often against a Cougar defense

that usually plays eight men on
the line of scrimmage. "We're
going to have to throw the ball a
lot simply because of who we're
playing and how they commit to
stopping the rush," Green said.
"Our key is really first downs. We
want to be able to control the ball.
We do not want to have our de
fense on the field a long time."
While the Cougars are ranked
last in the Pac-10 in pass defense
at 320 yards per game, that statis
tic is a bit deceptive. Because of
the way the Cougars commit to
stopping the run, teams throw the
ball against them 44 times a
game, on the average.
Washington State leads the Pac
-10 in sacks with 33 in six games
and the team already has 17 in
terceptions, far and away the
league's most. In fact, the Cougars
are tops in the Pac-10, and 13th
nationally, in turnover margin at
plus 10. On the flip side, the Car
dinal is last in the league in turn
overs at minus 11.

" Broussard's a great back, especially
on (artificial) turf," defensive tackle
Lester Archambeau said. "He can cut
on a dime and make a hole where there
isn't one."
In an effort to stop him and the
spread-out Cougar passing attack, Stan
ford has changed its defense yet again.
Stanford will likely play a lot of its
nickel defense, with five defensive backs,
and use only three linebackers. With
injuries to outside linebackers Rob
Hinckley and Bruce Lang, Charlie
Lough has been seeing a lot of time
with the first unit this week in practice.

the ball often against a Cougar defense

that usually plays eight men on
the line of scrimmage. "We're
going to have to throw the ball a
lot simply because of who we're
playing and how they commit to
stopping the rush," Green said.
"Our key is really first downs. We
want to be able to control the ball.
We do not want to have our de
fense on the field a long time."
While the Cougars are ranked
last in the Pac-10 in pass defense
at 320 yards per game, that statis
tic is a bit deceptive. Because of
the way the Cougars commit to
stopping the run, teams throw the
ball against them 44 times a
game, on the average.
Washington State leads the Pac
-10 in sacks with 33 in six games
and the team already has 17 in
terceptions, far and away the
league's most. In fact, the Cougars
are tops in the Pac-10, and 13th
nationally, in turnover margin at
plus 10. On the flip side, the Car
dinal is last in the league in turn
overs at minus 11.
This weekend marks the debut of a
new bowl game. No, it's not the Copper
Bowl. Nor is it the John Hancock Bowl.
In addition to the 18 bowl games that
exist already, Stanford and Washington
State will be playing a new one Saturday
night.
Welcome to the Backfield Injury
Bowl. Kickoff is at 7:30 p.m. tomorrow
at Martin Stadium in Pullman, Wash.,
and the game will be televised live on
ESPN.
Introductions are in order, first for
the visiting Cardinal. Stanford enters
tomorrow's game with a 1-4 overall
record, 1-2 in the Pacific 10 Conference.
Leading the way for Stanford are:
halfback Charlie Young, out for the year
with a knee injury; halfback Jay Jay
Lasley, out for at least another week
with a knee sprain; halfback Jon Volpe,
out for at least two weeks after under
going arthroscopic knee surgery Wed
nesday; quarterback Steve Smith, ques
tionable for tomorrow after spraining
his ankle at practice Wednesday; and
quarterback Brian Johnson, wlx) has
missed the last two games with an in
jured shoulder.
The home team, the Cougars, enter
the game with a 5-1 record, 2-1 in the
Pac-10. Topping their list is injured
quarterback Brad Gossen, out with a
thumb injury, and running back Rich
Swinton, who has missed their last four
games with a hamstring injury.
Despite the uncertainty caused by the
injuries, however, one thing is for sure:
there will be an awful lot of passes.
The Cougars have long been known
as a team that loves to throw the ball
and have thrown it for 265 yards per
game. For Stanford, Smith threw 68
passes against Notre Dame last week,
three short of the NCAA record. And
at a press conference this week, Stan
ford Coach Denny Green said the Car
dinal is going to throw the ball a lot
this week.
"We could go to midnight with us
throwing the ball and Stanford throw
ing the ball," Cougars Coach Mike Price
said. "It could be a four- or five-hour
marathon."

Throwing the ball for Washington
State will be redshirt freshman Aaron
Garcia, who began the year as the
starter on the WSU junior varsity team.
After leading the JV to a one-point won
over Walla Walla Community College,
Garcia was named the varsity's starter
when Brad Gossen went down with a
thumb injury.
In Gossen's absence Garcia has
thrown for 885 yards and seven touch
downs. "He's just playing great for us
right now," Price said. "For him to be
doing what he's doing right now is
amazing. He's only 18.
"His stature isn't that impressive.
You see him and you don't think he's
a college quarterback. Boy, inside he's
a giant of a kid."
Garcia will likely be without the serv
ices of the team's leading receiver, Tim
Stallworth, who has a knee injury. Gar
cia, however, will be able to throw and
hand off to Steve Broussard, who is
perhaps the top running back in the
Pac-10.
Broussard gained only 409 yards in
the Cougars' first five games, but ran

for 205 on a school-record 41 carries
against Oregon last weekend. "Steve
Broussard will play well whenever he
gets the ball," Price said. "He is every
thing an All-American should be."
If Broussard, who is also the Cougars
No. 2 receiver with 18 catches, continues
to put up the numbers he has, he will
be in line for such honors.
" Broussard's a great back, especially
on (artificial) turf," defensive tackle
