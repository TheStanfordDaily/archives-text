SERIES — Stanford has won 10 of the last 12 meetings between the schools and leads
the overall series 22-18-1. The two the Cougars have won, however, have been wild
ones. Last year Stanford threw an interception with the ball on the WSU 2 and under
two minutes left in the game WSU held on to win 24-21. In 1984, Stanford led 42-14
at one point, but Rueben Mayes ran wild, and the Cougars posted a 49-42 come
from-behmd win
COUGAR UPDATE — Despite losing star quarterback Timm Rosenbach to the NFL after
his junior year and Coach Dennis Erickson to the Miami Hurricanes, WSU has
continued its roll from last year. The team's only loss came on a touchdown and a
two-point conversion with four seconds left against USC earlier this year WSU usually
has been a passing team, but running back Steve Broussard piled up 205 yards on
41 carries in the Cougars' 51-38 win over Oregon last week.
CARDINAL UPDATE — Stanford quarterback Steve Smith threw the ball 68 times last
week, three short of an NCAA record At this week's press conference, Coach Denny
Green said he plans to throw the ball a lot this week. Rumor has it the Cardinal is
going to throw the ball 100 times tomorrow.
