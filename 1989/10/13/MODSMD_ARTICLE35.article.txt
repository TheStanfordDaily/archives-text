# Card women look to boot Bears

The Big Game. The Big Splash. The Big Tradition.
In terms of "bigness," few of the athletic matchups
between California and Stanford in the past few
years have held the same weight as this weekend's
women's soccer matchup.
After hosting U.S. International at home Saturday,
the 19th-ranked Cardinal will find a stiff test in
the No. 15 Bears Sunday at Cal.
With the NCAA selection committee watching
intraregional games closely, Stanford (7-3) needs to
reverse a recent trend. As the Cardinal has slipped
down the national rankings recently, the Bears
slowly have been climbing back up. After reaching
the No. 3 spot early in the season, the Bears (10-2)
fell all the way to No. 18.
They lost a close game to No. 6 Santa Clara.
However, after falling to No. 12 St. Mary's 1-0 and
walloping UC-Davis 6-0, the Bears have snuck back
to the No. 15 spot. At the same time, Stanford lost
to three top-20 teams and took a nose dive from
No. 7 to No. 19.
"At this point, we need to win some games against
top-20 squads," Coach Berhane Andeberhan said.
Sunday at 4 p.m. at Strawberry Field, Stanford
will have an opportunity to notch up a top-20 victory
and, at the same time, jump ahead of the Bears.
Cal's backbone is senior All-American candidate

Joy Biefeld. By tallying up 13 goals and 7 assists
to lead the team this season, Biefeld has put her
name in Cal's record books. With 125 career points
and 51 career goals, she now is listed as Cal's career
point and career goal leader. Behind Biefeld, junior
Valerie Pope is this season's second leading scorer
with seven goals and one assist.
However, before taking the field against Cal, the
Cardinal will first need to take care of U.S. Inter
national at Harry Maloney Field Saturday at 10
a.m. A Cardinal loss undoubtedly will cause much
of the "bigness" of Sunday's contest to disappear.
After sparkling in the overtime of Saturday's game
against George Washington, the Cardinal has used
a week of practice to prepare for this weekend.
Freshman standout Julie Foudy, who scored twice
against George Washington, leads the team with 10
goals and 7 assists. Junior Jennifer Rowland, who
scored one against George Washington, has recorded
10 as well.
"Our goal for the last few games has been to be
ready to play at the opening whistle," Andeberhan
said. "We need to be ready in both these games."
