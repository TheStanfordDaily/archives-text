# Men host soccer tournament
## 
### Andrew Wilcox Staff writer 
After showing that it can com
pete with the top teams in the
country on their campuses, the
Cardinal men s soccer team
returns to the friendly confines
of Maloney Field for the first
time in a month to host Illinois
State and No. 1-ranked Virginia
in the Stanford Pacific-West
Classic this weekend.
The Cardinal, coming off
eight straight road games, will
face the Redbirds of Illinois
State tomorrow at 2 p.m. after
Virginia and San Francisco open
the tournament at noon. Stan
ford takes on the Cavaliers Sun
day at noon.
Consecutive 2-0 losses last
weekend dropped the Cardinal's
record to 6-6-1, but the second
of those defeats came in over
time to No. 2 UCLA.
"We've demonstrated that we
can play with the best," forward
Todd Caven said. "We've been

playing well together, but we
haven't been getting any breaks
and haven't been finalizing our
chances on offense."
The Cavaliers, who Cardinal
Coach Sam Koch said, "will be
the best team we play all year,"
stand at 13-1 on the year and
have outscored their opponents
43-4. But Virginia showed it was
mortal last week, losing 1-0 to
a mediocre Richmond squad.
"Man for man, they're a tre
mendous team. We've got to re
spect them but we also must

play our own game and not
worry too much about them.
We're definite underdogs," Koch
said.
Guiding the Cavaliers is soph
omore goalkeeper Tony Meola,
who doubles as goalie for the
U.S. National Team. Meola, an
All-American last year as a
freshman, has allowed a stingy
0.26 goals per game in eight
games this year, although his
action has been limited because
of his national team obligations.
The key to Virginia's offensive
prowess is lightning-fast coun
terattacks, which are instigated
by quick releases upfield by
Meola and junior sweeper Jeff
Agoos.
With all the hype surrounding
Virginia, the Cardinal must be
careful not to look past Illinois
State. The Redbirds, who have
so far been plagued by an ina
bility to win on the road, have
a 5-6 record and are led by
senior striker Alex Umansky.
