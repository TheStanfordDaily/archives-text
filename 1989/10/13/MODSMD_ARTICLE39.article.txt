. . the team's strategy has undergone
a marked change. The change has meant
a great deal of experimental lineups and
an uncharacteristic five early-season
losses. .."

September 29, 1986
The 1986 Stanford women's volleyball
team, after two disappointing season
ending losses in the two previous years'
NCAA championship matches, was beset
with early season injuries and hurt by the
graduation of star hitter Kim Oden. But
that year the Cardinal won 18 of its last
23 matches before losing in the semifinals
of the NCAAs and finishing third.
That year, two freshmen, Lara Asper
and Jennifer Chaffee, stepped into starting
roles and helped the Cardinal to a remark
able late-season run toward the title that,
even today, continues to elude it.
The 1989 Stanford women's volleyball
team would be very happy to duplicate the
relative success of the '86 squad. That
year's Cardinal team was the last to lose
three in a row and the last to fall from
Stanford's perennial contender status.
That is, until this year.
This year, Chaffee is struggling and
Aaper is it\jured. Two new freshman stars,
setter Carrie Feldman and hitter Bev Oden
(Kim's sister), have cracked the starting
rotation. This year, the Cardinal has lost

its Inst throe games to fall to 8-5 and is
now ranked eighth in the nation.
And, like 1986, this team has both the
spirit and the talent to overcome their cur
rent woes.
"These guys have a lot of pride and we've
got pride in our program," Stanford Coach
Don Shaw said. "We've had some tough
times. We've just got to keep battling back
and keep trying to improve every day.
"The wins and losses come and go. All
you can do is come into the gym, be ready
to go, give it your best shot and walk out
satisfied. I think all of our players are
doing that right now," Shaw said.
Stanford will take another shot at ending
their current losing streak tonight against
the ninth-ranked Arizona Wildcats. Al
though Arizona shares Stanford's 4-3
Pacific 10 Conference record, the Wildcats
have steadily climbed in the polls with a
12-4 record. The Cardinal, however, has
won the last 14 matches and only lost once

Freshman Carrie Feldman will try to set the Cardinal out of its
present three-game losing streak tomorrow night.
