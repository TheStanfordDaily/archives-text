# SAIO debunks Columbus Day
## 
### Quan Phung Staff writer 
"In 1492, Columbus sailed the
ocean blue, and that was it." At
least, that was how the Stanford
American Indian Organization
depicted the discovery of America
yesterday at White Plaza.
Proclaiming Columbus Day as
"Re-Discovery Day", about 35
SAIO members gathered for a
brief speech and an Indian flute
music program at noon, hoping
to dispel the Eurocentric view that
Columbus discovered a vacant and
barren land.
SAIO member Nyleta Belgarde,
a sophomore, said the event was
"oriented toward American Indian
students" because Columbus Day
is "kind of a bad day for us as a
people."

"Indian cultures and civiliza
tions have evolved and thrived in
North and South America for
thousands of years," said Brian
Baker, a graduate student in
sociology who spoke at the event.
"It is as though if it weren't for
Columbus, our ancestors would
not have known where they were.
Actually, they knew where they
were; it was Columbus that didn't
know where he was."
In addition to the program in
White Plaza, SAIO members hung
banners late Wednesday night on
buildings around campus, renam
ing Old Union "House of Red
Tape" and White Plaza "Bad
Smelling Meadow."
"We have renamed campus
buildings because it symbolizes
what was done to our ancestors,"
Baker explained. "Not only were

they renamed, removed, and re
located, but their whole way of
life was transformed and replaced
by another culture and civiliza
tion."
However, most students did not
see the banners because they were
taken down before 9 a.m. yester
day, presumably by University
maintenance workers.
Belgarde admitted she was
slightly disappointed that the
signs weren't seen by more stu
dents.
However, the original goal was
not to stage an all-out protest of
Columbus' birthday, Belgarde
said, but to show that Native
Americans were not "passive
players" in the discovery of
America. In this respect, the event
was successful, she said.
