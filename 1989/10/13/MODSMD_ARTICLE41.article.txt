As the Stanford men's golf team hosts today's
first round of the U.S. Intercollegiate at the Stanford
Golf Club, the squad strives to fill its only remaining
deficiency: consistency.
Stanford's play in the final round of last week's
Butler National Invitational demonstrates this po
tentially troublesome weakness. The team's disap
pointing performance dropped the squad from sixth
to eighth place in its inaugural event of the fall
campaign.
While expressing satisfaction with the overall
showing, Coach Wally Goodwin was not pleased with
the final day of the tournament. "We played poorly
when we had to play well," Goodwin said.
The U.S. Intercollegiate provides Stanford with
an immediate opportunity for redemption. The 54-
hole event got underway yesterday with an informal
practice round and banquet.
Striving to capitalize on its home course advan
tage, the team is led by sophomore Christian Cevaer.
Based on his outstanding freshman season and
second-place finish at Butler, Cevaer is considered
among the favorites to claim individual honors this
weekend. Goodwin succinctly assessed Cevaer's
chances: "I can categorically say that he has the
golf game and mental attitude to win every tour
nament he plays this year."
Somewhat surprisingly, Cevaer showed little in
terest in his role as a potential winner. "I don't
care if I'm a favorite. I concentrate on playing the
course and the rest takes care of itself," he said.
Cevaer is joined hv seniors Brad Benbrook, Don
Christiansen, Marc Funseth, junior transfer Johan
Hemmeglaa, and redshirt freshman Chris Doble
The Cardinal it part of a 13 team field which
includes powers such as Duke, Illinois, Oregon and
Rice.
