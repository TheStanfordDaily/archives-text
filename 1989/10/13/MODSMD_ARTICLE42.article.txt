# Trojans, Waves splash onto Farm

### T.C. Hall Staff writer 
Rising just so you can fall later
is no one's idea of a good time.
After being the preseason No.
1 pick and then failing to a No.
5 ranking, the Stanford water polo
team is ranked third going into
this weekend's matches against
USC and Pepperdine. But the
Stanford coaching staff has mixed
reactions about the team's No. 3
rank.
"Rankings don't matter much
now," Assistant Coach Matt
Tingler said. "The NCAA tourna
ment is important. If you aren't
in the top three when the NCAAs
roll around, you're in trouble."
Coach Dante Dettamanti sees
things a little differently. "I'd
rather be in the top three now
and stay there," he said.
Both men agree, however, that
winning this weekend's two
matches is crucial to the team's
continued success.
"We cannot afford to lose to
teams that are ranked below us,"
Tingler said.

'We have to make
sure to take away
the hole's back
hand shot. To do
that, we need to
move our man over
to cover better.'

The two matches against USC
and Pepperdine should provide a
good test of the team's mettle.
The Cardinal beat USC by only
one goal a week ago and Pepper
dine shelled Stanford 10-4 in the
Irvine tournament earlier this
season.
The key to the USC game will
be an adjustment in the hole.
"The hole scored four goals in
the last game," Dettamanti said.
"We have to make sure to take
away the hole's backhand shot. To
do that, we need to move our man

over to cover better."
In terms of the two-meter po
sition, the Waves come into the
match with an international flair,
touting both the Australian Olym
pic team's high scorer and a mem
ber of the Yugoslav national team.
Both men are over 6-foot-6.
"We have to take away their
threat in the hole," Dettamanti
said. "We might have to use a
collapsing defense on the two
meter man where we initially
press, but then fall back to con
centrate on the inside."
The weekend marks the begin
ning of the Cardinal's Pac-10
season. According to Dettamanti,
a win over USC would give the
Cardinal an edge in the Pacific
10 race, the winner of which gets
an automatic berth to the NCAA
tournament.
