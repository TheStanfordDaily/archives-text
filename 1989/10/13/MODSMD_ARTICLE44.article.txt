### John Louie Staff writer 
With playoff hopes slowly be
ginning to fade, the Stanford
women's field hockey team looks
at tomorrow's match against
Chico State with a vengeance.
In their last meeting, the Car
dinal battled the Wildcats to a
double-overtime, 0-0 tie. A victory
over Chico would not only keep
hopes for postseason play alive but
also ease the team's frustrations
over their past standoff.
"If we can beat Chico, it
definitely will be a personal vic
tory," co-captain Beth Lewinger
said. "If we just play our own
game, we'll have a good chance."
The team's exceptional defen
sive play this season has been
overshadowed by a lack of scoring
from the offense. Stanford, 1-4-2
overall and 1-1-2 in the Northern
Pacific Conference, scored its last
goal against lowa, almost an en
tire month ago.

"We can't seem to convert in
the circle," midfielder Clare Step
hens said. "If we can just get that
one extra step, we should give
Chico a run for its money."
Stanford plans to combat Chico
State's aggressive style by playing
a solid all-around game.
"Chico is not fun to play be
cause they are brutish, loud, and
rough. We have to keep focused,"
Stephens said.
Coach Sheryl Johnson added,
"We'll just have to play our pass
ing game around them."
"We will have to play all out
tomorrow," Stephens said. "We're
running out of chances to prove
to the league that we have some
tricks up our sleeve."
