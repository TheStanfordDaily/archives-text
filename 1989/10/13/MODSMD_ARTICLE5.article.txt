# Z-particle study confirms theory
## 
### Dan Cory 
Physicists at the Stanford
Linear Accelerator Center yester
day announced a discovery
that places extreme limits on the
number of basic building blocks
of the universe.
Studying the heaviest known
elementary particle, dubbed the
Z, SLAC physicists say they have
now confirmed — with 25-to-l
odds — that there are exactly
three families of fundamental par
ticles. Theorists have often ques
tioned how many fundamental
particles exist, although three,
four or five are predicted by the
Standard Model, the theory
governing particle physics.
The finding is a stunning
achievement for the innovative
$115 million Stanford Linear Col
lider, which has discovered 500 Z
particles since April.
SLAC apparently beat the main
European particle physics labora
tory, known as CERN, in a high
stakes, high-tech race to study the
Z particle and verify the Standard
Model. CERN has not yet an
nounced the results of their Z ex
periments, but the laboratory is
expected soon to surpass the pre
cision of SLAC's results.
A team at CERN led by Carlo
Rubbia, winner of the 1984 Nobel
Prize in Physics, found the first
Z particle and proposed the $1.1
billion LEP, a 17-mile circum
ference circular collider, to
produce more.
The technology to build LEP is
well understood, and construction
was not expected to pose many
problems. At the same time, SLAC
decided to modify the existing
two-mile long linear accelerator,
finishing the $115 million collider
in 1987, two years ahead of LEP.
However, the Stanford collider
used technology never before

tried. The power and accuracy of
the magnets in the accelerator
had to be better than anything
previously built. A critical prob
lem was the necessity squeezing
enough particles into a small space
to ensure a collision.
On April 11, SLAC found its
first Z particle. Since then, 500 Z
particles have been detected at
SLAC. Meanwhile CERN finally
started producing Z particles
reliably three weeks ago.
In an article submitted yester
day to the journal Physical Review
Letters, the scientists reported the
average lifetime of the Z particle
as one trillionth of a trillionth of
a second, thereby determining the
number of families of particles.
The Z particle research con
firms the Standard Model, the
theory of high-energy physics that
explains the connection between
electricity, magnetism, and the
weak nuclear force responsible for
radioactivity and other phenom
ena.
Cosmologists know that huge
numbers of Z particles were
produced in less than a second
after the Big Bang, and the
amount of helium left in the uni
verse after the decay of these Z
particles supposedly narrowed the
number of families to exactly
three or four.
The Standard Model also ex
plains the existence of two types
of particles: quarks and leptons.
The quarks, building blocks for
protons, neutrons and other par
ticles, fall into three families of
two quarks each. The leptons, in
cluding the electron, positron and
similar particles fall into three
similar families of four each.
However, the Standard Model
could not prove that these three
families were the only possible
families. The Stanford results
demonstrate that they are.
