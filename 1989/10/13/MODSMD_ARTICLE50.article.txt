# Netters begin season at Rolex

### Forrester Johnson 
Stanford's 1989-90 men's ten
nis team will debut today in the
Rolex Division I Regional Tennis
Championships at Cal State-
Hayward.
Although three of their top
players, freshman Jonathan
Stark, freshman Jared Palmer
and senior Jeff Cathrall, will not
be competing, Stanford still
sends second-seeded Alex
O'Brien and fourth-seeded
Alexis Hombrecher to the tour
nament.
O'Brien and Hombrecher,
ranked 23rd and 38th in the
nation, also are seeded second
in doubles. Barry Richards and
Eric Peus go in as the fourth

seeded doubles team, while
Glenn Solomon and Jason Yee
are the lone unseeded Cardinal
entries.
After only a week of practice,
the tournament looms as a ques
tion mark. "It's tough to know
what these guys will do because
we don't play a lot of matches
in the fall," Assistant Coach
John Whitlinger said. "We
mainly try to work on our
players' games, looking for im
provement."
Much more than improve
ment is at stake this weekend,
though, as the singles and dou
bles winners move on to Min
neapolis for the Rolex National
Indoors in February.
After winning three of the last

four national championships,
Stanford is the preseason pick
to finish on top again, despite
losing Martin Blackman, David
Wheaton and JefT Tarango to
the professional circuit. With
one of the best groups of fresh
men in the nation — including
Hombrecher, Stark and Palmer
— the Cardinal placed four
players in the preseason top-50
rankings and is eager to defend
the national title.
"We're anxious to play," Whit
linger said. "Guys nowdays are
so competitive. We're dying to
get out there and play tough
matches."
This weekend, against the
likes of California, the team will
get that chance.
