# Chen sees interpreted Stanford

Editor's note: This is the final
article of a four-part series on
the experiences of individuals
with disabilities at Stanford.

Junior Teddy Chen made a
resolution at the start of the
school year.
"I told myself that I was going
to work harder this year, and
part of that is paying more at
tention in class," he said.

However, Chen does not in
tend to give his full attention to
his professors. In fact, his gaze
will probably be fixed on some
one else in the room. Chen will
be watching his oral interpreter.
Chen has a hearing impair
ment that he describes as "bor
derline between severe and
profound, or stone deaf." Al
though he can hear to a certain
degree and can read lips, he uses
an interpreter in class who "lis
tens to what is said and then
forms the words without voicing
them," he explains.
He adds that there is a dif
ference between deaf and
hearing-impaired people. Al
though Chen's hearing is im
paired, he can understand cer
tain voices and has no trouble
understanding his parents, even
on the phone.
The Disability Resource Cen
ter runs a program that allows
hearing-impaired students to
choose their own interpreters â€”
"the people [theyl understand
the best," Chen says. The DRC
then helps train them in oral
interpretation.

Until he transferred to Stan
ford last fall, Chen had never
used an interpreter.
As a freshman at the Massa
chusetts Institute of Technolo
gy, he had difficulty finding an
oral interpreter. And, in high
school, he says he did not want
to have an interpreter because
he was too self-conscious about
his disability
"High school is a very cliquey
place," he says. "Image is very
important. I did not want an
interpreter because it would be

a direct acknowledgment of my
hearing impairment, and I
would stand out."
Although Chen says he has
"become more self-confident"
since high school, he adds,
"Every time I have a new class
I feel uncomfortable, but it goes
away."
Although oral interpreters
help Chen with some of his
classes, the system is not per
fect. He explains that there is

his professors.
a "time lag" of up to 10 seconds,
which makes it difficult to use an
interpreter during discussion sec
tions.
"By the time the interpreter
had told me what was going on
and I thought of something to
say, they'd already be going on to
another topic," Chen says of his
Western Culture section last year.
Because of the time problem, he
decided not to use the interpreter
for the section.
Problems also occur during lec
tures, because the interpreter can
not always repeat everything that
is said.
"A lot of times last year I had
trouble with material that was in
lecture, but not in the book," he
says. "But I never said anything
to the professor because I don't
want to ask for special attention.
"I like to do everything on the
same basis as everyone else. I
don't want special favors. It's very
important for my self-respect to
feel that I'm being treated as an
equal," he explains.
As a high school senior, Chen
decided to choose a university
where he could prove he was equal
in ability to hearing students. He
considered the Rochester Insti
tute of Technology because they
had a program for deaf students,
he says.

"But then I said, 'I don't need
to go to a lesser school just be
cause of my hearing impairment.'
I didn't want it to limit me," Chen
says.
"One of the reasons I went to
MIT instead of Stanford was be
cause, as far as I knew, I would
have been one of the first deaf
students there," he says."I went
to MIT to be unique, rather than
one of a group," he says.
While at MIT, Chen did not
meet any other deaf students and
says he does not know whether
any were enrolled. This "unique
ness" had positive and negative
aspects, he says.
"It was good in terms of my
pride, but bad in terms of other
people misunderstanding deaf
ness," he says.
"At MIT, it seemed like some
people thought, 'You got in here
because you're deaf.' Some people
assume that you can't hear any
thing, and others think you are
less intelligent. They're very old
stereotypes."
Chen says he does not encoun
ter these attitudes at Stanford,
but adds that problems created
by his hearing impairment were
not the reason he transferred
here.
"At MIT, there is just too much
work and too much pressure," he
says.
Although he is happy with the
services he now receives at Stan
ford, he says he does not feel a

part of the deaf community.
"I'm more a part of the hearing
world than the deaf world. They
have their own culture, their own
language with a different syntax
and grammar than English. I've
met some deaf people, but I didn't
really relate to them," he says.
"I wish that I had learned sign
language a long time ago. I don't
need to know it. I want to know
it. It would be nice to communi
cate with other deaf people be
cause I've really had very little
contact with them," he says.
Chen is also planning to act as
a mentor for a new deaf student
in a program run by the DRC.
"I'm trying not to get involved in
too many things," he says."I
don't want to spread myself too
thin because I'd really like to get
A's this quarter.
"There are adaptations that I
have to make and I've hit some
bumps, but I haven't run into any
walls yet," Chen says."I think
my type of disability is less limit
ing than other types."
However, Chen says his dis
ability does limit him in the way
people view him.
"I'd really rather be seen as a
person who has a hearing impair
ment than a hearing-impaired per
son," he says. "They have differ
ent connotations. I want people
to see me first as a person, not
to immediately think, 'He's deaf.'
I would like people to think, 'He
just can't hear as well as I do.' "
