Editor's note: This is the final
article of a four-part series on
the experiences of individuals
with disabilities at Stanford.

Junior Teddy Chen made a
resolution at the start of the
school year.
"I told myself that I was going
to work harder this year, and
part of that is paying more at
tention in class," he said.

However, Chen does not in
tend to give his full attention to
his professors. In fact, his gaze
will probably be fixed on some
one else in the room. Chen will
be watching his oral interpreter.
Chen has a hearing impair
ment that he describes as "bor
derline between severe and
profound, or stone deaf." Al
though he can hear to a certain
degree and can read lips, he uses
an interpreter in class who "lis
tens to what is said and then
forms the words without voicing
them," he explains.
He adds that there is a dif
ference between deaf and
hearing-impaired people. Al
though Chen's hearing is im
paired, he can understand cer
tain voices and has no trouble
understanding his parents, even
on the phone.
The Disability Resource Cen
ter runs a program that allows
hearing-impaired students to
choose their own interpreters â€”
"the people [theyl understand
the best," Chen says. The DRC
then helps train them in oral
interpretation.

Until he transferred to Stan
ford last fall, Chen had never
used an interpreter.
As a freshman at the Massa
chusetts Institute of Technolo
gy, he had difficulty finding an
oral interpreter. And, in high
school, he says he did not want
to have an interpreter because
he was too self-conscious about
his disability
"High school is a very cliquey
place," he says. "Image is very
important. I did not want an
interpreter because it would be

a direct acknowledgment of my
hearing impairment, and I
would stand out."
Although Chen says he has
"become more self-confident"
since high school, he adds,
"Every time I have a new class
I feel uncomfortable, but it goes
away."
Although oral interpreters
help Chen with some of his
classes, the system is not per
fect. He explains that there is

Junior Tod Chen plans to concentrate more on academics this
year, but his eyes will be focused on his interpreter rather than
his professors.
