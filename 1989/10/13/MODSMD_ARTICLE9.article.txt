# Cal prof. stresses need for ethnic studies

### Wendie Schneider 
UC-Berkeley Prof, of Ethnic
Studies Ronald Takaki challenged
a capacity audience in Branner
Hall last night to locate a solution
for racism by embracing ethnic
studies as part of the curriculum
at Stanford.
"This is a moment for tremen
dous and exciting change in the
university," Takaki said. "We can
be on the cutting edge of educa

tion in the 21st century by be
coming multicultural."
The continuing dilemma of rac
ism was made poignantly clear
when, after the speech, over half
the overwhelmingly Asian-
American audience raised their
hands in response to a question
about whether they had been vic
tims of harassment.
Takaki, the grandson of im
migrant Japanese plantation
workers, shared personal experi-

ences of racial harassment to il
lustrate his point that the current
educational system leaves Asian-
Americans rootless "strangers
from a distant shore."
"Scholars themselves," Takaki
said, "have contributed to this ig
norance. The idea of Eurocentric
cultural literacy serves no one. It
is not good history."
Takaki's speech comes in the
midst of preparations for hiring
a professor to teach Asian-
American studies at Stanford.

The University agreed to create
the long-sought post in the wake
of the occupation of the Presi
dent's Office last spring, and of
ficials hope to have the position
filled by the fall of 1990.
Takaki recently published a his
tory of Asian-Americans entitled
"Strangers from a Distant Shore,"
which has been nominated for a
Pulitzer Prize. His book examines
the experience of Asian immi
grants and their descendants in
the United States.
