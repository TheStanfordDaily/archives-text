Adobe Systems Incorporated is one of the most progressive companies in the Silicon
Valley. As we continue to move into the future, we're challenging the rules, expanding
the boundaries of software technology beyond their current levels. We haven't settled
for simply defining the industry, in fact, we've developed a standard of our own.
To date, over 60 manufacturers have
made our PostScript® language a part of
their printers and there are more than
4000 software products that support it.
And our Display PostScript® system and
Adobe Type Manager" extend our
PostScript language into the next genera
tion of electronic printing and display
systems.
Adobe has also developed Adobe Illustra
tor 88", a sophisticated PostScript lan
guage application for both PC and
Macintosh computing environments, 4
and we recently introduced True Form",
a forms processing software package for
the Macintosh. Meanwhile, our Font
Development Group is aggressively
pursuing additions to our already im
pressive typeface library.
Each of our employees plays a critical
role in our continued success, profitabil
ity and market leadership. We're all
proud of what we've accomplished.
We've created the market, established
the standard, and made an historical
impact on the electronic printing and
publishing industry.
We know you have standards and expec
tations of your own. If you'd like to be
part of our continuing search for excel
lence, we'd like to meet with you and
discuss these opportunities in detail.
