# Obscene phone calls prevalent, 'paralyzing' at Stanford
##

Editor's note: The following article
contains graphic language that may be
offensive to some readers.

Two weeks ago when "Karen," a
senior, walked into her off-campus house
after attending a meeting at the Lesbian,
Gay and Bisexual Community Center,
the phone was ringing.
None of her housemates was home,
so she answered it.
The male caller asked for her by her
full name, which had been announced
at the meeting, and began quizzing her.
"How old are you?" he said. "Do you
have a boyfriend? Have you ever dated
a man?"
Then he asked, "Wouldn't you like to
be fucked by a man?"
Karen hung up.
The problem of obscene and harassing
phone calls, like the one Karen received,
is widespread on campus, Stanford
Police Chief Marvin Herrington says.
But the majority of calls are not reported
to the police or the University, he adds.
This year to date, 34 people have re

ported harassing phone calls to Stanford
Police. Last year, 28 reports were made.
Over the last 10 years, from 1979 to
1988, Stanford Police have received 254
complaints of harassing phone calls, an
average of 25 per year.
Of those calls reported to the Stanford
Police, the caller usually says something
threatening or sexual, Herrington says.
Less often, the caller says nothing and
remains on the line until the victim
hangs up.
According to Herrington, most
obscene and harassing calls are received
by women.
"I was really scared," Karen says."I
didn't know who to tell. I had the feeling
he knew who 1 was, and I was home
alone."
Karen decided to tell a female friend
about the incident but did not report it
to the police. "I thought about calling
the police, but I didn't want to go
through the hassle of reporting it."
Karen says it is very hard to tell
people about the call. "People don't want
to tell anyone because they're afraid
they'll be brushed off," she explains. "I
don't think people realize how paralyz
ing a call like that can be."

'I was really scared. I didn't know who to tell. I
had the feeling he knew who I was, and I was
home alone.'

For two days following the call, Karen
found she was still very upset and
afraid. Her housemates, who she says
were very supportive, answered the
phone saying, "Hello, Stanford Police
Department, can I help you?"

When "Jessica's" friend answered an
ad for a room for rent posted at Tres
idder Union, Jessica, a junior, had no
idea of the harassment that would fol
low.
After speaking on the phone with the
man who placed the ad, Jessica's friend
decided he was too "weird" and did not
rent the room from him.
After her friend left, however, the man
continued to call, asking first for her
friend and then talking with Jessica.
"He'd say things like, 'You sound real
cute. I want to get to know you. Do you

want to come over?' "
A few days later he called more than
five times between 5 and 10 p.m. After
the first call, Jessica decided not to an
swer the phone and let her answering
machine take the call.
Filling the entire answering machine
tape, he said things such as, "How
would you like to come over, live here
rent-free, in exchange for your services?"
As the night went on, his calls became
more frustrated and angry, Jessica says.
His comments became obscene, saying,
"I want to make love with you. Come
on, sex isn't bad," and he threatened
Jessica, demanding to speak with her
inperson.
"He just kept calling, leaving the same
obscene messages," Jessica recalls. In
one message, he said, "I have fro yo all
over me and I want you to come over
and eat it off."

After two days, Jessica took action.
"Finally I said to him, 7 talked to the
phone company, I have your phone num
ber and I'll call the police and press
charges.' " After that, he didn't call back.
In fact, harassing phone calls fall un
der California Penal Code Section 653-
M, "Telephone calls with intent to
annoy." Violators of this law are guilty
of a misdemeanor, which carries a max
imum punishment of $500 and/or one
year in the county jail.
"The punishment could be probation
or a fine or anything," Herrington ex
plains. "A misdemeanor has a wide dis
cretion."
Jessica says she had always heard
about obscene calls, but she never
thought she would get one. "At first I
thought, 'This is ridiculous,' but then I
started to get scared."
Jessica says she doesn't know what
the man wanted from her. "I don't know
if he was lonely or deprived," she says.
"I think he must have really been hur
ting for a girlfriend."
She is now very relieved that the calls
have stopped, but she is afraid he
will call someone else, she says.
The frightening thing, Jessica
says, is that anyone could get a
call like the one she received.
"Anyone could have a card posted
at Tresidder. You never know
what you can run into."
She added that she is "kind of
disillusioned now" and she will
think twice before talking with
people she doesn't know.

At the beginning of her fresh
man year, "Sarah," who gradu
ated in June, began receiving
obscene phone calls.
In the first call, the young male
caller asked for her by name and
said he knew who she was.
Then the caller said, "I want
to masturbate with you. I want
you to touch yourself."
Sarah hung up.
After a few more obscene calls,
she called the police and gave
them her story. At her dormitory's
house meeting, she announced
that the police were searching for
the caller.
After that night, the calls
stopped until the end of fall quar
ter. Once, after pulling an "all
nighter," she walked from the
dorm study room to her room at
5 a.m.
When she walked into her room,
the phone began ringing. She
picked it up.
When she heard the same voice
on the line, she says, she knew
the caller had to be from her dorm.
Only someone watching from
within her dorm could have seen
her return to her room. Her name
and phone number were not listed
with the University or with Pacific
Bell.
After that incident, the calls
stopped.
Sarah says if she knew who the
man was, she would want to take
action against him. "The least I
would do would be to have the
police confront him to let him
know," she says. She would also
consider making a report to the
University.
Obscene and threatening phone
calls can also violate the Funda
mental Standard, according to
Alice Bender, assistant to the Of
fice of Judicial Affairs.
This year's newly revised hand
book of Student Conduct Policies
states that "Leaving threatening
and obscene messages on the tele

phone answering system of an
other student" is an example of
a Fundamental Standard viola
tion.
This addition to the guidebook
results from a recent case in which
a male undergraduate was
suspended for four quarters be
cause he left three anonymous
telephone messages on the
answering machine of a female
undergraduate.
The tone and content of the
messages were "obscene, threat
ening and violent," according to a
letter written by Judicial Affairs
Officer Sally Cole. In addition, the
messages named three undergrad
uate men and suggested they were
party to the calls. In fact, the men
did not know about the calls.
In a letter to University Pres
ident Donald Kennedy, former As
st. Dean of Student Affairs Joseph
Pisano wrote, "The messages are
not merely insulting in general
tone but also make graphic
threats of sexual violence includ
ing rape and sodomy."
After reviewing the case and
listening to a copy of the tape,
Kennedy seriously considered im
posing an indefinite suspension
on the student, according to a let
ter written by Kennedy. However,
because of Pisano's recommenda
tion and because the student
promised to reform and seek
counseling, Kennedy decided not
to take such a severe step.
Based on the "ugliness" of the
case — including the "appalling"
messages, the "trauma" inflicted
on the woman who received the
messages and the "anxiety" the
three men felt for being accused
— Kennedy decided to increase
Pisano's recommendation of a
three-quarter suspension to a
four-quarter suspension.
Diana Conklin, director of res
idential deans, recommends that
if students are receiving obscene
or harassing calls, they know who
is making the calls and they have
proof, they should report the in
cident to the Judicial Affairs Of
fice.
"If you can really nail the per
son, it is worthwhile," she says.
"It's a suspendable offense."
Jack Chin, resident dean for
Branner Hall, Toyon Hall and the
Row, points out, however, that it
is difficult to pursue a case with
out hard evidence. "It can really
be frustrating and really have a
dampening effect on the student,"
he says."It comes down to one
person's word against another's."
It is difficult to apply a formal
policy to cases of phone harass
ment, Chin says.

After the first series of calls,
Sarah says she was very scared.
"He knew who I was and I didn't
know who he was. I was really
afraid to go out at night, to ride
my bike anywhere at night. But
I had to because I had a class at
night once a week."
The call at the end of the quar
ter annoyed her very much. "But
I wasn't as scared because I knew
he couldn't do anything to me,"
she says.

When "Liz" answered her phone
the night before classes began this
quarter, she thought someone had
gotten the wrong number.
The caller hung up.
Half a minute later, the phone
rang again.
She answered the phone.
Again the caller hung up.
At first Liz didn't give the calls
a second thought. But when the
calls came again at 2:30 and 3
a.m., she began to think about it.
"I just thought someone was
screwing around," she says."I did
not know what was going on."
The next night, Wednesday, at
exactly 1:30 a.m., 2:30 a.m. and
3 a.m., the series of two calls were
repeated. Again there was no com
munication between Liz and the
caller.
On Thursday, Liz got none of
the anonymous calls but when the
nighttime'pattern repeated again
on Friday, Saturday and Sunday,
Liz began to worry.
"By Friday and Saturday, I
realized what was happening,"
Liz remembers. "I thought, 'This
is weird.' "
Her first reaction was to talk
to the caller. "I wanted to say,
'What's going on?' " But the caller
hang up before she had a chance
to say anything.
Her second reaction was "to
freak him out, to scare him, to
intimidate him." Liz had a male
friend answer the phone, but the
calls persisted.
On Monday, Liz called Pacific
Bell and had her phone number
changed. Her number is currently
listed with both the University and
Pacific Bell. The calls have since
stopped.
Liz did not call the police.
The response to confront the
caller is a natural one, Herrington
says. However, the best advice is
to avoid any verbal communica
tion with the caller.
Residential Affairs, the Stan
ford Police and Pacific Bell have
a wide range of advice for dealing
with harassing phone calls. Most
importantly, they stress the im
portance of not responding to the
caller.
"Crank callers get no satisfac
tion if there is no response," Chin
says. "Don't say anything, just
hang up. They get their jollies
from talking to you."
Herrington notes that harass
ing callers don't want anything
specific, they just want to talk
with someone. "Just hang up,"
he says.
An easy and effective way of
dealing with disturbing calls is to
let an answering machine answer
the phone and screen the calls. A
machine allows a call receiver to
avoid talking directly to the caller.
If the caller leaves a message, the
police can later make a voice print
of the call and use it as evidence
against a suspect, according to
Herrington.
In many cases, he says, callers
give up if they cannot talk with
someone.
Although Liz says the calls she
received were not "too freaky,"
they were disturbing and scary
because they were so uniform and
consistent.
She says she was also frustrated
by the persistent calls. "It's sad
to know people have to resort to
such tactics in order to have some
one to talk with them," she says.

Last year when the ringing of
the phone awoke "Jenny" in the

middle of the night, she answered
it. The caller immediately hung
up.
When these calls continued,
Jenny, then a junior, decided to
pull her phone out of the wall.
Once during spring quarter,
after Jenny decided to reconnect
the phone, the phone rang at 5:30
a.m. The caller asked for "Jen
nifer, " although nobody calls her
by her full name.
The caller then said, "This is
a pervert. I'm perverted. I'm hot
for you. I'm all hot." After a few
more sexual comments, Jenny
hung up.
During the next few days she
received calls during the night
and early morning. The caller
usually hung up immediately or
remained on the line until Jenny
hung up.
"I was really scared," Jenny re
members. She says she was afraid
to leave her first-floor single,
though she didn't feel safe there
either. "I was scared to go to the
bathroom. I didn't want to leave
the room."
When school ended, Jenny
moved to another campus resi
dence for the summer but kept the
same phone number. The calls
continued, so she called the police
and let people know she had done
so.
The calls stopped and have not
resumed.
Both Chin and Conklin stress
the importance of reporting the
calls to the residential deans and
the police.
"Others may be getting calls,
so it's important to report them,"
Chin says."I would encourage
people to pursue action because
it can stop calls or make the per
son change his or her behavior."
In addition, Conklin says, the
seven residential deans meet
weekly and share information. If
a caller is making calls to more
than one phone on campus, the
deans may be able to notice a
pattern that can help find the
caller.

'People don't want to tell anyone be
cause they're afraid they'll be brushed
off. I don't think people realize how
paralyzing a call like that can be.'

According to Herri ngton, when
people call the police, an officer
is assigned to take a report. "We
try to get the specifics," he says.
"We will question the victims be
cause they are most likely to know
if there is some conflict in their
lives to trigger this."
After that, he said, they wait
and see. In aggravated cases, Her
rington recommends people
change their phone numbers. He
does not recommend this often,
however, because it is a disruption
to the victim. "We try to minimize
the disruption to the victim's life
as much as possible."
Judy Peterson, media manager
for Pacific Bell, also recommends
hanging up, but if calls continue,
she suggests setting a phone trap
for the caller.
By calling the Pacific Bell busi
ness office, a person receiving
harassing calls can set up a trap
at no charge. The calls will be
traced by Pacific Bell. When the
harassing caller calls, the victim
records the day and time of the
call and immediately reports it to
the business office.
Pacific Bell then goes through
the calls and matches the phone
number with the reported call.
With the phone number, Pacific
Bell can find out where the calls
are coming from.
"It's an effective method in
most cases and we do contact the
police," Peterson says.
The most frightening part,
Jenny says, is the feeling of help
lessness that comes with not
knowing. "You don't know who it
is, whether to take it personally

or whether it is a random call."
Like Liz, Jenny says "it's sad
to think someone would get off
in scaring someone else."
Jenny, however, suspects she
was the target of political harass
ment and believes she knows the
group of people responsible for
the calls and sexual comments. As
a member of a minority commu
nity, she voiced her opposition to
other members of the community
at a meeting. As a result, she
feels, she was harassed and in
timidated over the phone.
"I was scared of the people I
thought were doing it because it
was sick how far they were going."
While she told her boyfriend
and a male friend about the calls,
she did not tell her resident as

sistant or resident fellows because
they also were involved in the
heated political debate and did not
share Jenny's views.

"Amy," who attended the same
meeting as Jenny, started receiv
ing hang-up calls during the same
week Jenny did.
One day, however, Amy, then a
junior transfer, heard children's
voices saying obscene and slang
words in Amy's native language.
While Amy speaks the language
at home, few people know that.
She says it sounded as if there
was a female adult in the back
ground telling the children what
to say. The voices repeated the
words 'whore' and 'slut' over and
over in her native language.
In the second call a male voice
asked for her by name and then
was silent. She hung up.
The third call reached the level
of threats. A man "warned me to
be careful because he knew where
I lived. He said he knew I had a
single," she remembers. Again,
the calls were in her native lan
guage.
When the school year ended, the
calls ended. Now Amy does not
go to the minority group meetings.
Amy didn't report the calls to
anyone nor did she tell friends.
"I didn't report it. I didn't know
where to go to," she recalls. "I
thought somebody just didn't like
me so I didn't do anything."
Chin encourages people who
receive harassing calls to seek
counseling from friends, resident
assistants and fellows, deans,

Counseling and Psychological
Services and the Bridge.
"There is a feeling of being
threatened and power being taken
away from you," Chin says. "It's
important for a person to regain
a sense of empowerment."
Students can also get counseling
from the Office of the Om
budsperson. While Asst. Om
budsperson Carmen Jevons has
never dealt with a phone harass
ment case, she says students are
always welcome to come talk
about their concerns. "It just
doesn't occur to people to come
to this office," Jevons says.
Amy remembers being really
frightened by the calls. "I didn't
go anywhere for a couple weeks
at night," she says. "I thought
somebody didn't like me person
ally."
She says it's an awful feeling
"when someone calls you at home
and speaks in your language. It's
worse that way."
Amy was so bothered by the
calls that this year she considered
withholding her name from the
Pacific Bell directory and from
University information. But in
the end, she deciced to list her
number in both places.

Last year when "Melissa," now
a senior, answered the phone, she
thought she was participating in
a consumer survey for a shoe com
pany. The male caller asked her
shoe size, the type of shoes she
wears everyday and the kind of
shoes she wears for dressy occa
sions. Melissa answered these
questions honestly.
Then he asked her, "What kind
of shoes do you fuck in?"
Melissa immediately hung up
the phone. The man never called
again.
Melissa thinks the caller ran
domly picked her name out of the
phone book.
Peterson recommends that
women list a first initial rather
than a full name in the Pacific
Bell directory and avoid listing
the address.
Unlisted numbers are obviously
the most effective way of prevent
ing random calls, she said. A num
ber that is not listed in the
directory costs 15 cents per
month. Keeping the number out
of directory assistance costs an
other 15 cents per month.
"I was really annoyed," Melissa
says. "You get flustered when
someone calls. You have your
routine and suddenly someone
enters it and breaks it up."
She adds that she really felt
gullible when she answered the
questions. "He sounded so legit."


Tracking the calls
During the years 1979 through 1988, Stanford Police received
254 reports of obscene or harassing phone calls — an average
of 25 per year. This year, 34 complaints have been received
already.

night once a week."
The call at the end of the quar
ter annoyed her very much. "But
I wasn't as scared because I knew
he couldn't do anything to me,"
she says.

When "Liz" answered her phone
the night before classes began this
quarter, she thought someone had
gotten the wrong number.
The caller hung up.
Half a minute later, the phone
rang again.
She answered the phone.
Again the caller hung up.
At first Liz didn't give the calls
a second thought. But when the
calls came again at 2:30 and 3
a.m., she began to think about it.
"I just thought someone was
screwing around," she says."I did
not know what was going on."
The next night, Wednesday, at
exactly 1:30 a.m., 2:30 a.m. and
3 a.m., the series of two calls were
repeated. Again there was no com
munication between Liz and the
caller.
On Thursday, Liz got none of
the anonymous calls but when the
nighttime'pattern repeated again
on Friday, Saturday and Sunday,
Liz began to worry.
"By Friday and Saturday, I
realized what was happening,"
Liz remembers. "I thought, 'This
is weird.' "
Her first reaction was to talk
to the caller. "I wanted to say,
'What's going on?' " But the caller
hang up before she had a chance
to say anything.
Her second reaction was "to
freak him out, to scare him, to
intimidate him." Liz had a male
friend answer the phone, but the
calls persisted.
On Monday, Liz called Pacific
Bell and had her phone number
changed. Her number is currently
listed with both the University and
Pacific Bell. The calls have since
stopped.
Liz did not call the police.
The response to confront the
caller is a natural one, Herrington
says. However, the best advice is
to avoid any verbal communica
tion with the caller.
Residential Affairs, the Stan
ford Police and Pacific Bell have
a wide range of advice for dealing
with harassing phone calls. Most
importantly, they stress the im
portance of not responding to the
caller.
"Crank callers get no satisfac
tion if there is no response," Chin
says. "Don't say anything, just
hang up. They get their jollies
from talking to you."
Herrington notes that harass
ing callers don't want anything
specific, they just want to talk
with someone. "Just hang up,"
he says.
An easy and effective way of
dealing with disturbing calls is to
let an answering machine answer
the phone and screen the calls. A
machine allows a call receiver to
avoid talking directly to the caller.
If the caller leaves a message, the
police can later make a voice print
of the call and use it as evidence
against a suspect, according to
Herrington.
In many cases, he says, callers
give up if they cannot talk with
someone.
Although Liz says the calls she
received were not "too freaky,"
they were disturbing and scary
because they were so uniform and
consistent.
She says she was also frustrated
by the persistent calls. "It's sad
to know people have to resort to
such tactics in order to have some
one to talk with them," she says.

Last year when the ringing of
the phone awoke "Jenny" in the

middle of the night, she answered
it. The caller immediately hung
up.
When these calls continued,
Jenny, then a junior, decided to
pull her phone out of the wall.
Once during spring quarter,
after Jenny decided to reconnect
the phone, the phone rang at 5:30
a.m. The caller asked for "Jen
nifer, " although nobody calls her
by her full name.
The caller then said, "This is
a pervert. I'm perverted. I'm hot
for you. I'm all hot." After a few
more sexual comments, Jenny
hung up.
During the next few days she
received calls during the night
and early morning. The caller
usually hung up immediately or
remained on the line until Jenny
hung up.
"I was really scared," Jenny re
members. She says she was afraid
to leave her first-floor single,
though she didn't feel safe there
either. "I was scared to go to the
bathroom. I didn't want to leave
the room."
When school ended, Jenny
moved to another campus resi
dence for the summer but kept the
same phone number. The calls
continued, so she called the police
and let people know she had done
so.
The calls stopped and have not
resumed.
Both Chin and Conklin stress
the importance of reporting the
calls to the residential deans and
the police.
"Others may be getting calls,
so it's important to report them,"
Chin says."I would encourage
people to pursue action because
it can stop calls or make the per
son change his or her behavior."
In addition, Conklin says, the
seven residential deans meet
weekly and share information. If
a caller is making calls to more
than one phone on campus, the
deans may be able to notice a
pattern that can help find the
caller.

'People don't want to tell anyone be
cause they're afraid they'll be brushed
off. I don't think people realize how
paralyzing a call like that can be.'

According to Herri ngton, when
people call the police, an officer
is assigned to take a report. "We
try to get the specifics," he says.
"We will question the victims be
cause they are most likely to know
if there is some conflict in their
lives to trigger this."
After that, he said, they wait
and see. In aggravated cases, Her
rington recommends people
change their phone numbers. He
does not recommend this often,
however, because it is a disruption
to the victim. "We try to minimize
the disruption to the victim's life
as much as possible."
Judy Peterson, media manager
for Pacific Bell, also recommends
hanging up, but if calls continue,
she suggests setting a phone trap
for the caller.
By calling the Pacific Bell busi
ness office, a person receiving
harassing calls can set up a trap
at no charge. The calls will be
traced by Pacific Bell. When the
harassing caller calls, the victim
records the day and time of the
call and immediately reports it to
the business office.
Pacific Bell then goes through
the calls and matches the phone
number with the reported call.
With the phone number, Pacific
Bell can find out where the calls
are coming from.
"It's an effective method in
most cases and we do contact the
police," Peterson says.
The most frightening part,
Jenny says, is the feeling of help
lessness that comes with not
knowing. "You don't know who it
is, whether to take it personally

or whether it is a random call."
Like Liz, Jenny says "it's sad
to think someone would get off
in scaring someone else."
Jenny, however, suspects she
was the target of political harass
ment and believes she knows the
group of people responsible for
the calls and sexual comments. As
a member of a minority commu
nity, she voiced her opposition to
other members of the community
at a meeting. As a result, she
feels, she was harassed and in
timidated over the phone.
"I was scared of the people I
thought were doing it because it
was sick how far they were going."
While she told her boyfriend
and a male friend about the calls,
she did not tell her resident as

sistant or resident fellows because
they also were involved in the
heated political debate and did not
share Jenny's views.

"Amy," who attended the same
meeting as Jenny, started receiv
ing hang-up calls during the same
week Jenny did.
One day, however, Amy, then a
junior transfer, heard children's
voices saying obscene and slang
words in Amy's native language.
While Amy speaks the language
at home, few people know that.
She says it sounded as if there
was a female adult in the back
ground telling the children what
to say. The voices repeated the
words 'whore' and 'slut' over and
over in her native language.
In the second call a male voice
asked for her by name and then
was silent. She hung up.
The third call reached the level
of threats. A man "warned me to
be careful because he knew where
I lived. He said he knew I had a
single," she remembers. Again,
the calls were in her native lan
guage.
When the school year ended, the
calls ended. Now Amy does not
go to the minority group meetings.
Amy didn't report the calls to
anyone nor did she tell friends.
"I didn't report it. I didn't know
where to go to," she recalls. "I
thought somebody just didn't like
me so I didn't do anything."
Chin encourages people who
receive harassing calls to seek
counseling from friends, resident
assistants and fellows, deans,

Counseling and Psychological
Services and the Bridge.
"There is a feeling of being
threatened and power being taken
away from you," Chin says. "It's
important for a person to regain
a sense of empowerment."
Students can also get counseling
from the Office of the Om
budsperson. While Asst. Om
budsperson Carmen Jevons has
never dealt with a phone harass
ment case, she says students are
always welcome to come talk
about their concerns. "It just
doesn't occur to people to come
to this office," Jevons says.
Amy remembers being really
frightened by the calls. "I didn't
go anywhere for a couple weeks
at night," she says. "I thought
somebody didn't like me person
ally."
She says it's an awful feeling
"when someone calls you at home
and speaks in your language. It's
worse that way."
Amy was so bothered by the
calls that this year she considered
withholding her name from the
Pacific Bell directory and from
University information. But in
the end, she deciced to list her
number in both places.

Last year when "Melissa," now
a senior, answered the phone, she
thought she was participating in
a consumer survey for a shoe com
pany. The male caller asked her
shoe size, the type of shoes she
wears everyday and the kind of
shoes she wears for dressy occa
sions. Melissa answered these
questions honestly.
Then he asked her, "What kind
of shoes do you fuck in?"
Melissa immediately hung up
the phone. The man never called
again.
Melissa thinks the caller ran
domly picked her name out of the
phone book.
Peterson recommends that
women list a first initial rather
than a full name in the Pacific
Bell directory and avoid listing
the address.
Unlisted numbers are obviously
the most effective way of prevent
ing random calls, she said. A num
ber that is not listed in the
directory costs 15 cents per
month. Keeping the number out
of directory assistance costs an
other 15 cents per month.
"I was really annoyed," Melissa
says. "You get flustered when
someone calls. You have your
routine and suddenly someone
enters it and breaks it up."
She adds that she really felt
gullible when she answered the
questions. "He sounded so legit."


Tracking the calls
During the years 1979 through 1988, Stanford Police received
254 reports of obscene or harassing phone calls — an average
of 25 per year. This year, 34 complaints have been received
already.
Editor's note: The following article
contains graphic language that may be
offensive to some readers.

Two weeks ago when "Karen," a
senior, walked into her off-campus house
after attending a meeting at the Lesbian,
Gay and Bisexual Community Center,
the phone was ringing.
None of her housemates was home,
so she answered it.
The male caller asked for her by her
full name, which had been announced
at the meeting, and began quizzing her.
"How old are you?" he said. "Do you
have a boyfriend? Have you ever dated
a man?"
Then he asked, "Wouldn't you like to
be fucked by a man?"
Karen hung up.
The problem of obscene and harassing
phone calls, like the one Karen received,
is widespread on campus, Stanford
Police Chief Marvin Herrington says.
But the majority of calls are not reported
to the police or the University, he adds.
This year to date, 34 people have re

ported harassing phone calls to Stanford
Police. Last year, 28 reports were made.
Over the last 10 years, from 1979 to
1988, Stanford Police have received 254
complaints of harassing phone calls, an
average of 25 per year.
Of those calls reported to the Stanford
Police, the caller usually says something
threatening or sexual, Herrington says.
Less often, the caller says nothing and
remains on the line until the victim
hangs up.
According to Herrington, most
obscene and harassing calls are received
by women.
"I was really scared," Karen says."I
didn't know who to tell. I had the feeling
he knew who 1 was, and I was home
alone."
Karen decided to tell a female friend
about the incident but did not report it
to the police. "I thought about calling
the police, but I didn't want to go
through the hassle of reporting it."
Karen says it is very hard to tell
people about the call. "People don't want
to tell anyone because they're afraid
they'll be brushed off," she explains. "I
don't think people realize how paralyz
ing a call like that can be."

'I was really scared. I didn't know who to tell. I
had the feeling he knew who I was, and I was
home alone.'

For two days following the call, Karen
found she was still very upset and
afraid. Her housemates, who she says
were very supportive, answered the
phone saying, "Hello, Stanford Police
Department, can I help you?"

When "Jessica's" friend answered an
ad for a room for rent posted at Tres
idder Union, Jessica, a junior, had no
idea of the harassment that would fol
low.
After speaking on the phone with the
man who placed the ad, Jessica's friend
decided he was too "weird" and did not
rent the room from him.
After her friend left, however, the man
continued to call, asking first for her
friend and then talking with Jessica.
"He'd say things like, 'You sound real
cute. I want to get to know you. Do you

want to come over?' "
A few days later he called more than
five times between 5 and 10 p.m. After
the first call, Jessica decided not to an
swer the phone and let her answering
machine take the call.
Filling the entire answering machine
tape, he said things such as, "How
would you like to come over, live here
rent-free, in exchange for your services?"
As the night went on, his calls became
more frustrated and angry, Jessica says.
His comments became obscene, saying,
"I want to make love with you. Come
on, sex isn't bad," and he threatened
Jessica, demanding to speak with her
inperson.
"He just kept calling, leaving the same
obscene messages," Jessica recalls. In
one message, he said, "I have fro yo all
over me and I want you to come over
and eat it off."

After two days, Jessica took action.
"Finally I said to him, 7 talked to the
phone company, I have your phone num
ber and I'll call the police and press
charges.' " After that, he didn't call back.
In fact, harassing phone calls fall un
der California Penal Code Section 653-
M, "Telephone calls with intent to
annoy." Violators of this law are guilty
of a misdemeanor, which carries a max
imum punishment of $500 and/or one
year in the county jail.
"The punishment could be probation
or a fine or anything," Herrington ex
plains. "A misdemeanor has a wide dis
cretion."
Jessica says she had always heard
about obscene calls, but she never
thought she would get one. "At first I
thought, 'This is ridiculous,' but then I
started to get scared."
Jessica says she doesn't know what
the man wanted from her. "I don't know
if he was lonely or deprived," she says.
"I think he must have really been hur
ting for a girlfriend."
She is now very relieved that the calls
have stopped, but she is afraid he
will call someone else, she says.
The frightening thing, Jessica
says, is that anyone could get a
call like the one she received.
"Anyone could have a card posted
at Tresidder. You never know
what you can run into."
She added that she is "kind of
disillusioned now" and she will
think twice before talking with
people she doesn't know.

At the beginning of her fresh
man year, "Sarah," who gradu
ated in June, began receiving
obscene phone calls.
In the first call, the young male
caller asked for her by name and
said he knew who she was.
Then the caller said, "I want
to masturbate with you. I want
you to touch yourself."
Sarah hung up.
After a few more obscene calls,
she called the police and gave
them her story. At her dormitory's
house meeting, she announced
that the police were searching for
the caller.
After that night, the calls
stopped until the end of fall quar
ter. Once, after pulling an "all
nighter," she walked from the
dorm study room to her room at
5 a.m.
When she walked into her room,
the phone began ringing. She
picked it up.
When she heard the same voice
on the line, she says, she knew
the caller had to be from her dorm.
Only someone watching from
within her dorm could have seen
her return to her room. Her name
and phone number were not listed
with the University or with Pacific
Bell.
After that incident, the calls
stopped.
Sarah says if she knew who the
man was, she would want to take
action against him. "The least I
would do would be to have the
police confront him to let him
know," she says. She would also
consider making a report to the
University.
Obscene and threatening phone
calls can also violate the Funda
mental Standard, according to
Alice Bender, assistant to the Of
fice of Judicial Affairs.
This year's newly revised hand
book of Student Conduct Policies
states that "Leaving threatening
and obscene messages on the tele

phone answering system of an
other student" is an example of
a Fundamental Standard viola
tion.
This addition to the guidebook
results from a recent case in which
a male undergraduate was
suspended for four quarters be
cause he left three anonymous
telephone messages on the
answering machine of a female
undergraduate.
The tone and content of the
messages were "obscene, threat
ening and violent," according to a
letter written by Judicial Affairs
Officer Sally Cole. In addition, the
messages named three undergrad
uate men and suggested they were
party to the calls. In fact, the men
did not know about the calls.
In a letter to University Pres
ident Donald Kennedy, former As
st. Dean of Student Affairs Joseph
Pisano wrote, "The messages are
not merely insulting in general
tone but also make graphic
threats of sexual violence includ
ing rape and sodomy."
After reviewing the case and
listening to a copy of the tape,
Kennedy seriously considered im
posing an indefinite suspension
on the student, according to a let
ter written by Kennedy. However,
because of Pisano's recommenda
tion and because the student
promised to reform and seek
counseling, Kennedy decided not
to take such a severe step.
Based on the "ugliness" of the
case — including the "appalling"
messages, the "trauma" inflicted
on the woman who received the
messages and the "anxiety" the
three men felt for being accused
— Kennedy decided to increase
Pisano's recommendation of a
three-quarter suspension to a
four-quarter suspension.
Diana Conklin, director of res
idential deans, recommends that
if students are receiving obscene
or harassing calls, they know who
is making the calls and they have
proof, they should report the in
cident to the Judicial Affairs Of
fice.
"If you can really nail the per
son, it is worthwhile," she says.
"It's a suspendable offense."
Jack Chin, resident dean for
Branner Hall, Toyon Hall and the
Row, points out, however, that it
is difficult to pursue a case with
out hard evidence. "It can really
be frustrating and really have a
dampening effect on the student,"
he says."It comes down to one
person's word against another's."
It is difficult to apply a formal
policy to cases of phone harass
ment, Chin says.

After the first series of calls,
Sarah says she was very scared.
"He knew who I was and I didn't
know who he was. I was really
afraid to go out at night, to ride
my bike anywhere at night. But
I had to because I had a class at
night once a week."
The call at the end of the quar
ter annoyed her very much. "But
I wasn't as scared because I knew
he couldn't do anything to me,"
she says.

at night," she says. "I thought
somebody didn't like me person
ally."
She says it's an awful feeling
"when someone calls you at home
and speaks in your language. It's
worse that way."
Amy was so bothered by the
calls that this year she considered
withholding her name from the
Pacific Bell directory and from
University information. But in
the end, she deciced to list her
number in both places.

Last year when "Melissa," now
a senior, answered the phone, she
thought she was participating in
a consumer survey for a shoe com
pany. The male caller asked her
shoe size, the type of shoes she
wears everyday and the kind of
shoes she wears for dressy occa
sions. Melissa answered these
questions honestly.
Then he asked her, "What kind
of shoes do you fuck in?"
Melissa immediately hung up
the phone. The man never called
again.
Melissa thinks the caller ran
domly picked her name out of the
phone book.
Peterson recommends that
women list a first initial rather
than a full name in the Pacific
Bell directory and avoid listing
the address.
Unlisted numbers are obviously
the most effective way of prevent
ing random calls, she said. A num
ber that is not listed in the
directory costs 15 cents per
month. Keeping the number out
of directory assistance costs an
other 15 cents per month.
"I was really annoyed," Melissa
says. "You get flustered when
someone calls. You have your
routine and suddenly someone
enters it and breaks it up."
She adds that she really felt
gullible when she answered the
questions. "He sounded so legit."


Tracking the calls
During the years 1979 through 1988, Stanford Police received
254 reports of obscene or harassing phone calls — an average
of 25 per year. This year, 34 complaints have been received
already.
Editor's note: The following article
contains graphic language that may be
offensive to some readers.

Two weeks ago when "Karen," a
senior, walked into her off-campus house
after attending a meeting at the Lesbian,
Gay and Bisexual Community Center,
the phone was ringing.
None of her housemates was home,
so she answered it.
The male caller asked for her by her
full name, which had been announced
at the meeting, and began quizzing her.
"How old are you?" he said. "Do you
have a boyfriend? Have you ever dated
a man?"
Then he asked, "Wouldn't you like to
be fucked by a man?"
Karen hung up.
The problem of obscene and harassing
phone calls, like the one Karen received,
is widespread on campus, Stanford
Police Chief Marvin Herrington says.
But the majority of calls are not reported
to the police or the University, he adds.
This year to date, 34 people have re

ported harassing phone calls to Stanford
Police. Last year, 28 reports were made.
Over the last 10 years, from 1979 to
1988, Stanford Police have received 254
complaints of harassing phone calls, an
average of 25 per year.
Of those calls reported to the Stanford
Police, the caller usually says something
threatening or sexual, Herrington says.
Less often, the caller says nothing and
remains on the line until the victim
hangs up.
According to Herrington, most
obscene and harassing calls are received
by women.
"I was really scared," Karen says."I
didn't know who to tell. I had the feeling
he knew who 1 was, and I was home
alone."
Karen decided to tell a female friend
about the incident but did not report it
to the police. "I thought about calling
the police, but I didn't want to go
through the hassle of reporting it."
Karen says it is very hard to tell
people about the call. "People don't want
to tell anyone because they're afraid
they'll be brushed off," she explains. "I
don't think people realize how paralyz
ing a call like that can be."

'I was really scared. I didn't know who to tell. I
had the feeling he knew who I was, and I was
home alone.'

For two days following the call, Karen
found she was still very upset and
afraid. Her housemates, who she says
were very supportive, answered the
phone saying, "Hello, Stanford Police
Department, can I help you?"

When "Jessica's" friend answered an
ad for a room for rent posted at Tres
idder Union, Jessica, a junior, had no
idea of the harassment that would fol
low.
After speaking on the phone with the
man who placed the ad, Jessica's friend
decided he was too "weird" and did not
rent the room from him.
After her friend left, however, the man
continued to call, asking first for her
friend and then talking with Jessica.
"He'd say things like, 'You sound real
cute. I want to get to know you. Do you

want to come over?' "
A few days later he called more than
five times between 5 and 10 p.m. After
the first call, Jessica decided not to an
swer the phone and let her answering
machine take the call.
Filling the entire answering machine
tape, he said things such as, "How
would you like to come over, live here
rent-free, in exchange for your services?"
As the night went on, his calls became
more frustrated and angry, Jessica says.
His comments became obscene, saying,
"I want to make love with you. Come
on, sex isn't bad," and he threatened
Jessica, demanding to speak with her
inperson.
"He just kept calling, leaving the same
obscene messages," Jessica recalls. In
one message, he said, "I have fro yo all
over me and I want you to come over
and eat it off."

After two days, Jessica took action.
"Finally I said to him, 7 talked to the
phone company, I have your phone num
ber and I'll call the police and press
charges.' " After that, he didn't call back.
In fact, harassing phone calls fall un
der California Penal Code Section 653-
M, "Telephone calls with intent to
annoy." Violators of this law are guilty
of a misdemeanor, which carries a max
imum punishment of $500 and/or one
year in the county jail.
"The punishment could be probation
or a fine or anything," Herrington ex
plains. "A misdemeanor has a wide dis
cretion."
Jessica says she had always heard
about obscene calls, but she never
thought she would get one. "At first I
thought, 'This is ridiculous,' but then I
started to get scared."
Jessica says she doesn't know what
the man wanted from her. "I don't know
if he was lonely or deprived," she says.
"I think he must have really been hur
ting for a girlfriend."
She is now very relieved that the calls
have stopped, but she is afraid he
will call someone else, she says.
The frightening thing, Jessica
says, is that anyone could get a
call like the one she received.
"Anyone could have a card posted
at Tresidder. You never know
what you can run into."
She added that she is "kind of
disillusioned now" and she will
think twice before talking with
people she doesn't know.

At the beginning of her fresh
man year, "Sarah," who gradu
ated in June, began receiving
obscene phone calls.
In the first call, the young male
caller asked for her by name and
said he knew who she was.
Then the caller said, "I want
to masturbate with you. I want
you to touch yourself."
Sarah hung up.
After a few more obscene calls,
she called the police and gave
them her story. At her dormitory's
house meeting, she announced
that the police were searching for
the caller.
After that night, the calls
stopped until the end of fall quar
ter. Once, after pulling an "all
nighter," she walked from the
dorm study room to her room at
5 a.m.
When she walked into her room,
the phone began ringing. She
picked it up.
When she heard the same voice
on the line, she says, she knew
the caller had to be from her dorm.
Only someone watching from
within her dorm could have seen
her return to her room. Her name
and phone number were not listed
with the University or with Pacific
Bell.
After that incident, the calls
stopped.
Sarah says if she knew who the
man was, she would want to take
action against him. "The least I
would do would be to have the
police confront him to let him
know," she says. She would also
consider making a report to the
University.
Obscene and threatening phone
calls can also violate the Funda
mental Standard, according to
Alice Bender, assistant to the Of
fice of Judicial Affairs.
This year's newly revised hand
book of Student Conduct Policies
states that "Leaving threatening
and obscene messages on the tele

phone answering system of an
other student" is an example of
a Fundamental Standard viola
tion.
This addition to the guidebook
results from a recent case in which
a male undergraduate was
suspended for four quarters be
cause he left three anonymous
telephone messages on the
answering machine of a female
undergraduate.
The tone and content of the
messages were "obscene, threat
ening and violent," according to a
letter written by Judicial Affairs
Officer Sally Cole. In addition, the
messages named three undergrad
uate men and suggested they were
party to the calls. In fact, the men
did not know about the calls.
In a letter to University Pres
ident Donald Kennedy, former As
st. Dean of Student Affairs Joseph
Pisano wrote, "The messages are
not merely insulting in general
tone but also make graphic
threats of sexual violence includ
ing rape and sodomy."
After reviewing the case and
listening to a copy of the tape,
Kennedy seriously considered im
posing an indefinite suspension
on the student, according to a let
ter written by Kennedy. However,
because of Pisano's recommenda
tion and because the student
promised to reform and seek
counseling, Kennedy decided not
to take such a severe step.
Based on the "ugliness" of the
case — including the "appalling"
messages, the "trauma" inflicted
on the woman who received the
messages and the "anxiety" the
three men felt for being accused
— Kennedy decided to increase
Pisano's recommendation of a
three-quarter suspension to a
four-quarter suspension.
Diana Conklin, director of res
idential deans, recommends that
if students are receiving obscene
or harassing calls, they know who
is making the calls and they have
proof, they should report the in
cident to the Judicial Affairs Of
fice.
"If you can really nail the per
son, it is worthwhile," she says.
"It's a suspendable offense."
Jack Chin, resident dean for
Branner Hall, Toyon Hall and the
Row, points out, however, that it
is difficult to pursue a case with
out hard evidence. "It can really
be frustrating and really have a
dampening effect on the student,"
he says."It comes down to one
person's word against another's."
It is difficult to apply a formal
policy to cases of phone harass
ment, Chin says.

After the first series of calls,
Sarah says she was very scared.
"He knew who I was and I didn't
know who he was. I was really
afraid to go out at night, to ride
my bike anywhere at night. But
I had to because I had a class at
night once a week."
The call at the end of the quar
ter annoyed her very much. "But
I wasn't as scared because I knew
he couldn't do anything to me,"
she says.

When "Liz" answered her phone
the night before classes began this
quarter, she thought someone had
gotten the wrong number.
The caller hung up.
Half a minute later, the phone
rang again.
She answered the phone.
Again the caller hung up.
At first Liz didn't give the calls
a second thought. But when the
calls came again at 2:30 and 3
a.m., she began to think about it.
"I just thought someone was
screwing around," she says."I did
not know what was going on."
The next night, Wednesday, at
exactly 1:30 a.m., 2:30 a.m. and
3 a.m., the series of two calls were
repeated. Again there was no com
munication between Liz and the
caller.
On Thursday, Liz got none of
the anonymous calls but when the
nighttime'pattern repeated again
on Friday, Saturday and Sunday,
Liz began to worry.
"By Friday and Saturday, I
realized what was happening,"
Liz remembers. "I thought, 'This
is weird.' "
Her first reaction was to talk
to the caller. "I wanted to say,
'What's going on?' " But the caller
hang up before she had a chance
to say anything.
Her second reaction was "to
freak him out, to scare him, to
intimidate him." Liz had a male
friend answer the phone, but the
calls persisted.
On Monday, Liz called Pacific
Bell and had her phone number
changed. Her number is currently
listed with both the University and
Pacific Bell. The calls have since
stopped.
Liz did not call the police.
The response to confront the
caller is a natural one, Herrington
says. However, the best advice is
to avoid any verbal communica
tion with the caller.
Residential Affairs, the Stan
ford Police and Pacific Bell have
a wide range of advice for dealing
with harassing phone calls. Most
importantly, they stress the im
portance of not responding to the
caller.
"Crank callers get no satisfac
tion if there is no response," Chin
says. "Don't say anything, just
hang up. They get their jollies
from talking to you."
Herrington notes that harass
ing callers don't want anything
specific, they just want to talk
with someone. "Just hang up,"
he says.
An easy and effective way of
dealing with disturbing calls is to
let an answering machine answer
the phone and screen the calls. A
machine allows a call receiver to
avoid talking directly to the caller.
If the caller leaves a message, the
police can later make a voice print
of the call and use it as evidence
against a suspect, according to
Herrington.
In many cases, he says, callers
give up if they cannot talk with
someone.
Although Liz says the calls she
received were not "too freaky,"
they were disturbing and scary
because they were so uniform and
consistent.
She says she was also frustrated
by the persistent calls. "It's sad
to know people have to resort to
such tactics in order to have some
one to talk with them," she says.

Last year when the ringing of
the phone awoke "Jenny" in the

middle of the night, she answered
it. The caller immediately hung
up.
When these calls continued,
Jenny, then a junior, decided to
pull her phone out of the wall.
Once during spring quarter,
after Jenny decided to reconnect
the phone, the phone rang at 5:30
a.m. The caller asked for "Jen
nifer, " although nobody calls her
by her full name.
The caller then said, "This is
a pervert. I'm perverted. I'm hot
for you. I'm all hot." After a few
more sexual comments, Jenny
hung up.
During the next few days she
received calls during the night
and early morning. The caller
usually hung up immediately or
remained on the line until Jenny
hung up.
"I was really scared," Jenny re
members. She says she was afraid
to leave her first-floor single,
though she didn't feel safe there
either. "I was scared to go to the
bathroom. I didn't want to leave
the room."
When school ended, Jenny
moved to another campus resi
dence for the summer but kept the
same phone number. The calls
continued, so she called the police
and let people know she had done
so.
The calls stopped and have not
resumed.
Both Chin and Conklin stress
the importance of reporting the
calls to the residential deans and
the police.
"Others may be getting calls,
so it's important to report them,"
Chin says."I would encourage
people to pursue action because
it can stop calls or make the per
son change his or her behavior."
In addition, Conklin says, the
seven residential deans meet
weekly and share information. If
a caller is making calls to more
than one phone on campus, the
deans may be able to notice a
pattern that can help find the
caller.

'People don't want to tell anyone be
cause they're afraid they'll be brushed
off. I don't think people realize how
paralyzing a call like that can be.'

According to Herri ngton, when
people call the police, an officer
is assigned to take a report. "We
try to get the specifics," he says.
"We will question the victims be
cause they are most likely to know
if there is some conflict in their
lives to trigger this."
After that, he said, they wait
and see. In aggravated cases, Her
rington recommends people
change their phone numbers. He
does not recommend this often,
however, because it is a disruption
to the victim. "We try to minimize
the disruption to the victim's life
as much as possible."
Judy Peterson, media manager
for Pacific Bell, also recommends
hanging up, but if calls continue,
she suggests setting a phone trap
for the caller.
By calling the Pacific Bell busi
ness office, a person receiving
harassing calls can set up a trap
at no charge. The calls will be
traced by Pacific Bell. When the
harassing caller calls, the victim
records the day and time of the
call and immediately reports it to
the business office.
Pacific Bell then goes through
the calls and matches the phone
number with the reported call.
With the phone number, Pacific
Bell can find out where the calls
are coming from.
"It's an effective method in
most cases and we do contact the
police," Peterson says.
The most frightening part,
Jenny says, is the feeling of help
lessness that comes with not
knowing. "You don't know who it
is, whether to take it personally

or whether it is a random call."
Like Liz, Jenny says "it's sad
to think someone would get off
in scaring someone else."
Jenny, however, suspects she
was the target of political harass
ment and believes she knows the
group of people responsible for
the calls and sexual comments. As
a member of a minority commu
nity, she voiced her opposition to
other members of the community
at a meeting. As a result, she
feels, she was harassed and in
timidated over the phone.
"I was scared of the people I
thought were doing it because it
was sick how far they were going."
While she told her boyfriend
and a male friend about the calls,
she did not tell her resident as

sistant or resident fellows because
they also were involved in the
heated political debate and did not
share Jenny's views.

"Amy," who attended the same
meeting as Jenny, started receiv
ing hang-up calls during the same
week Jenny did.
One day, however, Amy, then a
junior transfer, heard children's
voices saying obscene and slang
words in Amy's native language.
While Amy speaks the language
at home, few people know that.
She says it sounded as if there
was a female adult in the back
ground telling the children what
to say. The voices repeated the
words 'whore' and 'slut' over and
over in her native language.
In the second call a male voice
asked for her by name and then
was silent. She hung up.
The third call reached the level
of threats. A man "warned me to
be careful because he knew where
I lived. He said he knew I had a
single," she remembers. Again,
the calls were in her native lan
guage.
When the school year ended, the
calls ended. Now Amy does not
go to the minority group meetings.
Amy didn't report the calls to
anyone nor did she tell friends.
"I didn't report it. I didn't know
where to go to," she recalls. "I
thought somebody just didn't like
me so I didn't do anything."
Chin encourages people who
receive harassing calls to seek
counseling from friends, resident
assistants and fellows, deans,

Counseling and Psychological
Services and the Bridge.
"There is a feeling of being
threatened and power being taken
away from you," Chin says. "It's
important for a person to regain
a sense of empowerment."
Students can also get counseling
from the Office of the Om
budsperson. While Asst. Om
budsperson Carmen Jevons has
never dealt with a phone harass
ment case, she says students are
always welcome to come talk
about their concerns. "It just
doesn't occur to people to come
to this office," Jevons says.
Amy remembers being really
frightened by the calls. "I didn't
go anywhere for a couple weeks
at night," she says. "I thought
somebody didn't like me person
ally."
She says it's an awful feeling
"when someone calls you at home
and speaks in your language. It's
worse that way."
Amy was so bothered by the
calls that this year she considered
withholding her name from the
Pacific Bell directory and from
University information. But in
the end, she deciced to list her

Pisano wrote, "The messages are
not merely insulting in general
tone but also make graphic
threats of sexual violence includ
ing rape and sodomy."
After reviewing the case and
listening to a copy of the tape,
Kennedy seriously considered im
posing an indefinite suspension
on the student, according to a let
ter written by Kennedy. However,
because of Pisano's recommenda
tion and because the student
promised to reform and seek
counseling, Kennedy decided not
to take such a severe step.
Based on the "ugliness" of the
case — including the "appalling"
messages, the "trauma" inflicted
on the woman who received the
messages and the "anxiety" the
three men felt for being accused
— Kennedy decided to increase
Pisano's recommendation of a
three-quarter suspension to a
four-quarter suspension.
Diana Conklin, director of res
idential deans, recommends that
if students are receiving obscene
or harassing calls, they know who
is making the calls and they have
proof, they should report the in
cident to the Judicial Affairs Of
fice.
"If you can really nail the per
son, it is worthwhile," she says.
"It's a suspendable offense."
Jack Chin, resident dean for
Branner Hall, Toyon Hall and the
Row, points out, however, that it
is difficult to pursue a case with
out hard evidence. "It can really
be frustrating and really have a
dampening effect on the student,"
he says."It comes down to one
person's word against another's."
It is difficult to apply a formal
policy to cases of phone harass
ment, Chin says.

After the first series of calls,
Sarah says she was very scared.
"He knew who I was and I didn't
know who he was. I was really
afraid to go out at night, to ride
my bike anywhere at night. But
I had to because I had a class at
night once a week."
The call at the end of the quar
ter annoyed her very much. "But
I wasn't as scared because I knew
he couldn't do anything to me,"
she says.

When "Liz" answered her phone
the night before classes began this
quarter, she thought someone had
gotten the wrong number.
The caller hung up.
Half a minute later, the phone
rang again.
She answered the phone.
Again the caller hung up.
At first Liz didn't give the calls
a second thought. But when the
calls came again at 2:30 and 3
a.m., she began to think about it.
"I just thought someone was
screwing around," she says."I did
not know what was going on."
The next night, Wednesday, at
exactly 1:30 a.m., 2:30 a.m. and
3 a.m., the series of two calls were
repeated. Again there was no com
munication between Liz and the
caller.
On Thursday, Liz got none of
the anonymous calls but when the
nighttime'pattern repeated again
on Friday, Saturday and Sunday,
Liz began to worry.
"By Friday and Saturday, I
realized what was happening,"
Liz remembers. "I thought, 'This
is weird.' "
Her first reaction was to talk
to the caller. "I wanted to say,
'What's going on?' " But the caller
hang up before she had a chance
to say anything.
Her second reaction was "to
freak him out, to scare him, to
intimidate him." Liz had a male
friend answer the phone, but the
calls persisted.
On Monday, Liz called Pacific
Bell and had her phone number
changed. Her number is currently
listed with both the University and
Pacific Bell. The calls have since
stopped.
Liz did not call the police.
The response to confront the
caller is a natural one, Herrington
says. However, the best advice is
to avoid any verbal communica
tion with the caller.
Residential Affairs, the Stan
ford Police and Pacific Bell have
a wide range of advice for dealing
with harassing phone calls. Most
importantly, they stress the im
portance of not responding to the
caller.
"Crank callers get no satisfac
tion if there is no response," Chin
says. "Don't say anything, just
hang up. They get their jollies
from talking to you."
Herrington notes that harass
ing callers don't want anything
specific, they just want to talk
with someone. "Just hang up,"
he says.
An easy and effective way of
dealing with disturbing calls is to
let an answering machine answer
the phone and screen the calls. A
machine allows a call receiver to
avoid talking directly to the caller.
If the caller leaves a message, the
police can later make a voice print
of the call and use it as evidence
against a suspect, according to
Herrington.
In many cases, he says, callers
give up if they cannot talk with
someone.
Although Liz says the calls she
received were not "too freaky,"
they were disturbing and scary
because they were so uniform and
consistent.
She says she was also frustrated
by the persistent calls. "It's sad
to know people have to resort to
such tactics in order to have some
one to talk with them," she says.

Last year when the ringing of
the phone awoke "Jenny" in the

middle of the night, she answered
it. The caller immediately hung
up.
When these calls continued,
Jenny, then a junior, decided to
pull her phone out of the wall.
Once during spring quarter,
after Jenny decided to reconnect
the phone, the phone rang at 5:30
a.m. The caller asked for "Jen
nifer, " although nobody calls her
by her full name.
The caller then said, "This is
a pervert. I'm perverted. I'm hot
for you. I'm all hot." After a few
more sexual comments, Jenny
hung up.
During the next few days she
received calls during the night
and early morning. The caller
usually hung up immediately or
remained on the line until Jenny
hung up.
"I was really scared," Jenny re
members. She says she was afraid
to leave her first-floor single,
though she didn't feel safe there
either. "I was scared to go to the
bathroom. I didn't want to leave
the room."
When school ended, Jenny
moved to another campus resi
dence for the summer but kept the
same phone number. The calls
continued, so she called the police
and let people know she had done
so.
The calls stopped and have not
resumed.
Both Chin and Conklin stress
the importance of reporting the
calls to the residential deans and
the police.
"Others may be getting calls,
so it's important to report them,"
Chin says."I would encourage
people to pursue action because
it can stop calls or make the per
son change his or her behavior."
In addition, Conklin says, the
seven residential deans meet
weekly and share information. If
a caller is making calls to more
than one phone on campus, the
deans may be able to notice a
pattern that can help find the
caller.

'People don't want to tell anyone be
cause they're afraid they'll be brushed
off. I don't think people realize how
paralyzing a call like that can be.'

According to Herri ngton, when
people call the police, an officer
is assigned to take a report. "We
try to get the specifics," he says.
"We will question the victims be
cause they are most likely to know
if there is some conflict in their
lives to trigger this."
After that, he said, they wait
and see. In aggravated cases, Her
rington recommends people
change their phone numbers. He
does not recommend this often,
however, because it is a disruption
to the victim. "We try to minimize
the disruption to the victim's life
as much as possible."
Judy Peterson, media manager
for Pacific Bell, also recommends
hanging up, but if calls continue,
she suggests setting a phone trap
for the caller.
By calling the Pacific Bell busi
ness office, a person receiving
harassing calls can set up a trap
at no charge. The calls will be
traced by Pacific Bell. When the
harassing caller calls, the victim
records the day and time of the
call and immediately reports it to
the business office.
Pacific Bell then goes through
the calls and matches the phone
number with the reported call.
With the phone number, Pacific
Bell can find out where the calls
are coming from.
"It's an effective method in
most cases and we do contact the
police," Peterson says.
The most frightening part,
Jenny says, is the feeling of help
lessness that comes with not
knowing. "You don't know who it
is, whether to take it personally

or whether it is a random call."
Like Liz, Jenny says "it's sad
to think someone would get off
in scaring someone else."
Jenny, however, suspects she
was the target of political harass
ment and believes she knows the
group of people responsible for
the calls and sexual comments. As
a member of a minority commu
nity, she voiced her opposition to
other members of the community
at a meeting. As a result, she
feels, she was harassed and in
timidated over the phone.
"I was scared of the people I
thought were doing it because it
was sick how far they were going."
While she told her boyfriend
and a male friend about the calls,
she did not tell her resident as

sistant or resident fellows because
they also were involved in the
heated political debate and did not
share Jenny's views.

"Amy," who attended the same
meeting as Jenny, started receiv
ing hang-up calls during the same
week Jenny did.
One day, however, Amy, then a
junior transfer, heard children's
voices saying obscene and slang
words in Amy's native language.
While Amy speaks the language
at home, few people know that.
She says it sounded as if there
was a female adult in the back
ground telling the children what
to say. The voices repeated the
words 'whore' and 'slut' over and
over in her native language.
In the second call a male voice
asked for her by name and then
was silent. She hung up.
The third call reached the level
of threats. A man "warned me to
be careful because he knew where
I lived. He said he knew I had a
single," she remembers. Again,
the calls were in her native lan
guage.
When the school year ended, the
calls ended. Now Amy does not
go to the minority group meetings.
Amy didn't report the calls to
anyone nor did she tell friends.
"I didn't report it. I didn't know
where to go to," she recalls. "I
thought somebody just didn't like
me so I didn't do anything."
Chin encourages people who
receive harassing calls to seek
counseling from friends, resident
assistants and fellows, deans,

Counseling and Psychological
Services and the Bridge.
"There is a feeling of being
threatened and power being taken
away from you," Chin says. "It's
important for a person to regain
a sense of empowerment."
Students can also get counseling
from the Office of the Om
budsperson. While Asst. Om
budsperson Carmen Jevons has
never dealt with a phone harass
ment case, she says students are
always welcome to come talk
about their concerns. "It just
doesn't occur to people to come
to this office," Jevons says.
Amy remembers being really
frightened by the calls. "I didn't
go anywhere for a couple weeks
at night," she says. "I thought
somebody didn't like me person
ally."
She says it's an awful feeling
"when someone calls you at home
and speaks in your language. It's
worse that way."
Amy was so bothered by the
calls that this year she considered
withholding her name from the
Pacific Bell directory and from
University information. But in
the end, she deciced to list her
number in both places.

Last year when "Melissa," now
a senior, answered the phone, she
thought she was participating in
a consumer survey for a shoe com
pany. The male caller asked her
shoe size, the type of shoes she
wears everyday and the kind of
shoes she wears for dressy occa
sions. Melissa answered these
questions honestly.
Then he asked her, "What kind
of shoes do you fuck in?"
Melissa immediately hung up
the phone. The man never called
again.
Melissa thinks the caller ran
domly picked her name out of the
phone book.
Peterson recommends that
women list a first initial rather
than a full name in the Pacific
Bell directory and avoid listing
the address.
Unlisted numbers are obviously
the most effective way of prevent
ing random calls, she said. A num
ber that is not listed in the
directory costs 15 cents per
month. Keeping the number out
of directory assistance costs an
other 15 cents per month.
"I was really annoyed," Melissa
says. "You get flustered when
someone calls. You have your
routine and suddenly someone
enters it and breaks it up."
She adds that she really felt
gullible when she answered the
questions. "He sounded so legit."


Tracking the calls
During the years 1979 through 1988, Stanford Police received
254 reports of obscene or harassing phone calls — an average
of 25 per year. This year, 34 complaints have been received
already.
Editor's note: The following article
contains graphic language that may be
offensive to some readers.

Two weeks ago when "Karen," a
senior, walked into her off-campus house
after attending a meeting at the Lesbian,
Gay and Bisexual Community Center,
the phone was ringing.
None of her housemates was home,
so she answered it.
The male caller asked for her by her
full name, which had been announced
at the meeting, and began quizzing her.
"How old are you?" he said. "Do you
have a boyfriend? Have you ever dated
a man?"
Then he asked, "Wouldn't you like to
be fucked by a man?"
Karen hung up.
The problem of obscene and harassing
phone calls, like the one Karen received,
is widespread on campus, Stanford
Police Chief Marvin Herrington says.
But the majority of calls are not reported
to the police or the University, he adds.
This year to date, 34 people have re

ported harassing phone calls to Stanford
Police. Last year, 28 reports were made.
Over the last 10 years, from 1979 to
1988, Stanford Police have received 254
complaints of harassing phone calls, an
average of 25 per year.
Of those calls reported to the Stanford
Police, the caller usually says something
threatening or sexual, Herrington says.
Less often, the caller says nothing and
remains on the line until the victim
hangs up.
According to Herrington, most
obscene and harassing calls are received
by women.
"I was really scared," Karen says."I
didn't know who to tell. I had the feeling
he knew who 1 was, and I was home
alone."
Karen decided to tell a female friend
about the incident but did not report it
to the police. "I thought about calling
the police, but I didn't want to go
through the hassle of reporting it."
Karen says it is very hard to tell
people about the call. "People don't want
to tell anyone because they're afraid
they'll be brushed off," she explains. "I
don't think people realize how paralyz
ing a call like that can be."

'I was really scared. I didn't know who to tell. I
had the feeling he knew who I was, and I was
home alone.'

For two days following the call, Karen
found she was still very upset and
afraid. Her housemates, who she says
were very supportive, answered the
phone saying, "Hello, Stanford Police
Department, can I help you?"

When "Jessica's" friend answered an
ad for a room for rent posted at Tres
idder Union, Jessica, a junior, had no
idea of the harassment that would fol
low.
After speaking on the phone with the
man who placed the ad, Jessica's friend
decided he was too "weird" and did not
rent the room from him.
After her friend left, however, the man
continued to call, asking first for her
friend and then talking with Jessica.
"He'd say things like, 'You sound real
cute. I want to get to know you. Do you

want to come over?' "
A few days later he called more than
five times between 5 and 10 p.m. After
the first call, Jessica decided not to an
swer the phone and let her answering
machine take the call.
Filling the entire answering machine
tape, he said things such as, "How
would you like to come over, live here
rent-free, in exchange for your services?"
As the night went on, his calls became
more frustrated and angry, Jessica says.
His comments became obscene, saying,
"I want to make love with you. Come
on, sex isn't bad," and he threatened
Jessica, demanding to speak with her
inperson.
"He just kept calling, leaving the same
obscene messages," Jessica recalls. In
one message, he said, "I have fro yo all
over me and I want you to come over
and eat it off."

After two days, Jessica took action.
"Finally I said to him, 7 talked to the
phone company, I have your phone num
ber and I'll call the police and press
charges.' " After that, he didn't call back.
In fact, harassing phone calls fall un
der California Penal Code Section 653-
M, "Telephone calls with intent to
annoy." Violators of this law are guilty
of a misdemeanor, which carries a max
imum punishment of $500 and/or one
year in the county jail.
"The punishment could be probation
or a fine or anything," Herrington ex
plains. "A misdemeanor has a wide dis
cretion."
Jessica says she had always heard
about obscene calls, but she never
thought she would get one. "At first I
thought, 'This is ridiculous,' but then I
started to get scared."
Jessica says she doesn't know what
the man wanted from her. "I don't know
if he was lonely or deprived," she says.
"I think he must have really been hur
ting for a girlfriend."
She is now very relieved that the calls
have stopped, but she is afraid he
will call someone else, she says.
The frightening thing, Jessica
says, is that anyone could get a
call like the one she received.
"Anyone could have a card posted
at Tresidder. You never know
what you can run into."
She added that she is "kind of
disillusioned now" and she will
think twice before talking with
people she doesn't know.

At the beginning of her fresh
man year, "Sarah," who gradu
ated in June, began receiving
obscene phone calls.
In the first call, the young male
caller asked for her by name and
said he knew who she was.
Then the caller said, "I want
to masturbate with you. I want
you to touch yourself."
Sarah hung up.
After a few more obscene calls,
she called the police and gave
them her story. At her dormitory's
house meeting, she announced
that the police were searching for
the caller.
After that night, the calls
stopped until the end of fall quar
ter. Once, after pulling an "all
nighter," she walked from the
dorm study room to her room at
5 a.m.
When she walked into her room,
the phone began ringing. She
picked it up.
When she heard the same voice
on the line, she says, she knew
the caller had to be from her dorm.
Only someone watching from
within her dorm could have seen
her return to her room. Her name
and phone number were not listed
with the University or with Pacific
Bell.
After that incident, the calls
stopped.
Sarah says if she knew who the
man was, she would want to take
action against him. "The least I
would do would be to have the
police confront him to let him
know," she says. She would also
consider making a report to the
University.
Obscene and threatening phone
calls can also violate the Funda
mental Standard, according to
Alice Bender, assistant to the Of
fice of Judicial Affairs.
This year's newly revised hand
book of Student Conduct Policies
states that "Leaving threatening
and obscene messages on the tele

phone answering system of an
other student" is an example of
a Fundamental Standard viola
tion.
This addition to the guidebook
results from a recent case in which
a male undergraduate was
suspended for four quarters be
cause he left three anonymous
telephone messages on the
answering machine of a female
undergraduate.
The tone and content of the
messages were "obscene, threat
ening and violent," according to a
letter written by Judicial Affairs
Officer Sally Cole. In addition, the
messages named three undergrad
uate men and suggested they were
party to the calls. In fact, the men
did not know about the calls.
In a letter to University Pres
ident Donald Kennedy, former As
st. Dean of Student Affairs Joseph
Pisano wrote, "The messages are
not merely insulting in general
tone but also make graphic
threats of sexual violence includ
ing rape and sodomy."
After reviewing the case and
listening to a copy of the tape,
Kennedy seriously considered im
posing an indefinite suspension
on the student, according to a let

case — including the "appalling"
messages, the "trauma" inflicted
on the woman who received the

three men felt for being accused
— Kennedy decided to increase
Pisano's recommendation of a
three-quarter suspension to a
four-quarter suspension.

One day, however, Amy, then a
junior transfer, heard children's
voices saying obscene and slang
words in Amy's native language.
While Amy speaks the language
at home, few people know that.
She says it sounded as if there
was a female adult in the back
ground telling the children what
to say. The voices repeated the
words 'whore' and 'slut' over and
over in her native language.
In the second call a male voice
asked for her by name and then
was silent. She hung up.
The third call reached the level
of threats. A man "warned me to
be careful because he knew where
I lived. He said he knew I had a
single," she remembers. Again,
the calls were in her native lan
guage.
When the school year ended, the
calls ended. Now Amy does not
go to the minority group meetings.
Amy didn't report the calls to
anyone nor did she tell friends.
"I didn't report it. I didn't know
where to go to," she recalls. "I
thought somebody just didn't like
me so I didn't do anything."
Chin encourages people who
receive harassing calls to seek
counseling from friends, resident
assistants and fellows, deans,

Counseling and Psychological
Services and the Bridge.
"There is a feeling of being
threatened and power being taken
away from you," Chin says. "It's
important for a person to regain
a sense of empowerment."
Students can also get counseling
from the Office of the Om
budsperson. While Asst. Om
budsperson Carmen Jevons has
never dealt with a phone harass
ment case, she says students are
always welcome to come talk
about their concerns. "It just
doesn't occur to people to come
to this office," Jevons says.
Amy remembers being really
frightened by the calls. "I didn't
go anywhere for a couple weeks
at night," she says. "I thought
somebody didn't like me person
ally."
She says it's an awful feeling
"when someone calls you at home
and speaks in your language. It's
worse that way."
Amy was so bothered by the
calls that this year she considered
withholding her name from the
Pacific Bell directory and from
University information. But in
the end, she deciced to list her
number in both places.

Last year when "Melissa," now
a senior, answered the phone, she
thought she was participating in
a consumer survey for a shoe com
pany. The male caller asked her
shoe size, the type of shoes she
wears everyday and the kind of
shoes she wears for dressy occa
sions. Melissa answered these
questions honestly.
Then he asked her, "What kind
of shoes do you fuck in?"
Melissa immediately hung up
the phone. The man never called
again.
Melissa thinks the caller ran
domly picked her name out of the
phone book.
Peterson recommends that
women list a first initial rather
than a full name in the Pacific
Bell directory and avoid listing
the address.
Unlisted numbers are obviously
the most effective way of prevent
ing random calls, she said. A num
ber that is not listed in the
directory costs 15 cents per
month. Keeping the number out
of directory assistance costs an
other 15 cents per month.
"I was really annoyed," Melissa
says. "You get flustered when
someone calls. You have your
routine and suddenly someone
enters it and breaks it up."
She adds that she really felt
gullible when she answered the
questions. "He sounded so legit."


Tracking the calls
During the years 1979 through 1988, Stanford Police received
254 reports of obscene or harassing phone calls — an average
of 25 per year. This year, 34 complaints have been received
already.
Editor's note: The following article
contains graphic language that may be
offensive to some readers.

Two weeks ago when "Karen," a
senior, walked into her off-campus house
after attending a meeting at the Lesbian,
Gay and Bisexual Community Center,
the phone was ringing.
None of her housemates was home,
so she answered it.
The male caller asked for her by her
full name, which had been announced
at the meeting, and began quizzing her.
"How old are you?" he said. "Do you
have a boyfriend? Have you ever dated
a man?"
Then he asked, "Wouldn't you like to
be fucked by a man?"
Karen hung up.
The problem of obscene and harassing
phone calls, like the one Karen received,
is widespread on campus, Stanford
Police Chief Marvin Herrington says.
But the majority of calls are not reported
to the police or the University, he adds.
This year to date, 34 people have re

ported harassing phone calls to Stanford
Police. Last year, 28 reports were made.
Over the last 10 years, from 1979 to
1988, Stanford Police have received 254
complaints of harassing phone calls, an
average of 25 per year.
Of those calls reported to the Stanford
Police, the caller usually says something
threatening or sexual, Herrington says.
Less often, the caller says nothing and
remains on the line until the victim
hangs up.
According to Herrington, most
obscene and harassing calls are received
by women.
"I was really scared," Karen says."I
didn't know who to tell. I had the feeling
he knew who 1 was, and I was home
alone."
Karen decided to tell a female friend
about the incident but did not report it
to the police. "I thought about calling
the police, but I didn't want to go
through the hassle of reporting it."
Karen says it is very hard to tell
people about the call. "People don't want
to tell anyone because they're afraid
they'll be brushed off," she explains. "I
don't think people realize how paralyz
ing a call like that can be."

'I was really scared. I didn't know who to tell. I
had the feeling he knew who I was, and I was
home alone.'

For two days following the call, Karen
found she was still very upset and
afraid. Her housemates, who she says
were very supportive, answered the
phone saying, "Hello, Stanford Police
Department, can I help you?"

When "Jessica's" friend answered an
ad for a room for rent posted at Tres
idder Union, Jessica, a junior, had no
idea of the harassment that would fol
low.
After speaking on the phone with the
man who placed the ad, Jessica's friend
decided he was too "weird" and did not
rent the room from him.
After her friend left, however, the man
continued to call, asking first for her
friend and then talking with Jessica.
"He'd say things like, 'You sound real
cute. I want to get to know you. Do you

want to come over?' "
A few days later he called more than
five times between 5 and 10 p.m. After
the first call, Jessica decided not to an
swer the phone and let her answering
machine take the call.
Filling the entire answering machine
tape, he said things such as, "How
would you like to come over, live here
rent-free, in exchange for your services?"
As the night went on, his calls became
more frustrated and angry, Jessica says.
His comments became obscene, saying,
"I want to make love with you. Come
on, sex isn't bad," and he threatened
Jessica, demanding to speak with her
inperson.
"He just kept calling, leaving the same
obscene messages," Jessica recalls. In
one message, he said, "I have fro yo all
over me and I want you to come over
and eat it off."

After two days, Jessica took action.
"Finally I said to him, 7 talked to the
phone company, I have your phone num
ber and I'll call the police and press
charges.' " After that, he didn't call back.
In fact, harassing phone calls fall un
der California Penal Code Section 653-
M, "Telephone calls with intent to
annoy." Violators of this law are guilty
of a misdemeanor, which carries a max
imum punishment of $500 and/or one
year in the county jail.
"The punishment could be probation
or a fine or anything," Herrington ex
plains. "A misdemeanor has a wide dis
cretion."
Jessica says she had always heard
about obscene calls, but she never
thought she would get one. "At first I
thought, 'This is ridiculous,' but then I
started to get scared."
Jessica says she doesn't know what
the man wanted from her. "I don't know
if he was lonely or deprived," she says.
"I think he must have really been hur
ting for a girlfriend."
She is now very relieved that the calls
have stopped, but she is afraid he
will call someone else, she says.
The frightening thing, Jessica
says, is that anyone could get a
call like the one she received.
"Anyone could have a card posted
at Tresidder. You never know
what you can run into."
She added that she is "kind of
disillusioned now" and she will
think twice before talking with
people she doesn't know.

At the beginning of her fresh
man year, "Sarah," who gradu
ated in June, began receiving
obscene phone calls.
In the first call, the young male
caller asked for her by name and
said he knew who she was.
Then the caller said, "I want
to masturbate with you. I want
you to touch yourself."
Sarah hung up.
After a few more obscene calls,
she called the police and gave
them her story. At her dormitory's
house meeting, she announced
that the police were searching for
the caller.
After that night, the calls
stopped until the end of fall quar
ter. Once, after pulling an "all
nighter," she walked from the
dorm study room to her room at
5 a.m.
When she walked into her room,
the phone began ringing. She
picked it up.
When she heard the same voice
on the line, she says, she knew
the caller had to be from her dorm.
Only someone watching from
within her dorm could have seen
her return to her room. Her name
and phone number were not listed
with the University or with Pacific
Bell.
After that incident, the calls
stopped.
Sarah says if she knew who the
man was, she would want to take
action against him. "The least I
would do would be to have the
police confront him to let him
know," she says. She would also
consider making a report to the
University.
Obscene and threatening phone
calls can also violate the Funda
mental Standard, according to
Alice Bender, assistant to the Of
fice of Judicial Affairs.
This year's newly revised hand
book of Student Conduct Policies
states that "Leaving threatening
and obscene messages on the tele

phone answering system of an
other student" is an example of
a Fundamental Standard viola
tion.
This addition to the guidebook
results from a recent case in which
a male undergraduate was
suspended for four quarters be
cause he left three anonymous
telephone messages on the
answering machine of a female
undergraduate.
The tone and content of the
messages were "obscene, threat
ening and violent," according to a
letter written by Judicial Affairs
Officer Sally Cole. In addition, the
messages named three undergrad
uate men and suggested they were
party to the calls. In fact, the men
did not know about the calls.
In a letter to University Pres
ident Donald Kennedy, former As
st. Dean of Student Affairs Joseph
Pisano wrote, "The messages are
not merely insulting in general
tone but also make graphic
threats of sexual violence includ
ing rape and sodomy."
After reviewing the case and
listening to a copy of the tape,
Kennedy seriously considered im
posing an indefinite suspension
on the student, according to a let
ter written by Kennedy. However,
because of Pisano's recommenda
tion and because the student
promised to reform and seek
counseling, Kennedy decided not
to take such a severe step.
Based on the "ugliness" of the
case — including the "appalling"
messages, the "trauma" inflicted
on the woman who received the
messages and the "anxiety" the
three men felt for being accused
— Kennedy decided to increase
Pisano's recommendation of a
three-quarter suspension to a
four-quarter suspension.
Diana Conklin, director of res
idential deans, recommends that
if students are receiving obscene
or harassing calls, they know who
is making the calls and they have
proof, they should report the in
cident to the Judicial Affairs Of
fice.
"If you can really nail the per
son, it is worthwhile," she says.
"It's a suspendable offense."
Jack Chin, resident dean for
Branner Hall, Toyon Hall and the
Row, points out, however, that it
is difficult to pursue a case with
out hard evidence. "It can really
be frustrating and really have a
dampening effect on the student,"
he says."It comes down to one
person's word against another's."
It is difficult to apply a formal
policy to cases of phone harass
ment, Chin says.

After the first series of calls,
Sarah says she was very scared.
"He knew who I was and I didn't
know who he was. I was really
afraid to go out at night, to ride
my bike anywhere at night. But
I had to because I had a class at
night once a week."
The call at the end of the quar
ter annoyed her very much. "But
I wasn't as scared because I knew
he couldn't do anything to me,"
she says.

When "Liz" answered her phone
the night before classes began this
quarter, she thought someone had
gotten the wrong number.
The caller hung up.
Half a minute later, the phone
rang again.
She answered the phone.
Again the caller hung up.
At first Liz didn't give the calls
a second thought. But when the
calls came again at 2:30 and 3
a.m., she began to think about it.
"I just thought someone was
screwing around," she says."I did
not know what was going on."
The next night, Wednesday, at
exactly 1:30 a.m., 2:30 a.m. and
3 a.m., the series of two calls were
repeated. Again there was no com
munication between Liz and the
caller.
On Thursday, Liz got none of
the anonymous calls but when the
nighttime'pattern repeated again
on Friday, Saturday and Sunday,
Liz began to worry.
"By Friday and Saturday, I
realized what was happening,"
Liz remembers. "I thought, 'This
is weird.' "
Her first reaction was to talk
to the caller. "I wanted to say,
'What's going on?' " But the caller
hang up before she had a chance
to say anything.
Her second reaction was "to
freak him out, to scare him, to
intimidate him." Liz had a male
friend answer the phone, but the
calls persisted.
On Monday, Liz called Pacific
Bell and had her phone number
changed. Her number is currently
listed with both the University and
Pacific Bell. The calls have since
stopped.
Liz did not call the police.
The response to confront the
caller is a natural one, Herrington
says. However, the best advice is
to avoid any verbal communica
tion with the caller.
Residential Affairs, the Stan
ford Police and Pacific Bell have
a wide range of advice for dealing
with harassing phone calls. Most
importantly, they stress the im
portance of not responding to the
caller.
"Crank callers get no satisfac
tion if there is no response," Chin
says. "Don't say anything, just
hang up. They get their jollies
from talking to you."
Herrington notes that harass
ing callers don't want anything
specific, they just want to talk
with someone. "Just hang up,"
he says.
An easy and effective way of
dealing with disturbing calls is to
let an answering machine answer
the phone and screen the calls. A
machine allows a call receiver to
avoid talking directly to the caller.
If the caller leaves a message, the
police can later make a voice print
of the call and use it as evidence
against a suspect, according to
Herrington.
In many cases, he says, callers
give up if they cannot talk with
someone.
Although Liz says the calls she
received were not "too freaky,"
they were disturbing and scary
because they were so uniform and
consistent.
She says she was also frustrated
by the persistent calls. "It's sad
to know people have to resort to
such tactics in order to have some
one to talk with them," she says.

Last year when the ringing of
the phone awoke "Jenny" in the

middle of the night, she answered
it. The caller immediately hung
up.
When these calls continued,
Jenny, then a junior, decided to
pull her phone out of the wall.
Once during spring quarter,
after Jenny decided to reconnect
the phone, the phone rang at 5:30
a.m. The caller asked for "Jen
nifer, " although nobody calls her
by her full name.
The caller then said, "This is
a pervert. I'm perverted. I'm hot
for you. I'm all hot." After a few
more sexual comments, Jenny
hung up.
During the next few days she
received calls during the night
and early morning. The caller
usually hung up immediately or
remained on the line until Jenny
hung up.
"I was really scared," Jenny re
members. She says she was afraid
to leave her first-floor single,
though she didn't feel safe there
either. "I was scared to go to the
bathroom. I didn't want to leave
the room."
When school ended, Jenny
moved to another campus resi
dence for the summer but kept the
same phone number. The calls
continued, so she called the police
and let people know she had done
so.
The calls stopped and have not
resumed.
Both Chin and Conklin stress
the importance of reporting the
calls to the residential deans and
the police.
"Others may be getting calls,
so it's important to report them,"
Chin says."I would encourage
people to pursue action because
it can stop calls or make the per
son change his or her behavior."
In addition, Conklin says, the
seven residential deans meet
weekly and share information. If
a caller is making calls to more
than one phone on campus, the
deans may be able to notice a
pattern that can help find the
caller.

'People don't want to tell anyone be
cause they're afraid they'll be brushed
off. I don't think people realize how
paralyzing a call like that can be.'

According to Herri ngton, when
people call the police, an officer
is assigned to take a report. "We
try to get the specifics," he says.
"We will question the victims be
cause they are most likely to know
if there is some conflict in their
lives to trigger this."
After that, he said, they wait
and see. In aggravated cases, Her
rington recommends people
change their phone numbers. He
does not recommend this often,
however, because it is a disruption
to the victim. "We try to minimize
the disruption to the victim's life
as much as possible."
Judy Peterson, media manager
for Pacific Bell, also recommends
hanging up, but if calls continue,
she suggests setting a phone trap
for the caller.
By calling the Pacific Bell busi
ness office, a person receiving
harassing calls can set up a trap
at no charge. The calls will be
traced by Pacific Bell. When the
harassing caller calls, the victim
records the day and time of the
call and immediately reports it to
the business office.
Pacific Bell then goes through
the calls and matches the phone
number with the reported call.
With the phone number, Pacific
Bell can find out where the calls
are coming from.
"It's an effective method in
most cases and we do contact the
police," Peterson says.
The most frightening part,
Jenny says, is the feeling of help
lessness that comes with not
knowing. "You don't know who it
is, whether to take it personally

or whether it is a random call."
Like Liz, Jenny says "it's sad
to think someone would get off
in scaring someone else."
Jenny, however, suspects she
was the target of political harass
ment and believes she knows the
group of people responsible for
the calls and sexual comments. As
a member of a minority commu
nity, she voiced her opposition to
other members of the community
at a meeting. As a result, she
feels, she was harassed and in
timidated over the phone.
"I was scared of the people I
thought were doing it because it
was sick how far they were going."
While she told her boyfriend
and a male friend about the calls,
she did not tell her resident as

sistant or resident fellows because
they also were involved in the
heated political debate and did not
share Jenny's views.

meeting as Jenny, started receiv
ing hang-up calls during the same

After that night, the calls
stopped until the end of fall quar
ter. Once, after pulling an "all
nighter," she walked from the
dorm study room to her room at
5 a.m.
When she walked into her room,
the phone began ringing. She
picked it up.
When she heard the same voice
on the line, she says, she knew
the caller had to be from her dorm.
Only someone watching from
within her dorm could have seen
her return to her room. Her name
and phone number were not listed
with the University or with Pacific
Bell.
After that incident, the calls
stopped.
Sarah says if she knew who the
man was, she would want to take
action against him. "The least I
would do would be to have the
police confront him to let him
know," she says. She would also
consider making a report to the
University.
Obscene and threatening phone
calls can also violate the Funda
mental Standard, according to
Alice Bender, assistant to the Of
fice of Judicial Affairs.
This year's newly revised hand
book of Student Conduct Policies
states that "Leaving threatening
and obscene messages on the tele

phone answering system of an
other student" is an example of
a Fundamental Standard viola
tion.
This addition to the guidebook
results from a recent case in which
a male undergraduate was
suspended for four quarters be
cause he left three anonymous
telephone messages on the
answering machine of a female
undergraduate.
The tone and content of the
messages were "obscene, threat
ening and violent," according to a
letter written by Judicial Affairs
Officer Sally Cole. In addition, the
messages named three undergrad
uate men and suggested they were
party to the calls. In fact, the men
did not know about the calls.
In a letter to University Pres
ident Donald Kennedy, former As
st. Dean of Student Affairs Joseph
Pisano wrote, "The messages are
not merely insulting in general
tone but also make graphic
threats of sexual violence includ
ing rape and sodomy."
After reviewing the case and
listening to a copy of the tape,
Kennedy seriously considered im
posing an indefinite suspension
on the student, according to a let
ter written by Kennedy. However,
because of Pisano's recommenda
tion and because the student
promised to reform and seek
counseling, Kennedy decided not
to take such a severe step.
Based on the "ugliness" of the
case — including the "appalling"
messages, the "trauma" inflicted
on the woman who received the
messages and the "anxiety" the
three men felt for being accused
— Kennedy decided to increase
Pisano's recommendation of a
three-quarter suspension to a
four-quarter suspension.
Diana Conklin, director of res
idential deans, recommends that
if students are receiving obscene
or harassing calls, they know who
is making the calls and they have
proof, they should report the in
cident to the Judicial Affairs Of
fice.
"If you can really nail the per
son, it is worthwhile," she says.
"It's a suspendable offense."
Jack Chin, resident dean for
Branner Hall, Toyon Hall and the
Row, points out, however, that it
is difficult to pursue a case with
out hard evidence. "It can really
be frustrating and really have a
dampening effect on the student,"
he says."It comes down to one
person's word against another's."
It is difficult to apply a formal
policy to cases of phone harass
ment, Chin says.

After the first series of calls,
Sarah says she was very scared.
"He knew who I was and I didn't
know who he was. I was really
afraid to go out at night, to ride
my bike anywhere at night. But
I had to because I had a class at
night once a week."
The call at the end of the quar
ter annoyed her very much. "But
I wasn't as scared because I knew
he couldn't do anything to me,"
she says.

When "Liz" answered her phone
the night before classes began this
quarter, she thought someone had
gotten the wrong number.
The caller hung up.
Half a minute later, the phone
rang again.
She answered the phone.
Again the caller hung up.
At first Liz didn't give the calls
a second thought. But when the
calls came again at 2:30 and 3
a.m., she began to think about it.
"I just thought someone was
screwing around," she says."I did
not know what was going on."
The next night, Wednesday, at
exactly 1:30 a.m., 2:30 a.m. and
3 a.m., the series of two calls were
repeated. Again there was no com
munication between Liz and the
caller.
On Thursday, Liz got none of
the anonymous calls but when the
nighttime'pattern repeated again
on Friday, Saturday and Sunday,
Liz began to worry.
"By Friday and Saturday, I
realized what was happening,"
Liz remembers. "I thought, 'This
is weird.' "
Her first reaction was to talk
to the caller. "I wanted to say,
'What's going on?' " But the caller
hang up before she had a chance
to say anything.
Her second reaction was "to
freak him out, to scare him, to
intimidate him." Liz had a male
friend answer the phone, but the
calls persisted.
On Monday, Liz called Pacific
Bell and had her phone number
changed. Her number is currently
listed with both the University and
Pacific Bell. The calls have since
stopped.
Liz did not call the police.
The response to confront the
caller is a natural one, Herrington
says. However, the best advice is
to avoid any verbal communica
tion with the caller.
Residential Affairs, the Stan
ford Police and Pacific Bell have
a wide range of advice for dealing
with harassing phone calls. Most
importantly, they stress the im
portance of not responding to the
caller.
"Crank callers get no satisfac
tion if there is no response," Chin
says. "Don't say anything, just
hang up. They get their jollies
from talking to you."
Herrington notes that harass
ing callers don't want anything
specific, they just want to talk
with someone. "Just hang up,"
he says.
An easy and effective way of
dealing with disturbing calls is to
let an answering machine answer
the phone and screen the calls. A
machine allows a call receiver to
avoid talking directly to the caller.
If the caller leaves a message, the
police can later make a voice print
of the call and use it as evidence
against a suspect, according to
Herrington.
In many cases, he says, callers
give up if they cannot talk with
someone.
Although Liz says the calls she
received were not "too freaky,"
they were disturbing and scary
because they were so uniform and
consistent.
She says she was also frustrated
by the persistent calls. "It's sad
to know people have to resort to
such tactics in order to have some
one to talk with them," she says.

Last year when the ringing of
the phone awoke "Jenny" in the

middle of the night, she answered
it. The caller immediately hung
up.
When these calls continued,
Jenny, then a junior, decided to
pull her phone out of the wall.
Once during spring quarter,
after Jenny decided to reconnect
the phone, the phone rang at 5:30
a.m. The caller asked for "Jen
nifer, " although nobody calls her
by her full name.
The caller then said, "This is
a pervert. I'm perverted. I'm hot
for you. I'm all hot." After a few
more sexual comments, Jenny
hung up.
During the next few days she
received calls during the night
and early morning. The caller
usually hung up immediately or
remained on the line until Jenny
hung up.
"I was really scared," Jenny re
members. She says she was afraid
to leave her first-floor single,
though she didn't feel safe there
either. "I was scared to go to the
bathroom. I didn't want to leave
the room."
When school ended, Jenny
moved to another campus resi
dence for the summer but kept the
same phone number. The calls
continued, so she called the police
and let people know she had done
so.
The calls stopped and have not
resumed.
Both Chin and Conklin stress
the importance of reporting the
calls to the residential deans and
the police.
"Others may be getting calls,
so it's important to report them,"
Chin says."I would encourage
people to pursue action because
it can stop calls or make the per
son change his or her behavior."
In addition, Conklin says, the
seven residential deans meet
weekly and share information. If
a caller is making calls to more
than one phone on campus, the
deans may be able to notice a
pattern that can help find the
caller.

'People don't want to tell anyone be
cause they're afraid they'll be brushed
off. I don't think people realize how
paralyzing a call like that can be.'

According to Herri ngton, when
people call the police, an officer
is assigned to take a report. "We
try to get the specifics," he says.
"We will question the victims be
cause they are most likely to know
if there is some conflict in their
lives to trigger this."
After that, he said, they wait
and see. In aggravated cases, Her
rington recommends people
change their phone numbers. He
does not recommend this often,
however, because it is a disruption
to the victim. "We try to minimize
the disruption to the victim's life
as much as possible."
Judy Peterson, media manager
for Pacific Bell, also recommends
hanging up, but if calls continue,
she suggests setting a phone trap
for the caller.
By calling the Pacific Bell busi
ness office, a person receiving
harassing calls can set up a trap
at no charge. The calls will be
traced by Pacific Bell. When the
harassing caller calls, the victim
records the day and time of the
call and immediately reports it to
the business office.
Pacific Bell then goes through
the calls and matches the phone
number with the reported call.
With the phone number, Pacific
Bell can find out where the calls
are coming from.
"It's an effective method in
most cases and we do contact the
police," Peterson says.
The most frightening part,
Jenny says, is the feeling of help
lessness that comes with not
knowing. "You don't know who it
is, whether to take it personally

or whether it is a random call."
Like Liz, Jenny says "it's sad
to think someone would get off
in scaring someone else."
Jenny, however, suspects she
was the target of political harass
ment and believes she knows the
group of people responsible for
the calls and sexual comments. As
a member of a minority commu
nity, she voiced her opposition to
other members of the community
at a meeting. As a result, she
feels, she was harassed and in
timidated over the phone.
"I was scared of the people I
thought were doing it because it
was sick how far they were going."
While she told her boyfriend
and a male friend about the calls,
she did not tell her resident as

sistant or resident fellows because
they also were involved in the
heated political debate and did not
share Jenny's views.

"Amy," who attended the same
meeting as Jenny, started receiv
ing hang-up calls during the same
week Jenny did.
One day, however, Amy, then a
junior transfer, heard children's
voices saying obscene and slang
words in Amy's native language.
While Amy speaks the language
at home, few people know that.
She says it sounded as if there
was a female adult in the back
ground telling the children what
to say. The voices repeated the
words 'whore' and 'slut' over and
over in her native language.
In the second call a male voice
asked for her by name and then
was silent. She hung up.
The third call reached the level
of threats. A man "warned me to
be careful because he knew where
I lived. He said he knew I had a
single," she remembers. Again,
the calls were in her native lan
guage.
When the school year ended, the
calls ended. Now Amy does not
go to the minority group meetings.
Amy didn't report the calls to
anyone nor did she tell friends.
"I didn't report it. I didn't know
where to go to," she recalls. "I
thought somebody just didn't like
me so I didn't do anything."
Chin encourages people who
receive harassing calls to seek
counseling from friends, resident
assistants and fellows, deans,

Counseling and Psychological
Services and the Bridge.
"There is a feeling of being
threatened and power being taken
away from you," Chin says. "It's
important for a person to regain
a sense of empowerment."
Students can also get counseling
from the Office of the Om
budsperson. While Asst. Om
budsperson Carmen Jevons has
never dealt with a phone harass
ment case, she says students are
always welcome to come talk
about their concerns. "It just
doesn't occur to people to come
to this office," Jevons says.
Amy remembers being really
frightened by the calls. "I didn't
go anywhere for a couple weeks
at night," she says. "I thought
somebody didn't like me person
ally."
She says it's an awful feeling
"when someone calls you at home
and speaks in your language. It's
worse that way."
Amy was so bothered by the
calls that this year she considered
withholding her name from the
Pacific Bell directory and from
University information. But in
the end, she deciced to list her
number in both places.

Last year when "Melissa," now
a senior, answered the phone, she
thought she was participating in
a consumer survey for a shoe com
pany. The male caller asked her
shoe size, the type of shoes she
wears everyday and the kind of
shoes she wears for dressy occa
sions. Melissa answered these
questions honestly.
Then he asked her, "What kind
of shoes do you fuck in?"
Melissa immediately hung up
the phone. The man never called
again.
Melissa thinks the caller ran
domly picked her name out of the
phone book.
Peterson recommends that
women list a first initial rather
than a full name in the Pacific
Bell directory and avoid listing
the address.
Unlisted numbers are obviously
the most effective way of prevent
ing random calls, she said. A num
ber that is not listed in the
directory costs 15 cents per
month. Keeping the number out
of directory assistance costs an
other 15 cents per month.
"I was really annoyed," Melissa
says. "You get flustered when
someone calls. You have your
routine and suddenly someone
enters it and breaks it up."
She adds that she really felt
gullible when she answered the
questions. "He sounded so legit."


Tracking the calls
During the years 1979 through 1988, Stanford Police received
254 reports of obscene or harassing phone calls — an average
of 25 per year. This year, 34 complaints have been received
already.
