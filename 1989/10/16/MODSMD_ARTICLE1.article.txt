# Obscene phone calls prevalent, 'paralyzing' at Stanford

Two weeks ago when "Karen," a
senior, walked into her off-campus house
after attending a meeting at the Lesbian,
Gay and Bisexual Community Center,
the phone was ringing.
None of her housemates was home,
so she answered it.
The male caller asked for her by her
full name, which had been announced
at the meeting, and began quizzing her.
"How old are you?" he said. "Do you
have a boyfriend? Have you ever dated
a man?"
Then he asked, "Wouldn't you like to
be fucked by a man?"
Karen hung up.
The problem of obscene and harassing
phone calls, like the one Karen received,
is widespread on campus, Stanford
Police Chief Marvin Herrington says.
But the majority of calls are not reported
to the police or the University, he adds.
This year to date, 34 people have re

ported harassing phone calls to Stanford
Police. Last year, 28 reports were made.
Over the last 10 years, from 1979 to
1988, Stanford Police have received 254
complaints of harassing phone calls, an
average of 25 per year.
Of those calls reported to the Stanford
Police, the caller usually says something
threatening or sexual, Herrington says.
Less often, the caller says nothing and
remains on the line until the victim
hangs up.
According to Herrington, most
obscene and harassing calls are received
by women.
"I was really scared," Karen says."I
didn't know who to tell. I had the feeling
he knew who 1 was, and I was home
alone."
Karen decided to tell a female friend
about the incident but did not report it
to the police. "I thought about calling
the police, but I didn't want to go
through the hassle of reporting it."
Karen says it is very hard to tell
people about the call. "People don't want
to tell anyone because they're afraid
they'll be brushed off," she explains. "I
don't think people realize how paralyz
ing a call like that can be."

'I was really scared. I didn't know who to tell. I
had the feeling he knew who I was, and I was
home alone.'

For two days following the call, Karen
found she was still very upset and
afraid. Her housemates, who she says
were very supportive, answered the
phone saying, "Hello, Stanford Police
Department, can I help you?"

When "Jessica's" friend answered an
ad for a room for rent posted at Tres
idder Union, Jessica, a junior, had no
idea of the harassment that would fol
low.
After speaking on the phone with the
man who placed the ad, Jessica's friend
decided he was too "weird" and did not
rent the room from him.
After her friend left, however, the man
continued to call, asking first for her
friend and then talking with Jessica.
"He'd say things like, 'You sound real
cute. I want to get to know you. Do you

want to come over?' "
A few days later he called more than
five times between 5 and 10 p.m. After
the first call, Jessica decided not to an
swer the phone and let her answering
machine take the call.
Filling the entire answering machine
tape, he said things such as, "How
would you like to come over, live here
rent-free, in exchange for your services?"
As the night went on, his calls became
more frustrated and angry, Jessica says.
His comments became obscene, saying,
"I want to make love with you. Come
on, sex isn't bad," and he threatened
Jessica, demanding to speak with her
inperson.
"He just kept calling, leaving the same
obscene messages," Jessica recalls. In
one message, he said, "I have fro yo all
over me and I want you to come over
and eat it off."

After two days, Jessica took action.
"Finally I said to him, 7 talked to the
phone company, I have your phone num
ber and I'll call the police and press
charges.' " After that, he didn't call back.
In fact, harassing phone calls fall un
der California Penal Code Section 653-
M, "Telephone calls with intent to
annoy." Violators of this law are guilty
of a misdemeanor, which carries a max
imum punishment of $500 and/or one
year in the county jail.
"The punishment could be probation
or a fine or anything," Herrington ex
plains. "A misdemeanor has a wide dis
cretion."
Jessica says she had always heard
about obscene calls, but she never
thought she would get one. "At first I
thought, 'This is ridiculous,' but then I
started to get scared."
Jessica says she doesn't know what
the man wanted from her. "I don't know
if he was lonely or deprived," she says.
"I think he must have really been hur
ting for a girlfriend."
She is now very relieved that the calls
