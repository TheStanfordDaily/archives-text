# Palestinians reject U.S. initiative

JERUSALEM (AP) - Under
ground leaders of the Arab upris
ing yesterday rejected a U.S. plan
to arrange talks between Israelis
and Palestinians, and Prime Min
ister Yitzhak Shamir opposed the
idea of holding such talks in Cairo.
Shamir said he preferred lower
level talks to those proposed by
the United fllhtes and that they
should be held in Israel.
Security forces killed a Pales
tinian and wounded three others
during protests in the occupied
West Bank and Gaza Strip, and
Arab reports said a Palestinian
accused of collaborating with Is
rael was killed by masked ac
tivists.
The latest deaths brought to
595 the number of Palestinians
killed by Israeli soldiers and
civilians during the 22-month-old
uprising; another 130 Palestini
ans have been killed by fellow
Arabs as suspected collaborators.
Forty Israelis also have died in
the violence.
A U.S. plan formulated by Sec
retary of State James A. Baker
111 is designed to bring about a
meeting in Cairo urged by Egyp
tian President Hosni Mubarak as
a way to bridge differences be

tween Israel and the PLO.
The underground Palestinian
leadership, in its 47th leaflet since
the start of the rebellion in De
cember 1987, said it "rejects
America's suspicious role, prima
rily James Baker's five points."
Baker's plan calls for consulta
tions between the Israeli and
Egyptian foreign ministers to
agree on the makeup of a Pales
tinian delegation for the proposed
Cairo meeting.
Mubarak urged the meeting as
a way to revive Israel's stalled
peace initiative, which calls for
elections among Palestinians in
the West Bank and Gaza to pick
delegates to negotiate with Israel
on interim self-rule.
The leaflet from the uprising's
PLO-backed leadership said
Baker's ideas merely supported
Shamir's election plan and were
a way to avoid the international
peace conference that the PLO
wants. The uprising leaders al
ready have rejected the Shamir
plan.
In an interview with the inde
pendent daily Maariv, Shamir said
he saw no reason to meet in Cairo.
He said the meeting should be

in Israel and that it should merely
be a gathering of technocrats to
iron out details of his election
plan.
Shamir aide Avi Pazner later
said the prime minister did not
mean that such talks could only
be held in Israel but was "just
raising different^ossibilites."
Also yesterday, a military court
sentenced a reserve soldier to two
years in prison for causing the
death of two Palestinians in May
1988, the army said.
Army radio said Ilan Orev, 25,
was chasing stone-throwers in the
West Bank village of Bani Nairn
when he knelt, took aim and fired
two bullets into the heads of two
rioters, in violation of orders not
to open fire.
Late yesterday, 3-year-old At
tiyah el-Ghurani of the Shati ref
ugee camp died of a gunshot in
jury he suffered on Thursday, the
army said.
The army said at the time that
its troops had not opened fire in
the area but that it was checking
further. An army spokesman said
yesterday that no new details
were available.
