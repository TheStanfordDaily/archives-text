Soviet avionics
JERUSALEM (AP) - The
Syrian MiG-23 fighter jet flown
to Israel this week by a pilot
who defected contains advanced
Soviet-designed equipment
never before examined by the
West, a military official said Sat
urday.
"It is a dream come true for
every chief of intelligence to
have an enemy aircraft
which . . . can now be evaluated
and test flown," said reserve
Brig. Gen. Oded Erez, a former
Israeli fighter pilot and a former
head of air force intelligence.
The Syrian air force pilot
landed the jet in Israel Wednes
day and asked for asylum.
Erez said on Israel radio that
the MiG-23 contains advanced
avionics, missile and warning
systems and radar.
"I think we might even be
pioneers in the Western world
to have a firsthand touch with
the material," he said.
Earlier this week, Defense
Minister Yitzhak Rabin said Is
rael would share some of the

knowledge it gained from in
specting and flying the Soviet
built jet fighter.
"Of course it will serve as a
source of information for us and
the others," including the
United States, Rabin said on Is
rael television.

SAviet spy caught
WASHINGTON (AP) - A
man arrested by the FBI Sat

to the Soviets told The Wash
ington Post he is 9 former
Marine and Air Force commu
nications officer who tried to
fool the KGB.

Soviet government, the FBI said

with the KGB soon after he left
Moscow earlier this year. He
said he wanted to be a double

FBI after he offered his services
