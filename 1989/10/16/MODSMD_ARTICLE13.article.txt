Student apathy and
ASSU mismanagement
plague committees

EACH YEAR, students decry
their lack of input into the
University process on many
different issues. Yet each year the
ASSU has a difficult to impossible
time getting students to serve on
University committees.
Why? The lack of involvement is
no reflection on the importance of
the committees themselves. These
comittees, made up of students, ad
ministrators and faculty members,
set University policies on every
thing from investment responsibil
ity in South Africa to parking on
campus. For each issue, many stu
dents have gripes, criticisms and
suggestions.
But each year the number of
vacancies on these committees is
staggering. The ASSU blames stu
dent apathy, which is admittedly
part of the problem. Many of the
students who find so much fault
in the University hesitate to ex
pend their own energy changing it.
They do not actively seek infor
mation on University committees
or turn to the ASSU for sugges
tions. Instead, their interest in the
subject stops after the complaint
ends.
This is certainly not true of
every student, though. As the
ASSU's blossoming dorm represen
tatives program will attest, there
is still an active interest in student
body politics and in improving stu
dent life on campus. Among fresh
men especially, the interest and
curiosity in student body politics
is high.
Because the ASSU does a poor
job of publicizing just what these
committees do, how important they

committees do, how important they
are and how many open positions
there are, most students do not
turn to University committees.
Why should they? During the
year there is little mention of the
committees, so the importance of
their activities is minimalized. At
a more basic level, many students
don't even know what the commit
tees do. The Program Board, for
instance, doles out thousands of
dollars to various groups for pro
grams and for community service
activities.
Although many students may be
interested in this type of work, they
do not realize there is a University
committee like the Program Board
and are therefore left to dedicate
themselves to other projects, such
as dorm reps.
Publicity problems are also re
sponsible for the inefficiency at fill
ing committee vacancies. Many
students who do know what Uni
versity committees do are unaware
of when openings for these com
mittees occur. A larger number of
fliers and dorm meeting announce
ments would increase interest in
the committees.
Finally, the ASSU needs to get
its act together once the process
gets started. Stories abound of stu
dents not being contacted to be
interviewed for weeks, and after
the interview, not being told for
weeks whether or not they received
the appointment.
When these stories circulate they
detract not only from the image
of the University committees, but
also from the ASSU.
These committees play an im
portant function in the way our
University works. If students and
the ASSU continue to flounder in
apathy and mismanagement,
though, the important opportuni
ties they present to the community
will remain unused. And then our
complaints and gripes will never
become changes.
