## Where is Jackson's justice? 
### 
ON THURSDAY, along with dozens
of other students I attended court
to support Louis Jackson and the
ideals of a multicultural University that
we have all been fighting for. One thing
ran through my mind as we sat there,
waiting for the pre-trial hearing to begin:
Where is justice?
Jackson is innocent. Yet, for the six
misdemeanor charges filed against him
— trespassing, inciting to riot, battery,
unlawful assembly, obstructing police jus
tice and refusal to disperse — Jackson
may go to jail if something is not done.
Jackson did nothing different from many
other students who spoke before the af
ternoon rally. Indeed, these charges are
preposterous in light of what really hap
pened that day
For walking into Building 10 for several
minutes and asking staff inside to leave,
Jackson faces trespassing charges. It is
not illegal for a student to enter Building
10. Furthermore, the warning making it
illegal came at 4 p.m., hours after Jackson
left the building.
For being one of over two dozen stu
dents to speak before a crowd of 500
people which had already blocked the
police bus from carting the arrestees to
jail, Jackson faces charges of inciting to
riot, even though there was no riot.
For touching a secretary's elbow, a sec
retary who by her own admission did not
feel threatened in any way, Jackson faces
criminal charges of battery.
For being one of 500 people who par
ticipated in the protest outside of the
president's office, only Jackson is being
charged with unlawful assembly,

obstructing police justice and refusal to
disperse.
How can one person assemble unlaw
fully? How does one 5-foot-l, 129-pound
person obstruct 50 riot police with guns
and billy clubs?
I believe District Attorney Tom Fah
renholz is lying. His objection to the mo
tion to dismiss Jackson's batter charge
says the following:
• Jackson and six others entered Build
ing 170. The president's office is Building
10.
• The battery occurred under "riotous"
circumstances and Jackson "terrorized"
and "bullied" occupants. The secretary,
Mandy McCalla, says she was ruder to
the students than they were to her.
• Jackson grabbed McCalla by both
arms and pushed her out the door. Jack
son put one hand on her elbow for one
second to get her attention. I know — I
was there.
The district attorney is clearly playing
into racist stereotypes of how black men
allegedly "brutalize" white women in this
society by creating a completely fabri
cated report.
Yet, University President Donald Ken
nedy sees no cause for outrage. Well, I'm
outraged. I want to know, "Where is jus
tice?" And I want to know, "Where is
Don?" Does he give a damn or not?
A Stanford student is unfairly singled
out for selective prosecution. He is dis
tracted from his studies, yet the Univer
sity's response is for Vice President and
General Counsel John Schwartz to send
a letter opposing support of Jackson.
When have they ever sent top Univer
sity officials with letters to lobby for

increased support for African and Afro-
American Studies, Chicano Studies,
Asian-American Studies or Native
American Studies? Never. But they are
willing to spend precious time and money
to ensure that no one steps in to stop
this blatant miscarriage of justice.
A lot of black people on and off campus
are furious. We will not allow our brother
to go to jail for "crimes" that he did not
commit. As an African-American, I feel
personally insulted by Kennedy's apathy
and lack of concern.
If his words about multiculturalism are
more than talk, he will do something —
like write a letter to convene a meeting
with the district attorney *nd Jackson's
lawyer or pay Jackson's legal fees.
Does Kennedy want to be known for
defending racist speech or for creating a
multicultural campus, as Jackson was
fighting to do? Does Kennedy want to
see Jackson in jail for offenses he did
not commit rather than keep him on
campus, building a multicultural educa
tion which Kennedy himself claims to
desire?
If he does not, then I challenge him to
stand up and intervene in this prosecu
tion that is blatantly racist.
