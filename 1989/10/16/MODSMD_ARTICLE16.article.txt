## Some are activists just because it's 'the thing to do' 
### 
I WAS waiting in line at a local
record store when a T-shirt, worn
by one of the employees, caught
my eye. A colorful graphic of South
America and the Amazon rain forest
covered the front of the shirt, along
with the phrase, "I'd rather be a forest
than a road."
Having an interest in this issue, I
asked the employee, whom I thought
was a member of a group concerned
with this problem, why this phrase
was chosen.
The employee, annoyed by my
probing, simply said that he bought
the shirt because it looked good. The
phrase was chosen because, "It's
catchy," he said.
I'm afraid the same attitude exists
at Stanford. Too many students become
involved with an issue because it's the
thing to do, not because they are

looking the part. I hope we can now turn our
attention toward understanding it.

concerned or informed.
Every day, people sign petitions in
White Plaza without having any idea
what they're signing. Activities are
springboards to law school. Activism
has become a show, a media event and
a chance to get one's picture in The
Daily.
Words like "racism" and "sexism"
have been misapplied so frequently that
they no longer carry any meaning.

They have become incantations; their
use magically summons a crowd.
Unfortunately, this crowd is often
unconcerned with whether or not these
words are relevant to the particular
situation. And, as we have seen, its
members are only willing to play "civil
disobedience" until it starts to look bad
on the resume.
Issues concerning racism, sexism and

the environment are extremely impor
tant in modern society. But it is foolish
to combat ignorance with ignorance.
Power comes from belief, not belong
ing.
Individuals in activist groups must
be aware of the issues involved with
their cause. Leaders of these groups
must educate, not just gather signa
tures and play politics.
Those who question must not be
branded as evil and intimidated into
agreement. And the words "racism"
and "sexism" should never be allowed
to lose their strength.
It has become cool to wear the
tie-dyed T-shirt of liberalism. We're
doing a pretty good job of looking the
part. I hope we can now turn our
attention toward understanding it.
