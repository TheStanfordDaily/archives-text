# LBGCC budget cut is a case of contempt for gay community
## 
### 
I was stunned to read in Wednes
day's Daily about budget cuts at the
Lesbian, Gay and Bisexual Community
Center. As one of last year's founding
officers of the LGBCC, I negotiated
the center's proposed 1989-90 budget
with Associate Dean of Student Affairs
Michael Jackson.
I met with Dean Jackson during the
University's budget planning cycle last
winter to discuss the center's programs
and needs for funds. Jackson commit
ted to funding of $7,000 for staff
salaries plus a modest $5,000 for mate
rials, programs and other operating
expenses. Although the LGBCC officers
were disappointed, we agreed to these
funding levels given the tight budget

conditions at Stanford.
Now, Jackson is quoted as saying
that a radically reduced operating
budget of $1,500 will cover "baseline"
costs to run the center. I fail to see
how anyone could view a budget cut of
14 percent compared to the center's
first year and of 39 percent compared
to anticipated funds for 1989 as ade
quate, or as an act of good faith or
support.
These budget cuts are particularly
grotesque in light of the fact that
other community centers' budgets were
merely frozen, not cut by more than
half.
This is a clear and blatant case of
contempt and discrimination against
lesbian, gay and bisexual people at
Stanford. I call on Michael Jackson to
review the LGBCC budget, and to
reallocate scarce funds fairly among
the community centers.
