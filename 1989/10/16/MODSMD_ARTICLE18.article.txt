# University is trying to eliminate black leaders like Jackson
## 
### 
We consider the prosecution of Louis
Jackson to be a human and civil rights
issue.
As such, we in the United Stanford
Workers have a responsibility to fight
against this and other ir\justices,
whether in the work place, in the com
munity or in society at large.
With the rapid deterioration of rights
of certain citizens in this country,
there is a strong and fast-growing civil
and human rights movement. We are
part of this movement.
In the '60s, much of labor fell short
in meeting its commitment to civil
rights. We can tell you in no uncertain
terms that this will not be the case in

the '80s and '90s.
The labor movement of today, includ
ing labor councils and international
unions, has recommitted itself to be
very much part and parcel of the civil
rights movement.
We see the University administra
tion's actions as part of the overall
scheme in this nation to eliminate
progressive activists and black leaders.
We intend to organize support, not
only from union workers, but also
from hospitals, clerical and other
workers on campus.
We intend also to organize support in
other unions that come on campus and
in the Santa Clara, San Mateo, San
Francisco and Alameda County Labor
Councils, each of which represent hun
dreds of large unions.
We are here today representing labor
to demand that this ii\justice against
Jackson end now. Free Louis Jackson!
United Stanford Workers
