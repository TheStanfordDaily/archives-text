SAN FRANCISCO — Stanford students joined
approximately 60,000 demonstrators yesterday as
they marched up Market Street to defend the right
of women to have an abortion.
About 150 representatives of the Stanford Pro-
Choice Alliance and Stanford Medical Students for
Pro-Choice participated in the march, which was
sponsored by the California National Organization
of Women and the Bay Area Pro-Choice Coalition.
Suzanne Dintzis, who organized the medical stu
dent group, said legislation on abortion would affect
medical students' personal and professional lives.
"It's an issue we have to face, and a matter of life
and death for a lot of women," said Dintzis, a
biochemistry graduate student.
Pro-Choice Alliance founder Elizabeth Wahl said
the rally wi»s important to show widespread support
for abortion rights and provide a forum for discus
sion. "We want to help women exercise their right
to choose," she said.
In the past, members of the alliance have escorted
women into abortion clinics in response to the pro-

cue's attempts to block clinic
entrances.
Ellen, a sophomore who did not
want to be identified by her full
name, had more personal reasons
for participating in the march. "I
got pregnant at 20. I love children
and will make a great mother
someday, but I was in school and
needed to make a choice. I have
no regrets in having had an abor
tion," she said.
However, she said she does har
bor animosity toward members of
Operation Rescue. "At the
Portland Feminist Women's
Health Center where I had my
abortion, pro-lifers tried to block
my way to the clinic. They kept
screaming, 'Murderer! Don't kill

your baby!' "
Ellen said she is glad she had
more choices than her mother,
who survived two abortions — one
by a veterinarian. "We will not go
back," she said.
For Daria Siekhaus, a graduate
student in biochemistry, the line
is not clearly drawn. "I am still
not totally pro-abortion, but I do
believe the woman has a right to
choose," she said.
The march culminated in a rally
at the Civic Center in downtown
San Francisco. The rally included
speeches by National Organiza
tion for Women Executive Vice
President Patricia Ireland, Repre
sentatives Barbara Boxer and
Nancy Pelosi, and Norma McCor
vey, better known as 'Jane Roe.'
"I'm mad. I'm mad at those
people on the Supreme Court,"
said McCorvey, whose case, Roe
v. Wade, led to the Supreme
Court's 1973 decision legalizing

abortion in the United States.
In July, the Supreme Court
qualified this decision by uphold
ing the Webster v. Reproductive
Health Services decision, which
allows states to restrict abortion
services.
While pro-choice legislation has
recently passed in the Florida
legislature and the U.S. House of
Representatives, abortion rights
supporters said they are not let
ting their guard down.
"It's like climbing a slippery
staircase. Although we have made
progress, a misstep could lead to
further abortion restrictions. It's
that precarious," said a Stanford
English professor who did not
want to be identified.
Although police were on hand
for the march and rally, there
were no violent incidents. Opera
tion Rescue did not send any or
ganized group to demonstrate at
the rally.
