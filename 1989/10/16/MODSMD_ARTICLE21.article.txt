## American intellectuals battle with popular culture

"No Respect: Intellectuals &
Popular Culture"
by Andrew Ross
Routledge, $13.95
Reviewed by Mark Weiner
American intellectuals tradi
tionally have viewed popular cul
ture with both fear and loathing.
The American people tradition
ally have told intellectuals that
the feeling is mutual.
In "No Respect," Andrew Ross,
professor of English at Princeton
University, explains why. Ross
chronicles the history of how in
tellectuals have reacted to popular
culture, from Woody Guthrie to
Grace Jones, from pornography
to MTV.
According to Ross, intellectuals
gain much of their authority by
claiming that they have a more
discerning judgment than others
— that they have knowledge that
is superior to common sense.
This claim, he writes, has al
lowed the intelligentsia to act as
an important gatekeeper of Amer
ican society. It has allowed intel
lectuals to police the borders of
our culture, deciding what prod
ucts get in or out on the basis of
highbrow aesthetic standards.
Ross points out that American
intellectuals have a long and well
documented history of anxiety
concerning the power and
legitimacy of those standards as
they relate to the national popular
culture of the United States.
From the self-deprecating Henry
Adams to the young old fogey Nor
man Podhoretz, American intel
lectuals have felt threatened by
the "mass" culture that sur
rounds and affects them arguably
more than their European coun
terparts.
They have had good reason to
be anxious.

Intellectuals have
feared that popular
culture subjugates
the American
people to lowbrow
degeneracy.

For one, intellectuals have
feared that popular culture sub
jugates the American people to
lowbrow degeneracy. The likes of
Mick Jagger threaten the intellec
tuals "defense of the faith"
(witness Allan Bloom's "The
Closing of the American Mind"
or Herbert Marcuse's "One-
Dimensional Man").
Second, and more importantly
for Ross, the mass appeal of
popular culture questions the
very basis of the supposedly
meritocratic position intellectuals
hold in our society. Popular cul
ture, which often is self
consciously anti-intellectual, is
laced with repeated suggestions
that intellectuals and their "hig
her" standards take a hike
(witness "Back to School," the
Rodney Dangerfield movie from
which the title of Ross' book is
taken). »
American intellectuals' social
status, according to Ross, there
fore is negatively defined — in
tellectuals have cultural power to
the extent that they are disas
sociated from the popular.
With this insight into what he
calls "the politics of knowledge,"
Ross constructs a history of in
tellectual responses to popular
culture that is new, exciting and
extremely useful. "No Respect" is

not without its faults: Ross' his
tory is sometimes unsystematic
and methodologically amorphous.
Nevertheless, Ross' book is signif
icant reading for any student of
American intellectual and cultural
history.
Unlike other intellectual his
torians, Ross chooses not to focus
solely on a history of intellectuals.
Instead, he combines a history of
intellectuals with a history of
popular culture to describe their
interaction.
Using these histories "from
above" and"from below," Ross
describes strategies intellectuals
have used to perpetuate their elite
social status in response to the
changing mood of 20th century
American popular culture. He
shows how the social position and
self-perception of intellectuals and
the popular culture of their times
are deeply interconnected.
"No Respect," then, leads the
reader through a deft analysis of
both popular culture and intellec
tuals' responses to it.
For instance, Ross describes the
1930s rise of the American Com
munist Party, its embrace of
proletarian culture and its use of
"vanguard" minds. He presents a
sure description of the intellectual
culture of the Cold War. And he
leads us on a tour of the 1960s
counterculture, the rise of "pop"
and"camp" sensibilities, and the
civil rights and sexual liberation
movements.
In the process, Ross gives us a
fascinating reading of the letters
of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, an
arresting analysis of pornography
and a critique of "Candid
Camera."
Because Ross attempts to show
the interrelations between intel
lectuals and popular culture, the
cast of characters in "No Respect"
(chosen without an overarching

methodology) is extremely di
verse: Susan Sontag, Amiri
Baraka, Dwight McDonald, Bill
Cosby, Daniel Bell, Muhammad
Ali, Edward Bernays, Abbie Hoff
man, David Bowie, Sidney Hook,
William Randolph Bourne, Fats
Domino, Thelonius Monk, Philip
Rahv and Tina Turner all make
featured appearances in his story.

Although the title "No Respect"
refers to the view that American
intellectuals have of popular cul
ture, it also describes Ross' view
of the American intelligentsia.
Indeed, Ross' book is to a large
degree an extended accusation of
American intellectuals.
Intellectuals' categories of judg
ment, writes Ross, have enforced

a system of undemocratic power
relations. They have controlled
the production of knowledge and
culture either by overtly embrac
ing vanguardism or by flirting
with categories of taste, such as
camp, that allow intellectuals to
go "slumming" in the streets of

American pop. Categories of taste
such as camp and "hip," writes
Ross, "secure opportunities for in
tellectuals to sample the emo
tional charge of popular culture
while guaranteeing their immu
nity from its power to constitute
social identities that are in some
way marked as subordinate."
According to Ross, American in
tellectuals have fostered un
democratic social relations by
constructing a barrier between
themselves and the popular. They
have produced knowledge that,
predicated on the assumption of
their elite status, is politically
malicious, even unethical.
Ross thus calls for an evalua
tion and critique of intellectuals'
categories of judgment. He asks
that intellectuals concern them

selves with how they afTect the
social and political structure of
contemporary life.
"The often esoteric knowledge
which we impart," counsels Ross,
"... is readily converted into so
cial capital in the new tech
nocratic power structures."
Intellectuals, writes Ross, must
therefore not simply change their
"taste," but must redefine the
very categories that they use to
judge the products of popular cul
ture.
In particular, Ross asks that
American intellectuals learn some
lessons from recent British cul
tural studies, which have under
scored the extent to which
individuals find empowerment in
a popular culture that intellectu
als traditionally have thought to
be ideologically pernicious.
When American intellectuals
begin to learn these lessons,
forecasts Ross, they will "find

themselves lined up against the
order of cultural capital which is
the basis of their own authority
as contestants in the social world."
Intellectuals will undermine the
ideology that has upheld their so
cial class and will change the very
character of their professional
lives.
Ours is an era in which the
phrase "knowledge is power" has
become a liberal academic
platitude. Ross' book actually sup
ports this assertion with historical
evidence. "No Respect" shows
that, for American intellectuals,
knowledge and judgment of
popular culture has been ex
tremely important for the main
tenance of their social prestige, if
not their very existence.

degeneracy.

For one, intellectuals have
feared that popular culture sub
jugates the American people to
lowbrow degeneracy. The likes of
Mick Jagger threaten the intellec
tuals "defense of the faith"
(witness Allan Bloom's "The
Closing of the American Mind"
or Herbert Marcuse's "One-
Dimensional Man").
Second, and more importantly
for Ross, the mass appeal of
popular culture questions the
very basis of the supposedly
meritocratic position intellectuals
hold in our society. Popular cul
ture, which often is self
consciously anti-intellectual, is
laced with repeated suggestions
that intellectuals and their "hig
her" standards take a hike
(witness "Back to School," the
Rodney Dangerfield movie from
which the title of Ross' book is
taken). »
American intellectuals' social
status, according to Ross, there
fore is negatively defined — in
tellectuals have cultural power to
the extent that they are disas
sociated from the popular.
With this insight into what he
calls "the politics of knowledge,"
Ross constructs a history of in
tellectual responses to popular
culture that is new, exciting and
extremely useful. "No Respect" is

not without its faults: Ross' his
tory is sometimes unsystematic
and methodologically amorphous.
Nevertheless, Ross' book is signif
icant reading for any student of
American intellectual and cultural
history.
Unlike other intellectual his
torians, Ross chooses not to focus
solely on a history of intellectuals.
Instead, he combines a history of
intellectuals with a history of
popular culture to describe their
interaction.
Using these histories "from
above" and"from below," Ross
describes strategies intellectuals
have used to perpetuate their elite
social status in response to the
changing mood of 20th century
American popular culture. He
shows how the social position and
self-perception of intellectuals and
the popular culture of their times
are deeply interconnected.
"No Respect," then, leads the
reader through a deft analysis of
both popular culture and intellec
tuals' responses to it.
For instance, Ross describes the
1930s rise of the American Com
munist Party, its embrace of
proletarian culture and its use of
"vanguard" minds. He presents a
sure description of the intellectual
culture of the Cold War. And he
leads us on a tour of the 1960s
counterculture, the rise of "pop"
and"camp" sensibilities, and the
civil rights and sexual liberation
movements.
In the process, Ross gives us a
fascinating reading of the letters
of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, an
arresting analysis of pornography
and a critique of "Candid
Camera."
Because Ross attempts to show
the interrelations between intel
lectuals and popular culture, the
cast of characters in "No Respect"
(chosen without an overarching

methodology) is extremely di
verse: Susan Sontag, Amiri
Baraka, Dwight McDonald, Bill
Cosby, Daniel Bell, Muhammad
Ali, Edward Bernays, Abbie Hoff
man, David Bowie, Sidney Hook,
William Randolph Bourne, Fats
Domino, Thelonius Monk, Philip
Rahv and Tina Turner all make
featured appearances in his story.

Although the title "No Respect"
refers to the view that American
intellectuals have of popular cul
ture, it also describes Ross' view
of the American intelligentsia.
Indeed, Ross' book is to a large
degree an extended accusation of
American intellectuals.
Intellectuals' categories of judg
ment, writes Ross, have enforced

a system of undemocratic power
relations. They have controlled
the production of knowledge and
culture either by overtly embrac
ing vanguardism or by flirting
with categories of taste, such as
camp, that allow intellectuals to
go "slumming" in the streets of

American pop. Categories of taste
such as camp and "hip," writes
Ross, "secure opportunities for in
tellectuals to sample the emo
tional charge of popular culture
while guaranteeing their immu
nity from its power to constitute
social identities that are in some
way marked as subordinate."
According to Ross, American in
tellectuals have fostered un
democratic social relations by
constructing a barrier between
themselves and the popular. They
have produced knowledge that,
predicated on the assumption of
their elite status, is politically
malicious, even unethical.
Ross thus calls for an evalua
tion and critique of intellectuals'
categories of judgment. He asks
that intellectuals concern them

selves with how they afTect the
social and political structure of
contemporary life.
"The often esoteric knowledge
which we impart," counsels Ross,
"... is readily converted into so
cial capital in the new tech
nocratic power structures."
Intellectuals, writes Ross, must
therefore not simply change their
"taste," but must redefine the
very categories that they use to
judge the products of popular cul
ture.
In particular, Ross asks that
American intellectuals learn some
lessons from recent British cul
tural studies, which have under
scored the extent to which
individuals find empowerment in
a popular culture that intellectu
als traditionally have thought to
be ideologically pernicious.
When American intellectuals
begin to learn these lessons,
forecasts Ross, they will "find

themselves lined up against the
order of cultural capital which is
the basis of their own authority
as contestants in the social world."
Intellectuals will undermine the
ideology that has upheld their so
cial class and will change the very
character of their professional
lives.
Ours is an era in which the
phrase "knowledge is power" has
become a liberal academic
platitude. Ross' book actually sup
ports this assertion with historical
evidence. "No Respect" shows
that, for American intellectuals,
knowledge and judgment of
popular culture has been ex
tremely important for the main
tenance of their social prestige, if
not their very existence.

"No Respect: Intellectuals &
Popular Culture"
by Andrew Ross
Routledge, $13.95
Reviewed by Mark Weiner
American intellectuals tradi
tionally have viewed popular cul
ture with both fear and loathing.
The American people tradition
ally have told intellectuals that
the feeling is mutual.
In "No Respect," Andrew Ross,
professor of English at Princeton
University, explains why. Ross
chronicles the history of how in
tellectuals have reacted to popular
culture, from Woody Guthrie to
Grace Jones, from pornography
to MTV.
According to Ross, intellectuals
gain much of their authority by
claiming that they have a more
discerning judgment than others
— that they have knowledge that
is superior to common sense.
This claim, he writes, has al
lowed the intelligentsia to act as
an important gatekeeper of Amer
ican society. It has allowed intel
lectuals to police the borders of
our culture, deciding what prod
ucts get in or out on the basis of
highbrow aesthetic standards.
Ross points out that American
intellectuals have a long and well
documented history of anxiety
concerning the power and
legitimacy of those standards as
they relate to the national popular
culture of the United States.
From the self-deprecating Henry
Adams to the young old fogey Nor
man Podhoretz, American intel
lectuals have felt threatened by
the "mass" culture that sur
rounds and affects them arguably
more than their European coun
terparts.
