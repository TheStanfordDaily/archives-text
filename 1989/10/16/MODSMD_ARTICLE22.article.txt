## Cougars sack Stanford Three Cardinal quarterbacks tally only one touchdown 
### Mark Rogowsky Senior staff writer 
PULLMAN, Wash. - For the
second week in a row, the Stan
ford football team exited the first
quarter with a lead over a top-20
team and a feeling that an upset
was in the making.
The second period, though,
proved to be the Cardinal's "Quar
terloo" as the Washington State
Cougars scored four touchdowns
while allowing only one. Mean
while, the chilly temperatures in
Martin Stadium fell from the high
40s into the mid-30s.
When the halftime gun
sounded, the Cougars (6-1, 3-1 in
Pacific 10 Conference play) held
a 28-10 lead. Stanford (1-5, 1-3 in
the Pac-10) could manage nothing
more than a trade of field goals
in the second half and fell 31-13
in a game that saw Stanford's
quarterback controversy flare up
once again.

Cougars 31
Cardinal 13

It was the Cardinal's third loss
in a row and seventh straight on
the road. The Cardinal's last vic
tory outside Stanford Stadium
was a 38-7 trouncing of the
Oregon State Beavers at Corvallis,
Ore., on Nov. 14, 1987.
"Washington State played a
dynamite game," Stanford Coach
Denny Green said. "They're
definitely a top-15 team."
The high-powered Washington
State offense gained 521 yards in
cluding 347 through the air.
Cougar quarterback Aaron Garcia
completed only 23 of 41 passes
but racked up 16 first downs and
two touchdowns through the air.
Led by Calvin Griggs with eight
catches for 157 yards, five of Gar
cia's targets had over 25 yards
receiving on the day. "[Garcia]
played like a junior or senior,"
Stanford linebacker Jono Tunney
said. "I can't believe the guy's a
freshman.
Garcia, who started the season
as the No. 1 quarterback for the

junior varsity, wouldn't even be
playing were it not for an injury
to starter Brad Gossen. In his
three games, Gossen posted an
efficiency rating 40 points higher
than USC's Todd Marinovich, the
conference's second-rated signal
caller. Just a notch behind him is
Aaron Garcia.
The same Stanford defense that
essentially shut down Notre Dame
a week ago seemed mystified by
the Cougars. Throughout the
game, Washington State receivers
found seams in Stanford's zone
defense. Garcia repeatedly ex
ploited those openings.
Tunney placed the blame for
the Cougars' success on the
shoulders of the defense. "We
knew they were going to throw,
knew the types of routes. We just
didn't cover it,"he said. "They
just executed well, we didn't."
When Garcia wasn't throwing
the ball, the Cougar offense
chugged along behind 5-foot-7
running back Steve Broussard. In
the first half, Broussard gained
140 yards on 20 carries. That fig
ure was over half the Stanford
rushing total for the season.
Broussard finished the game with
165 yards.
His biggest play of the game
came one minute into the second
quarter. Garcia handed the ball
to Broussard who stutter-stepped,
headed for the right sideline and
scampered into the end zone for
a 71-yard touchdown.
Broussard's run was the
Cougars' longest run from scrim
mage since Ruben Mayes raced
53 yards past the Stanford defense
on Oct. 20, 1984.
Everything that is going right
with the Cougar offense is going
wrong with the Cardinal's. After
an uninspiring first half in which
he was 9 of 19 for 49 yards, Steve
Smith was benched for the second
time this season in favor of Brian
Johnson.
As he has done before, Johnson
seemed to jump start the Cardinal
in the second half. He moved
Stanford from its own 14 to the
Cougar 6 largely on the strength
of two long completions (25 and
34 yards) to Ed McCaffrey.
In addition to his propensity for

giving Stanford an emotional lift,
however, Johnson also has a
propensity for throwing intercep
tions. And, with Stanford facing
a third and goal at the Cougar
8-yard line, Johnson did just that.
He let go of the ball unaware that
Washington State's Mark Ledbet
ter was in its path.
Ledbetter picked the ball off
near the goal line and returned
it to the Washington State 35
before offensive tackle Bob Whit
field leveled him with what was
arguably the most vicious hit
delivered by a Stanford player in
1989.
The Cougars then drove the ball
37 yards before kicking a field
goal and moving ahead 31-10.
That 10-point turnaround —
Stanford's failure to score a TD
combined with the Washington
State field goal — was part of a
1-2 punch EKO, emotional knock
out, delivered by the Cougars.
The second half of the combi
nation came in the closing seconds
of the third period when Johnson
injured a knee and left the game
for good. He was replaced by
freshman John Lynch who showed
some scrambling ability but
couldn't turn things around for
the Cardinal.
"I imagine if Brian's healthy,
he'll start," Green said afterward
in an attempt to clear up the quar
terback morass. But Johnson's
knee was drained in the locker
room, and it appears doubtful
he'll be ready to go against Utah.
In the second period, the
Cougars exploded for a four-play,
74-second, 98-yard drive capped
by Broussard's run to move ahead
7-3. Stanford came back to score
on its next possession and take a
10-7 lead before the roof caved in.
Three of the Cougars' next four
offensive series ended with touch
downs and they ended in a hurry.
The Washington State scoring
drives took a mere 2:52, 1:18 and
1:34 before getting the ball in the
end zone.
By the time the dust had
settled, the Cougars led 28-10. In
the first half alone, Washington
State gained more yards (349 to
296) than Notre Damo did;in the
entire game a week ago.

ter was in its path.
Ledbetter picked the ball off
near the goal line and returned
it to the Washington State 35
before offensive tackle Bob Whit
field leveled him with what was
arguably the most vicious hit
delivered by a Stanford player in
1989.
The Cougars then drove the ball
37 yards before kicking a field
goal and moving ahead 31-10.
That 10-point turnaround —
Stanford's failure to score a TD
combined with the Washington
State field goal — was part of a
1-2 punch EKO, emotional knock
out, delivered by the Cougars.
The second half of the combi
nation came in the closing seconds
of the third period when Johnson
injured a knee and left the game
for good. He was replaced by
freshman John Lynch who showed
some scrambling ability but
couldn't turn things around for
the Cardinal.
"I imagine if Brian's healthy,
he'll start," Green said afterward
in an attempt to clear up the quar
terback morass. But Johnson's
knee was drained in the locker
room, and it appears doubtful
he'll be ready to go against Utah.
In the second period, the
Cougars exploded for a four-play,
74-second, 98-yard drive capped
by Broussard's run to move ahead
7-3. Stanford came back to score
on its next possession and take a
10-7 lead before the roof caved in.
Three of the Cougars' next four
offensive series ended with touch
downs and they ended in a hurry.
The Washington State scoring
drives took a mere 2:52, 1:18 and
1:34 before getting the ball in the
end zone.
By the time the dust had
settled, the Cougars led 28-10. In
the first half alone, Washington
State gained more yards (349 to
296) than Notre Damo did;in the
entire game a week ago.

Time ran out on the Cardinal and quarterback Brian Johnson against Washington State as the Cougars
won 31-13. Johnson hobbled out of Martin Stadium with a bruised knee, further complicating the
offensive questions for Stanford. • .l
PULLMAN, Wash. - For the
second week in a row, the Stan
ford football team exited the first
quarter with a lead over a top-20
team and a feeling that an upset
was in the making.
The second period, though,
proved to be the Cardinal's "Quar
terloo" as the Washington State
Cougars scored four touchdowns
while allowing only one. Mean
while, the chilly temperatures in
Martin Stadium fell from the high
40s into the mid-30s.
When the halftime gun
sounded, the Cougars (6-1, 3-1 in
Pacific 10 Conference play) held
a 28-10 lead. Stanford (1-5, 1-3 in
the Pac-10) could manage nothing
more than a trade of field goals
in the second half and fell 31-13
in a game that saw Stanford's
quarterback controversy flare up
once again.

Cougars 31
Cardinal 13

It was the Cardinal's third loss
in a row and seventh straight on
the road. The Cardinal's last vic
tory outside Stanford Stadium
was a 38-7 trouncing of the
Oregon State Beavers at Corvallis,
Ore., on Nov. 14, 1987.
"Washington State played a
dynamite game," Stanford Coach
Denny Green said. "They're
definitely a top-15 team."
The high-powered Washington
State offense gained 521 yards in
cluding 347 through the air.
Cougar quarterback Aaron Garcia
completed only 23 of 41 passes
but racked up 16 first downs and
two touchdowns through the air.
Led by Calvin Griggs with eight
catches for 157 yards, five of Gar
cia's targets had over 25 yards
receiving on the day. "[Garcia]
played like a junior or senior,"
Stanford linebacker Jono Tunney
said. "I can't believe the guy's a
freshman.
Garcia, who started the season
as the No. 1 quarterback for the

junior varsity, wouldn't even be
playing were it not for an injury
to starter Brad Gossen. In his
three games, Gossen posted an
efficiency rating 40 points higher
than USC's Todd Marinovich, the
conference's second-rated signal
caller. Just a notch behind him is
Aaron Garcia.
The same Stanford defense that
essentially shut down Notre Dame
a week ago seemed mystified by
the Cougars. Throughout the
game, Washington State receivers
found seams in Stanford's zone
defense. Garcia repeatedly ex
ploited those openings.
Tunney placed the blame for
the Cougars' success on the
shoulders of the defense. "We
knew they were going to throw,
knew the types of routes. We just
didn't cover it,"he said. "They
just executed well, we didn't."
When Garcia wasn't throwing
the ball, the Cougar offense
chugged along behind 5-foot-7
running back Steve Broussard. In
the first half, Broussard gained
140 yards on 20 carries. That fig
ure was over half the Stanford
rushing total for the season.
Broussard finished the game with
165 yards.
His biggest play of the game
came one minute into the second
quarter. Garcia handed the ball
to Broussard who stutter-stepped,
headed for the right sideline and
scampered into the end zone for
a 71-yard touchdown.
Broussard's run was the
Cougars' longest run from scrim
mage since Ruben Mayes raced
53 yards past the Stanford defense
on Oct. 20, 1984.
Everything that is going right
with the Cougar offense is going
wrong with the Cardinal's. After
an uninspiring first half in which
he was 9 of 19 for 49 yards, Steve
Smith was benched for the second
time this season in favor of Brian
Johnson.
As he has done before, Johnson
seemed to jump start the Cardinal
in the second half. He moved
Stanford from its own 14 to the
Cougar 6 largely on the strength
of two long completions (25 and
34 yards) to Ed McCaffrey.
In addition to his propensity for

giving Stanford an emotional lift,
however, Johnson also has a
propensity for throwing intercep
tions. And, with Stanford facing
a third and goal at the Cougar
8-yard line, Johnson did just that.
He let go of the ball unaware that
Washington State's Mark Ledbet
ter was in its path.
Ledbetter picked the ball off
near the goal line and returned
it to the Washington State 35
before offensive tackle Bob Whit
field leveled him with what was
arguably the most vicious hit
