# A's pound Giants
## Series crosses to Candlestick 
### 
OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -
Give Oakland credit for pitch
ing, power and prophecy and
give the Athletics a 2-0 lead in
the World Series.
Oakland again made short
work of San Francisco, beating
the Giants 5-1 Sunday night
and threatening to turn the
Bay Bridge meeting into a one
way affair.
"They're going about it very
professionally," Athletics man
ager Tony La Russa said. "But
it's not time to back off."
Mike Moore and two
relievers held the Giants to
four hits, one day after Dave
Stewart shut them out on just
five.
"We've scored one run in two
games and you're not going to
win too many games like that,"
Giants manager Roger Craig
said. "Their pitching can't get
too much better."
And the Giants' hitting can't
get much worse. They are bat
ting .145 in the series and Will
Clark and Kevin Mitchell are
0-for-6 with runners in scoring
position. San Francisco's only
consolation came in ending a
23-inning scoreless World Se
ries streak that began in 1962.
Terry Steinbach, playing on
a hunch by La Russa, hit a
three-run homer that made it
5-1 in the fourth. La Russa
started Steinbach, a right
handed hitter, instead of lefty
Ron Hassey at catcher against
the right-handed Rick Reus
chel.
"Terry had been swinging
well in batting practice and last
night he hit the ball hard," La
Russa said.
Steinbach did it again, end
ing any suspense early.
"I thought it was gone, but
at the Coliseum you never
know,"he said. "In my first
at-bat, I hit a ball to left field
that I thought had a chance,
but it didn't."
La Russa said Hassey will
start Game 3 on Tuesday night.
San Francisco outhomered
Oakland 141-127 this season
but the Athletics have now hit
three home runs, one more
than they hit in last year's five
game World Series loss to Los
Angeles.
Rickey Henderson, who

turned down a trade to San
Francisco and instead accepted
a deal to Oakland on June 20,
went 3-for-3 with a walk and
now has reached base in 20 of
32 postseason plate appear
ances.
Jose Canseco again didn't hit
the ball — he did walk twice
— but the Athletics didn't need
him. He got nothing in two
at-bats and is hitless in 23
World Series at-bats; the record
slump is 0-for-31 by Detroit's
Marvin Owen in the 19305.
For the Giants, a dangerous
situation has suddenly gotten
desperate. They went into the
series with only two healthy
starters, and Scott Garrelts
and now Reuschel, who lasted
two batters into the fifth, have
been hit hard.
Of the 39 teams that took a
2-0 lead in the World Series,
29 went on to win.
Bob Welch, 19-4 lifetime
against the Giants and 6-0 at
Candlestick Park, will pitch for
Oakland in Game 3 against
Don Robinson, who has not
started since Sept. 25.
From the start, Oakland did
what it needed to do while the
Giants did not. Henderson
drew a leadoff walk — an open
invitation to trouble! — stole
second and scored on Carney
Lansford's double.
Clark and Mitchell, mean
while, did not come through
for San Francisco. Their bad
showing with runners in scor
ing position early in the game
when the Giants had a chance
did not match the regular
season numbers of a combined
.343 in similar situations. They
were l-for-8 for the game with
Mitchell reaching on a single
in the fourth inning.
Matt Williams, who led all
playoff performers with nine
RBIs, went 0-for-4 and is hit
less in seven at-bats. In spring
training, when Oakland won
eight of nine against the
Giants, Williams was l-for-32
versus the Athletics.
Moore had little difficulty,
giving up four hits in seven
innings. He struck out seven
and walked one, and the Giants
pulled few balls hard against
him.
