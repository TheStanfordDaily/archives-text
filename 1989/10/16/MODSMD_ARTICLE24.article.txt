### Andrew Wilcox Staff writer 
The Cardinal men's soccer team
came excruciatingly close to pull
ing off the upset of the year yes
terday, losing 2-1 in overtime to
No. 1 Virginia in the final of the
Stanford Pacific West Classic at
Maloney Field.
For the second straight week,
an underdog Stanford squad took
a national powerhouse into over
time before losing. Last Sunday
Stanford dropped a heartbreaker
to No. 2 UCLA. The Cardinal,
which defeated Illinois State 2-0
in overtime Saturday, captured
second in the tournament and
stands at 7-7-1 on the year.
Despite starting five freshmen
and playing for much of the sec
ond half without the team's most
potent offensive threat,

midfielder-forward Rhett Harty,
the Cardinal gave the heavily
favored Cavaliers a scare before
succumbing. It was Stanford's
third straight overtime game.
Stanford Coach Sam Koch said,
"We gave Virginia a run for their
money. We played extremely well,
but man for man, they've got the
best talent in the country. We've
got to give them credit."
Virginia picked it up a notch in
overtime, with Cavalier forward
Kris Kelderman finally breaking
through 12V2 minutes into the

first extra stanza. Virginia
midfielder Jeff Bynum recorded
his second assist of the game by
chipping the ball into the middle,
where a waiting Kelderman
knocked it past Stanford
goalkeeper Chris Helling.
The Cavalier goal ended the
Cardinal chances of pulling off
what would have been an incred
ible upset. Virginia clearly was the
better team, moving the ball con
sistently with pinpoint passing
and dominating the midfield for
much of the contest.
When Virginia forward Drew
Fallon put the Cavaliers up 1-0
20 minutes into the game, it
looked as if it might be a long
day for the Stanford squad. Fallon
skied above the Cardinal defense
and headed a centering pass into
the upper-left hand corner of the
net for a picture-perfect goal.

The goal actually seemed to
wake up the Cardinal hooters,
who tested Virginia goalkeeper
Tony Meola several times before
the end of the half, while on the
defensive end, sweeper Mark
Semioli and Helling thwarted the
Cavaliers.
After a spectacular save by Hel
ling to open the second stanza,
the Cardinal's Randy Mann did
on offense what only two other
teams had done all year: score on
Meola, who also tends the nets
for the U.S. National Team.
Stanford midfielder Chris
Porch, playing despite an injured
quadricep, dribbled down the left
side and drew two Cavalier
defenders before crossing the ball
to Mann, who had slipped behind
the Cavalier defense. Mann, a
freshman, then tallied his first
collegiate goal.
