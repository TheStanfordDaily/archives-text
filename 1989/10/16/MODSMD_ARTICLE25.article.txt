# Card golfers shoot to tournament title
## 
### Brian W. Webber 
The men's golf team overcame
its only weakness — an ability to
take first place — as it captured
the team title of the U.S. Inter
collegiate, played this weekend at
the Stanford Golf Course. The
Cardinal's victory marks only its
second tournament win in four
years.
Stanford's three-day team total
of 1,106 bested runner-up Oregon
by 5 strokes.
The Cardinal linksters have
been plagued by inconsistency
throughout their last two seasons.
The squad's performance this
weekend, however, was the oppo
site as the squad posted rounds
of 371, 368, and 367.
Coach Wally Goodwin was
"thrilled" with his team's
showing. Goodwin felt confident
the momentum of the win could
propel the Cardinal to further suc
cess this season.
"This may only be our first vic
tory, but it won't be our last.
With our experience and maturity,
we should play as well as we did,"
Goodwin said.
The team was bolstered by the
fine play of its seniors: Brad
Benbrook, Don Christiansen,
Marc Funseth and Josh Zander.
None posted a round worse than
77 this weekend.

Benbrook's 218 total placed him
fourth overall. He was four
strokes off the pace set by Miami's
Dennis Postlewaite, who success
fully defended his individual title.
"We're putting it all together
as a team. The seniors are looking
to go out in style, as the whole
team finally realizes its potential,"
Benbrook said.
Zander emphasized the team's
depth as a crucial factor in Stan
ford's success. "I gain confidence
in my own game when I know
that I'm joined by good players,
" he explained.
The seniors' outstanding
showing proved to be especially
important, as sophomore Chris
tian Cevaer experienced an un
characteristically slow start. After
rounds of 74 and 76, Stanford's
number one golfer recovered to
card a 71 in the final day of com
petition.
While expressing disappoint*
ment about his own play, Cevaer
found the the team's victory es
pecially satisfying.
In his first appearance on the
collegiate circuit, redshirt fresh
man Chris Doble played a
role in the Cardinal's win. His
opening scores of 73 and 75 helped
to keep the squad within striking
distance on the first two days.
