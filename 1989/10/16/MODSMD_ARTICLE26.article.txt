BERKELEY, Calif. — Sometimes the final score
of a game just does not convey the success of a
team. Yesterday, after marking up a 3-0 victory on
Saturday against U.S. International, the 19th
ranked Stanford women's soccer team fought No.
15 California to a 0-0 overtime tie. The Stanford
squad left the field with relieved smiles on their
faces, however.

"Under the conditions, we have to be very
satisfied with the outcome," Coach Berhane An
deberhan said. "That field has to be the worst field
we will ever have to play on."
The Cardinal women, who have never beaten Cal
in the history of the series, had a tremendous task
before them when they arrived at the rough, slanted
Strawberry Field, which barely met regulation size
standards. Cal (11-2-1), riding the momentum of an
impressive 2-1 victory over fifth-ranked Santa Clara
on Thursday, fielded a very physical, talented team,
and, early in the game, the referee made it evident
that he had no intention of limiting the elbowing
and pushing on the field. Using his whistle as little
as possible in the early going, the referee set the
tone for a free-for-all game.
"Cal gains momentum from exerting physical
pressure," Andeberhan said. "We needed to control
our emotions so that we kept focused and did not
forget our game plan."
After losing junior midfielder Jen Bloomer to an
injury at Thursday's practice, Stanford, 8-3-1, ad
justed its game plan to survive Cal's unrestricted
physical pressure. Instead of utilizing their usual
collected possession build-up, the Cardinal resorted
to a slower, more protective strategy. With Andeber
han encouraging the team "Not to make the game
too exciting," Stanford played a very collected, com
posed game, and, by the second half, the Cardinal
had shifted five players into the defensive backfield.
The strategy paid off thanks in a large part to
the tremendous efforts of junior goalie Elise Ed
wards. With the Bears firing 24 shots on goal and
the game being played mainly in Stanford's defensive
half, Edwards quick diving saves salvaged the score
less tie. In comparison, Stanford took only five shots
— none in the second half — on Bear goalie Mara
Bloom.
"I had a lot of nervous excitement back in the
goal, but the defense played an incredible game. We
had a hard time containing [U.S. national team
MVP Joy] Biefeld, but we were able to shut her
down," Edwards said.
At Maloney Field on Saturday morning, junior
Jennifer "Rocket" Rowland took the lead role by
scoring all three goals in the Cardinal victory over
U.S. International (5-9). After hearing Andeberhan
exhort the team to get started at the opening whistle
throughout the season, Rowland put the Cardinal
on the scoreboard just 36 seconds into the game.
