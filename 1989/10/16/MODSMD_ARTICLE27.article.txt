# Spikers clobber Devils and Cats

### David Earnest Senior staff writer 
The Stanford women's volley
ball team looked good in this
weekend's matches against
Arizona and Arizona State. But
more importantly, the team looked
well on Friday and Saturday
night.
The women could see so well,
in fact, that they saw what was
going to happen before it did. With
that kind of foresight, winning is
just a formality.

Cardinal 3, Sun Devils 0

For instance, in game two of
Saturday's three-game sweep of
ASU, Stanford Coach Don Shaw
yelled out "dump" before ASU
setter Noelle Fridrich dumped the
ball over the net, resulting in an
easy dig for Stanford. A few points
* later, Stanford was receiving
serve when sophomore Kristin
Klein called "my ball" before the
Sun Devils served. Sure enough,
the ball came to Klein and Stan
ford sided out.
The only thing the women
couldn't foresee was that they
would have such a relatively easy
time snapping their three-match
losing streak this weekend. The
Cardinal defeated the ninth
ranked Wildcats 15-13, 7-15, 15-
13, 15-6 Friday night prior to
dominating the Sun Devils 15-4,
15-10, 15-7 Saturday night. Stan
ford upped its record to 10-5 over
all and 6-3 in the Pacific 10
Conference.
"We're really pleased with the
way we're progressing and it
showed both nights," Shaw said.
"We were pretty good fFriday]

night for long stretches of time
... with only one msyor lapse at
the end of the second game. But
[Saturday night] we really had
very few."
Not only did the victories dem
onstrate that the Cardinal is play
ing more consistently, they also
displayed the improved play of
Stanford's young players. Oden
hit .667 against ASU and added
eight block assists. Freshman
Kristi Paaso, making her first
start Friday night, tallied eight
digs against Arizona before hit
ting .294 against ASU.
But the weekend's star was
freshman Carrie Feldman. Not
only did she start at setter in both
matches, Feldman hit an astound
ing .857 for the weekend and con
tributed 16 digs. For her
performances, Feldman was
nominated for Pac-10 Player of
the Week honors.
"I think everybody has started
coming on, and I think that's
partly because I started connect
ing more with the sets," Feldman
said after Friday's match. "I
wasn't really thinking about the
(three losses in a row). We were
thinking more about winning . ..
and trying to play well."
"I was trying to go hard and
keep my intensity up," Paaso said.
"It makes me happy that I was
able to play well. It was a good
opportunity to get in there, to be
intense and play hard."
Stanford played what may have
been its best match of the year
against ASU. The Cardinal com
mitted only one service error, an
improvement in a category that
has hurt Stanford all year. The
team also totaled a .378 hitting
percentage while holding the Sun
Devils to only .093.
"We just need to be steady and
do the best we can," Shaw said.
