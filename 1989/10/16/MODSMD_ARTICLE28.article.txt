## 
### Forrester Johnson 
Stanford sophomore Alex O'Brien
capped off a grueling three days of
tennis Sunday with a 7-6, 6-7, 7-6
victory over California's top-seeded
Doug Eisenman to win the Rolex Di
vision One Regional Tennis Champi
onships at Cal State-Hayward.
Both the men's and women's tennis
teams have been unanimously ranked
No. 1 in preseason polls. The women
are the four-time defending national

champions and the men have won the
national title twice in a row.
O'Brien, who played 11 sets on Sat
urday, fought off numerous match
points in the third set before finally
winning the tiebreaker 11-9. With the
victory, O'Brien earned a trip to Min
neapolis for the Rolex National In
doors in February.
O'Brien was not the Cardinal's only
bright spot this weekend. "Glenn
Solomon looked good, especially in his
first match," said Coach Dick Gould.

Unfortunately, Solomon met O'Brien
in the semifinals, losing 6-2, 6-0.
Freshman Alexis Hombrecher was
the third Cardinal to reach the semis,
but lost 6-4, 6-4 to Eisenman. In dou
bles play, Solomon and Jason Yee lost
to Pedersen and Stroyman of Cal in
the quarterfinals 6-4, 6-2, while
O'Brien and Hombrecher lost to the
same pair in the next round 7-6, 6-7,
6-4.
The Rolex Championships was just
a fall tune-up, though, with league

play scheduled for the spring. "It was
a good chance to get a little fall work
in and to see where the team stands,"
said Gould, "but next week is the big
one." Stanford next heads to the Volvo
All-American Tournament in Athens,
Ga.
Only two players from each section
of the country qualify for the All-
American tourney, while the rest of
the field is filled with last year's top
10 players and two wild card spots.
