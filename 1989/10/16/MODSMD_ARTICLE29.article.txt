9-6.

On the line was a 13-game win
ning streak and the possibility of
falling in the rankings. Stanford
entered Saturday's game at
deGuerre Pool ranked No. 3, while
Pepperdine was No. 4. They had
to win, but they did not.

"This (game) was huge," junior
Rick McNair said. "We're going
to drop in the rankings and they
are going to rise. Now we will
have to beat teams ahead of us."
"Pepperdine is the best offen
sive team in the country," Coach
Dante Dettamanti said. "I thought
we played pretty well. Our defense
was fine, I'm just upset with our
shooting. We just could not get
the ball in the goal. McNair was
pretty much our offense."
Pepperdine opened the scoring
three and a half minutes into the
first quarter when Jeff Clark put
one in from the 2-meter mark.
McNair evened the score up at
one with an upper corner shot
from five meters out, but the
quarter ended in Pepperdine's fa
vor when its leading scorer, Sasa
Poljak, scored from 2-meters.
An ejection of Jon Swerdloff led
to Pepperdine's third goal of the
game, and the second quarter
ended with Stanford behind 3-1.
Dettamanti was confident at the
half.

"I told them we could do it,"
he said. "We just had to come
back strong."
It was Poljak who came out
strong, however, as he scored his
second goal a minute into the sec
ond half to make the score 4-1.
Stanford missed its third six-on
five opportunity when a Steve
Millham shot was stopped, but
Pepperdine continued to roll as
Rob Sutter scored to put the
Waves up 5-1.
"Our six-on-fives hurt us the
most," Dettamanti said. "We
pretty much got shut out. We had
counter-attack chances, we had
shots in the front court — it just
seems that every third game we
have trouble getting the ball in
the goal."
This was not the case Friday
against USC. The team let its of
fensive guns open up and took its
first Pacific 10 Conference win in
a walk-over, 14-5. The team led
6-3 at halftime and widened the
lead to 10-5 after the third quar
ter.
