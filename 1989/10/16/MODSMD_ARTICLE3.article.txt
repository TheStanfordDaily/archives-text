# Cowell alters coverage plan

Cowell Student Health Center will no longer re
imburse students who use the Stanford Medical
Center's emergency room as an alternative to
Cowell's urgent-care infirmary.
Until this quarter, the student health center paid
for "appropriate" costs incurred by students at the
medical center, according to John Dorman, assistant
director of Cowell.
Appropriate costs included services that Cowell
would perform in the same situation or life
threatening situations that could not be handled at
Cowell.
However, this practice often led to a "sticky sit
uation, since what the student felt was appropriate
and what we felt was appropriate might differ,"
Dorman said.
For example, a student who came to Cowell with
an ankle injury after regular business hours would
be given ice, an Ace bandage and crutches. But the
student would be told to come back the next day
for an X-ray since the need to call in a technician
makes X-rays more expensive at night.
While a student could get a
nighttime X-ray at the medical
center, Cowell would only reim
burse the student for the lesser
cost of a daytime X-ray.
"It does not really matter, even
if it was a serious ankle injury,
whether the X-ray was done im
mediately or the next day," Dor
man said.
Cowell will still reimburse stu
dents when they are referred by
its practitioners to area health
centers for services unavailable at
Cowell. Urgent care at Cowell is
also still free to registered stu

dents.
The new policy is designed to
free Cowell employees from de
ciding what is an appropriate cost
at the medical center, Dorman
said. Now, students will not be
reimbursed for any services at the
medical center, including those
that are available at Cowell or
emergencies.
Under the new policy, students
must file a claim with their per
sonal insurance company instead.
However, students who subscribe
to Stanford-sponsored health in
surance would only be covered in
certain cases, Dorman said.
"Stanford health insurance is
cheaper than other insurance be
cause Cowell is the primary care
giver and they pick up the cost,"

Dorman said. Except under ex
treme circumstances, students
covered by Stanford insurance
must use Cowell services to be
reimbursed, he explained.
Stanford-sponsored insurance
is $137 per quarter.
But some students believe the
new policy is not in the best in
terest of students. "Cowell should
pay for the best care for the stu
dent," said junior Jill Banatoski.
Graduate student Bob Davis has
been on the Stanford-sponsored
plan since health insurance be
came mandatory last fall. "It
seems really incomprehensible
that the rate increases on the in
surance almost every quarter
while the coverage decreases," he
said.
