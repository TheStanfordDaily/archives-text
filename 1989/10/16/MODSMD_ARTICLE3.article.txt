# Cowell alters coverage plan

Cowell Student Health Center will no longer re
imburse students who use the Stanford Medical
Center's emergency room as an alternative to
Cowell's urgent-care infirmary.
Until this quarter, the student health center paid
for "appropriate" costs incurred by students at the
medical center, according to John Dorman, assistant
director of Cowell.
Appropriate costs included services that Cowell
would perform in the same situation or life
threatening situations that could not be handled at
Cowell.
However, this practice often led to a "sticky sit
uation, since what the student felt was appropriate
and what we felt was appropriate might differ,"
Dorman said.
For example, a student who came to Cowell with
an ankle injury after regular business hours would
be given ice, an Ace bandage and crutches. But the
student would be told to come back the next day
for an X-ray since the need to call in a technician
makes X-rays more expensive at night.
