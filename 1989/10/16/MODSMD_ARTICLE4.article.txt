# Bulletin boards link Stanford to the world

Where does Stanford turn for
fast-breaking news, lively discus
sion of campus issues and an end
less supply of erotic short fiction?
No, it's not The Daily, the ASSU,
or the Bookstore.
The answer is USENET, an in
ternational network of computer
bulletin boards.
USENET allows computer
users worldwide to post and read
notices on a system of electronic
bulletin boards called "news
groups." Each news group focuses
on one subject and is distributed
to a certain geographical area.
Subjects range from cooking to
sex to the Beatles; distribution
areas range from the Stanford
campus to the entire world.
The first computer bulletin
board, created by two Duke Uni
versity graduates in 1979, served
two computers in North Carolina.
Today USENET is available to
millions of computers all over the
world.
Dan Kolkowitz, co-admin
istrator of USENET at Stanford,
estimates that thousands of
people on campus use the system
daily. But USENET has not al
ways been so popular — or so
versatile.
"It's amazing how much it's
grown over the last four or five
years," said John Reuling, an em
ployee of the School of Medicine
who is partially responsible for
the system's maintenance.

What was once a predominantly
technical forum used "primarily
by computer scientists and en
gineers" is now "a huge collection
of news groups" addressing a va
riety of non-technical topics,
Reuling said.
One such topic is sex. The news
group "alt.sex" provides erotic
stories, discussion of sexual ethics
and helpful hints on technique.
Another group, "rec.humor,
funny," devoted to humor, was
banned from Stanford last winter
because administrators found its
content racist and sexist. The Fac
ulty Senate later reinstated the
group.
Current policy on information
entering the Stanford USENET
system, Kolkowitz said, is
"everything goes."
Other USENET groups focus
on current events. Last May, the
network was used extensively by
students seeking accurate infor
mation about events in China.
Recently, the Stanford system
acquired a new set of news groups,
called "ClariNet," which provides
up-to-date wire service reports on
u variety of subtopics from politics
to disasters.
Information from USENET
groups worldwide enters the Stan
ford computer network via a cen
tral computer at Academic
Information Resources. This ma
chine receives and passes on about
five megabytes of information
each day.
