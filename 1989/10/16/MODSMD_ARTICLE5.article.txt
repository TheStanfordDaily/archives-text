# SLAC discovery leads to scientific dispute European lab charges inferior results and intentional upstaging
## 
### Dan Cory 
An international scientific dis
pute has resulted from the Stan
ford Linear Accelerator Center's
announcement last week that it
had determined the number of
families of elementary particles.
Physicists at CERN, the main
European particle physics labo
ratory, have accused SLAC of
hurrying its results to press
before CERN in order to upstage
what are expected to be far bet
ter results. SLAC has denied the
charge, claiming that its results
are "clearly prior."
After six years of construction
and frenzied physics experi
ments, a matter of hours
separated the announcements by
both labs of the confirmation of
the Standard Model, the theory
governing most of particle
physics.
In a field where a trillionth of
a second is a long time, priority
is often established by a matter
of a few hours. This latest dis
pute is not the first SLAC dis
covery that has been marred by
questions of who was first to
discover.
A simultaneous finding at
SLAC and Brookhaven National
Laboratory of the J/psi particle
in 1974 led to a bitter priority
fight lasting nearly two years.
The dispute was only resolved
when the researchers, Burton
Richter of SLAC and Samuel

Ting of Brookhaven, were jointly
awarded the Nobel Prize in
1976.
The six-year race between
CERN and SLAC focused on the
Z particle, a particle necessary
for the weak nuclear force,
which is responsible for radioac
tivity and other phenomena.
The Z particle was first found
by CERN in 1983, and Carlo
Rubbia — head of that team,
now director of the entire labo
ratory and widely described as
power-hungry — took the 1984
Nobel Prize in Physics for the
discovery.
After finding the first Z,
CERN built the Large Electron

The dispute is a clash
of two particle
physics titans: SLAC
director Burton Rich
ter and CERN director
Carlo Rubbia.

Positron collider, a 17-mile cir
cumference, $1 billion atom
smasher. At the same time,
SLAC modified its existing two
mile-long collider at a cost of
$115 million to produce Z par
ticles.
The SLAC collider has
produced about 500 Z particles
since April. Dubbed a 'Z factory,'
LEP has produced 11,000 Z par
ticles since September.
SLAC announced the results
of its Z particle studies Thursday
afternoon, just hours before
CERN planned a similar an
nouncement but with more ac
curate data.
Jack Steinberger, head of one
of the teams at CERN, told The
New York Times, "The people
at Stanford knew perfectly well
that we were going to do this.
They timed their press confer
ence to be ahead of us."
Michael Riordan, spokes
person for SI .AC, denied that the
announcement was specifically

timed to beat CERN. "This is
just a bit of sour grapes on their
part," he said. "fWe'rel not
trying to pull any wool over
anyone's eyes."
Riordan also pointed out that
the results from SLAC were first
announced at a conference at
Madrid a few weeks ago. The
newest results are slightly more
accurate since SLAC waited an
extra month to get another 150
Z particles.
Riordan called the announce
ment from CERN "wonderful
confirmation of our results." He
also said that scientists at SLAC
look forward to CERN improving
the results in the near future.
