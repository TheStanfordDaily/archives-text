Literacy study aims to expand
Stanford Literacy Project is looking to turn
over a new leaf.
Three years after its conception, the program
hopes to encourage more University financial sup
port by becoming the Stanford Center for the
Study of Literacy.
The Literacy Project, started in 1986 by current
director Pedro Castaneda, provides Stanford em
ployees with an opportunity to learn English or
Spanish, making it easier tor them to commu
nicate with co-workers. Students, staff and faculty
members tutor workers twice a week.
"Learning the language makes the worker more
confident and effective — not only in the work
place, but also in life," said Winston Wheeler,
assistant director of the project.
Castaneda said he hopes the name change will
increase funding for the project by tying it to
academics and research. "There would be a board
of directors and faculty to do research on teaching
techniques, studies of literacy, etc. We encourage
any interested professors to become involved in
planning," he said.
The project is currently funded on a contract
basis with each University department. Funding
"fluctuates according to how many workers each
department enrolls," Castaneda said. "It would
be more cost-effective and efficient if the Uni
versity was to make the funding centralized," he
added.
Last year, the project received a $100,000 grant
from the California State Department of Educa
tion to help it teach English and civics to tem

porary residents.
This quarter, about 35 tutors and 50 employees
are involved in the project
"Most of the [workers] come from Food Service,
Housekeeping, and Operations and Maintenance
and are Hispanic, Asian, Hungarian, German and
Filipino," Castaneda said. "It's very exciting be
cause you have all these employees with very
varied backgrounds meeting on a one-to-one basis
with Stanford students."
