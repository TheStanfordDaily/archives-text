## South African government releases anti-apartheid activists 
### 
SOWETO, South Africa (AP) — Eight
leaders of the anti-apartheid movement
became free men yesterday, six of them
after at least 25 years in jail, find told
rejoicing supporters that equality for
blacks in South Africa is in reach.
Walter Sisulu, 77, a friend and col
league of African National Congress
leader Nelson Mandela, proudly
presided over the first news conference
held by the organization in South Africa
since it was banned in 1960.
"Our determination has never been
weakened by our long years of imprison
ment," Sisulu told scores of reporters
and hundreds of ANC followers who
packed a church hall. "We have been
strengthened by the developments in our
country and our own clear vision of the
future."
Some in the crowd wept as the freed
prisoners, raising clenched fists, led
their supporters in singing "God Bless
Africa," the anthem of the anti
apartheid movement.
Sisulu and six other ANC members
were freed early yesterday. Also freed
was Jafta Masemola, 58, of the Pan-
Africanist Congress, a smaller guerrilla
movement.
The releases are viewed as a tacit
acknowledgement by the government of
the ANC's influence and popularity
among South Africa's black majority.
Even relatively conservative black
leaders have said they will reject any
negotiations with the government un
less the ANC is legalized and its jailed
leaders freed.
Sisulu and his colleagues, seated in
front of a large green, gold and black
ANC flag, expressed regret that Man
dela remains in prison and said they
would press for his release.
They said the ANC, the largest group
fighting the white-led government, will
continue its military campaign and re
ject calls for negotiations until the gov

'Our determination has
never been weakened by
our long years of im
prisonment.'

ernment legalizes it, lifts the state of
emergency, and releases all political pris
oners.
"If the government doesn't meet our
demands, we have no alternative but
to continue to fight for our freedom,"
said Andrew Mlangeni, 63.
Five of the ANC men, including
Sisulu and Mlangeni, were arrested in
1963 and sentenced to life prison terms
in 1964, along with Mandela, for plot
ting anti-government sabotage.
The others freed Sunday were Elias
Mostsoaledi, 65; Ahmed Kathrada, 60;
Raymond Mhlaba, 68; Wilton Mkwayi,
67; and Oscar Mpetha, 80, who had
been hospitalized in Cape Town and was
the nation's oldest political prisoner.
Mpetha, who had been serving a five
year prison term for terrorism, rose
from his wheelchair yesterday to walk
by himself into his small home near
Cape Town before flying to Johannes
burg for the news conference.
The ANC seven spoke directly to their
supporters after the news conference.
"We are not the heros. You are the
heros," said Kathrada.
Sisulu said they were confident they
will live to see "a government that in
cludes blacks ... a democratic method
where a black man can become presi
dent, or a white man can become pres
ident."
President F.W. de Klerk announced
the unconditional release of the eight
tommrrow as part of his attempt to
improve political conditions for

negotiating a new constitution that will
extend political rights to blacks. But he
envisions some arrangement under
which whites would retain veto power
over major decisions.
Under the current system of apart
heid, the black majority has no voice
in national affairs.
Sisulu acknowledged that under de
Klerk, who took power in mid-August,
"the government is beginning to be
sensitive to the issues affecting the
people of South Africa."
But until the ANC's conditions for
talks are met, Sisulu said, "It is the
duty of the leadership to pressurize the
government in every conceivable way,
in an orderly and disciplined manner."
The ANC leaders said they will seek
passports to travel to the ANC's exile
headquarters in Lusaka, Zambia, to con
sult with their colleagues.
Mandela, 71, the most prominent
jailed ANC leader, is held in a former
staff house on a prison farm, although
his release within the next few months
is widely expected.
"There can be no real joy about our
release when we think of the comrades
we left behind," Sisulu said. "This is
another half-measure (by the govern
ment)."
There has been speculation Mandela
does not want to go free until the gov
ernment takes further steps to legalize
ANC political activity.
"The ANC leader clearly understands
the power he wields," wrote political
analyst Gary Van Staden in The Star
newspaper of Johannesburg yesterday.
"If, by remaining in jail, he can achieve
the unbanning of his and other organ
izations and strengthen the ANC's po
sition in the negotiation process, then
his own history suggests he will opt for
the tough choice."
