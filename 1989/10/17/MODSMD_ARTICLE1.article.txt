# You can look it up
## New Health Library allows students to read about, understand illnesses 
### Jeff Brock 
Now, when Stanford students
wake up with an odd assortment
of coughs and sniffles, they have
some place to go besides Cowell
Student Health Center.
Students can look up those
symptoms and perhaps under
stand the illness at Stanford
Hospital's new Health Library in
the Stanford Shopping Center,
which opened Aug. 28 and had its
official dedication ceremony Sun
day.
"The library allows students
and others to identify problems
and to do it fairly anonymously,"
Stanford Hospital Board of Direc
tors member Shirley Matteson
said. "It's a resource we've never
had."
The new library is open to the
Stanford student population and
the Palo Alto community without
charge.
The library was the brainchild
of Jeanne Kennedy, the hospital's
Director of Community and Pa
tient Relations, and Kristine Er
ving, currently a co-director of the
library. Over five years the library
evolved from a dream for easily
accessible health information to
a reality which is "a window for
Stanford and the community,"
Kennedy said.
"The library grew out of what
our patients wanted â€” and every
thing we do is for our patients,"
she explained.
The realization of the library
was not easy, said Kennedy, Er
ving and Linda Romley-Irvine,
also a library co-director. The
hardest part, they said, was find
ing the initial funding.
"The financial backing of the
hospital provided the catalyst,"
Romley-Irvine said, but more
money had to be found. Then, in
Nov. 1988, the Stanford Shopping
Center donated a five-year lease
valued at $225,000 for a 1,100
square-foot space along Elec
tioneer Court, near the back en
trance of the Emporium
department store.
Six more co-sponsors, including
the Palo Alto Medical Foundation,
Stanford University Clinic,
Children's Hospital at Stanford,
Menlo Medical Clinic, Childrens'
Health Council and Stanford
Family Studies Center, joined in

the contribution to the library.
These seven sponsors and the
hospital created an Advisory
Board and a Content Review Com
mittee, Kennedy said. Books avail
able at the library cover a variety
of issues, ranging from adoles
cence to women's health and in
clude those written for a general
audience as well as medical
textbooks.
There are also newsletters,
medical journals and newspaper
clippings, as well as video and au
dio tapes. In addition, there are
files on community health re
sources and information sheets on
physicians. Interested patrons
need only stop by the library and
ask for a card, Kennedy said. The
card enables patrons to check out
most materials.
Although the shelves are now
only one-third full, the library will
be complete by the end of 1990.
The books will eventually be listed
on Socrates, the University com
puter reference system, Romley-
Irvine said. Librarians can also
conduct computer searches to
help students find the information
they need, she said. j
The future of the library
depends upon its patrons, the co
directors agreed. "The bottom line
with other tenants in the Shop
ping Center is revenue. With the
library, it's how often we're used,"
Erving said. The library, which
opened in August with no adver
tising, had 800 patrons in the first
four weeks, Kennedy said.
