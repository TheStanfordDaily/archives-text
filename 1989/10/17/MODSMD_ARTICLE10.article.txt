# Chemical weapons plan attacked
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Presi
dent Bush's plan to curb chemical
weapons raised concerns in Con
gress on Monday and may anger
other nations because it could af
fect a multilateral pact already
partially negotiated.
The changes apparently would
give the United States the right
to continue producing chemical
weapons after the treaty was
signed, and would allow the
United States to maintain a por
tion of its stockpile until all na
tions capable of making chemical
weapons sign the proposed treaty.
The shift "is going to cause a
little commotion in the negotia
tions," said an administration
arms control expert who spoke on
condition of anonymity. "It will
cause us difficulties in Geneva,"
where the multilateral negotia
tions are under way.
Senate Majority Leader George
Mitchell said Monday that "unless
the president clarifies his position
on this issue — makes a decision
and makes it known — it is likely
that little progress will be made
in Geneva toward achieving the
multilateral treaty prohibiting
chemical weapons which the pres
ident, ironically, has stated is one
of his highest priorities."
Bush, as vice president in 1984,
carried a draft text to the Geneva

negotiations proposing that na
tions signing a chemical weapons
ban cease producing such arms
right away and destroy their
stockpiles over a 10-year period.
About 40 nations are taking part
in those talks, which resume in
November.
On Sept. 25, Hush proposed in
a speech to the United Nations
that the United States and the
Soviet Union cut their existing
chemical stockpiles by 80 percent
as an impetus to the Geneva ne
gotiations.
But Bush has also signed a clas
sified order allowing the Pentagon
to continue prtxhicinß a new gen
eration of chemical weapons for
an unspecified period of time, ac
cording to administration officials
who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
It is the unannounced and un
explained shift on the production
of chemicals weapons that critics
say will stimulate rather than
curb chemical weapons prolifera
tion.
Although Soviet Foreign Minis
ter Eduard Shevardnadze imme
diately applauded Bush's U.N.
speech, the Kremlin is concerned
over the classified order to con
tinue production of a new gener
ation of chemical weapons, said a
Soviet diplomat.

"There is some controversy over
this," said the Soviet diplomat
who spoke on condition he not be
further identified. Administration
officials discussed the U.N. speech
with Shevardnadze beforehand,
"but we were not told about the
continued production" said the
diplomat.
Members of Congress are ur
ging the president to explain and
reconsider his shift.
Mitchell, D-Maine, called Bush's
stance a "m£yor step backward."
"Timidity, mixed signals, incon
sistent statements — all of which
is what has been coming from the
administration — couln result in
the loss of an historic opportunity
to prevent the spread of chemical
arsenals around the world,"
Mitchell said in a Senate speech.
The chairman of the House
Foreign Affairs Committee, Rep.
Dante Fascell, D-Fla., said on Oct.
12 that he was disturbed by "the
conflicting statements that are
coming out from the administra
tion concerning continued chemi
cal weapons production and a
treaty."
Another congressman, Rep. Jim
Moody, I)-Wis., on the same day
called the new stance "a very
serious reversal in George Bush's
historic position."
