Call for democracy

democracy demonstrators marched through

Official media said, in their first prompt report
of such a protest, that "tens of thousands of
citizens" participated.
Security was increased in East Berlin, the na
tion's capital. Knots of police and other security
forces could be seen on many streets.
Activists reported no incidents in Leipzig,

Oct. 9 after a month in which tens of thousands
of East Germans had fled to the West.
Egyptian, Libyan leaders meet
MERSA MATRUH, Egypt (AP) - Libyan
leader Moammar Gadhafi and President Hosni
Mubarak spoke of reconciliation after meeting
Monday, but they provided no real signs of ending
one of the Arab world's worst feuds.
The North African leaders, bitter enemies until
last spring, spoke after meeting privately for two
hours at a government beach house on the
Mediterranean Sea. It was their second fence
mending session this year after 16 years of fric
tion that peaked in a five-day border war in July
1977.
Both leaders spoke to reporters after the meet
ing, but they offered only general comments and
refused to answer questions. Neither mentioned
any significant concrete steps to bolster relations.
