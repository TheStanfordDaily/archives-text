Alleged battery was not
during 'riot,' charge
should be dropped

THE UGLY singling out of
junior Louis Jackson for his
role in the May 15 takeover
of Building 10 got uglier in Thurs
day's court proceedings.
In a pre-trial conference, the dis
trict attorney actively opposed a
motion by Jackson's lawyer to drop
the battery charge Jackson faces
— even though the "victim" of the
battery has stated she has no com
plaint against Jackson. Mandy
McCalla, the secretary against
whom Jackson allegedly committed
a battery, has signed a civil com
promise agreement.
Quite often, such an agreement
is sufficient reason to have such a
charge dismissed.
But not in Jackson's case.
Now, the district attorney's op
position to dropping the charge
rests on his claim that the alleged
battery took place during a "riot."
In an official statement of oppo
sition to the motion by Jackson's
lawyer, the district attorney cites
Penal Code Section 1377, which
states that a defendant is not en
titled to a civil compromise if the
alleged misdemeanor takes place
"riotously."
"The unruly assembly described
in the police report of this case
appears to qualify it as a riot," the
statement of opposition says. "Cer
tainly, defendant and his more than
forty associates terrorized and
bullied the occupants of Building
170 (sic) in an effort to draw at
tention to their private cause."
Perhaps the initial early

morning takeover of Building 10
was somewhat unruly, and most
likely there was some confusion —
but it was not a riot.
According to the definition pro
vided in the district attorney's
statement, a riot is a "tumultuous
disturbance of the peace," executed
"in a violent and turbulent manner,
to the terror of the people."
Such a description stands in
stark contrast to the recounting of
events offered to police by McCalla
and Asst. to the President Bob
Hamrdla, the two employees in
Building 10 when it was taken over.
McCalla states that several stu
dents involved in the takeover
"tried politely to persuade" her to
leave, and that she "at no time"
felt "physically threatened." "In
fairness," McCalla concludes, "I
would have to say that I was much
ruder to the students than they
were to me."
Hamrdla states that upon
leaving Building 10, he locked his
files, turned off his computer,
gathered a few belongings and a
couple of things he thought he
could work on elsewhere and was
escorted down the stairs and out
the back door. He states that he
was not touched by anyone during
these events.
The district attorney states that
because of the "riotous" conditions
the morning of May 15, the charge
against Jackson "is not a case of
simple battery," but is rather a
"much broader" violation, for
which a civil compromise agree
ment "does not vindicate the public
injury involved."
The real crimes here, however,
are vindictive pursuit of Jackson
on the battery charge by the dis
trict attorney and the University's
simple refusal to support one of
its students who is the victim of
selective prosecution.
