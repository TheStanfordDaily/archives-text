Setting the record straight on the Robby Perkins case

THE DAILY article on the Wed
nesday ASSU Senate discussion
of bill XX-COP-IO ("To Support
Equal Justice for Louis Jackson") did
not report a very serious but false
accusation made by two supporters of
that bill.
Referring to the case of Robby
Perkins, who was a black student
arrested at the Old Union sit-in in
1985, one speaker stated as fact that
Perkins had been strip searched and
beaten by Stanford police.
Another speaker later added, as
"evidence" of this beating by Stanford
police, that Perkins had filed a
$600,000 suit against the University.
These are terribly important public
accusations. Racist harassment by law
enforcement officers is utterly in
tolerable; no less so are baseless asser

tions of it.
To set the record straight for those
present at that senate meeting and
reduce further dissemination of those
untrue statements, here are the real
facts:
1. On June 27, 1986, Perkins filed a
federal action against the University,
University President Donald Kennedy,
seven individually named members of
the Stanford Police Department, Santa
Clara County, and four individually
named members of the county's
Sheriffs Department, demanding
$600,000 in damages.
2. Perkins charged that when he
"refused to stand and walk with the
officers," the Stanford police used a
control hold in arresting him, rather
than less painful means that could
have been used.

He also charged that he had been
strip searched and beaten at North
County Jail after the Stanford police
had turned him (and other arrestees)
over to the Sheriffs Department and
later conceded that only one Stanford
police officer was even in that facility
at the time the incidents took place.
His complaint against that one officer
turned out to be that the officer
negligently failed to come to Perkins'
rescue.
3. In an order filed June 2, 1988, a
federal court found every claim against
each Stanford defendant to be com
pletely without merit.
In dismissing all Stanford defendants
from the case, the court said that
Perkins' evidence established only that
use of control holds "may be painful"
for a passively resisting arrestee, and

that Perkins himself was a
contributing factor to the pain he may
have experienced; and that "the
evidence demonstrates that no Stanford
Defendant ever touched Plaintiff at the
North Country Jail."
As to the non-Stanford defendants,
we are advised by the Santa Clara
County Counsel that some charges
against the county and the Sheriffs
Department were found to be com
pletely without merit and the
remainder were voluntarily dismissed
by Perkins with no payment to him of
any money.
Readers interested in obtaining
copies of the court's order, or other
documents filed in this case, may
