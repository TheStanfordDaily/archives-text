# Fro yo at the Co Po must not go if we want mo Pro Fros
## 
### 
Friends, an important aspect of the
Stanford experience has been silently
abolished, and nobody seems to have
noticed. How many of you remember
the thrill and confusion of learning
from your Pro Fro Ho about the
peculiar Stanford language?
How many of you bravely found
speeches at Mem Aud, climbed up Hoo
Tow, spent the night at Flo Mo and
then prayed in Mem Chu? These ab
breviations are one thing that make
Stanford ... Stanford.
And the epitome of the peculiar
Stanford vernacular is, without a
doubt, eating fro yo at the Co Po. It
has the same ring to it as being kissed

by a senior at midnight during Full
Moon in the Quad and is an equally
important right of passage.
It is painfully clear that no one from
Bon Appetit attended Stanford. You
see, this year they have stealthily
moved the revered fro yo machine over
to the Baker Street Cafe.
Tell me, what kind of tradition or
mystique can be associated with fro yo
at Ba Stre Ca? It just won't do, and
unless they bring it back this year, I
would be ashamed to even host a Pro
Fro. What would be the point?
We must protest. I am surprised
nothing has been said already. We
could boycott the Baker Street Cafe.
We could form coalitions and photocopy
thousands of forests worth of flyers.
And at the very least, could someone
please start a petition to move the
machine back?
