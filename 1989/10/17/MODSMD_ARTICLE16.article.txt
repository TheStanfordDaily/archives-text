# Rodin sculptures are irreplaceable and must be protected

### 
I would like to thank The Daily for
Thursday's editorial in support of the
effort to prevent the temporary
parking lot site next to the Rodin Gar
den from being reopened for the
parking of cars.
That garden with its Rodin bronzes
was put there for the education and
enjoyment of the Stanford community
for many years to come. I am replace
able, and so are all those from the
Chemistry Department who petitioned
to reopen the lot. The Rodin sculptures
are not.
A distinguished Stanford chemist has
since come to our aid and will help
refute the pseudo-scientific arguments
that reopening the lot to cars would

not add to pollution in the garden. He
too supports the establishment of a
grove of trees to serve as a buffer
against automobile pollution and as a
possible site for additional works of
art.
Let me also express thanks for the
fine article, "Sculpture at Stanford." It
is good to see The Daily alerting a new
generation of students to what Stan
ford offers them as part of their
humanistic education.
