## Made to feel uncomfortable 
### 
WE'VE BEEN BACK for almost a
month now. Classes are becom
ing routine and midterms are on
the horizon. We've made the rounds to
see our friends (even if they do live in
353).
Freshmen are getting used to campus:
420 is the psychology building; the Barn,
not the Red Barn, has a Hiiagen-Dazs;
and Braun Aud is not in Braun Music
Center. We've all adjusted to life here on
the Farm. Great, right?
Wrong. If we're comfortable, it just
means we've managed to stagnate in the
short period of three weeks. I have a
dream: Comfort may be the biggest ob
stacle facing a university striving for di
versity.
But wait, isn't every adviser's, advising
associate's, resident assistant's and resi
dent fellow's goal to make students as
comfortable as possible? Well, yes and no.
As an AA, I've heard several complaints
about Orientation '89 from within my
advising group, and I think it's wonderful.
I hear how out of place many of the
freshmen felt at the ethnic dinners, how
offended many were for being assumed
to be racist and how intimidated some
felt in stating their ideas, afraid their
thoughts might be construed as prejudice.
Good. Orientation '89 was a success.
Many people complained about last
year's "The Fire Within" because it made
white people feel like they didn't belong.
Amazing. How ethnocentric for a white
person to always want to belong. What's
wrong with turning the tables?
Not until every person in this Univer
sity can feel a bit uncomfortable, a bit

on edge, can we all understand diversity.
I'm not suggesting that one dinner with
Chicano/Latino Orientation Committee
or one Black Student Union meeting can
substitute for the generations of struggle
many minorities have faced, but it does
help a person gain perspective.
Three of us went this past Saturday
to a "Diaper Step Dance" â€” an initiation
rite for a black fraternity which I don't
know that much about. We realized we'd
probably be the only whites there. As it
turned out, we didn't stay, partially be
cause there was an admission fee and
partially because we felt like we were
intruding.
Funny thing was, walking back home
we realized how uncomfortable we had
been for the three brief minutes we
stayed. And our need to justify our quick
exit showed how difficult it ig to be the
minority.
No one there purposely tried to make
us feel uncomfortable, but after three
minutes we felt like outsiders. Imagine
how some students feel after three years
or perhaps three generations of inten
tional persecution.
Being Jewish, I've cringed seeing "The
Holocaust Never Happened" pamphlets
on my bike. Wouldn't it be great if we
never had to face such hypocrisy and
prejudice? But bigotry exists, and we need
to learn to deal with it before we can
prevent it.
Of course, not all uncomfortable situ
ations are culturally based. No matter
what your race or gender is, you'll end
up a minority in some respect. Take
sports for example. I never served a vol-

leyball over a net before I came to Stan
ford, and many people from my freshman
dorm could attest that I still haven't
served a volleyball over the net.
But at least I've tried. Diversity must
begin with the perpetual attempt to ex
perience new things.
Not every new situation has to be un
comfortable. Go to the Nikkei Tempura
Fry and help them break their previous
attendance record of 31. Try taking a
Feminist Studies class, even if you are
the only male.
Play intramural basketball and miss a
free throw that might have won it for
your team with no time left. Sure, you'll
feel awkward at first, but keep it up,
and sometimes it'll feel natural.
Welcome to Stanford, freshmen and
transfers. Welcome back, upperclassmen
and faculty. Hope you make your stay as
uncomfortable as possible, for a while at
least.
