# Yearly campaign promises never easy to fulfill
## COP finds it tough to deliver goods 
### David Hirning Editorial staff 
For as long as there's been an
ASSU, the student government
has offered Stanford students
the moon and beyond. However,
when it comes to following
through on these vows, many
campaign promises end up plum
meting back to earth.
The pledges that are trotted
out each spring start to develop
a familiar ring: "Meal cards at
Tresidder," "Better student serv
ices," "Lights on the tennis
courts." But for many years,
good intentions were not enough
to accomplish these goals.
"These issues have been
around for a lot of years," said
Stacey Leyton, a member of last
year's Council of Presidents.
"People have been trying to ac
complish things (in the ASSU)
forever."
Leyton noted that last year
such long-time pledges as Beat
the Bookstore and a student-run
airport shuttle were finally ac
complished. Yet there are still
areas where the ASSU has
promised reform but failed to
deliver.
Meal cards at Tresidder
The issue of University Food
Service flexibility, embodied in
the cry for using meal cards at
Tresidder Union, has for a num
ber of years been an ASSU
pledge. But most student repre
sentatives have run up against
an administrative brick wall in
attempting to fulfill that prom
ise.
The issue "needs a continuous,
long-term effort," according to
Kay Gaskin, administrative as
sistant for Food Service. Repre
sentatives "have to go through
the Bursar's office to get the
money (for the computer equip
ment). The bookkeeping could be
tremendous with the exchange
of money," she said.
"I would think the issue would
be too big for student govern
ment," Gaskin added.
However, both this year and
last, the COP has been fielded
by the People's Platform, a stu
dent political party established
in March 1985. Members of the

platform say they hope the party
will lend continuity to the COP's
work on student issues such as
meal service.
In addition, instead of leaving
the issue of food service to one
COP member, the ASSU last
year started a student Food Serv
ice task force. So far the task
force has achieved small vic
tories including allowances for
three guests per quarter on each
meal plan.
Paul Szczesiul, associate direc
tor of Tresidder, met with the
COP this summer to discuss the
meal card issue. But Food Serv
ice is generally financially op
posed to what students want, he
said.
The cost of Food Service is
"based on a percentage of missed
meals," he said. If meal cards
could be used at Tresidder, the
missed-meal percentage would
go to zero and meal plan costs

for students would "increase
substantially," he added.
Szczesiul said he thinks a
more feasible plan would allow
students to pay extra to use their
meal cards at Tresidder. A sur
vey last spring revealed that 32
percent of students questioned
were willing to pay more for that
type of option.
Of course, this is not what the
"Meal cards at Tresidder" pledge
has implied in the past.
Jim Keeton, director of Uni
versity Food Service, explained,
"We can't make meal cards in
terchangeable. It will have to be
an add-on . . . otherwise it will
cost everybody more."
Keeton said complications
with food service contractors at
Tresidder may have prevented
this add-on service from being
implemented earlier. The plan
was discussed three years ago
when the SAGA Corp. ran Tres

idder Food Services but was
dropped when the company was
replaced by the Marriott Corp.
This summer, the San
Francisco-based Bon Appetit
took over the contract from Mar
riott, and the situation is still
somewhat unsettled.
Keeton said COP involvement
on the issue of food service has
not always been high. "I think
the priority for this issue has
not been consistent from year to
year," he said.
This year "it has been dis
cussed, but not a lot of progress
has been made," he said "A key
problem is we haven't had all
parties involved sit down and
discuss it. I don't think it can
be done this year."
