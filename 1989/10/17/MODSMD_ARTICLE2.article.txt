# Yearly campaign promises never easy to fulfill
## COP finds it tough to deliver goods 
### David Hirning Editorial staff 
For as long as there's been an
ASSU, the student government
has offered Stanford students
the moon and beyond. However,
when it comes to following
through on these vows, many
campaign promises end up plum
meting back to earth.
The pledges that are trotted
out each spring start to develop
a familiar ring: "Meal cards at
Tresidder," "Better student serv
ices," "Lights on the tennis
courts." But for many years,
good intentions were not enough
to accomplish these goals.
"These issues have been
around for a lot of years," said
Stacey Leyton, a member of last
year's Council of Presidents.
"People have been trying to ac
complish things (in the ASSU)
forever."
Leyton noted that last year
such long-time pledges as Beat
the Bookstore and a student-run
airport shuttle were finally ac
complished. Yet there are still
areas where the ASSU has
promised reform but failed to
deliver.
Meal cards at Tresidder
The issue of University Food
Service flexibility, embodied in
the cry for using meal cards at
Tresidder Union, has for a num
ber of years been an ASSU
pledge. But most student repre
sentatives have run up against
an administrative brick wall in
attempting to fulfill that prom
ise.
The issue "needs a continuous,
long-term effort," according to
Kay Gaskin, administrative as
sistant for Food Service. Repre
sentatives "have to go through
the Bursar's office to get the
money (for the computer equip
ment). The bookkeeping could be
tremendous with the exchange
of money," she said.
"I would think the issue would
be too big for student govern
ment," Gaskin added.
However, both this year and
last, the COP has been fielded
by the People's Platform, a stu
dent political party established
in March 1985. Members of the

platform say they hope the party
will lend continuity to the COP's
work on student issues such as
meal service.
In addition, instead of leaving
the issue of food service to one
COP member, the ASSU last
year started a student Food Serv
ice task force. So far the task
force has achieved small vic
tories including allowances for
three guests per quarter on each
meal plan.
Paul Szczesiul, associate direc
tor of Tresidder, met with the
COP this summer to discuss the
meal card issue. But Food Serv
ice is generally financially op
posed to what students want, he
said.
The cost of Food Service is
"based on a percentage of missed
meals," he said. If meal cards
could be used at Tresidder, the
missed-meal percentage would
go to zero and meal plan costs

for students would "increase
substantially," he added.
Szczesiul said he thinks a
more feasible plan would allow
students to pay extra to use their
meal cards at Tresidder. A sur
vey last spring revealed that 32
percent of students questioned
were willing to pay more for that
type of option.
Of course, this is not what the
"Meal cards at Tresidder" pledge
has implied in the past.
Jim Keeton, director of Uni
versity Food Service, explained,
"We can't make meal cards in
terchangeable. It will have to be
an add-on . . . otherwise it will
cost everybody more."
Keeton said complications
with food service contractors at
Tresidder may have prevented
this add-on service from being
implemented earlier. The plan
was discussed three years ago
when the SAGA Corp. ran Tres

idder Food Services but was
dropped when the company was
replaced by the Marriott Corp.
This summer, the San
Francisco-based Bon Appetit
took over the contract from Mar
riott, and the situation is still
somewhat unsettled.
Keeton said COP involvement
on the issue of food service has
not always been high. "I think
the priority for this issue has
not been consistent from year to
year," he said.
This year "it has been dis
cussed, but not a lot of progress
has been made," he said "A key
problem is we haven't had all
parties involved sit down and
discuss it. I don't think it can
be done this year."

A similar issue to meal card

flexibility is that of the "univer
sal" student identification card.
For years, ASSU candidates have
been pledging to rid Stanford stu
dents of the flimsy paper identi
fication card and have the
University issue a card that could
be used for many more purposes.
The issue was taken up in ear
nest in 1986 when the Registrar's
Office convened a task force to
study it."The driving force be
hind the change was that the li
braries were planning to change
to an automated circulation sys
tem," said Marick Payton, data
administrator in the Registrar's
Office. "But it was not funded at
that time, and the proposal was
put on a back burner."
Payton noted that an ASSU
committee was established three
years ago to provide student input
in the process, but the committee
was disbanded when the proposal

was tabled. "There's been no or
ganized activity (by student gov
ernment) in the past two years,"
he said.
But even without student in
volvement, progress has been
made. The library is switching to
an automated circulation system
in 1991, and plans are in the
works to introduce a campuswide,
coded identification card next
year.
"We want to implement a
machine-readable card" before the
library switches over to the new
system," Payton said. "The fund
ing, though, remains up in the
air."
Interdisciplinary programs
Another promise that has
caught students' eyes and votes
in past years is, "More money to
underfunded interdisciplinary
programs." Last spring, The Slate
of the Times — this year's COP
— specifically pledged to devote
its energies to the Human Biology
program.
Because of their inter

departmental nature, interdis
ciplinary programs are often in
dire financial straits. Craig Heller,
chair of the Human Biology pro
gram, explained that without a
University department of their
own, interdisciplinary programs
must borrow teachers and fund
ing from other areas.
"Most interdisciplinary pro
grams are using funds from other
departments," said Heller. "There
aren't many [faculty] positions
that are billeted in. Some are half
time."
Yet half of all Stanford students
are in interdisciplinary programs,
Heller said. "With almost no fac
ulty placed, it requires some at
tention."
Last year the ASSU formed the
Committee on Democracy in Ed
ucation to deal with academic is
sues such as interdisciplinary
funding. But despite highly
publicized gains after the May
takeover of University President
Donald Kennedy's office, the
group has not accomplished much
in the area of interdiscplinary

funding.
In fact, the already-insufficient
funding allotted to Human Biol
ogy was decreased this year, ac
cording to Heller. "We recently got
our proposed budget,"he said. "I
don't have an understanding of
why it has decreased. We have to
go back and discuss it."
However, Heller said he does
not foresee any student govern
ment involvement in this process.
"I don't know of any role that
the COP has in the budgetary
process," he said. "They can make
student opinions known, but they
don't influence the business be
tween the deans and the interdis
ciplinary programs.
"I think it's more of a statement
of what they stand for. I wasn't
aware of any action plan they
had," he said.
Teaching assistants
While CODE and the ASSU
have not been able to effect change
in interdisciplinary programs,
they have made progress in fund
ing for teaching assistants — an
issue that affects interdisciplinary
and other academic programs.
After extensive student involve
ment, the School of Humanities
and Sciences last month an
nounced an 8 percent increase in
this year's budget for TAs.
David Brown, a COP member
both this year and last, worked
extensively on the TA funding
issue. He noted that the increase
was achieved largely through stu
dent effort. "Students got to
gether, by themselves in the
beginning," he said. "Graduate
students were out there petition
ing as well. The sections were too
large, and TAs were overworked."
"Our philosophy is fundamen
tally different from, say, other
people that ran for COP last
year," COP member Aimee Alli
son said. "We want to involve
more students."
Courts and pools
Unlike the large issue of TA
funding, some ASSU pledges re
quire only good timing or a single
dedicated individual. Such was the
case with two recent student gov
ernment successes — lighted ten
nis courts and extended hours at

deGuerre Pool.
After years of student com
plaints, the University finally pro
vided tennis court lights last year
on the new West Courts near
Governor's Corner. Andy Geiger,
Stanford athletic director,
credited the ASSU with prompt
ing him to solicit funding for the
lights.
"We try to be responsive to stu
dents' needs," said Geiger. "With
the opening of the new courts, it
gave us the opportunity to do it
more economically. We had to go
to the University to request the
funds, and the ASSU's concern
helped us get what they wanted."
Geiger said lengthening the
swimming pool hours was much
simpler, requiring only an inter
nal adjustment and minimal cost.
Brown, a few students and ASSU
senator Dana Klapper sat down
with Geiger and accomplished
their objective in one meeting.
Geiger said he previously just
"wasn't aware of the tremendous
need."
24-hour study hall
While the ASSU has a fine track
record at helping the Stanford
student at play, there have been
calls for the government to assist
those of a more studious nature.
Usually this comes by way of a
pledge for more library hours or
a 24-hour study hall.
The need for extra study hours
became more pressing this quar
ter when the LOTS II computer
cluster at Tresidder drastically
cut back its hours. Formerly open
24 hours a day, the cluster moved
upstairs in the union and
switched to a closing time of mid
night Monday through Saturday
and 2 a.m. Sunday.
Students who have lost their
"all-nighter" resource are con
cerned, as are ASSU
representatives. "We weren't un
der the impression that the hours
would be different," said Brown.
"We want to look into it, because
the cluster hours before were
really good."
Restoring a 24-hour LOTS may
be the only way for this year's
COP to make good on its promise
of a 24-hour study hall — a pledge
which was made before the hours

changed. According to Szczesiul,
Tresidder is unlikely to provide
such a service.
"There are no funds to do that
(maintain an all-night study
hall)," he said. "The University
has had to cut $200,000 from our
budget this year."
Szczesiul also said he does not
think there is enough demand for
an all-night study room. "On
campus students have clusters
and study facilities in the residen
ces, and there is not enough need
among off-campus students," he
said. "Our Dead and Finals Week
experience (when Tresidder re
mains open later) show that the
number of students will drop
drastically later in the evening,
and by the end there are not many
left at all."
Library hours were increased
last fall when Green Library ex
tended its hours to midnight,
matching those of Meyer Library
and ending the traditional "Nerd
March" of students leaving Green
to finish studying at Meyer.
However, this decision was
made more as a matter of course
than a response to student gov
ernment pressure. "I don't think
there was any student government
action," said Nancy Hoebelhen
rich, assistant to the director of
University Libraries. "Students
have wanted it for a number of
years, and through the normal
process of trying to improve the
services, eventually student
demand was heard."
The entire student body wields
tremendous power to prompt
change, and this power is not lost
on this year's COP. "We can't do
anything, just the four of us,"
Allison said. "We can meet with
administrators and get nothing
done like in years past, or we can
do the dormitory representatives
program and further institution
alize other groups."
These other groups, including
CODE, can be non-elective bodies
that will let students work on is
sues they feel are important.
"What we want to do is institu
tionalize the kind of organiza
tional bodies that will continue
even after the COP is out of of
fice," said COP member Ingrid
Nava.
For as long as there's been an
ASSU, the student government
has offered Stanford students
the moon and beyond. However,
when it comes to following
through on these vows, many
campaign promises end up plum
meting back to earth.

administrator in the Registrar's
Office. "But it was not funded at
that time, and the proposal was
put on a back burner."
Payton noted that an ASSU
committee was established three
years ago to provide student input
in the process, but the committee
was disbanded when the proposal

was tabled. "There's been no or
ganized activity (by student gov
ernment) in the past two years,"
he said.
But even without student in
volvement, progress has been
made. The library is switching to
an automated circulation system
in 1991, and plans are in the
works to introduce a campuswide,
coded identification card next
year.
"We want to implement a
machine-readable card" before the
library switches over to the new
system," Payton said. "The fund
ing, though, remains up in the
air."
Interdisciplinary programs
Another promise that has
caught students' eyes and votes
in past years is, "More money to
underfunded interdisciplinary
programs." Last spring, The Slate
of the Times — this year's COP
— specifically pledged to devote
its energies to the Human Biology
program.
Because of their inter

departmental nature, interdis
ciplinary programs are often in
dire financial straits. Craig Heller,
chair of the Human Biology pro
gram, explained that without a
University department of their
own, interdisciplinary programs
must borrow teachers and fund
ing from other areas.
"Most interdisciplinary pro
grams are using funds from other
departments," said Heller. "There
aren't many [faculty] positions
that are billeted in. Some are half
time."
Yet half of all Stanford students
are in interdisciplinary programs,
Heller said. "With almost no fac
ulty placed, it requires some at
tention."
Last year the ASSU formed the
Committee on Democracy in Ed
ucation to deal with academic is
sues such as interdisciplinary
funding. But despite highly
publicized gains after the May
takeover of University President
Donald Kennedy's office, the
group has not accomplished much
in the area of interdiscplinary

funding.
In fact, the already-insufficient
funding allotted to Human Biol
ogy was decreased this year, ac
cording to Heller. "We recently got
our proposed budget,"he said. "I
don't have an understanding of
why it has decreased. We have to
go back and discuss it."
However, Heller said he does
not foresee any student govern
ment involvement in this process.
"I don't know of any role that
the COP has in the budgetary
process," he said. "They can make
student opinions known, but they
don't influence the business be
tween the deans and the interdis
ciplinary programs.
"I think it's more of a statement
of what they stand for. I wasn't
aware of any action plan they
had," he said.
Teaching assistants
While CODE and the ASSU
have not been able to effect change
in interdisciplinary programs,
they have made progress in fund
ing for teaching assistants — an
issue that affects interdisciplinary
and other academic programs.
After extensive student involve
ment, the School of Humanities
and Sciences last month an
nounced an 8 percent increase in
this year's budget for TAs.
David Brown, a COP member
both this year and last, worked
extensively on the TA funding
issue. He noted that the increase
was achieved largely through stu
dent effort. "Students got to
gether, by themselves in the
beginning," he said. "Graduate
students were out there petition
ing as well. The sections were too
large, and TAs were overworked."
"Our philosophy is fundamen
tally different from, say, other
people that ran for COP last
year," COP member Aimee Alli
son said. "We want to involve
more students."
Courts and pools
Unlike the large issue of TA
funding, some ASSU pledges re
quire only good timing or a single
dedicated individual. Such was the
case with two recent student gov
ernment successes — lighted ten
nis courts and extended hours at

deGuerre Pool.
After years of student com
plaints, the University finally pro
vided tennis court lights last year
on the new West Courts near
Governor's Corner. Andy Geiger,
Stanford athletic director,
credited the ASSU with prompt
ing him to solicit funding for the
lights.
"We try to be responsive to stu
dents' needs," said Geiger. "With
the opening of the new courts, it
gave us the opportunity to do it
more economically. We had to go
to the University to request the
funds, and the ASSU's concern
helped us get what they wanted."
Geiger said lengthening the
swimming pool hours was much
simpler, requiring only an inter
nal adjustment and minimal cost.
Brown, a few students and ASSU
senator Dana Klapper sat down
with Geiger and accomplished
their objective in one meeting.
Geiger said he previously just
"wasn't aware of the tremendous
need."
24-hour study hall
While the ASSU has a fine track
record at helping the Stanford
student at play, there have been
calls for the government to assist
those of a more studious nature.
Usually this comes by way of a
pledge for more library hours or
a 24-hour study hall.
The need for extra study hours
became more pressing this quar
ter when the LOTS II computer
cluster at Tresidder drastically
cut back its hours. Formerly open
24 hours a day, the cluster moved
upstairs in the union and
switched to a closing time of mid
night Monday through Saturday
and 2 a.m. Sunday.
Students who have lost their
"all-nighter" resource are con
cerned, as are ASSU
representatives. "We weren't un
der the impression that the hours
would be different," said Brown.
"We want to look into it, because
the cluster hours before were
really good."
Restoring a 24-hour LOTS may
be the only way for this year's
COP to make good on its promise
of a 24-hour study hall — a pledge
which was made before the hours

changed. According to Szczesiul,
Tresidder is unlikely to provide
such a service.
"There are no funds to do that
(maintain an all-night study
hall)," he said. "The University
has had to cut $200,000 from our
budget this year."
Szczesiul also said he does not
think there is enough demand for
an all-night study room. "On
campus students have clusters
and study facilities in the residen
ces, and there is not enough need
among off-campus students," he
said. "Our Dead and Finals Week
experience (when Tresidder re
mains open later) show that the
number of students will drop
drastically later in the evening,
and by the end there are not many
left at all."
Library hours were increased
last fall when Green Library ex
tended its hours to midnight,
matching those of Meyer Library
and ending the traditional "Nerd
March" of students leaving Green
to finish studying at Meyer.
However, this decision was
made more as a matter of course
than a response to student gov
ernment pressure. "I don't think
there was any student government
action," said Nancy Hoebelhen
rich, assistant to the director of
University Libraries. "Students
have wanted it for a number of
years, and through the normal
process of trying to improve the
services, eventually student
demand was heard."
The entire student body wields
tremendous power to prompt
change, and this power is not lost
on this year's COP. "We can't do
anything, just the four of us,"
Allison said. "We can meet with
administrators and get nothing
done like in years past, or we can
do the dormitory representatives
program and further institution
alize other groups."
These other groups, including
CODE, can be non-elective bodies
that will let students work on is
sues they feel are important.
"What we want to do is institu
tionalize the kind of organiza
tional bodies that will continue
even after the COP is out of of
fice," said COP member Ingrid
Nava.
For as long as there's been an
ASSU, the student government
has offered Stanford students
the moon and beyond. However,
when it comes to following
through on these vows, many
campaign promises end up plum
meting back to earth.
The pledges that are trotted
out each spring start to develop
a familiar ring: "Meal cards at
Tresidder," "Better student serv
ices," "Lights on the tennis
courts." But for many years,
good intentions were not enough
to accomplish these goals.
"These issues have been
around for a lot of years," said
Stacey Leyton, a member of last
year's Council of Presidents.
"People have been trying to ac
complish things (in the ASSU)
forever."
Leyton noted that last year
such long-time pledges as Beat
the Bookstore and a student-run
airport shuttle were finally ac
complished. Yet there are still
areas where the ASSU has
promised reform but failed to
deliver.
Meal cards at Tresidder
The issue of University Food
Service flexibility, embodied in
the cry for using meal cards at
Tresidder Union, has for a num
ber of years been an ASSU
pledge. But most student repre
sentatives have run up against
an administrative brick wall in
attempting to fulfill that prom
ise.
The issue "needs a continuous,
long-term effort," according to
Kay Gaskin, administrative as
sistant for Food Service. Repre
sentatives "have to go through
the Bursar's office to get the
money (for the computer equip
ment). The bookkeeping could be
tremendous with the exchange
of money," she said.
"I would think the issue would
be too big for student govern
ment," Gaskin added.
However, both this year and
last, the COP has been fielded
by the People's Platform, a stu
dent political party established
in March 1985. Members of the

platform say they hope the party
will lend continuity to the COP's
work on student issues such as
meal service.
In addition, instead of leaving
the issue of food service to one
COP member, the ASSU last
year started a student Food Serv
ice task force. So far the task
force has achieved small vic
tories including allowances for
three guests per quarter on each
meal plan.
Paul Szczesiul, associate direc
tor of Tresidder, met with the
COP this summer to discuss the
meal card issue. But Food Serv
ice is generally financially op
posed to what students want, he
said.
The cost of Food Service is
"based on a percentage of missed
meals," he said. If meal cards
could be used at Tresidder, the
missed-meal percentage would
go to zero and meal plan costs

for students would "increase
substantially," he added.
Szczesiul said he thinks a
more feasible plan would allow
students to pay extra to use their
meal cards at Tresidder. A sur
vey last spring revealed that 32
percent of students questioned
were willing to pay more for that
type of option.
Of course, this is not what the
"Meal cards at Tresidder" pledge
has implied in the past.
Jim Keeton, director of Uni
versity Food Service, explained,
"We can't make meal cards in
terchangeable. It will have to be
an add-on . . . otherwise it will
cost everybody more."
Keeton said complications
with food service contractors at
Tresidder may have prevented
this add-on service from being
implemented earlier. The plan
was discussed three years ago
when the SAGA Corp. ran Tres

idder Food Services but was
dropped when the company was
replaced by the Marriott Corp.
This summer, the San
Francisco-based Bon Appetit
took over the contract from Mar
riott, and the situation is still
somewhat unsettled.
Keeton said COP involvement
on the issue of food service has
not always been high. "I think
the priority for this issue has
not been consistent from year to
year," he said.
This year "it has been dis
cussed, but not a lot of progress
has been made," he said "A key
problem is we haven't had all
parties involved sit down and
discuss it. I don't think it can
be done this year."
Universal ID
A similar issue to meal card

flexibility is that of the "univer
sal" student identification card.
For years, ASSU candidates have
been pledging to rid Stanford stu
dents of the flimsy paper identi
fication card and have the
University issue a card that could
be used for many more purposes.
The issue was taken up in ear
nest in 1986 when the Registrar's
Office convened a task force to
study it."The driving force be
hind the change was that the li
braries were planning to change
to an automated circulation sys
tem," said Marick Payton, data

student at play, there have been
calls for the government to assist
those of a more studious nature.
Usually this comes by way of a
pledge for more library hours or
a 24-hour study hall.
The need for extra study hours
became more pressing this quar
ter when the LOTS II computer
cluster at Tresidder drastically
cut back its hours. Formerly open
24 hours a day, the cluster moved
upstairs in the union and
switched to a closing time of mid
night Monday through Saturday
and 2 a.m. Sunday.
Students who have lost their
"all-nighter" resource are con
cerned, as are ASSU
representatives. "We weren't un
der the impression that the hours
would be different," said Brown.
"We want to look into it, because
the cluster hours before were
really good."
Restoring a 24-hour LOTS may
be the only way for this year's
COP to make good on its promise
of a 24-hour study hall — a pledge
which was made before the hours

changed. According to Szczesiul,
Tresidder is unlikely to provide
such a service.
"There are no funds to do that
(maintain an all-night study
hall)," he said. "The University
has had to cut $200,000 from our
budget this year."
Szczesiul also said he does not
think there is enough demand for
an all-night study room. "On
campus students have clusters
and study facilities in the residen
ces, and there is not enough need
among off-campus students," he
said. "Our Dead and Finals Week
experience (when Tresidder re
mains open later) show that the
number of students will drop
drastically later in the evening,
and by the end there are not many
left at all."
Library hours were increased
last fall when Green Library ex
tended its hours to midnight,
matching those of Meyer Library
and ending the traditional "Nerd
March" of students leaving Green
to finish studying at Meyer.
However, this decision was
made more as a matter of course
than a response to student gov
ernment pressure. "I don't think
there was any student government
action," said Nancy Hoebelhen
rich, assistant to the director of
University Libraries. "Students
have wanted it for a number of
years, and through the normal
process of trying to improve the
services, eventually student
demand was heard."
The entire student body wields
tremendous power to prompt
change, and this power is not lost
on this year's COP. "We can't do
anything, just the four of us,"
Allison said. "We can meet with
administrators and get nothing
done like in years past, or we can
do the dormitory representatives
program and further institution
alize other groups."
These other groups, including
CODE, can be non-elective bodies
that will let students work on is
sues they feel are important.
"What we want to do is institu
tionalize the kind of organiza
tional bodies that will continue
even after the COP is out of of
fice," said COP member Ingrid
Nava.
For as long as there's been an
ASSU, the student government
has offered Stanford students
the moon and beyond. However,
when it comes to following
through on these vows, many
campaign promises end up plum
meting back to earth.
The pledges that are trotted
out each spring start to develop
a familiar ring: "Meal cards at
Tresidder," "Better student serv
ices," "Lights on the tennis
courts." But for many years,
good intentions were not enough
to accomplish these goals.
"These issues have been
around for a lot of years," said
Stacey Leyton, a member of last
year's Council of Presidents.
"People have been trying to ac
complish things (in the ASSU)
forever."
Leyton noted that last year
such long-time pledges as Beat
the Bookstore and a student-run
airport shuttle were finally ac
complished. Yet there are still
areas where the ASSU has
promised reform but failed to
deliver.
Meal cards at Tresidder
The issue of University Food
Service flexibility, embodied in
the cry for using meal cards at
Tresidder Union, has for a num
ber of years been an ASSU
pledge. But most student repre
sentatives have run up against
an administrative brick wall in
attempting to fulfill that prom
ise.
The issue "needs a continuous,
long-term effort," according to
Kay Gaskin, administrative as
sistant for Food Service. Repre
sentatives "have to go through
the Bursar's office to get the
money (for the computer equip
ment). The bookkeeping could be
tremendous with the exchange
of money," she said.
"I would think the issue would
be too big for student govern
ment," Gaskin added.
However, both this year and
last, the COP has been fielded
by the People's Platform, a stu
dent political party established
in March 1985. Members of the

platform say they hope the party
will lend continuity to the COP's
work on student issues such as
meal service.
In addition, instead of leaving
the issue of food service to one
COP member, the ASSU last
year started a student Food Serv
ice task force. So far the task
force has achieved small vic
tories including allowances for
three guests per quarter on each
meal plan.
Paul Szczesiul, associate direc
tor of Tresidder, met with the
COP this summer to discuss the
meal card issue. But Food Serv
ice is generally financially op
posed to what students want, he
said.
The cost of Food Service is
"based on a percentage of missed
meals," he said. If meal cards
could be used at Tresidder, the
missed-meal percentage would
go to zero and meal plan costs

for students would "increase
substantially," he added.
Szczesiul said he thinks a
more feasible plan would allow
students to pay extra to use their
meal cards at Tresidder. A sur
vey last spring revealed that 32
percent of students questioned
were willing to pay more for that
type of option.
Of course, this is not what the
"Meal cards at Tresidder" pledge
has implied in the past.
Jim Keeton, director of Uni
versity Food Service, explained,
"We can't make meal cards in
terchangeable. It will have to be
an add-on . . . otherwise it will
cost everybody more."
Keeton said complications
with food service contractors at
Tresidder may have prevented
this add-on service from being
implemented earlier. The plan
was discussed three years ago
when the SAGA Corp. ran Tres

idder Food Services but was
dropped when the company was
replaced by the Marriott Corp.
This summer, the San
Francisco-based Bon Appetit
took over the contract from Mar
riott, and the situation is still
somewhat unsettled.
Keeton said COP involvement
on the issue of food service has
not always been high. "I think
the priority for this issue has
not been consistent from year to
year," he said.
This year "it has been dis
cussed, but not a lot of progress
has been made," he said "A key
problem is we haven't had all
parties involved sit down and
discuss it. I don't think it can
be done this year."
Universal ID
A similar issue to meal card

flexibility is that of the "univer
sal" student identification card.
For years, ASSU candidates have
been pledging to rid Stanford stu
dents of the flimsy paper identi
fication card and have the
University issue a card that could
be used for many more purposes.
The issue was taken up in ear
nest in 1986 when the Registrar's
Office convened a task force to
study it."The driving force be
hind the change was that the li
braries were planning to change
to an automated circulation sys
tem," said Marick Payton, data
administrator in the Registrar's
Office. "But it was not funded at
that time, and the proposal was
put on a back burner."
Payton noted that an ASSU
committee was established three
years ago to provide student input
in the process, but the committee
was disbanded when the proposal

was tabled. "There's been no or
ganized activity (by student gov
ernment) in the past two years,"
he said.
But even without student in
volvement, progress has been
made. The library is switching to
an automated circulation system
in 1991, and plans are in the
works to introduce a campuswide,
coded identification card next
year.
"We want to implement a
machine-readable card" before the
library switches over to the new
system," Payton said. "The fund
ing, though, remains up in the
air."
Interdisciplinary programs
Another promise that has
caught students' eyes and votes
in past years is, "More money to
underfunded interdisciplinary
programs." Last spring, The Slate
of the Times — this year's COP
— specifically pledged to devote
its energies to the Human Biology
program.
Because of their inter

departmental nature, interdis
ciplinary programs are often in
dire financial straits. Craig Heller,
chair of the Human Biology pro
gram, explained that without a
University department of their
own, interdisciplinary programs
must borrow teachers and fund
ing from other areas.
"Most interdisciplinary pro
grams are using funds from other
departments," said Heller. "There
aren't many [faculty] positions
that are billeted in. Some are half
time."
Yet half of all Stanford students
are in interdisciplinary programs,
Heller said. "With almost no fac
ulty placed, it requires some at
tention."
Last year the ASSU formed the
Committee on Democracy in Ed
ucation to deal with academic is
sues such as interdisciplinary
funding. But despite highly
publicized gains after the May
takeover of University President
Donald Kennedy's office, the
group has not accomplished much
in the area of interdiscplinary

funding.
In fact, the already-insufficient
funding allotted to Human Biol
ogy was decreased this year, ac
cording to Heller. "We recently got
our proposed budget,"he said. "I
don't have an understanding of
why it has decreased. We have to
go back and discuss it."
However, Heller said he does
not foresee any student govern
ment involvement in this process.
"I don't know of any role that
the COP has in the budgetary
process," he said. "They can make
student opinions known, but they
don't influence the business be
tween the deans and the interdis
ciplinary programs.
"I think it's more of a statement
of what they stand for. I wasn't
aware of any action plan they
had," he said.
Teaching assistants
While CODE and the ASSU
have not been able to effect change
in interdisciplinary programs,
they have made progress in fund
ing for teaching assistants — an
issue that affects interdisciplinary
and other academic programs.
After extensive student involve
ment, the School of Humanities
and Sciences last month an
nounced an 8 percent increase in
this year's budget for TAs.
David Brown, a COP member
both this year and last, worked
extensively on the TA funding
issue. He noted that the increase
was achieved largely through stu
dent effort. "Students got to
gether, by themselves in the
beginning," he said. "Graduate
students were out there petition
ing as well. The sections were too
large, and TAs were overworked."
"Our philosophy is fundamen
tally different from, say, other
people that ran for COP last
year," COP member Aimee Alli
son said. "We want to involve
more students."
Courts and pools
Unlike the large issue of TA
funding, some ASSU pledges re
quire only good timing or a single
dedicated individual. Such was the
case with two recent student gov
ernment successes — lighted ten
nis courts and extended hours at

deGuerre Pool.
After years of student com
plaints, the University finally pro
vided tennis court lights last year
on the new West Courts near
Governor's Corner. Andy Geiger,
Stanford athletic director,
credited the ASSU with prompt
ing him to solicit funding for the
lights.
"We try to be responsive to stu
dents' needs," said Geiger. "With
the opening of the new courts, it
gave us the opportunity to do it
more economically. We had to go
to the University to request the
funds, and the ASSU's concern
helped us get what they wanted."
Geiger said lengthening the
swimming pool hours was much
simpler, requiring only an inter
nal adjustment and minimal cost.
Brown, a few students and ASSU
senator Dana Klapper sat down
with Geiger and accomplished
their objective in one meeting.
Geiger said he previously just
"wasn't aware of the tremendous
need."
24-hour study hall
While the ASSU has a fine track
record at helping the Stanford
student at play, there have been
calls for the government to assist
those of a more studious nature.
Usually this comes by way of a
pledge for more library hours or
a 24-hour study hall.
The need for extra study hours
became more pressing this quar

representatives. "We weren't un

"We want to look into it, because

Restoring a 24-hour LOTS may
be the only way for this year's
COP to make good on its promise
of a 24-hour study hall — a pledge
which was made before the hours

changed. According to Szczesiul,
Tresidder is unlikely to provide
such a service.
"There are no funds to do that
(maintain an all-night study

work on student issues such as
meal service.
In addition, instead of leaving
the issue of food service to one
COP member, the ASSU last
year started a student Food Serv
ice task force. So far the task
force has achieved small vic
tories including allowances for
three guests per quarter on each
meal plan.
Paul Szczesiul, associate direc
tor of Tresidder, met with the
COP this summer to discuss the
meal card issue. But Food Serv
ice is generally financially op
posed to what students want, he
said.
The cost of Food Service is
"based on a percentage of missed
meals," he said. If meal cards
could be used at Tresidder, the
missed-meal percentage would
go to zero and meal plan costs

for students would "increase
substantially," he added.
Szczesiul said he thinks a
more feasible plan would allow
students to pay extra to use their
meal cards at Tresidder. A sur
vey last spring revealed that 32
percent of students questioned
were willing to pay more for that
type of option.
Of course, this is not what the
"Meal cards at Tresidder" pledge
has implied in the past.
Jim Keeton, director of Uni
versity Food Service, explained,
"We can't make meal cards in
terchangeable. It will have to be
an add-on . . . otherwise it will
cost everybody more."
Keeton said complications
with food service contractors at
Tresidder may have prevented
this add-on service from being
implemented earlier. The plan
was discussed three years ago
when the SAGA Corp. ran Tres

idder Food Services but was
dropped when the company was
replaced by the Marriott Corp.
This summer, the San
Francisco-based Bon Appetit
took over the contract from Mar
riott, and the situation is still
somewhat unsettled.
Keeton said COP involvement
on the issue of food service has
not always been high. "I think
the priority for this issue has
not been consistent from year to
year," he said.
This year "it has been dis
cussed, but not a lot of progress
has been made," he said "A key
problem is we haven't had all
parties involved sit down and
discuss it. I don't think it can
be done this year."
Universal ID
A similar issue to meal card

flexibility is that of the "univer
sal" student identification card.
For years, ASSU candidates have
been pledging to rid Stanford stu
dents of the flimsy paper identi
fication card and have the
University issue a card that could
be used for many more purposes.
The issue was taken up in ear
nest in 1986 when the Registrar's
Office convened a task force to
study it."The driving force be
hind the change was that the li
braries were planning to change
to an automated circulation sys
tem," said Marick Payton, data
administrator in the Registrar's
Office. "But it was not funded at
that time, and the proposal was
put on a back burner."
Payton noted that an ASSU
committee was established three
years ago to provide student input
in the process, but the committee
was disbanded when the proposal

was tabled. "There's been no or
ganized activity (by student gov
ernment) in the past two years,"
he said.
But even without student in
volvement, progress has been
made. The library is switching to
an automated circulation system
in 1991, and plans are in the
works to introduce a campuswide,
coded identification card next
year.
"We want to implement a
machine-readable card" before the
library switches over to the new
system," Payton said. "The fund
ing, though, remains up in the
air."
Interdisciplinary programs
Another promise that has
caught students' eyes and votes
in past years is, "More money to
underfunded interdisciplinary
programs." Last spring, The Slate
of the Times — this year's COP
— specifically pledged to devote
its energies to the Human Biology
program.
Because of their inter

departmental nature, interdis
ciplinary programs are often in
dire financial straits. Craig Heller,
chair of the Human Biology pro
gram, explained that without a
University department of their
own, interdisciplinary programs
must borrow teachers and fund
ing from other areas.
"Most interdisciplinary pro
grams are using funds from other
departments," said Heller. "There
aren't many [faculty] positions
that are billeted in. Some are half
time."
Yet half of all Stanford students
are in interdisciplinary programs,
Heller said. "With almost no fac
ulty placed, it requires some at
tention."
Last year the ASSU formed the
Committee on Democracy in Ed
ucation to deal with academic is
sues such as interdisciplinary
funding. But despite highly
publicized gains after the May
takeover of University President
Donald Kennedy's office, the
group has not accomplished much
in the area of interdiscplinary

funding.
In fact, the already-insufficient
funding allotted to Human Biol
ogy was decreased this year, ac
cording to Heller. "We recently got
our proposed budget,"he said. "I
don't have an understanding of
why it has decreased. We have to
go back and discuss it."
However, Heller said he does
not foresee any student govern
ment involvement in this process.
"I don't know of any role that
the COP has in the budgetary
process," he said. "They can make
student opinions known, but they
don't influence the business be
tween the deans and the interdis
ciplinary programs.
"I think it's more of a statement
of what they stand for. I wasn't
aware of any action plan they
had," he said.
Teaching assistants
While CODE and the ASSU
have not been able to effect change
in interdisciplinary programs,
they have made progress in fund
ing for teaching assistants — an
issue that affects interdisciplinary
and other academic programs.
After extensive student involve
ment, the School of Humanities
and Sciences last month an
nounced an 8 percent increase in
this year's budget for TAs.
David Brown, a COP member
both this year and last, worked
extensively on the TA funding
issue. He noted that the increase
was achieved largely through stu
dent effort. "Students got to
gether, by themselves in the
beginning," he said. "Graduate
students were out there petition
ing as well. The sections were too
large, and TAs were overworked."
"Our philosophy is fundamen
tally different from, say, other
people that ran for COP last
year," COP member Aimee Alli
son said. "We want to involve
more students."
Courts and pools
Unlike the large issue of TA
funding, some ASSU pledges re
quire only good timing or a single
dedicated individual. Such was the
case with two recent student gov
ernment successes — lighted ten
nis courts and extended hours at

deGuerre Pool.
After years of student com
plaints, the University finally pro
vided tennis court lights last year
on the new West Courts near
Governor's Corner. Andy Geiger,
Stanford athletic director,
credited the ASSU with prompt
ing him to solicit funding for the
lights.
"We try to be responsive to stu
dents' needs," said Geiger. "With
the opening of the new courts, it
gave us the opportunity to do it
more economically. We had to go
to the University to request the
funds, and the ASSU's concern
helped us get what they wanted."
Geiger said lengthening the
swimming pool hours was much
simpler, requiring only an inter
nal adjustment and minimal cost.
Brown, a few students and ASSU
senator Dana Klapper sat down
with Geiger and accomplished
their objective in one meeting.
Geiger said he previously just
"wasn't aware of the tremendous
need."
24-hour study hall
While the ASSU has a fine track
record at helping the Stanford
student at play, there have been
calls for the government to assist
those of a more studious nature.
Usually this comes by way of a
pledge for more library hours or
a 24-hour study hall.
The need for extra study hours
became more pressing this quar
ter when the LOTS II computer
cluster at Tresidder drastically
cut back its hours. Formerly open
24 hours a day, the cluster moved
upstairs in the union and
switched to a closing time of mid
night Monday through Saturday
and 2 a.m. Sunday.
Students who have lost their
"all-nighter" resource are con
cerned, as are ASSU
representatives. "We weren't un
der the impression that the hours
would be different," said Brown.
"We want to look into it, because
the cluster hours before were
really good."
Restoring a 24-hour LOTS may
be the only way for this year's
COP to make good on its promise
of a 24-hour study hall — a pledge
which was made before the hours

changed. According to Szczesiul,
Tresidder is unlikely to provide
such a service.
"There are no funds to do that
(maintain an all-night study
hall)," he said. "The University
has had to cut $200,000 from our
budget this year."
Szczesiul also said he does not
think there is enough demand for
an all-night study room. "On
campus students have clusters
and study facilities in the residen
ces, and there is not enough need
among off-campus students," he
said. "Our Dead and Finals Week
experience (when Tresidder re
mains open later) show that the
number of students will drop
drastically later in the evening,
and by the end there are not many
left at all."
Library hours were increased
last fall when Green Library ex
tended its hours to midnight,
matching those of Meyer Library
and ending the traditional "Nerd
March" of students leaving Green
to finish studying at Meyer.
However, this decision was
made more as a matter of course
than a response to student gov
ernment pressure. "I don't think
there was any student government
action," said Nancy Hoebelhen
rich, assistant to the director of
University Libraries. "Students
have wanted it for a number of
years, and through the normal
process of trying to improve the
services, eventually student
demand was heard."
The entire student body wields
tremendous power to prompt
change, and this power is not lost
on this year's COP. "We can't do
anything, just the four of us,"
Allison said. "We can meet with
administrators and get nothing
done like in years past, or we can
do the dormitory representatives
program and further institution
alize other groups."
These other groups, including
CODE, can be non-elective bodies
that will let students work on is
sues they feel are important.
"What we want to do is institu
tionalize the kind of organiza
tional bodies that will continue
even after the COP is out of of
fice," said COP member Ingrid
Nava.
