Final bids for the construc
tion of Florence Moore Hall
were approved and construc
tion of the new undergraduate
women's dormitory began im
mediately.
University President Wallace
Sterling said the residence
would "embody the most ad
vanced thinking in design of
living facilities."

Other University officials
said that Flo Mo would incor
porate the benefits of small
group living that existed on the
Row and would allow for the
increase of female student en
rollment at Stanford.

Twenty masked students ac
costed David Harris, Stanford's
liberal student body president,
and forcibly cut his hair with
electric clippers.
The attack took place on the

Row at about 9:15 p.m., after
Harris left a student govern
ment meeting and was heading
to a party. While the mob
succeeded in transforming
Harris' long-hair into a buzz,
Harris persuaded them not to
cut off his beard.
The students, members of a
campus fraternity, said the at
tack was partially motivated by
Harris' well-publicized opposi
tion to fraternities and athletic
scholarships.

The Stanford Daily
In a day filled with fratern
ity-related controversy, mem
bers of Phi Delta Theta frater
nity highjacked approximately
11,000 copies of The Daily from
campus distribution points.
In a noon interview, Phi Delt
house president Dave Oswald
told The Daily that fraternity
members needed the newspa
pers "to make papier-mache for
Homecoming decorations."
Later in the afternoon, an
unidentified Phi Delt said the
newspapers were taken as part
of an experiment by fraternity
members majoring in psychol
ogy. However, psychology de
partment officials denied
knowledge of such a project.
