## Students march in D.C. for homeless 
### Alison Derbenwick 
When you think of the home
less, what do you see?
Drunken bums? Bag ladies?
Bridge people? The Random
House College Dictionary defines
homeless as simply "without a
home," but sophomores Ingrid
Happoldt and Verna Kuo know
that being homeless means living
in a different world.
These two women spent Oct. 30
and Sept. 1 in Washington, D.C.
at a march and rally for affordable
and low income housing. Kuo
called it "an outcry for awareness
in the nation." They stayed at
The Community for Creative
Non-Violence, a shelter that
serves about 1,400 homeless
people in Washington, D.C., ac
cording to Happoldt.
Kuo and Happoldt spent three
weeks working at the same shelter
this summer. For both, returning
to Washington for the march was
like "following through" on their
summer experiences.
Happoldt said her interest in
helping the homeless was sparked
three years ago when she first
heard about Mitch Snyder, a
leading homeless advocate. "I was
in high school and here was this
issue . . . and it seemed kind of
ridiculous that I wasn't aware of
it before." Kuo attributed her in
terest mainly to Happoldt's enthu
siasm.
Both women said that living at
the homeless shelter this summer
changed them. Happoldt said that
before the summer, her exposure
to homelessness "had been the
bums and the vagrants downtown
who sell their blood." She added
that she no longer sees a homeless
person as "somebody that's un

able to be a productive member
of society, because that's not nec
essarily the case. A lot of times
it's someone who is working on a
daily basis. Living [at the shelter]
made me understand the people
themselves — not necessarily
what they go through — but why
they're there."
Kuo agrees. "I had a lot of
mixed feelings ... this summer.
It was a very difficult and trying
period because it was ... a com
pletely different world. You see a
lot of the raw aspects of life," she
said.
Planning for the march and
rally began last January in At
lanta, when the group Housing
Now! was formed. Nationwide
work continued throughout the
summer. Happoldt estimated that
there were 250,000 people at the
rally, but said, "I felt like being
there as a single person really
made a huge difference."
Kuo smiled as she noted, "It
sounds corny to say that we made
history this past weekend. But I
really feel that we did."
The crowd was made up of
"everyone," including college stu
dents, religious groups, minority
groups, the AFL-CIO, United
Auto Workers, and "homeless
people from everywhere," the two
said.
Both women laughed a bit when
asked about the celebrities at the
march. Kuo and Happoldt agreed
that Tracy Chapman's perform
ance of "Revolution" was
"incredible," but the whole
celebrity lineup did not touch all
the marchers in the same way.
Marchers began shouting, "TV
later, housing now!" and "Home
less people don't have TVs!"
Despite the disapproval shown

'Until you experi
ence it, it's very
hard to understand
(what being home
less is like).'

toward some celebrities, "The
overwhelming enthusiasm and
positive energy there was
amazing," Kuo said. Happoldt
said that the commitment of the
people in the crowd was clear.
"They just wanted to talk about
affordable housing and what we
were going to do to get it. They
wanted to see something done.
They wanted to see action," she
added.
Although statistical data on the
homeless population are almost
impossible to find, Happoldt said
that in the past eight years the
federal government has cut fund
ing for homeless projects by 75
percent. Kuo added that the cuts
affect everyone, and that "the
government can't keep doing this
to the nation."
She feels that "realizing that
there is a problem ... is the first
step" toward correcting homeless
ness. "We need a society where
people can work and can support
themselves," said Happoldt.
At the rally, a letter from Sec
retary of Housing and Urban De
velopment Jack Kemp was read,
which reaffirmed the administra
tion's commitment to affordable
housing. "I just hope that his

promise is something he's actually
going to commit to, because there
are a lot of people that are count
ing on him to keep that promise.
Homeless people . . . don't like
being homeless," Happoldt said.
Kuo suggested that a solution
involves individuals as well as the
government. "I don't think one
can justify, 'I'm only one person.
What I do doesn't matter.' Every
body has the ability and the power
and the resources to do some
thing." She suggested working in
a soup kitchen and donating cloth
ing, and said she "urges everyone
to work at a homeless shelter,
because until you experience it,
it's very hard to understand (what
being homeless is like)."
Happoldt's attitude was slightly
different. "I can't talk to other
people and say, 'You should do
this.' I just have to start with
myself."
She said: "I look at homeless
ness as starting with the children.
You reach out to a child, and you
have an influence, make him be
lieve in himself. And maybe then
that person who would have been
homeless won't be. And if you
keep working with the children
— then that's the future."
Looking back at the march, Kuo
and Happoldt agreed that it was
a valuable, moving experience
that only reinforced their summer
experiences. Happoldt summed it
up for both of them: "That march
had certain meanings for me, but
it had so much more meaning for
those people who are homeless, to
be able to look around and see all
those people that support them
and care about them — that was
the message. It was like, 'We care.
Everyone here cares."'
