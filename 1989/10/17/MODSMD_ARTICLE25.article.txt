## Volleyball to smash with Bears Stanford will try to make it three in a row tonight in Old Pavilion 
### David Earnest Senior staff writer 
The losing streak is over. Let the
drive for the conference title begin.
After taking last weekend's matches
from Arizona and Arizona State, the
Stanford women's volleyball team has
amassed a 6-3 record in the first half
of the Pacific 10 Conference schedule,
in spite of losing three straight, and
will open the second half tonight against
California at Old Pavilion.

'It's always a tough
[match] with California,
just because of the
rivalry.'
— Don Shaw

"With the position we've put our
selves in, with three losses, we've got
to go out and take care of every con
ference match for sure," Coach Don
Shaw said. "It's always a tough [match]
with California, just because of the
rivalry."
California comes into the match even
more in need of a conference win than
Stanford, with a 4-5 Pac-10 mark and
tied for sixth. Overall, the Golden Bears
are 12-7 and ranked 11th by the AVCA-
Tachikara Coaches Poll, but are strug
gling without their star outside hitter
Tiffany Rochelle, who broke a finger
against UCLA on Oct. 6.
The last time Stanford and California
met, on Sept. 27, the Cardinal won the
match 15-3, 15-12, 14-16, 15-5. Stanford
has now won 13 straight from the Bears
and leads the series 24-3.
That match was also the first started
by freshman setter Carrie Feldman, who
took over for injured senior Lara Asper.
Feldman has since started every match

for the Cardinal and is coming off tre
mendous performances in each of last
weekend's matches.

"That was my first match, and hope
fully, I've improved since then,"
Feldman said. "The last time against
Cal we let up in the third game, the
game we lost. It was a tough match."
Tonight's match, however, may be a
struggle for the Bears. Not only is Cal
ifornia without Rochelle but the Golden
Bears are also missing outside hitter
Jackie Cook, who has a sprained ankle.
Cook was among the team leaders in
kills and digs before being injured.
Trying to pick up the slack will be junior
hitter Lisa Arce, the team leader in
kills, aces and digs, and junior setter
Holly McPeak.
Stanford, on the other hand, has no
new injuries and will start the same six
who dominated No. 9 Arizona on Friday
night. Shaw started senior Jessica Ben
ton and freshman Kristi Paaso against
the Wildcats and plans to use the same
lineup tonight. Feldman, Paaso and
Benton will be joined by freshman Bev
Oden, senior Laura Olesen and sopho
more Kristin Klein.
The only injured Cardinal is Asper,
who has played in only six matches and
may redshirt the season.
In snapping a three-game losing
streak on Friday night, Stanford dis
played £n improved defense that held
Arizona hitter Terry Lauchner, an All-
Pac-10 selection last year, to a -.041
hitting percentage. Oden and Benton
each tallied six blocks as the Cardinal
racked up 14 total blocks. Stanford also
had 42 total digs, led by Feldman's 10.
"You could just watch and see how
much better (our defense) was," Oden
said about Friday's match.
"We were playing really good de
fense," Feldman said of the victory.
"Cheryl (Conly) came in and had some
great bumps, and it's nice to see that."

"Our concern is continuing to play
well," Shaw said. "We just need to go
out and feel like we're going to win
every match we play and that we're
going to play well every match. That's
what we're striving for right now."
Even though the Golden Bears are
injured and Stanford is playing well,
tonight's match will not necessarily be
a walk-over for the Cardinal.
"They need a win probably worse than
we do. You never know how many teams
the NCAA is going to let into the
(championship) tournament from our
conference," Shaw said. "They're in a
position where they need to beat some
teams ahead of them in the schedule
and in the standings, and we're one of
them. So we've got to be ready to play."
"They're really fired up about [their
losing streak to Stanford]," Feldman
said. "They're going to be out for
revenge. I think it will be a lot tougher
than last time."
No matter how tough the match may
be, the winning team will have con
siderably improved its standing in the
race for the Final Four, to be held in
Honolulu this December. The losing
team, on the other hand, may only be
able to look forward to Christmas.
