# Bay Area baseball fans should get their loyalties straight
## 
### 
Gee, is some big sporting event going
on around here?
For those of you who have been
hibernating the past three weeks or so,
the Bay Area is currently hosting the
World Series. First on the right side of
the Bay, now on the left side. As a baseball
fan and a lifelong Bay Area resident, I
have only one thing to say.
Boy, this stinks.
OK, I have been a fan of one of the
teams for basically all my sports-loving
life (i.e., ever since I learned that wasting
an entire Sunday watching football is a
lot more fun than mowing the lawn),
and I'm very happy to see them in the
Series.
But the Bay Area's reaction to this
svent has got to go.
The most ludicrous thing in the world

has to be those A's/Giants caps that are
split down the middle, black and orange
on one side and kelly green and gold on
the other. (Don't you love how plain old
green isn't good enough; it has to be kelly
green.)
Can you imagine a White Sox fan think
ing, "Gee, I might as well cheer for the
Cubbies because the White Sox were elim

inated from the race in June"?
How 'bout a Mets fan rooting for the
Yankees in the World Series? (This is
purely hypothetical, of course, consider
ing George Steinbrenner is still making
so-called decisions for the Bronx Bo«nb<U
No cl^p_ce«
Only in the Bay Area could you see
that. It appears that people here
just aren't willing to put their en
ergy into a specific team. It's like, "Oh,
the A's won? Killer, dude."
Or, "The Giants won? Totally
awesome."
What is wrong with people here? I'm
as laid-back as any other Californian one
could point out, but I just can't see paying
a scalper $500 for a World Series ticket
just to go root for a good game and not
care who wins.

Is it just a case of the entire Bay Area
being front-runners? Is no one willing to
take a stand and admit to liking only
one of the teams, or is everyone afraid
of the possibility that they might have
t<* auffer through having team lose.
Even Charlie Brown, the most wishy
washy guy in history, consistently cheered
for his favorite player, Joe Shlabotnik.
Alas, nobody around here has the
guts to take a stand, it seems. And
the weird thing is, no one thinks
it strange that the entire Bay Area thinks
highly of itself for being a flock of sheep.
Whatever.
In a somewhat unrelated issue, why
the heck is the local media so crazy over
this? Every paper has a separate World
Series extra section every day, and the
sections usually run eight to 12 pages.

I, for one, have little desire to read I
the story about how Pat Sheridan bought I
his dog a biscuit when he went to the
mall with Jose Canseco yesterday. But
we can read about this and other little-3
4cnown facts in any of the area's major i
newspapers each day.
Who reads these stories? Who writes)
these stories?
Argh.
Since I'm now getting to the end, I
guess I should do the part where I.;
predict who wins. I*
But I don't feel like it. It would be;
cheating to make a prediction with
games already having been played. Fur-S
thermore, as readers of the Greek of the!
Week know, I'm not that good at predic-I
tions anyway. )
At least I'm only rooting for one team.S
