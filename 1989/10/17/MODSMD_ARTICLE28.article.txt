# Stanford sails well in regattas
## Sargent qualifies for nationals, women take third over weekend 
### Sarah Gannett 
The Stanford sailing team
departed for Southern California
Friday with question marks but
returned Sunday with exclama
tion points.
The men's performance at USC
was highlighted when senior A 1
Sargent qualified for the
Singlehanded Nationals at the
U.S. Naval Academy Nov. 10-12.
Sargent won his berth at the
Nationals by consistently placing
in the top five in all but one of
the races over the weekend to
finish second overall. UC-Irvine's
three-time All-American Jamie
Malm, who dominated the regatta
with five first place finishes, was
the other qualifier.

Sargent is only the second Stan
ford sailor to qualify for the
Singlehanded Nationals since
1982. Coach Middleton is confi
dent in Sargent's potential to place
high at the national level. "There
will be 16 sailors at Nationals,"
he said. "A 1 proved himself
against some of the best last week
end and definitely has a shot at
winning."
Other Stanford sailors compet
ing at the regatta last weekend
were Rick Rosen, who finished
fourth, and Matt Sanford, who
placed seventh.
In the Women's Fall Champi
onships, the performances did not
live up to those of Sargent, Rosen
and Sanford at the Single
handed's. The regatta was high

lighted by Haley King and Marina
Kimball's third place finish in the
eight boat fleet. According to Mid-;
dleton, however, the team was dis-.
appointed in its performance. •
The Cardinal women all had
their moments, but the squad waK
inconsistent, resulting in mostly
mediocre finishes. "Our women'
lacked time in the boats and con-*
fidence in their ability," Middleton
said. "By spring, we will be sailing
so far above this level that it will
be hard to believe we are the same
team."
Also sailing in the women's
regatta were Catherine Ivey and
Lisa Forssell, who placed sixth,
and Stacey Misakian and Sydney
Roberts, who placed seventh.
