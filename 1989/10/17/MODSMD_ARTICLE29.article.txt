## 
### Michael Clayton Staff writer 
After fighting to a 0-0 tie with
California Sunday on the small,
rough confines of Strawberry
Field, the 19th-ranked Stanford
women's soccer team is over
joyed to return to the level,
wide-open spaces of Harry
Maloney Field to square off
against UC-Davis this afternoon
at 3:30 p.m.
On its home turf this season,
the Cardinal has been absolutely
dominant, winning all six games
by three or more goals and out
scoring opponents 29-1.
"We need to play each game
at this point in the season as if
it is a playoff game," Coach Ber
hane Andeberhan said.
The Aggies, contrary to An
deberhan's game plan, have not
played like a playoff-caliber
team this season. The UC-Davis
squad has struggled, pulling off
only two wins in its first 14
games. Presently, the Aggies are
in the middle of a seven-game
slide. They have been outscored
by opponents 38-10, and, in the
last three games, the Aggies
have managed to notch only one
goal to their opponents' nine.
Erin Malone, the Aggies'
leading scorer, has scored only
three goals the entire season. In
comparison to Malone, Stan
ford's leading scorer, junior Jen
nifer "Rocket" Rowland, scored
three goals in the Cardinal's last
home game. This season
Rowland has tallied up 30
points, with 13 goals and four
assists, and freshman standout
.Julie Foudy has added 28 points,
with 10 goals and eight assists.
The Cardinal, 8-3-1, has out
scored opponents 39-8, and, in
the last three games, Stanford

This trip is very
important. We need
to do well in Virginia.
We need at least a
split. But we would
prefer to come back
with a sweep.'

has scored seven goals while
their opponents have managed
only one. Rowland has scored
in every game at Maloney Field,
and junior goalie Flise Fdwards
has allowed an average of only
0.2 goals per game at home.
Stanford, however, will be
forced into using a new lineup.
Starting junior midfielder Jen
Bloomer injured her knee
Thursday at practice, and a doc
tor determined that Bloomer
had torn a ligament in her knee.
She will be looked at by another
doctor on Monday, but Bloomer

appears to be out for the season.
"I may need surgery for the
ligament, but with all the swell
ing my status is really up in the
air right now," Bloomer said.
"The doctor suggested I go
through a month of rehabilita
tion to see how stable the liga
ment is before I go into surgery."
Consequently, Stanford will
have to prepare for its final long
road trip of the season without
Bloomer. Thursday, the team
will depart for the East Coast
to participate in the Virginia In
vitational, playing Duke Satur
day and No. 7 Virginia Sunday.
On the road, the Cardinal squad
has not fared well this season,
marking up a 2-3-1 record. A
successful trip to Virginia could
bolster the chances that the Car
dinal would be selected by the
NCAA selection committee for
a postseason spot.
"We are definitely still in the
running for a postseason berth,"
Andeberhan said. "This trip is
very important. We need to do
well in Virginia. We need at least
a split. But we would prefer to
come back with a sweep."
After the Virginia trip, the
team will return to California
to finish the season. The Car
dinal will host three top-10
squads — No. 1 North Carolina,
No. 9 Wisconsin, and No. 3 UC-
Santa Barbara — and then
travel to the University of San
Francisco for the final game of
the regular season.
"The latter part of our
schedule includes good, quality
teams," Andeberhan said. "If,
for some reason, we do not make
the playoffs, our season has still
included many playoff teams. I
am excited for these games.
We've been training well, and
we'll perform well."
