### John Louie Staff writer 
At first glance, the field
hockey team's 2-0 loss to Chico
State sparks thoughts of dismay.
After all, it has been over a
month since the Cardinal posted
its last goal, against lowa. Sat
urday's loss to the Wildcats ex
tends the scoreless streak to six
games and the winless drought
to seven. In addition, coming
away from a conference game
with a loss is never something
to smile about.
Yet, anyone who saw this
weekend's match can't help but
feel optimistic, after witnessing
the birth of the team's strong
new offensive threat. Following
two weeks of preparation, the

Cardinal unveiled an offensive
strategy which, despite the loss,
dominated the Wildcats
throughout the game.
"We totally set the pace of the
game," forward Erin Mcßride
said. "We demonstrated what
we've been working on in prac
tices and pushed them hard the
whole way. I thought we
dominated the game."
Indeed, Stanford came out of
the starting blocks with a bang,
taking a shot on Chico State
within the match's first 30

seconds. For the Cardinal,
plagued by a lack of shooting all
season, this opening strike was
a harbinger of things to come.
At the final whistle, the Cardinal
registered 12 shots and 11 cor
ners, overshadowing the Wild
cats' 13 shots and 3 corners.
"The team did everything we
have been working on, offensive
ly," Coach Sheryl Johnson said.
"They played a really good
game."
But the hard-hitting Wildcats
showed an offense of their own.
Midway through the first half,
Chico State was able to convert
their only two fast break oppor
tunities into goals, behind the
hot hands of Julie Ramirez and
Darci Power.
"At halftime, coach just said

that they were lucky to score off
of those breaks," Mcßride said.
"She told us that if we kept
shooting, we'd have the same
chances of scoring."
Although Stanford controlled
the ball for most of the second
half, goals would not come easily.
The Cardinal's two major
breakaway opportunities proved
fruitless.
"The whole offense played
really well," forward Michele
Beynet said. "It was very disap
pointing to lose."
Stanford's record falls to 1-2-2
in the Northern Pacific Confer
ence and 1-5-2 overall.
However, with the upcoming
Cal Invitational on the horizon,
this introduction of an offensive
threat could prove invaluable.
