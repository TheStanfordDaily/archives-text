Illegible cards mean identity crisis
This fall, many Stanford students have reached
for their ID cards at the library or Registrar s Office
only to find ... they can't get them out.
And even if they succeed in removing the cards
from their plastic protectors, students may end up
with illegible IDs. Some cards become so unreadable
that they must be exchanged for new cards.
Most of the students who are returning their cards
because of illegibility are male, said Asst. Registrar
and Recorder Joy Parker. The gender-specific nature
of this problem apparently arises because male stu
dents tend to put the cards in their wallets and back
pockets and sit on them.
The heat generated seems to cause the cards to
stick against the plastic, which then pulls ofT the
ink. Women who keep their ID cards in plastic have
noted the same problem, though on a lesser scale.

Dave Hal pern, a portomonitor at Green Library
who checks student IDs, estimated that a third of
all airds he has seen this quarter have been hard
to read.
Another portomonitor, Rick Leon, added that if
people never remove their cards from inside their
wallets, the cards are fine. When the cards are
removed, however, they get "real splotchy." Last
night, for example, in a period of five hours, he told
two students to get new cards because the cards
were illegible.
A recently revised method of printing the study
list to which the ID is attached could account for
the disappearing ink, Parker said.
Before this quarter the cards had to be printed
before the study list. Now the package is printed
by flash forming, a process which can print every
thing at once — but which weakens the durability
of the ink.
Two measures are now being examined to resolve

the problem, Parker said. One possibility is ordering
a new printer which could produce a slicker surface
with the current card stock.
This option could take as long as a month. The
other involves retaining the present printer and
changing the card stock, a step which could have a
new set of IDs available as soon as stock of an
appropriate quality is found.

You thought your bill was high?
This academic year, Stanford will pay more than
$4 million in phone bills.
And as long distance usage fees increase every
year, this figure is expected to grow substantially
in coming years, Communication Services Director
Jan Thomson said.
The system is managed by Communication Serv
ices, which has its own telephone switch connected

to Pacific Bell's central office. Local calls go through
Pacific Bell's local network, while long distance calls
go through M.C.1., U.S. Sprint or A.T.&T, Thomson
said.
Communication Services keeps a record of all calls
made within the University, including information
on the time, location and duration of calls.
Stanford is expected to pay about $1.7 million to
$1.8 million this year for long distance service and
slightly over $1 million for local service. The total
$4 million figure also includes the cost of commu
nicating via the Gandorf Data Network, through
which phone users have access to Forsythe, SUNet
and other communications networks.
Having its own phone system is definitely bene
ficial for the University, Thomson said. It saves
money by allowing Stanford to handle costs system
atically and provides a great deal of flexibility, she
said.
