In a serious accident last week
at the World Gymnastics Cham
pionships in West Germany, soph
omore Adriana Duffy broke her
neck while practicing a vault
routine.
Duffy, of San Juan, Puerto Rico,
was performing a forward layout
during practice Thursday when
her hands slipped off the vault.
She landed on her head, breaking
her neck between the sixth and
seventh vertebrae.
Stanford Women's Gymnastics
Coach Brack Greenwood, who was
not at the meet, said yesterday
that Duffy experienced instant
numbness from her neck down.
She had an operation soon after
the accident, according to the As-

sociated Press.
Doctors called the
operation, which
lasted about two
hours, a success.
Dr. Klaus
Steinbrueck, a
member of the in
ternational gym-

nasties federa
tion's medical

team, said it was too early to de
termine if the 18-year-old gym
nast would suffer permanent
damage or paralysis.
Greenwood said that as of yes
terday, Duffy had regained some
sensation in her legs.
Duffy's parents are currently
with her in Stuttgart, West Ger
many. She is expected to return
to either Puerto Rico or the
United States within a week for

further treatment.
Duffy, a member of Puerto
Rico's national team, was complet
ing for the second time in the
championships. Her first world
championship meet was in 1987.
She is also a member of Stanford's
varsity gymnastics team.
Duffy is a prospective philoso
phy major and a member of the
Gamma Phi Beta sorority. She
lives in Okada House.
"She's so far away, it's hard to
tell what is happening," said Bar
bara Chang, resident fellow at
Okada. "But we are hoping we
will be able to hear from her
soon."
In 1979, Elena Muchina, a
world champion gymnast from the
Soviet Union, suffered a similar
accident. She has been confined
to a wheelchair since.
