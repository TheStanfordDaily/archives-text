# False alarms plague Roble residents

Residents of Roble Hall have recently been the
victims of a number of false fire alarms during all
hours of the day and night, but University officials
say they have not yet discovered the cause of the
false alarms.
The two most recent false alarms, which occurred
at around 5 a.m. on Friday and Saturday, have left
residents unhappy with the unpredictability of the
situation. "It is not much fun to be woken up at
five when you aren't expecting it," said Roble res
ident fellow Ann Porteus.
But the more pressing concern is safety, Porteus
said. With each false alarm, fewer and fewer resi
dents are responding to the alarms and leaving the
dormitory. Porteus likened the situation to "crying
wolf."

"When it's real we want people coming outside,"
Porteus said. "We don't want people's lives endan
gered."
Facilities Project Management has not located the
exact cause of the problem.
Design engineers are in the process of checking
for malfunctions in the electrical equipment, accord
ing to John Ryan of Facilities Project Management.
Currently the tamper switches are all being indi
vidually tested for problems.
The erratic false alarms are most likely due to
the newness of the system, Ryan said. Every newly
installed system like the one in Roble is filled with
water. Changes in water pressure — which might
be caused by people tampering with the system's
valves, air bubbles or Roble's automatic lawn
sprinklers — will trip tamper switches, which in
turn set ofT the alarm.
