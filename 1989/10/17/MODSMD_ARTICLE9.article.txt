## Bush, Fed move to calm investors 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Presi
dent Bush provided reassuring
words Monday in an effort to calm
gyrating financial markets while
the Federal Reserve backed up the
words with $2 billion in cash
poured into the U.S. banking sys
tem.
The Fed's supply of cash was
viewed as a sizable effort on the
part of the central bank to contain
the Friday the 13th stock market
plunge and make sure it did not
have disastrous ripple effects
through the rest of the economy.
Private economists gave Fed of
ficials high marks for their han
dling of the matter, praising the
speed with which the Fed played
a key role in helping to calm the
market jitters.
The Dow Jones average of 30
industrials, after suffering a 190-
point plunge Friday, rose 88.12
points on Monday in the fourth
heaviest trading day in the history
of the New York Stock Exchange.
Richard Breeden, the new chair
man of the Securities and Ex
change Commission, said that the
market's performance showed
that the markets and government
regulators had learned lessons
from the market collapse two
years ago when the Dow Jones
average had plummeted a record
508 points.
"Today's developments demon
strate the value of the significant
improvements that have been

made in trading systems over the
past two years," Breeden said in
a statement after the markets had
closed.
Bush declared, "I'm not
worried," when asked by reporters
about Friday's market turmoil
during a morning photo session
at the White House.
The president stressed that
Treasury Secretary Nicholas
Brady and officials at the Securi
ties and Exchange Commission
and the Federal Reserve were
keeping close tabs on develop
ments.
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan
Greenspan echoed that sentiment
in a speech before the American
Bankers Association. Greenspan
said the Fed had also been in
"productive contact" with foreign
governments.
Greenspan did not elaborate on
what actions the United States
and other governments were
taking, but one hour after his ad
dress, the Federal Reserve Bank
of New York announced that it
had injected $2 billion into the
banking system.
This sizable infusion of cash
served to back up comments made
by a senior Fed official over the
weekend that the central bank
stood ready to flood the banking
system with money, if necessary,
to contain the damage from Fri
day's plunge.
While an infusion of cash can

not by itself push stock prices
higher, it does serve to reassure
nervous bankers that they need
not cut off credit to securities
firms that may have suffered
heavy losses in a market dive.
The brokerage houses, assured
of a reliable line of credit, are
thus not forced to dump more
stock to replenish their dwindling
supplies of cash. Such forced stock
sales can drive prices down even
further.
The Fed accomplished the $2
billion infusion of cash by buying
that amount of government secu
rities from banks. The money pro
vided by the Fed to purchase the
securities increased the amount
of reserves banks have to make
loans.
The process by which the Fed
buys and sells government secu
rities from commercial banks is
the principal method by which the
central bank controls the growth
of the U.S. money supply.
The $2 billion infusion of
money was termed sizable by
private economists. They said if
it had not been for the market
turmoil, the Fed more than likely
would have been draining cash
from the banking system in an
effort to keep interest rates
steady.
To mop up an excess supply of
cash, the Fed reverses the proce
dure and sells government secu
rities to commercial banks. The

banks are then left with smaller
reserves of cash on which to make
loans.
Because of the Fed's efforts to
expand the money supply, the
closely watched federal funds in
terest rate fell to 8.50 percent
Monday. That rate, at which
banks make overnight loans to
each other, had been 8.82 percent
last Thursday.
The Fed's efforts to counteract
the sudden loss of $200 billion in
stock values Friday had the effect
of lowering interest rates, some
thing that the administration has
been pressuring the central bank
to do for some time as a way of
keeping the country out of a reces
sion next year.
The Fed has been resisting
those moves with Fed officials
contending that they were still
concerned about inflationary
pressures in the economy.
A Fed official stressed that the
central bank could insure that the
short-term effects of the Fed's
moves did not lead to inflationary
pressures by draining away any
excess reserves once the immedi
ate crisis has passed.
Allen Sinai, chief economist of
the Boston Co., said that the Fed
had to be very careful that its
efforts to calm the stock market
turmoil did not lower interest
rates so much that the U.S. dollar
came under heavy selling pres
sure.

average had plummeted a record
508 points.
"Today's developments demon
strate the value of the significant
improvements that have been

made in trading systems over the
past two years," Breeden said in
a statement after the markets had
closed.
Bush declared, "I'm not
worried," when asked by reporters
about Friday's market turmoil
during a morning photo session
at the White House.
The president stressed that
Treasury Secretary Nicholas
Brady and officials at the Securi
ties and Exchange Commission
and the Federal Reserve were
keeping close tabs on develop
ments.
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan
Greenspan echoed that sentiment
in a speech before the American
Bankers Association. Greenspan
said the Fed had also been in
"productive contact" with foreign
governments.
Greenspan did not elaborate on
what actions the United States
and other governments were
taking, but one hour after his ad
dress, the Federal Reserve Bank
of New York announced that it
had injected $2 billion into the
banking system.
This sizable infusion of cash
served to back up comments made
by a senior Fed official over the
weekend that the central bank
stood ready to flood the banking
system with money, if necessary,
to contain the damage from Fri
day's plunge.
While an infusion of cash can

not by itself push stock prices
higher, it does serve to reassure
nervous bankers that they need
not cut off credit to securities
firms that may have suffered
heavy losses in a market dive.
The brokerage houses, assured
of a reliable line of credit, are
thus not forced to dump more
stock to replenish their dwindling
supplies of cash. Such forced stock
sales can drive prices down even
further.
The Fed accomplished the $2
billion infusion of cash by buying
that amount of government secu
rities from banks. The money pro
vided by the Fed to purchase the
securities increased the amount
of reserves banks have to make
loans.
The process by which the Fed
buys and sells government secu
rities from commercial banks is
the principal method by which the
central bank controls the growth
of the U.S. money supply.
The $2 billion infusion of
money was termed sizable by
private economists. They said if
it had not been for the market
turmoil, the Fed more than likely
would have been draining cash
from the banking system in an
effort to keep interest rates
steady.
To mop up an excess supply of
cash, the Fed reverses the proce
dure and sells government secu
rities to commercial banks. The

banks are then left with smaller
reserves of cash on which to make
loans.
Because of the Fed's efforts to
expand the money supply, the
closely watched federal funds in
terest rate fell to 8.50 percent
Monday. That rate, at which
banks make overnight loans to
each other, had been 8.82 percent
last Thursday.
The Fed's efforts to counteract
the sudden loss of $200 billion in
stock values Friday had the effect
of lowering interest rates, some
thing that the administration has
been pressuring the central bank
to do for some time as a way of
keeping the country out of a reces
sion next year.
The Fed has been resisting
those moves with Fed officials
contending that they were still
concerned about inflationary
pressures in the economy.
A Fed official stressed that the
central bank could insure that the
short-term effects of the Fed's
moves did not lead to inflationary
pressures by draining away any
excess reserves once the immedi
ate crisis has passed.
Allen Sinai, chief economist of
the Boston Co., said that the Fed
had to be very careful that its
efforts to calm the stock market
turmoil did not lower interest
rates so much that the U.S. dollar
came under heavy selling pres
sure.

Prices rebounded sharply after an initial dive on Wall Street Monday,
marking a turnaround from the declines of Wall Street's Friday the
13th scare.
WASHINGTON (AP) - Presi
dent Bush provided reassuring
words Monday in an effort to calm
gyrating financial markets while
the Federal Reserve backed up the
words with $2 billion in cash
poured into the U.S. banking sys
tem.
The Fed's supply of cash was
viewed as a sizable effort on the
part of the central bank to contain
the Friday the 13th stock market
plunge and make sure it did not
have disastrous ripple effects
through the rest of the economy.
Private economists gave Fed of
ficials high marks for their han
dling of the matter, praising the
speed with which the Fed played
a key role in helping to calm the
market jitters.
The Dow Jones average of 30
industrials, after suffering a 190-
point plunge Friday, rose 88.12
points on Monday in the fourth
heaviest trading day in the history
of the New York Stock Exchange.
Richard Breeden, the new chair
man of the Securities and Ex
change Commission, said that the
market's performance showed
that the markets and government
regulators had learned lessons
from the market collapse two
years ago when the Dow Jones
average had plummeted a record
508 points.
"Today's developments demon
strate the value of the significant
improvements that have been

made in trading systems over the
