At IBM,
outstanding people don't stand still.
So you always thought IBMers were
a bunch of blue striped suits
with buttoned down m i nds.
Nothing could be further
from the truth.
They're movers and shakers.
Energetic, ambitious and smart. People
who know where they're going and
get there fast. People with ideas who choose
IBM because they know their ideas will
be heard and put into action.
That's right. The winds of change are
sweeping the vast corporate infrastructure of
IBM. Today's IBM is a leaner, more streamlined
operation that reacts more quickly. We've broken
through the layers of bureaucracy to create a
company that takes more risks... is closer to
the customer.. .and encourages IBMers to
speak up, challenge old ways of thinking
and initiate new ideas.
This is not a company that simply rests on its
past successes. We're sharing our blueprint for the
future with both our staff and competitors.
We've become more robust,
expanding with the market
place ... and even developing
products that easily hook up
with systems outside the
IBM environment.

"I see unlimited
opportunities for
advancement at
IBM.. both in the
technical and
managerial ranks.
We have our share of
technical challenges
and our share of the
right people to meet
them. Professionals
who are committed
to quality and excel
lence in all they do.
And by the way,
they know how to
have fun too."

"At IBM 1 can be
a systems engineer,
marketing represen
tative, education
instructor, programmer,
engineer, specialist or
generalist... all with
the same company.
Where the people are
high achievers with big
dreams and tons of enthu
siasm. Where not one day
Ls the same as the next.
I would not change it for
anything in the world."

instrumentation to elect?\>n4)eam technology
and satellite transmission. 7\ppiying the latest
information technologies. . .and working
alongside some of the industry's brightest

You'll earn early recognition and have the
opportunity for exposure to multiple projects. At
IBM, no idea is too small to reach management's
ear and get quick response.
You'll have plenty of room to grow because
we're a company that promotes from within.
IBMers have the option to move from one area to
another.. .to relocate to a variety of sites.. .
and to follow a career track along purely
technical lines or into management. All the
while moving up just as fast and as far as
your talent will take you.
"The thing that
gets me going
the most Ls the
possibilities, the
endless possibilities.
This Ls a company
where I can, within
reason, call my own
shots about my
future. If I want to
develop a career as
a top-level IBM
manager, I can do
that. If I want to
become an IBM
Fellow eventually, I
can make that hap
pen too. Career
development at
IBM Ls primarily
the responsibility of
the individual; the
manager is there to
facilitate and coun
sel. Having that
degree of control
over my own future
career Ls exciting."
