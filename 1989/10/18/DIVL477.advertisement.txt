How to take
the shock out
of the future.
Sometimes modern living is just a
scramble to keep pace with the
changes and challenges wrought by
technology. But at other times, the
same technological advances give
us wings.
In the Media of the
Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, the emphasis is on
creating those wings. The director,
Professor Nicholas Negroponte,
tells how they're taking the shock
out of the future in the second of
this year's Tech Talks.
Can you imagine, for example, a
personal computer on your wrist?
Negroponte will discuss the work of
the Media Lab. which is involved in
high tech forecasting. He'll look at
how innovations are revolutionizing
our lives.
