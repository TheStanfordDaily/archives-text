# 7.0 quake rocks Stanford

building, Pratap Malik was warm
ing up his car's engine when the
quake hit. The ground started to
shift. Malik opened his door and
dashed clear seconds before a
chimney collapsed, flattening his
automobile. Four hours later, the
lights on what was left of Malik's
car were still on.
In the southeast corner of the
Quad, a student was trapped un
der bookcases that were toppled
by the quake. Fissures opened
along the arches leading to the
Inner Quad. Sandstone and red
roof tiles littered the area, but
the student and others like him
who were in the Quad when the
quake hit remained unharmed.
At Phi Psi, a student was
reading on the first floor deck
when the shaking began. She got
up and moved away from the
building. When she looked back,
one of Phi Psi's chimneys had col
lapsed through the deck. But she
was safe.
The Clock Tower clock stopped
at 5:04 p.m. yesterday but every
thing else kept moving. Stanford
and the surrounding area were
rocked by an earthquake that
measured 7.0 on the Richter scale.
At Stanford, buildings cracked,
chimneys collapsed and the
damage will probably take a long
time to fix, but no major injuries
were reported.
The quake, which hit at 5:04
p.m. yesterday, was the largest in
the Bay Area since the 1906 quake
that leveled San Francisco. That
quake was reported to be 8.3
points on the Richter scale.
The quake's epicenter was near
Hollister, which is about 20 miles
southwest of San Jose. Four af
tershocks were reported between
5:04 and 8:30 p.m., all registering
over 4.0 on the Richter scale.

Center Director Helmut Kra
winkler said that the scale is
incremented in factors of 10, so a
7.0 is 10 times as powerful as a
6.0. He said that at around 12 or
so, "the whole earth splits in half."
Despite the high reading on the
scale, injury reports at Stanford
remain low.
No people with serious injuries
were admitted to the emergency
room at the Stanford University
Hospital.

the fifth story of scaffolding of a
Palo Alto construction project and
sustained the worst injuries. The
man broke an arm and was
treated in the emergency room at
the Hospital.
According to Mike Goodkind, a
spokesperson for the Medical Cen
ter, many more minor cases are
expected to trickle in over the next
24 or 48 hours. Immediately after
the earthquake, emergency room
personnel streamed in to respond
to the possible emergency, but
many of the dozens of workers
stood helpless as only seven minor
injuries came in.
Eleven patients of a drug and
alcohol abuse program were
removed from the Hoover Pavil
ion and taken to the newer
Children's Hospital for safety
reasons.
Damage reports on the hospital
were not available, but an impor
tant CT scanner — an alternative
to an X-ray machine — was
destroyed, which could potentially
be a problem for treatment of
some patients.
The Lifeflight helicopter, which
is used in emergencies, was used
to bring in at last a couple earth
quake victims, but one 15-year-old
boy with head injuries had to
rerouted because of damage to the
CT scanner that was necessary
to assess his injuries.
Damage reports around campus
were few shortly after the quake
but steadily increased as the night
progressed.
Eileen Walsh, a spokesperson
for the University, said there are
cracks fn Hoover Tower, but the
extent of the damage is unknown.
At Columbae, located at 549
Mayfield, a pair of parallel cracks
ran horizontally around the out
side of the wooden Row House.
The portion of the building above
the cracks appeared to have
moved north toward Braun Music
Center.
In the rear, one external wall

was conspicuously bulging out
ward.
Residents feared that Columbae
had come off its foundation, but
Resident Assistant Matt Price,
who awaited inspection from Uni
versity facilities supervisors,
could not confirm the structural
damage.
"It looks like it (Columbae) was
going to just walk right ofT the
foundation," explained Columbae
resident Sharon Hartwell as she
ate dinner outside.
As of 6:45, Price said that no
residents remained in Columbae
and that he was waiting further
instructions from Row Facilities
before re-entering the building.
Columbae is home to 40 residents.
"Everything has fallen down,"
Price said minutes after the earth
quake. "I expect we'll be moving."
Price later inspected the inside
of Columbae and was more opti
mistic. "There is minor damage
— books, plaster and stuff — but
I expect we'll get to stay tonight
inside."
"Even if they say it's safe, I'm
not sure I'll go back in (to
Columbae)," said senior Lisa
Brooks. Brooks, from Auburn,
Calif., was on the second floor of
Columbae during the earthquake.
"They said the damage is
minor, but I have a bad feeling
we'll be living somewhere else,"
Brooks continued.
"I was standing in the kitchen,
and things started shaking," said
graduate student Hubert Hsieh,
who rested on the Columbae lawn
after the quake. "Pots were falling
and plaster was falling off the
ceiling, so we ran outside."
Green and Meyer Libraries were
also hit hard, as thousands of
books were strewn on the floors
of both.
Eleanor Stewart, head of Con
servation Treatment of the Green
Stacks, reported fairly extensive
damage in the upper floors of
Green Library.
The East Wing of Green just
finished rennovation last year to
make it more earthquake safe. Ac
cording to Stewart, "The new part
held . . . but the higher up, the
more extensive the damage."
Books and bookcases were
strewn all over on the third floor,
which will take some time to set
straight. There were no reports
of water or gas leaks, however.

Phi Psi House was one of the hardest hit buildings on campus. Several other dorms suffered major
damage as welt.
