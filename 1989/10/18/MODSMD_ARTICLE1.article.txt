building, Pratap Malik was warm
ing up his car's engine when the
quake hit. The ground started to
shift. Malik opened his door and
dashed clear seconds before a
chimney collapsed, flattening his
automobile. Four hours later, the
lights on what was left of Malik's
car were still on.
In the southeast corner of the
Quad, a student was trapped un
der bookcases that were toppled
by the quake. Fissures opened
along the arches leading to the
Inner Quad. Sandstone and red
roof tiles littered the area, but
the student and others like him
who were in the Quad when the
quake hit remained unharmed.
At Phi Psi, a student was
reading on the first floor deck
when the shaking began. She got
up and moved away from the
building. When she looked back,
one of Phi Psi's chimneys had col
lapsed through the deck. But she
was safe.
The Clock Tower clock stopped
at 5:04 p.m. yesterday but every
thing else kept moving. Stanford
and the surrounding area were
rocked by an earthquake that
measured 7.0 on the Richter scale.
At Stanford, buildings cracked,
chimneys collapsed and the
damage will probably take a long
time to fix, but no major injuries
were reported.
The quake, which hit at 5:04
p.m. yesterday, was the largest in
the Bay Area since the 1906 quake
that leveled San Francisco. That
quake was reported to be 8.3
points on the Richter scale.
The quake's epicenter was near
Hollister, which is about 20 miles
southwest of San Jose. Four af
tershocks were reported between
5:04 and 8:30 p.m., all registering
over 4.0 on the Richter scale.
, Blume Earthquake Engineering
Center Director Helmut Kra
winkler said that the scale is
incremented in factors of 10, so a
7.0 is 10 times as powerful as a
6.0. He said that at around 12 or
so, "the whole earth splits in half."
Despite the high reading on the
scale, injury reports at Stanford
remain low.
No people with serious injuries
were admitted to the emergency
room at the Stanford University
Hospital.

the fifth story of scaffolding of a
Palo Alto construction project and
sustained the worst injuries. The
man broke an arm and was
treated in the emergency room at
the Hospital.
According to Mike Goodkind, a
spokesperson for the Medical Cen
ter, many more minor cases are
expected to trickle in over the next
24 or 48 hours. Immediately after
the earthquake, emergency room
personnel streamed in to respond
to the possible emergency, but
many of the dozens of workers
stood helpless as only seven minor
injuries came in.
Eleven patients of a drug and
alcohol abuse program were
removed from the Hoover Pavil
ion and taken to the newer
Children's Hospital for safety
reasons.
Damage reports on the hospital
were not available, but an impor
tant CT scanner — an alternative
to an X-ray machine — was
destroyed, which could potentially
be a problem for treatment of
some patients.
The Lifeflight helicopter, which
is used in emergencies, was used
to bring in at last a couple earth
quake victims, but one 15-year-old
boy with head injuries had to
rerouted because of damage to the
CT scanner that was necessary
to assess his injuries.
Damage reports around campus
were few shortly after the quake
but steadily increased as the night
progressed.
Eileen Walsh, a spokesperson
for the University, said there are
cracks fn Hoover Tower, but the
extent of the damage is unknown.
At Columbae, located at 549
Mayfield, a pair of parallel cracks
ran horizontally around the out
side of the wooden Row House.
The portion of the building above
the cracks appeared to have
moved north toward Braun Music
Center.
In the rear, one external wall

was conspicuously bulging out
ward.
Residents feared that Columbae
had come off its foundation, but
Resident Assistant Matt Price,
who awaited inspection from Uni
versity facilities supervisors,
could not confirm the structural
damage.
"It looks like it (Columbae) was
going to just walk right ofT the
foundation," explained Columbae
resident Sharon Hartwell as she
ate dinner outside.
As of 6:45, Price said that no
residents remained in Columbae
and that he was waiting further
instructions from Row Facilities
before re-entering the building.
Columbae is home to 40 residents.
"Everything has fallen down,"
Price said minutes after the earth
quake. "I expect we'll be moving."
Price later inspected the inside
of Columbae and was more opti
mistic. "There is minor damage
— books, plaster and stuff — but
I expect we'll get to stay tonight
inside."
"Even if they say it's safe, I'm
not sure I'll go back in (to
Columbae)," said senior Lisa
Brooks. Brooks, from Auburn,
Calif., was on the second floor of
Columbae during the earthquake.
"They said the damage is
minor, but I have a bad feeling
we'll be living somewhere else,"
Brooks continued.
"I was standing in the kitchen,
and things started shaking," said
graduate student Hubert Hsieh,
who rested on the Columbae lawn
after the quake. "Pots were falling
and plaster was falling off the
ceiling, so we ran outside."
Green and Meyer Libraries were
also hit hard, as thousands of
books were strewn on the floors
of both.
Eleanor Stewart, head of Con
servation Treatment of the Green
Stacks, reported fairly extensive
damage in the upper floors of
Green Library.
The East Wing of Green just
finished rennovation last year to
make it more earthquake safe. Ac
cording to Stewart, "The new part
held . . . but the higher up, the
more extensive the damage."
Books and bookcases were
strewn all over on the third floor,
which will take some time to set
straight. There were no reports
of water or gas leaks, however.

Phi Psi House was one of the hardest hit buildings on campus. Several other dorms suffered major
damage as welt.
Several lamps and other glass
also broke at the libraries, as well
as several other locations on
campus.
Power outages, which swept
through the Bay Area, missed
most of Stanford except for a few
faculty houses on Stanford Drive.
As of 9:15 last night, a spokes
person for Pacific Gas and
Electric estimated that as many
as one quarter of the company's
four million customers had no
electricity. At least 500,000 cus
tomers lost power after the quake.
She said San Francisco, Oakland,
San Jose, Hollister and Santa
Cruz were the areas hit hardest
by the quake.
In addition to power outages,
gas service was disrupted due to
broken distribution lines. PG&E
was attempting to find these
breaks last night before turning
on electricity.
Some parts of the Quad sus
tained structural damage, includ
ing the loss of some tiles from
the mosaic on the front of
Memorial Church.
A handful of Stanford students
decided to get a piece of the Quad
to take home with them, scaveng
ing around the Quad looking for
loose pieces of sandstone, mortar
and gold tiles from the mosaic.
Freshmen Blake Masters and
Jonathan Aitken said that they
"heard that the Quad was hit hard
by the quake and decided to come
investigate."
What they found was dust from
the mortar between the stones
and even pieces of the stone itself.
"It'll make great souvenirs," said
freshman Angela Chen, adding
that she plans to "send pieces
home to my friends."
Police have blocked off several
sections of the Quad, including
Memorial Church, to investigate
the damage.
Flooding was reported in
several campus dormitories due
to burst water pipes.
According to junior Mike
Novotny, resident assistant in
Trancos, a burst waterpipe in the
kitchenette caused the lounge to

flood.
He added that there were
bulges in walls separating rooms,
primarily on the first floor.
Novotny said the walls "bulge"
about two inches, but that the
bulges cover approximately two
thirds of the wall. These walls are
also cracked.
Trancos was inspected and
deemed safe, he said.
Some residences reported shifts
in house foundations, including
parts of the Suites complex.
Parts of the Suites have shifted
approximately one-fourth of an
inch off their foundation, accord
ing to Suites facilities supervisor
Barry Reuter.
A natural gas leak was reported
on the second or third floor of
Mirrielees immediately after the
earthquake struck, forcing resi
dents to remain outside the build
ing for over half an hour.
Resident assistant Suzanna
Mak notified the Palo Alto Fire
Department, which sent personnel
to the scene to shut oft the gas.
According to Mak, Escondido Vil
lage maintenance will be able to
assess and fix the gas leak Wed
nesday.
Senior Beth Hollenberg was
putting on her socks when the
first waves of yesterday's earth
quake rocked Mirrielees, where
she is a resident assistant.
"Everything started rumbling and
swaying. Lamps fell down . . . and
our rice cakes flew out from the
cupboard."
Investigating engineers found
damage to the first-floor founda
tion of Mirrielees. "You could feel
the ridges (of the broken founda
tion) through the carpets," Hol
lenberg said.
Investigators found cracks in
the landings, as well as consider
able plaster damage throughout
Mirrielees. The dorm reopened,
however, just after 11:30 p.m.
Other reports show the damage
was distributed throughout the
campus:
• A broken gas line in the
McCullough building was leaking
argon, a gas found in the atmos
phere, but the leak presented no
danger, according to Ken Williams
of the McCullough emergency re
sponse team.
"All compressed gases are dan

gerous, but argon is probably the
least dangerous," Williams said,
adding that the amount of gas
leaking out was too small to pose
a threat.
• Some pieces of artwork in the
Stanford Art Museum suffered
major damage from the quake.
Many ceramics that were part
of a special exhibition of Jose Ver
meersch sculptures were smashed
to dust, Museum Director Wanda
Corn said. The whole lobby and
several upstairs galleries were
also cracked.
Corn said the museum will be
closed indefinitely.
• At 553 Mayfield, one minor
injury was reported when sopho
more John Abbot suffered lacera
tions of both feet from broken
bottles. Resident Assistant Alan
Symonds reported no other inju
ries and only minor damage.
External structural damage —
a crack running vertically from a
first floor door to near a second
floor window — was also visible
on the side facing away from
Mayfield Drive.
• Stanford Shopping Center also
sustained damages. According to
Macy's employee Dan Hogue, an
'88 graduate, "a number of store
front windows were shattered."
Many displays in Macy's were
knocked down, as well as a num
ber of ceiling titles.
"Most merchants closed up shop
by 5:20," Hogue said. He added
that shoppers were not allowed
back into Macy's to retrieve their
belongings.
• In Terman Engineering Build
ing, the seismograph machine on
the second floor was still running,
but there was a wild scribbling
next to which someone had writ
ten 5:05 p.m. Oct. 16.

A natural gas leak was reported
on the second or third floor of
Mirrielees immediately after the
earthquake struck, forcing resi

As this room in the American Studies House illustrates, students' rooms were left in chaos even in
those dorms that escaped structural damage.
Behind the Old Chemistry
building, Pratap Malik was warm
ing up his car's engine when the
quake hit. The ground started to
shift. Malik opened his door and
dashed clear seconds before a
chimney collapsed, flattening his
automobile. Four hours later, the
lights on what was left of Malik's
car were still on.
In the southeast corner of the
Quad, a student was trapped un
der bookcases that were toppled
by the quake. Fissures opened
along the arches leading to the
Inner Quad. Sandstone and red
roof tiles littered the area, but
the student and others like him
who were in the Quad when the
quake hit remained unharmed.
At Phi Psi, a student was
reading on the first floor deck
when the shaking began. She got
up and moved away from the
building. When she looked back,
one of Phi Psi's chimneys had col
lapsed through the deck. But she
was safe.
The Clock Tower clock stopped
at 5:04 p.m. yesterday but every
thing else kept moving. Stanford
and the surrounding area were
rocked by an earthquake that
measured 7.0 on the Richter scale.
At Stanford, buildings cracked,
chimneys collapsed and the
damage will probably take a long
time to fix, but no major injuries
were reported.
The quake, which hit at 5:04
p.m. yesterday, was the largest in
the Bay Area since the 1906 quake
that leveled San Francisco. That
quake was reported to be 8.3
points on the Richter scale.
The quake's epicenter was near
Hollister, which is about 20 miles
southwest of San Jose. Four af
tershocks were reported between
5:04 and 8:30 p.m., all registering
over 4.0 on the Richter scale.
, Blume Earthquake Engineering
Center Director Helmut Kra
winkler said that the scale is
incremented in factors of 10, so a
7.0 is 10 times as powerful as a
6.0. He said that at around 12 or
so, "the whole earth splits in half."
Despite the high reading on the
scale, injury reports at Stanford
remain low.
No people with serious injuries
were admitted to the emergency
room at the Stanford University
Hospital.
One man jumped or fell from

the fifth story of scaffolding of a
Palo Alto construction project and
sustained the worst injuries. The
man broke an arm and was
treated in the emergency room at
the Hospital.
According to Mike Goodkind, a
spokesperson for the Medical Cen
ter, many more minor cases are
expected to trickle in over the next
24 or 48 hours. Immediately after
the earthquake, emergency room
personnel streamed in to respond
to the possible emergency, but
many of the dozens of workers
stood helpless as only seven minor
injuries came in.
Eleven patients of a drug and
alcohol abuse program were
removed from the Hoover Pavil
ion and taken to the newer
Children's Hospital for safety
reasons.
Damage reports on the hospital
were not available, but an impor
tant CT scanner — an alternative
to an X-ray machine — was
destroyed, which could potentially
be a problem for treatment of
some patients.
The Lifeflight helicopter, which
is used in emergencies, was used
to bring in at last a couple earth
quake victims, but one 15-year-old
boy with head injuries had to
rerouted because of damage to the
CT scanner that was necessary
to assess his injuries.
Damage reports around campus
were few shortly after the quake
but steadily increased as the night
progressed.
Eileen Walsh, a spokesperson
for the University, said there are
cracks fn Hoover Tower, but the
extent of the damage is unknown.
At Columbae, located at 549
Mayfield, a pair of parallel cracks
ran horizontally around the out
side of the wooden Row House.
The portion of the building above
the cracks appeared to have
moved north toward Braun Music
Center.
In the rear, one external wall

was conspicuously bulging out
ward.
Residents feared that Columbae
had come off its foundation, but
Resident Assistant Matt Price,
who awaited inspection from Uni
versity facilities supervisors,
could not confirm the structural
damage.
"It looks like it (Columbae) was
going to just walk right ofT the
foundation," explained Columbae
resident Sharon Hartwell as she
ate dinner outside.
As of 6:45, Price said that no
residents remained in Columbae
and that he was waiting further
instructions from Row Facilities
before re-entering the building.
Columbae is home to 40 residents.
"Everything has fallen down,"
Price said minutes after the earth
quake. "I expect we'll be moving."
Price later inspected the inside
of Columbae and was more opti
mistic. "There is minor damage
— books, plaster and stuff — but
I expect we'll get to stay tonight
inside."
"Even if they say it's safe, I'm
not sure I'll go back in (to
Columbae)," said senior Lisa
Brooks. Brooks, from Auburn,
Calif., was on the second floor of
Columbae during the earthquake.
"They said the damage is
minor, but I have a bad feeling
we'll be living somewhere else,"
Brooks continued.
"I was standing in the kitchen,
and things started shaking," said
graduate student Hubert Hsieh,
who rested on the Columbae lawn
after the quake. "Pots were falling
and plaster was falling off the
ceiling, so we ran outside."
Green and Meyer Libraries were
also hit hard, as thousands of
books were strewn on the floors
of both.
Eleanor Stewart, head of Con
servation Treatment of the Green
Stacks, reported fairly extensive
damage in the upper floors of
Green Library.
The East Wing of Green just
finished rennovation last year to
make it more earthquake safe. Ac
cording to Stewart, "The new part
held . . . but the higher up, the
more extensive the damage."
Books and bookcases were
strewn all over on the third floor,
which will take some time to set
straight. There were no reports
of water or gas leaks, however.

Phi Psi House was one of the hardest hit buildings on campus. Several other dorms suffered major
damage as welt.
Several lamps and other glass
also broke at the libraries, as well
as several other locations on
campus.
Power outages, which swept
through the Bay Area, missed
most of Stanford except for a few
faculty houses on Stanford Drive.
As of 9:15 last night, a spokes

Columbae is home to 40 residents.
"Everything has fallen down,"
Price said minutes after the earth

— books, plaster and stuff — but
I expect we'll get to stay tonight
inside."
"Even if they say it's safe, I'm
not sure I'll go back in (to

Phi Psi House was one of the hardest hit buildings on campus. Several other dorms suffered major
damage as welt.
Several lamps and other glass
also broke at the libraries, as well
as several other locations on
campus.
Power outages, which swept
through the Bay Area, missed
most of Stanford except for a few
faculty houses on Stanford Drive.
As of 9:15 last night, a spokes
person for Pacific Gas and
Electric estimated that as many
as one quarter of the company's
four million customers had no
electricity. At least 500,000 cus
tomers lost power after the quake.
She said San Francisco, Oakland,
San Jose, Hollister and Santa
Cruz were the areas hit hardest
by the quake.
In addition to power outages,
gas service was disrupted due to
broken distribution lines. PG&E
was attempting to find these
breaks last night before turning
on electricity.
Some parts of the Quad sus
tained structural damage, includ
ing the loss of some tiles from
the mosaic on the front of
Memorial Church.
A handful of Stanford students
decided to get a piece of the Quad
to take home with them, scaveng
ing around the Quad looking for
loose pieces of sandstone, mortar
and gold tiles from the mosaic.
Freshmen Blake Masters and
Jonathan Aitken said that they
"heard that the Quad was hit hard
by the quake and decided to come
investigate."
What they found was dust from
the mortar between the stones
and even pieces of the stone itself.
"It'll make great souvenirs," said
freshman Angela Chen, adding
that she plans to "send pieces
home to my friends."
Police have blocked off several
sections of the Quad, including
Memorial Church, to investigate
the damage.
Flooding was reported in
several campus dormitories due
to burst water pipes.
According to junior Mike
Novotny, resident assistant in
Trancos, a burst waterpipe in the
kitchenette caused the lounge to

flood.
He added that there were
bulges in walls separating rooms,
primarily on the first floor.
Novotny said the walls "bulge"
about two inches, but that the
bulges cover approximately two
thirds of the wall. These walls are
also cracked.
Trancos was inspected and
deemed safe, he said.
Some residences reported shifts
in house foundations, including
parts of the Suites complex.
Parts of the Suites have shifted
approximately one-fourth of an
inch off their foundation, accord
ing to Suites facilities supervisor
Barry Reuter.
A natural gas leak was reported
on the second or third floor of
Mirrielees immediately after the
earthquake struck, forcing resi
dents to remain outside the build
ing for over half an hour.
Resident assistant Suzanna
Mak notified the Palo Alto Fire
Department, which sent personnel
to the scene to shut oft the gas.
According to Mak, Escondido Vil
lage maintenance will be able to
assess and fix the gas leak Wed
nesday.
Senior Beth Hollenberg was
putting on her socks when the
first waves of yesterday's earth
quake rocked Mirrielees, where
she is a resident assistant.
"Everything started rumbling and
swaying. Lamps fell down . . . and
our rice cakes flew out from the
cupboard."
Investigating engineers found
damage to the first-floor founda
tion of Mirrielees. "You could feel
the ridges (of the broken founda
tion) through the carpets," Hol
lenberg said.
Investigators found cracks in
the landings, as well as consider
able plaster damage throughout
Mirrielees. The dorm reopened,
however, just after 11:30 p.m.
Other reports show the damage
was distributed throughout the
campus:
• A broken gas line in the
McCullough building was leaking
argon, a gas found in the atmos
phere, but the leak presented no
danger, according to Ken Williams
of the McCullough emergency re
sponse team.
"All compressed gases are dan

gerous, but argon is probably the
least dangerous," Williams said,
adding that the amount of gas
leaking out was too small to pose
a threat.
• Some pieces of artwork in the
Stanford Art Museum suffered
major damage from the quake.
Many ceramics that were part
of a special exhibition of Jose Ver
meersch sculptures were smashed
to dust, Museum Director Wanda
Corn said. The whole lobby and
several upstairs galleries were
also cracked.
Corn said the museum will be
closed indefinitely.
• At 553 Mayfield, one minor
injury was reported when sopho
more John Abbot suffered lacera
tions of both feet from broken
bottles. Resident Assistant Alan
Symonds reported no other inju
ries and only minor damage.
External structural damage —
a crack running vertically from a
first floor door to near a second
floor window — was also visible
on the side facing away from
Mayfield Drive.
• Stanford Shopping Center also
sustained damages. According to
Macy's employee Dan Hogue, an
'88 graduate, "a number of store
front windows were shattered."
Many displays in Macy's were
knocked down, as well as a num
ber of ceiling titles.
"Most merchants closed up shop
by 5:20," Hogue said. He added
that shoppers were not allowed
back into Macy's to retrieve their
belongings.
• In Terman Engineering Build
ing, the seismograph machine on
the second floor was still running,
but there was a wild scribbling
next to which someone had writ
ten 5:05 p.m. Oct. 16.

As this room in the American Studies House illustrates, students' rooms were left in chaos even in
those dorms that escaped structural damage.
Behind the Old Chemistry
building, Pratap Malik was warm

quake hit. The ground started to
shift. Malik opened his door and
dashed clear seconds before a
chimney collapsed, flattening his
automobile. Four hours later, the
lights on what was left of Malik's
car were still on.
In the southeast corner of the

thirds of the wall. These walls are
also cracked.
Trancos was inspected and
deemed safe, he said.
Some residences reported shifts
in house foundations, including
parts of the Suites complex.
Parts of the Suites have shifted
approximately one-fourth of an
inch off their foundation, accord
ing to Suites facilities supervisor
Barry Reuter.
A natural gas leak was reported
on the second or third floor of
Mirrielees immediately after the
earthquake struck, forcing resi
dents to remain outside the build
ing for over half an hour.
Resident assistant Suzanna
Mak notified the Palo Alto Fire
Department, which sent personnel
to the scene to shut oft the gas.
According to Mak, Escondido Vil
lage maintenance will be able to
assess and fix the gas leak Wed
nesday.
Senior Beth Hollenberg was
putting on her socks when the
first waves of yesterday's earth
quake rocked Mirrielees, where
she is a resident assistant.
"Everything started rumbling and
swaying. Lamps fell down . . . and
our rice cakes flew out from the
cupboard."
Investigating engineers found
damage to the first-floor founda
tion of Mirrielees. "You could feel
the ridges (of the broken founda
tion) through the carpets," Hol
lenberg said.
Investigators found cracks in
the landings, as well as consider
able plaster damage throughout
Mirrielees. The dorm reopened,
however, just after 11:30 p.m.
Other reports show the damage
was distributed throughout the
campus:
• A broken gas line in the
McCullough building was leaking
argon, a gas found in the atmos
phere, but the leak presented no
danger, according to Ken Williams
of the McCullough emergency re
sponse team.
"All compressed gases are dan

gerous, but argon is probably the
least dangerous," Williams said,
adding that the amount of gas
leaking out was too small to pose
a threat.
• Some pieces of artwork in the
Stanford Art Museum suffered
major damage from the quake.
Many ceramics that were part
of a special exhibition of Jose Ver
meersch sculptures were smashed
to dust, Museum Director Wanda
Corn said. The whole lobby and
several upstairs galleries were
also cracked.
Corn said the museum will be
closed indefinitely.
• At 553 Mayfield, one minor
injury was reported when sopho
more John Abbot suffered lacera
tions of both feet from broken
bottles. Resident Assistant Alan
Symonds reported no other inju
ries and only minor damage.
External structural damage —
a crack running vertically from a
first floor door to near a second
floor window — was also visible
on the side facing away from
Mayfield Drive.
• Stanford Shopping Center also
sustained damages. According to
Macy's employee Dan Hogue, an
'88 graduate, "a number of store
front windows were shattered."
Many displays in Macy's were
knocked down, as well as a num
ber of ceiling titles.
"Most merchants closed up shop
by 5:20," Hogue said. He added
that shoppers were not allowed
back into Macy's to retrieve their
belongings.
• In Terman Engineering Build
ing, the seismograph machine on
the second floor was still running,
but there was a wild scribbling
next to which someone had writ
ten 5:05 p.m. Oct. 16.

As this room in the American Studies House illustrates, students' rooms were left in chaos even in
those dorms that escaped structural damage.
