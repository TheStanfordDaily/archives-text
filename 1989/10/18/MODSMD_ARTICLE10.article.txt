## Female doctor to succeed Koop 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — Hispanic
pediatrician Antonia Novello, described
as "a ball of energy," is in line to become
the next surgeon general and the first
woman to hold the post, according to
administration sources.
Novello, deputy director of the Na
tional Institute of Child Health and
Human Development, is undergoing
routine background checks before her
formal nomination by President Bush,
said the sources, who spoke yesterday
on condition of anonymity.
If nominated by Bush and confirmed
by the Senate, she would succeed C.
Everett Koop, the outspoken pediatric
surgeon who stepped down last month
after serving as surgeon general for
seven years.
Novello's office said she had no com
ment.
Novello, 45, is a native of Puerto Rico.
She graduated from the University of
Puerto Rico and in 1970 from the uni
versity's medical school in the top 5
percent of her class. She is a pediatric
kidney specialist.

She joined the National Institute of
Child Health and Human Development
in April 1986, where she is deputy di
rector as well as coordinator for AIDS
research. She also is a clinical professor
of pediatrics at Georgetown University
and a commissioned officer in the Public
Health Service.
Novello is married to psychiatrist Dr.
Joe Novello, who hosted a talk show on
a Washington radio station and whose
brother is Don Novello, the comedian
better known as "Father Guido Sarduc
• M
CI.
She was recommended to the White
House by Louis Sullivan, secretary of
the Department of Health and Human
Services, the sources said. Her nomina
tion was also pushed by Sen. Orrin
Hatch, R-Utah, for whom she worked
in 1982-83 when he was chairman of
the Senate Labor and Human Resources
Committee.
Paul Smith, a spokesman for Hatch,
said he remembered Novello as "a ball
of energy. She's got a lot of vitality. She
was enthusiastic about everything she

did. We think she'll be a good spokesman
for health issues."
Novello also was among a number of
women recommended for the job by
Bush's personal physician, Burton J.
Lee 111, who said she "would be terrific"
as surgeon general.
Novello apparently has satisfied the
White House that her views on abortion
are acceptable to the president. Bush
says he opposes abortion except in cases
of rape, incest and danger to the moth
er's life.
Chase Untermeyer, Bush's personnel
chief, said yesterday that the White
House has been asking candidates rec
ommended for jobs where abortion is
an issue about their views on the sub
ject. Those questions were asked of can
didates for surgeon general, he said, but
he would not comment on Novello and
refused to confirm or deny that she is
Bush's choice.
Lee said yesterday he would like to
be surgeon general but was out of the
running because he disagrees with the
president on abortion.
