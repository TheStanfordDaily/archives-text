# Soviet human rights record improves
## 
### 
LONDON (AP) — Human rights
abuses in the Soviet Union have
declined dramatically, but people still
are persecuted for their political and
religious beliefs, Amnesty International
said in a report yesterday.
The human rights group said its list
of Soviet citizens in prison for non
violent exercise of their human rights
shrank from 600 three years ago to
about 90 in July, and the number would
have been lower but for further arrests.
But "despite this clear trend toward
reform, the human rights picture in the
U.S.S.R. is deeply confusing," the report
said. For example, Amnesty said, new
decrees have been issued that restrict
political activity.
An Amnesty delegation was allowed
into the Soviet Union for the first time
in March and found that "the Soviet
perspective on human rights has shifted
dramatically since 1986," the report
said.
"The most promising prospect for
long-term reform is a review of
law . . . apparently aimed at bringing So
viet law into line with international
standards," it said.

For the first time, the report said,
Soviet authorities are freely discussing
human rights issues and acknowledging
them to be an international issue; not
merely a domestic matter.
The Soviet Union hopes to hold the
Helsinki Conference on Human Rights
in Moscow in 1991.
Amnesty said that of the 600 prison
ers of conscience held three years ago,
337 were released early and another 79
were freed from psychiatric hospitals,
where some had spent 15 years or more
against their will.
"Most of these 416 people were
prosecuted for expressing non
conformist opinions or for their reli
gious activities. Some had been arrested
for trying to leave the U.5.5.R.," it said.
"They make up the largest single
group of prisoners of conscience to have
been freed since the 19505. Political ar
rests have also fallen noticeably since
1986," it said.
Despite the change in attitude toward
human rights, Amnesty said it was con
cerned about what it called new moves
to curb political activity. It cited a ruling

in April that effectively bans elec
tioneering for radical change, and an
other in July restricting rights of as
sembly.
A new centrally-controlled police force
with extensive powers was set up in
July 1988 under a decree that gives the
authorities "unrestrained powers to ban
or break up peaceful assemblies," the
report said. "On more than one occasion
since July 1988 they have been used
for this purpose."
The law on public gatherings is avail
able in writing, and decisions on appli
cations for public meetings have to be
given five days in advance. Rut author
ities may ban meetings as unconstitu
tional even where they pose no threat
to public order, and there is no right
of appeal, Amnesty said.
There also had been new arrests, so
that when the Amnesty delegation
visited Moscow, it had a list of 100
detainees, including 25 conscientious ob
jectors to military service, 25 people in
psychiatric institutions and about 30
imprisoned for non-violent nationalist
activity, the report said.
