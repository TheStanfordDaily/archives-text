# U.S.-South Korean leaders meet

Washington (AP) â€” President Bush and
South Korean President Roh Tae Woo met
yesterday, with both leaders determined to
resist pressure for significant cutbacks in
the U.S. military prescence in South Korea.
The two exchanged views at an Oval
Office session also attended by Secretary
of State James A. Raker 111 and Defense
Secretary Dick Cheney.
Talk of a reduced U.S. military deploy
ment has become more commonplace as
South Korea becomes more prosperous and
the Soviet Union appears to be a less
menacing adversary than it was before.
Moscow has close links to Seoul's arch rival,
North Korea.
Roh said before leaving South Korea that
he saw little possibility of any significant
change in the "general level" of U.S. forces
in South Korea, which have numbered
about 40,000 for many years.

Rut he said South Korea will increase
its share of the cost of stationing
forces in his country.
Meanwhile, a senior U.S. official, briefing
reporters Monday, said maintenance of the
U.S. deterrent in South Korea is a high
priority for both countries.
Still, the official, asking not to be iden
tified, said "minor reductions" are possible
in the future as South Korea assumes a
larger role in its own defense.
After late-morning talks in the White
House Oval Office, Rush conducted a work
ing meeting with his guest.
The U.S. Ambassador to Japan, Michael
Armacost, appeared to be laying the
groundwork for an eventual U.S. troop re
duction when he said last week there will
come a time "when it is appropriate to
adjust the size" of U.S. forces in South
Korea.
