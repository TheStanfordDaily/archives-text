## Don't quake 
### 
In the aftermath of
the big quake, we must
continue with caution

IT WAS BIG. Real big. Yester
day's earthquake registered 7.0
on the Richter scale.
From the moment freshmen first
set foot on the Farm, they are
bombarded with information on
how to respond to an earthquake.
But if yesterday is any indica
tion, Stanford students have not
heeded the advice of the countless
pamphlets and fliers.
Most people panicked and ran
out of buildings.
While panic is understandable,
it is important to use your head
in such an emergency. Provost
James Rosse reported last night
that there were no deaths or
serious injuries as a result of the
quake, but massive panic and
stampedes toward the nearest exit
could lead to plenty of casualties.
Several smaller aftershocks oc
curred immediately following the
quake yesterday and throughout
the evening. Another could strike
again today.
If an aftershock does occur and
you are inside, stay there. Duck
under a table or desk or stand in
a doorway and get away from win
dows. If you're outside, go imme
diately to an open space.
The magnitude of yesterday's
earthquake is the same as the
quake which caused a major dis
aster in Armenia last December.
Luckily, Stanford is prepared for
just such a disaster, and the
campus appears to have come
through the quake with no major
damage.

Building on the lesson of the
extensive campus damage caused
by the 1906 San Francisco earth
quake, campus buildings have
either been originally designed or
renovated to withstand major
earthquakes â€” including Roble
Hall, which probably would not
have fared too well had the quake
happened two years ago.
Still, many buildings, including
Hoover Tower, were cracked and
student residences above two
stories were evacuated last night.
Today the University will survey
the campus to ascertain the extent
of the damage and conduct a major
clean-up operation. Volunteers are
needed to assist in clean-up.
While class is canceled today, it
is not advisable to try to travel
anywhere, especially the beach.
The Pacific Bell survival guide in
your phone bode advises people to
"not go sightseeing after (a quake)
especially in beach and waterfront
areas where seismic waves could
strike."
In fact, do not try to drive
anywhere, as many highways and
bridges are closed.
People are advised to be extra
safety-conscious for at least the
next 24 hours.
University water is safe to drink,
but it is very important to conserve
water as Stanford has a limited
supply. Use your telephone only if
absolutely necessary, wear shoes to
avoid stepping on broken glass or
other objects, and check your room
or home for any damage.
In addition, the University ad
vises people to stay out of buildings
in the Quad and all academic build
ings in general.
Most of all, use common sense
and remember the classic elemen
tary school earthquake drill: Duck
and Cover.
