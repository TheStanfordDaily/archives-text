## Leftist stereotypes abound

lowa women are almost always sensa
tionally overweight — you see them at

WELL. CONSIDERING that I am
a woman, and from lowa, and
an occasional Saturday morning
visitor to Merle Hay Mall, you can imag
ine my reaction to this quote from"The
Lost Continent," a book by Bill Bryson.
I guess I should be used to degrading
remarks about lowa by now. My dorm
mates last year loved to torment me about
hailing from the heartland. They called
me Corn Girl, asked me if I had indoor
plumbing, and wondered what time I had
to get up in the morning to milk the cows.
My resident assistant actually believed
me when I said I kept pigs in the house.
All this despite the fjact tnat I live in the
bustling, metropolitan city of Des Moines.
Practically everyone at Stanford is
guilty of subscribing to a few stereotypes.
Whether they are about various Greek
organizations, athletes or graduate stu
dents, misperceptions about different
people and their activities abound.
One of the most popular and publicized
preconceptions recently has been The
Leftist. If we are to believe The Stanford
Review and assorted letters to the editor,
radical left wingers are everywhere.
They've trashed Western Culture,
they're stifling academic discussion, and
according to a recent Review editorial,
they were even behind the suspension of
the Phi Delt fraternity.

It's awful — not the idea of a crazed
mob of politically correct students patroll
ing the campus and beating any conser
vatives they find with a protest sign.
What disgusts me is the way the leftist
label is being applied to student of color
organizations, the Agenda for Action, the
People's Platform, the Council of Presi
dents and many senators in the ASSU.
The motivation behind this labeling is
not to describe these groups' politics as
to the left of center on the political spec
trum. The purpose is to assign the con
notations of the term to the group. Radi
cal leftists sound like a violent, irrational
mob completely out of touch with the
political and social views of the majority
of students on campus.
And although there are people at Stan
ford who would like you to think these
groups are uncontrollable and illogical,
they are not. They are vocal. They are
organized. They do have definite objec
tives. But they are not crazy.
When the Agenda for Action took over
University President Donald Kennedy's
office, some people took it as a concrete
example that the group was out of con
trol. Instead of asking if the student de
mands were worthwhile or if the students
had already tried other means to achieve
change, many people dismissed the entire
event. Their preconceptions about the
groups involved limited their response to
the act.
A similar thing is happening this year.
Ever since Kennedy warned freshmen to
look at various ideas and agendas
mistrustfully, the student activist groups
on campus have been typecast as bullying
thought police, ramming their brand of

politics down the campus' unwilling
throat.
Even though the People's Platform
senators and COP won handily in ASSU
elections, they are constantly being pre
sented as if they are on the fringe of the
political climate at Stanford.
Louis Jackson is suffering from a
similar problem. He is involved in so
called leftist organizations such as the
BSU and the ASSU, so some students
automatically dismiss his complaints
about his treatment as unfounded. They
refuse to consider the facts of Jackson's
arrest or prosecution because in their
minds he's just another wild leftist.
The labeling of activist groups in an
attempt to discredit their work is detri
mental to all students at Stanford because
it limits their opportunity to understand
these groups and their goals.
I must admit, however, that although
most stereotypes are hopelessly inac
curate generalizations, there is one that
is fundamentally true. Jack Kerouac ob
served in his classic book, "On the Road,"
that the women in Des Moines were the
most beautiful he had seen anywhere. I
can't argue with that one.

tives. But they are not crazy.
When the Agenda for Action took over
University President Donald Kennedy's
office, some people took it as a concrete
example that the group was out of con
trol. Instead of asking if the student de
mands were worthwhile or if the students
had already tried other means to achieve
change, many people dismissed the entire
event. Their preconceptions about the
groups involved limited their response to
the act.
A similar thing is happening this year.
Ever since Kennedy warned freshmen to
look at various ideas and agendas
mistrustfully, the student activist groups
on campus have been typecast as bullying
thought police, ramming their brand of

politics down the campus' unwilling
throat.
Even though the People's Platform
senators and COP won handily in ASSU
elections, they are constantly being pre
sented as if they are on the fringe of the
political climate at Stanford.
Louis Jackson is suffering from a
similar problem. He is involved in so
called leftist organizations such as the
BSU and the ASSU, so some students
automatically dismiss his complaints
about his treatment as unfounded. They
refuse to consider the facts of Jackson's
arrest or prosecution because in their
minds he's just another wild leftist.
The labeling of activist groups in an
attempt to discredit their work is detri
mental to all students at Stanford because
it limits their opportunity to understand
these groups and their goals.
I must admit, however, that although
most stereotypes are hopelessly inac
curate generalizations, there is one that
is fundamentally true. Jack Kerouac ob
served in his classic book, "On the Road,"
that the women in Des Moines were the
most beautiful he had seen anywhere. I
can't argue with that one.
