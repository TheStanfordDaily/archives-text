## Cowell is still offering best health care for students 
### 
WE WOULD LIKE to respond to
the article that appeared in
The Daily on Monday, Oct. 16
about Cowell Student Health Center's
coverage of emergency visits.
When a student requires immediate
care, the student should still call
Cowell (including nights and weekends)
to ascertain whether the problem may
be handled at Cowell at no charge to
the student. If specialty care is re
quired, it, for the most part, will also
be provided through the Palo Alto
Medical Clinic at no charge to the
student.
If a decision is made that an emer
gency room is the more appropriate
treatment location, then that visit will

be billed to the student's health insur
ance.
These changes were precipitated by
Cowell's being asked to pay for emer
gency room visits, often for situations
that could easily have been handled by
Cowell physicians at the health center.
There has also been an overuse of the
Emergency Room by some students for
conditions that were not emergencies.
Since the advent of mandatory insur
ance, all students have some coverage
of emergency room visits. For those
students on the Stanford plan, this
coverage has a $200 deductible and a
copayment. The thousands of dollars
saved by shifting these costs to health
insurance can be used to develop other
services for Stanford students.

We are committed to providing the
best care for the student. This new
procedure does not in any way change
the nature of the care that we offer. It
does offer us the possibility of expand
ing the services available.
Lastly, it should be noted that the
health insurance premiums do not
change every quarter. The last signifi
cant change occured in 1988 when we
negotiated a three year contract which
limits premium rises to 15 percent.
This is significantly lower than the
annual increases in health care and
the comparable increases in the
premiums offered by other plans.
Coverage has been modified, but last
year increased coverage included out-

patient treatment for substance and
alcohol abuse and coverage for some
varsity sports. No health benefits were
cut.
Each year we examine utilization of
coverage, the health needs of the
student population and the costs. The
process takes several months, and
attempts are made to provide an insur
ance package that meets the unique
needs of the student population at
minimal cost to them.
We would be very happy to discuss
these decisions with concerned stu
dents.
