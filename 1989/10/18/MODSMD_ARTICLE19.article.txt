# University has to give subpoenaed evidence to court
## 
### 
Last Friday's Daily reported that
Louis Jackson's attorney "had limited
success in gaining access to subpoenaed
documents and photographs" which the
attorney asserts to be critical to Jack
son's defense.
The story then goes on to report
that Stanford attorney Jennifer Wester
lind delivered to the court "a sealed
package containing materials from
Stanford's internal investigation."
What's going on here? Why didn't
Stanford just hand over its sealed
package to Jackson or to his attorney?
The answer is that Stanford was
legally obligated by the subpoena itself
to deliver specified material to the
court — not to the defendant.
The court then reviews the material

and makes relevant material available
to the defendant's attorney and the
District Attorney. Stanford had no say
whatsoever on what to include — we
must and did supply all the responsive
material requested by the subpoena —
nor does Stanford have any say what
soever on what material the court
turns over to the defense. This sub
poena was drawn up by Joseph Bil
lingsley, Jackson's attorney, and was
issued under the authority of the
court.
Parties involved in legal proceedings
usually subpoena material rather than
simply request it informally so that all
parties understand the rules for han
dling the material.
It should be noted that Stanford has
never denied any formal or informal
request by Jackson or his attorney for
documents, photographs or videotapes
they believe pertinent to this defense.
Let me also repeat that Stanford has
not and is not pressing charges against
Jackson. Jackson is charged by the
District Attorney of Santa Clara

County based on the district attorney's
assessment of evidence presented by
law enforcement officers and such in
vestigation as he has conducted.
Stanford has a written, clearly stated
policy on arrests and prosecutions,
which was most recently published in
Campus Report on Oct. 11. Stanford is
not selectively applying this policy to
Jackson's case; rather, Stanford is con
tinuing its undeviating application of
this policy as it has since the policy
was first promulgated in the early
19705.
