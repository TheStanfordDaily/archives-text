# Classes called off, students displaced

### 
Classes and all unnecessary
university business is cancelled
today, Provost James Rosse said
last night.
"Everyone should be cautious
for 24 hours due to danger of
aftershocks further damaging al
ready damaged buildings," Rosse
added.
Student housing, Food Service,
Operations and Maintenance,
Public Safety, and Health and
Safety personnel should report as
usual today, Rosse said, adding
that "normal University busi
ness" is expected to resume to
morrow.
Rosse warned faculty, staff and
students to stay out of academic
buildings that have not been cer
tified as safe.
Inspection of buildings began
last night and will continue into
this morning.
The Geology corner, Engineer
ing corner, Career Planning and
Placement Center, Memorial
Church, Terman Engineering
building and Encina Hall were
taped off last night and should
not be entered without further
notice. Rosse advised that people
not enter any buildings on the
Quad today.
Residences were evacuated as
well, pending damage investiga
tions.

At first, all buildings three
stories and higher were
evacuated.
Most, however, reopened later
last night.
Toyon and Roble Halls were
deemed safe by investigators.
Florence Moore, Wilbur, Stern,
Mirrelees, Crothers and Crothers
Memorial Halls closed and were
reopened.
Likewise, fraternities bordering
Lake Lagunita, Cowell Cluster
houses and Governor's Corner re
mained open to residents, with the
exception of Griffin in the Suites.
Griffin is closed until further
notice because it slipped from its
foundation during the quake.
Houses in Sterling Quad re
mained open, although residents
in the third and fourth floors were
asked to sleep in the lounges, or
in rooms of friends on the lower
floors.
In Escondido Village, only
Blackwelder and Quillen re
mained open through the night.
McFarland, another Escondido
Village residence, reopened after
it was initially closed. It was later
re-evacuated because of reports of
asbestos dust circulating in the
air.
Most Row Houses and Branner
Hall were evacuated until further
notice.
