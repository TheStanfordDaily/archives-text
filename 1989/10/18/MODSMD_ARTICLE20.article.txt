# Alumna shocked at lack of student support for Jackson
## 
### 
I did not attend the vigil last Wed
nesday night. But I was horrified to
learn, when my husband returned from

this event, that there had not been a
thousand people there â€” closer to a
hundred.
I am chilled when I think about why
more students did not come out in
support of Jackson.
Do they not think that he may go to
jail? Do they not care if he does? Do
they fail to imagine what jail would be
like for their fellow student? Do they
think he deserves jail for his participa
tion, along with many others, in a
nonviolent demonstration?
When I was an undergraduate here
in the 19605, I was somewhat marginal
because I was female. There was still a
quota for women students, and I spent
four years here without a single
woman teacher.
Thank goodness a lot has changed
here for women students, but here is
one woman who is appreciative of
Jackson's efforts on behalf of black
students and who will be outraged if
he lands in jail.
