## Questioning constitutionality of police video cameras as weapons 
### 
WHETHER ONE DEEMS Louis
Jackson a victim of discrimina
tion or a martyr for his role in
last year's student takeover of Univer
sity President Donald Kennedy's office,
there are two issues that have not
been addressed and ought to be looked
at closely.
The first asks the question: "Does
Stanford University take care of its
own?" The second asks whether Stan
ford is unwittingly embroiled in a
constitutional dilemma.
If, as the administration of this
university is quick to claim, Stanford
is the Harvard of the West, linking it
to the Ivy League and its code of
excellence, these same administrators
must measure up to their claims and

adapt the unwritten code of honor that
the Ivy League practices: noblesse
oblige.
This translates to "taking care of its
own." This code is not so peculiar to
the Ivy League; in fact, it is clearly
seen at the highest levels of our coun
try, in all circles where one of "its
own" has strayed.
The Kennedys and the Schwartzes of
this university ought to know that,
since their laat names would suggest
that their ancestors didn't exactly
come here on the Mayflower but had
to work their way into that exclusive
club which founded and perpetuated
the Ivy League and its idea of brother
hood.
Beyond all the issues already in

discussion looms the question of the
constitutionality of the use of the video
camera by the police to gather evidence
during demonstrations of an individ
ual's or group's expression of his, her
or its First Amendment rights.
Certainly, when it has been used in
FBI stings, the courts have had a role
in granting permission for its use. Did
the police take the necessary steps to
insure that the rights of everyone
involved were protected when it shot
the crowd with its powerful new
weapon?
If it did not, the obvious needs to be
emphatically brought to the surface.
Why not? And does this qualify the
videotape which implicates Jackson as
an inadmissable piece of evidence?

Indeed, the right to express oneself
freely in a public forum while main
taining one's right to privacy is the
real issue here. Once the fate of the
sacrificial victim in this case is decided,
the question of whether the video
camera is "an impartial witness" will
remain open.
As weapons go, the television camera
and editing equipment are not unlike
guns, and like them, they are subject
to misuse. The adage that "guns don't
kill people; people do" holds true here
as well.
In this sense, a closer lode into the
use of television equipment by the
police during demonstrations of private
citizens needs to be challenged and
examined from a constitutional point of

view.
It is, after all, our sense of protec
tion by the Constitution that binds us
all and defines for us our freedom to
think and express ourselves openly.
Stanford University, as one of the
purveyors of cultural, ethical and legal
leadership in our country, is morally
bound to its constituency in brother
hood, and, in the spirit of the Consti
tution, it must be also be bound to
that same constituency against the
encroachment of "big brother's" watch
ful eye.
