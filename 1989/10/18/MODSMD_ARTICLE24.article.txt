## Z studies are a boon for anxious particle physics theorists SLAC wraps up a few key unanswered questions in physics 
### Dan Cory 
Results announced Thursday
by the Stanford Linear Ac
celerator Center put the finishing
touches on the theory that ex
plains most of particle physics.
The theory, known as the
Standard Model, classifies the
myriad of elementary particles
found in the universe into at least
three families. The most recent
research on the Z particle at SLAC
and CERN, the European Labo
ratory for Particle Physics,
verifies that these three families
are all that can exist.
Cosmologists know that huge
numbers of particles from all
families were formed in a tiny
fraction of a second after the Big
Bang. The formation of these par
ticles affected the shape of the
universe as is seen today. By
studying helium in the modern
universe, cosmologists estimate
either three or four families of
fundamental particles exist.
The Standard Model was
created in the late 1970s to unify
the fundamental forces of matter.
The first forces to be unified were
electricity and magnetism. For ex
ample, if wire is wrapped around
a bar of iron and electricity is
sent through the wire, the iron
bar will create a magnetic field.
The Standard Model explains a
similar connection between the
electromagnetic and weak forces.
The Standard Model, graced by
the exotic language of particle
physicists, explains that most par
ticles are made up of quarks. Two
quarks, up and down, combine to
form the protons and the
neutrons found in the nucleus of
an atom. The other four types —
strange, charm, bottom and the
still undiscovered top quark —
make up other particles found
only in colliders. Each quark also
comes in a color — red, blue or
green — that is affected by the
strong force, the force that binds
the nucleus together.
The Standard Model also im
plies another group of particles
called leptons, which literally
means small particles. Two lep
tons, the electron and neutrino,
are found everywhere in the uni

verse. The electron is found in
atoms, and the elusive and virtu
ally unstoppable neutrino zips
through the universe.
The other four leptons, the
muon and mu-neutrino, and tau
and tau-neutrino, exist only in col
liders. This third family of leptons
was discovered at SLAC by Martin
Perl over a decade ago.
Each of the leptons and quarks
has an associated anti-particle,
which behaves oppositely from its
counterpart. For example, if a par
ticle curves right in an electric
field, its anti-particle will curve
left in the same field.
The final feature of the Stand
ard Model is a set of particles
known as bosons. The bosons are
exchanged when a force acts on
particles. The electromagnetic
force is carried by the photon,
which can also be understood as
a particle of light. The weak force
is carried by the W-plus, W-minus
and Z particles.
The Standard Model also in
cludes an explanation of the
strong force, the force that binds
together protons and neutrons in
a nucleus and quarks in a proton.
The Standard Model is unable to
explain, however, how exactly the
strong force relates to the elec
tromagnetic and weak force. Also,
the Standard Model has no expla
nation for gravity, the least un
derstood, and yet the most
commonly observed, of all forces.
The Standard Model classifies
the quarks and leptons into three
families but does not prove that
there cannot be four or five
families. SLAC has now shown
that exactly three families exist.
In both the Stanford and CERN
experiments, an electron and an
anti-electron or positron, are
slammed together at nearly the
speed of light. When the particles
annihilate each other, their mass
is transformed into energy, ac
cording to Einstein's well-known
formula, E = mc*. If the energy of
the collision plus the energy from
the particles is close to 91.1 mil
lion electron volts or MeV, then
a Z particle can be formed.
A tiny fraction of a second later,
the Z particle decays into a quark
and an anti-quark or a lepton and

an anti-lepton.
The more ways the Z particle
can decay, the shorter its average
lifetime. For example, imagine a
bucket of water. The more holes
punched in the bottom of the
bucket, the faster the water runs
out. Each family of particles is
like another set of holes in the
bucket.
The lifetime of the Z particle,

more accurately known as the Z
zero to signify its neutral charge,
is measured by smashing the elec
trons together at a little less or
a little more than 91.1 MeV. Ac
cording to Heisenberg's Uncer
tainty Principle, a little bit of
energy can appear from nothing
to form the 91.1 MeV required
for a Z particle.
This energy, the uncertainty

principle guarantees, can only ex
ist for a small amount of time
before it must disappear again.
The lifetime of the created Z par
ticle, thought to be about one
trillionth of one-trillionth of a
second, must be less than the time
dictated by the uncertainty prin
ciple.
The SLAC and CERN results
prove that the lifetime is close to

that expected for a universe with
only three families of fundamental
particles. CERN will continue to
study the Z particle intensively,
while SLAC plans to devote more
time to other experiments along
with the Z particle research.
Michael Riordan, spokesperson
for SLAC, said that SLAC re
searchers looked forward to more
accurate results from CERN.


The $115 million Stanford Linear Collider was an innovative design guaranteed to cause difficulties. Even still, It managed to yield toy
data on the Z particle, which lives for only one-trllllonth of one-trllllonth of a second.

strong force relates to the elec
tromagnetic and weak force. Also,
the Standard Model has no expla
nation for gravity, the least un
derstood, and yet the most
commonly observed, of all forces.
The Standard Model classifies
the quarks and leptons into three
families but does not prove that
there cannot be four or five
families. SLAC has now shown
that exactly three families exist.
In both the Stanford and CERN
experiments, an electron and an
anti-electron or positron, are
slammed together at nearly the
speed of light. When the particles
annihilate each other, their mass
is transformed into energy, ac
cording to Einstein's well-known
formula, E = mc*. If the energy of
the collision plus the energy from
the particles is close to 91.1 mil
lion electron volts or MeV, then
a Z particle can be formed.
A tiny fraction of a second later,
the Z particle decays into a quark
and an anti-quark or a lepton and

an anti-lepton.
The more ways the Z particle
can decay, the shorter its average
lifetime. For example, imagine a
bucket of water. The more holes
punched in the bottom of the
bucket, the faster the water runs
out. Each family of particles is
like another set of holes in the
bucket.
The lifetime of the Z particle,

more accurately known as the Z
zero to signify its neutral charge,
is measured by smashing the elec
trons together at a little less or
a little more than 91.1 MeV. Ac
cording to Heisenberg's Uncer
tainty Principle, a little bit of
energy can appear from nothing
to form the 91.1 MeV required
for a Z particle.
This energy, the uncertainty

principle guarantees, can only ex
ist for a small amount of time
before it must disappear again.
The lifetime of the created Z par
ticle, thought to be about one
trillionth of one-trillionth of a
second, must be less than the time
dictated by the uncertainty prin
ciple.
The SLAC and CERN results
prove that the lifetime is close to

that expected for a universe with
only three families of fundamental
particles. CERN will continue to
study the Z particle intensively,
while SLAC plans to devote more
time to other experiments along
with the Z particle research.
Michael Riordan, spokesperson
for SLAC, said that SLAC re
searchers looked forward to more
accurate results from CERN.


The $115 million Stanford Linear Collider was an innovative design guaranteed to cause difficulties. Even still, It managed to yield toy
data on the Z particle, which lives for only one-trllllonth of one-trllllonth of a second.
Results announced Thursday
by the Stanford Linear Ac
celerator Center put the finishing
touches on the theory that ex
plains most of particle physics.
The theory, known as the
Standard Model, classifies the
myriad of elementary particles
found in the universe into at least
three families. The most recent
research on the Z particle at SLAC
and CERN, the European Labo
ratory for Particle Physics,
verifies that these three families
are all that can exist.
Cosmologists know that huge
numbers of particles from all
families were formed in a tiny
fraction of a second after the Big
Bang. The formation of these par
ticles affected the shape of the
universe as is seen today. By
studying helium in the modern
universe, cosmologists estimate
either three or four families of
fundamental particles exist.
The Standard Model was
created in the late 1970s to unify
the fundamental forces of matter.
The first forces to be unified were
electricity and magnetism. For ex
ample, if wire is wrapped around
a bar of iron and electricity is
sent through the wire, the iron
bar will create a magnetic field.
The Standard Model explains a
similar connection between the
electromagnetic and weak forces.
The Standard Model, graced by
the exotic language of particle
physicists, explains that most par
ticles are made up of quarks. Two
quarks, up and down, combine to
form the protons and the
neutrons found in the nucleus of
an atom. The other four types —
strange, charm, bottom and the
still undiscovered top quark —
make up other particles found
only in colliders. Each quark also
comes in a color — red, blue or
green — that is affected by the
strong force, the force that binds
the nucleus together.
The Standard Model also im
plies another group of particles
called leptons, which literally
means small particles. Two lep
tons, the electron and neutrino,
are found everywhere in the uni

verse. The electron is found in
atoms, and the elusive and virtu
ally unstoppable neutrino zips
through the universe.
The other four leptons, the
muon and mu-neutrino, and tau
and tau-neutrino, exist only in col
liders. This third family of leptons
was discovered at SLAC by Martin
Perl over a decade ago.
Each of the leptons and quarks
has an associated anti-particle,
which behaves oppositely from its
counterpart. For example, if a par
ticle curves right in an electric
field, its anti-particle will curve
left in the same field.
The final feature of the Stand
ard Model is a set of particles
known as bosons. The bosons are
exchanged when a force acts on
particles. The electromagnetic
force is carried by the photon,
which can also be understood as
a particle of light. The weak force
is carried by the W-plus, W-minus
and Z particles.
The Standard Model also in
cludes an explanation of the
strong force, the force that binds
together protons and neutrons in
a nucleus and quarks in a proton.
The Standard Model is unable to
explain, however, how exactly the
strong force relates to the elec
tromagnetic and weak force. Also,
the Standard Model has no expla
nation for gravity, the least un
derstood, and yet the most
