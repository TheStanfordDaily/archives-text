Biotech founder wins national prize
Genetics Prof. Stanley Cohen, whose work in 1973 provided
the underpinnings of the entire biotechnology industry, has won
the prestigious National Biotechnology Award.
Cohen will share the prize with Herbert Boyer, professor of
biotechnology at UC-San Francisco.
In 1973, the two scientists independently discovered that the
genetic material of different cells could be recombined in new
ways. The discovery of recombinant DNA was immediately useful
in turning bacteria into factories capable of producing desired
chemicals in mass quantities.
The discovery gave rise to much of the $1.7 billion biotech
nology industry.
The award, which is not the first such big prize for the
dynamic duo, includes a 1.5 ounce gold medallion, a commemora
tive citation and an undisclosed cash award.
Stanford's first Nobel laureate honored
Stanford's first Nobel laureate, physicist Felix Bloch, will be
honored in a Stanford Centennial conference Oct. 27 and 28.
Bloch's pioneering work was on the theory of metals, nuclear
magnetic resonance and magnetism. Bloch, who spent 50 years
at Stanford and died in 1983, shared the Nobel Prize in Physics
for discovering the process of nuclear magnetic resonance that
has led to numerous applications in physics, chemistry and
medicine.
The physicist laid the cornerstone for the development of
semiconductors, which in turn led to the development of the
transistor, the integrated circuit and the personal computer.
More than a dozen scientists will speak at the conference on
subjects as diverse as neural networks, nuclear magnetic
resonance and modern magnets.
The conference will be held in Cubberley Auditorium. For
