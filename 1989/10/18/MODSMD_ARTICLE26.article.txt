# Quaking thunder baffles even the best

Q # I got bored today while sit
• ting in front of a computer
screen here at Meyer. So to occupy
my time, I decided to take my
heart rate. When I did so, I was
shocked.
I counted my pulse for one min
ute in 30-second intervals. For the
first 30 seconds, my heart beat 18
times, and for the next 30 seconds,
it beat 19 times. I did it again to
make sure, and this time the
results were exactly the same —
37 beats per minute.
I'm no athelete. I run the dish
six days per week — but at my
own comfortable pace. I'm 22, I'm
male, and there is no history of
heart problems in my family.
Tell me, Science Bug, is my
heart rate normal, or am I some
strange castoff form a previous
evolutionary period?
A. No on one, yes on two.
• Either that or you need a
new watch.
I spoke with a nurse in the Car
diology Department at the Medical
Center. She was reluctant to have
her name associated with your
case, but she did give me a little
information.
For humans, the normal rest
heartrate is between 60 and 100
beats per minute. Most students
and other reasonably active young
people have rest heart rates at
the low end of this range — be
tween 60 and 80 beats per minute.
Even full-time professional jocks
don't get their pulse rates down
much below 60 (and of course,

when they are exercising, their
rates are much higher).
My unnamed source did suggest
that, if you are sure that your
rest pulse is really 37 beats per
minute, you should see a nurse
or physician (in other words, go
to Cowell).
On the other hand, you could
be some kind of mutant slug. In
that case, you should avoid Cowell
— they'd be sure to give you a
handout on the common cold.
Q # Coming to Stanford as a
• freshman, I was always con
fused by the fact that, although

there can be lots of rain winter
quarter, there are never, ever,
thunderstorms.
I'm now beginning my fifth year
at Stanford, and I still haven't
seen lightning flashing over the
red-tiled roofs. For more reason
than one, Hoover Tower seems like
such a perfect lightning rod.
What's going on?
A. The first thing I found out
• when I started researching
your question is that Stanford has
no professors specializing in thun
derstorms — or in rain, snow,
cloudy days or tropical storms.
The closest I got was Civil En
gineering Prof. David Freyberg
who concisely explained, "There
are no thunderstorms because the
right atmospheric conditions
don't exist." Well, yeah.
However, Freyberg gave me the
name of a real live meteorology
professor at San Jose State, where
they have a whole department just
to talk about the weather.
According to San Jose State
Prof. Bob Bornstien, to have a
thunderstorm, there must be a
lot of rapidly rising warm moist
air. (I guess at Stanford the hot
air is either dry or just doesn't
move around very much.) As this
warm air rises, it cools down and
condenses into clouds of water
droplets. If the air is moving fast
enough, it can rise quite a distance
from the earth before it stops.
An interesting thing about
clouds is that the heavier droplets
at the bottom have a negative
electric charge and the lighter
droplets at the top have a positive
charge. Scientists disagree about

how the charges get separated this
way, but they do know that if
enough charge gets far enough
apart (i.e. when the cloud is really
tall), the built up energy dis
charges lightning.
But none of this ever happens
at Stanford. Our clouds are simply
too short. The famous San Fran
cisco fog barely gets off the
ground, and things aren't much
better down here on the Penin
sula.
Borstien has an explanation for
this, too. Summer thunderstorms,
he says, usually occur when the
ground soaks up enough sunlight
to heat the moist air close to the
earth. The higher air stays cold.
Since hot air rises and cold air
sinks, the situation is very unsta
ble and the air moves around very
quickly. This causes your classic
July-afternoon-in-Nebraska thun
dershower.
On the West Coast, however,
cool breezes from the cold ocean
keep the ground level air from
heating up. To put it simply, noth
ing happens.
Winter thunderstorms are a dif
ferent story. They are usually
caused by cold fronts, Borstien
says. The cold front runs into a
warm front, and the warm air is
forced up and over the cold. This
happens quickly, and once again,
tall clouds are created.
California doesn't get many cold
fronts, though. Most of the fronts
we get are a kind called "oc
cluded," which don't really have
the sharp boundaries causing
rapid air rise. This means we get
rain but no fancy light shows.
