# Deadly link between fat and disease

It is part of every cell in your
body. It is essential to life. Un
fortunately, it can also be deadly
Dietary fat has been linked to
both heart disease and cancer. Al
though the underlying mecha
nisms are still unclear, scientists
have established a strong relation
ship between dietary fat and dis
ease.
The American Heart Associa
tion daily fat intake goal to
prevent disease is a 30 percent of
total calories, well below the
American average of more than
40 percent.
Unfortunately, manufacturers
take advantage of consumers who
do know the truth about fat. They
advertise their foods as "no choles
terol" and "vegetable oil" to in
crease sales.
But scientists have found
evidence that in most cases die
tary cholesterol does not affect
blood cholesterol levels as much
as dietary fat does. This evidence

indicates that the amount of fat
in your diet matters more than
the amount of cholesterol in it.
The vegetable oil that manufac
turers love to advertise is also not
as great as consumers would hope.
Palm kernel oil and coconut oil
are extremely saturated fats even
though they are not animal fats.
The three most familiar fatty
acids to consumers are saturated,
polyunsaturated and monoun
saturated fatty acids.
Although the structural differ
ence between these fatty acids is
in the number of double bonds in
their backbone carbon chain,
these double bonds determine the

qualities of a food as well as your
risk of heart disease and cancer.
A saturated fatty acid has no
double bonds present in its carbon
chain. Saturated fat is the most
correlated to heart disease be
cause it raises serum cholesterol
levels, which are known to cause
hardening of the arteries and
heart disease.
Because of this evidence, con
sumers consider saturated fat the
"bad" fat. Unfortunately, avoiding
saturated fat does not take away
the health risks of fat.
Dietary fat is linked to cancer
as well as heart disease. There
fore, a substitution of un
saturated fat for saturated fat
may help protect you against
heart disease but not against can
cer. In fact, all fats are presently
correlated to increased risk of can
cer.
A type of fat of which most
people are unaware is found in
lots of packaged food — partially
hydrogenated fat. This is basically
a polyunsaturated fat that has hy

drogen added to its double bonds
to make it more saturated. These
fats are also linked to increases
in the risk of heart disease and
cancer.
Manufacturers employ this
process to make their fats last
longer and taste more saturated,
like butter. Although the fats can
still be called unsaturated by the
manufacturer, they are usually
saturated to a high percentage.
All of this information on fat
may sound scary — and it should.
People need to realize that there
is no "good" fat that can be con
sumed liberally. Dietary fat is ex
tremely important to moderate.
Whatever type of fat you choose
to consume is not as significant
as how much you consume.
Quantity of fat is definitely
more important that quality, es
pecially since there are still many
questions surrounding the role of
each type of fatty acid. Be aware
of advertising gimmicks and try
to eat low-fat foods.
