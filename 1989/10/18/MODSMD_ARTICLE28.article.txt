# Study: Support helps cancer's terminally ill
## 
### 
Terminally ill cancer patients
who participated in a support
group lived nearly twice as long
as similar patients who did not,
according to a 10-year study
conducted by Stanford psychi
atry researchers.
The study found that 50
women suffering from breast
cancer which had spread to
other parts of the body sur
vived an average of 36.6
months after starting weekly
90 minute support groups for
a year. A control group of 36
women receiving similar high
quality medical treatment but
no support group therapy sur
vived for only 18.9 months, said
David Spiegel, lead author of
the study published Saturday
in the British medical jounal,
Lancet.
The results may have broad
implications for treating other

cancers and other diseases such
as AIDS.
The authors of the study did
not attempt to discover why
the cancer patients lived longer,
but Spiegel speculated that the
sessions helped patients over
come depression and therefore
were able to care for them
selves and comply with treat
ment protocols better. They
warned that the results should
not encourage the philosophy
that psychology is all that is
needed to treat disease. "The
patients who did well were all
involved in an aggressive med
ical treatment regimen."
Spiegel said that patients un
dergoing group therapy were
encouraged to be more aggres
sive in securing treatment from
their providers, and this may
have contributed to greater
survival.
