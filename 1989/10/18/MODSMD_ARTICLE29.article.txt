# Consumer fallout from the Font Wars fire: wait and see
## 
### Mark Rogowsky Senior staff writer 
Editor's note: This is the second
in a three-part series on the so
called Font Wars that are shaking
up the computer industry.

Last week in this space, we
looked at the development of the
technology used to display and
print type with personal comput
ers. Let's now take a look at the
battle that is brewing between
giants of the industry and the
effect it will have on you, the
computer user.

The most signifi
cant salvo in the
Font Wars was fired
a month ago when
Apple and Microsoft
announced an
agreement to share
font technology. Un
der the arrange
ment, Apple will
give Microsoft a

technology called Royal, which is
used to generate outline fonts on
computer displays.
In return, Microsoft will pro
vide Apple with a "clone" of
Adobe's Postscript that Apple will

ostensibly use in fu
ture printers.
Apple is currently
suing Microsoft
over an unrelated
matter. When the
two suddenly
jumped into bed
with one another,
even industry
watchers were

shocked.
"Who cares?" you say. For
starters, users of IBM PC
compatibles. Microsoft is going to
take the outline font technology
and add it in to future versions

of OS/2. In the long run, PCs will
be better equipped to produce
quality output without Postscript.
That*B good news.
In addition, future laser printer
buyers should be ecstatic. If the
reason for buying a Postscript
laser was high-quality text out
put, you'll no longer need a
Postscript printer. Since Apple's
font technology can generate type
at any resolution, they'll be able
to get the most out of any laser
printer the Macintosh can drive.
That's a big advantage when one
considers that non-Postscript
printers cost anywhere from $500

to $2,500 less than their
Postscript counterparts. Clearly,
more good news.
But these aren't called the Font
Wars for no reason and, as usual,
it's you and I who are the
casualties.
Computer users now have to
sort out these two competing
standards while Apple, Microsoft
and Adobe all reach for as big a
piece of the pie as possible. Com
patibility that was once guaran
teed in an all-Postscript world will
go out the window in the near
future.
To be fair, both sides are work

ing to allow cross-compatibility.
Apple says its fonts will work on
Postscript printers and Adobe
plans on making its fonts com
patible with the Royal standard.
Despite the calming words,
though, it will be six months to
a year before the dust settles. Ap
ple is planning to introduce its
font standard with the new sys
tem software, Version 7.0, slated
for release in the first quarter of
1990.
Only then will Apple's inten
tions even begin to become clear.
Next week we'll look at what
to do in the meantime.
