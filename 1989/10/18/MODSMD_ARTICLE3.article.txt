# Major damage suffered throughout Bay Area

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - The
nation's second-deadliest earth
quake ravaged Northern Califor
nia, crushing more than 200
people to death in their cars, in
juring 400 others, caving in high
ways and collapsing bridges. The
magnitude of the catastrophe
slowly emerged yesterday.
"This is just a devastating, ter
rible, terrible situation beyond
everybody's imagination," said
Marty Boyer, the Alameda County
public information officer.
The quake along the notorious
San Andreas Fault registered 7.0
on the Hichter scale. It hit at 5:04
p.m. Yesterday, stranding thou
sands of office workers downtown
as night fell over the powerless
city.
At least 200 people were killed
in their cars when a mile-long
section of the upper level of In
terstate 880 in Oakland collapsed
onto the lower level, said Boyer.
Tractors, bulldozers and dump
trucks were called out, and trucks
and vans took bodies from the
site, Boyer said.
The quake sent thousands of
terrified office workers rushing
into the streets of Oakland and
San Francisco, and many re
mained stranded hours later.
Reports of damage and injuries
grew as officials made contact
with hard-hit areas, where many
telephones were cut off. Up to 1

million people were left without
power.
At least two bridges in the
Santa Cruz area collapsed, and
highways leading out of the city
were damaged, said Highway Pa
trol Officer Kim Penrose.
In San Francisco, at least nine
people died, and minor looting and
vandalism were reported in the
city's major crack dealing area.
Four people died when a falling
building facade crushed them as
they were entering their cars on
6th St. south of Market, KGO-TV
reported.
"The main problem is there's
no lights. When the power is off,
opportunists come out," police
dispatcher Chris Curran said.
Mayor Art Agnos asked the
Army to help.
Several hundred California Na
tional Guard soldiers were being
mobilized, including engineers,
military police and medical
workers, said Staff Sgt. Frank
Jones of" the state Military De
partment in Sacramento.
Still, Agnos said, "The city is
in reasonably good shape; we've
survived this so far."
Fire engines and ambulances,
sirens howling, picked their way
through a darkened San Fran
cisco. Car headlights and an oc
casional office building running
on emergency generators stood
out. Buses were jammed and traf
fic was backed up.
Commuters were left with no
major transportation routes east
out of San Francisco. The top deck
of the San Francisco-Oakland Bay
Bridge collapsed onto the lower
road. Bay Area Rapid Transit was
closed. Sections of the two-tiered
Nimitz Freeway collapsed.
Agnos said five people died in
the city after buildings collapsed
on cars, and three died in the
Marina section in a fire that
burned spectacularly much of the
evening before being brought un
der control.
Up to 20 people were hurt in
the fire, officials said.
In Santa Cruz, at least six
people died in the collapse of the
City Garden Mall, the highway
patrol said.
Willis Jacobs of the National
Earthquake Information Center
in Golden, Colo., said the quake
was centered about eight miles
northeast of Santa Cruz or 75
miles south of San Francisco
along the San Andreas. That is
the major earthquake fault
blamed for the 1906 disaster that
destroyed much of the city and
killed hundreds â€” 700, according
to traditional estimates, and more

At least four smaller
aftershocks were re
corded.

than 2,500, according to recent
studies.
A 30-foot section of the upper
deck of the bridge connecting
Oakland and San Francisco col
lapsed, leaving three cars dangling
between the levels. Reports said
most occupants got out of their
cars safely, but CNN and ABC-TV
reported that one person on the
bridge was killed.
CBS said the California High
way Patrol reported a J.C. Penney
building in downtown Hollister
collapsed, as did a bridge on High
way 101 in Hollister.
Gov. George Deukmejian cut
short a trade mission to
Frankfurt, West Germany and
flew home on an Air Force plane.
In Washington, President Bush
dispatched Transportation Secre
tary Samuel Skinner to California
to assess the damage. Vice Pres
ident Dan Quayle, who was in San
Diego yesterday, said he will ac
company Skinner.
The quake was felt in Reno,
Nev., 225 miles to the northeast;
as far north as the Russian River
area, 70 miles to the north; 120
miles due east in Stockton; and
as far south as the San Fernando

Valley. High-rise buildings in Los
Angeles also shook.
At least four smaller after
shocks were recorded, said Bruce
Presgrave of the National Earth
quake Information Service in
Golden. More were expected, but
Presgrave said he did not expect
them to be strong.
There were no reports of
damage to the Golden Gate Bridge
that connects San Francisco to
Marin County. The San Mateo
bridge, which crosses the bay
about 10 miles south of Candle
stick Park, was closed for inspec
tion.
The Oakland Airport was
closed, and only outgoing flights
continued at San Francisco Air
port.
The 7.0 Richter reading made
this the sixth-most powerful
quake to strike California this
century and the most powerful
since a 7.0 quake centered in
Eureka in 1980.
The Richter scale is a measure
of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. Every increase of
one number means a tenfold in
crease in magnitude.
An earthquake of 6 on the scale
can cause severe damage. A 7
reading is a earthquake,
capable of widespread, heavy
damage. The 1906 earthquake,
which occurred before the scale
was devised, has been estimated
at magnitude 8.3.
