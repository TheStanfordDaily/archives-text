SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - The
nation's second-deadliest earth
quake ravaged Northern Califor
nia, crushing more than 200
people to death in their cars, in
juring 400 others, caving in high
ways and collapsing bridges. The
magnitude of the catastrophe
slowly emerged yesterday.
"This is just a devastating, ter
rible, terrible situation beyond
everybody's imagination," said
Marty Boyer, the Alameda County
public information officer.
The quake along the notorious
San Andreas Fault registered 7.0
on the Hichter scale. It hit at 5:04
p.m. Yesterday, stranding thou
sands of office workers downtown
as night fell over the powerless
city.
At least 200 people were killed
in their cars when a mile-long
section of the upper level of In
terstate 880 in Oakland collapsed
onto the lower level, said Boyer.
Tractors, bulldozers and dump
trucks were called out, and trucks
and vans took bodies from the
site, Boyer said.
The quake sent thousands of
terrified office workers rushing
into the streets of Oakland and
San Francisco, and many re
mained stranded hours later.
Reports of damage and injuries
grew as officials made contact
with hard-hit areas, where many
telephones were cut off. Up to 1

million people were left without
power.
At least two bridges in the
Santa Cruz area collapsed, and
highways leading out of the city
were damaged, said Highway Pa
trol Officer Kim Penrose.
In San Francisco, at least nine
people died, and minor looting and
vandalism were reported in the
city's major crack dealing area.
Four people died when a falling
building facade crushed them as
they were entering their cars on
6th St. south of Market, KGO-TV
reported.
"The main problem is there's
no lights. When the power is off,
opportunists come out," police
dispatcher Chris Curran said.
Mayor Art Agnos asked the
Army to help.
Several hundred California Na
tional Guard soldiers were being
mobilized, including engineers,
military police and medical
workers, said Staff Sgt. Frank
Jones of" the state Military De
partment in Sacramento.
Still, Agnos said, "The city is
in reasonably good shape; we've
survived this so far."
Fire engines and ambulances,
sirens howling, picked their way
through a darkened San Fran
cisco. Car headlights and an oc
casional office building running
