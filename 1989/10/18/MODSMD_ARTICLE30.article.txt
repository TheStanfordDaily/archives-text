## Earthquake disrupts Bay Series Future of October classic uncertain after disaster strikes 'Stick

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -
"This Series has gone from the
mundane to the memorable."
It took an earthquake to do it,
but Oakland Athletics general
manager Sandy Alderson was
right. The 1989 World Series al
ways will be remembered for what
happened Tuesday night.
Umpire A 1 Clark was still in
the dressing room when the earth
quake hit.
"It was one of the scariest sit
uations I've ever been in. As soon
as it started, my legs went numb,"
Clark said. "I looked up, and the
walls were waving. I became
frightened, and I realized it was
an earthquake."
"I knew something was wrong
when I saw the first base dugout
moving," San Francisco Giants
catcher Terry Kennedy said. "The
World Series doesn't mean any
thing compared to what happened
in this city tonight. People were
hurt, and people lost their homes.
It makes me feel sick."
Remarkably, there were no

major injuries reported at
Candlestick Park, which sits on
the bay about five miles from
downtown San Francisco and
eight miles from Oakland.
"The people two to three rows
in front of me had big pieces of
metal several inches long fall on
their heads," David Guzzetti, a
city council member from Chico,
Calif., said. "The light towers
were just rocking back and forth.
I couldn't believe it."
Many people knew exactly what
was happening because, as resi
dents of the Bay area, they had
been through earthquakes before
â€” although not as severe as this
one, which measured 6.9 on the
Richter scale.
"I was sitting there with
(Commissioner) Fay Vincent,"
National League president Bill
White said. "We looked up, and
somebody said, 'There's an earth
quake.' Nobody panicked. That's
the important thing. The fans
didn't panic. We could have had
a much more difficult situation.

The fans deserve credit for being
calm."
Calm but scared.
"I guess it lasted only 20
seconds, but it seemed like 20
minutes," said David Sanderford,
a Long Beach, Calif., resident, who
added that he had felt only one
earthquake that was more pow
erful during his lifetime in Cali
fornia. "It happened just as the
players ran on the field, and I
thought people were stomping in
the upper deck. But then as it got
a little stronger, I knew it was a
quake.
"People jumped up and gave
each other some high fives. They
thought it was an omen for a good
game."
The game, of course, wasn't
played, and nobody is sure when
the Series might resume.
"You can't stop concrete," Oak
land outfielder Dave Henderson
said. "Forget the World Series."
Rip Ridley, a season ticket
holder since 1973, and his wife
Elizabeth were riding in a car on

the way to the ballpark and never
felt the shock. Ridley's first con
cern was how this was being seen
in the rest of the country.
"I'm always trying to get
friends out here," he said. "What
am I going to tell them now?"
The nearly 60,000 in the stands,
and the Giants and A's on the
field, were just stunned.
Kennedy and the rest of his
teammates milled around the
field wondering what to do next.
"I think everyone was nervous,
and very few were thinking about
the World Series," Kennedy said.
"The word came quickly that part
of the Bay Bridge had collapsed,
and people had died.
"The World Series means noth
ing now," Kennedy said. "I'm sick
about this. The people of the area
waited forever to see the Giants
and A's in the World Series, and
this happens.
"But it makes you realize just
what place baseball should have
in your life. I found that out
tonight."
