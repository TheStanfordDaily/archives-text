# Women booters assail Aggies
## 
### Michael Clayton Staff writer 
While much of the Bay Area
and the Stanford campus scurried
to figure out what had happened
at 5:04 p.m., the Stanford wom
en's soccer team stood up from
the shaking ground and finished
off business.
Women's Soccer
With 10 minutes and 21 seconds
showing on the clock yesterday
against UC-Davis, the ground
began to shake. Players looked at
the shifting ground and wondered
if physical exhaustion had thrown
their minds into some type of al
tered state. In the next instant,
the bleachers frantically emptied,
and spectators and players clung
to the shaking ground wondering
what was happening.
The hapless Aggies must have
hoped that some higher power
would demand that they leave the
field to escape with a postpone
ment. Instead, the referee
whistled the spectators off the
field and ordered the game to con
tinue. Ten minutes later, the
19th-ranked Cardinal walked off
the field with a 3-0 victory.
"It feels great," freshman for
ward Anne Hoge said. "We'll re
member this as the day the earth

shook."
Hoge will remember Tuesday
for more than the shock waves
that reverberated through Harry
Maloney Field. Hoge's excitement
came in the first half when, with
just under three minutes left in
the half, Hoge picked up a shot
which sophomore Elizabeth
Joneschild had banged off the
Aggie goalie's hands and knocked
it into the back of the net. The
goal was Hoge's first score in a
Stanford uniform and put the
Cardinal up 1-0.
With less than 25 seconds left
in the half, senior Tonya An
tonucci followed up Hoge's fresh
man heroics with the second
Stanford goal. Antonucci capped
off an impressive display of Car
dinal possesion play, which in
cluded a string of crisply executed
passes beginning in the Cardinal
defensive half and ending up in
the back of the Aggie net. Fresh
man standout Julie Foudy
dribbled around three defenders
on the right side of the field and
found Antonucci in the middle of
the penalty box. Antonucci put the
Cardinal ahead 2-0 with a ball
into the right corner of the net.
"As a squad, we were really
clicking," Hoge said. "Our focus
was to play well, and we took care
of that."
The Cardinal dominated the
play throughout the game. Stan
ford (9-3-1) beat the Aggies to
every contestable ball and effi
ciently executed their passing
game in order to release a bevy

of shots on goal.
Shortly into the second half,
Foudy was tripped inside the
penalty box. She placed the
penalty kick in the bottom left
corner to record her 11th goal of
the season and put the Cardinal
up 3-0.
"There were two things that I
did not want to happen in this
game," Coach Berhane Andeber
han said. "First, I didn't want the
game to become too easy, and,
second, I didn't want the game to
become so physical that would
wear down our players."
The Aggies (2-13) refused to let
the game become a blowout. De
spite being outshot 24-5 and being
unable to sustain possession of
the ball for more than 20 seconds
at a time, UC-Davis avoided let
ting the game get out of hand
with last-second, desperate saves.
"1 think the game was a rela
tively clean, good game" Andeber
han said. "I had the opportunity
to play everyone, and we were
able to work on a couple tactical
aspects of our game. Davis ex
ecutes a very good offside trap,
and we were able to counter that
better than we ever have."
The Cardinal now enters into
the most difficult (and the most
important) part of its season.
Riding the momentum of a four
game unbeaten streak, the squad
will travel to the Virginia Invita
tional on Thursday for games
against Duke and Virginia. On
Tuesday, Stanford will return
home to host No. 1 North Carolina

at Maloney Field. The next five
opponents whom the Cardinal will
face all received top-20 votes in
last week's poll, and to be a
legitimate contender for a post

season spot, Stanford will need to
fare well against these quality op
ponents.
"We used this game to ac
complish some specific aspects of

our game," Andeberhan said. "We
just have a few minor details to
clean up and a little rest to catch
up on before we leave for Vir
ginia."

the season and put the Cardinal
up 3-0.
"There were two things that I
did not want to happen in this
game," Coach Berhane Andeber
han said. "First, I didn't want the
game to become too easy, and,
second, I didn't want the game to
become so physical that would
wear down our players."
The Aggies (2-13) refused to let
the game become a blowout. De
spite being outshot 24-5 and being
unable to sustain possession of
the ball for more than 20 seconds
at a time, UC-Davis avoided let
ting the game get out of hand
with last-second, desperate saves.
"1 think the game was a rela
tively clean, good game" Andeber
han said. "I had the opportunity
to play everyone, and we were
able to work on a couple tactical
aspects of our game. Davis ex
ecutes a very good offside trap,
and we were able to counter that
better than we ever have."
The Cardinal now enters into
the most difficult (and the most
important) part of its season.
Riding the momentum of a four
game unbeaten streak, the squad
will travel to the Virginia Invita
tional on Thursday for games
against Duke and Virginia. On
Tuesday, Stanford will return
home to host No. 1 North Carolina

at Maloney Field. The next five
opponents whom the Cardinal will
face all received top-20 votes in
last week's poll, and to be a
legitimate contender for a post

season spot, Stanford will need to
fare well against these quality op
ponents.
"We used this game to ac
complish some specific aspects of

our game," Andeberhan said. "We
just have a few minor details to
clean up and a little rest to catch
up on before we leave for Vir
ginia."

Freshman forward Anne Hoge dribbled through the UC-Davis defense to score the first collegiate
goal of her career yesterday in Stanford's 3-0 win.
While much of the Bay Area
and the Stanford campus scurried
to figure out what had happened
at 5:04 p.m., the Stanford wom
en's soccer team stood up from
the shaking ground and finished
off business.
Women's Soccer
With 10 minutes and 21 seconds
showing on the clock yesterday
against UC-Davis, the ground
began to shake. Players looked at
the shifting ground and wondered
if physical exhaustion had thrown
their minds into some type of al
tered state. In the next instant,
the bleachers frantically emptied,
and spectators and players clung
to the shaking ground wondering
what was happening.
The hapless Aggies must have
hoped that some higher power
would demand that they leave the
field to escape with a postpone
ment. Instead, the referee
whistled the spectators off the
field and ordered the game to con
tinue. Ten minutes later, the
19th-ranked Cardinal walked off
the field with a 3-0 victory.
"It feels great," freshman for
ward Anne Hoge said. "We'll re
member this as the day the earth

shook."
Hoge will remember Tuesday
for more than the shock waves
that reverberated through Harry
Maloney Field. Hoge's excitement
came in the first half when, with
just under three minutes left in
the half, Hoge picked up a shot
which sophomore Elizabeth
Joneschild had banged off the
Aggie goalie's hands and knocked
it into the back of the net. The
goal was Hoge's first score in a
Stanford uniform and put the
Cardinal up 1-0.
With less than 25 seconds left
in the half, senior Tonya An
tonucci followed up Hoge's fresh
man heroics with the second
Stanford goal. Antonucci capped
off an impressive display of Car
dinal possesion play, which in
cluded a string of crisply executed
passes beginning in the Cardinal
defensive half and ending up in
the back of the Aggie net. Fresh
man standout Julie Foudy
dribbled around three defenders
on the right side of the field and
found Antonucci in the middle of
the penalty box. Antonucci put the
Cardinal ahead 2-0 with a ball
into the right corner of the net.
"As a squad, we were really
clicking," Hoge said. "Our focus
was to play well, and we took care
of that."
The Cardinal dominated the
play throughout the game. Stan
ford (9-3-1) beat the Aggies to
every contestable ball and effi
ciently executed their passing
game in order to release a bevy

of shots on goal.
Shortly into the second half,
Foudy was tripped inside the
penalty box. She placed the
penalty kick in the bottom left
corner to record her 11th goal of
the season and put the Cardinal
up 3-0.
"There were two things that I
did not want to happen in this
game," Coach Berhane Andeber
han said. "First, I didn't want the
game to become too easy, and,
second, I didn't want the game to
become so physical that would
