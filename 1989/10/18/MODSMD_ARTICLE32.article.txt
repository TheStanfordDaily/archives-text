I'm really not accustomed to
having to defend any of my
teams from undeniably over
critical sports writers, and I
hope I will never have to be.
However, in last Wednes
day's paper, Mark Rogowsky's
commentary on women's vol
leyball was based solely on
blind, opinionated misinforma
tion that I feel was completely
uncalled for and openly
derogatory to the team.
I think that I speak for many
of my teammates who read the
article and selected others that
refused to read it when I say
that Rogowsky has no clue
about what is "wrong" with our
team. He never bothered to
talk to any of the players or
our coaches to find out how we
felt about our play or what we
planned to do about it.
Yes, we were struggling for
a while, but statistics oflen do
not reflect the actual quality
of play. If Rogowsky knew any
thing at all about the game, he
would know that it is one of
momentum and concentration,
not of rankings or supposi
tions. Volleyball is unique in
that aspect because anybody
can beat anybody.
At this point, we are trying
to begin again, working on
basics and fundamentals in
practice. It seems to be working
for us, as we had a much better
weekend, beating Arizona and
Arizona State to break our so
called "losing streak."
Rogowsky's column came at
a really bad time for us and
was exactly what we didn't
need. It only succeeded in
bringing down the members of
the team that read it at a point

in the season when we need
encouragement and confidence.
We still have a long way to
go, but I think that a little
support could make a differ
ence.

Change seating
Up to now I have found the
tradition of fraternities and
dorms having gofers waiting in
line all night and saving blocks
of seats objectionable but
(barely) tolerable. They have
taken the center of the student
section out of circulation, but
1 have been able to get seats
on the 20 by arriving an hour
early. But for this game all the
upper section of the student
seats were reserved by 12 noon
when I arrived.
I can understand the wish
of living units to sit together,
but I do not like the present
situation which forces them to
do so only at the expense of
the part of the student body
which lives in EV or off-campus
without affiliations.
Also objectionable is the pile
of ground-up newspaper, food,
drink and fastfood packaging
which is left outside the gates.
This situation needs an ad
ministrative response which is
fair to all of the student body:
it should allow for block seating
but leave good seats available
for the rest of us. In the mean
while, I do not believe we, or
school policy, should tolerate
students saving more than a
single seat for a companion.
