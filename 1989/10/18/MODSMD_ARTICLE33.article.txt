# Card defense gears for aerial assault

### Chris Crader Editorial staff 
When one looks at Saturday's
Stanford-Utah football game, only
one thing is for sure: there'll be
a lot of passing.
The game will be a contest be
tween the 1-5 Cardinal, a team
which will likely play without
three of its top running backs,
and the 2-5 Utes, who live and
die on the left arm of quarterback
Scott Mitchell. The Cardinal has
thrown 164 passes in the last
three games and the 6-foot-6, 231 -
pound Mitchell is averaging 331.6
yards passing per game.
The game will also give Stan
ford a chance to rebound from a
31-13 defeat against Washington
State Saturday.
"The second half pf the season
offers us some opportunities
which our team and staff are
ready to take advantage of," Stan
ford Coach Denny Green said.
"We're looking forward to get back
home against Utah."
The only good news from the
Cardinal's trip to Pullman, Wash.,
over the weekend was that no one

else suffered a serious injury. De
spite this, however, Stanford's
three top halfbacks will not play
against Utah. Star outside line
backer Rob Hinckley will probably
also miss the game due to a back
injury he suffered against San
Jose State.
At quarterback, Brian Johnson
might be able to play despite
bruising his knee against the
Cougars. "Brian's swelling is not
as bad as it could have been,"
Green said. "He's still limping a
little bit. ... If Brian can't go,
Steve [Smith] would start."
Johnson won the starting job
with his performance in a relief
role in the Oregon State game.
He started the next game, against
Oregon, before he injured his
shoulder.
Johnson returned to the field
after Smith struggled early
against WSU and moved the team
somewhat. Johnson then injured
his knee and true freshman John
Lynch came in for the Cardinal.
Many people have wondered why
Green chose to play Lynch, thus
sacrificing a chance for Lynch to
redshirt this year.

One explanation was that Green
wanted to get Lynch some expe
rience, but that argument would
be a lot stronger if Green planned
to play Lynch more this season.
When asked about this, Green an
swered that he would play Lynch
"if we get to the third quarter
back."
Defensively, the Cardinal will
likely do many of the same things
the team tried to do against Wash
ington State. Green implied the
team would play a lot of nickel
(five defensive backs) defense and
that the team would not blitz too
much in an effort to stop Mitchell.
"We'll do our best to get in his
face," defensive tackle Matt
Borkowski said. "We'll have to do
a better job rushing this week.
We didn't against Washington
State, and look what happened.
We didn't against San Jose State,
and look what happened."
If Stanford does not pressure
Mitchell, the defensive backs
could be in for a long day. Mitchell
holds 10 NCAA records, including
most yards passing in a game (631
against Air Force last year).
"Scott Mitchell is a big-time

player with a big-time arm,"
Green said.
Card notes
Football practice was interrupted by
the earthquake yesterday, but after
the quake ended, practice resumed.
Business as usual.
The opinion of the players was bas
ically that they were in the safest
place possible, the middle of a huge
field. Many of them were alarmed,
however, by the fact that Maples Pa
vilion was swaying back and forth a
great deal.
