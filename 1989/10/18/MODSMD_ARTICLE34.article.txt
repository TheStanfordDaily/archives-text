# Athletic facilities safety-inspected today
## 
### Arnold Spogater Senior staff writer 
Much like the women's soccer
game at Maloney Field yesterday,
it appears that the University's
athletic facilities have successfuly
weathered the strongest earth
quake to hit the Rav Area since
1906.
The soccer game, against UC-
Davis, was suspended for about
five minutes for the tremor. The
game resumed, however, and
Senior Assoc. Athletic Director
Alan Cummings expects that

other athletic activities on campus
will follow suit.
"It looks like our athletic facil
ities have survived quite well," he
said. "There are no reported in
juries."
The worst situation occured in
Maples Pavilion, where the men's
basketball team was engaged in
its second practice of the season.
One hour, 35 minutes into prac
tice, the quake hit and the players
ran for the exits.
A few speakers and a couple of
lights fell to the floor, but no one

was injured. Some of the floor
boards were damaged by the fall
ing objects, however, and the
Holiday Inn/Stanford Invitational
women's volleyball tournament,
scheduled for Maples tomorrow
and Friday, will likely be moved
to Old Pavilion.
"The first thing [today] we will
make a complete physical assess
ment," Cummings said. "Tomor
row we will also make an
assessment of the condition of
Stanford Stadium as it relates to
Saturday's game." The Cardinal
football team is scheduled to meet

Utah at 1 p.m. there Saturday.
Despite the quake, football
practice and the soccer match con
tinued without event. The
women's volleyball team was not
as fortunate, however, as their
match with California at Old Pa
vilion was cancelled. The match
will be rescheduled for a future
date.
"Roble Gym and the Golf
Course are fine," Cummings said.
"It appears that there is only cur
sory damage in Maples Pavilion,
Encina Gym and the department
administration building."
