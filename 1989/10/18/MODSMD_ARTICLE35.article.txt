### David Earnest Senior staff writer 
Because of yesterday's earth
quake, the Stanford women's
volleyball match against Cali
fornia has been postponed.
Coach Don Shaw said a deci
sion has not been made as to
when the match will be
replayed.
The California team did ar
rive at Old Pavilion at around
7 p.m. last night, but the de
cision to scrub the match had
already been made, apparently
because of light damage at Old
Pavilion.
Shaw said there was "no sig
nificant damage, just some
minor stuff." The only visible
damage was a fallen light fix
ture that sprayed broken glass
over the upper deck area of the
arena.
Because of light damage at
Maples Pavilion, this week's
Holiday Inn/Stanford Invita
tional will likely be played in
Old Pavilion. The tournament's

replayed.

matches, to be played on
Thursday and Friday, are still
on, according to Shaw.
In the recently refurbished
Old Pavilion, a 25-foot-long
light fixture, hung from the
ceiling by suspension wires, fell
in front of the offices of the
men's and women's gymnastics
coaches after the shock. Al
though several neon bulbs and
plastic encasings were broken,
no glass fell to the lower wood
floor or on the playing surface.
There appeared to be no
damage to the bleachers or any
other of the arena's facilities.
