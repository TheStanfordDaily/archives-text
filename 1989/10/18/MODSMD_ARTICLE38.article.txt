### Lisa Nellor Staff writer 
A group of local Guardian An
gels assembled at Roble Hall yes
terday, adding a little heavenly
protection to the residents of the
recently earthquake-proofed
dorm.
The Guardian Angels, distin
guished by their red berets and
white T-shirts, are a nationwide
group of young self-proclaimed
protectors of urban residents.
They had just completed a lecture
and demonstration in Roble
Lounge yesterday when the earth
quake hit.
As soon as the tremors ended,
Fernando Esquivel, a member of
the organization, said he and
several other Angels "came run
ning into the building, going
through the rooms to make sure
that everyone got out safely."
"It was an instant reaction to
help everyone evacuate," Esquivel
added. He then turned off all the
gas lines and secured all the glass
in the kitchen.
Angel Shirley Chester said she
felt "it was our duty to help the

people. That's what our group is
all about."
Allison Gerson, a resident as
sistant at Roble, said she did not
believe the building had suffered
much structural damage from the
quake and was "thankful that
they renovated it." It was "great
to have had the Guardian Angels
there to check it all out, she
added.
Esquivel said that after things
had calmed down at Roble, he and
several Angels went to the Stan
ford Shopping Center to make
sure no one was looting any stores
damaged by the quake. "Everyone
there was really calm," Esquivel
said, adding that he did not see
any looting.
The local group plans to join
up with the San Francisco Guard
ian Angels today to begin helping
with the massive cleanup of
bridges and other areas of the city
damaged yesterday.
The group's speech scheduled
for Annenburg Auditorium last
night was canceled due to the
quake. Members said that they do
not plan to reschedule this pre
sentation.
