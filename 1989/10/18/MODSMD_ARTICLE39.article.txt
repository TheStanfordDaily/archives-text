# No injuries reported despite numerous chemical spills
## 
### Jock Friedly Editorial staff 
Equipped with self-contained
breathing equipment, Health and
Safety employees swept through
the campus laboratories last night
after the earthquake, trying to
determine the magnitude of well
over a dozen chemical spills and
leaks.
Numerous buildings were

evacuated, but there were no
reports of any injuries.
Health and Safety officials,
swamped with an emergency job
much too large for their staff, gave
only a cursory look at many labs
with chemical spills, but as of last
night, the teams had not discov
ered any problems that presented
grave dangers to life.
However, many canisters of ex
tremely toxic gas were knocked
over by the earthquake in the
Hansen Laboratories of the Ap
plied Physics Department. Health
and Safety was initially concerned
with leaks of chemicals as dan
gerous as cyanide that were con
tained in some of those canisters,
but researchers say they saw no
evidence of a problem.
The chemistry buildings ap
peared to be some of the worst-hit
buildings on campus, and chemi
cal spills were deemed by Health
and Safety to be under control,

although none of them were
cleaned up. Firefighters who
responded were sent away around
6 p.m. by one Health and Safety
official who said the situation was
under control and that the worst
of the problem had passed.
But at least one chemistry grad
uate student saw extensive
damage in the chemical stores of
the Mudd Building, which con
tained hundreds and perhaps
thousands of different chemicals,
and said the problem could get
considerably worse by allowing it
to sit. "It's very bad," said student
Virginia Chang. "It's quite dan
gerous to be in there."
Most windows of Stauffer 111,
another chemistry building, were
knocked out by the earthquake,
and glassware in the laboratories
was mostly shattered. The three
Stauffer buildings have been the
subject of much attention over the
past few years for possibly safety

hazards.
"It was very frightening," said
Chemistry Prof. Steve George,
who was in his laboratory at the
time of the earthquake.
Large quantities of formal
dehyde, a foul-smelling but not
toxic chemical, were spilled in one
laboratory in the hospital. Jars
containing "specimens" soaked in
formaldehyde were reportedly
knocked off shelves. Health and
Safety workers helped to clean up
some of the spill and determined
there was no threat to anyone's
safety.
Other Medical Center laborato
ries were considered to be the
major concern for cleanup crews,
although there were no details
available on the specific hazards
thought to exist. Officials re
ported extensive damage to labo
ratories in the School of Medicine.
According to Mike Goodkind, a
spokesperson for the Medical Cen

ter, officials were "evaluating
whether they need to close the
laboratories."
All campus science laboratories
will be closed today as Health and
Safety teams more carefully in
spect all of the buildings. Health
and Safety officials had no esti
mate as to when they would be
finished with cleanup or when
they could reopen laboratories.
"The University will not open
(laboratories) until everything is
safe," said Health and Safety
spokesperson John Hughes.
Health and Safety employees,
including office staff, worked until
after 10:30 p.m., and many were
planning to start cleanup early
today.
"This is basically glorified
janitor work all night," said Dave
Conrod, a specialist in Health and
Safety who checked out numerous
calls of spills or potential hazards.
