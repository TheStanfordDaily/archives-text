# Quake '89 — where were you?
## 
### 
Even in the biggest earthquake
in the United States since 1906,
Domino's Pizza still delivers — in
less than 30 minutes.
Domino's driver Tom Lyons ar
rived outside Terman Engineering
Building with two pizzas about
15 minutes after the quake hit.
"I saw the car shaking but it
didn't seem like that big a deal,"
he said, explaining that the
tremor began as soon as he
stepped into his car.
Since traffic lights were not
functioning, Lyons said he had no
trouble delivering the two pizzas
expediently.
Students seeking food in the
Coffee House were not so patient
while waiting for their meals.
"Everyone in the Coffee House
bolted, screaming and yelling and
running out the door," said senior
Tina Rooke, a native Californian
who immediately dove under a
Coffee House table. "I don't know
if they were non-Californians or
what."
Mesmerized by televised broad
casts of the wake of yesterday's
earthquake, a group of anxious
students gathered around a small
television by Terman, which was
hooked up to the cigarette lighter
of a car.
Vip Tolat, who received a Ph.D.
from Stanford in September, said,
"I was scared [to death]. When
we went out of the building,
though, everyone was all right.
We called it a day. No one wanted
to go back to their offices."
Tolat's own office was damaged

by the quake. "My office was
trashed," he said, "My labs, my
computer were trashed. Plaster
was everywhere."
As the lucky people who were
not evicted filed back into their
dorms where the familiar lyrics,
"I feel the earth move under my
feet," and Prince's "Housequake"
were the tunes of choice.
Documentary film students at
tending a graduate Department of
Communications presentation in
Meyer Forum Room took the
earthquake in stride.
Producer Gale Ann Herd and
cameraman Jim Giddings were
presenting a slideshow and dem
onstration on special effects in the
movie The Abyss when the earth
quake struck. Students reported
that Herd, a Stanford alumna, did
not miss a beat during the earth
quake, saying to Giddings, "Jim,
this is just like one of your special
effects."
The quake did not shake several
people from their daily routine,
including Stanford's football
team, which continued its prepa
ration for Saturday's game
against Utah despite the quake.
"Everybody got a little bit ner
vous, but then we just went right
back to practice," said assistant
football Coach Chris Foerster.
"Nobody was scared — except
when it was shaking."
At deGuerre Pool, several
people were swimming laps
shortly after the quake.
Sophomore June Molgaard,
whose 19th birthday was inter
rupted by the quake, was on the

third floor of Kairos when the
shaking began. "It was very
rigorous; rolling, but shaking at
the same time. It was difficult to
run. I considered standing in the
doorway, but I was worried about
the house falling down."
Junior Thad Quaas said his
apartment building on Curtner
Ave., had no power, lights and gas
as of 9 p.m. A water main also
burst next to the apartment he
shares with three other under
graduates.
"We live next to train tracks
and when I felt the rumbling, I
thought it was a train at first,"
Quaas said. "The place shook like
Hell's carriage," he said, adding
that the apartment building
swayed for two minutes after the
quake ended.
Stanford University President
Donald Kennedy was in the safest
place possible at the time of the
earthquake. He was in the air
returning from fundraising in
New York yesterday afternoon. He
had not been in contact with his
family as of last night, but TWA
officials told his wife, Robin Ken
nedy, that he was rerouted to Los
Angeles.
Mrs. Kennedy said that the
President's house received "a lot
of damage" from the earthquake.
The majority of the damage was
due to fallen crystal, pottery,
paintings and other items that
were on shelves. Mrs. Kennedy
roughly estimated damage to the
house as "at least $25,000 and up
to $100,000."
