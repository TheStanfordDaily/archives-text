# SWOPSI celebrates twenty years of student involvement
## 
### Ed Palattella 
When three Stanford students founded
SWOPSI in 1969, they vowed to create
a program that would encourage active
engagement in solving society's problems.
Twenty years later, the real world con
tinues to be SWOPSI's classroom.
SWOPSI — Stanford Workshops on Po
litical and Social Issues — held its
birthday celebration at the Bechtel In
ternational Center this weekend.
About 75 people, including the foun
ders and former students of SWOPSI,
attended the celebration, which took the
form of a series of seminars, said Margo
Horn, director of Innovative Academic
Courses, the department which includes
SWOPSI.
"SWOPSI has changed people's lives.
It has meant different things to different
people," said Horn. "It has provided a
channel for activists and provided a haven
for students who want to get involved."
SWOPSI uses a workshop format, gen
erally led by professionals or students, to
study political and social issues and apply
the resultant findings.
Horn, LAC director since 1985, said she
hopes to help the SWOPSI of the 1990s
undertake programs that emphasize
problem-solving and social action, two of

SWOPSI's original themes that faded in
the 1970s but began to re-emerge in the
1980s.
Horn said the birthday celebration
showed her that "in the past, SWOPSI
has been issue-oriented. Courses focused
on research and a report." In the future,
the program should combine more action
with its present emphasis on academics,
Horn said.
"We want to keep our visibility strong
and become more activist," she said.
Some of the 10 SWOPSI courses of
fered this quarter are "Nonviolence and
Social Change," "Issues in Self-Defense
for Women" and "Drug Abuse and Pre
vention in America's Youth."
Most SWOPSI courses have around 10
students, Horn said. This quarter, she
said, students had to be turned away
from all the classes.
Some other topics Horn would like
SWOPSI to address are local environ
mental issues, toxins and the uses of
technology.
SWOPSI's first catalog, presented in
1969, included such courses as "Housing
in the Mid-Peninsula," "Policies on the
Release of Chemicals into the Biosphere"
and "Participatory Democracy."
SWOPSI was founded by two graduate
students and an undergraduate, who de

veloped the program with a $7,000 grant
from the Ford Foundation and $4,500
from Stanford.
Although SWOPSI's initial budget was
small, its courses paid off, Horn said.
Because of studies done in early SWOPSI
classes, the Pescadero Dam, a local proj
ect, was not built, and plans for a road
that was to run through Stanford were
discontinued, she said.
Along with SWOPSI's successes, how
ever, came problems. In January 1975,
a University report recommended that
SWOPSI "be ended as a separate program
in 1976" and be absorbed by other de
partments to save money.
But 11 months later, another report
recommended that SWOPSI be granted
independent, semipermanent status. The
University accepted the second recom
mendation, and SWOPSI remained.
In 1984, yet another report recom
mended that SWOPSI and other ex
tradepartmental programs be placed
under a single departmental education
center. After the recommendation was ac
cepted, SWOPSI became a part of the
Innovative Academic Courses program,
which also includes Freshmen-
Sophomore Seminars and Undergraduate
Special Programs.
The 1984 report stated thet the crea

tion of the lAC was needed to strengthen
SWOPSI.
"There is a broad consensus," the
report said, "that despite enthusiasm for
[ SWOPSI] programs, the material en
countered is less demanding and that the
evaluations used are less rigorous than
those used in regular courses.
"The programs therefore suffer prob
lems of academic legitimacy," the report
said.
All of the former members of the 1984
committee contacted Tuesday said they
could not comment on the status of
SWOPSI today because they had not kept
themselves informed of SWOPSI's con
dition since 1984.
Horn, however, said SWOPSI had
proved its legitimacy. "The issues are
timely," she said. "Innovation and activ
ism are a useful thing."
Dean of Undergraduate Studies
Thomas Wasow, whose office oversees
lAC, agreed. "I have been very impressed
with the care of how the courses are
selected and have been impressed with
the staff and how much attention they
give to quality issues," he said.
Wasow, who has been dean for two
years, also said SWOPSI has not been
without its problems. He said there have

been some courses that should not have
been taught, though he would not name
specific courses.
Last year, a SWOPSI course, "Animal
Rights — or Wrongs?" came under fire
when members of the Biological Sciences
Department wrote a letter criticizing the
nature of the course.
The letter, signed by 30 faculty mem
bers, said: "We object to the instructors
and their inability to meet the funda
mental criteria of an academic forum.
Students should not be taught that these
criteria can be substituted for polemics,
importance of facts, ideological compli
ance, lessons about how to bias a
seemingly unbiased structure, personal
attack and innuendo."
The course's instructors, Lisa Giraud
and Kimbereley Sturla, asked for a
retraction or an apology for the letter.
SWOPSI's problems aside, Wasow
called the program an asset to the Uni
versity. "It is very good to have a locus
for courses and investigations that fall
outside the traditional disciplines," he
said. "It is very much in the tradition of
Stanford to have linkage between aca
demics and action projects in the larger
society."
