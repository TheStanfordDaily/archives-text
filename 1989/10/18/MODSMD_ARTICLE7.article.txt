Another Amnesty concert — here
Stanford will host its own Amnesty Interna
tional concert on Saturday but without the help
of Sting or Tracy Chapman.
In a volunteer effort, five local bands will mu
sically spread Amnesty's message at 8 p.m. on
Wilbur Field in an alcohol-free show of support.
The concert, which will be broadcast on KZSU,
will feature Area One, Cerebral Paisley, Marci
and the Moongods, The Ice Weasels, and Seven
Steel Monkeys.
"We want everyone to have a great time, but
there really is something to be accomplished at
this party," said junior Daniel Rosenberg, one of
the three students planning the concert. "The
aftereffect should be more than just a hangover."
Working with senior Mark Geller, drummer
for the Moongods, and senior Paul Atkins, the
executive director of the Stanford Amnesty In
ternational chapter, Rosenberg said he hopes to
publicize the organization and to generate student
support for its activities.
Concert spectators will be encouraged to sign
petitions and to send postcards to governments
suspected of violating human rights. Atkins will
speak on specific issues, such as the detention
of teenage South African students.
"Publicity is how we build our constituency
and also how we get people out of prison," said
Atkins, who projected that the concert will
generate a broader base of student support. "We
simply want people to realize that there are

crimes against humanity every day, and that they
can stop them."
During the summer, Rosenberg, Geller and
Atkins conceived the idea for an autumn concert,
later deciding to promote a cause at the same
time. They raised some funds from dormitories
and will request $2 donations at the concert.
Any proceeds over the $1,000 expenses will be
donated to the Ivan Morris Fund of Amnesty
International. This fund supplies direct medical
and financial aid to the victims of political re
pression and their families.
