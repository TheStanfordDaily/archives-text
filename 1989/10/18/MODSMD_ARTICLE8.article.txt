### Doug Fine 
A new magazine joined the
ranks of student-run publications
when the Stanford Law and Policy
Review released its first issue yes
terday.
Review co-founder and law stu
dent Craig Arnold said the publi
cation is unique among the three
other Stanford law journals in its
attempt to reach a wider audience
than solely academic law inter
ests.
"We chose an interdisciplinary
approach, which would go beyond
the narrow confines of law and
public policy as individual fields,"
he said.
The journal has no specific
agenda, according to its founders.
Managing board member Sam
Sandmire said the magazine in
tends to cover "any important
issue that our society faces, and
we are committed to all ideological
and disciplinary perspectives."
The debut issue of the maga
zine, which will be published twice
a year, covers such topics as ed
ucation, drugs and the environ
ment.
Although future issues will in

elude student-written articles, the
first issue of the journal contains
articles by Arkansas Governor Bill
Clinton, New Jersey Governor
Tom Kean and University of Cal
ifornia President David Gardner,
among other notables.
Whereas most traditional law
publications concentrate on tech
nical information relating to law,
the magazine gears its content
toward areas of interest to the
general reader as well as to stu
dents.
Arnold summed up the Stan
ford Law and Policy Review's for
mat as: "a medium between a
standard, traditional law review,
which is very dry, and a magazine
you might pick up in a super
market, with an emphasis on the
law journal style."
"We want to reach everybody
who has an interest in law and
public policy issues," Arnold said.
A reception at the Law School
marked the release of the
ceremonial first issue yesterday
afternoon. In addition to much
champagne-popping and photo
taking, Law School Dean Paul
Brest addressed the crowd of
about 50.

In an interview, Brest said, "I
really think it's exciting. . . .
Having academically-related stu
dent organizations is a tremen
dous supplement to the scholastic
cycle of the school."
The journal, conceived by law
students Eduardo Bhatia and
Chip Wood, is completely run by
Stanford law students, from solic
itation of articles through publi
cation, Sandmire said.
The editorial staff is about
evenly split between second- and
third-year law students. Sandfniiv
said that first-year law students
would be sought next quarter.
