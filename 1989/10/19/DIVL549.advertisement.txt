"I love to pig out in the deli.
When my husband isn't cook
ing, I go into Whole Foods and
pick up something for dinner.
Their Thai Noodle Salad is to
die for. We also get a lot of baby
food for our two year old,
Casey. We get her cookies
there, and she loves the pastas
and the salads. For me, it's
more the quality of the foods
and the fact that they taste so
good. The fact that they're
healthy and nutritious is like
icing on the cake."
