### Janine De Fao Senior staff writer 
As teams of structural inspec
tors swept through University
buildings and at least 600
students searched for new homes,
University officials spent much of
yesterday in meetings to evaluate
the damage left by Tuesday's 7.0
earthquake.
At about 5:30 p.m., University
President Donald Kennedy and
other officials decided the Univer
sity would "be open for business
as usual" today, according to Di
rector of University Relations
Stephen Peeps.
Kennedy addressed the campus
community on KZSU at 6 p.m.
He said classes would be held
today except in buildings that had
been deemed unsafe or had not
yet been inspected. Classes in the
unapproved buildings will not
meet until Monday.
Asked to estimate the amount
of damage at Stanford left in the
wake of the nation's second
deadliest earthquake, Kennedy
said, "The adding machines are
moving too fast to read the num
bers right now." He said a pre
liminary estimate puts the
amount "in the many, many tens
of millions of dollars."
No serious injuries occurred on
campus during the quake, and of
ficials said they had not heard of
any injuries to Stanford students
off campus.
Between 5 and 9 p.m. Tuesday,
17 people visited Cowell Student
Health Center with earthquake
related injuries including head

trauma and lacerations. Yester
day, 12 additional people were
treated for minor injuries.
All classes were canceled yes
terday, and most University of
fices were closed. Many buildings
are still not operational today, in
cluding several buildings in the
Quad and both Meyer and Green
Libraries. Library staff will spend
the day reshelving hundreds of
thousands of fallen books.
Parents' Weekend, originally
slated to begin tomorrow, has
been canceled. Officials have not
yet decided if it will be res
cheduled. Saturday's football
game against the University of
Utah will take place, however.
This morning, all buildings
should be labelled with signs clas
sifying them as safe to enter, un
safe and closed, not yet inspected
— in which case the building
should not be entered until further
notice — or open for limited
access.
Faculty and staff with urgent
reasons may enter limited access
