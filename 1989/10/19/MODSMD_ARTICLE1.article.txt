# Damage: 'tens of millions'
## 
### Janine De Fao Senior staff writer 
As teams of structural inspec
tors swept through University
buildings and at least 600
students searched for new homes,
University officials spent much of
yesterday in meetings to evaluate
the damage left by Tuesday's 7.0
earthquake.
At about 5:30 p.m., University
President Donald Kennedy and
other officials decided the Univer
sity would "be open for business
as usual" today, according to Di
rector of University Relations
Stephen Peeps.
Kennedy addressed the campus
community on KZSU at 6 p.m.
He said classes would be held
today except in buildings that had
been deemed unsafe or had not
yet been inspected. Classes in the
unapproved buildings will not
meet until Monday.
Asked to estimate the amount
of damage at Stanford left in the
wake of the nation's second
deadliest earthquake, Kennedy
said, "The adding machines are
moving too fast to read the num
bers right now." He said a pre
liminary estimate puts the
amount "in the many, many tens
of millions of dollars."
No serious injuries occurred on
campus during the quake, and of
ficials said they had not heard of
any injuries to Stanford students
off campus.
Between 5 and 9 p.m. Tuesday,
17 people visited Cowell Student
Health Center with earthquake
related injuries including head

trauma and lacerations. Yester
day, 12 additional people were
treated for minor injuries.
All classes were canceled yes
terday, and most University of
fices were closed. Many buildings
are still not operational today, in
cluding several buildings in the
Quad and both Meyer and Green
Libraries. Library staff will spend
the day reshelving hundreds of
thousands of fallen books.
Parents' Weekend, originally
slated to begin tomorrow, has
been canceled. Officials have not
yet decided if it will be res
cheduled. Saturday's football
game against the University of
Utah will take place, however.
This morning, all buildings
should be labelled with signs clas
sifying them as safe to enter, un
safe and closed, not yet inspected
— in which case the building
should not be entered until further
notice — or open for limited
access.

buildings briefly but should not
stay in these buildings, Kennedy
said. Twenty-two engineering
teams began their investigation
of the more than 400 campus
buildings early yesterday morn
ing.
All University employees are ex
pected to report to work today
but should not enter buildings
that have not been inspected and
labelled as safe.
Among the hardest hit build
ings was Memorial Church. The
stained glass windows survived
the earthquake intact, and there
is no external damage to the
church, according to Dean of the
Chapel Robert Gregg.
But there is "fairly significant"
structural damage inside the
church, where plaster, stone and
glass have fallen. There is also a
possibility that one of the main
arches has suffered "shifting and
weakening," Gregg said.
Gregg added that the building
will not be useful "any time soon."
As a result, church services will
be held in Dinkelspiel Auditorium
this week and next.
Other significant damage was
reported at Geology Corner, En
gineering Corner, Encina Hall,
the Old Chemistry Building and
the Graduate School of Business.
The Stanford Linear Ac
celerator Center was undamaged
by the quake, even though the
two-mile long accelerator runs
right across the San Andreas
fault.
Most of the campus maintained
its power supply throughout the
earthquake, according to Kevin
Lortie, Assistant Shops Manager

at Operations and Maintenance.
Many Row houses were without
power for several hours Tuesday
night, however.
The water situation on campus
has returned to normal, Lortie
said. Shortages Tuesday night and
early Wednesday morning were
the result of a power outage ren
dering the pumps unusable. Stu
dents were told to conserve water
as much as possible Wednesday
morning, but the restrictions were
lifted once the pumps became
operational again.
Stanford Police Capt. Marvin
Moore said there had been no
reports of looting, violence or
other problems. The Emergency
Operations Center responded ef
fectively during the crisis, as in
a drill, he said.
In his address yesterday, Ken
nedy thanked the community for
"their extraordinary response to
a difficult situation." He added
that although the University is
"anx'ous to be back to business
as usual," officials are 'being ap
propriately careful and cautious"
in their decisions.
Kennedy also read a statement
from Provost James Rosse asking
that faculty be lenient about as
signments, papers and exams due
this week.
Top University officials were
not the only ones responding to
problems caused by the quake. A
large part of Tresidder Union was
converted into an earthquake in
formation center yesterday.
About 300 volunteers arrived at
Tresidder yesterday at 2 p.m. to
receive cleanup assignments. At
that time, however, coordinators
did not have jobs for them because
most buildings had not yet been
deemed safe.
Volunteer Central, run by the
Haas Center for Public Service,

took phone numbers of students
willing to be dorm contacts. They
hoped to establish a phone tree
to reach volunteers when needed.
"The turnout is marvelous,"
said Arcadio Morales of the Haas
Center. "Unfortunately, it's like
everyone is dressed up with no
place to go because it is taking
longer than expected to deem
buildings safe," he added.
Upstairs in Oak Lounge, which
is being called the Public Infor
mation Center, staff from Public
Affairs answered phone calls and
referred callers to other sources
when they did not have answers.
The hotline can be reached today
at 723-2862.
Counseling and Psychological
Services, usually located in Cowell
Student Health Center, set up a
drop-in center for counseling in
Tresidder's Aspen Room.
"Even though there is no loss
of life here, people have lost their
homes. There have also been
deaths in the Bay Area. These
events can cause grief, anger and
frustration and people need to
talk about it," said Dr. Alejandro
Martinez, acting director of
CAPS.
He added that few students
visited the drop-in center yester
day, but he said he thought many
students were not aware of the
emergency service. The drop-in
center is open today and will
remain open until it is determined
that it is no longer needed.
Although 15 Row Houses, the
Barnes high-rise in Escondido Vil
lage and Griffin House have all
been closed since the quake, none
of the residents were required to
stay off campus. All students in
these residences were assigned to
stay on campus last night, mainly
in dormitory lounges and Old Pa
vilion.

Tuesday night, however,
housing options were not as well
organized. Many students in
closed residences camped out on
their lawns or found friends to
stay with in safe residences.
Barnes is expected to reopen
late this afternoon, but Griffin
and the 15 affected Row houses
are closed indefinitely.
Temporary housing will proba
bly last for the next two or three
days, according to Diana Conklin,
director of the Row. Residents of
evacuated houses will be informed
this weekend of the long-term
status of their houses.
All unhoused students from the
Row should report at 10 a.m. to
the front of Grove Mayfield to
receive instructions on how to
retrieve their belongings from
closed residences. Students from
Griffin should meet at the Gover
nor's Corner office at 1 p.m. for
the same information.
Students in these residences
have not been able to enter them
since the quake occurred, said
Robin Hensley, project director for
the New Residences Project.
Displaced students are holding
a meeting at 2 p.m. today in front
of Columbae House. According to
two Columbae residents, the pur
pose of the meeting is to discuss
the housing situation and to
brainstorm options. Conklin will
appear at 4 p.m. to listen to the
students' concerns.
"People are upset because they
can't get into their houses, yet
they are expected to be in class
tomorrow morning," Council of
Presidents member David Brown
said last night.

Top University officials were
not the only ones responding to
problems caused by the quake. A
large part of Tresidder Union was
converted into an earthquake in
formation center yesterday.
About 300 volunteers arrived at
Tresidder yesterday at 2 p.m. to
receive cleanup assignments. At
that time, however, coordinators
did not have jobs for them because
most buildings had not yet been
deemed safe.
Volunteer Central, run by the
Haas Center for Public Service,

took phone numbers of students
willing to be dorm contacts. They
hoped to establish a phone tree
to reach volunteers when needed.
"The turnout is marvelous,"
said Arcadio Morales of the Haas
Center. "Unfortunately, it's like
everyone is dressed up with no
place to go because it is taking
longer than expected to deem
buildings safe," he added.
Upstairs in Oak Lounge, which
is being called the Public Infor
mation Center, staff from Public
Affairs answered phone calls and
referred callers to other sources
when they did not have answers.
The hotline can be reached today
at 723-2862.
Counseling and Psychological
Services, usually located in Cowell
Student Health Center, set up a
drop-in center for counseling in
Tresidder's Aspen Room.
"Even though there is no loss
of life here, people have lost their
homes. There have also been
deaths in the Bay Area. These
events can cause grief, anger and
frustration and people need to
talk about it," said Dr. Alejandro
Martinez, acting director of
CAPS.
He added that few students
visited the drop-in center yester
day, but he said he thought many
students were not aware of the
emergency service. The drop-in
center is open today and will
remain open until it is determined
that it is no longer needed.
Although 15 Row Houses, the
Barnes high-rise in Escondido Vil
lage and Griffin House have all
been closed since the quake, none
of the residents were required to
stay off campus. All students in
these residences were assigned to
stay on campus last night, mainly
in dormitory lounges and Old Pa
vilion.

Tuesday night, however,
housing options were not as well
organized. Many students in
closed residences camped out on
their lawns or found friends to
stay with in safe residences.
Barnes is expected to reopen
late this afternoon, but Griffin
and the 15 affected Row houses
are closed indefinitely.
Temporary housing will proba
bly last for the next two or three
days, according to Diana Conklin,
director of the Row. Residents of
evacuated houses will be informed
this weekend of the long-term
status of their houses.
All unhoused students from the
Row should report at 10 a.m. to
the front of Grove Mayfield to
receive instructions on how to
retrieve their belongings from
closed residences. Students from
Griffin should meet at the Gover
nor's Corner office at 1 p.m. for
the same information.
Students in these residences
have not been able to enter them
since the quake occurred, said
Robin Hensley, project director for
the New Residences Project.
Displaced students are holding
a meeting at 2 p.m. today in front
of Columbae House. According to
two Columbae residents, the pur
pose of the meeting is to discuss
the housing situation and to
brainstorm options. Conklin will
appear at 4 p.m. to listen to the
students' concerns.
"People are upset because they
can't get into their houses, yet
they are expected to be in class
tomorrow morning," Council of
Presidents member David Brown
said last night.

As teams of structural inspec

buildings and at least 600
students searched for new homes,
University officials spent much of
yesterday in meetings to evaluate
the damage left by Tuesday's 7.0
earthquake.
At about 5:30 p.m., University
President Donald Kennedy and
other officials decided the Univer
sity would "be open for business
as usual" today, according to Di
rector of University Relations
Stephen Peeps.
Kennedy addressed the campus
community on KZSU at 6 p.m.
He said classes would be held
today except in buildings that had
been deemed unsafe or had not
yet been inspected. Classes in the
unapproved buildings will not
meet until Monday.
Asked to estimate the amount
of damage at Stanford left in the
wake of the nation's second
deadliest earthquake, Kennedy
said, "The adding machines are
moving too fast to read the num
bers right now." He said a pre
liminary estimate puts the
amount "in the many, many tens
of millions of dollars."
No serious injuries occurred on
campus during the quake, and of
ficials said they had not heard of
any injuries to Stanford students
off campus.
Between 5 and 9 p.m. Tuesday,
17 people visited Cowell Student
Health Center with earthquake
related injuries including head

All classes were canceled yes

are still not operational today, in

Quad and both Meyer and Green

Parents' Weekend, originally
slated to begin tomorrow, has
been canceled. Officials have not

This morning, all buildings
should be labelled with signs clas

should not be entered until further
notice — or open for limited

stay in these buildings, Kennedy
said. Twenty-two engineering
teams began their investigation
of the more than 400 campus
buildings early yesterday morn
ing.
All University employees are ex
pected to report to work today
but should not enter buildings
that have not been inspected and
labelled as safe.
Among the hardest hit build
ings was Memorial Church. The
stained glass windows survived
the earthquake intact, and there
is no external damage to the
church, according to Dean of the
Chapel Robert Gregg.
But there is "fairly significant"
structural damage inside the
church, where plaster, stone and
glass have fallen. There is also a
possibility that one of the main
arches has suffered "shifting and
weakening," Gregg said.
Gregg added that the building
will not be useful "any time soon."
As a result, church services will
be held in Dinkelspiel Auditorium
this week and next.
Other significant damage was
reported at Geology Corner, En
gineering Corner, Encina Hall,
the Old Chemistry Building and
the Graduate School of Business.
The Stanford Linear Ac
celerator Center was undamaged
by the quake, even though the
two-mile long accelerator runs
right across the San Andreas
fault.
Most of the campus maintained
its power supply throughout the
earthquake, according to Kevin
Lortie, Assistant Shops Manager

at Operations and Maintenance.
Many Row houses were without
power for several hours Tuesday
night, however.
The water situation on campus
has returned to normal, Lortie
said. Shortages Tuesday night and
early Wednesday morning were
the result of a power outage ren
dering the pumps unusable. Stu
dents were told to conserve water
as much as possible Wednesday
morning, but the restrictions were
lifted once the pumps became
operational again.
Stanford Police Capt. Marvin
Moore said there had been no
reports of looting, violence or
other problems. The Emergency
Operations Center responded ef
fectively during the crisis, as in
a drill, he said.
In his address yesterday, Ken
nedy thanked the community for
"their extraordinary response to
a difficult situation." He added
that although the University is
"anx'ous to be back to business
as usual," officials are 'being ap
propriately careful and cautious"
in their decisions.
Kennedy also read a statement
from Provost James Rosse asking
that faculty be lenient about as

trauma and lacerations. Yester
day, 12 additional people were
treated for minor injuries.
All classes were canceled yes
terday, and most University of
fices were closed. Many buildings
are still not operational today, in
cluding several buildings in the
Quad and both Meyer and Green
Libraries. Library staff will spend
the day reshelving hundreds of
thousands of fallen books.
Parents' Weekend, originally
slated to begin tomorrow, has
been canceled. Officials have not
yet decided if it will be res
cheduled. Saturday's football
game against the University of
Utah will take place, however.
This morning, all buildings
should be labelled with signs clas
sifying them as safe to enter, un
safe and closed, not yet inspected
— in which case the building
should not be entered until further
notice — or open for limited
access.

buildings briefly but should not
stay in these buildings, Kennedy
said. Twenty-two engineering
teams began their investigation
of the more than 400 campus
buildings early yesterday morn
ing.
All University employees are ex
pected to report to work today
but should not enter buildings
that have not been inspected and
labelled as safe.
Among the hardest hit build
ings was Memorial Church. The
stained glass windows survived
the earthquake intact, and there
is no external damage to the
church, according to Dean of the
Chapel Robert Gregg.
But there is "fairly significant"
structural damage inside the
church, where plaster, stone and
glass have fallen. There is also a
possibility that one of the main
arches has suffered "shifting and
weakening," Gregg said.
Gregg added that the building
will not be useful "any time soon."
As a result, church services will
be held in Dinkelspiel Auditorium
this week and next.
Other significant damage was
reported at Geology Corner, En
gineering Corner, Encina Hall,
the Old Chemistry Building and
the Graduate School of Business.
The Stanford Linear Ac
celerator Center was undamaged
by the quake, even though the
two-mile long accelerator runs
right across the San Andreas
fault.
Most of the campus maintained
its power supply throughout the
earthquake, according to Kevin
Lortie, Assistant Shops Manager

at Operations and Maintenance.
Many Row houses were without
power for several hours Tuesday
night, however.
The water situation on campus
has returned to normal, Lortie
said. Shortages Tuesday night and
early Wednesday morning were
the result of a power outage ren
dering the pumps unusable. Stu
dents were told to conserve water
as much as possible Wednesday
morning, but the restrictions were
lifted once the pumps became
operational again.
Stanford Police Capt. Marvin
Moore said there had been no
reports of looting, violence or
other problems. The Emergency
Operations Center responded ef
fectively during the crisis, as in
a drill, he said.
In his address yesterday, Ken
nedy thanked the community for
"their extraordinary response to
a difficult situation." He added
that although the University is
"anx'ous to be back to business
as usual," officials are 'being ap
propriately careful and cautious"
in their decisions.
Kennedy also read a statement
from Provost James Rosse asking
that faculty be lenient about as
signments, papers and exams due
this week.
Top University officials were
not the only ones responding to
problems caused by the quake. A
large part of Tresidder Union was
converted into an earthquake in
formation center yesterday.
About 300 volunteers arrived at
Tresidder yesterday at 2 p.m. to
receive cleanup assignments. At
that time, however, coordinators
did not have jobs for them because
most buildings had not yet been
deemed safe.
Volunteer Central, run by the
Haas Center for Public Service,

took phone numbers of students
willing to be dorm contacts. They
hoped to establish a phone tree
to reach volunteers when needed.
"The turnout is marvelous,"
said Arcadio Morales of the Haas
Center. "Unfortunately, it's like
everyone is dressed up with no
place to go because it is taking
longer than expected to deem
buildings safe," he added.
Upstairs in Oak Lounge, which
is being called the Public Infor
mation Center, staff from Public
Affairs answered phone calls and
referred callers to other sources
when they did not have answers.
The hotline can be reached today
at 723-2862.
Counseling and Psychological
Services, usually located in Cowell
Student Health Center, set up a
drop-in center for counseling in
Tresidder's Aspen Room.
"Even though there is no loss
of life here, people have lost their
homes. There have also been
deaths in the Bay Area. These
events can cause grief, anger and
frustration and people need to
talk about it," said Dr. Alejandro
Martinez, acting director of
CAPS.
He added that few students
visited the drop-in center yester
day, but he said he thought many
students were not aware of the
emergency service. The drop-in
center is open today and will
remain open until it is determined
that it is no longer needed.
Although 15 Row Houses, the
Barnes high-rise in Escondido Vil
lage and Griffin House have all
been closed since the quake, none
of the residents were required to
stay off campus. All students in
these residences were assigned to
stay on campus last night, mainly
in dormitory lounges and Old Pa
vilion.

Tuesday night, however,
housing options were not as well
organized. Many students in
closed residences camped out on
their lawns or found friends to
stay with in safe residences.
Barnes is expected to reopen
late this afternoon, but Griffin
and the 15 affected Row houses
are closed indefinitely.
Temporary housing will proba
bly last for the next two or three
days, according to Diana Conklin,
director of the Row. Residents of
evacuated houses will be informed
this weekend of the long-term
status of their houses.
All unhoused students from the
Row should report at 10 a.m. to
the front of Grove Mayfield to
receive instructions on how to
retrieve their belongings from
closed residences. Students from
Griffin should meet at the Gover
nor's Corner office at 1 p.m. for
the same information.
Students in these residences
have not been able to enter them
since the quake occurred, said
Robin Hensley, project director for
the New Residences Project.
Displaced students are holding
a meeting at 2 p.m. today in front
of Columbae House. According to
two Columbae residents, the pur
pose of the meeting is to discuss
the housing situation and to
brainstorm options. Conklin will
appear at 4 p.m. to listen to the
students' concerns.
"People are upset because they
can't get into their houses, yet
they are expected to be in class
tomorrow morning," Council of
Presidents member David Brown
said last night.
