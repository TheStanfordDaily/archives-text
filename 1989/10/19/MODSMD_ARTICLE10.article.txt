## Space shuttle launched

CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) - Space shuttle
Atlantis finally lifted ofT yesterday on its controver
sial mission to send the nuclear-powered Galileo
probe to Jupiter for the closest look yet at the
colossus of the solar system.
"You looked marvelous going up," Mission Control
told commander Don Williams as the winged
spacecraft reached orbit after two launch postpone
ments.
"I feel a lot better," said Williams.
The Galileo's troubles — including money prob
lems over the years and recent protests over its
nuclear power supply — were left behind, and the
probe was ready to begin its six-year, 2.4 billion-mile
roundabout journey to Jupiter.
The astronauts were to release the probe from
Atlantis' cargo bay later in the day. The shuttle
circled Earth at an altitude of 184 miles.
Although concern over the Galileo's 49.4-pound
plutonium power supply was argued in court, it
drew no protesters to the Kennedy Space Center on
launch day. Environmentalists had argued that a
Challenger-like accident could scatter deadly
plutonium-238 over Florida.
Nothing like that happened yesterday, and even
the weather cooperated. Clouds and rain threatened
to halt the launch until the last minutes of the
countdown, but the clouds suddenly dissipated and
the shuttle darted into a bright blue sky, trailing
a 700-foot geyser of fire.
The 132-ton Atlantis has a crew of five for the
mission that ends Monday with a landing at Edwards
Air Force Base in California at 2:38 p.m. EDT.
The $1.5 billion mission already was seven years
behind schedule when Atlantis was grounded by

rain at the last minute Tuesday and by a faulty
engine computer last week.
"It feels great," said NASA chief scientist Lennard
Fisk after liftofT. "It's been a long time."
Williams' crew consists of pilot Mike McCulley
and mission specialists Ellen Baker, Franklin
Chang-Diaz and Shannon Lucid.
The liftoff was the start of a voyage that will
take the probe on a looping path past Venus in
February, back to within 620 miles of Earth in
December 1990 and past Earth again at a 200-mile
altitude two years later. The craft will arrive at
Jupiter in December 1995 for a two-year orbit.
As part of the mission, a rouot will separate from
the Galileo spacecraft and plunge through Jupiter's
gaseous atmosphere.
Scientists hope to gain insight into the birth of
the solar system by studying Jupiter, which holds
original material from that event 14 billion years
ago. The planet's radius is 11 times that of Earth
and its mass 318 times greater.
The mission originally was to have started in
1982, but money ran out. Then came the Challenger
explosion in January 1986, delaying all shuttle
flights for three years and prompting a change in
the rocket to propel the Galileo.
The mission originally was budgeted at $425 mil
lion. It will climb to $1.9 billion by the time Galileo
finishes a 10-orbit trip around Jupiter in 1997.
The sweeps past Earth and Venus will take ad
vantage of the planets' gravity to accelerate the
spacecraft to the proper speed to reach its distant
target. Small onboard motors will fine-tune the
flight path.

The space shuttle Atlantis waits on the launch pad for the weather to clear for launch. Weather
cleared moments before the flight window closed and the shuttle successfully launched into orbit
yesterday.
