# East German leader ousted
## 
### 
BERLIN (AP) — East German
leader Erich Honecker was
stripped of power yesterday, end
ing 18 years of iron-fisted rule as
the government grapples with
growing public demands for a
freer society.
State news media said the Com
munist Party hierarchy replaced
its 77-year-old leader with Egon
Krenz, a Honecker protege and
the youngest member of the
ruling Politburo.
Honecker, who directed the
building of the Berlin Wall in
1961, also will be relieved of his
largely ceremonial post as head
of state and as chief of the mili
tary, the government-run news
agency ADN said.
ADN said Krenz, 52, in charge
of security issues and
government-run youth groups, al
ready had taken over as the party
chief and would be recommended
for the posts as military chief and
head of state.
The latter two require the ap
proval of the nation's Parliament,
and that is guaranteed by the
strong central control of the gov
ernment.
Krenz, like Honecker, is consid
ered a Communist hard-liner.
However, he signaled a softer
stance when he reportedly urged
police to stop their harsh crack
down on the thousands of people
who have been staging protests in
recent weeks.
Two other key members of the
ruling Politburo lost their posi
tions.
Politburo member Joachim
Herrmann, 60, who was in charge
of the nation's media, and Guenter
Mittag, 63, the architect of East
Germany's economic policy, "were

relieved of their functions," ADN
reported.
ADN said both men had also
lost their posts on the Communist
Party's 163-member Central Com
mittee and 21-member Politburo,
and Mittag will be relieved of his
duties as deputy head of state.
The move was an apparent at
tempt to placate growing public
demands for a freer press and
economic reforms.

'We hope that in the
interest of our
countrymen that the
reform process ... will
finally get its chance
in East Germany.'
Helmut Kohl

The change in leadership comes
as East Germany is still reeling
from the exodus in recent months
of tens of thousands of its citizens
seeking better wages and more
freedoms in the West. The flight
has been followed by public dissent
unprecedented under in this Com
munist country.
In Washington, President Bush
said Krenz' rise to power was un
likely to signal fundamental
change.
"Whether that reflects a change
in East-West relations, I don't
think so," he said. "Mr. Krentz
has been very much in accord with
the policies of Honecker. So it's
too early to say."
In Bonn, West German Chan

cellor Helmut Kohl welcomed the
leadership change and said he
hoped Krenz would "make the
way free" for a better life for East
Germans.
"We hope that in the interest
of our countrymen that the
reform process that has been so
sympathetically received in
Poland and Hungary and also in
the Soviet Union will finally get
its chance in East Germany as
well," Kohl told reporters.
ADN said that Honecker asked
to be relieved of his official duties
for "health reasons." Honecker
has reportedly been in ill health
following a gall bladder operation
in August.
But Honecker had been under
pressure to resign after a wave of
protests swept the country.
His ouster came after the Polit
buro began meeting yesterday.
That meeting was followed today
by a gathering of the Central Com
mittee of the party, which must
approve Politburo decisions.
Krenz has long been rumored
to be the choice to succeed
Honecker and holds many of his
hard-line views.
However, Communist Party
sources also said it was Krenz's
decision to ask police to stop at
tacking demonstrators after au
thorities charged protesters and
brutally beat them earlier this
month in East Berlin and Dres
den.
Since early October, tens of
thousands of people fed up with
the tightly controlled society have
taken to the streets to demand
reforms including free elections
and a free press.

has been very much in accord with
the policies of Honecker. So it's
too early to say."
In Bonn, West German Chan

cellor Helmut Kohl welcomed the
leadership change and said he
hoped Krenz would "make the
way free" for a better life for East
Germans.
"We hope that in the interest
of our countrymen that the
reform process that has been so
sympathetically received in
Poland and Hungary and also in
the Soviet Union will finally get
its chance in East Germany as
well," Kohl told reporters.
ADN said that Honecker asked
to be relieved of his official duties
for "health reasons." Honecker
has reportedly been in ill health
following a gall bladder operation
in August.
But Honecker had been under
pressure to resign after a wave of
protests swept the country.
His ouster came after the Polit
buro began meeting yesterday.
That meeting was followed today
by a gathering of the Central Com
mittee of the party, which must
approve Politburo decisions.
Krenz has long been rumored
to be the choice to succeed
Honecker and holds many of his
hard-line views.
However, Communist Party
sources also said it was Krenz's
decision to ask police to stop at
tacking demonstrators after au
thorities charged protesters and
brutally beat them earlier this
month in East Berlin and Dres
den.
Since early October, tens of
thousands of people fed up with
the tightly controlled society have
taken to the streets to demand
reforms including free elections
and a free press.
