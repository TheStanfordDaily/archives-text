Hungary renamed
BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) — In the glare of
TV lights, Parliament changed the country's com
munist name and created a democratic system
yesterday by adopting key constitutional amend
ments.
Amendments formally ending one-party domi
nation in Hungary, regulating free elections by
next summer and creating the office of state
president won overwhelming approval at the na
tionally televised session of Parliament.
The country was renamed the Republic of Hun
gary. Like other Soviet bloc nations, it had been
known as a "people's republic" since 1949.
But the chamber stalled on one key move
toward democracy, postponing a decision on op
position calls for a referendum on when to elect
the head of state. Government leaders want the
election next month, but opposition leaders say
it's too ftoon.
Nonetheless, speaker of Parliament Matyas
Szueros, who takes over as acting president until
a new head of state is elected, proclaimed yes
terday a historic day for Hungary.
"A parliamentary democracy and a legal state
is being built in Hungary on the ruins of a
dictatorship of sorts," Szueros reportedly told
the Yugoslav news agency Tanjug.
The voting came on the heels of another
landmark decision — the dissolution of the com
munist party and its replacement by the Hun
garian Socialist Party, which vows commitment
to a democratic system while continuing for the
moment to dominate national politics.
Civil Rights Chair resigns
WASHINGTON (AP) - The White House
yesterday belatedly revealed that President Bush
has accepted the resignation of William Barclay
Allen as chairman of the U.S. Commission on
Civil Rights.
Allen, a California professor, had sparked
repeated controversies during his tenure atop the
embattled commission.

The most recent came less than two weeks ago
when he gave a speech he titled, "Blacks?
Animals? Homosexuals? What is a Minority?" to
the California Coalition for Traditional Values.
The six other commission members voted to
disassociate themselves from the speech, saying
the title was "thoughtless, disgusting and un
necessarily inflammatory."
Allen, a professor of government at the
Claremont Graduate School in California, had
offered his resignation some time ago, but Bush
did not formally accept it until Monday.
Chase Untermeyer, the White House personnel
director who confirmed the action, said Murray
Friedman, the vice chairman, will be acting chair
man.
Cease-fire agreement close
WASHINGTON (AP) - Rebel leader Jonas
Savimbi said yesterday he is optimistic that a
cease-fire agreement with Angola's Mafxist gov
ernment can be revived before the end of the
month.
Savimbi, speaking in a telephone interview with
The Associated Press from the Ivory Coast, also
said there was a good possibility for a mutual
release of war prisoners with the government.
The Angolan peace process had been stalled
following what appeared to be a breakthrough
last June between Savimbi's UNITA rebel, who
receive U.S. backing, and the Soviet-supported
government. Among other measures, the two
sides reached agreement on a cease-fire to end
their 14-year conflict.
But fighting resumed within weeks, and
Savimbi felt that the chief peace mediator, Pres
ident Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire, was taking
sides with the MPLA government. There also
were recriminations about whether Savimbi had
agreed to go into exile and to integrate his forces
into the Angolan army.
Savimbi patched up his differences with
Mobutu during weekend meetings in Paris fol
lowing discussions in Washington, and he
sounded more upbeat Wednesday than he has at
any time since the breakthrough in June.
