## Down to earth 
### 
After the quake, we
give thanks and see
true value of life

An EARTHQUAKE IS a
great equalizer. When the
earth starts shaking, and
buildings start swaying, it forces
everyone — regardless of back
ground or status — to grapple with
the fundamental questions of life.
Times of adversity test the char
acter of a people, and the Bay Area
rose to the occasion Tuesday.
When a 50-ft. section of the Bay
Bridge broke loose and damaged
some cars, other drivers leapt from
their cars to help rescue those
trapped by the falling debris.
After a building collapsed in San
Francisco, a woman led an im
promptu rescue team into the
rubble to uncover people and pull
them to safety.
In response to the tragic collapse
of Highway 880, local residents
poured out of their homes and
helped free those people they could
and rushed them to the hospital.
At Stanford, we were lucky. No
serious injuries were reported in
what was the worst earthquake
since 1906.
The money spent on the renova
tion of Roble appears to have been
well-spent in that the building
emerged with minimal damage.
Unfortunately, many of the Row
Houses did not fare so well, and
we should consider providing a
Roble-type renovation for the Row.
All in all, though, Stanford's struc
tures held up well.
Given that the devastating Ar
menian earthquake, which took
more than 20,000 lives, was
smaller than Tuesday's 7.0, and

the fact that more lives weren't
lost, is a testament to Bay Area
engineers and builders. The people
who constructed the bridges, roads
and buildings of the area deserve
our profound thanks and grati
tude.
After the immediate fear of
dying, the trembling relief of sur
viving, and the agonizing efforts
to reach loved ones and calm their
fears, you are forced to put every
thing else into perspective.
Papers and problem sets are not
really major causes of worry after
all. A grade in a Stanford class
diminishes in significance com
pared to the possiblity that a class
room could collapse in an instant.
Consideration of future occupa
tions becomes balanced with
thoughts about how to make our
time here as meaningful as possi
ble. As the A's and Giants so rightly
concluded in deciding to postpone
the World Series, baseball is just
an insignificant game when com
pared to the struggle to survive.
Some have compared the post
earthquake Bay Area to a war
zone. Bridges have been shut
down, schools and businesses are
closed, and hundreds of people sud
denly found themselves without
homes.
This state of affairs has
prompted President Bush to
declare the Bay Area a disaster
area, and Oct. 17 will always live
in our memories as an historic day.
Yet, around the world, many
people live like that every day. In
the Middle East, in El Salvador,
in Southern Africa, millions of
people struggle to find hope, mean
ing and love amid real war zones.
As we return to our studies, let
us do so with an added apprecia
tion for the lives of others and a
renewed determination to make
our brief sojourn here worthwhile.
