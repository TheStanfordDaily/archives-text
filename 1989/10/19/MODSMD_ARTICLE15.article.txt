Students with disabilities part of multiculturalism

I WOULD LIKE TO thank The
Daily for its four-part series last
week on students with disabilities
at Stanford. However, some informa
tion presented on national legislation
should be clarified.
The Rehabilitation Act of 1973
mandated non-discrimination and a
variety of accessibility standards for
institutions receiving federal funding
(which includes Stanford). The Act has
several sections; Section 504 is directly
applicable to access for university
students with disabilities.
Regulations for Section 504 were not
promulgated until 1977. As your article
pointed out, many institutions in 1989

still have a long way to go before
achieving compliance.
We believe that Stanford is easily
within the letter of the law, but the
spirit of "full accessibility" — like that
of "pluralism" — requires ongoing
attention and definition.
The Daily article also referred to
new national legislation — which is
termed the Americans with Disabilities
Act of 1989. The ADA would require
non-discrimination in employment and
other activities even for non-recipients
of federal funding (except for those
with less than 25 employees).
In that sense, it more closely paral
lels earlier civil rights legislation for

women and people of color. Because of
the existence of Section 504, this
would not directly affect Stanford, but
it has profound implications for dis
abled people across the country.
Contrary to the suggestions in the
article, the ADA has not yet been
signed into law. It passed in the Sen
ate earlier this year — with endorse
ment from the Bush Administration —
but is still under consideration in
several House committees.
Its prospects are fairly good, but the
ADA is presently under challenge from
influential business interests. We wel
come anyone interested in more infor
mation about the ADA to contact the

Disability Resource Center.
As The Daily's concluding editorial
conveyed, all of these regulations —
and the University's efforts to develop
accessibility — are ultimately means to
a larger ends.
Elimination of environmental bar
riers, allowing full and legitimate
participation, provides opportunities for
self-expression with — not in spite of
— a disability.
This is the essence of pluralism, and
people with disabilities are beginning
to define our part in Stanford's multi
cultural community.
