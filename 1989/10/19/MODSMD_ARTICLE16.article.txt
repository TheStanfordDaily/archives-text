# Police hide behind riot charges to cloud real issue
## 
### 
As a witness of, but not a partici
pant in, last spring's sit-in I have been
confused about the debate surrounding
Louis Jackson. Is he being singled out
because he's an African-American?
Maybe, though I expect that the
Santa Clara County police must be
afraid of becoming the focus of na
tional attention by turning the routine
prosecution of a sit-in into a civil
rights case.
If they're not afraid, they should be,
because Jackson's defenders are doing
everything they can to make this a
civil rights case, as is their right.
But why are the police and the As
sistant District Attorney so keen on
setting themselves up for a dangerous
court battle which they could lose? I
think the key is in the charge: "incite
ment to riot."
The battery charge — allegedly com
mitted against receptionist Mandy

McCalla, who has said she has no com
plaint — has not been dropped by the
district attorney because the so-called
"unlawful touching" (whatever that is)
allegedly took place during a riot.
Now all the people who were there,
including McCalla, the other university
staff and the police know there was no
riot. It was a sit-in. People have dealt
with sit-ins before; they know the
rules.
Why, then, the continued assertion
that there was a riot, or threat of riot
or incitement to riot?
Because only by charging that there
was a riot can the Santa Clara police
justify their extreme overreaction to a
nonviolent act of civil disobedience.
The police have to blame somebody
for the tension that they themselves
caused, and that somebody is Louis
Jackson, who happened to be very
visible during the moments of greatest
confrontation.
University President Donald Kennedy
doesn't want to get involved because if
he admits there was no riot, then he
will have to explain the decision to call
so many police in the first place.
Louis Jackson is the victim of in
competent people trying to save their

faces and their future promotions.
Race may not have been an issue.
However, if his defense succeeds in
painting the police and the district
attorney as racist, those faces and pro
motions might take a far worse
beating than they would have if they
hadn't tried to make a mountain out
of a molehill in the first place. Maybe
they deserve it.
