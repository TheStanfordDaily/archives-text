# Health insurance rips students off and ignores needs
## 
### 
I have always considered that all
insurance companies want is to take
our money and not give us anything in
return. What I don't understand is
why we, the consumers, are so incredi
bly passive in the face of this amazing
rip-off?
It seems to me that as a consumer
group, the Stanford students represent
quite a large market for some insur-

ance carrier. We are required to have
insurance if we want to register, so it
seems that this would be a desirable
account for an insurance company to
have.
As a generally young and healthy
population, we also represent minimal
risk to a health insurance company. So
it would make sense that we, as a
group, should be able to negotiate a
decent policy in which we pay money
and get services.
I think that it is safe to say that the
two main items that most students
really need, as far as basic health care
goes, include dental care and optical
care.
Isn't it interesting that these two
items are explicitly excluded from the
care that we can get with our "health
insurance" policy.
I don't plan to be at Stanford a lot
longer, but I certainly hope that in the
not-too-distant future, the person who
finds these great insurance deals for
students wakes up and recognizes that
the client she or he is supposed to be
serving is the students, and not the
insurance companies.
