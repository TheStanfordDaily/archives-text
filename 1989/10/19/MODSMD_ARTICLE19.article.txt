## Reflections on the quake 
### 
ABOUT 5 O'CLOCK, Tuesday af
ternoon, in the dorm's computer
cluster. "Damn. I'm not going to
make it."
I was supposed to finish my column
and have it to the Daily by 5, and it
looked like my procrastination had finally
caught up with me. I was in the middle
of highlighting a sentence that just didn't
fit, ready to rub it out from the face of
the earth when, well, when the face of
the earth started to move.
Like always, it seemed like a truck
driving by, except there wasn't any road
nearby, much less a truck large enough
to do what yesterday's quake did.
Should I duck and cover? Will it look
cool? These are the thoughts that always
go through my mind as an earthquake
starts. It's never cool to do what your
second grade teacher told you to do.
I looked at the two other people in the
room as the windows overhead rattled.
Screw looking cool. Who cares how I look
if they're pulling my body from the
rubble.
Ducking under the desk, I hit my nose
on the crossbar. Dang it! The first injury
of the quake and it's me, the idiot that
didn't look before jumping under a table.
A couple of minutes later, with the
fire alarms blaring across campus, we
left the building. Everyone met outside
at that red dot, exchanging quips about
where they were or what they were doing
when it hit. We joked about Hoover Tower
looking like it was shorter and about
running over to see if all the work on
Roble was really worth it.
Classes were canceled, books fell off

shelves and buildings cracked and moved.
I didn't go to my chemistry section that
night, partly because the building was
probably closed, but mainly because I
had to find out if my brother at Berkeley,
my sister here and my parents and
brother in San Jose were all OK.
I had heard that the quake was cen
tered 20 miles south of San Jose, and I
wasn't sure if my parents knew how to
turn the gas off. It's sort of funny. I
don't normally call home just to see if
my parents are OK, not to mention to
find out if they know how to turn the
gas off.
I guess that's one of the messages. In
a crisis situation, you don't take all the
things for granted that you do every day.
Before, my big concern was getting
caught up in biology and finishing that
thermodynamics problem set. Now it was
if my family had made it home safely.
Everyone seemed to have a different
perspective. People were actually happy
eating the dinner that Food Service had
set up for us behind Florence Moore Hall.
Who would have thought that we could
be so content to eat off paper plates while
sitting on the asphalt, right next to a set
of dumpsters? Who would have imagined
that so many people would be so cheery
about spending the night in Old Pavilion?
No one really complained, at least not
seriously.
Today, as we get more and more reports
of the climbing death toll, the destruc
tion, chaos and looting that have followed
this catastrophe, we are hit hard with
the reality of all of this.
It's serious, and we shouldn't joke too

much about it. I suppose that this time
most of us got off easy, with just a good
scare and a reminder to stop and look
around once in awhile.
In more ways than one, we don't really
have control over our little corner of the
universe. There's a lot out there that we
don't appreciate, that just may come tum
bling down someday.
