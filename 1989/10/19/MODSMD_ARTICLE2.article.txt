# Heroic patient evacuation at Veteran's Med Center
## 
### Jock Friedly Editorial staff 
In perhaps the greatest local
display of heroism and tragedy
in Tuesday's earthquake, more
than 100 patients were
evacuated from the Veteran's
Administration Medical Center
in Palo Alto, where dozens of
scientists lost years of research.
The quake violently rocked
the six-story Building 1 of the
VA Hospital, which houses
many research projects of the
Stanford Medical Center. All
patients were evacuated within
20 minutes. Doctors, research
ers, students and staff carried
the patients down stairs on
their mattresses or in their
wheelchairs as soon as the
quake subsided.
Andrew Hoffman, chief of
medicine at the hospital, said
the rescue was a "spectacular
feat." The patients stayed the
night at another VA Hospital
building.
Researchers speculated that
the building, which appeared
to have major structural
damage and was filled with
toxic chemicals, will never
house patients or research
again.

On the top floor of the build
ing, which contains most of
Stanford's research projects,
laboratories were completely
destroyed, transforming the
entire area into a dusty, toxic
mess.
In several labs, toxic chemi
cals and several inches of shat
tered glassware covered the
floor.
Irene Wu, a senior who was
working in a sixth-floor lab
when the quake hit, said the
desk she was hiding under slid
around during the tremor. She
said glassware rained down ev
erywhere and water and chemi
cal solutions made a pool about
one-half inch deep on the floor.
Fumes from spilled concen
trated acid eventually filled the
air, making it difficult to
breathe. Nobody was reported
injured in the earthquake, but
the sixth floor has been sealed
off.
Millions of dollars of research
may have been destroyed in the
earthquake, but no estimates
were available.
Dozens of researchers are left
without laboratories, and
nobody yet knows if research
ers will ever be able to return
to the laboratories.
