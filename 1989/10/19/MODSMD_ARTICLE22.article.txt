# Volleyball canceled
## 
### 
Because of Tuesday's earth
quake this week's Holiday Inn
Stanford Invitational volleyball
tournament that was to be
hosted by the women's volleyball
team at Maples Pavilion has
been canceled.
Notre Dame, UC-Santa Bar
bara, New Mexico and Stanford
were scheduled to compete in
the tournament, which was to
be played tonight and tomorrow
night. Athletic officials at Notre
Dame and New Mexico decided
yesterday to not send their
teams. Both were supposed to
fly into the Bay Area but derided
not to once the difficulties with
transportation in and out of the
area became evident.
UC-Santa Barbara, which was
going to drive to Stanford for
the tournament, chose not to at
tend once Notre Dame and New
Mexico canceled. The tourna
ment will not be replayed this
season.
"It's probably just as well that
those teams don't have to travel
into the area," Stanford Coach
Don Shaw said. "There are too
many other problems going on.
They're just volleyball games.
There are a lot more important
things."
Although there was some
damage at Maples, Shaw said
the tournament could have been
held in Old Pavilion, where only
minor damage, none of which
affected the playing or spectator
areas, occured.
