# Sweeper Semioli won't rest yet
## 
### Alex Cronin 
Stanford sweeper Mark Semioli is des
tined to play professional soccer, but
the Cardinal's defensive stopper won't
let high hopes for the future distract
from his senior season.
At a tenacious 6-feet and 175 pounds,
Semioli anchors the defense and directs
blitzkrieg counter-attacks for Stanford.
A prospective Ail-American, it would be
easy for him to look past his final col
legiate year, but Semioli is enjoying his
last season on the Farm.
"I play soccer because of the guys on
the team. Of course you always want
to win, but the guys on the team make
the difference," he said.
Many of Semioli's teammates have
lived and played with him for several
years and he still lives with some of
his freshmen dorm-mates from Florence
Moore.
Off the field Semioli is noted for his
humility and an easy-going demeanor.
A political science major interested in
international relations and law, he
carries a professional attitude toward
soccer which keeps him from getting
caught up in the sport.
But on the field, Semioli's explosive
ness has earned him national honors
and a future in professional soccer.
"Mark Semioli is one of the best
players in Stanford's history and one
of the best I've ever coached," said
Coach Sam Koch.
"He's the most solid, error-free per
son," added Allen Thorpe, a Stanford
teammate.
He played with the San Francisco
Black Hawks in a semi-pro league last
spring and plans to play professional
soccer this January. "The difference be

tween pro and amateur soccer is night
and day," said Semioli. "The Black
Hawks taught me how much more I
have to learn," he said.
Yet, despite his high ranking in the
soccer world, he concentrates 100 per
cent when he plays with the Cardinal.
"Stanford's team offers as much oppor
tunity as any for an individual to excel,"
said Semioli.
Coach Sam Koch developed a defen
sive system to capitalize on Semioli's
strengths and close teamwork. The sys
tem allows Semioli to take the ball from
back to front while Tim Keyes, Rhett
Harty or another midfielder stays back
to cover for him.
"The system works very well," said
Harty. "The freshmen on the team are
fortunate to learn the system while
Semioli is on the team."
They realize, as assistant coach
Donoson Fitzgerald said, "Semioli is ef
fective and explosive as an offensive
force when he has the opportunity to
come up the field," so they work to
gether to cover for each other. They
have a keen understanding of each
other's game.
Semioli is the key to the Cardinal
defense in more ways than one. He must
reads plays and cut off passing angles,
and, as sweeper he is the last line of
defense before the goalie.
In an incredible play against Indiana
three weeks ago, Semioli was behind
the goalie, and headed a shot to the
upper corner out from the goal. What
makes Semioli "head and shoulders
above Agoos (one of the next best
sweepers in the nation) is his ability to
do anything," said Chris Helling, Stan
ford's starting goalie. "Our defensive
system works because he can attack so

well."
"Everyone looks up to Semioli, both
for his ability and the way he handles
himself on and off the field," said
Fitzgerald.
Semioli plans to join the Western Soc
cer League, a developing professional
league, next January. He will play with
the Black Hawks in their first year as
a professional team with players on con
tract. At this level, "people practice for
two hours at their absolute best every
day," said Semioli.
"The practice is one hundred times
faster than you can conceive before you
step on the field," Semioli said.
Helling said he feels "one hundred
and fifty percent better," when Semioli
is on the field in front of him. "I feed
about seventy percent of my passes to
him simply because he's in a good
positon and plays so well," added Hel
ling. Without a question Semioli takes
all the penalty kicks for the Stanford.
For a period last Spring, Semioli
trained with both the Black Hawks and
the Stanford Cardinal. He sometimes
put eight hours of training into a day
between both practices and weight
lifting.
"I was in the best soccer shape I had
ever been last spring," he said. Yet he
never regards practice as a grind.
Rather, he said, "It's a huge commit
ment. It cuts down on a lot of time for
extracurriculars. But at a state school,
I would have to miss even more in order
to play soccer."
Harty, who worked with the Black
Hawks later in their season, had feared
Semioli would burn out playing with
both teams, "but Semioli was always
ready and wanted to play."

"He's the most solid, error-free per
son," added Allen Thorpe, a Stanford
teammate.
He played with the San Francisco
Black Hawks in a semi-pro league last
spring and plans to play professional
soccer this January. "The difference be

tween pro and amateur soccer is night
and day," said Semioli. "The Black
Hawks taught me how much more I
have to learn," he said.
Yet, despite his high ranking in the
soccer world, he concentrates 100 per
cent when he plays with the Cardinal.
"Stanford's team offers as much oppor
tunity as any for an individual to excel,"
said Semioli.
Coach Sam Koch developed a defen
sive system to capitalize on Semioli's
strengths and close teamwork. The sys
tem allows Semioli to take the ball from
back to front while Tim Keyes, Rhett
Harty or another midfielder stays back
to cover for him.
"The system works very well," said
Harty. "The freshmen on the team are
fortunate to learn the system while
Semioli is on the team."
They realize, as assistant coach
Donoson Fitzgerald said, "Semioli is ef
fective and explosive as an offensive
force when he has the opportunity to
come up the field," so they work to
gether to cover for each other. They
have a keen understanding of each
other's game.
Semioli is the key to the Cardinal
defense in more ways than one. He must
reads plays and cut off passing angles,
and, as sweeper he is the last line of
defense before the goalie.
In an incredible play against Indiana
three weeks ago, Semioli was behind
the goalie, and headed a shot to the
upper corner out from the goal. What
makes Semioli "head and shoulders
above Agoos (one of the next best
sweepers in the nation) is his ability to
do anything," said Chris Helling, Stan
ford's starting goalie. "Our defensive
system works because he can attack so

well."
"Everyone looks up to Semioli, both
for his ability and the way he handles
himself on and off the field," said
Fitzgerald.
Semioli plans to join the Western Soc
cer League, a developing professional
league, next January. He will play with
the Black Hawks in their first year as
a professional team with players on con
tract. At this level, "people practice for
two hours at their absolute best every
day," said Semioli.
"The practice is one hundred times
faster than you can conceive before you
step on the field," Semioli said.
Helling said he feels "one hundred
and fifty percent better," when Semioli
is on the field in front of him. "I feed
about seventy percent of my passes to
him simply because he's in a good
positon and plays so well," added Hel
ling. Without a question Semioli takes
all the penalty kicks for the Stanford.
For a period last Spring, Semioli
trained with both the Black Hawks and
the Stanford Cardinal. He sometimes
put eight hours of training into a day
between both practices and weight
lifting.
"I was in the best soccer shape I had
ever been last spring," he said. Yet he
never regards practice as a grind.
Rather, he said, "It's a huge commit
ment. It cuts down on a lot of time for
extracurriculars. But at a state school,
I would have to miss even more in order
to play soccer."
Harty, who worked with the Black
Hawks later in their season, had feared
Semioli would burn out playing with
both teams, "but Semioli was always
ready and wanted to play."

Wings spread for combat, senior sweeper Mark Semioll vectors toward an intruding
opponent with jet-fighter reflexes and tenacity. Semioli is the last line of defense
before goalie Chris Helling.
Stanford sweeper Mark Semioli is des
tined to play professional soccer, but
the Cardinal's defensive stopper won't
let high hopes for the future distract
from his senior season.
At a tenacious 6-feet and 175 pounds,
Semioli anchors the defense and directs
blitzkrieg counter-attacks for Stanford.
A prospective Ail-American, it would be
easy for him to look past his final col
legiate year, but Semioli is enjoying his
last season on the Farm.
"I play soccer because of the guys on
the team. Of course you always want
to win, but the guys on the team make
the difference," he said.
Many of Semioli's teammates have
lived and played with him for several
years and he still lives with some of
his freshmen dorm-mates from Florence
Moore.
Off the field Semioli is noted for his
humility and an easy-going demeanor.
A political science major interested in
international relations and law, he
carries a professional attitude toward
soccer which keeps him from getting
caught up in the sport.
But on the field, Semioli's explosive
ness has earned him national honors
and a future in professional soccer.
"Mark Semioli is one of the best
players in Stanford's history and one
of the best I've ever coached," said
Coach Sam Koch.
"He's the most solid, error-free per
son," added Allen Thorpe, a Stanford
teammate.
He played with the San Francisco
Black Hawks in a semi-pro league last
