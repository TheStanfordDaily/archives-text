# Athletes of the Week
## 
### 
Whoever said the third time is a charm
was off by one. For this week's Athletes of
the Week, the second time is the good one.
Making their second appearence each in
the winners' circle are Elise Edwards of
the women's soccer team and Alex O'Brien
of the men's tennis team.
Edwards, a 5-foot-ll junior goalkeeper
from Madison, Wis., held the Cardinal's foes

scoreless last week as the 19th-ranked Car
dinal improved its record to 8-3-1 on the
season.
Edwards and Stanford began the week
against U.S. International at Harry Maloney
Field here Saturday. The Cardinal handily
defeated the Soaring Gulls 3-0 on three
Jennifer Rowland goals and Edwards was
barely tested as she made only one save.
The following day, however, was a different
story.
The Cardinal traveled to Berkeley to face
15th-ranked California Sunday. In that
game the Bears fired 26 shots at Edwards
but the Cardinal defense never cracked and
the teams played to a 0-0 tie.
The Cardinal, which ran its record to 9-3-1
with a 3-0 win over UC- Davis Tuesday,
plays in a tournament in Virginia this week
end before returning home to face three-time
defending NCAA Champion North Carolina
at Maloney Field Tuesday afternoon.

O'Brien, a 6-foot sophomore from Amaril
lo, Texas, got his season off to a fast start
by winning the Rolex Division I Regional
Tennis Championships.
By winning the tournament, which was
played at Cal State-Hayward Friday through
Sunday, O'Brien qualified for the 16-player
Rolex National Indoors in February.
Both the Stanford men's and women's
teams are unanimously ranked No. 1 in the
preseason poll.
O'Brien played 11 sets of tennis Saturday
as he advanced in both the singles and dou

bles draws. Sunday he defeated teammate
Glen Solomon 6-2, 6-0 in the semifinals but
he and Alexis Hombrecher lost in the dou
bles semis.
O'Brien met California's Doug Eisenman
in the final and pulled out a thrilling 7-6,
6-7, 7-6 win. O'Brien took the third-set tie
breaker 11-9 after fighting of several match
points.
