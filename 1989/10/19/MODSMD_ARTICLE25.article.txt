## Stadium declared safe 49ers may play Patriots at Stanford Sunday 
### Nat Cousins Editorial staff 
Saturday's Stanford-Utah foot
ball game will be played according
to plans, Athletic Director Andy
Geiger announced yesterday, but
the biggest game of the weekend
may be played Sunday.
Sunday afternoon's National
Football League game between
the San Francisco 49ers and the
New England Patriots, scheduled
for earthquake ravaged Candles
tick Park, may be moved to Stan
ford Stadium, Geiger confirmed.
Structural engineers examined
Stanford Stadium yesterday and
declared it safe for occupancy.
"Yes, we are talking to the
49ers," said Geiger. "We are am
menable to the possibility of the
49ers playing at Stanford Stadium
Sunday if Candlestick Park is
found to be unplayable. (49ers

Vice-President) John McVay and
I spoke twice today, and I'm sure
we'll talk more tomorrow if nec
essary."
A final decision will be made
today regarding the site of Sun
day's NFL football game.
San Francisco's Candlestick
Park, home to the 49ers and base
ball's Giants, was filled with
60,000 baseball fans during Tues
day's earthquake. Miraculously,
no fans were reported injured, al
though some damage to the sta
dium was reported.
Baseball commissioner Fay Vin
cent yesterday announced that the
World Series would not resume
in Candlestick until at least next
Tuesday, pending further tests of
the stadium, scheduled for today.
Stanford Stadium was the site
of Super Bowl XIX, held in 1985.
In that game, the 49ers defeated
the Miami Dolphins. The Stadium

holds approximately 80,000 fans, [
compared to the approximate •
65,000 football capacity !
Candlestick. Presumably, addi- »
tional seats would be available
should the game be held at Stan- ;
ford.
Sunday's game could also be ]
played in Foxboro, Mass., the •
home of the Patriot's, if necessary, '
or at another "neutral" site. Be
cause of scheduling quirks and !
the World Series, the 49ers have
played only one game at home all
year.
"We're ready to play this game,"
said Geiger. "We made a thorough
inspection this morning, and de
termined that there is no struc
tural damage. The press box is
fine, and the scoreboard and
public address system are work
ing. We lode forward to hosting
Utah on Saturday. It should be
an exciting game."
