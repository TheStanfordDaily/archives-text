# Series delayed until Tuesday

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - The
World Series will not resume
before next Tuesday at Candles
tick Park as the Bay area recovers
from its worst earthquake since
1906, baseball commissioner Fay
Vincent said.
Neither Candlestick nor the
Oakland Coliseum are ready yet,
but Vincent said he expects the
ballparks to be prepared next
week, assuming government offi
cials give their permission.

At that time, the Series would
pick up where it left off, Oakland
leading two games to none, with
Games 3, 4 and, if necessary, 5
in San Francisco. The Series
would return to Oakland for the
last two games, if necessary.
"The alternative of waiting a
few days seems to be better than
canceling the World Series, but
this is said in light of understand
ing the difficulty this area is
having," Vincent said. "We will

not be playing while this commu- J
nity is in the early stages of its «
recovery. !
"We believe Tuesday is a very •
good working hypothesis, but it ,
is not definite yet. I think our *
preferred course is to play at .
Candlestick." J
This will be the longest gap dur- «
ing a World Series since 1911 J
when there was a week delay be- •
