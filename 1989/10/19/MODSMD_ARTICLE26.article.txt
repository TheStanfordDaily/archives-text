# Series delayed until Tuesday

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - The
World Series will not resume
before next Tuesday at Candles
tick Park as the Bay area recovers
from its worst earthquake since
1906, baseball commissioner Fay
Vincent said.
Neither Candlestick nor the
Oakland Coliseum are ready yet,
but Vincent said he expects the
ballparks to be prepared next
week, assuming government offi
cials give their permission.

At that time, the Series would
pick up where it left off, Oakland
leading two games to none, with
Games 3, 4 and, if necessary, 5
in San Francisco. The Series
would return to Oakland for the
last two games, if necessary.
"The alternative of waiting a
few days seems to be better than
canceling the World Series, but
this is said in light of understand
ing the difficulty this area is
having," Vincent said. "We will

not be playing while this commu- J
nity is in the early stages of its «
recovery. !
"We believe Tuesday is a very •
good working hypothesis, but it ,
is not definite yet. I think our *
preferred course is to play at .
Candlestick." J
This will be the longest gap dur- «
ing a World Series since 1911 J
when there was a week delay be- •
cause of rainouts in the meeting
between the New York Giants and
the Philadelphia Athletics.
"It is becoming very clear to all
of us in major league baseball that
our issue is really a modest one
in light of the great tragedy," Vin
cent said. "It is also clear that we
are not going to be able to play
baseball at either park in this area
until next Tuesday."
The Bay Bridge Series was
postponed yesterday for the sec
ond straight day. The earthquake,
which struck Tuesday just 30
minutes before game time, killed
more than 200 and injured hun
dreds of others.
"We had 17 structural engineers
and two architects totally examin
ing the stadium for the impact.
We feel there is no structural

damage," said John Lind,
Candlestick's manager. "There
are some minor repairs and some
cleanup. There are areas where
we would like to explore in the
next few days, to make sure be
yond a shadow of a doubt."
The news conference announc
ing the plan was held in a room
lit by candles and remote televi
sion camera lights. The St.
Francis Hotel is still without full
power.
The Giants have been told to
report to Candlestick Park this
afternoon for a 1 p.m. workout.
The A's are to work out at noon
at Oakland Coliseum.
"Once the community returns
to a sense of normalcy, they will
expect the World Series. I think
it can be part of the healing," A's
vice president Sandy Alderson
said.
Oakland mayor Lionel Wilson
said late yesterday he had met
with Athletics* representatives

and told them they should not
resume play immediately.
"I did tell them that at this
time, it would be inappropriate to
play baseball in this city while
there are still bodies underneath
the concrete," Wilson said at the
Alameda Naval Air Station.
Wilson estimated it would take
at least four to five days to recover
the bodies from underneath
double-decked Interstate 880, the
freeway which collapsed and was
responsible an estimated 250-plus
deaths.
Power, telephones and other
services were limited as the
cleanup began yesterday. So too,
fortunately, was crime.
Debris littered the streets, win
dows from the best shops were
shattered and hotel lobbies were
strewn with sleepers. Tourists
roamed with video cameras, focus
ing on cracks in the concrete and
frozen clock faces.
Candlestick, where 60,000 fans

were watching the Giants and
Athletics warm up when the sta
dium shook, and the Coliseum
were inspected during the day.
Candlestick was closed yesterday,
while groundskeepers mowed the
grass in Oakland.
Since the first game was played
in 1903, no World Series game
has been postponed except for
weather. Even as two world wars
caused cancelation of other pro
and college sports, baseball con
tinued despite rosters depleted by
players serving military obliga
tions.
"There's going to be a full struc
tural engineering check of the en
tire stadium. That means getting
people from San Francisco Recre
ation and Parks, the county and
mtyor league baseball officials. We
will do an in-depth structural ex
amination of every section of this
ballpark," Jorge Costa, vice pres
ident for stadium operations, said.
