IM sports report

"Our chances are fairly good,"
said Potter's Dave Billingsley
before yesterday's coed football
game against Roble. "We've got
some great athletes — and more
importantly, we even have enough
people to play the game."
Unfortunately, Billingsley's
confidence just wasn't enough, as
Roble prevailed over Potter, 14-6.
Dave Moreno of Roble put the
most earthquake-proof building
on campus up early by a score of
7- 0, scoring on a 65-yard touch
down pass Billingsley did contrib
ute more than his encouraging
pre-game speech, as he caught a
40-yard TD pass to close the gap
to 7-6.
The teams traded possessions
late in the game with no resulting
scoring, until Molly Cummings
caught a 10-yard scoring pass with
20 seconds left in the game to ice
the victory for Roble.
In other exciting footall games,
Manzanita, 50-0 winners in their
first game, had a difficult time
with upstart Donner. Manzanita's
Rick Olesik broke a scoreless tie
in the "B" league game as he
caught an 8-yard TD with 2:35
to play in the game. Manzanita

added a garbage touchdown to
make the final score, Manzanita
14, Donner 0.
In a penalty-plagued "B" league
game, Taxi overpowered Toyon,
12-0. Possibly the most physical
game in recent IM football history,
Taxi's Stan Brobston scored on a
35-yard TD pass with no time left
on the clock in the first half to
put Taxi ahead, 6-0. Scott Hall of
Taxi ended the scoring with 35
seconds left in the second half
with an 8-yard TD reception to
make the final 12-0.
In an outstanding individual
performance, Craig Owen of the
Betas threw for two touchdowns
and ran for another as the unde
feated, unscored-upon Betas beat
Ujamaa, 19-0.
Last year's runner-ups in foot
ball, Kappa Sigma, are looking to
go all the way this year.
"We've emerged as the clear
early favorite," stated Pat Rollins,
Kappa Sig's IM manager.
"It's a multi-faceted attack with
a number of significant weapons
— both on offense and special
teams," said Rollins.
In IM volleyball action Monday,
Fat City's coed team, led by the
strong outside net play of Tyler
Aguinaldo, beat previously unde
feated 558 Mayfield, 15-4, 15-7.
In an extremely intense coed game
in the same league, Twain pulled
out a 15-10, 16-14 win over the
