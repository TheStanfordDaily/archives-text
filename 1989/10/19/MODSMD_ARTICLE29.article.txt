# Chemical, gas leak cleanup continues
## 
### Jock Friedly Editorial staff 
After a preliminary analysis,
the University will keep many re
search laboratories closed indefi
nitely because chemicals spilled
and gases leaked during Tuesday's
earthquake.
All laboratory spills have been
"stabilized," according to officials
of the Department of Health and
Safety. But laboratories in the
Medical Center and a number of
other research laboratories, many
of which are covered with debris

and spills, will be closed indefi
nitely.
Health and Safety has been
swamped with assessing potential
laboratory hazards created by the
earthquake, and much of the
cleanup will begin today. The Uni
versity has hired an outside com
pany, IT Corp., to help Health
and Safety officials in the cleanup.
Asbestos is a mqjor concern for
University officials since many
buildings on campus still contain
the carcinogenic substance, and
asbestos can be knocked loose by
any disturbance. "Without a

doubt, some asbestos has been dis
rupted," said Larry Horton, asso
ciate vice president for Public
Affairs.
The Medical Center was consid
ered to be very high on the pri
ority list for cleanup. Gary
Schoolnik, a microbiology and im
munology professor, said many
flammable and carcinogenic
chemicals have not been cleaned
up in many Medical Center labo
ratories.
Chemistry laboratories in the
Keck, Mudd and Stauffer build
ings suffered damage, ac-

cording to Chemistry Chair John
Ross. Although a lot of glass
broke, Ross said "only a few
things spilled."
"It was a mess, but it could
have been much worse," he said,
adding that "our stringent safety
rules helped a lot."
Biological Sciences Chair
Robert Simoni described the
damage to laboratories in Keck
as "devastating."
