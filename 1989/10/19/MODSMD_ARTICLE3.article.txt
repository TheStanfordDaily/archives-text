# San Francisco's nightmare
## Darkness at sunrise 
### Frank Quaratiello Editorial staff 
SAN FRANCISCO â€” When the sun rose
over this city yesterday, its first rays
revealed that the big quake had been more
than just a bacj dream.
Just before dawn, San Francisco was
shrouded in darkness. Downtown, there
were no street lights, no traffic lights.
The Marina section of town was the hard
est hit. Four-story buildings became two
story buildings in an instant. Sidewalks
and streets buckled.
One woman climbed out of her Fillmore
Street apartment window to safety after
the quake. Her third-floor apartment had
become a first-floor apartment. In the same
building, a 2-week-old baby had died.
On the corner of North Point and Scott
Street a similar wooden-framed four-story
apartment folded up like an accordion,
crushing a car that was parked along the
street.
Vic Giannini, who lived across the street
since 1955, watched this scene from his
living room window. "It looked like the
building was being blasted," he said.
Many structures in the area looked as if
they were fine, but inside huge cracks and
buckles riddled the walls and floors. In

Giannini's home, precious mementos and
art work lie broken and strewn across the
floor.
Bruce Grisham had been working on a
computer program in Pacific Heights. He
said people in the Heights felt the qunke
come in three distinct waves, whereas the
quake hit the Marina with one solid blow.
"I'm just glad to still have a relationship
with my ass," Grisham said.
Giannini and Grisham, like other sur
vivors, were out trying to help. But, in the
predawn hours, only the firefighters down
by Divisadero were still busy. They drained
their hoses on the smoldering remnants of
a block of buildings that had burned
fiercely throughout the night.
San Francisco Fire Chief Dennis Cal
lahan said his crews were waiting for dawn
before moving into the many buildings
which seemed ready to crumble.
"Several people got out immediately or
were rescued early on," Callahan said.
"This morning we will meet to decide how
to take apart the buildings that are barely
standing and how to get the people out if
there are any still trapped inside."
Everyone who had been working
throughout the night was tired, but a fresh

building caught fire after the earthquake Tuesday.
