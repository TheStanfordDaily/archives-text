# San Francisco's nightmare
## Darkness at sunrise 
### Frank Quaratiello Editorial staff 
SAN FRANCISCO — When the sun rose
over this city yesterday, its first rays
revealed that the big quake had been more
than just a bacj dream.
Just before dawn, San Francisco was
shrouded in darkness. Downtown, there
were no street lights, no traffic lights.
The Marina section of town was the hard
est hit. Four-story buildings became two
story buildings in an instant. Sidewalks
and streets buckled.
One woman climbed out of her Fillmore
Street apartment window to safety after
the quake. Her third-floor apartment had
become a first-floor apartment. In the same
building, a 2-week-old baby had died.
On the corner of North Point and Scott
Street a similar wooden-framed four-story
apartment folded up like an accordion,
crushing a car that was parked along the
street.
Vic Giannini, who lived across the street
since 1955, watched this scene from his
living room window. "It looked like the
building was being blasted," he said.
Many structures in the area looked as if
they were fine, but inside huge cracks and
buckles riddled the walls and floors. In

Giannini's home, precious mementos and
art work lie broken and strewn across the
floor.
Bruce Grisham had been working on a
computer program in Pacific Heights. He
said people in the Heights felt the qunke
come in three distinct waves, whereas the
quake hit the Marina with one solid blow.
"I'm just glad to still have a relationship
with my ass," Grisham said.
Giannini and Grisham, like other sur
vivors, were out trying to help. But, in the
predawn hours, only the firefighters down
by Divisadero were still busy. They drained
their hoses on the smoldering remnants of
a block of buildings that had burned
fiercely throughout the night.
San Francisco Fire Chief Dennis Cal
lahan said his crews were waiting for dawn
before moving into the many buildings
which seemed ready to crumble.
"Several people got out immediately or
were rescued early on," Callahan said.
"This morning we will meet to decide how
to take apart the buildings that are barely
standing and how to get the people out if
there are any still trapped inside."
Everyone who had been working
throughout the night was tired, but a fresh

crew was expected in the morning.
Across the bay in Oakland, all
attention was focused on the
crumbled, twisted stretch of High
way 880 that ran above Cypress
Road — that used to run above
Cypress Road.
The higher level of the 30-year
old highway structure collapsed,
crushing scores of cars and people
between massive slabs of asphalt
and concrete. Many of the people
on the top level had been rescued,
but estimates of the death toll on
the lower level ranged from 100
to 200 and beyond.
Maria Llamas and her husband
Florentino were in their home just
three houses away from the high
way when the quake hit.
Llamas said she went out into
the street after the initial shock.
People were screaming and
praying out loud. Then, she looked
up and saw that the highway had
collapsed.
"The noise in the streets was
so loud," Llamas said. "I prayed
and prayed, but even after I came
back inside, I couldn't sleep or do
anything."
At dawn yesterday, Oakland
Police Chief George Hart said his
officers were trying to assess the
damage.
"We think anyone who is still
there is lost," he said. But, his
prediction proved untrue when a

person was rescued later in the
day.
He said the rescue pffort was
continuing cautiously because
"any laymen could see that this
thing could fully collapse at any
tirna."
"We're looking at weeks and
weeks of disaster here," he said.
"Rescue efforts will continue for
a long time."
With this prediction, Hart may
be right. It is estimated that $'2
billion damage was done to San
Francisco alone. The earthquake
has been called a national disaster
and relief funds are pouring in
from around the world.
Experts estimate that it will
take three to four weeks to rebuild
the section of the Bay Bridge
which collapsed and years to
rebuild the Cypress section of
Highway 880. Death tolls con
tinue to mount as buildings are
opened up and bodies are found.

Right: Broken street signs will
be of little help to those trying
to orient themselves In the
disaster-stricken Marina district.
Bottom right: This collapsed
building Is one of many Marina
district structures to be
destroyed in the earthquake or
the rampant fires which followed
it.
Below: Approximately 250 rush
hour commuters were killed
when this section of Highway
880 collapsed In Oakland.
