## 'Love' a myth, 'link' to events is still X-T Feuding families replace love in third X-TV season 
### Martha Brockenbrough Editorial staff 
THE STANFORD DAILY'S ENTERTAINING WEEKLY

It's the end of an era.
"Love Links," Stanford's own
version of "The Dating Game," has
gone the way of dinosaurs and
roller disco. While this may spell
doom for all the impromptu,
televised dating that ran rampant
on campus last year, it marks the
beginning of the third full season
on X-TV.
And with the new season, a
smattering of new programs and
improved versions of some old
ones will come over the airwaves
to Channel 10 via SUNet.
In place of "Love Links," which
X-TV Station Manager David Kel
ler said had "outlived its entertain
ment value," will come a takeoff
of "Family Feud," where teams
from dormitories and other stu
dent groups compete against each
other for prizes.
On the sports front, all the wom
en's and most of the men's home
volleyball games will be broadcast
live under Keller's direction, with
play-by-play broadcast by senior
Greg Filler.
In addition, on Tuesdays and
Thursdays during lunch, X-TV will
broadcast "Sports Break," a replay
of the best sporting events from
the previous weekend.
X-TV will continue to broadcast
speakers who appear on campus,
but; on a much more regular basis
than in past years. Keller, a senior,
said that in past years, speeches
have been broadcast only "if a spe
cific person at X-TV was interested
in the speaker."
This year, each segment of
"Branner Presents," a series hosted
and co-sponsored by Branner Hall
and the Office of Residential Ed
ucation, will be taped and broad

cast on X-TV later during the same
evening.
Other on-campus speeches, like
last year's appearances by
moviemaker Spike Lee, will be
broadcast whenever possible, Kel
ler said. X-TV can broadcast many
such speeches so that viewers don't
have to "fight the crowd" or miss
out because of inadequate seating.
X-TV may collaborate with the
Concert Network to present com
edians who appear Tuesday nights
at "Catch a Rising Star," the Hyatt
Palo Alto's series that showcases
up-and-coming comedians.
To target the graduate-student
audience, X-TV will offer a cooking
instruction program hosted by
Jeuthica Stengaal, who cooked up
a similar program on cable televi
sion. Broadcasts are scheduled to
begin next week.
X-TV will continue its "News
Magazine," a series of interviews
and features that will run every
two weeks.
"The Stinking Rotten Dead of
the Night," a talk show patterned
after the likes of late-night greats
David Letterman and Johnny Car
son, may continue at the not-so
late hour of 9 p.m., beginning next
quarter.
Keller said that X-TV may also
broadcast a half-hour documentary
on co-ops, as well as other video
pieces about the unseen sides of
campus, including the steam tun
nels and the "faculty ghetto."
Other ideas include televising a
live forum on acquaintance rape,
Keller said.
"The ideas are there," he added.
"We're just waiting for the oppor
tunity."
Unfortunately, the technology
lags far behind the creativity of the
students who run X-TV.
Not all campus residences even

'They're strangely
dedicated'
— David Keller

get X-TV.
Rooms in Governor's Corner, as
well as all apartments at Rains
Complex receive SUNet, the tele
vision network that carries X-TV.
Wilbur, Stern Florence Moore,
Branner and Toyon Halls only
receive SUNet in their lounges.
The Row Houses and the Cowell
Cluster don't get SUNet at all.
Financial limitations and the in
adequate computer capacity at
SUNet is at the root of the prob
lem, said Keller. "It's very frustrat
ing."
Frustration has not dissuaded
the more than 20 volunteer stu
dents who make up the X-TV staff,
however. "They're strangely dedi
cated," Keller said. He added that
he expects the staff to grow to 30
members by the end of the quarter.
There is always a high turnout
of interested students at orienta
tion meetings, Keller explained. Yet
prospective X-TV staffers usually
realize two things at these orien
tation meetings — X-TV is time
consuming, and it may not be as
glamorous as they previously imag
ined.
"We have to come across as
remarkably fun people" to attract
new staff members, Keller
conceded.
The bulk of X-TV's budget — a
$22,000 lump after refunds —
comes from the ASSU Special Fee
Assessment that X-TV won in last
spring's election. This year's fund
ing marks the second time that

X-TV has received support through
special fees, as their spring of 1988
fee request was voted down by stu
dents.
Yet X-TV could easily use twice
the amount of money they re
quested through special fees, Keller
said. "Our equipment is almost all
in a state of disrepair." Their
editing system, donated by the
Video Resources Council several
years ago, "defines what (X-TV)
can do," he added.
More than "doing really fun stuff
with video cameras," working at

X-TV takes a lot of planning, Keller
said, "and no one wants to think
about that."
To calculate the amount of time
one program will take, Keller mul
tiplies the time that it takes to
shoot and edit the film by three.
But the skills necessary to work
at X-TV are "remarkably easy to
learn," Keller said. Once students
learn the tricks involved in X-TV
filming and production, when they
can "go out and do anything," Kel
ler said, they are considered staff
members.

Although Keller said he doesn't
like to "Kid himself into thinking
that a lot of people watch X-TV
and appreciate all that (the staff)
does," campus groups have begun
coming to the network with proj
ects they would like X-TV to shoot.
One such group is Ram's Head
Theatrical Society. X-TV will shoot
three "trailers" — two-minute
films shown before Flicks — that
will promote some of this year's
Ram's Head productions.
Filming for the Gaities trailer is
scheduled to begin next week.

filming and production, when they
can "go out and do anything," Kel
ler said, they are considered staff
members.

Although Keller said he doesn't
like to "Kid himself into thinking
that a lot of people watch X-TV
and appreciate all that (the staff)
does," campus groups have begun
coming to the network with proj
ects they would like X-TV to shoot.
One such group is Ram's Head
Theatrical Society. X-TV will shoot
three "trailers" — two-minute
films shown before Flicks — that
will promote some of this year's
Ram's Head productions.
Filming for the Gaities trailer is
scheduled to begin next week.

THE STANFORD DAILY'S ENTERTAINING WEEKLY

It's the end of an era.
"Love Links," Stanford's own
version of "The Dating Game," has
gone the way of dinosaurs and
roller disco. While this may spell
doom for all the impromptu,
televised dating that ran rampant
on campus last year, it marks the
beginning of the third full season
on X-TV.
And with the new season, a
smattering of new programs and
improved versions of some old
ones will come over the airwaves
to Channel 10 via SUNet.
In place of "Love Links," which
X-TV Station Manager David Kel
ler said had "outlived its entertain
ment value," will come a takeoff
of "Family Feud," where teams
from dormitories and other stu
dent groups compete against each
other for prizes.
On the sports front, all the wom
en's and most of the men's home
volleyball games will be broadcast
live under Keller's direction, with
play-by-play broadcast by senior
Greg Filler.
In addition, on Tuesdays and
Thursdays during lunch, X-TV will
broadcast "Sports Break," a replay
of the best sporting events from
the previous weekend.
X-TV will continue to broadcast
speakers who appear on campus,
but; on a much more regular basis
than in past years. Keller, a senior,
said that in past years, speeches
have been broadcast only "if a spe
cific person at X-TV was interested
in the speaker."
This year, each segment of
"Branner Presents," a series hosted
and co-sponsored by Branner Hall
and the Office of Residential Ed
ucation, will be taped and broad

cast on X-TV later during the same
evening.
Other on-campus speeches, like
last year's appearances by
moviemaker Spike Lee, will be
broadcast whenever possible, Kel
ler said. X-TV can broadcast many
such speeches so that viewers don't
have to "fight the crowd" or miss
out because of inadequate seating.
X-TV may collaborate with the
Concert Network to present com
edians who appear Tuesday nights
at "Catch a Rising Star," the Hyatt
Palo Alto's series that showcases
up-and-coming comedians.
To target the graduate-student
audience, X-TV will offer a cooking
instruction program hosted by
Jeuthica Stengaal, who cooked up
a similar program on cable televi
sion. Broadcasts are scheduled to
begin next week.
X-TV will continue its "News
Magazine," a series of interviews
and features that will run every
two weeks.
"The Stinking Rotten Dead of
the Night," a talk show patterned
after the likes of late-night greats
David Letterman and Johnny Car
son, may continue at the not-so
late hour of 9 p.m., beginning next
quarter.
Keller said that X-TV may also
broadcast a half-hour documentary
on co-ops, as well as other video
pieces about the unseen sides of
campus, including the steam tun
nels and the "faculty ghetto."
Other ideas include televising a
live forum on acquaintance rape,
Keller said.
"The ideas are there," he added.
"We're just waiting for the oppor
tunity."
Unfortunately, the technology
lags far behind the creativity of the
students who run X-TV.
Not all campus residences even

'They're strangely
dedicated'
— David Keller

get X-TV.
Rooms in Governor's Corner, as
well as all apartments at Rains
Complex receive SUNet, the tele
vision network that carries X-TV.
Wilbur, Stern Florence Moore,
Branner and Toyon Halls only
receive SUNet in their lounges.
The Row Houses and the Cowell
Cluster don't get SUNet at all.
Financial limitations and the in
adequate computer capacity at
SUNet is at the root of the prob
lem, said Keller. "It's very frustrat
ing."
Frustration has not dissuaded
the more than 20 volunteer stu
dents who make up the X-TV staff,
however. "They're strangely dedi
cated," Keller said. He added that
he expects the staff to grow to 30
members by the end of the quarter.
There is always a high turnout
of interested students at orienta
tion meetings, Keller explained. Yet
prospective X-TV staffers usually
realize two things at these orien
tation meetings — X-TV is time
consuming, and it may not be as
glamorous as they previously imag
ined.
"We have to come across as
remarkably fun people" to attract
new staff members, Keller
conceded.
The bulk of X-TV's budget — a
$22,000 lump after refunds —
comes from the ASSU Special Fee
Assessment that X-TV won in last
spring's election. This year's fund
ing marks the second time that

X-TV has received support through
special fees, as their spring of 1988
fee request was voted down by stu
dents.
Yet X-TV could easily use twice
the amount of money they re
quested through special fees, Keller
said. "Our equipment is almost all
in a state of disrepair." Their
editing system, donated by the
Video Resources Council several
years ago, "defines what (X-TV)
can do," he added.
More than "doing really fun stuff
with video cameras," working at

X-TV takes a lot of planning, Keller
said, "and no one wants to think
about that."
To calculate the amount of time
one program will take, Keller mul
tiplies the time that it takes to
shoot and edit the film by three.
But the skills necessary to work
at X-TV are "remarkably easy to
learn," Keller said. Once students
learn the tricks involved in X-TV
filming and production, when they
can "go out and do anything," Kel
ler said, they are considered staff
members.

Although Keller said he doesn't
