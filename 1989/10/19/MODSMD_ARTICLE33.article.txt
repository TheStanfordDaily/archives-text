# Second City's second time
## 
### Audrew Berkowitz Senior staff writer 
The last time The Second City played Stan
ford they got ripped off, remembers Producer
Joyce Sloane. Somebody went through their
belongings while they were performing on stage,
took a camera and other valuables — just bas
ically tossed the joint.
That was a long time ago. though. Back when
■ John Belushi was part ot The Second City.
Before "Saturday Night Live" and "SCTV."
People hardly respected the Fundamental Stand
ard in those days — at least, not like they do
So The Second City is coming back to give
Stanford a second chance. It's a testimonial not
Only to their forgiveness, but also to their staying
bower. With the 30-year anniversary of the
Chicago sketch comedy group coming up this
November, Sloane can look back proudly on a
history that has launched the careers of such
luminaries as Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Alan
Alda/Robert Klein, Lindajjivin, Shelly Lonj:.
George Wendt, loan Rivers, Ed Asner, John
Canoy, Eugene Levy and Rick Moranis. It's like
a Who's Who of comedy.
The Second City formed in 1959 in Chicago,
k taking their name from the title of AJ. Liebling's
derisive profile in"The New Yorker." They
perform both topical sketches, similar to the
sketch-comedy featured on NBC's long-running
"Saturday Night Live," as well as
improvisational scenes based on
audience suggestions.
"All our material is created
through improvisation," says Joyce
Sloane, who has been with the
group almost since its beginning.
"After the regular home show in
Chicago we take audience sugges
tions and perform improvisational
skits. Afterwards we select the best
ones and refine them into complete
sketches."
The Stanford show on Saturday
will be a showcase of those well
polished skits. The touring com
pany — Aliza Shalowitz, Tom
Hanigan, Jenna Jolovitz, Lou
Saliba, Tom Purcell, Rob Kolson
and Charlie Hartsock — is one of
three groups currently performing
under The Second City's banner.
There is another group in the
United States, and one in Canada.
Besides their popular home
shows in Chicago, The Second

City has appeared on television in
the United States and Canada
since the 19705, the latter nation
giving birth to the cult-classic
"SCTV," which introduced such
classic anti-heroes as the
McKenzie brothers of The Great
White North.
The goal of most of the current
members, says Sloane, is to follow
the footsteps of their famous com
edic forefathers into the promised
land — The Movies. This invites
the natural comparison between
the old Second City of Aykroyd,
Murray and Belushi, and the new
Second City of virtual unknowns.
"There are always comparisons,"
says Sloane. "The reviews talk
about that — but they talk favor
ably."

The Second City comedy revue
performs on Saturday at 8 p.m.
in Memorial Auditorium. Tickets
are $12-$ 16 (students $3 off), and
are available at the Tresidder
Ticket Office.
