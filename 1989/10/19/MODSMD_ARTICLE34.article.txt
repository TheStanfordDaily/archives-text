# Cerebral Paisley puts the 'raucous' into rock
## 
### Gene Anaya Senior staff writer 
In recent months, many classic rock bands
(Jefferson Airplane, The Stones and The Who, to
name but a few) have reunited, much to the delight
of their fans. The same is true of Stanford's most
raucous (and seM-proclaimed horniest) band, Cerebral
Paisley.
For many musicians, making music is a form of
artistic expression — a way of exploring themselves
and sharing what they find with others. For Cerebral
Paisley, however, playing gigs is more than just this;
it's also a way to meet women.
After a six-month hiatus, Cerebral Paisley is back
together making great music both on and off campus.
During their half-year separation, sparked by drum
mer Sid Heaton's (senior, international relations)
overseas excursion to Poland, guitarist Chip Day
(senior, English) actually became Jimmy Page in last
spring's short-lived but truly awesome Led Zeppelin
cover band, Overlord.
Formed one night two years ago when all its mem
bers were drunk, Cerebral Paisley is built upon Day's
superior guitar-playing skills. Day's quick-handed
playing is closely supported by equally talented bassist
Mark Felton (senior, religious studies) and drummer
Heaton. Together, these three form the intense mu
sical core of Cerebral Paisley.
Rounding out this loud but talented group are
rhythm guitarist Harlan Thompson (senior, psychol
ogy) and vocalist Dan Catherwood (junior, anthro
pology). Both Thompson and Catherwood add further
dimensions to Cerebral Paisley's diverse musical
world.
Of the band's musical style, Heaton explains, "We
used to be a mediocre stoner band, but now we've
graduated to being a mystic-laden cover band."

Listening to a Cerebial Paisley show is like ran
domly playing the tracks of a compact disc filled
with nothing but the best classic rock tunes of all
time. Clapton, Hendrix, The Stones, The Doors —
you name it; Cerebral Paisley can jam it out almost
better than in its original form.
And jam-out tunes are what Cerebral Paisley docs
best. Once Felton and Heaton have laid down the
basic beat of the song, and Catherwood has belted
out a few of the timeless lyrics that everyone already

knows by heart, Day goes wild on his guitar, thrashing
out improvised solos as if he were possessed by the
spirit of the original guitarist.
At times, however, Catherwood's vocals are
drowned out by Felton's thundering bass, Heaton's
drums and Day's slick guitar licks, but the crowd
rarely notices. They aren't dancing to the lyrics.
Wherever the party is, if Cerebral Paisley is playing,
the walls will literally be shaking, and it's bound to
be good.
