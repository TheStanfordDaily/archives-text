# Immerse yourself for 13 short weeks in this 'bassic' solution
## 
### 
Now, with this exclusive offer, you can
become a classical musician IN ONLY
THIRTEEN WEEKS! How is this possible,
you ask, seeing as how the only thing you
know how to play is the radio? Well,
through our unique new Total Immer
sion™ program, you can play Prokoviev
like the professionals IN ONLY THIR
TEEN WEEKS!
The old-fashioned method of teaching
music takes YEARS to master. Why? Be
cause you play only simple music. But
with the unique new Total Immersion™
program, we give you a musical instru
ment and put you smack dab in the middle
of the London Philharmonic. YOU LEARN
BY DOING!
Oh, sure, it's bound to be frustrating
at first. You'll sit in the center of the
Philharmonic holding onto your viola for
dear life, unsure which end to blow into.
But within days you'll be picking up those
crashing crescendos, those subtle nuances,
the quarter-notes, sharps, flats and rests.
No more icky scales to play. No more
years of screechy off-key violin playing
With the new Total Immersion™ program,

you will play like the professionals IN
ONLY THIRTEEN WEEKS!
Just listen to the testimonials from some
people who have tned our program:
"What a total rip-froaring bunch of
funj."
— Walt Upchuck. 52. Upper Velma
"Before I enrolled in the Total Immer
sionprogram I did not know the base
clef from the vile clef. Now I do."
— Leona Squatlike. 37. New Brunswick
"Until I found the TotalIImmersionn n
program. I had tried almost everything
else: diet pills, liposuction, vomiting. But
TotalIImmersionn n helped me take those
unwanted pounds off and. ... What? 1
was supposed to play the piccolo, not
swallow iti Oh. never mind."
— Bernice Zamboni, 29, South Lintsville
You may choose to learn an instrument
from any of the following families:
The Woodwinds: Oboe, flute, baboon,
clearasil, alto sax, telephone sax.
The Brass: TYumpet, tubular, coronet,

frcnch hen, turtle dove, Donald and Ivana
Trump.
The Strings: Violin, viola, viol, vio, vi,
v.
The Enormous Instruments: Double
Bass, grand Piano, kettle drums, Chrysler,
ostrich.
The Instruments That Are So Simple
My Cat Could Play Them: Cymbals, tri
angle, gong.
We arc also pleased to announce the
new Total Immersion"' Orchestra Con
ducting program. Most conductors must
study music for years, or perhaps even
DECADES, before they are allowed control
of an orchestra. But we can teach you to
conduct music IN ONLY THIRTEEN
WEEKS.
Learning to conduct, you see, is really
just learning how to BOSS PEOPLE
AROUND. A good conductor is so bossy
that he need only wave a stick at his
musicians and they will begin to play.
Eventually, you too will learn how to order
musicians around with a little stick, but
in the beginning of the Total Immersion™

program, we'll arm you with A RIFLE. If
those musicians don't play EXACTLY as
you wish, merely fire a warning shot over
their heads and see if they don't launch
into Brahms with vigor.
Finally, we are extra-specially pleased
to announce our new Total Immersion™
course in SONGWRITING FOR
FOLKSINGERS Let's face it: many of
today's would-be folksongwnters did not

have the benefit of secondary schooling,
nor, for that matter, parents who were
not siblings. But with our new Total Im
mersion" 1 program in folksongs, you can
write lyrics like Joan Baez IN ONLY THIR
TEEN WEEKS!
Here is an example from Lesson 1:
Please write a peaceful, Joan Baez
like folksong.
When Salty saw what Jack had done
she ran to the wall and got her gun.
She got her gun. she got her gun,
she ran to the wall and got her gun.
She got her gun. she got her gun
A real big gun. a real big gun.
She got her real big. enormous gun
It could probably bring down a rhino.
Chorus
A real big rhino, a real big rhino
Or maybe even a hippo or a lion-o.

the quarter-notes, sharps, flats and rests.
No more icky scales to play. No more
years of screechy off-key violin playing
With the new Total Immersion™ program,

ONLY THIRTEEN WEEKS!
Just listen to the testimonials from some
people who have tned our program:
"What a total rip-froaring bunch of
funj."
— Walt Upchuck. 52. Upper Velma
"Before I enrolled in the Total Immer
sionprogram I did not know the base
clef from the vile clef. Now I do."
— Leona Squatlike. 37. New Brunswick
"Until I found the TotalIImmersionn n
program. I had tried almost everything
else: diet pills, liposuction, vomiting. But
TotalIImmersionn n helped me take those
unwanted pounds off and. ... What? 1
was supposed to play the piccolo, not
swallow iti Oh. never mind."
— Bernice Zamboni, 29, South Lintsville

We arc also pleased to announce the
new Total Immersion"' Orchestra Con
ducting program. Most conductors must
study music for years, or perhaps even
DECADES, before they are allowed control
of an orchestra. But we can teach you to
conduct music IN ONLY THIRTEEN
WEEKS.
Learning to conduct, you see, is really
just learning how to BOSS PEOPLE
AROUND. A good conductor is so bossy
that he need only wave a stick at his
musicians and they will begin to play.
Eventually, you too will learn how to order
musicians around with a little stick, but
in the beginning of the Total Immersion™

program, we'll arm you with A RIFLE. If
those musicians don't play EXACTLY as
you wish, merely fire a warning shot over
their heads and see if they don't launch
into Brahms with vigor.
Finally, we are extra-specially pleased
to announce our new Total Immersion™
course in SONGWRITING FOR
FOLKSINGERS Let's face it: many of
today's would-be folksongwnters did not

have the benefit of secondary schooling,
nor, for that matter, parents who were
not siblings. But with our new Total Im
mersion" 1 program in folksongs, you can
write lyrics like Joan Baez IN ONLY THIR
TEEN WEEKS!
Here is an example from Lesson 1:
Please write a peaceful, Joan Baez
like folksong.
When Salty saw what Jack had done
she ran to the wall and got her gun.
She got her gun. she got her gun,
she ran to the wall and got her gun.
She got her gun. she got her gun
A real big gun. a real big gun.
She got her real big. enormous gun
It could probably bring down a rhino.
Chorus
A real big rhino, a real big rhino
Or maybe even a hippo or a lion-o.

Folksongwriters Hall of Fame His column
