# No anvils in this animation

Animation. Even after the
whole world saw "Who Framed
Rodger Rabbit" twice, the world
still conjures up images of Tom
chasing Jerry into a mousehole,
the coyote trying to drop an anvil
from Acme Co. on the roadrun
ner, and Sylvester spitting and
sputtering over Tweety's
birdcage.
"The Second Animation
Celebration: The Movie!" goes a
long way in breaking down these
stereotypes of animation.
"The Second Animation
Celebration" is a feature-length
movie composed of a sequence
of 24 short films, each ranging
from under a minute to around

20 minutes. The clips display a
range of animation techniques,
from traditional cartoons to in
credible computer animation and
even claymation (using stop
motion photography to animate
clay models).
Many of the films are ex
tremely funny, a few are disturb
ing, and some are just, well,
weird. But they're all interesting.
Also worth noting are five
short pieces by Matt Groening,
the cynical creator of the "Life
in Hell" comic strips and books.
"Life in Hell" chronicles the
misadventures of the Simpsons,
who he calls "the American fam
ily in all its horror."
A few animated commercials
included among the films did not
hold my interest as much as the

other picces. While these com
mercials obviously displayed a
huge amount of effort and tech
nical sophistication, they did not
fit the atmosphere of the collec
tion of films. Instead they
seemed tacked on.
I definitely recommend "The
Second Animation Celebration:
The Movie!" The short pieces
included in the movie are inter
esting both for their premises as
well as the remarkable artistic
talent which they display.
One warning: "Lazar," one of
the first films in the movie, is
really weird (or avant-garde, if
you want to sound artsy). I found
it to be a very interesting piece,
but if you don't like it, don't
worry, the following films are a
lot more mainstream.
