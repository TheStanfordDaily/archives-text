# Look who's back in pictures

Remember John Travolta? You
never thought you would hear that
name again â€” did you?
Well, he's back, and he's in a
movie with a baby who has Bruce
Willis' voice. Sounds like a real
cinematic breakthrough, doesn't
it? I don't think the Academy is
going be giving this film any stand
ing O's.
On the other hand, though, any
film that begins with a sperm's-eye
view of intercourse has something
going for it. The epitome of a
"cute" film, "Look Who's Talking"
attempts to answer the question,
"What do babies really think?"
Opening with the amorous event
that leads to the pregnancy of
Mollie (Kirstie Alley), the film
quickly shifts to her trials as an
unwed mother. From fertilization
onward, the fetus that becomes
Mikey relays his thoughts to the
audience via Bruce Willis' voice
overs.
When Mollie goes into labor she
is forced to rely upon James, a
New York cab driver played by
Travolta, for transportation and
support in the delivery room. And
when Mollie returns home a cou
ple of days later, James brings back
the purse that she left in his cab.
As fate would have it, James and
Mikey hit it off. When James offers
to baby-sit if Mollie will let him
use her Manhattan mailing ad
dress so his grandfather may live
in a city retirement building, the
way is paved for many a cute scene
of James and Mikey playing with
each other.
While James acts as a surrogate
father, Mollie searches for a hus
band to finish out her family.
She begins to warm up to James
after dates with a constipated ac
countant and a neatness addict.
But in the midst of foreplay, she
calls a time-out and sends James
packing. A minor crisis concerning
James' grandfather and an unnec
essary car chase rectify the situa

tion, however.
Though the promotions for
"Look Who's Talking" tend to em
phasize Bruce Willis' voice-overs,
the real star of the film ends up
being Kirstie Alley. She proves to
be a fine comic actress.
As you might expect, the various
babies who play Mikey are cute,
and Bruce Willis verbalizes
Mikey's thoughts with his typical
sarcastic flair.
Now I have come to the point
where I say a few words about that
relic of the 70s, the icon of disco,

John Travolta. I wasn't even sure
Travolta was still alive until I read
he was in this movie. As it turns
out, he's a little flabby but not too
shabby.
Writer-director Amy Heckerling
deserves most of the credit for
making "Look Who's Talking" a
clever and attractive film. From
the opening shot, Heckling estab
lishes an off-beat visual style and
a bold-primary-color scheme.
For all of its potential for
stupidity, "Look Who's Talking" is
in reality an entertaining comedy.
