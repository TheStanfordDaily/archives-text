# Econ prof. levels cheating charges
## 
### Geoff Goldman Staff writer 
Even though classes are only a few weeks
old, reports of cheating have already emerged
this quarter.
To the surprise of many Economics 1 stu
dents, Prof. Tim Taylor started off Tuesday's
class with a lecture on something other than
economics.
Taylor read aloud the Honor Code printed
on the front cover of Stanford's blue books.
Taylor told the 450-person class that he was
very surprised that anyone would cheat on a
small, relatively unimportant quiz.
After a quiz Monday, a student in Taylor's
class told him that several students in his
section of the room were cheating during the
test. Taylor said the student proceeded to walk
away and Taylor did not have a chance to
find out any more information.
Saying he "felt obligated to respond to the
accusation," Taylor decided to bring it up in
class. ,
Taylor said he hoped that cheat
ing problems could be avoided and
that students could monitor other
students during the quiz. There
will be four more quizzes in his
class this quarter.
During the class, Taylor
reminded students that their
honor is at stake, not that of the
faculty. He said he hopes that
bringing up this situation in class
will create an atmosphere where
students will feel more obligated
to uphold the Honor Code.
As of last night, no one had
come forward and admitted cheat
ing, although class has not met
since Tuesday.
Because he had no direct
evidence of cheating, Taylor did
not go through the standard pro

cedure for reporting Honor Code
violations. Instead, he told stu
dents that he would simply drop
the test grade of anyone who ad
mitted cheating in accordance
with the class policy which gives
all students the opportunity to
drop their lowest test scores.
Under normal University
policy, such infractions of the
Honor Code would be reported to
the. Judicial Affairs Office.
The University's Legislative
and Judicial Charter states "stu
dents are not to be penalized for
violations of the Honor Code with
out notice, hearing and adjudica
tion. An instructor may not,
therefore, lower a student's grade
or impose any other academic
penalty on the grounds of dis
honesty in the abscence of formal
proceedings.
Taylor said that if he had firm
evidence, he would have further
pursued this matter under stand
ard University regulations.
