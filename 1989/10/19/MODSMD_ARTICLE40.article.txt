Is tht Alarm the band to fill
U2's shoes?
U2 is declining, after all.
Since they have graced the cover
of every magazine in the coun
try, it his become harder to be
lieve that Bono is singing for
blue-collar workers, the op
pressed and the misguided.
Enter the Alarm. Their
simple, genuinely sincere style
makes them believable preac
hers for disillusioned U2 fans.
And incidentally, the
similarities between the two
bands are almost uncanny.
Both are four-man, Northern-
European bands that use a
heavy dose of guitar in their
songs. Both bands have lead
vocalists with quivering voices
and members with enigmatic
names — the Alarm's drummer
is called "Twist." Both posed
for their album covers with pen
sive, thoughtful expressions.
And both bands set themselves
ahead of their musical peers by
combining meat-and-potatoes
rock with a social conscience.
Fans who have followed the
group from their "cult" status
have always known the band
can rock.
The Alarm asserted them
selves as a solid, hard-rocking
band in 1984 with "Knife Edge,"
"Spirit of '76" and "Absolute
Reality," three tracks from their
first album, "Strength." They
expanded their popularity with

their next album, "Eye of the
Hurricane," Achieving commer
cial success with "Presence of
Love" and "Rain in the Sum
mertime."
But with lyrics like I like to
feel the rain in the summer
time/I like to feel the rain on
my head, lyrical simplicity
eclipsed musical merit.
With their new album,
"Change," the Alarm finally hits
the mark with a combination
of imagery-filled lyrics and a
hard-driving rock sound.
The aptly named album
proves that the Alarm has ma
tured into an insightful band.
In "Love Don't Come Easy," the
anguished vocals of Mike Peters
work well alongside the slightly
twanging guitar of Dave Sharp.
Although the personification
of love is hardly an original
theme for a song, the Alarm's
metaphors ring with a fresh
twist of good lyrics like, "Love
can make your poverty seem
rich although you're poor."
And although Sharp is a profi
cient guitarist, instead of
drowning out the vocals, he
looks to complement them.
"Sold Me Down the River," the
album's first release, kicks off
the effort with infectious guitar
riffs and a catchy, energetic
drum beat.
"Devolution Workin' Man
Blues," "Black Sun," and
"Hardland" prove that the
Alarm can combine their mu
sical talent with colorful lyrics as
well as a social conscience. "1 came
back/home to a hardlandMhere a
man is judgecUby the scars on his
face." Their down-to-earth style is
thoughtful, sincere, and — most
importantly — convincing.
Even when the lyrics falter, the
melodic tunes make the songs
work. "How the Mighty Fall"
derives its strength from the song's
gradual crescendo that eventually
erupts like a volcano. This tech
nique, also seen in "Where a Town
Once Stood," is one of the band's
more polished tools. By using a
powerful climax, the less-than
eloquent lyrics are overshadowed
by the music.
During one of the Alarm's New
York concerts last year, Peters ex
claimed to the audience, "1 hate
music that makes you feel bad. I
will fight those songs with every
ounce of breath in my body." This
vow is clearly upheld in "Change,"
for even the most depressing tracks
seem harmonious.
In "A New South Wales," the
album's final track, the Alarm col
laborates with the Morriston Or
pheus Male Voice Choir and the
Welsh Symphony Orchestra. The
song juxtaposes recollections of the
bloodied past of the band's
homeland with a prayer for the
fate of future generations. "Great
is the rape of the fair country/. . .
Great is the need.for a new South
Wales." But the song's bitter lyrics
are so well-concealed behind the
hymn-like music, one can't help
but be uplifted by the album's end.
"Change" reflects a newfound
maturity for the Alarm. No longer
are they merely a hard-rocking ga
rage band — they may be well on
their way to surpassing U2.
Moreover, music and words are
each powerful mediums. With
"Change," the Alarm finally prove
that they know how to use both.
