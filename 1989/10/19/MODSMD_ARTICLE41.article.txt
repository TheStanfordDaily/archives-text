# Foundation of failure for Tracy Chapman
## 
### John Louie Staff writer 
When Tracy Chapman burst
onto the music scene last year,
skeptics called her success a fluke.
How else could you explain the
commercial success of this earthy,
sensitive folk singer? Who could
predict that this Cleveland
musician, raised on welfare and
once advised by a casting agent to
"please tune her guitar," would be
performing alongside Bruce
Springsteen and Sting in front of
stadium crowds? And who would
have thought that "Fast Car," a
soulful ode to the disenfranchised,
would become a top five hit?
Despite these doubts, Chapman
received widespread critical ac
claim for her debut album, "Tracy
Chapman," because of her unique,
sensitive and profound style of folk
music. All of this came to a quiet
young woman who, to paraphrase
"Fast Car," had "nothing to prove."
Her follow-up album, "Cros
sroads," proves many things. Most
importantly, it demonstrates that
Chapman's success is no fluke.
This album also proves that she
is everything her first album made
her out to be — genuinely sincere,
thoughtful, insightful, musical and
socially conscious.
Chapman fails to prove, how
ever, that she can grow and develop
alongside maturing musical tastes.
Not that "Crossroads" is lacking
as an album. Within its ten tracks
lay some potential jewels. In "Sub
city," a song reminiscent of "Fast
Car," Chapman uses a quick beat
to infuse a depressing topic —
homelessness — with a glimmer

of hope. From the point of view
of a homeless person, she power
fully conveys how it feels to be
poor.
Her simple lyrics bore into the
soul. "Here in subcity life is
hard/We can't receive any govern
ment relief/I'd like to give Mr. Pres
ident my honest regards/For
disregarding me."
Chapman also retains the
honest, sensitive perspective on
love which she displayed in "Baby
Can I Hold You" and "For You."
In "Bridges," the quiver in. her voice
conveys the personal anguish of
unrequited love. By running some
of die song's lyrics together, she
captures the desperation of loneli
ness. "All the bridges that you
burn/Come back one day to haunt
you/One day you'll find you're
walking/ Lonely."
In "This Time," violin back
grounds bring the vulnerability in
Chapman's voice as she describes
the struggle to rebuild pride and
self-esteem. "This time/1 won't let
emotions rule my life/This
time/I'm going to keep my heart
locked safe inside."
It is reassuring to know that
Chapman has not been spoiled by
her sudden success. In "All That
You Have Is Your Soul," the al
bum's final track, Chapman
echoes her mother's advice. "Don't
be tempted by the shiny ap
ple/Don't you eat of a bitter
fruit/. . . 'Cause all that you have
is your soul."
Chapman has definitely heeded
the advice of her parent. The style

hardly say that Chapman "sold
out."
But the remainder of the album
is so musically and lyrically identi
cal that it's almost predictable.
Even "Freedom Now/' a timely
plea for the release of Nelson Man
dela, seems somewhat ordinary.
Instrumentally, the typical
Chapman mix of guitars, drums,
and bass are not revitalized by the
occasional sprinklings of man
dolins, organs and cellos. It is
Chapman's vocals, simple and
unobscured, which must carry the
brunt of the album's musical bur
den.
"Crossroads" asserts Tracy
Chapman as one of this decade's
premier musicians. However, it
also casts an ominous shadow over
Chapman's fate in decades to
come. One wonders if "Cros
sroads" represents the second half
of a solid foundation or the unfor
tunate pinnacle of a stalled career.
