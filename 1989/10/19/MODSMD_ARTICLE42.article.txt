If Elvis is alive, I hope he was at the
Shoreline Amphitheater Friday night to
hear the Fine Young Cannibals' rendition
of his last number-one song, "Suspicious
Minds."
The re-made 1969 hit stands out as
one of many great tunes the packed crowd
got down and boogied to last weekend.
And although the set was short — just
over 70 minutes — no one went home
unhappy.
From the opening notes of "Johnny
Came Home," FYC's first hit of their 1986

debut album, lead singer Roland Gift had
the crowd under his intoxicating influence.
The high-pitched, unusually soulful
voice that has become the band's
trademark is even more powerful in a live
performance.
When London's all-women's a capella
group, The Mint Juleps, got things under
way, the evening showed promise from
the start.
Next in line came the rhythmic Tom
Tom Club, which boasts two members of
the Talking Heads.
Once the successful opening acts were
off the stage, the crowd was more than
ready to see what is easily one of this

year's best bands. The three-piece lineup
of Gift, guitarist Andy Cox and bass player
David Steele, has dominated the pop charts
with their sizzling second album, "The
Raw and the Cooked."
The album remains in the Top Five

after 27 weeks, already turning out two
number-one songs. With "Don't Look
Back," it looks like FYC will soon be
introducing another track into Billboard's
Top Ten.
Alternating tunes from their first and
second albums, the group performed
nearly every song they have recorded.
Even though it was overplayed during
the summer, "Good Thing" stood out as
a real highlight of the show. "Good Thing,"
which is tiresome in its studio version,
really came alive with the three back-up
musicians and a condensed version of The
Mint Juleps.
Only once, however, did the band dis

play their versatility and move beyond
their happy-go-lucky, updated Motown
sound with "Funny How Love Is," a track
from their first album.
Gift dedicated this touching song about
breaking up to "the real men" in the crowd.
The obvious show-closer lived up to
everyone's expectations. "She Drives Me
Crazy," the band's first legitimate U.S.
hit, filled the chilly Friday the 13th evening
air.
"She Drives Me Crazy" is one of those
songs that you can't help but dance to.
And what a great sight it was to see 20,000
people up on their feet, dancing, smiling
and singing under the near-full moon.
