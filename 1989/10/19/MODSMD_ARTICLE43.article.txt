# Belinda GoGos wild with 'Horses'

In 1984, she was merely a Go-
Go. But now it's 1989, and Belinda
Carlisle is sitting pretty on top of
a blossoming solo career. Since the
Go-Gos went bye-bye, Carlisle has
recorded two successful albums,
and her third solo release, "Run
ning Horses," is easily one of the
best pop albums to come out in
recent months.
Unlike many other pop artists,
Carlisle cannot be accused of
taking advantage of her phenom
enal good looks in order to further
her career. Instead, she has relied
on one thing and one thing only
â€” her superb talents as a singer.
From the first track, "Leave A
Light On," to the fading final note
of "Shades of Michaelangelo," Car
lisle proves time and again that
she is one of the best pop vocalists
recording today In addition to her
soothing voice, her songs include
tight choruses and real drums, a

rarity in today's computerized
techno-pop music world.
Since 1986, when she released
"Belinda/' the quality of her music
has steadily improved. Her self
titled debut album was just slightly
better than bubble gum music. She
then progressed through her
idealistic "Heaven On Earth" stage
to reach the fully-mature and ro
mantic sounds of "Running
Horses."
Most pop albums have but one
or two quality songs on them. Not
so with "Running Horses." In fart,
there are so many good songs on
it that it's too difficult to say which
song Carlisle will release after the
first single, "Leave A Light On,"
peaks on the charts. Personal
favorites, though, are the title track
and the up-beat ballad of lost love,
"Summer Rain."
Even though it is Carlisle's daz
zling voice that makes the album,
she does receive some equally im
pressive help. Bryan Adams backs
her up on the pleasant ballad

"Whatever It Takes," while former
Beatle George Harrison lends his
guitar skills on the tracks "Deep
Deep Ocean" and "Leave A Light
On."
Although it's a damn good al
bum, it isn't pure gold. The tracks
"(We Want) The Same Thing" and
"Shades of Michaelangelo" ao fall
a little short when compared with
the rest of the album. Like typical
pop songs, these two are somewhat
boring and pointless. But the al
bum more than makes up for these
shortcomings.
"Running Horses" is not a music
soapbox of shallow personal revela
tions like Debbie Gibson spews
forth. In fact, it would be very
difficult for Carlisle to record such
an album, since she usually co
writes only one or two songs on
each of her releases.
Instead, "Running Horses" is a
very honest pop album from a con
fident and talented Carlisle that
anyone can enjoy.
