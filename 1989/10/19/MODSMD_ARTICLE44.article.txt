# 'Baker Boys' is bland

"The Fabulous Baker Boys" is
the story of two Ramada Inn-style
cocktail lounge piano players who
are flailing for the last time in the
Seattle lounge scene. This changes
when they add the sexy vocals of
Susie Diamond.
Real life brothers Jeff Bridges
("Tucker") and Beau Bridges
("Norma Rae") play the mediocre
piano duo called the Fabulous
Baker Boys. Michelle Pfeiffer, who
played Madame de Tourvel in
"Dangerous Liaisons," is the saucy,
quick-witted former call girl Susie
Diamond.
The movie is rich with solid act
ing and spicy dialogue.
Despite the tremendous trio of
leading characters, the movie is
not going to be one of your all-time
top-10 favorites (unless you would
just die for Jeff Bridges or Michelle
Pfeiffer).
Predictability was around 90
percent. This made for a very long

movie during the build-up scenes,
because the results were all too
obvious. Will they choose Pfeiffer
as their singer? Will their fortunes
change? Will Jeff and Pfeiffer get
together? What will happen to the
band? The choice is yours.
Even so, the movie had a gritty,
"real life" feeling to it.
The hard-life, downtown Seattle
setting where Jeff lived in a seedy
apartment contrasted with the
Beau's home in stereotypical
American suburbia. The film
builds on this contrasting image.
The problem with that "real life"
image is it never makes for excite
ment.
I wouldn't say the movie was
devoid of all merit. When Bridges
finally got away from the "Feel
ings" and "Tiny Bubbles" music
and into the old-jazz-bar-down
the-street mode, the riffs were
pretty sweet.
But â€” you may want to wait
until this movie gets to Flicks.
