# Health and Safety director resigns after four months
## 
### Jock Friedly Editorial staff 
Two large jolts rocked the Health
and Safety Department Tuesday: the
earthquake and the resignation of its
new director.
Citing overcommitment as her major
reason for stepping down from the
newly established post, Carol Hoerner
will leave after only four months on
the job.
Hoerner plans to work full time con
sulting biotechnology firms on safety
matters after she leaves Nov. 1.
Her resignation came as a great
surprise to her staff, which heard the
news Tuesday morning before the
earthquake. "You could say it was a
major surprise to everybody as far as
1 know," said John Holmes, a Health
and Safety employee who has been
aiding Hoerner in the cleanup opera
tion since the earthquake.
The University and Hoerner had
agreed that she would be able to main
tain her commitments as a consultant
while acting as director. Hoerner was
a consultant before coming to Stanford
July 1.

But in a letter to University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy dated Oct. 16,
Hoerner wrote, "It has become clear
that heading the Environmental
Health and Safety Department and
providing the necessary leadership and
advocacy at this critical period and
honoring my pre-existing consulting
commitments could not both be done
with excellence.
"I have made this difficult choice,
which I believe best utilizes my back
ground and skills and will return to
full-time consulting," she wrote.
Kennedy responded, "In only a short
time here, you have accomplished im
portant tasks — for example, reor
ganizing your department and
resolving the important state radiofogi
cal health inspection — and I am sure
you would have continued to expand
your record of accomplishment."
Since Hoerner took the post, she
has had to decl with an investigation
into the University's handling of ra
dioactive materials by the State De
partment of Health Services. The
investigation, which lasted several
months, uncovered more than 30 vio
lations and has been a mt\jor test for

'I have made this difficult
choice, which I believe
best utilizes my back
ground and skills.'

her department.
Hoerner's reorganization of the de
partment occurred in the aftermath of
an employee quitting charging the
University with unsafe conditions,
coverup, intimidation and mismanage
ment.
The employee's allegations
prompted a series of studies about Uni
versity safety that recommended major
changes in the Health and Safety pro
gram. As part of the restructuring,
which has been taking place since last
year, the position of director of envi
ronmental health and safety was es
tablished.
In a communication to Kennedy ear
lier this year Hoerner wrote, "Environ
mental Health and Safety needs to
continue to grow in professional staff
ing and orientation and become more

systematic and ellicient in providing
consultation services to the Universi
ty"
Hoerner had the authority to close
any laboratory deemed unsafe in the
event of an accident or disaster, and
only Kennedy could override her de
cision. Until hours after she an
nounced her resignation, she never
had never used that authority. After
the earthquake, however, Hoerner has
now closed several laboratories until
they are deemed safe.
Hoerner's main strength was
biotechnology safety. Hoerner holds a
Ph.D. in genetics from UC-Berkelev
and she completed postgraduate re
search in molecular biology using
recombinant DNA technology at the
University of Utah Medical Center.
Before coming to Stanford, she had
served as manager of occupational and
environmental affairs at Genentech,
Inc. and as a private consultant in the
area of biotechnology safety.
The search for Hoerner's replace
ment will begin immediately, according
to Su SchafTer, vice president for ad
ministrative resources.
