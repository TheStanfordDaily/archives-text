# Housing solution uncertain
## 
### Lisa Nellor Staff writer 
Over 500 Stanford students evacuated
from their residences by earthquake
damage have been finding out "there's
no place like home" as they attempt to
sort out their future housing options.
"Everyone who was displaced has
been accounted for" and has been of
fered temporary housing at other dorms
on campus through the weekend, ac
cording to Irene Cortinaz, assistant dean
of student affairs.
A more permanent housing solution
is not that simple, however. Keith Guy,
director of Housing and Food Services,
said that "although it is very premature
for us to comment on the outcome,"
the 12 closed residences "will not be
occupied in the near future."
"That's a lot of homeless people," said
junior Sofia Sorensen of Columbae, who
is now in temporary housing. "We're
feeling lost, like there's no place for us,
and we can't really study."
Dean of Student Affairs James Lyons
said the administration is "very con
cerned" about the students, adding,
"Nobody's going to be penalized for not
having a place to live or study."
Inspections of the closed residences
to determine their future status are a
priority, according to Lyons, but he said
"it will take a long time" to complete
the inspections.
After inspections are completed, Uni
versity officials will need to determine
whether to fix a building or completely
replace it, based on the severity of the
damage.
In the meantime, the displaced stu
dents seem to be left in limbo as they
attempt to sort out their options. Sally
Crutchfield, assistant to the director of
housing, said student placement will be
"handled similarly to the closing of
Roble."
"We may transform rooms for three
to rooms for four," she said, identifying
Manzanita Park as the first possible
residence to undergo these changes.
Lyons said all individual students
could be reassigned now, but that it is
impossible to move an entire house in
tact. He added that house members who
do not want to be separated can remain

in temporary housing until final deter
mination of their building's status is
made.
Sophomore Mary Woudenberg, who
was temporarily displaced from the
now-reopened Griffin suites, said she
and her suitemates "couldn't bear to
be separated and forced to live in some
awful University housing," and she im
mediately made a deposit at the Oak
Creek Apartments near campus. "We'd
much rather stay together, even if it
means living off campus," she said.
Apparently, several other students felt
the same way, deluging Oak Creek
rental employee Isabel Purdy with a
number of phone calls. However, she

said it was "no more of an influx than
at the beginning of the school year."
But moving off-campus presents big
problems for students who wonder if
they will receive refunds on their
housing fees and meal plans. Crutchfield
said it has not yet been determined if
students will be released from these Uni
versity contracts.
University officials met for much of
the day yesterday to determine more
specific procedures. They will continue
meeting today.
In addition, housing and Residential
Education officials will meet this morn
ing with representatives from the
evacuated houses.


Whether or not Columbae and the other closed residences will still be home to the students
evacuated Tuesday is the pressing question on the minds of earthquake refugees Cammy
Buraz and Christina Fuller.
