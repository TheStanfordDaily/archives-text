LONDON (AP) — Three people
wrongly convicted 14 years ago for an
IRA bombing walked free yesterday
while the government began an inquiry
into police actions that led an appeals
court to reverse the convictions.
One other man cleared in the pub
bombing case was taken to Belfast where
his attorneys sought bail pending an
appeal of an unrelated murder convic
tion.
"This is a very grave matter for all
who care about justice," Home Secretary
Douglas Hurd told the House of Com
mons.
The appeals court ruling climaxed
years of effort by relatives, former gov
ernment officials, church leaders and
journalists to overturn the verdict.
The sentence of the four had been
upheld in 1977 even though members

of an IRA gang made detailed confes
sions in the case.
"I've been in prison for 15 years for
something I didn't do. I'm totally inno
cent," Gerard Conlon told cheering well
wishers outside the Old Bailey following
his release.
"If you're Irish, and you're arrested
on a terrorist, political type of offense,
you don't stand a chance. You just don't
stand a chance," Conlon said in an in
terview with Independent Television
News.
Roy Amlot of the Office of Public
Prosecutions told the hearing that five
of the officers taking confessions from
the three men had altered documents,
withheld evidence and "seriously misled
the court."
Lord Lane, the Lord Chief Justice,
responded: "In fact, they must have
lied."
