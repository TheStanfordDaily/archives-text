## Massive Soviet airlift underway 
### 
KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) — Rockets
slammed into the capital's airport and
civilian flights were halted yesterday as
the Soviet Union was reported to be
undertaking the largest airlift since its
military withdrawal eight months ago.
The government said shelling in
Kabul killed 12 people and wounded 35,
though two doctors at a hospital that
monitors casualties said they did not
know of any victims.
The U.S.-backed guerrillas also
shelled a strategic town near the Pakis
tan border, killing nine people, the gov
ernment said.
Diplomatic sources in Kabul and Is
lamabad, Pakistan, said it was the lar
gest Soviet airlift since February, when
Soviet troops ended their nine-year in
tervention in Afghanistan.
Diplomats in Kabul said Soviet-built
Antonov-12 transport planes were flying
continuously into the airport, dropping
off weapons and food for soldiers. They
said the planes were also flying night
missions.
Two soldiers said all commercial traf
fic was shut down for most of the af
ternoon but Soviet transport planes
were operating despite the shelling. Wit
nesses said at least five rockets hit the
airport grounds, but there were no im
mediate casualty or damage reports
there.
U.S. Rep. Don Ritter, R-Pa., esti
mated Moscow has increased its aid to
$400 million this month. The previous
figure had been $250 million to $300

million a month. U.S. aid to the guer
rillas has been estimated at $500 to
$600 million a year.
An Asian diplomat said the airlift,
expected to continue into next week,
demonstrated the Kremlin's commit
ment to the government of President
Nsgib.
"Many people underestimated their
resolve after they picked up and left,"
he said. "But they cannot afford to lose
Afghanistan, especially with all their
problems in Eastern Europe."
Guerrillas have been firing rockets
and artillery from the mountains sur
rounding Khost, said government
spokesman Muhammed Nabi Amani.
"Areas of Khost were heavily shelled
resulting in the deaths of six servicemen
and three civilians," Amani said.
The spokesman said the Afghan air
force attacked the positions and killed
or wounded hundreds of guerrillas. He
did not specify when the fighting oc
curred.
Khost is 100 miles southeast of the
capital and about 25 miles west of the
border with Pakistan, where most of
the guerrillas are based.

Western diplomats in Pakistan have
said guerrilla forces were advancing on
Khost and that the government was
trying to reinforce it by air. Amani said
the town was being supplied but refused
to say whether a convoy of 200 trucks
that left Kabul one week ago had arrived
in Khost.
Guerrilla sources earlier said the con
voy marked the government's first at
tempt to supply Khost by land since
Jan. 18, 1988.
Guerrilla forces have been trying
since this summer to take Khost. The
offensive follows the guerrillas' failure
to take Jalalabad, another eastern city
about 45 miles from the Pakistani bor
der and 75 miles from the capital.
Two Asian diplomats said the guer
rillas apparently switched their target
to Khost, which is farther from the cap
ital and closer to Pakistan, thus more
easily supplied.
All during yesterday, sounds of out
going missiles echoed throughout Kabul.
Several soldiers said some of the rockets
had been misfiring and exploding over
the city.
Incoming missiles that hit several
parts of the capital kicked up huge
clouds of dust when viewed from a hill
outside town.
More than 350 people have been killed
and 800 injured since June in rocket
attacks on the city. The government
blames the guerrillas; the guerrillas say
the government is rocketing its own
people.
