## Band's blunder 
### 
COMPLAINTS ABOUND
that the Band never learns
new songs. Each week it is
"White Punks on Dope," "She
Blinded Me With Science" and, of
course, "All Right Now."
At the Notre Dame football
game, the Band unveiled a new
song. Unfortunately good inten
tions and a new song aren't always
enough.
The song was "Paradise City"
by Guns N' Roses, and many fans
were keenly aware of the continu
ally blatant racist lyrics that the
band puts out.
Axl Rose, lead singer of the
group, has authored lyrics such as,
"Niggers . . . get out of my
way/Don't want to buy/None of
your gold chains today." In addi
tion to this incident, there are
many other cases of slurs against
blacks, homosexuals, immigrants

and more.
Songs by the group have no place
being played by the Stanford Band.
This is not should say that the
University to step in and prohibit
the Band from playing the song.
Indeed, the University's attempt
to stop the Band from playing
"White Punks on Dope" was cen
sorship of an independent group
by an outside authority.
Instead, the Band should assume
its own responsibility by not pro
moting the ideas or music of a
band that is racist clearly.
By playing a Guns N' Roses song
at halftime of the game, despite
the notoriety the rock group has
gained because of its lyrics, the
Band displayed an insensitivity
that is easily correctable: Don't
play Guns N' Roses anymore.
But do try to learn some new
songs.
