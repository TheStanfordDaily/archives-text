The new technology of
voice mail has come to Stanford
— but at a whopping cost of
$200,000 for the first 1,400 users.
Traditionalists who suppose that
voice mail is nothing more than a
great big answering machine sys
tem will wonder why the Univer
sity doesn't simply buy lots of the
old technology answering mac
hines.
After all, the old machines are
easy to use and, most important,
inexpensive. The University would
only have to shell out about one
third as much money to buy 1,400
answering machines.
In fact, Bob March, manager of
Consulting Services for Communi
cation Services, admits that
answering machines are the
cheapest way to service single-line
phones whose users just want to

have their calls answered.
But voice mail can do much more
for its users than merely take mes
sages. For example, a voice mail
user can leave messages without
interrupting the recipient and send
a single message to many recipients
at once.
A user can respond to a message
immediately and relay messages.
March says that a voice mail sys
tem is actually the cheapest way
to service multi-line phones. He
adds that voice mail can help in
crease worker productivity.
For example, if librarians leave
information about library hours on
their voice mail system, they won't
be distracted from their work by
caller after caller asking the same
questions.
Students and staff will have to
wait and see if voice mail proves
worth the cost — in the meantime,
progress marches on.
