Jackson, protesters exhausted channels for change

I WRITE AS a faculty member and
director of African and Afro-
American studies, to ask University
President Donald Kennedy for his
intervention in the case of Louis Jack
son.
Jackson acted according to a recent
historical pattern where students have
found that the protest mechanism is
an effective way to bring about institu
tional change in those areas of the
intellectual life of the university that
have proven themselves to be resistant
to change when dealt with through
normal channels.
From my own experience in African
and Afro-American Studies with the
problem presented by the mtyor, for
which, over the past decade we have
been unable to obtain any of the
needed faculty resources to ensure its
intellectual viability, I can be a witness
to the fact that the normal channels

have proved utterly incapable of ensur
ing effective results.
All of the faculty members who
served on the Steering Committee with
me over the years will also attest to
the truth of the above statement, given
the persistent failure of all our efforts
to secure the most minimal number of
faculty billets required to ensure the
academic validity of the mqjor.
Therefore given the lack, in the past,
of any administrative channel to en
sure affective input on the part of new
interdisciplinary programs like ours
into the processes of decision-making
with respect to the intellectual issues
that directly effect us, it was clear that
a vacuum existed in which the protest
mechanism of student action inserted
itself.
However, recently, we have, as a
Steering Committee, received as
surances from our cognizant dean,

Theodore Anderson, that the situation
is to be remedied; whilst procedures
are now in place for us to have that
input that could in the future make
such protest actions unnecessary
Given the situation in which all sides
have begun to direct their best efforts
to address the issues that were raised
by the students, I strongly feel that in
allowing an unprecedented punishment
to be imposed on a single student
participant, and one, in particular, who
comes from a group that has been and
continues to be the most subjected to a
tradition of such victimage punish
ments, the university, if it did not
intervene through the President, would
by default make Jackson into a student
martyr.
Whilst this would be unfair to Jack
son himself, it would also be coun
terproductive for us all. For this would
mean that our collective energies that

should be spent in implementing the
much needed changes that are now
underway, thanks, to be fair, to the
students' protest actions themselves,
would now be sidetracked by what is,
in effect, given the contextual circum
stances, clearly a subsidiary issue.
Perhaps even worse, the creative
energies that you and your administra
tion have brought to bear on the
difficult problem of interracial relation
ships here on campus, would be signif
icantly undercut should you refrain
from intervening in a situation which,
whatever the complex truth of the
matter, the ongoing legal prosecution
of Jackson cannot help but be widely
perceived as being a racially biased
action that verges on persecution.
