# Starting of classes is insensitive to homeless students
## 
### 
As a displaced Columbaen, I would
first like to thank the surviving resi
dences, especially on the Row, for
taking in "refugees" and to University
Food Service for feeding us.
I also appreciate the efforts Univer
sity administrators have made to work
out the logistical nightmares of getting
Stanford back on its feet.
However, I felt that the decision to
start classes yesterday was insensitive
to the many students who are homeless
at this point.
What's the rush? As I write this
now, it is 7:00 p.m., Wednesday night,
and all I know is that classes are
starting tomorrow. I don't know which

classes are going to be held. I don't
know where I'm going to live tonight,
let alone the rest of the quarter.
The fact that professors have been
asked to be "lenient" and "understand
ing" is of little comfort to me when I
can't even get into my room to get my
books because there is a sign on my
house stating: "DO NOT ENTER —■
Serious Structural Damage — May
Result In Injury Or Death," (or in
deafness, as the fire alarm is still
blaring throughout the house.)
And while some students may have
been restless or bored with the "mini
vacation" we had on Wednesday with
no classes, many of us spent a very
agitating and emotional day, unable to
concentrate or think about anything
except the fact that we may have per
manently lost our homes.
Please do remember that it's not just
cracked buildings we're talking about.
Columbae was a home to 41 people.

and the insensitivity of people riding
by and yelling, "Hey, did you see that
crack?!" without acknowledging or
respecting the emotional turmoil of
former residents is greatly disturbing.
I'm not asking for pity or a free ride
or a handout. I came to Stanford to
work hard and learn. But Stanford is
not merely an institution of higher
learning; it is a community. And even
those who still have their residences
are a bit shaken (pardon the pun) by
the experience.
In closing, I'd just like to say that
when Columbae "walked off its founda
tion" Tuesday afternoon, I didn't just
lose a place to live. 1 lost a little part
of my life. And I need some time to
get it back again.
And I don't think one more day of
missed classes — one more day to
better inspect classrooms, administra
tion buildings and residences and bet
ter coordinate information — is going

to seriously disrupt anything beyond
what has already happened.
