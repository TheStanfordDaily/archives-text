# And by the way...

### 
On Saturday, Oct. 14, we in the
Care Unit and Infirmary of Channing
House were privileged to have a visit
and wonderful entertainment through
the Reach Out Program.
The students were residents of
Faisan in Florence Moore, and they
helped serve ice cream cones for our
October birthday party, sang and
danced and made the day a memorable
event for all of our seniors!
A job well done and we are looking
forward to their next visit.
