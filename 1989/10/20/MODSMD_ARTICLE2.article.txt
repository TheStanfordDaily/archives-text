# At Hoover Tower, the bells played on
## 
### Jock Friedly Editorial staff 
From atop Hoover Tower, the highest
point in the Stanford area, lofted the
sounds of panic, books crashing — and
then the sweet sound of music from the
still-intact, if out-of-tune, bells.
Undaunted by the scene of destruc
tion around him after Tuesday's earth
quake, carilloneur James Angell — who
doubles as a professor of electrical en
gineering — climbed over the 2-foot
high stacks of books to play the Flemish
Dance on Hoover's bells.
It all started as Angell, who has been
playing the bells for 30 years, was pre
paring for his weekly 5 p.m. carillon

recital. He was running about four
minutes late and was just changing his
shoes when he felt the tower begin to
shake.
At first Angell, his fellow musician
Timothy Zerlang and their three invited
audience members didn't know what to
think. "And then it really began to
shake," recalls Angell.
Thousands of books, carefully stored
on bookshelves on the 13th floor of the
283-foot Hoover, collapsed almost as if
on a cue from an invisible conductor.
"They just bent over and collapsed,"
says Robin Blackman, a secretary at
Hoover who was one of the guests. "It
was so intense that I didn't think it
was happening."

The building shook violently for 30
seconds, and"it was definitely feeling
that it could fall," she says.
In the end, they were all fine. Beneath
them was a campus shaken and broken.
Above them was the clear blue sky. And
then there was music.
After a few warm-up notes, Angell
boldly played a one-minute concert, just
long enough to check to see if the bells
were OK. The door was blocked with
bookshelves, and tomes were stacked
waist deep. But after the short recital,
the five cleared a path to the door and
fled down the dozen flights of stairs.
Angell considers it to be one of the
best experiences he has ever had.
