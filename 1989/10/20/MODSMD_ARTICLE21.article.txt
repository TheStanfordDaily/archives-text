## 'Right Thing' hits home 
### 
I RESISTED IT most of the summer.
I wanted to see it from the day it
opened, but I was not sure I wanted
to confront the issues it would inevitably
raise, Simply, I didn't want to see it be
cause I didn't want to hear what I thought
it had to say.
No other film, besides "Batman," gen
erated as much commentary this summer
as Spike Lee's "Do the Right Thing," and
as a source of controversy, it was peerless.
Some of the more paranoid and reac
tionary commentators predicted a long,
hot summer of urban mayhem because
of the film; for those critics, Lee was just
irresponsible.
Others hailed it as a much needed dose
of reality for the liberal cognoscenti.
In truth, it was neither. It was not
"dynamite under every seat" ready to
erupt in movie-house violence, as Jack
Kroll fretted in Newsweek. Nor was it a
-eality-soaked depiction of black urban
life; the fear and loathing of the drug
trade were conspicuously absent from this
film about urban black life in America.
Nevertheless, I was still nervous about
seeing it. I was in no mood for a tirade
about the inherent evilness of whites,
and I did not want to see blacks portrayed
as holier-than-thou victims.
I wanted to see something approaching
real life, something that might tell me
about my society, and maybe my univer
sity. The issue of race relations is too
important to manipulate to one's personal
political views.
Well, it's a terrific film. It's an impor
tant film, too, and that's why I finally
relentsd when my brother suggested we

see it in late August. As a Stanford stu
dent, I also felt it was my responsibility.
Some critics criticized the film for
failing to articulate a point of view. That
is the point of view. Spike Lee raises the
questions but refuses to answer them.
He probably hasn't made up his mind
on what the "right thing" is, but he
knows he isn't seeing it today. It's lost
in ambiguity. It's just not as clear-cut as
people would like it.
Lee could have easily manipulated the
subject matter to make his own political
points, whatever they may be. I know
little about his own political viewpoints,
and I don't know anymore after seeing
the film.
That's why this is an important film.
It forces one to consider the ambiguity
between good and bad, and then allows
one to make up one's own mind.
But it's not easy to reach a conclusion.
There are no heroes in this film. What
appears clear on the surface loses its
distinction and clarity when Lee looks
deeper.
Sal, the primary white character, ap
pears to be the most sympathetic lead,
but is that because I, a white male, simply
want him to be most sympathetic?
A string of disgusting racist indict
ments — the film's most poignant scene
— spews forth from a black, an Italian,
a Puerto Rican, a white and a Korean.
If anyone's guilty, Lee seems to be saying,
then everyone's guilty. That is a disturb
ing — but perhaps plausible — idea.
"Do the Right Thing" should be re
quired viewing for entering Stanford stu
dents. Forget CIV and increased Non-

'Do the Right Thing'
forces one to consider the
ambiguity between good
and bad, and then allows
one to make up one's own
mind.

Western Culture requirements. This
devastating film addresses the problems
and pressures of a multicultural society
and it will make people think.
My brother and I wondered whether
people got the film; was anyone thinking
any differently? Was it reaching the
people who needed to do some rethinking?
We both doubted that it was. That's
why students should be forced to watch
and discuss this film. People of all races
and cultures need to consider the ques
tions Lee raises, even if they don't reach
a final consensus on what is right.
Too few people give race relations the
attention they deserve; that must be
turned around before this campus — and
perhaps the country — tears itself apart.
Agree with Spike Lee or not, this film
gets in your face. And you are the one
who will flinch.
