## The
						Bug expounds on quakes, quacks, cleaning at Flicks 
### Aram Irwin 
So there I was, in the middle
of one of the enormous warehouse
aisles at the Price Club, when the
floor began to undulate. Bicycles,
jars, packages of diapers teetered
precariously on the edge of the
towering shelves. A mass of ex
cited shoppers and I surged for
the exit as jars of salsa rained
down around us. An equally ex
cited group surged back in, nacho
chips in hand, intent on cleaning
up the mess.
Outside, an 18-year-old with
long, stringy hair turned to his
mustached buddy and exclaimed,
"Dude, that musta been a two on
the Richter Scale!" "Yeah!" his
buddy agreed, "maybe even a
three]" A three? These two were
not Stanford material. Any Stan
ford student, fuzzies included,
should be able to explain the Rich
ter Scale to their high school
buddies currently attending Big
State U or City Community Col
lege.
Because if you can't, you're
missing out on a opportu
nity to be smug without even once
pointing at your STANFORD
emblazoned sweatshirt. (We have
to set the standard for our snobby
Harvard friends, right?) And if
you're already thoroughly familiar
with the Richter Scale, go ahead
— lean back, savor a big, smug
grin. You've earned it.
Dear Bug,
How does the Richter Scale
work? What does a jump from
one number to the next mean?
And what kind of magnitudes do
these seemingly arbitrary num
bers imply?
— Quaked and Confused
Funny that you should ask. And

to keep the Science Bug from
whining, I'll try to keep my an
swer as non-scientific as possible.
(The fact that my Geology 001
textbook and notes are locked up
in the evacuated Slavianskii Dom
has nothing to do with it. Really.)
Basically, the Richter Scale is
an exponential scale, similar to
the Kennedy Scale, which deter
mines our yearly tuition hikes; a
jump from one number to the next
on either of these scales would
indicate a tenfold increase in phys
ical or financial damage.
So if you compared the 1906
San Francisco earthquake, at 8.3
on the Richter Scale, to ... hmm
.. . say, a 7.0 earthquake, you
would find that the 1906 earth
quake was 1.3 larger — on the
Richter Scale.
In the real world, however, the
1906 earthquake was 10 to the
1.3, or more than ten times har
sher than our measly little 7.0.
So believe your grandpa when he
says, "Things really were harder
in my day." (But don't believe him
when he tells you he had to slog
barefoot through 20 miles of snow
just to get to school. After all,

older heads are not necessarily
wiser heads — just older. And who
wants an old head, anyway? Most
would prefer, I think, a young
head over an old head, although
some might argue that you should
be appreciative of any head you
get at all. But that's fodder for
another column ... .)
To illustrate the scale of mag
nitude of these Richter numbers,
a 3.0 earthquake would only be
felt by UC-Berkeley Weenies, who,
sources report, are jealous of our
earthquake school-break and des
perate for some reason to cancel
classes in light of the minor jolt
their campus received. On the
other end of the scale, a 14.0
earthquake would shatter planet
Earth, leaving you, you flabby
little baby, floating in a vacuum.
Yeh, so there.
Dear Bug,
What happened to the ducks?
— Lisa, Sophomore
Well, Lisa, in Sept. 25th's home
game against Oregon State, the
Cardinal overcame a 17 point def
icit to quash the Ducks 18-17. Or
so I hear. I left in the fourth
quarter. Except for that game,
Stanford hasn't won all season,
so I'd say what happened to the
Ducks was that they were damn
unlucky.
But the situation regarding the
ducks usually congregating in the
currently pumped-dry Terman
muck-hole . . . uh, I mean pond
. . . is a much happier one. Con
trary to popular opinion, the fact
that the ducks are gone and that
Food Service really has been serv
ing more chicken dishes than
usual is merely a coincidence,
nothing more.

Yes, the Terman ducks are
gone, but they're off to Tijuana
and other parts down south,
where they're baking in the sun
only. I talked with Helen Beasley
in the Engineering Dean's office
regarding the duck/pond situa
tion. Helen told me that the pond
is dry so that it can be cleaned
out more easily.
And the ducks? "We didn't get
rid of them," Helen protested, "in
fact, we re-jigged our schedules
to clean out the pond only after
they'd left." Helen went on to ex
plain that the University usually
uses chemicals to clean out the
pond, but has refrained from
doing so this time because, as El
len said, "We just don't want to
hurt the ducks." Who says techies
don't have hearts?
Provided no major structural
damage resulting from the recent
earthquake has occurred, the Ter

man Pond should be refilled some
time this weekend.
Dear Bug,
What happens to all the paper
wads and airplanes thrown at
ASSU Sunday Flicks? Who cleans
it up? How much are they paid?
— Curious Froshperson
Who? Why, Acme Janitorial
Services disposes of the mess, of
course. No kidding. I talked to an
Acme representative, Wile E.
Coyote, about your query. Appar
ently, it takes a team of 3 or 4
people about 10 hours to clean up
the mess. A combination of
vacuuming, sweeping, and hand
picking usually does the job for
Acme.
Acme charges $8.95 an hour for
its services, although the employ
ees, I would imagine, are probably

not paid much above minimum
wage, since they've most likely
only got degrees from UC schools.
So if you figure that it costs about
$350 to clean up after every show
and that 75 percent of Memorial
Auditorium's 1700 seats are taken
each show, then each person in
the audience is paying about a
quarter for the opportunity to test
out their latest aeronautical de
signs and to bop their current
crush (giggle, giggle) with a wad
of newspaper.
Thus, if you go to every movie,
you're paying about $2.50 of your
Flicks pass money for the fes
tivities and $9.50 for the actual
movies. I suggest people don't
throw paper the last nine shows,
but instead throw wadded-up dol
lar bills the first show only. It
would be a lot more fun, especially
for those of us on heavy financial
aid.
