## 49ers to meet Pats at Farm, proceeds to assist Bay Area 
### Howard Caro Staff writer 
As a result of Tuesday's earth
quake, the San Francisco 49ers
announced that their Sunday Na
tional Football League game with
the New England Patriots will be
moved to Stanford Stadium.
Tickets will be made available
to Stanford faculty and students
for $25 and $10 respectively with
proceeds from the tickets going
to the Bay Area Earthquake Relief
Fund. Faculty and students with
valid I.D. cards will be able to buy
tickets at the Stanford Athletic
Ticket office from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m.
today.
The game will start at 1 p.m.
Pacific time as regularly sched
uled. The only reserved seats will
be one section for Candlestick
luxury suite holders, but since
Stanford Stadium holds 20,000
more people than Candlestick,
seating should not pose major
problems.
The game was originally sched
uled for Candlestick Park, but
San Francisco Mayor Art Agnos
requested that 49ers' owner Ed
ward Deßartolo, Jr. change the
site. "Among other significant
problems," Agnos wrote to Deßar
tolo, "the earthquake situation
has resulted in my request of you

to consider alternative sites for
your October 22 game against
New England scheduled for
Candlestick."
The Mayor announced that the
"most optimistic projection would
not allow for certification (of
Candlestick) prior to Saturday
(October 21)." Such circum
stances made it unrealistic to plan
on a Sunday game at Candlestick.
"I would not have taken this
step unless it was absolutely nec
essary. However, I am sure you
support our desire to insure public
safety and recognize the other
m£gor issues that our community
is now facing," Agnos said.
Deßartolo contacted Stanford
Athletic Director Andy Geiger,
who then offered Stanford Sta
dium as a prospective site. Pres
ident Donald Kennedy explained
why the University decided to
help out. "We are pleased that we
are able to accommodate the San
Francisco 49ers. As part of the
recovery, and in this community's
effort to return to normal, we
made this gesture with the spirit
and vitality of the Bay Area in
mind."
Stanford Stadium has been
declared structurally sound fol
lowing inspections by structural
engineers and university facilities
personnel.

NFL Commissioner Pete
Rozelle supported the relocation.
"In light of the enormity of the
disaster which confronts the en
tire Bay Area, we believe this is
the most prudent and equitable
short-term solution to the rela
tively minor problem we faced."
Deßartolo offered his praise and
thanks to the University. "We
really appreciate Stanford's hos
pitality and willingness to help us
keep our Bay Area 'home
schedule' intact by offering an al
ternative site due to the current
situation. We are all excited about
playing before our hometown
fans, and I personally think it will
be fun to get back to Stanford
Stadium for this game. ... It
might just bring back some Super
Bowl memories for our fans and
players," he said.
The 49ers last played in Stan
ford Stadium on January 20, 1985
in Super Bowl XIX, a 38-16 San
Francisco victory over the Miami
Dolphins.
Freshman Jason Keyes said
Stanford students are eager to
host the 49ers. "It's not often that
I get to see an NFL game," he
said. "Besides, 10 bucks is cheap
for professional football, espe
cially when it's in your own back
yard."
