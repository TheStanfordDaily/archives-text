After an upsetting loss to Pepperdine Sunday,
the Stanford water polo team hopes to get back on
track this weekend as it travels south to Los Angeles
to meet No. 6 UCLA and No. 7 USC. The trip does

"This is always a tough road trip," Dettamanti
said. "We have to play two important games back
to back."
Having dropped a notch to No. 4 in this week's
poll, the Cardinal is once again forced to worry
about staying in the top five. The NCAA selection
committee only allows five California teams into
the national tournament and, as of now, the top
seven teams are all from California.
"It's the same old story," Dettamanti said. "We
have to stay in the top five. UCLA is No. 6 and
wants to be in the top five. They are right on the
border. If they beat us, they will move up."
USC is highly ranked, yet, according to Det
tamanti, poses less of a threat.
"I think [USC] has pretty much decided they are

not going to the NCAAs," Dettamanti said. "But
they still have a chance."
The weekend trip carries additional weight due
to the fact that both games count towards Pacific
10 Conference standings. Stanford beat USC last
Friday to win its Pac-10 opener, and because the
league's season consists of only six games per team,
the Cardinal would like to come back home with
three Pac-10 wins under its belt.
"The Pac-10 is important," Dettamanti said. "If
we win these two games, we go to 3-0 with only
three games left."
The coach added, though, that the main emphasis
