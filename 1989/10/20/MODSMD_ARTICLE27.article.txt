# Water polo eyes Bruins, Trojans

### T.C. Hall Staff writer 
After an upsetting loss to Pepperdine Sunday,
the Stanford water polo team hopes to get back on
track this weekend as it travels south to Los Angeles
to meet No. 6 UCLA and No. 7 USC. The trip does
not excite Coach Dante Dettamanti.
"This is always a tough road trip," Dettamanti
said. "We have to play two important games back
to back."
Having dropped a notch to No. 4 in this week's
poll, the Cardinal is once again forced to worry
about staying in the top five. The NCAA selection
committee only allows five California teams into
the national tournament and, as of now, the top
seven teams are all from California.
"It's the same old story," Dettamanti said. "We
have to stay in the top five. UCLA is No. 6 and
wants to be in the top five. They are right on the
border. If they beat us, they will move up."
USC is highly ranked, yet, according to Det
tamanti, poses less of a threat.
"I think [USC] has pretty much decided they are

not going to the NCAAs," Dettamanti said. "But
they still have a chance."
The weekend trip carries additional weight due
to the fact that both games count towards Pacific
10 Conference standings. Stanford beat USC last
Friday to win its Pac-10 opener, and because the
league's season consists of only six games per team,
the Cardinal would like to come back home with
three Pac-10 wins under its belt.
"The Pac-10 is important," Dettamanti said. "If
we win these two games, we go to 3-0 with only
three games left."
The coach added, though, that the main emphasis
is trying to go to the national
championships. To do that, the
team must get by UCLA, a team
which beat the Cardinal 7-5 in
the Irvine tournament earlier this
year. Dettamanti will do things
differently this time around.
"UCLA is not that great a de
fensive team," Dettamanti said.
"We are going to change tactics
and play a pressing defense."
According to the coach, this de
fense suits his team's fast break
better than the zone which Stan

ford used against UCLA in Sep
tember.
"The zone is hard on good fast
break teams," Dettamanti said.
"The press opens up our fast
break. The only problem is it
sacrifices the hole guard."
Alex Rouseau, a member of the
U.S. National Team, plays hole
for UCLA. Dettamanti coached
Rouseau last summer and is con
fident that his team can hold him
in check.
"[Rouseau] and Clark from
Pepperdine are the two best two
meter men in the country,"
Dettamanti said. "[Rouseau] is
very good, but I think [Rick]
McNair can do it."
Saturday's USC game does not
worry Dettamanti as much. The
Cardinal has beaten the Trojans
twice, the last being a 14-5 whol
loping.
"We won't change things much
[from the last game]," Dettamanti
said. "We'll start pressing and
may vary the defense."
