# Field hockey readies for Cal Invite
## 
### John Louie Staff writer 
With three conference oppo
nents looming ahead, the Stanford
women's field hockey team enters
tomorrow's Cal Invitational un
derneath two large clouds of
speculation.
The first cloud of doubt lies
over the team's newly found of
fensive power, unleashed for the
first time against a stunned Chico
State team Saturday. The Cardi
nal bombarded the Wildcats with
12 shots and 11 corners, dwarfing
their opponent's 13 shots and
three corners. Although Stanford
lost 2-0, both the coaching staff
and the team's members ex

pressed delight with the Cardi
nal's offensive threat.
"We pushed Chico really hard
throughout the entire game," for
ward Erin Mc√üride said. "We to
tally dominated the game."
"The team did everything that
we have been working on for the
past two weeks," Coach Sheryl
Johnson said. "We played a really
good game."

This newfound offensive ability
proves timely for the Cardinal,
which has been plagued by a lack
of shooting throughout the
season. In the upcoming tourna
ment schedule, Stanford faces Cal
ifornia today, Pacific tomorrow
and Chico State again on Sunday.
Although all three opponents are
members of the Northern Pacific
Conference, Cal Invitation games
are regarded as non-conference,
Division I matches.
Currently, Stanford posts a 1-
2-2 conference record and a 1-5-2
record overall.
But the fate of Stanford's of
fense is not the only question for
this upcoming tournament. This
weekend, the Cardinal team mem
bers will lose Coach Johnson, a
member of the national field
hockey team, who must attend a
tournament in India. Johnson will
divert her attentions from coach
ing to helping the United States
qualify for the 1992 Olympic
Games.
"I think the team should be
okay," Johnson said. "Noelle Nel
son will take over in my absence."
Nelson, currently in her seventh
season as an assistant coach for
the Cardinal, helped lead San Jose

State to a No. 4 national ranking
as starting goalkeeper.
Nelson will also be flanked by
coaches Suzanne Doi and Andi
Wolpert. Johnson will miss the
remaining five games of the
season, including the team's four
match, East Coast trip.
"Post-season play depends on
this weekend's tournament,"
Johnson said.
If Stanford wins the conference
title, it will receive an automatic
bid to the NCAA playoffs, which
reserves spots for only 12 teams
in the nation.
"Although we may not win the
conference," Johnson said, "if we
can finish out the rest of the
season strong, then we still could
get a wildcard bid in the playoffs."
