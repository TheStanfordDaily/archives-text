# Displaced students yearn for homes

"House severely damaged â€” please
replace."
This request from members of
Grove Lasuen added a bit of humor
to yesterday's meeting between Uni
versity officials and homeless stu
dents outside the closed Columbae
House.
Row refugees, displaced from their
residences as a result of Tuesday's
earthquake, called the meeting in an
effort to open up communication
channels with the University and to
express their concerns, according to
Columbae resident Sally Otto.
The refugees asked the adminis
tration for a more detailed account
of the condition of their homes and
demanded a larger role in the
decision-making process.
"The University is making deci
sions without student input, and
they're not even informing us," said
Columbae resident Michael Wooding.
Students asked administrators to
share information about the fate of
their houses as soon as possible so
they would have time to explore other
options such as off-campus housing.

Residents of Phi Sig said their cook
doesn't know if he has a job.
"We were given 10 to 15 minutes
to get everything out. I don't have
all my belongings," said Columbae
resident Grace Chin, a senior.
Diana Conklin, assistant dean of
residential affairs, said she empa
thizes with the students. "Not
knowing which house will open when
is driving us nuts," she said. "I swear
to you that you will know the minute
we do."
University officials are scheduled
to discuss which residences will be
permanently closed for repair or
reconstruction at a meeting with all
displaced students today at 5 p.m. in
Kresge.
Administrators intend to create a
Housing Relocation Task Force, com
posed of University officials, a Coun
cil of President member and members
of the closed residences, to review
the issues raised at yesterday's meet
ing.
The students also discussed options
for dealing with the immediate
stresses of academics while coping
with their homeless situation.
