# Displaced students yearn for homes
## 
### Liz Lempert Staff writer 
"House severely damaged — please
replace."
This request from members of
Grove Lasuen added a bit of humor
to yesterday's meeting between Uni
versity officials and homeless stu
dents outside the closed Columbae
House.
Row refugees, displaced from their
residences as a result of Tuesday's
earthquake, called the meeting in an
effort to open up communication
channels with the University and to
express their concerns, according to
Columbae resident Sally Otto.
The refugees asked the adminis
tration for a more detailed account
of the condition of their homes and
demanded a larger role in the
decision-making process.
"The University is making deci
sions without student input, and
they're not even informing us," said
Columbae resident Michael Wooding.
Students asked administrators to
share information about the fate of
their houses as soon as possible so
they would have time to explore other
options such as off-campus housing.

Residents of Phi Sig said their cook
doesn't know if he has a job.
"We were given 10 to 15 minutes
to get everything out. I don't have
all my belongings," said Columbae
resident Grace Chin, a senior.
Diana Conklin, assistant dean of
residential affairs, said she empa
thizes with the students. "Not
knowing which house will open when
is driving us nuts," she said. "I swear
to you that you will know the minute
we do."
University officials are scheduled
to discuss which residences will be
permanently closed for repair or
reconstruction at a meeting with all
displaced students today at 5 p.m. in
Kresge.
Administrators intend to create a
Housing Relocation Task Force, com
posed of University officials, a Coun
cil of President member and members
of the closed residences, to review
the issues raised at yesterday's meet
ing.
The students also discussed options
for dealing with the immediate
stresses of academics while coping
with their homeless situation.
"The University is holding class
in order to maintain a sense of
normalcy," said Durand resident
John Cuerva, a senior. "This is
psychologically beneficial for those
students who have residences.
However, for those students who
don't have permanent residences,
attending classes in a normal
manner is impossible," he said.
Cuerva has authored a petition
addressed to University President
Donald Kennedy asking for
classes to be cancelled one day
next week to give students time
to move. About 300 students have
signed the petition, Cuerva said.
"It's hard to maintain academic
parity with your peers when you
don't have a house," Cuerva said.
He said he appreciated Kennedy's
Wednesday call for professors to
be lenient on deadlines, but added
that many students are already
taking midterms. "If you postpone
midterms, then they're right next
to finals," he said.
In addition to Kennedy's re
quest for professors to postpone
assignments, Conklin told the ref
ugees she would ask the Univer
sity to wave the Pass/No Credit
deadline for all displaced students.
The official deadline to declare
the grading option was last Fri
day.
Refugees wishing to declare the
P/NC option must apply individ
ually at the Academic Standing
Office in Old Union to wave the
deadline.
Displaced residents also raised
questions about the long-term fu
ture of their houses and the co-op
system. Six of the 12 closed res
idences are co-ops, as is one of
the limited-access houses.
The displaced co-op residents
asked for a guarantee that their
houses will remain co-ops in the

event they are temporarily closed
for repair or reconstruction.
"This is a prime time for the
University to end co-ops. Our way
of life is vital to us and I have a
feeling we're going to get
screwed," said Columbae resident
Ann Fridlind.
Evan and Ann Porteus, resident
fellows in Roble Hall who attended
the meeting, offered "living proof
that things can be fixed," Ann
Porteus said. However, she added
that she was "sorry to see a lot
of the same faces as two years
. _ >>
ago.
Approximately 20 students dis
placed from their houses as a
result of the earthquake were also
Roble refugees.
Mail delivered to closed residen
ces is being redirected to the Row
Facilities Office. Students with
their IDs can pick up their mail
from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m.
Administrators say there is
enough space in existing residen
ces to house all 529 refugees, even
though they total more than
Roble's 300 students.
"We could give you permanent
assignments now, but we're
waiting to see if your houses will
reopen," Conklin said.
"If it's not possible [to keep stu
dents together in their former res
ident groups], the University will
develop mechanisms to enable the
houses to stay together," Assoc.
Dean of Student Affairs Michael
Jackson said.
Members of Kairos plan to move
to a house off-campus in order to
maintain their community if their
house is closed down.
"People go into co-ops because
they want to live in a community
— to live together and cook to
gether," said Chin.
Chin said she hoped the Uni
versity will help Columbae and
other co-ops form communal
kitchen areas if their residents
cannot be housed together.
