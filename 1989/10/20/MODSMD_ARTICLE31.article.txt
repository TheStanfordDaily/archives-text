# Stanford prepares for Utah, quarterback question looms
## 
### Chris Crader Editorial staff 
Six-foot-6, 231 pounds.
Sounds about right for a col
lege linebacker, or maybe a tight
end.
Except when you're talking
about Utah football. For the
Utes, 6-6, 231 is about right for
a quarterback.
Junior southpaw Scott
Mitchell is that big, and he's
pretty good, too. He set 10
NCAA records last year, includ
ing passing for 631 yards in one
game, and led the nation in both
passing and total offense.
So far this season he's thrown
25 touchdowns (by way of com
parison, Stanford has scored a
total of only nine TDs this year)
and he is averaging 331.6 yards
per game through the air.
"Scott's an outstanding
player," Ute Coach Jim Fassel
said. "At least for what we do,
I don't see any guy playing col
lege football who's any better."
Mitchell will go against a
Stanford defense that gave up
347 yards passing just last week
in a 31-13 loss to Washington
State. "We're hoping it's not
going to be too high-scoring,"
Stanford Coach Denny Green
said. "Scott Mitchell is a big
time player with a big-time
arm."

Countering Mitchell for the
Cardinal will be Brian Johnson,
who earned the starting role
with his relief apparence against
the Cougars last week. "I think
Steve [Smith, last week's start
ing quarterbackl just didn't ex
ecute," Green explained. "I just
wasn't pleased with our execu
tion, our ability to move the
ball."
Johnson is listed as only ques
tionable due to a nagging shoul

der injury and a bruised knee
suffered Saturday, but he prac
ticed a little yesterday.
Johnson, or Smith if Johnson
can't go, will face a defense that
has held its opponenets below
38 points only once this year.
Despite having eight starters
back on defense, the Utes are
giving up more than 490 yards
of offense per game.


Chris Eisenberg — Daily Me
Freshman Steve Smith may start this Saturday in what promises to be an aerial battle unlike
any other in the country.
"Defense is where we've fallen
behind," Fassel said. "Defensively
we're still a fairly young club.
We're starting to show signs of
getting better. ... We have just
been hurt by too many big plays."
Stanford will start Tom Vardell
and Gary Taylor as the running
backs again due to ir\juries. Run
ning back Jay Jay Lasley, who is
out with a knee sprain, did some
light running at practice yester
day, however, and he may be ready
in time for next week's game
against USC.
So, once again, the Cardinal will
probably throw early and often.
Stanford has thrown 55 more
passes than any other team in
the Pacific 10 Conference and the
Cardinal has three of the top four
in the league in catches per game,
Scott Eschelman, Ed McCaffrey
and Jim Price.

"On offense they look like
they're coming along," Fassel
said. "I think they can be very
explosive."
The defense that Stanford will
face is one of the smallest in big
time college football. The four
down linemen average a mere 235
pounds and the six linebackers
listed on the depth chart average
210.
The Utes also have a short de
fensive backfield. "That 6-6 guy
(McCaffrey) can go up and catch
the ball," Fassel said. "He really
worries me, with our short defen
sive backs."
Utah also has short wide
receivers, but they worry Green
as much as McCaffrey worries
Fassel. "Their receivers are small
and a little bit quicker than Wash
ington State's," Green said.
"We're going to have to get some
pressure with our front four, our
three linemen and an outside
backer. We can't afford to have
to blitz all the time to get pres
sure."

backs again due to ir\juries. Run
ning back Jay Jay Lasley, who is
out with a knee sprain, did some
light running at practice yester
day, however, and he may be ready
in time for next week's game
against USC.
So, once again, the Cardinal will
probably throw early and often.
Stanford has thrown 55 more
passes than any other team in
the Pacific 10 Conference and the
Cardinal has three of the top four
in the league in catches per game,
Scott Eschelman, Ed McCaffrey
and Jim Price.

"On offense they look like
they're coming along," Fassel
said. "I think they can be very
explosive."
The defense that Stanford will
face is one of the smallest in big
time college football. The four
down linemen average a mere 235
pounds and the six linebackers
listed on the depth chart average
210.
The Utes also have a short de
fensive backfield. "That 6-6 guy
(McCaffrey) can go up and catch
the ball," Fassel said. "He really
worries me, with our short defen
sive backs."
Utah also has short wide
receivers, but they worry Green
as much as McCaffrey worries
Fassel. "Their receivers are small
and a little bit quicker than Wash
ington State's," Green said.
"We're going to have to get some
pressure with our front four, our
three linemen and an outside
backer. We can't afford to have
to blitz all the time to get pres
sure."
