# Stanford prepares for Utah, quarterback question looms
## 
### Chris Crader Editorial staff 
Six-foot-6, 231 pounds.
Sounds about right for a col
lege linebacker, or maybe a tight
end.
Except when you're talking
about Utah football. For the
Utes, 6-6, 231 is about right for
a quarterback.
Junior southpaw Scott
Mitchell is that big, and he's
pretty good, too. He set 10
NCAA records last year, includ
ing passing for 631 yards in one
game, and led the nation in both
passing and total offense.
So far this season he's thrown
25 touchdowns (by way of com
parison, Stanford has scored a
total of only nine TDs this year)
and he is averaging 331.6 yards
per game through the air.
"Scott's an outstanding
player," Ute Coach Jim Fassel
said. "At least for what we do,
I don't see any guy playing col
lege football who's any better."
Mitchell will go against a
Stanford defense that gave up
347 yards passing just last week
in a 31-13 loss to Washington
State. "We're hoping it's not
going to be too high-scoring,"
Stanford Coach Denny Green
said. "Scott Mitchell is a big
time player with a big-time
arm."

Countering Mitchell for the
Cardinal will be Brian Johnson,
who earned the starting role
with his relief apparence against
the Cougars last week. "I think
Steve [Smith, last week's start
ing quarterbackl just didn't ex
ecute," Green explained. "I just
wasn't pleased with our execu
tion, our ability to move the
ball."
Johnson is listed as only ques
tionable due to a nagging shoul

der injury and a bruised knee
suffered Saturday, but he prac
ticed a little yesterday.
Johnson, or Smith if Johnson
can't go, will face a defense that
has held its opponenets below
38 points only once this year.
Despite having eight starters
back on defense, the Utes are
giving up more than 490 yards
of offense per game.

Freshman Steve Smith may start this Saturday in what promises to be an aerial battle unlike
any other in the country.
