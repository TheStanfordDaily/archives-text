# Football vs. Utah
## 
### 
TOMORROW - KZSU (90.1 FM). KCBS (740 AM). 1 p.m. kickoff.
RECORDS — Stanford (1-5, 1-2 in Pac-10 play), Utah (2-5, 1-3 in the
WAC).
INJURIES — Rob Hinckley, Jon Volpe. Jay Jay Lasley and John
Carpenter are out. Brian Johnson is questionable.
SERIES — The teams have met twice, with Stanford winning both
times. The Cardinal prevailed 35-11 in the 1902 Rose Bowl The
teams met again in 1924, with the game taking place in California's
Memorial Stadium The Cardinal was scheduled to play USC in Los
Angeles that weekend, but backed out due to an argument with
USC over eligibility rules. Stanford scrambled to find an opponent,
and Utah was ready and willing Unfortunately, Stanford Stadium was
hosting the Stanford-Cal freshmen teams, so Berkeley was the only
place to play. The Cardinal prevailed 30-0 in that game.
UTE UPDATE — Scott Mitchell, Utah's junior quarterback, has thrown
for over 2,000 yards and 25 touchdowns already this year. The Ute
defense, however, gives up 490 yards a game Utah's scores for the
year: 22-52, 45-10, 30-42, 20-67, 27-38. 50-45, 24-45.
CARDINAL UPDATE — The Cardinal running game is the same as it
has been the past couple of weeks as no one has returned from
injury. Thus the Cardinal will likely air it out. If the Stanford defense
can do a better job than it did last week against the pass, the
Cardinal should win.
