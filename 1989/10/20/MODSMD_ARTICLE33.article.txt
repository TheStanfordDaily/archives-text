# Cardinal soccer to oppose Duke, Virginia in tourney
## 
### Michael Clayton Staff writer 
While most students cautiously ventured
into shaken classrooms yesterday, the wom
en's soccer team left campus and boarded
a plane which would take them to the East
Coast. The 19th-ranked Cardinal will par
ticipate in this weekend's Virginia Invita
tional, along with Duke, Notre Dame and
host Virginia.
As the team left the earthquake region,
Coach Berhane Andeberhan felt good about
how the players had reacted to the disaster.
"I think we were very fortunate to be
outside when the earthquake happened,"
Andeberhan said. "A lot of the players on
the squad were disrupted by having to
move out of housing, but I really feel we
have rallied together as a team. Everyone
seems to be fine."
To have a successful weekend, the Car
dinal (9-3-1) will need to continue to rally
together. On Saturday at 10 a.m. (PDT),
Stanford will take on a young, talented
Duke (11-6) squad, and on Sunday at noon
(PDT) the Cardinal will play against the
No. 4 team in the nation, Virginia (14-3).
Andeberhan believes his team will need to
pull out at least a split against the aggres
sive Eastern teams.
"Duke will field a relatively new team,"
Andeberhan said. "Recently, a lot of money
has been put into the operations and into

scholarships for their women's soccer pro
gram."
The dividends of the money has begun
to pay off for the Blue Devil women. In
just its second year as a varsity sport, the
Duke women's team has impressed the na
tion's coaches enough to receive weekly
votes for the top-20, and the athletic de
partment hopes to make women's soccer a
full-scholarship sport as soon as possible.
Currently, the squad is made up prima
rily of recruited freshmen, with only three
starting sophomores on the team. Three
freshmen, Sarah Friend, Heidi Mauger and
Caitlin Connolly, lead the Blue Devils in
scoring, and, in its last three games, Duke

has outscored its opponents 17-2.
Of the six Duke losses, four have
been to top-10 teams, and the Blue
Devils rank as the only team to
score two goals against top-ranked
North Carolina.

"On paper, I think we must be
considered even with Duke," An
deberhan said. "Against Virginia,
we would probably be the under
dog."
With two wins this weekend,
the Cavaliers would coast into
postseason play. The Cardinal
hopes to shake up Virginia's se
cure position with a victory.
