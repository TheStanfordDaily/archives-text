# Utah Ute becomes Greek for upcoming week, lets 2-0 tie record lie
## 
### Buck Montana Senior staff writer 
With the Cardinal gridders re
turning home this weekend, it
seemed only natural to venture
afar to track down this week's
Guest Greek. After a long search,
the selectee this week is Ute Dirk
Facer, the sports editor of The
Daily Utah Chronicle.
Facer seemed well-prepared to
serve as the Greek as The Daily
Chronicle runs a similar feature
each week. Picking Utah, Utah
State, Brigham Young, Weber
State and all pro games, Facer
has compiled a 37-17 record this
season, placing him three games
ahead of his nearest challenger.
"This is an unbelievable thrill,"
he said. "I look forward to sharing
my football knowledge with the
good people of Stanford."
He bucked the pattern of his
fellow prognosticators by picking
his Utes, as expected, over the
host Cardinal. "I feel that every
one in that neck of the woods is
still shook up a little," he said.
"The WAC is back."
Facer contemplated picking a
tie in this weekend's Brown and
Cornell matchup, until he heard
the amazing success stories of this
year's Guest Greek tie-pickers.
In the first Greek weekend,
former sports editor Jon Weisman

picked a tie in the Pittsburgh-
West Virginia matchup, making
him the first prognosticate to
correctly pick a tie in Daily Greek
history — rumored to go back 97
years.
Only two weeks later — that's
last weekend for you and me —
editor in chief Tim Marklein tried
his hand at the Guest Greek, and
chanced his tie-selecting skills by
predicting Arizona State and
Oregon State would end their
game in a knot.
To the amazement of the entire
sports staff, Marklein became the
second correct tie-chooser in Daily
Greek history — remember, that's
97 years to you and me.
With Marklein's 6-4 record, the
Guest Greek remains in a second
place tie-
Sports editor Nat Cousins
pulled into second with last week
end's best picks — 8-2, including
a traitorous pick of Washington
State over Stanford. After an
abysmal 4-6 performance last
week, volleyball writer Dave Ear
nest let his girlfriend make his
picks.
Soudah should have no trouble
keeping Earnest's record above
lowly sports editor Greg Gottes
man and Cardinal Today editor
David Hirning, who have
struggled with mediocrity all
season.

last weekend for you and me —
editor in chief Tim Marklein tried
his hand at the Guest Greek, and
chanced his tie-selecting skills by
predicting Arizona State and
Oregon State would end their
game in a knot.
To the amazement of the entire
sports staff, Marklein became the
second correct tie-chooser in Daily
Greek history — remember, that's
97 years to you and me.
With Marklein's 6-4 record, the
Guest Greek remains in a second
place tie-
Sports editor Nat Cousins
pulled into second with last week
end's best picks — 8-2, including
a traitorous pick of Washington
State over Stanford. After an
abysmal 4-6 performance last
week, volleyball writer Dave Ear
nest let his girlfriend make his
picks.
Soudah should have no trouble
keeping Earnest's record above
lowly sports editor Greg Gottes
man and Cardinal Today editor
David Hirning, who have
struggled with mediocrity all
season.

With the Cardinal gridders re
turning home this weekend, it
seemed only natural to venture
afar to track down this week's
Guest Greek. After a long search,
the selectee this week is Ute Dirk
Facer, the sports editor of The
Daily Utah Chronicle.
Facer seemed well-prepared to
serve as the Greek as The Daily
Chronicle runs a similar feature
each week. Picking Utah, Utah
State, Brigham Young, Weber
State and all pro games, Facer
has compiled a 37-17 record this
season, placing him three games
ahead of his nearest challenger.
"This is an unbelievable thrill,"
he said. "I look forward to sharing
my football knowledge with the
good people of Stanford."
He bucked the pattern of his
fellow prognosticators by picking
his Utes, as expected, over the
host Cardinal. "I feel that every
one in that neck of the woods is
still shook up a little," he said.
"The WAC is back."
Facer contemplated picking a
tie in this weekend's Brown and
Cornell matchup, until he heard
the amazing success stories of this
year's Guest Greek tie-pickers.
In the first Greek weekend,
former sports editor Jon Weisman

picked a tie in the Pittsburgh-
West Virginia matchup, making
him the first prognosticate to
correctly pick a tie in Daily Greek
history — rumored to go back 97
years.
Only two weeks later — that's
last weekend for you and me —
editor in chief Tim Marklein tried
his hand at the Guest Greek, and
chanced his tie-selecting skills by
predicting Arizona State and
Oregon State would end their
game in a knot.
