# Soccer to battle Bears at home, looks to avenge 1-0 loss in 1988
## 
### Andrew Wilcox Staff writer 
A certain mystique seems to
surround athletic matchups be
tween Stanford and California,
and this weekend should be no
different as the Cardinal takes on
the Golden Bears in the men's
soccer version of Big Game Sun
day at Stanford's Maloney Field.
The game was scheduled for 2
p.m., but it will almost definitely
be moved to 11 a.m. to avoid a
conflict with the 49ers game.
The Cardinal squad, which
stands at 7-7-1 on the year after
last weekend's second-place
showing in the Stanford Pacific
West Classic, would appear to be
the favorite over the 5-8-1 Bears,
although records are often mean
ingless in this rivalry. Stanford
wm try to avenge last year's 1-0
loss at Berkeley's Memorial Field.
"Cal will definitely be up for

Men's Soccer vs. California

SUNDAY — 11 a.m. at Maloney
Field.
RECORDS - Stanford (7-7-1),
California (5-8-1).
INJURIES — Sophomore Bing
Kongmebhol suffered a twisted
ankle last week and will not play.

us. We can't slack off or it will
be a long day. In the past, the
team has had problems getting
ready against struggling teams,
but we'll be pumped up because
this is Big Game," midfielder
Todd Caven said.
Although the Bears have been
plagued by scoring deficiencies
this season, the Cardinal will have
to contain several California
players in order to win. Forward
Steve Sigafoose leads the Bears
in scoring with eight points de
spite missing time with various

injuries, and midfielder Peter
Woodring serves as the Bears field
general and most consistent per
former.
After giving No. 1 Virginia a
run for its money in an overtime
loss last weekend, Caven said the
Stanford squad knows it can play
with anyone in the country. "The
team is disappointed we lost to
Virginia, (but) the game boosted
our confidence," Caven said.
The Cardinal squad again will
rely heavily on contributions from
its freshmen. Five first-year
players started against Virginia.
The loss against the Cavaliers
appears to have eliminated the
Cardinal from NCAA playoff con
tention. Despite playing one of the
toughest schedules in the country
and taking the top two teams in
the country, Virginia and UCLA,
into overtime, Stanford's record
does not stand out in the tough
Western region.
