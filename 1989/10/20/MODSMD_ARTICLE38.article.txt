Flicks on, parties canceled
"Flicks will be happening" Sunday, said
Jay Goldin, coordinator of ASSU Sunday
Flicks.
Memorial Auditorium, originally closed for
earthquake damage, was reopened yesterday
afternoon, and a spokesperson from Events
and Services said the Flick — "Cousins" —
"should be a go."
Itzhak Perlman's violin concert, presented
by Lively Arts and scheduled for 3 p.m.
Sunday in Mem Aud, will also take place
as planned.
Since the San Francisco 49ers will be
playing at Stanford Stadium Sunday, concert
patrons are urged to enter campus through
Serra Street or Junipero Serra Boulevard
and park in the Serra Complex parking lot
on Serra Street or the Mem Aud parking lot.
However, in light of the crunch the earth
quake has placed on University security
staff, Assoc. Dean of Student Affairs Michael
Jackson has asked that all campuswide par
ties be postponed until the earthquake sit
uation is under control.
These restrictions mean that the Theta
Delt party, the Sigma Nu Safari party and
the Amnesty International benefit party, all
scheduled for Saturday, will be canceled.
Jackson said this is "not a party ban —
we just want cooperation," adding that they
are making no attempt to eliminate "small,
private functions."

Athletes: no special treatment
University officials denied rumors circu
lating yesterday that displaced varsity foot
ball and women's tennis players are being
put up in off-campus hotel rooms by the
University.
Asked if this was occurring, Athletic Di
rector Andy Geiger said, "Not that I know
of — that would be a surprise."
Bill Georges, assistant director of the
Housing Center, said his office had no knowl
edge of any extra accommodations either.

When their house was closed, residents of
Delta Tau Delta, many of whom are football
players, were temporarily assigned to the
Theta Delta Chi House.
But junior Chris Kitching, a Theta Delt
resident, said that "none of the Delts
(residents of Delta Tau Delta) actually spent
the night here last night."
And a sign on the football players' locker
room door in Encina Gym told football
players who lacked housing to contact the
football office.
Geiger said, "A few members of a frat,
mostly football players, did check into a
hotel," but he said the students paid for the
rooms themselves.
The rooms are "not at the athletic de
partment's expense — that would be illegal,"
Geiger said, adding that such housing would
not be considered part of the athletes' schol
arship packages.
He added, however, that on the night
before games, about 60 members of the foot
ball team always stay off-campus at Athletic
Department expense.
Women's tennis Coach Frank Brennan said
he knew of only one diplaced tennis player,
who was staying with relatives in the area.
Roble Field serves as heliport
Those helicopters you may have seen over
head were ferrying patients from around
the Bay Area to Stanford Medical Center.
Lifeflight has played a major role in as
sisting earthquake victims, ferrying 10
earthquake-related victims to the Med
Center and other hospitals.
About half of the victims were flown to
Stanford because the hospitals in other areas
were starting to fill up. At least two victims
came from the Watsonville area, one from
Monterey and one newborn from Salinas.
On Wednesday, Lifeflight had to land on
Roble Field because the elevator leading to
the heliport at the Med Center was unreli
able. By Thursday it was back in operation.

Better late than never ...
The October issue of In Touch, a Stanford
staff newsletter, advertises a commercial
earthquake survival kit available from the
Stanford Special Services Unit.
The kit, which contains such items as
non-perishable food and water packets, first
aid supplies, and light sticks, is designed to
sustain an individual for a period of three
days. Although the ad appeared well before
the onset of the "great shakin'," it attracted
little attention prior to Tuesday's quake.
Since the quake, however, it has been a
different story.
An employee at the EE Stores in the
Electronics Research Lab Building, which is
distributing the kits, reported that as soon
as the structure was deemed safe for access,
the stores received calls for "probably 10
kits in three hours" before officials ordered
a second evacuation for a reinspection of
the building.
The kits can still be obtained by phoning
the EE Stores at 723-9680. They cost
$23.65, and may be purchased by depart
ments from Central Stores at $19.91 each.

Directory: held up by quake?
The Stanford Student Directory, sched
uled for distribution Nov. 13, may be delayed
as a result of the earthquake.
Directory editor John Keller said the
staffs concern is for the 500 dislocated stu
dents whose residences and phone numbers
may be changed.
"We could get it out immediately with
500 wrong numbers, or we can wait to get
accurate information," he said.
Morris Sim, project director, said the
speed of printing will depend on how quickly
students report their change of address to
the University.
Sim said, "We're still trying to aim for
the Nov. 13 deadline, but we want as much
accuracy as possible."

Flicks on, parties canceled
"Flicks will be happening" Sunday, said
Jay Goldin, coordinator of ASSU Sunday
Flicks.
Memorial Auditorium, originally closed for
earthquake damage, was reopened yesterday
afternoon, and a spokesperson from Events
and Services said the Flick — "Cousins" —
"should be a go."
Itzhak Perlman's violin concert, presented
by Lively Arts and scheduled for 3 p.m.
Sunday in Mem Aud, will also take place
as planned.
Since the San Francisco 49ers will be
playing at Stanford Stadium Sunday, concert
patrons are urged to enter campus through
Serra Street or Junipero Serra Boulevard
and park in the Serra Complex parking lot
on Serra Street or the Mem Aud parking lot.
However, in light of the crunch the earth
quake has placed on University security
staff, Assoc. Dean of Student Affairs Michael
Jackson has asked that all campuswide par
ties be postponed until the earthquake sit
uation is under control.
These restrictions mean that the Theta
Delt party, the Sigma Nu Safari party and
the Amnesty International benefit party, all
scheduled for Saturday, will be canceled.
Jackson said this is "not a party ban —
we just want cooperation," adding that they
are making no attempt to eliminate "small,
private functions."

Athletes: no special treatment
University officials denied rumors circu
lating yesterday that displaced varsity foot
ball and women's tennis players are being
put up in off-campus hotel rooms by the
University.
Asked if this was occurring, Athletic Di
rector Andy Geiger said, "Not that I know
of — that would be a surprise."
Bill Georges, assistant director of the
Housing Center, said his office had no knowl
edge of any extra accommodations either.

When their house was closed, residents of
Delta Tau Delta, many of whom are football
players, were temporarily assigned to the
Theta Delta Chi House.
But junior Chris Kitching, a Theta Delt
resident, said that "none of the Delts
(residents of Delta Tau Delta) actually spent
the night here last night."
And a sign on the football players' locker
room door in Encina Gym told football
players who lacked housing to contact the
football office.
Geiger said, "A few members of a frat,
mostly football players, did check into a
hotel," but he said the students paid for the
rooms themselves.
The rooms are "not at the athletic de
partment's expense — that would be illegal,"
Geiger said, adding that such housing would
not be considered part of the athletes' schol
arship packages.
He added, however, that on the night
before games, about 60 members of the foot
ball team always stay off-campus at Athletic
Department expense.
Women's tennis Coach Frank Brennan said
he knew of only one diplaced tennis player,
who was staying with relatives in the area.
Roble Field serves as heliport
Those helicopters you may have seen over
head were ferrying patients from around
the Bay Area to Stanford Medical Center.
Lifeflight has played a major role in as
sisting earthquake victims, ferrying 10
earthquake-related victims to the Med
Center and other hospitals.
About half of the victims were flown to
Stanford because the hospitals in other areas
were starting to fill up. At least two victims
came from the Watsonville area, one from
Monterey and one newborn from Salinas.
On Wednesday, Lifeflight had to land on
Roble Field because the elevator leading to
the heliport at the Med Center was unreli
able. By Thursday it was back in operation.

Better late than never ...
The October issue of In Touch, a Stanford
staff newsletter, advertises a commercial
earthquake survival kit available from the
Stanford Special Services Unit.
The kit, which contains such items as
non-perishable food and water packets, first
aid supplies, and light sticks, is designed to
sustain an individual for a period of three
days. Although the ad appeared well before
the onset of the "great shakin'," it attracted
little attention prior to Tuesday's quake.
Since the quake, however, it has been a
different story.
An employee at the EE Stores in the
Electronics Research Lab Building, which is
distributing the kits, reported that as soon
as the structure was deemed safe for access,
the stores received calls for "probably 10
kits in three hours" before officials ordered
a second evacuation for a reinspection of
the building.
The kits can still be obtained by phoning
the EE Stores at 723-9680. They cost
$23.65, and may be purchased by depart
ments from Central Stores at $19.91 each.

Directory: held up by quake?
The Stanford Student Directory, sched
uled for distribution Nov. 13, may be delayed
as a result of the earthquake.
Directory editor John Keller said the
staffs concern is for the 500 dislocated stu
dents whose residences and phone numbers
may be changed.
"We could get it out immediately with
500 wrong numbers, or we can wait to get
accurate information," he said.
Morris Sim, project director, said the
speed of printing will depend on how quickly
students report their change of address to
the University.
Sim said, "We're still trying to aim for
the Nov. 13 deadline, but we want as much
accuracy as possible."
