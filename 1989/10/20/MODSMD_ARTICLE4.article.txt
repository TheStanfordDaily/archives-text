# National student effort to aid Jackson
## Dozens across country plan to call district attorney, write Kennedy 
### John Wagner Editorial staff 
In an effort to show nationwide stu
dent support for junior Louis Jackson,
dozens of students across the country
plan to dial the Santa Clara County
district attorney Oct. 31, the day before
Jackson's next court hearing.
Jackson faces six misdemeanor
charges — including battery and incit
ing to riot — in connection with the
May 15 takeover of University President
Donald Kennedy's office. Supporters of
Jackson feel he has been unfairly singled
out for his participation in the takeover.
The board of directors of the United
States Student Association last week
unanimously passed a resolution sup
porting Jackson and agreeing to partic
ipate in a nationwide call-in to the dis
trict attorney on Jackson's behalf.
Based in New York, USSA is a na
tional student lobbying organization
which draws representives from student
governments and student organizations
at campuses across the country. Two
Stanford students, former Council of
Presidents member Stacey Leyton and
current COP member Aimee Allison, are
members of USSA's 51-person board of
directors.
At the recent board meeting, Leyton

'Students ought to be
able to protest without
the fear of being
prosecuted.'

brought Jackson's case up in her report
to the directors. She then yielded the
floor to Allison, who relayed the
specifics of Jackson's case to the board.
According to USSA Vice President
Julius Davis, board members were
jarred by Allison's account. "People were
amazed this is happening (to Jackson),"
he said. "Students ought to be able to
protest without the fear of being
prosecuted. They have a right to speak
their mind and be treated fairly."
According to Allison, 35 of the board
members are writing letters voicing con
cern about Jackson's treatment to Uni
versity President Donald Kennedy. The
letters should be arriving today or early
next week, Allison said.
Leyton said she hopes the letters,
many of which are being written by
student body presidents and chairs of
student of color organizations, will make

an impression on Kennedy. Hopefully,
she said, the letters will let Kennedy
know that "people around the country
are watching this case and see it as a
case of racial discrimination" against
Jackson, who is black.
The University's lack of intervention
is hurting its image at other schools
across the country, Allison said.
Board members were also asked to
call and to encourage others at their
school to call the district attorney the
day before Jackson returns to court.
Callers will voice their disapproval of
the battery charge Jackson is facing,
Allison said.
The victim in the alleged battery has
signed a civil compromise agreement,
saying she has no complaint against
Jackson. However, the district attorney
last week opposed a motion to drop the
battery charge, arguing that the battery
took place during a riot and therefore
cannot be resolved by a civil compromise
agreement.
Leyton said she hopes the call-in will
"put a little more pressure" on the dis
trict attorney to drop the charge.
Davis said he hopes each of USSA's
51 board members will recruit between
20 and 30 people to make calls.
