# National student effort to aid Jackson
## Dozens across country plan to call district attorney, write Kennedy 
### John Wagner Editorial staff 
In an effort to show nationwide stu
dent support for junior Louis Jackson,
dozens of students across the country
plan to dial the Santa Clara County
district attorney Oct. 31, the day before
Jackson's next court hearing.
Jackson faces six misdemeanor
charges — including battery and incit
ing to riot — in connection with the
May 15 takeover of University President
Donald Kennedy's office. Supporters of
Jackson feel he has been unfairly singled
out for his participation in the takeover.
The board of directors of the United
States Student Association last week
unanimously passed a resolution sup
porting Jackson and agreeing to partic
ipate in a nationwide call-in to the dis
trict attorney on Jackson's behalf.
Based in New York, USSA is a na
tional student lobbying organization
which draws representives from student
governments and student organizations
at campuses across the country. Two
Stanford students, former Council of
Presidents member Stacey Leyton and
current COP member Aimee Allison, are
members of USSA's 51-person board of
directors.
At the recent board meeting, Leyton

able to protest without
the fear of being
prosecuted.'

brought Jackson's case up in her report
to the directors. She then yielded the
floor to Allison, who relayed the
specifics of Jackson's case to the board.
According to USSA Vice President
Julius Davis, board members were
jarred by Allison's account. "People were
amazed this is happening (to Jackson),"
he said. "Students ought to be able to
protest without the fear of being
prosecuted. They have a right to speak
their mind and be treated fairly."
According to Allison, 35 of the board
members are writing letters voicing con
cern about Jackson's treatment to Uni
versity President Donald Kennedy. The
letters should be arriving today or early
next week, Allison said.
Leyton said she hopes the letters,
many of which are being written by
student body presidents and chairs of
student of color organizations, will make

an impression on Kennedy. Hopefully,
she said, the letters will let Kennedy
know that "people around the country
are watching this case and see it as a
case of racial discrimination" against
Jackson, who is black.
The University's lack of intervention
is hurting its image at other schools
across the country, Allison said.
Board members were also asked to
call and to encourage others at their
school to call the district attorney the
day before Jackson returns to court.
Callers will voice their disapproval of
the battery charge Jackson is facing,
Allison said.
The victim in the alleged battery has
signed a civil compromise agreement,
saying she has no complaint against
Jackson. However, the district attorney
last week opposed a motion to drop the
battery charge, arguing that the battery
took place during a riot and therefore
cannot be resolved by a civil compromise
agreement.
Leyton said she hopes the call-in will
"put a little more pressure" on the dis
trict attorney to drop the charge.
Davis said he hopes each of USSA's
51 board members will recruit between
20 and 30 people to make calls.
He said the call-in should "tie
up the DA's line."
Allsion was slightly more con
servative in her estimate of par
ticpation, indicating that she
thought between 60 and 70 stu
dents would be making calls.
The calls are intended to make
sure "the DA knows Lou has sup
port from different sectors of the
country," Allison said.
She said she is convinced that
Jackson was singled out because
authorities felt he would not be
supported by Stanford or the com
munity. She said she hopes the
call-in will prove that Jackson has
a great dead of support from stu
dents across the country.
The involvement of USSA in
Jackson's case should "mean a
lot," Allison said. "It's the

For the record

An article and editorial in The
Daily last week implied that the

No salary increases will result;

ization in the country," she said.
Allison, however, is only
cautiously optimistic about the ef
fect the calls will have on the
district attorney. "There's only so
much we can do, really," she said.
At the board of directors meet
ing, Jackson's case was discussed
in the context of harassment of
students of color on college cam
puses across the country, Allison
said. Board members from New
York told of the arrests of seven
black students at SUNY-New
Paltz who, after playing their
radio loudly in their school
cafeteria, were charged with
resisting arrest, disturbing the
peace and obstruction of justice,
she said. Several other incidents
were discussed as well, she said.
Board members said they hope
the letter-writing and call-in cam
paigns for Jackson will demon

strate that students all over the
country are opposed to discrimi
natory treatment of students of
color.
The board also decided to es
tablish a legal defense fund for
Jackson and students facing
similar situations across the coun
try. While it is unlikely that the
defense fund will provide substan
tial monetary support, Davis said
he hopes its creation will "send a
symbolic message."
Students from around the coun
try will also be calling reporters
at Bay Area newspapers to let
them know how students feel
about the case, Davis said.
