# Where will the money come from?
## 
### Michael Friedly Staff writer 
The University, facing "tens of
millions of dollars" in damages
from Tuesday's earthquake, has
not yet established exactly where
the funds will come from to pay
for repairs.
Until a full assessment of the
extent of the damages is com
pleted, the University cannot
begin to decide how to raise the
money, according to Acting Vice
President for Public Affairs Larry
Horton.
Stanford has been self-insured
for earthquake damage since
1985, according to Robert Beth,
director of risk management.
Beginning in 1985, the Univer
sity began setting aside an earth
quake reserve. As of Aug. 31, the
University had $3.4 million in the

earthquake reserve, as well as
$3.6 million in a property reserve
to cover events like fires or floods.
The full cost of the cleanup ef
fort has not yet been determined,
but University President Donald
Kennedy put the estimate "in the
many, many tens of millions of
dollars" in a speech broadcast
Wednesday on KZSU.
University Provost James
Rosse said the repairs would be
financed by "University income
and resources." He said specifi
cally that a primary source of the
funds would be from borrowing
from various lenders. "We would
rather borrow the money than use
the endowment," he said.
But Rosse said a portion of the
endowment would have to be used,
possibly including funds raised in
the Centennial Campaign. He ex
plained that the University is con

tinually borrowing money to fund
various construction projects on
campus.
The University will also have
to "forgo some of the things that
we would have done" with the
money in the absence of the earth
quake, Rosse said. He would not
speculate on which projects will
suffer cutbacks.
Rosse does not expect that the
students will have to bear the
costs of the cleanup effort. "It is
not likely that we would increase
tuition any faster than our com
petitors," he said, but he admitted
that "tuition is one of the sources
of income" that the University
may use to repair the damages.
Beth said Stanford will seek
federal or state disaster aid if it
is available.
According to Beth, the Univer

sity had earthquake insurance
from 1980 to 1985, when the
policy was cancelled and Stanford
became self-insured.
In 1986, insurance companies
offered Stanford an insurance
policy that would have cost $3 to
$5 million a year. The policy
would have had a $100 million
deductible and would cover an ad
ditional $125 million in damage
above the deductible, according to
Beth.
However, Beth said the Univer
sity decided the policy would not
be economically feasible. Analysts
estimated that an earthquake of
the magnitude of the 1906 quake
would result in a $200 million
loss. That would mean the Uni
versity would have to suffer a
"1906 quake" every 20 years to
make purchasing the insurance
worthwhile.
