# 80 percent of buildings deemed safe, stable

. . and the walls came tumbling down."
Well, that's at least what happened to
Jericho by the time Joshua circled it for the
seventh time.
But when the trumpets blew here on the
Farm, most of the walls stayed up, according
to Prof. Haresh Shah, chair of the Civil En
gineering Department.
"A very large majority (of the buildings)
are fine," said Shah. He estimated that about
80 percent of the buildings on campus are
safe to enter.
Shah worked with University Operations
and Maintenance in creating and briefing 25
teams of inspectors that searched campus
Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday for struc
tural damage.
He was designated by Provost James Rosse
as an official University inspector and re
ported his findings directly to Rosse and Uni
versity President Donald Kennedy.
Although many buildings have been deemed
safe, Shah cautioned that a complete struc
tural accounting of all campus buildings "will
take many months."
"Even for the buildings which are currently
green, we will have to do a decent inspection,"

said Shah.
Inspection teams classified the buildings as
either green, orange or red. The color indicates
whether the building is safe to enter, limited
to authorized persons, or closed.
Civil engineering graduate student John
Luce, who participated in the inspection, said
the teams were "conservative in [their] judg
ment."
"There were a number of buildings that we
determined unsafe" that were later found to
be sound, he said.
Bruce Wiggins, associate director of opera
tions and maintenance, concurred. "If there's
any question, it's classed as 'not going in.' "
Wiggins added that student dorms were in
spected first. "The number-one priority is stu
dent housing," he said.
Shah said the teams checked buildings in
a two-step process. They first determined
"what the load-carrying members were," he
said. Load-carrying members are the basic
structural components supporting a building.
The investigators subsequently examined
"the distress to these . . . members," said
Shah. He added that the inspection teams
judged from their knowledge of distress types
whether the building was safe.
Shah emphasized that "cosmetic" damage
was ignored in the inspection process. "If

there are hairline cracks, we don't care much
about it,"he said.
Luce said he was satisfied that the inspec
tions were thorough, and that students need
not worry. "Personally I'm very comfortable"
with the inspections, he said.
Shah, too, felt satisfied that buildings are
thoroughly checked, but only for the time
being.
He added that complete inspections will re
quire that engineers study building plans and
perhaps even construct computer simulations
of the earthquake to determine the full extent
of the distress to a building.
Some students at Lathrop House, however,
are disconcerted about what they perceive to
be structural damages to their residence, even
though they were allowed to move back in.
"I certainly don't want to go back after
watching the dorm over the past 24 hours,"
said Lathrop resident Juliette Tanner, a soph
omore.
Junior Susanne Seagrave agreed. "I get a
dizzy feeling walking around the room because
the floor is uneven," she said. She added she
feels uncomfortable sleeping there.
