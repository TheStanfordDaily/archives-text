### Sherromba Barbee 
The residents of American
Studies House received a small,
smoky scare Wednesday afternoon
when overheated lint caused an
electrical overload in one of the
house's dryers.
Responding to the house's fire
alarm, the Palo Alto Fire Depart
ment simply cleaned the lint out
of the dryer and it was back in
business.
Although it was a minor
laundry room incident, residents
were still unsettled after Tues
day's quake and had a lively re
action to the smoky scene.
"Everyone just kind of freaked
because there was a lot of smoke,"

Resident Assistant John Tippett,
a senior, said.
"I don't think [the fire] had
anything to do with the earth
quake," he added.
A spokesman from the depart
ment said the outage was "very
minor."
Around 11:30 a.m., some resi
dents smelled smoke and began
searching for the source. Resident
Merrill Langfitt, a sophomore,
said she was going downstairs
with a basket of laundry when
she smelled the smoke.
It smelled like an electrical fire,
she said, and guessed that the
smoke was coming from the
laundry room. But Langfitt added
that there was confusion as to

where the smoke was actually
coming from.
At first, Tippett said he thought
the smoke was coming from the
apartment of the resident fellows,
who are out of town.
According to resident Stephanie
Nunez, Tippett pulled the fire
alarm and everyone waited out
side for about 20 minutes until
the firefighters arrived at the
scene.
Nunoz said most people weren't
very worried.
The smoke lingered on for about
half an hour, but "there was never
an actual fire," said Tippett.
According to Tippett, the
clothes in the dryer at the time
were not damaged.
