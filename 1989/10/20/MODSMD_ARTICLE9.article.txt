NCAA calls for more drug testing
At what point does the preservation of dignity
in sport override the individual rights of the
athlete?
That is a question that is sure to resurface in
response to the National Collegiate Athletic As
sociation's latest call for random, year-round drug
testing of athletes. The NCAA's 46-member coun
cil's endorsement of random testing leads the
way for proposed legislation to be decided on at
their annual convention, to be held Jan. 7-10.
Presently, drug testing by the NCAA occurs
only before championship events and post-season
bowl games, though many institutions test inde
pendently at various stages of the playing season.
The year-round testing mandate would likely
provoke criticism from administrators due to the
skyrocketing cost factor of enacting such a pro
gram, the NCAA's board acknowledged.
The proposal is certain to draw legal challenges
as well. Former Stanford athletes Barry
McKeever and Jennifer Hill last summer fought
and won an individual battle against required
testing, yet the likelihood of a more universal
victory is uncertain.
The Stanford Athletic Department has not yet
taken a position on the NCAA's most recent de
mands. Associate Athletic Director Thomas Beck
ett said a formal stance will be announced next
week.

Palo Alto alums give scholarship
The Stanford Alumni Club of Palo Alto an
nounced it will be donating three $2,500 schol

arships in the memory of Karl Thursby.
Thursby, a Business School graduate, served
on the Stanford Alumni Club board for 16 years.
The scholarships will be given to Stanford stu
dents from the Palo Alto area who qualify for
financial aid and will become part of their package
for the current academic year.
Annually, the Alumni Club donates scholarship
money to the Financial Aids Office to be distrib
uted on the basis of need. This year, however,
is the first time the money has been given in
memoriam.
The three recipients of the scholarships have
yet to be chosen by Financial Aids. They will be
notified by mail of their awards sometime during
fall quarter.
