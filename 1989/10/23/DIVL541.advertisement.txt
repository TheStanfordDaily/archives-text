TUESDAY, OCTOBER 24, 8 PM.
I ucked high in the Canadian Rockies is a quarry called the
Burgess Shale. Less than a city block long, the Burgess Shale
is 530 million years old — the remains of an ancient sea. Gould's
story of the Burgess Shale and how it fits into the scheme of
evolution is one of the greatest stories — and hottest controver
sies — in science today.
Gould, who teaches paleontology and evolutionary biology at
Harvard, is the author of nine previous books, including Ever
Since Darwin and The Panda's Thumb.
