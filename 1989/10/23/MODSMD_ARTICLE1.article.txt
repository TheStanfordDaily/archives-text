# Quake damage estimate placed at $160 million

After a preliminary assessment of damages fol
lowing last Tuesday's earthquake, University Pres
ident Donald Kennedy announced Friday that there
will be more than $160 million in repairs and re
placement of University buildings.
This figure includes only "buildings and struc
tures, not equipment and furnishings — which also
sustained significant damage," according to Ken
nedy's statement. Damages to the Stanford Linear
Accelerator Center and the Veterans' Administration
Hospital are also not included in the estimate.
Where the funds will come from to pay for the
damages has yet to be determined, according to
University Budget Director Timothy Warner. "That
will be decided in the next couple of weeks," he said.
Most of the funds will have to come from sources
outside the University operating budget, which is
currently about $380 million, not large enough to
sustain a $160 million repair bill, Warner said.
The income for this budget is a relatively fixed
amount, he said, and cannot be adjusted to account
for the earthquake.
The operating budget is the result of four main
sources of income. "Tuition accounts for about 50
percent of the budget," while indirect costs from
research billed to the government make up another
third, according to Warner. Income from endowment
investments and gifts account for the remainder.
Student tuition, as the most important portion
of the operating budget, is not expected to increase
substantially, said University Provost James Rosse.
"We are charging as much as we can reasonably
charge at this point," he said.
The primary source for the funding of the repairs
will be loans from outside lenders, according to
Rosse. This will be done through the distribution
of AAA-rated bonds from the University.
The AAA rating is given by the
federal government to indicate the
safest level of investment on
bonds, in contrast to so-called
"junk bonds," which are at the
lowest level of security, Rosse
said. Stanford is the only univer
sity in the country to have such
a high rating, he said.
These bonds would eventually
have to be paid back through the
operating budget, which will make
the University budget deficit even
greater, according to Rosse.
Instead of taking endowment
funds from the stock market, the
University traditionally has used
loans to pay for various projects,
including the construction of

at a lower rate of interest than
withdraw endowment funds from
the stock market, although a por
tion of the endowment will be
used. The amount of money the
endowment generates in the stock
market makes it too valuable to
be used to completely fund the
damage repairs, Rosse said.
Rosse said last Thursday that
the funds would also be raised
from the cancellation of planned
University projects, although he
could not specify which projects
would be affected. He said funds
earmarked for a new undergrad
uate dormitory to be built on the
site of Manzanita Park will prob

ably not be used.
The University has not had out
side insurance since 1985, when
its policy was canceled. Since then
it has been self-insured, which it
found to be more reasonable fi
nancially.
"Insurance of a university is a
very different proposition than
that of a private business," due
to "a couple billion dollars in re
placement costs" for university
buildings, Rosse said. Since 1985,
the University has accumulated
$7 million in contingency funds
for earthquakes and other natural
disasters, far short of the $160
million necessary for the cleanup.
Emergency funds will also be
sought from the federal and state
governments, according to Ken
nedy's statement. The University,
however, is not expecting to
receive relief aid, said Rosse. "We
are going to have to rely on our
own resources to accomplish what
we have to accomplish," he said.
