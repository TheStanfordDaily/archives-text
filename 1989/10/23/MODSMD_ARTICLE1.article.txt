After a preliminary assessment of damages fol
lowing last Tuesday's earthquake, University Pres
ident Donald Kennedy announced Friday that there
will be more than $160 million in repairs and re
placement of University buildings.
This figure includes only "buildings and struc
tures, not equipment and furnishings â€” which also
sustained significant damage," according to Ken
nedy's statement. Damages to the Stanford Linear
Accelerator Center and the Veterans' Administration
Hospital are also not included in the estimate.
Where the funds will come from to pay for the
damages has yet to be determined, according to
University Budget Director Timothy Warner. "That
will be decided in the next couple of weeks," he said.
Most of the funds will have to come from sources
outside the University operating budget, which is
currently about $380 million, not large enough to
sustain a $160 million repair bill, Warner said.
The income for this budget is a relatively fixed
amount, he said, and cannot be adjusted to account
for the earthquake.
The operating budget is the result of four main
sources of income. "Tuition accounts for about 50
percent of the budget," while indirect costs from
research billed to the government make up another
third, according to Warner. Income from endowment
investments and gifts account for the remainder.
Student tuition, as the most important portion
of the operating budget, is not expected to increase
substantially, said University Provost James Rosse.
"We are charging as much as we can reasonably
charge at this point," he said.
The primary source for the funding of the repairs
will be loans from outside lenders, according to
Rosse. This will be done through the distribution
of AAA-rated bonds from the University.
