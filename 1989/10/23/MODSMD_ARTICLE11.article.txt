TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) - A
Boeing 727 shook violently and seemed
to plunge just before it crashed in flames
into a hillside, killing 131 people, a badly
burned survivor said yesterday.
"They told us to put on our seatbelts
for landing, and then suddenly the plane
began to shake, like air turbulence," said
Evenor Lopez, a Honduran businessman.
"But it went on for a long time, and
we seemed to be descending too rapidly.

Some people were screaming," Lopez said
in an interview.
Investigators from the National Air
Transportation Safety Board arrived yes
terday from the United States aboard a
Coast Guard plane and went directly to
the site of Saturday's crash.
The plane was operated by the Hon
duran airline TAN-SAHSA.
Authorities said 131 of the 146 people
aboard were killed. U.S. Embassy spokes

man Terry Kneebone said there were 15
Americans aboard. Airline officials said
three of the 15 survivors were American.
The plane's "black box" recorder was
flown to Washington for analysis, said
Barry Trotter, leader of the Safety Board
team.
TAN-SAHSA Flight 414 crashed Sat
urday morning on a hill 20 miles south
of Tegucigalpa while on a flight from San
Jose, Costa Rica, with a stop in Managua,

Nicaragua.
It was the worst air crash in Central
American history. Among the dead were
the Honduran Minister of Labor, Ar
mando Blanco Paniagua; and Mario
Rodriguez Cubero, an aide to Costa Rican
president Oscar Arias.
Pilot Raul Argueta was one of the sur
vivors. Doctors said all were in stable
condition.
Hundreds of people gathered at

Tegucigalpa's morgue Sunday as doctors
continued the slow task of identifying
charred bodies. Among them were rela
tives of Nicaraguan and Costa Rican pas
sengers who rushed to Tegucigalpa after
receiving word of the crash.
The cause of the crash was still not
clear.
Speculation centered on the plane's age,
more than 20 years, and on bad weather
at Tegucigalpa's Toncontin airport.
