seven people in Tel Aviv, and the case has
prompted officials to review the policy that lets
workers from the occupied lands stay overnight
in the city.
Police said the murders apparently stemmed
from financial disputes between the suspect and
his victims over drugs and prostitution, but they
would not rule out a political motive.
Army radio quoted police officials as saying
the suspect was known as a criminal and was
given an overnight permit because he served as
an informant for Israel's security forces. Tel Aviv
police declined comment.
