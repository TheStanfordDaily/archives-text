# Veto blocks pro-choice legislation
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Abor
tion rights advocates conceded
yesterday they have little chance
of overriding President Bush's
veto of a bill allowing Medicaid
to pay for abortions for victims
of rape or incest.
But pro-choice lawmakers and
lobbyists said they still will put
up a fight to override Bush's veto
on the $157 billion Labor-Health
and Human Services appropria
tions bill.
"The outlook for an override is
not good," said Marcy Wilder, a
staff attorney for the National
Abortion Rights Action League, a
main pro-choice lobbying group.
While the Senate approved the
spending bill, including relaxation
of the Medicaid abortion restric
tions, last Thursday by a 67-31
vote, the House vote a week ear
lier was 216-206, far short of the
two-thirds that would be needed

to override the veto.
Bush is also threatening to veto
two other pending pieces of leg
islation over abortion-related is
sues: a District of Columbia ap
propriations bill allowing
Medicaid to pay for all abortions
for poor women in the nation's
capital, and a foreign operations
bill that would lift restrictions on
funding United Nations' family
planning programs.
Sen. Bob Packwood, R-Ore., a
longtime leader of pro-choice
forces in Congress, acknowledged
the prospects for an override in
the House now are slim, but he
suggested that Congress keep
passing the same appropriations
bill.
If Republicans lose next
month's gubernatorial races to
pro-choice Democrats in Virginia
and New Jersey, Packwood pre
dicted, "you may see a chance in

the House" to override a Bush
abortion veto the second or third
time around.
Packwood, interviewed on Cable
News Network's "Evans &
Novak" show, said Republican
lawmakers are shifting under
pressure from constituents
toward a more pro-choice stance.
Bush vetoed the measure Sat
urday at Camp David, the presi
dential retreat in Maryland where
he spent the weekend after re
turning from Friday's tour of
earthquake damage in northern
California.
Bush said he was unwilling to
permit federal funding of abor
tions "other than those in which
the life of the mother would be
endangered if the fetus were
carried to term." That is how the
Medicaid law has stood since
1981, he noted.
