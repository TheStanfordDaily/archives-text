## A 						voice for choice 
### 
Student activism helps
pro-choicers gain goals,
edge on pro-lifers

THE TIDE is changing.
A new Gallup poll shows
that pro-choice advocates
now display feelings that are as
strong as pro-life advocates. In Il
linois, proposed restrictions on
abortion have been rejected by a
state legislative committee.
In San Francisco, 60,000 dem
onstrators marched on Market
Street to defend a woman's right
to have an abortion. IVTore than
150 Stanford students joined the
march.
Recently, for the first time ever,
both the U.S. House and the U.S.
Senate passed a bill recently to ex
pand Medicaid benefits to pay for
abortions in the case of rape and
incest.
Still, there is one obstacle pro
choice activists have been unable
to overcome: President George
Bush. Saturday, Bush vetoed the
bill because he "prefers to err on
the side of human life."
Instead of denying women the
right to have an abortion, Bush's
veto denies poor women their right
to have a safe abortion without
resorting to unsafe "backstreet"
methods to abort the fetus.
The ramifications of the veto will
be felt by students across the coun
try, including those on the Stan
ford campus.
In a 1986-87 random survey con
ducted by the Cowell Student
Health Center, 8 percent of female
students reported pregnancies. All
the undergraduates and 72 percent
of the graduate students in the
group terminated their preg
nancies.
Many students have to work long

hours to pay for their tuition with
out having to somehow scrounge
more money for proper health care.
While many students will be af
fected, it is surrounding commu
nities like East Palo Alto which
will be hardest hit. In places where
it is already hardest for people to
afford sufficient medical care, this
decision will retain the problems
that these women already face.
Bush has compounded the prob
lem by not offering poor women
incentives not to have an abortion.
His statement indicating that he
would veto the Medicaid bill did
not include suggestions for alter
natives such as prenatal care and
improved child care. Instead, the
deficiencies in these programs
decrease the willingness of women
to go through with the pregnancy.
Bush has also ignored the
trauma that many of these women
have gone through. Rape and in
cest, and the psychological damages
that are often associated with
them, play heavily into many wom
en's decisions to have abortions.
Bush has commented that it
would be difficult to limit abor
tions "to the few cases of rape or
incest." This not only trivializes
the agony that victims of rape and
incest go through but it also
presupposes that poor women
would purposefully defraud the
federal government in order to
receive an abortion.
There are other battles to come.
This term, the Supreme Court will
hear three important cases ques
tioning a woman's right to choose.
Battles within state legislatures,
like the ones recently in Illinois
and Florida, will continue to be
decided by politicians who pay close
attention to how their vote on this
issue will affect their careers.
As the fights continue, students
must continue to be an active voice.
That way the tide can continue to
change.
