## Reflecting after the quake 
### 
AS A NATIVE Californian, I am
used to earthquakes. Up until
Tuesday at 5:04 p.m., I had re
garded them as quite ordinary, every
now-and-then occurrences to be taken
lightly.
For 10 to 15 seconds, the earth would
move around a little bit like a roller
coaster, and after the fun, my friends
would laugh and exchange stories about
where we were "when it happened."
I still smile when I remember that
during an earthquake several summers
ago, my best friend was in the restroom
clinging to the porcelain for dear life.
For a short period after the quake last
week, my initial reaction was the same
as it has always been. I played the role
of a resident assistant, comforting people,
joking around and answering their ques
tion: "Is this the big one?"
It was not until I had listened to news
reports that I realized the serious impact
that the earthquake had made in the
Bay Area.
Only when I discovered that the
epicenter was in Hollister — ten miles
east of where a lot of my family lives —
and that both Santa Cruz and Oakland
— where a good number of my close
friends live — were extremely hard hit,
did I realize the gravity of the situation.
Many thoughts raced through my
mind. First and foremost: was my family
all right? Never before had I experienced
the kind of uncertainty and fear about
their fate that I did for those first few
minutes that it took to reach them.
I began to wonder and worry about

how my friends in the hard hit areas
fared.
What if I had been going to Oakland
or Berkeley or Santa Cruz at 5:04 p.m.?
What if sections of the Dumbarton —
the bridge that I usually take to the East
Bay Area — had collapsed?
As someone who has been active in
statewide student politics, I knew that
just as easily I could have been on my
way to UC-Berkeley or UC-Santa Cruz
or San Jose State University for a meet
ing, a march or just to see friends.
Crises such as these have a way of
bringing out the best sentiments in people
to help others, whether those in need are
strangers or good friends. Being both a
witness of and a participant in this spirit
of familyhood and volunteerism displayed
in the wake of the quake, my faith in
human nature was reaffirmed.
Human nature, I discovered, is not sel
fish and motivated by what gratifies in
dividual needs. It is selfless and directed
toward the needs of a greater body of
people. There is a drive in all people to
help others regain some semblance of the
basic necessities.
Tuesday's earthquake made me
profoundly aware of the fact that we are
all brothers and sisters together in this
world. An immediate bond and closeness
developed among people helping each
other out in their time of need. This was
the spirit that motivated people in Bay
Area communities to help their neighbors
to safety, rush them to hospitals and
provide food and shelter for those who
needed it.
It was this spirit of hararnbec (Swahili

for "all pull together") in Ujamaa House
that motivated us to open our lounges
and many of our rooms to Griffin House,
Robinson House, Roth House and other
campus "refugees" for the night and per
haps for many days afterward.
It was a sense, as Martin Luther King,
Jr. once said, in which one goes beyond
helping a stranger on Jericho road to
making the road less dangerous.
On a larger scale, that is why I and
many other people are active in the
African-American community and the
community at large. Just like people who
assisted people trapped in the rubble oi*
those who had no place to ijtay, I try to
help people who, for situations over which
they have no control, are without basic
human necessities, like a good education
or decent housing.
It was this spirit of helping people —
rather than blaming them for being poor,
illiterate or homeless because of situa
tions that are out of their control — that
I believe motivated all of us to give so
willingly and unselfishly.

the spirit that motivated people in Bay
Area communities to help their neighbors
to safety, rush them to hospitals and
provide food and shelter for those who
needed it.
It was this spirit of hararnbec (Swahili

for "all pull together") in Ujamaa House
that motivated us to open our lounges
and many of our rooms to Griffin House,
Robinson House, Roth House and other
campus "refugees" for the night and per
haps for many days afterward.
It was a sense, as Martin Luther King,
Jr. once said, in which one goes beyond
helping a stranger on Jericho road to
making the road less dangerous.
On a larger scale, that is why I and
many other people are active in the
African-American community and the
community at large. Just like people who
assisted people trapped in the rubble oi*
those who had no place to ijtay, I try to
help people who, for situations over which
they have no control, are without basic
human necessities, like a good education
or decent housing.
It was this spirit of helping people —
rather than blaming them for being poor,
illiterate or homeless because of situa
tions that are out of their control — that
I believe motivated all of us to give so
willingly and unselfishly.
