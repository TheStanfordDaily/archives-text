## Faculty should be compassionate for rest of quarter 
### 
WE HAVE NOW had an oppor
tunity to evaluate student
reaction to the displacement
caused by Tuesday's earthquake.
More than 1600 undergraduates
were left homeless on Tuesday and
Wednesday evening; about 600 still lack
a permanent residence. Some graduate
students have also experienced disloca
tion.
Despite our best efforts to resume
normal activities as quickly and
smoothly as possible, that resumption
has presented difficulties.
Most students are still unable to
enter the libraries; many have been
unable to retrieve books and notes

Now that we have a better
notion of the disruption
caused by the earthquake,
it appears that in many
instances merely postpon
ing due dates for assign
ments or examinations
may not be enough.

from buildings that have been closed
or that have restricted access; and still

others have not yet been able to re
enter their residences.
We are finding a considerable
amount of academic anxiety, particu
larly among our most conscientious
students.
Earlier this week we issued a state
ment requesting that faculty postpone
academic assignments due this week.
Now that we have a better notion of
the disruption caused by the earth
quake, it appears that in many in
stances merely postponing due dates
for assignments or examinations may
not be enough.
Many students â€” particularly those
who are still waiting to be relocated -

are experiencing distress as academic
assignments pile up while they are
trying to cope with disrupted living
and studying situations.
We therefore repeat our appeal to
faculty to be especially compassionate,
understanding and flexible throughout
the remainder of the quarter.
This has been a difficult time for
many of us in the Stanford communi
ty, faculty included. All of us should
make special efforts to act in such a
way as to alleviate unnecessary stress
and anxiety.
