# Students can help with relief efforts on campus, in Bay Area
## 
### 
In the aftermath of our nation's
most catastrophic natural disaster in
recent memory, we have been truly
inspired by the dedication of so many
people at Stanford and across the Bay
Area who have pulled together to help
rebuild communities, relocate displaced
people and families, rescue and aid
iryured people and comfort the several
hundred people who lost loved ones in
the earthquake.
Our deepest sympathies go out to
the people around the Bay Area whose
families and homes have been devas
tated by the earthquake, and we recog
nize the efforts of workers and
firefighters who risked their lives to
save people on Interstate 880 and in
cities such as San Francisco and Santa
Cruz.

Closer to home, we thank the many
faculty, staff, students, workers and
administrators who put in overtime
hours to inspect buildings, relocate
displaced students and get the Univer
sity functioning again.
And although we are fortunate that
nobody was seriously injured, more
than 500 students who are currently
living in dorm lounges have just found
out that their houses will be closed for
the entire quarter.
We can give sympathy and assistance
to the Row residents; offer your room,
help with schoolwork and most of all
lend a sympathetic shoulder to those
who are your friends and those who
may be living in your lounge.
To help those most in need, students
and staff have been collecting clothes
and delivering them to families across
the Bay Area. The Public Service Cen
ter and the ASSU have organized a
Red Cross fundraising effort — we
encourage all of you to donate a couple
of dollars (see your resident assistants
for details).

Arrangements have been made so
that proceeds from student tickets and
volunteer clean-up from Sunday's 49ers
game will go to the Bay Area Earth
quake Relief Fund.
Many students have already helped
reshelve books and clean up classrooms
and laboratories — there is still much
to be done and it's not too late to help
out.
There still are communities, such as
Watsonville, Santa Cruz and Hollister,
that have not recovered from the dev
astation of the quake — thousands are
homeless and in some cases whole
towns have been leveled.
We encourage those of you who
would like to help out in these com
munities to give us a call at 725-ASSU
— we'll be organizing relief efforts as
soon as we receive word on how we
can help.
The Stanford community has on
countless occasions pulled together to
help neighboring communities in times
of need; this week has been no excep
tion. 11*s when we work together that

our nation and University are at their
best.
