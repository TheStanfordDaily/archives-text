The writing life is often presented as
a public affair in which strong personal
ities meld or collide, drink heavily, make
love indiscriminately and manufacture
witticisms with alarming rotary preci
sion. As the popular fascination with the
Beats, Bloomsbury and the unread, out
of print, but much-discussed Algonquin
Round Table group shows, the personal
lives of writers arouse an interest which
is often denied to their creations.
In deference to this belief that an art
ist's life transcends his work, the literary
biography — like the memoir and the
published diary — has become a sort of
book-length book review bolstered by a
series of anecdotes, quotations and criti
cal judgments. It both entertains the
reader and fills in the embarrassing blank
that the writer's name had previously
drawn, assuaging the urge to actually
read the novelist's novels or the poet's
poems.
As the view of letter writing as an
independent art has steadily declined, an
author's correspondence has come to be
seen as an inside but incomplete version
of his biography, as nothing but scattered
dots for an editor's footnotes to connect.
The magnificent selection of Vladimir
Nabokov's letters which recently has been
published shows the writing life of one
of this century's finer novelists as some
thing quite different.
Apart from a dozen or so letters dating
from Nabokov's emigre period in Ger
many and France in the twenties and
thirties, the letters collected in this
volume were written during his years in
America and Switzerland. They trace his
unique transformation in middle-age

from a Russian writer to a writer in
English. Although this book offers little
dramatic "human interest" — there are
no drunken fights, no women abandoned
— the struggles and triumphs which ac
companied Nabokov's metamorphosis, as
well as the dignity and sharp humor with
which he met both opposition and suc
cess, form plot lines which are at once
moving and informative.
We therefore follow in these letters a
writer's difficulties, debates and disagree
ments with editors, translators, book
jacket illustrators, publishers and biog
raphers.
For example, shortly before he left Eu
rope, Nabokov wrote a letter to his Amer
ican agent describing what he later
referred to as his "private tragedy":
"(My novels) belong to Russia and her
literature, and not only style but subject
undergoes a horrible bleeding and distor
tion when translated into another tongue.
The German version of "King, Queen,
Jack" is a cheap travesty; "Camera
Obscura" which, in Russian, was meant
as an elaborate parody, lies limp and
lifeless in John Long's and Grassett's tor
turehouses; and "Despair" which is some
thing more than an essay on the
psychology of crime turns out to be a
half- baked thriller — even when I trans
late it myself. Strange indeed are the
"fata" of my books!"
On another occasion Nabokov, who was
also a dedicated lepidopterist, wrote in
response to the projected design for a
volume of his poems:
"... turning to the title-page butterfly,
its head is that of a small tortoise, and
its pattern is that of a common Cabbage
White butterfly (whereas the insect in
my poem is clearly described as belonging
to a group of small blue butterflies with
dotted undersides) which is as meaning
less in the present case as would be a
picture of a tuna fish on the jacket of
'Moby Dick.' I want to be quite clear and
frank: I have nothing against stylization
but I do object to stylized ignorance."

The ignorance which Nabokov faced
was not always stylized; it was often bla
tant and unrepentant. As Dmitri Nabokov
(the writer's son, translator and the co
editor of this volume) notes in his elo
quent and admirably brief introduction,
the publishing history of "Lolita," his
father's most famous and enduring work,
is almost novelistic in its intrigues and
adventures. This perfect novel — "which
deals," as Nabokov told a prospective pub
lisher, "with the problems of a very moral
middle-aged gentleman who falls very im
morally in love with his stepdaughter of
thirteen" — suffered extended delays,
rejections and misunderstandings before
it was published in its creator's adopted
country. As Nabokov wrote to Graham
Greene, one of the book's early cham
pions: "My poor Lolita is having a rough
time. The pity is that if I had made her
a boy, or a cow or a bicycle, Philistines
might never have flinched."
These are only a few of the numerous
delights this volume contains. Also of
particular interest are Nabokov's demoli
tions of Andrew Field, his deranged and
incompetent biographer, and Maurice
Girodias, the roguish pornographer
whose Olympia Press first issued
"Lolita."
Throughout, Nabokov's letters power
fully convey the inherent drama of
literary creation, and testify to the
writer's unremitting dedication to art and
his belief in the capacity of elegant and
precise writing to survive even the
greatest misfortunes.
As beautiful as they often are, however,
these letters will not join such classic
literary letters as those of Keats and
Flaubert — the high level against which
a writer of Nabokov's stature deserves to
be judged. A mischance, if not a tragedy,
of Nabokov's serial exile throughout Eu
rope and America was that he was left
without real contemporaries. Though he
was temperamentally allergic to cliques,
schools of thought and literary politics,
an extended correspondence with some

one he respected would have prompted
letters as rich inartistic insight as those
published here are in wit, passion and
caring attention. The editors promise a
future volume will contain correspond
ence with other emigre writers, his wife
and his parents.
It has been habitual for critics and
reviewers to mischaracterize Nabokov as
an aloof and uncaring man. Clearly this

is an opinion based on transparent misun
derstandings of his creative works. These
letters show Nabokov to have been what
any careful reader of his fiction would
have known already: a decent, dignified,
principled and intensely compassionate
man.

reviewers to mischaracterize Nabokov as
an aloof and uncaring man. Clearly this

is an opinion based on transparent misun

The writing life is often presented as
a public affair in which strong personal
ities meld or collide, drink heavily, make
love indiscriminately and manufacture
witticisms with alarming rotary preci
sion. As the popular fascination with the
Beats, Bloomsbury and the unread, out
of print, but much-discussed Algonquin
Round Table group shows, the personal
lives of writers arouse an interest which
is often denied to their creations.
In deference to this belief that an art
ist's life transcends his work, the literary
biography — like the memoir and the
published diary — has become a sort of
book-length book review bolstered by a
series of anecdotes, quotations and criti
cal judgments. It both entertains the
reader and fills in the embarrassing blank
that the writer's name had previously
drawn, assuaging the urge to actually
read the novelist's novels or the poet's
poems.
As the view of letter writing as an
independent art has steadily declined, an
author's correspondence has come to be
seen as an inside but incomplete version
of his biography, as nothing but scattered
dots for an editor's footnotes to connect.
The magnificent selection of Vladimir
Nabokov's letters which recently has been
published shows the writing life of one
of this century's finer novelists as some
thing quite different.
Apart from a dozen or so letters dating
from Nabokov's emigre period in Ger
many and France in the twenties and
thirties, the letters collected in this
volume were written during his years in
America and Switzerland. They trace his
unique transformation in middle-age

from a Russian writer to a writer in
English. Although this book offers little
dramatic "human interest" — there are
no drunken fights, no women abandoned
— the struggles and triumphs which ac
companied Nabokov's metamorphosis, as
well as the dignity and sharp humor with
which he met both opposition and suc
cess, form plot lines which are at once
moving and informative.
We therefore follow in these letters a
writer's difficulties, debates and disagree
ments with editors, translators, book
jacket illustrators, publishers and biog
raphers.
For example, shortly before he left Eu
rope, Nabokov wrote a letter to his Amer
ican agent describing what he later
referred to as his "private tragedy":
"(My novels) belong to Russia and her
literature, and not only style but subject
undergoes a horrible bleeding and distor
tion when translated into another tongue.
The German version of "King, Queen,
Jack" is a cheap travesty; "Camera
Obscura" which, in Russian, was meant
as an elaborate parody, lies limp and
lifeless in John Long's and Grassett's tor
turehouses; and "Despair" which is some
thing more than an essay on the
psychology of crime turns out to be a
half- baked thriller — even when I trans
late it myself. Strange indeed are the
"fata" of my books!"
On another occasion Nabokov, who was
also a dedicated lepidopterist, wrote in
response to the projected design for a
volume of his poems:
"... turning to the title-page butterfly,
its head is that of a small tortoise, and
its pattern is that of a common Cabbage
White butterfly (whereas the insect in
my poem is clearly described as belonging
to a group of small blue butterflies with
dotted undersides) which is as meaning
less in the present case as would be a
picture of a tuna fish on the jacket of
'Moby Dick.' I want to be quite clear and
frank: I have nothing against stylization
but I do object to stylized ignorance."

The ignorance which Nabokov faced
was not always stylized; it was often bla
tant and unrepentant. As Dmitri Nabokov
(the writer's son, translator and the co
editor of this volume) notes in his elo
quent and admirably brief introduction,
the publishing history of "Lolita," his
father's most famous and enduring work,
is almost novelistic in its intrigues and
adventures. This perfect novel — "which
deals," as Nabokov told a prospective pub
lisher, "with the problems of a very moral
middle-aged gentleman who falls very im
morally in love with his stepdaughter of
thirteen" — suffered extended delays,
rejections and misunderstandings before
it was published in its creator's adopted
country. As Nabokov wrote to Graham
Greene, one of the book's early cham
pions: "My poor Lolita is having a rough
time. The pity is that if I had made her
a boy, or a cow or a bicycle, Philistines
might never have flinched."
These are only a few of the numerous
delights this volume contains. Also of
particular interest are Nabokov's demoli
tions of Andrew Field, his deranged and
incompetent biographer, and Maurice
Girodias, the roguish pornographer
whose Olympia Press first issued
"Lolita."
Throughout, Nabokov's letters power
fully convey the inherent drama of
literary creation, and testify to the
writer's unremitting dedication to art and
his belief in the capacity of elegant and
precise writing to survive even the
greatest misfortunes.
As beautiful as they often are, however,
these letters will not join such classic
literary letters as those of Keats and
Flaubert — the high level against which
a writer of Nabokov's stature deserves to
be judged. A mischance, if not a tragedy,
of Nabokov's serial exile throughout Eu
rope and America was that he was left
without real contemporaries. Though he
was temperamentally allergic to cliques,
schools of thought and literary politics,
an extended correspondence with some

one he respected would have prompted
letters as rich inartistic insight as those
published here are in wit, passion and
caring attention. The editors promise a
future volume will contain correspond
ence with other emigre writers, his wife
and his parents.
It has been habitual for critics and
reviewers to mischaracterize Nabokov as
an aloof and uncaring man. Clearly this

is an opinion based on transparent misun
derstandings of his creative works. These
