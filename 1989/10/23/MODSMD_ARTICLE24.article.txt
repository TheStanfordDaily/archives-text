Bringing to light ten once-prominent
figures of 19th century French society
is the goal of Gordon Wright's new
Notable or Notorious: A Gallery of
Parisians.

The thin volume,
published as part of the
Portable Stanford se
ries by the Stanford
Alumni Association, is
a collection of essays
each devoted to a mys
tic, politician, artist or
intellectual of the
France's Second Em
pire and Third Repub
lic.

Wright's studies of figures such as
the Marquis de Mores, an adventuring
French aristocrat, protofascist and one
time cattle baron of the Dakota Bad
Lands and Hippolyte Rivail (better
known by his druidic name of Allan
Kardec) founder of the "spiritism"
movement that attracted thousands of
adherents worldwide add color and per
sonality to studies of 19th century
French society.
Wright, the American doyen of French
history and a professor emeritus at
Stanford University, has authored nu

merous books on French and European
history, including "France in Modern
Times" and"The Ordeal of Total War,
1939-1945." He moves with easy grace
through this book, which is unencum
bered by footnotes and accessible to a
wide audience.
Together the essays form an
eminently readable collective social
snapshot of the bourgeois and upwardly
mobile figures who peopled the inter
woven social circles of Paris during its
rapid 19th century expansion.
Back when Columbae was still a
housed cooperative, residents used to
boycott white processed sugar because
of the allegedly dangerous working con
ditions to which agricultural workers
were exposed. Alec Wilkinson's new
book Big Sugar: Seasons in the Cane
Fields of Florida offers new support
for that position.
"Big Sugar", published by Alfred A.
Knopf, is the story of migrant sugar
cane cutters who are brought from the
West Indies — notably Jamaica — every
year to bring in the Florida sugar cane
crop.
Wilkinson's book, which appeared in
excerpted form as an investigative ar

tide in"The New Yorker," is the prod
uct of more than four years of research
and interviews, and is largely an indict
ment of working conditions and prac-

tices on and around the
large sugar plantations.
In the book, Wilkin
son visits small, isolated
company towns to talk
with West Indian field
hands, who use poetic,
image-laden forms of
speech to describe their
jobs and lives.
Wilkinson's account

reaches back to the 1940s to illustrate
the false promises, threats and intimi
dation under which black Americans
were lured to the farms, where they
were watched by white guards with
blackjacks and pistols. He further sug
gests that the 1970s death of a picketing
college student outside one sugar mill
occurred under highly suspicious cir
cumstances.
Throughout, Wilkinson's tight sen
tences, short chapters and attention to
Florida small-town and sugar plantation
culture make this book move along at
a quick and urgent pace.
