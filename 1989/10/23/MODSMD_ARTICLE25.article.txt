## Utah soaks Stanford, 27-24 
### Chris Crader Editorial staff 
M lt was a game that we definitely
should have won. No excuses."
Quarterback Steve Smith and his
Stanford teammates appeared to have
Saturday's football game with Utah well
in hand, with a 24-13 lead with seven
minutes remaining. But Ute quarter
back Scott Mitchell threw two late
touchdown passes, including one with
34 seconds left in the game, and Utah
thwarted a Cardinal drive on the last
play of the game to hold on for a 27-24
win.
Stanford fell to 1-6 with the loss in
front of 15,000 people at Stanford Sta
dium. Utah improved to 3-5.
"This was the most frustrating by
far," inside linebacker Jono Tunney
said. "I think we had it won."
After squandering an 11-point lead
the Cardinal marched the ball down to
the Ute 17 with five seconds remaining.
Since Stanford had used all its timeouts
on the drive, Coach Denny Green had
to think quickly. He did, and when he
sent his field goal team out on to the
field, the decision surprised Utah so
much they called time out.
"I didn't want to call time out because
I wanted to force tham to make a quick
decision on what they were going to
do," Utah Coach Jim Fassel said, "but

Cardinal 24

we didn't have the right personnel on
the field. So we had to call a time out."
During the time out, Green recon
sidered and sent his offense back out.
Smith dropped back, looked for split
end Ed McCaffrey in the back of the
end zone, threw, and had the pass batted
away by cornerback Sean Knox as time
expired.
"With five seconds left we were going
to kick," Green said. "I changed my
mind. The team and the other coaches
wanted to go for the touchdown. I was
probably the only one who didn't. Not
because I didn't have faith in the team
— but the odds of 20 yards on one play
aren't so good."
Stanford's best rushing effort of the
season, 172 yards including 86 by Galen
Foster and 68 by Tom Vardell, was
wasted as Mitchell was 30-of-56 for 388
yards and three touchdowns. Smith,
starting for the injured Brian Johnson,
finished 18-for-32 for 288 yards and
three scores.
Utah struck early as Wayne Lammle
kicked a 46-yard field goal and Mitchell
threw a 19-yard touchdown pass to tight
end Dennis Smith in the first quarter.

Stanford came right back, however,
with 17 second-quarter points, high
lighted by a 45-yard run by Foster, who
started at tailback after being converted
from defense two weeks ago. A late
Lammle field goal from 53 yards cut
the Cardinal lead to 17-13 at the half.
Mitchell moved Utah 64 yards on six
plays, culminating in a 26-yard pass to
Dennis Smith to bring the Utes within
four with six minutes, 34 seconds
remaining. The Cardinal went three
yards backwards on three plays, thanks
to a holding penalty, and had to punt
after running less than two minutes off
the clock.
Utah drove to the Cardinal nine, but
free saftey Albert Richardson jarred the
ball loose from Steve Abrams and out
side linebacker Chris Hawkins recov
ered with 2:20 to go.
Stanford gained only six yards on
three plays, however, and the Cardinal
punted again. Stanford only ran 1:01
off the clock.
Mitchell hit Smith for seven yards
then found Darrel Hicks for 22 to move
the Utes to the Cardinal 23. Bryan
Rowley then dropped a Mitchell pass
and strong saftey Rob Englehardt broke
up the next pass and Utah was down
to its last 41 seconds. Mitchell only
needed seven, however, as he found
Hicks at the Cardinal seven and he ran
into the endzone.

season, 172 yards including 86 by Galen
Foster and 68 by Tom Vardell, was
wasted as Mitchell was 30-of-56 for 388
yards and three touchdowns. Smith,
starting for the injured Brian Johnson,
finished 18-for-32 for 288 yards and
three scores.
Utah struck early as Wayne Lammle
kicked a 46-yard field goal and Mitchell
threw a 19-yard touchdown pass to tight
end Dennis Smith in the first quarter.

Stanford came right back, however,
with 17 second-quarter points, high
lighted by a 45-yard run by Foster, who
started at tailback after being converted
from defense two weeks ago. A late
Lammle field goal from 53 yards cut
the Cardinal lead to 17-13 at the half.
Mitchell moved Utah 64 yards on six
plays, culminating in a 26-yard pass to
Dennis Smith to bring the Utes within
four with six minutes, 34 seconds
remaining. The Cardinal went three
yards backwards on three plays, thanks
to a holding penalty, and had to punt
after running less than two minutes off
the clock.
Utah drove to the Cardinal nine, but
free saftey Albert Richardson jarred the
ball loose from Steve Abrams and out
side linebacker Chris Hawkins recov
ered with 2:20 to go.
Stanford gained only six yards on
three plays, however, and the Cardinal
punted again. Stanford only ran 1:01
off the clock.
Mitchell hit Smith for seven yards
then found Darrel Hicks for 22 to move
the Utes to the Cardinal 23. Bryan
Rowley then dropped a Mitchell pass
and strong saftey Rob Englehardt broke
up the next pass and Utah was down
to its last 41 seconds. Mitchell only
needed seven, however, as he found
Hicks at the Cardinal seven and he ran
into the endzone.

Center Chuck Gllllngham doubles over in disappointment as Utah players celebrate
their 27-24 victory over Stanford. Stanford travels to USC with a 1-6 record.
