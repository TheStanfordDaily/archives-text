# Green's teams play four years

### Mark Rogowsky Senior staff writer 
Faced with a third and eight at the
Cardinal 42 Saturday, Stanford Coach
Denny Green made one his most inter
esting decisions of the day â€” if not the
season.
It wasn't the played he called, a pass
to Ed McCaffrey that went for an in
completion, it was one of the players
he sent in: David Calomese.
Calomese is a freshman wide receiver
who is highly regarded. Given Stanford's
corps of talented, veteran wide receivers
it was thought that Calomese would

redshirt this season thereby preserving
all four years of his collegiate eligibility.
Also, given that Stanford was already
1-5 and Calomese hadn't played a down
in 1989, it seemed like it would be a
waste for him to lose eligibility in a
season headed nowhere fast.
So much for the conventional wisdom.
Calomese played one down Saturday
and wasn't involved in the action. He
may see more action this year, but, even
if he doesn't, Calomese has only three
more years of football left at Stanford.
The question is why. The answer is
Denny Green and his philosophy of the
way the football program should be run

at Stanford.
"We don't redshirt 'em anyway,"
Green said. "[Players] have got four
years to get it done. I said right from
the start, I'm not a five-year man."
Green hasn't ruled out the possibility
of making exceptions, especially in light
of the fact Stanford has redshirted most
freshmen for the past several years.
"You just don't go cold turkey," he
noted, explaining that some freshmen
who have not and will not play this
season may be considered for a fifth
year when the time comes.
