# Green's teams play four years
## 
### Mark Rogowsky Senior staff writer 
Faced with a third and eight at the
Cardinal 42 Saturday, Stanford Coach
Denny Green made one his most inter
esting decisions of the day â€” if not the
season.
It wasn't the played he called, a pass
to Ed McCaffrey that went for an in
completion, it was one of the players
he sent in: David Calomese.
Calomese is a freshman wide receiver
who is highly regarded. Given Stanford's
corps of talented, veteran wide receivers
it was thought that Calomese would

redshirt this season thereby preserving
all four years of his collegiate eligibility.
Also, given that Stanford was already
1-5 and Calomese hadn't played a down
in 1989, it seemed like it would be a
waste for him to lose eligibility in a
season headed nowhere fast.
So much for the conventional wisdom.
Calomese played one down Saturday
and wasn't involved in the action. He
may see more action this year, but, even
if he doesn't, Calomese has only three
more years of football left at Stanford.
The question is why. The answer is
Denny Green and his philosophy of the
way the football program should be run

at Stanford.
"We don't redshirt 'em anyway,"
Green said. "[Players] have got four
years to get it done. I said right from
the start, I'm not a five-year man."
Green hasn't ruled out the possibility
of making exceptions, especially in light
of the fact Stanford has redshirted most
freshmen for the past several years.
"You just don't go cold turkey," he
noted, explaining that some freshmen
who have not and will not play this
season may be considered for a fifth
year when the time comes.
That extra year will not come
automatically with Green, though.
"He (the player in question)
would have to be a hell of a lot
better than someone you recruit."
Green added that players who
miss a season due to injury will
be allowed to choose for them
selves whether to return for a
fifth year.
If anyone is looking to argue
Green's philosophy, they'd better
come prepared with a strong case
because Green has thought about
the issue at length. He is quick
to point out that Notre Dame and
Air Force have a no-redshirt policy
and are very successful.
Green also feels the promise of
the fifth year messes with the
minds of some players. "Too often,
if a freshman starts thinking
about a fifth year . . . you miss a
lot along the way.
"You think everything's going
to be taken care of (in the fifth
year)," Green added. "(The no
redshirt policyl enables a guy to
concentrate on school and his
career as four-year things."
Further, Green has a little num
bers game that supports his po
sition. He noted that if you spread
your 95 scholarships (the maxi
mum allowed) over five years, you
can bring in 19 recruits a season.

The fact is that more players will come
through the system and that increases
the chances that more stars will be
found as well.

If you take those same scholar
ships and use them in four years,
nearly 24 new players come in
each year.
If you go with a five-year men
tality, "How many players do you
get over a five-year period?"
Green asked. The answer, of
course, is 95. With a four-year
plan, however, you get over 115
players in the same five years.
It's a difference of 20 players.
"That's a whole class you can
put an X through," Green ex
plained. "It increases your chance
of getting better players" if you
bring more in over the same pe
riod.
He also added that if someone
plays as a freshman and subse
quently suffers an injury that
knocks them out for a whole
season, Ed McCaffrey for exam
ple, they'll still have four years
of football. Charlie Young, who
redshirted as a freshman and will
miss all of '89 with a knee iryury,
will graduate with only three
years on the field.
Green's math isn't perfect. It

ignores the fact that a number of
players who redshirted as fresh
man skip their fifth year anyway.
It also neglects to figure on the
fact that some freshmen will play
in their first year here.
Still, the fact is that more
players will come through the sys
tem and that increases the
chances that more stars will be
found as well. An added benefit
that Green didn't mention is in
recruiting.
When Stanford coaches canvass
the nation talking to high school
football players, they'll honestly
be able to say "you're going to
have a chance to win a job on the
team." And, they won't be talking
about winning it in practice. As
Green has shown this year, he'll
put a Dave Garnett or a Bob Whit
field on the field and let them
show what they can do.
If they play better than the guy
whose place they are filling, they
can win the job. You better believe
that a senior who is typically the
star of his high school team will
perk up when he hears that.
