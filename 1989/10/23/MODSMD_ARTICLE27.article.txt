S A?fâ€”FRA N CISCO CAP) -
The World Series will not
resume urttil Friday night, three
days later than originally hoped,
baseball commissioner Fay Vin
cent announced yesterday.
Games 3 and 4 and, if neces
sary, Game 5, will be played over
the weekend at Candlestick
Park. If needed, Monday would
be an off-day and the Series
could end in Game 6 on Tues
day, Oct. 31, or Game 7 on Wed
nesday, Nov. 1 in the Oakland
Coliseum. Oakland leads the Se
ries 2-0.
"We have agreed that baseball
should resume with enthusiasm
this coming week," Vincent said
in a joint statement with San
Francisco Mayor Art Agnos.
"But Tuesday was too ambi
tious."
The Series was interrupted
last Tuesday night when an
earthquake shook Candlestick

Park 30 minutes before the
start of Game 3. Baseball had
hoped to resume this Tuesday,
but Vincent strongly said that
the Bay area's priorities were
much more important than the
World Series.
"For most San Franciscans,
the shock and the grief have
just begun to wear off," Agnos
said.
So now, this Series, which had
already been delayed by the
longest layoff ever, will go 11
days between games.
All games will be played at
their original starting times.
Agnos cited three major
reasons for waiting until Friday,
saying Candlestick Park must
be certified as safe, that the Bay
area could handle the expected
traffic problems and that there
would be enough security.
"I've been assured that
Candlestick could withstand an

other earthquake," Agnos
said. "I will study reports on
the stadium tonight.
"I have to have an ironclad
assurance that this facility is
safe for people to use."
Asked whether he had con
sidered calling off the Series,
Vincent said, "My judgement is
that this community is better
served by playing the World Se
ries. But we did consider can
celling it.
Vincent said the teams would
not play next Monday because,
"Monday hasn't been a day the
World Series played."
The reason for that, however,
is because baseball has not
wanted to get into a television
competition with Monday Night
Football, although it did happen
in 1986, when rain pushed back
