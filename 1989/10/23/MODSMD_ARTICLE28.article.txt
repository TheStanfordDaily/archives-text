Who needs Candlestick Park
anyway?
The San Francisco 49ers cer
tainly don't after they ran their
record to 6-1, including a perfect
6-0 mark away from Candlestick,
by defeating the New England
Patriots 37-20 in front of 80,000
people at Stanford Stadium yes
terday.
The game, originally scheduled
for Candlestick, was moved to
Stanford as a result of Tuesday's
earthquake.
"We do thank Stanford," 49er
Coach George Seifert said. "It was
very neighborly of Stanford to
provide this outstanding facility
to us and New England for this
game."
Due to scheduling conflicts with
the Giants, the 49ers have only
two scheduled home games among

their first eight. Their other home
game was a 13-12 loss to the Los
Angeles Rams three weeks ago.
San Francisco won despite the
fact that starting quarterback Joe
Montana was knocked out of the
game with a knee sprain on the
second-to-last play of the first
half. Starting free safety Jeff Ful
ler, starting linebacker Jim
Fahnhorst and backup running
back Harry Sydney were also lost
to injury.
Fuller suffered multiple frac
tures in his neck on the game's
second play. Doctors at Stanford
University Hospital said Fuller,
who suffered compression frac
tures in three neck vertebrae, was
alert and moving his extremities
and that the injury was not life
threatening.
Steve Young came in to replace
Montana and completed 11-of-12
passes for 188 yards and three

touchdowns, including a one-yard
touchdown pass to tight end Wes
ley Walls on the last play of the
first half.
Montana was 16-of-22 for 178
yards and one touchdown and had
40 yards on three carries.
New England's quarterback, 36-
year-old Steve Grogan, kept the
Patriots close with a few big plays,
but it was not enough to beat the
defending Super Bowl champions.
Grogan was 15-of-29 for 240
yards, including touchdown
strikes of 55 and 51 yards.
San Francisco took a 17-10 lead
into the locker room after Young's
first touchdown pass before scor
ing the last 20 points of the game.
Neither team's defense im
pressed as each team was forced
to punt only once in the whole
game, but San Francisco inter
cepted Grogan twice. The 49ers
didn't turn the ball over.
