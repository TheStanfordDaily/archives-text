Coach Berhane Andeberhan
summed up the Cardinal women's
soccer weekend with one concise
statement, "We played really well,
but we had to contend with very
difficult circumstances."
After being stuck in Washing
ton D.C. Sunday night because of
a flight delay, Stanford (10-4-1)
returns home from the Virginia
Invitational today with a split
against two talented Eastern op
ponents. After taking care of Duke
with a 2-1 victory on Saturday,
the Cardinal fell yesterday in the
championship game in a disap
pointing loss to No. 4 Virginia 3-2.
The 19th-ranked Cardinal
started slowly on the sunny Sun
day afternoon. Virginia scored two
goals in the first twenty minutes
of the game as Stanford adjusted
to the talented Cavalier squad.
Ten minutes later, junior Jennifer
"Rocket" Rowland took a shot
which ricocheted off the post onto
classmate Lisa Sime's foot. Sime
picked up the loose ball and put
the shot in the back of the net to
make the score 2-1.
"Virginia is a very aggressive
and rough, but very clean," An
deberhan said. "We played with
them; we played very well."
One haunting image remained
with the team after Sunday's loss.
With barely any time left in the
first half, the Cavalier's converted
what Andeberhan called a "phan
tom goal." For a reason not ap

parent to either Andeberhan or
the Virginia coach, the referee
called a foul on Stanford within
the box and awarded Virginia (16-
3) a penalty kick. After Virginia
converted the free shot, the Car
dinal headed into halftime down
3-1.
"If we had seen some fair
refereeing, I am sure we would
have won," Andeberhan said.
"The Virginia coach apologized to
me for the circumstances and
commented that we had been one
of the toughest teams they had
seen all year.".
In the second half, the Cardinal
marked up the only goal. After
being shocked by the "phantom"
goal late in the first half, Stanford
played a very solid second half.
With 10 minutes left in the game,
sophomore Heather Mclntyre
found freshman standout Julie
Foudy in front of the goal and
placed the ball where Foudy could
convert a header, her 12th goal
of the season, to make the score
3-2.
"After being down 2-0 early, we
really kept playing hard." An
deberhan said. "We really did play
well."
Saturday afternoon, Stanford
found itself needing to adjust to
a new, rougher style of play.

Rowland was the target cf one of
the attacks by the Eastern squad
when she was taken down from
behind with a back tackle by Blue
Devil Delilah Huelking. Unlike
many other rough plays on the
afternoon, Huelking was hit with
a yellow card for her dangerous
attack, but, more similar to the
rest of the game, the Duke squad
used Huelking's aggressive play
to build up confidence.
After dominating the first 10
minutes of the game against Duke
(12- 6), Stanford began to get flus
tered as the referee allowed both
teams to utilize late tackles and
rough play. Duke gained momen
tum from the tackles and pushing,
and Blue Devil Knsten Bigelow
took advantage of the Cardinal
frustrations by passing a ball to
teammate Dena Paris who con
verted the goal to put Duke up
1-0.
"The roughness threw us out
of our game plan," Andeberhan
said. "We didn't respond in the
first half. In the second half, we
did respond, and we found our
rhythm."
Just over 20 minutes into the
second half, senior Tonya An
tonucci decided to take control of
the game by converting two goals.
First, she released an unassisted
20-yard shot to knot the score at
1-1, and, then, a little over a min
ute later, she picked up a missed
shot off the post and volleyed the
ball into the back of the net to
record her fourth goal of the
season.
