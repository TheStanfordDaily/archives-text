# Some dorms to reopen, four closed indefinitely
## 
### Pam Weisz Staff writer 
Good and bad news greeted the hundreds
of displaced students who filled Kresge Au
ditorium Friday evening to hear about the
fate of their houses.
Of the 15 houses originally closed, seven
will be reopened shortly, four require ad
ditional inspection and four will definitely
be closed, Keith Guy, director of housing
and food service, told the students.
Theta Chi, Haus Mitteleuropa, and
Slavianskii Dom sustained only "minor
problems," Guy said. He predicted that
these houses would be open by today. In
addition, Grove Lasuen, Hammarskjold,
Phi Sig and Kairos should be open by the
end of this week.
The news of the reopening of these
houses evoked shouts, applause and tears
as residents hugged each other joyfully.
The fates of Durand, La Maison Fran
caise, Theta Xi and Phi Psi, however, are
still undetermined. The information will
be available this afternoon, according to
Michael Jackson, associate dean of student
affairs.
Columbae, Delta Tau Delta, Roth and
Synergy all suffered "profound structural
damage," according to Guy. These houses
will be closed at least for the quarter and
perhaps longer. Decisions have not yet been
made regarding whether they will be
repaired or destroyed, Jackson said.
Jackson said the planning for a housing
draw for displaced students may begin to
morrow when the exact number of students
needing to be relocated will be known.
As of now, the number of displaced stu
dents is 304. If Durand, French House,
Theta Xi and Phi Psi all reopen the number
will be no more than 150, perhaps less if
groups of displaced students elect to move
off campus.

Jackson said the draw will work the same
way as walk-ons. Students will pick a num
ber, look at the available spaces and choose
where they would like to go.
Manzanita Park, Lagunita Court, Row
houses and Roble Hall are all being con
sidered as possible sites for the displaced
students, Jackson said. Guest rooms and
study rooms around campus will also be
converted into student rooms.
He added that nothing is definite, how
ever, since the exact number of students
needing relocation is still unknown. He
stressed that only spaces which are "safe,
private and liveable" will be offered to dis
placed students.
Students whose houses have been closed
will be released from their housing con
tracts if they wish to move off campus,
according to Alice Supton, associate dean
of student affairs. This option will also be
available to any student who is asked to
take a displaced student into his or her
room, Supton said.
University President Donald Kennedy
told the crowd of displaced students on
Friday that "we are busting our butts" to
resolve the situation as quickly as possible.
Meanwhile, there are several options avail
able for students who are tired of living in
lounges.
The Oak Lounge in Tresidder is open 24
hours a day for displaced students who
need a place to "hang out," according to
Supton. There are televisions and phones
there.
Meal cards have been issued to all dis
placed students, as well as to students who
are eating associates at closed houses.
These cards can be used at any University
dining hall except Sterling Quad.
Many faculty and community members
have opened their houses to students on a
short-term basis. Bill Georges, as
sistant director of the Housing
Center, said that "several
hundred" spaces are still avail
able.
A list of these is posted in the
Housing Center, which is once
again operating out of Old Union.
Georges estimated that about 20
students have taken advantage of
these spaces, including 10 stu
dents who are now living at Ken
nedy's house. He added that many
students want to live "as a com
munity," however, and are there
fore continuing to live together in
various lounges.
Many students are taking the
problem of splitting communities
very seriously. Jackson said that
the plans for relocating students

will "try to accomodate" these
concerns, but he added that this
may not be possible.
Displaced students will be al
lowed to draw in groups of up to
eight, but the current housing sit
uation "can't accomodate" large
groups, Jackson said.
Many of those who live in
student-managed residences are
"vegetarians, vegans (or) have
special food needs," according to
"Movers and Shakers," a newslet
ter put out Friday morning by
members of the displaced commu
nity.
Synergy has arranged to use
the kitchen at Bechtel Interna
tional Center once a week, accord
ing to Jackson, and other houses
may be able to use the Elliot Pro
gram Center kitchen. Jackson
added that this is not a full
kitchen, however, and some
"working out" will be necessary
before it can be used in "a full

blown way."
Administration officials are also
trying to address the possibility
that many displaced students will
face academic problems as a result
of their situation.
Kennedy and Provost James
Rosse have sent a letter to all
faculty members asking that they
be "compassionate and flexible"
in dealing with displaced students.
The letter appears on page 4 of
today's Daily.
Supton promised the students
at Friday's meeting that
"everyone will back you up" in
dealing with academic problems.
Meetings concerning academic
issues for displaced students will
be held Wednesday at 4 p.m. and
Thursday at 7 p.m. in the Tres
idder Oak Lounge.
Supton said, "We know this is
hard," but added that she wants
to "encourage a cooperative atti
tude."

Many students are taking the
problem of splitting communities
very seriously. Jackson said that
the plans for relocating students

will "try to accomodate" these
concerns, but he added that this
may not be possible.
Displaced students will be al
lowed to draw in groups of up to
eight, but the current housing sit
uation "can't accomodate" large
groups, Jackson said.
Many of those who live in
student-managed residences are
"vegetarians, vegans (or) have
special food needs," according to
"Movers and Shakers," a newslet
ter put out Friday morning by
members of the displaced commu
nity.
Synergy has arranged to use
the kitchen at Bechtel Interna
tional Center once a week, accord
ing to Jackson, and other houses
may be able to use the Elliot Pro
gram Center kitchen. Jackson
added that this is not a full
kitchen, however, and some
"working out" will be necessary
before it can be used in "a full

blown way."
Administration officials are also
trying to address the possibility
that many displaced students will
face academic problems as a result
of their situation.
Kennedy and Provost James
Rosse have sent a letter to all
faculty members asking that they
be "compassionate and flexible"
in dealing with displaced students.
The letter appears on page 4 of
today's Daily.
Supton promised the students
at Friday's meeting that
"everyone will back you up" in
dealing with academic problems.
Meetings concerning academic
issues for displaced students will
be held Wednesday at 4 p.m. and
Thursday at 7 p.m. in the Tres
idder Oak Lounge.
Supton said, "We know this is
hard," but added that she wants
to "encourage a cooperative atti
tude."
Good and bad news greeted the hundreds
of displaced students who filled Kresge Au
ditorium Friday evening to hear about the
fate of their houses.
Of the 15 houses originally closed, seven
will be reopened shortly, four require ad
ditional inspection and four will definitely
be closed, Keith Guy, director of housing
and food service, told the students.
Theta Chi, Haus Mitteleuropa, and
Slavianskii Dom sustained only "minor
problems," Guy said. He predicted that
these houses would be open by today. In
addition, Grove Lasuen, Hammarskjold,
Phi Sig and Kairos should be open by the
end of this week.
The news of the reopening of these
houses evoked shouts, applause and tears
as residents hugged each other joyfully.
The fates of Durand, La Maison Fran
caise, Theta Xi and Phi Psi, however, are
still undetermined. The information will
be available this afternoon, according to
Michael Jackson, associate dean of student
affairs.
Columbae, Delta Tau Delta, Roth and
Synergy all suffered "profound structural
damage," according to Guy. These houses
will be closed at least for the quarter and
perhaps longer. Decisions have not yet been
made regarding whether they will be
repaired or destroyed, Jackson said.
Jackson said the planning for a housing
draw for displaced students may begin to
morrow when the exact number of students
needing to be relocated will be known.
As of now, the number of displaced stu
dents is 304. If Durand, French House,
Theta Xi and Phi Psi all reopen the number
will be no more than 150, perhaps less if
groups of displaced students elect to move
off campus.

Jackson said the draw will work the same
way as walk-ons. Students will pick a num
ber, look at the available spaces and choose
where they would like to go.
Manzanita Park, Lagunita Court, Row
houses and Roble Hall are all being con
sidered as possible sites for the displaced
students, Jackson said. Guest rooms and
study rooms around campus will also be
converted into student rooms.
He added that nothing is definite, how
ever, since the exact number of students
needing relocation is still unknown. He
stressed that only spaces which are "safe,
private and liveable" will be offered to dis
placed students.
Students whose houses have been closed
will be released from their housing con
tracts if they wish to move off campus,
according to Alice Supton, associate dean
of student affairs. This option will also be
available to any student who is asked to
take a displaced student into his or her
room, Supton said.
University President Donald Kennedy
told the crowd of displaced students on
Friday that "we are busting our butts" to
resolve the situation as quickly as possible.
Meanwhile, there are several options avail
able for students who are tired of living in
lounges.
The Oak Lounge in Tresidder is open 24
hours a day for displaced students who
need a place to "hang out," according to
Supton. There are televisions and phones
there.
Meal cards have been issued to all dis
placed students, as well as to students who
are eating associates at closed houses.
These cards can be used at any University
dining hall except Sterling Quad.
Many faculty and community members
have opened their houses to students on a
short-term basis. Bill Georges, as
sistant director of the Housing
Center, said that "several
hundred" spaces are still avail
able.
A list of these is posted in the
Housing Center, which is once
again operating out of Old Union.
Georges estimated that about 20
students have taken advantage of
these spaces, including 10 stu
dents who are now living at Ken
nedy's house. He added that many
students want to live "as a com
munity," however, and are there
fore continuing to live together in
various lounges.
