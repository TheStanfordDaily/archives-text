# Water polo beats Bruins, trimmed by Trojans
## Four-goal comeback falls one short 
### T.C. Hall Staff writer 
The Stanford water polo team left for
Los Angeles Thursday knowing they could
return leading the Pacific 10 Conference.
They came home Saturday night wondering
why they weren't.
"This is the most frustrating team I've
ever coached," Coach Dante Dettamanti
said. "I can't believe this team can't put
two good games together."

Cardinal 7, Bruins 5 •
Trojans 10, Cardinal 9 OT

The Cardinal beat UCLA 7-5 Friday in
a game which the team "did everything
right" according to Dettamanti, but the
next day Stanford found itself needing to
rally from a four-goal deficit in the fourth
quarter to tie the Trojans. The team got
the goals, but fell short in the third over
time, losing 10-9.
It was a game of flip-flops, as the Car
dinal began the game leading 2-0 only to
see USC score three unanswered goals and
lead by one at the half. The Trojans con
tinued to dominate in the second half, and
led by as many as four until Stanford woke

up offensively in the fourth quarter and
tied the score at 7-7 at the end of regula
tion.
The first overtime ended with the teams
tied 8-8 and Stanford led by one in the
second overtime with a minute left before
USC came back again .. . with some help.
An Eric Blum penalty gave USC a man
up opportunity which ended in a blocked
shot. Stanford goalie Todd Kemp came out
to get the ball and in the battle with USC
to get possession, the ball got pushed un
derwater. Kemp was blamed, and USC took
the game into sudden death after scoring
on the ensuing penalty shot.
Stanford won the third overtime sprint,
but found that bad luck comes in waves.
A USC attacker surprised Rick McNair into
pushing the ball under water for a penalty,
and then beat the dazed Stanford player
down the pool to go one-on-one with goalie
Kemp.
Kemp went out of the goal and fouled
the man, but got kicked out for his efforts.
Stanford was forced to put a field man in
the goal during USC's power play and USC
scored — end of game.
"We had everything going for us," a frus
trated Dettamanti said. "All we had to do
to be first in the Pac-10 was beat 'SC, and
we didn't do it."
"We are legitimately four or five goals
better than USC," he continued.
