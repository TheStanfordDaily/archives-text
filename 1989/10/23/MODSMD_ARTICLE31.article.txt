Cardinal 1
Golden Bears 1

Although this one may not have
been as memorable as the 19-19
tie in last year's football version
of the Big Game, the Cardinal
men's soccer team played to a 1-1
tie with California yesterday at
Maloney Field.
The tie, which leaves Stanford
at 7-7-2 on the year, continues
the Cardinal's pattern this season
of playing tough against the best
teams in the country and letting
down against lesser opponents
such as the Bears, who moved to
5-8-2.
Cardinal goalkeeper Chris Hel
ling said, "We didn't come out
ready to play for 90 minutes. We
got too complacent after the first
Jialf and took our play for
granted."
1 In the opening 35 minutes, it
looked as if Stanford would coast
to an easy victory. The Cardinal
came out on fire, controlling the

midfield consistently and moving
the ball well with crisp passing.
The goalposts proved to be
much more of a nemesis for the
Cardinal than the California de
fense during the opening minutes,
as freshman midfielder Jim Tal
luto and senior forward Chris
Porch both hit the post with shots.
Porch's miss off the top crossbar
came after he acrobatically hit the
ball out of midair with the back
of his foot.
What seemed like the inevitable
occurred two-thirds of the way
into the half, as senior sweeper
Mark Semioli sent a perfect chip
pass downfield to sophomore
midfielder Rhett Harty, where
Harty drilled the ball past Bear
goalkeeper Matt Simi to give the

Cardinal a 1-0 cushion.
Rather than giving Stanford
momentum, the goal seemed to
revitalize the Bears. The Cardinal
came out flat in the second half
and California took advantage, as
forward Brad Larson evened the
score at 1-1 only three-and-one
half minutes into the half.
The Bear tally came when for
ward Charlie Engs spotted Larson
wide open on the right post after
a Cardinal defensive mixup and
Larson easily booted Engs* cen
tering pass past a helpless Helling.
From here on out, the Stanford
squad never seemed to get un
tracked and could not regain its
first-half dominance.
"Defensively we didn't control
the midfield in the second half.
We gave them too much space and
time to play," Stanford Coach Sam
Koch said.
The Cardinal is next pitted
against Bay Area rival University
of San Francisco tomorrow night
in Burlingame.
