### Forrester Johnson Staff writer 
Jonathan Stark opened his
Stanford tennis career this
weekend at the Volvo Collegiate
Championships in Athens, Ga.
with a showing that should vault
him into the upper echelon of
college tennis.
Stark, a freshman from Med
ford, Ore., powered his way to
the finals before losing to the
third seed, A 1 Parker of Georgia,
6-3,7-6.
On his way to the title match,
Stark defeated Luis Ruette of
TCU 7-5,6-3, then beat fifth

seeded Jose Luis-Noriega of San
Diego in the second round, 7-
5,7-6.
Stark, ranked No. 24 in
preseason Volvo tennis
rankings, then defeated Kansas'
John Falbo 6-2,6-4, and South
Carolina's Stephane Simian 6-
4,5-7,6-4 en route to the final.
Another freshman, Jared Pal
mer, lost to Texas' Steve Bryan,
seeded seventh, in the second
round, 7-5,6-4.
Sophomore Alex O'Brien
dropped a pressure-packed sec
ond round match to Johan
Donar of Miami. Down 5-2 in
the third set, O'Brien fought

back to force a tiebreaker, and
took a 6-1 lead. The six match
points were not enough, though,
as he lost the tiebreaker 9-7,
and the match, 6-3,3-6,7-6.
Stark and Palmer, already
one of the top doubles teams in
the nation and seeded first in
the tournament, took the tough
road to the finals. After beating
teams from Mississippi and Ar
izona State, the duo edged
Parker and Murphy Jensen of
Georgia in a three hour match,
6-4,5-7,7-6(12-10).
In the final, they lost to Cal
ifornia's Doug Eisenman and
Matt Lucena, 3-6,6-3,6-3.
