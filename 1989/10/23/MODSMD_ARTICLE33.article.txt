# Academics take a back seat
## Lacking life's essentials, many forced to put studies aside 
### Todd Schneider 
"Stanford students stress out."
Not exactly a newsflash.
But for about 500 people, the
typical difficulties of life at Stan
ford, from classes to meals, have
been multiplied. Lacking every
thing from underwear to comput
ers to a bed to sleep in, those left
homeless by the quake have had
to struggle to find places to live
as well as to finish their
homework.
Though some will return to
their homes today, and others
later this week, their lives have
been permanently affected by the
loss of their homes.
No privacy
Junior Stew Jenkins, a Kairos
House resident, remembers going
from Memorial Church to his
home immediately after the
tremblor. "[The RAs] were
keeping us out, so we just hung
out on the lawn," he said.
Finally, they let people in for
five minutes to get essentials.
"The first thing we got was the
alcohol."
He, along with a few others,
drove over to Stanford Shopping
Center for dinner. Everybody in
Kairos, except Jenkins, then spent
the night on the lawn next to the
house.
But at 3 a.m., a man came to
turn off the alarm, which had
been blaring incessantly. "The guy
who turned off the alarm said it
was not recommended, but OK to
go back in, so I went up to my
room and went to bed," Jenkins
said.
Some of the residents of Kairos,
including Jenkins, are now living
in a lounge in Casa Zapata.

"[Zapata] is nice and I like the
murals . . . but I have no privacy,"
he said. "[Thursday] night at
about 1 a.m., I was locked out
from the bathrooms. I couldn't
get into any dorms. I was forced
to urinate behind the bushes."
Jenkins said he was "pleased
with the University's response
thus far," but thought classes
should have been canceled until
Monday. "People don't have
access to books, computers," he
said. "It's hard finding a quiet
place to read. . .. They're having
classes like nothing is going on,
and we're trying to organize our
whole lives."
Missing his pool table
Another displaced Kairosian,
Russel, who did not want his last
name used, misses the pool table.
"It was the biggest pool table on
campus, and I'll never see it
again."
He stayed with a friend in Oak
Creek Apartments the first two
nights outside the house, and then
moved to Zapata's lounge. He said
the quake would probably limit
his extracurricular activities.
"I might have to quit my job
. . . as a computer consultant for
the Business School. Of course, I
might not have a choice if the
building doesn't reopen." Also, he
might have to forgo the rugby
team, if he needs extra time to
catch up in classes.
"We should not have had classes
until Monday," he said. "Every
body else has been working their
butts off. It'll be hard to be gauged
fairly against them." When pro
fessors grade upcoming tests on
a curve, he said, the students who
have been refugees will score at
the lower end, and those who ha

ven't been inconvenienced will be
at the high end.
He's not bitter, though. "[Non
refugees] are being nice and
friendly. It's tough for them to
understand. I'm sure I'd be the
same way," Russel said.
Buddy system
Heather Magstadt, a senior, was
displaced from Haus Mitteleuropa
until Friday. She said she imme
diately returned to her house from
the Quad after the quake. "I as
sumed we'd go back in and go
back to our normal lives."
Instead, .they were only allowed
in to grab a blanket and a pillow.
"We used the buddy system (to
go back in). Each of us had to go
up with someone whose room was
next to ours." They then spent
Tuesday night in the field across
from Durand House.
After that, she moved in with
a friend from Roble. "Roble seems
to be the safest," she said.
Magstadt has been trying to get
her schoolwork done. "It's not
like, 'Oh, I have a break.' You
want to (concentrate), but it's hard
to concentrate on anything."
She did not, however, feel sorry
for herself. "I'm lucky to have
food," unlike other quake victims,
she said. "I didn't realize how im
portant it was to have a place of
your own."
No towel
"Fifteen seconds and your whole
life changes," said Ann-Elise
Bowers, who along with senior
Jennifer Morrison has been dis
placed from Roth. "I was living
in a single, and to live in a lounge
now is disturbing, especially at a
time when you need a sense of

order in your life," said Bowers.
Morrison has been made aware
of her displacement in unusual
places. "1 went into the shower
and discovered I didn't have a
towel. I had to dry myself with
my karate gear," she said.
Even her normal daily routine
has reminded Bowers of her
predicament. "One of the most
profound things I felt, especially
during at other dorms,
was that I did not belong," she
said. "Walking past Roble at night
and looking into rooms having
parties 1 felt strangely distant,
and that really made me yearn
for my room in Roth again."
Morrison, though, sees the pos
itive aspects of the quake. "I got
to see all my friends," she said.

Jinxed?
Sandi Pak, a junior, has been
displaced twice, first from Roble
two years ago, and now from the
Slavianskii Dom, which wasn't
reopened until today. "Maybe I'm
a jinx," she said before she knew
whether her house would ever be
reopened. "When things start get
ting good . .. boom — you're out
of there."
She, along with the rest of the
house, has been living in Serra
lounge. "I've been here [since
Tuesday 1. If I have to stay any
more than this weekend, I'll get
a hotel or an apartment."
After Roble was closed two
years ago, she spent winter quar
ter in the former computer cluster
in Toyon Hall with five other

girls. "It definitely affected my
schoolwork. ... It was really hard
to get any concentration."
She said the University does
not fully realize their situation.
"We're not just here (being dis
placed); we're here and in school.
If there's a curve, (refugees) who
can't study will be at a disadvan
tage."
Pak said she would have liked
one more day without classes, but
she's not complaining. "I'm not
looking for a pity party. . . .
There's no question we had to
move," she said. "It's just that
from my isolated, selfish view, it
sucks."

Jim Roberts — Dally
Residents of the Beta Theta Pi House camped out on the lawn following the quake. Luckier than
many other students on the Row, they were able to return to their home the next day.
