# Food Service feeds students displaced by quake
## 
### Jill Daniels Staff writer 
Although a substantial portion
of the Stanford community is
without housing, students will not
go hungry.
According to Lois Ohms, an as
sistant food service manager, on
both Wednesday and Thursday
approximately 1,000 free meals
were* served to students across
campus.
This number dropped slightly
over the weekend, a normal oc
curence since many students eat
out or leave campus on the week
end, Ohms said.
"We had an emergency meeting
Wednesday morning with all the

managers of the food facilities,
and the managers ordered extra
food," Ohms said.
Frozen goods and fresh produce
from San Jose arrived later that
afternoon with more shipments
coming the following morning,
Ohms added.
"Every day more food is coming
in so we'll be quite well off,"
Ohms said.
She added that food service will
keep supplying displaced students
with free food until they receive
housing, at which time they will
be able to adopt the meal plan
offered in their residence.
The money for the extra food
is coming out of an "extra reserve
fund" that food and housing serv

ices have built up over the years
to provide for unexpected events
like the earthquake, Ohms said.
Some off-campus students and
students without meal plans took
advantage of the lenient policy de
signed to provide free food for
those who lost their housing by
going to the dining halls and par
taking of the University's cuisine.
This was a problem the first
day, but afterward, most students
didn't come back, said Virginia
Varkony, manager of Stern food
service.
Stern dining hall normally
serves 600 students. The first day
after the earthquake it served
900, and about 700 the second
day, Varkony said.

The day after the earthquake,
"everyone was upset so we didn't
worry about it," Varkony said.
Over the weekend, however,
student tickets were distributed
to serve as a "control method,"
preventing off-campus students
and those without meal plans
from coming over and eating,
Ohms said.
A complete roster of all student
houses that were shut down and
all students that were displaced
was made up. Based off the list,
tickets were distributed to stu
dents who were left homeless due
to the earthquake.
The tickets list the student's
name and original housing assign
ment.
