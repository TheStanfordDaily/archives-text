# Lofts come through calamity largely unscathed

Some Stanford students have
rooms that usually look like a nat
ural disaster hit them. But
judging from their lofts, you'd
never know their rooms had just
experienced a 7.0 earthquake.
Most lofts seem to have
withstood the earthquake fairly
well and have earned the trust of
their owners.
The lofts presented two poten
tial earthquake-related dangers to
their owners. During a large
enough quake, either students'
lofts could collapse underneath
them, or students could fall off
their lofts.

Those inside their rooms during
the quake watched as their lofts
stayed intact. Some, like sopho
more Roman Roszkewycz, tested
the durability of their lofts
firsthand.
Roszkewycz was sitting on top
of his loft Tuesday afternoon
when the earthquake hit. "At
first, I thought that one of the
legs of the loft had fallen off,"
Roszkewycz said. "But the win
dows were rattling, and my lamp
fell over, so I recognized it was a
quake."
The loft was swinging about
five inches in either direction,
along with the walls of his room,
according to Roszkewycz. He tried
to get off the loft, but to no avail.

"So I leaned a little bit and
started surfing with the loft,"
Roszkewycz said.
Sophomore Shari Epstein said
that because her loft is attached
to her wardrobe, only a big quake
could knock it down. However,
Epstein said she is sleeping on
the mattress underneath her loft,
"I'll probably move back up in
a little while, but it seems like I
might as well stay down and be
careful," she added.
Many have slept comfortably
through the aftershocks so far and
expect to continue to do so. The
possibility of a large aftershock
does not seem to trouble many
loft owners.
"The danger of a after

shock seems to be out of the way.
It's been more than 72 hours. You
can't be paranoid about it," said
sophomore Andrea Koerselman.
Cowell Cluster and Row lofts
came under scrutiny this year,
seen as possibly dangerous in the
event of a fire, and some built-in
lofts may be torn down this sum
mer. The University has also
strengthened regulations about
the size and construction of
student-built lofts.
However, Director of Housing
and Food Services Keith Guy said
there were "not really any con
cerns about lofts falling" in the
event of an earthquake. "It was
a fire-related issue more than
anything else," he said.
