# Parents were 'frantic' until the phone rang

Tuesday's earthquake left
many Stanford parents ap
prehensive about the safety of
their children on campus.
For many parents, the dif
ficultly in getting through to
their kids on the phone added
to their general anxiety. Fortu
nately, outgoing calls were
somewhat easier to make, and
students were able to call and
reassure their families.
"My parents were pretty
frantic," said Rana Bhadury, a
displaced junior. His parents
live in Bombay, India and they
saw the worst scenes of the
earthquake. "The news sensa
tionalized everything," he said.
Parents Weekend, originally
scheduled for Oct. 20-22, was
canceled due to the earth
quake. It will not be res
cheduled this year, according
to Patricia Boesch, director of
communication and events at
the Development Office. "We
called a lot of parents [to tell
them of the but
their children had already
called them," she said.
Some parents came to
campus this weekend anyway.
Bernard and Norma Rosen
came from Long Island, N.Y.,
to spend the weekend with
their daughter Candace, a
freshman.

"We had discussed
earthquakes before Candace
came over," Mrs. Rosen said,
"but we never expected an
earthquake to hit this soon
after she started school."
Timothy Pinkston, graduate
student in electrical engineer
ing, said his mother told him
to "buckle down, study hard
and get out of there."
Evandro Nacul, a graduate
student in petroleum engineer
ing from Brazil, said his par
ents wanted him to finish his
doctorate soon. "They were
only getting bad news from the
press in Brazil," he said. The
newspapers depicted the Bay
Area as being totally destroyed,
Nacul said.
But Stanford parents were
not the only ones who were
apprehensive; students from
Stanford who are participating
in overseas programs were also
worried. "We received a mes
sage from our students in
Tours, France, through
electronic mail," said Piopr
Pawlikowski, student services
assistant at the Overseas
Studies Program.
The message read, "You
probably can't imagine how in
tensely we have all been
thinking of you ever since we
heard the news of the
catastrophe."
