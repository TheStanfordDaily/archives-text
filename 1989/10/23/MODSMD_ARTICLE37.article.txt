# Though art wasn't damaged, Museum may be closed for 2 years
## Sections of Green, several other libraries need major repairs in order to reopen 
### Jeff Brock 
Tuesday's earthquake jolted
many libraries and special collec
tions on campus, spilling at least
600,000 books and severely
damaging the Stanford Art
Museum.
However, a massive volunteer
effort Thursday and Friday has
put most books back on the
shelves, and all but a few libraries
are open for business today.
"The museum is one of the bad
ones on campus," said Museum
Administrator Marty Drickey.
While there was virtually no
damage to the museum's perma
nent collection of art, the building
suffered major structural damage.
"It's not safe in here ... we
don't know what's going to hap

pen," Drickey said. The building
is now closed indefinitely, and one
extreme estimate places the
museum's closure at two years,
Drickey said.
After the earthquake, the
galleries were emptied and the
artwork was placed in storage.
Drickey, along with the rest of
the staff, will operate out of a
small room in the basement.
The two rotundas in the back
of the building were hardest hit,
she said, noting the walls were
filled with enormous cracks, and
many columns displayed a new
tilt. The parapets gracing the roof
are loose and will be lifted off by
crane, Drickey said.
The Rodin Sculpture Garden
miraculously survived intact ex
cept for "one piece of plaster that

was chipped off one sculpture's
toe," Drickey said. However, a
temporary exhibition of Jose Ver
meersch ceramic sculptures in the
Stanford Art Gallery "suffered
considerable damage'' and many
sculptures were pulverized, she
said.
About 100,000 bookß fell off the
shelves at Meyer Library, but the
library is now open during its reg
ular hours. Though all the books
have been reshelved, many may
be out of order, according to
Susan Perry, director of the libra
ry. . .
Meyer sustained ceiling, furni
ture and window damage, and
some parts of the library are cor
doned off. The reserve collection
is back in order, and the computer
cluster, language lab and audio
visual holdings are also accessible.
"Unless they find some damage
we don't know about, we're back
in business," Perry said.
The Food Research Institute Li
brary was one of the hardest-hit
libraries on campus, according to
librarian Charles Milford.
On the first floor and basement,
many metal stacks "collapsed,
buckled, twisted, and gave way,"
he said. In the stacks that are
still standing, "the books are car
rying the weight," he said, adding
that some of the shelving is no
longer usable and must be
replaced.
The repairs might be finished
by the end of the week, but "the
library won't have total recovery
for several months," he said. No
one but staff may enter the
damaged areas, but staff members
are prepared to receive requests
and reserves by phone, Milford
said.
In Green Library, the west wing
and Special Collections suffered
some damage, said Maxine
Reneker, director of instructional
and research services at Stanford
Libraries.
However, the recently com
pleted stack bracing project in
Green stacks prevented more
serious damage.
"We're still trying to determine
what all the damages were," she
said. Some internal walls cracked,
Reneker said. Green Special Col
lections, including the Archives
and the Jonsson Library of Gov
ernment Documents, is closed
"and won't be available for some
time." she said.
In line with other damage in

Water from an over
head lab leaked
through the roof and
soaked a pile of maps
scattered by the
earthquake. The
maps were hand
dried with hair dryers
and a lot of love and
care,' Baltierra said.

the Graduate School of Business,
the Jackson Library was in
shambles. A number of stacks col
lapsed entirely while others seem
to be in decent shape.
The Branner Earth Science Li
brary came through remarkably
well, said Operations Manager
John Baltierra. Though 15 percent
of the floor is inaccessible and
some metal stacks were damaged,
the greatest worry centered upon
the huge map collection, he said.
Water from an overhead lab
leaked through the roof and
soaked a pile of maps scattered
by the earthquake. "The maps
were hand-dried with hair dryers
and a lot of love and care," Bal
tierra said. Out of 40,000 maps
in the collection, only two were
lost, he said.
Valerie Su, director of the Lane
Medical Library, said the building
is structurally safe but "most of
the stacks are at an angle." The
main floor stacks and journals are
inaccessible, and reserves are on
limited access as well, Su said.
The Hoover Library and Ar
chives "came through remarkably
well," said Charles Palm, associ
ate director for libraries and ar
chives at the Hoover Institution.
Some books fell on the floor but
there was no damage, he said,
adding that the Hoover Tower li
brary, the East Asia collection and
the Archives should be open by
today.
Libraries that remain closed to
the public today include the west
wing of Green (including Special
Collections, University Archives
and the Jonsson Library of Gov
ernment Documents), the Food
Research Institute library, the
Jackson Business Library and
Stanford Auxiliary Library.
