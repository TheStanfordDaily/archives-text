# Students coping with quake
## Counseling service expects full shock to register soon 
### Jill Daniels Staff writer 
Last Tuesday's earthquake af
fected students in various ways,
but the general response to the
situation was "fairly typical" of
human responses to disasters,
said Doug Daher, acting director
of Counseling and Psychological
Services.
In the days following the
earthquake, CAPS operated a
drop-in center at Tresidder Un
ion to meet an expected increase
in student and staff demand for
counseling. Due to low usage,
however, the service was discon
tinued Friday afternoon.
"We had at most one student
per hour," resident psychiatrist
Flyse Weinstein said.
Common words students used

to describe their emotions were
"angry," "wired" and "ner
vous," said staff psychologist
Alejandro Martinez.
According to Daher, these
emotions will probably become
more pronounced this week.
At first, people respond to a
disaster by becoming very task
oriented, he said. But Martinez
added that after the initial
"numb" feeling disappears, the
secondary reaction may be more
emotional.
Students also have told CAPS
that they are feeling a greater
sensitivity toward their environ
ment, Martinez said.
Students are not taking noises
for granted. For example, if they
hear wind or a noisy ventilator,
they no longer ignore the sound

but stop and figure out what is
causing it.
While students displaced from
their housing are having a more
difficult time, everyone is af
fected, Martinez said.
Dormitories are housing Row
refugees in an "initial good-
Samaritan reaction," but
crowded conditions may soon
annoy the original occupants. Ir
ritability at the inconvenience
of the situation may soon follow,
Martinez said.
This week CAPS will res
chedule its counselors so that
enough staff are on call at
Cowell Student Health Center
to handle the anticipated
demand. CAPS also hopes to
work with resident assistants to
develop a program on trauma
for residents, Daher said.
