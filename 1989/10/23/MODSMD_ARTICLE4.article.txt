# Asbestos risk increases on campus
## Tile damage in at least 3 buildings causes potential danger 
### Ed Palattella Staff writer 
Asbestos, a common building
material that is safe only when
undisturbed, was shaken to life
in several campus buildings dur
ing Tuesday's temblor.
Of the 46 buildings either closed
or restricted because of the quake,
several were labeled asbestos
hazards by inspection crews:
• Bldg. 370 — Values, Technol
ogy, Science and Society: Numer
ous asbestos-lined tiles crashed to
the floor, possibly releasing the
substance into the air.
• Encina Hall, East Wing: The
third and fourth floors were
sealed off because of possible as
bestos release due to cracked tiles
and ruptured insulation.
• Hulme Building, Escondido
Village: One apartment, 88, was
evacuated. The entire floor was
tested for asbestos Saturday, and
all but 8B were termed safe.
• The 15 closed and restricted
Row houses also could be threat

ened by asbestos. The houses were
to be tested Sunday or today, ac
cording to Suzanne Tamiesie,
manager of student housing.
• The Lou Henry Hoover Build
ing and Hoover Tower, which
were closed on Wednesday be
cause of possible asbestos
hazards, were opened late Friday.
The asbestos damage to both
buildings was limited, and the
fibers have been removed, accord
ing to Clifford Bramlett, Univer
sity health and safety specialist
for asbestos.
Charles Palm, associate director
of the Hoover Institution, said he
took a complete tour of the Lou
Henry Hoover Building and found
that a small number of ceiling
tiles had fallen to the ground. Ac
cording to the University health
and safety department, the tiles
did not contain asbestos, Palm
said.
Asbestos is a fibrous mineral
that has been used extensively in
construction and other industries.
Asbestos fibers are strong,

flexible, fireproof and chemically
inert. They are easily woven and
compressed and are often used for
insulation and fire protection.
But the fine, needle-like as
bestos fibers are also indestructi
ble when inhaled or swallowed.
Once they become imbedded into
tissue, the fibers can cause lung
cancer, asbestosis and mesot
helioma — cancer of the lung,
chest or abdominal cavities.
Asbestos does not create a
health hazard unless the fibers
become airborne and are inhaled.
According to a May 1989 Uni
versity report on asbestos removal
from the Press Building, asbestos
containing materials "are present
in nearly all but the most recently
constructed buildings on
campus."
Inspection crews on Wednesday
used two methods to detect and
remove threats of asbestos, Bram
lett said.
In all buildings, workers first
