# Classes resume around the Bay
## 
### Amy Arends Staff writer 
While Stanford students join
many others in returning to class
today, some college students
around the Bay Area will get yet
another day of "Earthquake
Break."
Classes will resume tomorrow
at San Jose State University, ac
cording to Shelby Grad, editor in
chief of the Spartan Daily News
paper.
"The main rationale for closing
campus was for safety checks, and
also so that faculty members
could prepare and pull it to
gether," Grad said.
There was one staff member
slightly injured and $1 million to
$'2 million in damage to the main
library on campus, he said. West
Hall, a 12-story dormitory, was
the only residence evacu
ated Tuesday night, Grad added.
UC-Santa Cruz, located near
the epicenter, will resume class

today after being off since Wed
nesday. According to City on the
Hill, Santa Cruz's newspaper, 400
people were homeless in Santa
Cruz — 100 of whom were UC-
Santa Cruz students. Sophomore
Dorothy Garbutt said the break
has been "negative time. It's been
time to think about what's hap
pened. I didn't want this time,"
she said.
"On campus, you'd think there
was nothing really wrong, but in
town, streets are closed off and
buildings are boarded up," Gar
butt continued. "I feel very
secluded on campus because
there's no structural damage."
At UC-Berkeley, classes have
continued as scheduled since Wed
nesday. Patricia Jacobus,
assistant managing editor of the
Daily Californian, said the
campus "sustained hardly any
damage." Only six buildings were
closed on campus Wednesday and
only one, Building E of the An
nahead Complex, an auditorium.

was closed this weekend.
Berkeley sophomore John
Huang said, "There was no real
damage to the university anjJ,
therefore, no reason to cancel
class, although it was probably a
pain for commuters."
Mary Lane, a sophomore at
Mills College in Oakland and fea
tures editor of the Mills Weekly,
said one of the reasons Mills re
mained open on Wednesday was
because "it's so small. There are
very few buildings to be checked
out compared to Stanford." Mills,
a women's college, has about 1,500
students.
According to Lane, there were
no evacuations. Mills Hall, the
school's century-old administra
tive building, was affected the
most.
"There were cracks, loose
stucco and some shifting, but no
mtyor damage," she said. "That
building was already in need of
renovation. Hopefully, it will be a
high priority now."
