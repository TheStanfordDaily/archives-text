# Quake won't stop applicants
## 
### Gene Anaya Senior staff writer 
Although Undergraduate Ad
missions officials are concerned
that last Tuesday's earthquake
may reduce the number of ap
plicants to Stanford this fall,
several high schools around the
nation report that their students
have not been deterred from ap
plying.
Asked what effect the quake
would have on applications,
Dean of Undergraduate Admis
sions Jean Fetter said, "That's
one I can't answer."
Fetter said she did not know
what effect the state's last mjyor
earthquake — in San Fernando
in 1971 — had on applications
to Southern California schools.
An admissions officer at the
University of Southern Califor
nia said she did not know
whether there was any effect.
A spokesperson for the
Registrar's Office said Friday
she knew of no students who
planned to withdraw from the
University because of the earth
quake.

While Fetter was cautious in
assessing the degree to which
last week's quake will affect
Stanford admissions, she said
that for her office, "it's business
as usual."
Fetter's office is carrying on
with its rigorous fall touring
schedule, hoping to visit 700 to
800 high schools over the next
few months.
A primary concern for admis
sions representatives visiting
these schools is to reassure the
students that Stanford fared
well in the earthquake and that
student safety is a significant
concern for Stanford. They hope
the fact that there were no
serious injuries on campus will
be reassuring.
Last week, admissions staff
on the road visiting schools re
ported good turnouts in their
information sessions even after
the quake. Students expressed
concern about its effects on
Stanford, but they also ex
pressed continued interest in
applying here, Fetter said.
According to Frank Keith, di
rector of college placement at

Robert Lewis Stevenson School
in Pebble Beach, Calif., students
are "just as eager as ever" to
attend Stanford.
Several other directors of col
lege placement from schools in
Texas, Michigan and Alaska ex
pressed the same optimistic
views about their students' in
terest in applying to Stanford.
However, they did report that
several students had postponed
plans to visit the campus.
Because about one-third of
Stanford's applicants are from
California — where earthquakes
are a part of life — Fetter does
not expect any noticeable
decline in applicants from this
pool.
However, the admissions of
fice is expecting a slight decline
in the number of applicants this
year compared with last year's
number, though not necessarily
because of the earthquake.
Colleges across the nation are
experiencing a slight decline in
the number of applicants, which
is expected to continue until
1993 or 1994.
