If you saw the administrators
of the Graduate School of Busi
ness conducting their affairs from
lawn chairs outside their severely
earthquake-damaged building
Thursday and thought the school
would be closed for a while, you're
in for a surprise.
Much of the building will reopen
for normal use this week.
Upon initial examination, in
spectors noticed several severe
cracks in the load-bearing walls
and sealed off the building for
further investigation. Assoc. Dean
for Administration of the Busi
ness School Paul Johnson said de
spite the look of the cracks, "The
experts tell us the building will
withstand another quake of equal
or greater magnitude."
After three inspections, it was
determined that the thick con
crete walls of the classrooms and
subbasement are very strong.
Classes will resume in only this
part of the building today.
Johnson said the top three
floors, however, have been closed
off and will remain so for a num
ber of weeks because of large
cracks and exposed asbestos.

'The experts tell us
the building will
withstand another
quake of equal or
greater magnitude.'

Chuck Sizemore, assistant dean
for external relations of the Busi
ness School, was told by inspectors
that the building can be fixed by
a process of injecting large
amounts of epoxy, a special type
of glue, into the cement cracks to
seal and strengthen them.
"They assure me that it will be
better than the original wall," he
added. The repair process is ex
pected to take about six weeks.
The third floor will remain
closed until the asbestos, exposed
when parts of the ceilings broke
open during Tuesday's quake, can
be removed. This area was sealed
off immediately, Johnson said,
and any people in the building
would have experienced only
"extremely minimal exposure" to
the fibers because of the non
recirculating air conditioning sys
tem.

Although the concrete and steel
building is only a little more than
20 years old, building manager
Barb Taddeo attributed the ex
tensive damage to the fact that it
was built according to lenient
earthquake regulations in effect
in 1966.
She added that the school's
newest addition, the Littlefield
Building, which was dedicated last
October and built to much more
stringent earthquake standards,
had many more seismic bracings
than the old building and there
fore suffered little damage.
Taddeo said the old building
was not rebuilt to satisfy the
newer regulations because it was
not found to be "as unsafe as
Roble or Lou Henry Hoover
House," both of which were closed
last year for seismic improve
ments.
Other damage included a rup
tured pipe, which damaged books
strewn across the floor of the li
brary.
Sizemore said the repairs will
probably be made by the San
Francisco engineering firm of
Rutherford & Chekene, the same
firm that built the Littlefield
Building.
