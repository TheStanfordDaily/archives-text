# Unreinforced buildings in Quad suffer most severe damage
## 
### Jason Bloomstein Senior staff writer 
University officials were not sur
prised that four buildings in the Quad
were severely damaged in Tuesday's
earthquake.
Since the 19505, the University has
slowly and simultaneously double
decked and seismically braced most
Quad buildings. The process converts
one story with a high ceiling into two
stories, creating second-floor windows
which are at ankle level.
Since the completion of History Cor
ner's renovation in 1980, four aca
demic buildings remain undecked and
unstabilized: Geology and Engineering
Corners in the rear of the Quad and
buildings 30 and 80 in the Inner Quad.
All four were severely damaged in the
earthquake and are closed.
A year and a half ago, a seismic
study performed by the University
identified Geology and Engineering
Corners as in severe need of
reinforcement. The study group rec
ommended that money for improv
ments be spread evenly among
different buildings, according to Gene
Kershner, asssociate director of facil
ities project management.
Roble Hall, which rode through the
earthquake virtually unscathed, was
the first building improved after the
study, followed by Lou Henry Hoover
House, the president's residence. Ge
ology and Engineering Corners were
next on the list for reinforcement.
The policy of spreading available
funds evenly among various buildings
"is still a sound one," Kershner said.
The University plans to go ahead with
strengthening the damaged Quad
buildings, but will have to mesh the
improvements with repair work, he
said.
The Engineering Corner now houses
foreign language departments. Build

ing 30 contains the departments of
African and Afro-American Studies,
Comparative Literature and Modern
Thought and Literature; Building 80
houses Human Biology.
Memorial Church also suffered
major structural damage in the earth
quake and is also closed indefinitely.
Building 1 suffered some damage and
has limited-access status.
The rest of the Quad withstood the
quake well, Kershner said.
Stones in a few of the Quad's arches
were jarred loose, but Kershner said
repair will involve pushing the stones
back into place and solidifying them
with mortar. Otherwise, most of the
Quad "came through beautifully," he
said.
The Quad did not suffer any addi
tional damage as a result of an after
shock Saturday that measured 4.7 on
the Richter scale, according to the Uni
versity Work Office.
Kershner said no estimates have
been made as to the cost of repairs in
the Quad and as to the reopening date
of the damaged buildings. Estimates
of total damage to the University have
reached $160 million.
The five closed buildings in the
Quad have been "put in a holding pat
tern," Kershner said, until a thorough
check of less damaged buildings has
been made to assure the safety of the
occupants.
"The process of inspecting the un
safe buildings is just getting started,"
he said.
Kershner said Geology Corner was
probably the hardest-hit building on
campus. There was no damage to the
exterior, and damage to the interior
was "not dramatic." Several ceiling
systems — the joint between ceiling
and wall — were cracked, light fixtures
fell and debris littered the floor.
School of Earth Sciences Dean Gary
Ernst said Friday he was not sure of

neering Corners as in

the extent of the damage to Geology
Corner, but acknowledged two pos
sibilites for the building's future. If
damage is superficial, he said the
building may be opened within the
next three months.
However, if the structure of the
building is "severely compromised,
that is, if it is a bunch of blocks waiting
for a truck to drive by," the building
may be inaccessible for two to three
years, he said.
If such is the case, in order to
preserve the exterior of the 80-year-old
building, the interior must be gutted,
rebuilt and attached to the facade, he
said.
In the meantime, geology faculty and
graduate students plan to move their
offices to the Mitchell Earth Sciences
Building as well as to the Salvatori
and Noble buildings, both of which
are scheduled for demolition next year
to make way for new science buildings
in the Near West campus.
Kershner said delays in the comple
tion of Near West geology buildings
created difficulties in relocating Geol
ogy Department staff and have slowed
the planned improvements to Geology
Corner. However, had the Near West
buildings been completed on time, the
Geology Corner still would not have
been stabilized in time for the earth
quake, he said.
Damage to Memorial Church was
most prominent in the building's huge
dome. The keystones in all four of the

main arches were obviously displaced,
according to Robert Gregg, dean of
the chapel. Mosaics, plaster and
skylights crashed to the floor, splin
tering into thousands of pieces and
crushing rows of pews.
One of the four angels circling the
dome lost one of its wings and is in
danger of losing the other, said Joyce
Cook, assistant to Gregg, and a few
large cracks have compromised the
structural integrity of the dome itself.
The church is closed indefinitely,
Gregg said, and he has not received
word as to when it will reopen. In the
meantime, church services moved yes
terday and this Sunday to Dinkelspiel
Auditorium.
Gregg said Memorial Church may
be repaired later than other buildings
because it is not used as often as the
damaged academic buildings in the
Quad.
Many of Memorial Church's stained
glass windows cracked under the pres
sure of the quake, according to Halle
Fassett, a private contractor who has
been improving the windows for the
past two years.
Thin lines of daylight peek through
the top otaoe window in the rear of
the church, Fassett said, signaling that
the window, like many others, buckled
under its own weight.
He said repair to the windows, most
of which have not been touched since
the last earthquake in 1906, is
urgent. "Sooner or later, if nothing is
done, we are going to start losing some
of these windows," he said.
Gregg said the loss of the church
will disrupt several activites that occur
there regularly. Weekly services and
many of the annual 200 weddings in
Memorial Church will have to be re
located, he said. The two weddings
scheduled for last weekend were moved
to the Faculty Club and to the Stan
ford Park Hotel in Menlo Park.

urgent. "Sooner or later, if nothing is
done, we are going to start losing some
of these windows," he said.
Gregg said the loss of the church
will disrupt several activites that occur
there regularly. Weekly services and
many of the annual 200 weddings in
Memorial Church will have to be re
located, he said. The two weddings
scheduled for last weekend were moved
to the Faculty Club and to the Stan
ford Park Hotel in Menlo Park.
University officials were not sur
prised that four buildings in the Quad
were severely damaged in Tuesday's
earthquake.
Since the 19505, the University has
slowly and simultaneously double
decked and seismically braced most
Quad buildings. The process converts
one story with a high ceiling into two
stories, creating second-floor windows
which are at ankle level.
Since the completion of History Cor
ner's renovation in 1980, four aca
demic buildings remain undecked and
unstabilized: Geology and Engineering
Corners in the rear of the Quad and
buildings 30 and 80 in the Inner Quad.
All four were severely damaged in the
earthquake and are closed.
A year and a half ago, a seismic
study performed by the University
identified Geology and Engineering
Corners as in severe need of
reinforcement. The study group rec
ommended that money for improv
ments be spread evenly among
different buildings, according to Gene
Kershner, asssociate director of facil
ities project management.
Roble Hall, which rode through the
earthquake virtually unscathed, was
the first building improved after the
study, followed by Lou Henry Hoover
House, the president's residence. Ge
ology and Engineering Corners were
next on the list for reinforcement.
The policy of spreading available
funds evenly among various buildings
"is still a sound one," Kershner said.
The University plans to go ahead with
strengthening the damaged Quad
buildings, but will have to mesh the
improvements with repair work, he
said.
The Engineering Corner now houses
foreign language departments. Build

ing 30 contains the departments of
African and Afro-American Studies,
Comparative Literature and Modern
Thought and Literature; Building 80
houses Human Biology.
Memorial Church also suffered
major structural damage in the earth
quake and is also closed indefinitely.
Building 1 suffered some damage and
has limited-access status.
The rest of the Quad withstood the
quake well, Kershner said.
Stones in a few of the Quad's arches
were jarred loose, but Kershner said
repair will involve pushing the stones
back into place and solidifying them
with mortar. Otherwise, most of the
Quad "came through beautifully," he
said.
The Quad did not suffer any addi
tional damage as a result of an after
shock Saturday that measured 4.7 on
the Richter scale, according to the Uni
versity Work Office.
Kershner said no estimates have
been made as to the cost of repairs in
the Quad and as to the reopening date
of the damaged buildings. Estimates
of total damage to the University have
reached $160 million.
The five closed buildings in the
Quad have been "put in a holding pat
tern," Kershner said, until a thorough
check of less damaged buildings has
been made to assure the safety of the
occupants.
"The process of inspecting the un
safe buildings is just getting started,"
he said.
Kershner said Geology Corner was
probably the hardest-hit building on
campus. There was no damage to the
exterior, and damage to the interior
was "not dramatic." Several ceiling
systems — the joint between ceiling
and wall — were cracked, light fixtures
fell and debris littered the floor.
School of Earth Sciences Dean Gary
Ernst said Friday he was not sure of

neering Corners as in

the extent of the damage to Geology
Corner, but acknowledged two pos
sibilites for the building's future. If
damage is superficial, he said the
building may be opened within the
next three months.
However, if the structure of the
building is "severely compromised,
that is, if it is a bunch of blocks waiting
for a truck to drive by," the building
may be inaccessible for two to three
years, he said.
If such is the case, in order to
preserve the exterior of the 80-year-old
building, the interior must be gutted,
rebuilt and attached to the facade, he
said.
In the meantime, geology faculty and
graduate students plan to move their
offices to the Mitchell Earth Sciences
Building as well as to the Salvatori
and Noble buildings, both of which
are scheduled for demolition next year
to make way for new science buildings
in the Near West campus.
Kershner said delays in the comple
tion of Near West geology buildings
created difficulties in relocating Geol
ogy Department staff and have slowed
the planned improvements to Geology
Corner. However, had the Near West
buildings been completed on time, the
Geology Corner still would not have
been stabilized in time for the earth
quake, he said.
Damage to Memorial Church was
most prominent in the building's huge
dome. The keystones in all four of the

main arches were obviously displaced,
according to Robert Gregg, dean of
the chapel. Mosaics, plaster and
skylights crashed to the floor, splin
tering into thousands of pieces and
crushing rows of pews.
One of the four angels circling the
dome lost one of its wings and is in
danger of losing the other, said Joyce
Cook, assistant to Gregg, and a few
large cracks have compromised the
structural integrity of the dome itself.
The church is closed indefinitely,
Gregg said, and he has not received
word as to when it will reopen. In the
meantime, church services moved yes
terday and this Sunday to Dinkelspiel
Auditorium.
Gregg said Memorial Church may
be repaired later than other buildings
because it is not used as often as the
damaged academic buildings in the
Quad.
Many of Memorial Church's stained
glass windows cracked under the pres
sure of the quake, according to Halle
Fassett, a private contractor who has
been improving the windows for the
past two years.
Thin lines of daylight peek through
the top otaoe window in the rear of
the church, Fassett said, signaling that
the window, like many others, buckled
under its own weight.
He said repair to the windows, most
of which have not been touched since
the last earthquake in 1906, is
urgent. "Sooner or later, if nothing is
done, we are going to start losing some
