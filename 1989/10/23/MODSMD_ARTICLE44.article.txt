# Deans, profs, displaced too

Jacqueline Wender organized a serious game
of musical chairs at Stanford last week after
Tuesday's earthquake.
Wender's job was to find adoptive homes for
displaced deans and departments in the hu
manities and sciences whose buildings are
either closed or allow only limited access.
As of Friday, Wender, an assistant dean of
humanities and sciences for facilities, had es
tablished new offices for all of the humanities
and sciences deans and all displaced depart
ments except the French and Italian Depart
ment.
Several faculty and staff in safe buildings
have given up their offices to accommodate
the ousted groups, she said. Three to four
people have moved into each open office.
"We could not ask for more gracious hosts
than communication (Building 120) and psy
chology (Jordan Hall)," Wender said!
Because Building 1, the administration
building, has been declared "limited-access,"
the temporary dean's office for the School of
Humanities and Sciences has been set up in
the Mendenhall Library in Building 120, the
Communication and Sociology Building.
"The office has made some pretty tough
decisions about what we need for essential
business," Wender said, but as of Friday, all
office staff were doing "normal work."
Every division of the dean's office — facil
ities, finance and human resources, for exam
ple — now has a phone and a computer hooked
up to the office's mainframe. Phone numbers
remain the same, and the phones have been
forwarded to the new offices.
