# Meese: There are 'too many laws'
## Ex-attorney general hopes Stanford doesn't limit free speech 
### Robert Pardington Staff writer 
Former U.S. Attorney General
Edwin Meese offered his insight
into the workings of the U.S. Jus
tice Department and his views on
current political issues — includ
ing the Fundamental Standard
debate at Stanford — in a speech
Friday afternoon to a crowd of
200 in Branner Lounge.
Meese, who is affiliated with
both the Hoover Institution and
the Heritage Foundation in Wash
ington, D.C., served as presiden
tial counselor and then as
attorney general in the Reagan
administration.
Discoursing on the law, Meese,
once the highest law enforcement
official in the land, said he
thought that "we have too many
laws today ... we ought to
streamline the laws themselves."
Also, there is a need to make
distinct the difference between
criminal and civil offenses, Meese
said.
In responding to a question
about the hot issue of flag
burning, Meese stated that he
would support a law banning flag
burning. "Speech is an articula
tion of views — I think you don t

speech, someone saying 'That's
stupid, that's wrong.' "
Commenting on tne Justice De
partment, Meese called it the
"world's largest law firm," with
more than 5,000 attorneys. Over
the past several years, Meese said,
the top priority of the department
has been the control of illegal
drugs in the United States.
Fifteen percent of the Depart
ment's budget now goes to com
bating the entry and distribution
of narcotics. Second on the agenda
of the department has been the
prevention of terrorism. The rise
of incidents of international ter
rorism, coupled with the inter
nationalization of <he illicit drug
trade, has made thXoffice of at
torney general far mOre worldly
in scope, Meese said.
"Today the attorney general
goes somewhere outside the coun
try every month or two," Meese
said. "Justice is an international
commodity more so than any time
in history." The office also now
includes a large personal staff and
a great deal of power, compared
to 200 years ago when Edmond
Randolf, the first U.S. Attorney
General had no office, staff or
clerk, and was supposed to carry
on a Drivate Dractice half-time.

have to burn the flag to do that,"
he said.
Meese then clarified his stand
on free speech, saying that he
hopes Stanford does not end up
abridging free speech rights in any
way as a result of the debate over
the Fundamental Standard.
"I cringe when I hear about
possible limitations of free speech
here," Meese said. "The antidote
to (offensive) speech is more
