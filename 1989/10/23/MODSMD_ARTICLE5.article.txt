# Black letter organizations thrive
## Members say groups are about outreach, not mysterious ritual 
### Raoul Mowatt Staff writer 
As Stanford's black fraternities
and sororities prepare to recruit
new pledge classes, they remain
cryptic to many.
But more and more black stu
dents are turning to these letter
organizations for personal growth
and community outreach oppor
tunities.
The recruiting process for a new
line, or pledge class, typically
begins in November. The organi
zation invites potential candidates
to an informational meeting.
There, interested students learn
of the group's history and meet
some of the members.
After reading applications from
interested students, the groups
select a certain number to be "on
line." The size of lines varies from
year to year. Out of the pledges
on line, only those who meet the
organization's challenges will
"cross over" to full membership.
Stanford's three black fraterni

ties are Alpha Phi Alpha, Omega
Psi Phi and Kappa Alpha Psi. The
University's two black sororities
are Alpha Kappa Alpha and Delta
Sigma Theta.
"There are some small differ
ences between the groups, but the
similarities between us are
greater," said junior Bobby
Joseph, a member of Alpha Phi
Alpha.
Volunteerism
Black letter organizations have
a greater focus on community
service than their predominantly
white counterparts, according to
their members. Much of their
volunteerism addresses concerns
in the black community, both on
and off campus.
"As black students who have
been fortunate enough to make it
to Stanford University, (members
of black fraternities and sorori
ties! feel an obligation to give
something back to the community
that we came from," said junior
John Meigs, polemarch, or presi

dent, of Kappa Alpha Psi.
In most black letter organiza
tions, the pledge process is ori
ented around community service.
For instance, Delta Sigma Theta
pledges volunteer to read stories
to children and recruit others to
follow their lead. Similarly,
pledges must perform two com
munity service projects before
their initation into Omega Psi
Phi.
Pledging
Although specific details about
the pledge process are kept secret,
members say its overall purpose
is to teach pledges to become more
self-aware and less self-interested.
"We all lived together, we all
dressed alike [while pledgingl.
People kind of looked at that as
demeaning, and they wondered
why you run around in a line and
do the same thing at the same
time. In reality, one is made to
take others' feelings in consider-
