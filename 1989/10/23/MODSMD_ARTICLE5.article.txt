# Black letter organizations thrive
## Members say groups are about outreach, not mysterious ritual 
### Raoul Mowatt Staff writer 
As Stanford's black fraternities
and sororities prepare to recruit
new pledge classes, they remain
cryptic to many.
But more and more black stu
dents are turning to these letter
organizations for personal growth
and community outreach oppor
tunities.
The recruiting process for a new
line, or pledge class, typically
begins in November. The organi
zation invites potential candidates
to an informational meeting.
There, interested students learn
of the group's history and meet
some of the members.
After reading applications from
interested students, the groups
select a certain number to be "on
line." The size of lines varies from
year to year. Out of the pledges
on line, only those who meet the
organization's challenges will
"cross over" to full membership.
Stanford's three black fraterni

ties are Alpha Phi Alpha, Omega
Psi Phi and Kappa Alpha Psi. The
University's two black sororities
are Alpha Kappa Alpha and Delta
Sigma Theta.
"There are some small differ
ences between the groups, but the
similarities between us are
greater," said junior Bobby
Joseph, a member of Alpha Phi
Alpha.
Volunteerism
Black letter organizations have
a greater focus on community
service than their predominantly
white counterparts, according to
their members. Much of their
volunteerism addresses concerns
in the black community, both on
and off campus.
"As black students who have
been fortunate enough to make it
to Stanford University, (members
of black fraternities and sorori
ties! feel an obligation to give
something back to the community
that we came from," said junior
John Meigs, polemarch, or presi

dent, of Kappa Alpha Psi.
In most black letter organiza
tions, the pledge process is ori
ented around community service.
For instance, Delta Sigma Theta
pledges volunteer to read stories
to children and recruit others to
follow their lead. Similarly,
pledges must perform two com
munity service projects before
their initation into Omega Psi
Phi.
Pledging
Although specific details about
the pledge process are kept secret,
members say its overall purpose
is to teach pledges to become more
self-aware and less self-interested.
"We all lived together, we all
dressed alike [while pledgingl.
People kind of looked at that as
demeaning, and they wondered
why you run around in a line and
do the same thing at the same
time. In reality, one is made to
take others' feelings in consider-
ation," said sophomore Brian
Hooker, a member of Omega Psi
Phi.
Many in the Stanford commu
nity seem unaware of the black
letter system's emphasis on public
service. Members say that some
students view the black fraterni
ties and sororities as mysterious
and militant.
. "Being in a frat is supposed to
get you involved with the rest of
campus, but that doesn't seem to
be the case with the black frats,"
said a white fraternity member
who asked not to be identified.
To others, black fraternities and
sororities are primarily social or
ganizations. Black fraternity and
sorority parties, or "sets," differ
from most Stanford parties be
cause they are alcohol-free.
"At our parties, the focus is the
music and the social interaction.
We see all the problems white fra
ternities are having with alcohol,
and that's a burden we don't need
to handle," Meigs said.
Identity
Many in the black community
feel black letter organizations pro
vide a stronger sense of belonging
and identity than most predom
inantly white organizations on
campus.
"At Stanford, a lot of friend
ships are only on the surface. I
do have many diehard friends out
side the frat, but my three line
brothers [members of his pledge
class] are the three brothers I

never had," said junior Richard
Gubanks, a Omega Psi Phi mem
ber.
Pledges in black letter organi
zations must perform numerous
confidential tasks in addition to
their studies, thus growing closer
while gaining confidence in their
problem-solving abilities. More
over, members bring those stress
management skills from their
pledge days into the real world,
Gray said.
Most black letter organizations
were founded to provide support
for black students at predom
inantly white schools. The groups
swiftly grew in number, attracting
students because of sharp African
influences on their rituals and
dances.
The organizations have histor
ically produced black leaders, said
senior Cheryl Gray, president of
Delta Sigma Theta. For example,
the Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr.
was a member of Alpha Phi Alpha.
Black fraternities and sororities
form an array of contacts, Meigs
said, adding that many members
become more active as alums than
as undergraduates.
"Blaok frats are needed even
more now than in earlier years
because of the networking they
allow," Meigs said.
Despite the success of their
members, black letter organiza
tions should be viewed neither as
divisive nor as elitist, Gray said.
"It's just one of the avenues
black people can take to address
some of the problems we face,"
Gray said.
Some black fraternity and
sorority members feel that the
strong service component is one

'We all lived together, we all dressed alike
[while pledging]. People kind of looked at that
as demeaning, and they wondered why you
run around in a line and do the same thing at
the same time. In reality, one is made to take
other's feelings in consideration.'

of the system's most attractive as
sets.
"On a college campus, it's easy
to get caught up in your studies.
It's easier to do community serv
ice if you're in a group that
focuses on that," said junior
Shairi Turner, Delta Sigma Theta
secretary.
Wearing distinctive colors and
outfits helps members bond to
gether and improve their service
to the community, Turner added.
Letter organization members
have been extremely active assis
tants, said Jeanne Cuffey Tatum
of the Youth Development Center.
Among other activities, the
groups have donated equipment
to the center for low-income, high
risk students from East Palo Alto.
"Whenever we've needed stu
dents to do tutoring, run study
groups or provide support for the
center, [black fraternity and
sorority members] were avail
able," Tatum said. "In fact, one
student called this morning to see
if we had earthquake damage and
offered to help clean up," she
added.
Growing numbers
The success of the black letter

organizations in helping the black
community may be a factor con
tributing to increased interest in
the groups, some members said.
Last year, Alpha Phi Alpha held
two lines instead of only one. The
fall line was solely for upperclass
men, while the spring line was
open to all.
As a result, Alpha Phi Alpha is
now the largest black fraternity
at Stanford. It has 18 undergrad
uate meali/eio, a "pretty large
number for a black organization,"
according to Joseph.
Kappa Alpha Psi currently has
15 members, while Omega Psi Phi
has nine.
Recently, about 40 women at
tended an informational meeting
about Delta Sigma Theta, a num
ber that was "unusually high,"
Gray said.
Several racial incidents that oc
curred last year may have also
contributed to the surge in mem
bership and interest. In one inci
dent, a poster advertising a Kappa
Alpha Psi party at Berkeley was
defaced.
"I put that poster up myself,
and that really touched me,"
Meigs said.
