## Lebanese accord reached But Christian leader rejects lawmakers' agreement 
### 
TAIF, Saudi Arabia (AP) — The
Lebanese parliament yesterday
passed a new power-sharing ac
cord to end the country's 14-year
old civil war, but Christian leader
Gen. Michel Aoun rejected the
pact.
"What the deputies approved in
Taif is a crime 1 will not accept,"
Aoun said at a news conference
at the presidential palace in sub
urban Baabda, east of Beirut.
"I have demanded a Syrian
withdrawal from Lebanon, but
they came up with a peace plan
full of ambiguities about this
issue, which constitutes Leb
anon's sovereignty," Aoun said.
He said he could accept the po
litical reforms in the accord,
which would give more power to
the Moslems, but "the deputies
have actually exceeded their juris
diction and constitutional rights
by voting in these ambiguities
that compromise Lebanon's
sovereignty. I reject this plan and
reject the United States approval
of it."
Aoun did not specify what he
meant by U.S. approval.
In Washington, the White
House declined to discuss the

'What the deputies
approved... I will not
accept.'

peace plan. "We're going to with
hold comment until things are
pinned down a little bit more," a
White House official said on con
dition of anonymity.
Aoun heads a Lebanese Chris
tian government competing for
legitimacy with the predominately
Moslem Cabinet headed by Hoss.
The Lebanese parliament met
to consider the peace plan after
Saudi Arabia guaranteed it would
be implemented and Christian
deputies approved it.
The proposal falls short of
Christian demands for a full pul
lout of Syria's 40,000 troops in
Lebanon within three years, but
includes Syrian proposals for at
least a partial withdrawal. It also
guarantees an equal number of
seats for Moslems and Christians
in the Parliament.
The legislators have been in

Taif since Sept. 30 trying to
redefine the division of power be
tween Christians and Moslems in
an effort to end the civil war.
Lebanon has been without a
president since September 1988,
when Amin Gemayel's term ended
and legislators were unable to
decide on a successor.
The plan does not set a date
for a final withdrawal of Syrian
troops from east Lebanon's Bekaa
Valley — a persistent Christian
demand.
Moslems have argued that the
Syrian presence is their only guar
antee political reforms will be
carried out.
Syrian troops were sent into
Lebanon in 1976 under an Arab
League mandate to quell the civil
war.
Aoun said the Syrian troops vi
olated that mandate by siding
with Moslems in the war. He
launched a "war of liberation"
against Syria in March.
More than 900 people were
killed and more than 2,000
wounded in six months of savage
shelling duels that ended with an
Arab League-sponsored cease-fire
Sept. 22.
