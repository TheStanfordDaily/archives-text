RESEARCH PROGRAM EMERGENCY SUPPORT
In discussions with faculty this week following the Tuesday earthquake, I have found that the
research programs have not suffered as much damage as might have been the case. Past efforts in
Health and Safety have paid dividends in reduced spills, reduced equipment damage and in prompt
emergency response steps.
However, there were cases of equipment damage that could delay research for a significant time. This
office will make funds available for emergency repairs to assist with the rebuilding of critical research
efforts that have suffered earthquake damage. Before contacting this office, let me urge you to first
contact your funding agency and request support for emergency repairs. Several funding agencies have
offered to be sympathetic to special requests.
To keep the process for accessing University funds as straightforward and responsive as possible and
yet place priorities on the requests, we suggest that you prepare a short one-page description of the
damage and specific need for funds. Have your department chair sign and forward the request to the
Dean for priority within the school. The Dean's offices are now in the process of assessing the damage
to research programs which should facilitate this step. The request should then be sent to my office to
the attention of Assistant Dean Michele Armstrong, Cypress CI, x 3-1655.
We will work with you and your dean to fund those programs that have priority. Our assumption is
that first priority should be given to emergency funds that by timely repair of laboratory equipment
will assist graduate students and postdoctoral scholars to continue or complete critical research
programs.
