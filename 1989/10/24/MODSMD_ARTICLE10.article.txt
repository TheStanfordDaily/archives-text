## Secretary of State proposes new arms control initiative 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — Secretary of
State James A. Baker 111 called yesterday
for a new military relationship with the
Soviet Union to sharply reduce the "first
strike" nuclear weapons that could be
devastating in a surprise attack.
Baker, in his first m*\jor arms-control
speech, also urged a reluctant Congress
to approve White House requests for
funds to produce mobile Midgetman mis
siles. Otherwise, he said, the Soviets
could exploit differences between Capitol
Hill and the Bush administration.
"United we stand; divided we fall,"
Baker said in a speech to the private
Commonwealth Club of San Francisco.
Copies were distributed in Washington
by the State Department.
Baker's emphasis on reducing U.S. and
Soviet first-strike weapons, such as So
viet SS-18 intercontinental ballistic mis
siles, signals the strategy the United
States will pursue in trying to conclude
a treaty with the Soviet Union in Geneva.
There, U.S. and Soviet negotiators

began work in the Reagan administration
to cut arsenals of strategic weapons —
ocean-spanning bombers, missiles and
submarines — by 30 percent to 50 per
cent.
Baker, in his speech, encouraged the
Soviets to concentrate their efforts on
defense, as well, while the Bush admin
istration pursues the Strategic Defense
Initiative.
He said in the Geneva negotiations the
United States would explore "a coopera
tive and stable transition to a greater
reliance on stability-enhancing, cost
effective strategic defense."
In fact, Baker said, "we want to see
Soviet defensive military operations made
habitual."
Baker said the U.S. goal was "a new
relationship in which the capabilities and
incentives to attack first are minimized
and the possibilities of strategic defense
are pursued."
Meanwhile, Baker used the speech to
publicly prod Congress to drop its objec

tions to the Midgetman, which is designed
as a safeguard against a Soviet first-strike
because of its mobility.
"We will need to rely upon the deploy
ment of mobile missiles as a key compo
nent of our nuclear modernization pro
gram," Baker said.
Referring to the negotiations in
Geneva, Baker added, "Congress needs
now to support START, not undercut it,
by funding this program."
In a foreign policy address yesterday,
Secretary Baker's Soviet counterpart —
Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevard
nadze admitted that the Soviet radar sta
tion in Krasnoyarsk violated the U.S.-
Soviet Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty and
said the installation will be dismantled.
Shevardnadze said it took Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's government four years to de
termine that the station's location in
Siberia violated the treaty, as Western
arms experts have long contended.
As the Soviet Union tried to move for
ward on further arms treaties based on

the ABM pact, "There stood the station,
the size of an Egyptian pyramid, repre
senting, to put it bluntly, a violation of
the ABM treaty," Shevardnadze said.
Shevardnadze also blasted his
predecessors' decision to send troops into
Afghanistan, saying the move involved
"gross violations of our own laws, intra
party and civil norms and ethics."
"A decision that had very serious con
sequences for our country was made be
hind the back of the party and the
people," he said.
Shevardnadze, in a strikingly frank
speech before the Soviet legislature, also
said the Kremlin is ready to negotiate
the breakup of the NATO and Warsaw
Pact alliances in Europe.
"We are prepared to head toward the
dissolution of the military-political blocs
in Europe on a mutual basis," he said.
But Shevardnadze maintained that de
spite recent historic changes in the War
saw Pact, the Soviet Union considers "all

our obligations remain in force."
Poland and Hungary in recent months
have moved away from Communist one
party rule, and the Kremlin has made
no move to stop them.
But in fact, he said, "We are saving
the ABM treaty and opening the way to
the conclusion of a treaty on strategic
weapons, and we're gaining the legal and
moral right to demand clarity on the
question of American installations in
Greenland and England which were
modernized, as we understand, in viola
tion of the treaty."
Shevardnadze noted that for the first
time in many years, "Not a single Soviet
soldier is participating — nor, I'm sure,
will participate — in military actions
anywhere in the world."
He said the Soviet Union is prepared
to liquidate all its foreign bases and with
draw its military forces to within its own
territory by the year 2000. It was not
clear what the condition would be for
such a withdrawal.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Secretary of
State James A. Baker 111 called yesterday
for a new military relationship with the
Soviet Union to sharply reduce the "first
strike" nuclear weapons that could be
devastating in a surprise attack.
Baker, in his first m*\jor arms-control
speech, also urged a reluctant Congress
to approve White House requests for
funds to produce mobile Midgetman mis
siles. Otherwise, he said, the Soviets
could exploit differences between Capitol
Hill and the Bush administration.
"United we stand; divided we fall,"
Baker said in a speech to the private
Commonwealth Club of San Francisco.
Copies were distributed in Washington
by the State Department.
Baker's emphasis on reducing U.S. and
Soviet first-strike weapons, such as So
viet SS-18 intercontinental ballistic mis
siles, signals the strategy the United
States will pursue in trying to conclude
a treaty with the Soviet Union in Geneva.
There, U.S. and Soviet negotiators

began work in the Reagan administration
to cut arsenals of strategic weapons —
ocean-spanning bombers, missiles and
submarines — by 30 percent to 50 per
cent.
Baker, in his speech, encouraged the
Soviets to concentrate their efforts on
defense, as well, while the Bush admin
istration pursues the Strategic Defense
Initiative.
He said in the Geneva negotiations the
United States would explore "a coopera
tive and stable transition to a greater
reliance on stability-enhancing, cost
effective strategic defense."
In fact, Baker said, "we want to see
Soviet defensive military operations made
habitual."
Baker said the U.S. goal was "a new
relationship in which the capabilities and
incentives to attack first are minimized
and the possibilities of strategic defense
are pursued."
Meanwhile, Baker used the speech to
publicly prod Congress to drop its objec

tions to the Midgetman, which is designed
as a safeguard against a Soviet first-strike
because of its mobility.
"We will need to rely upon the deploy
ment of mobile missiles as a key compo
nent of our nuclear modernization pro
gram," Baker said.
Referring to the negotiations in
Geneva, Baker added, "Congress needs
now to support START, not undercut it,
by funding this program."
In a foreign policy address yesterday,
Secretary Baker's Soviet counterpart —
Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevard
nadze admitted that the Soviet radar sta
tion in Krasnoyarsk violated the U.S.-
Soviet Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty and
said the installation will be dismantled.
Shevardnadze said it took Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's government four years to de
termine that the station's location in
Siberia violated the treaty, as Western
arms experts have long contended.
As the Soviet Union tried to move for
ward on further arms treaties based on

the ABM pact, "There stood the station,
the size of an Egyptian pyramid, repre
senting, to put it bluntly, a violation of
the ABM treaty," Shevardnadze said.
Shevardnadze also blasted his
predecessors' decision to send troops into
Afghanistan, saying the move involved
"gross violations of our own laws, intra
party and civil norms and ethics."
"A decision that had very serious con
sequences for our country was made be
hind the back of the party and the
people," he said.
Shevardnadze, in a strikingly frank
speech before the Soviet legislature, also
said the Kremlin is ready to negotiate
the breakup of the NATO and Warsaw
Pact alliances in Europe.
"We are prepared to head toward the
dissolution of the military-political blocs
in Europe on a mutual basis," he said.
But Shevardnadze maintained that de
spite recent historic changes in the War
saw Pact, the Soviet Union considers "all

our obligations remain in force."
Poland and Hungary in recent months
have moved away from Communist one
party rule, and the Kremlin has made
no move to stop them.
But in fact, he said, "We are saving
the ABM treaty and opening the way to
the conclusion of a treaty on strategic
weapons, and we're gaining the legal and
moral right to demand clarity on the
question of American installations in
Greenland and England which were
modernized, as we understand, in viola
tion of the treaty."
Shevardnadze noted that for the first
time in many years, "Not a single Soviet
soldier is participating — nor, I'm sure,
will participate — in military actions
anywhere in the world."
He said the Soviet Union is prepared
to liquidate all its foreign bases and with
draw its military forces to within its own
territory by the year 2000. It was not
clear what the condition would be for
such a withdrawal.
