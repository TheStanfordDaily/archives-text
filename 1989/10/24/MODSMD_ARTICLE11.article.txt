TEHRAN, Iran (AP) — President Hashemi Raf
sanjani yesterday offered help in getting Western
hostages freed in Lebanon if the United States
releases billions of dollars in frozen Iranian assets
or helps settle the cases of three kidnapped Iranians.
Rafsanjani said hostage-taking is an "inhuman
action" that can produce no positive political results.
Eighteen Westerners, including Americans, are
believed to be held by pro-Iranian groups in
Lebanon.
While Rafsanjani said his government was main
taining indirect contacts with Washington, his offer
and demands were not new.
Responding to a question from a U.S. reporter,
Rafsanjani said he had proposed "two methods"
that the United States could use to facilitate release
of the hostages:
"The first is that as a sign of goodwill, you release
our assets. This is something that you will have to
do, and sooner or later you will be forced to do it.
So do it now.
"Secondly, if you do not want to give us our
money, at least you can get your agents, your lackeys
in Lebanon to release our hostages. If you say they
are not alive, at least you can give us back their
bodies or show us their graves."
Rafsanjani earlier had argued that the United
States was keeping the issue of the American
hostages in Lebanon alive "mainly as a bridge in
order to approach us and establish relations with
the Islamic Republic of Iran, and this is a mistake."
In addition to the Americans, the hostages are
four Britons, two West Germans, two Swiss, an
Irishman and an Italian. Held longest is American
journalist Terry Anderson, chief Middle East cor
respondent for The Associated Press, who was kid
napped March 16, 1985.
