Dissidents allowed to meet
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa
(AP) — Eight African National Congress
leaders, including seven freed from
prison this month, held a strategy meet
ing yesterday, unhindered by police even
though their movement remains out
lawed.
A statement issued after the meeting
said the men would consult with exiled
officials of the ANC and would address
policy issues Sunday at a mass rally at
a soccer stadium near Johannesburg.
The meeting marked a reunion for
the seven recently released men and a
colleague, Govan Mbeki, who was freed
from prison in 1987.
The other seven were released uncon
ditionally and have spoken out freely on
behalf of their guerrilla movement. They
have endorsed the ANC's use of violence
as part of its campaign to end white
minority domination and have
demanded a series of concessions from
the government as a precondition for
negotiations.
The eight men met with other anti
apartheid leaders for more than three
hours behind closed doors at a commu
nity center in Soweto. They engaged in
"an in-depth exploration of the way for
ward," according to a statement issued
by a coalition of activists.
Lebanese Christians divided
BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) — Lebanese
Christians were split yesterday over
Gen. Michel Aoun's rejection of a plan
to end the civil war and Aoun put his

men on alert in case of renewed fighting
with Syrian troops and their Moslem
allies.
Amal and Hezbollah, the two main
militias of the 1.2 million Shiite Mos
lems, and Druse leader Walid Jumblatt
also rejected the accord. It was approved
Sunday by Lebanese Christian and Mos
lem legislators after three weeks of ne
gotiations in Taif, Saudi Arabia.
Jumblatt is Syria's main Lebanese ally.
Democracy on anniversary
BUDPEST, Hungary (AP) — Hun
gary declared itself a democracy yester
day, 33 years after Soviet troops crushed
an anti-Stalinist uprising, and chants of
"Russians go home!" and "Communism
no more!" rose from a crowd of 100,000.
Hungarian flags of red, white and
green waved over the throng, which
overflowed the Parliament square.
People cheered wildly in the torch-lit
plaza when participants in the uprising
invoked memories of its leaders.
"It took 33 years for those behind the
thick walls to hear the cries" for democ
racy, Jenoe Fonay told the rally, referring
to the recent official change of heart
about the nature of the 12-day revolt
that began Oct. 23, 1956.
The Soviet bloc's bloodiest uprising
was called counterrevolution until early
this year, when the official description
was changed to a popular uprising in
one of the dramatic moves in Hungary's
progress toward democracy.
As many as 32,000 people were killed
in 1956 and about 200,000 fled the coun
try.
