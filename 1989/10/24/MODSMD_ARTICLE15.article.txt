## Learning to cope 
### 
In the wake of
disaster we must try
not to place blame

TRAGEDY PULLS people to
gether, but sometimes those
ties tear soon after the
tragedy is over. Students, faculty
and staff must make sure that does
not happen only one week after
last Tuesday's earthquake.
There is too much work left to
be done on campus.
The University is currently
trying to place more than 300 stu
dents who remain refugees after
Tuesday's quake. Many have been
placed in temporary homes until
the University can determine the
earliest dates that their residences
will reopen.
When that happens, and the Uni
versity has determined the number
of students who will be displaced
for the quarter or even the entire
school year, housing officials will
begin to make living arrangements
for those people.
None of those arrangements will
be ideal, as some singles will in
evitably become doubles, some
houses may add dozens of students,
and some dorms will lose their
study lounges. But students on
both ends must bear with the sit
uation and make sacrifices to make
the rest of the year livable.
The refugees will not enjoy be
coming a "random" roommate in
a triple that was converted from
a double, just as the other two
roommates will not enjoy cutting
their living space down by one
third.
But those students who will feel
a strong temptation to complain
about the situation, should remem
ber that this tragedy was out of

anybody's control. Mother Nature
played her cards and dealt several
Stanford students a bad hand.
At a meeting last Thursday with
University housing officials,
several displaced students placed
criticism on administrators for not
keeping them more up to date on
their housing situation and letting
them have more input into their
placement.
Under the circumstances, the
refugees cannot be blamed for wan
ting answers. But, then again,
under the circumstances, the ad
ministrators are doing the best
they can to determine which build
ings are safe and make sure stu
dents at least have temporary
housing.
It would be irresponsible for the
University to reopen a residence
sooner than it is deemed safe, sim
ply because the students want to
get back into their house. At this
point, all the decision-making
about residences is being done by
a select group of people â€” the
structural engineers.
Administrators should be open
to student input on placement de
cisions for students who lost their
homes. In the case of several Row
houses, a community has also been
lost which the University should
try to accomodate.
It would be impossible to place
all the people from one Row house
into the same temporary housing,
but administrators or students
could set up alternative arrange
ments to maintain the community
that exists in some of the Row
facilities.
Most importantly, students on
campus affected by the quake
should remember how lucky the
Stanford campus fared compared
to San Francisco, Oakland, Santa
Cruz, Watsonville and other areas.
Those communities will need to
cope much longer than Stanford.
