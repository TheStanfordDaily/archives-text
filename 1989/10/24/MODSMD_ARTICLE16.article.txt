Earthquake continues to affect us psychologically

Last Tuesday's 6.9 earthquake
is now part of our lives, an
experience that cannot be erased.
The evidence of its impact is more
evident among those who are injured,
have lost their residences or are with
out their belongings.
The quake's impact is more subtle
among those whose lives are less dis
rupted by the disaster. Each of us will
respond to the experience in our own
way. An initial response is to say, "I'm
0.K.," but there are very few people
who are not having an emotional
reaction to the event.
There are other feelings that may
not seem directly related to the earth
quake, but are very much a part of
our response to its aftermath. These

reactions include:
• Confusion
• Insecurity
• Crying
• Fear
• Sleep disturbance
• Feeling overwhelmed
• Frustration
• Anxiety
• Anger
• Fatigue
• Difficulty returning to normal
activity
• Change in appetite
• Concentration problems
• Irritability
• Grief
• Loss of trust
• Withdrawal

Restoring our sense of capability and
hopefulness is an individual and com
munity process. We offer the following
suggestions to continue it:
• Don't minimize the legitimacy of
your feelings or allow others to do so.
• If the aftermath of the earthquake
is keeping you from getting back to
"life as usual," find out what support
is available for you and what alterna
tives may help in the adjustment.
• Talk about your experience and
your reactions now. Talk to friends,
colleages, resident assistants and others
who can support you.
• Take care of yourself. Have a good
diet, rest and excercise.
• Be aware that for some time every
one is going to be more edgy and more

tense than usual. Ease up on expecta
tion.
• Being prepared for future emergen
cies can lessen feelings of helplessness
and bring peace of mind.
• If you have children, talk to them
about their feelings.
• If you can help in the recovery, do
so. It makes a difference.
• Try to identify what went well in
this crisis, the positive aspects for
yourself and those who are close to
you.
