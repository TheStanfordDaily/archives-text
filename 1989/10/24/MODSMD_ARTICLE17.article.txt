# Band not racist because they play Guns N' Roses
## 
### 
The Daily's accusatory editorial of
0ct.20 ("Band Blunders") is a cheap
shot at the Stanford Band, trying to
cast blame on the group through the
worst sort of guilt-by-association
claims. The editorial was, in short,
stupid and dangerous.
The connection of racist acts to our
performance of "Paradise City" is ex
tremely tenuous. The editorial board
apparently feels we can be faulted for
performing an instrumental version of
a song by a group, Guns N' Roses,
which has made racist statements in
the past.
Will The Daily write a similar edito
rial criticizing ASSU Flicks when they
show a film, "Do The Right Thing,"
which contains music by a group,

Public Enemy, that has made extensive
racist comments in the past (for exam
ple, from a handbill they distributed at
the New Music Seminar this year:
"Whites naturally murder and
cheat. ... White people's hearts are so
cold they can't wait to lie, cheat, and
murder")? You cannot hold a campus
group accountable for such far-removed
racism.
If Guns N' Roses is indeed guilty of
thought-crime, the real accomplices are
the millions of people, including many
Stanford students, who paid anywhere
from $8 to $15 for the tape or com
pact disc.
Racism is a very real problem, but
making barely supportable accusations
in the press will do little to help the
problem. What is needed is for individ
uals to communicate openly, use good
judgment and show genuine compas
sion.
What is not needed is for a group of
self-righteous idiots to lead a paranoid
witch-hunt under the guise of "respon
sible journalism". This campus does
not need The Daily to act as self-

appointed arbiters of racist acts, espe
cially since making an issue of playing
one instrumental song indicates a very
counterproductive hypersensitivity on
the part of The Daily.
