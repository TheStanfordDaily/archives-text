# Flicks is sorry for showing of offensive preview
## 
### 
As project manager of the ASSU
Sunday Flicks, I would like to sincerely
apologize for the short film shown
before the early screening of "Cousins"
on Oct. 22.
The 10-minute version of Alfred
Hitchcock's "Frenzy" was chosen as a
preview for next week's showing of
"Rear Window." This short was edited
from a full-length feature, unfortu-

nately and unexpectedly centering on
an extremely graphic rape scene.
Halfway through the short, it be
came apparant that we had received
the wrong version of the short from
the distributor, and we shut down the
projector. Instead of a 10-minute film,
we received an unbearably brutal 20-
minute version; "Frenzy did not reap
pear at the 9:30 show.
In the future, the shorts will be
more carefully selected and screened so
as to eliminate the offensive-
Once again, I am sorry for any of
fense that was taken and would like to
invite the Stanford community and the
Flicks audience to contribute sugges
tions for future Flicks programming.
