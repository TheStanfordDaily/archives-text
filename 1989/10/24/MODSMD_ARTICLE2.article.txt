### Brad Hayward Editorial staff 
Officials in Undergraduate
Studies and the Registrar's Office
are continuing to offer special
services to students displaced
from their housing who are con
cerned about their academic
workload.
Registrar Sally Mahoney an
nounced yesterday that the dead
line for any student to declare the
pass/no credit option has been ex
tended to Nov. 3. The original
deadline was Oct. 13.
The Committee on Academic
Appraisal and Achievement,
chaired by German Studies Prof.
Orrin Robinson, agreed to change
the deadline "to give students
time to settle from the events of

last Tuesday's earthquake and to
consider how best to handle their
academic obligations," Mahoney
said in a statement.
In addition, Dean of Undergrad
uate Studies Tom Wasow said his
office is doing several things to
help relocated students and others
who are having academic troubles
because of the earthquake and its
aftermath.
First, his office has arranged
for extra academic advisers to be
on hand at the Undergraduate Ad
vising Center this week. The
Graduate Information Week, orig
inally scheduled for this week, has
been canceled, freeing up advisers'
time to meet with individual stu
dents.
Undergraduate Studies is also
arranging for extra tutors to be

available at the Center for Teach
ing and Learning. This office and
the Undergraduate Advising Cen
ter are both located in Sweet Hall.
Wasow and his staff are fielding
student complaints about un
cooperative professors and teach
ing assistants and intervening in
those situations.
"If students feel a professor or
TA has not shown adequate sen
sitivity to academic problems
created by this disruption, they
should call my office," Wasow
said.
Wasow or an assistant will then
call the faculty member involved
or the appropriate department
chair. Wasow said one of his as
sistants has been spending most
