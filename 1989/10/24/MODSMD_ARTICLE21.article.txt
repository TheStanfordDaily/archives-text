## Setting things straight 
### 
YOU'RE SICK OF hearing about the
earthquake. Every meal you rehash
where you were, what you felt and
how long it took to get back in your
room. As a Robleite, my strongest feelings
about the quake are gratitude that the
University had foresight to protect the
best dorm on campus.
However, University President Donald
Kennedy's disaster speech was a little
bewildering. He mentioned that buildings
which were most damaged were known
to be structurally weak. If they were
known to be weak, why wasn't the Uni
versity working to strengthen them? But
maybe we should give the University the
benefit of the doubt.
In fact, Stanford should be lauded for
its foresight. Not just in earthquake pre
vention, but in broad-ranging policies
such as affirmative action.
Although Stanford does not implement
affirmative action in admissions, it does
use a progressive policy which considers
how each individual adds to the commu
nity as a whole. Stanford is far from
perfect, but it has made efforts toward
a diverse, non-discriminatory environ
ment.
Affirmative action is to discrimination
as reinforced tower rooms in Roble are
to earthquakes. Affirmative action
prevents any long-term danger, but
causes minor inconveniences. Unfortu
nately, we can't give the United States
the "benefit of the doubt" in dealing with
discrimination.
Many recent Supreme Court rulings
show how obnoxious our policy is becom
ing. Since Wards Cove v. Atoni, employees
now have an added burden of proof: Not
only do they have to prove discrimination,
they have to prove there was no business
motive behind the discrimination. In

Martin v. Wilks , the Supreme Court
allowed whites to challenge court
approved affirmative action programs on
the grounds of reverse discrimination.
This tampering with affirmative action
programs profoundly affects America's
outlook. Not only does it remove incen
tives for affirmative action, it creates the
illusion of tolerance for racism. It's as
though the progressive policies from the
'70s and early '80s were just a passing
phase.
Racism is tolerable? Read the National
Review and you'll see it's much more
than tolerable; it's fashionable. In an ar
ticle about discriminatory policies of
leading universities, the National Review
concluded, "Even if these schools made
every heroic recruitment effort, it would
be impossible to find much more than a
tiny handful of blacks who would match
the academic characteristics of these
schools' average student."
One begrudgingly expects such preju
dice from the National Review , but how
about from college professors? Michael
Levin, a professor at City College in New
York claims "there is now quite solid
evidence that . . . the average black is
significantly less intelligent than the
average white."
This is the '80s? If anyone doubted
the necessity of affirmative action, I'll
tell you right now: It's to combat the
inculcated racial classifications which
prosper today.
The idea dates back to Aristotle. When
you have one extreme, the only way it
can ever be balanced is to treat it with
the exact opposite extreme. The only way
we can ever hope to abolish discrimina
tion is to give minorities the benefit of
the doubt and allow them to show their
skill.

The National Review claims "Black
performance on (SAT's) has important
implications concerning the availability
of academically qualified black students
for college recruitment."
Hmm. . . . Maybe many blacks can't
afford the Princeton Review. Maybe
blacks don't have equal representation in
making these tests. Maybe a multiple
choice test can't accurately measure ac
ademic excellence.
So the question remains why white
Stanford and Harvard graduates
(Supreme Court Justice Anthony Ken
nedy, for instance) continue to weaken
affirmative action policies. Maybe they're
afraid affirmative action will hit the Su
preme Court resulting in another black
(gasp!) Supreme Court judge.
Affirmative action, like the Roble ren
novation, will cause a little inconvenience.
But ask the 300 residents of Roble and
they'll tell you a little inconvenience is
worthwhile if it saves rooms and lives.
Likewise, affirmative action is worth
while if it saves dignity. Whether you
think of affirmative action as righting
past wrongs or simply as the right thing
to do, it's about time the United States
has a little foresight.
