## 1906 quake shattered community, suspended all classwork Worst quake in U.S. history tragically scarred University 
### Ari Richter 
In view of the results of the
earthquake ... — its effects on
the University and the community
at large — it is ordered that all
classwork in Stanford University
shall be suspended for the rest of
the college year.
Don't start packing your bags
yet.
That statement was issued 83
years ago by University President
David Starr Jordan in a special
edition of the Daily Palo Alto, the
predecessor of The Stanford Daily.
At 5:07 a.m. on April 18, 1906,
what is presumed to be the worst
earthquake in the history of the
United States devastated the
Pacific Coast, ripping buildings
from their foundations and spark
ing fires that consumed most of
San Francisco before they could
be brought under control.
Meanwhile, the Stanford com
munity was tragically scarred as
two people died amid the horrible
destruction brought on by the
massive temblor.
Junius Hanna, class of 1908,
and Otto Gerdis, who was
employed as a fireman in the
boiler house, were both killed. In
Hanna's case, a chimney plum
meted through the front wing of
Encina Hall, crushing everything
in its path down to the basement.
The damage to the Stanford
campus was immense. Memorial

Church was demolished. A second
special edition of the Daily Palo
Alto on the day of the earthquake
described the extent of that build
ing's demise: "[The] front mosaic
of the church, portraying the Ser
mon on the Mount, was hurled
upon the pavement of the inner
quadrangle in total destruction,
leaving the interior of the church
exposed."
In contrast to last week's earth
quake, the catastrophe of 1906
affected all of the Stanford
campus. Among the fraternities,
the chimneys fell from the roof
of Phi Delta Theta, and Kappa
Sigma lost part of one of its sides.
The Stanford Museum was also
severely damaged, as was Roble
Hall, where, the the left-hand
chimney in front "fell through the
roof and carried the upper floors
through to the first floor," ac
cording to reports in The Daily
Palo Alto. In addition, 30 yards
of the south side of the outer
quadrangle were razed, and the
Stanford residence was "torn
asunder [as] Mrs. Stanford's
former chamber was split evenly
in two."
So calamitous were the effects
of the earthquake that President
Theodore Roosevelt sent a
telegram to Jordan, expressing his
"deep personal concern and sym
pathy over the destructions of the
buildings of Leland Stanford."
Beyond the loss of life and
destruction of property, other

problems presented themselves.
There was great concern that
wholesale looting of the damaged
property might occur, and so the
business office was forced to ap
point "a number of students and
outsiders to guard the University
from loot during the night."
The University's greatest con
cern was that its students would
not return. In his final editorial
of the now-abridged school year,
the editor of the Daily Palo Alto
wrote, "The danger lies in the
fact that many of the students
will feel some hesitation in coming
[back] to Stanford.
"This will be based partially on
foolish fear and partially on fi
nancial difficulties. It is therefore
necessary that every student now
in the University shall return next
fall.
A preliminary estimate of the
cost of repairing the damage was
$2.8 million. But a team of con
sultants put the damage at closer
to $1.8 million, and the most es
sential repairs were begun June
29 and completed Aug. 23, in time
for the new school year to begin.
Despite the fears, the students did
return, and the University con
tinued to grow.
The remainder of the academic
buildings were repaired by De
cember 1908, when restoration of
Memorial Church began. The
church was reopened in 1913 and
fully refurbished by 1916.

meted through the front wing of
Encina Hall, crushing everything
in its path down to the basement.
The damage to the Stanford
campus was immense. Memorial

Church was demolished. A second
special edition of the Daily Palo
Alto on the day of the earthquake
described the extent of that build
ing's demise: "[The] front mosaic
of the church, portraying the Ser
mon on the Mount, was hurled
upon the pavement of the inner
quadrangle in total destruction,
leaving the interior of the church
exposed."
In contrast to last week's earth
quake, the catastrophe of 1906
affected all of the Stanford
campus. Among the fraternities,
the chimneys fell from the roof
of Phi Delta Theta, and Kappa
Sigma lost part of one of its sides.
The Stanford Museum was also
severely damaged, as was Roble
Hall, where, the the left-hand
chimney in front "fell through the
roof and carried the upper floors
through to the first floor," ac
cording to reports in The Daily
Palo Alto. In addition, 30 yards
of the south side of the outer
quadrangle were razed, and the
Stanford residence was "torn
asunder [as] Mrs. Stanford's
former chamber was split evenly
in two."
So calamitous were the effects
of the earthquake that President
Theodore Roosevelt sent a
telegram to Jordan, expressing his
"deep personal concern and sym
pathy over the destructions of the
buildings of Leland Stanford."
Beyond the loss of life and
destruction of property, other

problems presented themselves.
There was great concern that
wholesale looting of the damaged
property might occur, and so the
business office was forced to ap
point "a number of students and
outsiders to guard the University
from loot during the night."
The University's greatest con
cern was that its students would
not return. In his final editorial
of the now-abridged school year,
the editor of the Daily Palo Alto
wrote, "The danger lies in the
fact that many of the students
will feel some hesitation in coming
[back] to Stanford.
"This will be based partially on
foolish fear and partially on fi
nancial difficulties. It is therefore
necessary that every student now
in the University shall return next
fall.
A preliminary estimate of the
cost of repairing the damage was
$2.8 million. But a team of con
sultants put the damage at closer
to $1.8 million, and the most es
sential repairs were begun June
29 and completed Aug. 23, in time
for the new school year to begin.
Despite the fears, the students did
return, and the University con
tinued to grow.
The remainder of the academic
buildings were repaired by De
cember 1908, when restoration of
Memorial Church began. The
church was reopened in 1913 and
fully refurbished by 1916.

Memorial Church took quite a beating in the 1906 earthquake. Last week's quake did not damage
the building itself as much, but it did greatly damage the church's interior.
