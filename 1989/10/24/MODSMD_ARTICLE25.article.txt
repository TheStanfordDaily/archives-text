## Soccer looks to upset No. 1 UNC 
### Chris Crader Editorial staff 
When one watches a collegiate sports
program turn around, there are usually
several tell-tale signs.
First, the team's record improves. The
team brings in highly-touted recruits.
And the team plays with more confi
dence.
For the 19th-ranked Cardinal wom
en's soccer team, however, the signs will
be even more obvious today. The team
need only look across the field and see
today's opponent, North Carolina.
The Tar Heel women's soccer team
is perhaps the most dominant team in
the '80s, having won seven national
titles in eight years. The fact that North
Carolina came out to play Stanford,
more than anything else, gives the Car
dinal soccer program a sense of
legitimacy.
The game kicks off at 3 p.m. at Harry
Maloney Field.
"It's real neat that they're coming
out to play us," junior forward Jennifer
Rowland said. "A couple of years ago,
they wouldn't have thought twice. Now
maybe they're a little scared."
The Stanford players don't seem
scared about facing a team that has not
lost a game since the 1985 NCAA final.
"I think the team will be ready to play,"
sophomore defender Heather Mclntyre
said. "Being at home, I think we'll be
ready for this game."
"If we don't go out there all in

timidated, we'll be fine," freshman
midfielder Julie Foudy said.
Stanford has fared fairly well against
highly-ranked teams so far this year.
The Cardinal lost 1-0 in overtime to
No. 2 Colorado College and just fell 3-2
No. 4 Virginia Sunday in Virginia.
Stanford is 10-4-1 this year and the four
losses have all been by one goal, on the
road, against top-20 teams.
On the other hand, North Carolina
comes in riding an 89-game unbeaten
streak (84 wins and five ties). The Heels
have posted 11 straight shutouts, out
scoring their opponents 38-0 during that
span, and have given up only six goals
all year.
North Carolina defeated No. 9 Santa
Clara 4-0 Saturday and No. 16 St.
Mary's 5-0 Sunday in the first two
games of their three-game California
trip.
Leading the way has been 1988 NCAA
Player of the Year Shannon Higgins.
Higgins, who scored three goals in the
NCAA Championship match last year,
is tied for the team scoring lead with
12 goals and 10 assists.
Two freshman have also contributed
greatly to the Heels' success as forwards
Kristine Lilly and Mia Hamm have
stepped right into starting roles for
North Carolina. Lilly is tied with Hig
gins for the team scoring lead with 15
goals and four assists and Hamm is
third with 15 goals and three assists.
The Tar Heel freshmen may meet
their match in Stanford's frosh class.

however. The Cardinal has been starting
three freshmen, including Foudy, the
top recruit in the nation last year. Like
Lilly, Foudy is a starter for the U.S.
National Team, coached by Carolina
Coach Anson Dorrance.
Foudy has 12 goals and nine assists
this year and is a big reason why Stan
ford has already broken the single
season school scoring record of 37 goals,
set last year. With four games remaining
the Cardinal has 43 goals this year.
Today's game is the third of five
straight against top-25 teams. Stanford
defeated Duke 2-1 Saturday at the Vir
ginia Invitational before falling to the
Cavaliers. Following today's game, Stan
ford hosts No. 10 Wisconsin Friday and
No. 6 UC-Santa Barbara Sunday in the
Cardinal Invitational.
Stanford is trying to secure the
school's first-ever berth in the 12-team
NCAA Tournament. "I really think we
are one of the top 15 teams in the
country," Andeberhan said.

Leading the way has been 1988 NCAA
Player of the Year Shannon Higgins.
Higgins, who scored three goals in the
NCAA Championship match last year,
is tied for the team scoring lead with
12 goals and 10 assists.
Two freshman have also contributed
greatly to the Heels' success as forwards
Kristine Lilly and Mia Hamm have
stepped right into starting roles for
North Carolina. Lilly is tied with Hig
gins for the team scoring lead with 15
goals and four assists and Hamm is
third with 15 goals and three assists.
The Tar Heel freshmen may meet
their match in Stanford's frosh class.

however. The Cardinal has been starting
three freshmen, including Foudy, the
top recruit in the nation last year. Like
Lilly, Foudy is a starter for the U.S.
National Team, coached by Carolina
Coach Anson Dorrance.
Foudy has 12 goals and nine assists
this year and is a big reason why Stan
ford has already broken the single
season school scoring record of 37 goals,
set last year. With four games remaining
the Cardinal has 43 goals this year.
Today's game is the third of five
straight against top-25 teams. Stanford
defeated Duke 2-1 Saturday at the Vir
ginia Invitational before falling to the
Cavaliers. Following today's game, Stan
ford hosts No. 10 Wisconsin Friday and
No. 6 UC-Santa Barbara Sunday in the
Cardinal Invitational.
Stanford is trying to secure the
school's first-ever berth in the 12-team
NCAA Tournament. "I really think we
are one of the top 15 teams in the
country," Andeberhan said.
