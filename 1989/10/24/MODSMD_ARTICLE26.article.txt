# Women's Soccer vs. North Carolina
## 
### 
TODAY - 3 p.m. at Harry Maloney Field.
RECORDS - Stanford (10-4-1), North
Carolina (19-0-0).
NOTES â€” The Tar Heels have won three
straight NCAA Championships and
have not lost since 1985. Stanford is
7-0 at home, however, and if the team
plays its best, the Cardinal has the
talent to give Carolina a fight.
