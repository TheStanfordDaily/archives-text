# Cardinal booters should get tarred by Carolina Heels, right?
## 
### 
For those of you who don't know,
Stanford has a top-20 women's soc
cer team. The team is off to u 10-4-1
start this season, including a perfect 7-0
home mark, and has been ranked in the
top 20 all year.
Stanford hosts North Carolina today,
the No. 1-ranked team in the nation, and
despite the Cardinal's successes this year,
few people think the team can beat the
Tar Heels. Here, then, are the top-10
reasons why the Cardinal will lose to
North Car lina today, as compiled by the
home office in Menlo Park, Calif., and
10 explanations why those reasons are
wrong.
• 10: North Carolina hasn't allowed a
goal in 11 games.
True. The last team to score off the
Tar Heels was Duke, who scored twice
in a 4-2 loss almost five weeks ago. But
the Cardinal just heat Duke 2-1 Saturday.
• 9: The Tar Heels have scored 77 goals

in their 19 games this year.
Yes, but the Stanford defense has been
tough this year with the play of stopper
Heather Mclntyre and goalkeeper Elise
Edwards. Stanford has recorded eight
shutouts this year and allowed only one
goal at home. There is no reason the
team cannot shut out UNC.
• 8: North Carolina has won seven na
tional titles in the last eight years.
"We have nothing to lose," freshman
Julie Foudy said. "We have enough con
fidence to know we can play with them."
• 7: The Cardinal is tired after flying
back from Virginia yesterday.
Stanford played two tough games 3,000
miles from home over the weekend but
so did North Carolina. The Tar Heels
met top-20 powers Santa Clara and St.
Mary's over the weekend and probably
can't wait to get back home. They should
be at least as tired as Stanford.
• 6: The North Carolina defense has

only given up six goals in 19 games.
The Stanford offense has been working
well lately. The Cardinal has seven goals
in its last three games and has already
broken the school record for goals in a
season.
• 5: Stanford will fall to the Carolina
mystique.

Yeah, right. "We're just going to out
there and have a good time," Stanford
forward Jennifer Rowland said. So much
for the mystique.
• 4: The Tar Heels have U.S. National
Team Coach Anson Dorrance at the helm.
Rule No. 1 is that who the coach is
doesn't make that much of a difference,
unless he suits up or something. Further
more, Stanford Coach Berhane Andeber
han is the coach of the U.S. Under-19
National Team. Those who know him
think he's as good a coach as any.
• 3: The Tar Heels had probably the
best recruiting class in the nation as
frosh Kristine Lilly and Mia Hamm are
on the national team and are two of
Carolina's top three scorers.
Stanford also has an outstanding
freshman class. Midfielders Kirby Seale,
Jennifer Potok and Carolyn Einstein have
played, played often, and played well for
Stanford. Forward Anne Hoge scored her

first collegiate goal last week and those
four freshmen have combined for six goals
and eight assists.
• 2: The Heels have Shannon Higgins,
the 1988 NCAA Player of the Year.
Stanford has Foudy, soon to be the
1989 Freshman of the Year. "She is an
amazing talent," Andeberhan said. "She
is one of the most polished soccer players
in the country."
Foudy has 12 goals and nine assists
already for Stanford an should be a first
team Ail-American this year, and the next
three.
• 1: North Carolina has not lost a game
since 1985, winning 84 and tying five.
In those 8100 minutes of soccer, UNC
has trailed for a total of 13 minutes, 15
seconds.
But streaks are made to be broken.
All I can say is if this one is snapped
today, 1 want to be there to see it happen.
Game time is 3 p.m. at Moloney Field.

be at least as tired as Stanford.
• 6: The North Carolina defense has

only given up six goals in 19 games.
The Stanford offense has been working
well lately. The Cardinal has seven goals
in its last three games and has already
broken the school record for goals in a
season.
• 5: Stanford will fall to the Carolina
mystique.

Yeah, right. "We're just going to out
there and have a good time," Stanford
forward Jennifer Rowland said. So much
for the mystique.
• 4: The Tar Heels have U.S. National
Team Coach Anson Dorrance at the helm.
Rule No. 1 is that who the coach is
doesn't make that much of a difference,
unless he suits up or something. Further
more, Stanford Coach Berhane Andeber
han is the coach of the U.S. Under-19
National Team. Those who know him
think he's as good a coach as any.
• 3: The Tar Heels had probably the
best recruiting class in the nation as
frosh Kristine Lilly and Mia Hamm are
on the national team and are two of
Carolina's top three scorers.
Stanford also has an outstanding
freshman class. Midfielders Kirby Seale,
Jennifer Potok and Carolyn Einstein have
played, played often, and played well for
Stanford. Forward Anne Hoge scored her

first collegiate goal last week and those
four freshmen have combined for six goals
and eight assists.
• 2: The Heels have Shannon Higgins,
the 1988 NCAA Player of the Year.
Stanford has Foudy, soon to be the
1989 Freshman of the Year. "She is an
amazing talent," Andeberhan said. "She
is one of the most polished soccer players
in the country."
Foudy has 12 goals and nine assists
already for Stanford an should be a first
team Ail-American this year, and the next
three.
• 1: North Carolina has not lost a game
since 1985, winning 84 and tying five.
In those 8100 minutes of soccer, UNC
has trailed for a total of 13 minutes, 15
seconds.
But streaks are made to be broken.
All I can say is if this one is snapped
today, 1 want to be there to see it happen.
Game time is 3 p.m. at Moloney Field.
