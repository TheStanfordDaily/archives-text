# Hockey drops three at Invite
## Despite losses, team breaks scoring drought, claims victory 
### John Louie Staff writer 
Two droughts came to an end
this weekend.
For the Stanford women's field
hockey team, Saturday's
downpour seemed a fitting time
to end the team's scoreless streak
of eight games. Although the team
came away from this weekend's
Cal Invitational with an 0-3-1
record, the team's goals sym
bolized a moral victory.
"Even though we lost three
games, the goals made us all feel
like we won," co-captain Beth
Lewinger said. "Scoring was the
most important step toward get
ting out of our rut."
"We all went away from the
tournament with a great feeling,"
forward Erin Mcßride said.
On Friday, however, Cardinal
spirits were low after two shutout
losses. Arch-rival California
handed Stanford a 2-0 loss, fol
lowed by a 4-0 defeat to Simon
Fraser of Canada. In the Simon
Fraser loss, the Cardinal played
an entirely different starting
lineup. However, the outstanding
collegiate debut of freshman
defender Melissa Joe was over
shadowed by the team's eighth

consecutive shutout.
"Yet, in the next match, the
Cardinal came out strong. Stan
ford's 2-2 tie to University of the
Pacific marked an optimistic last
game for Coach Sheryl Johnson.
Johnson, a member of the na
tional field hockey team, left that
night for an Olympic qualifying
tournament in India.
"Coach told us to score for her,"
Lewinger said. "We just went out
there and pulled it out."
With UOP holding a 1-0 lead
late in the first half, forward Mi
chelle Beynet took control of the
Cardinal's corner, and broke from
the pack to score for Stanford. "I
just saw the opening and nailed
it in there," Beynet said. "We were
all really psyched that we finally
scored. It made the whole team
feel optimistic."
Stanford carried the momen
tum into the second half, breaking

the tie with a goal from forward
Katy Filner. Despite a late UOP
goal to tie the game and two fruit
less overtime periods, Stanford
emerged feeling victorious.
"That was our best game all
season," forward Erin Mcßride
said. "We kept shooting the whole
game, and UOP got really scared.
Our momentum just kept us roll
ing. We all wanted to try extra
hard for Sheryl's last game."
On Sunday, Chico State edged
Stanford 2-1 after the Wildcats
scored in the game's final
minutes. Co-captain Michelanno
Baker notched her second goal of
the season early in the match to
tie the score. Stanford fell to 1-8-3
overall, but retained its 1-2-2 con
ference record.
This game also marked the
team's first game under the guid
ance of Assistant Coach Noelle
Nelson, the team's defensive
coordinator. Nelson will fill in for
Johnson for the remainder of the
season, including the team's up
coming four-game East Coast trip.
For the team, however, this
coaching change should be an easy
adaptation. "Noelle has an en
tirely different style than Sheryl,"
Lewinger said. "She's also a really
great motivator."
