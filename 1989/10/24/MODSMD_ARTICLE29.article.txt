The future looked bright for Stanford sailing last
weekend as young Cardinal sailors captured nine
of the top 10 places at the annual Stanford Frosh-
Soph Regatta.
"(Stanford) clearly outshined the competition,"
Coach Blake Middleton said. "The results were ex
citing because they indicate that the sailing team
will continue to be strong in the coming years."
Eighteen boats from six schools competed in the
one-day, one-division regatta at Stanford's facility
in Redwood City. The fleet was comprised of fresh
men and sophomores from Stanford, San Jose State,
UC-Davis, California, San Diego State and UCLA.
Only Cal managed to break Stanford's total domi
nance, placing one boat in sixth.
Sophomore Matt Sanford and crew Deborah
Claymon won the regatta for the Cardinal, with
teammates Peter Somers and Paula Gani finishing
a close second. Sanford and Claymon's consistent
top finishes throughout the day's 15 races gave
them the title, despite the fact that Somers and
Gani won each of the last three races.
Freshman Brady Sih and crew Matt Dunbar, soph
omore Paul Brotherton and Sidney Roberts, and

freshman Leo Sommaripa and crew Karen Ward
rounded out the top five for the Cardinal. Som
maripa and Ward had one of the day's highlights,
finishing second in a race despite capsizing on the
leeward leg of the course.
Other placewinners for Stanford were Haley King
and Marina Kimball (seventh), Lewis Kofsky and
Jennifer Yeh (eighth), Rusty Lhamon and David
James (ninth), John Emory and Jon Schreiber
(10th), Geoff Garrison and Dominique Blom (12th),
and Cathy Petzold and Andi Guerrero (15th).
All the Stanford teams placed in the top three
in at least one race.
The strength of the Stanford team will be put to
the test again this weekend when the Cardinal
travels to the East Coast to compete for the Schell
Trophy at MIT. Representing Stanford at this pres
tigious invitational regatta will be Sih, Dunbar,
Brett Adams, Kathryn Haggitt, Sanford and Sue
Kown.
Other members of the Cardinal squad will com-
G;te at the Pacific Coast Sloop Championships at
C-Irvine. The returning sloop team of Dave Dowd,
Scott Dale and Robert Brown will attempt to qualify
for nationals at this regatta.
