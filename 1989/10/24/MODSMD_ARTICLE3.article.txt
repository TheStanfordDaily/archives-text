# Hundreds of students join quake relief effort

About 500 student volunteers
embraced the spirit of giving this
past week, donating their time
and money to help both the Stan
ford community and the Bay Area
recover from the devastating ef
fects of the earthquake that
struck one week ago.
Mobilized through the efforts
of the Haas Center for Public
Service, students volunteered
their services at places as close
as the Law School Library and as
far away as Watsonville, south of
Santa Cruz, according to Sue
Gray, coordinator of the Clearing
house, a division of the public
service center.
"The initial outpouring of sup
port was heartening for all." said
Catherine Milton, director of the
Haas Center.
The day after the earthquake,
300 to 400 students swarmed the
first volunteer meeting at Tresid
der Union, according to Volunteer
Coordinator Julie Lythcott. But
because the "full need hadn't been
assessed until Friday," they were
told to wait for further notice of
volunteer opportunities.
Unable to go to San Francisco
to assist earthquake victims or go
into campus buildings to help
clean up, students began by col
lecting clothes and raising funds
for relief organizations such as
the American Red Cross. Since
Thursday, they have collected a
total of $3500, both from dorms
and individual contributors, ac
cording to Gray.
Once buildings were deemed
safe by engineers, Gray and Lyth
cott sent student volunteers to
help reshelve library books and
restore offices, at the request of
weary librarians and professors.

Lythcott.
This past weekend, MEChA, a
Chicano/Latino student group, or
ganized 20 students to assist the
predominately Hispanic commu
nity of Watsonville get back on
its feet. MEChA, with the help of
the public service center, plans to
send another contingent of stu
dents and supplies to help resi
dents there.
Despite such efforts, the num
ber of volunteers has diminished
in the last few days, according to
Lythcott.
Lythcott and volunteers made
thousands of calls this weekend
to dorm coordinators and resident
assistants, asking for 350 volun
teers to sweep the stadium after
the football games on Saturday
and Sunday. Only 150 volunteers
showed up, however, according to
Lythcott.
The money that would have
been used to pay a stadium main
tenance crew was instead used to
create a community earthquake
relief fund. The public service cen
ter will distribute the funds later
to earthquake victims as well as
people who were homeless prior
to the earthquake.
Though disappointed by the low
turnout of volunteers, both Gray
