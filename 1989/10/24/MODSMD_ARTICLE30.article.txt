# Volleyball takes road to SJSU
## 
### David Earnest Senior staff writer 
There's no place like home for
the Stanford women's volleyball
team.
Because of construction on
the team's new home, Old Pa
vilion, the Cardinal was able to
play only four of its first 15
matches at home. Then, last

week's earthquake forced Stan
ford to cancel two home matches
and reschedule one. Only six of
the Cardinal's remaining 12
games will be at home.
Tonight the Cardinal hits the
road once again to visit the
Spartans of San Jose State, and
their once comfortable five
game home stand has been
reduced to two.

The canceled games also
mean the Cardinal has not
played a match in over a week.
Given that Stanford slumped
early in the season only to snap
out of it in the two matches
preceding the quake, and
resumes play with an away
match, questions about the con
sistency of this team are once
again pertinent.
Has the long layoff hurt the
team?
"I hope not," Coach Don Shaw
said. "I would've liked to have

played some matches. ... It was
a chance for us to catch our
breath and regroup. It might be
good for us to have a break like
that."
The team started to get the
wheels moving against Arizona
and Arizona State. Stanford,
now 10-5 and ranked eighth in
the country, beat the No. 9 Wild
cats in four games on Oct. 13
and swept ASU the following
night. But without a match in
10 days, will the players be able
to maintain their mental tough
ness?
"I'm just really excited to play
again," sophomore Kristin Klein
said. "I think it was a nice
break; we got to get some of
our schoolwork done. Now we
can give 100 percent to volley
ball."
The Spartans have several
looming questions as well. Al
though the Spartans did play
two weekend road matches, San
Jose State only yesterday moved
back into the earthquake
damaged Spartan Gym and has
not practiced at home since the
There is even a question as
to whether or not the match
will be played. Although Shaw
said he's "90 percent certain"
that the match will be played
at Spartan Gym, he said it could
be moved to Old Pavilion if nec
essary.
