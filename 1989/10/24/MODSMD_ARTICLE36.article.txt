## 
### Molly Conroy 
Many students attending this
Sunday's early ASSU Flicks left
shocked and angry because of a
graphic rape scene in the short
film which was shown before the
feature presentation "Cousins."
The short, which was taken
from the Alfred Hitchcock film
"Frenzy," was intended to func
tion as a preview for next week's
Hitchcock main feature, "Rear
Window," according to Jay Gol
din, the project manager of ASSU
Sunday Flicks.
Goldin selected the short from
a catalogue of short films. He said
he has ordered from the same
distributor in the past.

While many of the films in the
catalogue have the rating level of
offensive material, this short did
not, Goldin said.
In addition, the distributor sent
a 20-minute version of the short
instead of the 10-minute version
which Goldin had ordered.
Goldin also said that while he
was "aware of the subject of the
film" and the fact that it con
tained a graphic rape scene, he
did not know that the offensive
scene would be the focus of the
short.
Many members of the audience
reacted to the short with shock
and revulsion. As junior Nate Rut
man observed, viewers "expect a
short at the beginning of Flicks

to be funny. This was not appro
priate."
As the short ran on and the
scene became more graphic, the
audience began to hiss and some
shouted, "Where's 'Cousins'?" ac
cording to freshman Amit Baner
jee.
Senior Tara Zandvliet noticed
that "some of the women were
hiding their faces and the men
were just as disgusted." She al
most walked out of the auditori
um, planning to return when the
featured flick began, she said.
Banerjee said the short was of
fensive because "it was so long
and the rape scene was completely
out of context."
The Flicks management finally

stopped the projector and made a
brief apology to the audience. Ac
cording to junior Justin Hayes,
the message was still mixed be
cause "the person said, 'That's not
the short for this week, that's for
next week.' It seemed all he was
apologizing for was for showing
it at the wrong time."
In response to the controversy,
Goldin said he will be more careful
in selecting previews in the fu
ture, even though he does not
have the necessary resources to
screen the previews personally.
He added that he "will not cen
sor films" and cited the fact that
in the past Flicks has shown con
troversial films such as "Angel
Heart" and "9-1/2 Weeks."
