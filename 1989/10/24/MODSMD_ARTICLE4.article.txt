### Pam Weisz Staff writer 
Of the 15 Row houses originally
closed because of earthquake
damage, eight have been reopened
or will reopen this week, while
the other seven will be closed for
at least the remainder of the quar
ter.
Columbae, Delta Tau Delta, Phi
Psi and Synergy will be closed for
the rest of the year, according to
Director of Housing and Food
Services Keith Guy, who an
nounced the University's final
decision last night at a meeting
with student representatives from
the closed houses. These houses
are "out of commission," Guy
said.
Roth, Theta Xi and Durand will
be closed for the rest of the quar

reopened winter quarter, Guy
said.
French House, Grove Lasuen,
Hammarskjold, Kairos and Phi
Sig should be open by Saturday.
Theta Chi, Slavianskii Dom and
Haus Mitteleuropa have already
been reopened.
Students can begin retrieving
their belongings from some of the
closed houses starting today. Stu

Delta, Phi Psi and Synergy may
go to these houses today between
10:30 a.m. and 6:30 p.m. They
will be allowed in two at a time,
accompanied by a staff member
from Housing and Food Services,
and will be given approximately
half an hour to pack their belong
ings.
Theta Xi, Roth and Durand
should be accessible by Wednes
day, Guy said. Because these
houses are more structurally
sound, students will be able to
enter these houses in larger
groups — approximately eight at
a time.
Guy said that it is still unknown
when students will be able to enter

Columbae because there is "such
concern about stability."
Students will be able to store
their belongings in rented U-Haul
trucks after they have retrieved
them. The trucks will then be
locked up until the students are

relocated.
The draw for those students
whose houses have been closed
will be held on Wednesday and
Thursday. Students can draw
