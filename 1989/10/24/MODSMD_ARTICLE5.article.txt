A victim once again
As In the 1906 earthquake, Memorial Church was damaged
severely last Tuesday. Large sections of the ceiling mosaic
came crashing down, damaging pews in the process. Officials
are concerned that more damage may be forthcoming since
the keystones in the arches that support the dome have
slipped out of position.
