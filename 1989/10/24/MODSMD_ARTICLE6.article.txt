# School of Ed expands program for undergrads
## 
### Jeff Brock Staff writer 
The School of Education plans
to expand its Undergraduate
Honors Program this spring be
cause of growing interest in the
educational field, according to Ed
ucation Prof. Denis Phillips, the
director of the program.
The nondepartmental program,
which began last year, is aimed
toward those students who would
like to do unique, in-depth course
work in education in addition to
work in their major, Phillips said.
It is not designed for students in
terested in teaching, he added.
Last year's program had room
for 12 students, but seven of those
students will continue their re
search this year, leaving only five
spots open.
But according to Phillips, by
spring quarter, the popular pro
gram will accept more students.
There has been "a explo
sion" of student interest in edu
cation in the past decade, Phillips
said.
As a result, Phillips said he
plans to "take the lid off' the
quota.
Applications for the open spots
were due last week, and new ap
plications will be processed at the
end of fall and spring quarter each
year, Phillips said.
Admissions decisions are based
on the grade point indicator in
the applicant's mtyor, a statement
of purpose and the availability of
a faculty member who has similar
academic interests and is willing
to help the student, he said.
Phillips said that in addition to
the required coursework of their
own students must take
25 units of approved honors
coursework, including:
• Three courses from each of
three required areas: Educational
Policy and History, Contemporary
Problem Areas and Foundational

Disciplines (12-15 units),
• Directed reading correlating
the student's to aspects of
education (4 units),
• A one-quarter honors collo
quium to discuss methodology and
work in progress (2 units),
• An honors thesis consisting of
independent or faculty-assisted re
search (5-8 units) and
• A mini-conference in which
candidates for honors make an
oral presentation of their work.
Phillips developed the program
three years ago and submitted a
proposal to the Committee for Un
dergraduate Studies, where it was
unanimously approved. With the
Faculty Senate's subsequent ap
proval, the program began last
year.
"Interest in our school has been
growing by leaps and bounds,"
Education Prof. Michael Kirst
said. Kirst, along with Education
Prof. David Tyack, teaches a
popular course in American Edu
cation and Public Policy.
"When I came here in 1969, the
school had virtually no contact
with undergraduates and in fact
prided itself in being associated
only with graduates," Kirst said.
"That attitude has swung around
180 degrees in the past decade."
The school's growing commit
ment to undergraduates, the large
number of faculty and the amount
of depth in the new honors pro
gram has attracted many stu
dents, he said. The American Ed
ucation course, which had 35 stu
dents six years ago, now has 130,
according to Kirst.
He said the program gives stu
dents a valuable chance for in
depth study and a close personal
relationship with a faculty mem
ber that is hard to acquire at a
large university like Stanford.
"There's a number of faculty
ready and willing to sponsor in
terested students," Kirst said.
