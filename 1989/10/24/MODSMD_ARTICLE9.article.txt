Burst pipe soaks Lou Henry
A hot water pipe burst in the Lou Henry Hoover
Building yesterday, presumably due to "cracking
caused by the earthquake," according to Charles
Palm, associate director of the Hoover Institution.
At 10 a.m. yesterday, the pipe burst in the ceiling
above the card catalog cabinet in the lobby, and
the stream of water hit the cabinet. Fortunately
all drawers were closed, so no damage was done
to the cards inside.
Some water leaked down to the stack floors in
the basement, getting bodes in about five shelving
units wet. As a result, the library, which was
originally scheduled to reopen today after cleanup
from the earthquake, will not open until tomorrow.
Palm said the staff reacted quickly by covering
the card catalog cabinet and basement stack area
with plastic. The wet books were air-dried yester
day afternoon. Stanford facilities staff immediately
shut off the water after the leak to prevent further
damage.
The building passed inspection last Friday af
ternoon after it was tested for structural damages
and potential asbestos hazard. The staff reported
to work yesterday morning to begin reshelving
books in the East Asia Library, according to Palm.
"We feel fortunate that the collection came
through with no damage," Palm said. The earth
quake did virtually no damage to the volumes and
archives, he added.
There is some property damage in the building
such as fallen ceiling tiles. Palm said he considered
this damage "relatively minor and superficial."
The repair cost has not yet been estimated.

The leak in the building was originally spotted
as a small puddle. Palm said small puddles may
"signify serious problems," and he warned other
people to "take small water leaks seriously."

London band cancels concert
Because of fears resulting from last Tuesday's
earthquake, the Hanover band, a London-based
classical orchestra, has canceled its scheduled West
Coast premiere at 8 p.m. Nov. 1 in Dinkelspiel
Auditorium.
The concert was scheduled as part of the Lively
Arts at Stanford season.
Stephen Nieman, executive director of the
Hanover Band, said in a memo to the ensemble's
management that he has received "a number of
very awkward telephone calls from members of
the orchestra.. . . They are concerned not only for
their safety but for . . . the Hanover Band."
Neiman also said that the ensemble's Bay Area
performance is further precluded by a withdrawal
of support from the British Musicians Union.
According to Nieman, "My telephone conversa
tions with representatives of the union worry me
more. In the end their message is simple: Go to
Stanford at your own risk. Should Stanford cancel,
then the union would not uphold a claim by their
members and would force me to pay my members'
fees, costs, etc.... If I do not take this action
now I lose the chance of making sensible alternative
accommodation and travel plans."
Ticketholders may obtain refunds at the Tres

idder ticket office until Jan. 17, 1990.
Earthquake damage has also forced cancellation
of the Music Department's All Hallows' Eve organ
concert at 8 p.m. Oct. 31 in Memorial Church.
Filmmaker to screen picture
Bay Area filmmaker Douglas Cruickshank will
lecture and show his film "Victory over the Sun"
at 8 p.m. tomorrow in Annenberg Auditorium.
The free event is sponsored by the Department of
Art and the Committee for Art at Stanford.
"Victory over the Sun" is a film recreation of
a 1913 Russian futurist "opera" that was one of
a number of small avant-garde theater works com
bining new styles being explored in art, verbal and
musical composition in the early years of the 20th
century.
The film's basic theme, man against the sun,
is meant to embody the futurist desire to transcend
the present and the visible, according to a press
release.
The film has appeared at festivals around the
world and was most recently shown at the
Museum in Amsterdam and in a BBC production
on the Russian avant-garde.
Cruickshank, who is also a writer and book
designer, was the producer in 1980 of the public
television series "The Independents."
Biologists address deforestation
"Tropical Deforestation: Causes and Conse

quences" is the subject of a three-night lecture
series that begins this Thursday.
The talks, sponsored by the Morrison Institute
for Population and Resource Studies, will be held
from 7:30 to 10 p.m. in Herrin Hall, room T-175.
The remaining two lectures will be held Nov. 16
and Nov. 30.
The series is intended to educate the community
about the complex issues involved in tropical
deforestation and about how these issues are being
addressed by researchers in a range of fields.
Speakers are all visiting researchers at Stanford.
Speaking Thursday night will be Julie Denslow,
a tropical forest ecologist with the Tulane Univer
sity biology department, and Robert Repetto of
the World Resources Institute in Washington, D.C.
Denslow's work focuses on the natural processes
by which the vast species diversity of tropical
forests and the structure of the forest are generated
and maintained. Repetto's work on the economic
and policy causes of deforestation places the blame
on short-sighted and unrealistic valuations of the
forest's economic potential.
Other speakers in the series include Philip
Fearnside of the National Institute for Amazonian
Research in Brazil, Peter Kunstadter of UC-San
Francisco and Gary Hartshorn of the World
Wildlife Fund in Washington, D.C.
Fearnside's work includes estimating rates of
deforestation, analyzing its causes and working
with Brazilians to develop sustainable land uses.
Kunstadter has studied the effect of agricultural
transition in northern Thailand on deforestation.
Hartshorn will discuss a project using ecological
principles to manage forests for timber production.

The film has appeared at festivals around the
world and was most recently shown at the
Museum in Amsterdam and in a BBC production
on the Russian avant-garde.

Biologists address deforestation
"Tropical Deforestation: Causes and Conse

quences" is the subject of a three-night lecture
series that begins this Thursday.
The talks, sponsored by the Morrison Institute
for Population and Resource Studies, will be held
from 7:30 to 10 p.m. in Herrin Hall, room T-175.
The remaining two lectures will be held Nov. 16
and Nov. 30.
The series is intended to educate the community
about the complex issues involved in tropical
deforestation and about how these issues are being
addressed by researchers in a range of fields.
Speakers are all visiting researchers at Stanford.
Speaking Thursday night will be Julie Denslow,
a tropical forest ecologist with the Tulane Univer
sity biology department, and Robert Repetto of
the World Resources Institute in Washington, D.C.
Denslow's work focuses on the natural processes
by which the vast species diversity of tropical
forests and the structure of the forest are generated
and maintained. Repetto's work on the economic
and policy causes of deforestation places the blame
on short-sighted and unrealistic valuations of the
forest's economic potential.
Other speakers in the series include Philip
Fearnside of the National Institute for Amazonian
Research in Brazil, Peter Kunstadter of UC-San
Francisco and Gary Hartshorn of the World
Wildlife Fund in Washington, D.C.
Fearnside's work includes estimating rates of
deforestation, analyzing its causes and working
with Brazilians to develop sustainable land uses.
Kunstadter has studied the effect of agricultural
transition in northern Thailand on deforestation.
Hartshorn will discuss a project using ecological
principles to manage forests for timber production.
Burst pipe soaks Lou Henry
A hot water pipe burst in the Lou Henry Hoover
Building yesterday, presumably due to "cracking
caused by the earthquake," according to Charles
Palm, associate director of the Hoover Institution.
At 10 a.m. yesterday, the pipe burst in the ceiling
above the card catalog cabinet in the lobby, and
the stream of water hit the cabinet. Fortunately
all drawers were closed, so no damage was done
to the cards inside.
Some water leaked down to the stack floors in
the basement, getting bodes in about five shelving
units wet. As a result, the library, which was
originally scheduled to reopen today after cleanup
from the earthquake, will not open until tomorrow.
Palm said the staff reacted quickly by covering
the card catalog cabinet and basement stack area
with plastic. The wet books were air-dried yester
day afternoon. Stanford facilities staff immediately
shut off the water after the leak to prevent further
damage.
The building passed inspection last Friday af
ternoon after it was tested for structural damages
and potential asbestos hazard. The staff reported
to work yesterday morning to begin reshelving
books in the East Asia Library, according to Palm.
"We feel fortunate that the collection came
through with no damage," Palm said. The earth
quake did virtually no damage to the volumes and
archives, he added.
There is some property damage in the building
such as fallen ceiling tiles. Palm said he considered
this damage "relatively minor and superficial."
The repair cost has not yet been estimated.

The leak in the building was originally spotted
as a small puddle. Palm said small puddles may
"signify serious problems," and he warned other
people to "take small water leaks seriously."

London band cancels concert
Because of fears resulting from last Tuesday's
earthquake, the Hanover band, a London-based
classical orchestra, has canceled its scheduled West
Coast premiere at 8 p.m. Nov. 1 in Dinkelspiel
Auditorium.
The concert was scheduled as part of the Lively
Arts at Stanford season.
Stephen Nieman, executive director of the
Hanover Band, said in a memo to the ensemble's
management that he has received "a number of
very awkward telephone calls from members of
the orchestra.. . . They are concerned not only for
their safety but for . . . the Hanover Band."
Neiman also said that the ensemble's Bay Area
performance is further precluded by a withdrawal
of support from the British Musicians Union.
According to Nieman, "My telephone conversa
tions with representatives of the union worry me
more. In the end their message is simple: Go to
Stanford at your own risk. Should Stanford cancel,
then the union would not uphold a claim by their
members and would force me to pay my members'
fees, costs, etc.... If I do not take this action
now I lose the chance of making sensible alternative
accommodation and travel plans."
Ticketholders may obtain refunds at the Tres

idder ticket office until Jan. 17, 1990.
Earthquake damage has also forced cancellation
of the Music Department's All Hallows' Eve organ
concert at 8 p.m. Oct. 31 in Memorial Church.
Filmmaker to screen picture
Bay Area filmmaker Douglas Cruickshank will
lecture and show his film "Victory over the Sun"
at 8 p.m. tomorrow in Annenberg Auditorium.
The free event is sponsored by the Department of
Art and the Committee for Art at Stanford.
"Victory over the Sun" is a film recreation of
a 1913 Russian futurist "opera" that was one of
a number of small avant-garde theater works com
bining new styles being explored in art, verbal and
musical composition in the early years of the 20th
century.
The film's basic theme, man against the sun,
is meant to embody the futurist desire to transcend
the present and the visible, according to a press
release.
The film has appeared at festivals around the
world and was most recently shown at the
Museum in Amsterdam and in a BBC production
on the Russian avant-garde.
