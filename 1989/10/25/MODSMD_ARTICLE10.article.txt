Two Stanford profs, win medals
President Bush awarded two Stanford profes
sors the National Medal of Science in a White
House ceremony yesterday. No more than 20
such awards are given each year.
Mathematics Prof. Samuel Karlin was cited
for "his broad and remarkable researches into
mathematical analysis, probability theory and
mathematical statistics, and in the application
of these ideas to mathematical economics, me
chanics and population genetics."
A native of Poland, Karlin was educated at the
Illinois Institute of Technology and received his
Ph.D. in math from Princeton University. He
was a professor at Caltech before coming to Stan
ford in 1956.
Chemistry Prof. Harden McConnell was
rewarded for his "seminal contributions in de
veloping the power of nuclear and electron mag
netic resonance spectroscopy; the introduction of
the spin labeling technique; and for original dis
coveries on the structure, properties and fuction
ing of cell membranes."
CPR, self-defense classes offered
Stanford University Hospital, in conjunction
with the Junior League of Palo Alto, is offering
low-cost CPR classes to the public. The classes,
which qualify participants for American Heart
Association certification, cost $10 and require six
to eight hours of time during two evening ses
sions.
Certified instructors teach such life-saving
skills as mouth-to-mouth breathing and cardiac
compression techniques for infant rescue and
skills to aid a choking person.

Anyone age 13 or older may enroll, and people
from the same organization or company may
enroll as a group. For more information, call
725-4825.
The Mid-Peninsula YWCA Rape Crisis Center
is offering women's self-defense classes to answer
questions about the three different types of self
defense and other inquiries about self defense.
Both an introductory two-night course and a
more in-depth eight-week course will be offered.
For more information, call 494-0993.
Physicist honored at conference
Physicist Felix Bloch, Stanford's first Nobel
laureate and a pioneer in basic science whose
research provided the building blocks for today s
high technology, will be celebrated in a Stanford
centennial conference Friday and Saturday.
Bloch's pioneering work was on the theory of
metals, nuclear magnetic resonance and mag
netism. Bloch, who spent 50 years at Stanford
and died in 1983, shared the Nobel Prize in
Physics for discovering the process of nuclear
magnetic resonance that has led to numerous
applications in physics, chemistry and medicine.
The physicist laid the cornerstone for the de
velopment of semiconductors, which in turn led
to the development of the transistor, the inte
grated circuit and the personal computer. More
than a dozen scientists will speak at the confer
ence on subjects as diverse as neural networks,
nuclear magnetic resonance and modern mag
nets.
The conference will be held in Cubberley Au
ditorium, and the registration fee for the two-day
event is $50. The Department of Physics is co
ordinating the conference.
