## East German president issues warning to countrymen 
### 
BERLIN (AP) - Newly-elected
East German President Egon
Krenz yesterday sternly warned
against further pro-democracy
demonstrations, and communist
authorities for the first time ad
mitted that police had attacked
peaceful activists.
Further protests were expected
late yesterday in East Berlin, a
day after more than 300,000
people marched through the
streets of Leipzig demanding
greater freedom. It was the lar
gest street protest in the nation's
40-year history.
Parliament elected Krenz as
president, and he promised to in
vestigate charges of police
brutality against pro-democracy
demonstrators earlier this month.
Krenz was in charge of police
forces at the time.
Krenz, a 52-year-old career
politician, last week was named
the new Communist Party chief,
East Germany's supreme leader
ship post.
Krenz urged an end to further
demonstrations.
"Demonstrations, however
peacefully they may be planned
and thought out, carry within
themselves the danger of ending
in a different way from how they

started," Krenz told the People's
Chamber after his election.
"Our society, which has so
many new things to tackle, is thus
put under increasing tension," he
said, calling on East Germans to
refrain from demonstrations to
avoid a "worsening of situation
or confrontation."
The official East German news
agency, ADN, said Parliament
elected Krenz, who took over as
party chief late Wednesday, with
a large mgyority of the votes in
the 500-member chamber.
But for the first time during
an election of an East German
president, there were votes
against the single candidate.
Twenty-six members of the
People's Chamber voted against
Krenz, and another 26 abstained,
according to Parliament speaker
Horst Sindermann.
Parliament is under the tight
control of the Communist Party,
and Krenz's election as president
was assured after his nomination
by the 21-member ruling Polit
buro. The People's Chamber also
elected Krenz to be the head of
the nation's armed forces with
eight votes against and 17 absten
tions, ADN said.
East German officials today ad

mitted for the first time that
police had attacked peaceful pro
democracy protesters earlier this
month.
"There were instances where
security officials exceeded their
authority and illegal acts were
committed against some of those
detained," the government said in
a statement released by ADN.
ADN said the government later
decided to use restraint during
mass demonstrations "unless
there is violence or the threat of
violence," and that use of firearms
to quell demonstrators had been
prohibited.
Monday's peaceful two-hour
protest in Leipzig and an an
nouncement from several hundred
factory workers that they formed
the country's first independent
labor union were considered tests
of Krenz's professed desire to
embrace reform.
Under Krenz, mass demonstra
tions are being allowed to proceed
peacefully in East Germany, and
the state-run media have engaged
in unprecedented debate on the
state of the country. But the
ruling Communists have made it
clear that they have no intention
of sharing power with the oppo
sition.
