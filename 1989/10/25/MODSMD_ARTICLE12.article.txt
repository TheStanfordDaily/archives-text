# Palestinian uprising spawns upsurge in internal slayings

NABLUS, Occupied West Bank (AP)
â€” PLO-allied gangs with fanciful names
like "Black Panther Brigades" and "Red
Eagles" are blamed for most of the 20
murders here of Arabs accused of collab
orating with Israel.
Israeli officials claim some gangs op
erate under direct order of the PLO, but
Palestinians maintain that at least some
of the murders have been carried out in
defiance of PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat.

With 132 Palestinians killed for alleged
collaboration in the 22-month-old Pales
tinian uprising, there are fears that the
executions are getting out of hand. Pal
estinians complain that ordinary citizens
are being intimidated by the frequent
murders.
In Nablus last week, the Red Eagles
killed a 24-year-old upholstery worker
and wheeled his body through the streets
of the West Bank's largest city in a push

cart, presumably as a warning to others.
In the occupied Gaza Strip, a school
guard was found burned to death in his
car Oct. 5, and graffiti signed by the
"Palestinian Revolutionary Eagles" took
responsibility for the slaying.
A senior Israeli defense official yester
day confirmed a report in The New York
Times that security forces had discovered
documents linking the Revolutionary
Eagles in Gaza to Yasser Arafat's main

stream PLO faction, Fatah.
One letter quoted by the Times says
slayings should be blamed on the little
known Eagles group in order to deflect
blame from the PLO.
The Times said, however, that the doc
uments could be forgeries. If genuine, the
papers could give credence to Israel's
repeated arguments that Arafat is spon
soring murder despite his claim to have
renounced terrorism in December.

Israeli officials have frequently cited
the slayings of Palestinians by fellow
Arabs as reason for the United States to
halt its dialogue with the PLO, which
was begun after Arafat's statement on
terrorism.
The pace of the killings has quickened
as the uprising has dragged on without
political gains. Of the 132 slayings by
Palestinians since the revolt erupted in
December 1987, 110 occurred this year
alone.
