# Top apparatchiks' seats in doubt

MOSCOW (AP) — Lawmakers
yesterday voted to deny the Com
munist Party its 100 guaranteed
seats in the Soviet Congress,
meaning President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev and other top officials
could be forced to seek popular
election to the body.
The Supreme Soviet legisla
ture's decision, if confirmed by its
parent body, the Congress of
People's Deputies, would mean all
deputies would be elected from
geographical districts.
The current system reserves
only two-thirds of the congres
sional seats for deputies elected
from geographical districts. The
remaining one-third are sent from
certan privileged social organiza
tions, including the Communist
Party.
The Supreme Soviet voted 254-
85 to eliminate from a package

of constitutional amendments a
controversial article giving seats
to the social organizations.
Gorbachev was not present at
the vote. It was not clear whether
the measure had gained his back
ing or represented another in
stance where the increasingly
feisty legislature had imposed its
own will.
Progressives complained that
the existing system violated the
principle of one man, one vote.
They said members of these or
ganizations had the opportunity
to vote in each group as well as
in their geographical district.
The decision does not restrict
the Communist Party from run
ning candidates for geographical
seats.
Last year's political reform gave
the Soviet Union its first multi
candidate elections but also a

complex election system and a
two-level parliament. The 2,250-
member Congress of People's
Deputies elects 542 of its mem
bers to a nearly full-time legisla
ture called the Supreme Soviet.
The reform package promised
100 seats each to the Communist
Party, the official trade unions
and cooperative organizations. It
allocated 75 seats each to the
Komsomol (Communist Youth
League), to creative unions and
to groups of women, academics
and veterans.
In practice, key reform groups
like the Baltic people's fronts and
groups of new private business
cooperatives were shut out of this
group in favor of long-standing
agricultural cooperatives and or
ganizations controlled by the
Communist Party.
