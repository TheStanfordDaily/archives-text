## Use the sacred funds 
### 
Covering repairs with
funds other than tuition
is best of bad options

IF THE COST of the Oct. 17
earthquake damage would be
passed on to students, we'd all
owe the University an extra
$12,307.69 or so.
And that wouldn't even pay for
equipment and furnishings that
need to be replaced in campus
buildings.
Fortunately, though, students
will not have to bear the cost of
earthquake cleanup. Vice President
and Provost James Rosse expects
the $160 million repair cost to be
borne by several other sources of
revenue.
It is a welcome sign that the
University will try to avoid passing
the tragedy's costs onto the stu
dents.
As the University plans to fix
damaged buildings, money might
be saved by initiating some projects
now that were planned for future
dates.
Specifically, seismic reinforce
ment and asbestos removal proj
ects, which aire scheduled as the
money comes in for them, should
be completed as the buildings are
being physically repaired. That
way, the building will not have to
be closed a second time down the
road, and the contractor will not
have to do a second job on the
building.
The University's operating

budget currently stands at $380
million, which Budget Director
Timothy Warner says could not
sustain the total repair bill. The
operating budget cannot be ad
justed for earthquake damage, any
way, since the amount is relatively
fixed.
That leaves the University with
three rarely used options to pay
for the repairs.
Rosse said the bulk of the money
will come from loans from outside
lenders, which will be raised
through the distribution of AAA
rated bonds from the University.
However, that option would even
tually increase the University
budget deficit, since the bonds
would have to be paid back through
the operating budget.
The second source is the Uni
versity's $2 billion endowment.
Though the money is available,
taking funds from the endowment
decreases the substantial amount
of interest that Stanford receives
from the sum.
The third method is taking
money from Centennial Campaign
donations earmarked for planned
University projects, which would
either postpone or cancel those
projects.
Instead of increasing the deficit
through the bond option, which
may lead to increased student costs
down the road, the University
should seriously investigate dip
ping into the endowment and Cen
tennial funds, both of which have
been "sacred" bystanders as Stan
ford has fallen into a deficit situ
ation and students have had to
suffer large tuition increases.
