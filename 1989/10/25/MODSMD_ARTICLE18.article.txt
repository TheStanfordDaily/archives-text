Row 'refugees' request faculty, student support

WE, THE ROW "refugee" resi
dent assistants, would like to
communicate the nature and
magnitude of the problems experienced
by the Row refugees and suggest how
the rest of the University can help.
In short, our lives have been totally
chaotic. Our houses are closed, we
can't even go in to get our things, and
we live in ever-changing temporary
housing â€” consisting mainly of dorm
lounges.
As you may well know, lounges are
arranged for easy access and fun, not
for sleeping, reading and studying.
Besides that, the residents of the
houses still use the lounges for recrea
tion.
The point of this is that Row refu
gees, about 4 percent of the student
body, have not been able to resume
academic studies. Our physical situa
tion has been in constant flux. Other
specific aspects of the dislocation in
clude no access to books or clothing,
no place to study and no way to

satisfy special dietary needs.
Though the physical dislocation is
massive, the psychological effects pres
ent an even greater obstacle to resum
ing normal academic life. The disloca
tion and lack of information have
seriously disrupted and prolonged our
discomfort and inability to cope.
The earthquake has torn apart some
of the most tightly-bound communities.
Re-entering academic life will be a
difficult process. In fact, many may
choose to stop cut for the rest of the
quarter.
Many distractions place demands
upon our time and spirits. Only given
limited time to enter our houses and
retrieve our stuff, occasionally we have
left personal and important materials
behind.
Caught between our desires to
preserve the community of our former
houses and the need to make a new
start as soon as possible, we agonize
over where and with whom to live.
We have a few suggestions and

requests for faculty and students.
Faculty, please make serious adjust
ments in the content of your classes.
Several days disruption, compounded
by moving and resettling, will remove
large sections of students from par
ticipating in your class.
The Row refugees are at a compara
tive disadvantage should requirements
remain unchanged. Please be patient
with your students, especially those
who have not been able to go to class.
If possible, extend your office hours
so people can work out their circum
stances with you. In general, the more
compassionate you are, the better the
reaction and performance of your
students.
Students, please reach out to the
refugees you find in your houses. We
are all at the point where discomfort is
beginnning to creep in. The more open
and understanding you are, the better.
The feeling of imposition will only
make us more uncomfortable as the
weeks progress. If we are stationed in

lounges and public areas, please be
understanding of our sleep and privacy
needs. We are trying to make sure
that you have access to some recrea
tion space.
In general, please be aware of the
serious impact this is having immedi
ately and in the long term on our
lives. We plead for understanding and
consideration before actions are taken.
The hospitality and flexiblity of
residences and professors have been
welcome and are much appreciated.
Lastly, we do wish to thank every
one for their efforts and compassion.
We understand that most members of
the Stanford community are also
stressed and face many of the prob
lems we have encountered. We came
through exceptionally well as a com
munity, especially in light of the
destruction to the surrounding Bay
Area.
