# Food service has a monopoly that allows bad food, inefficiency
## 
### 
The Daily's story on the ASSU
Council of Presidents (Oct. 17), which
dealt in considerable depth with the
issue of creating meal cards for use at
Tresidder, highlighted the primary
failing of University Food Services: its
inability to charge anything less than
an exorbitant rate for its mediocre
food.
All students should be outraged that
a 19-meal quarterly plan costs in ex
cess of $900. This averages out to over

$13 per day, or $4 for lunch and $6.50
for dinner — an excessive cost consid
ering the total number of meals
served.
A particularly galling fact was
revealed when The Daily quoted a food
service official who said the price of
food service meal plans is "based on a
percentage of missed meals." This
seems to imply that if every Stanford
student ate every meal he or she was
entitled to, the cost of a meal plan
would climb even higher!
This reflects the inefficiency which
characterizes the entire food service
system. Despite the high prices stu
dents pay, adequate service is not avail
able, as shown by the 50 or so hasher
vacancies which exist at the beginning

of the year.
Undoubtedly, the problem stems
from two sources. The first is the le
thargic bureacracy of University Food
Services, which, as a monopoly, has no
incentive to improve or to eliminate
abuses, such as paying workers over
time for correcting mistakes on jobs
which were originally done on regular
time or failing to keep accurate records
of incoming shipments and double
ordering an item. I have been told of
these and other incidences of incompe
tence by students who work at food
service.
The other source of the inefficency is
the existence of a powerful union, the
United Stanford Workers, which, in its
efforts to secure high wages, is neces

sarily placed in a position opposed to
the interest of students. Together, un
ion and management have no reason to
disturb the status quo at University
Food Services, a status quo which
benefits everyone but the students.
The solution to these problems, the
solution which is in the interest of all
students, is to break up this monopoly
and start competition for student
patronage among the various dining
halls on campus.
Students desires and demands could
then be met. Only in this way will
students get the quality and service
they deserve.
