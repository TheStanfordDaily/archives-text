# Campus lottery to place 217 homeless students
## 
### Pam Weisz Staff writer 
The 217 students still homeless after
last Tuesday's earthquake learned last
night that they will have housing by
the weekend.
Associate Dean of Student Affairs
Alice Supton told the crowd of students
gathered Tuesday night in the Tres
idder Oak Room that they should come
to the Housing Center between 8 a.m.
and 5 p.m. today to participate in a
lottery for on-campus housing spaces.
Students may draw in groups of up
to 12. The size of the draw groups
had been set at eight, but many stu
dents requested that the number be
greater, Supton said. She added that
12 seems "a fair and good accommoda
tion" of students' needs.
The number each group draws will
determine its place in line on Thursday

night, when students actually choose
their new rooms, according to Bill
Georges, assistant director of the
Housing Center.
There are approximately 253 spaces
available for the displaced students,
although some spaces may be removed
from the list if a large number of
students elect to move off campus and
do not participate in the draw.
The spaces in the draw are in res
idences across campus, from Wilbur
to the Row to Governor's Corner. Stu
dents will be able to move into their
new rooms Friday or Saturday,
Georges said.
The Housing Center created new
student rooms by converting study
rooms and guest rooms and by chang
ing singles to doubles, doubles to
triples, and triples to quads.
For example, the Housing Center
will convert about 30 Lagunita Court

singles into doubles, add a fourth per
son to 63 Manzanita Park trailers, and
change 14 Roble triples into quads.
Supton announced that a plan had
been formulated to address the ques
tion of students with special dietary
needs. Students with special needs who
want to live on campus can fill out a
petition at today's draw which, if ap
proved, will release them from having
to buy a University meal plan if they
live in a University-operated residence.
Normally, students who live in such
residences must buy a meal plan.
The meeting's most heated moments
arose during a discussion of how dis
placed students will be billed. Students
who move off campus will be released
from their housing contracts as of Oct.
17, the day of the earthquake.
However, students who stay on
campus will be charged at the rate of
their original residence through Oct.

27. This means that these students
are being charged for the period during
which they had no housing.
This arrangement evoked hisses and
boos from the crowd of displaced stu
dents. Senior John Cuerva drew ap
plause when he said that, "we find
[being charged for living in a lounge]
unacceptable."
Supton told the students that they
were being charged because, "there
were real costs involved" for the Uni
versity during this period. However,
she promised that University staff
"will keep talking" about the issue.
Keith Guy, director of Housing and
Food Services added, "I think we have
to review this issue."

what will happen if Roth, Theta Xi
and Durand reopen next quarter as
