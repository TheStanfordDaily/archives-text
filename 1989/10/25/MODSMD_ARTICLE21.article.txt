## The old and new homeless
### 
IT WAS LIKE a campuswide slumber
party. Groups of students roamed
about the streets with their sleeping
bags and pillows.
Some people set up tents on their front
lawns. Dorm lounges were covered with
mattresses and blankets. "Where are you
staying?" was heard again and again after
the Oct. 17 quake, as suddenly homeless
students searched for places to sleep.
But the novelty of giant sleepovers and
camping out has worn off by now, and
the reality of being without a home has
hit hundreds of students hard.
People are without their books, clothing
and other personal belongings. Studying
is more difficult than usual. Even sleep
ing is harder â€” a friend of mine spent
the night in her car recently because she
couldn't find a quiet place to sleep.
In the fast-paced Stanford atmosphere,
where people are more likely to worry
about beating the median on a chemistry
midterm than about where their next
meal will come from, losing their home
may be the biggest aftershock students
experience.
People all around the Bay Area who
have had their homes ravaged by the
quake are finding that new homelessness
has thrown their lives into turmoif.
Everyone from the president of the
University to the mayor of San Francisco
to the president of the United States has
realized how devasting sudden displace
ment is for people, and emergency meas
ures have been implemented to reduce
the victims' hardships.
Stanford canceled classes and urged
the faculty to be lenient with assignments

and exams. Cities have set up earthquake
relief shelters with food, clothing and
beds. President Bush and members of
Congress have pledged federal dollars for
assistance, regardless of the effect on a
future budget.
The outpouring of sympathy for the
new homeless has been both well
deserved and overwhelming. It is, how
ever, a stark contrast to the usual public
and government response to the old
homeless, those who had lost their homes
before the quake.
You don't ever see the vice president
helicoptering into the inner cities, smiling
and shaking hands with the street people
to show his support for the old homeless.
You don't often hear members of Con
gress vowing to cut through bureaucratic
red tape so they can rush federal money
to aid the old homeless in rebuilding their
shattered lives.
The media does not normally report
or broadcast urgent pleas calling for dona
tions to the homeless. Huge trucks aren't
usually parked outside Stanford Stadium
on Saturdays to collect food and clothing.
People don't often curse the bad
weather for the hardships it causes for
the homeless.
Why the discrepancy? Are the old and
the new homeless really that different?
Both groups have fallen victim to dis
asters that are often out of their control.
Layoffs, factory closings, fires and rob
beries are much more common than a
huge earthquake and often are as random
and crippling to an individual or family.
Yet the old homeless are often blamed
for their situation, and assistance from

the public and government is minimal.
Federal aid will soon be on the way to
help renovate some of the residences. And
maybe as the new homeless lose that
label, they won't lose the feeling of being
without a home. Hopefully, public sym
pathy and government assistance can be
found for those who lost their homes
Tuesday and for those who lost them
long before.
The quake has sparked extensive cov
erage of the San Andreas Fault, and a
number of pictures of the yawning gap
between the earth's different plates have
appeared. The fault's recent activity has
also shown the gaping division in the
public and the government's reaction to
the old and new homeless. Only one of
these huge fissures must remain perma
nently.
