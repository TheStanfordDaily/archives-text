## Manley must prove assertion of Hoover's 'political mission' 
### 
FOR MANY YEARS Prof. John
Manley has repeatedly charged
the Hoover Institution with being
a politically active think tank with a
"political mission."
To support that charge, he cites
Herbert Hoover's wish that his institu
tion expose the evils of the doctrines
of Karl Marx.
He states that Hoover advances
political causes and seeks to influence
public opinion on behalf of these
causes. Taken together, his statements
convey the impression that the Hoover
leadership and scholars are dedicated to
a "political mission."
Having worked at Hoover for four
teen years, I am still at a loss to
understand what Manley means.
Research and teaching, whether done

at Stanford or Hoover, ultimately
influences public opinion and political
policy, and this should not be a prob
lem for any institution.
The heart of this matter is that
Manley confuses normative thinking
with historical, empirical and analytical
thinking and research.
By failing to distinguish between
these modes of thinking, Manley has
made a serious charge which he has
not proved, so his claim borders on
slander.
Normative thinking reflects an indi
vidual's evaluation of certain desired
standards of behavior and/or perform
ance.
Every individual believes in certain
normative standards for the society.
Herbert Hoover certainly expressed his

normative thinking very sincerely when
he declared that he wanted his institu
tion to study those doctrines that
would threaten his moral vision of the
"good society" for the United States.
But did Hoover really mean to say
that his institution's scholars should
ignore certain facts and argue in sup
port of his normative thinking? I do
not believe so.
The challenge for the scholar and the
professor is to aim at trying to
describe and understand the world
about us and to instruct others in that
same task. Scholars at Hoover and
professors at Stanford carry out their
research to achieve a better under
standing of the physical and human
world.
They attempt to discover distinctive

patterns, test hypotheses, formulate
laws, etc. The criteria for judging the
quality of such work is their honesty
and knowledge to collect and sort facts
and to advance typologies to explain
those facts.
But some cheat and even erroneously
gather their facts to persuade others of
the superiority of their normative
standards. Are scholars at Hoover and
professors at Stanford guilty of that?
Some probably are, and some are not.
Hoover scholars and Stanford profes
sors sometimes direct their research to
policy issues. Effective policy-driven
research tries to avoid confusing
normative thinking with empirical,
historical and analytical research. Good
policy research usually persuades,
because it avoids normative thinking.

If Manley truly believes that Hoover
scholars confuse normative thinking in
their research or that their research is
driven solely by normative thinking, he
should cite examples to prove that
Hoover has a "political mission."
Hoover can only have a "political
mission" if many of its scholars allow
normative thinking to dictate their
research. I urge Manley to examine the
research of Hoover scholars and to
prove his contention of Hoover's "politi
cal mission."
If he cannot do this, then Hoover
research belongs at Stanford, and
Manley should desist from his irrespon
sible charges.
