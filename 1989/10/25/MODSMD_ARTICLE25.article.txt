Q # Besides earrings, what
• are ear lobes good for?
A. Conventional wisdom
• says that the function
of earlobes, and the rest of
the outer ear, is to catch
sound and funnel it down
to the inner ear where the
sound waves are commun
icated to the brain by nerve
impulses. This is all true.
However, the outer ear
also plays an important part
in helping determine the di
rection from which a sound
comes, according to Jeremy
Rice, an engineer at the
Johns Hopkins University
Hearing Sciences Center.
Scientists believe that the
strange folds of the outer
ear cause interference in the
incoming sound waves. Re
flected off the outer ear, dif
ferent parts of a sound wave
reach the eardrum at differ
ent times and create a com
plicated sound pattern
which changes with the di
rection of the sound's
source. Rice said the varia
tion in these patterns helps

your brain determine if a sound
is coming from in front, directly
overhead or behind.
"If you just had a hole in your
head, you'd probably have a very
hard time telling where a sound
is coming from," Rice explained.
Scientists aren't sure if the
outer ear also helps determine the
side-to-side direction of a sound,
or if it is only important for plac
ing sound on the front-to-back
axis. We can usually determine
the side-to-side direction of a
sound because the sound reaches
the near ear slightly earlier than
it reaches the far ear, and the
sound is louder in the ear closer
to the sound's source.
But Rice said there is some
evidence that the outer ear can
play a part in this process, too.
People who are deaf in one ear,
he says, can determine the side
to-side direction of a sound.
