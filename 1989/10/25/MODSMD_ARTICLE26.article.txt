# Buildings can be quake-safe, not quake-proof

Imagine a semi-trailer slam
ming into your building at high
speed. Another hits from the
other side a moment later. This
is the force a structure must
withstand in a violent earthquake.
"Nothing is truly earthquake
proof," said Hjortur Thrainsson,
a graduate student studying seis
mic engineering. When the Big
One hits — with 10 to 100 times
the force of last week's temblor
— engineers expect many build
ings to collapse. Therefore, the
key to a good design is one that
tries to "minimize lost lives," not
stop the building from collapsing.
Engineers have devised a num
ber of ways to design earthquake
safe buildings using a few basic
construction techniques.
In an earthquake, buildings are
jerked side to side, and up and
down and just about every which
way. During the entire quake, the
building must also support its
own weight.
There are many types of build
ings on the campus, from wood
frame buildings on the Row to
the modern reinforced concrete
buildings in Sterling Quad. Each
type reacts very differently to an
earthquake.
Since the earthquake ac
celerates the building back and
forth, the force the building must
bear is proportional to the weight
of the building. Therefore, light
wooden buildings are quite safe
in an earthquake. However, if nat
ural gas lines break during the
quake, the wood buildings can be
come deadly infernos.
The worst kind of building in
an earthquake is unreinforced
masonry. The mortar between the
blocks can give way very easily,
often resulting in complete col
lapse of the building. The
damaged buildings in the Quad
are almost all unreinforced or
under-reinforced masonry. The
reinforced buildings in the Quad
suffered little damage.
Another dangerous type of
building uses infill walls. The

frame may be steel and concrete,
but the walls are filled with rubble
or other masonry. These walls of
ten collapse during an earthquake
and cause the outer supporting
walls to take much more weight
from the upper floors than they
were originally designed to do.
The best kind of building is
made of reinforced concrete. A
building with a steel frame and
concrete surrounding the frame
will bend with the force of the
quake without breaking. By Cal
ifornia law, reinforced concrete
must be used in high-rise build
ings.
Steel reinforcement must be
done properly to prevent the con
crete from spilling out of the pil
lars. In the past, columns were
square with steel rods running up
and down through them. Modern
columns are round and use a
spiral of steel wrapped around the
concrete to keep the concrete and
steel topether. Old columns on the
Nimitz freeway in Oakland ex
ploded and were unable to hold
the top deck of the freeway up,
leading to the loss of dozens of
lives.
Not only the materials used in
a building, but its overall design
can help it survive an earthquake.
Non-symmetrical buildings will
bend and twist under the force of
a quake, breaking the building
apart.
The connections between asym
metrical portions of a building are
often damaged the most. On the
Bay Bridge, the roadway collapsed
at the point where the incline sec
tion and the truss section meet.
Clearly, however, some asym
metrical buildings survived the
quake just fine. Those buildings
use a clever, yet simple design to
transform an asymmetrical build
ing into two or more symmetrical
ones.
Rubber or foam expansion
joints cushion two adjacent parts
of a building or two adjacent build
ings so they rock independently
in an earthquake. At Braun Music
Center, the wings of the building

are separated by an expansion
joint that runs through the box
office window. At Terman Engi
neering Building, the wings of the
L-shaped building are also
separated so they can sway sepa
rately in an earthquake.
The new Beckman Center for
Molecular and Genetic Medicine
has a seismic joint, too, which
prevented any significant struc
tural damage to the building.
Another form of asymmetry is
asymmetrical floors in a building.
For example, Terman's columns
are of two different sizes, so the
smaller ones take more of the load
in an earthquake. Thrainsson said
he was "surprised how well it be
haved."


Above: Uneven and incorrectly reinforced support columns and the structure s asymmetry contribute
to this building's poor earthquake design. Below: A concrete column with spiral steel reinforcements
is better than a square one with straight reinforcements.
