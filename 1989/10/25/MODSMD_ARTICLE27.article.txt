# Wait on buying into uncertain Font Wars
## 
### Mark Rogowsky Senior staff writer 
Editor's note: This is the last in
a three-part series on the so-called
Font Wars that are shaking up
the computer industry.

With Apple's announcement of
a upgrade to the system
software, the Font Wars heated
up in earnest. As consumers, the
important ipsue for us to consider
is what Apple's new technology
will mean and how we should ad
just qur purchases.
Will the company stop licensing
Postscript from Adobe for its
printers? If so, will they make
Postscript clones based on the
Microsoft technology? Will said
clones be 100 percent compatible
— an absolute necessity for many
applications?
The two sides are trying to line
up as many type vendors as pos-

sible behind their
standards. Adobe
had previously
guarded the techni
cal specifications
for their fonts. The
Apple-Microsoft al
liance forced them
to open up.
Apple has said
from the beginning
that their specifica-

tions are open to anyone who is
interested.
For the past year, the shelves
have been crowded with an ever
increasing selection of fonts. In
the next 12 months, they may be
crowded with two sets of the same
fonts — a Postscript version and
a Royal version.
Adobe clouded the picture fur
ther with the introduction of
Adobe Type Manager, a new piece
of software for Macintoshes. ATM,
as it is called, allows you to use

Adobe fonts on any
printer while gener
ating high-quality
screen fonts as well.
If this sounds like
Royal, you're obvi
ously paying close
attention. ATM
delivers today what
Royal promises to
bring with System
7 0 — as lone as

you're willing to use Adobe fonts.
Visit a local computer store and
ask them to demonstrate ATM on
the Imagewriter and the Hewlett-
Packard Deskwriter. For starters,
you'll be amazed at how good Im
agewriter output can be when it's
optimized.
Then, you should be startled to
see that the under-sl,ooo
Deskwriter can produce text that
looks as good as a $5,000
LaserWriter. Adobe Type Manager

costs $99 plus the cost of fonts
(about $125 for a family that in
cludes plain, bold, italic and bold
italic in a single typeface like Hel
vetica).
The best advice at this point
seems to be wait and see. If you
already own a Postscript printer
and want to purchase new fonts,
feel free to go ahead. Postscript
and Adobe are here to stay, and
Apple is not about to dis
enfranchise the countless
LaserWriter owners out there.
If you can put off buying, how
ever, do so. If Apple does dump
Postscript from its new printers
and use the Microsoft clone, they
should be able to lower prices
since they won't have to pay
Adobe a licensing fee.
In coming weeks, we'll get A
closer look at the Deskwriter and
H-P's new Laseijet lIP, an $1,100
laser printer with a bright future.
