For Stanford athletics, the third
try against the top-ranked team
in the country turned out to be
a charm. As the final seconds of
the 120-minute game ran out on
the No. 1 Tar Heels at Harry
Maloney Field yesterday, the
jubilant No. 20 Cardinal pointed
to the unchanged scoreboard and
celebrated, in the tradition of
men's basketball victories over Ar
izona, "The Miracle at Maloney."
"This gives us a landmark in
the progress of the women's soccer
program," Coach Berhane An
deberhan said.
The Tar Heels (19-0-1) came to
Stanford looking to complete a
perfect 20-0 season and head back
to the ACC Tournament with an
unchallenged path to their eighth
straight appearance in the NCAA
championship game. North
Carolina had recorded 22 straight

victories and had destroyed No.
9 Santa Clara 4-0 and No. 18 St.
Mary's 5-0 in the last week.
Wait! In the last two seasons,
Stanford (10-4-2) has created its
own name in women's soccer. The
Cardinal has outscored opponents
this season at Maloney Field 36-1
and has not lost on the home turf
since Oct. 20, 1988. Since then
Stanford has posted its own 10-
game unbeaten streak at home.
"As the Stanford coach, I felt
we would kick them around," An
deberhan said. "As a dispas
sionate soccer expert, I didn't
think we had a chance against
them."
In the early minutes of the
game, the tension of playing the
top-ranked team was very evident
in the play of the Cardinal. With
tentative attacks and cautious
passing, Stanford attempted to

figure out at what level of play
this Tar Heel team played.
"We were looking to give the
players a measuring stick for top
notch soccer," Andeberhan said.
Early in the game, junior goalie
Elise Edwards let the team know
the level she expected. With many
diving saves, which became com
monplace later in the game, Ed
wards' play ignited the Cardinal
to the Tar Heel level.
"I didn't think I was having an
exceptional game," Edwards said.
"I just came into the game
prepared to play."
Stanford responded to Ed
wards' incredible play by slowly
gaining confidence. Instead of
panicking as the Tar Heels exhib
ited their superb team skills,
organization and speed, the Car
dinal began to challenge North
Carolina for each ball and stuck
to a very deliberate game plan.
As the Tar Heels continued to
dominate ball control, the Cardi
nal worked the clock down and
sent various offenders on spurts
