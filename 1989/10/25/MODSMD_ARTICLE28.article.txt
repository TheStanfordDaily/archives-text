For Stanford athletics, the third
try against the top-ranked team
in the country turned out to be
a charm. As the final seconds of
the 120-minute game ran out on
the No. 1 Tar Heels at Harry
Maloney Field yesterday, the
jubilant No. 20 Cardinal pointed
to the unchanged scoreboard and
celebrated, in the tradition of
men's basketball victories over Ar
izona, "The Miracle at Maloney."
"This gives us a landmark in
the progress of the women's soccer
program," Coach Berhane An
deberhan said.
The Tar Heels (19-0-1) came to
Stanford looking to complete a
perfect 20-0 season and head back
to the ACC Tournament with an
unchallenged path to their eighth
straight appearance in the NCAA
championship game. North
Carolina had recorded 22 straight

victories and had destroyed No.
9 Santa Clara 4-0 and No. 18 St.
Mary's 5-0 in the last week.
Wait! In the last two seasons,
Stanford (10-4-2) has created its
own name in women's soccer. The
Cardinal has outscored opponents
this season at Maloney Field 36-1
and has not lost on the home turf
since Oct. 20, 1988. Since then
Stanford has posted its own 10-
game unbeaten streak at home.
"As the Stanford coach, I felt
we would kick them around," An
deberhan said. "As a dispas
sionate soccer expert, I didn't
think we had a chance against
them."
In the early minutes of the
game, the tension of playing the
top-ranked team was very evident
in the play of the Cardinal. With
tentative attacks and cautious
passing, Stanford attempted to

figure out at what level of play
this Tar Heel team played.
"We were looking to give the
players a measuring stick for top
notch soccer," Andeberhan said.
Early in the game, junior goalie
Elise Edwards let the team know
the level she expected. With many
diving saves, which became com
monplace later in the game, Ed
wards' play ignited the Cardinal
to the Tar Heel level.
"I didn't think I was having an
exceptional game," Edwards said.
"I just came into the game
prepared to play."
Stanford responded to Ed
wards' incredible play by slowly
gaining confidence. Instead of
panicking as the Tar Heels exhib
ited their superb team skills,
organization and speed, the Car
dinal began to challenge North
Carolina for each ball and stuck
to a very deliberate game plan.
As the Tar Heels continued to
dominate ball control, the Cardi
nal worked the clock down and
sent various offenders on spurts

toward the North Carolina goal.
With under five seconds left in
the first half, Edwards had to
knock off one of the most potent
attacks by the Tar Heels. Edwards
reacted to a Tar Heel bicycle kick
less than 10 yards in front of the
goal by punching the ball over the
goalpost to preserve the deadlock
for halftime.
"We were solid," said Tar Heel
Coach Anson Dorrance, who is
also the U.S. National Team
coach. "We didn't show anything
spectacular, but we didn't play
poorly. Stanford did really well."
In the second half, the crowd
of about 250 began to realize the
gravity of the scoreless game.
Every time junior Jennifer "Rock
et" Rowland pressured the Tar
Heel defense, sophomore Heather
Mclntyre calmly snuck the ball
beneath the feet of North Carolina
attackers, or freshman Julie
Foudy left three or four Tar Heels
watching her move past them, the
crowd released yells of excitement.
"The crowd was wonderful,"
Andeberhan said. "I heard so
much noise."
By the second half, Stanford
presented the home crowd with a
little of the physical play that it
learned on its latest trip to Vir
ginia. The Cardinal matched
every Tar Heel elbow and push
with its own counter attack.
Senior Christine "Psycho" Mar
tin exerted the Cardinal muscle
by continually beating Tar Heel
freshman Mia Hamm, a U.S. Na
tional Team player, and forcing
her off the ball.
"I was having a good time,"
Andeberhan said. "It was a party
the whole way."
Toward the end of the game
and in the overtime, the Tar
Heels, unaccustomed to such a

close game, began to exhibit
cracks in their undefeated shield.
As Stanford continued to gain
confidence and played virtually
equally with North Carolina in
the overtime, the Tar Heel coach
ing contingency stood and
watched with faces of amazement.
North Carolina freshman Rita
Tower threw her arms in the air
in frustration as the Cardinal
blocked off numerous Tar Heel
attacks.
"Usually we don't get as many
shots on goal," Dorrance said.
"But usually we score a few
more."
With less than nine minutes left
in the overtime, North Carolina
senior superstar Shannon Hig
gins, the 1988 National Player of
the Year, forced Edwards to dive
to her left and punch the ball onto
the right upper corner of the goal
post. The Tar Heels picked up the
reflection right in front of the
goal, and Edwards made an
acrobatic dive forward to block
the shot.
With less than five seconds left
in the game, Edwards finished off
her exceptional display by darting
to her left to smother the ball
and preserve the scoreless tie.
"It's a compliment to their pro
gram to see how jubilated we are
with the tie," Andeberhan said.
Indeed, the Tar Heel program
can still boast a 90-game unbeaten
streak, stretching back to the
1985 NCAA final and its fourth
straight undefeated regular
season.
Stanford, on the other hand,
hopes to use this game's perform
ance to springboard into the 12-
team NCAA tournament.
"There is no question that
Stanford is in the top-12," Dor
rance said. "They are well
organized and play very attrac
tively. They certainly should be
one of the teams in the tourna
ment."
