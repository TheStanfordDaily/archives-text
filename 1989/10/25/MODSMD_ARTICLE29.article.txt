# Stanford's scoreless tie represents a gigantic goal

A map of women's soccer power
houses would have dots in all sorts
of different places. In the East,
there'd be dots in Chapel Hill, N.C. and
Charlottesville, Va., among others. Along
the way to the West, you'd find a fairly
good sized spot in Colorado Springs, Colo.
Finally, in the Bay Area, Santa Clara
and Moraga would be prominently fea
tured. Yesterday, at Maloney Field a new
dot was penciled on the map, and that
dot is in Stanford, Calif.
Only two years ago, the women's soccer
team was 4-11-4 under new Coach Ber
hane Andeberhan. Last season, the team
improved immeasurably and finished at
13-4-1. In 1989, however, the program
has made its breakthrough.
With a 0-0 tie of North Carolina yes
terday, the Cardinal accomplished what
few others have. The Tar Heels have
vwn 84 of their last 90 games — the
other six ended in deadlocks.
What Stanford accomplished was no
fluke, either. The team played a great
game. Goalkeeper Elise Edwards played
an otherwordly game.

Though the North Carolina players had
more polished soccer skills and a good
deal more team speed, the Cardinal
stayed with them for all 120 minutes.
Andeberhan attributed the team's success
to a lack of mental lapses. He noted that
when a Stanford player got beaten, she
was instantly aware of it and was able
to quickly recover.
It was the best team collegiate women's
soccer has ever known, sporting a large
contingent from the U.S. National Team,
versus a young upstart that can play
with the best team despite offering a

grand total of zero scholarships. And it
was quite a sight to see.
The intensity and enthusiasm that
emanated from the Cardinal women was
a pleasant reminder of all the good in
college sports. There are no recruiting
violations associated with women's soccer
at Stanford. None of the players have
been arrested for driving drunk. They
can all read and will probably graduate.
They play soccer for the love of the
game, never holding out the false hope
that they'll someday be professional ath
letes. Some, like freshman Julie Foudy,
turned down a free education for the
chance to come to Stanford. Together,
they comprise a terrific team.
Stanford was able to stay on the field
with North Carolina because the whole
of the squad is greater than the sum of
its parts. Andeberhan explained that
while the Tar Heels may have more tal
ent, they don't place the same focus on
the team concept as he does.
That's not to say Stanford doesn't have
its stars. Foudy would be one of the best
players at North Carolina if she were

there. Edwards has proven time and
again that she's among the upper echelon
of goalkeepers.
Stanford's most exciting star, though,
is Jennifer Rowland. It would be near
impossible to come up with a better nick
name for her than "Rocket." It seemed
yesterday that if the Cardinal was ever
going to score, it would be on a Rocket
breakaway.
The casual sports fan, who knows little

or nothing about soccer, is probably won
dering how a 0-0 tie can be anything
short of an interminable bore. Sure, there
are ties in ice hockey but rarely 0-0 ties.
To them, I suggest a visit to Maloney
Field this weekend to watch the women
play
Aside from the fact that its a chance
to watch magnificent athletes in action,
it will provide an opportunity to learn to
appreciate the world's most popular
sport.
By the way, the team will need a strong
finish to quaJify for the 12-team NCAA
playoffs. The two most important games
remaining are against Wisconsin and UC-
Santa Barbara.
Wins in those contests would almost
certainly earn the team their first-ever
NCAA bid. That would turn the penciled
in dot on the map into one drawn with
indelible ink. -•

stayed with them for all 120 minutes.
Andeberhan attributed the team's success
to a lack of mental lapses. He noted that
when a Stanford player got beaten, she
was instantly aware of it and was able
to quickly recover.
It was the best team collegiate women's
soccer has ever known, sporting a large
contingent from the U.S. National Team,
versus a young upstart that can play
with the best team despite offering a

grand total of zero scholarships. And it
was quite a sight to see.
The intensity and enthusiasm that
emanated from the Cardinal women was
a pleasant reminder of all the good in
college sports. There are no recruiting
violations associated with women's soccer
at Stanford. None of the players have
been arrested for driving drunk. They
can all read and will probably graduate.
They play soccer for the love of the
game, never holding out the false hope
that they'll someday be professional ath
letes. Some, like freshman Julie Foudy,
turned down a free education for the
chance to come to Stanford. Together,
they comprise a terrific team.
Stanford was able to stay on the field
with North Carolina because the whole
of the squad is greater than the sum of
its parts. Andeberhan explained that
while the Tar Heels may have more tal
ent, they don't place the same focus on
the team concept as he does.
That's not to say Stanford doesn't have
its stars. Foudy would be one of the best
players at North Carolina if she were

there. Edwards has proven time and
again that she's among the upper echelon
of goalkeepers.
Stanford's most exciting star, though,
is Jennifer Rowland. It would be near
impossible to come up with a better nick
name for her than "Rocket." It seemed
yesterday that if the Cardinal was ever
going to score, it would be on a Rocket
breakaway.
The casual sports fan, who knows little

or nothing about soccer, is probably won
dering how a 0-0 tie can be anything
short of an interminable bore. Sure, there
are ties in ice hockey but rarely 0-0 ties.
To them, I suggest a visit to Maloney
Field this weekend to watch the women

Aside from the fact that its a chance
to watch magnificent athletes in action,
it will provide an opportunity to learn to
appreciate the world's most popular
sport.
By the way, the team will need a strong
finish to quaJify for the 12-team NCAA
playoffs. The two most important games
remaining are against Wisconsin and UC-
Santa Barbara.
Wins in those contests would almost
certainly earn the team their first-ever
NCAA bid. That would turn the penciled
in dot on the map into one drawn with
indelible ink. -•
