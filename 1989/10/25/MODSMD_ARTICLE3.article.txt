# Community centers reopen in Old Union, Firehouse
## 
### Sherromba Barbee Staff writer 
Three University community centers
were displaced from the Old Union
Clubhouse and the Fire Truck House
for nearly a week by the Oct. 17 earth
quake, though they will be able to
move back into their homes today.
The displaced centers were the Asian
American Activities Center, the Les
bian, Gay and Bisexual Community
Center and the Native American Cul
tural Center. Numerous other student
organizations were also barred from
the Fire Truck House.
There was no serious structural
damage in either building, but they
had remained closed so the University

could check for asbestos contamina
tion, according to Renee Richter, the
Student Organization Services office
assistant. The ballroom in the Club
house did sustain some structural
damage and will be closed indefinitely,
Richter said.
The LGBCC offices were shut down
by the building closure, although
LGBCC officer Toni Long said some
support groups were moved to rooms
in Meyer Library.
"It didn't seem to shake things up
too badly," Long said. "Considering
how old that building is, we're lucky
there's no structural damage."
The Native American and Asian-
American centers were moved out of

Old Union Clubhouse into the base
ment of The Nitery with El Centro
Chicano.
"El Centro has been wonderful," said
Richter. "They've taken in all sorts of
groups."
El Centro was heavily used because
it was the only available community
center that is centrally located. Several
groups that normally meet in the Club
house met in El Centro instead.
"We felt neighborly," said El Centro
staff member Charlene Aguilar. "It's
something that adds a lot of life around
here. We eryoyed their company."
The centers were able to continue
most of their activities, mainly because
El Centro reorganized to obtain more

space and brought over extra comput
ers and lights.
Originally, the El Centro staff
thought the visitors would be staying
for as long as two weeks.
Elsa Tsutaoka, an Asian American
Activities Center staff member, said
the people at El Centro were "very
nice, very welcoming."
Understandably, however, Tsutaoka
was very happy that the center was
able to move back into its offices.
"We're not displaced anymore," she
said exultantly.
"A lot of us were really concerned
about when we would be able to move
back," Tsutaoka explained. "A lot of
our job is to be there for the (Asian-
American] community."
