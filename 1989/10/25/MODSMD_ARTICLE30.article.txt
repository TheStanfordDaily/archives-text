# Undefeated Betas blitz KAs in IMs
## 
### Rob Johnstone 
Despite an earthquake and a
49ers-shortened intramural
schedule, there wasn't a shortage
of action in IM sports this week.
Defense was the key in IM foot
ball — some teams had it and
won, and others didn't and got
blown out.

IM sports report

In the week's best defensive
struggle, undefeated AE Pi went
up against the similarly unde
feated Invisible Hands (the grad
uate school of economics) in a B
league football game Friday. Andy
Dick of the Invisible Hands pro
vided all of the scoring when he
caught a 10-yard touchdown pass
1 midway through the first half to
put the Hands up 6-0.
Both teams had several oppor
! tunities to score in the second
; half, but neither team could con
vert its opportunities into touch
downs. With 2:30 to play in the
; game, AE Pi, still trailing 6-0,
was unable to get the first down
on a crucial 4th-and-10 deep in
Invisible Hands territory.
Not content to run out the clock
! with two minutes remaining, the
Hands went to the pass and got
burned. AE Pi cornerback Kevin
Wasserstein dove in front of the
intended Invisible Hands receiver
to make a spectacular interception
on the Hands' 30-yard line. Un
• fortunately for AE Pi, they failed
• to take advantage of their good
\ fortune.
Quarterback Scott Fox's pass
into the end zone on 3rd-and-12
was intercepted by Andrew Dick
of the Invisible Hands with 1:20
to play, sealing a hard-earned 6-0
» victory for the still-undefeated
J Hands.
« Dick said of his touchdown
! reception and key interception, "I
• did it for the team or my
• girlfriend."
In another tough defensive bat
tle, Toyon'a B team overcame
Cedro by a score of 13-0. Sean
\ Nash of Toyon broke a scoreless
• tie late in the first half when he
intercepted an errant Cedro pass

and scampered 45 yards into the
endzone for a 6-0 Toyon lead.
Toyon padded its lead in the sec
ond half with a seven-yard touch
down pass to Geoff Carter to
make the final 13-0.
"Our offense needs to be more
consistent. Our defense is strong
enough to take it all," said Nash.
Interfraternity intramural
matches are typically hard-fought,
intense contests with close out
comes. In Thursday's B league
game between the KAs and the
Betas, this was not the case as
the Betas jumped to an early 28-0
lead and cruised to a 41-0 victory.
The Betas picked off eight
passes, including cornerback
Chris Toft's five interceptions.
Toft also racked up three touch
down receptions on offense, as
quarterback Craig Owen threw
for four touchdowns and ran for
another.
The Betas are now 3-0 and still
unscored upon, having outscored
their opponents 66-0 in their three
games. Beta lineman Bill Harris
put the KA game and the Betas'
incredible start into perspective
by stating, "We can't get cocky;
we've played some weaker teams.
We have to go out and play hard
every week to win."
The Betas will have their hands
full this Thursday as they take
on the also undefeated SAE II
team.
In volleyball action this week,
Biz IC's B team overcame a dis
heartening first game loss to come
back and beat Florence Moore, 15-
17, 17-15, 15-9.
In coed action, Alpha Sig also
came back from a first game loss
to beat Dirk's Jerks, 10-15, 15-10,
15-13.
