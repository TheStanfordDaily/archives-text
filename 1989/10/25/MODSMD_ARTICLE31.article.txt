# San Jose deflates Stanford spikers
## 
### David Earnest Senior staff writer 
SAN JOSE, Calif. - The Stan
ford women's volleyball team set
out to prove something last night.
And they did. Unfortunately, it
wasn't what they hoped to prove.
By losing to unranked San Jose
State 15-8, 10-15, 15-6, 15-10, the
Cardinal demonstrated that the
early season losses, the inconsis
tent play and the poor passing
was not just a fluke. No, this team
is not as good as it's supposed to
be.

Stanford, in spite of a .273 team
hitting percentage, was unable to
stop the Spartan's simple offense
that hit .406 and toyed all night
with the Cardinal blockers.
"We played poorly, all the way
around, every phase of the game,"
Stanford Coach Don Shaw said.
"We did not play well. We deserved
to lose."
The Spartans, after dominating
games one and three, won a tough
game four to take the match.
After Stanford tied the final game
at 4-4, San Jose State raced out
to 9-4 and 11-6 leads and looked

ready to take the match. But hit
ter Kristin Klein brought the Car
dinal back to 11-10 with two kills
and a block.
San Jose State then won a side
out and Spartan outside hitter
Mona Sualua, whose jump serve
perplexed Stanford all night long,
served out the match.
Stanford did win the second
game in spite of a Spartan surge
that threatened the Cardinal's
early lead. After being up 8-0,
Stanford let San Jose State pull
to within two points at 12-10.
Shaw then called a time-out, and
the Cardinal came out and rallied
to win the game.
Stanford, which had not played
a match in 10 days due to last
week's earthquake, may have been
sluggish due to the layoff, accord
ing to Spartan Coach Dick Mont
gomery.
"I think they were a little flat
tonight," he said. "I was kind of
banking to a certain degree that
. . . maybe they would be flat. It
seemed to me that they were off
their game and we took advantage
of that."
But Shaw felt that the earth
quake was no excuse for the loss.
"We were accountable for what
we did tonight," he said. "We did
a lousy job . . . for whatever
reasons. 1 have no idea why. If I

to middle blocker Heather
McPherson, who was able to easily
hit around the Stanford blockers.
Often the Cardinal was unable to
present more than one blocker in
the middle.
"A lot of the time, there were
balls we could have blocked and
should have blocked and didn't,"
outside hitter Bev Oden said. "It
was the same play over and over
again."
