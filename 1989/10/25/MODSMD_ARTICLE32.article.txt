# Men's soccer plays spoiler against Dons
## 
### Andrew Wilcox Staff writer 
Coming off a disappointing 1-1
tie to rival California Sunday, the
Cardinal men's soccer team will
try to rebound against another
Bay Area rival, the University of
San Francisco, today at USF's
Negoesco Stadium at 2:30.
The game was originally sched
uled to be played at Burlingame
High School last night but was
relocated because of poor field
conditions at Burlingame.
Although the Stanford squad is
out of the NCAA playoff picture
with a 7-7-2 mark on the year.

the Cardinal still has a chance to
alter the postseason makeup by
playing the role of spoiler the rest
of the way.
A win over USF would effec
tively eliminate the 8-6-2 Dons

from the playoff race. USF,
ranked seventh in the West, is on
the brink for postseason conten
tion, as six teams will probably
be selected from the West.
After a lackluster effort in the
second half of the tie with Cali
fornia, the Stanford squad will
need a stronger showing against
the Dons, a young team without
any superstars but a strong mid
field line anchored by junior
Robert Aparacio and senior Tim
McEnery.
The USF defense is led by fresh
man Troy Dayak, who played for
the San Francisco Bay Black
hawks last summer with Cardinal

stars Rhett Harty and Mark Semi
oli.
Although he expressed concern
about the Dons' midfielders, Car
dinal Coach Sam Koch said, "Men
tal preparation is the key factor
for us. We above all have got to
worry about our own perform
ance, not about the other team."
The Cardinal will have to cope
with injury problems, as defensive
stalwart Tim Keyes, who missed
the California game, is still ques
tionable with a bad toe, and
midfielders Wade Colwell and
Bing Kongmebhol are both out
with twisted ankles.
