# Champ netters volley into action

The four-time defending NCAA
champion Stanford women's ten
nis team will initiate its 1989
season Thursday at the Riviera
All-America Championships, the
first leg of the Intercollegiate Ten
nis Coaches Association Grand
Slam.
The Cardinal, the consensus
number one team in the nation
according to preseason polls, will
showcase its four returning Ail-
Americans, Sandra Birch, Debbie
Graham, Teri Whitlinger and Lisa
Green, in addition to freshman
standout Meredith McGrath in
the 32-player main draw of the
tournament.
Sophomore Kylie Johnson and
freshman Heather Willens at
tempted to qualify for the main
draw yesterday but fell short.
Johnson lost a first-round match
to Kentucky's Susan Klingenberg,
4-6, 7-5, 6-4. Willens bested Laura
Glitz of Arizona State in the first
round, 6-3, 7-6, 6-1. She was then
defeated by UCLA's Mamie
Ceniza, 7-6, 7-5.
In doubles, Johnson and Wil
lens advanced in the qualifying
bracket with a 6-1, 6-1 victory over
Anna Funderburk and Kimberly
Chang of BYU.

The seven Stanford entries
more than doubles the number of
qualifiers from the nearest oppos
ing teams, Georgia and USC.
With a field featuring 23 of the
top 35 seeded players in the coun
try, the tournament offers a prime
opportunity to "evaluate your
own players and to check on the
competition," Stanford Coach
Frank Brennan said. "As an added
benefit, the Southern California
region is a very fertile area for
recruiting."
Nevertheless, Brennan refrains
from placing too much emphasis
on the event. "Although Riviera
may provide an initial indication
of what we're able to do, we do
not gear ourselves in practice for
this tournament at all," Brennan
stated.
Sandra Birch, last year's NCAA
singles champion and the runner
up at the Ail-American tourna
ment, agreed, "Coach Brennan
tends not to emphasize the early
individual tournaments (like
Riviera)."
Regardless, Stanford's record
here has been nearly flawless.
Last year, the team produced
three of the four semi-finalists
and both finalists in the compe
tition, compiling a daunting 16-1
record against non-team oppo
nents.

Considering the depth of this
year's returning players in tan
dem with the sterling group of
freshmen, similar results are ex
pected.
Birch will lead the Cardinal as
sault as the consensus number
one player in the country as de
termined by the Volvo Tennis as
sociation of coaches. She will be
joined by Debbie Graham, the
third-ranked player in the country
in preseason, fourth-ranked Lisa
Green as well as McGrath, ranked
ninth nationally despite being
only a freshman. Fifteenth-ranked
Ten Whitlinger rounds out the
Stanford assault.
The squad will also feature the
doubles team of Birch and
Graham, last year's runner-ups at
the NCAA tournament, in addi
tion to the newly-created team of
McGrath and Whitlinger.
Birch, who has not played a
tournament since the U.S. Open,
promises that her NCAA champi
onship in '88-'B9 will not compro
mise her "out to kill mentality."
She has indicated that she is in
the process of ongoing improve
ment and will display a newly
developed one-hand backhand, a
harder top-spin ground stroke, a
more aggressive approach game
and a different serve style to im
prove velocity.

McGrath, whose astounding
preseason ranking, according to
Brennan, is a "tribute to her bril
liant juniors career," will unleash
her merciless serve-and-volley
game for the first time as a mem
ber of the Cardinal. Having
worked hard in the preseason,
McGrath "expects to play well"
in singles and is especially "ex
cited about playing with Teri
Whitlinger in doubles."
Riviera is of particular interest
to freshman Heather Willens who
today left with Kylie Johnson to
play in the qualifying tournament.
A member of the Riviera tennis
club and resident of the area, Wil
lens believes she is "ready" to play
her first Cardinal tournament
before her home crowd.
Perhaps the only disheartening
pre-tournament note is the array
of minor injuries the team has
suffered. Teri Whitlinger, who felt
soreness in her shoulder, was un
able to practice at times last week.
Her doubles teammate, Meredith
McGrath, sustained a minor knee
injury during a bike accident and
likewise missed several practice
sessions.
Nevertheless, Brennan assures
that "although the timing is bad,
the players will all be 100 percent
by tournament time."
