# Nine volunteers inspect Row
## 
### David Hirning Editorial staff 
Although the Stanford commu
nity emerged relatively unscathed
from last Tuesday's devastating
earthquake, there was still occa
sion for some bravery on campus.
At 5:04 p.m., Row and Cluster
Facilities staff member Barbara
Tiernan suddenly had a crisis on
her hands. Her office needed a
thorough, on-foot review of the
Row but lacked the staff to do it.
"Immediately after the earth
quake, we received calls for help
from several fraternities," she
said. "At that time there were
only three employees remaining
at the [office]. We realized we
were limited and asked house rep
resentatives to send reliable vol
unteers."
Nine students responded to
Tiernan's request for help, and
spent the remainder of the night
making sure the Row and its res
idents were safe.
"These students went way be
yond what you expect in this sit
uation. We couldn't have done it
without them," Tiernan said, add
ing that some of the students were
faced with traumatic situations
themselves.
Three volunteers — Becky Fen
nerty, Alexander Brietzke and

Don Mordecai — who lived in Phi
Psi have since had their own
house closed for the year.
"I called Row Facilities to let
them know our house was okay,
and they told me they needed
some volunteers," said Justin
Hayes, a junior who is Whitman
House's kitchen manager. "I gath
ered up a few people and sent
them over, and I went over later
after checking our kitchen and
house."
Hayes and Shari Gelber, a soph
omore living in Whitman who has
emergency medical technician
training, suggested to Tiernan
that a room search for injured
residents was needed.
"We just wanted to make sure
no one was trapped under a col
lapsed loft or anything," said
Hayes. "Over 50 percent of the
RAs (on the Row) hadn't done a
room check yet, and they thought
it was a good idea, so we went in
with them."
The volunteers also made
damage inspections, visiting the
mtyority of the Row houses and
writing down what they observed.
Often, they were the first facilities
representatives to visit the houses,
and they delivered the warning
from Row Facilities for students
not to enter the residences.
The students worked from five

to 10 minutes after the quake un
til 9 or 10 p.m. that evening.
Nadin Maluf, an eating associ
ate at Hammarskjold, called Row
Facilities after the quake to in
quire about the house's gas lines.
After turning off the gas there,
he went up and down the Row,
and turned off the gas at four or
five houses.
"Most houses didn't (turn off
the gas]," said Maluf, an engineer
ing graduate student. "I didn't
find any gas leaks, at least I didn't
smell any, but I was just making
sure," he said.
The volunteers entered several
severely damaged houses, includ
ing Grove Lasuen and Columbae,
but most seemed to feel the risk
was acceptably low.
"I was a little concerned, going
into Columbae," said Joseph Mar
tinez, a junior, "[but] we felt that
nothing would fall down unless
there was an aftershock."
"I hadn't really thought about
the possibility of aftershocks,"
said Matthew Dalva, a senior
living in Whitman. "All the houses
we went into didn't seem in dan
ger of falling down.
"We just wanted to make sure
no one was knocked out in their
room or hurt. We didn't find any
thing like that, fortunately," he
said.
