# Safety study excluded Row
## 1985 earthquake safety survey assumed houses were sound 
### Liz Lempert Staff writer 
The University did not include
Row houses in its 1985 earth
quake safety survey because it as
sumed they were seismically
sound.
Prior to last Tuesday's quake,
Stanford considered its Row
houses to be "by and large in bet
ter shape" to withstand a quake
than older structures made of con
crete, according to John Hughes,
assistant provost for facilities
planning.
Buildings on the Row were
either constructed of wood or
built after 1934, when earthquake
safety standards became law,
Hughes said.
Hughes said the basic struc
tural upkeep of co-ops and self-ops
does fall under University juris
diction, but the safety of these
buildings was not considered to
be in jeopardy.
"We didn't really have any rea
son to check the houses on the

Row," Hughes said. "We didn't
foresee that we'd have trouble
there."
However Jay Heyman, a dis
placed Columbae resident, said
"[Columbae] certainly never
struck me as being structurally
sound."
Row houses have long been the
"bastard children of housing fa
cilities," Heyman said. He specu
lated that Stanford was reluctant
to put money into old houses.
Even before the earthquake,
Columbae was "in a general state
of disrepair," he said. But al
though it may have been run
down, "I don't think any of us
thought of [Columbae] as unsafe,"
Heyman said.
"I don't feel the University has
dealt badly with this," he added.
"I'm not sure what they would
have done."
Stanford's assumption that the
wood-framed Row houses could
withstand a quake was "techni
cally very justified," according to
Fouad Bendimerad, assistant pro

fessor of civil engineering. "But
earthquakes always prove you
wrong."
In past earthquakes, wood
framed buildings sustained less
damage in general than those built
with other materials, he said.
"It's still true" that wood build
ings are safer than those built of
unreinforced concrete, Ben
dimerad said. "None of [the Row
housesl collapsed, and most did
not suffer structural damage," he
added.
Wood structures are more
flexible and pliable than concrete
and will not crack and crumble
during an earthquake, explained
Assoc. Civil Engineering Prof.
Anne Kiremidjian.
Concrete buildings can collapse
and seriously injure people, Ben
dimerad noted.
While wood is a safer building
material than unreinforced con
crete, "reinforced concrete is
much better than wood,"
