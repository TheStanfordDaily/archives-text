# Safety study excluded Row
## 1985 earthquake safety survey assumed houses were sound 
### Liz Lempert Staff writer 
The University did not include
Row houses in its 1985 earth
quake safety survey because it as
sumed they were seismically
sound.
Prior to last Tuesday's quake,
Stanford considered its Row
houses to be "by and large in bet
ter shape" to withstand a quake
than older structures made of con
crete, according to John Hughes,
assistant provost for facilities
planning.
Buildings on the Row were
either constructed of wood or
built after 1934, when earthquake
safety standards became law,
Hughes said.
Hughes said the basic struc
tural upkeep of co-ops and self-ops
does fall under University juris
diction, but the safety of these
buildings was not considered to
be in jeopardy.
"We didn't really have any rea
son to check the houses on the

Row," Hughes said. "We didn't
foresee that we'd have trouble
there."
However Jay Heyman, a dis
placed Columbae resident, said
"[Columbae] certainly never
struck me as being structurally
sound."
Row houses have long been the
"bastard children of housing fa
cilities," Heyman said. He specu
lated that Stanford was reluctant
to put money into old houses.
Even before the earthquake,
Columbae was "in a general state
of disrepair," he said. But al
though it may have been run
down, "I don't think any of us
thought of [Columbae] as unsafe,"
Heyman said.
"I don't feel the University has
dealt badly with this," he added.
"I'm not sure what they would
have done."
Stanford's assumption that the
wood-framed Row houses could
withstand a quake was "techni
cally very justified," according to
Fouad Bendimerad, assistant pro

fessor of civil engineering. "But
earthquakes always prove you
wrong."
In past earthquakes, wood
framed buildings sustained less
damage in general than those built
with other materials, he said.
"It's still true" that wood build
ings are safer than those built of
unreinforced concrete, Ben
dimerad said. "None of [the Row
housesl collapsed, and most did
not suffer structural damage," he
added.
Wood structures are more
flexible and pliable than concrete
and will not crack and crumble
during an earthquake, explained
Assoc. Civil Engineering Prof.
Anne Kiremidjian.
Concrete buildings can collapse
and seriously injure people, Ben
dimerad noted.
While wood is a safer building
material than unreinforced con
crete, "reinforced concrete is
much better than wood,"
Kiremidjian said. Unreinforced
masonry buildings can no longer
be built in California under state
law, she added.
Stanford's building reinforce
ment program is based on safety
standards and knowledge of past
earthquakes, Bendimerard said,
and it "makes a lot of sense" that
the University upgraded its con
crete facilities and not the wood
framed houses on the Row.
"With each earthquake we learn
more about how different types of
buildings behave and implement
this knowledge," Kiremidjian
said. Bridges and buildings of a
particular height were especially
hard hit by last Tuesday's earth
quake, she said.
"Every earthquake is different.
We're in the process of looking at
why this earthquake damaged dif
ferent types of buildings," she
said.
"It may take years," said Ben
dimerad, who added that en
gineers are still studying the
impact of the 1971 Southern Cal
ifornia and 1985 Mexico City
earthquakes.
Earthquakes particularly affect
buildings whicn vibrate in the
same frequency range as seismic
waves, according to Kiremidjian.
Each building has a natural fre
quency at which it vibrates. When
the forces generated by the earth
quake happen to be in the same
frequency as the building, the mo
tion is amplified, she explained.
A building's height, mass,
design and building material de
termine its natural frequency, she
said.
"The University cannot up
grade all its buildings" because of
the costs involved, Kiremidjian
said. But she added that Stanford
has been "absolutely marvelous
in upgrading its buildings," espe
cially in the case of Roble Hall.
The 1985 survey only included
residences built before 1934 —
Branner, Lagunita, Roble and
Toyon — and the results promp
ted the revamping of Roble, Green

Library's tiered stacks and Lou
Henry Hoover House.
The buildings in Cowell Cluster
were braced in the summer of
1988.
Stanford was planning to rein
force the Geology Corner and the
Knoll, but "the earthquake just
came early," Hughes said.
In the past, Stanford's program
of reinforcement consisted of re
constructing individual structures
considered to be weak.
The University's reinforcement

of campus buildings began in the
1940s with the rebuilding of En
cina Hall and the strengthening
of buildings in the Inner Quad,
according to Hughes.
During the mid-'7os, History
Corner was closed and completely
rebuilt.
But as knowledge about earth
quake safety improved, "we
learned it was wiser to strengthen
a whole lot of buildings" at once
rather than focusing on individual
projects, Hughes said.

Synergy House, like the three other campus houses closed indef
initely, has nothing to offer its evacuated residents but moving
boxes and police lines.
