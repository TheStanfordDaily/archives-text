# Commission backs Jackson
## County's Human Relations votes to take several actions 
### John Wagner Editorial staff 
SAN JOSE — Expressing con
cern that junior Louis Jackson is
being selectively prosecuted for
his role in the May 15 takeover
of Building 10, the Santa Clara
County Human Relations Com
mission last night voted to take
several actions on Jackson's be
half.
After listening to presentations
from Jackson and other students
last night, the commission, which
is an arm of the Santa Clara
County Board of Supervisors,
passed motions:
• To arrange a face-to-face
meeting among "all the key
players" to clearly determine who
is "pushing" the prosecution of
Jackson,
• To write a letter to the district
attorney asking specific questions
about Jackson's charges and
• To write a letter to Kennedy
voicing concerns over the "selec
tive prosecution" of Jackson.
A representative from the dis

trict attorney's office did not ap
pear at last night's meeting.
Although the 12-member com
mission has no binding legal
power, its recommendations carry
a great deal of weight with county
authorities in human and civil
rights cases, according to county
mediator Alberto Carrillo. The
commission's "recommendations
don't come from left field," Car
rillo said.
Jackson said he was greatly en
couraged by the commission's ac
tions. "It's refreshing to see
people so willing to take initiative
on this," he said after the hour
long meeting.
The Santa Clara County district
attorney has charged Jackson
with six misdemeanors, including
inciting to riot and battery, for
his role in the takeover of Uni
versity President Donald Ken
nedy's office. Supporters of Jack
son believe he is being unfairly
singled out because he faces more
severe charges than others who
played similar roles.
Jackson said he was pleasantly

surprised by how easily all the
commission's motions passed.
None of the three motions sup
porting Jackson received any
"nay" votes.
The commission recommended


Louis Jackson
that the district attorney, Stan
ford Police Chief Marv Herring
ton, a student representative and
members of the commission hold
a meeting "as soon as possible"
to determine who is "pushing" the
prosecution of Jackson.
University administrators have
said that, in accordance with the
University's Policy on Arrests and
Prosecutions, once arrests of stu
dents are made, prosecution rests
solely in the hands of the district
attorney.
However, commission member

Randy Cooper, a San Jose police
sergeant, said last night that he
believes Stanford might be "push
ing" the prosecution of Jackson.
"My experience is someone
pushes these things," Cooper said.
Cooper s vid the role of the Stan
ford police, which arrested Jack
son, should be examined. The dis
trict attorney, he said, usually just
responds to the desires of the
police department.
The commission will also write
a letter to the district attorney,
raising specific questions about
the reasons for Jackson's "sin
gling out." Commission members
said they will ask in particular
how a police videotape, which has

been booked as evidence, was com
piled.
The commission also voted to
send a letter to Kennedy, ques
tioning the University's lack of
intervention on Jackson's behalf.
"Personally, I think we need to
hit this thing from every angle,"
said commission chair Margaret
Lawson.
In addition to the motions di
rectly supporting Jackson, the
commission also voted to hold
hearings on racism on college
campuses and in the general com
munity of Santa Clara County.
Jackson's next court hearing is
Nov. 1.
