# Commission backs Jackson
## County's Human Relations votes to take several actions 
### John Wagner Editorial staff 
SAN JOSE — Expressing con
cern that junior Louis Jackson is
being selectively prosecuted for
his role in the May 15 takeover
of Building 10, the Santa Clara
County Human Relations Com
mission last night voted to take
several actions on Jackson's be
half.
After listening to presentations
from Jackson and other students
last night, the commission, which
is an arm of the Santa Clara
County Board of Supervisors,
passed motions:
• To arrange a face-to-face
meeting among "all the key
players" to clearly determine who
is "pushing" the prosecution of
Jackson,
• To write a letter to the district
attorney asking specific questions
about Jackson's charges and
• To write a letter to Kennedy
voicing concerns over the "selec
tive prosecution" of Jackson.
A representative from the dis

trict attorney's office did not ap
pear at last night's meeting.
Although the 12-member com
mission has no binding legal
power, its recommendations carry
a great deal of weight with county
authorities in human and civil
rights cases, according to county
mediator Alberto Carrillo. The
commission's "recommendations
don't come from left field," Car
rillo said.
Jackson said he was greatly en
couraged by the commission's ac
tions. "It's refreshing to see
people so willing to take initiative
on this," he said after the hour
long meeting.
The Santa Clara County district
attorney has charged Jackson
with six misdemeanors, including
inciting to riot and battery, for
his role in the takeover of Uni
versity President Donald Ken
nedy's office. Supporters of Jack
son believe he is being unfairly
singled out because he faces more
severe charges than others who
played similar roles.
Jackson said he was pleasantly

surprised by how easily all the
commission's motions passed.
None of the three motions sup
porting Jackson received any
"nay" votes.
The commission recommended


Louis Jackson
