In the second alcohol-related suspension of
a Greek organization this quarter, Pi Beta Phi
sorority has been placed on temporary social
suspension pending investigation of an Oct.
14 party.

According to Fraternal Af
fairs Adviser Michael Hughes,
there reportedly was "exces
sive and potentially inappro
priate use of alcohol" at the
party, and "one or two" stu
dents were taken to the Stan
ford Hospital because of ex
cessive alcohol consumption.
The alcohol at the party,
held in Encina Station, was

catered by the Bon Appetit Co. through Tres
idder catering because of a rule that events
held in Tresidder and other Bon Appetit
managed spaces must be catered by Tresidder
catering.
Hughes said the investigation centers on
whether the Bon Appetit-provided beer was
the only alcohol served or whether there were
other sources, such as pre-parties. He said the
student or students taken to the hospital had
been drinking at a dorm party before they got
to the Pi Phi party
Hughes declined to give further details of
the incident, but said he was preparing a report
for the Office of Student Affairs.
A member of Pi Phi who asked to remain
anonymous said she saw police at the party
"talking to the bartender."
She said the sorority pledges had planned
