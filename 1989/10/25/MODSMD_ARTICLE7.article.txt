### Elizabeth Howton Editorial staff 
In the second alcohol-related suspension of
a Greek organization this quarter, Pi Beta Phi
sorority has been placed on temporary social
suspension pending investigation of an Oct.
14 party.

According to Fraternal Af
fairs Adviser Michael Hughes,
there reportedly was "exces
sive and potentially inappro
priate use of alcohol" at the
party, and "one or two" stu
dents were taken to the Stan
ford Hospital because of ex
cessive alcohol consumption.
The alcohol at the party,
held in Encina Station, was

catered by the Bon Appetit Co. through Tres
idder catering because of a rule that events
held in Tresidder and other Bon Appetit
managed spaces must be catered by Tresidder
catering.
Hughes said the investigation centers on
whether the Bon Appetit-provided beer was
the only alcohol served or whether there were
other sources, such as pre-parties. He said the
student or students taken to the hospital had
been drinking at a dorm party before they got
to the Pi Phi party
Hughes declined to give further details of
the incident, but said he was preparing a report
for the Office of Student Affairs.
A member of Pi Phi who asked to remain
anonymous said she saw police at the party
"talking to the bartender."
She said the sorority pledges had planned


Hughes
to buy beer, punch and EANABs
for the party, but that they can
celed those plans when they
learned of the Bon Appetit policy.
Although the party was only for
Pi Phi members and their dates,
she said she believed the women
who got sick were not Pi Phis and
that they had been drinking
before they came to the Pi Phi
party.
"Everybody [at the party] was
really, really drunk, but I think

they got that way before they
came," she said.
Earlier this quarter, the Phi
Delta Theta fraternity was placed
on temporary social suspension
pending investigation of a Sept.
28 party. A freshman who had
been at the Phi Delt party and
was intoxicated was hit by a
pickup truck and sustained minor
injuries.
Hughes said investigation of
that incident had been delayed due
to the Oct. 17 earthquake, but
that he had sent a draft report to
Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons.
