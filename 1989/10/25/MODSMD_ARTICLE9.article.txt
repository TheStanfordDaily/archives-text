### Brent Bigler Staff writer 
The ASSU Senate unanimously
approved a bill last night giving
the city of Watsonville $3,000 in
earthquake relief aid.
But a separate bill proposing
$1,500 in aid to help displaced
students relocate off-campus was
referred to a committee for fur
ther study.
Council of Presidents member
David Brown, who drafted the
Watsonville bill while the meeting
was in progress, said the money
would go to provide "medical, food
and water supplies" to the
stricken community.
Senator Rajesh Atluru said he
could think of "no worthier
cause."
Brown said he felt "like a lot
of students were concerned about
people off-campus," and that the
"senate can help out in time of
need." He suggested that the
funds come from $22,000 in an
nual reserves.
Brown said he chose the city of
Watsonville because of the im
mediacy and gravity of the need.
He added that friends told him,

"If you have money to send, send
it to Watsonville."
Senator Marko Lehtimaki
drafted the bill to aid displaced
students, also during the meeting.
In other business, Michael Jack
son, associate dean of student af
fairs, talked about the Universi
ty's response to last week's earth
quake.
Jackson said there was no sub
stance to allegations that the Uni
versity was trying to rid the
campus of co-op houses. Univer
sity engineers have closed three
co-ops for the remainder of this
year.
Instead, Jackson said, "we are
committed as an institution to co
op living."
But Jackson added, "we just
don't know" what the exact na
ture of housing for future co-ops
will be.
Jackson also said the University
would "apply for everything it can
possibly get" in government relief
funding.
"You can believe that Stanford
will get our fair share of relief,"
he said.
In a separate action, the senate
unanimously approved the

If you have money

Watsonville.'

nominations of six undergraduate
senate associates and nominations
to University committees.
Bylaws allow for six undergrad
uate and four graduate senate as
sociates who are non-voting mem
bers and can speak at ASSU meet
ings. Due to a lack of interest on
the part of graduate students, the
remaining four associates have
not yet been chosen. However, the
senate may choose the remaining
four from the pool of undergrad
uate applicants.
The senate also heard a report
from Program Board chair Erin
Lopez detailing how funds will be
released for the remainder of the
quarter. She said that the board
has combined this quarter's two
discretionary cycles into one.
The merger was necessary be
cause of Nomination Commission
delays in selecting Program Board
members.
