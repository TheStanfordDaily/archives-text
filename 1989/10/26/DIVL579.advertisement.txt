Some thoughts about
your future. And ours.
From one of our experts.
"I had the usual concerns about working for a big com
pany. That I'd be lost in an uncaring system, or get stuck with a
dull, no-growth job. It isn't that way at all. I worked as an analy
sis engineer on graphite epoxy structures for the first seven
months. It's leading edge technology. Then I moved into design
and testing. Very exciting.
"It" I had a younger brother in engineering I'd say, don't
buv into the stereotype. Get the facts, then make your decision.
Hoeing offers the strengths of a large company. Good benefits.
A chance to move around within the company. Exceptional
people. Really important work to do. And everything
you need to do it.
"I )on't settle for anything less."
