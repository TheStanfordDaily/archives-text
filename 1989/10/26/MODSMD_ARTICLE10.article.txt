Twice displaced? Check in
Assoc. Dean of Residential Affairs
Alice Supton is looking for what she
calls "the double-whammies" — those
students who were displaced from Roble
Hall two years ago and again from Row
residences in last week's earthquake.
Between seven and 20 students fall
into this category, and they need to check
in either with Supton or Asst. Housing
Center Director Bill Georges before 6
p.m. today.
"There are special circumstances in
being twice-displaced, and we want to
respond in a sensitive way," Supton said.
Students who have already made off
campus housing arrangements do not
need to talk with Supton or Georges.
But those participating in the draw and
who will be assigned to housing tonight
should.
Supton said the twice-displaced stu
dents will not necessarily be given pri
ority in housing arrangements — but it
depends on the situation. "We want to

see what we can do to accommodate
them without promising a particular
space," she said.
Stats midterm switched
Because of building closures resulting
from the earthquake, Statistics Prof.
Paul Switzer announced a room change
for the midterm exam in his Statistics
110 cl&ss.
The midterm will be held tomorrow
at 11 a.m. in Physics room 100.
Edge holds quake dance
The Edge nightclub in Palo Alto will
hold a benefit dance for the Red Cross
earthquake fund tonight.
The dance will begin at 9 p.m. and
end at 2 a.m. There will be a $5 donation
at the door for people 18 and over with
valid identification. A Red Cross volun
teer will be present to accept any extra
donations.
The Edge (formerly called the Vortex)
is located at 260 California Ave.
