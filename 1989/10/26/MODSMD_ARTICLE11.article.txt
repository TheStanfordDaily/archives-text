## Khadafi renounces terrorism 
### 
CAIRO, Egypt (AP) — Libya's Moammar Khadafi
has admitted for the first time that he sponsored
international terror but says he stopped when he
discovered the terrorists were working for them
selves and not for all Arabs.
He also told Cairo's state-owned weekly magazine
Al-Mussawar, published yesterday, that he wants
no confrontation with the United States and would
welcome a dialogue toward friendlier relations.
Al-Mussawar said the interview was conducted a
week ago, a day after Khadafi met with President
Hosni Mubarak in Tobruk on Libya's Mediterranean
coast to discuss improving relations after 16 years
of friction.
Khadafi spoke about a reversal in his policy toward
terrorism in reply to a question suggesting that
support of "groups that practice terror in the name
of revolutionary violence" may have harmed Libya.
"At one point, we supported some of these groups
without meticulously examining their aims and
role," he told Al-Mussawar editor Makram
Mohammed Ahmed, a Mubarak confidant.
"But when we discovered that these groups were
causing more harm than benefit to the Arab cause,
we halted our aid to them completely and withdrew
our support."
Sounding apologetic, Khadafi added: "We er
roneously thought that these groups could be part
of the (Arab) national liberation movement. But we
found out that they were practicing terrorism for
the sake of terrorism and for other objectives that
had nothing to do with our national cause."
Khadafi, a disciple of the late Egyptian President
Gamal Abdel Nasser and the main current proponent
of Nasser's ideas on Arab unity, did not say what
terror groups he had in mind. One is known to be
the Fatah Revolutionary Council, a dissident Pal
estinian group led by Abu Nidal, whose real name
is Sabry el-Banna.

In the past, Khadafi insisted he helped only na
tional liberation movements.
"Let me tell you frankly that hijacking planes
and killing civilians are acts of murder that have
nothing to do with combat," Khadafi said. "(Libya)
should not be called to account for any of these
acts, because we have withdrawn our support of
such groups."
Khadafi's sponsorship of international terror was
the principal cause of his rift with the United States.
In September 1987, U.S. officials presented to the
United Nations a selected chronology specifying 60
cases of what they termed Libya's terrorism and
support for various terrorist groups.
U.S. warplanes raided two Libyan cities, the cap
ital Tripoli and the Mediterranean port of Benghazi,
in April 1986, 10 days after Libya was blamed for
masterminding the bombing of a discotheque in
West Berlin frequented by U.S. servicemen.
An American soldier and a woman died in the
bombing and 200 people were wounded.
In the interview, Khadafi seemed to be telling
the Americans he wants bygones to be bygones and
is eager to turn a new leaf.
He said he would welcome a dialogue with the
Americans "anywhere they want on condition it is
held in the public eye.
"I say very clearly: We do not believe that conflict
with the United States is necessary. We believe that
many of the problems between us can be solved at
the negotiating table. We arc prepared for relations
based on mutual respect and common interests. We
harbor no hatred for the American people, and we
also believe that the American people have no such
feeling for us."
He blamed former President Reagan's "muscle
flexing" for complications in American-Libyan re
lations and said he felt that President Bush's ad
ministration "will be more rational."
