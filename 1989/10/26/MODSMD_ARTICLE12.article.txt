Fish boycott proposed
WASHINGTON (AP) — Two lawmakers and
the environmental group Greenpeace called yes
terday for a nationwide consumer boycott of
canned tuna imported from countries whose fish
ing fleets use drift nets.
"I have yet to meet an American family that
thinks it is a good idea to strangle dolphins and
other animals in drift nets," Rep. Peter DeFazio,
D-Ore., said in urging the boycott.
DeFazio and Eni F.H. Faleomavaega, American
Samoa's non-voting delegate to Congress, also
urged consumers not to purchase tuna from na
tions whose canneries process fish supplied by
the drift net fleets.
DeFazio said it was his understanding that
virtually all of the canned tuna imported from
Southeast Asia contained fish caught by the drift
net fleets of Taiwan, Japan and South Korea,
and that Thailand was the "principal processor"
of such fish.
All imported tuna is required to bear the coun
try of origin on its label, though DeFazio said
such labeling was often in fine print.
"The United States is the only major market
for canned tuna, importing almost $250 million
of drift net-caught tuna just last year," DeFazio
said. "I think American consumers would be
willing to pay a few cents more for a can of tuna
in order to force these nations to stop using
driftnets."
DeFazio said that about 30 percent of the
canned tuna sold in the United States is imported.
"The American market has enormous economic
clout and can force a change in these fishing
technologies," said Gerry Leape, Greenpeace's
legislative director for ocean ecology issues.
Khmer Rouge gains ground
BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) — Foreign Minister
Siddhi Savetsila confirmed yesterday that Khmer

Rouge guerrillas have seized a key Cambodian
town near the Thai border and captured tanks
and artillery.
But Siddhi, the first top official to confirm
that the western town of Pailin was in guerrilla
hands, said neither the Cambodian government
nor guerrilla forces are strong enough to win a
clear victory.
"In the end they will have to compromise and
come back to negotiations," he told a weekly
news briefing.
The guerrillas said the victory Sunday opened
the door for an assault 40 miles to the northeast
on Battambang, Cambodia's second-largest city
after the nation's capital, Pnom Penh.
Khmer Rouge Army radio on Tuesday called
on officials and soldiers of Cambodia's
Vietnamese-installed government to quit.
"Parents and compatriots ... please call on your
children and husbands to quicldy desert for home
... in order to stay alive," said the broadcast, a
text of which was seen in Bangkok yesterday.
Army officers had vowed to hold onto Pailin's
gem-rich area seized by the Khmer Rouge, who
have been fighting to topple the government for
the past 11 years.
Thailand is leading efforts to restart the peace
process, stalled since the failure of an interna
tional conference in Paris in August.
The main stumbling block was the Cambodian
government's refusal to agree to a government
role for the Khmer Rouge, which massacred hun
dreds of thousands of Cambodians during four
years of rule before Vietnam invaded in 1978
and ousted it from power. The Khmer Rouge
tried to turn Cambodia into an agrarian com
mune.
Asked if the Khmer Rouge controlled Pailin,
the minister said, "Yes it is true." He added that
according to Thai military reports, the guerrillas
captured nine artillery pieces, four tanks, six
trucks and large quantities of ammunition in
their assault on the town.
