HELSINKI, Finland (AP) — Soviet President Mik
hail S. Gorbachev assured Finland on yesterday the
Soviet Union' has "no moral or political right" to
interfere with Eastern Europe's moves toward de
mocracy, his spokesman said.
Among the several thousand people enthusiastic
ally greeting Gorbachev were protesters who shouted
demands for the return of Karelia, a region Finland
ceded to the Soviets in 1944 after two wars in five
years.
Gorbachev arrived for a three-day visit to his
thriving Western neighbor seeking an injection of
Finnish know-how and capital to keep "perestroika"
on track. He acknowledged his program to restruc
ture the economy was in trouble.
Gorbachev's spokesman, Gennady Gerasimov, said
Moscow would like to see the Warsaw Pact military
alliance "disbanded tomorrow," in a simultaneous
step with the dismantling of the Western NATO
alliance.
Gorbachev's hands-off policy has allowed
reformers to take power in Poland and Hungary
and has encouraged the reform-minded opposition
in East Germany.
"The events now taking place in Eastern Europe
concern the countries and the peoples of this region.
We have no moral or political right to interfere,"
Gerasimov said after Gorbachev's opening round of
talks.
"We assume that others also have no right to
interfere," he said, briefing reporters on Gorbachev'
100-minute meeting with Finnish President Mauno
Koivisto.
While upholding the right of East European coun
tries to go their own way, Gerasimov also said they
were obliged to meet their commitments to the
Soviet Union.
"The countries of Eastern Europe, including Hun
gary, have certain international obligations. These
obligations do not go away with a change of gov
ernment. Hungary is a member of the Warsaw Pact,"
he said.
Smiling and waving, Gorbachev walked over to a
crowd of Finns — many chanting "Gorba! Gorba!
Gorba!" — after visiting a small room where Soviet

founder Vladimir I. Lenin once hid from Czarist
forces before the 1917 revolution.
Gorbachev spent nearly half an hour shaking
hands, chatting to Finns and praising the state of
relations between the two neighbors.
Finland has long sought to maintain its indepen
dence and neutrality, but for centuries has generally
been subservient to its giant neighbor. The nations
fought bitter wars twice during World War 11, and
Finland each time was forced to grant territorial
concessions to the Soviet aggressors.
"Give us back Karelia!" some in the crowd shouted
to the Soviet leader. Gorbachev showed no sign that
he heard them.
A handful of demonstrators on the Karelia issue
also was outside the presidential palace earlier where
Gorbachev met Koivisto.
Some 400,000 Karelians were resettled after the
handover, which still rankles many Finns. Gorba
chev has never addressed the issue openly, and
Koivisto also has never publicly discussed the an
nexed territory.
Finnish officials said they did not expect Karelia
to come up in the talks, and asserted that most
Finns viewed Soviet control of the border region as
historical fact.
The Soviets demanded control over eastern
Karelia to provide a buffer for Leningrad, while
Finland kept control of western Karelia. The Soviet
Union now has a 793-mile border with Finland, its
longest with any Western country.
White-haired Martti Siirala, 66, who was born in
the region, said the Soviets have admitted the an
nexation was an "unwarranted aggression" by the
Stalinist regime. "What would be wrong with cor
recting the mistake?" he said.
In a long-awaited gesture to Finland, Gorbachev
acknowledged Finnish neutrality more explicity than
ever before by a Soviet leader, and called Soviet-
Finnish ties a model for international relations.
"I would like to greet neutral Finland," he said
in a banquet toast, avoiding the qualifications the
Soviets usually attached when referring to Finnish
non-alliance.
