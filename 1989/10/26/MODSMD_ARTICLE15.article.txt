Honor code is not
effective without
student enforcement

Students take two
oaths each time they sign
those little blue books before
an exam.
The first is "that they will not
give or receive aid in examina
tions." The second is "that they
will do their share and take an
active part in seeing to it that
others as well as themselves uphold
the spirit and letter of the Honor
Code."
Obviously, it is wrong to cheat.
Cheating is essentially stealing in
formation from another student.
And no rational person agrees with
stealing.
Cheating is also unfair to stu
dents who don't succumb to it be
cause unpunished cheaters move
the grading curve up, bringing
other, perhaps more honest stu
dents' grades down. And, of course,
there are other notions of honor,
self-esteem and dignity, hopefully
not antiquated, involved.
Most students buy into and un
derstand these arguments against
cheating. Only 20 Honor Code con
victions occur each year.
But the second part of the stu
dent section of the Honor Code is
not so clearly understood. What

does it mean to take an "active
part" in making sure the Honor
Code is upheld?
Does it mean that the student
in Prof. Tim Taylor's Economics I
class should come forward and
"narc" on his or her fellow stu
dents?
Most would say that it isn't suf
ficient to have a law without en
forcement. In order for a code of
any type to work, those under the
code must believe the code is just.
But they must also be willing to
"punish" those who stray from the
code.
It is easy enough for students at
Stanford to cheat. All it takes is
peeking over a fellow student's
shoulder to pick up a few extra
points.
Although cheating may be fairly
simple, it is a very difficult for a
person to have the gumption to
turn a fellow student in for cheat
ing. A snitch is rarely a popular
person.
But, although hard to believe, a
cheater will be better off in the
end if he or she is caught in the
act. After all, if the cheater is not
caught now and taught a lesson
in college, later on in life he or
she could be caught cheating on
something and face harsher con
sequences — such as the law.
If the Honor Code is to mean
anything at Stanford we must sup
port Section A 1 of the Honor Code
and "take an active part in seeing
to it that others ... uphold the
spirit and letter of the Honor
Code."
