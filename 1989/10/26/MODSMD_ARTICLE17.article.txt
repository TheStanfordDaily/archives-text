## Awaiting the real world 
### 
SEEMINGLY, SINCE THE dawn of
time, Stanford's been criticized for
"being out of the mainstream."
That is, we just don't think and act like
the majority of the country.
Last year's presidential race .made this
point very, very clear. While the country
chose conservative, Stanford went liberal,
no matter how dirty the word had be
come.
In other countries, people complain
about an election where whole cemeteries
are registered, or people are voting at
gunpoint, or ballots suddenly and magi
cally disappear. Here at Stanford, the
complaint of the election was that we
don't think like everyone else.
It's a perennial criticism of Stanford
that we are not in touch with reality,
that it's a rough and dirty world out
there and we're just too naive to know
about it yet. People have even suggested
that negative experiences are the only
way to achieve the enlightenment of "the
real world."
I suppose that I can't really argue
about our being different. In a lot of
ways, almost too many ways, Stanford
doesn't mimic the rest of the country,
much less the rest of the world. In a lot
of ways, Stanford is truly unique.
How many institutes of higher learning
would consider themselves incomplete
without an on-campus shopping center
and championship golf course? How many
university presidents play volleyball with
the students and take the chance to make
fun of the Hoover Institute in Gaieties?
How many school marching bands make
fun of other marching bands because

they, well, because they march?
Where else, but at Stanford could
people consider a peaceful sit-in for better
college curriculum, more TAs and full
time ethnic deans a riot? Or even more,
how could the students who participate
be considered a radical fringe terrorist
group?
Conservatives in the outside world are
working day and night to make a con
situtional amendment banning flag bur
ning; conservatives here at Stanford are
concerned with first amendment rights
to express their opinions.
That's not to say that we live in com
plete idealism from start to finish of our
four years here at Stanford. Every once
in a while, the outside world, the "real"
world slaps us in the face.
Last spring's democratic protest in
China was crushed by the government,
by the reality of tanks and guns and
death. When idealism pushes too hard,
reality pushes back, and it pushes hard.
From the sit-in last spring, most of us
were taught that it's not enough to have
the right idea or the right motive. We
have to be ideal and play the game, their
game, on their home field, with their
own set of rules.
The administration does hold most of
the cards, the money, the police, as well
as the time to wait out and wear out
most any group. The administration
exists in the "real" world of power,
politics and money, and it does a good
job of it. I guess that's why they're paid.
But that's not the scary part.
What frightens me are people who so
easily write it all off and say that we

should just accept it. Get the right job,
make lots of money, buy the BMW and
the house in the suburbs, have the 2.3
children and just be quiet. Don't make
waves, especially waves that question au
thority.
I can't help but think of people who
would turn in runaway slaves in the
South, or of the persecuters of the Jews
during the Holocaust — performing these
atrocities because "it was the law."
They were living in the "real" world,
following it's rules and doing whatever
its leaders had laid out. They were being
model citizens, at least in the eyes of the
authority.
Maybe Stanford's not in the main
stream. Maybe a world run by money
and politics awaits us beyond Palm Drive.
Maybe when we get out, we'll become a
calloused cog in the machine of the "real"
world. Who knows? Time will tell.
What I do know is that for now, we
still have our energy, enthusiasm and
idealism to keep us going. To extinguish
this spirit now, just because someone out
there may eventually put it out for us,
would be a tragedy.

be considered a radical fringe terrorist
group?
Conservatives in the outside world are
working day and night to make a con
situtional amendment banning flag bur
ning; conservatives here at Stanford are
concerned with first amendment rights
to express their opinions.
That's not to say that we live in com
plete idealism from start to finish of our
four years here at Stanford. Every once
in a while, the outside world, the "real"
world slaps us in the face.
Last spring's democratic protest in
China was crushed by the government,
by the reality of tanks and guns and
death. When idealism pushes too hard,
reality pushes back, and it pushes hard.
From the sit-in last spring, most of us
were taught that it's not enough to have
the right idea or the right motive. We
have to be ideal and play the game, their
game, on their home field, with their
own set of rules.
The administration does hold most of
the cards, the money, the police, as well
as the time to wait out and wear out
most any group. The administration
exists in the "real" world of power,
politics and money, and it does a good
job of it. I guess that's why they're paid.
But that's not the scary part.
What frightens me are people who so
easily write it all off and say that we

should just accept it. Get the right job,
make lots of money, buy the BMW and
the house in the suburbs, have the 2.3
children and just be quiet. Don't make
waves, especially waves that question au
thority.
I can't help but think of people who
would turn in runaway slaves in the
South, or of the persecuters of the Jews
during the Holocaust — performing these
atrocities because "it was the law."
They were living in the "real" world,
following it's rules and doing whatever
its leaders had laid out. They were being
model citizens, at least in the eyes of the
authority.
Maybe Stanford's not in the main
stream. Maybe a world run by money
and politics awaits us beyond Palm Drive.
Maybe when we get out, we'll become a
calloused cog in the machine of the "real"
world. Who knows? Time will tell.
What I do know is that for now, we
still have our energy, enthusiasm and
idealism to keep us going. To extinguish
this spirit now, just because someone out
there may eventually put it out for us,
would be a tragedy.
