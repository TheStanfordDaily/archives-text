## Black letter organizations foster divisiveness 
### 
WHILE AN ARTICLE describing
the facets of black letter or
ganizations could certainly be
interesting and educational, I deeply
regret the confrontational overtones
expressed in Monday's article (Oct. 23
"Black letter organizations thrive").
In the numerous references to
"white" fraternities, the article and
those quoted in it are drawing battle
lines and building up those stereotypes
which the entire Stanford community
should be trying to tear down.
Black letter organization members
state, for example, that they "have a
greater focus on community service
than their predominantly-white coun
terparts."
This competitive tone is unnecessary.
A greater impetus for public service
has recently surfaced throughout the
fraternal/sororal community, as evi
denced by such events as the Kappa

Alpha's annual Mud Volleyball Tourna
ment for muscular dystrophy, last
October's Interfratemity Council Hol
loween Haunted House for Escondido
Village and a Christmas party for East
Palo Alto children put on last year by
Kappa Sigma and Delta Sigma Theta.
Who does "more" community service
is irrelevant. The vital point is that a
sense of civic responsibility and con
cern is increasing everywhere. The
article's relativist tone is coun
terproductive.
A second example of counterproduc
tive rhetoric can be found in Kappa
Alpha Psi president John Meigs' state
ment that "We see all the problems
that white fraternities are having with
alcohol, and that's a burden we don't
need to handle."
It's no secret that the mixture of
fraternities and alcohol has often
proven to be flammable, but problems

with alcohol have deeper roots and
cross all lines â€” social, cultural and
racial.
All members of the fraternal/sororal
community should cooperate in educat
ing one another about the dangers of
alcohol and promoting its responsible
use.
Most damaging, however, is the
repeated reference to "white" fraterni
ties. I've used the term "black" letter
organization because that's the term
its members use. Whether membership
is actively limited to black students I
don't know.
What I do know is that other Greek
organizations on campus have no racial
restrictions or quotas, though labeling
them as "white" implies a racial selec
tion process.
The unfortunate ratio of non
minorities to minorities in many of the
organizations is another matter to be

considered by all members of the
fraternal/sororal community.
Why don't more minorities rush
Greek organizations in the first place?
The problems, as well as the solutions,
lie on both sides of the issue.
For their part, Greek organizations
need to reach out more enthusiastically
to minorities in a solid effort to diver
sify membership and break down
stereotypes.
On the flip side, minority groups
also need to encourage open
mindedness and to promote interaction
with their "predominantly-white coun
terparts."
A black sorority member says in
Monday's article that organizations
such as hers should not be viewed as
divisive. Unfortunately, Monday's arti
cle does little to prove her correct.
