# Blood drive thanks Stanford and needs continued support
## 
### 
The Stanford community has always
been there when we needed it, and this
past week has been no exception! On
the day following the earthquake,
several hundred Stanford students,
faculty and staff members volunteered
to give blood at the Stanford Univer
sity Blood Bank.
We are greatly appreciative of your
quick and generous response to our
patients' needs. Your support is largely
responsible for our adequate supply of
blood.
Although our present blood needs
have been met, we anticipate an on-

going need for blood throughout the
next few months. Patients will continue
to need blood products.
You can continue to help by commit
ting to a future blood donation that
will keep Stanford in supply regardless
of potential blood drive cancellations by
affected groups.
We encourage you to continue to
support the campus blood drives. If
you are unable to donate at a campus
blood drive, please feel free to visit our
center located at 800 Welch Rd. Please
call for an appointment so that we can
best serve you. Our appointment desk
(723-7831) is currently taking appoint
ments for the months of November and
December.
We would like to thank the Stanford
community for their outstanding re
sponse. Our hearts are with all of you
affected by the disaster.
