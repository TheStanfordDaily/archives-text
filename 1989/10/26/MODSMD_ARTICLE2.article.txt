# The 						Big One long way off, experts say

### Ed Palattella Staff writer 
Last week's earthquake claimed more than 60
lives and caused billions of dollars of damage in
the Bay Area. But it wasn't the Big One — and,
fortunately, the Big One is probably a long way off,
earthquake experts said yesterday
Nevertheless, there is a 50 percent chance of a
magnitude-7 quake shaking the Farm within the
next 30 years, and minor earthquakes will likely
shake Stanford within the next two months, ac
cording to officials at the U.S. Geological Survey
in Menlo Park.
The quake experts also said they upgraded last
Tuesday's quake from a 6.9 to a 7.1 magnitude
temblor because of new worldwide data they gath
ered.
Jill McCarthy, a geophysicist at the survey, said
last Tuesday's quake relieved pressure only on the
segment of the San Andreas Fault in the Santa
Cruz mountians.
The Peninsula segment of the San Andreas Fault
and the Northern and Southern Hayward faults —
the three seismically active areas closest to Stanford
— all have a 20 percent chance of breaking in the
next 30 years, according to McCarthy.
If the Hayward faults are combined and grouped
with the Peninsula segment, there is a 50 percent
chance of a major earthquake in the next 30 years,
she said.
McCarthy said there is a 10 per
cent chance of a magnitude-6
quake affecting the Peninsula
within the next two months.
There is a 45 percent chance of
a magnitude-5 quake. Though the
7.1 quake was more than 100
times stronger, a 5.0 quake could
cause significant damage to build
ings that were weakened by last
week's quake.
At least four magnitude-4
quakes will occur in the next two
months, McCarthy added.
The Big One, or the successor
to the 1906 quake, will not happen
in the next 30 years because the
four San Andreas Fault segments
each do not contain enough pres
sure to move as one, McCarthy
said.
For example, she said, the Santa
Cruz Mountains segment will not
likely slip within the next 30 years
because most of the fault's pres
sure was relieved last Tuesday.
"There is no chance of the Big
One," McCarthy said. "Personally
I don't think there is a good
enough chance of a earth
quake."
In terms of last Tuesday's
quake, McCarthy said the revision
of magnitude from 6.9 to 7.1 on
the Richter scale was based on
seismic studies gathered from in
ternational earthquake stations.
