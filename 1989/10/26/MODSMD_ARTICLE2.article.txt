# The
						Big One long way off, experts say

Last week's earthquake claimed more than 60
lives and caused billions of dollars of damage in
the Bay Area. But it wasn't the Big One — and,
fortunately, the Big One is probably a long way off,
earthquake experts said yesterday
Nevertheless, there is a 50 percent chance of a
magnitude-7 quake shaking the Farm within the
next 30 years, and minor earthquakes will likely
shake Stanford within the next two months, ac
cording to officials at the U.S. Geological Survey
in Menlo Park.
The quake experts also said they upgraded last
Tuesday's quake from a 6.9 to a 7.1 magnitude
temblor because of new worldwide data they gath
ered.
Jill McCarthy, a geophysicist at the survey, said
last Tuesday's quake relieved pressure only on the
segment of the San Andreas Fault in the Santa
Cruz mountians.
The Peninsula segment of the San Andreas Fault
and the Northern and Southern Hayward faults —
the three seismically active areas closest to Stanford
— all have a 20 percent chance of breaking in the
next 30 years, according to McCarthy.
If the Hayward faults are combined and grouped
with the Peninsula segment, there is a 50 percent
chance of a major earthquake in the next 30 years,
she said.
