# Students need time to recover in aftermath of quake
## 
### 
We are writing to follow up the let
ter dated Oct. 20 from University
President DonaJd Kennedy and Provost
James Rosse to Stanford faculty. A key
factor in the process of recovering
from the effects of last week's earth
quake is the level of mutual under
standing among faculty, teaching assis
tants and students taking courses.
We all need to be mindful of the
multitude of obstacles that have
impeded academic progress for many
students during the past week. Stu
dents displaced from their housing may
not have access to books, notes or even

study space; they are also likely to be
sufffering from lack of sleep.
Limited library access has created
problems for a still larger set of stu
dents, and the same is true of the
psychological stress caused by the expe
rience of the earthquake.
It is unrealistic to expect that a
short postponement of some assign
ments will be sufficient to permit all
students to deal with these obstacles.
Rather, it is likely that some material
that would normally be covered may
have to be cut.
Thank you for your understanding
and help in refocusing our energies on
the academic task to which we are all
devoted.
