University asserts
untruths concerning
USW arbitration
Staff Counsel Susan Hoerger in her
letter published in The Daily recently
(Oct. 4) communicated a number of
inaccuracies to the public that I'd like
to correct.
First, she said the University offered
United Stanford Workers an October
date for the life science technician arbi
tration. If this is so, I'd like to know
who the University contacted.
No one spoke to our president, our
field reps or our office staff. She did
not speak to our lawyer. No steward,
no officer, no member of United Stan
ford Workers was contacted.

After her letter was published, the
USW settled a grievance on behalf of
another worker with the University,
before that grievance was to be ar
bitrated on Oct. 27, therefore freeing it
for the life science technician arbitra
tion, It is important to note that con
cerning the contract between the Uni
versity and the Union, the University
schedules all arbitration dates.
Second, the USW canceled only the
first date, Feb. 22, because our lawyer,
Jim Eggleston, was unable to attend
for personal reasons. I don't know why
the University canceled the Feb. 23
proceedings, but it was the University
that canceled, not us.
Third, the University canceled arbi
tration proceedings scheduled for Sept.
27 and 28, saying that it had to meet
with the police officers' union on those
days.
Which police officers' union was

meeting with on Thursday? One of our
field representatives spoke to a repre
sentative of the Stanford police offi
cers' union immediately after Stanford
contacted us at 4 p.m., Sept. 26 to
cancel. The police officers' union was
unable to meet with anyone on Thurs
day due to operational needs. So
please, Ms. staff counsel, get your facts
straight.

Not safe to brace
oneself in doorway
during earthquake
In the aftermath of the earthquake,
the university has distributed a

pamphlet on earthquake preparedness.
The purpose of this pamphlet is to
reduce iryury and the loss of life in
the event of an earthquake.
I was therefore surprised to see a
very dangerous instruction, not only
being given, but also being underlined.
The booklet states, "During the
quake. . immediately get under a
table or desk, brace yourself in a door
way. .. , w and gives a small drawing of
two persons braced in a doorway.
One should never brace oneself in a
doorway during an earthquake as the
pamphlet instructs us to do.
Even though this instruction was
always given a few years ago, its inher
ent dangers have caused it to be
rejected by many earthquake safety
experts. Even the emergency section of
the phone book no longer includes this
instruction.

During an earthquake, doors are
going to swing. At the very least, the
swinging door will knock one from
under the doorway into the center of
the room. One would then be an easy
target for falling debris.
In more unfortunate cases, they will
cause serious iryury. Anyone who has
had their fingers accidentally caught by
a door has only experienced a fraction
of the damage a swinging door is capa
ble of.
During an earthquake, stay away
from doors. A swinging door can injure
someone who would not otherwise be
injured. Also, do not run out. People
have been killed by falling glass and
other debris as they leave the relative
security of a building.
Above all, do not panic.
