## Soccer falls a goal short despite taking early lead 
### Andrew Wilcox Staff writer 
Despite taking an early lead for the sec
ond straight game, the Cardinal men's soc
cer team again could not hold on, falling
2-1 to University of San Francisco yester
day at Negoesco Stadium.
The loss continued the Stanford squad's
current skid, which has concurred with the
Cardinal's return to the West Coast several
weeks ago. In that time, the team (7-8-2)
has gone 1-4-1 to drop below .500 for the
first time in a month.

Although neither squad came out with
much intensity, the Cardinal jumped out
to the lead only seven minutes into the
game. Freshman forward Lance Killian put
Stanford on top thanks to a heads-up pass
by senior forward Chris Porch. Porch out
foxed several Don defenders and crossed
the ball from the endline, with Killian con
verting on a shot from the middle.

As was the case against California Sun
day, the Cardinal was unable to capitalize
on the early score.
"After the goal, our intensity stayed the
same, it didn't go up. We could have buried
them early but we left the door open for
them," junior midfielder Todd Caven said.
The Dons, who are clinging to hopes of
an NCAA playoff spot, seemed to have the
upper hand for the rest of the way and
finally knotted the score at 1-1 early in
the second half.
The equalizer came when junior forward
Marquis White, the Dons' leading scorer,
headed in a rebound past disoriented Car
dinal goalkeeper Chris Helling, who did not
appear to see where the initial shot had
bounced.
USF freshman star Troy Dayak provided
the game-winner midway through the sec
ond half, juking past two Stanford
defenders and drilling the ball into the net
from 10 yards out to put the Dons up 2- 1.
Although the Cardinal threatened to tie
the game with several late opportunities,
the team displayed an overall "lack of in
tensity," according to Helling, who added
that the squad has had trouble getting
motivated now that playoff hopes are out
of the picture.
