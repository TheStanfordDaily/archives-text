# Playing against Dad can make you cry, play your very best

I had no idea how bad it was.
I am not a native Californian, so my
earthquake experience had been limited
to some small tremors — that is, until
5:04 pm October 17.
I am thankful that it hit during prac
tice. Being surrounded by 250 yards of
open field is a very comforting feeling
when the football field starts rippling
and Maples Pavilion is rattling loud
threats of collapse.
Unlike some people, I didn't receive
any life-changing revelations from the
quake. But I did feel some life-stabilizing
reinforcements.
I realized that I don't need television
but do enjoy electricity. I found out that
it only takes me 15 minutes to move two
weeks worth of my belongings out of my
briefly condemned house (Kairos). And
most important, I learned, once again,
how important Mom and Dad are to me.
Their somewhat panic stricken 240-
pound baby boy called them the morning
after the quake. They bolstered me with
words of encouragement, and I was much
more calm after hanging up the phone.
The reason I mention this is because this

week's game is very special for me. My
dad coaches for USC.
Competing with Dad is nothing new
for me. While I was growing up in In
diana, we used to play games of one-on
one basketball with each other in the
driveway. I was less than ten-years-old
then, and I would play him as fierce as
I could. Dad never let me win because
he knew nobody else would.
Whenever Dad and I competed, I always
tried to win his respect by playing with
as much effort as possible. I tried so hard
that many games ended with Dad hugging
me while I fought back tears.
Although our games were intense, they
were never vicious. This is hard for a lot
of people to understand. It may seem
that such a battle between a boy and his
dad can lead to a loss of love. But it is
because his love for me is so strong that
I was able to compete so fiercely.
Dad is a very emotional man who is
convinced that hard work is the only way
to get anything worthwhile. He doesn't
expect perfection from his players or his
family, only 100-percent effort. But he

also knows that hard work doesn't guar
antee a person anything other than an
opportunity.
Dad never told me how to work hard;
he showed me. During baseball season,
he would pitch batting practice to me
until his arm ached, and, throughout the
year, he would get up at 5:45 a.m. to lift
weights in the backyard with me before
school.
It may seem as though Dad pushed me
into athletics, but he never forced me to
do anything. He always asked if I wanted
to go hit baseballs, shoot baskets or lift

weights. This was his way of teaching
me how to push myself.
The situation has changed a great deal
since those games of one-on-one. But the
way we compete hasn't. Both Dad and 1
put a lot of effort and emotion into the
game of football. It means so much to
us that we can't even joke about it during
the off-season.
As I snap on my helmet, with tears
welling up in my eyes, and run onto the
field to face Dad, I pity every athlete
who has never been able to reach the
peak of blinding intensity that comes
about by competing against someone
whom they love and respect more than
anybody else in the world.
The problem is that one of us has to
lose.
The first two years we played against
each other, while Dad was at the Uni
versity of Arizona, Stanford won. The
last two years, §ince Dad has been coach
ing at USC, the Trojans have won. I
guess this year's game could be called
the grudge match.
Mom hates the game.

She has to decide whether to pull for
the man to whom she has been married
for over 30 years, or for one of the five
children which she brought into the
world. Out of all of us, she is the most
competitive, and her frustration is ex
treme when watching a game between
the two of us. I can't tell you which team
she will want to win. All I know is that
she asked me to get her a ticket in the
Stanford section.
After USC escaped with a 24-20 victory
over us last year, some familiar feelings
resurfaced. I hid my tears in Dad's shirt
and could tell he was proud of my effort.
Mom told Dad that they were lucky to
win the game, and Dad silently nodded
his head.
The emotion which flows from Dad
and me during this game probably won't
register 7.0 on the Richter scale. The
news of the game will most likely be
limited to the sports pages. However, for
four hours this Saturday afternoon, there
will be two lives shaken up more by the
spirit of athletic competition than any
thing Mother Nature could whip up.
