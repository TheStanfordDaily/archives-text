After its toughest loss of the
sepson. the one thing Denny
Cardinal f'xjtball te<i

against a top-10 team. Unfortu
nately, that's just what it gets.
Coming off a heartbreaking 27-
24 loss to Utah Saturday, Stan
ford now has to get ready for No.
10 USC. The game is Saturday at
3:30 p.m. from the Coliseum and
will be broadcast live on the
Pacific Sports Network.
"You come off a loss like the
Utah game and it made me realize
one of the things I like about
Stanford is that every day there's
another challenge," fifth-year
senior Buck Roggeman said. "I
think that's sort of the attitude
the team is taking.
"It's an attitude the team's

taken before, going up against a
big overdog and doing everything
we can to beat 'em."
Stanford will go against the
Troians after losing two more
•.jury this week. Of
fensive guard Chris Dalman found
out that what was thought to be
a pinched nerve in his neck was
actually a bone spur. He will un
dergo surgery a week from tomor
row and faces about a six-month
rehabilitation period.
Tight end Jim Price likely will
miss the game as well. He suffered
a hip pointer against Utah and is
listed as doubtful. Flanker Walter
Batson is listed as uncertain. He
sprained his ankle in practice
Tuesday, and yesterday it was dis
covered that he had also done
something to his knee. His status
remains in doubt while further
tests are performed.
Quarterback Brian Johnson is

probably out with a knee bruise
and a sore shoulder. He had his
knee drained Tuesday night.
The good news is that outside
linebacker Rob Hinckley and tail
back Jay Jay Lasley will play.
Hinckley, a finalist for the pres
tigious Butkus Award, had been
limited through the first two
games by a sprained ankle, then
hurt his back against San Jose

State. He hasn't played since but
should be able to go Saturday.
Lasley sprained his knee against
the Spartans after running wild
in the first seven minutes of the
£jnrre.
Despite the changing faces, the
Cardinal players feel they have a
chance to end USC's 16-game
Pacific-10 Conference winning
streak. "This is a game we're ap
proaching like the Notre Dame
game — an opportunity to show
what we have," outside linebacker
Chris Hawkins said. "I think
we're going to be well-prepared
for this game going in. I think
we have a shot at upsetting USC."
The Cardinal seems ready as
the team had its most fired-up
practice of the year yesterday.
Both the defensive and offensive
players wildly cheered the players
involved in the practice-ending
scrimmage.
