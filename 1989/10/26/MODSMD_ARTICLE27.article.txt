# Athletes of the Week
## 
### 
While the Bay Area was hit by a large
earthquake last week, most Stanford sport
ing events went on as scheduled. Despite
the unusual circumstances, two Cardinal
athletes remained unshaken — at least
enough to win Athlete of the Week honors.
Based on their performances last week,
the winners are Tonya Antonucci of the
soccer team and Jonathan Stark of the ten-

nis team.
Antonucci, a 5-foot-4 senior midfielder
from Everett, Wash., scored three times for
the 20th-ranked Cardinal last week.
Tuesday, Oct. 17, Antonucci took a cross
and put it past the UC-Davis goalkeeper
right before halftime. Stanford also received
goals from freshmen Anne Hoge and Julie
Foudy in the 3-0 win at Harry Maloney
Field. The victory ran the Cardinal's home
mark to a perfect 7-0.
Stanford traveled to the Virginia Invita
tional to meet Duke and No. 3 Virginia.
Saturday Stanford took the field against the
Blue Devils, a team that is just out of the
national top 20.
The Cardinal fell behind early and trailed
1-0 at the half. Antonucci responded for
Stanford, however, and scored two goals in
the second half to secure the 2-1 win. After
giving No. 1 North Carolina its first blemish
of the season, a 0-0 tie, Stanford is now
10-4-2 on the year.

Stark, a freshman from Medford, Ore.,
began his Stanford career in style, advancing
to the finals of the Volvo Collegiate Cham
pionships in both singles and doubles.
Stark started by beating TCU's Luis
Ruette 7-5, 6-3. He then upset fifth-seeded
Jose-Luis Noriega of San Diego 7-5, 7-6.
He knocked off Kansas' John Falbo 6-2,
6-4 and South Carolina's Stephane Simian
6-4, 5-7, 6-4 to reach the final. There he

fell to third-seeded A 1 Parker of Georgia
6-3, 7-6.
In the doubles, Stark teamed with class
mate Jared Palmer and advanced to the
final by winning a third-set tiebreaker 12-10.
In the final they lost 3-6, 6-3, 6-3 to Doug
Eisenman and Matt Lucena of California.
