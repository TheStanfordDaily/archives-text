INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) -
The Los Angeles Kings' NHL
record string of 273 games
without being shut out was
snapped Wednesday night
when Calgary goalie Rick
Wamsley, starting in place of
the ailing Mike Vernon,
stopped 23 shots, leading the
Flames to a 5-0 victory.
The Kings last failed to score
on March 12, 1986, against
Detroit goalie Greg Stefan at
the Forum. Their record string
included playoff games.

The Kings fell three short of
the regular-season record of
264 consecutive games without
being shut out set by the
Flames from Nov. 12, 1981,
through Jan. 9, 1985.
The shutout was the first of
the season for Wamsley and
11th of his career. He started
because Vernon was suffering
from back spasms.
Mullen set up a goal by Biard
Mac Guineas at 14:06 that gave
Calgary a 3-0 lead after two
periods.
