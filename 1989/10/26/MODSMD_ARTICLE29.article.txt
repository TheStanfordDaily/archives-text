## 
### Mark Rogowsky Senior staff writer 
Today, the rest of the collegiate
tennis world will get its first
chance to see just how far it has
progressed compared to Stanford.
The Riviera Ail-American Ten
nis Championships, the first of
three preseason tournaments,
kicks off in Pacific Palisades,
Calif., with five Stanford players
in the 32-woman draw. Twenty of
the top 23 players in the
Volvo/Intercollegiate Tennis
Coaches Association rankings will
compete in the four-day event.
Last season, the Cardinal
women went 16-1 in matches
against players from other
schools. This time defending
NCAA champion and No. 1 seed
Sandra Birch will join third
seeded Lisa Green, fourth seeded
Debbie Graham, Meredith
McGrath and Teri Whitlinger in
an attempt to better that mark.
Stanford, the four-time defend
ing NCAA champion, has the lar
gest contingent from any one
school with five. There are four
players from USC, and three each
from Georgia and UCLA.
Birch will meet UCLA's Stella
Sampras in the first round this
morning. Green squares off with
Trisha Laux of USC — the hard
est hitter in the college game.
Graham meets Pepperdine's

Noelle Porter whose claim to fame
i9 that she eliminated top-seed
Tami Whitlinger in the first
round of the NCAA individuals
last year. She went on to the semi
finals.
In her first intercollegiate
match, McGrath, who is seeded
in the so-called 5-8 group (the
exact positions are not released),
meets Candy Kopetzki of Indiana.
Teri Whitlinger will take on Anya
Kochoff of USC who made the
main draw by qualifying.
All players who win first-round
matches also will compete in a
second match icday. If that's not
enough to keep them busy, there
is a round of doubles as well.
Stanford will have two doubles
teams in the tournament. NCAA
doubles semifinalists Birch and
Graham are seeded No. 1. Stan
ford's second pair is McGrath and
Whitlinger. They'll be watched
closely since they're a new team
which many believe could go far.
Kylie Johnson and Heather Wil
lens attempted to qualify for the
doubles but lost yesterday to
UCLA's Kirsten Dreyer and
Iwalani McCalla 6-0, 2-6, 6-2.
Both Stanford duos are taking
on teams from Arizona State.
Birch and Graham will meet
Kristi Jonkosky and Luann Klim
chock. McGrath and Whitlinger
