# Japanese business leaders question 'pampering' with MB As
## 
### Norihiko Shirouzu 
As more Japanese financial institutions
send their future managers to U.S.
schools for master's degrees in business
administration, a deep suspicion exists
among Japanese business leaders that
their U.S. counterparts are pampering
employees with MBAs.
In an increasingly loud voice, these
Japanese leaders are blaming and sin
gling out American business schools for
reinforcing, if not triggering, a threaten
ing trend in the United States away from
manufacturing industries. This trend,
they say, will further aggravate trade im
balances between the United States and
Japan by not creating enough consumer
products to sell to Japan.
Akio Morita, chairman of the Sony
Corp., is perhaps the most blunt critic:

"U.S. business schools can teach how to
analyze statistics and cope with sophis
ticated accounting methods. What they
don't teach is how to motivate and en
courage workers.

News analysis

"They don't think twice about firing
and laying off workers, while in Japan
the feeling is that workers and senior
managers share the same fate. Their
(U.S. managers') biggest deficiency is
that they have forgotten companies are
companies because of the people who
work for them."
Morita goes on to blame American busi
ness schools for "the decline of the U.S.
economy," saying that these schools have

"deprived American manufacturers of in
ternational competitiveness."
Stanford officials at the Graduate
School of Business disagree. They feel
that singling out American business
schools for the recent decline in interna
tional competitiveness by U.S. manufac
turers, such as auto makers, is unfair.
Charles Bonini, associate dean for ac
ademic affairs at the Business School,
argues that business schools are aimed
essentially at teaching people how to work
effectively within the framework of
today's business conditions.
"Business schools are, like (manufac
tured goods), somewhat market respon
sive. To some extent we produce products
that the market wants. And to the extent
American industry was not interested in
people with manufacturing interests and
skills, we responded to that," he says.

At Honda Motor Co., one of the few
Japanese manufacturers with extensive
exposure to American-groomed manage
ment techniques, MBA-holders are a
rarity. Instead, Honda has traditionally
been run by hands-on managers and will
likely remain an "engineers' paradise"
for some time.
Honda's legendary founder, Soichiro
Honda, who retired in 1973, is far from
a businessman. Rather, he is a self-taught
engineering genius with a zeal for motor
racing.
"It's not that we have any hang-ups
with a person's field of education," says
Tetsuo Chino, a former Honda managing
director and also head of its North Amer
ican operations. "Still, we do believe
hands-on experience should form the core
of managers' skills throughout their
ranks."

Honda's current president, Tadashi
Kume, is a Formula One engine specialist,
while his predecessor, Kiyoshi Kawas
hima, capped Honda's foray into racing
fame as head of the Honda Motor racing
team.
Chino says Honda does not indulge in
theory or speculations and does not
"really see anything special about a MBA
education."
Bonini, on the other hand, says that
the Business School tries to balance the
ory with practicality: "We do try tc give
people theoretical foundations. But the
primary aim is to be practical and useful
in the framework of today's business
reality."
Acknowledging Morita and Chino's
claim. Bonini says, "It's probably true
that business schools have not
been as quick to take up some of
the (manufacturing) ideas and in
novations introduced by the
Japanese. But it's a problem that
I think is being redressed that
indeed there is a [renewed] inter
est in manufacturing at most
American business schools."
The scarcity of executives with
business degrees at the top of the
Japanese corporate hierarchy is
not unique to Honda. Most
Japanese manufacturers, even if
they have employees with MBAs,
do not usually pamper them and
prefer managers with diverse
hands-on experience to run their
operations.
If there is one reason why
Japanese makers want to send

their future managers to U.S.
business schools, it is most likely
the web of business contacts these
schools offer, says Akira Nagano,
a spokesman for Matsushita
Electric Industrial Co.
Like Chino and Morita, many
top management officials in the
Japanese manufacturing industry
look at the recent rise in the num
ber of Japanese business degree
holders with a strong sense of cau
tion.
These officials worry that the
fundamental ideas of business
school training go against
Japanese corporate culture and
that the rise in the number of
MBAs heralds a loss of the na
tion's most qualified human re
sources to the "money game"
industry.
Many Japanese leaders claim
that highly individualistic MBA
managers seem too obsessed with
quick results and personal

achievement, while the philosophy
of Japanese company manage
ment emphasizes long-term per
spectives and teamwork.
Takashi Kiriku, a senior wage
and personnel policy researcher
for the Japan Federation of Em
ployers' Associations, argues that
a business school education
wrongly teaches executives to
treat blue-collar workers as "capi
tal."
According to Kiriku, a Japanese
executive "feels he is still one of
the 'salarymen' even when he
knows he has climbed atop the
corporate hierarchy."
Top manufacturing industry ex
ecutives make it clear that the
doors are opened as wide for MBA
degree holders as for those with
other educational backgrounds.
The only twist to their as
surance is that, unlike at many
U.S. companies, a MBA degree
doesn't automatically put employ-

ees in the fast lane of corporate
tracks. Chances are that the per
son coming into Sony, Honda and
other Japanese makers will be
sent to a sales outlet or to an
assembly plant regardless of
qualifications.
Still, while the Japanese man
agement style has proven success
ful, there is no denying top
Japanese executives are faced
with an increasingly serious ques
tion: Should the fate of a company
continue to be left solely in the
hands of engineers and others
lacking cutting-edge management

skills?
The seriousness of this question
came out earlier this year in what
has been considered a U.S.-style
corporate green mail staged by
Texas oilman and takeover artist
T. Boone Pickens on Koito Man
ufacturing Co., a major auto
component maker affiliated with
Toyota Motor Corp.
Pickens' apparent bid for Koito
— he demanded a seat on Koito's
board of directors — could be a
prophecy of what Japanese com
panies may face in the future.
Japanese MBA holders, in the
meantime, feel they are rewarded
with neither the respect nor the
monetary compensation they may
deserve after rigorous business
school training, though manufac
turing officials insist such a
feeling has not resulted in any
extensive drain of MBA managers
to foreign companies.
Those with business degrees

working for Japanese companies
commonly complain that others
are ignorant about the "sig
nificance" of an MBA education.
For instance, an anonymous
manager with a middle-echelon
position at a major Japanese
maker says he is frustrated that
his superiors fail to recognize the
personal growth he achieved while
working for his MBA.
"We spent two years studying
our butts off and come back and
find our bosses thinking we spent
two years partying. That's dis
couraging," he says.
Though official figures indicat
ing the exact number of Japanese
MBAs are not available, some un
official statistics put the current
number at 2,500. Indications are
that the number of Japanese MBA
students is on the rise, despite
the alarms sounded by some in
dustry leaders.

In an increasingly loud voice, these
Japanese leaders are blaming and sin
gling out American business schools for
reinforcing, if not triggering, a threaten
ing trend in the United States away from
manufacturing industries. This trend,
they say, will further aggravate trade im
balances between the United States and
Japan by not creating enough consumer
products to sell to Japan.
Akio Morita, chairman of the Sony
Corp., is perhaps the most blunt critic:

"U.S. business schools can teach how to
analyze statistics and cope with sophis
ticated accounting methods. What they
don't teach is how to motivate and en
courage workers.

News analysis

"They don't think twice about firing
and laying off workers, while in Japan
the feeling is that workers and senior
managers share the same fate. Their
(U.S. managers') biggest deficiency is
that they have forgotten companies are
companies because of the people who
work for them."
Morita goes on to blame American busi
ness schools for "the decline of the U.S.
economy," saying that these schools have

"deprived American manufacturers of in
ternational competitiveness."
Stanford officials at the Graduate
School of Business disagree. They feel
that singling out American business
schools for the recent decline in interna
tional competitiveness by U.S. manufac
turers, such as auto makers, is unfair.
Charles Bonini, associate dean for ac
ademic affairs at the Business School,
argues that business schools are aimed
essentially at teaching people how to work
effectively within the framework of
today's business conditions.
"Business schools are, like (manufac
tured goods), somewhat market respon
sive. To some extent we produce products
that the market wants. And to the extent
American industry was not interested in
people with manufacturing interests and
skills, we responded to that," he says.

At Honda Motor Co., one of the few
Japanese manufacturers with extensive
exposure to American-groomed manage
ment techniques, MBA-holders are a
rarity. Instead, Honda has traditionally
been run by hands-on managers and will
likely remain an "engineers' paradise"
for some time.
Honda's legendary founder, Soichiro
Honda, who retired in 1973, is far from
a businessman. Rather, he is a self-taught
engineering genius with a zeal for motor
racing.
"It's not that we have any hang-ups
with a person's field of education," says
Tetsuo Chino, a former Honda managing
director and also head of its North Amer
ican operations. "Still, we do believe
hands-on experience should form the core
of managers' skills throughout their
ranks."

Honda's current president, Tadashi
Kume, is a Formula One engine specialist,
while his predecessor, Kiyoshi Kawas
hima, capped Honda's foray into racing
fame as head of the Honda Motor racing
team.
Chino says Honda does not indulge in
theory or speculations and does not
"really see anything special about a MBA
education."
Bonini, on the other hand, says that
the Business School tries to balance the
ory with practicality: "We do try tc give
people theoretical foundations. But the
primary aim is to be practical and useful
in the framework of today's business
reality."
Acknowledging Morita and Chino's
claim. Bonini says, "It's probably true
that business schools have not
been as quick to take up some of
the (manufacturing) ideas and in
novations introduced by the
Japanese. But it's a problem that
I think is being redressed that
indeed there is a [renewed] inter
est in manufacturing at most
American business schools."
The scarcity of executives with
business degrees at the top of the
Japanese corporate hierarchy is
not unique to Honda. Most
Japanese manufacturers, even if
they have employees with MBAs,
do not usually pamper them and
prefer managers with diverse
hands-on experience to run their
operations.
If there is one reason why
Japanese makers want to send

their future managers to U.S.
business schools, it is most likely
the web of business contacts these
schools offer, says Akira Nagano,
a spokesman for Matsushita
Electric Industrial Co.
Like Chino and Morita, many
top management officials in the
Japanese manufacturing industry
look at the recent rise in the num
ber of Japanese business degree
holders with a strong sense of cau
tion.
These officials worry that the
fundamental ideas of business
school training go against
Japanese corporate culture and
that the rise in the number of
MBAs heralds a loss of the na
tion's most qualified human re
sources to the "money game"
industry.
Many Japanese leaders claim
that highly individualistic MBA
managers seem too obsessed with
quick results and personal

achievement, while the philosophy
of Japanese company manage
ment emphasizes long-term per
spectives and teamwork.
Takashi Kiriku, a senior wage
and personnel policy researcher
for the Japan Federation of Em
ployers' Associations, argues that
a business school education
wrongly teaches executives to
treat blue-collar workers as "capi
tal."
According to Kiriku, a Japanese
executive "feels he is still one of
the 'salarymen' even when he
knows he has climbed atop the
corporate hierarchy."
Top manufacturing industry ex
ecutives make it clear that the
doors are opened as wide for MBA
degree holders as for those with
other educational backgrounds.
The only twist to their as
surance is that, unlike at many
U.S. companies, a MBA degree
doesn't automatically put employ-

ees in the fast lane of corporate
tracks. Chances are that the per
son coming into Sony, Honda and
other Japanese makers will be
sent to a sales outlet or to an
assembly plant regardless of
qualifications.
Still, while the Japanese man
agement style has proven success
ful, there is no denying top
Japanese executives are faced
with an increasingly serious ques
tion: Should the fate of a company
continue to be left solely in the
hands of engineers and others
lacking cutting-edge management

skills?
The seriousness of this question
came out earlier this year in what
has been considered a U.S.-style
corporate green mail staged by
Texas oilman and takeover artist
T. Boone Pickens on Koito Man
ufacturing Co., a major auto
component maker affiliated with
Toyota Motor Corp.
Pickens' apparent bid for Koito
— he demanded a seat on Koito's
board of directors — could be a
prophecy of what Japanese com
panies may face in the future.
Japanese MBA holders, in the
meantime, feel they are rewarded
with neither the respect nor the
monetary compensation they may
deserve after rigorous business
school training, though manufac
turing officials insist such a
feeling has not resulted in any
extensive drain of MBA managers
to foreign companies.
Those with business degrees

working for Japanese companies
commonly complain that others
are ignorant about the "sig
nificance" of an MBA education.
For instance, an anonymous
manager with a middle-echelon
position at a major Japanese
maker says he is frustrated that
his superiors fail to recognize the
personal growth he achieved while
working for his MBA.
"We spent two years studying
our butts off and come back and
find our bosses thinking we spent
two years partying. That's dis
couraging," he says.
Though official figures indicat
ing the exact number of Japanese
MBAs are not available, some un
official statistics put the current
number at 2,500. Indications are
that the number of Japanese MBA
students is on the rise, despite
the alarms sounded by some in
dustry leaders.
As more Japanese financial institutions
send their future managers to U.S.
schools for master's degrees in business
administration, a deep suspicion exists
among Japanese business leaders that
their U.S. counterparts are pampering
employees with MBAs.
In an increasingly loud voice, these
Japanese leaders are blaming and sin
