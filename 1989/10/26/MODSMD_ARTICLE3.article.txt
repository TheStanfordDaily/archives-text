# Japanese business leaders question 'pampering' with MB As

### Norihiko Shirouzu 
As more Japanese financial institutions
send their future managers to U.S.
schools for master's degrees in business
administration, a deep suspicion exists
among Japanese business leaders that
their U.S. counterparts are pampering
employees with MBAs.
In an increasingly loud voice, these
Japanese leaders are blaming and sin
gling out American business schools for
reinforcing, if not triggering, a threaten
ing trend in the United States away from
manufacturing industries. This trend,
they say, will further aggravate trade im
balances between the United States and
Japan by not creating enough consumer
products to sell to Japan.
Akio Morita, chairman of the Sony
Corp., is perhaps the most blunt critic:

"U.S. business schools can teach how to
analyze statistics and cope with sophis
ticated accounting methods. What they
don't teach is how to motivate and en
courage workers.

"They don't think twice about firing
and laying off workers, while in Japan
the feeling is that workers and senior
managers share the same fate. Their
(U.S. managers') biggest deficiency is
that they have forgotten companies are
companies because of the people who
work for them."
Morita goes on to blame American busi
ness schools for "the decline of the U.S.
economy," saying that these schools have

"deprived American manufacturers of in
ternational competitiveness."
Stanford officials at the Graduate
School of Business disagree. They feel
that singling out American business
schools for the recent decline in interna
tional competitiveness by U.S. manufac
turers, such as auto makers, is unfair.
Charles Bonini, associate dean for ac
ademic affairs at the Business School,
argues that business schools are aimed
essentially at teaching people how to work
effectively within the framework of
today's business conditions.
"Business schools are, like (manufac
tured goods), somewhat market respon
sive. To some extent we produce products
that the market wants. And to the extent
American industry was not interested in
people with manufacturing interests and
skills, we responded to that," he says.

At Honda Motor Co., one of the few
Japanese manufacturers with extensive
exposure to American-groomed manage
ment techniques, MBA-holders are a
rarity. Instead, Honda has traditionally
been run by hands-on managers and will
likely remain an "engineers' paradise"
for some time.
Honda's legendary founder, Soichiro
Honda, who retired in 1973, is far from
a businessman. Rather, he is a self-taught
engineering genius with a zeal for motor
racing.
"It's not that we have any hang-ups
with a person's field of education," says
Tetsuo Chino, a former Honda managing
director and also head of its North Amer
ican operations. "Still, we do believe
hands-on experience should form the core
of managers' skills throughout their
ranks."

Honda's current president, Tadashi
Kume, is a Formula One engine specialist,
while his predecessor, Kiyoshi Kawas
hima, capped Honda's foray into racing
fame as head of the Honda Motor racing
team.
Chino says Honda does not indulge in
theory or speculations and does not
"really see anything special about a MBA
education."
Bonini, on the other hand, says that
the Business School tries to balance the
ory with practicality: "We do try tc give
people theoretical foundations. But the
primary aim is to be practical and useful
in the framework of today's business
reality."
Acknowledging Morita and Chino's
claim. Bonini says, "It's probably true
