# Baseball takes back seat to books in fall
## 
### Lora Dawn Headrick Staff writer 
While last Tuesday's earthquake disrupted
the annual rites of Mtyor League Baseball,
indefinitely postponing the Fall Classic, the
timeless cycle of the sport remains unchanged.
As the 1989 Mayor League Baseball season
draws to its long-awaited close, Stanford's
baseball team is just gearing up for the season
ahead.
Coach Mark Marquess, beginning his 14th
year at the helm of the Cardinal baseball
team, spends fall quarter preparing his players
physically and mentally for the start of regular
play in February. "We want the freshmen to
get familiar with the university, and we want
everybody to get adjusted academically before
we launch into the heaviest part of our
schedule [during winter quarter]," Marquess
said. To help the players make that adjust
ment, Marquess maintains what he terms a
"low-key" practice schedule during the fall.
In contrast to other college baseball teams
that often practice six days a week, Stanford's
team works out for about four hours every
weekday afternoon.
"The schedule is good for our older players
that have the labs they can only take in the
afternoon," Marquess said, adding that
players will occasionally need to miss a prac
tice because of an academic conflict.
While fall quarter practices are structured
to allow for some flexibility in that area, the
workouts during that time are important to
the later success of the team. "We spend a
lot of time on the fundamentals," Marquess

said. "Lots of ground balls, hitting, fielding,
et cetera."
Practices also include simulated games,
inter-squad play and occassional scrimmages
with other college teams in the area. According
to Marquess, such scrimmages give valuable
experience to new players without placing
heavy demands on their study time.
"We're fortunate in that we have an excel
lent baseball facility at Stanford," he said.
"Most of the teams travel here for scrimmages,
so our players don't miss a lot of class-time
on the road."
Fall practice lasts about six or seven weeks,
said Marquess, and ends in time for the players
to prepare for finals week. Because the team's
fall schedule is less demanding, most team
members take their heaviest academic load
during fall quarter. David Holbrook, a soph
omore who plays third base, says such an
arrangement works well for him.
"I usually try to take 18 units in the fall,"
Holbrook said. "Most of us take a lot of classes
then." While Holbrook and his teammates
have more time to study during the fall, their
schedules may still become overwhelming.
"Coach is pretty understanding," Holbrook
explained. "If you get really backed up or
need to come to practice late, you can just
tell him and he'll give you some time."
Coach Marquess' interest in the academic
progress of his players reflects a larger pur
pose behind his coaching at Stanford. "I want
these guys to really learn something from the
program," Marquess said.
"They're here because they want to play

ball, but they're also here hesause they want
a Stanford degree," he added. Marquess
pointed out that many good "baseball schools"
are not as academically rigorous as Stanford.
"Our players enjoy the academic challenge,"
he continued. "It's very important for Stan
ford's baseball program to succeed, to prove
that you don't have to sacrifice academics to
have a good baseball team."
In fact, the degree to which the baseball
program at Stanford successfully integrates
academics and athletics forces the best Car
dinal players to make some difficult decisions.
One such player is Paul Carey, a senior who
was drafted last spring by the Detroit Tigers.
Carey, an outfielder who led the Cardinal
in home runs last year, turned down a sub
stantial bonus to return to Stanford for one
more year of college play and his Stanford
degree.
Faced with a similar decision, Brian
Johnson, a two-sport athlete who started as
Stanford's quarterback this fall, chose to leave
Cardinal baseball and sign a professional con
tract with the Yankees.
Marquess feels that both Carey and Johnson
made good decisions. "The thing I insist upon
with guys who decide they want to sign a pro
career is that they have a plan to graduate
on time," he said.
"In Brian's case he took summer school and
he was ahead, so a pro contract was a good
opportunity for him. As it's worked out, the
Yankees are paying for the rest of his school
here."

Until the season starts, sophomore Rob Robblns will be thinking
more about academics than gunning down runners.
