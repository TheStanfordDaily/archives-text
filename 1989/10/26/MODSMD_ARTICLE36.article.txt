# Exploring the dark side
## Soviet performers transcend the boundaries 
### Susan McKean 
Leningrad. Summer. 1988. Derevo
is a Soviet performance group that
lives rather than rehearses. But
they live differently. They discover their
space over and over, explore their bodies,
play with light.
Derevo's theater is the black heart of
the grey cement monster called The
Palace of Youth. One hundred and
twenty-five of us Russian language stu
dents fill its lungs and its pockets; only
by chance do some of us sit on the
bleachers as spectators and specters in
the darkness of Derevo's third-floor
studio.
Naked bodies swing on black pipes,
beginning and ending here. They crawl
and scratch, give birth, evolve from
dinosaurs to proletarians and loom as
Red shadowpuppcts. Off-tune ragtirfie
and bells hidden in blackness accom
pany the iconoclasm, fantasy and
primordial athleticism of the miming.
A ring of the Russian circus appears.
Or is it a base sketch of lustiness in
pursuit of coyness? My hair is con
spicuously excessive. I watch bald heads
rolling, lithe bodies stretching and
muscles flexing to crack into dust a
dried, finger-painted image of a tree.

"Derevo" means tree in Russian.
San Francisco. Autumn. 1989. Derevo
has left the chambers I knew. I suggest
the earthquake was its herald. It shocked
the City the way Derevo will captivate
audiences. Neither attempts to explain
itself. Each changes the lives of wit
nesses. It's not about laughing or crying
or nodding knowingly. It's disturbing
and riveting and beautiful.
Derevo challenges traditional theatri
cal concepts of story, plot and character.
It indulges violent movement,
sculptural images, irreverent humor and
makes spirituality carnal. The group
plumbs the depths of the human con
dition, expressing, as they say, "the un
derground network of roots, rather than
the ephemeral beauty of the leaf." Be
lieve them. They don't lie; they only
move or freeze motion.

Due to earthquake relief funding, all
Derevo performances will be free. The
group is appearing at Life On The Water
theater at Fort Mason in San Francisco
today through Saturday at 8 p.m., and
Sunday at 2 p.m. Derevo is presented
by Life On The Water and the Soviet-
American Performing Arts Exchange.
For tickets call 776-8999, or 931-2593
