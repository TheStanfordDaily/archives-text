# And on the seventh day, Jim Bakker begat and got 45 years

CHARLOTTE (AP) - "PTL Club" host
Jim Bakker was sentenced to 45 years in
prison Tuesday after being convicted of
cheating his followers out of millions of
dollars and using the money to have his
wife's face excavated.
He will not be eligible for parole until
next Tuesday.
According to Bakker, he and wife
Tammy Face will continue to broadcast
their snow from prison, although they will
rename the program "The Pick The Lock
Club.''
And so ends a couple of lousy years in
the world of telerehgion:
• Jim Bakker is behind bars.
• Jimmy Swaggart has been unfrocked
• Jessica Hahn posed nude for Playboy,
and in the process had her breasts enlarged
to the size of dirigibles Really. You could
sell advertising space on those things
Clearly, this nation is going to Hell. We
need to get back to that good old-time
religion and regain our treasured values.
We need chastity and obediencv. We need
fire and brimstone In fact, I think that's
the whole problem right in a nutshell.
You just can't get good brimstone any
more. Tty walking into your neighborhood

7-Eleven sometime and asking tor a six
pack of brimstone. You'll see that our
nation is going to Hell in a Big Gulp.
So I am proposing a three-point plan
which I believe will get this country back
on its feet, religionwise:
(1) An hour a day of prayer in the
schools, preferably during my philosophy
lecture (MWF 10-11).
(2) Federal tax breaks for churches, ex
cept those that hold weddings for 4,000
couples simultaneously or have silly
names like Our Lady of tne Medium-Sized
Herbivorous Rodent.
(3) A regular regimen of study in"The
Bible" (1541 8.C., Hebrew University
Press, $19.95).
I think this third point is most impor
tant. Not nearly enough people are familiar
with the Bible, which was written by God
one evening when he was stuck in a hotel
room, and not found until years later when
a bunch of Hebrews were partying it up
and came upon the manuscript in the
nightstand drawer.
Originally, the Bible comprised of only
the Old Testament, but when the pub
lishers saw how well it was selling they
put out a sequel called the New Testa
ment. The next sequel — The Bible III:

Jason Takes Manhattan — didn't sell well
at all.
Today, the Bible is one of the best-selling
books in the world, right up there with
Barbara Cartland's "Lustful and Passionate
Sweaty Virgin Nights." Some bookstores
sell them together as a boxed set.
The Bible Story
The Old Testament begins with
Genesis, which was written by Phil Col
lins. He (God, not Phil Collins) creates
the heavens and the earth in six days,
leaving the final day for resting. The
seventh day comes to be known as the
"Sussudio." (Genesis 2:3)
Next, God made human beings, and
before long they began laying with each
other and begetting more human beings.
There was a lot of begetting going on back
then, probably because men used fig leaves
as condoms. (Amos 'n Andy 15:7)
When man and woman had finished
begetting, God decided to play a silly joke
on all tne world and have a great flood.
So Noah built a great ark, and all the
animals came two by two, although most
of them brought far too much luggage and
ended up spending the entire trip packing

and unpacking. (Marsupials 3:19)
The rest of the Old Tfcstament is devoted
to famous historical couples: Sampson and
Rapunzel, David and Godzilla, Bill and
Tro. They spend most of their in
Egypt, being pestered by the plagues:
Blood, Frogs, Sand, Locusts, Pyramids,
Blight, Problem Sets, Mothers-in-law ana
Cheez Wiz.
In the end, Moses goes to Mount
Sinewave, where he receives the Ten
Amendments, and soon thereafter leads
the Hebrews out of Egypt and into Israel.
Israel later becomes Known as "The

Promised Land," mainly because they got
it in writing. (Ecstasies 14:2)
This is where the Old Testament ends
and the New Testament begins. The New
Tfestament is mainlv about Jesus, who
was the son of David, son of Abraham,
father of Isaac, brother of Tamar, sister
of Judah, neighbor of Willy, lawyer of
Obed, second husband of lessica, room
mate of Jehoshaphat, proctologist of Uriah
•rid parole officer of Bun. (Galoshes 19:12)
Jesus could do many wonderful and
miraculous things although he would
sometimes do them at the wrong times.
For instance, often at fraternity parties,
instead of turning the water in the punch
bowl into wine, he would walk across it.
{Chewbacca 4:3)
Still, Jesus overcame these handicaps
and went on to have an entire epithet
named after him, as well as a maior re
ligion. He also appealed in last year's con
troversial Martin Scorsese film about a
black singing group that is killed while
performing on the Bob Hope Christmas
Special — "The Last Christmas of the
Temptations " (Hey Jude 7:1)

Jim Bakker was sentenced to 45 years in
prison Tuesday after being convicted of
cheating his followers out of millions of
dollars and using the money to have his
wife's face excavated.
He will not be eligible for parole until
next Tuesday.
According to Bakker, he and wife
Tammy Face will continue to broadcast
their snow from prison, although they will
rename the program "The Pick The Lock
Club.''
And so ends a couple of lousy years in
the world of telerehgion:
• Jim Bakker is behind bars.
• Jimmy Swaggart has been unfrocked
• Jessica Hahn posed nude for Playboy,
and in the process had her breasts enlarged
to the size of dirigibles Really. You could
sell advertising space on those things
Clearly, this nation is going to Hell. We
need to get back to that good old-time
religion and regain our treasured values.
We need chastity and obediencv. We need
fire and brimstone In fact, I think that's
the whole problem right in a nutshell.
You just can't get good brimstone any
more. Tty walking into your neighborhood

7-Eleven sometime and asking tor a six
pack of brimstone. You'll see that our
nation is going to Hell in a Big Gulp.
So I am proposing a three-point plan
which I believe will get this country back
on its feet, religionwise:
(1) An hour a day of prayer in the
schools, preferably during my philosophy
lecture (MWF 10-11).
(2) Federal tax breaks for churches, ex
cept those that hold weddings for 4,000
couples simultaneously or have silly
names like Our Lady of tne Medium-Sized
Herbivorous Rodent.
(3) A regular regimen of study in"The
Bible" (1541 8.C., Hebrew University
Press, $19.95).
I think this third point is most impor
tant. Not nearly enough people are familiar
with the Bible, which was written by God
one evening when he was stuck in a hotel
room, and not found until years later when
a bunch of Hebrews were partying it up
and came upon the manuscript in the
nightstand drawer.
Originally, the Bible comprised of only
the Old Testament, but when the pub
lishers saw how well it was selling they
put out a sequel called the New Testa
ment. The next sequel — The Bible III:

Jason Takes Manhattan — didn't sell well
at all.
Today, the Bible is one of the best-selling
books in the world, right up there with
Barbara Cartland's "Lustful and Passionate
Sweaty Virgin Nights." Some bookstores
sell them together as a boxed set.
The Bible Story
The Old Testament begins with
Genesis, which was written by Phil Col
lins. He (God, not Phil Collins) creates
the heavens and the earth in six days,
leaving the final day for resting. The
seventh day comes to be known as the
"Sussudio." (Genesis 2:3)
Next, God made human beings, and
before long they began laying with each
other and begetting more human beings.
There was a lot of begetting going on back
then, probably because men used fig leaves
as condoms. (Amos 'n Andy 15:7)
When man and woman had finished
begetting, God decided to play a silly joke
on all tne world and have a great flood.
So Noah built a great ark, and all the
animals came two by two, although most
of them brought far too much luggage and
ended up spending the entire trip packing

and unpacking. (Marsupials 3:19)
The rest of the Old Tfcstament is devoted
to famous historical couples: Sampson and
Rapunzel, David and Godzilla, Bill and
Tro. They spend most of their in
Egypt, being pestered by the plagues:
Blood, Frogs, Sand, Locusts, Pyramids,
Blight, Problem Sets, Mothers-in-law ana
Cheez Wiz.
In the end, Moses goes to Mount
Sinewave, where he receives the Ten
Amendments, and soon thereafter leads
the Hebrews out of Egypt and into Israel.
Israel later becomes Known as "The

Promised Land," mainly because they got
it in writing. (Ecstasies 14:2)
This is where the Old Testament ends
and the New Testament begins. The New
Tfestament is mainlv about Jesus, who
was the son of David, son of Abraham,
father of Isaac, brother of Tamar, sister
of Judah, neighbor of Willy, lawyer of
Obed, second husband of lessica, room
mate of Jehoshaphat, proctologist of Uriah
•rid parole officer of Bun. (Galoshes 19:12)
Jesus could do many wonderful and
miraculous things although he would
sometimes do them at the wrong times.
For instance, often at fraternity parties,
instead of turning the water in the punch
bowl into wine, he would walk across it.
{Chewbacca 4:3)
