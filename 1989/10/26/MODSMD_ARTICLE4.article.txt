# Post office, COP working together to reduce delays
## 
### Andrea Kohn Staff writer 
The Stanford Post Office and the Council of Presi
dents have begun to work together to reduce long
lines and delays at the post office.
Stanford branch manager Paul Panelo and COP
member Chin-Chin Chen recently met twice to iden
tify the problems facing the post office and to con
sider possible solutions.
"We have a lot of problems," Panelo said. "It will
take a while to get things straightened out, but I
think that with the cooperation of the COP, we'll
have a good operation."
Panelo, who became manager of the Stanford
branch about five weeks ago, said he does not have
enough staff to handle all the mail that comes
through the post office. Currently, there are 16
clerks, nine carriers and two supervisors.
"A lot of people go through here stressed out
because of the demands put on them," Panelo said.
A team of experts from the main post office in
Palo Alto will visit Stanford sometime before Christ
mas to determine whether or not Stanford's branch
needs more staff.
During the school year, the Stanford branch
handles about 10,000 letters, 2,875 flats and 250
packages per day for the post office boxes alone.
Stanford has 10 times the number of post office
boxes in any of the three other branches in Palo Alto.
When students converge on the post office during
lunch and after classes, long lines form, adding to
the branch's problems.
But the post office is planning some improve
ments.
Panelo stud that he is expecting another clerk
Oct. 30. When the new clerk arrives, Panelo will
open up an extra window to handle yellow slips,
passports, meters and inquiries.
Panelo also plans to place three
or four stamp vending machines
around campus at sites to be de
termined. Panelo said he does not
know when the machines will be
installed.
In addition, at the meetings
Chen proposed several measures
the COP developed to help alle
viate the strain on the post office.
This week, the COP will post
a chart outside the post office out
lining peak hours in order to en
courage use during less busy
times.
Chen said the COP may buy a
postage meter so students can
mail packages from the ASSU of
fice. According to Chen, students
would bring their packages to the
ASSU offices to be weighed and
stamped. Students would pay the
amount of the postage to the
ASSU, which would then mail all
the packages at the end of the day.
Finally, the COP may create a
service to pick up students'
packages and distribute them. But
Panelo said the issue of liability
would create problems for the
COP.
Approval for this proposal lies
with the Palo Alto postmaster.
"The post office would not want
to be liable for any missing
packages," Panelo said. "We want
to stay away from that. We've got
to have some assurances."
