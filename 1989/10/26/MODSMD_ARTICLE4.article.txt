The Stanford Post Office and the Council of Presi
dents have begun to work together to reduce long
lines and delays at the post office.
Stanford branch manager Paul Panelo and COP
member Chin-Chin Chen recently met twice to iden
tify the problems facing the post office and to con
sider possible solutions.
"We have a lot of problems," Panelo said. "It will
take a while to get things straightened out, but I
think that with the cooperation of the COP, we'll
have a good operation."
Panelo, who became manager of the Stanford
branch about five weeks ago, said he does not have
enough staff to handle all the mail that comes
through the post office. Currently, there are 16
clerks, nine carriers and two supervisors.
"A lot of people go through here stressed out
because of the demands put on them," Panelo said.
A team of experts from the main post office in
Palo Alto will visit Stanford sometime before Christ
mas to determine whether or not Stanford's branch
needs more staff.
During the school year, the Stanford branch
handles about 10,000 letters, 2,875 flats and 250
packages per day for the post office boxes alone.
Stanford has 10 times the number of post office
boxes in any of the three other branches in Palo Alto.
When students converge on the post office during
lunch and after classes, long lines form, adding to
the branch's problems.
But the post office is planning some improve
ments.
Panelo stud that he is expecting another clerk
Oct. 30. When the new clerk arrives, Panelo will
open up an extra window to handle yellow slips,
passports, meters and inquiries.
