# Masters to fiddle Saturday

"Fiddle-dee-dee."
Scarlett O'Hara said it — now you can
see it — Saturday, at the Masters of the
Folk Violin concert in Dinkelspiel Audito
rium.
The Masters are traveling to Stanford as
part of their national tour which celebrates
and demonstrates various folk violin styles
as performed by six acclaimed fiddlers.
The concert will feature the bluegrass fid
dling of Kenny Baker (not the Kenny Baker
who played R2-D2 in "Star Wars"), the Irish
fiddling of Seamus Connolly, Cape Breton
player Joe Cormier, jazz violinist Claude
Williams, Cajun fiddler Michael Doucet and
the Western long bow fiddling of Alison
Krauss. They will be accompanied on guitar,
mandolin, bass and piano.
And these folks aren't just fiddling around.
They're the best of the best. Connolly, who
moved to Boston 13 years ago from his
native Ireland, is a 10-time winner of the
Irish National Championship for traditional

fiddle. Claude Williams is the 81-year-old
former violinist and guitarist in Count
Basie's early band, and is credited as one
of the inventors of jazz violin.
In addition Michael Doucet is lead vocalist
and instrumentalist for the Cajun/zydeco
band Beausoleil, and 17-year-old Alison
Krauss was named the "Best New Talent
of 1988" in the "Frets" magazine readers
poll.
"Fiddlesticks," you say, forever fed up with
fey fiddlers from far afield. Well fear not,
fans, for these fiddlers are not vexing vir
tuoso violinists nor somber Stradavarians,
but rather intriguing instrumentalists whose
separate styles will wow even enemies of
orchestral odes.
Basically, Masters of the Folk Violin is
like a cross between Itzhak Perlman and
Masters of the Universe. The instruments
will be recognizable — but the sound will
be something from out of this world.

Masters of the Folk Violin plays Saturday
at 8 p.m. in Dinkelspiel Auditorium. Tickets
are $15 or 574 (students $3 off).
