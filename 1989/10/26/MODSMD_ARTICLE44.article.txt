# Joel and Dylan recapture their rhythm
## 
### Mark Pinkus Staff writer 
While some veterans are hitting
the road, others are making tracks
from the studio.
This month boasts the release
of two new albums by post-40-
year-old musicians, Billy Joel and
Bob Dylan. Joel's "Storm Front"
and Dylan's "Oh Mercy" are re
naissance releases for the artists
completing their second and third
decades, respectively, in the
songwriting business.
Billy Joel burst onto the scene
in 1973 with the release of "Piano
Man." Showing great promise as
both a relevant lyricist and a cap
tivating vocalist, the New Yorker's
future looked bright. After Joel
peaked in 1977 with "The
Stranger," however, mediocrity and
inconsistency began to take over.
Aside from a few songs off of
the early '80s "Glass House" and
the innovative "Innocent Man,"
the decade has been somewhat dis
appointing from the critic's point
of view. But with time running
out on the '80s, the proud husband
of Christie Brinkley has managed
to write and co-produce his best
album of the decade.
Co-produced by Mick Jones —

former guitarist of Foreigner —
"Storm Front" marks a welcome
return to Joel's original, straight
forward approach to rock 'n' roll.
While his past five albums have
as many good tracks as they have
mediocre, "Front" almost deserves
to be called flawless. If Joel had
just left off the title track — a
tune that sounds too much like
the ones that forced Foreigner to
break up — then the album would
have been one good number after
another.
The first single "We Didn't Start
the Fire," tells the frightening his
tory of our country over the past
40 years. Details that Joel cleverly
works into the lyrics remind us
why he was once considered one
of the top songwriters of the past
20 years.
Other side-one highlights in
clude the soulful rhythms of "The
Downeaster Alexa" and the reflec
tive "I Go to Extremes."
But the creator of such moving
songs as "She's Always a Woman"
and "Good Night Saigon" offers up
the real treat of the album with
the tale that he tells in
"Leningrad."
While alluding to Joel's 1986
tour of the Soviet Union, the track
talks about two men growing up,

'Front' almost
deserves to be called
flawless.

one in Russia and one in America,
and how they were told to hate
each other. It ends with an opti
mistic meeting between these two
men, where Joel sings, "And so 1
came to this place/ To meet him
eye to eye and face to facet He
made my daughter laugh, then
we embraced/ We never knew the
friends we had! Until we came to
Leningrad."
And just as Joel reaches back
into his history to come up with
the honest lyrics that make this
his best album since 1977, Dylan
goes back two years earlier, produc
ing his most poignant work since
1975's "Blood on the Tracks."
Once touted as the greatest
songwriter of all time, Dylan's
wealth of words appeared to have
dried up. His past two albums,
1988's uneven "Down in the
Groove" and the somewhat im
pressive "Knocked Out and
Loaded" from 1986 display only
three songs that were written solely
by Dylan. After earning the repu
tation of being one of the most
borrowed-from writers in the
business, Dylan was reduced to
recording other artist's material.
But "Oh Mercy" boldly declares
that he's back — and this time,
it's with his own words.
Although this release is less than
a month old, people are already
beginning to take notice. Joan
Baez, whose interpretations of such
Dylan classics as "Blowin' in the
Wind," helped launch her own
career, showed her appreciation of

the first album by performing the
spiritually-charged "Ring Them
Bells" at her Oct. 15 Frost concert.
"Ring Them Bells" is probably
the first song since 1975's
"Tangled Up and Blue" that will
be covered by other artists.
Dylan filled side two with slow
songs, beginning with the highly
personal "Most of the Time." On
this track, Dylan confesses, "Most
of the time, my head is screwed
on straight." This is followed by
the even more reflective "What
Good Am I." which opens with
the almost ironic question, "What
good am I if I'm like all the rest?"
"Oh Mercy" rises above Dylan's
albums from the last 15 years, and
over just about everybody else's
albums, as well.
Much of this can be credited to
Daniel Lanois' brilliant production
job. After producing ground
breaking albums such as Peter
Gabriel's "So" and U2's "The Jos
hua Tree," it would be impossible
to ignore Lanois' golden touch.
Luckily, Dylan took advantage of
Lanois' talent.
A word of warning to those
Dylan fans like myself who at first
only heard the overplayed single
"Everything is Broken." It is by no
means indicative of this provoca
tive collection. Who's to say why
record companies chose the worst
song on the album as the promo
tional track.
Yet there is no doubt that "Oh
Mercy" will become an essential
to Dylan followers.
If Dylan's "Oh Mcrcy" and Joel's
"Storm Front" are any indication
of how the aging artist will do
during the '90s, then there is no
need to worry. Other veterans need
only follow suit in pushing them
selves to new heights — instead
of relying on their golden reputa
tions.
