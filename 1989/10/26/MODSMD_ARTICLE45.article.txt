# Fresh paint, pasta delights

Watch out Rudolfo, Cenzo, Ramona,
Frankie, Johnny and Luigi, Too. There's
a new Italian restaurant in town.
II Fornaio Cucina Italiana opened Sat
urday night at the Garden Court Hotel
on Cowper Street, adding a Palo Alto
branch to its impressive list of locations
in Italy and California.
Nestled in the downstairs piazza of the
hotel, the restaurant features an open,
airy bar that offered excellent wine and
II Fornaio's fresh, chewy home-baked Ital
ian bread.
The restaurant is decorated in warm,
earthy tones, and provides both indoor
and outdoor dining in the courtyard of
the Garden Court for breakfast, lunch
and dinner.
Finished just in time for opening night
(the paint on the window by our table
was still wet), the dining room features
hand-painted murals and marble im
ported from the same Italian quarry used
by Michelangelo. You can watch your
food being prepared by white-hatted chefs
in the open kitchen, set off from the
dining room by only a low counter.
The food itself was simple, but tasty.
We began with gamberi e fagiolia, cold
marinated shrimp on a bed of Tuscan
white beans and mozzarella e pomodori,
mozzarella on tomato slices. II Fornaio
grows its own vegetables in Sausalito and
the tomatoes were especially fresh.
For dinner, we tried dal girarrosto tos
can, half of a duck cooked in the rotisserie
and served with vegetables and potatoes.
Prepared in a sweet sauce, the duck was
juicy and quite good. For those not
satisfied with duck, the restaurant will
occasionally be offering a rabbit dish,
prepared similarly to the duck.
In addition to meat, poultry and fish,
II Fornaio also offers pasta and pizza.
Don't let the names of the pasta dishes
prevent you from ordering one. We had

conchiglie ai formaggi e piselli, pasta
shells prepared with gruyere cheese, peas
and lemon in a white cream sauce. Make
sure you're hungry because the dish is
filling and you'll probably want to finish
it — just keep your tie covered.
Though we didn't try the pizza, we
passed one on the way out and it looked
so good that, had I not been too full, I
might have sat back down and ordered
one.
The portions are all quite generous,
and after wine, appetizers and an entree,
you might be tempted to pass on dessert.
Don't.
The desserts are prepared daily in the
restaurant's bakery and are well worth
the calories.
Valentino vestito di nuovo is three
layers of Italian white, Swiss milk and
Belgian dark chocolates served in
raspberry sauce, and wonderfully deca
dent. Less rich, but equally good is the
Tiramisu an Italian sponge cake baked
with rum and espresso and topped with
meringue and cocoa powder.
A suggestion: order one dessert for two
people. It seemed like a crime to not be
able to finish either one.
The high ceilings, open-air layout and
relatively loud music at II Fornaio do not
make for a quiet evening. But the general
hubbub of the place, no doubt com
pounded by the excitement of opening
night, provided a friendly, relaxed atmos
phere. "It's loud, but it works," my dining
companion observed.
II Fornaio is moderately priced (the
duck runs for $12.95, the pasta $8.95)
and they even park your car for you —
a nice touch in increasingly crowded
downtown Palo Alto.
