# Calderon: Salvadoran cuisine and more
## 
### Alex Hoye 
As we pulled into the lot in front of
El Calderon, our expectations plum
meted. For a moment we were afraid we
had the wrong restaurant. The building
boasts neon beer signs on an otherwise
bare storefront that resembles a dive
rather than a well-established restaurant.
When we entered, however, I knew for
certain that this was the place I had
heard about.
The wonderful Salvadoran manager,
Angela Lopez, is like everybody's
grandma. After seating us she spun story
after story and begged us to eat more.
She quizzed us in Spanish, but all I could
remember was agua. This word some
how flashed back to me as my mouth
was on fire with the spiciest nachos I
have eaten in the area. After this, Senora
Lopez filled me in on the nch past of
the little restaurant.
The restaurant is a family affair that
has pleased Stanford palates for 20 years.
Mama Angela told of the the days of
the first Stanford students to discover
her specialty, pupusas, about the time
of most of us were born. Evidently stu
dents were in the neighborhood teaching
wrestling and boxing when they were
irresistibly drawn to the little restaurant,
curious as to what pupusas were.
It was then that the Lopez family
cooking became a regular part of the
Stanford diet and Angela started her con
tinuing tradition of offering Stanford stu-

dents discounts. When ordering your
meal, just mention that you are a stu
dent, and she will be sure to adjust the
bill.
So now you may ask, "What the *@!!%
are pupusast" The American Indian word
papoose means a bag that you put things
— like babies — inside. From papoose
comes pupusas — two corn tortillas,
sandwiched together with cheese and
meat, that open up into a papoose that
you fill with curtido (pickled cabbage) ff
la moo shoo pork. The result is tasty
and addictive.
This Salvadoran special is only the
beginning, however. El Calderon offers a
full selection of Mexican and Salvadoran
delicacies. The polio encebollado —
tender, spicy chicken to us gringos —
was especially good. Also tasty was the
lengua en salsa y crema, a French beef
recipe that Senora Lopez tells me officials
from the French consulate in San Fran
cisco regularly come for.
In addition to the specialties, El Cal
deron offers a wide variety of combina

tion plates with your choice of tacos,
enchiladas (ask her about the enchilada
del no), tamales, burritos and other tradi
tional dishes.
Lopez is particularly proud of the un
usual beverages offered at her restaurant.
The tasty guanabana and tamarindo
drinks are made from tropical fruits
found in Central America. In addition,
she offers a truly international selection
of beers. The selection includes all of
your favorite Mexican beers along with
Salvadoran, Argentine, Guatemalan and
Peruvian brews — and Henry's, too. An
incomparable selection, to be sure.
This hideaway also offers Mexican
guitar players who romantically serenade
the tables on Friday and Saturday nights.
On Monday night, the TV is turned to
football — what a combo!
El Calderon hours are from 11 a.m.
to 1:45 p.m., and 5 to 8:45 p.m. Given
the tight hours, Mama Lopez also sells
all of the ingredients that you would
need to make your home version of her
specialties. And for those of you without
a kitchen, take heart — Mama sells food
to go.
So the next time you want to get away
from too-fast-Mexican-food, to brush up
on your Spanish, to eat a big meal at a
reasonable pnce or just to try something
new, there is a great little place in Moun
tain View that will do it all. El Calderon.

El Calderon is located at 699 Calderon
Ave., in Mountain View.
