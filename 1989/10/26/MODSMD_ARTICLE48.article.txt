# Swayze's dirty duty
## 
### Jason Moore Staff writer 
If nothing else, this review of
"Next of Kin" is about duty.
I am not talking about Patrick
Swayze's character's duty to his
family and his job as a cop. When
I say duty, I am talking about going
to see a movie like "Next of Kin"
after experiencing an earthquake
and being left homeless for the
past week.
Amazingly enough, the film
opens with some style and
restraint. A scene shift from Ap
palachia to Chicago's low-rent dis
trict establishes the similarities
and differences between the people
and their respective environments.
The film then travels to Chicago

cop Truman Gates — played by
Patrick Swayze — as he talks a
"hillbilly" into surrendering with
out the standard gun battle.
The basic plot kicks into gear
with the murder of Gates' younger
brother, Gerald, by a mobster. Cof
fin in tow, Gates and his wife,
jessie (Helen Hunt), return to the
hollows and ridges of Kentucky.
They are greeted by mountains
somberly colored in brown, black
and greys that match their mood
of mourning and revenge.
But Director John Irvin ends up
wasting this well-drawn Appalac
hian setting on a simplistic revenge
plot.
Even though "Next of Kin" is a

movie built on stereotypes of
Italians, hillbillys and, to a lesser
degree, blacks, it still manages to
make a few valuable observations.
Just before murdering Truman's
brother, the killer rattles off a series

of racial epithets supposedly de
scribing his experiences with other
minorities. He then finishes in
sulting Gerald by calling him a
"hillbilly," indicating the negative
stereotype associated with the
word.
Once the film returns to
Chicago, it trudges toward the in
evitable showdown between the
hillbillies and the mobsters. Along

the way, the audience is treated to
a stereotyped view of housing proj
ects and black soul clubs.
With a plethora of "Beverly
Hillbilly-isms," Michael Jenning's
script goes for trite dialogue instead
of capitalizing on the rich Appalac
hian dialect. The overall scenario
— director Irvin's interpretation of
it — is uninspired, and the acting
is not much better.
