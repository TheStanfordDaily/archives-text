# It's not over 'til the 'Fat Man' explodes

If you want more bang for your
movie-going dollar, you should
check out "Fat Man and Little
Boy." It has the most explosive
ending of any movie in theaters
today.
"Fat Man and Little Boy" is
the latest film from Roland Joff,
director of "The Killing Fields."
It documents the Manhattan
Project — the United States gov
ernment's $2 billion secret
project to build the world's first
atomic bomb — from the mili
tary's initiation of the project to
its explosive conclusion at the
Trinity test site in White Sands,
New Mexico.
The movie focuses on the proj
ect's military coordinator, Gen
eral Groves (Paul Newman), and
the problems he encounters in
trying to keep his collection of
the world's greatest scientists
working towards the production
of the ultimate weapon.
In a role noticeably different
from those he normally takes on,
Newman's performance as
Groves is a true tribute to the
man who built the Pentagon —
Groves was an engineer — and
then went on to create an indus
try that employed over 400,000
men in two years.
To lead the team of scientists,
Groves recruits J. Robert Oppen
heimer from the dredges of
Berkeley. In his motion picture
starring debut Dwight Schultz
brings his character to life.
From the beginning, politics
enters the picture. Oppen
heimer's political background (he
associated with "card-carrying"
communists in the '20s) comes
into question, but Groves deftly
uses this information to further
Oppenheimer's commitment to
the project.
"Fat Man and Little Boy" takes
us to an accurate replica of a
place that officially "did not exist"
until the war was over. During
this time, Los Alamos was
known merely as Box 1662,
Santa Fe, New Mexico. In this
box, the world's greatest
theoreticians worked on "the
gadget" for 19 months.

Unfortunately, the movie does
not make any firm political stand
about the project — except in
choosing to focus primarily on
Groves instead of on Oppen
heimer. However, it brings to
light much information about the
project that is probably not widely
known.
A crisis of conscience arises
among the scientists as the proj
ect's completion nears, but

Groves, with his Machiavellian
attitude, manages to keep them
together by offering lines of en
couragement such as, "We could
give this country the biggest stick
in the playground."
"Fat Man and Little Boy" also
brings to light the tremendous
effort, and cost, that went into
this project. Given triple A prio
rity from the President himself,
Groves was given a blank check

to pick up whoever or whatever
he wanted.
At the same time, Oppen
heimer's wife, Kitty (Bonnie
Bedelia), portrays the cost in
human terms.
Although it's difficult to imag
ine a world without nuclear
weapons, "Fat Man and Little
Boy" reminds us that they were
made by men and introduces us
to some of those men.
