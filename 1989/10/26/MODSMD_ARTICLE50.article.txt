# Rocking all the way to Babylon

When you see a new band's release at Tower, you
probably think, "Gee, 1 wonder what they sound
like." But, when you see their name is something
like The Pleasure Boyz and they do songs like "Seven
Guys — 70 inches," the answer becomes apparent,
"crap."
Well, if you see Babylon A.D.'s self-titled debut
release, this conclusion would be far from the truth.
In fact, the members of Babylon A.D. have nothing
to be embarrassed about after releasing this album.
Granted, they won't dethrone Van Halen any time
soon, but this five-man band from Fremont, Calif,
offers some back-to-basics, rock-n-roll that estab
lished pseudo-metal bands, like Bon lovi and Warrant,
have yet to learn how to play.

Leading the way is the dual power chord guitar
assault team of Ron Freschi and Danny Delarosa.
Freschi and Delarosa's guitar duets are as tight as
any the Scorpions or Whitesnake have to offer. The
power of their instruments is equalled by the vocals
of the band's front-man, Derek.
Derek's singing style is a rarity in the hard rock
world. Rather than merely screaming out the lyrics,
£ la Judas Priest's Rob Halford, Derek aims at deliver
ing powerful and understandable lyrics.
Another area in which this new band shows prom

ise is in their bassist, Robb Reid. Instead of merely
playing along with the drummer, Reid offers a thun
dering, yet at times, melodic bassline throughout the
album.
Of course, no real band would be complete without
a real drummer playing real drums. Filling this role,
more than adequately, is Jamey Pacheco. When a
song calls for heavy-handed percussions, Pacheco
delivers with a vengeance.
Babylon A.D.'s songs deal with some of the "not
so pretty" realities of life in a straightforward manner.
Babylon A.D. has adopted the attitude that although
not everyone approves of everything, if something is
making someone happy, it can't be all that bad.
Like Skid Row, they don't sing about puppy love
— as in loving Debbie Gibson. Instead, they present
some of the colder realities of life that they have
found to be true.
For Babylon A.D., romance need not be filled with
wine and roses. For example, in "Desperate," the
singer relates how two lonely people can fulfill each
others needs by a chance glance in a bar.
The tracks "Bang Go The Bells" and "Caught Up
In The Crossfire" both offer some good ol' fashion
kick ass sounds that are sure to rock you well into
the night. In the true metal tradition, the louder they
are played, the better they sound. (I recommend you
play them loud enough to drown out anyone banging
on your door trying to tell you to turn it down.)


These aren't Halloween costumes. This is Babylon A.D., and they dress like this for real. Check out
their new release. They named it after themselves.
