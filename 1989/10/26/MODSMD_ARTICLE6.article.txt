Stanford-in-Sacramento?
While Stanford students inter
ested in government have tradi
tionally turned toward Washing
ton, D C., Stanford in Government
directors are working with state
agencies to make Sacramento a
more attractive option.
Last week two SIG directors
met with representatives of 20
state agencies to establish annual
summer fellowships for Stanford
students.
With the cooperation of the
agencies, SIG has laid the foun
dation for a more permanent and
visible Stanford presence in Cali
fornia's capital.
In the past, students wanting
fellowships or internships with
state agencies had to make ar
rangements on an individual
basis, and there was no guarantee
Stanford students would receive
positions.
State agencies will now reserve
a set number of fellowships for
Stanford students every summer,
said Dean Chisiu, director of the
the 4-year-old SIG program in
Sacramento.
Preliminary responses from
state agencies indicate positions
for Stanford students may be set
aside in the Department of Health
Services, working on AIDS policy
and prenatal care policy; in the
Department of Housing and Com
munity Development, working on
housing policy issues; in the De
partment of Education, working

on issues of multiculturalism; in
the office of Assemblyman and
Stanford Law Prof. Byron Sher,
working with the natural re
sources committee; and possibly
in the governor's press office writ
ing speeches.
Chisiu and SIG Chairman Andy
Weis said an increased Stanford
presence in Sacramento is impor
tant because California sets policy
standards that other states and
the federal government follow,
particularly in environmental leg
islation.
They said they also wanted to
provide an equivalent alternative
to the SIG program in Washing
ton, DC.
According to Weis, these fellow
ships "will be a substantive, in
depth experience."
The fellowships will differ from
normal internships in that the fel
lows will be paid by their depart
ment and will also receive a
stipend from SIG, Weis said. In
this past, this stipend has been
$1,000; Weis said it may be in
creased to $1,500.
SIG should have firm commit
ments from the state agencies of
fering fellowships by mid-
December. Applications for these
positions will be available the first
week of Winter Quarter and will
be due three weeks later.
SIG has also compiled informa
tion about other internship op
portunities for students who are
not chosen as fellows or others
wanting experience working in
government without the intensity
of a fellowship.
