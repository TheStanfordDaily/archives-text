An Italian influence will soon hit the
Farm.
The Italian firm Finmeccanica estab
lished a $600,000 endowment this
month so Stanford can appoint its pro
fessors to a new chair either in engi
neering or economics.
The driving force behind this dona
tion is to "increase the exchange of ideas
and research activities between the
United States and the Italian academic
world," said Alberto Deßenedictus, the
firm's spokesperson. The firm will es
tablish chairs at Stanford, MIT and Car
negie Mellon University.
The chair will rotate between profes
sors every two to four years, depending
on which areas researchers are then
studying, according to Deßenedictus.
"The idea is to offer the chair to as
many younger professors as possible,"
he said.
Provost James Rosse will determine
whether the chair will go to the Engi
neering or Economics Department,
while department heads will select the

professor for the chair.
Finmeccanica, a holding company for
firms including Aeritalia, has diverse
research interests in fields such as aer
ospace engineering, power generation,
microelectronics and defense elec
tronics.
The firm "will be in touch with the
professor and bring him or her to Italy
every one to two years" to meet with
researchers from the firm's 15 to 20
labs, Deßenedictus said, adding that the
Stanford professor "can share his or
her ideas and findings, and the visit
will also make him aware of what is
going on in Italy."
In the past, the Faculty Senate has
expressed concern about a private com
pany with profit motives making deci
sions in an academic department. The
Finmeccanica chair, however, is not de
signed as a joint venture in which the
company has direct decision-making
power, but rather as an endowment for
a research focus. Such endowments al
ready exist at Stanford.
Stanford caught Finmeccanica's at
tention because the University excels in

both engineering and ecomomics,
Deßenedictus said. The firm is also "in
terested in California as an area where
very interesting research and develop
ment ... is going on," he said.
The firm has stronger investments
on the East Coast than in California,
according to Deßenedictus, because the
East Coast is historically a "more tradi
tional backdrop for European invest
ment in the United States."
Deßenedictus added that "it is impor
tant for us to have a reference point
within the Stanford faculty so that if
the opportunity arises, we can extend
our support for other professors and
research contracts."
At an Oct. 17 ceremony, University
President Donald Kennedy, Finmec
canica executives, the president of Car
negie Mellon, the chair of MIT and
Italy's ambassador to the United States
signed an agreement for the endowment.
Stanford will establish the chair "as
soon as all administrative procedures
are implemented, hopefully by the end
of this year," Deßenedictus said.
