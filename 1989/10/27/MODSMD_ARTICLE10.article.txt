### Brent Bigler Staff writer 
Members of the ASSU's Com
mittee on Democracy in Educa
tion put in their two cents' worth
about perceived problems with
federal financial aid in a press
conference yesterday.
CODE spokesperson Aimee
Gym, a freshman, said federal ed
ucation spending has decreased by
28 percent in the last eight years
and now represents 1.8 percent of
federal expenditures. CODE wants
to put pressure on federal and
state governments to reverse this
trend, she said.
Gym said education is "not a
privilege but a right" and ex
pressed the desire "to join hands
with students in California and
across the nation" to alert Amer
icans of higher education's impor
tance.
The press conference was held
in conjunction with a "Week of
Action" planned by the United
States Student Association, of
which the ASSU is a member.
Celina Martinez, a member of
MEChA, a Chicano/Latino stu
dent organization, said MEChA
"strongly supports the efforts of

CODE to investigate the problems
with financial aid."
MEChA will be assisting CODE
in their efforts throughout the
year, she added.
University financial aid officers
Cynthia Rife and Nan McKenna
were present to answer questions
about financial aid concerns.
Rife said the University has
"seen a shrinking commitment
from the federal government" in
total dollars.
She said the decrease has
"changed the way we've packaged
people."
The Financial Aids Office offers
students financial aid packages
that include funds from grants,
loans and work-study programs.
"Packaging" refers to the percent
ages of each type of aid a student
receives in her or his package.
Council of Presidents member
David Brown said the ASSU
"wants to work with [the Finan
cial Aids Office]" to make positive
changes to the University's aid
programs.
Student leaders from other Bay
Area colleges and universities also
participated in the press confer
ence.
