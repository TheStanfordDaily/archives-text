Cyclist injured in collision
A Stanford undergraduate riding his
bicycle sustained minor injuries yesterday
when he was struck by a car.
Reid Gregory, a sophomore and member
of the Stanford cycling team, was riding
east on Santa Theresa Street when he col
lided with a car that was apparently leaving
a parking space in front of Lagunita Court.
Gregory hit the windshield of the car,
crushing the glass on the passenger side
and cutting his face and left shoulder.
The driver of the car took Gregory to
Cowell Student Health Center, where he was
treated and released.

The inspectors are coming ...
The University will be inspecting all stu
dent housing for earthquake-related damage
over the next few weeks, according to
housing officials.
Inspectors will be examining rooms for
such flaws as cracked plaster and broken
windows, said Suzanne Tamiesie, manager
of Student Housing Operations. "We will be
fixing as much of that as possible," she said.
But students should not wait until their
rooms are inspected if there is damage,
Tamiesie added. Instead, they should notify
their local facilities office by filling out a
work order form.
"I wouldn't want people not to get the

service they need because they think they
should wait for an inspector," Tamiesie said.
"Those things we want to know about be
cause we want to fix them right away."
Inspectors should have little trouble dis
tinguishing between student-caused and
quake-caused damage, Tamiesie said.
But in most cases, students will receive
the benefit of the doubt, said Lucy Williams,
manager of Row and Cluster Facilities.
"I just don't believe in getting hung up
on damage reports," she said.

Emergency funds available
The University has emergency funds for
students in need of financial aid following
the earthquake. "This aid will be delivered
with minimal delay and red tape," according
to Director of Financial Aids Robert Huff.
Any registered student is eligible. Under
graduates already on aid will be considered
for grants or short-term loans, while stu
dents not currently receiving aid will be el
igible for short-term loans only.
The short-term loans are for 90 days at
no interest.
Aid is available for various needs, includ
ing changes in housing costs and replacement
of some lost personal items. Students may
apply for aid in Old Union 315. Graduate
students not sufficiently aided by a short
term loan should go to Building 590, room
209 to apply for an emergency grant.

Black center plans gathering
The Black Community Services Center will
sponsor an informal gathering for under
graduates Nov. 2.
Originally, the meeting was intended to
be a retreat for black student organization
leaders, said Keith Archuleta, director of
the community center. But since many stu
dents are dealing with last week's earth
quake and next week's midterms, the meet
ing will focus on support services instead,
he said.
The meeting, which will be held in the
large lounge at Ujamaa House, should "let
students know they are loved and supported
at Stanford," Archuleta said.
Staff from the Undergraduate Advising
Center and from Counseling and Psycholog
ical Services are among those invited to at
tend, he added.
While the emphasis has shifted away from
leadership to counseling, the meeting will
still provide a forum to discuss concerns in
the black community, Archuleta said.
Several possible topics include the future
of African and Afro-American studies and
implementation of the report of the Univer
sity Committee on Minority Issues.
"Given the challenges facing the black
community, we need leadership of all kinds,"
Archuleta said.

nity center at 723-1587.
