# Soldier links death squads to U.S.

WASHINGTON (AP) â€” A Saivadoran
soldier who acknowledges taking part
in eight death squad murders said
Thursday that his orders came from
the Saivadoran high command and that
American advisers "had to know what
was going on."
"My job was to kill or be killed," said
Cesar Vielman Joya Martinez, 28, who
told of being a member of a special
forces group of the Ist Infantry Brigade
called GC-2 in the capital of San Sal
vador until he fled the country in July.
He said his job from April until July
of this year was to capture and kill
suspected leftist guerrillas.
The Saivadoran military has denied
Joya Martinez' allegations, which sur
faced in the Central American nation
two weeks ago.
The Pentagon, in a statement issued
Thursday, called claims of U.S. com

plicity in death squad activity "patently
absurd."
"We know of no instances in which
U.S. military personnel have been even
remotely associated with such morally
repugnant activities," the statement
said.
Jeff Brown, a source at the U.S. Em
bassy in El Salvador, said Ambassador
William Walker "considers the charges
very serious" and "if they are truthful,
they must be investigated."
Joya Martinez outlined his allegations
for U.S. reporters in a series of inter
views at a Washington hotel. Speaking
in Spanish, he said his orders came in
one-page reports issued by the Saiva
doran Joint Chiefs of Staff. The reports,
he said, went to the commanders of the
brigade, Cols. Juan Orlando Zepeda and
Franciso Elena Fuentes. He said he took
part in eight killings but the reports he

saw indicated 72 people were killed from
April to July.
"The report did not say kill them, it
said 'bring them to justice,' which in
simple terms means to kill them. My
work was only to execute these people,"
said Joya Martinez.
He said two American advisers were
assigned to the unit to analyze intelli
gence data and pay for supplies ranging
from weapons to gasoline.
"They had control of the department,"
Joya Martinez said. He said he did not
know exactly what knowledge the Amer
icans had, but said, "Obviously they
had to know what was going on."
Joya Martinez said he made the al
legations public in an attempt to stop
the killings. Col. Elena Fuentes said in
El Salvador two weeks ago that Joya
Martinez is a defector wanted for the
murder of two civilians.
