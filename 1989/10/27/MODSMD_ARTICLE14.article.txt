BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) â€”
President Carlos Menem said Thursday
he will not give in to wage demands by
unions, despite widespread strikes and
growing opposition to his 4-month-old
government.
"Let them protest," Menem said of
the strikes, which have involved teach
ers, subway workers, metal workers,
court staff and employees at public min
istries. "Nobody is restraining their con
stitutional right and freedom to express
their thought and sentiments."
Menem made his statement to jour
nalists after attending a celebration
honoring the federal police.
The government has offered public
employees an across-the-board raise of
12,000 australs, or about $16 a month,

through March 1990. It told businesses
their wage increases above 15 percent
for that period may not be added to
prices.
Higher salary increases would fuel
inflation, which has been reduced
through devaluation and wage and price
guidelines to about 7 percent this
month. In July, it was 197 percent.
The 350,000-member metalworkers
union has demanded an 82 percent pay
raise, which it claims is necessary to
make up for cuts in real wages during
recent months.
Postal workers are seeking a 100 per
cent pay raise, and bus drivers, subway
employees, teachers, airline personnel
and others have demanded increases of
up to 110 percent.

On Wednesday, unions representing
employees at public ministries listened
for five minutes to Labor Ministry un
dersecretary Roberto Digon, then
stormed out of the collective bargaining
session.
"We listened as the 12,000 austral
payment was made official, but walked
out because the offer cannot be modified
and leaves no room for a coun
terproposal," said Andres Rodriguez, a
delegate of the National Civil Personnel
Union.
The increase would bring monthly
wages for most members of his union
to about $78, Rodriguez said.
The wage issue is a key test of the
government's commitment to quell in
flation, which has ranged between 100
percent and 1,000 percent for years. The
