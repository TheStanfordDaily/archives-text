# German leader meets opposition

### 
BERLIN (AP) â€” A Politburo
member met with pro-democracy
leaders Thursday, a first for the
orthodox Communists who run
East Germany, and authorities
urged reform activists to stop
voicing their demands in street
protests.
About 100,000 people in Dres
den ignored the appeal and atten
ded a rally Thursday night at
which speakers demanded rapid
reform, Lutheran Church sources
said.
ADN, the official news agency,
said thousands showed up earlier
in the day for a meeting on reform
sponsored by Communist Party
officials in the southern industrial
city.
It said 15,000 people conducted
a candlelight march through
downtown Erfurt, in the south
west, and that 25,000 people
marched through Rostock on the
Baltic coast.
The news agency said 5,000
demonstrated in Gera, west of
Dresden, shouting "Democracy,
Now or Never!" and "We are the
People!"
Premier Willi Stoph announced
that more high-quality consumer
goods would be imported. Al
though East Germany's economy
is the envy of Soviet bloc neigh
bors, such goods often can be

found only in hard-currency
shops.
Egon Krenz, the nation's new
leader, spoke by telephone for 20
minutes with Chancellor Helmut
Kohl of West Germany, the haven
for tens of thousands of East Ger
mans who fled in search of free
dom. It was their first contact
since Krenz replaced Erich
Honecker as party chief last week.
A statement from the national
lawyers' union called for multiple
candidate elections and public
control of vote counting, ADN re
ported.
The two-hour meeting between
Guenter Schabowski and two
leaders of New Forum, largest of
the new pro-democracy organiza
tions, was the first of a member
of the ruling party Politburo with
the opposition.
New Forum is officially banned,
although tolerated, and the party
had said it would not talk to op
position groups.
Schabowski, also the East Ber
lin party chief, met with Jens
Reich, a molecular biologist at the
Academy of Sciences, and
physicist Sebastian Pflugbeil,
both founding members of New
Forum.
Reich told reporters after the
meeting, held in the Communist
Party Central Committee build

ing, that the "talks were open and
constructive."
"We presented New Forum's
concepts and ideas," he said.
Asked why Schabowski invited
them, Reich said: "He told us he
wanted to begin a new political
course and wanted to learn about
the whole political spectrum
here."
He said Schabowski assured
him the government's new inter
est in dialogue as a way of solving
the nation's problems "was a real
change and not a tactical move."
When asked if he believed that,
the scientist replied: "We will see.
I can say cautiously that I have
a positive impression."
Official recognition of New
Forum was discussed, Reich said,
but Schabowski told him it was
"beyond his capacity." The organ
ization was banned last month.
ADN reported that Reich and
Pflugbeil, described as "members
of an initiative group that calls
itself New Forum," had met with
Schabowski.
New Forum, which advocates
democratic chance within tho
communist system, claims more
than 15,000 members.
Krenz hinted Wednesday the op
position might be included in dis
cussion of reform.
