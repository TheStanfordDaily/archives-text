Parly time in Costa Rica
SAN JOSE, Costa Rica (AP) — Costa Ricans
are throwing a fiesta for hemispheric leaders to
celebrate their century-old democracy, but Pres
ident Bush is arriving with a diplomatic dance
card that leaves no room for Nicaragua's Daniel
Ortega.
The president of Nicaragua made clear his
eagerness to confer with the U.S. president when
19 hemispheric leaders gather Friday for a two
day "summit of the Americas." Bush, under heavy
pressure from domestic conservatives, is spurning
Ortega's advances.
Reparation payments set for 1990
WASHINGTON (AP) — The House voted
Thursday to begin making $1.2 billion in repara
tion payments next year to Japanese-Americans
who were confined to camps during World War
11, a debt that supporters said is long overdue.
Lawmakers agreed 249-166 to provide the
money, rejecting conservatives' arguments that
while the compensation is justified, the payments
would steal money from other government
priorities.
"Do you elevate these payments above child
care?" asked Rep. Harold Rogers, R-Ky. "The
defense of the country?"
The 60,000 surviving internees would each
receive $20,000 checks under a 1988 law. The
legislation approved Thursday provides $500 mil
lion for the payments in the fiscal year beginning

October 1990, the same amount the following
year and the remaining $200 million beginning
October 1992.
Ted's words of wisdom
ATLANTA (AP) — Cable TV mogul Ted Turner
proclaimed himself "news king" Thursday,
declared the Ten Commandments obsolete and
said he'd pay cold, hard cash for a happy way
to end the world.
Turner — chairman of the Turner Broadcast
ing System, which includes WTBS, creator of
Cable News Network and owner of two Atlanta
sports teams — told members of the National
Newspaper Association that the biblical Ten Com
mandments do not relate to current global prob
lems, such as overpopulation and the arms race.
"We're living with outmoded rules," Turner
said.
Terrorist bill approved
WASHINGTON (AP) — The Senate on Thurs
day approved capital punishment for the murder
of Americans overseas in acts of terrorism, brush
ing aside a move to change the maximum penalty
under the bill to life in prison.
Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., sponsor of the bill,
said it offered the only suitable reply to "the
kinds of offenses that are an affront to humanity."
The bill won approval 79-20 and now goes to
the House.
