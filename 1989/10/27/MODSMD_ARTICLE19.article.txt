Displaced students
should get an extra year
of guaranteed housing

AFTER MORE than a week
of living in dormitory
lounges and friends' rooms,
most of the University's displaced
students should be moving into
their new housing today and to
morrow.
The last 10 days have probably
seemed an eternity to students who
spent those days wondering when
they could reclaim their belong
ings, where they would live, what
the future would hold. In this
sense, the campus can breathe a
sigh of relief that, by the end of
the weekend, most students will
again have permanent roofs over
their heads.
But the conditions are far from
ideal. To provide the displaced stu
dents with the most comfortable
living arrangements and ensure
that all dormitories are equally af
fected, the University is spreading
the students across campus, from
Manzanita Park to Governor's Cor
ner.
The fragmentation of the Row
community and communities
within individual houses comes
just as those groups are attempting
to build and just when students
need the support of those around
them most.
The situation is also emotionally
demanding of students who are
finding that their coveted singles
— or triples — will soon house an
additional person.
Those involved have bandied
about various ideas for "compen
sating" students who have been af
fected by the quake displacement.
But the best procedure is the one

adopted by the University in
dealing with students who were
evacuated from Roble Hall in De
cember 1987.
The primary form of "compensa
tion" for the Row refugees, as with
the Roble Hall refugees, should be
the grant of an additional year of
guaranteed housing.
The guarantee of 217 extra
spaces in future years may be risky
for the Draw.
But University officials said this
week that 253 spaces were avail
able in converted rooms across
campus for the 217 displaced stu
dents. Clearly, the University can
come up with additional housing
when pressed — and adding a year
of guaranteed housing is the least
it could do for those displaced.
The second form of compensa
tion, already agreed to by housing
officials, is offering displaced stu
dents return priority for the three
houses that may reopen next quar
ter.
Monetary compensation is a
more difficult proposition. Though
displaced students remaining on
campus may be charged for the
time they were living in lounges,
the University had legitimate costs
during that period — and it faces
a $160 million bill for cleanup ef
forts. Haggling over who deserves
how much for last week can only
waste more time and hinder the
healing process.
Finally, the results of last week's
earthquake send a clear message
that the University's decision to
exclude Row houses from its 1985
earthquake safety study is a mis
take not to be repeated. The ar
gument given, that the houses were
assumed to be stable because they
were constructed of wood, hardly
stands up itself.
Ignoring an area of campus
where hundreds of students live —
whatever the technical assump
tions — is simply unacceptable.
