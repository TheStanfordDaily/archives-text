Earthquake brings temporary end to Rodin debate

I AM disappointed by the decaying
quality of The Daily's coverage of
the discussion of the proposed
temporary parking lot between the
Anatomy building and the Rodin sculp
ture garden.
The Daily got off to a good start:
The front-page article of Oct. 4 was
thorough and well-balanced, covering
the range of community opinions. As
that article noted, Art Prof. Albert
Elsen maintains that construction of
the parking lot would threaten the
well-being of the sculptures.
Over the last several months, the
effects of automobile exhaust on
bronze sculptures has been an issue of

some debate, with Elsen maintaining
that the issue should be studied fur
ther, while members of the Department
of Chemistry have presented evidence
indicating that auto exhaust does not
represent a threat to bronze.
This issue was to be discussed at the
meeting of the Committee on Parking
and Transportation, which would have
been held Oct. 20.
I regret that the editorial board has
attempted to pre-empt this discussion,
presenting an opinion without hearing
the evidence. The editorial of Oct. 12
entitled "Think about fumes" was
somewhat careless; the cartoon of Oct.
24 entitled "Rodin Sculpture Garden:

Due to the damage to the
Art Museum, plans to
develop either a
landscaped temporary
parking lot or a
landscaped courtyard
have been postponed in
definitely.

1989/1999" was simply irresponsible.
While there is a long-standing prece
dent in American journalism for using

exaggerated imagery to promote
opinions without a demonstrated fac
tual basis, it's hardly an admirable
tactic.
I hope The Daily will take a more
thoughtful and careful approach in
future discussions of such controversial
issues.
Ironically, the earthquake has made
this a moot discussion. Due to the
damage to the Art Museum, plans to
develop either a landscaped temporary
parking lot or a landscaped courtyard
have been postponed indefinitely.
