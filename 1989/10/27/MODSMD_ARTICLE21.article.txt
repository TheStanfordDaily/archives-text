# Aborted fetuses have no voice for choice
## 
### 
I found it quite interesting that The
Daily's editorial on Oct. 20, "A voice
for choice," ignored the one party most
affected by any abortion legislation —
the preborn child.
Yet this is typical of abortion advo
cates' propaganda — to divert attention
from the sad and horrid fact that with
each abortion, at least one little girl or
little boy is torn apart limb by limb,
cut into pieces and sucked from its
mother's womb, left to rot in the gar
bage cans and trash disposals of abor
tion mills across the country.
Do not sanitize the dirty, barbaric
crime of child-killing with euphemisms
such as "choice."
Your rhetoric is full of compassion.
But the substance of your message is
death.
Abortion is 100 percent fatal for the
preborn child and lethal to the heart,
mind and spirit of the child's mother

and father.
You titled your editorial "A voice for
choice." Tell me, does the baby have a
choice?
What of the voices, what of the cries
of the already slaughtered millions of
legally aborted children? What of the

silent pleas and futile last struggles of
the preborn child pulling away from
the deadly, slicing curette of an abor
tionist at this very moment?
What of desperate wails of the griev
ing mothers and fathers of these lost
innocents?
It is very easy for The Daily's edito
rial board to advocate abortion — you
have already been born.
