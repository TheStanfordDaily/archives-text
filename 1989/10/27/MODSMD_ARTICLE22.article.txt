# Volunteers at game raised relief money
## 
### 
We would like to thank the 125
people who spent time this weekend
directing traffic and picking up trash
after the football games.
Students, staff and Palo Alto resi
dents volunteered to raise money for
earthquake relief efforts. An incredible
amount of work was accomplished de
spite the small number of participants

and the less than glamorous activity.
Though it was a dirty job, many
students asked if they could come back
again to raise more dollars. Thank you
again for your work and dedication.
