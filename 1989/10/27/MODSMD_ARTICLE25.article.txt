## Rose hustled but didn't care 
### 
WHEN I WAS 10 years old, we
played baseball on a lousy old
field. It didn't even have a third
base, but that didn't really matter.
I wanted to play third base anyway,
because Pete Rose played third base, and
Pete Rose did everything a 10-year-old
boy wanted to do: He played baseball and
he got dirty and he didn't get in trouble
for it.
I was the only kid in our class who
tried to slide head-first into second base,
because Pete did it that way. Other kids
idolized Reggie Jackson's home run abil
ity.
I was thrilled when Pete slid head-first
into second, covered his uniform in dirt,
lost his hat and called time. There was
absolutely nothing more exciting for this
10-year-old boy.
He was Charlie Hustle before that ex
pression became a clich6; it only became
a cliche after Pete institutionalized the
attitude.
Every athlete wants to be known as
someone who hustles, but Pete made it
fashionable. He almost made it a com
pliment when someone said, "He does
the best with what he has. And at least
he hustles."
I was a Pete Rose fan at the perfect
time. He got his 3,000 th hit in the sum
mer of 1978; in 1980, he won the World
Series with the Phillies.
In that Series, he made one of the
greatest plays I've ever seen, racing over
from first base to catch a dropped foul
pop fly with one out in the ninth, helping
to clinch the title for the Phillies. No
one else would have made that play, and
that's why he was my hero.

When he finally broke Ty Cobb's all
time hit record, I felt vindicated. My
brother and father had never had much
to say about Pete, except that he was a
hot dog and various other insights about
his intelligence.
But after he broke the record, it didn't
matter what they said; he had achieved
the single most important record in his
sport. That could not be belittled.
Of course, during those years, I had
heard more and more about Pete Rose's
character off the field: He was an inat
tentive father, a careless husband.
None of that really mattered to me,
though, because I admired his baseball
ability. I never claimed he was Gandhi
or a potential Nobel Prize winner. I just
loved the way he played baseball.
When baseball finally suspended Pete
Rose for life this summer for betting on
games involving his own team, no one
was really surprised. Most people were
just glad the whole sorry episode was
over.
It seemed inevitable, and Pete seemed
desperate. At the press conference in
which he responded to the suspension,
Pete claimed the penalty was fair, but
then held that he had never bet on base
ball.
Everyone caught the discrepancy, and
a reporter finally asked him why the
penalty was fair if he had never bet on
his own team.
Pete listened to the question and stayed
silent. All I could think was, "Answer
the damn question, Pete. Answer the
question." I still can't figure out how he
could have answered that question,
though it was fair and honest.

But he couldn't just let it sit there in
the air, getting more ominous with each
second. He had to say something, any
thing. But he just stood there, looking
confused.
I don't pretend this is some great
tragedy or some allegory about the hy
pocrisy of American culture; baseball just
does not hold such importance "in the
scheme of things," as my father might
say. It's just a damned shame.
I have also learned to "trust the art,
not ttie artist," and I suppose the same
can be said of athletes. But Pete betrayed
the art.
The night of his suspension, he pitched
some of his baseball memorabilia over a
cable shopping network. It saddened me
when I saw him there, holding some bat
he used for some record ("It slices! It
dices! All for the low, low price of
$75.00!"), looking for some sucker to buy
it.
I thought it was pathetic, trivial com
pared to his own achievements as well
as to what had happened earlier that day.
And I had to think he didn't care as
much about baseball or his fans as they
had once cared about him.
