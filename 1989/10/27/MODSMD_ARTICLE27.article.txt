## Films about black life are not obligated to address drug issue 
### 
I APPRECIATE the honesty with
which Erik Johnson expressed his
reservations about seeing Spike
Lee's most recent film, "Do The Right
Thing," in his Oct. 20 column, "'Right
Thing' hits home."
Given the "conservative" positions
Johnson has asserted in his previous
columns, I was surprised — and happy
— to agree with his final assessment
of the film and its importance: "People
of all races and cultures need to con
sider the questions Lee raises ..."
I was not surprised — or happy —
however, when Johnson repudiated the
film's realism because "the fear and
loathing of the drug trade were absent
from this film about urban black life
in America."
I think he has carefully worded his
opinion that inner-city black life can
not possibly be depicted realistically if
it ignores the question of drugs.
I've heard this argument against the
film many times myself, and so had
Lee. At a press conference after the

film's screening at the Cannes Film
Festival, Lee responded to critics by
pointing out that the drug problem
pervades every level of American soci
ety. Why doesn't anyone ask why
drugs are absent from "Working Girl"
or "Rain Man"?
The reason is that these movies are
not about drugs. And neither is "Do
The Right Thing".
It is a film about racial tensions. It
is a film about police brutality. It says
a lot, but not everything, about con
temporary black urban life. To expect
Lee to address drugs in his work is
unfair and discriminatory.
Drugs are a problem all over this
nation. It is not exclusive to the black
community, and Lee is no more re
sponsible to include drugs in his films
than any other director.
It bothers me that Johnson felt the
absense of drugs made "Do The Right
Thing" something other than true-to
life. I am also disturbed by Johnson's
admission of being "in no mood for a

Why doesn't anyone ask why drugs are absent from
"Working Girl" or "Rain Man"? The reason is that
these movies are not about drugs. And neither is "Do
The Right Thing". It is a film about racial tensions. It
is a film about police brutality. It says a lot, but not
everything, about contemporary black urban life.

tirade about the inherent evilness of
whites, and . . . not [wanting] to see
blacks portrayed as holier-than-thou
victims," as if a film extolling these
points of view could ever be financed
and/or widely distributed in America
today.
Black people do not lack reasons to
feel bitterness toward whites. But we
are capable of exploring these feelings,
and putting them up for discussion, so
that we can all work toward mutual
understanding.

Hopefully, "Do The Right Thing" has
dispelled Johnson's fears of gross
exaggeration and manipulation on the
part of black filmmakers. Perhaps now
he can understand the frustration
black moviegoers feel when the skewed,
stereotypical images that are presented
by white Hollywood over and over
again.
This is why "Do The Right Thing"
is such an important film. It is truth
ful. When I walked out of the theatre
after seeing it this summer, I was
numb.

The anger and frustration that it
stirred up in me was tempered by a
sense of satisfaction and renewed
admiration for a black filmmaker who
put forth what I feel is the most
realistic portrayal of urban black life
on film to date.
I hope that the quality of "Do The
Right Thing" helps Johnson, and
others who resist dealing with racial
issues, to get over their apprehension
of looking at American society from
intelligent, critical black perspectives.
But more than that, I hope that Lee,
and the slowly growing number of
black filmmakers, continue to produce
realistic images of us in the future.
Maybe then people like Johnson can
learn about the many facets of our
community, rather than just the nega
tive images that the mainstream media
has obviously made them come to
expect.
