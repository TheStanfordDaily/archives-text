## Stanford's dance club offers fancy footwork and fun 
### Theresa Urist 
Imagine stiff-collared dancers
twirling disgruntled partners with
stepped-on feet, a music box with
a swirling, poised duo, black and
white (colorized?) films of Fred
and Ginger circling the dance
floor or perhaps a sweaty scene
from "Dirty Dancing."
Such classic stereotypes conven
tionalize ballroom dancing as a
pasttime on par with "Leave it to
Beaver" or parlor games. But a
peek into the Old Union Club
house Ballroom on a Sunday af
ternoon sheds new light on the
topic, for there electrical en
gineers, psychologists and commu
nication majors combine in a mass
circumnavigation of the dance
floor. Thrill-seekers delight in
charting new steps, leading fair
damsels across the floor and cir
cling the terrain.
Who sponsors, organizes and
undertakes such a project? Why,
the mighty Stanford Ballroom
Dance Club does. A casually
telecommunicated conversation

with the co-founder of the cotil
lion convention, electrical engi
neering graduate student Inder
Singh, reveals a history of the
club, laced with personal insight.
Singh began teaching a dance
class for credit on the Farm
"about three to four years ago"
with dance instructor Lisa Arkin.
In a cultured accent Singh
reminisces, "To be a foreign stu
dent from India teaching 'Begin
ning American Social Dance' was
a source of endless delight for me.
It was somewhat of an irony."
Upon arriving at Stanford from
India, this enthusiast observed a
social scene with "no partner
dancing activity," and to his dis
may discovered "more beer
sloshed on the floor than danc
ing."
So, in an effort to unearth some
"good, clean fun," the seed was
planted for the idea of a dance
club. Previously, ballroom dancing
clubs at Stanford had quickly
come and gone, based on whims
and caprices. Unfortunately, no
effort had ever proved enduring.

'More and more people are discovering
that it's more fun to hold a partner than
disco dancing.'
— Robin Ruebello

"A stable and unique mix of
programming," according to
Singh, enables the current club
not only to survive but to thrive.
A meeting of the minds with
Arkin, who is a Stanford faculty
member, started the "ball" roll
ing. However, Singh stresses, "the
class format is only the begin
ning." It is also necessary to
"transfer learning to a social set
ting" — hence, "a need for the
club is obvious."
Allen Boronkay, a charter mem
ber of the club, enlightens the
curious with his recollections of
the group's bumpy start. "When
we first (got) started, we had ap
proximately 20 fluctuating mem
bers. Every week was different."
Long workshops were held in
an effort to teach several different
dances in one cohesive day. In
this trial and error fashion,
Boronkay quickly learned that the
"workshop was a cumbersome set
up." What to do? He and the other
partner dancers came to the con
clusion that it is . much better
to stick with learning two dances
over several weeks."
Thus the formula which
governs the current club was ar
rived at. Every quarter there are
three di fie rent classes which meet
once a week for six weeks, and
in each class two dances are
taught. This quarter the advanced
track offers instruction in East
and West Coast Swing, taught
each Sunday at 3 p.m. This is
followed by Beginning Waltz and
Foxtrot at 4 p.m. and Beginning
East Coast Swing and Two-Step
is at 5 p.m. To complete the day,
an action social hour is scheduled
every Sunday at 6 p.m.
During this final hour all levels
and classes meet to practice new
steps, socialize and apologize to
stamped-on partners and collided
into couples.
With such a format, the club
has arrived at its second stage.
Co-founder Singh relates that "we
have undergone two major
generations of leadership since
(the club's) original establish
ment. There are a number of key
organizers who have passed down
duties in a process of succession.
We are regenerative in terms of
leadership ..." The final prod
uct of the devised format, he says,

in conjunction with dedicated di
rection, should result in a self
sustaining organization.
Ah, but once underway, yet an
other obstacle was encountered:
We've got to fight!!!
For our right!!!
To Paaart . . . ner dance!!!
Rumors circulated last year
that their mecca of good, clean
fun — the Old Union Clubhouse
Ballroom — was going to be con
verted into office space for student
groups. The troops were
mobilized, and pens were wielded.
A petition to the administration,
coupled with Student Organiza
tion Services' support, ended in a
decision to delay the conversion.
Singh voices a passionate plea
on the topic of ballroom dance
space in relation to his venture,
". . . it [the dance clubl can be
destroyed overnight, if they yank
that space away." His solution:
"under no circumstances should
precious prime space be com
promised ... it must be preserved
until equivalent space is available
with similar access."
Luckily, not all problems have
been so touchy — witness a sub
ject that has been successfully ad
dressed and resolved, apparently
to the satisfaction of all. In the
club's debut, it seems, instructor
consistency was non-existent.
Visiting dancers offered scattered
lessons, and the long workshops
ended in confusion. The club
found the answer to this perplex
ing problem close at hand.:
Who quicksteps faster than a
speeding bullet, is more energetic
than Richard Simmons on a caf
feine fix and can lead tall partners
with a single grip? Why, none
other than 13-year inveterate
dance teacher Robin Ruebello her
self. Described by Boronkay as
"power density," this small
wonder has instructed classes of
over 100 people at a YMCA in
Los Altos. Before she was drafted
by the SBDC in 1987, she taught
some of the seminars for the club
and notes there's "a trend that
interest (in ballroom dance) has
been growing ... it has jumped
in the last nine to 12 months."
Thus, enthusiasm, motivation
and overall zest for ballroom
dancing is on the upswing. Help
ing to organize the Viennese Ball

and occasional pilgrimages to ac
tual dance halls is an additional
lure of learning proper partner
dance. To the dismay of many,
however, classes for beginners are
limited to 30 couples, while ad
vanced classes can only accomo
date 8 couples. The autumnal
bumper crop of registrants yielded
a teeming cornucopia of Fred and
Ginger wanna-bes. The result is
a waiting list as long as the class
list. The teacher's reaction: "I was
not overwhelmed; I feel more
gratification and overjoyment. It's
so neat to see so many people into
ballroom dancing!"
The incredible increase is ini
tially inexplicable. A peek into
Sunday night's beginning classes
and it's easy to observe more col
lisions than a demolition derby,
followed by some rather unortho
dox dance jargon: "@#s*! — two
— three, one — two — !(a #*!!"
But contrary to previous descrip
tion, and overlooking the bumping
elbows, stepped-on toes and

wrong leads, the dancers are
eager, happy and hungry for
steps. The smiles of class mem
bers can account for the stampede
during attendence sign-ups. In
Ruebello's view, "more and more
people are discovering that it's
more fun to hold a partner than
disco dancing." A look into the
advanced class reveals difficult
turns, fancy footwork and varia
tions unseen in the first-level
class.
So, after all the hoopla, what
makes one follow the "bouncing
ball"? Senior Angela Wood, now
in her fourth year of ballroom
dancing, admits of her addiction,
"some of us get hooked."
"It's fun. It's social. It's exer
cise," is the simple three-pronged
answer offered by charter member
Boronkay.
Singh enthusiastically encaps

zealously exclaims, "It sends
goooze-bumps!"

The advanced ballroom dance class offers fancy footwork for future
Fred-and-Ginger pairs.


Chris Eisenberg — Daily
Stanford students spend a recent Sunday afternoon learning new
dance steps.
Imagine stiff-collared dancers
twirling disgruntled partners with
stepped-on feet, a music box with
a swirling, poised duo, black and
white (colorized?) films of Fred
and Ginger circling the dance
floor or perhaps a sweaty scene
from "Dirty Dancing."
Such classic stereotypes conven
tionalize ballroom dancing as a
pasttime on par with "Leave it to
Beaver" or parlor games. But a
peek into the Old Union Club
house Ballroom on a Sunday af
ternoon sheds new light on the
topic, for there electrical en
gineers, psychologists and commu
nication majors combine in a mass
circumnavigation of the dance
floor. Thrill-seekers delight in
charting new steps, leading fair
damsels across the floor and cir
cling the terrain.
Who sponsors, organizes and
undertakes such a project? Why,
the mighty Stanford Ballroom
Dance Club does. A casually
telecommunicated conversation

with the co-founder of the cotil
lion convention, electrical engi
neering graduate student Inder
Singh, reveals a history of the
club, laced with personal insight.
Singh began teaching a dance
class for credit on the Farm
"about three to four years ago"
with dance instructor Lisa Arkin.
In a cultured accent Singh
reminisces, "To be a foreign stu
dent from India teaching 'Begin
ning American Social Dance' was
a source of endless delight for me.
It was somewhat of an irony."
Upon arriving at Stanford from
India, this enthusiast observed a
social scene with "no partner
dancing activity," and to his dis
may discovered "more beer
sloshed on the floor than danc
ing."
So, in an effort to unearth some
"good, clean fun," the seed was
planted for the idea of a dance
club. Previously, ballroom dancing
clubs at Stanford had quickly
come and gone, based on whims
and caprices. Unfortunately, no
effort had ever proved enduring.

'More and more people are discovering
that it's more fun to hold a partner than
disco dancing.'
— Robin Ruebello

"A stable and unique mix of
programming," according to
Singh, enables the current club
not only to survive but to thrive.
A meeting of the minds with
Arkin, who is a Stanford faculty
member, started the "ball" roll
ing. However, Singh stresses, "the
class format is only the begin
ning." It is also necessary to
"transfer learning to a social set
ting" — hence, "a need for the
club is obvious."
Allen Boronkay, a charter mem
ber of the club, enlightens the
curious with his recollections of
the group's bumpy start. "When
we first (got) started, we had ap
proximately 20 fluctuating mem
bers. Every week was different."
Long workshops were held in
an effort to teach several different
dances in one cohesive day. In
this trial and error fashion,
Boronkay quickly learned that the
"workshop was a cumbersome set
up." What to do? He and the other
partner dancers came to the con
clusion that it is . much better
to stick with learning two dances
over several weeks."
Thus the formula which
governs the current club was ar
rived at. Every quarter there are
three di fie rent classes which meet
once a week for six weeks, and
in each class two dances are
taught. This quarter the advanced
track offers instruction in East
and West Coast Swing, taught
each Sunday at 3 p.m. This is
followed by Beginning Waltz and
Foxtrot at 4 p.m. and Beginning
East Coast Swing and Two-Step
is at 5 p.m. To complete the day,
an action social hour is scheduled
every Sunday at 6 p.m.
During this final hour all levels
and classes meet to practice new
steps, socialize and apologize to
stamped-on partners and collided
into couples.
With such a format, the club
has arrived at its second stage.
Co-founder Singh relates that "we
have undergone two major
generations of leadership since
(the club's) original establish
ment. There are a number of key
organizers who have passed down
duties in a process of succession.
We are regenerative in terms of
leadership ..." The final prod
uct of the devised format, he says,

in conjunction with dedicated di
rection, should result in a self
sustaining organization.
Ah, but once underway, yet an
other obstacle was encountered:
We've got to fight!!!
For our right!!!
To Paaart . . . ner dance!!!
Rumors circulated last year
that their mecca of good, clean
fun — the Old Union Clubhouse
Ballroom — was going to be con
verted into office space for student
groups. The troops were
mobilized, and pens were wielded.
A petition to the administration,
coupled with Student Organiza
tion Services' support, ended in a
decision to delay the conversion.
Singh voices a passionate plea
on the topic of ballroom dance
space in relation to his venture,
". . . it [the dance clubl can be
destroyed overnight, if they yank
that space away." His solution:
"under no circumstances should
precious prime space be com
promised ... it must be preserved
until equivalent space is available
with similar access."
Luckily, not all problems have
been so touchy — witness a sub
ject that has been successfully ad
dressed and resolved, apparently
to the satisfaction of all. In the
club's debut, it seems, instructor
consistency was non-existent.
Visiting dancers offered scattered
lessons, and the long workshops
ended in confusion. The club
found the answer to this perplex
ing problem close at hand.:
Who quicksteps faster than a
speeding bullet, is more energetic
than Richard Simmons on a caf
feine fix and can lead tall partners
with a single grip? Why, none
other than 13-year inveterate
dance teacher Robin Ruebello her
self. Described by Boronkay as
"power density," this small
wonder has instructed classes of
over 100 people at a YMCA in
Los Altos. Before she was drafted
by the SBDC in 1987, she taught
some of the seminars for the club
and notes there's "a trend that
interest (in ballroom dance) has
been growing ... it has jumped
in the last nine to 12 months."
Thus, enthusiasm, motivation
and overall zest for ballroom
dancing is on the upswing. Help

have undergone two major
generations of leadership since
(the club's) original establish
ment. There are a number of key
organizers who have passed down
duties in a process of succession.
We are regenerative in terms of
leadership ..." The final prod
uct of the devised format, he says,

in conjunction with dedicated di
rection, should result in a self
sustaining organization.
Ah, but once underway, yet an
other obstacle was encountered:
We've got to fight!!!
For our right!!!
To Paaart . . . ner dance!!!
Rumors circulated last year
that their mecca of good, clean
fun — the Old Union Clubhouse
Ballroom — was going to be con
verted into office space for student
groups. The troops were
mobilized, and pens were wielded.
A petition to the administration,
coupled with Student Organiza
tion Services' support, ended in a
decision to delay the conversion.
Singh voices a passionate plea
on the topic of ballroom dance
space in relation to his venture,
". . . it [the dance clubl can be
destroyed overnight, if they yank
that space away." His solution:
"under no circumstances should
precious prime space be com
promised ... it must be preserved
until equivalent space is available
with similar access."
Luckily, not all problems have
been so touchy — witness a sub
ject that has been successfully ad
dressed and resolved, apparently
to the satisfaction of all. In the
club's debut, it seems, instructor
consistency was non-existent.
Visiting dancers offered scattered
lessons, and the long workshops
ended in confusion. The club
found the answer to this perplex
ing problem close at hand.:
Who quicksteps faster than a
speeding bullet, is more energetic
than Richard Simmons on a caf
feine fix and can lead tall partners
with a single grip? Why, none
other than 13-year inveterate
dance teacher Robin Ruebello her
self. Described by Boronkay as
"power density," this small
wonder has instructed classes of
over 100 people at a YMCA in
Los Altos. Before she was drafted
by the SBDC in 1987, she taught
some of the seminars for the club
and notes there's "a trend that
interest (in ballroom dance) has
been growing ... it has jumped
in the last nine to 12 months."
Thus, enthusiasm, motivation
and overall zest for ballroom
dancing is on the upswing. Help
ing to organize the Viennese Ball

and occasional pilgrimages to ac
tual dance halls is an additional
lure of learning proper partner
dance. To the dismay of many,
however, classes for beginners are
limited to 30 couples, while ad
vanced classes can only accomo
date 8 couples. The autumnal
bumper crop of registrants yielded
a teeming cornucopia of Fred and
Ginger wanna-bes. The result is
a waiting list as long as the class
list. The teacher's reaction: "I was
not overwhelmed; I feel more
gratification and overjoyment. It's
so neat to see so many people into
ballroom dancing!"
The incredible increase is ini
tially inexplicable. A peek into
Sunday night's beginning classes
and it's easy to observe more col
lisions than a demolition derby,
followed by some rather unortho
dox dance jargon: "@#s*! — two
— three, one — two — !(a #*!!"
But contrary to previous descrip
tion, and overlooking the bumping
elbows, stepped-on toes and

wrong leads, the dancers are
eager, happy and hungry for
steps. The smiles of class mem
bers can account for the stampede
during attendence sign-ups. In
Ruebello's view, "more and more
people are discovering that it's
more fun to hold a partner than
disco dancing." A look into the
advanced class reveals difficult
turns, fancy footwork and varia
tions unseen in the first-level
class.
So, after all the hoopla, what
makes one follow the "bouncing
ball"? Senior Angela Wood, now
in her fourth year of ballroom
dancing, admits of her addiction,
"some of us get hooked."
"It's fun. It's social. It's exer
cise," is the simple three-pronged
answer offered by charter member
Boronkay.
Singh enthusiastically encaps
ulates the ardor for dancing. He
zealously exclaims, "It sends
goooze-bumps!"
