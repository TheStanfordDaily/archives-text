# Suit alleges alien attack
## 
### Jock Friedly Editorial staff 
"Malevolent extraterrestrial
vampires" are taking over the
world, and word has it that the
Stanford Hospital was the first
place hit.
Yes, it's true. You read it here
first: malevolent extraterrestrial
vampires.
Since the attack, which al
legedly occurred during the sum
mer of 1988, San Francisco resi
dent Mark Kalogris has sued the
University for medical malprac
tice which occured during the
alien attack, he says in the suit.
He alleges that the emergency
room doctors at the hospital
turned him away from psychiatric
counseling during the invasion.
In an interview yesterday, Dean
of the Medical School David Korn
was surprised, to say the least, to
hear of the suit. But he added,
"I would be surprised if there
were not aliens here. Sounds like
a normal day's business."
When asked what hospital offi
cials would do about the attack,
Korn responded, "We'll just add
that to the list."
Two weeks ago, the Soviet news
agency Tass reported, with the
utmost seriousness and journalis
tic integrity, that aliens had
landed outside of Moscow. No one
has yet established a link between
the two cases.
Kalogris claims he had been dis
charged from the care of his psy
chiatrist in July 1988. The next
month, Kalogris had been the vic
tim of a freeway shooting and con
sequently had spent several sleep
less nights worried that — among
other things — he was going to
be assassinated.
After spending a full day
"repelling what appeared to him
to be a hostile takeover attempt
by malevolent extraterrestrial
vampires," the battle-weary
Kalogris went to the hospital for

psychiatric services. According to
the suit, he was sent away.
After leaving campus, he said
he was "threatened and pursued"
by a "vanguard of a well
organized invasion force of
malevolent extraterrestrial "body
snatchers' intent upon immediate
planetary conquest."
He was later stopped by a police
officer whom he thought was
"under mental mind control of the
hostile extraterrestrials, or pos
sibly occupying a synthetic body."
As any sane person would do
under the circumstances, he fled
and led the officers on a 45-
minute high-speed car chase.
At the booking station after his
apprehension, he delivered his
warnings to the deputies that they
too might be subject to having
their bodies snatched. He warned
that "the conscious-yet-not-alive
invaders were capable of moving

along a beam of light, and there
fore capable of seizing control of *
human beings by accessing the
central nervous system through
the pupils of their victims' eyes."
Because the aliens seemed to
target law-enforcement personnel, t
he urged them to protect them- ;
selves by wearing mirrored-lens -
sunglasses. <
Kalogris filed suit against the ,
hospital, the Stanford Clinic, the «
UC-San Francisco Medical Center *
and the Langley Porter Psychia- «
trie Institute and several individ- •
ual doctors. None of the aliens »
were named in the suit.
The litigation has proceeded {
very slowly. It seems Stanford's
lawyers have had difficulties gath- ♦
ering information on the invasion. •
According to University staff at-1
torney Jennifer Westerlind, "We !
found that most of our witnesses *;
are out of the universe."
