Stanford Hospital was the first

Yes, it's true. You read it here

Since the attack, which al
legedly occurred during the sum
mer of 1988, San Francisco resi
dent Mark Kalogris has sued the
University for medical malprac

alien attack, he says in the suit.
He alleges that the emergency
room doctors at the hospital
turned him away from psychiatric
counseling during the invasion.
In an interview yesterday, Dean

was surprised, to say the least, to

were not aliens here. Sounds like
a normal day's business."
