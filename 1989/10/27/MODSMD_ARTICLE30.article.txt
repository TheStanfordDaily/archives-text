How can one describe Erik
Thompson? He is unassuming and
soft-spoken. He has been arrested
for his anti-nuclear protests. He
studied political science here as
an undergraduate, and graduated
from Stanford's Graduate School
of Business. He has an income of
under $5,000 a year.
And he is running for the office
of President of the United States
of America.
Thompson was on campus last
week to campaign for his cause,
sponsored by the United Chris
tian Campus Ministries and the
Bechtel International Center. He
spoke at the I-Center in a talk
entitled "Perspectives on Peace,"
and also gave speeches at Florence
Moore Hall and Trancos.
His presidential bid, he said,
emerges from deeply-held per
sonal convictions, which
motivated him to campaign in
spite of a lack of campaign backing
and financial support. The Erik
Thompson for President Commit
tee is a one-man show.
His opinion of American society
is, "We don't have a democracy
here, but we don't demand it. In
some sense, we have democrati
cally opted for a non-democracy."
His campaign, he said, is all about
creating an American democracy.
Thompson was famous as a
Stanford business school student
for his "soap-box philosophizing,"
which consisted of standing on a
milk crate in White Plaza on Sun
day afternoons and speaking to
passers-by. He still holds the same
convictions now as he did during
his days as a student. He is, for
instance, still vehemently opposed

to the American military, and par
ticularly abhors nuclear weapons.
He believes that the manufacture
and use of such weapons con
travenes the Nuremburg prin
ciples, which condemn "the
wanton destruction of cities," and
devastation not of military neces
sity. "Nuclear weapons are a crime
against peace and people, and
their preparation also constitutes
a crime," he declared during his
speech.
Thompson proposes a massive
reduction in the military budget,
to the tune of $150 billion in the
first year alone. He also suggests
a reduction in military personnel
from 2.1 million to 1.2 million.
Although these proposals may be
economically and socially sound,
and even though he proposes to
use the $150 billion for "economic
