# A 						Stanford idealist pursues presidency
## 
### Rohan Sippy 
How can one describe Erik
Thompson? He is unassuming and
soft-spoken. He has been arrested
for his anti-nuclear protests. He
studied political science here as
an undergraduate, and graduated
from Stanford's Graduate School
of Business. He has an income of
under $5,000 a year.
And he is running for the office
of President of the United States
of America.
Thompson was on campus last
week to campaign for his cause,
sponsored by the United Chris
tian Campus Ministries and the
Bechtel International Center. He
spoke at the I-Center in a talk
entitled "Perspectives on Peace,"
and also gave speeches at Florence
Moore Hall and Trancos.
His presidential bid, he said,
emerges from deeply-held per
sonal convictions, which
motivated him to campaign in
spite of a lack of campaign backing
and financial support. The Erik
Thompson for President Commit
tee is a one-man show.
His opinion of American society
is, "We don't have a democracy
here, but we don't demand it. In
some sense, we have democrati
cally opted for a non-democracy."
His campaign, he said, is all about
creating an American democracy.
Thompson was famous as a
Stanford business school student
for his "soap-box philosophizing,"
which consisted of standing on a
milk crate in White Plaza on Sun
day afternoons and speaking to
passers-by. He still holds the same
convictions now as he did during
his days as a student. He is, for
instance, still vehemently opposed

to the American military, and par
ticularly abhors nuclear weapons.
He believes that the manufacture
and use of such weapons con
travenes the Nuremburg prin
ciples, which condemn "the
wanton destruction of cities," and
devastation not of military neces
sity. "Nuclear weapons are a crime
against peace and people, and
their preparation also constitutes
a crime," he declared during his
speech.
Thompson proposes a massive
reduction in the military budget,
to the tune of $150 billion in the
first year alone. He also suggests
a reduction in military personnel
from 2.1 million to 1.2 million.
Although these proposals may be
economically and socially sound,
and even though he proposes to
use the $150 billion for "economic

conversion activities," it doesn't
seem possible that entrenched po
litical and military groups would
allow a cut of this magnitude to
take place. Thompson politely
shies away from contemplating
this barrier, however — this isn't
the first time he's taken a stand
against mainstream America.
In fact, Thompson left the
United States after graduating
from Stanford in 1984, and
worked for two years in Truk,
Micronesia. His purpose in mov
ing was to assist economic devel
opment in Micronesia, and also to
avoid paying American military
taxes.
He decided to leave Truk, how
ever, when he saw that the
Micronesian government "was not
really interested in issues of de
velopment." Thompson returned
to the United States in 1987 be
cause it was time to "connect
back" to issues that concerned
him here, and he felt he could
continue to avoid military taxes
by maintaining an income of un
der $5,000 a year.
There is something reassuring
about this idealist, who continues
to hope for a better future despite
his own precarious financial and
legal position. Right now, he ad
mitted, there is less than $150 in

the Erik Thompson for President
checking account, and to compl
icate matters, he expects to be
convicted for trespassing on
private property in Los Alamos.
This creates a question mark
concerning his survival until
1992, let alone the possibility of
his taking residence at 1600 Penn
sylvania Ave. But Thompson
knows he's pursuing a quixotic
mission — he's a political
maverick who is completely sin
cere about his ideas and willing
to go out on a limb. Even if he
doesn't make it to the White
House, he said, he hopes to
mobilize the disjointed peace and
justice movements in the country.
Expounding upon his political
beliefs, Thompson remarked,
"The sad thing about this
semblance of a democracy we live
in is that we get what we deserve."
He added, however, that he hopes
a reason for this problem
is that "the people don't see a
vehicle to express their position."
Thompson observes this apathy
present among Stanford students
as well. "Not very many of them
are concerned about the lack of
democracy. There has been a
decline in public-spiritedness. It's
growing again, but 'doing for
others' seems to be a low priority
at Stanford. But then," noted
Thompson with a smile, "they're
still young."
