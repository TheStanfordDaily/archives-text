1. Electronic equipment should be kept away from water and
protected from falling during a quake. Broken electrical equipment
can cause fires after an earthquake.
2. Use multiple bolts to hold your loft or shelves together and add
diagonal braces to sides and corners.
3. Bolt bookcases to the wall with four or more bolts. Put restraining
straps on the bookshelves so books don't fall out. Put heavier
items near the bottom of the bookcase so they won't fall as far.
4. Be careful when building lofts or other furniture. Well-built
wooden structures are generally safe in an earthquake, but
damaged wood or weak connections may make them fall down
or crack.
5. Put a flashlight and extra batteries where you can reach them
easily and where other things won't fall on them.
6. Heavy or valuable equipment, like computers or appliances, may
shake off the edge of a table. Use cables or bolts to secure them.

7. Attach the loft to the wall or provide shock absorbers, such as
newspapers, so that your loft doesn't pound against the wall.
8. Anything stored above a bed or desk is extremely dangerous.
For small items, use a container that can be secured to the shelf.
If items cannot be secured adequately, move them elsewhere.
9. If you have chemicals, including cleaning fluids or lubricants,
stored in your room, make sure they can't accidently mix together.
The mixtures may create acids or release dangerous gases. Use
unbreakable containers and restraining straps.
• Know where fire extinguishers and Emergency Assembly Points
are.
• Use your common sense to think about what items might be
damaged in an earthquake.

Department of Public Safety (723-9633).
