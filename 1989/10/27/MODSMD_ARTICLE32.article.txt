## Stanford looks to bounce back against No. 10 USC 
### Chris Crader Editorial staff 
On paper, Saturday's Stanford-
USC football game looks to be a
blowout. The Trojans are 5-2
overall and, at 3-0, are the only
undefeated team in the Pacific 10
Conference. Stanford enters the
game 1-6 overall and 1-3 in the
Pac-10.

Stanford has rushed for 515
yards this year while Trojan tail
back Ricky Ervins has run for
735 yards by himself.
But the game will be played on
the field of the Coliseum, not on
paper. And on grass, Cardinal
players think they can beat USC.
"I think we have a shot at up
setting USC," outside linebacker
Chris Hawkins said. "We have to

play 60 minutes of football, and
we haven't done that this year."
The Trojans come into the game
riding a 16-game conference win
ning streak but are coming off a
disappointing loss to No. 1 Notre
Dame. The lOth-ranked Trojans
had more first downs, 95 more
yards and 10 more minutes of
possession, but lost 28-24.
"We put a lot into that game,"

USC Coach Larry Smith said.
"It's a real bummer, a real come
down."
Stanford knows the feeling well,
as the Cardinal also played the
Tighting Irish close this year
before losing. The team has
played its best against its toughest
opponents and will have to do so
again to knock off the heavy
preseason favorite to go to the

Rose Bowl.
Like the last two weeks, Stan
ford will face a team that likes to
throw the ball. Far from the "stu
dent body right" days of the past
20 years or so, Smith has opened
up the offense to allow
Marinovich, who was also highly
recruited by Stanford, a chance
to throw the ball.
To stop him, the Cardinal will
have to find the pass rush that
has been missing all season. A
key could be the play of outside
linebacker Rob Hinckley. Hinckley
played with a sore ankle for the
Cardinal's first two games, then,
when he was starting to get it all
together, he injured his back
against San Jose State.
He hasn't played a down since
the first quarter of that game but
is expected to be ready to go to
morrow. Hinckley led the Pac-10
in sacks as a junior last year, but
without him Stanford has only 11

sacks this year. By way of com
parison, the Cardinal offense has
allowed 29 sacks.
Hawkins, a junior, has been the
one who has replaced Hinckley
and while he has played well, he
doesn't add the pass-rushing abil
ity of Hinckley. "It's tough replac
ing someone like Rob Hincldey,"
Hawkins said. "It's strange filling
in for him. I'm just trying to do
what I can."
Despite his limited playing
time, Hawkins is tied for second
on the team with three tackles
for-loss and has 19 tackles. But
Hinckley, an All-Pac-10 per
former, is a key to the Stanford
defense.
"Rob is looking better," Stan
ford Coach Denny Green said.
"Rob is a big, strong player who's
had a great deal of [experience]."

pressure on Marinovich, he is li
able to have a big day. He is second
in the Pac-10 in efficiency rating
and set USC records with 33 com
pletions and 55 attempts against
Notre Dame. He had 333 yards
and three touchdowns against the
Irish.
"Marinovich is a hell of a quar
terback but not a veteran quar
terback," Green said. "We're going
to give him a lot of different
looks."
If the Cardinal can slow
Marinovich, however, the Trojans

still have a strong running game.
Ervins is 10th in the Pac-10 in
total offense and fullback Leroy
Holt became USC's top fullback
rusher. He has 1,587 career yards
and has had 393 of those this
year.
Despite the well-balanced of
fense, however, the Trojans have
used their defense to win the
games they have won this year.
They are only giving up 273.4
yards of total offense per game,
including a paltry 69.4 on the
ground. Their defense is led by
safeties Mark Carrier and
Cleveland Colter. The two have
combined for 104 tackles and Car
rier is fourth nationally with six
interceptions.
