# Football at USC
## 
### 
TOMORROW - Pacific Sports Network, KZSU (90.1-FM), KCBS (740 AM).
3:30 p.m kickoff at the Coliseum, Los Angeles. RECORDS — Stanford
(1-6, 1-3 in Pac-10 play), USC (5-2, 3-0).
INJURIES — For the Cardinal Jim Price, Jon Volpe. Brian Johnson, Eric
Thomas and Chris Dalman are out. Walter Batson, John Carpenter
and Rob Hinckley will likely play and and Jay Jay Lasley will play after
missing the last three games.
SERIES — The Trojans have won 45 of the 69 games. Stanford has won
21 and there have been three ties. USC scored a touchdown late in the
fourth quarter to salvage a 24-20 win last year. The Trojans have won
11 of the last 12, with the other game ending a tie. The tie occurred in
1979 and it cost USC the national title. The Trojans finished 11-0-1 and
ranked No. 2.
TROJAN UPDATE — Todd Marinovich has been the team leader this year
The redshirt freshman quarterback assumed the starting role in fall camp
when Pat O'Hara suffered a season-ending knee injury. Marinovich
started slowly but has become one of the best quarterbacks in the
Pac-10. With his improvement, the Trojans have thrown the ball more
than in any other recent year, although tailback Ricky Ervins is rushing
for more than 100 yards per game.
CARDINAL UPDATE — Stanford meets USC coming off its most devastating
loss of the year. The Cardinal will have to pass against the best run
defending team in the conference, so Steve Smith needs to have a big
game The Cardinal ground attack, with Lasley, Tom Vardell, Scott
Eschelman and Galen Foster, is in as good shape as it's been in all
year, but USC is giving up less than 100 yards on the ground per game.
