# Spikers travel north to hunt rival Ducks

### David Earnest Senior staff writer 
On Saturday, Sept. 30, the
. Stanford women's volleyball team
was 8-2, third in the Pacific 10
Conference and ranked fifth in
the country. That night, the Car
dinal lost at home to an unranked
but spirited Oregon team after
the Cardinal held 1-0 and 2-1
game leads.
Stanford has since won only two
of five matches, the worst loss
• being a four game defeat at the
hands of unranked San Jose State
• Tuesday night. And if the team's
J current trials are not enough, the
• Cardinal must play Oregon
• tonight, but this time in Eugene.
The loss to Oregon was the be
ginning of a slump for the team.
But Tuesday's loss may cause even
more problems for Stanford.
"I think there was a setback
Tuesday night and we had to take
time away from practice to meet
J and discuss some of these things,"
; Coach Don Shaw said. "It was a
• situation where we did not do
• what we were supposed to do. We
i were not ready to play I Tuesday 1.
<\ We may have taken away a little
r| bit from our preparations for
Oregon and Oregon State in
taking care of the things we
needed to do."
Shaw said the loss to San Jose

State was not an issue of prepa
ration, but one of mental disci
pline.
"We just lacked mental prepa
ration and we need to do a better
job of that," he said. "We had lost
(that preparation] the last couple
of matches. We had a pregame
meeting [but] it didn't register."
The Cardinal displayed a lack
of mental toughness in the first
match against the Ducks, who
won in spite of hitting a dismal
.151, even lower than Stanford's
.169 hitting percentage.
While Oregon may present a
formidable challenge to the Car
dinal, the Beavers will likely be
an easier match. Stanford swept
Oregon State on Sept. 29.
The weekend's matches are cri
tical pretests before next week
end's showdowns with conference
leaders USC and UCLA. If Stan
ford can play well tonight and
tomorrow, it will be able to make
a run for the conference title.
