# Polo looks to Pac-10s, needs consistent play

### T.C. Hall Staff writer 
According to Coach Dante Det
. tamanti, the 20-5 Stanford water
polo team faces what could be a
1 "turning point in the season" this
weekend as it travels to Long
Beach to participate in the Pacific
10 Conference/Big West tourna
ment.
The tournament includes eight
of the top-10 teams in the nation,
' including the host fifth-ranked
49ers of Cal State-Long Beach.
Stanford, ranked fourth nation
■ ally, will square off against Long
! Beach as well as No. 6 UCLA and
i No. 10 University of Pacific in
J the "B" bracket of the tourna
j ment. Stanford plays its first two
j games Saturday, facing UOP in
j the morning and Long Beach in
• the early evening. The team comes
\ back the next day to play UCLA.
" With liOng Beach and UCLA di-
I rectly behind Stanford in the
rankings, this weekend has added
importance.

"We can make it or break it
this weekend," Dettamanti said.
"We must beat the two teams that
are directly behind us [in the
rankings 1. We cannot afford ups
and downs."
These "ups and downs" have
plauged the team for much of the
season. The Cardinal beat UCLA
last Saturday 7-5 then lost to USC
the next day. Stanford had beaten
USC 14-5 in its previous game.
The squad's inability to consis
tently maintain a high level of
play was the topic of dis
cussion in the team meeting fol
lowing the USC game.
Consistency is vital for the team
to win its bracket in the tourna
ment. The "B" bracket winner will
meet the "A" bracket winner Sun
day night for the championship.
No.l California and No. 2 UC-
Irvine are both in the "A"
Bracket.
Dettamanti sees his team's
placement in the "B" bracket as
a good sign.
"The tournament is seeded in
our favor," Dettamanti said. "But
we have to give ourselves the op
portunity to play the No. 1 or No.
2 team and get back into the top
three [in the nation]."
The tournament plays a huge
role in the Cardinal's NCAA
chances. This weekend can be bro
ken down into simple terms: if
the team wins and beats higher
ranked teams, it will move up in
the standings and win a spot at
the NCAAs. If it loses, then nat
urally the squad will drop in the
standings and put itself in a dif
ficult position in terms of winning
a berth to the NCAAs.
Obviously, Dettamanti desires
the former.
• "We are trying to move up [in
the rankings]," Dettamanti said.
"You have to understand that we
are not trying to win games to
maintain our position. We want
to move up."
Getting back into the top three
when NCAAs roll around would
mean that the Cardinal would not
have to face a California team in
the first round. The fact that the
top nine teams in the country are
from California makes Det
tamanti's goal easy to understand.
