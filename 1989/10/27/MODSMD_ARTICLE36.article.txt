### T.C. Hall Staff writer 
According to Coach Dante Det
. tamanti, the 20-5 Stanford water
polo team faces what could be a
1 "turning point in the season" this
weekend as it travels to Long
Beach to participate in the Pacific
10 Conference/Big West tourna
ment.
The tournament includes eight
of the top-10 teams in the nation,
' including the host fifth-ranked
49ers of Cal State-Long Beach.
Stanford, ranked fourth nation
■ ally, will square off against Long
! Beach as well as No. 6 UCLA and
i No. 10 University of Pacific in
J the "B" bracket of the tourna
j ment. Stanford plays its first two
j games Saturday, facing UOP in
j the morning and Long Beach in
• the early evening. The team comes
\ back the next day to play UCLA.
" With liOng Beach and UCLA di-
I rectly behind Stanford in the
rankings, this weekend has added
importance.

"We can make it or break it
this weekend," Dettamanti said.
"We must beat the two teams that
are directly behind us [in the
rankings 1. We cannot afford ups
and downs."
These "ups and downs" have
plauged the team for much of the
season. The Cardinal beat UCLA
last Saturday 7-5 then lost to USC
the next day. Stanford had beaten
USC 14-5 in its previous game.
The squad's inability to consis
tently maintain a high level of
play was the topic of dis
cussion in the team meeting fol
lowing the USC game.
