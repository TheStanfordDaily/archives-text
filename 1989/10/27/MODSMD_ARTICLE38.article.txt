# Cross country plays host to Pac-10 meet
## 
### Ed Pike Staff writer 
The men's cross country team
has a simple goal at the Pacific
10 Conference Championship
meet Sunday afternoon at Stan
ford — winning.
Simple unless you consider
that the Pac-10 is one of the
toughest leagues in the country,
including such powerhouses as
third-ranked Arizona and
fourth-ranked Oregon.

'We need to place
five [runners] in
the top 20. That
will probably give
us the win.'

"The men want to win the Pac
-10," Coach Scott Chisam said.
"We went from second to eighth
last year."
The women, with several new
athletes, will count heavily on
senior Carol Gray and junior
Melanie Bloch to carry the load.
The team is also counting on
a home-field advantage. With the
race moved from its past Mon
day morning time slot to Sunday
at 4 p.m., it is hoping for faster
times and bigger crowds.
Seniors Eric and Mark Mas
talir and Bill Crowley will be the
favorites for Stanford. Eric, who
won his first race of the season
Sept. 16, has been training hard
but has not raced to avoid the
possibility of re-ii\juring a tender
calf muscle. For Eric, the na
tion's top high school runner
four years ago, this will be a
race against NCAA 5,000-meter
champion Marc Davis of Arizo
na.
Davis is the favorite, but all
of Stanford's top three will be
within striking distance if he fal
ters. Last year, Eric finished
26th in the Conference but went
on to win the District Champi
onship. The real battle in terms
of the conference title, however,
will be how Stanford stacks up
against Arizona and Oregon
deeper in the running order.
"We need to place five I run
ners! in the top 20," Chisam
said. "That will probably give us
the win."
Stanford will rely heavily on
junior Jason Martin, and soph
omores Dave Scudamore, Alex
Accetta and Fred Carter.
Scudamore finished 19th in the
Pac-10 meet last year.
Crowley has been encouraged

by the development of his
younger teammates. "They're
really starting to grow into their
roles," he said after the team's
last competition, the Stanford
Invitational, three weeks ago.
This meet also will be impor
tant as a step on the road to the
NCAA Championships, the
team's top seasonal goal. The
squad will have to beat at least
eight of the other Pac-10 teams
at the District-8 Championships
November 11 to qualify.
The women's fate is much less
certain. "We could finish any
place from first to sixth,"
Chisam said. "There are a lot of
unknowns."
Chief among these will be how
the new athletes respond to pres
sure. Gray has yet to run her
past standards but always
finishes among the top few at
cross country meets.
The \ll-American will have
her toughest competition from
Washington State's Jennifer
Robinson. Historically, the win
ning time in the 5,000-meter
race has been close to 17
minutes.
Running with Gray will be
Melanie Bloch and, hopefully,
sophomore Jeannie Heltzel.
Bloch, a junior, is due for a
breakthrough. Heltzel will have
to overcome back spasms and
lack of recent competition to run
with the leaders.

Jill Shenkel and junior Jamie
Fallon round out the Cardinal's

strengths, Chisam said both the
men's and women's teams will
try to get out in front and stay
there. The men are running a
eight-kilometer course (about
five miles), which necessitates
an even faster start than usual.
This could easily translate to a
4:30 mile for the front pack.
At the Stanford Invitational
Oct. 7, Stanford was ahead of
Arizona at the three mile mark
but could not hold its position
down the homestretch. The
squad is hoping that team tactics
will carry them through at the
Pac-lOs.
The top competition for the
women will be Washington,
Washington State, Oregon and
UCLA. While the team hopes to
finish in the top half of the com

petition, the best chance for in
dividual success lies with Gray
and Bloch.
Neither the men or women
have raced since the Stan
ford/Holiday Inn Invitational.
Instead, the squads have focused

on speed training and race tac
tics.
"There is a great deal of stress
on this campus [because of the
earthquake]," Chisam said. "It's
as if we had to compete during
finals week."

calf muscle. For Eric, the na
tion's top high school runner
four years ago, this will be a
race against NCAA 5,000-meter
champion Marc Davis of Arizo
na.
Davis is the favorite, but all
of Stanford's top three will be
within striking distance if he fal
ters. Last year, Eric finished
26th in the Conference but went
on to win the District Champi
onship. The real battle in terms
of the conference title, however,
will be how Stanford stacks up
against Arizona and Oregon
deeper in the running order.
"We need to place five I run
ners! in the top 20," Chisam
said. "That will probably give us
the win."
Stanford will rely heavily on
junior Jason Martin, and soph
omores Dave Scudamore, Alex
Accetta and Fred Carter.
Scudamore finished 19th in the
Pac-10 meet last year.
Crowley has been encouraged

by the development of his
younger teammates. "They're
really starting to grow into their
roles," he said after the team's
last competition, the Stanford
Invitational, three weeks ago.
This meet also will be impor
tant as a step on the road to the
NCAA Championships, the
team's top seasonal goal. The
squad will have to beat at least
eight of the other Pac-10 teams
at the District-8 Championships
November 11 to qualify.
The women's fate is much less
certain. "We could finish any
place from first to sixth,"
Chisam said. "There are a lot of
unknowns."
Chief among these will be how
the new athletes respond to pres
sure. Gray has yet to run her
past standards but always
finishes among the top few at
cross country meets.
The \ll-American will have
her toughest competition from
Washington State's Jennifer
Robinson. Historically, the win
ning time in the 5,000-meter
race has been close to 17
minutes.
Running with Gray will be
Melanie Bloch and, hopefully,
sophomore Jeannie Heltzel.
Bloch, a junior, is due for a
breakthrough. Heltzel will have
to overcome back spasms and
lack of recent competition to run
with the leaders.

strengths, Chisam said both the
men's and women's teams will
try to get out in front and stay
there. The men are running a
eight-kilometer course (about
five miles), which necessitates
an even faster start than usual.
This could easily translate to a
4:30 mile for the front pack.
At the Stanford Invitational
Oct. 7, Stanford was ahead of
Arizona at the three mile mark
but could not hold its position
down the homestretch. The
squad is hoping that team tactics
will carry them through at the
Pac-lOs.
The top competition for the
women will be Washington,
Washington State, Oregon and
UCLA. While the team hopes to
finish in the top half of the com

petition, the best chance for in
dividual success lies with Gray
and Bloch.
Neither the men or women
have raced since the Stan
ford/Holiday Inn Invitational.
Instead, the squads have focused

on speed training and race tac
tics.
"There is a great deal of stress
on this campus [because of the
earthquake]," Chisam said. "It's
as if we had to compete during
finals week."

Stanford will host the Pac-lOs this weekend. The women begin the
competition, taking off from the second tee of the Stanford Golf
Course at 4 p.m.
The men's cross country team
has a simple goal at the Pacific
10 Conference Championship
meet Sunday afternoon at Stan
ford — winning.
Simple unless you consider
that the Pac-10 is one of the
toughest leagues in the country,
including such powerhouses as
third-ranked Arizona and
fourth-ranked Oregon.

'We need to place
five [runners] in
the top 20. That
will probably give
us the win.'

"The men want to win the Pac
-10," Coach Scott Chisam said.
"We went from second to eighth
last year."
The women, with several new
athletes, will count heavily on
senior Carol Gray and junior
Melanie Bloch to carry the load.
The team is also counting on
a home-field advantage. With the
race moved from its past Mon
day morning time slot to Sunday
at 4 p.m., it is hoping for faster
times and bigger crowds.
Seniors Eric and Mark Mas
talir and Bill Crowley will be the
favorites for Stanford. Eric, who
won his first race of the season
Sept. 16, has been training hard
but has not raced to avoid the
possibility of re-ii\juring a tender
calf muscle. For Eric, the na
tion's top high school runner
four years ago, this will be a
race against NCAA 5,000-meter
champion Marc Davis of Arizo
na.
