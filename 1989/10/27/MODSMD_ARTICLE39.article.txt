## 
### Michael Clayton Staff writer 
With NCAA post-season invitations
going out in less than three days, many
of the top women's soccer teams will be
resting on their season's accomplish
ments while waiting to hear which 12
squads have been selected for the tour
ney. However, five top-20 teams will be
trying to turn in a strong season-ending
performance in the first-ever Cardinal
Invitational this weekend at Harry
Maloney Field.
Second-ranked Colorado College,
sixth-ranked UC-Santa Barbara, 11th
ranked Wisconsin, 18th-ranked St.
Mary's and 20th-ranked Stanford all go
into the tournament with the goal of
making the committee's decision a little
easier. After shaking up the women's
soccer world with a 0-0 tie against No.
1 North Carolina Tuesday, the Cardinal
is one team that has put itself in a
definite position to grab a playoff bid
with a strong showing in its final home
stand of the year.
"We usually view each game as a fun
challenge," Coach Berhane Andeberhan
said. "But we have added some meaning
to this weekend's games by getting our
selves in position to make the playoffs."

The Cardinal will attempt to improve
on its 10-4-2 record Friday at 4 p.m.
against Wisconsin and Sunday at noon
against UC-Santa Barbara. St. Mary's,
who beat Stanford 1-0 earlier in the
season but lost to North Carolina 5-0
last weekend, will challenge Colorado
College at 2 p.m. Friday and Wisconsin
at 2 p.m. Sunday.
"We don't expect to record two easy
wins," Anderberhan said. "Wis
consin and Santa Barbara are
both excellent teams, and our
players recognize we cannot af
ford a let-down after North
Carolina."
After racing to a Final Four
performance last season, Wiscon
sin has recorded a 12-3 record
this season under the direction of
Coach Greg Ryan, a former pro
fessional soccer player. The
Badgers, made up primarily of
players from the Midwest, play a
direct, aggressive game.

"I have a lot of respect for their
coach," Andeberhan said. "Wis
consin is a very well-organized,
well-coached team."
UC-Santa Barbara has utilized
a more technical, controlled game
plan to rack up its 14-2 record.
The Gauchos, led by Dianne
Manore's 10 goals and 4 assists,
have defeated California and U.S.
International University in their
last two games.
"We captured something on
Tuesday we have been striving for
all year," Andeberhan said. "One
of the players summed it up by
saying that the feeling after the
game made us want to work just
as hard, or even harder."
