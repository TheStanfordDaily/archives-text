# Faculty members seek voice in streamlining
## Task force hopes to trim University's red tape 
### Liz Lempert Staff writer 
Members of the Faculty Senate yesterday
questioned the lack of faculty representa
tion in a new task force established to
streamline University operations.
At yesterday's senate meeting, the Pres
ident's Task Force on Action Plans for
Change announced it will explore ways for
Stanford to improve efficiency, enhance
communications paths and clarify the Uni
versity's purpose and vision.
None of the six members of the task
force's steering committee are faculty mem
bers, which concerns Biology Prof. Robert
Simoni.
Simoni called the plan to reduce the
University's bureaucracy complicated and
said he was not optimistic about its imple
mentation by administrators.
"If you ask the faculty what's wrong
here," Simoni said, "it's too much admin
istration. The plan is symptomatic of the
problem."
University President Donald Kennedy

scolded Simoni, a former Biology Depart
ment colleague, for disregarding the fact
that several of the committee's members
used to be faculty before they became ad
ministrators.
Chemistry Chair John Ross said he was
concerned about the committee's approach.
"The [task force] is all from one side —
from the administrative side," he said.
Ross suggested the committee meet early
on with department chairs to assess faculty
concerns and find ways to involve faculty
and students.
Bob Street, chair of the committee,
agreed to meet with department heads and
also said the committee would be discussing
issues with faculty and staff through study
groups.
A serious budget crisis last year created
the need for a streamlining of University
operations, Provost James Rosse told the
senate.
Stanford's main sources of revenue —
tuition, research funding, endowment and
gifts — cannot continue to rise
as rapidly as in the past five years,
Rosse said.
"We're an institution that has
too many committees and too
much red tape," Rosse said.
"We're not as well-organized as
we should be.
"We're going to change the way
we do business around here," he
added. "We're going to restore the
Unviersity's vision and purpose."
The task force has identified
three main objectives:
• To strengthen the role of the
schools in University planning and
management.
• To strengthen the Office of
the Provost by organizational
simplification, and
• To simplify the University's
organizational structure and im
prove the ability to implement de
cisions quickly and effectively.
The task force will report its

results in 18 months, which will
correspond with the end of the
Centennial Campaign and the
start of Stanford's second century.
The committee hopes to have
implemented many of its recom
mendations by that time, not just
to have reported its findings,
Street said.
In other business, the Commit
tee on Academic Computing and
Information Systems reported
that humanities faculty members
do not utilize computers as much
as their colleagues in the natural
and social sciences. According to
the report, humanities faculty use
computers mainly for word proc
essing and not for research and
communication.
The committee recommended
the hiring of consultants to assist
humanities professors in using
computers in more facets of their
work.
History Prof. Peter Stansky
said he agreed with this recom
mendation, but, he said, "This
report makes me feel like a fossil."

He said the report reflects a
fundamental misunderstanding
about the humanities. Stansky
said the computer could only go
so far in enhancing the "relation
ship between my mind and a text."
English Prof. Albert Gelpi ob
jected to the phrase "lags behind"
to describe the humanities facul
ty's use of computers. "We use
word processing because basically
what we do is write," he said.
In other business, Kennedy took
time to thank the faculty for their
understanding and "extraordi
nary good will" in the aftermath
of the Oct. 17 earthquake.
He reminded the faculty to be
especially flexible toward relo
cated students and to show un
derstanding for those students
still disturbed by the trauma of
the event itself.
