# Hockey heads on road trip

Midway through the season, co-captain
Beth Lewinger described this season as "a
transitional year" for the Stanford women's
field hockey program.
Lewinger was right. Coming off the Cal
Invitational, the Stanford team definitely
shows signs of transition. In last weekend's
tournament, the Cardinal polished its
threatening new offensive power, scoring
three goals in four games to break its eight
game scoreless streak.
This change could not have come at a
better time for the Cardinal. Tomorrow,
Stanford battles Lafayette College in the
first of four matches on its annual East
Coast trip. With successive games against
Temple, Rutgers and Villanova, Stanford's
offensive strength is definitely timely.
"With the way we've been playing lately,
I don't think we'll be as intimidated back
East," forward Michele Beynet said.
Of course, it's easy for optimism to grow
when a team shows marked signs of im

provement. Since Stanford met Chico State
two weeks ago, the Cardinal has begun to
bombard opponents with a fusillade of shots
and corners. Last weekend, the momentum,
initiated by a Beynet goal early in the UOP
game, sparked subsequent goals from co
captain Michelanne Baker and Katy Filner.
And although the Cardinal emerged from
the Cal Invitational with an 0-3-1 record,
the momentum of the team continues to
build.
