# Women golfers host fall tournament
## 
### Brian W. Webber Staff writer 
As the women's golf team hosts
today's opening round of the Stanford
Intercollegiate, the squad does not have
to look far to find its chief competition.
The Pac-10 is a veritable cornucopia
of golf powers this season. To win this
weekend's event, the Cardinal will have
to overcome powerful divisional foes
such as Arizona, Arizona State, USC
and UCLA.
Evidence of the conference's strength

came two weeks ago at the University
of Washington Invite. The Cardinal
navigated the links skillfully to place
third in Seattle, yet found itself behind
the Trojans and Wildcats.
Sophomore Audrey Wooding is well
aware of problems posed by the team's
western foes. "The play in the Pac-10
is great. We face tough competition at
every tournament," Wooding said.
The squad returns all five of its
players from last year's successful
season. The Cardinal placed 10th in the
1989 NCAA Championship.

Joining Wooding are Sophomores
Adele Moore, Stephanie Davis, Junior
Jodi Figley and Senior Stephanie Parel.
Expectations are high for another fine
campaign. The team was ranked seventh
nationally in a pre-season coaches poll.
An important complement to the
team's talent is its confidence. "We feel
we are good enough to place first or
second in every tournament we play
this year," Wooding said.
Because of the 54-hole event, Stanford
golf course will be closed through Sun
day afternoon.
