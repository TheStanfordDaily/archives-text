# Chicago Bears' Muster to start in Guest Greek backfield
## 
### Buck Montana Senior staff writer 
The Greeks of the Week are
back, and a little less cocky this
week, heading into a slew of pick
'em games, highlighted by
Kansas versus Kansas State.
Last week's Guest Greek, Dirk
Facer of The Daily Utah
Chronicle, went 8-2 to move into
a tie for first place with Mark
Rogowsky, The Daily's guru at
large.
Carrying the flag for the
Guests this week is none other
than Brad Muster, a recent Stan
ford graduate who has found
success as a running back for
the Chicago Bears.
"I don't expect I will do very
well, but I just call them as I
see them," Muster said.
Muster, like several other
members of the panel, went out
on a limb in picking the Cardinal
over USC, a 20V2-point favorite.
Nat Cousins and David Hirning,
however, decided to live the life
of pond scum, picking the ENZ
boys over Stanford.
The biggest game of the week,
however, has to be the contest
between the Mildcats and the

No-Wayhawks. The two teams
have combined for about four
wins in the past decade, and
Muster fully expects that neither
will be able to pull out the vic
tory come tomorrow.
Muster becomes the third
Guest Greek to prognosticate a
tie this year, and the weird thing
is, the other two tie calls were
correct. "I understand the Guest
Greek has a tradition of predict
ing ties, and I have no idea be
tween Kansas and Kansas State,
so I expect they will tie," Muster
said.
Meanwhile, for the fifth week
in a row, the rapidly falling Chris
Crader picked the Ivy League
score to be 6-1. For those of you
not up on the latest NCAA rule
changes, yes, that score is pos
sible. A one-point safety is
awarded for returning the other
team's failed extra-point attempt
for a touchdown.
In this week's standings, Hir
ning continues to live it up with
the rats in the cellar, but Greg
Gottesman and Dave Earnest
are attempting to give him some
company. Cousins made a run
to third place last week, displac
ing Crader.

The Greeks of the Week are
back, and a little less cocky this
week, heading into a slew of pick
'em games, highlighted by
Kansas versus Kansas State.
Last week's Guest Greek, Dirk
Facer of The Daily Utah
Chronicle, went 8-2 to move into
a tie for first place with Mark
Rogowsky, The Daily's guru at
large.
Carrying the flag for the
Guests this week is none other
than Brad Muster, a recent Stan
ford graduate who has found
success as a running back for
the Chicago Bears.
"I don't expect I will do very
well, but I just call them as I
see them," Muster said.
Muster, like several other
members of the panel, went out
on a limb in picking the Cardinal
over USC, a 20V2-point favorite.
Nat Cousins and David Hirning,
however, decided to live the life
of pond scum, picking the ENZ
boys over Stanford.
The biggest game of the week,
however, has to be the contest
between the Mildcats and the

No-Wayhawks. The two teams
have combined for about four
wins in the past decade, and
Muster fully expects that neither
will be able to pull out the vic
tory come tomorrow.
Muster becomes the third
Guest Greek to prognosticate a
tie this year, and the weird thing
is, the other two tie calls were
correct. "I understand the Guest
Greek has a tradition of predict
ing ties, and I have no idea be
tween Kansas and Kansas State,
so I expect they will tie," Muster
said.
Meanwhile, for the fifth week
in a row, the rapidly falling Chris
Crader picked the Ivy League
score to be 6-1. For those of you
not up on the latest NCAA rule
changes, yes, that score is pos
sible. A one-point safety is
awarded for returning the other
team's failed extra-point attempt
for a touchdown.
In this week's standings, Hir
ning continues to live it up with
the rats in the cellar, but Greg
Gottesman and Dave Earnest
are attempting to give him some
company. Cousins made a run
to third place last week, displac
ing Crader.
