# Men's soccer hopes to revive at home
## 
### Andrew Wilcox Staff writer 
Intensity, a commodity missing in the last
two contests of the men's soccer team, will
be the key for the Cardinal this weekend as
the squad hosts Oregon State tomorrow at 2
p.m. and Washington Sunday at 10 a.m. at
Maloney Field.
After a 2-1 loss to the University of San
Francisco Wednesday, the Cardinal finds itself
struggling to break out of a late-season slump
that has dropped the team below .500 for the
first time in a month to a 7-8-2 mark.
With playoff hopes a distant memory and
no other concrete goal to shoot at, the squad
looked like it was simply going through the
motions in its last two games. "We have to
be more focused on what we're trying to
accomplish. We can't worry about our oppo

nents, we have to worry about ourselves,"
Coach Sam Koch said.
Sophomore midfielder-forward Rhett Harty,
who leads the Cardinal in scoring with 13
points, added, "Coming out with the right
attitude will be important for us. We're trying
to win these last few games for Semi [senior

sweeper Mark Semioli] and the other seniors."
Tomorrow's matchup with Oregon State
should provide Stanford with a golden oppor
tunity to snap out of its slump, as the Beavers'
program is only in its second year. The team
consists almost entirely of freshmen and soph
omores. Although Oregon State possesses an
11-4-2 record on the year, this mark has been
compiled predominately against weak compe
tition.
Sunday's contest will be a tougher trial for
the Cardinal, as the 11-4-1 Huskies are bat
tling for a NCAA playoff spot. Washington,
ranked sixth in the West, is led by diminutive
forward Eddie Henderson, who has 17 points
on the year. His counterpart at forward, senior
David Berto, is the Huskies' scoring leader
with 23 points.
The Stanford squad will be looking to avenge
a 5-2 loss to Washington last year in a tour
nament held at California's Memorial Stadium.
