Yesterday was a good day for
Stanford women at the Riviera
All-American Tennis Champion
ships in Pacific Palisades, Calif.,
but far from a perfect one.
Three of the Cardinal's five
singles players advanced to the
quarterfinals while two fell in
second-round matches. In dou
bles, one pair advanced impres
sively while the other was vic
timized by a shocking upset.
Defending NCAA champion
Sandra Birch had a relatively easy
time with UCLA's Stella Sampras,

scoring a 6-2, 6-3 win. She went
on to eliminate Danielle Scott of
Arizona by a score of 6-1, 6-2.
Sophomore Debbie Graham
demolished NCAA singles semi
finalist Noelle Porter of Pepper
dine, 6-2, 6-3. In her second-round
match, Graham put away USC's
Stephanie London, 6-2, 6-1.
Freshman Meredith McGrath
served notice that her advance
billing was not overblown.
McGrath thrashed Candy
Kopetzki of Indiana 6-0, 6-4. In
the afternoon, McGrath continue
her superb play and scored a 6-4,
5-1 win over California's Jean-
Marie Lozano. An injury forced

Lozano to retire.
The news wasn't as good for
Ail-Americans Teri Whitlinger
and Lisa Green. Whitlinger bested
Anya Kochoff of USC 6-1, 6-4 in
her opener. She then ran into
Georgia's Stacey Schefflin, the No.
10 player in the nation, and fell
6-4, 6-2.
Green also won her first-round
match, scoring a 6-4, 7-6 (7-3)
win over Trisha Laux of USC.
Green, however, could not over
come Pepperdine's Janna
Kovacevich in the next round,
losing 7-6 (7-3), 7-5.
In doubles action, NCAA
finalists Birch and Graham were

upset in the first round by Karen
Bergan and Jennifer Rojohn of
Arizona State. Their straight-set
defeat was by a 7-5, 6-2 score.
McGrath and Whitlinger, on the
other hand, were dominant in
their first competitive match to
gether. Against another Sun Devil
duo, Kristi Jonkosky and Luann
Klimchock, the Stanford pair
didn't lose a game en route to a
6-0, 6-0 victory.
Stanford and Georgia each
placed three players in today's
quarterfinals. Joining Schefflin
for the Bulldogs are Shannan Mc-
Carthy and Caryn Moss.
