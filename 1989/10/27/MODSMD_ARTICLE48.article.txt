# Technology could have limited quake damage

Last week's earthquake was dif
ferent in character from previous
ones, but new and unused tech
nologies could have limited some
of the damage, Stanford experts
said yesterday.
Speaking as part of a public
symposium in Terman Audito
rium designed to give up-to-date
information on last week's quake,
Civil Engineering Chair Haresh
Shah gave a brief overview of the
earthquake itself and the pattern
of plate activity in the area in the
past.

He said that prior geological ac
tivity has been centered in areas
to the north and south of the
Loma Prieta Mountain, the
epicenter of the Oct. 17 temblor,
and that "the latest event has
filled in the gap."
Prof. Anne of the
John Blume Earthquake Engi
neering Laboratory spoke about
the physics of the ground motion
caused by the quake.
The earthquake appeared to be
different from previous ones, she
said, mainly in the frequency and
period patterns of the ground mo
tion. She said this may be due to

the differences in local soil condi
tions, but added that further
study is needed.
Prof. Helmut Krawinkler, also
of the John Blume Earthquake
Engineering Laboratory, dis
cussed the mtyor reasons for the
extensive damage to buildings in
Santa Cruz and the Marina dis
trict in San Francisco and to the
Cypress overpass, which collapsed
in Oakland.
He cited such factors as poorly
anchored walls on buildings
higher than those surrounding
them, and columns in the Cypress
overpass that were wound with

stirrups that should have been
more closely placed.
Krawinkler also said the
damage and amount of casualties
would have been much greater
had the earthquake occurred in
any other part of the world, al
though he said much of the
damage could have been mini
mized or avoided.
"It is too bad that we have to
spend $5 to $10 billion to clean
up the mess rather than prevent
it," Krawinkler said, "but if there
is one thing we should learn, it
is to practice a little preventive
medicine."
