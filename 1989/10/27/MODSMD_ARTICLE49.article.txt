# Pair of seniors in Plaza 'just here to talk'
##

They're not selling anything.
They're not circulating petitions.
They're not religious fanatics.
"We're just here to talk," said
Dave Martinez, a senior. "People
only come through White Plaza
to go somewhere else."
Fellow senior Craig Owen
agreed. "We want to help people
slow down and enjoy other people
and the scenery," he said.
To accomplish that goal, Mar
tinez and Owen started holding
weekly public conversations in

White Plaza yesterday. Their
prominently displayed sign invited
people to "Come talk with Craig
and Dave".
The two are an unassuming
presence â€” rumpled and vaguely
scruffy. Exuding a very low level
of energy, they welcome any con
versational topic, with one caveat:
no "political bullshit."
The two seniors imposed the
single restriction on conversation
for what they believe to be the
benefit of the community. "It's a
public service we're providing to
students at Stanford," said Owen.
"We're giving people a chance to

spend a few relaxing minutes with
Craig and Dave."
"We're not trying to be
profound," Owen continued. "If
we thought we had anything
profound to say, we'd probably
have a podium."
The two began spending after
noons in White Plaza about two
years ago as sophomores. "We had
a few regulars that year," said
Martinez. "But we kind of tapered
off a little bit last year."
While their immediate plans are
to continue holding Thursday af
ternoon "rap groups" in White

Plaza, Owen mused about future
possibilites for the talking duo.
"What does the future hold for
us?" he wondered. "Hopefully an
article in the (San Jose) Mercury
News. With a picture. That's our
dream."
Although they would like to be
recognized for their social activ
ism, Owen and Martinez do not
feel possessive about their terri
tory in White Plaza. "We'd be per
fectly happy if 'Talk to Jen and
Bob' popped up across the road,"
he said. "We just want to get
people talking."
