# Rape attempt in Foothills
## Campus woman assaulted during nighttime jog 
### Elizabeth Howton Editorial staff 
A woman jogging in the Foothills behind
the Stanford campus survived an assault
and attempted rape Wednesday night, the
Stanford police said yesterday.
The jogger, who is reportedly a member
of the campus community, though not a
student, was forced off a service road near
the Stanford Solar Observatory by a man
who threatened her with a knife, but she
managed to get away, according to Police
Chief Marvin Herrington.
The assailant was described as a white
male in his early 20s, about 6-foot-l and
of medium build. He has light brown collar
length hair and was clean-shaven.
He was wearing a black sleeveless T-shirt
over a white shirt with sleeves showing
and black full-length running tights, Her
rington said.
The incident took place on an unnamed
service road west of Junipero Serra Boul
evard that is closed to vehicle traffic but
is popular with runners. The woman en
tered the roadway at the gated entrance
near the intersection of Junipero Serra and
Santa Maria Street. She was accosted not
far from there at about 8:30 p.m., Her
rington said.
"We are urging people to be careful about
running in that area because it's very iso
lated with no lights and no phones," Her
rington said.
Signs posted at the entrance to the road

say the area is closed to everyone after
sunset, Herrington said, "but runners
should be cautious there even in daylight."
But "rape happens all over this campus,
even with a lot of people around," said
1986 graduate Ann Fischer Hecht, a mem
ber of the Women Defending Ourselves Col
lective, which teaches women's self-defense
classes on campus.
She cited a survey done by members of
one class that charted sexual assaults and
attempted sexual assaults as having oc
curred in locations as diverse as Campus
Drive, the Physics Tank, and women's own
rooms.
"Caution is a good thing if it makes
women foel safer, but it is not a substitute
for thinking about self-defense strate
gies. . . . There's really no way a woman
can totally avoid putting herself into situ
ations vulnerable to rape," Hecht said.
A survey of 1,250 Stanford students by
the Rape Education Project released last
May revealed that one out of three Stanford
undergraduate women and one out of four
graduate women have experienced some
form of sexual coercion or rape.
Wednesday's was the first report of an
attempted sexual assault on campus this
year. Herrington said.
However, in late September police were
on the lookout for a man who was "in
decently exposing himself' to women jog
ging in the Foothills. There has been at
least one other attempted rape in the Foot
hills reported in the last three years.
