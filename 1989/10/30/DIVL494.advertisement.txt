t doesn't take a genius to understand why Einstein was such a phenomenal success.
He was never satisfied with conventional wisdom. His theories extended far beyond the
four walls of the lab. And his creative energy seemed boundless.
He would have enjoyed working at Farallon. After all, we encourage free-thinking
Mac programmers to author new products, to redefine traditional networking categories
and, generally, to wear out a mouse in pursuit of unheard of software applications.
Einstein never had the awesome power of a Mac at his command. But you do.
And now you can make the most of your genius at Farallon.
We are seeking Programmers with a BS/MS/PhD in Computer Science or Electri
cal Engineering, and at least 1 year of applied Macintosh programming experience (com
mercial or noncommercial) in Light Speed C, C, 68000 or Pascal. We'd like to talk to
