In 17H2, in the court of Emperor Joseph 11, a
brash young composer named Wolfgang Amadeus
Mozart set the music world on its ear. A radical
departure from the current fashion in music,
he set a new standard for style and composition.
It has always been so. The old guard surpassed
by a new wave. It's true today in the area of
software tools for IC IX-sign Automation (ICDA)
Cadence broke with the conventional order to
create the industry's only completely integrated
ICDA software solution. Our high-performance
CAD/CAE tools are coordinated into one har
monious environment, allowing the user to
arrange the entire IC design process from
design entry to final verification.
Our approach to integrating the IC. design
process has made Cadence the leader in ICDA
software. Significantly larger than our nearest
competitor, we are a financially-secure, fully
resourced company. And we're grow ing at 70%

in concert is reflected in our workplace as
