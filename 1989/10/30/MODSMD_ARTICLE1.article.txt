um.
Delivering the keynote ad
dress for Stanford's AIDS
Awareness Week, Dr. Richard
Keeling called for a re-evaluation
of the fundamental causes be
hind behavior that poses the risk
of AIDS.
Keeling is the chair of the Na
tional HIV and AIDS Task Force
of the American College Health
Association and former president
of the American College Health
Association.
Previously, AIDS prevention
strategies focused on providing
information about the dangers

of AIDS and how to avoid them,
Keeling said.
However, he argued, "We have
discovered . . . that information
is not the need. Students in high
school and college know, basical
ly, what they need to know."
The focus of previous AIDS
prevention strategies "is much
too superficial," Keeling said,
"We tend to focus on the actions
and the end results, and not very

much on the whys and the hows."
Barriers to solutions
Ideally, knowledge of AlDS
related risks should influence the
behavior of an individual. How
ever, Keeling pointed out this does
not happen for several reasons.
The first, known as the "invin
cibility syndrome," is the attitude
that AIDS "simply can't happen
to me." This attitude allows indi
viduals to know about AIDS pre
vention, but not practice it,
Keeling said.
In addition, Keeling empha
sized the connection between al
cohol and harmful sexual
behavior. He said, "We probably
should be looking not just at why
people are having sex, but why
are they drunk (and having sex)?"
People who feel anxious about
intimacy use alcohol to reduce
their embarrassment rather than
learning to relate to each other,
Keeling said in response to his
own question.
Similarly, he argued that peer
pressure encourages students to
disregard what they know about
AIDS prevention. Keeling cited a
study from Texas A & M Univer
sity in which half the male re
spondents admitted they didn't
want to have intercourse, but did
so only because they felt society

expected it of them.
Keeling elaborated on this con
tradiction between "what we do
vs. what we value." The basic
values behind AIDS prevention
strategies often run counter to
popular media images of our cul
ture, he said.
Keeling said popular music
sometimes manifests this con
tradiction. Many bands, he
argued, present — along with
their messages of alienation — a
serious questioning of any guide
lines. This is damaging to efforts
for AIDS prevention, according to
Keeling.
Self-esteem, as well, is an im
portant issue in the discussion of
AIDS prevention, according to
Keeling. The actions one takes,
whether it be the choice to have
sexual intercourse, to share
needles with someone else while
using anabolic steroids, or simply
the decision to communicate with
one's partner in a relationship,
are all affected by one's self
esteem.
Keeling is most familiar with
the aspect of AIDS prevention
that deals with needle sharing.
Among adolescents, the problem
is not heroine or crack, but
anabolic steroids, he said. Six to
11 percent of adolescent males
have used anabolic steroids,
Keeling said, and nearly half of
those stated they did so because
they thought it would enlarge
their penis.

Keeling called for an examina
tion of the cultural context that
imposes this standard on an in
dividual's self-esteem, rather than
a simple denunciation of their use.
What we can do
Keeling admitted that his is a
somber estimation of the pros
pects for AIDS prevention in the
future, but suggested some sig
nificant improvements in AIDS
prevention strategies.
He called for continued "skill
building." This includes encour
aging better communication and
honesty between partners, pro
moting self-esteem, and removing
alcohol from the ritual of sex.
"Intimacy is a decision. It
doesn't just happen," Keeling
said, emphasizing the need for
conversation between sexual
partners. Both partners must not
let alcohol, anxiety, ambivalence,
or embarrassment be what just
"lets" intimacy happen.
Most important, according to
Keeling, is that AIDS prevention
requires a closer examination of
the signals our culture sends us
and demands serious attention to
our responses. He admitted the
difficulty in the task, and said he
is unsure of where to begin him
self.
Keeling concluded by returning
to his main point that we must
"look back at what we've done . . .
and realize that there's a bigger
problem there than we thought."
