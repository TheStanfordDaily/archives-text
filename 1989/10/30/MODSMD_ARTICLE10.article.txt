As if a quake weren't enough ...
.. . now her wheelchair's gone.
Shortly after midnight Wednesday, senior Alli
son May parked her motorized wheelchair in the
hall outside her first-floor room in Twain, as she
does every night. When she woke up, the books
she had left in the basket were on the floor, but
the chair was gone.
Needless to say, May would like it back. She
has been borrowing a spare chair from a friend
in the meantime.
The chair is an electric "Amigo" brand that
looks more like a scooter than a conventional
wheelchair. It's black with a yellow motor.
Anyone who has information on the theft
should call the Stern Hall Residence Office at
723-3297.

Gymnast's condition improves
Two weeks after a major gymnastics accident
seriously injured her neck, sophomore Adriana
Duffy is recuperating in a West German hospital.
Doctors there have listed her in stable condition,
and last Tuesday Duffy was taken out of intensive
care.
While performing a vault routine during warm
ups for the World Gymnastics Championships
Oct. 12, Duffy slipped off the vault and broke
her neck between the sixth and seventh vertebrae.
After undergoing two hours of surgery on her
spine, Duffy regained use of her upper body.
Doctors are still not certain whether she will
sustain any permanent paralysis. She underwent
further surgery last week.
Duffy, a member of the women's gymnastics
team, will be moved either to Miami or Los
Angeles next month to begin nine months of
rehabilitation. She wants to return to Stanford
next year to continue pursuing a major in phi
losophy.
A native of San Juan, Puerto Rico, Duffy was
competing for the Puerto Rican national team
when the accident occured.

Flicks flub Hitchcock again
Alfred Hitchcock seems to enjoy playing tricks
on the ASSU Sunday Flicks. On the heels of an

objectionable Hitchcock short last week came a
missing full-length Hitchcock film at last night's
Flicks.
Due to a distributor's error, the scheduled
Hitchcock classic "Rear Window" was not shown.
In an impromptu encore, "Harold and Maude"
was shown instead.
Some who missed the showing of "Harold and
Maude" two weeks ago or were big fans watched
the flick, but most lined up for refunds. Pass
holders got their big $1 investment back at the
door, many with the reported intention of renting
the movie themselves.
Let's just hope next week the distributors "Do
the right thing" .. .

Grad student committee forms
The ASSU has formed another committee, this
one to deal with issues specific to graduate stu
dent life. A group of 20 graduate students rep
resenting eight departments in the School of Hu
manities and Sciences held the inaugural meeting
of the Graduate Concerns Committee Thursday.
The committee discussed the perceived need
to increase summer financial aid to allow students
to expedite their programs — a step encouraged
by many departments, according to the commit
tee.
It also focused on increasing the role graduate
students play in the faculty tenure and promotion
process.
The committee plans to meet regularly, and
all graduate students are encouraged to attend,
organizers said. The next meeting will be Thurs
day at noon in the ASSU offices in Tresidder.
