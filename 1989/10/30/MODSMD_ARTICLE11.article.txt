## Rally for leaders is largest in South African history 
### 
CROWN MINES, South Africa
(AP) — More than 70,000 blacks
chanting in triumph welcomed
freed leaders of the outlawed
African National Congress yester
day at the largest anti-government
rally in the country's history.
Virtually every aspect of the
rally — including repeated praise
for the ANC's guerrilla campaign
— violated security laws, but
police kept their distance.
Government-run television re
ported the rally as the top item
on the evening news.
"Today, the ANC has captured
center stage in South Africa," said
Walter Sisulu, 77, the group's
former general secretary, from a
podium erected beneath huge ban
ners of the ANC and the South
African Communist Party He and
six ANC colleagues were freed un
conditionally from prison Oct. 15.
All but one had spent at least 25
years in prison.
The crowd, which also included
white South Africans and
diplomats from at least 15 coun
tries, filled most of the seats in
a soccer stadium recently opened
outside Johannesburg.
"We have come here to witness
a historic event," said West Ger
man diplomatic Andreas Zobel.
Police and soldiers set up
roadblocks nearby and searched
vehicles, but few security force
personnel were visible at the sta
dium itself.
Sisulu said his movement would
never abandon its guerrilla cam
paign unilaterally but would con
sider suspending violence and en
tering talks if the government

freed all political prisoners,
legalized the ANC and lifted the
40-month-old state of emergency.
"To date, we see no clear indi
cation that the government is
serious about negotiation," said
Sisulu, who urged intensified eco
nomic sanctions. "All the ut
terances are vague."
The government gave permis
sion for the rally to take place,
part of an attempt by President
F.W. de Klerk to promote black
white negotiations on a new con
stitution. Hut a magistrate had
warned organizers that speakers
should avoid promoting ANC
aims.
"We refused," said Cyril
Ramaphosa, a union leader and
one of the main organizers. "The
ANC lives. It is amongst us."
Deafening cheers erupted when
Sisulu and his colleagues emerged
from beneath the grandstands and
slowly circled the playing field be
hind an honor guard of 20 young
militants, clad in khaki uniforms
and marching in military style.
At the end of the parade was
80-year-old ANC official Oscar
Mpetha, being pushed in a wheel
chair. He was the country's oldest
political prisoner before his re
"ANC, ANC!" shouted the
crowd, many dressed in the move
ment's green, black and gold
colors.
Another roar came when pro
minent activist Murphy Morobe
read a letter of greeting from
Oliver Tambo, the exiled president
of the ANC, who may not legally
be quoted in South Africa.

"This is a joyful day for all of
us," said the message. "We meet
to celebrate a victory that belongs
to all the people of our country."
Tambo directed part of his re
marks at South African whites
who seek to maintain apartheid,
which denies the nation's 28 mil
lion blacks a voice in national af
fairs. The 5 million whites control
the economy and maintain sepa
rate schools, districts and health
services.
"They are part of our heritage,"
Tambo's message said. "In the
end, they too must learn to cele
brate freedom and not oppres
sion."
If the government tries to per
petuate minority rule, said
Tambo, blacks will win their
stuggle through confrontation
and de Klerk "will disappear
forever in the dim mists of his
tory."
Morobe, who was seven years
old when Sisulu went to prison,
told the crowd: "When our com
rades went to jail, they left us a
candle. ... It has turned into a
wildfire that must extinguish and
smother apartheid forever."
In addition to the seven ANC
leaders freed Oct. 15, the rally
also honored Govan Mbeki, re
leased from prison in November
1987. Sisulu, Mbeki and four of
the other men were sentenced to
life imprisonment at a 1964
treason trial along with Nelson
Mandela, the ANC's best-known
leader, who remains jailed.

mass rally yesterday in Soweto, South Africa.
CROWN MINES, South Africa
(AP) — More than 70,000 blacks
chanting in triumph welcomed
freed leaders of the outlawed
African National Congress yester
day at the largest anti-government
rally in the country's history.
Virtually every aspect of the
rally — including repeated praise
for the ANC's guerrilla campaign
— violated security laws, but
police kept their distance.
Government-run television re
ported the rally as the top item
on the evening news.
"Today, the ANC has captured
center stage in South Africa," said
Walter Sisulu, 77, the group's
former general secretary, from a
podium erected beneath huge ban
ners of the ANC and the South
African Communist Party He and
six ANC colleagues were freed un
conditionally from prison Oct. 15.
All but one had spent at least 25
years in prison.
The crowd, which also included
white South Africans and
diplomats from at least 15 coun
tries, filled most of the seats in
a soccer stadium recently opened
outside Johannesburg.
"We have come here to witness
a historic event," said West Ger
man diplomatic Andreas Zobel.
Police and soldiers set up
roadblocks nearby and searched
vehicles, but few security force
personnel were visible at the sta
dium itself.
Sisulu said his movement would
never abandon its guerrilla cam
paign unilaterally but would con
sider suspending violence and en
tering talks if the government

freed all political prisoners,
legalized the ANC and lifted the
40-month-old state of emergency.
"To date, we see no clear indi
cation that the government is
serious about negotiation," said
Sisulu, who urged intensified eco
nomic sanctions. "All the ut
terances are vague."
The government gave permis
sion for the rally to take place,
part of an attempt by President
F.W. de Klerk to promote black
white negotiations on a new con
stitution. Hut a magistrate had
warned organizers that speakers
should avoid promoting ANC
aims.
"We refused," said Cyril
Ramaphosa, a union leader and
one of the main organizers. "The
ANC lives. It is amongst us."
Deafening cheers erupted when
Sisulu and his colleagues emerged
from beneath the grandstands and
slowly circled the playing field be
hind an honor guard of 20 young
militants, clad in khaki uniforms
and marching in military style.
At the end of the parade was
80-year-old ANC official Oscar
Mpetha, being pushed in a wheel
chair. He was the country's oldest
political prisoner before his re
"ANC, ANC!" shouted the
crowd, many dressed in the move
ment's green, black and gold
colors.
Another roar came when pro
minent activist Murphy Morobe
read a letter of greeting from
Oliver Tambo, the exiled president
of the ANC, who may not legally
be quoted in South Africa.

"This is a joyful day for all of
us," said the message. "We meet
to celebrate a victory that belongs
to all the people of our country."
Tambo directed part of his re
marks at South African whites
who seek to maintain apartheid,
which denies the nation's 28 mil
lion blacks a voice in national af
fairs. The 5 million whites control
the economy and maintain sepa
rate schools, districts and health
services.
"They are part of our heritage,"
Tambo's message said. "In the
end, they too must learn to cele
brate freedom and not oppres
sion."
If the government tries to per
petuate minority rule, said
Tambo, blacks will win their
stuggle through confrontation
and de Klerk "will disappear
forever in the dim mists of his
tory."
Morobe, who was seven years
old when Sisulu went to prison,
told the crowd: "When our com
rades went to jail, they left us a
candle. ... It has turned into a
wildfire that must extinguish and
smother apartheid forever."
In addition to the seven ANC
leaders freed Oct. 15, the rally
also honored Govan Mbeki, re
leased from prison in November
1987. Sisulu, Mbeki and four of
the other men were sentenced to
life imprisonment at a 1964
treason trial along with Nelson
Mandela, the ANC's best-known
leader, who remains jailed.
