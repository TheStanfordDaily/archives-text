## free to leave Warsaw Pact, Soviet officials say 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - The Kremlin
would not object if Hungary chose to
leave the Warsaw Pact or East Germany
chose to reunite with West Germany, So
viet officials said yesterday.
A senior Bush administration official
expressed surprise at the comments, by
Soviet party spokesman Nikolai Shishlin
and Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennadi
Gerasimov. Previously, Soviet and Hun
garian officials have stressed that Hun
gary would stay in the Kremlin-led War
saw Pact military alliance.

The Soviet statements followed a dec
laration by President Mikhail Gorbachev
last week his nation had no moral right
to interfere with changes underway in
the Soviet bloc nations of Eastern Eu
rope.
Gorbachev also declared a willingness
to dissolve the Warsaw Pact if the West
disbands the North Atlantic Treaty Or
ganization, a step the Hush administra
tion has rejected as an effort to cut U.S.
influence in Europe.
Shishlin, appearing on the AB£-TV

program "This Week With David
Brinkley," was asked whether the Soviet
Union would object if Hungary decided
to leave the Warsaw Pact.
"We respect the Hungarian choice,
anyhow. We are not afraid of these
changes," said Shishlin.
Asked whether Hungary was "free to
leave the Warsaw Pact," Shishlin replied:
"Surely. But you know that Hungarian
officials declared that they are ready to
be. in the Warsaw Pact, until now."
I*i • 1956, a declaration by Hungarian

leader Imre Nagy that his nation would
quit the alliance prompted Soviet military
intervention. In recent months, reform
leaders elected to power in Hungary and
Poland have declared their intention to
remain in the Soviet alliance.
Shishlin also appeared to leave the door
open to reunification of West and East
Germany, which have been divided since
World War 11. The U.S. and West German
governments historically have favored
unification.
In light of the turmoil in East Ger

many, Shishlin said: "Nobody can predict
what will happen. And I am sure that
this situation should be changed and it
will be changed."
"How will it be changed?," Shishlin
was asked.
"By the right of choice," he replied.
"Everything depends on the Germans.
But it is necessary to understand our
interests, not to destabilize the situation
in Europe," he said. "Let us wait a little
bit, and I think w« will new sit
