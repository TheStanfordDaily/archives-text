# Israel denies technology transfer

### 
JERUSALEM (AP) - Defense
Minister Yitzhak Rabin told the
Cabinet yesterday that Israel did
not give South Africa any military
technology developed or funded by
the United States.
The denial came a day after
President Bush said transfers of
forbidden technology are "taboo"
and that "it would not enhance
relations" if Israel defied the
United States to help South Africa
develop a nuclear-capable inter
mediate-range missile.
NBC News reported last week
that Israel had provided Pretoria
with know-how from Israel's can
celed Lavi jet plane program,
which was financed by the United
States.
Rabin was quoted by other
Cabinet ministers as saying Israel
did not sell any U.S. technology
or any technology developed with
the help of American funds. The
Cabinet also issued a separate
statement of denial.
Rabin, Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir and Foreign Minister
Moshe Arens met for an hour yes
terday to discuss reports on
Israeli-South African military
links and troubled relations with
Washington, Israel radio said.

'We explained
many times ...
these all are base
less lies.'
â€” Yitzhak Shamir

"The defense establishment did
not transfer from Israel to any
other country American technol
ogies or systems that include
American components without
permission by the U.S. authori
ties," the Cabinet statement said.
"All allegations in the NBC
report that the Lavi technologies
or American Lavi technologies
were transferred allegedly to
South Africa, are baseless," said
the statement, read to reporters
by Cabinet Secretary Elyakim
Rubinstein.
Israel scrapped the Lavi project
in the summer of 1987. Later that
year, South Africa reportedly
launched a campaign to attract
hundreds of Israeli engineers who

worked on the Lavi before losing
their jobs. Some Israeli-developed
technology for the plane is offi
cially for sale.
Shamir said the allegations
were "baseless lies" and said the
Israeli public was united in its
opposition to South Africa's gov
ernment, which is led by the white
minority and denies the black
majority a voice in national af
fairs.
"We have been the subject of
such recriminations many times,
and we explained many times to
the American Congress and the
American administration that
these all are baseless lies," he said
on Israel radio.
Israeli officials viewed the
reports that Israel helped South
Africa build a long-range missile
in exchange for supplies of
uranium as an attempt to pres
sure Shamir into accepting U.S.
proposals for negotiations with
Palestinians.
Baker, following a plan by Pres
ident Hosni Mubarak of Egypt,
has proposed a framework for get
ting representatives of Israel and
the Palestinians to the table to
discuss Israeli-offered elections in
the occupied territories.
