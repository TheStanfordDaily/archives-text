Socialists lose in Spain
MADRID, Spain (AP) — The Socialist Party
suffered unexpected setbacks in yesterday's gen
eral elections and official but incomplete results
indicated it would lose its parliamentary majority.
Deputy Prime Minister Alfonso Guerra said
that with 85.74 percent of the vote counted, the
Socialists had 40.02 percent for 172 of the 350
seats in the Cortes, the lower house of Parliament.
They need 176 seats for a majority.
The party won 184 seats in the 1986 elections.
Guerra said that because of Spain's propor
tional representation system based on final party
results in each of the country's 52 electoral dis
tricts, there still was a possibility the party could
win up to 177 seats.
He said the largest opposition group, the con
servative Popular Party, appeared to have won
25.61 percent of the vote for 109 seats, four more
than it won three years ago.
Prime Minister Felipe Gonzales has said he
would be prepared to form a coalition government
but did not indicate with which parties.
Guerra told a news conference he considered
the results a victory for the Socialists even though
"it's a 4 percent loss for the party from the 1986
elections. This can be explained by the logical
wear and tear of governing."
Drug runner extradited to U.S.
TULSA, Okla. (AP) — The man accused of
being the Medellin cocaine cartel's master smug
gler was handed over to U.S. narcotics agents
before dawn yesterday at a Bogota, Colombia,
airport, then flown here to face drug charges,
authorities said.
Jose Abello Silva was the fifth and most im
portant drug trafficking suspect extradited from

Colombia to the United States since Colombian
government began a drug crackdown 10 weeks
ago. Eight more Colombian drug trafficking
suspects are being held for extradition.
Abello arrived in Tulsa at 12:15 p.m. CST, and
was taken under heavy guard to the federal court
house, where he was arraigned before a federal
judge, said U.S. Attorney Tony Graham.
Abello pleaded innocent to charges of conspiracy
and distribution of cocaine, Graham said. There
was no discussion of bond.
Graham, who would not give the name of the
judge for security reasons, said Abello would
remain in the custody of the U.S. Marshals Serv
ice pending another hearing Thursday.
"The arrest and extradition of Abello Silva
represent a significant step in the federal anti
drug offensive because the indictment alleges that
he had agreed to be the source of cocaine in
Colombia that was supplied to the trafficking
ring," acting Marshals Service Director John J.
Twomey said in a statement released in Wash
ington.
Algerian quakes kill 19 people
ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) — Two earthquakes

coast 60 miles west of the capital, the ministry
said in a statement issued early today.
The French government announced in Paris
that it was offering emergency aid to Algeria, a
former French colonv.
