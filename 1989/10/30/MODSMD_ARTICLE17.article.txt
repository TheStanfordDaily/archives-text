# Happy 20th, AASA
## 
### 
HAPPY 20th anniversary to
the Asian American Stu
dents Association.
The entire campus should join
AASA in celebrating 20 years of
struggle, progress and important
contributions to the Stanford com
munity.
Over the past two decades,
Asian-Americans have become an
increasingly large proportion of the
campus population and are cur
rently the largest ethnic minority
population at Stanford.
With their expanding numbers
has come increased diversity and
a host of new programs, events and
institutions which have expanded
the cultural frontiers of our
campus.
AASA has played a vital and im
portant role in uniting Asian stu
dents from many different back
grounds and capably representing
their interests to the community
as a whole.

The events planned for the
celebration are educational, social
and cultural. Topics to be ad
dressed range from the role of
Asian-American women in the art
world to the rise in anti-Asian vi
olence.
On Thursday, Okada Resident
Fellow Michael Chang will give an
important talk addressing common
misperceptions about Asians as all
upwardly mobile tecfries.
As Asians have become a per
manent part of the fabric of our
institution, there have been ten
sions, misunderstandings and
growing pains. Many people do not
understand or fully appreciate the
major role and significant contri
butions of AASA.
AASA's 20th anniversary
celebration is an excellent oppor
tunity to increase our common un
derstanding of the Asian-American
experience at Stanford and to offer
our sincere congratulations.
