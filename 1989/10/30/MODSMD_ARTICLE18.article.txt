AIDS Awareness Week shows how AIDS affects us all

WEDNESDAY NIGHT in the
meeting of my residence, Otero
house, I called attention to the
upcoming events of AIDS Awareness
Week to my dormmates. Afterwards, a
friend asked me why I was so con
cerned and moreover why he should be
concerned.
After all, since we were both well
informed about safer sex prevention of
the HIV infection and since we were
both in "temporary abstinence," my
friend felt both he and I were unaf
fected by AIDS and therefore were in
no need of further education regarding
AIDS.
Unfortunately, as 1 informed my
friend, AIDS does affect my life — and
AIDS affects his life, too.

Last summer, the American College
Health Association and the Centers for
Disease Control released the results of
a nationwide study of the rate of
infection with HIV, which causes
AIDS, among college and university
students.
The study found that one out of
every 500 blood samples tested was
infected with HIV
Given an incubation period of the
HIV virus now averaging about 10
years, the number of diagnoses of
AIDS will continue to rise in young
adults of our age group. These are
people who will affect our lives socially
economically and perhaps even psyc
hologically.
The idea that "education can protect

the rest of us" is misleading. Though
we may know how to protect ourselves
from the virus, we cannot protect
ourselves from our inabilities to cope
with death, chronic illness and
sexuality.
Our elders have had great difficulty
in dealing with these issues, and the
results of their initial denials and later
deliberations were delayed responses to
the pandemic. Their inaction cost lives.
Faced with AIDS, our generation must
not repeat our elders' mistake.
This is the time in our life when we
must learn ways to communicate our
feelings about death, chronic illness
and sexuality. Only by taking this first
step can we formulate effective social,
economical and political policies regard
ing AIDS in the "real world."

Only by taking action now can we be
the compassionate human beings so
many of us aspire to be.
The students and staff of this Uni
versity are fortunate this week, be
cause we have the opportunity to learn
about much more than just the preven
tion of AIDS.
We have the opportunity to learn
about how AIDS has affected other
people's lives and how they have effec
tively coped with it. And we have the
opportunity to learn about how AIDS
will undoubtedly affect our lives and
how we can effectively cope with it.
This campus is not immune to
AIDS. Neither is my friend. Neither
am I.
