# Black letter groups give members support, not secluded lives
## 
### 
I write in response to Andrew
Kramer's Oct. 26 letter about the
"confrontational overtones expressed"
in The Daily's article on black letter
organizations.
I believe Kramer groped too far into
the comments made by those inter
viewed in the article. The comment
about community service had little to
do with hostile and irrelevant
relativism and more to do with the
fact that, at Stanford, African-
American Fraternal and Sororital Asso
ciation (AAFSA) members tend to
spend a greater percentage of their
meager budgets on community service
activities than other Greek organiza
tions.
Of course no one can judge how
much is enough or how little is shame

ful; each organization's good intentions
and exemplary actions make the true
difference.
John Meigs, president of Kappa Al
pha Psi fraternity, did not imply that
"white" fraternal members particularly
abuse alcohol. Meigs pointed out the
simple fact that AAFSA members' par
ties rarely include alcohol.
Thus we naturally tend to avoid
alcohol-related incidents. AAFSA mem
bers' treasuries greatly depend upon
the cover charge at our parties and
can ill afford to have alcohol-related
incidents shut them down.
Of course the question of racial
membership always comes up. Our
organizations were founded in the
early 1900s to provide black people the
opportunity to experience the fraternal
brotherhood and the sororital sister
hood denied them in the then exclu
sively white Greek organizations.
Those chapters at the black colleges
of course did not have this problem.
Now that racial exclusivity at predomi
nantly white institutions is less of a
problem, our organizations still main

tain our founding goals to provide sup
port for the African-American commu
nity in whatever form needed.
No one can deny the need for such
support nor should anyone question
why African-Americans would like to
bond together to help the struggling
communities that raised us.
We bond not to seclude ourselves
from any mainstream, but we realize
that if we do not aid our own commu
nities few others will. I think the re
sulting differences between the "white"
and "black" systems are apparent.
But just as we rarely lament the
individuality of specific letter organiza
tions, we should not lament the exist
ing cultural differences.
In a pluralistic society our systems
satisfy particular needs. A person
should feel free to pursue his or her
needs as he or she deems fit.
I for one do not like to prejudge and
second-guess anyone's intentions. As
human beings we all have plenty of
common ground to celebrate on.
