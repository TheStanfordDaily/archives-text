# Homeless housed
## Refugee draw places 142 students 
### Jamie Dycus Staff writer 
After nearly two weeks out in
the cold, many of the students
displaced by the Oct. 17 earth
quake returned to their homes
over the weekend.
Of the 217 students whose res
idences were closed for the quar
ter or indefinitely, 169 partic
ipated in a housing lottery Wed
nesday. A meeting was held
Thursday night to assign new
housing, and about 142 students
accepted assignments.
Students at the meeting were
"wonderfully cooperative and un
derstanding," according to Alice
Supton, associate dean of Student
Affairs. Students were permitted
to move into their new residences
Saturday.
New housing was created in
some dorms by converting study
rooms and guest rooms, and by
"up-rating," or adding students to
already inhabited rooms. Con
verted rooms were the most
popular, according to Bill Georges,
assistant director of the Housing
Center. Among up-rated spaces,
the refugees preferred those in
co-ops and Roble Hall.

Up-rated spaces were also of
fered in Lagunita Court, other
Row houses, Florence Moore and
Manzanita Park. Despite rumors
that most of the displaced stu
dents would get Manzanita
housing, only three were assigned
to the trailers.
Some students whose rooms
were up-rated were "understan
dably concerned" about having a
new roommate, Georges said.
These students had three options,
he said: to accept a randomly cho
sen displaced student, to persuade
a friend to move into their room
and give up his or her own room,
or to be released from their
housing agreement.
No one asked to be released
from the agreement, Georges said.
And there were no major griev
ances with the solutions, Supton
added. "People are recognizing
the need to pull together," she
said.
Reversing the policy it previ
ously announced, the University
has decided to pay rent rebates to
students who were displaced for
more than one night as a result
of the earthquake, according to
Georges. The rebates will con
stitute "a considerable amount of
money," he said.
Students who did not accept
new University housing have
found various alternatives. A

group of 10 former Columbae
House residents have leased a
house in Menlo Park. "Hopefully
we can retain some sense of the
community we had before," says
Rob Sondik, one of the group.
Living with them is Dante, the
Columbae house cat.
About 15 members of the Delta
Tau Delta fraternity have rented
units in the Stanford Villa apart
ment complex, said Chris Meyn,

the Delta Tau Delta president.
Meyn himself, like several other
Delts, has found a home at thu
Theta Delta Chi house.
In conducting the lottery, the
Housing Center offered special
treatment to students who were
displaced twice â€” once last Tues
day, and once two years ago when
Roble was closed.
These students were given pri
ority in the lottery.
