## 
### 
The Department of Engineering-
Economic Systems extends a very
grateful thank you to all EES students
who helped "pick up the department"
after the quake.
Calls were placed early Thursday
morning, Oct. 19, for help and the
response was tremendous. With their
help, the department in Terman Engi
neering Center was cleaned up by noon
that day.
Each faculty and staff office had a
mess to be picked up. Students came
to our rescue to help right bookshelves
and filing cabinets, stack books and
papers, pick things off the floors,
vacuum debris and pick up broken
glass.
ESS students — you're the best!!!
