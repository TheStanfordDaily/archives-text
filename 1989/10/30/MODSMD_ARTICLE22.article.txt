## Black Studies: the struggle 
### 
"American universities and colleges,
like many institutions of this society, have
not yet contributed their share to solving
the problems of Black communities. They
have not penetrated with academic objec
tivity, intensity and depth the nebulous
aspects of the Black struggle for freedom
.. . . Traditional forms of education do
not seem to have given specific
'departmental' assignment to the study
of the Black Experience."
— Excerpt from a 46-page proposal
that the Black Student Union submitted
to the Provost in 1971, calling for the
creation of a Black Studies Institute.
THIS YEAR marks the 20th anni
versary of the Undergraduate Pro
gram in African and Afro-
American Studies (AAAS). The program
was initiated by the BSU.
Motivated to act by the void of courses
relevant to their experiences in the un
dergraduate curriculum, frustrated by
the glacial pace of the administration's
response to their calls and angered by
the assassination of Dr. Martin L. King,
Jr., 70 members of the BSU in 1968
walked onto the stage at Memorial Au
ditorium and took the microphone from
the Provost, Richard Lyman, to issue a
list of 10 immediate demands for com
bating racism.
Among the demands articulated were
the urgent need for more black faculty
members and the development of a de
partment in Black Studies. They recog
nized that knowledge of African-
American history and culture was fun
damental to the empowerment and liber
ation of black people.

Most African-American students still
hold the same desire to learn about their
people. We realize that our distinct his
tory in the United States — one of
slavery, oppression, hope and empower
ment — must be incorporated into the
curriculum if the true history of the
United States is to be told.
Although many of the courses offered
in the program are among the most
popular in the University, AAAS is woe
fully underfunded and disregarded by the
University.
There is little financial support for the
program to sustain itself at a basic level
or to attract a scholar to take over the
permanent chair, a seat vacated in frus
tration by Prof. Kennell Jackson last
spring.
There are too few professors here to
teach enough courses that delve into the
histories, cultures and contributions of
Africans of the Diaspora (the United
States, the Carribean and Africa).
As I have mentioned before, I am an
African and Afro-American Studies
Every class that I have taken in
the program thus far has had without
fail two to three times as many students
as the professor originally anticipated.
There is only one professor of African-
American history, literature and psychol
ogy and no professor of African-American
political sciences, sociology, art or reli
gion.
For a university of such high caliber
as Stanford that professes such a grand
commitment to multiculturalism not to
have a developed program in Black
Studies at least up to par with that of
lesser-known schools sends the message

loud and clear to African-American stu
dents: your history, culture and contri
butions to this society are not that
important to us.
This lack of support makes me wonder
where Stanford's real commitment is to
African-American people and multicul
turalism.
If we truly desire a community that
respects and appreciates all people,
shouldn't the University educate all the
students about African-American his
tory?
For $21,000 per year, don't you think
you should understand slavery, the
Reconstruction and the manner in which
African land labor created white
American wealth?
As AAAS moves into the 19905, it is
time for all who are concerned about its
future to examine ways in which the
program can be strengthened. A commit
tee is making strides in bolstering the
major requirements.
As one of its main priorities this year,
the BSU rededicated itself to the struggle
for a relevant education that will not
only benefit black students, but all stu
dents who wish to understand the history
and contemporary reality of our society.
