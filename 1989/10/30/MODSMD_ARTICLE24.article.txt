## Memories of happy times at Phi Psi House have not crumbled 
### 
THE PAINT is peeling off and
what paint there is is woefully
grimy, but the lines of the house
are beautiful, magnificent.
This is Phi Psi House, and I have
30 minutes to scramble together my
belongings and get out.
This is not another viewpoint about
the earthquake and "give us a break
on assignments." I want to tell you
about what it was like to live in Phi
Psi.
Our rooms were large, by far more
spacious than anything I've seen in the
big dorms.
We had hardwood floors and high
ceilings. There were fireplaces in one
third of the rooms and yes, many of
them did work.

Maybe it was the housa itself with
its ample room and geneious lawn, but
something about Phi Psi grew on you.
The house was standing before the
University was built and it was a
gracious home to generations of stu
dents.
As a first-year graduate student, I
was a bit apprehensive about what it
would be like to live in a house with
37 undergraduates and only three
graduate students. I peedn't have
worried. They took care of me.
Phi Psi people became my orienta
tion to Stanford. I didn't even go to
any of the formal orientation activities.
Phi Psi people took me everywhere and
explained everything.
Most of what little social life I could

afford became Phi Psi. We lived, ate,
worked and cleaned up after ourselves
together. Cooking was a social occasion
And boy, did we cook. Once a week
we each had to take a turn on the
cook or clean-up dinner crew. We
prepared our own meals and the food
was 10 times better than University
Food Services' food.
And then you all know what hap
pened. I've had to watch people I care
about grow hollow-eyed and pale as
academic pressures mount and they
can't even get a deep night's sleep.
I have lost weight since the earth
quake, and I have trouble remember
ing where my bicycle is parked every
time I come out of a building. I am
not traumatized by the damn earth-

quake. I am traumatized by University
housing.
Multiply these trauma symptoms by
several hundred and you begin to have
an idea about what we (skid) Row
people are going through.
I am still not sorry that I didn't go
to Rains or Escondido. That first three
and a half weeks at Stanford in Phi
Psi will be something I'll treasure
forever.
Now I hear the University might
tear down some of the other damaged
buildings. They can do that; it's their
property. But they don't know Phi Psi
and the others like we do.
If they think they are only hurting
40 people per house, they're wrong.
They are hurting every person who

might have had a chance to live in a
co-operative.
People ask me, "Wasn't it dirty in
there with students doing the clean
ing?"
No, it was not dirty. We cleaned. We
loved our house. We just needed a
paint job on the outside. But Phi Psi
is screened on all sides by trees, so it
didn't present an eye-sore from the
street â€” so we never got it.
If Phi Psi opens again next year I
would be the first person at the door,
except there will be 10 people right
beside me. And we will do our own
paint job.
