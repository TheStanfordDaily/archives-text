Put aside Stephen King and
other long-winded gore mer
chants this Halloween and pick
up a new paperback copy of
The Oxford Hook of English
Ghost Stories.
The collection, compiled by
Michael Cox and R. A. Gilbert,
covers over 150 years of the
best of the supernatural genre.
The stories

range from the
macabre to the
merely mur-
derous, and in-
elude classics
such as Sir
Walter Scott's
"The Tape-
stried Cham-
ber," WW.

Jacobs' "The Monkey's Paw"
and H.G. Wells' "The Red
Room."
Other less-known pieces —
such as W. Somerset Maug
ham's "Taipan," a story about
an English colonial business
man on the China coast who
belatedly discovers his own
grave is being dug for him, and
V.S. Pritchett's "Don Juan," in
which the legendary lover
warms up the dead — are
equally chilling fare for a
candlelit night's reading.
Fabricating Lives: Explora
tions in American Autobiogra
phy is a new book by Herbert
Leibowitz that attempts to
show readers how to hear what
authors are not saying when
they write their memoirs.
"Fabricating Lives," pub
lished by Alfred A. Knopf, ex
amines the self-described lives
of eight American men and

women, and covers over two
hundred years of history and
culture in the process.
Leibowitz, who is editor and
publisher of "Parnassus:
Poetry in Review" and is a pro
fessor of English at the City
University of New York Grad
uate Center, looks closely and
with irony at the literary voices

and "stylistic
subterfuges"-
use to describe
their works,
art and selves.
In his first
essay, Leibo
witz uses his
close reading
techniques to
show how Ben-

jamin Franklin's personal and
writing style — which mixed
satire with a growing sense of
restraint — was representative
of his larger revolt against both
paternal and colonial authority.
Leibowitz also suggests that
textual and personal inconsis
tencies, such as those between
Poor Richard's civic morality
and Franklin's personal con
duct, show the discrepancies
between the author's public and
private lives, as well as his at
tempts to actively define both.
Leibowitz uses similar tech
niques to analyze the style and
autobiographical voices of
Gertrude Stein, William Carlos
Williams, Louis Sullivan, Rich
ard Wright, Jane Addams and
Edward Dahlberg.
Taken alone, these essays
each offer a new and dissected
view of the writer through his
or her autobiography.
