The most memorable image of the 1983 NCAA
national championship basketball game is of victo
rious North Carolina State Coach Jim Valvano
jubilantly dashing around the court looking to hug
someone he seemingly never found.
But in his book "Personal Fouls," Peter Golenbock
uncovers the ugly flipside of Valvano's N.C. State
program and poses important, unanswered ques
tions about ethics and false promises in college
athletics.
Golenbock unleashes a bitter indictment of Val
vano's program at N.C. State, citing corruption of
values, shattered dreams, deceitful recruiting, rac
ism, overt drug-dealing, stealing and general
crookedness.
His accusations tarnish Valvano's 1983 champi
onship and raise disturbing questions about the
priorities and current direction of college athletics.
In fact, the book has raised such a firestorm of
controversy that it has been the object of a long
legal battle. When the book jacket and controversial
excerpts were first released to the press, Valvano
and N.C. State threatened libel suits against the
publisher. Release of the book was delayed, but not
prevented.
Golenbock, who interviewed players from Val
vano's 1986-87 N.C. State team to research the
book, analyzes the relationships between athletics,
academics, players and coaches in the big-money
world of college basketball.
Although the basketball team was winning cham
pionships, playing on national television and reaping
huge profits for Valvano and the University's ath
letic department, Golenbock claims players usually
received "no education, no degree, no skills, no
money, no career and no hope."
He asserts that because of the intense pressure
to win championships, the term "student-athlete"
has become a mockery. College athletics has become
an unrestricted beast eating away at university eth
ics, not just at N.C. State, but across the nation.
To support this he cites the fact that private

'Here's what too many athletes learn from their
college education: the Art of the Big Con 101.
The coach makes a million or so for him
self. The college makes millions for its
athletic treasury, plus gets millions
of dollars of free publicity. And what
does the player end up with many
times? No education, no degree, no
skills, no money, no pro career and ,
no hope.' /

donations to the athletic department at N.C. State
grew 30 percent — from $9.4 million to $12.27
million — following their NCAA basketball cham
pionship.
Golenbock even suggests that Valvano has profited
personally from his coaching position while players
have been exploited by the system.
For one, Valvano, who was promoted to athletic
director at N.C. State because of his success with
the basketball team, is paid by Nike and other
sporting goods companies so that his team will wear
their brands. Valvano also hosts his own television
show and sponsors many products.
Meanwhile, of the 14 basketball players on the
1986-87 N.C. State team, only one, Vinny del Negro,
has graduated.
In light of the harshness of Golenbock's charges,
criticism of "Personal Fouls" should not be aimed
at his conclusions, but rather at his questionable
sources and research methods.
Golenbock talked to a number of Wolfpack players
and students, many under conditions of anonymity,
but his primary sources were team manager John
Simonds and Teviin Binns, a flashy scoring forward
from the Bronx.
Both Simonds and Binns had an axe to grind
with Valvano and their biased viewpoints shine
through Golenbock's analysis of the team.
Binns was a highly-recruited high school player

who said Valvano promised him
a starting spot at N.C. State, per
suading him to sign a letter of
intent.
But, like many high school stars
who are promised the moon dur
ing recruiting, when he got to
State he had to share his playing
time with a team full of superb
athletes.
Eventually, he stopped talking
to Valvano and lost all hope when
Valvano didn't show up for a rec
onciliation meeting they had
scheduled — Valvano was out
recruiting more high school stars.
Binns played two years, did not
graduate and was later cut from
the NBA and the Jersey Shore
Bucks in the United States Bas
ketball League.
Said a bitter Binns, "He's going
to fall one day, 'cause bad things
always keep going. One day V's
going to fall. One by one he's
destroying people. Last year he
brought in Sean Green. He left,
too. The team went to Hawaii,

and he ain't played but two
minutes out of the whole tourna
ment, and he left and went to
lona. V lied to him, too, about
playing time."
Simonds, who as team manager
worked closely with Valvano, is
also the primary source for most
of the tattletaling.
When Simonds wasn't granted
a scholarship that he says he was
promised, he was nearly kicked
out of school for failing classes,
and helped teammate Walker
Lambiotte transfer away from
N.C. State, Valvano and Simonds
separated on hostile terms.
Simonds transferred to Florida
State before helping Golenbock
with the book, and claims in "Per
sonal Fouls" that N.C. State as
sistant coaches physically threat
ened him when they learned of
his contributions to the book.
Though interesting at first, the
narrative of the team's misadven
tures drags toward the end, espe
cially when Simonds, Binns and
the other players begin complain
ing about lack of playing time.
In many instances Golenbock
repeats rumors of player misdeeds

with citations such as "word
around campus was," or
"everyone on the team knew."
Neither Valvano nor the coach
ing staff contributed to the book,
and Golenbock reports that most
students and players were afraid
to tell him the truth.
Golenbock approaches his anal
ysis of Valvano like that of a dis
gruntled player who is getting
splinters on a hard wooden bench.
While many of his conclusions
about college athletics are insight
ful, his criticisms of Valvano must
be taken in context.
It is unfair of Golenbock to
blame Valvano for all the wrongs
of big-money athletics at N.C.
State, where he was given free
rein by Chancellor Bruce Poulton,
who allowed him to operate out
side the academic structure.
When Valvano and other big
time coaches have finished run
ning around the court looking for
someone to congratulate, maybe
they should sit down and put bas
ketball in its proper perspective.
