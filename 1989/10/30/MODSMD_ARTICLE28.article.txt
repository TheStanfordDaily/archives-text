The most memorable image of the 1983 NCAA
national championship basketball game is of victo
rious North Carolina State Coach Jim Valvano
jubilantly dashing around the court looking to hug
someone he seemingly never found.
But in his book "Personal Fouls," Peter Golenbock
uncovers the ugly flipside of Valvano's N.C. State
program and poses important, unanswered ques
tions about ethics and false promises in college
athletics.
Golenbock unleashes a bitter indictment of Val
vano's program at N.C. State, citing corruption of
values, shattered dreams, deceitful recruiting, rac
ism, overt drug-dealing, stealing and general
crookedness.
His accusations tarnish Valvano's 1983 champi
onship and raise disturbing questions about the
priorities and current direction of college athletics.
In fact, the book has raised such a firestorm of
controversy that it has been the object of a long
legal battle. When the book jacket and controversial
excerpts were first released to the press, Valvano
and N.C. State threatened libel suits against the
publisher. Release of the book was delayed, but not
prevented.
Golenbock, who interviewed players from Val
vano's 1986-87 N.C. State team to research the
book, analyzes the relationships between athletics,
academics, players and coaches in the big-money
world of college basketball.
Although the basketball team was winning cham
pionships, playing on national television and reaping
huge profits for Valvano and the University's ath
letic department, Golenbock claims players usually
received "no education, no degree, no skills, no
money, no career and no hope."
He asserts that because of the intense pressure
to win championships, the term "student-athlete"
has become a mockery. College athletics has become
an unrestricted beast eating away at university eth
ics, not just at N.C. State, but across the nation.
To support this he cites the fact that private

'Here's what too many athletes learn from their
college education: the Art of the Big Con 101.
The coach makes a million or so for him
self. The college makes millions for its
athletic treasury, plus gets millions
of dollars of free publicity. And what
does the player end up with many
times? No education, no degree, no
skills, no money, no pro career and ,
no hope.' /

donations to the athletic department at N.C. State
grew 30 percent — from $9.4 million to $12.27
million — following their NCAA basketball cham
pionship.
Golenbock even suggests that Valvano has profited
personally from his coaching position while players
have been exploited by the system.
For one, Valvano, who was promoted to athletic
director at N.C. State because of his success with
the basketball team, is paid by Nike and other
sporting goods companies so that his team will wear
their brands. Valvano also hosts his own television
show and sponsors many products.
Meanwhile, of the 14 basketball players on the
1986-87 N.C. State team, only one, Vinny del Negro,
has graduated.
In light of the harshness of Golenbock's charges,
criticism of "Personal Fouls" should not be aimed
at his conclusions, but rather at his questionable
sources and research methods.
Golenbock talked to a number of Wolfpack players
and students, many under conditions of anonymity,
but his primary sources were team manager John
Simonds and Teviin Binns, a flashy scoring forward
from the Bronx.
Both Simonds and Binns had an axe to grind
with Valvano and their biased viewpoints shine
through Golenbock's analysis of the team.
Binns was a highly-recruited high school player
