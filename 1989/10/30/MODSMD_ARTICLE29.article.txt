### Chris Crader Editorial staff 
LOS ANGELES — After suf
fering heartbreaking losses last
week, both Stanford and USC
could be expected to be a little
flat in their game Saturday. Both
offenses fit the bill, but the Trojan
defense didn't and the result was
a 19-0 USC victory.
The Trojans ran their record to
6-2 overall, 4-0 in the Pacific 10
Conference, and have won 17

The Trojan defense held Stan

negative six yards on the ground.
The yards lost on the ground came
mostly from seven USC sacks, in
cluding three by Junior Seau.

backer, lined up everywhere from
defensive tackle to peanut vendor
in an effort to keep the Cardinal

offensive line on their toes. His
moving around wasn't what hurt
Stanford according to the players,
however, but it was what USC did.
According to left guard Chuck
Gillingham, in their first seven
games the Trojans ran most of
their defensive slants and stunts
to the side where Seau played but
didn't do that Saturday.
"We were predicating some
things on offense on where he
lined up," Gillingham said. "In
the first half they were running
away from him, doing some things
they hadn't done before."
