## Relentless Trojans crush scoreless Cardinal Stanford running attack impotent against USC 
### Chris Crader Editorial staff 
LOS ANGELES — After suf
fering heartbreaking losses last
week, both Stanford and USC
could be expected to be a little
flat in their game Saturday. Both
offenses fit the bill, but the Trojan
defense didn't and the result was
a 19-0 USC victory.
The Trojans ran their record to
6-2 overall, 4-0 in the Pacific 10
Conference, and have won 17
straight Pac-10 games. The Car
dinal is 1-7 overall, 1-4 in league
play.
"I think we played a really fine
USC team," Stanford Coach
Denny Green said. "I think

they're the best (defensive team)
in the country, there's no doubt
about it."
The Trojan defense held Stan
ford to only nine first downs and
negative six yards on the ground.
The yards lost on the ground came
mostly from seven USC sacks, in
cluding three by Junior Seau.
Seau, listed as an outside line
backer, lined up everywhere from
defensive tackle to peanut vendor
in an effort to keep the Cardinal

offensive line on their toes. His
moving around wasn't what hurt
Stanford according to the players,
however, but it was what USC did.
According to left guard Chuck
Gillingham, in their first seven
games the Trojans ran most of
their defensive slants and stunts
to the side where Seau played but
didn't do that Saturday.
"We were predicating some
things on offense on where he
lined up," Gillingham said. "In
the first half they were running
away from him, doing some things
they hadn't done before."
Furthermore, USC has perhaps
the most talented defense in the

nation. "They were changing up a lot
. . . but we were prepared for that,"
quarterback Steve Smith said. "They're
good players and that's why they had
a good pass rush, not because of
schemes."
Because of this defense, Stanford had
a total of 44 yards of offense and three
first downs in the first half. Excluding
a meaningless 11-yard run by Smith on
the last play of the half, the numbers
were two first downs, 45 yards of pass
ing and negative 12 yards of rushing.
Stanford's defense kept the Cardinal
in the game in the first half, however,
holding the Trojan offense somewhat at
bay. USC mounted two drives in the
first quarter, but the Cardinal defense
stiffened both times and the result was
two missed field goals by Quin
Rodriguez. Rodriguez was a perfect six
of-six coming into the game.

The Cardinal defense just wore out
near the end of the game, though. The
Trojans had 41 minutes, 57 seconds of
time of possession and converted on 16
of 23 third-down plays. Stanford was
one of 10 on third down.
"Defensively we fought -hard," Green
said. "We just didn't get off some
blocks. . . . We thought our third-down
defense would be our strength but it's
not. . . . That's something we need to
work on."
Rodriguez finally made a field goal,
a 28-yarder, early in the second quarter
and after Stanford was forced to punt,
USC drove again. The Trojans went 94
yards on 11 plays, capped by a nine-yard
touchdown run by tailback Ricky Er
vins.
Then the Cardinal got going, thanks
to a good kickoff return by Kevin Scott.
Stanford moved to the Trojan 28, but
John Hopkins missed a 45-yard field
goal.
USC started the second half by
driving to the Cardinal five. On first
down, however, strong safety Rob

Englehardt stopped Ervins for a one
yard loss. Trojans quarterback Todd
Marinovich fumbled the next snap, one
of three fumbled snaps on the day, and
recovered for a two-yard loss. After
Stanford held on third down, Rodriguez
made it 13-10.
Smith completed a pass to Ed McCaf
frey for 43 yards later in the quarter,
and on the next play Smith hit McCaf
frey for nine more. But faced with
second-and-one on the Trojan eight,
Stanford stalled. Seau hit fullback Tom
Vardell for a one-yard loss and Smith
threw incomplete on both third and
fourth downs to come up empty.
USC then marched the length of the
field, scoring on a five-yard run by full
back Leroy Holt. The Trojans went for
two but Marinovich's pass was inter
cepted by Alan Grant.
Stanford drove to the Trojan 21, but
Seau sacked Smith there on a fourth
and-one play. Instead of running out
the clock with just over three minutes
left, USC Coach Larry Smith dusted
off the trick-play playbook.
