# Fully implemented, CIV has turned 'trend' into 'mandate'
## 
### Alex Hoye Staff writer 
The marches in White Plaza, the
speeches in the Quad and the national
publicity have all subsided. Two academic
years after the great debate was settled
in the Faculty Senate, Cultures, Ideas
and Values has been fully implemented.
The current freshman class is the first
to be a part of the controversial program.
A pilot course, Europe and the Americas,
was offered as a track of the Western
Culture program under CIV guidelines
last year, but this year all tracks reflect
the implemented changes.
What has changed?
Following the approval of CIV, claims

were made that changes in the program
would be both "sweeping" and "only
minor."
Now that the program has begun, the
results of the drawn-out compromise are
much clearer. The new regulations pro
vide that tracks must "include the study
of at least one non-European culture as
well as works by women, minorities and
persons of color."
This legislation resulted from concern
that the Western Culture program was
Eurocentric and ignored important non-
Western contributions to our society.
Professors have been concerned about
these factors since the inception of the
program in the 19705, according to
Thomas Wasow, dean of undergraduate
studies.

He said teachers have been integrating
subject matter written by non-Western,
female and minority authors — like the
Koran and Virginia Woolf — for years.
"What the legislation essentially did," he
said, "was turn a trend into a mandate."
"The changes largely reflect changes
in definition of culture across academic
disciplines," said Renato Rosaldo, a pro
fessor of anthropology who is a founder
and instructor in the new Europe and
the Americas track. Cultures are no
longer seen as self-contained and un
changing, he said.
One of the best results of the new
structure, according to CIV coordinator
and History Prof. Paul S'Oaver, is that it
gives professors greater flexibility in
choosing texts. Now that there is no

longer a core, instructors can create more
cohesive syllabuses.
This is especially helpful in the case
of the more thematic courses like Values,
Technology, Science and Society, he said.
For instance, the VTSS professor is now
free to select Shakespeare's "The
Tempest," which is more relevant to the
track than "King Lear" or "Hamlet."
Most changes have been minor, according
to Rosaldo.
The greatest drawback seems to be
that in order to teach the new material,
some of the traditional texts must be left
out. Already receiving criticism for being
too much of a snrvey course, the Western
Culture program could not possibly add
supplemental texts to the already bulging

syllabus without removal of existing
texts.
"I like the exceptional materials," said
Margarite Solomon, a freshman enrolled
in Europe and the Americas. But she
said she is unhappy that she will not
have the opportunity to study some of
the traditional texts like Homer.
She said she feels it impossible to ex
pand the course to study all the classics
of Western and non-Western culture in
one year. "I just wish it wasn't an either
or question," Solomon said.
Judith Brown, a professor in the his
tory track, concurs, but notes that one
cannot possibly teach every great text in
European history in one year anyway.
One implicit objective of the
CIV program is to present read
ings that reflect the ideas of some
of the Western texts in a non-
Western setting. The new texts
provide a basis for comparison
and contrast with the Western
works that are read, which allows
for greater perspective.
"As you add new texts and put
them next to the texts you already
have in place, I think you are
going to discover that the com
parison will generate a new set of
questions," said Charles Junker
man, assistant dean of undergrad
uate studies.
Many freshmen have not
started or are just beginning the
texts in question, and thus are
not yet strongly opinionated
about the changes made to the
course.

Brad Nieder, a freshman in the
humanities track, said he noticed
the emphasis on feminism and
foreign cultures. "1 don't know if
they taught it before, but if not,
they should have," he said.
Back to school
After the new curriculum was
introduced, another problem
arose. The professors who teach
the courses had not studied the
texts themselves and often did not
know how to present them.
The answer was that 45 of the
60 CIV instructors went back to
school early this fall to update
their knowledge of the materials.
The instructors listened to schol
ars discussing feminist, Afro-
American, and Islamic texts so
that they might more effectively
integrate the texts into their
courses.
Public opinion

'I don't know if they
taught [feminism and
foreign cultures]
before, but if not, they
should have.'

ing the debate over CIV, a great
deal of negative press arose
nationwide. Wasow said the
"surprising" flood of negative
opinion, led by then-Secretary of
Education William Bennett, was
based on "what people imagined
has changed in the program, not
real changes."
He claimed that the two
greatest criticisms in particular
are "simply false." The first is
that the CIV is the result of the
Faculty Senate "caving in" to the
demands of radical black students

on campus. Wasow said CIV was
the result of years of discussion
and intense debate among instruc
tors and the Faculty Senate, not
a compromise with the students.
The second criticism was that
the works of tried-and-true
masters are being replaced by
token works that are inferior.
Wasow said that this claim is sim
ply not true.
The individual teachers choose
the texts and maintain writing
quality when doing so, according
to Wasow. In addition, he said,
the great majority of readings —
like Freud, the Bible and Weber
— have been studied for years.
Signs of a decline in negative
attitudes are evident, according to
Brown. Many alumni have re
quested information on the pro
gram and are generally much
more confident about the change
after being informed by the staff
about what the actual implemen
tation of CIV means, Brown said.

Others are not as confident.
French Prof. Robert Cohn, who
fought for the reinstitution of the
Western Culture core curriculum
in the 19705, compares the move
to the abandonment of the core
in 1968, which he said "flopped."
"This will flop too. It's just going
to take a few years," Cohn said.
He views the change to CIV as
"politicizing, ideologizing educa
tion," and asserts that world op
inion of Stanford education is
being perceived as "trendiness."
Cohn's belief is that students
should acquire a solid background
in the greats of their own culture.
Then they should broaden ont to
the study of foreign cultures in
the following years, he said.
Keith Rabois, Stanford College
Republicans president, agreed,
saying that "The idea that you
can understand foreign cultures
without fully understanding your
own is ludicrous."

The future
It is doubtful that there will be
more major changes in CIV in the
near future. Most say they are
impressed with the ease of the
move from Western Culture to
CIV. "I can't believe how easy the
transition has been," Brown said.
The philosophy track, however,
may well be in its last year, ac
cording to track coordinator John
Perry. "[The instructors] have
been teaching the course about 10
years now and are ready for a
break," Perry said.
The option of replacing instruc
tors is being considered, but it
would be very difficult and the
availablity of interested professors
is uncertain at this point.
The instructors of the new pro
gram seem confident that the
move to CIV was the right thing
to do. "1 think five years from
now we will be really pleased we
did this," Seaver said.
