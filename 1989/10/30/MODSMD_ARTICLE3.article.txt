# Fully implemented, CIV has turned 'trend' into 'mandate'
##

The marches in White Plaza, the
speeches in the Quad and the national
publicity have all subsided. Two academic
years after the great debate was settled
in the Faculty Senate, Cultures, Ideas
and Values has been fully implemented.
The current freshman class is the first
to be a part of the controversial program.
A pilot course, Europe and the Americas,
was offered as a track of the Western
Culture program under CIV guidelines
last year, but this year all tracks reflect
the implemented changes.
What has changed?
Following the approval of CIV, claims

were made that changes in the program
would be both "sweeping" and "only
minor."
Now that the program has begun, the
results of the drawn-out compromise are
much clearer. The new regulations pro
vide that tracks must "include the study
of at least one non-European culture as
well as works by women, minorities and
persons of color."
This legislation resulted from concern
that the Western Culture program was
Eurocentric and ignored important non-
Western contributions to our society.
Professors have been concerned about
these factors since the inception of the
program in the 19705, according to
Thomas Wasow, dean of undergraduate
studies.

He said teachers have been integrating
subject matter written by non-Western,
female and minority authors — like the
Koran and Virginia Woolf — for years.
"What the legislation essentially did," he
said, "was turn a trend into a mandate."
"The changes largely reflect changes
in definition of culture across academic
disciplines," said Renato Rosaldo, a pro
fessor of anthropology who is a founder
and instructor in the new Europe and
the Americas track. Cultures are no
longer seen as self-contained and un
changing, he said.
One of the best results of the new
structure, according to CIV coordinator
and History Prof. Paul S'Oaver, is that it
gives professors greater flexibility in
choosing texts. Now that there is no

longer a core, instructors can create more
cohesive syllabuses.
This is especially helpful in the case
of the more thematic courses like Values,
Technology, Science and Society, he said.
For instance, the VTSS professor is now
free to select Shakespeare's "The
Tempest," which is more relevant to the
track than "King Lear" or "Hamlet."
Most changes have been minor, according
to Rosaldo.
The greatest drawback seems to be
that in order to teach the new material,
some of the traditional texts must be left
out. Already receiving criticism for being
too much of a snrvey course, the Western
Culture program could not possibly add
supplemental texts to the already bulging

syllabus without removal of existing
texts.
"I like the exceptional materials," said
Margarite Solomon, a freshman enrolled
in Europe and the Americas. But she
said she is unhappy that she will not
have the opportunity to study some of
the traditional texts like Homer.
She said she feels it impossible to ex
pand the course to study all the classics
of Western and non-Western culture in
one year. "I just wish it wasn't an either
or question," Solomon said.
Judith Brown, a professor in the his
tory track, concurs, but notes that one
cannot possibly teach every great text in
European history in one year anyway.
