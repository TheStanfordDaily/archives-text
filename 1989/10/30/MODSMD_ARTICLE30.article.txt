# Smith salts Card wounds

### 
If USC ever has a contest to
come up with a slogan for the
football program, my entry
will be "Trojan football — talent,
and a whole lot less."
From a Stanford perspective,
it's bad enough that USC always
beats the Cardinal in football.
That the Trojans are so graceless
in victory is simply too much to
take.
Consider the lowlights from
Saturday's game. With 8:16 to
play in the fourth quarter the
Trojans scored a game-sealing
touchdown to take a 19-0 lead.
USC went for two instead of kick
ing the extra point.
The decision seems logical until
you realize the point spread is
20V2. I'll leave the math up to you.
But the Trojans aren't through
yet. They show off the ultimate
in autumn declasse when, with
3:19 to play, they call a flea-flicker.
The play resulted in a 38-yard
gain but the drive ended two plays
later on a USC fumble.
USC Coach Larry Smith prob
ably did not bet on the game, but
he sure had a funny way of
showing it.
There is a feeling in some circles
that if Brian Johnson were
healthy and able to start at quar
terback, the Cardinal would be
better than 1-7.
Doubtful, but consider this ul
timate Brian Johnson stat: In

1987, Johnson took over an 0-4
Cardinal squad and led it to a 5-2
record over its final seven games.
Since the end of the '87 season
Stanford has a total of four vic
tories.
Jon Volpe, Lester Archambeau
and Rob Hinckley were all pen
ciled in for huge years in 1989.
That all three have been out or
injured through much of the
season is a big reason Stanford
has one win in eight games.
Less talked about, but relevant
nonetheless, is the effect of the
completely new coaching staff.
No, I'm not suggesting the team
would be better off under the old
one. However, the fact is that the
entire offensive and defensive sys
tems have been revamped.
The transition has been a rocky
one at times and injuries haven't
helped make it easier. The afore
mentioned threesome along with

Tony Trousset, Bruce Lang,
Charlie Young and others would
be among those best equipped —
as a result of talent and experience
— to handle the changes.
The need to work new players
into the new system hasn't made
things any easier.
In the long run, don't be sur
prised if everyone thinks Coach
Denny Green is the genius they
felt he was last spring.
Next year Glyn Milburn, Ellery
Roberts, Volpe and a seasoned
Steve Smith will take the field
behind a solidified offensive line
flanked by the current wide
receiver corps.
The same Stanford offense that
has only 12 touchdowns in eight
games and looks inept at times
will put points on the scoreboard
and make opposing defenses
cringe.
1 know you've heard this for
the last few years but indulge me
and have faith again. In return,
I present you with the following
snippet of reality: If the offense
improves dramatically and the de
fense plays like it did against
Notre Dame and Oregon, the Car
dinal will be hard pressed to have
a winning year.

each year (for evidence, note that
Oregon State is in the Rose Bowl
hunt and Washington State is a
burgeoning national power) and
the non-conference schedule in
cludes Notre Dame and Colorado.
The last three games of the
season are vital for a number of
reasons. For the seniors who
aren't headed for the NFL, they
are the end to their days of com
petitive football.
Don't look for them, nor their
teammates, to show any signs of
rolling over and playing dead.
Against a physical USC squad, the
Cardinal kept plugging away and
afterwards said they were looking
toward next week.
For what its worth, none of
Stanford's remaining opponents
significantly outclasses the
Cardinal.
The impact of two or three vic
tories would be an enormous
morale booster heading into the
offseason. It would also be a
benefit for recruiting in that it
would lend credence to the claim
that the new system is working.
Further, it would show high
schoolers that Stanford doesn't
quit and is just a few players away
from making some noise. Pros
pects would be attracted by the
notion they could be one of those
pieces in the puzzle.
Meanwhile, despite the team's
performance in '89, a scouting
service notes that Stanford is
among the nation's leaders in at
tracting the interest of top high
school talent.

mentioned threesome along with

Tony Trousset, Bruce Lang,
Charlie Young and others would
be among those best equipped —
as a result of talent and experience
— to handle the changes.
The need to work new players
into the new system hasn't made
things any easier.
In the long run, don't be sur
prised if everyone thinks Coach
Denny Green is the genius they
felt he was last spring.
Next year Glyn Milburn, Ellery
Roberts, Volpe and a seasoned
Steve Smith will take the field
behind a solidified offensive line
flanked by the current wide
receiver corps.
The same Stanford offense that
has only 12 touchdowns in eight
games and looks inept at times
will put points on the scoreboard
and make opposing defenses
cringe.
1 know you've heard this for
the last few years but indulge me
and have faith again. In return,
I present you with the following
snippet of reality: If the offense
improves dramatically and the de
fense plays like it did against
Notre Dame and Oregon, the Car
dinal will be hard pressed to have
a winning year.

each year (for evidence, note that
Oregon State is in the Rose Bowl
hunt and Washington State is a
burgeoning national power) and
the non-conference schedule in
cludes Notre Dame and Colorado.
The last three games of the
season are vital for a number of
reasons. For the seniors who
aren't headed for the NFL, they
are the end to their days of com
petitive football.
Don't look for them, nor their
teammates, to show any signs of
rolling over and playing dead.
Against a physical USC squad, the
Cardinal kept plugging away and
afterwards said they were looking
toward next week.
For what its worth, none of
Stanford's remaining opponents
significantly outclasses the
Cardinal.
The impact of two or three vic
tories would be an enormous
morale booster heading into the
offseason. It would also be a
benefit for recruiting in that it
would lend credence to the claim
that the new system is working.
Further, it would show high
schoolers that Stanford doesn't
quit and is just a few players away
from making some noise. Pros
pects would be attracted by the
notion they could be one of those
pieces in the puzzle.
Meanwhile, despite the team's
performance in '89, a scouting
service notes that Stanford is
among the nation's leaders in at
tracting the interest of top high
school talent.
If USC ever has a contest to
come up with a slogan for the
football program, my entry
will be "Trojan football — talent,
and a whole lot less."
From a Stanford perspective,
it's bad enough that USC always
beats the Cardinal in football.
That the Trojans are so graceless
in victory is simply too much to
take.
Consider the lowlights from
Saturday's game. With 8:16 to
play in the fourth quarter the
Trojans scored a game-sealing
touchdown to take a 19-0 lead.
USC went for two instead of kick
ing the extra point.
The decision seems logical until
you realize the point spread is
20V2. I'll leave the math up to you.
But the Trojans aren't through
yet. They show off the ultimate
in autumn declasse when, with
3:19 to play, they call a flea-flicker.
The play resulted in a 38-yard
gain but the drive ended two plays
later on a USC fumble.
USC Coach Larry Smith prob
ably did not bet on the game, but
he sure had a funny way of
showing it.
There is a feeling in some circles
that if Brian Johnson were
healthy and able to start at quar
terback, the Cardinal would be
better than 1-7.
Doubtful, but consider this ul
timate Brian Johnson stat: In

1987, Johnson took over an 0-4
Cardinal squad and led it to a 5-2
record over its final seven games.
Since the end of the '87 season
Stanford has a total of four vic
tories.
Jon Volpe, Lester Archambeau
and Rob Hinckley were all pen
ciled in for huge years in 1989.
That all three have been out or
injured through much of the
season is a big reason Stanford
has one win in eight games.
Less talked about, but relevant
nonetheless, is the effect of the
completely new coaching staff.
No, I'm not suggesting the team
would be better off under the old
one. However, the fact is that the
entire offensive and defensive sys
tems have been revamped.
The transition has been a rocky
one at times and injuries haven't
helped make it easier. The afore
mentioned threesome along with

Tony Trousset, Bruce Lang,
Charlie Young and others would
be among those best equipped —
as a result of talent and experience
— to handle the changes.
