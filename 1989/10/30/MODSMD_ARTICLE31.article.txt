SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - The dec
ade that began with a split season ended
with a split World Series. The final
result, though, was intact.
The Oakland Athletics, the men on
a mission, are baseball's best. Like all
great teams, they let nothing get in
their way — not injuries, not the San
Francisco Giants and not even an earth
quake.
"I'm happy, but I feel guilty for being
happy," Said Dennis Eckersley, who
saved Saturday night's 9-6 victory that
clinched a sweep. "But it took me 15
years to do this, so I'm going to enjoy
it."
There was no champagne in the club
house celebration and there will not be
a parade through downtown Oakland,
which is still cleaning up from the Oct.
17 earthquake. And while this series
will be remembered more for tragedy
than triumph, that does not diminish
or taint the Athletics' accomplishment.
"Even before the first game, I stated
that no matter who won this thing, the
Bay area would win," Dave Stewart,
the most valuable player, said. "The
earthquake was tragic and we have ex

pressed our deepest sympathies to the
families of those lost in the earthquake.
"On the bright side, the two areas
have joined together to turn this thing
around. So in my point of view, there
was no way we could lose."
Stewart, as much as anyone, sym
bolized a season of excellence that was
framed by sorrow.
Each day after the earthquake,
Stewart, an Oakland native, spent hours
in the hardest-hit areas of the city, lend
ing what help he could. At the same
time, the three-time 20-game winner
was on his way to becoming the series
MVP.
"Because of the three years and the
consistency, people probably looked at
me and said this guy deserves some
thing," Stewart said. "I have said it
time and again, that if I never win a
Cy Young but I can pitch in four or
five World Series and win it, that will
be better than never winning the Cy
Young at all."
An hour after Stewart and the Ath
letics ended the series, it was hard to
tell which team won.
Smiles and shouts filled both locker

rooms. Players still dressed in uniform
walked the 10 feet separating the two
clubhouses to congratulate each other.
San Francisco's Terry Kennedy
whooped because his alma mater, Flor
ida State, had beaten No. 2 Miami in
college football. Will Clark of the Giants
talked about going hunting, and Oak
land's Rickey Henderson, hugged by his
mom, talked about taking time off.
It was an unusual scene — there no
hung heads contrasted by jubilant par
ties — but then again, this was an un
usual World Series.
Who would've thought that after a
12-day layoff, during which the pitchers
were supposed to get the edge over hit
ters, the Athletics and Giants would
come back with the highest-scoring,
consecutive World Series games in his
tory?
Or that the Giants, who had not lost
more than three straight games all
season, would lose four in a row?
"To me, this proves that the best
team did not win last season," Oakland's
Dave Parker said, a statement that
surely would be disputed down the Cal
ifornia coast.
