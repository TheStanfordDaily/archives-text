The formula was simple in the Car
dinal men's soccer team's 3-0 loss yes
terday to Washington: the Huskies put
their chances in the goal and Stanford
didn't.
In its final home game of the year,
the Cardinal matched its worst defeat
of the season to drop to 8-9-2. Stanford
had appeared to break out of its recent
funk in a 2-0 victory over Oregon State
Saturday on Maloney Field, but Wash
ington's offensive firepower was too
much for the Cardinal.
Although the game was closer than
the score indicated, the Huskies, who at
13-5-1 are fighting for an NCAA post
season spot, outplayed the Cardinal for
much of the game.
"They played like a team going to the
playoffs and we played like a team who
was just out there to play," said Stanford
fullback Tim Keyes.
Controlling the action from the outset,
the Huskies got on the board midway
through the first half when forward Da-

year from close in. Berto's score was set
up perfectly by assists from midfielder
Brent Aune and forward Eddie Hender
son.
Henderson, who stands only 5-foot-l
but is an All-America candidate, gave
the Stanford defenders fits all day with
his lightning speed and explosive moves
to the goal.
"Our intensity was sporadic, and it's
got to be there all the time to win. The
second goal really deflated us," Keyes
said.
