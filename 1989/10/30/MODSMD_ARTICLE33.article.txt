### Michael Clayton Staff writer 
Wait and see.
The Stanford women's soccer
team completed its home schedule
yesterday with a 0-0 tie against
No. 6 UC-Santa Barbara, and with
the NCAA postseason committee
meeting late Sunday night to de
termine the 12 teams receiving
tournament bids, the No. 20 Car
dinal women can only wait
anxiously to hear today's an
nouncement.
"We have to wait and see the
results from across the country,"
Coach Berhane Andeberhan said.
"This weekend's performance
definitely puts us in a good spot."
The Cardinal Invitational which
debuted this weekend, on the
other hand, left only one definite
for next year's organizers: allot
more time for each game.
With each of the first two games
going into overtime, the darkness
of Friday night demanded that
Stanford's game against Wiscon
sin be called off after the first
overtime period.

Cardinal-Badgers nullified by
darkness, Tournament bids an
nounced today.

Despite the Badgers holding a
1-0 lead after 105 minutes of
hard-fought play, the NCAA Rules
Committee Chairman, Cliff
McCraff, determined that offi
cially the game never happened.
The game needed either to be
replayed in its entirety or be nul
lified. With the Badgers flying
back to Madison immediately
after their game yesterday, the
only possible solution was nullify
ing the game.
Taking into consideration all of
the conditions, the Cardinal had
to feel fortunate to finish the
weekend with one nullification
and one tie. The Stanford squad
entered into the Wisconsin game
without two starters, junior Jen
Bloomer and senior Blair Elliott,
and, after Friday's game, the Car

dinal had lost junior standout Jen
nifer Rowland to a knee injury.
During the game Sunday, the
injuries continued with sopho
mores Kim Peterson and
Elizabeth Joneschild leaving the
field.
"The Santa Barbara game is the
game I am proudest of this year,"
Andeberhan said. "The quality of
play was better in the North
Carolina game, but we were
decimated in this game. We dug
in deep, stayed composed and
battled. It was unfortunate we did
not win."
The Cardinal just missed pull
ing out the victory with under
five minutes left in the second
overtime. Freshman standout
Julie Foudy headed a corner kick
from senior Tonya Antonucci past
the diving goalie. The ball
kareemed away from the goal only
after a Gaucho player standing on
the goal line pushed it out with
her hand. The referee, shielded
from the play, missed the call and
did not stop play to award the
Cardinal a penalty kick.
