# Runners fade in Pac-10's
## Carol Gray, Eric Mastalir lead Card pack 
### Ed Pike Staff writer 
The Stanford cross country
teams made a good showing at
the Pacific 10 Conference Cham
pionships at home yesterday af
ternoon, but a lack of depth
spoiled their homecoming party.
Eric Mastalir, a senior, ran his
first race in two months, taking
third in a dramatic move over the
last 400 meters of the men's race,
but the team sank to a fourth
place finish after a quick start.
The women were bolstered by
senior Carol Gray in fifth and
Melanie Bloch in sixth. "Melanie
ran a career race," said Coach
Scott Chisam. Unfortunately, the
rest of his young team was over
a minute back in the five
kilometer race.
"I think our top three girls were
there," said Gray. "The rest need
to get where Jill [Shenkel] is" —
namely, at sub-six minute mile
pace.
The story in the men's race was
similar — not enough athletes
with the lead runner. The Cardi
nal men managed to get out as a
pack and stay in the top 20 spots
over the first mile and a half, but
could not hold on.
Oregon surprised everyone by
putting a pack of five runners in
the top 10 to clinch the men's
championship. Washington's first
runner was eighth, but took the
women's championship with every

athlete finishing in the top 20.
Depth, which had been a
strength all year, turned out to
be Stanford's Achilles heel. Bill
Crowley was the second men's
finisher in 19th place, followed
by senior Mark Mastalir in 29th.
Stanford's fifth finisher, sopho
more Fred Carter, finished 41st.
Both races featured very strong
competition in the lead pack. Gray
finished in 17:06, just three
seconds off last year's winning
time. Bloch ran a breakthrough
race that achieved her coaches ex
pectations as one of the Pac-10's
best athletes.
Gray, a perennial All-American,
has long established herself as one
of the top runners in the nation.
Last year at the NCAA champi
onship meet, she finished seventh.
The men also had a competitive
race, with fast times on the men's
new eight-kilometer course.
Chisam had expected the winning
time to be about 24 minutes. Eric
Mastalir was just seven seconds
behind winner Marc Davis of Ar
izona in 23:38, with Crowley next
in 24:30.
Unfortunately, the team did not
have anyone else who stayed in
the top dozen. Chisam had
planned a team strategy, and was
disappointed with the result.
Stanford will have to make that
strategy work, as it will take a
second place finish at the District
-8 Championships Nov. 11 at
Fresno to qualify for the NCAA

Championship meet.
"Its a good idea — we've got
to keep sticking with it", said Eric
Mastalir. "In two weeks, we
should be ready. I know we can
do it."
The men will expect Mark Mas
talir, junior Jason Martin and
sophomore Dave Scudamore to
form a Cardinal lead pack. While
the Stanford men finished in the
top half yesterday, Chisam is ex
pecting a better performance at
the District meet.
On the women's side, freshman
Jill Shenkel made a strong debut
in 34th place. Sophomore Jeannie
Heltzel, who was sidelined earlier
with back spasms, was 43rd. Ex
pected to move up are juniors
Jamie Fallon and Wendy Neely
and freshman Ashley Black.
Gray and Bloch were in the lead
pack from the start. Both had
their best race of the season, with
Gray improving on her sixth-place
finish in this race last year. Bloch
was the big surprise, however,
moving up from 22nd last year.
The women finished one spot
ahead of last year, when they were
seventh. Chisam had set his pre
race goal as a top-five finish in
this meet for the women. The po
tential was there, but several of
the athletes were running their
first championship meet.
"I'm going to have a positive
attitude and start working
towards the District Meet", Gray
said. "Starting now."
