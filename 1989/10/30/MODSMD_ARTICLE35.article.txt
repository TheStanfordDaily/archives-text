Are you seasick yet?
The ups and downs of the Stanford wom
en's volleyball team this season have been
enough to make even the most avid of
Cardinal sports fans wondering just how
good, or bad, this team really is. Fortu
nately, the latest chapter in this Jeckyl
and-Hyde season, this weekend's "up,"
comes at no better time in the season for
the Cardinal.
Stanford swept both 16th-ranked Oregon
on Friday and Oregon State on Saturday
to once again swing the momentum in the
team's favor for the upcoming matches
against USC and Pacific 10 Conference
leader UCLA this Thursday and Friday.

Although Stanford dominated this week
end's matches, the team had again raised
questions about its consistency after an
upset-loss to unranked San Jose State last
Tuesday.
"It was important to get out of the
doldrums," Stanford Coach Don Shaw said.
"There was an unbelievable sense of relief,
just the sense of 'yes, we're capable of
playing (this well.)' "
Stanford dominated at Oregon on Friday
night, 15-6, 15-9, 15-9, and followed with
an equally impressive 15-4, 15-13, 15-5 vic
tory over the Beavers in Corvallis Saturday
night. With the victories, Stanford im
proves its conference record to 8-3 and is
now 12-6 overall.
In losing to the Spartans in a four-game
match last Tuesday, the Cardinal appeared
mentally unprepared for the match and
played poorly against a simplistic Spartan
team. But Shaw said a lack of mental
preparedness was not an issue in the week
end's matches.
"We were completely tuned in. It wasn't
even close fto Tuesday's loss,]" he said. "I
think the team realized what can happen
when you concentrate."
Stanford's concentration translated into
tough defense on Friday that allowed the
Cardinal to capitalize on Oregon's few mis
takes.
"The way we sided out was the key to
the match," Shaw said. "We were able to
take advantage of the opportunities they
gave us."

The following night, sophomore outside
hitter Kristin Klein and freshman middle
blocker Bev Oden combined for 27 kills to
dominate Oregon State. Stanford hit .290
for the match while holding the Beavers
to a meager .093 hitting percentage. Klein
hit an unbelievable .500 while Oden hit an
equally spectacular .462.
The Cardinal now returns home for three
matches against three of the country's
premiere teams. Thursday, Stanford hosts
the eighth-ranked Women of Troy from
USC, with whom Stanford is tied for second
place in the Pac-10.
Friday night, Stanford will try to topple
No. 2 UCLA, the conference leader, whose
11-0 Pac-10 mark is likely insurmountable
in the race for the conference title. Stanford
lost to both teams on a road trip to Los
Angeles on Oct. 5 and 6.
On Tuesday, Nov. 7, Stanford will host
the fourth-ranked Tigers of Pacific, who
beat Stanford in Stockton on Sept. 12 in
the season's second game.
Shaw said the team must continue to
maintain its mental intensity to win the
upcoming matches.
"We need to execute really well," he said.
"The thing that will win these matches is
who commits the fewest mistakes."
These three matches present the Cardi
nal its best opportunity for qualifying for
the NCAA tournament. By winning two of
the three matches, Stanford will demon
strate that it can compete with the coun
try's elite and is a viable contender for the
national title.
By beating USC, the Cardinal will posi
tion itself as the likely second-place finisher
in the conference. After the USC and UCLA
matches, Stanford has only four conference
matches remaining — two at the Arizona
schools and two at home against the Wash
ington schools.
The Cardinal beat both Arizona and Ar
izona State at home on Oct. 13 and 14.

Tackle Matt Borkowski and the Cardinal defense dug down deep for a trench warfare battle with USC, but eventually
Trojan quarterback Todd Marinovich and a burly offensive line wore Stanford down in a 19-0 defeat for the Cardinal.
