PACIFIC PALISADES, Calif. -
Everyone in the country is gun
ning for defending NCAA cham
pion Sandra Birch this season. If
the events at the Riviera All-
American Tennis Championships
over the weekend are any indica
tion, they're going to need bigger
guns.
Birch won the title yesterday
with an impressive 6-1, 6-3
trouncing of teammate Meredith
McGrath. Later in the day,
McGrath and partner Teri Whit
linger dismantled Georgia's Shan
nan McCarthy and Stacy Schefflin
in the doubles final, 6-1, 6-0.
Debbie Graham joined Birch on
the doubles court where they com
pleted a stirring comeback to win
the consolation title 6-3, 2-6, 7-5.
Birch actually got a slow start
in the singles final, failing to hold
serve in the first game. But
McGrath returned the favor in

the second game and would be
broken in her next six service
games.
McGrath's service trouble made
it difficult for her to serve and
volley. When she did get in to the
net, Birch came up with a pinpoint
passing shot or a well-placed lob
for a winner.
Birch marched to the tourna
ment title with only a minor
stumble along the way. In Friday's
quarterfinals, Birch shut out
Schefflin 6-0, 6-0. The next day
she took on USC freshman Linda
Harvey-Wild who had eliminated
Graham Friday 7-5, 6-4.
In the first set, it seemed like

Birch would continue her perfec
tion as she posted another 6-0 set
victory.
But Harvey-Wild — who will
likely challenge McGrath for
freshman of the year honors —
came back strong with potent
groundstrokes and took the sec
ond set 6-2.
After throwing a tantrum in the
third set, Harvey-Wild broke
Birch to pull even at 3-3. Birch
got the break back and closed out
the match with a 6-3 win in the
third.
McGrath bested Pepperdine's
Janna Kovacevich in the quarters
6-2, 2-6, 6-3. That victory set up
a semifinal showdown with Mc-
Carthy, another serve-and-volley
player.
In an exciting see-saw battle,
McGrath outlasted McCarthy and
got the 6-3, 2-6, 6-3 win. In her
first collegiate action, McGrath
won raves for her polish and style.
That was especially true on the
doubles court. In what Whitlinger

described as "basically the first
time we played together," the Car
dinal duo improved with each
match.
They bested No. 9 Debbie Edel
man and Stephanie Reece of In
diana in the quarterfinals 3-6, 4-6,
6-2. Next up was third-rated
Stella Sampras and Mamie Ceniza
of UCLA. McGrath and Whit
linger won that one 6-1, 3-6, 6-3.
McCarthy and Schefflin, their
opponents in the final, are ranked
No. 2 behind Stanford's Birch and
Graham. "We ended up having a
tough draw, I think that helped
us," Whitlinger said.
McGrath, a world-class doubles
player, was impressed with her
new partner. "I was almost sur
prised at her volleying," McGrath
said. "She stayed in there at times
when I though about backing up."
McGrath and Whitlinger will
take over the nation's No. 1
ranking in the next Volvo/
Intercollegiate Tennis Coaches As
sociation poll from Birch and
Graham.
Seeded No. 1, the NCAA dou
bles semifinalists rebounded from
their first-round loss to win the
consolation title in stirring fash
ion.
Facing fifth-ranked Jessica Em
mons and Kim Po of UCLA, Birch
and Graham opened strong and
won the first set 6-3.
They dropped the second 6-2
and fell behind 5-2 in the third.
Then suddenly, Birch and Graham
found a rhythm and captured five
straight games to win the match.
Card notes
NBA great Wilt Chamberlain was
in attendance for much of the action.
Harvey-Wild complained aloud that
she was "playing like a girl." It wasn't
clear whether that was in contrast to
a woman or a guy.
Joe Lynch, the media coordinator
for the coaches association, did his
imitation of ESPN's Chris Berman
with the names of many tournament
participants. Among his better efforts:
Caroline "Here on Gilligan's" Delisle
of Oklahoma State; Stacey Schefflin
"Off to Buffalo"; Trisha Laux "Got
nothing to do with it" of USC.
On Friday, five present or former
members of The Stanford Daily staff
were in attendence, by far the largest
contingent from a single media organ
ization.
