### Brian W. Webber Staff writer 
After placing fourth at this weekend's Stanford Intercollegiate,
the women's golf team feels it is "on the brink" of joining the
elite of collegiate golf.
The Cardinal's three-round team total of 916 was 27 strokes
off the pace set by victorious Arizona State. The Sun Devils
edged San Jose State by 8 shots to claim the team title.
Evaluating ASU and San Jose as among "the premiere pro
grams in the nation," Coach Tim Baldwin was somewhat satisfied
with the team's performance.
Baldwin appraised the fall invitational as a learning experience.
"We now know what we have to work on to reach the level of
the nation's best," he said.
Currently ranked seventh nationally, Stanford enhanced its
post-season possibilities by besting powerful Pacific 10 Confer
ence foes USC, UCLA and Arizona this weekend.
The Cardinal was led by Sophomore Adele Moore, whose
rounds of 76-72-77 placed her ninth overall.
Displaying glimpses of the talent that made her the team's
most consistent performer last season, Moore finished seven
strokes behind individual champion Brandie Burton of ASU.
Despite making the fashion "faux pas" of wearing the wrong
colored shorts on Sunday, Sophomore Audrey Wooding continued
her skillful play this season.
Wooding was "fairly pleased" with her 228 total and 13th
place individual finish, which included a blistering 34 on the
back nine Friday.
Jodi Figley, Stephanie Davis and Stephanie Parel each posted
rounds that contributed to the Card's fine showing.
Despite earning its third consecutive top five finish this season,
the team expressed some disappointment with its showing. Sum
marizing her teammates' views, Parel felt that the squad was
on the verge of emerging as a national talent.
"In every tournament we play, we seem to come realiy close
to shooting the scores we're capable of. We're ready to put it
all together," Parel said.
The team has three weeks to devote itself to finding the
elusive quality needed to break into the big time. Stanford next
travels to Palm Springs Nov. 20-22 for the UCLA Invitational.
