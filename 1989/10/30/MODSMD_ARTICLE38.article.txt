Other planets must be ex
amined in order to increase the
knowledge of Earth, according to
Electrical Engineering Prof. Von
Eshleman.
Eshleman presented a discus
sion and slide presentation Thurs
day night on the recent Voyager
2 space mission to a crowd of
about 75 in Arroyo Lounge.
"There is information about our
world that can be gained only by
studying other worlds," Eshleman
said. He also acknowledged the

difficulty of gaining such infor
mation from planets other than
those in our own solar system.
"We don't know how many
other solar systems exist, and it's
an interesting observation that al
though we have examined every
planet in our system, we have no
direct evidence of a single planet
in another system," he said.
The Voyager 2 mission, in
which an unmanned spacecraft
toured the planets of the outer
solar system — including Neptune
this summer — performed several
experiments designed by Esh-

leman.
The spacecraft, which he de
scribed as "the size and mass of
a Volkswagen," sent radio waves
through the atmospheres of Nep
tune and its moon Triton to
analyze characteristics of the
bodies.
Keeping his information rele
vant to current events, Eshleman
told the crowd, "There indeed are
Marsquakes and moonquakes,
just as there are earthquakes.
This is a good reminder that the
Earth is fragile, and that nothing
lasts forever," he said.
