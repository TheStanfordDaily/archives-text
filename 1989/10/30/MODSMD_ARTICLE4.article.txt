# Fighting nuclear war
## Stanford prof. pours time, money into court battle against disaster 
### Andrea Kohn Staff writer 
Despite the odds against suc
cess, Stanford computer scientist
Clifford Johnson continues to
pour time and money into his
fight against accidental nuclear
war.
Johnson commits about $4,000
each year to a suit he doesn't
believe he will win in the court
system.
A manager of capacity planning
for the Stanford Data Center,
Johnson has filed suit three times
alleging that the standing orders
of the Strategic Air Command
could lead to an accidental nuclear
war caused by a computer error.
"I'm trying to create sufficient
embarrassment I to the U.S. gov
ernment) so the issue gets re
solved politically," Johnson said.
In all three suits, Johnson con
tends that the U.S. "launch-on
warning" nuclear defense system
is unconstitutional because it
usurps presidential and congres
sional power to declare war and
threatens his life.
Johnson sued the secretary of
defense in his first two suits.
However, in this latest suit,
Johnson is suing the commander
in chief of the Strategic Air Com
mand and his chain of command
for Minuteman/MX launch in
both their official and unofficial
capacities.
Johnson said that ultimately he
would like the court to "declare
the unlawfulness of the Strategic
Air Command's standing orders
to respond immediately to an
electronically received, digitally
encrypted launch order."
"We are inexorably moving
toward electronic control of nu

clear missiles," he said. "Are we
really going to lock ourselves into
this doomsday machine?"
Johnson's first suit, filed on
Feb. 29, 1984, against then-
Secretary of Defense Caspar
Weinberger, was dismissed as a
political issue outside the juris
diction of the courts. When he
appealed, the suit was dismissed
again on technical grounds.
Although Johnson's second suit,
which was filed on June 16, 1986,
corrected the technical problem,
it too was dismissed as a political
question. On appeal, this second
suit was dismissed when the
judges ruled that Johnson lacked
"standing" to sue because his in
jury is "speculative" and does not
differ from the interests of any
other U.S. citizen.
Johnson's third suit was dis
missed by a U.S. District Court
judge in San Jose on Sept. 20, on
the grounds that it was essentially
the same as his second. Johnson's
motion to set aside the dismissal
will be heard on Dec. 5.
If his current suit is unsuccess
ful, Johnson plans to take his case
outside the U.S. judicial system.
Johnson, who is a British citizen,
said he will petition the British
government to sue the United
States in the International Court
of Justice.
Much of Johnson's current case
attempts to establish the fact that
he does indeed have the necessary
standing to sue.
"Standing is a very important
issue because it dictates how much
the public can influence the gov
ernment and protect itself from
the abuses of government,"
Johnson stated.
