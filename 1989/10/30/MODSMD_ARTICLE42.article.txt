# Students, Kennedy to participate in environmental conference
## 
### Chad Rockwell 
Two Stanford students and Uni
versity President Donald Kennedy
will participate in a major inter
national environmental confer
ence beginning tomorrow in Los
Angeles.
Julie Bunn, a graduate student
in economics, and Joel Swisher,
a research associate for the Civil
Engineering Department, were in
vited to participate in the confer
ence due to their outstanding
work related to environmental
protection.
Kennedy will be part of a coun
cil for business, finance and labor
issues related to the environment.
The conference, called the
Globescope Pacific Assembly, will
last three days and will focus on

issues such as resource depletion
and international awareness of en
vironmental problems. It will at
tempt to define a national
strategy to deal with such prob
lems.
"We have reached a turning
point and have finally come to
realize that not addressing envi
ronmental concerns is a luxury
we cannot afford," Bunn said.
Bunn will join Sen. Albert Gore,
D-Tenn., and others in an inter
national roundtable discussion
addressing the impact of a World
Commission on Environment and
Development report that was
delivered to the United Nations
in 1987.
The report, called "Our Com
mon Future," stated that "our
global future depends upon . . .

our willingness and ability to ded
icate .. . energy to our common
future."
Swisher will deliver testimony
advocating a "carbon bank,"
which would establish a system
of checks and balances intended
to limit harmful carbon emis
sions. The testimony will be pre
sented before a council that will
include Kennedy and former U.S.
President Jimmy Carter.
Bunn, who directed last year's
"You Can Make a Difference" con
ference on environmental issues,
is specializing in soil and water
resource management and agri
cultural policy.
Both Bunn and Swisher were
picked by the Global Tomorrow
Coalition to participate in discus
sion and to offer testimony.

'Our future depends
upon our willingness
and ability to dedicate
energy to [it].'

The coalition, which is sponsor
ing the conference, is a national
alliance of non-governmental in
stitutions and individuals that
aims to build support for "sus
tainable development." The coali
tion defines sustainable develop
ment as a process of development
that meets the environmental
needs of the present without com
promising needs of future genera
tions.
Bunn emphasized the need to

unite economic and environmental
policies in governments world
wide. "Developing countries are
realizing that environmental
degradation is becoming a con
straint to improving human
welfare. . . . Economy exists be
cause it utilizes resources."
Bunn also called for a change
in the definition of economic
growth. "The GNP (gross national
product) does not treat environ
mental resources in an appropri
ate way," she said. "Resources
that are depleted and sold are
counted as income .. . they are
sold as assets. Nothing is sub
tracted."
Portions of the Los Angeles con
ference, one of five such confer
ences nationwide, will be televised
by Turner Broadcasting Systems.
