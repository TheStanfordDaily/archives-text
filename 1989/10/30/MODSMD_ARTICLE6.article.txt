# Axe Committee still rallying despite fee loss
## 
### Robert Pardington Staff writer 
Despite losing its ASSU special fee request last
spring, the Stanford Axe Committee will continue
with most of its planned activities this year, Axe
Committee chair Pat Broun said.
The traditonal pregame bonfire in the lake bed
of Lake Lagunita has been canceled, but instead
the committee will coordinate a rally in White Plaza
after Gaieties Nov. 16.
An all-campus party on the Row is tentatively
scheduled to follow the rally. Alpha Epsilon Pi, Beta
Theta Pi and possibly Sigma Chi fraternities will
host indoor parties, according to Broun.
The party will be held indoors only because of
the danger of a crowd near Columbae, which was
declared unsafe after last week's earthquake.
Also new for this year is an a capella concert
featuring singing groups from both Stanford and
UC-Berkeley Monday night of Big Game week. Tick
ets for the concert are $4 for students.
Friday of Big Game week, the committee will
sponsor a concert featuring the band The Untouch
ables, paid for by the Concert Network and by dorm
contributions, according to Broun.
The rally after Gaieties is being supported by
donations from Stanford alumni and by revenue of
sales of the 1989 Big Game pin.
The committee has already put out a "Frosh
Handbook," which was handed out during orienta
tion and underwritten by two local companies.
As it has for several years, the committee this
week printed and distributed the Axe Committee
blotter, a summary of campus events for the quarter.
The blotter pays for itself through advertising, ac
cording to Broun.
During winter quarter, the committee plans to
support Stanford basketball more than it has in
the past. Broun pointed out, however, that funds
from the ASSU fee request have conventionally been
used to support activities during basketball season.
Although the Axe Committee has been able to
accomplish most of its goals this year without the
special fee assessment, Broun said that "hopefully
next spring we'll have better success at the polls."
