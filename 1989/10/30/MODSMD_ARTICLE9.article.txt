# Journalist recalls Tiananmen
## 
### Wendie Schneider 
Calling the spring student dem
onstrations in China an "earth
quake which most likely measured
well over 7.1 on the political Rich
ter scale," journalist Alan Pessin
related his experiences in China
to a capacity crowd at Branner
Friday evening.
Until his expulsion by the Chi
nese government 10 days after the
June 4 massacre, Pessin was chief
of the Beijing bureau of Voice of
America, the U.S. government
owned radio station that broad
casts news around the world.
For his role in reporting on the
protests leading up to the killings
in and around Tiananmen Square,
Pessin was charged by the Chi
nese government with "engaging
in illegal news-gathering under
martial law, distorting facts,
spreading rumors and instigating
counter-revolutionary turmoil
and rebellion." He was ordered to
leave the country within 72 hours.
Pessin said his expulsion
resulted from the desire of the
Chinese authorities to rewrite his
tory and to convince the Chinese
people of the truth of "the gov
ernment's version of events,
namely that the democracy move
ment was a counter-revolutionary
one and that the massacre never
happened."
He cited the Chinese Foreign
Minister's statement that VOA
was trying to "slowly subvert the
Chinese government and the Chi
nese Communist system by
beaming news into China."
Since the student demonstra
tions, VOA in China has switched
from a mixed format of news and
cultural programming to contin
uous news broadcasting.
Although current news from
China focuses on the continuing
crackdown, Pessin sees perma
nent changes resulting from the
events of this spring.
"Chinese people who want
change know now that they are
not alone," he said. "When the
soldiers return to their barracks,
and the octogenarian leadership
departs the scene, the millions of
people who want the kind of

changes the students demanded
will still be there."
Pessin expressed the controver
sial view that "the best hope for
reform in China right now would
be for [Deng Xiaoping] to stay on
for a while."
Pessin said he feels the
reformers among China's top
leadership "know that repression
can keep the Party in power for
a while, but that the way to power

and progress in the long run lies
in there being at least some degree
of pluralism."
Pessin said that as he prepared
to depart from China, he received
a last phone call from an anony
mous young man who told him
not to be discouraged.
Pessin replied, "Don't you be
discouraged."
"We will never be discouraged,"
the caller responded.
