to our planet the suggestions above
should get you started thinking
Then develop a solution, complete
with the assumptions, formulas, and
graphs that support your conclusions
W
ml\ hitch is a good
hitch vou must
use MathCAD
software to prepare
vour submission
Rut that'll |iist make
the project go faster.
Recause with MathCAD,
you simplv enter formulas
as vou would on a scratchpad
and let MathCAD do the work
( hange a variable, and Math( AD
calculates your new answers in
stantly. And because Math( AD
is the world's most popular engi
ncertngand scientific calculating
software, vou'll be using a tool vou
can use for the rest of vour career
You'll find a copv of MathCAD on
vour campus, or von can purchase it
at a special student price of $ w (reg
$495) between now and 1/31 '90
On April IS, 1990, we'll award prizes
