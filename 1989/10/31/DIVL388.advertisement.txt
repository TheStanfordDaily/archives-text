Have you had problems getting funding for various programs?
Do you want office space but can't get any?
Do you have problems finding meeting space from week to week?
We 11... it's time to join the new ASSU Student Group Council!
The Student Group Council is a new idea of the Council of Presidents. On
many other campuses, student governments incorporate a body comprised of
the different student groups which address issues like funding and space.
These are issues which affect all, but which are hard for individual groups to
work on by themselves. By forming a council which represents student
groups at large, we hope to more effectively address these topics, and reach
some real and positive solutions.
If you are interested in working on these topics, make sure and come to the
Treasurer's Orientation meetings (Mon. Oct. 30 or Thur. Nov. 2). Following
this informational meeting, the first organizational meeting of the Student
Group Council will be the next Tuesday, Nov. 7 at 7 pm in the ASSU.
