Wish something could be done about Financial Aid?
Well, something can be done. And you can be a part of it.
The ASSU Council of Presidents and ASSU Committee on
Democracy in Education (CODE) are organizing a campaign for
increased federal, state and campus financial aid. We believe that
education is the cornerstone of a truly democratic society and
that every person should have the right to obtain a higher
education. Our nation needs to reevaluate its priorities when over
27% of the national budget is spent on defense and only 1.8% on
education. It is clear that more money needs to be spent on
financial aid and education in general.
At Stanford, we're concerned that with the rising cost of
tuition students have enough grant aid (federal, state and
Stanford) so they don't have to work more than the recommended
10 hours, stop out, or put themselves or their parents into debt.
This, however, is not the reality for many students. Also, we're
working with the Financial Aids Office to improve their service
and allocation of funding to students.
We need your input and help. If you have concerns to raise
or suggestions to offer; or if you'd like to help organize a campaign
for more funding call us at 725-1465. Or even better come to the
next ASSU Committee on Democracy in Education meeting
Monday at 7pm at the ASSU offices in Tresidder.
