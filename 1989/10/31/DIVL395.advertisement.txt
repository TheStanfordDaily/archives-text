GRAD STUDENTS ORGANIZE FOR CHANGE!
Last year the ASSU Committee on Democracy on Education (CODE) and the
Council of Presidents (COP) worked with graduates and undergraduates to
pressure the University to increase funding for the TA program. As a result of
these efforts, the Dean of Humanities and Sciences Ewart Thomas announced
on September 14th that he planned to increase funding for TA's by 8% this
year, a total of $260,000. The new funds will be used to train new TA's and to
hire more TA's for all departments in H&S, so that class size and TA workload
will be reduced. This is a victory the entire campus community will benefit
from and an example of what positive things can happen when students work
together.
At a preliminary meeting last week between the COP and concerned
undergrads and graduates from CODE, several issues affecting the graduate
student community were raised. A main problem was that summer RAships for
first and second years have been cut so instead of being able to study for exams
during the summer, we'll now have to work full-time. Other issues included: 1)
the new rules on academic rigor generated from the Graduate Studies office; 2)
following up to further improve the TA program; and 3) the problem of
several well qualified and respected facultyâ€”ones we work and
cannot afford to lose-- that are denied tenure 1
Next meeting: Thurs, Nov 2nd at 12 noon at ASSU
