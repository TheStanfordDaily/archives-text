# AIDS risk real for students
## New study shows surprising chance of HIV infection

Editor's note: This is the second

the Stanford community, coincid

College students often think
they're invincible, and the possi
bility of contracting a life
threatening disease during college
is probably far from most minds
during these "best years of your
life."
However, a recent study of
AIDS on 19 private and state col
lege campuses across the country
may make you think again.
This soon-to-be-released study,
which did not include Stanford,
indicates that one in 500 college
students may be infected with the
human immunodeficiency virus
that causes acquired immune
deficiency syndrome.
Conducted by the Centers for
Disease Control and the American
College Health Association, the

study is the first authoritative
report on HIV infection among
U.S. college students, and the
results are quite surprising.
The study shows that AIDS is
not "last year's disease or some
one else's disease," said Patricia
Fabiano, director of the Health
Promotion Program at Cowell
Student Health Center. "AIDS and
HIV infection are a part of
campus life," she said.

Fabiano explained that "HIV
positive" means only that a per
son has the HIV antibody in his
or her blood, not that he or she
actually has AIDS or any AlDS
related symptoms. However,
Fabiano added that statistics
predict 99 percent of people who
test HIV positive will develop
AIDS within 15 years.
The survey results will surprise
many people who "think that
AIDS doesn't happen to Stanford
students because they're too
nice," said graduate student
Daniel Bao, who founded the
AIDS Education Project at Stan
ford four years ago.
The truth is, however, that
Stanford students do fall victim
to AIDS. The 1987 Stanford Cares
Memorial reported that at least
30 Stanford students, alumni, fac
ulty and staff had already died
from AIDS.
"We can only assume that the
number of deaths has increased

since then," Fabiano said.
In recent years, several student
groups, including the AIDS Edu
cation Project, have organized
AIDS education programs to
spread information about safe sex
practices that can lower a person's
risk of getting HIV.
The students involved in this
project give general informational
presentations known as "AIDS
101" as well as other programs
that emphasize "the nitty-gritty
information for sexually active
people," Bao said.
These programs include the an
nual condom-rating contest and
dorm presentations that Bao
called "rubberware parties —
they're the tupperware parties of
the '905." He added, "We tell
people that, unlike men, not all
condoms are created equal."
Although the programs have
been very popular, Bao said he
doubts they have caused people
to change their sexual habits.

"People are getting worried," he
said, "but we haven't really hit
anywhere."
Judging from the most recent
survey of the sexual practices of
Stanford students, taken in 1986
by Cowell Student Health Center,
Bao's fears may be justified.
Of the 877 students polled in
tfce survey, 66 percent said they
were sexually active, yet 35 per
cent of the undergraduates and
23 percent of the graduate stu
dents said they were not familiar
with safe sex methods. In addi
tion, 30 percent of undergraduates
and 53 percent of graduates who
were sexually active said they did
not practice safe sex.
"Those statistics are pretty dis
turbing," Fabiano said.
Cowell will conduct a similar
survey of students in spring 1990,
but Fabiano said, "We do not
know how the percentages will
change in response to our pro
grams."
Bao said he thinks many mem
bers of the Stanford community
have probably been exposed to the
HIV virus without realizing it be
cause of the seven- to 10-year
latency period between exposure
to the virus and the onset of the
symptoms of AIDS.
Because of this time lag, most
of the students diagnosed with
AIDS are graduate students since
"for people to have AIDS as un
dergrads, they would probably

have had to have been sexually
active at age 12 or so," Bao said.
In fact, most infected students
do not even know they have HIV
because "80 to 90 percent of
people who test positive for HIV
may have no symptoms," Fabiano
said.
One graduate student, who
wished to remain anonymous,
said that two of her friends were
very concerned about AIDS and
recently took HIV tests. "I'm not
promiscuous, but I had unpro
tected sex once and I'm scared,"
she said. "We're not just talking
AIDS, we're talking HIV, and the

truth is that it only takes one
unprotected time to get infected."
Despite statistics, many stu
dents are concerned that informa
tion about safe sex is not being
put into practice on campus.
"In reality, I don't think college
students have changed," said
sophomore Leslie Alexander, a
member of Fabiano's new AIDS
Outreach Program, a two-unit
class.
"Information alone does not
change people's behavior,"
Fabiano said. "They must under
stand that their health is worth
more than the next 10 minutes."

were sexually active, yet 35 per
cent of the undergraduates and
23 percent of the graduate stu
dents said they were not familiar
with safe sex methods. In addi
tion, 30 percent of undergraduates
and 53 percent of graduates who
were sexually active said they did
not practice safe sex.
"Those statistics are pretty dis
turbing," Fabiano said.
Cowell will conduct a similar
survey of students in spring 1990,
but Fabiano said, "We do not
know how the percentages will
change in response to our pro
grams."
Bao said he thinks many mem
bers of the Stanford community
have probably been exposed to the
HIV virus without realizing it be
cause of the seven- to 10-year
latency period between exposure
to the virus and the onset of the
symptoms of AIDS.
Because of this time lag, most
of the students diagnosed with
AIDS are graduate students since
"for people to have AIDS as un
dergrads, they would probably

have had to have been sexually
active at age 12 or so," Bao said.
In fact, most infected students
do not even know they have HIV
because "80 to 90 percent of
people who test positive for HIV
may have no symptoms," Fabiano
said.
One graduate student, who
wished to remain anonymous,
said that two of her friends were
very concerned about AIDS and
recently took HIV tests. "I'm not
promiscuous, but I had unpro
tected sex once and I'm scared,"
she said. "We're not just talking
AIDS, we're talking HIV, and the

truth is that it only takes one
unprotected time to get infected."
Despite statistics, many stu
dents are concerned that informa
tion about safe sex is not being
put into practice on campus.
"In reality, I don't think college
students have changed," said
sophomore Leslie Alexander, a
member of Fabiano's new AIDS
Outreach Program, a two-unit
class.
"Information alone does not
change people's behavior,"
Fabiano said. "They must under
stand that their health is worth
more than the next 10 minutes."

Editor's note: This is the second
in a four-part series on AIDS and
the Stanford community, coincid
ing with AIDS Awareness Week.

College students often think
they're invincible, and the possi
bility of contracting a life
threatening disease during college
is probably far from most minds
during these "best years of your
life."
However, a recent study of
AIDS on 19 private and state col
lege campuses across the country
may make you think again.
This soon-to-be-released study,
which did not include Stanford,
indicates that one in 500 college
students may be infected with the
human immunodeficiency virus
that causes acquired immune
deficiency syndrome.
Conducted by the Centers for
Disease Control and the American
College Health Association, the

study is the first authoritative
report on HIV infection among
U.S. college students, and the
results are quite surprising.
The study shows that AIDS is
not "last year's disease or some
one else's disease," said Patricia
Fabiano, director of the Health
Promotion Program at Cowell
Student Health Center. "AIDS and
HIV infection are a part of
campus life," she said.

Fabiano explained that "HIV
positive" means only that a per
son has the HIV antibody in his
or her blood, not that he or she
actually has AIDS or any AlDS
related symptoms. However,
Fabiano added that statistics
predict 99 percent of people who
test HIV positive will develop
AIDS within 15 years.
The survey results will surprise
many people who "think that
AIDS doesn't happen to Stanford
students because they're too
nice," said graduate student
Daniel Bao, who founded the
AIDS Education Project at Stan
ford four years ago.
The truth is, however, that
Stanford students do fall victim
to AIDS. The 1987 Stanford Cares
Memorial reported that at least
30 Stanford students, alumni, fac
ulty and staff had already died
from AIDS.
"We can only assume that the
number of deaths has increased

since then," Fabiano said.
In recent years, several student
groups, including the AIDS Edu
cation Project, have organized
AIDS education programs to
spread information about safe sex
practices that can lower a person's
risk of getting HIV.
The students involved in this
project give general informational
presentations known as "AIDS
101" as well as other programs
that emphasize "the nitty-gritty
information for sexually active
people," Bao said.
These programs include the an
nual condom-rating contest and
dorm presentations that Bao
called "rubberware parties —
they're the tupperware parties of
the '905." He added, "We tell
people that, unlike men, not all
condoms are created equal."
Although the programs have
been very popular, Bao said he
doubts they have caused people
to change their sexual habits.

"People are getting worried," he
said, "but we haven't really hit
anywhere."
Judging from the most recent
survey of the sexual practices of
Stanford students, taken in 1986
by Cowell Student Health Center,
Bao's fears may be justified.
Of the 877 students polled in
