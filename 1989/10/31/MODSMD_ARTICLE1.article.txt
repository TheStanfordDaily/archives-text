## New study shows surprising chance of HIV infection

Editor's note: This is the second
in a four-part series on AIDS and
the Stanford community, coincid

College students often think
they're invincible, and the possi
bility of contracting a life
threatening disease during college
is probably far from most minds
during these "best years of your
life."
However, a recent study of
AIDS on 19 private and state col
lege campuses across the country
may make you think again.
This soon-to-be-released study,
which did not include Stanford,
indicates that one in 500 college
students may be infected with the
human immunodeficiency virus
that causes acquired immune
deficiency syndrome.
Conducted by the Centers for
Disease Control and the American
College Health Association, the

study is the first authoritative
report on HIV infection among
U.S. college students, and the
results are quite surprising.
The study shows that AIDS is
not "last year's disease or some
one else's disease," said Patricia
Fabiano, director of the Health
Promotion Program at Cowell
Student Health Center. "AIDS and
HIV infection are a part of
campus life," she said.

Fabiano explained that "HIV
positive" means only that a per
son has the HIV antibody in his
or her blood, not that he or she
actually has AIDS or any AlDS
related symptoms. However,
Fabiano added that statistics
predict 99 percent of people who
test HIV positive will develop
AIDS within 15 years.
The survey results will surprise
many people who "think that
AIDS doesn't happen to Stanford
students because they're too
nice," said graduate student
Daniel Bao, who founded the
AIDS Education Project at Stan
ford four years ago.
The truth is, however, that
Stanford students do fall victim
to AIDS. The 1987 Stanford Cares
Memorial reported that at least
30 Stanford students, alumni, fac
ulty and staff had already died
from AIDS.
"We can only assume that the
number of deaths has increased
