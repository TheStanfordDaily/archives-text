# Soviet protest ends in violence

MOSCOW (AP) â€” Helmeted riot police wielding
truncheons repeatedly charged and clubbed demon
strators last night after a candlelight vigil outside
KGB headquarters in memory of Stalin's victims.
Scores of protesters were knocked to the ground,
beaten and dragged into police buses.
About 40 people were detained, the official Tass
news agency said, in what was the harshest crack
down on protesters in Moscow in more than a year.
Tass said the protesters were "trying to create as
much disruption as possible, to display anti-Soviet
posters and shout anti-Soviet slogans."
The clashes took place on some of central Moscow's
busiest streets and were especially jarring because
of the more permissive political climate instituted
under President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's wide
ranging reforms.
About 1,000 Soviets converged on KGB headquar
ters at Dzerzhinsky Square after dusk to mark the
unofficial "Day of the Political Prisoner" and mourn
the millions who were wrongly imprisoned or killed
under Josef Stalin.
The hour-Jong protest, in which two rows of people
holding flickering candles lined up on three sides
of the building, proceeded peacefully. It had been
organized by the Memorial Society, which seeks to
commemorate those who suffered unjustly under
Stalin, and the Democratic Union, a self-styled op
position to the Communist Party.
At the end of the demonstration, a splinter group
of about 500 people, mostly young men, marched
off in the direction of Pushkin Square, a favorite
rallying site for human rights activists.

Chanting, "Shame on the KGB!" and"The KGB
is the enemy of the people!" the group was con
fronted without warning by riot police two blocks
from Pushkin Square as they passed out leaflets to
homebound commuters.
The white-helmeted police, armed with long black
rubber truncheons, formed a line, then waded into
the protesters, clubbing at least four of their leaders
to the ground, then dragging them into nearby
buses for detention.
The demonstrators retreated, then formed again
and headed to Gorky Street, the main thoroughfare
leading to Pushkin Square. The riot police and other
uniformed officers sealed off the square and split
the protesters into two groups.
On Gorky Street, riot police again charged the
demonstrators, taking about six into custody. As
the protesters were dragged to the buses, spectators
shouted: "Shame! Shame!" Several passers-by spat
at a police car.
Another group of demonstrators, gathered on the
southeast side of Pushkin Square, was also repeat
edly charged by riot police, who ignored the dozens
of television camera teams and foreign reporters
who flocked there.
It was the roughest treatment of an unsanctioned
demonstration in Moscow since December 1987,
when about 200 burly men in civilian clothes
roughed up Jews who staged a protest demanding
the right to emigrate on the eve of Gorbachev's
departure for his Washington summit with Ronald
Reagan.
