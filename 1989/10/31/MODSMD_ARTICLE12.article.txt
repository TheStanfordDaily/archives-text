# Flag burned in Capitol
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) â€” Four people
shouting "burn, baby, burn" set fire yes
terday to three American flags on the steps
of the U.S. Capitol in an attempt to force
a court test on the constitutionality of a
new law banning flag desecration.
"We defy your law," said spokeswoman
Nancy Kent.
"We challenge you. Arrest us. Test your
statute. Take it back to the Supreme Court
and try once again to claim it is all con
sistent with your constitutional standards
of free speech."
One of those arrested was Gregory
"Joey" Johnson, whose 1984 arrest for bur
ning a flag at the Republican National
Convention in Dallas set in motion the
court case that led to the new law.
Another was Scott Tyler, 24, who stirred
controversy in Chicago earlier this year by
placing a flag on the floor as part of a
student exhibit at the School of the Art
Institute.
Capitol police charged Johnson, 33, of
Richmond, Ind., Tyler and two others with
violating the Flag Protection Act of 1989,
demonstrating without a permit and dis
orderly conduct, said police spokesman Dan
Nichols.
The demonstration came two days after
members of a radical Vietnam veterans'
group in Seattle, Wash., burned a full-size
American flag and 1,000 paper flags to
protest the law.
President Bush, who favors a constitu

tional amendment to protect the flag, al
lowed the measure to become law without
his signature. It went into effect at 12:01
a.m. Saturday.
It provides punishment of up to one year
in jail and a $1,000 fine for anyone who
"knowingly mutilates, defaces, physically
defiles, burns, maintains on the floor or
ground, or tramples upon any flag of the
United States."
The Supreme Court sparked the contro
versy earlier this year by declaring an exist
ing law aimed at protecting the flag to be
an unconstitutional intrusion on free
speech. Johnson had been convicted under
that law.
Yesterday's flag-burning had been sched
uled for in front of the Supreme Court,
but organizers led photographers and tele
vision cameras to the Capitol steps.
One demonstrator produced a flag and
ripped it in two. Two police officers
struggled with him and tore the pieces of
the banner from his hands.
Behind them, another man produced a
flag and set it afire.
Two other flags also were set ablaze,
crumbling into bits of charred cloth as the
four demonstrators chanted: "Burn, baby,
burn. Burn, baby, burn."
"One shouted: "Stop the fascist flag law.
Oppose it."
"This law enshrines the American flag
as a sacred symbol above criticism," Miss
Kent read from a prepared statement.
