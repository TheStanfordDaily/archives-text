Navy Pilot crashes onto carrier
PENSACOLA, Fla. (AP) — A student pilot
making his first landing attempt on an aircraft
carrier was "low and slow" before his training
jet crashed on the USS Lexington, killing him
and four others, the ship's captain said yesterday.
The T-2 Buckeye slammed into the island, the
same part of the ship hit by a kamikaze plane
in World War 11, before cartwheeling across the
deck and exploding in flames Sunday afternoon,
said Capt. C. Flack Logan.
In addition to the five dead, 19 people were
injured, Logan said.
The pilot, Ensign Steven E. Pontell, 23, of
Columbia, Md., was the only one aboard the
two-seat trainer, a normal situation when
aviators make their first carrier landings, Logan
said.
The ship was steaming in the Gulf of Mexico
in clear weather about 30 miles south of its home
port here when the jet crashed.
"As I see it," Logan said, "he ended up in a
position which in naval aviation is known as
being low and slow, which is a very terrible place
to be when you are coming aboard a ship.''
Landing signal officers radioed the pilot to add
power and waved him off, but he did not comply,
Logan said. He said an investigation would try
to explain why.
The plane flipped upside down before a wing

tip hit the island just below the control tower,
the captain said. The wing tip broke off and
remained embedded in the superstructure when
the Lexington docked yesterday.
The crash occurred six days before the 45th
anniversary of the kamikaze attack that killed
47 crew members and injured 127 on Nov. 4,
1944.
U.S. warplane bombs cruiser
WASHINGTON (AP) - A U.S. warplane ac
cidentally dropped a 500-pound bomb on the Navy
guided-missile crusier USS Reeves during
maneuvers in the Indian Ocean yesterday, slightly
injuring five sailors and leaving a five-foot hole
in the ship's main deck, the Navy said.
The bomb, which detonated upon impact, set
off a small fire that was quickly extinguished,
said Lt. Bruce Cole, a Navy spokesman at the
Pentagon. The incident occurred at 9:06 p.m.
local time.
The five sailors received minor injuries that
did not require outside medical assistance, Cole
said.
The cruiser was located about 32 miles from
Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean.
Although the bomb left a five-foot hole in the
deck near the bow, it did no damage to the outer
hull. Cole said.
