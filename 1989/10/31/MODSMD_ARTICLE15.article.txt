## Eliminating rape 
### 
University action and
continued education
could decrease rape

ON WEDNESDAY NIGHT in
the Foothills, a woman jog
ger survived an assault and
an attempted rape. Although it was
the first attempted sexual assault
reported to campus police this
year, rapes occur here with alarm
ing frequency and simply go un
reported.
On every day and at every loca
tion on campus, women are the
victims of this brutal and devas
tating crime.
According to the results of a
1,250 person survey conducted by
the Rape Education Project and
released last spring, one out of
three undergraduate women and
one out of four graduate women
have experienced some form of
sexual coercion or rape. And 98
percent of the victims knew their
assailant personally.
How can the University help
stop the prevalence of rape?
Unfortunately, there has been
too little effort. Posting a few signs
'that warn people to stay away from
remote areas at night is obviously
pretty worthless. Police Chief Marv
Herrington said, "Runners should
be cautious there even in daylight."
Warning women to stay out of
certain areas and to be cautious
late at night is not a solution to
the problem. Rather than going to
the root of the issue, this puts a
band-aid on the problem and places
the responsibility for the crime in
the victim's hands.
If the University wants to better
improve the protection of women
joggers and other night travelers,
it should install an emergency
phone system connected directly to

University police.
The extensions should be clearly
visible, perhaps marked with blue
lights, so one can be seen from any
place on campus. Other univer
sities, such as Rice University in
Houston, have similar systems and
thus afford a real sense of protec
tion to community members.
Rice's system cost $3,000 per
phone — expensive, but worth the
price — and has been used to
report suspicious persons on
campus, bike thefts in progress,
etc., according to Rice University
Police Chief Mary Voswinkel.
Of course, these mechanical
safeguards deal with less frequent
instances of rape while ignoring
the real problem: A woman is more
likely to be raped by a friend or
an acquaintance — most likely an
other Stanford student — in her
own dormitory than by some
homicidal maniac in the dark.
It was heartening that after the
results of the REP survey were
released last spring, Dean of Stu
dent Affairs James Lyons ap
pointed a Task Force on Sexual
Assault to finally study the various
aspects of rape on campus in depth.
Efforts must be made to educate
the community about rape and to
empower women so they will not
easily be victimized. Groups like
the Women Defending Ourselves
Collective and courses like
SWOPSI's Self-Defense for Women
can teach women to protect them
selves.
Groups like the Rape Education
Project can educate an ignorant
student body about the realities of
rape. Students have no idea of the
frequency of rape on campus —
and victims of rape in strict legal
terms often don't label their expe
riences as such.
In the long term, the University
must work to change societal atti
tudes about sexual violence. And
the key to this is a University
specialty: education.
