Outside group sees racist pattern in Jackson case

THE COALITION to Undo Rac
ism Effectively, C.U.R.E., is a
multiracial organization whose
members represent some 20 profes
sional, public service and non-profit
agencies in the Santa Clara valley.
The purpose of C.U.R.E. is to un
cover institutional racism in the com
munity and to take preventative and
corrective action to help eliminate the
problem.
We have followed with growing
interest Stanford's response to the
demands of a group of minority stu
dents and their supporters whose direct
action last May 15 resulted in a num
ber of changes in University policy.
Their non-violent civil disobedience was
effective in obtaining important reme-

It is clear to us that if
the University were not
behind the charges
against Jackson, there
would be none.

dies to racial inequalities on campus.
What we are concerned about is the
six misdemeanor charges filed against
one student, Louis Jackson. To simply
say, as University President Donald
Kennedy was quoted in The Daily
Sept. 28, that he did not believe the
charges against Jackson were part of a

pattern of racist treatment of black
leaders, seems to be an evasion of the
issue at hand.
It does not explain why Jackson, a
black student leader, is the only one
being charged with offenses which,
according to the Stanford police report,
several other students were guilty of at
the same time and place?
It is clear to us that if the Univer
sity were not behind these charges,
there would be none. If this is not
racial prejudice, it is remarkably poor
judgment on the part of a university
that prides itself on its liberal policies
and the equality of its treatment of all
students.
C.U.R.E. urges you to do all in your
power to drop the charges against

Jackson as he has done no more than
any of the many students who took
moderate means to accomplish their
worthy objectives.
Charging Jackson with these mis
demeanors is an error that can be
corrected by your magnanimous action.
If it is not corrected it may be consid
ered an instance of racial prejudice and
of scapegoating and may well blemish
an enviable reputation.
