# Rodin sculptures should be saved from man-made disaster
## 
### 
Bravo for The Daily and its cartoon
(0ct.24) showing the fate of the Rodin
Sculpture Garden as a result of future
pollution. The Daily has the right
priorities: the preservation of great art
comes before parking convenience. The
National Park Service, for example,
has recently found by studying casts of
the same sculpture sited across the
country that auto emissions are a dan
ger to bronzes.
After commending The Daily for its
background article on the debate, the
Program Manager of Transportation
Programs complains that this paper
has taken a stand prematurely. He
would have had cause for complaint if
The Daily had not first informed itself
of the basic issues. Should The Daily
have waited for a committee vote?
Auer should explain to the commu

nity why, given that a great art collec
tion would be put at risk, his commit
tee would even consider reopening for
parking the lot adjacent to the sculp
ture garden without a genuinely disin
terested and truly scientific environ
mental impact report?
From Auer's letter it appears his
committee accepts as the equivalent of
such a serious study the flawed
"evidence" from a graduate chemistry
student who is also a petitioner for
reopening the lot.
If true, that acceptance, not The
Daily's cartoon, is the height of ir
responsibility. Before the question
comes again to the committee, will a
genuine environmental study be under
taken? If not, the subject must never
appear again on Auer's agenda.
The Stanford Art Museum has been
the victim of a natural catastrophe and
all people will see of it for perhaps two
years is the Rodin Garden.
The Transportation and Parking
Committee has been petitioned to col
laborate in a man-made diaster and

The Daily has been responsibly alert to
this potential tragedy.
