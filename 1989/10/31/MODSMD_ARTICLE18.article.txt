# Kennedy's secretary treated unfairly with battery charge
## 
### 
We are writing to express our out
rage at the treatment of Mandy Mac-
Calla, the woman who was allegedly
battered by Louis Jackson in the
takeover of Building 10 last spring.
MacCalla swears that "at no time"
did she "feel physically threatened" by
him. Her testimony is being ignored as
irrelevant in order that the district
attorney can create a clearly unfair
and probably racist case against Jack
son.
Apparently, the Santa Clara County
District Attorney's office does not view
women as equal partners in the legal

process. It has made a patronizing
assumption that MacCalla is incapable
of knowing whether or not she was a
victim of battery.
It is the civil and human rights of
MacCalla and Jackson which are taking
a beating.
The Stanford administration has
expressed its concern with "illegal
touching," a concern that seems ironic
and timely.
The recently released Rape Education
Project Survey indicates that there is
illegal touching, assaulting and raping
that occurs at Stanford frequently.
One wonders what would happen if
the University and district attorney
were this concerned with women's
physical safety at all times, not just
when it is convenient to them.
