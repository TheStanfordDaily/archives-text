# Damage to VA hospital may set research back 3 to 6 months

### Kim Freidberg 
The effects of the Oct. 17 earthquake
at the Veterans Administration Medical
Center near Stanford have been analyzed,
and officials now believe the quake may
have set the work of researchers — many
from Stanford — back three to six
months.
Building 1, which housed many Stan
ford research projects, sustained the
hospital's worst damage during the
earthquake. Three of its six wings are
currently vacated and may never be reoc
cupied, as structural repair estimates
exceed the $30 million mark. A fourth
wing is still operational but has been
crowded by displaced physicians and
equipment.

"The quake has been very disruptive
to our research program," said VA Assoc.
Chief of Staff Marguerite Hays. "None
of our projects are moving normally right
now."
Since 1960, the Stanford School of Med
icine has had close ties with the VA hospi
tal, sharing facilities and studying
patients for the benefit of its academic
goals. Currently, 116 Stanford physicians
pursue research at the center.
The research of 139 people has been
significantly slowed, Hays estimated.
Several Stanford researchers have been
temporarily relocated, but many are in
a state of transition and still have equip
ment in the damaged areas of the build
ing. Some research projects elsewhere in
the hospital escaped harm entirely but

'My lab is still going but it's definitely not business as
usual.'

are now displaced because patients,
evacuated from Building 1, needed their
space.
Dr. Harry Greenberg, a virologist at
the VA hospital, carried his smaller equip
ment down six flights of stairs but was
unable to test or remove heavier equip
ment.
"My lab is still going but it's definitely
not business as usual," said Greenberg,
who has moved to a building on campus.
He hopes the hospital will convert a build

ing in the area into a research center by
early next year.
Hospital administrators are negotiat
ing to lease space nearby in order to
create a permanent facility. The affected
wings of Building 1 are not structurally
secure, and the VA may find the cost of
seismic strengthening too high, according
to Dr. Andrew Hoffman, associate pro
fessor of medicine and chief of the medical
service at the VA hospital.
Further impeding the work of research
ers, expensive machines, specialized glas

sware and chemical substances were
destroyed or spilled during the earth
quake. This equipment may take months
to restock, according to Hays.
Estimates to replace the damaged
equipment have not been finalized but
could reach $500,000. "We are still testing
our equipment, and the cost just keeps
going up," said Hays.
Fortunately, the power stayed on after
the temblor, saving refrigerated labora
tory cultures.
"Much of our research has been at a
standstill since the earthquake, but
everybody is anxious to get back to work,"
Hoffman said. "The administration is
working hard to get space, and by the
end of the week we should have some
more labs at Stanford."
