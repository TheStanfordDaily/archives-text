## Exposing conservatives 
### 
THE FINEST THINGS in life: food
service meals, bike wrecks in the
Quad, Physics 55 and the Stanford
Review. Leave it to the Stanford Review
to once again confuse their terms. Their
Oct. 29 issue claims "it [The Daily] al
ways chooses its five weekly columnists
in a four to one ratio between radical
and rational."
Because I don't oppose "affirmative ac
tion, quotas, divestment" or support "the
death penalty," I must alas confine myself
to the Stanford Review's idea of hell.
Yes, I'm probably their stereotypical
libâ€”l. However, I'd like to question the
opinion editor's use of "radical." Accord
ing to the eighth grade dictionary defi
nition, radical means "advocating ex
treme or revolutionary change."
In light of this definition, I think I'm
one of the biggest conservatives on
campus. In fact, if they were having a
Mr. Conservative USA, then I'd probably
be at least first runner-up.
Why, you ask? I support a complete
status quo for our resources. I'd like to
see a stop to the current degradation of
racial diversity, species diversity and the
environment. I'd like us to stop wasting
and start conserving. Conserving, conser
vative, conservationalist, just call me Mr.
C.
Of course the people at the Stanford
Review aren't the only ones who misuse
terms such as conservative and radical.
We all are guilty of stereotyping people
into one category or the other without
ever considering the implications.
What exactly do conservatives con
serve? Racial prejudice? Wasteful process

es? It's one of those political paradoxes
along the lines of people who think capital
punishment is good, but abortion is mur
der.
By allowing bigoted energy-wasters to
call themselves conservative, we're sub
liminally establishing bigotry and
profligacy as the norms which "radicals"
must fight to change.
Indeed, aren't vegetarians the most
conservative people around? If you ac
knowledge that on the average 2500 gal
lons of water are needed to produce one
pound of meat on a cow, then vegetarians
no doubt conserve more water than
anyone else.
They also conserve money. If tax dollars
weren't used to subsidize the American
meat industry's use of water, we'd be
paying $89 per pound of protein from
beef.
Naturally, we aren't all cut out to be
vegetarians. I am so accustomed to beef,
it would be years of temptation before I
could ever give it up, but aren't there
other ways we can all conserve?
Sure, consider water. In California, ir
rigation accounts for about 90 percent of
all freshwater consumption. What can
we do? On the worldwide scale, only 37
percent of all irrigation water reaches the
crops.
The U.S. needs to promote the national
and international use of trickle irrigation
systems whereby plants receive water
continuously and directly. Also, because
of its continuous flow, the water in trickle
systems does not have a chance to pick
up pollutants such as salt and pesticides.
On a personal level, we can do many

little things like turn off the dripping
water from the sinks and take shorter
showers. We can recycle paper (this news
paper, for instance) to save on water
consumption and reduce water pollution.
These same ideas of conservation and
respect for our resources apply to cultural
issues, also. Every time the United States
relocates another American Indian res
ervation, it destroys one more bastion of
diversity.
Every displacement results in lost lan
guages, lost arts and lost ancestors. Only
by consciously conserving cultural diver
sity can we hope to understaad the many
facets of humanity. ~
So, Stanford Review, next time you're
abusing words which are three syllables
or more (such as "radical" and "conserva
tive") consider this. You are probably "ad
vocating extreme or revolutionary
change'" by subjugating minorities and
dissolving their cultures.
It is probably your "radical" views
which are squandering our water sup
plies. Ask any of us "armchair revolu
tionaries." All we want is to show people
like you that the cultural and environ
mental resources on this earth are worth
conserving.
