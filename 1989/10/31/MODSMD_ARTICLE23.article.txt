faculty the opportunity to try their hands

In last fall's contest, Cover's luck (bd
not hold out: Only four days from the
contest's end, Cover and Equitz had the
same amount of money. On just one trade,
Equitz went long, Cover went short, and
as a result, Equitz came in the top 10,
and Cover dropped out of sight.

Cover says the game appeals to those
who eryoy the market, but aren't mil
lionaires: "All their lives they've had to
be conservative and now they get to go
for it."
For his 10th place finish, Equitz won
$1,000, a trip to the Bahamas for two,
and a trip to New York City that included
a tour of the New York Stock Exchange,
and the opportunity to talk with brokers
on the floor.
Both Cover and Equitz recommend get-
two or three people together and
bustor»g, two entries. That way, you can
J plan contradictory strategies — "one can
one can go short and if the stock
is mf-center, one will have made the worst
decision possible, and one will be
gloriously lucky," he said.
Hawaii Street Games was created two
a g° by Tim DeMello, a 30-year-old
, ;/ ,former stockbroker from Boston,
r, / "The Challenge opens the world of fi
nancial markets to students, and the
knowledge they gain can open new
opportunities for them when they grad
uate and begin careers," DeMello said.
Equitz said that brokers from Morgan
Stanley were eager to hear his strategies.

While realizing it is very unlike the real
market, he says "they notice it,"and are
interested in talking with you — a
promising reception from a business that
rejects hundreds of hopeful applications
a year.
Equitz says that instead of making him
want to play stocks in real life, the In
vestment Challenge cured him of the mar
ket bug, showing him how much you have
to risk to make the millions and how
much time it takes to keep track of your
investments. On the future investment
of his own money he says,"I think I'll
leave that up to my broker."
Nollet says many students who enter
the competition decide, like Equitz, that
the pressure and stress involved even
when it is just a game, prove to them
that they couldn't handle a career on
Wall Street.
In fact, last year's top finiaher, Julie
Mcßedmond of the University of Illinois,
who made an astonishing $2.5 million
from her original $500,000, took her
$25,000 prize money and invested it very
conservatively: in a money market fund.

Equitz said that brokers from Morgan

Equitz says that instead of making him
want to play stocks in real life, the In

to risk to make the millions and how
much time it takes to keep track of your
investments. On the future investment
of his own money he says,"I think I'll

Nollet says many students who enter

In fact, last year's top finiaher, Julie

In last fall's contest, Cover's luck (bd
not hold out: Only four days from the
contest's end, Cover and Equitz had the
same amount of money. On just one trade,
Equitz went long, Cover went short, and
as a result, Equitz came in the top 10,
and Cover dropped out of sight.

Cover says the game appeals to those
who eryoy the market, but aren't mil
lionaires: "All their lives they've had to
be conservative and now they get to go
for it."
For his 10th place finish, Equitz won
$1,000, a trip to the Bahamas for two,
and a trip to New York City that included
a tour of the New York Stock Exchange,
and the opportunity to talk with brokers
on the floor.
Both Cover and Equitz recommend get-
two or three people together and
bustor»g, two entries. That way, you can
J plan contradictory strategies — "one can
one can go short and if the stock
is mf-center, one will have made the worst
decision possible, and one will be
gloriously lucky," he said.
Hawaii Street Games was created two

r, / "The Challenge opens the world of fi
nancial markets to students, and the
knowledge they gain can open new
opportunities for them when they grad
uate and begin careers," DeMello said.
Equitz said that brokers from Morgan
Stanley were eager to hear his strategies.

While realizing it is very unlike the real
market, he says "they notice it,"and are
interested in talking with you — a
promising reception from a business that
rejects hundreds of hopeful applications
a year.
Equitz says that instead of making him
want to play stocks in real life, the In
vestment Challenge cured him of the mar
ket bug, showing him how much you have
to risk to make the millions and how
much time it takes to keep track of your
investments. On the future investment
of his own money he says,"I think I'll
leave that up to my broker."
Nollet says many students who enter
the competition decide, like Equitz, that
the pressure and stress involved even
when it is just a game, prove to them
that they couldn't handle a career on
Wall Street.
In fact, last year's top finiaher, Julie
Mcßedmond of the University of Illinois,
who made an astonishing $2.5 million
from her original $500,000, took her
$25,000 prize money and invested it very
conservatively: in a money market fund.
