# Halloween revelers visit the Stanfords at their tomb
## 
### Alexandra Dumas 
In 1905, the Senior Class
honored the Stanford family by
placing flowers at the mausoleum,
the family's burial site, every day
of the year. In 1989, the Senior
Class threw a party for the Stan
fords instead.
Known simply as the Maus
oleum Party, the annual Hallow
een bash sponsored by the Senior
Class invites the entire school to
come dance on the Founders'
graves. In costume. And Saturday
night's turnout of almost 1000
people showed "Stanford's typical
disrespect for tradition," said Jeff
Kritzer, a senior class president.
"This is such a great party be
cause it's so irreverent."
The mausoleum has been the
site of Halloween hoopla for years,
and this year was no exception to
the extravagance of the past.
Former Stanford student Jim
Case was the disc jockey for TNT
Concert Systems, which lit up the
eerie mausoleum site with tri
color lights. TNT also featured
two fog machines and three ten
foot video screens, complementing
the funk, rock and pop music. All
this festivity shook the tomb for
hours, but hopefully the Stanfords
did not turn over in their graves.
Naturally, however, the Stan
ford Mausoleum had an interest-

'This is such a
great party be
cause it's so ir
reverent.'

ing history of its own before the
costume parties ever began. It was
built on a plot of land originally
intended for the Stanfords' coun
try home, but upon the death of
Leland Stanford Jr. in 1884, his
parents decided to build a family
mausoleum instead. Leland Jr. re
mained in a temporary tomb,
however, until his father died in
1893. Father and son were then
placed almost simultaneously into
the crypt, which had been lined
with eight inches of Carrera
marble.
Soon after her husband's funer
al, Jane Stanford installed chairs
in the inner chamber of the
mausoleum, where she would sit
for hours every day to meditate.
After twelve years of mourning,
Jane joined her family at rest,
and was also buried in the family
crypt. Although records of her
death were lost in the 1906 earth
quake, it is believed she died

either of strychnine poisoning or
a heart attack while vacationing
in Hawaii. A procession of 6,000
people followed her casket out of
Memorial Church to the
mausoleum, which was officially
closed at that time.
Visitors can now walk right up
to the mausoleum, although there
is no access to the inside, and
examine at close range the four
sphinx which guard the building.
The sphinx in the front were orig
inally female, but were eventually
changed to male sphinx for
reasons unknown.
Perhaps the gender switch was
intended to deter people from
walking up the mausoleum stairs,
but at Saturday's party, many
people had no qualms about
crawling on the tomb, or sitting
on the back of the sphinx. As the
mausoleum blinked red and green,
and students took advantage of
the time change for an extra hour
of fun, the Stanford family be
came the absent hosts of one of
this fall's biggest parties.
One Stanford trio was actually
seen costumed as Leland Sr.,
Leland Jr. and Jane, but the
revelers never revealed their true
identities. After all, the
Mausoleum Party is the best place
on campus to stay incognito, and
try out your costume for Hallow
een night.
