## Polo takes second at Pac-10s 
### T.C. Hall Staff writer 
After weeks of inconsistent play, the
Stanford water polo team put together
a string of four strong games and
captured second place in the Pacific
10 Conference/Big West tournament.
The fourth-ranked Cardinal lost to
No. 1 California in the championship
game 7-6 but will play the Bears again
tomorrow in a Pac-10 Conference
game.
"This is the best we have played
all season," Coach Dante Dettamanti
said. "They really concentrated. They
really wanted to be consistent."
The Cardinal, 23-6 on the season,
posted a 3-1 tournament record with
victories over tbÂ®. University of the
Pacific, Liong Beach State, and UCLA
and, according to Dettamanti, "almost
assured" itself of a NCAA berth.
"What we did in the tournament
was eliminate all the opponents who
could have eliminated us from the
NCAAs", Dettamanti said.
The team put together a balanced
scoring attack and strong play in the
goal from Todd Kemp to beat UOP

14-5, and Long Beach 11-8 on Satur
day. The team earned a trip to battle
the top-ranked Bears of California
Sunday by virtue of an early-morning
victory over UCLA, 10-8.
"The team came out with intensity
and maintained it through the whole
tournament," Dettamanti said.
The team's first real scare of the
tournament came in the UCLA game
as the Bruins came back in the second
half from a five-goal deficit to pull
within one. Stanford led 9-4 late in
the third quarter, but UCLA scored
two quick goals in the last 23 seconds
to pull within three. UCLA did not
let up in the fourth quarter, and the
score was 9-8 before junior Colin Kelly
scored on a man-up situation, giving
the Cardinal a "needed" cushion^
"We had good 'D' and good snoot
ing," Dettamanti said, "but we could
have played a better second half."
The championship game proved to
be a Pac-10 bonanza. Cal leads the
league at 3-0, while Stanford sits in
second with a 2-1 Pac-10 record.
Though the game did not count toward
conference standings, it carried with
it local and national pride.

Cal went up 2-0 early in the first
quarter, but Stanford came back to
tie the score 4-4 with five minutes
left in the second half. The team suf
fered its only lapse of the game before
the half when Cal's hole-man scored
two quick goals to put the Bears up
6-4 with two minutes left in the half.
The score stayed at 6-4 until the be
ginning of the fourth when Cal scored
again to go up by three. Goals by
Greg Morris and Jeff Oeding brought
Stanford to within one at 7-6, but the
Cardinal could not get any closer.
The teams meet again tomorrow
night in a Pac-10 game that Det
tamanti sees as crucial to a top NCAA
seeding.
"Wo really want to f?et back into
the top three nationally," Dettamanti
said. "The only way to that is to beat
Cal."
Cal, 19-2, is the only higher-ranked
opponent Stanford has left on its
schedule.
"They are the most consistent, most
talented team in the country," Det
tamanti said. "[But] they are beatable.
We just have to execute better."
