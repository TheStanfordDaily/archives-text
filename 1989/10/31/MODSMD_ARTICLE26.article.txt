LOS ANGELES
The great thing about Stanford foot
ball is that the Cardinal is in the
Pacific 10 Conference, along with
USC and UCLA. What makes this great
is that the Cardinal plays both teams every
year — one up here and one down there.
Thus, each and every year, Cardinal fans
get the chance to make the trek down to
La La Land to watch the mighty Cardinal
take the field against either the mightier
Trojans or the oft-mighty Bruins. This year
it was the Trojans, the ninth-ranked team
in the country.
But for the Cardinal fans who made the
trip down, the game takes a back seat to
the experience. There are few things more
fun than cruising down 1-5 for hours on
end, listening to the Mendicants' new tape.
OK, maybe a few things do come to mind
as more fun. But not that many. But driving
down that road, the anticipation is just
great. You wonder if you'll see the Cardinal
pull off another stunner, like the team did
against the Bruins in 1986.
Stanford led 28-23 but the Bruins were
driving. They had a fourth-and-one at the
Stanford 19 with 2:15 remaining, and the
call went to tailback Gaston Green on a
sweep. Green ran for 142 yards on the day,
but didn't even make it back to the line
of scrimmage on that play before Brad
Humphreys hammered him and the rest
of the Cardinal defense mopped him up.
"So, Brad, you just beat UCLA. Now
what are you going to do?"
"I'm going to the Gator Bowl."
Stanford won't be going bowling this
year, but memories like that keep fans
going back to Los Angeles each year, in
the hopes the Cardinal pulls off another
shocker.
But even when the team doesn't, as
was the case Saturday, the trip is
always interesting. The Trojan band
took a fun sort of shot at Stanford, mocking
the school at halftime. This, of course, from
a band that still thinks it's cool just because
it played with Fleetwood Mac for one song
("Tusk") more than 10 years ago.
The Stanford band does have a penchant
for playing the same songs over and over
and over again, but the USC band is much
worse. It plays the same ridiculous song
("Conquest," I believe it's called) every time
USC gets a first down — that was 28 times
Saturday — and at random other times.

Now I have noUimc haying ft.
schfvol fighfsong it should at
least be a good s*n£f. The Florida State
fight song is really cool, as anyone who
watched them beat Miami on ESPN will
attest, and even though they play it 20 or
30 times a game, it's still awesome.
At the Coliseum, however, you get the
same old dumb song every three minutes
or so, and you get to watch all the Trojan
fans wave their right arms around, sort of
in unison, in some no-brainwave-activity
required type of gesture that doesn't mean
anything.

But that's not the best. The best is the
yell leaders who have their own public ad
dress system. They stand in pairs on these
boxes around the track that surrounds the
field and try to convince the crowd to cheer.
Now you and I know that fans in L.A.
don't cheer; it's not a cool enough thing
to do. But these guys will come out every
couple of minutes and talk to the crowd
over the loud speaker.
"OK, Trojans, let's hear it. Let's do a
big 'Go SC cheer. Come on Trojans."
And then they ended every cheer with
"Beat the Farm." What does that mean?
They want to grow more oranges than we
do?
Are these guys for real, or what. In being
perhaps the most absurd fans in college
football, however, they are amazingly
amusing. They and the Trojan band make
driving seven hours worthwhile.
Making the trip also gives Stanford
students an excuse not to study
for a weekend. You drive down Fri
day after classes and arrive well after dark.
You get lost trying to find where the friend
you're crashing with lives, so you drive up
and down 405 for a while.
Finally you find the place, go inside, say
'hi' to your friend and hit the hay. You
wake up Saturday morning, sit out in the
warm Southern Californian sun for a while,
then get dressed for the game.
When game time draws near, you load
up on sunscreen and beer and head off for
the game. You manage to find a parking
space about a mile and a half away from
the Coliseum, fill the parking meter and
start walking.
You spend a good 20 minutes walking
through the open-air parking mall that is
the USC campus, then, you Bnajrlv come to
the stadium. Of course, no inside
the stadium; they're all milling about out
side until about 30 seconds before kickoff.
You fight your way in, find that you
seat is about a quarter-mile from the play
ing field, sit down and watch the game.
What could be better?
