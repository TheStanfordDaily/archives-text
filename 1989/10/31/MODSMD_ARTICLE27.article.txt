Sometimes life just seems so unfair.
To the disappointment of the Cardinal
women's soccer team, the NCAA selection
committee announced early Monday
morning that Stanford would not be in
vited to the postseason tournament. For
the second season in a row, after marking
up an impressive regular season record,
the Cardinal will watch the championship
from the sidelines.
"I definitely feel disappointed," Coach
Berhane Andeverhan said. "I know we
are good enough to be there."

The committee decided to invite only
two teams from the Western region,
Santa Clara and UC-Santa Barbara. The
other 10 squads invited to the tourna
ment included Connecticut, Massachu
setts, Hartford, William and Mary,
George Mason, North Carolina, North
Carolina State, Virginia, Colorado College
and Wisconsin.
"The process was fair," Andeberhan
said. "Unfortunately for us, our region
just didn't have enough cross-sectional
wins."

mentum of a strong late-season perform

week, the Cardinal played No. 1 North
Carolina and No. 6 Santa Barbara to
scoreless ties. In addition, Stanford took
No. 11 Wisconsin into overtime before
having the game cancelled because of
darkness.
"We played all the tough teams tough,"
Andeberhan said. "It came down to us

needing wins against the teams that
made it into the tournament."
Unfortunately for the Cardinal, that
did not happen this season. Despite re
cording an impressive 10-4-3 mark with
one of the most difficult schedules in the
nation, Stanford ended up winless in five
tries against the 12 squads invited to the
tournament. Besides the ties with North
Carolina and Santa Barbara, the Cardinal
lost to Colorado College 1-0 in overtime,
to Santa Clara 4-3 and to Virginia 2-1.
The Cardinal lost only one game this
season to a team not invited to the tour
nament.
With the frustrating announcement,

four seniors on the squad must now
prepare for their final game in a Stanford
uniform tomorrow night at the Univer
sity of San Francisco. The Cardinal com
pleted an incredibly successful home
schedule on Sunday by extending its home
unbeaten streak to 12 games, stretching
back to a loss last season to Cal State-
Hayward. This season the Cardinal did
not trail its opponents for one minute of
the 900 minutes of play at Harry Maloney
Field. In addition, the Cardinal women
outscored their opponents 30-1, while
junior goalie Elise Edwards allowed an
average of 0.1 goals per game when
defending the Maloney nets.
