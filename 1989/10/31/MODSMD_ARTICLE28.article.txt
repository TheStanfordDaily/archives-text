# Interception propels Giants past Vikings

EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J.
(AP) — Pepper Johnson returned
an interception 39 yards for a
touchdown to ignite a 17-point
third-quarter burst that pave the
New York Giants a 24-14 victory
over Minnesota Monday night in
a midterm test for two of the
NFL's toughest teams.
The Giants, who improved to
7-1 while breaking a four-game
Minnesota winning streak, won
despite losing quarterback Phil
Simms to an ankle ir\jury on their
first series of the game.
They made up for that by forc
ing turnovers. Besides Johnson's
interception there were fumbles
on consecutive kickoffs that set
up Jeff Hostetler's 11-yard TI)
pass to Lionel Manuel in the third
quarter and Ottis Anderson's 2-
yard touchdown run 12 seconds
into the fourth quarter.
That made it 24-7 and gave New
York a run of 17 points in two
minutes and 25 seconds against
a team that hadn't allowed a point
in the third period in its previous
seven games.
For Minnesota, which fell to 5-3
and into a tie with Chicago atop
the NFC Central, it was a matter
of failing to take advantage of

chances after the loss of Simms,
who was hurt when he was sacked
by A 1 Noga.
Tommy Kramer hit Herschel
Walker with an 8-yard pass to
give the Vikings a 7-0 lead 6:45
into the game — the first points
allowed in the first quarter by
the Giants this season.
But the Vikings spent the rest
of the first half squandering
chances only to be thwarted by a
defense led by Leonard Marshall,
Carl Banks and Lawrence Taylor
that rose up when it had to while
the offense sputtered under Hos
tetler.
The Giants finished with six
sacks against Kramer and Wade
Wilson. Taylor, dormant for New
York's last two games, had 2Wi.
Marshall had two and Banks 1 Vi.
And they held Walker, who had
gained 237 yards in his first two
games as a Viking, to 68 yards in
12 carries, many late in the game
with New York in a prevent de
fense.
Naturally, the game-turning
play was the product of pressure
and came 3:56 into the second
half with the Vikingß, unable to
convert their opportunities, still
holding that 7-0 lead.
