# Despite anonymity, Huang continues to amass windsurfing honors

Windsurfing. Very California.
Very Stanford.
Indeed, every spring the
waiting lists for the athletic de
partment's most popular class —
windsurfing — fill with students
anxious to take a refreshing break
from the usual academic offer
ings. Where else, students figure,
can one take windsurfing for cred
it? What better way to emphasize
Stanford's superiority to its less
fortunate Eastern cohorts?
But, despite its popularity as a
class, windsurfing remains a rela
tively low-profile sport. This ac
counts for the fact that, although
sophomore Ted Huang was the
No. 1 ranked Men's lightweight
and Junior Division windsurfer
(or boardsailor) in both 1987 and
1988 and competed in the World
Cup Championships in Spain last
month, relatively few people on
campus are aware of his ac
complishments.
Windsurfing's lack of publicity
does not disturb Huang. In fact,
he likes it that way. "The lack of
publicity preserves the freshness
of the sport. Other sports aren't
what they were meant to be be
cause of the publicity," he said.
"It's the low profile that keeps
windsurfing fun, keeps it accessi
ble to the beginner."
The accessibility and univer
sality of windsurfing allow ath
letes at any level to derive the
same feelings of exhileration, ac
cording to Huang. "Although
windsurfing in the ocean, with
15-foot breaking swells and 25-
mph winds, isn't your average
sightseer's delight. . .you don't
need high tech equipment or high
tech skills [to enjoy windsurfing],"
Huang said.
"The beginner is psyched just
to be up and gliding," Huang
added. "The advanced windsurfer,
however, exults in harnessing the
wind and ocean — the two basic
elements of the sport — and gath
ering up to 40-mph speeds —
without ever stopping for gas or
worrying about toxic fumes."
Like many Stanford students,

'I just don't think it's that big of a deal. I
windsurf because I love to.'
— Ted Huang

Huang first learned to windsurf
on Lake Lagunita, except that he
started at the age of 12, riding
on the back of his father's 80-
pound board. When this grew
tiresome, his father built him his
own rig, so he could learn to op
erate one by himself. The first
year he practiced infrequently,
commuting to Lake Lag from his
home in Los Altos and teaching
himself as he went, but it soon
became apparent that he pos
sessed a natural feel for the sport.
The following year, Huang's
career took off. He started out
competing in local fleets, but
within three months he had won
both the "A" and "B" races. Na
tional and international honors
were to follow: at the age of 14,
Huang placed second in the 1985
Junior Nationals and fifth in the
lightweight division of the West
ern Hemisphere championships in
Quebec. After the latter race,
Huang was approached for the
first time by the U.S. Boardsailing
coach, who expressed interest in
his training.
In 1986, Huang, who was
largely self-taught until this point,
became the youngest athlete ever
admitted to the U.S. Boardsailing
team. He trained on the Junior
Development Squad for several
years, continuing to excel in tour
nament after tournament. He took
first place in the Junior Nationals
and also traveled to Brazil, where
he placed third in the lightweight
long distance division of the world
championships.
Over the next few years, Huang
continued to compete in a variety
of tournaments, both in the
United States and abroad. Some
of his more impressive achieve
ments include placing first in both
the U.S. Men's lightweight and
Junior Divisions in 1987 and

1988, taking third in the Pan
American Game Trials in 1987,
capturing first in 1987's Olympic
Classes Regatta in Long Beach
California, and coming in fifth in
the Kiel World Division II Cham
pionships in Germany in 1987.
While Huang's windsurfing
career has been extremely suc
cessful — almost ideal — it has
been anything but conventional.
Besides being largely self-taught,
Huang did not start out with ex
perience in any other aquatic
sport. Unlike most windsurfers,
who gain some knowledge of
nautical terms and techniques by
first learning to sail, Huang had
no such background. He has never
surfed or waterskied, and before
joining the Stanford team, he had
never stepped foot in a sailboat.
Despite the fact that he had
never sailed before, Huang's ex
tensive windsurfing experience
made him a natural candidate for
the sailing team.
According to Sailing Coach
Blake Middleton, Huang has
made remarkable progress. "Al
though he isn't to the point where
he could — confidence wise —
sail with the top racers, he is
streaking through the team. He
just needs more time, more hours
out on the water," Middleton said.
"Most of the other sailors have
been competing for upwards of 10
years."
As a team member, Middleton
said Huang "stands out as a
highly respected, well-liked indi
vidual, with a tremendous amount
of talent." He views Huang as a
valuable team member, but also
adds that the team is a resource
for Huang as well.
"His goal is to boardsail in the
Olympics," Middleton said. "This
experience will make him a much
better, smarter boardsailor."

Middleton believes that Huang,
if he continues to practice, has
the potential to become an Ail-
American Collegiate sailor.
Huang is a remarkably modest
individual, particularly for some
one who has achieved so much at
the age of 19. He downplays his
achievements, protesting the idea
that he is worthy of special at
tention. "I just don't think it's
that big of a deal. I windsurf be
cause I love to."
Although Coach Middleton is
impressed by his progress, Huang
doesn't fully share his view, "I
guess he's happy with me, but I
don't know why."
Not entirely pleased with his
own performance, Huang still
feels somewhat out of control in
a sailboat. "I strive to do the best
I can, but I never think what I'm
doing at the moment is my best.
I guess I'm never satisfied,"
Huang said.
Huang is anxious to get his fel
low students started in windsurf
ing. "I encourage everyone to
start windsurfing as soon as pos
sible, or else they'll just be that
much older when they start."
Huang is co-coordinator of the
windsurfing program at Stanford
and hopes to draw even more new
faces into the water this year.
Although windsurfing is a
recreational activity which every
one can enjoy, it is also a highly
competitive sport. Only one ath
lete can represent the United
States in the 1992 Olympics in
Barcelona, and Huang is one of
the favored athletes vying for that
position. He was one of the top
competitors in the 1988 Olympic
trials, finishing fourth. After the
trials, Huang decided to take a
year off from the competitive cir
cuit.
Huang decided to let his per
formance at the World Cup deter
mine whether or not he "should
jump back in the game." Consid
ering he hadn't competed for over
a year, Huang did remarkably well
in Spain, placing 22nd out of 200
and finishing higher than any
other American. His impressive
performance gave Huang renewed

enthusiasm for embarking on an
Olympic campaign.
Still, Huang has moments of
uncertainty. "Sometimes I just
think four years is so far away,"
he said.
Although four years is a con
siderable time span, Huang has a
different attitude toward work
outs than top athletes in many
other sports. Unlike many ath

letes, who view training as the
grueling work one must do in or
der to reach a higher level of
proficiency, Huang derives great
pleasure from the workouts.
"Windsurfing gets me away
from the pressures of school,"
Huang said. "I love just going out
on my own, jumping waves, get
ting 20 to 25 feet of air [between
me and the water] — just for fun."

experience will make him a much
better, smarter boardsailor."

Middleton believes that Huang,
if he continues to practice, has
the potential to become an Ail-
American Collegiate sailor.
Huang is a remarkably modest
individual, particularly for some
one who has achieved so much at
the age of 19. He downplays his
achievements, protesting the idea
that he is worthy of special at
tention. "I just don't think it's
that big of a deal. I windsurf be
cause I love to."
Although Coach Middleton is
impressed by his progress, Huang
doesn't fully share his view, "I
guess he's happy with me, but I
don't know why."
Not entirely pleased with his
own performance, Huang still
feels somewhat out of control in
a sailboat. "I strive to do the best
I can, but I never think what I'm
doing at the moment is my best.
I guess I'm never satisfied,"
Huang said.
Huang is anxious to get his fel
low students started in windsurf
ing. "I encourage everyone to
start windsurfing as soon as pos
sible, or else they'll just be that
much older when they start."
Huang is co-coordinator of the
windsurfing program at Stanford
and hopes to draw even more new
faces into the water this year.
Although windsurfing is a
recreational activity which every
one can enjoy, it is also a highly
competitive sport. Only one ath
lete can represent the United
States in the 1992 Olympics in
Barcelona, and Huang is one of
the favored athletes vying for that
position. He was one of the top
competitors in the 1988 Olympic
trials, finishing fourth. After the
trials, Huang decided to take a
year off from the competitive cir
cuit.
Huang decided to let his per
formance at the World Cup deter
mine whether or not he "should
jump back in the game." Consid
ering he hadn't competed for over
a year, Huang did remarkably well
in Spain, placing 22nd out of 200
and finishing higher than any
other American. His impressive
performance gave Huang renewed

enthusiasm for embarking on an
Olympic campaign.
Still, Huang has moments of
uncertainty. "Sometimes I just
think four years is so far away,"
he said.
Although four years is a con
siderable time span, Huang has a
different attitude toward work
outs than top athletes in many
other sports. Unlike many ath

letes, who view training as the
grueling work one must do in or
der to reach a higher level of
proficiency, Huang derives great
pleasure from the workouts.
"Windsurfing gets me away
from the pressures of school,"
Huang said. "I love just going out
on my own, jumping waves, get
ting 20 to 25 feet of air [between
me and the water] — just for fun."

Despite being one of the best windsurfers in the country, sophomore
Ted Huang insists that he windsurfs because he "loves" it.
Windsurfing. Very California.
Very Stanford.
Indeed, every spring the
waiting lists for the athletic de
partment's most popular class —
windsurfing — fill with students
anxious to take a refreshing break
from the usual academic offer
ings. Where else, students figure,
can one take windsurfing for cred
it? What better way to emphasize
Stanford's superiority to its less
fortunate Eastern cohorts?
But, despite its popularity as a
class, windsurfing remains a rela
tively low-profile sport. This ac
counts for the fact that, although
sophomore Ted Huang was the
No. 1 ranked Men's lightweight
and Junior Division windsurfer
(or boardsailor) in both 1987 and
1988 and competed in the World
Cup Championships in Spain last
month, relatively few people on
campus are aware of his ac
complishments.
Windsurfing's lack of publicity
does not disturb Huang. In fact,
he likes it that way. "The lack of
publicity preserves the freshness
of the sport. Other sports aren't
what they were meant to be be
cause of the publicity," he said.
"It's the low profile that keeps
windsurfing fun, keeps it accessi
ble to the beginner."
The accessibility and univer
sality of windsurfing allow ath
letes at any level to derive the
same feelings of exhileration, ac
cording to Huang. "Although
windsurfing in the ocean, with
15-foot breaking swells and 25-
mph winds, isn't your average
sightseer's delight. . .you don't
need high tech equipment or high
tech skills [to enjoy windsurfing],"
Huang said.
"The beginner is psyched just
to be up and gliding," Huang
added. "The advanced windsurfer,
however, exults in harnessing the
wind and ocean — the two basic
elements of the sport — and gath
ering up to 40-mph speeds —
without ever stopping for gas or
worrying about toxic fumes."
Like many Stanford students,

'I just don't think it's that big of a deal. I

— Ted Huang

Huang first learned to windsurf
on Lake Lagunita, except that he
started at the age of 12, riding
on the back of his father's 80-
pound board. When this grew
tiresome, his father built him his
own rig, so he could learn to op
erate one by himself. The first
year he practiced infrequently,
commuting to Lake Lag from his
home in Los Altos and teaching
himself as he went, but it soon
became apparent that he pos
sessed a natural feel for the sport.
The following year, Huang's
career took off. He started out
competing in local fleets, but
within three months he had won
both the "A" and "B" races. Na
tional and international honors
were to follow: at the age of 14,
Huang placed second in the 1985
Junior Nationals and fifth in the
lightweight division of the West
ern Hemisphere championships in
Quebec. After the latter race,
Huang was approached for the
first time by the U.S. Boardsailing
coach, who expressed interest in
his training.
In 1986, Huang, who was
largely self-taught until this point,
became the youngest athlete ever
admitted to the U.S. Boardsailing
team. He trained on the Junior
Development Squad for several
years, continuing to excel in tour
nament after tournament. He took
first place in the Junior Nationals
and also traveled to Brazil, where
he placed third in the lightweight
long distance division of the world
championships.
Over the next few years, Huang
continued to compete in a variety
of tournaments, both in the
United States and abroad. Some
of his more impressive achieve
ments include placing first in both
the U.S. Men's lightweight and
Junior Divisions in 1987 and

1988, taking third in the Pan
American Game Trials in 1987,
capturing first in 1987's Olympic
Classes Regatta in Long Beach
California, and coming in fifth in
the Kiel World Division II Cham
pionships in Germany in 1987.
While Huang's windsurfing
career has been extremely suc
cessful — almost ideal — it has
been anything but conventional.
Besides being largely self-taught,
Huang did not start out with ex
perience in any other aquatic
sport. Unlike most windsurfers,
who gain some knowledge of
nautical terms and techniques by
first learning to sail, Huang had
no such background. He has never
surfed or waterskied, and before
joining the Stanford team, he had
never stepped foot in a sailboat.
Despite the fact that he had
never sailed before, Huang's ex
tensive windsurfing experience
made him a natural candidate for
the sailing team.
According to Sailing Coach
Blake Middleton, Huang has
made remarkable progress. "Al
though he isn't to the point where
he could — confidence wise —
sail with the top racers, he is
streaking through the team. He
just needs more time, more hours
out on the water," Middleton said.
"Most of the other sailors have
been competing for upwards of 10
years."
As a team member, Middleton
said Huang "stands out as a
highly respected, well-liked indi
vidual, with a tremendous amount
of talent." He views Huang as a
valuable team member, but also
adds that the team is a resource
for Huang as well.
"His goal is to boardsail in the
Olympics," Middleton said. "This
experience will make him a much
better, smarter boardsailor."

Middleton believes that Huang,
if he continues to practice, has
the potential to become an Ail-

himself as he went, but it soon
became apparent that he pos
sessed a natural feel for the sport.
The following year, Huang's
career took off. He started out
competing in local fleets, but
within three months he had won
both the "A" and "B" races. Na
tional and international honors
were to follow: at the age of 14,
Huang placed second in the 1985
Junior Nationals and fifth in the
lightweight division of the West
ern Hemisphere championships in
Quebec. After the latter race,
Huang was approached for the
first time by the U.S. Boardsailing
coach, who expressed interest in
his training.
In 1986, Huang, who was
largely self-taught until this point,
became the youngest athlete ever
admitted to the U.S. Boardsailing
team. He trained on the Junior
Development Squad for several
years, continuing to excel in tour
nament after tournament. He took
first place in the Junior Nationals
and also traveled to Brazil, where
he placed third in the lightweight
long distance division of the world
championships.
Over the next few years, Huang
continued to compete in a variety
of tournaments, both in the
United States and abroad. Some
of his more impressive achieve
ments include placing first in both
the U.S. Men's lightweight and
Junior Divisions in 1987 and

1988, taking third in the Pan
American Game Trials in 1987,
capturing first in 1987's Olympic
Classes Regatta in Long Beach
California, and coming in fifth in
the Kiel World Division II Cham
pionships in Germany in 1987.
While Huang's windsurfing
career has been extremely suc
cessful — almost ideal — it has
been anything but conventional.
Besides being largely self-taught,
Huang did not start out with ex
perience in any other aquatic
sport. Unlike most windsurfers,
who gain some knowledge of
nautical terms and techniques by
first learning to sail, Huang had
no such background. He has never
surfed or waterskied, and before
joining the Stanford team, he had
never stepped foot in a sailboat.
Despite the fact that he had
never sailed before, Huang's ex
tensive windsurfing experience
made him a natural candidate for
the sailing team.
According to Sailing Coach
Blake Middleton, Huang has
made remarkable progress. "Al
though he isn't to the point where
he could — confidence wise —
sail with the top racers, he is
streaking through the team. He
just needs more time, more hours
out on the water," Middleton said.
"Most of the other sailors have
been competing for upwards of 10
years."
As a team member, Middleton
said Huang "stands out as a
highly respected, well-liked indi
vidual, with a tremendous amount
of talent." He views Huang as a
valuable team member, but also
adds that the team is a resource
for Huang as well.
"His goal is to boardsail in the
Olympics," Middleton said. "This
experience will make him a much
better, smarter boardsailor."

Middleton believes that Huang,
if he continues to practice, has
the potential to become an Ail-
American Collegiate sailor.
Huang is a remarkably modest
individual, particularly for some
one who has achieved so much at
the age of 19. He downplays his
achievements, protesting the idea
that he is worthy of special at
tention. "I just don't think it's
that big of a deal. I windsurf be
cause I love to."
Although Coach Middleton is
impressed by his progress, Huang
doesn't fully share his view, "I
guess he's happy with me, but I
don't know why."
Not entirely pleased with his
own performance, Huang still
feels somewhat out of control in
a sailboat. "I strive to do the best
I can, but I never think what I'm
doing at the moment is my best.
I guess I'm never satisfied,"
Huang said.
Huang is anxious to get his fel
low students started in windsurf
ing. "I encourage everyone to
start windsurfing as soon as pos
sible, or else they'll just be that
much older when they start."
Huang is co-coordinator of the
windsurfing program at Stanford
and hopes to draw even more new
faces into the water this year.
Although windsurfing is a
recreational activity which every
one can enjoy, it is also a highly
competitive sport. Only one ath
lete can represent the United
States in the 1992 Olympics in
Barcelona, and Huang is one of
the favored athletes vying for that
position. He was one of the top
competitors in the 1988 Olympic
trials, finishing fourth. After the
trials, Huang decided to take a
year off from the competitive cir
cuit.
Huang decided to let his per
formance at the World Cup deter
mine whether or not he "should
jump back in the game." Consid
ering he hadn't competed for over
a year, Huang did remarkably well
in Spain, placing 22nd out of 200
and finishing higher than any
other American. His impressive
performance gave Huang renewed

enthusiasm for embarking on an
Olympic campaign.
Still, Huang has moments of
uncertainty. "Sometimes I just
think four years is so far away,"
he said.
Although four years is a con
siderable time span, Huang has a
different attitude toward work
outs than top athletes in many
other sports. Unlike many ath

letes, who view training as the
grueling work one must do in or
der to reach a higher level of
proficiency, Huang derives great
pleasure from the workouts.
"Windsurfing gets me away
from the pressures of school,"
Huang said. "I love just going out
on my own, jumping waves, get
ting 20 to 25 feet of air [between
me and the water] — just for fun."

Despite being one of the best windsurfers in the country, sophomore
Ted Huang insists that he windsurfs because he "loves" it.
