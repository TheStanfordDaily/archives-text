In a program focusing on
AIDS in minority communities,
speakers representing the
Asian, Native American and
Latino communities agreed last
night that language is a
barrier to AIDS education.
In conjunction with AIDS
Awareness Week, the program
in Roble Hall's lounge aimed
at increasing student aware
ness about the particular prob
lems that result from cultural
diversity.
According to Phil Tingley, di
rector of the Native American
AIDS Institute, more than 500
separate Native American cul
tures exist in the Bay Area.
"With so many groups, each
speaking a different language
and having a different culture,
AIDS reach-out programs are

very difficult to implement."
Juan Rodriguez, a health ed
ucation specialist, added, "Our
challenge is to design linguisti
cally appropriate and culturally
relevant programs so that mi
nority groups can have access
to them."
Cultural beliefs can also have
an impact on AIDS education,
speakers said. According to
Kevin Fong, AIDS coordinator
for Asian Health Services in
Oakland, many Asian cultures
consider disease and death
taboo subjects. The Asian ideal
of family before individuality
can also inhibit discussions of
personal issues such as AIDS,
he explained.
Rodriguez emphasized the
positive and negative effects
that the power of the Catholic
Church can have on AIDS
awareness among Latinos.
