Describing them as "an integral part
of exciting a young mind" and "people
who are dedicated to undergrads," Dean
of Humanities and Sciences Ewart
Thomas last week announced this year's
five recipients of the Dean's Awards for
Outstanding Teaching in the School of
Humanities and Sciences.
Awards were given to: Peter Galison,
associate professor of philosophy; Tery
Karl, assistant professor of political sci

America.
She sees an important connection be
