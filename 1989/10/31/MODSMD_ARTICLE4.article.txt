### Amy Arends Staff writer 
Describing them as "an integral part
of exciting a young mind" and "people
who are dedicated to undergrads," Dean
of Humanities and Sciences Ewart
Thomas last week announced this year's
five recipients of the Dean's Awards for
Outstanding Teaching in the School of
Humanities and Sciences.
Awards were given to: Peter Galison,
associate professor of philosophy; Tery
Karl, assistant professor of political sci
ence; Susan Nolen-Hoeksema, assistant
professor of psychology; Mary Louise
Pratt, professor of Spanish and Por
tuguese and comparative literature; and
Alexander Stewart, senior lecturer in
the Drama Department.
All recipients share "common attri

butes of a superlative teacher," Thomas
said.
Combining research and education,
being able to make learning interesting
and helping students realize their po
tential were some of the reasons why
they were chosen, according to Thomas.
A faculty committee selected the
award recipients, who were nominated
by colleagues in their own departments.
Student evaluations also played a key
role.
"The language the students used to
describe the different professors is very
similar. They describe a knowledge
brought out by the professor which they
didn't know they had before the class,"
Thomas explained.
Galison teaches undergraduate
courses on the growth of scientific
knowledge, the scientific revolution and
the history and philosophy of modern

physics. He has "mastered the art" of
combining lecture and discussion, ac
cording to Thomas.
Student evaluations said Galison is
helpful in linking ideas and suggesting
areas of research. "His courses are
serious yet elicit enthusiastic student
involvement," Thomas said.
According to Karl, "A good teacher
depends on good students. I get my en
ergy to teach from my students." Karl's
classes include courses on comparative
politics and the political economy of de
velopment, with a specialization in Latin
America.
She sees an important connection be
tween research and teaching. "I try and
bring my actual research into class and
use examples. I try to make the theory
come alive," said Karl, who just com-
pleted a book about oil-producing
countries.
According to junior Sharon
LaVoy, Nolen-Hoeksema "cares
for students and is a very thor
ough lecturer. She's comfortable
with any topic and is a great lis
tener. She feels she can always
learn from students."
Psychology Chair Herbert Clark
said Nolen-Hoeksema is "a clear,
obvious choice for the award be
cause she's very concerned with

both students and research
areas."
Nolen-Hoeksema, a Serra resi
dent fellow, studies the develop
ment of vulnerability to
psychopathology in children and
teaches courses on abnormal psy
chology and personality research.
Pratt described herself as
"deeply committed to trying to
run a non-authoritarian kind of
classroom."
She also encourages students to
collaborate. "It's so much richer
when several students work to
gether," she said.
Pratt instructs classes in Latin

American literature, methods of
literary analysis and advanced
Spanish grammar and was also
involved in coordinating the
"Europe and the Americas" track
of Cultures, Ideas and Values.
Stewart, according to Asst.
Prof, of Design John Wilson,
"sometimes reminds me of an ath
letic coach."
"Theater is a physical activity
as well as a mental," Wilson said.
"He is physically encouraging in
a coach type of way. He never lets
up until people understand the
concept."
Stewart serves as a technical

director for the Drama Depart
ment, works on productions and
teaches courses about subjects
such as stage management and
technical production.
"He talks out of his own expe
rience, not out of a book," Wilson
said.
As a recipient, Stewart said he
was "honored and basically flab
bergasted."
"My style of teaching is being
an actor. I have a script and if
it's not going well, I do my own
thing. I hopefully bring the stu
dents to laughter, not tears," he
said.
