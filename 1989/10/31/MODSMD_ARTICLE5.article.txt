# Civil rights class to return in spring
## 
### Ashok Rai 
The popular "Civil Rights and Civil
Liberties" class taught by James Steyer
has reappeared as unexpectedly as it
was dropped last spring.
In May, citing of budget constraints
and the fact that Steyer does not have
a doctorate, the Political Science De
partment announced it would replace
Steyer's class with a course on consti
tutional law taught by a political scien
tist this year.
But Steyer, a lawyer, will be teaching
the class in the School of Education this
spring.
Having taught Political Science 180
for four years, Steyer said yesterday
that he is thrilled to be able to teach
the class again.
"1 really appreciated the opportunity
to teach in the (Political Science) De
partment for four years," Steyer said.
"But because the School of Education
is offering me the opportunity to teach
what 1 want and what the students
want, I found it proper to change."
Steyer was originally scheduled to
teach Political Science 193, a seminar
on a related subject, this spring. He no

longer will do so.
John Stookey, a political scientist who
is currently completing a law degree at
Stanford, will teach Political Science
180J, "Constitutional Law: Civil Rights
and Civil Liberties," this spring. The
class is intended to substitute for
Steyer's previous class. Stookey could
not be reached for comment yesterday.
Steyer said his course will be signif
icantly different from Stookey's course,
which will be more theory-based. Ac
cording to Steyer, his course will em
phasize education and children's issues.
Steyer said he believes the two classes
will complement each other.
Recalling the decision last spring to
cancel Steyer's course, Stephen Krasner,
chair of the Political Science Depart
ment, said the department decided "on
the basis of its educational responsibil
ity" to have a political scientist teach
what was essentially a political science
class.
Asked how Steyer's class will affect
Stookey's new course, Krasner said the
School of Education's decision was not
made in consultation with the depart
ment. "It reflects that schools make in
dependent decisions," he explained.

Marshall Smith, dean of the School
of Education, said Thomas Wasow, dean
of Undergraduate Studies, was con
sulted before the decision to hire Steyer
was made.
Even before Steyer's course was can
celed in the Political Science Depart
ment, the education school was
discussing the need for a course on the
subject and looking for somebody to
teach it, Smith explained.
Martin Carnoy, professor in the
School of Education, reiterated the im
portance of Steyer's course in the "very
interdisciplinary" School of Education
curriculum.
"The right to an education, a high
quality education, has been one of the
key issues for minority groups over the
last century", said Carnoy, who is also
the chair of the Stanford International
Development Education Committee,
"Steyer's course fills an important
need in the community," he added.
Smith said that the School of Educa
tion and Steyer share a common and
deep interest in the issues of children
and the rights of minorities.
