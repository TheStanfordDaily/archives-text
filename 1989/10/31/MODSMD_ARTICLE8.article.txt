Man exposes self in garage
A man exposed himself to a woman who
had just gotten into her car and then tried
to force his way into the vehicle at 10:45
a.m. Sunday in a parking garage near the
Medical Center, according to Stanford Police
Chief Marvin Herrington.
The woman had locked the car doors and
was able to drive away. She immediately
reported the incident to hospital security,
who called police. They searched the area
without success.
The suspect, who fled on foot, was de
scribed as white, 25 to 35 years old, 5 feet
10 inches tall with reddish-brown hair. He
was wearing a dirty blue baseball cap,
aviator sunglasses, a zip-up sweatshirt and
gray athletic shorts, Herrington said.
This is the second reported sexual incident
on campus in a week. On the evening of
Oct. 25 a man allegedly assaulted and at
tempted to rape a woman jogger on a service

road in the Foothills. The suspect, who
threatened the victim with a knife, has not
been found.
Sunday's incident, which occurred on the
second floor of the parking structure at
Campus Drive West and Roth Way, was the
first of its type reported in the structure,
Herrington said.
Paly tower may come down
Because of structural damages caused by
the Oct. 17 earthquake, the Palo Alto High
School tower, a landmark since it was built
in 1918, may have to be demolished.
Structural engineers deemed the tower
unsafe, according to Walter Freeman, busi
ness manager of the Palo Alto Unified School
District.
The engineers' preliminary recommenda
tion is to tear down the tower. If the tower
is torn down, the school board could then

decide whether to finance the building of a
new tower modeled after the old one, ac
cording to Freeman.
Another option is to reinforce the tower's
structure. The board can "attempt to save
the tower by shoring it up," Freeman said.
He added, however, that "it may not be
financially practicable."
The tower is part of a larger structure
called the tower building. Any decision to
tear down the tower will depend on how
much support this building will need to
stand independently, as well as other com
plications that may be involved.
Tomorrow there will be a special school
board meeting in which district administra
tors will outline the choices to the board
members. However, the board will not make
a decision because estimates for relevant
costs are not yet available.
