# Campus homeowners ready for tax battle
## 
### Ken Yew Staff writer 
Stanford campus homeowners
are faced with a choice: to organize
a representative body for them
selves or to continue facing the
ever-increasing property taxes le
vied by both the county and the
University.
The homeowners met last night
with University officials to dis
cuss their objections to paying
University "ground rent" and
water fees. Campus homeowners
must pay the University a
monthly fee to lease the land on
which their homes are built. They
pay this fee in addition to regular
taxes paid to the county.
As a result, many homeowners
feel they are being unfairly
"double-taxed."
Unlike with county taxes, how
ever, the homeowners have no
voice as to how this ground rent
is assessed. Instead, the Univer
sity determines the ground rent
rates in 10-year cycles.
Homeowners at the forum last
night indicated that owning a
home on campus may be increas
ingly difficult without the forma
tion of a campus homeowners'
group.
A new plan released last night
by the University Ground Rent
Task Force — which determines
the ground rent rates for the next
10 years — was met with sharp
criticism by homeowners.

The task force recommended
that ground rent should be as
sessed according to the lot size
the homes are built on instead of
the current flat rate. This plan
would increase ground rent on a
number of older homes, particu
larly those on Frenchman's Hill
and Pine Hill.
Arguing that homes of the same
size as others that are built on
larger lots would be unfairly
taxed, Economics Prof. John
Shoven said the rates should be
based on the value of the home
and not simply the lot size.
Task force chair John Barwise
said there was no other way to
easily determine the ground rent
on houses, adding that a special
fund will be set up so that those
hit hardest by the increased rates
will receive financial aid from the
University.
Emeritus Physics Prof. David
Ritson said, "Appealing to a com
mittee to plead a poverty case is
incredibly demeaning."
Barwise said the choices made
by the task force were particularly
painful ones.
Provost James Rosse said the
University will help the home
owners create a representative
body of their own, and even offer
to provide office space and up to
$100,000 to a new organization.
"Power is what you make it. If
the homeowners want to have a
municipality of your own, you
can," he said.
