Professor Linvill will talk about how tactile images and synthetic
speech, made possible through advances in integrated circuits,
now provide visually impaired people with unprecedented access

over 90% of 150 such people were recently placed in competitive
Jobs and the return on investment to the government in placing
them has averaged 100% per year.
