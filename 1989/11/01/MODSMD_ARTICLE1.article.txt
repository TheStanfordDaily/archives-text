## Classics Prof. remains optimistic

Awareness Week.

When the bell rang after his
last class meeting of spring quar
ter in 1988, Classics Prof. John
Winkler closed his notebook and
looked around the room. "Well,"
he said, "I'm on sabbatical for
two years, but I'll see you all in
the fall of 1990."
It was an optimistic prediction
by Winkler, who was diagnosed
as having AIDS in August 1987.
The average life expectancy for
someone diagnosed with ac
quired immune deficiency
syndrome today is two to four
years.
Since Winkler learned he has
AIDS, he has followed a regimen
of rest and medication. "His pill
box would beep and he'd have
to stop and take a pill in the
middle of class," remembered
senior Todd Feldman. "That con
stantly reminded all of us how
fragile his life was."
Feldman was a sophomore
when he enrolled in Winkler's
graduate seminar on the Roman

novel. "It was a spring quarter
class that met on Fridays from
2:15 to 4:15, and it was my fa
vorite class," Feldman said. "I
think that says a lot right there
about what a great teacher Pro
fessor Winkler is."
Feldman remembers not only
Winkler's engaging, friendly
style, but also his unflagging op
timism. "It made me feel better
about his health to know that
he wasn't despairing," Feldman
said. "From what I gather he's
overcome a lot of illnesses since
then and I think that's probably
due to his optimism."
Indeed, since he began his sab

pleting a two-year sabbatical.
batical Winkler has struggled
against several mqjor infections.
Last summer he was diagnosed
with a blood infection and hospi
talized in late July. He has since
been able to bring the infection
under control with medication.
Presently, Winkler suffers from
a painful disease called peripheral
neuropathy, an ailment which af
fects the nerve endings in the feet.
"It's like walking on nails,"
Winkler said. "It hurts like hell.
I have to hobble around with a
cane, but 1 manage."
It is perhaps difficult to com
prehend how Winkler can
"manage" with a fatal, debilitat
ing disease such as AIDS. His at
titude toward his illness is not
one of optimism so much as
Courage.
"During late July, when I was
in the hospital, my doctor thought
that I was really near death,"
Winkler remembered. "So I made
all my preparations then with my
friends, my lover and my family.
But it turns out [the doctor] was
Wrong."
This experience gave Winkler a
new perspective on his illness.
"I've been through it once — the
fear of death," he said. "Now I
feel like I'm just coasting along,
with the usual ups and downs."
Winkler is matter-of-fact about
his expectations of recovery. "I'm
not really hopeful of surviving
jpore than another three or four
years," he said. "In fact, I sort of
anticipate dying within the year

or so. But it all depends on in
tangibles."
Although there is no cure for
AIDS, Winkler pointed out that
some people live for five to seven
years after their diagnosis.
Living with a constant aware
ness of the nearness of death has
had surprisingly little effect on
Winkler's outlook on life. "I would
have thought it should have af
fected [my outlook], but it
doesn't," he said. "I still read mys
tery stories, I still take naps."
Winkler added that he hasn't
been "especially energized to do
my academic work. I still waste
a lot of time." Nevertheless, he
hopes to finish his latest book, a
study of the anthropology of
Greek drama entitled "Rehearsals
of Manhood."
But Winkler said he does not
plan to do any more writing or
speaking about AIDS, as he used
to. His poor health has forced him
"to cut out all engagements al
together."
Earlier this year Winkler moved
out of his home in the Santa Cruz
hills. "I have a buyer, and in spite
of the earthquake, he still wants
the house," Winkler laughed. He
is now living with his mother in
Palo Alto.
Winkler said he tries not to
ascribe any special significance to
people with AIDS. "We're just
people who are sick," he said.
"That's all we are."
But to Todd Feldman and many
others, Winkler is much more
than a person who is sick. "He's
an amazing man," Feldman said.
"He's one of the friendliest, most
interesting and brilliant people I
have ever met."

Feldman was a sophomore
when he enrolled in Winkler's
graduate seminar on the Roman

novel. "It was a spring quarter
class that met on Fridays from
2:15 to 4:15, and it was my fa
vorite class," Feldman said. "I
think that says a lot right there
about what a great teacher Pro
fessor Winkler is."
Feldman remembers not only
Winkler's engaging, friendly
style, but also his unflagging op
timism. "It made me feel better
about his health to know that
he wasn't despairing," Feldman
said. "From what I gather he's
overcome a lot of illnesses since
then and I think that's probably
due to his optimism."

AIDS Awareness Week

remains optimistic. He plans to return to work In 1990 after com
pleting a two-year sabbatical.
batical Winkler has struggled
against several mqjor infections.
Last summer he was diagnosed
with a blood infection and hospi
talized in late July. He has since
been able to bring the infection
under control with medication.
Presently, Winkler suffers from
a painful disease called peripheral
neuropathy, an ailment which af
fects the nerve endings in the feet.
"It's like walking on nails,"
Winkler said. "It hurts like hell.
I have to hobble around with a
cane, but 1 manage."
It is perhaps difficult to com
prehend how Winkler can
"manage" with a fatal, debilitat
ing disease such as AIDS. His at
titude toward his illness is not
one of optimism so much as
Courage.
"During late July, when I was
in the hospital, my doctor thought
that I was really near death,"
Winkler remembered. "So I made
all my preparations then with my
friends, my lover and my family.
But it turns out [the doctor] was
Wrong."
This experience gave Winkler a
new perspective on his illness.
"I've been through it once — the
fear of death," he said. "Now I
feel like I'm just coasting along,
with the usual ups and downs."
Winkler is matter-of-fact about
his expectations of recovery. "I'm
not really hopeful of surviving
jpore than another three or four
years," he said. "In fact, I sort of
anticipate dying within the year

or so. But it all depends on in
tangibles."
Although there is no cure for
AIDS, Winkler pointed out that
some people live for five to seven
years after their diagnosis.
Living with a constant aware
ness of the nearness of death has
had surprisingly little effect on
Winkler's outlook on life. "I would
have thought it should have af
fected [my outlook], but it
doesn't," he said. "I still read mys
tery stories, I still take naps."
Winkler added that he hasn't
been "especially energized to do
my academic work. I still waste
a lot of time." Nevertheless, he
hopes to finish his latest book, a
study of the anthropology of
Greek drama entitled "Rehearsals
of Manhood."
But Winkler said he does not
plan to do any more writing or
speaking about AIDS, as he used
to. His poor health has forced him
"to cut out all engagements al
together."
Earlier this year Winkler moved
out of his home in the Santa Cruz
hills. "I have a buyer, and in spite
of the earthquake, he still wants
the house," Winkler laughed. He
is now living with his mother in
Palo Alto.
Winkler said he tries not to
ascribe any special significance to
people with AIDS. "We're just
people who are sick," he said.
"That's all we are."
But to Todd Feldman and many
others, Winkler is much more
than a person who is sick. "He's
an amazing man," Feldman said.
"He's one of the friendliest, most
interesting and brilliant people I
have ever met."

AIDS and the Stanford commu

Awareness Week.

When the bell rang after his
last class meeting of spring quar
ter in 1988, Classics Prof. John
Winkler closed his notebook and
looked around the room. "Well,"
he said, "I'm on sabbatical for
two years, but I'll see you all in
the fall of 1990."
It was an optimistic prediction
by Winkler, who was diagnosed
as having AIDS in August 1987.
The average life expectancy for
someone diagnosed with ac
quired immune deficiency
syndrome today is two to four
years.
Since Winkler learned he has
AIDS, he has followed a regimen
of rest and medication. "His pill
box would beep and he'd have
to stop and take a pill in the
middle of class," remembered
senior Todd Feldman. "That con
stantly reminded all of us how
fragile his life was."
