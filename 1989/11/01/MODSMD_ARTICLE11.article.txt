Stanford's United
Way giving probed
On the surface, it looked as
if Stanford employees contrib
uted through United Way to a
lesser degree than others in
Santa Clara County, so Univer
sity President Donald Kennedy
recently commissioned a task
force to find out why.
The seven-member group's
findings and recommendations
were two-fold: one, that the
measuring stick was imperfect,
comparing Stanford — which
asks its employees to contrib
ute to three separate cam
paigns throughout the year —
to businesses that hold only an
annual United Way drive; and
two, that the amount and
quality of information Stanford
has been providing its employ
ees is incomplete.
Factoring in employee con
tributions to the Combined
Health Agencies Drive and the
funds named for Martin Lu
ther King Jr. — the Scholarship
Fund for Minority Students
and the Memorial Fund to
Combat Racial Injustice —
Stanford appeared much
stronger relative to corporate
sponsored charity campaigns.
Combining employee contri
butions to all three University
drives, Stanford employees
averaged around the median,
$20.65 per capita.
Still, the committee felt the
information the University
provides about United Way
could be improved.
Until the University commit
tee members met with officials
of United Way of Santa Clara
County, it was not clear to
them that individuals could
direct their contributions —
not only to specific United Way
agencies in Santa Clara County,
but to any agency in any
county, including those not af
filiated with the United Way.
The United Way drive at

Stanford will be confined this
year to a two-week focused
campaign period fpom Nov. 6-
17. Chaired by Psychiatry Prof.
Alberta Siegel, who has served
on the boards of two local agen
cies — the Senior Coordinating
Council of Palo Alto and Pen
insula Children's Center — the
drive will include a comprehen
sive information campaign to
help Stanford employees make
more informed decisions about
giving options through United
Way.
To get the word out about
all the opportunities available
by contributing through
United Way, two information
sessions have been scheduled.
The first, with United Way rep
resentatives, will take place Fri
day, Nov. 10.
The second, planned for Wed
nesday, Nov. 15, will include
Stanford employees who serve
as volunteers for United Way
agencies. Both will be held from
noon to 1 p.m. at El Centro
Chicano.
In addition, a 10-minute
United Way film will be shown
continuously during the lunch
hour Monday, Nov. 13, also at
El Centro. The entire Stanford
community is invited to attend.
Light refreshments will be
served.
Also, the pledge cards to be
circulated to employees
through interdepartmental
mail will reflect the options to
contribute through United Way
in a county other than Santa
Clara, to direct a gift to a spe
cific United Way agency or to
direct a contribution to an
agency not ordinarily funded
by United Way.
"Increased participation by
Stanford in the United Way
campaign is appropriate, desir
able and attainable if pursued
in keeping with Stanford's own
culture," the review committee
concluded after seven meetings
held between January and
June, 1989.
