# Ortega delays cease-fire decision

### 
MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) — Pres
ident Daniel Ortega postponed until
Wednesday a decision on whether to
end a 19-month-old truce with U.S.-
backed Contras, a government official
said.
A spokesman at the president's office
said an evening news conference to an
nounce a decision was put off because
Ortega was still meeting with senior
defense and interior ministry officials,
"and this meeting will last a long time."
"We'll have the announcement very
early Wednesday," she said, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
President Bush has left open the pos
sibility that he would seek military aid
to the Contras if Ortega went ahead
with his plans to break the truce.
Ortega traveled Tuesday with an
American diplomat to a site where Or
tega said a rebel attack the night before
left four people dead and five wounded.
Ortega disrupted a summit last week
by threatening to end a truce with the
Contras. He cited rebel attacks as a
mtyor reason.
Presidential spokesman Maria An
tonia Cuadra told The Associated Press
Ortega would probably make his truce
decision announcement from San
Miguelito, the town where the govern
ment claims a Contra attack took place
Monday night.
John Leonard, the U.S. charge
d'affairs, was invited to accompany Or
tega to the site, but Leonard sent em
bassy political adviser Valentin Martinez
instead, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman
Mercedes Borge said.
Ortega and Martinez, who is fluent
in Spanish, spoke privately for about
five minutes at the farm cooperative
that was allegedly attacked near San
Miguelito, about 200 miles southeast of
Managua on the shores of Lake Nica
ragua, Ms. Borge said.
The two traveled by helicopter accom

panied by Defense Minister Humberto
Ortega — the president's brother — and
Foreign Minister Miguel D'Escoto, In
terior Minister Tomas Borge and offi
cials from the United Nations and the
Organization of American States.
The leftist Sandinista government
and Contra leaders agreed to a truce in
March 1988. Nicaragua has extended it
on a monthly basis since, but low-level
fighting continued. The latest extension
expired Tuesday.
On Friday, Ortega told a meeting of
17 Western hemisphere leaders in San
Jose, Costa Rica, he would end the truce.
The heads of state, including Bush, had
assembled to honor the 100 th anniver
sary of Costa Rican democracy.
Ortega said his decision was prompted
by increasing Contra attacks in the past
three weeks and a rebel ambush earlier
in the week that killed 18 people. Many
Contra fighters have moved to Nicara
gua from camps in neighboring Hon
duras in the three months since a Cen
tral American peace agreement was
signed Aug. 7.
Reaction in San Jose was so negative
i Ortega backed off and said there were
112 ways the truce could be extended. He
i left the meeting abruptly Saturday.
After Ortega's announcement, Bush
> called him "a little man" and an "un
wanted animal at a garden party."
> Contra leader Enrique Bermudez said
Tuesday the Nicaraguan army already
had broken the truce.
: "The Sandinistas have been waging
t a silent war against our forces," he said
in an interview in Tegucigalpa, capital
of Honduras. "Now they are trying to
make that war public because they are
facing defeat in the Feb. 25 presidential
i elections."
F The Contras say they do not initiate
- attacks and act only in self-defense.
Barricade, the Sandinista party news
- paper, quoted military leaders in north

central Matagalpa province Tuesday as
saying soldiers were ready "to respond
to the latest terrorist expressions" of
the Contras, estimated to number 1,200
in that area.
It quoted Deputy Commander Or
lando Talavera, regional security chief,
as saying 18 Contras had been killed in
the area since Friday.
In San Jose on Friday, Presidents Os
car Arias of Costa Rica and Carlos
Andres Perez of Venezuela reminded
Ortega the peace plan signed by five
Central American presidents Aug. 7 pro
vided mechanisms for resolving dis
putes.
Provisions of the plan include dis
banding the Contras by early December
in return for Ortega's pledge the
Nicaraguan elections Feb. 25 will be
free and fair.
Congress allows only non-lethal aid
to the Contras, but Bush said Tuesday
he might seek renewed military aid if
the civil war resumed.
"I would re-evaluate this situation in
a minute if the cease-fire is broken,"
he told a news conference in Washing
ton.
Both the United States and Contra
leaders want to keep the rebels intact
as a fighting force to make sure Ortega
keeps his promise about the elections.
Congress suspended military aid to the
Contras in February 1988.
On Monday, Secretary of State James
A. Baker 111 said threats by Ortega to
suspend the truce might be a prelude
to cancelation of the elections for a pres
ident and national legislature.
In an interview the same day with
NBC News, Ortega said: "The elections
are taking place in Nicaragua, period.
With Contra or without Contra they are
going to take place, definitely. With war
or no war, that is, elections are taking
place."
