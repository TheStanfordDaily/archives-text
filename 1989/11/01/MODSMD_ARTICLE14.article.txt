# Shipboard summit announced

WASHINGTON (AP) - Presi
dent Bush announced Tuesday he
will hold a shipboard summit in
the Mediterranean with Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev
Dec. 2 and 3 "to put up our feet
and talk" informally prior to a
full-blown superpower meeting
next year.
Bush described the weekend
meeting as an open-ended discus
sion with no fixed agenda. He said
neither he nor Gorbachev "an
ticipate that substantial decisions
or agreements will emerge" on
arms control or other matters.
The talks will take place on U.S.
and Soviet naval ships on alter
nate days. The precise location
was not announced, but a site off

Italy appeared likely since Gorba
chev is to visit there from Nov.
29 to Dec. 1.
Bush acknowledged he origi
nally had opposed the concept of
a get-acquainted session, favoring
instead a well-planned meeting
with assurances of concrete
results.
However, he decided that with
dramatic democratic changes
sweeping across Eastern Europe,
the leaders of the two superpow
ers "should deepen our under
standing" of each other.
"I don't want to have two gigan
tic ships pass in the night because
of failed communication," Bush
said. "I just didn't want to — in
■ this time of dynamic change —

miss something, something that
I might get better firsthand from
Mr. Gorbachev."
The president said he expected
"a lot of discussion" about East
ern Europe.
Bush's announcement drew bi
partisan applause on Capitol Hill,
although Senate Democratic
Leader George Mitchell- naid he
was not about to rescind his
criticism that the president's pol
icies toward the blossoming of de
mocracy in Eastern Europe have
been too "timid."
The summit was jointly an
nounced in Washington and in
Moscow.
Much of the planning appeared
still to be done.
