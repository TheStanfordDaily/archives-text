# Hungary announces open elections

BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) -
Parliament decided Tuesday to let
the people decide how and when
to elect a president, and approved
plans to scale down a joint Danube
River dam project despite Czech
oslovakia's objections.
A motion to hold the election
plebiscite Nov. 26 was approved
by a vote of 294-7 in the 380-seat
legislature. A proposal fixing Jan.
7 for a direct presidential election,
assuming that is the choice, was
approved 303-6.
Hungary's ruling Communist
Party, before its transformation
Oct. 7 into a new Socialist Party,
agreed with several new opposi
tion groups to choose the president
by popular vote before parliamen
tary elections planned for next
year.
Two groups that want the pres
ident appointed by the new Par
liament collected more than
200,000 signatures on petitions
supporting that view, however,
and the issue went to the legisla
tors.
While they profess democratic
ideals, the Socialists will remain

in power at least until the par
liamentary elections. The
petitioning organizations con
tended a popular election for pres
ident would favor the Socialists
because of their hold on power.
The decision on the Danube
power project came five months
after Hungary declared a
moratorium on construction be
cause of mounting costs and fears
of environmental damage, includ
ing pollution of Budapest's drink
ing water.
Czechoslovakia, a conservative
Warsaw Pact ally already unhappy
about Hungary's rapid move
toward a multiparty democracy,
was angered by the suspension
and the vote Tuesday was ex
pected to make matters worse.
Premier Miklos Nemeth urged
Parliament to authorize new ne
gotiations with Czechoslovakia,
and acknowledged indirectly that
the project had become a difficult
political issue.
He added, however: "Can there
be a greater political question
than protection of the human en
vironment, the responsiblity to

the living conditions of future
generations?"
Only 189 members approved
renegotiating terms of the
hydroelectric project, but they
were a majority because of ab
sences and abstentions.
A 1977 agreement with Czech
oslovakia, Hungary's northern
neighbor, foresees diverting
stretches of the Danube and cre
ating a huge reservoir east of
Bratislava, capital of Slovakia, as
part of a complex straddling the
border.
Several joint negotiating ses
sions since the Hungarian suspen
sion have failed. In its latest re
jection of Hungarian efforts to
reduce the scope of the $3 billion
undertaking, Czechoslovakia sent
a diplomatic note Monday de
manding compensation and
threatening to divert the river on
its own.
Hungary contends such a diver
sion would violate international
and bilateral agreements govern
ing border rivers and has threat
ened, in its turn, to seek interna
tional arbitration.
