Iran's long arm of the law
TEHRAN, Iran (AP) — Parliament passed a
bill Tuesday allowing Iran to arrest any American
anywhere who offends it, and fanatics of the
Revolutionary Guards whipped up fervor about
the seizure of the U.S. Embassy 10 years ago.
Iranian militants stormed the embassy Nov.
4, 1979, and held 52 Americans hostage for 444
days.
Chief Justice Ayatollah Mohammad Yazdi said
the bill approved by 150 members of the 270-seat
parliament responded to the "bullying nature"
of the United States.
He referred specifically to a Justice Department
ruling that U.S. government agents could pursue
and apprehend terrorists in other countries,
which he called "the worst kind of terrorism and
kidnapping."
The bill must be approved by the Council of
Guardians, 12 religious leaders and experts on
Islamic law who decide constitutional questions.
Minimum wage raise
WASHINGTON (AP) — The Bush administra
tion reached agreement with Democratic congres
sional leaders Tuesday on a plan to raise the
minimum wage to $4.25 an hour by April 1991,
the first increase since 1981.
The agreement for a 90-cents-an-hour increase
over the next 17 months also provides for an
unprecedented subminimum "training wage" that
could be paid to teen-agers with little work ex
perience. It would be pegged at 85 percent of the
prevailing minimum wage.
The House is expected to vote Wednesday on
the compromise, designed to end a lengthy and
often bitter partisan battle that pitted Democratic
congressional leaders and organized labor against
two successive Republican administrations as well
as business interests. President Bush vetoed an
earlier bill and was sustained in the House.
Chinese, Soviets discuss border
BEIJING (AP) — China and the Soviet Union
on Tuesday concluded the fourth round of talks
on their disputed border, saying some progress
had been made.
The statement at the end of the 11-day session
gave no specifics, unlike after the third round

in Moscow a year ago when the two sides said
they had settled most differences over the eastern
part of the border.
It said the talks were held in an earnest at
mosphere and the delegations discussed questions
regarding the boundary alignment of sectors on
which no agreement had been reached and made
some progress.
They agreed to the results of joint aerial
photographic work on the boundary in 1988 and
1989.
The talks began in 1987 to resolve territorial
disputes along areas of the frontier where the
nations' military forces clashed in 1969.
Sailors disappear
NORFOLK, Va. (AP) — A wave struck a freight
elevator on an aircraft carrier as sailors moved
missiles from one deck to another early Tuesday,
sweeping three men and 38 missiles into the
Atlantic Ocean, the Navy said. Two sailors were
rescued.
In the Pacific Ocean, another sailor was miss
ing after being swept off a Navy carrier into
rough seas Monday night, a Navy spokesman
said Tuesday.
Navy planes and ships searched through the
day for the two sailors from the USS Dwight D.
Eisenhower in the Atlantic and the USS Carl
Vinson in the Pacific. The accidents aboard the
Vinson 620 miles north of Wake Island and on
the Eisenhower 90 miles southeast of Cape Hat
teras, N.C., were the third and fourth accidents
on Navy ships in three days.
In Washington, Pentagon spokesman Fred Hoff
man said he saw no connection between the
recent Navy accidents. Hoffman said the Navy
has an excellent safety record.
Prime Minister Bhutto challenged

People's Party will survive the vote, but some
observers fear that whatever the outcome, it
could ignite new violence
