## Editorial Significant backing 
### 
LOUIS JACKSON returns to
court today with significant
backing from Santa Clara
County's Human Relations Com
mission.
Last week the 12-member
county commission voted to take
several actions in support of Jack
son, who many believe is being sin
gled out for his role in the May
15 takeover of University President
Donald Kennedy's office. Jackson
still faces six charges — including
inciting to riot and battery —
related to the occupation of Build
ing 10. And despite a statement by
the victim of the alleged battery
saying she has no complaint
against Jackson, the district attor
ney has actively opposed dropping
the battery charge, claiming the
misdemeanor took place during a
"riot."
Surprised that the case is still
dragging on and concerned with
the appearance of selective prose
cution against Jackson, the com
mission last week voted to call for

a face-to-face meeting among "all
the key players" in the prosecution
process, to write a letter to the
district attorney questioning his
actions in the case, and to write a
letter expressing concern to Ken
nedy.
The commission is an arm of
the Santa Clara County Board of
Supervisors, and though it has no
binding legal power, it is known
for its influence in county human
and civil rights cases.
The relative ease with which the
commission decided to align itself
with Jackson is significant. As a
body not directly involved in the
judicial process, the commission's
perception of Jackson's treatment
is not clouded by political concerns
or blind adherence to written
policy.
But the greatest significance of
the commission's decision to inter
vene on Jackson's behalf may never
be readily apparent because of its
behind-the-scenes approach to rec
onciliation.
