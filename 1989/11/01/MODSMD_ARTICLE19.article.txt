# Education at last

### 
THE SCHOOL of Education's
decison to expand its Under
graduate Honors Program is
a welcome invitation for students
interested in educational issues.
Society at large has a lot to gain
from the study of education. Issues
such as educational access, teacher
quality and funding are in dire
need of study.
A program which will allow more
Stanford minds to concentrate on
remedying some of our educational
woes deserves hearty applause.
The School of Education's pro
gram allows students to do unique,
in-depth coursework in education
in addition to work in their major.
Consequently, students who are un
certain about their future plans
may dabble in the field of educa

tion without necessarily commit
ting to a career in the field.
Although the soon-to-be
expanded program is not designed
for students interested in teaching,
it is likely that some of those who
participate will be attracted to the
teaching profession.
Stanford students who choose to
dedicate their lives to the growth
of others through teaching are a
great asset to society.
Hopefully, the School of Educa
tion's commitment to undergradu
ates will continue to grow, offering
students glimpses of the rewards
of a career in education. The ex
pansion of the Undergraduate
Honors Program is certainly a pos
itive step in that direction.
