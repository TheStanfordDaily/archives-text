Citing potential hardships to
workers, the United Stanford
Workers aj-e challenging a decision
by Tresidcler Union management
to eliminate the jobs of three cus
todial workers.
In response to a $210,000
budget deficit for 1988-89, Tres
idder management decided last
month to reduce the 10-member
custodial staff, according to Tres
idder Associate Director Paul
Szczesiul.
The management gave each cus
todian three options: retire, trans

or risk being laid off. If at least
three workers did not take one of
these options, the management

booking office has been cut in half,
he said.

Tresidder management has cut
the operating budgets 5 percent
from last year. For example, reim

been completely eliminated,
Szczesiul said.
Crouse — who works at Tres
idder — said another proposed
change for Tresidder operation
would move the remaining cus
todians from their daytime shifts
to the night hours — 11:30 p.m.
to 8 a.m.
The administration considers
the night shift more efficient be
cause there are no people around
to interfere with the work,
Szczesiul explained.
This schedule would leave Tres
idder without any custodial super
vision for 16 hours on Wednesday
and Thursday, Crouse said. The
"small emergencies — spills, bro

in the bathroom will be unat
tended" for this time, she said.
However, Szczesiul said he was
