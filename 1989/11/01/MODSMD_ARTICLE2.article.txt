# USW protests cut of Tresidder jobs
## 
### Michael Friedly Staff writer 
Citing potential hardships to
workers, the United Stanford
Workers aj-e challenging a decision
by Tresidcler Union management
to eliminate the jobs of three cus
todial workers.
In response to a $210,000
budget deficit for 1988-89, Tres
idder management decided last
month to reduce the 10-member
custodial staff, according to Tres
idder Associate Director Paul
Szczesiul.
The management gave each cus
todian three options: retire, trans
fer to another University position
or risk being laid off. If at least
three workers did not take one of
these options, the management
planned to choose three workers
to lay off, USW Steward Linda
Crouse said.
The deadline for the workers'
decision was yesterday, but the
day slipped by without any final
decision from Tresidder manage
ment.
According to Szczesiul, Tresid
der has made a number of em
ployment cuts in addition to the
custodial layoffs. Management
temporarily eliminated the posi

tion of program coordinator and
reduced the job of marketing co
ordinator by 60 percent. In addi
tion, a clerical job in the Tresidder
booking office has been cut in half,
he said.
In order to reduce the deficit,
Tresidder management has cut
the operating budgets 5 percent
from last year. For example, reim
bursement for business travel has
been completely eliminated,
Szczesiul said.
Crouse — who works at Tres
idder — said another proposed
change for Tresidder operation
would move the remaining cus
todians from their daytime shifts
to the night hours — 11:30 p.m.
to 8 a.m.
The administration considers
the night shift more efficient be
cause there are no people around
to interfere with the work,
Szczesiul explained.
This schedule would leave Tres
idder without any custodial super
vision for 16 hours on Wednesday
and Thursday, Crouse said. The
"small emergencies — spills, bro
ken glass, small floods or messes
in the bathroom will be unat
tended" for this time, she said.
However, Szczesiul said he was
unaware of any gaps in custodial
duty and "didn't know what
[Crouse] was talking about."
'Free-spending' alleged
The deficit is in part the result
of a switch from the catering serv
ices of Marriott Corp. to Bon Ap
petit this summer. Tresidder was
"getting premium returns from
Marriott" for the lease of the
building, according to Szczesiul.
But, because Bon Appetit cannot
deliver as much revenue, Tresid
der faces a deficit, he said.
However, recent administrative
decisions have almost completely
eliminated the deficit. "We saw a
need to change the way we
worked," Szczesiul said. "This did
mean that we were laying oft, in
effect, some people," he added.
The main complaint of the
workers is that they are being
forced to "pay for the misman
agement" of the Tresidder admin
istration, according to Harry
Herrera, a nighttime custodian at
Tresidder.
In a 26-page report submitted
to the Tresidder management last
month, Crouse cited what she con
siders to be "free-spending." She
pointed to the recent purchase of
over $71,000 worth of patio furni
ture as one example of needless
spending.

But Szczesiul said the furniture
was a necessary expense because
"we lose between 50 and 75 seats
a year" from damage and theft.
"That's an exaggeration," Crouse
retorted later.
Crouse alleged that although
management has thrown numer
ous parties during working hours,
the workers are not even allowed
to sit down during the final 10
minutes of their shift, which is
supposed to be clean-up time. She
cited an August letter given to
the custodians that said the
workers would be docked in pay
for every minute that they spend
sitting down.
But Szczesiul said he is "not
aware of the parties" to which
Crouse referred.
The workers also said they be
lieve there is an excess of super
visors and other management
personnel "who walk around with
coffee mugs all day," Crouse said.
"Those goddamn coffee-drinkers,"
added custodian Henry Battle.
"It's easy for people to say that
they don't need a supervisor,"
Szczesiul responded.
Some of the workers also visited
meetings of MEChA, the Chi
cano/Latino student organization,
and the Black Student Union on
Monday to ask for their support.
Both organizations are writing
letters in support of the workers.
Difficult options
The management decision par

ticularly concerns Jos6 Oropeza,
an 87-year-old groundskeeper who
has been employed at Tresidder
for 24 years. Oropeza, affec
tionately known as "Old Jos6" by
his fellow workers, is not likely
to be fired because of his seniority,
but workers said his other options
are equally haunting.
If he were to retire, Oropeza
would receive a pension of only
$38 a month from Tresidder, ac
cording to Crouse. Including So
cial Security and other benefits,
his annual salary would amount
to only about $7,200 a year.
Oropeza says he cannot live on
such a small amount.
Oropeza's other option is to be
demoted to the job of custodian,
which would also entail a switch
to night hours. This would be
physically impossible for Oropeza,
who commutes every day from
San Jose.
Since Oropeza does not drive,
his daughter, who also works full
time, drives him to Stanford and
picks him up later in the day. A
change in Oropeza's schedule
would mean that he would have
no way of getting to work, because
of his daughter's inflexible
schedule.
So far, two Tresidder cus
todians have agreed to accept a
transfer to another University de
partment. "We like working here
at Tresidder, but they don't want
us here, so we have to go some
where else," said Herrera.

planned to choose three workers
to lay off, USW Steward Linda
Crouse said.
The deadline for the workers'
decision was yesterday, but the
day slipped by without any final
decision from Tresidder manage
ment.
According to Szczesiul, Tresid
der has made a number of em
ployment cuts in addition to the
custodial layoffs. Management
temporarily eliminated the posi

tion of program coordinator and
reduced the job of marketing co
ordinator by 60 percent. In addi
tion, a clerical job in the Tresidder
booking office has been cut in half,
he said.
In order to reduce the deficit,
Tresidder management has cut
the operating budgets 5 percent
from last year. For example, reim
bursement for business travel has
been completely eliminated,
Szczesiul said.
Crouse — who works at Tres
idder — said another proposed
change for Tresidder operation
would move the remaining cus
todians from their daytime shifts
to the night hours — 11:30 p.m.
to 8 a.m.
The administration considers
the night shift more efficient be
cause there are no people around
to interfere with the work,
Szczesiul explained.
This schedule would leave Tres
idder without any custodial super
vision for 16 hours on Wednesday
and Thursday, Crouse said. The
"small emergencies — spills, bro
ken glass, small floods or messes
in the bathroom will be unat
tended" for this time, she said.
However, Szczesiul said he was
unaware of any gaps in custodial
duty and "didn't know what
[Crouse] was talking about."
'Free-spending' alleged
The deficit is in part the result
of a switch from the catering serv
ices of Marriott Corp. to Bon Ap
petit this summer. Tresidder was
"getting premium returns from
Marriott" for the lease of the
building, according to Szczesiul.
But, because Bon Appetit cannot
deliver as much revenue, Tresid
der faces a deficit, he said.
However, recent administrative
decisions have almost completely
eliminated the deficit. "We saw a
need to change the way we
worked," Szczesiul said. "This did
mean that we were laying oft, in
effect, some people," he added.
The main complaint of the
workers is that they are being
forced to "pay for the misman
agement" of the Tresidder admin
istration, according to Harry
Herrera, a nighttime custodian at
Tresidder.
In a 26-page report submitted
to the Tresidder management last
month, Crouse cited what she con
siders to be "free-spending." She
pointed to the recent purchase of
over $71,000 worth of patio furni
ture as one example of needless
spending.

But Szczesiul said the furniture
was a necessary expense because
"we lose between 50 and 75 seats
a year" from damage and theft.
"That's an exaggeration," Crouse
retorted later.
Crouse alleged that although
management has thrown numer
ous parties during working hours,
the workers are not even allowed
to sit down during the final 10
minutes of their shift, which is
supposed to be clean-up time. She
cited an August letter given to
the custodians that said the
workers would be docked in pay
for every minute that they spend
sitting down.
But Szczesiul said he is "not
aware of the parties" to which
Crouse referred.
The workers also said they be
lieve there is an excess of super
visors and other management
personnel "who walk around with
coffee mugs all day," Crouse said.
"Those goddamn coffee-drinkers,"
added custodian Henry Battle.
"It's easy for people to say that
they don't need a supervisor,"
Szczesiul responded.
Some of the workers also visited
meetings of MEChA, the Chi
cano/Latino student organization,
and the Black Student Union on
Monday to ask for their support.
Both organizations are writing
letters in support of the workers.
Difficult options
The management decision par

ticularly concerns Jos6 Oropeza,
an 87-year-old groundskeeper who
has been employed at Tresidder
for 24 years. Oropeza, affec
tionately known as "Old Jos6" by
his fellow workers, is not likely
to be fired because of his seniority,
but workers said his other options
are equally haunting.
If he were to retire, Oropeza
would receive a pension of only
$38 a month from Tresidder, ac
cording to Crouse. Including So
cial Security and other benefits,
his annual salary would amount
to only about $7,200 a year.
Oropeza says he cannot live on
such a small amount.
Oropeza's other option is to be
demoted to the job of custodian,
which would also entail a switch
to night hours. This would be
physically impossible for Oropeza,
who commutes every day from
San Jose.
Since Oropeza does not drive,
his daughter, who also works full
time, drives him to Stanford and
picks him up later in the day. A
change in Oropeza's schedule
would mean that he would have
no way of getting to work, because
of his daughter's inflexible
schedule.
So far, two Tresidder cus
todians have agreed to accept a
transfer to another University de
partment. "We like working here
at Tresidder, but they don't want
us here, so we have to go some
where else," said Herrera.
Citing potential hardships to
workers, the United Stanford
Workers aj-e challenging a decision
by Tresidcler Union management
to eliminate the jobs of three cus
todial workers.
In response to a $210,000
budget deficit for 1988-89, Tres
idder management decided last
month to reduce the 10-member
custodial staff, according to Tres
idder Associate Director Paul
Szczesiul.
The management gave each cus
todian three options: retire, trans
fer to another University position
or risk being laid off. If at least
three workers did not take one of
these options, the management
planned to choose three workers
to lay off, USW Steward Linda
Crouse said.

decision was yesterday, but the
