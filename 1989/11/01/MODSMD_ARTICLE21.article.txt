## The
						downer: Food Service 
### 
I REMEMBER once last year when I
had a really bad day. This day was
so bad that as I was waiting in line
for dinner, I actually thought a good meal
might make it better.
I inched closer to the computer printout
of that evening's menu until finally I
could read it. Since I'm a vegetarian, I
quickly passed over the Salisbury steak
and lemon chicken and fixed my eyes on
the meatless entree.
What was the delectable dish designed
to lift me out of my doldrums? A cabbage
roll stuffed with bulgar.
I never expected much out of Univer
sity Food Services after that. It became
one of the few unpleasant side effects of
going to Stanford, like no dating and
misdiagnoses at Cowell.
But this memory rushed back to me
recently after I read an article in the Oct.
17 Daily about the perennial Council of
Presidents' goal* that were difficult to
achieve. Greater flexibility of food service,
especially in using meal cards at Tresid
der, was one of those goals.
I can't blame the COP for their lack
of progress on the food service issue.
They have to deal with the people who
create names like "Scallops Imperial" and
"Monterey Casserole" and who serve
"Corn Cobettes" rather than corn on the
cob. , #
I was talking with a friend at
Dartmouth College recently and the topic
of food service just happened to come up.
She told me that at Dartmouth, meal
plans are accepted at all campus eateries.
There is a cafeteria, a grill with pizza
and a deli, a health food place, two res
taurants and a store. And, according to

my friend, the food is actually good.
But Food Service says using meal cards
at Tresidder Union is not currently
feasible.
One of their excuses is that it would
change their estimated missed meals per
centage. Apparently Food Service calc
ulates an average amount of meals missed
each week and creates a budget with that
in mind.
If meal cards were allowed at Tresid
der, they say, the missed meal percentage
would be zero, and costs would increase
substantially.
What about Sterling Quad? Residents
there can buy food through a point sys
tem instead of on a specified number of
meals per week. Why couldn't that sys
tem be expanded to include Tresidder?
My meal card that works at Stem Hall
works at Sterling Quad and should be
assigned a point value, and students with
board plans would purchase food just as
they do at Sterling Quad.
Another problem with food service is
its inflexibility. Those of us who live in
University operated housing must pur
chase 19, 14 or 10 meals a week.
Besides obvious questions about
quality arising from the need to require
students to purchase a plan, the policy
forces students who could eat less expen
sively to shell out almost $1,000 a quarter
for meals.
And why is there such a small differ
ence in price between a 19- and 14-meal
plan? Winter quarter prices are $976 for
19 meals and $916 for 14 meals at most
of the big dorms. That means Food Serv
ice charges an average of about $5 per
meal. But with five meals less a week,

50 meals less a quarter turns out to be
only a $60 difference. I'm no techie, but
that math doesn't seem to work out.
The policy against carrying over extra
meals for the following week is also un
fair. Can you imagine a bank which re
quires its customers to spend all their
paychecks each week or lose their money?
It probably wouldn't give Wells Fargo
much competition. Yet Food Service has
adopted this use'em or lose'em policy be
cause they say without it, costs would be
even higher.
So taking away your extra meals is
actually good for you, kind of like how
reading a 250-page book each week-for
CIV helps you learn how to budget yourjJ»
time.
And since most students can't elect not>
to buy a board plan, I guess the missedjj
meals policy is the only way for dis-£
gruntled customers to let Food Service?
know how they feel.
Since Food Service bases it costs on a£
certain percentage of meals being missed*
each week, the best way to have an ad-£
verse financial effect on them would be**
for students to eat every single meal they*
have purchased.
I don't know if it is worth it.
