Homeless Kairos residents waited for minor repairs

THE PAST WEEKS after the
earthquake have been a very
trying time for the residents of
Kairos House, as they have been for
many other people.
While we remain sympathetic to the
administration and its offices, in the
last few days we discovered that there
was no reason that we shouldn't have
moved back into Kairos a week earlier
as Slavianskii Dom, Theta Chi House
and Haus Mitteleuropa did.
We moved in Saturday, and although
we are grateful, we feel the Universi
ty's decisions last week displayed total
disregard for our needs.
At a meeting with displaced students
on Oct. 20, the University tried its
utmost to inform students of the
status of their houses.
Kairos was on the list to open
within a week. We were surprised to
hear that some houses which we
thought had significantly more damage

than ours were opened within a few
hours.
Many times a day we went by Kairos
to see what work was being done.
None was. We were told to understand
that Kairos was "part of a bigger
project" and would be opened by Sat
urday, as promised.
Friday, the workers went to the
house. Toward the end of the day, we
asked them what they had done and
what they would finish that day.
They said that first, a week before,
they boarded up all the windows and
doors with plywood. Friday they had
done a "very small" amount of plaster
repair inside, shampooed the carpets,
washed the half-sink of dishes in the
kitchen, taken the plywood off the
doors and windows, and before the end
of the day would block off an unstable
portion of the front porch with
plywood.
We waited 11 davs for this?

Surely the cosmetic work could have
been completed while we lived there.
This was the pattern for many other
houses with damage worse than a very
little amount of cracked plaster and
dirty carpet.
Construction workers and Residence
Management Office (RMO) staff told us
around 5 p.m. Friday that all the work
had been completed on Kairos. At this
point, not only did we want to return
home, but the Housing Office needed
part of the Casa Zapata lounge, where
we had been staying, for other reasons.
We asked RMO to consider opening
Kairos that night to relieve everybody's
problems. They said simply that the
announced opening time, noon Satur
day, had been agreed upon and they
would stick to it, even though repairs
to Kairos were complete.
How could they make us sleep one
more night in a lounge just so that
they could open all the homes at once?

Living on the small floor of a lounge
with 20 people during school is not the
sort of thing one gets used to. A num
ber of us became sick and the rest of
us could get no more than a few hours
of sleep a night.
On the night of Oct. 20, certain
houses were opened the moment they
were ready for occupancy. By the time
we came along, this policy seemed to
have changed.
Did they think that after 10 days,
another night of displacement didn't
matter? It should have been just as
urgent Friday as it was a week before.
We see no reason that we should
have been locked out of our house for
11 days for a couple of hours of repair
work and a carpet shampoo. We fear
the underlying cause was the belittle
ment of our needs.
