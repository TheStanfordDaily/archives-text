# Some researchers care about animal rights, loved Rosie the dog
## 
### 
I write this letter to complete Rosie's
story, part of which has been covered
by The Daily Oct. 9 and several other
papers.
On Sept. 20, the life science tech
nicians at the Division of Laboratory
Animal Medicine (DLAM) at Stanford
were told, by our supervisor, that
Rosie the dog should be adopted within
one month or she would be put to
sleep. Twelve days later, on Oct. 2, we
were told that her last day would be
Oct. 6.
Puzzled by the brevity of the
"month," I nevertheless submitted my
application Oct. 5, since no one else

had applied to adopt her.
Contrary to what Animal Care Su
pervisor Reese Zasio implied, Rosie
continued being a companion to the
DLAM technicians after security
guards were hired.
In fact, our security guards (almost
all male) eryoyed her company, too,
until her run was needed for another
dog at Research Animal Facility a few
months before she was killed.
One remarked that had he known
she was so dangerous, he wouldn't
have let her slobber all over him.
Indeed, Rosie might very well have
licked you to death!
If she was no longer needed for
blood donation, why was blood collec
ted from her the week before she was
killed? Why was her run needed so
urgently when I counted several empty
runs in her facility the same week she
was killed, even after we received a

new shipment of dogs?
Why aren't the people who knew her
best, the animal caretakers and life
science technicians, consulted about her
disposition? Why couldn't alternatives
to death be discussed? Was it because
I, an outspoken member of United
Stanford Workers, asked to adopt her?
This image haunts me. I see Rosie
jumping up and down, tail wagging as
her executioner approaches, happy to
see him, unaware of his purpose.
She drops to her belly, head down,
in her usual submissive display as he
places a tourniquet around her foreleg.
She even tries to roll over on her back,
hoping for a little tummy-scratching.
Trustingly, she submits to having,
the needle placed in her vein like all
the other times she's given blood or
been ir\jected. This time, however, she
slumps, as the barbiturate overdose

takes effect. The sleek, animated
brown and white body and the big
brown eyes that I loved are forever
still.
I hope that the general public, after
reading Rosie's story, doesn't assume
that the entire research community
doesn't care about animals. That atti
tude is, fortunately, the exception.
The majority of people in my field
are compassionate, thoughtful people
who deserve your support. Please don't
condemn us all because of the callous
ness of DLAM director Tom Hamm
and a few others.
And thanks to all those who sup
ported me through this. It means a
lot, especially since I know so many of
you were afraid of retaliation by Uni
versity administrators.
