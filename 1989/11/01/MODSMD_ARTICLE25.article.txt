## Hoover showed 'political mission' by leading 'Reagan Revolution' 
### 
Hoover Fellow Ramon Myers
challenges me to prove that
Hoover Institution has a "politi
cal mission" (The Daily, Oct. 25).
I am glad he asked.
Myers argues that Hoover's alleged
political mission requires me to show
that scholars and publications at Hoo
ver confuse normative and empirical
thinking, thereby unfairly biasing
objective research.
This sounds to me like an invitation
to a witch hunt, which is why I have
always based the case against Hoover
on quite different evidence. Consider
the following:
President Hoover defined the mission
of his institution as follows: "The
purpose of this Institution must be, by
its research and publications, to dem
onstrate the evils of the doctrines of
Karl Marx ... to protect the American
way of life from such ideologies, their
conspiracies, and to reaffirm the
validity of the American way of life
from such ideologies."
This statement stands today un
repudiated by any Hoover director or
Hoover Board of Overseers.
Hoover's mission is carried out in
various ways. The op-ed program
distributes over 500 articles yearly to
more than 600 newspapers with a
circulation in excess of 64 million

Note that all of this evidence comes from Hoover's
own records, which perhaps explains why it has such
difficulty rebutting it. Hoover cannot have it both
ways: It cannot take credit for the 'Reagan Revolution'
and then deny it has a political mission.

("1988 Hoover Annual Report," p. 91).
Hoover has also recently announced
plans for a satellite link-up so that
media can tune into Stanford for policy
opinions, but perhaps the strongest
evidence of Hoover's mission is its role
in fostering the "Reagan Revolution."
When President Reagan was first
elected, Hoover director W. Glenn
Campbell announced in Hoover's An
nual Report, "The highlight of the past
year was the election of honorary
fellow Ronald W. Reagan as President
of the United States... . Since Presi
dent Reagan took office on January 29,
1981, more than 30 scholars and
former fellows of the Hoover Institu
tion have been requested to participate
in public service .. ." ("1981 Hoover
Annual Report," pp. 11-12). The figure
was later revised upward to 50.
Not to be outdone, Reagan declared,

"Under the leadership of your able
director Glenn Campbell, and with
hard work and diligence, you built the
knowledge base that made the changes
now taking place in Washington possi
ble" ("1982 Hoover Annual Report," p.
29).
A few years later, Reagan said:
"Politics, as much as anything else, is
a battle of ideas, and it was ideas —
many of them originating at the Hoo
ver Institution — that helped to over
throw what (Senior Research Fellow)
Milton Friedman has called the
'tyranny of the status quo"' ("Report
of the Hoover Board of Overseers,"
July 18, 1985, p. 2).
to complete the picture, Reagan
once admitted, "During the recent
campaign I called on more people from
the Institution to help with my cam
paign than from any other institution."

("1981 Hoover Annual Report," p. 25).
Note that all of this evidence comes
from Hoover's own records, which
perhaps explains why it has such
difficulty rebutting it.
Hoover cannot have it both ways: It
cannot take credit for the "Reagan
Revolution" and then deny it has a
political mission.
President Reagan has retired, W.
Glenn Campbell has been elevated to
Counselor, and University President
Donald Kennedy wants the Stanford
community to believe that a new era
of cooperation has broken out between
Hoover and the University.
But there is no reason to believe
that Hoover's mission has changed
(except cosmetically).
Consider the question of money.
When President Hoover, aided by
Stanford Trustee David Packard, se
cured the institution's independence in
1959, where did the money come from
to make Hoover one of the premier
conservative think tanks in the coun
try?
It came from conservatives. We know
this is true because of a study pub
lished by Hoover.
Msyor foundations were reluctant to
contribute to Hoover, but, George
Nash writes, that "might be true of
liberal foundations; it was not true of

conservative ones, which rallied to the
institution as never before" (George
Nash, "Herbert Hoover and Stanford
University," p. 156, italics his).
Conservative money continues to
pour into Hoover. No conservative
donor needs an explicit assurance from
Hoover that the money will be well
spent.
No Hoover director needs to tell an
individual scholar what to research. It
is simply understood on all sides —
and universally by the press — that
Hoover is generally conservative and
will remain so as long as it is indepen
dent of University control and conser
vative money helps define Hoover's
mission.
The Stanford community can learn a
lot about how money works here by
studying the words of Hoover benefac
tor David Packard, who once told
corporate supporters of universities
that money should not be given to
universities without strings, lest the
money fail to benefit stockholders and
not be used to educate "the right kind
of professors" (David Packard, "Cor
porate Support of the Private Univer
sities," transcribed from a speech given
in New York City, Oct. 17, 1973).

pour into Hoover. No conservative
donor needs an explicit assurance from
Hoover that the money will be well
spent.
No Hoover director needs to tell an
individual scholar what to research. It
is simply understood on all sides —
and universally by the press — that
Hoover is generally conservative and
will remain so as long as it is indepen
dent of University control and conser
vative money helps define Hoover's
mission.
The Stanford community can learn a
lot about how money works here by
studying the words of Hoover benefac
tor David Packard, who once told
corporate supporters of universities
that money should not be given to
universities without strings, lest the
money fail to benefit stockholders and
not be used to educate "the right kind
of professors" (David Packard, "Cor
porate Support of the Private Univer
sities," transcribed from a speech given
in New York City, Oct. 17, 1973).

Hoover Fellow Ramon Myers
challenges me to prove that
Hoover Institution has a "politi
cal mission" (The Daily, Oct. 25).
I am glad he asked.
Myers argues that Hoover's alleged
political mission requires me to show
that scholars and publications at Hoo
ver confuse normative and empirical
thinking, thereby unfairly biasing
objective research.
This sounds to me like an invitation
to a witch hunt, which is why I have
always based the case against Hoover
on quite different evidence. Consider
the following:
President Hoover defined the mission
of his institution as follows: "The
purpose of this Institution must be, by
its research and publications, to dem
onstrate the evils of the doctrines of
Karl Marx ... to protect the American
way of life from such ideologies, their
conspiracies, and to reaffirm the
validity of the American way of life
from such ideologies."
This statement stands today un
repudiated by any Hoover director or
Hoover Board of Overseers.
Hoover's mission is carried out in
various ways. The op-ed program
distributes over 500 articles yearly to
more than 600 newspapers with a
circulation in excess of 64 million

Note that all of this evidence comes from Hoover's
own records, which perhaps explains why it has such
difficulty rebutting it. Hoover cannot have it both
ways: It cannot take credit for the 'Reagan Revolution'
and then deny it has a political mission.

("1988 Hoover Annual Report," p. 91).
Hoover has also recently announced
plans for a satellite link-up so that
media can tune into Stanford for policy
opinions, but perhaps the strongest
evidence of Hoover's mission is its role
in fostering the "Reagan Revolution."
When President Reagan was first
elected, Hoover director W. Glenn
Campbell announced in Hoover's An
nual Report, "The highlight of the past
year was the election of honorary
fellow Ronald W. Reagan as President
of the United States... . Since Presi
dent Reagan took office on January 29,
1981, more than 30 scholars and
former fellows of the Hoover Institu
tion have been requested to participate
in public service .. ." ("1981 Hoover
Annual Report," pp. 11-12). The figure
was later revised upward to 50.
Not to be outdone, Reagan declared,

"Under the leadership of your able
director Glenn Campbell, and with
hard work and diligence, you built the
knowledge base that made the changes
now taking place in Washington possi
ble" ("1982 Hoover Annual Report," p.
29).
A few years later, Reagan said:
"Politics, as much as anything else, is
a battle of ideas, and it was ideas —
many of them originating at the Hoo
ver Institution — that helped to over
throw what (Senior Research Fellow)
Milton Friedman has called the
'tyranny of the status quo"' ("Report
of the Hoover Board of Overseers,"
July 18, 1985, p. 2).
to complete the picture, Reagan
once admitted, "During the recent
campaign I called on more people from
the Institution to help with my cam
paign than from any other institution."

("1981 Hoover Annual Report," p. 25).
Note that all of this evidence comes
from Hoover's own records, which
perhaps explains why it has such
difficulty rebutting it.
Hoover cannot have it both ways: It
cannot take credit for the "Reagan
Revolution" and then deny it has a
political mission.
President Reagan has retired, W.
Glenn Campbell has been elevated to
Counselor, and University President
Donald Kennedy wants the Stanford
community to believe that a new era
of cooperation has broken out between
Hoover and the University.
But there is no reason to believe
that Hoover's mission has changed
(except cosmetically).
Consider the question of money.
When President Hoover, aided by
Stanford Trustee David Packard, se
cured the institution's independence in
1959, where did the money come from
to make Hoover one of the premier
conservative think tanks in the coun
try?
It came from conservatives. We know
this is true because of a study pub
lished by Hoover.
Msyor foundations were reluctant to
contribute to Hoover, but, George
Nash writes, that "might be true of
liberal foundations; it was not true of

conservative ones, which rallied to the
institution as never before" (George
Nash, "Herbert Hoover and Stanford
University," p. 156, italics his).
