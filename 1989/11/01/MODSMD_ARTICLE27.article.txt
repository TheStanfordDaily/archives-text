## Ultrasound kills cancer cells Technique increases effectiveness of chemotherapy drug 
### Dan Sommerfield 
Stanford scientists have shown
that carefully focused ultrasound
waves may increase the effective
ness of certain types of chemo
therapy on cancerous cells.
The experiment, reported today
in the journal Cancer Research,
possibly represents a major step
forward in cancer treatment. The
research, performed by Radiation
Oncology Prof. George Hahn and
re search associate Alie Saad, is
the first conclusive evidence that
ultrasound can be used to enhance
the effectiveness of chemotherapy
treatment.
Researchers treated cancerous
cells with adriamycin, a common
chemotherapy drug, and at the
same time bombarded it with a
well-focused beam of ultrasound.
They found that cells absorb more
of the adriamycin, killing more of
the cancerous growth.
The research suggests that
adriamycin treatment may be
made less toxic to the human
body. In the previously used
therapy, much of the adriamycin
was not absorbed by the cells,
leaving it free to follow the
bloodstream to the heart. And
adriamycin is toxic to the heart.
"In the past, we could only give
a finite amount because of heart
toxicity," Hahn said in an inter
view. "We couldn't give enough to
eliminate a tumor." He said he
hopes by using ultrasound, doc
tors will eliminate tumors without
endangering the heart.
The research may have more
wide-reaching results in clinical
use. Hahn said ultrasound
therapy may be effective to treat
cancers in the head, neck' and
breast. Hahn has concentrated his
clinical research on breast cancer,
because "there adriamycin is
known to be effective, and you
Can easily heat and monitor
changes in [breast cancer]."
Since ultrasound cannot pene
trate bone, this method cannot be
used on many internal tumors.

But what really excites Hahn
is that the treatment can be used
on patients almost immediately.
"Usually you have to go through
extensive tests to prove to the
Food and Drug Administration
that the treatment is safe," he
said.
However, since adriamycin has
already been approved as cancer
medication by the FDA, and since
ultrasound is already used for
heat therapy of cancerous cells,
Hahn notes that "all these [ tests]
have essentially been done."
That means that the combina
tion of ultrasound and chemother
apy can be immediately applied
to patients if it continues to prove
effective in clinical studies.
Hahn conducted his first few
experiments using rodent cells in
a test tube. After success with
rodent cells, experiments have
shown that the procedure works
equally well on human cells in a
test tube.
Hahn and Saad said they do
not know why ultrasound works.
However, they have two hypoth
eses.
The first, which Hahn feels is
more accurate, is that the "sound
is a pressure wave, and as such
it should push more of the med
icine into the cell. And since the
membrane of the cell is asym
metric, it will not push the drug

back out."
Hahn points out an alternative
view, that the ultrasound "could
modify the membrane in such a
way that more drug can diffuse
in."
To support the second hypoth
esis, he cites evidence that more
of the drug still entered the cell
when the ultrasound was given
well before chemotherapy treat
ment. Ultrasound administered
well before the drug was not, how
ever, as effective as ultrasound
administered at the same time as
the drug.
The Stanford experiments are
the first successful research of
their kind of a small number of
failures at other institutions.
Hahn said the prior studies
probably failed because other re
searchers did not properly
monitor heat changes during ex
perimentation. This is necessary
because the ultrasound used in
the experiment — 100 times as
powerful as a typical diagnostic
ultrasound — greatly heats the
cells.
According to Hahn, "You have
to distinguish the effects of in
creased heat from the effects of
ultrasound. Here we have con
trolled temperature very care
fully, so we know that this is really
an effect of ultrasound and not
heat."
