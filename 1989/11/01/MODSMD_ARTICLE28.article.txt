# Three organ transplant drugs yield early, hopeful promises
## 
### Joanne Sosinska 
Since organ transplants began
more than 35 years ago, physi
cians have been busy searching
for a miracle drug which would
prevent transplant rejection but
not weaken the immune system.
Though far from a miracle,
three new drugs show promise
for researchers at the Labora
tory of Transplant Immunology
in the Department of Cardiovas
cular Surgery. All three drugß
are still in the testing stages
but have proven highly effective
in laboratory animals.
Ironically, the greatest danger
to transplant patients is their
own over protective immune
system. In a healthy individual,
the system efficiently seeks out
and destroys foreign viruses and
micro organisms, thereby pro
tecting the body from disease.
This same process, however,
mistakenly identifies the trans
planted organ as a threat and
launches an immunological at
tack against it.
From the early '60s to the
early '80s, a drug called azat
hioprine and certain kinds of
steroids were used exclusively
in suppressing the effect of the
harmful T-cell that is responsi
ble for organ rejection. These
early medications were broadly
effective. By inhibiting the nor
mal defensive function of other
immune cells as well, they left
the body vulnerable to infection
and cancer.
Following an accidental dis
covery in the late '70s, the more
selective drug cyclosporine be
came the most widely used im
munosuppressive drug in
transplantation. It offered hope
to younger and older patients
who were previously at the
greatest risk of death from dis
eases caused by a weakened im
mune system. But even
cyclosporine is far from a

miracle. It requires years of
powerful medication, with a still
less-than-satisfactory success
rate.
Recently, however, several dis
coveries have stirred optimism
among researchers. Dr. Randall
Morris, director of the Stanford
Transplant Immunology Labo
ratory, has been working for the
past several years on "develop
ing a drug which will pinpoint
those components of the im
mune system most important
for suppressing graft rejection."
In August, Morris unveiled
three experimental medications
to the International Congress of
Immunology in Berlin that are
currently being tested in his lab
oratory: FK-506, RPM, and
protein lectins, which actually
boost the immune system rather
than weaken it.
FK-506, the first oral anti
rejection drug, is closest to clini
cal use. Unlike earlier drugs
that were borrowed from other
medicines, FK-506 was "the
first one developed for intent in
transplantation," says Morris.
Related to the common an
tibiotic erythromycin, it was
conceived in a Japanese
pharmaceutical company that
began testing fungal extracts for
immunosuppressive effect.
Rodent testing with FK-506
has proved highly successful
and revealed it to be nearly 20
times more active than
cyclosporine, even with smaller
doses. Most important, unlike
cylcosporine, FK-506 has the
ability to fight severe rejection
even in the advanced stage. This
alleviates the need for more
toxic medications that can
severely damage other organs.
Although still several months
away from primate testing, the
second drug also shows great
potential. RPM, or Rapamicyn,

is a rather exotic fungal product
obtained from soil on Easter Is
land. By inhibiting white blood
cell division, a prerequisite for
organ rejection, it suppresses
the T-cell without actually
wiping it out.
"It is the most potent im
munosuppressive drug," Morris
sayß. "Being 50 times stronger
than cyclosporine, even one dose
will prolong rejection for up to
a hundred days."
In the earliest stages of de
velopment, lectins are the third
drug studied at the immunology
laboratory. Easily obtained from
plant and animal tissue, lectins
are protein molecules that boost
rather than depress the immune
system.
By attaching themselves to
sugars on immune cell surfaces
"they can be a co-active ally in
fighting organ rejection," Mor
ris comments.
Lectins promote the growth
of one part of the immune sys
tem that actually regulates T
cell suppression. Consequently,
they enhance this "check and
balance" action of the system
and thus are able to curtail re
jection. "In an active immune
system, there has been long
term survival, even long after
treatment has stopped," Morris
says.
Though neither of these drugß
is ready for the bedside, Morris
and his colleagues are anticipat
ing positive results soon. Every
day that Morris re-enters the
lab, he anxiously checks the
progress of all the animals.
"It's almost like Christmas
every morning," he comments
chearfully. The ordinary fungus
that grows on Easter Island
could, after all, turn out to be
the miracle cure that many
patients have so desperately
needed.

tibiotic erythromycin, it was
conceived in a Japanese
pharmaceutical company that
began testing fungal extracts for
immunosuppressive effect.
Rodent testing with FK-506
has proved highly successful
and revealed it to be nearly 20
times more active than
cyclosporine, even with smaller
doses. Most important, unlike
cylcosporine, FK-506 has the
ability to fight severe rejection
even in the advanced stage. This
alleviates the need for more
toxic medications that can
severely damage other organs.
Although still several months
away from primate testing, the
second drug also shows great
potential. RPM, or Rapamicyn,

is a rather exotic fungal product
obtained from soil on Easter Is
land. By inhibiting white blood
cell division, a prerequisite for
organ rejection, it suppresses
the T-cell without actually
wiping it out.
"It is the most potent im
munosuppressive drug," Morris
sayß. "Being 50 times stronger
than cyclosporine, even one dose
will prolong rejection for up to
a hundred days."
In the earliest stages of de
velopment, lectins are the third
drug studied at the immunology
laboratory. Easily obtained from
plant and animal tissue, lectins
are protein molecules that boost
rather than depress the immune
system.
By attaching themselves to
sugars on immune cell surfaces
"they can be a co-active ally in
fighting organ rejection," Mor
ris comments.
Lectins promote the growth
of one part of the immune sys
tem that actually regulates T
cell suppression. Consequently,
they enhance this "check and
balance" action of the system
and thus are able to curtail re
jection. "In an active immune
system, there has been long
term survival, even long after
treatment has stopped," Morris
says.
Though neither of these drugß
is ready for the bedside, Morris
and his colleagues are anticipat
ing positive results soon. Every
day that Morris re-enters the
lab, he anxiously checks the
progress of all the animals.
"It's almost like Christmas
every morning," he comments
chearfully. The ordinary fungus
that grows on Easter Island
could, after all, turn out to be
the miracle cure that many
patients have so desperately
needed.
Since organ transplants began
more than 35 years ago, physi
cians have been busy searching
for a miracle drug which would
prevent transplant rejection but
not weaken the immune system.
Though far from a miracle,
three new drugs show promise
for researchers at the Labora
tory of Transplant Immunology
in the Department of Cardiovas
cular Surgery. All three drugß
are still in the testing stages
but have proven highly effective
in laboratory animals.
Ironically, the greatest danger
to transplant patients is their
own over protective immune
system. In a healthy individual,
the system efficiently seeks out
and destroys foreign viruses and
micro organisms, thereby pro
tecting the body from disease.
This same process, however,
mistakenly identifies the trans
planted organ as a threat and
launches an immunological at
tack against it.
From the early '60s to the
early '80s, a drug called azat
hioprine and certain kinds of
steroids were used exclusively
in suppressing the effect of the
harmful T-cell that is responsi
ble for organ rejection. These
early medications were broadly
effective. By inhibiting the nor
mal defensive function of other
immune cells as well, they left
the body vulnerable to infection
and cancer.
Following an accidental dis
covery in the late '70s, the more
selective drug cyclosporine be
came the most widely used im
munosuppressive drug in
transplantation. It offered hope
to younger and older patients
who were previously at the
greatest risk of death from dis
eases caused by a weakened im
mune system. But even
cyclosporine is far from a

miracle. It requires years of
powerful medication, with a still
less-than-satisfactory success
rate.
Recently, however, several dis
coveries have stirred optimism
among researchers. Dr. Randall
Morris, director of the Stanford
Transplant Immunology Labo
ratory, has been working for the
past several years on "develop
ing a drug which will pinpoint
those components of the im
mune system most important
for suppressing graft rejection."
In August, Morris unveiled
three experimental medications
to the International Congress of
Immunology in Berlin that are
currently being tested in his lab
oratory: FK-506, RPM, and
protein lectins, which actually
boost the immune system rather
than weaken it.
FK-506, the first oral anti
rejection drug, is closest to clini
cal use. Unlike earlier drugs
that were borrowed from other
medicines, FK-506 was "the
first one developed for intent in
transplantation," says Morris.
