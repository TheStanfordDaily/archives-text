Young transplant patient
A 1-year-old boy became the second
youngest heart-lung transplant recipient
at Stanford Medical Center — and one
of the four youngest in the United States
— in a four-hour operation last week.
Andrew Bartczak of Dalton, Ga., had
been waiting since August for a
transplant and he finally received one
Thursday morning.
"I don't think it's quite hit home yet,"
said Angela Bartczak, his mother. "I
cried once."
Andrew had hypoplastic left-heart
syndrome, a condition characterized by
extremely thin aortas, and without the
transplant would have had little chance
of living much beyond the age of 2 years.
The operation was performed by Dr.
Vincent Starnes, head of Stanford's
heart-lung transplant program and one
of the world's leading experts on heart
lung transplants. Andrew's new heart
and lungs came from a 15-month-old
Southern California infant. A Stanford
team flew to Southern California Wed
nesday night to pick up the organs.
Diarrhea vaccine testing
Stanford researchers are testing a vac
cine that may offer protection against
the most common cause of diarrhea.
The target of the vaccine is a
rotavirus, which causes diarrhea in
young children worldwide, said Asst.
Prof, of Pediatrics Yvonne Maldonado,
who is principal investigator in the
study.
Diarrhea has been a devastating dis
ease in the Third World, killing over 5
million children each year. In the United
States, the rotavirus is thought to ac
count for the majority of pediatric
hospitalizations for diarrhea and
dehydration. Diarrhea "costs more than

$25 million a year for hospitalizations
and in lost worktime when parents stay
home to care for sick children," Mal
donado said.
Because the virus usually attacks
children under one year old, the re
searchers are planning to administer the
vaccine in three oral doses at 2, 4 and
6 months of age. Children in the study
will be divided into three groups: one
group getting a placebo, a second group
getting a vaccine against the most com
mon strain of rotavirus and a third
group getting vaccine protecting against
all four known strains.
Testing new AIDS drugs
Stanford scientists are studying two
experimental drugs that may offer ef
fective alternatives to AZT and DDI in
the treatment of AIDS and AIDS-related
complex.
One drug, called CD4, is a decoy to
lure AIDS virus particles away from
blood cells they seek to infect. According
to Mark Holodniy, postdoctoral fellow
in the division of infectious diseases, in
a recent study of CD4 at Stanford, re
searchers found the drug is much less
toxic than AZT and its chemical cousin
DDC. AZT is currently the only AIDS
drug that has received Food and Drug
Administration approval for widespread
use.
The other new drug to be tested at
Stanford is called SC-48334. The drug
alters the ability of the AIDS virus to
bind to susceptible cells.
The tests will be relatively short; 12
weeks for CD4 and only four weeks for
SC-48334. Because of the short duration,
participants will later be eligible to par
ticipate in trials of DDI.
People interested in participating in
either study may call the AIDS Clinical
Trial Group at 723-6231.
