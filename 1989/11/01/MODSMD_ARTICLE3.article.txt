# Oak tree reforestation project underway for Foothills
## 
### Vivian Louie 
Every Saturday morning in November,
people will be out in the Foothills helping
oak trees grow, as they have for the past
five years.
The Foothills are being planted with
Valley Oak, Blue Oak and Coast Live
Oak seeds as part of an ongoing oak
regeneration project being carried out by
the organization Magic, which is under
contract to the Stanford Planning Office.
This year, the reforestation plantings
will be called Peninsula ReLeaf and are
being organized in conjunction with Cal

ifornia ReLeaf, a statewide organization.
At least 450 volunteers are currently in
volved in Peninsula ReLeaf.
Recognizing that the oak population in
the Foothills was declining, the staff of
the Planning Office worked with consult
ants to formulate the Vegetation Man
agement Plan in 1983. The plan laid out
recommendations for how to reseed and
revegetate the areas.
According to Judy Chan, associate di
rector of planning, Magic was contracted
to "collect and install seedlings in desig
nated areas in consultation with our of
fice and to monitor the program."

Participants in Peninsula ReLeaf col
lect acorns, put them in the ground, sur
round them with wire mesh to keep the
rodents out and water them periodically.
According to Dave Muffley, a full-time
intern at Magic, the Foothills area poses
some special problems. Rodents have had
a population explosion since development
chased away larger, predatory mammals,
and they've been eating many of the
acorns the Peninsula ReLeaf people hoped
would grow into new trees.
In fact, Muffley says, the rodents even
were eating through the aluminum wire
mesh that protected the acorns once they

were planted.
Both Magic and the Planning Office
say that with a switch this year to steel
wire, which is stronger than aluminum,
the acorns will survive and become little
trees by next spring.
According to Muffley, the Foothills
were once covered with oak trees. But
the combination of development and
cattle who loved to eat young trees has
left the region bare of new trees to replace
the dying ones.
Muffley called the Peninsula ReLeaf
effort in the Foothills, "What nature
would have done had man not interrupted

the ecosystem with development and
cattle grazing."
Magic, a Palo Alto nonprofit organiza
tion, was founded 10 years ago to research
and teach human ecology.
Muffley noted of tree planting: "It helps
teach people about nature."
Magic also saw the looming crisis in
the "greenhouse effect." Muffley said,
"TreeB are the best way to combat the
greenhouse effect that we know of."
The ultimate goal of Peninsula ReLeaf
is to plant one tree per person by the
year 2000. So far, it has planted nearly
1,000 surviving trees.
