# Stanford's hi-IQ insect is stumped
## The 						intrepid Science Bug downs the beer but can't face the coffee 
### Megan Beardsley Staff writer 
Q. I've noticed that when I take a
• not-entirely-full bottle of beer and
tap it five times with a glass — once
on the left side, once on the right, once
on the back, once on the front, and
finally, once solidly on the top — the
beer dribbles and foams out of the bottle.
Why is this, oh science goddess ?
A. First of all, I didn't make up the
• "science goddess" stuff. This ques
tion was penciled by a real live wor
shipping follower. It's kind of nice
though; maybe I can change the name
of the column.
As for the beer trick, it's not as su
pernatural as it seems. (The real ques
tion is, Why tap your beer bottles when
you can drink from them? Maybe you
should consider switching to a better
tasting brand.)
Beer foams up because it's car
bonated. It's full of dissolved carbon
dioxide, exhaled by all the little yeast
microbes as they turn wholesome grains
into nefarious alcohol.
If the beer is capped and sits quietly,
the carbon dioxide stays dissolved in
the liquid. If the beer is open and sits
quietly, the gas seeps out slowly and
eventually you've got a flat beer — yuck.
But when the beer is agitated, the
carbon dioxide comes quickly out of so
lution and floats to the top. (A nice
solid tap should do it, or, as I saw amply
demonstrated by a 2-year-old at a beach
picnic last month, the addition of a tea
spoon full of sand.)
According to Mark Carpenter, assis
tant brewmaster at the Anchor Steam
brewery in San Francisco, foam is
created when the escaping gas gets
coated with "skins" of beer protein.
Next time you are sitting back with
a few friends and a nice bottle of brew,
you can watch the bubbles floating to

the top and talk about this column —
or not.
Q. After an especially grueling round
•of papers or midterms, lots of
Stanford students boast of how little
they've slept and how much caffeine
they've ingested in the last few days or
weeks.
Anyhow, on one of those late nights
(actually very early mornings) of coffee
guzzling, I began to think about holding
an espresso drinking contest. The win
ner would be the person who drank the
most in a limited amount of time, say
10 minutes.
My question is, what would be the
health implications of such a contest ?
A .To answer this question, I called
• over to the Stanford Medical Cen
ter. To my surprise, there don't seem
to be any researchers force-feeding mice
with fine European espresso.

Beer is full of dissolved
carbon dioxide, exhaled
by the little yeast
microbes as they turn
wholesome grains into
nefarious alcohol.

Eventually I got in touch with a nice
woman at the Drug Information Center
who could not seem to understand why
anyone would participate in such a con
test. I tried desperately to explain, but
I don't think she ever caught on.
She did put me in touch with the
Poison Center at the Santa Clara Med
ical Center who told me a little bit about
cafTeine in general.
Basically it's nasty stuff. It affects
the central nervous system, and could
lead to heart fluttering and headaches.
It also increases the acidity of the
stomach and can cause nausea or
stomach bleeding.
About 400 mg of caffeine — the equiv
alent of four cafTeine pills or four strong
cups of coffee — can make your heart
beat significantly faster than normal.
Doses above that range exaggerate the
effects.
While all this information may make
you hesitant to enter in an espresso
drinking contest, it still doesn't really
answer the question.
Anyone with further information on
espresso-drinking contests or any other
question about science is asked to submit
it to the Science Bug box outside the
Daily office or write to Stanford Daily,
