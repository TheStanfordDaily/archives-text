## Cardinal water polo primed for No.1 Cal 
### T.C. Hall Staff writer 
The situation is easy to understand.
Stanford hates California, and they hate
Stanford. Rivalry does that to people.
Tonight at 7 p.m. the hatred moves
across the Bay to Berkeley in the form of
water polo, and the game means more than
just a mutual dislike — it has to do with
rankings.
The game today is a battle for regional
and national prominence. The 19-2 Cali
fornia Golden Bears are the number one
team in the land, and they lead the Pacific
Ten Conference with a perfect 3-0 record.
Stanford, 23-6, is ranked No. 4 in the
country and No. 2 in the Pac-10. Stanford
is 2-1 in Pac-10 play due to a 10-9 overtime
upset loss to USC.
The teams have played twice already,
and the series is tied 1-1. Stanford beat
California Sept. 9 in the season opener
10-8, and California beat Stanford 7-6 Sun
day in the finals of the Pac-10/Big West
tournament.
In the time between games Stanford fell
from a pre-season No. 1 ranking to No. 6
before climbing back to its present position.
With four more games left in the season

the Cardinal is assured of an NCAA berth,
but is more concerned on where it gets
placed in the seedings.
"We really want to get back into the top
three nationally," Coach Dante Dettamanti
said. "It does not matter being four or five
because they play each other anyway."
The top three teams in the national tour
nament all play non-California opponents
in the first round. If Stanford stays No. 4
it will more than likely play fifth-ranked
UCLA.
"We don't want to play UCLA in the
first round," said Dettamanti.
The coach would rather not play any
California school in the first round, but
his team has to move up in the rankings
first.
"Our goals now are to get back into the
top three and win the Pac-10's, " Det
tamanti said.
