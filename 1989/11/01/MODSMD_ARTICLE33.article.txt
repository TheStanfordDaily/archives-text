# Determined Johnson to direct recovery for Cardinal
## 
### 
Though the Stanford football team
is in the midst of a bitterly disap
pointing season, they can be thank
ful for one thing: Brian Johnson is still
around.
Johnson, the Cardinal's once and fu
ture starter at quarterback, will be lined
up behind center Rick Pallow this Sat
urday if all goes as planned. He's being
asked to pick up a team in desperate
need of an emotional lift.
And he's been there many times before.
Johnson was there as a freshman, when
he turned around an 0-4 team and led
them to five wins in seven tries.
He was there this season when he
sparked Stanford's heroic comeback
against Oregon. Right now, that victory
stands as the only thing guaranteeing
1989 won't be a winless year for the
Cardinal.
1 This time, his task is even more daunt
ing. In the remaining three games, Stan
ford can either rise to the occasion and
salvage something to take into the off

season or the squad can throw in the
towel and wind up 1-10.
Somehow, some way, B.J. is going to
see to it that the latter doesn't happen.
In all honesty, I'm not sure why I feel
this way. Watching Johnson on the field
is an endless rollercoaster ride. At times
he looks brilliant — rolling out and zip
ping the ball downfield to Ed McCaffrey
or Walter Batson.
Then there are the times he makes
you want to beat your head against the

wall — leading the Cardinal inside the
20 only to throw a goal line interception.
It's in the intangibles, though, where
Johnson really shines. Everyone feels
good about B.J. Fans and players alike
believe he's going to get the job done.
When Johnson gets into the game he
makes things happen in a hurry, as well.
It doesn't take him two or three drives
to start hooking up with his receivers.
Instead, it seems he immediately has the
team headed for the end zone.
Then there's the leadership factor.
When Johnson crouches down in the
huddle, he's not just one of the guys;
he's the center of attention. Johnson is
able to instantly command everyone's re
spect and direct them for the next play.
It's not that the team doesn't believe
in Steve Smith. It's just that Johnson's
experience and dynamic personality are
the right ingredients at this time for a
1-7 football team that needs a wakeup
call.
Finally, Johnson tells it like it is. Asked

to pinpoint the squad's problem in '89,
he simply says, "When a team goes
through a season like this, there's a mil
lion answers."
He describes an "energy you need dur
ing games when you get to crunch time"
that's been in short supply this year.
At the same time, Johnson is joined
by many of his teammates in seeing a
bright future for Cardinal football. "This
program has already been turned
around," he says. "Coach Green and his
staff have already [done that]."
He calls the coaches "top notch" and
cites them as a key reason why the team's
attitude and optimism runs so high.
Johnson is also quick to be realistic.
"Our expectations were very high for the
season," he says. "But we've run into
hard times ... been very unlucky." *
That bad luck, translated fcjr' Irtjurites,
may finally be changing. Rob Hinckley
is back near full strength and Jon Volpe
may very well see action this weekend.
Johnson has a shot at a professional

baseball career with the New York
Yankees and many feel he won't jeopar
dize that chance by returning for his
senior year.
At the moment, though, it seems more
likely than not that Johnson will be back
for another go round. "Right now my
attitude is that I will be back here unless
1 feel it will be better ... not to be."
Surprisingly, the fact that Johnson
hasn't played much this season is one of
factors in favor of his return. He says,
"If I had started all 11 games, there's
no guarantee I'd be back anyway."
It's almost as if Johnson feels he has
something to prove and he didn't get a
chance to do that this season. For that
reason, the idea of playing quarterback
for another year — and proving he can
get the job done — appeals to the fiery
competitor h\ him.
Maybe that competitor will take the
field Saturday and turn things around
for the Cardinal. For that, many would
be thankful.

Though the Stanford football team
is in the midst of a bitterly disap
pointing season, they can be thank
ful for one thing: Brian Johnson is still
around.
Johnson, the Cardinal's once and fu
ture starter at quarterback, will be lined
up behind center Rick Pallow this Sat
urday if all goes as planned. He's being
asked to pick up a team in desperate
need of an emotional lift.
And he's been there many times before.
Johnson was there as a freshman, when
he turned around an 0-4 team and led
them to five wins in seven tries.
He was there this season when he
sparked Stanford's heroic comeback
against Oregon. Right now, that victory
stands as the only thing guaranteeing
1989 won't be a winless year for the
Cardinal.
1 This time, his task is even more daunt
ing. In the remaining three games, Stan
ford can either rise to the occasion and
salvage something to take into the off

season or the squad can throw in the
towel and wind up 1-10.
Somehow, some way, B.J. is going to
see to it that the latter doesn't happen.
In all honesty, I'm not sure why I feel
this way. Watching Johnson on the field
is an endless rollercoaster ride. At times
he looks brilliant — rolling out and zip
ping the ball downfield to Ed McCaffrey
or Walter Batson.
Then there are the times he makes
you want to beat your head against the

wall — leading the Cardinal inside the
20 only to throw a goal line interception.
It's in the intangibles, though, where
Johnson really shines. Everyone feels
good about B.J. Fans and players alike
believe he's going to get the job done.
When Johnson gets into the game he
makes things happen in a hurry, as well.
It doesn't take him two or three drives
to start hooking up with his receivers.
Instead, it seems he immediately has the
team headed for the end zone.
Then there's the leadership factor.
When Johnson crouches down in the
huddle, he's not just one of the guys;
he's the center of attention. Johnson is
able to instantly command everyone's re
spect and direct them for the next play.
It's not that the team doesn't believe
in Steve Smith. It's just that Johnson's
experience and dynamic personality are
the right ingredients at this time for a
1-7 football team that needs a wakeup
call.
Finally, Johnson tells it like it is. Asked

to pinpoint the squad's problem in '89,
he simply says, "When a team goes
through a season like this, there's a mil
lion answers."
He describes an "energy you need dur
ing games when you get to crunch time"
that's been in short supply this year.
At the same time, Johnson is joined
by many of his teammates in seeing a
bright future for Cardinal football. "This
program has already been turned
around," he says. "Coach Green and his
staff have already [done that]."
He calls the coaches "top notch" and
cites them as a key reason why the team's
attitude and optimism runs so high.
Johnson is also quick to be realistic.
"Our expectations were very high for the
season," he says. "But we've run into
hard times ... been very unlucky." *
That bad luck, translated fcjr' Irtjurites,
may finally be changing. Rob Hinckley
is back near full strength and Jon Volpe
may very well see action this weekend.
Johnson has a shot at a professional

baseball career with the New York
Yankees and many feel he won't jeopar
dize that chance by returning for his
senior year.
At the moment, though, it seems more
likely than not that Johnson will be back
for another go round. "Right now my
attitude is that I will be back here unless
1 feel it will be better ... not to be."
Surprisingly, the fact that Johnson
hasn't played much this season is one of
factors in favor of his return. He says,
"If I had started all 11 games, there's
no guarantee I'd be back anyway."
It's almost as if Johnson feels he has
something to prove and he didn't get a
chance to do that this season. For that
reason, the idea of playing quarterback
for another year — and proving he can
get the job done — appeals to the fiery
competitor h\ him.
Maybe that competitor will take the
field Saturday and turn things around
for the Cardinal. For that, many would
be thankful.
