# Seniors lead booters in season finale
## Antonucci, Elliott, Howick and Martin mark end of old era 
### Michael Clayton Staff writer 
| Only four players on the Stan
ford women's soccer squad remain
from the dismal days when Helen
JKeohane directed the team. After
loday, that number will be down
ito zero.
} Seniors Tonya Antonucci, Blair
Jenny Howick and Chris
itine Martin will suit up in the
Cardinal uniform for the final
time this afternoon against the
University of San Francisco at
2:30 p.m. on Negoesco Field. For
; these four players, the impact of
'putting on a Stanford women's
! soccer uniform has changed dram
| atically since their freshman year.
« "Playing women's soccer used
I to be more of a social thing here,"
; Martin said. "The seriousness of
•the program since my early years
! has grown tremendously."

Along with the growth of the
seriousness in the Stanford pro
gram, the team skill level and tac
tics have also developed rapidly
since 1986.
According to Elliott, the quality
of the recent recruiting classes as
well as the "incredible" teaching
abilities of Coach Berhane An
deberhan have raised the playing
level of everyone on the team.
"One of the highlights of my
soccer career here at Stanford was
when we got Berhane as our
coach," Elliott said.
Unfortunately, Elliott's Stan
ford career ended a little sooner
than she had hoped. A starting
fullback, she hurt her back early
in last Tuesday's game against
North Carolina and has had to
sit out the remainder of the
season.
"It was a bummer not to play
this last weekend (against Wis

consin and UC Santa Barbara),"
Elliott said. "It was hard to sit
on the side knowing that I
couldn't help in two games which
determined our playoff chances."
The NCAA tournament com
mittee's decision not to invite No.
19 Stanford hurt these four sen
iors the most. After playing inte
gral roles in the changing face of
the Cardinal program, they just
missed their last chance to par
ticipate in postseason play.
"It's frustrating to know our
participation will be over at this
point in the program," Antonucci
said. "We felt that we were the
type of team that if we had been
chosen for the playoffs, we could
have caused a lot of problems.
When we're on, we can't be
stopped."
The four players did participate,
however, in this season's
landmark tie with No. 1 North

Carolina. Martin commented that
the tie showed Stanford had the
ability to compete against the top
team in the nation. In contrast,
the Tar Heels did not even want
to play against the Cardinal when
Martin was a freshman.
"The tie with North Carolina
shows, in retrospect, how far the
program has come," Antonucci
said. "In my early years, to play
North Carolina tough would have
been acceptable to dream about.
It's incredibly exciting to be part
of the reality which captured it."
For some of these seniors, the
progress of the program
demanded that they sacrifice
some playing time to the younger,
talented recruiting classes.
Elliott, who played forward her
freshman season at Stanford,
moved to the fullback position in
1987 in order to contribute more
to the team.
Martin had to adjust this year.
After starting all of the games in
the first half of the season at
fullback, Martin did not start
toward the end of the season.
The younger players who have
Eushed the program to a new level
ave instilled a new attitude in
the Stanford women's soccer pro
gram. Antonucci noted that wom
en's soccer players have changed
from students who came to play
soccer as an addendum to their
study schedule into student
athletes who have made a com
mitment to balance out the
athletics along with the academ
ics.

• against USF, but the Cardinal should come out on fire for their season finale.
Antonucci, the team's leading
scorer in 1987, has scored four
goals this season, and she will be
looking to cap off her career today
with a strong performance against
the Dons.
"As a team member, in order
to be prepared for the game, I am
trying to approach this game with
as few emotions as possible," An
tonucci said. "As a senior, I am
feeling a bit more emotion, some

strange feelings that I knew
would come — so many great
things have happened since I
started here."
Martin, the team's co-captain
along with Antonucci, began to
feel those emotions while playing
her last home game at Maloney
Field on Sunday.
"After this, there's not much
out there at this level," Martin
said. "I still love the game more
than anything, and with so many
close friends playing for the team
next year, it's going to be hard
not to be there."
