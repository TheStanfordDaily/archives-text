# Someone's losing streak bound to end
## 
### Chris Crader Editorial staff 
Two differing types of frustra
tion will meet this weekend at
Stanford Stadium and while no
one knows which is worse, both
kinds are bad.
On the one hand, the Stanford
Cardinal has lost an inordinate
number of starters to injury this
year and has not been able to
live up to the team and coaching
staffs expectations.
On the other, the UCLA
Bruins have been unable to live
up to outside expectations. The
Bruins have won bowl games in
seven consecutive years, but at
3-5 this season, the odds are bas
ically zero that the streak will
continue.
"Obviously we're in a situa
tion we're very unfamiliar with
— having a losing year and
dealing with the frustrations,"
UCLA Coach Terry Donahue
said. "I didn't anticipate we'd be
in as bad a shape as we are when
the season began."
UCLA has lost its last three
games, each by one point, to fall
to 2-3 in the Pacific 10 Confer
ence. The Cardinal goes into the
weekend 1-7 overall and 1-4 in
the Pac-10.
"There aren't many people in
the league who can lose six
starters and still be one of the
top teams," Stanford Coach
Denny Green said. "I think it's
just a big disappointment. I don't
think it's something we can't re
bound from. We haven't lost con
fidence from it. It's just disap
pointing."
The Bruins are on their way
to their worst season since 1979.
That year they also got off to a
3-5 start, then defeated Arizona
State and Oregon before losing
to USC. The Cardinal is hoping
history doesn't repeat itself and
will oppose the Bruins with as
many healthy bodies as Green
can find.
The good news for Stanford
is that outside linebacker Rob
Hinckley is back. Hinckley made
a name for himself against
UCLA last year, making 20
tackles, including seven for
losses, and sacked then

quarterback Troy Aikman 4V2
times. Hinckley was named the
Sports Illustrated Defensive
Player of the Week for the effort.
This year Hinckley injured his
back in the first quarter of the
game against San Jose State and
missed the next three games. He
returned to the starting lineup
for the game against USC last
Saturday and recorded four
tackles.
"It's kind of hard when you
see your first live stuff,"
Hinckley said. "You put your
pads on and everything seems a
little too quick for you. Rut you
adjust pretty quickly."
Another bright spot for the
Cardinal could be the return of
tailback Jon Volpe. Volpe, a first
team All-Pac-10 selection last
year, has missed most of the
season with a knee sprain. He
underwent arthroscopic surgery
Oct. 11 and is listed as ques
tionable. The Bruin defense is
currently last in the conference
against the run but first against
the pass.
It would clearly be something

the Cardinal should attempt to
take advantage of, but with
Volpe out, Stanford is last in the
Pac-10 in rushing. In fact the
Cardinal's total of 509 yards on
the ground leaves the team with
fewer rushing yards than six
players in the league.
Volpe, who has only played in
two of Stanford's eight games
this year, is still second on the
team in rushing. Furthermore,
the injury bug has been so wide
spread that no running back has
played in every game.
Despite this, Green thinks the
fullback tandem of Tom Vardell
and Scott Eschelman, and the
tailback troika of Galen Foster,
Jay Jay Lasley and Volpe (if he's
healthy), will succeed against
UCLA. "They have been some
what susceptable to the running
game," Green said. "We hope to
get our ground game going."
The Cardinal will have do it
behind a juggled offensive line.
Starting guard Chris Dalman is
having surgery on his neck Fri
day and will be out for the
season, and tackle John

Carpenter has been a little bit
slowed by an ankle injury as
well. Chuck Gillingham was
switched from center to guard
before the USC game and true
freshman Rick Pallow took over
the starting center spot.
"The move we made, moving
Chuck to guard and putting in
Rick Pallow at center, we feel is
probably the best one for us,"
Green said.
The rest of the Cardinal lineup
remains basically the same, with
Kevin Scott staying at free safety
and Albert Richardson in Scott's
old spot at cornerback. Green
did say, however, that Brian
Johnson will start at quarter
back if he is healthy. Johnson
did not even make the trip to
Los Angeles due to a sore shoul
der and a bruised knee.
"We are looking forward to our
last three games," Green said.
"We look at them as opportuni
ties. We're playing three teams
that think they can beat Stan
ford and we're playing three
teams we think we have a chance
to beat."
