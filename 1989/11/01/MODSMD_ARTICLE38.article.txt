# Italy flunks out on sports culture test

Debbie Spander is studying at Stan
ford's campus in Florence, Italy. While
she has enjoyed the enriching Floren
tine culture, she misses the excitement
of American athletics.
Florence can't be beaten for
European culture.
Museums, Renaissance
churches, crowded piazzas and
piano bars fill the city. Medieval
towers lean precariously over
Victorian palaces and Gucci
stores.
Not all is perfect, however, in
the land of Michelangelo.
Florence leaves much to be
desired for the American sports
fan.
Not only is there no baseball,
Stanford football, NFL or NBA,
there is little press coverage of
American athletics. Even in the
English-language papers, Euro
peans just don't seem to care if
the first-ever Bay Bridge World
Series is going on, or if Larry
Bird is attempting a comeback.
In Florence, soccer is king.
But Stanford students are just
not able to join in the local ex
citement over Milan's defeat of
Madrid for a spot in the second
World Cup qualifying round.
Other than soccer, Italy is
lean in organized athletics. Oc
casional tennis tournaments are
televised — delayed of course.
For instance, the U.S. Open was
shown in October.
Danny Ferry, who left the Los
Angeles Clippers to play in Italy
for Massagerro Roma, is fol
lowed by international news
services, but most Italians don't
pay too much attention to bas
ketball. There also is some sort
of a volleyball league, but where
and when it plays remains a
mystery.
Stanford students interested
in American athletics must
catch any tidbit available —
which is definitely easier said
than done. Students daily fight
over the campus copy of the In
ternational Herald Tribune for
blurbs on results of two-day old

games. Three-week old Sports
Illustrateds are treasured ob
jects. And calls from home are
received with, "Who won game
one?"
Stanford football scores are
discovered here on Monday
morning — only two days late.
But other than who won and
descriptions of one or two key
plays, Stanford fans in Italy are
left in the dark.
Nobody in Florence knew that
quarterback Steve Smith had
replaced injured Brian Johnson
in the come-from-behind victory
over Oregon until sports-minded
parents relayed tne event six
days later.
The lowlight, however, has
been the World Series coverage.
Italians just do not like baseball,
which was reflected in the
availibility of news on the of the
year's most important baseball
news.
Results of most games could
be read in the Herald Tribune
or USA Today — two to three
days after the fact. San Fran
cisco Giant fans were so frus
trated during the playoffs that
they resorted to calling the
American Consulate — to no
avail — and considered waking
parents at 4 a.m. to find out the
winner of the final game in the
Giants-Chicago Cubs playoff se
ries. So much for adjusting com
fortably to European life.
Watching the A's and Giants
on television? Forget it. While
fellow students on the Farm
huddled around their televi
sions, their friends in Florence
gave up and visited another of
the city's approximately 250
churches ana museums.
At any one time there are two
soccer games broadcasted, but
not a sight of highlights from
the Bay Bridge Series. The day
after game one, one student
found baseball clips on the
sports channel — highlights
from game four of the 1988
Oakland-Boston playoffs.
For Old World elegance, Eu
ropean lifestyles and great food,
Florence has few equals. But for
sports, stay home.
