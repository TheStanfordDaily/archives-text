# Stanford officials:
## Admissions different, not easier for athletes

Editor's note: This is the first or
ticle in a three-part series on ath
letes and academics at Stanford

It takes more than just a great
backhand or a killer fastball to
become one of the approximately
600 Stanford students who par
ticipate in intercollegiate sports.
You need a grade point average
to match.
According to John Bunnell, di
rector of freshman admissions,
athletes must meet the same ac
ademic requirements as other pro
spective students.
But, while the primary criterion
for admissions is academic per
formance, a secondary considera
tion is achievement outside the
classroom, Dean of Undergradu
ate Admissions Jean Fetter said.
The Admissions Office recog
nizes other ways to measure abil
ity, including artistic talent, ath
letic talent, dramatic talent, and
more. "We want a wide range of
excellence," Fetter said.
Because some universities have
encountered problems of lower ac
ademic standards for athletes, the
National Collegiate Athletic Asso
ciation adopted Proposition 48 in
1986.
The rule states that no student
with a cumulative grade point
average less than 2.0 or a com
bined SAT score of less than 700
may participate in college athle
tics.
However, Proposition 48 "has
not been an issue for athletes at
Stanford," Fetter said, explaining
that there is no athlete here who

does not meet the requirements.
While athletes must meet the
same standards as other potential
freshmen, their application proc
ess can be quite different.
Athletes are often identified to
be recruited to Stanford as early

as their sophomore year in high
school. "We identify potential
recruits . . . through scouting
services, recommendations from
high school coaches, alumni or
direct inquiries from the ath
letes," recruiting coordinator Da
vid Kennedy said.
After the candidates are identi
fied, coaches review the athletes'
records and determine whether
they are academically qualified for
Stanford.
Assistant men's basketball
Coach Doug Oliver said, "We
begin building a paper file on stu
dent athletes" in spring of the
student's junior year in high
school. The coaches conduct ex
tensive academic inquiries to de
termine whether the student is
"Stanford quality," he said.
Because of the University's high
academic standards, the basket
ball team recruits fewer players
than some other schools. "This
means we don't have to watch as
many students play in a particular
game so we can really get to see

the ability of the student we are
interested in," Oliver said.
Bunnell noted that all athletes
must complete a full application,
but added that their folders are
reviewed earlier than other appli
cants'.
This is because athletes usually
sign letters of intent before all
students are formally accepted in
the beginning of April. For in
stance, basketball players sign in
November and football, field
hockey and women's volleyball
recruits sign in February, Bunnell
said.
A letter of intent is a contract
between a player and a university
committing the athlete to attend
and play for that school. According
to NCAA rules, if a player signs
a letter of intent and then decides
to enroll at a different university,
the athlete can lose two years of
playing eligibility and must forfeit
two years of any athletic scholar

ship — if one was offered.
David Calomese, a freshman
recruited to play football, said he
had little difficulty completing his
application early because most of
the other schools he applied to
did not even require the formal
application procedure for athletes.
Thus, he had more time to devote
to his Stanford application, he
said.
"Feb. 8 was the national signing
day (for letters of intent). I had
two weeks to think about signing
before I signed, and I had no
doubt," Calomese said of choosing
Stanford.
"Stanford has so much to sell.
They're number one in every
thing," he added.
Although "no one is formally
accepted until April," Bunnell
said, athletes are notified if they
are approved for admission in No
vember so they can sign letters
of intent.
Signing ends the recruiting
process early and enables athletes
to concentrate fully on their
schoolwork without the distrac

tion of recruiting coaches.
NCAA guidelines in regard to
recruiting are very specific. The
contact period, when a coach can
initiate contact with a recruit,
varies for different sports. For
football recruits, a coach cannot
meet an athlete face-to-face until
Dec. 1 of the senior year, Kennedy
said.
The coach can make three face
to-face contacts at the high school
and then three more at the
player's home or off campus, he
added.
Sophomore Aaron Dorlarque
was recruited to pitch for the
baseball team. "The first contact
[the coaches] made was with a
formal letter describing Stanford
and saying they were interested
in my playing," he said.
"During my junior year, they
sent an assistant coach up to
watch me pitch in a tournament,
but he was not allowed to make
any personal contact," Dorlarque
added. NCAA regulations forbid
coaches from contacting prospec
tive baseball recruits during their

junior year.
But once they are allowed to
establish contact, there is no limit
to the number of telephone calls
or letters a recruited player might
receive from a coach, Athletic Di
rector Andy Geiger said.
"During my senior year, they
contacted me once a month by
phone, and about once every two
weeks after I was accepted," Dor
larque said.
"In October, they arranged for
a recruiting visit. They flew me
down and arranged for me to stay
with players on the team."
Dorlarque added that the head
coach flew up to visit his parents
and talk about going to Stanford
once he was accepted.
Freshman Alison Callicoatte, a
sprinter and jumper on the track
team, was also actively recruited
by Stanford.
"Most people from Texas go to
local schools so I never really
thought about leaving. If the
coaches hadn't called me, I prob
ably wouldn't have applied," she
said.

1986.
The rule states that no student
with a cumulative grade point
average less than 2.0 or a com
bined SAT score of less than 700
may participate in college athle
tics.
However, Proposition 48 "has
not been an issue for athletes at
Stanford," Fetter said, explaining
that there is no athlete here who

does not meet the requirements.
While athletes must meet the
same standards as other potential
freshmen, their application proc
ess can be quite different.
Athletes are often identified to
be recruited to Stanford as early

as their sophomore year in high
school. "We identify potential
recruits . . . through scouting
services, recommendations from
high school coaches, alumni or
direct inquiries from the ath
letes," recruiting coordinator Da
vid Kennedy said.
After the candidates are identi
fied, coaches review the athletes'
records and determine whether
they are academically qualified for
Stanford.
Assistant men's basketball
Coach Doug Oliver said, "We
begin building a paper file on stu
dent athletes" in spring of the
student's junior year in high
school. The coaches conduct ex
tensive academic inquiries to de
termine whether the student is
"Stanford quality," he said.
Because of the University's high
academic standards, the basket
ball team recruits fewer players
than some other schools. "This
means we don't have to watch as
many students play in a particular
game so we can really get to see

the ability of the student we are
interested in," Oliver said.
Bunnell noted that all athletes
must complete a full application,
but added that their folders are
reviewed earlier than other appli
cants'.
This is because athletes usually
sign letters of intent before all
students are formally accepted in
the beginning of April. For in
stance, basketball players sign in
November and football, field
hockey and women's volleyball
recruits sign in February, Bunnell
said.
A letter of intent is a contract
between a player and a university
committing the athlete to attend
and play for that school. According
to NCAA rules, if a player signs
a letter of intent and then decides
to enroll at a different university,
the athlete can lose two years of
playing eligibility and must forfeit
two years of any athletic scholar

ship — if one was offered.
David Calomese, a freshman
recruited to play football, said he
had little difficulty completing his
application early because most of
the other schools he applied to
did not even require the formal
application procedure for athletes.
Thus, he had more time to devote
to his Stanford application, he
said.
"Feb. 8 was the national signing
day (for letters of intent). I had
two weeks to think about signing
before I signed, and I had no
doubt," Calomese said of choosing
Stanford.
"Stanford has so much to sell.
They're number one in every
thing," he added.
Although "no one is formally
accepted until April," Bunnell
said, athletes are notified if they
are approved for admission in No
vember so they can sign letters
of intent.
Signing ends the recruiting
process early and enables athletes
to concentrate fully on their
schoolwork without the distrac

tion of recruiting coaches.
NCAA guidelines in regard to
recruiting are very specific. The
contact period, when a coach can
initiate contact with a recruit,
varies for different sports. For
football recruits, a coach cannot
meet an athlete face-to-face until
Dec. 1 of the senior year, Kennedy
said.
The coach can make three face
to-face contacts at the high school
and then three more at the
player's home or off campus, he
added.
Sophomore Aaron Dorlarque
was recruited to pitch for the
baseball team. "The first contact
[the coaches] made was with a
formal letter describing Stanford
and saying they were interested
in my playing," he said.
"During my junior year, they
sent an assistant coach up to
watch me pitch in a tournament,
but he was not allowed to make
any personal contact," Dorlarque
added. NCAA regulations forbid
coaches from contacting prospec
tive baseball recruits during their

junior year.
But once they are allowed to
establish contact, there is no limit
to the number of telephone calls
or letters a recruited player might
receive from a coach, Athletic Di
rector Andy Geiger said.
"During my senior year, they
contacted me once a month by
phone, and about once every two
weeks after I was accepted," Dor
larque said.
"In October, they arranged for
a recruiting visit. They flew me
down and arranged for me to stay
with players on the team."
Dorlarque added that the head
coach flew up to visit his parents
and talk about going to Stanford
once he was accepted.
Freshman Alison Callicoatte, a
sprinter and jumper on the track
team, was also actively recruited
by Stanford.
"Most people from Texas go to
local schools so I never really
thought about leaving. If the
coaches hadn't called me, I prob
ably wouldn't have applied," she
said.

It takes more than just a great
backhand or a killer fastball to

According to John Bunnell, di
rector of freshman admissions,
athletes must meet the same ac
ademic requirements as other pro
spective students.
But, while the primary criterion
for admissions is academic per
formance, a secondary considera
tion is achievement outside the
classroom, Dean of Undergradu
ate Admissions Jean Fetter said.
The Admissions Office recog
nizes other ways to measure abil
ity, including artistic talent, ath

more. "We want a wide range of
excellence," Fetter said.
