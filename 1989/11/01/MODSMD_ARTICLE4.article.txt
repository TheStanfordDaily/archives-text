# Stanford officials:
## Admissions different, not easier for athletes

It takes more than just a great
backhand or a killer fastball to
become one of the approximately
600 Stanford students who par
ticipate in intercollegiate sports.
You need a grade point average
to match.
According to John Bunnell, di
rector of freshman admissions,
athletes must meet the same ac
ademic requirements as other pro
spective students.
But, while the primary criterion
for admissions is academic per
formance, a secondary considera
tion is achievement outside the
classroom, Dean of Undergradu
ate Admissions Jean Fetter said.
The Admissions Office recog
nizes other ways to measure abil
ity, including artistic talent, ath
letic talent, dramatic talent, and
more. "We want a wide range of
excellence," Fetter said.
Because some universities have
encountered problems of lower ac
ademic standards for athletes, the
National Collegiate Athletic Asso
ciation adopted Proposition 48 in
1986.
The rule states that no student
with a cumulative grade point
average less than 2.0 or a com
bined SAT score of less than 700
may participate in college athle
tics.
However, Proposition 48 "has
not been an issue for athletes at
Stanford," Fetter said, explaining
that there is no athlete here who

does not meet the requirements.
While athletes must meet the
same standards as other potential
freshmen, their application proc
ess can be quite different.
Athletes are often identified to
be recruited to Stanford as early

as their sophomore year in high
school. "We identify potential
recruits . . . through scouting
services, recommendations from
high school coaches, alumni or
direct inquiries from the ath
letes," recruiting coordinator Da
vid Kennedy said.
After the candidates are identi
fied, coaches review the athletes'
records and determine whether
they are academically qualified for
Stanford.
Assistant men's basketball
Coach Doug Oliver said, "We
begin building a paper file on stu
dent athletes" in spring of the
student's junior year in high
school. The coaches conduct ex
tensive academic inquiries to de
termine whether the student is
"Stanford quality," he said.
Because of the University's high
academic standards, the basket
ball team recruits fewer players
than some other schools. "This
means we don't have to watch as
many students play in a particular
game so we can really get to see
