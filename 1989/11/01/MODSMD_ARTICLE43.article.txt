Federal aid tied to drug programs
President Bush's new $7.9 million drug policy
could affect more than just drug dealers and
users. Those receiving financial aid could see
their federal assistance disappear if their schools
do not comply with new standards.
A quarter of a million dollars of Bush's pro
posed drug fund has been allocated for school
and community prevention programs, but "every
school, college and university . . . must adopt
tough but fair policies about drug use by students.
Those that will not adopt such policies will not
get federal aid. Period." said Bush in his Sept.
5 speech.
Dr. Naomi Barenberg, Director of Health Serv
ices at Tulane University, was confident that
Tulane had done everything expected of them to

comply with the new policies. In 1986, the uni
versity funded the Alcohol and Drug Education,
Prevention and Treatment (ADEPT) program,
which focuses on counseling and education.
However, since they received this grant,
Tulane's drug and alcohol policy has come under
increasing federal scrutiny.
In the meantime, Tulane Director of Financial
Aid Tom Lovett has been carefully watching
Washington for new developments. As 30 percent
of student financial aid packages at Tulane in
clude some form of federal funding, how and
when the official review of universities takes
place could have significant effects on his office.
