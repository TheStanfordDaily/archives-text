# Memorial Church may stay closed at least one year
## 
### Chad Rockwell Staff writer 
University officials yesterday expressed doubt
that Memorial Church and several other
earthquake-damaged buildings in the Quad will
reopen soon.
Two other academic buildings in the Quad closed
after the Oct. 17 temblor were declared safe this
week.
But the future of Memorial Church, which sus
tained massive structural damage to its central
dome, is uncertain, according to Joyce Cook, assis
tant to the dean of the chapel. "We are looking at
an absolute minimum of one year of closure . . .
and most likely more," she said.
Cook estimated that at least 15 percent of the
church will have to be reconstructed.
During the earthquake, large sections of the
church's ceiling mosaic crashed down onto pews,
and keystones, which are the center pieces support
ing much of the weight of the dome's arches, slipped
out of position.
University engineers installed scaffolding yester
day to support the dome, which sustained surface
cracks at least two fingers wide.
Other buildings around the Quad were more for
tunate. Building 360, which houses Applied Earth
Sciences, and Building 80, the home of the Human
Biology Department, were reopened Monday when
structural engineers deemed them habitable.
After a weeklong stay in the Mendenhall Library
in McClatchy Hall, employees of the School of Hu
manities and Sciences returned to their offices in
Building 1 with no inconveniences.
Gene Kershner, associate director of Facilities
Project Management, said most of the heavily
damaged buildings, including the Engineering Cor
ner (Building 260), and the Geology Corner
(Building 370), have not yet been seismically rein
forced. The Engineering and Geology Corners were
next on the list for reinforcement.
Teams of engineers began analyzing the total
damage last week. According to Kershner, it will
be at least two months before the teams can deter
mine when badly damaged parts of the Quad, in
cluding Buildings 30, 260 and 370, will be reopened.
