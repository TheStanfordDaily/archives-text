# Program initiated to aid sick children
## 
### Geoff Goldman Staff writer 
While children look forward to being able
to stay home from school when they are sick,
their parents, who have to stay home with
them, often dread it.
But since the opening of the Get Well Room
at the Stanford Arboretum Children's Center
last week, there is now another option for
sick children of Stanford-affiliated families.
Instead of staying home with their sick
children, Stanford faculty, employees and stu
dents may now drop them off at the Get Well
Room, where they will be under the care of
coordinator Terry Daniele, a registered nurse
with 10 years' experience working in pediatric
health care and in a children's hospital.
According to Daniele, this type of program
is fairly new within the childcare field.
The Get Well Room is open from 8 a.m. to
4 p.m. Monday through Friday. The program
is currently licensed to handle as many as
nine children between the ages of 4 months
and 7 years.
According to Daniele, the Get Well Room
is designed as a place for mildly ill children

to recover. Children who attend are "not well
enough to go to the regular Arboretum Center
or to school."
However, because of state licensing require
ments, there are strict limitations on how sick
patrons of the Get Well Room may be. Children
staying in the room may not have a commun
icable disease or have a fever over 101 degrees.
Daniele said she tries to make the center
as "normal an environment as possible for
the children." The facility consists of one large
room with an adjoining patio and playground.
She tailors the activities to the ages of the
students attending.
Lisa Lawrence, whose 4-year-old daughter
Meredith March attended the Get Well Room
Tuesday, said that although she felt anxious
before dropping Meredith off at the room,
once she met Daniele her anxiety was allayed.
She said she was impressed by Daniele's
"way with kids and her medical knowledge."
Lawrence also emphasized the convenience of
the Get Well Room for her, as she works at
the nearby Hoover Pavilion.
Lawrence said she had visited and preregis
tered at the center during the summer, before

Daniele had been hired. She feels the
preregiBtration fee was worth the expense,
considering that Meredith will be able to use
the center for the next three years.
Provisions for the Get Well Room were made
in 1987 during the planning stages for the
Arboretum Center, which opened in August
1988. Funding for the room has been provided
by a $48,000 grant from the David and Lucille
Packard Foundation.
Two children have attended the Get Well
Room since its opening, Daniele said.
Parents wishing to send their children to
the Get Well Room must first fill out a
preregistration form and pay a fee of $10 for
families already using the Arboretum Center
or $20 for all other Stanford-affiliated
families.
After registering, parents call Daniele the
day before or the morning of the day they
want to drop off their child.
There is a minimum fee of $20 for up to
four hours per child at the Get Well Room.
For each additional hour, the fee is $6. If a
child is left for a full eight-hour day, however,
the fee is $40.
