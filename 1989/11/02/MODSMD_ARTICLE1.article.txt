## Students reach out to stop disease

Editor's note: This is the last in
a series of articles on AIDS and
the Stanford community, coincid
ing with AIDS Awareness Week.

Senior Dana Johnson had never
been in a "crack house" before,
and she was nervous.
"We pulled up to the house and
I remember seeing the curtains
parting," she recalled. "We
knocked on the door and someone
let us in. It was really dark inside.
There were a lot of couches
around, so you could tell people
would just hang out there.

"I saw one or two kids,"
Johnson continued. "I know there
were some people in the back
room — I could hear voices there,
a woman's voice."
Johnson didn't enter the house
to "do crack." Along with Eric
Walker, director of the East Palo
Alto AIDS Project, she was there
to combat the spread of AIDS
among the population most widely
affected by the disease: in
travenous drug users and their
partners.
The project employs strategies
of education and outreach to halt
the AIDS epidemic in the predom
inantly black, poor and undered
ucated areas of East Palo Alto
and East Menlo Park. Operated
by volunteers — most from Stan
ford and the Stanford School of
Medicine — the project distributes
bleach kits, condoms and infor
mation to people in the neighbor
hoods.
The bleach kits, known as
"clean-your-works kits," are dis
tributed to intravenous drug users
along with directions for steriliz
ing the hypodermic needles that
they share. Shared needles that
have not been sterilized are re

sponsible for spreading the AIDS
epidemic among intravenous drug
users.
The motivation to help combat
the spread of AIDS is shared by
the 52 students enrolled in a vol
unteer training course offered
jointly by the School of Education,
the Psychology Department and
the Center for Teaching and
Learning.
The course, called the AIDS
Outreach Volunteer Training Pro
gram, is taught by Patricia
Fabiano, director of the Cowell
Health Promotion Program.
Fabiano said she expects students
will use the education and expe
rience they gain in the course as
a springboard to future AlDS
related volunteer work.
One student, who was involved
in several gay-rights issues before
he came to Stanford, said he hopes
the class will help him educate
himself and others about AIDS.
"I don't know enough about the
disease," said the student, who
wanted to remain anonymous.
"And I'm sure that there are
other people like me all around
campus who don't know enough.
I'd Like to do something
to change that."
Gillian Goddard, a first-year
medical student, is taking the
class to prepare herself for AIDS
education volunteer work. "I'd
like to go to high schools and talk
to people about AIDS," she said.
"This class is my introduction
(to AIDS education) and I think
it's great," Goddard said, adding
that she thinks the course pro
vides a more complete picture of
the AIDS epidemic than one
might expect from such a class.
"We're exposed to a lot of dif
ferent sides to the AIDS issue,"
she said. "It's not just the facts
and figures, it's behavioral impli
cations and personal situations."
According to Fabiano, the di
verse content of the course is
meant to provide students with a
broad education about the dis
ease. "We're using a very innova
tive approach," she said. "We're
taking an educational risk in that
we're combining raw data about
the disease with a very human
look at AIDS."
As part of that approach,
Fabiano has invited various
speakers, including individuals
diagnosed with AIDS, to share
their experiences and knowledge
with the students.
"We want to create a significant

emotional and intellectual experi
ence for the students," Fabiano
said. People interested in doing
volunteer work with AIDS victims
need to be prepared emotionally
to cope with the debilitating ef
fects of the disease and the con
stant threat of death, she said.
AIDS outreach volunteer
Andrew Gans has already con
fronted such issues. For a year
and a half, Gans, who graduated
in June, spent time one-on-one
with an AIDS patient.
Gans volunteered with the Aris
Eroject, a Santa Clara County
ased non-profit organization
dedicated to providing both
practical and emotional support
to people with AIDS. Two other
organizations that serve the needs
of AIDS patients on the Peninsula
— the Ellipse project of San Mateo
County and the Shanti project of
San Francisco — operate in much
the same way as Aris.
The word "Aris" is an Ohlone
Native American word meaning
"strength," and while the project
gives strength and support to

AIDS victims, it also tests and
builds the inner strength of its
volunteers.
As an "emotional support" vol
unteer, Gans was assigned a single
client. "It's a long-term commit
ment," Gans said. "You're ex
pected to develop a relationship
with this person and provide him
with emotional support." Such
support can include visiting a
client in the hospital, cooking a
meal together or just talking,
Gans said.
Gans worked with the same
client from January 1988 to July
1989. "We developed a great re
lationship," he remembered. "We
were very good friends the whole
time."
Thus, it was emotionally diffi
cult for Gans when his client died
during the summer. "When he
was in the hospital, I sort of dealt
with death then," Gans said. "But
it was still hard."
Because the experiences of
AIDS outreach volunteers can be
emotionally draining, projects like
Aris often require their volunteers
to meet in weekly support groups.
"They want to make sure you
don't burn yourself out," Gans
said. "Sometimes you have a ten
dency to take all the problems on

your shoulders, and that's when
you really need support."
Although the thought of com
mitting to a one-on-one support
ive friendship might be
intimidating to students, Gans
suggested that undergraduates
try volunteering for "practical
support." Practical support volun
teers do such things as drive
people with AIDS to medical ap
pointments, walk their dogs, do
their shopping or clean house for
them.
Julian Diciurcio, founder of the
Aris project, said a variety of jobs
are available for people interested
in AIDS volunteer work. "Stu
dents could help with fundraising
by organizing a car wash or a
charity run," Diciurcio said. "Also,
we can use office help or dona
tions to the food bank we've
started."
Because students have flexible
schedules, it is often easier for
them to provide daytime help for
AIDS victims than volunteers who
have full-time jobs, Gans said.
"Practical support work might be
a really good thing for a student
who wants to try out some vol
unteer work but who doesn't want
to make a big commitment right

away," he said.
But those involved in coordinat
ing AIDS education and outreach
programs at Stanford hope that
many students will make some
sort of commitment to work on
an issue related to AIDS.
"Practically every student inter
ested can find an outlet in this
project," Fabiano said. "We need
people to help in the development
of an assessment pool at Stanford,
we need speakers to go to dorms
and high schools, we need people
who will start support groups for
those affected or infected by
AIDS."
Although each student taking
the volunteer training course is
required to complete an "action
project" — some form of AIDS
volunteer work — Fabiano expects
that her students will continue
their volunteer work after they
have completed the course.
"AIDS is not last year's dis
ease," Fabiano said. "New infor
mation surfaces every day, and
the shape of the problem is con
stantly changing. These students
are acquiring the basic training
they need to become a part of the
solution instead of a part of the
problem."
