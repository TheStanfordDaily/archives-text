## Students reach out to stop disease

Editor's note: This is the last in
a series of articles on AIDS and
the Stanford community, coincid
ing with AIDS Awareness Week.

Senior Dana Johnson had never
been in a "crack house" before,
and she was nervous.
"We pulled up to the house and
I remember seeing the curtains
parting," she recalled. "We
knocked on the door and someone
let us in. It was really dark inside.
There were a lot of couches
around, so you could tell people
would just hang out there.

"I saw one or two kids,"
Johnson continued. "I know there
were some people in the back
room — I could hear voices there,
a woman's voice."
Johnson didn't enter the house
to "do crack." Along with Eric
Walker, director of the East Palo
Alto AIDS Project, she was there
to combat the spread of AIDS
among the population most widely
affected by the disease: in
travenous drug users and their
partners.
The project employs strategies
of education and outreach to halt
the AIDS epidemic in the predom
inantly black, poor and undered
ucated areas of East Palo Alto
and East Menlo Park. Operated
by volunteers — most from Stan
ford and the Stanford School of
Medicine — the project distributes
bleach kits, condoms and infor
mation to people in the neighbor
hoods.
The bleach kits, known as
"clean-your-works kits," are dis
tributed to intravenous drug users
along with directions for steriliz
ing the hypodermic needles that
they share. Shared needles that
have not been sterilized are re

sponsible for spreading the AIDS
epidemic among intravenous drug
users.
The motivation to help combat
the spread of AIDS is shared by
the 52 students enrolled in a vol
unteer training course offered
jointly by the School of Education,
the Psychology Department and
the Center for Teaching and
Learning.
The course, called the AIDS
Outreach Volunteer Training Pro
gram, is taught by Patricia
Fabiano, director of the Cowell
Health Promotion Program.
Fabiano said she expects students
will use the education and expe
rience they gain in the course as
a springboard to future AlDS
related volunteer work.
One student, who was involved
in several gay-rights issues before
he came to Stanford, said he hopes
the class will help him educate
himself and others about AIDS.
"I don't know enough about the
disease," said the student, who
wanted to remain anonymous.
"And I'm sure that there are
other people like me all around
campus who don't know enough.
I'd Like to do something
to change that."
Gillian Goddard, a first-year
medical student, is taking the
class to prepare herself for AIDS
education volunteer work. "I'd
like to go to high schools and talk
to people about AIDS," she said.
"This class is my introduction
(to AIDS education) and I think
it's great," Goddard said, adding
that she thinks the course pro
vides a more complete picture of
the AIDS epidemic than one
might expect from such a class.
"We're exposed to a lot of dif
ferent sides to the AIDS issue,"
she said. "It's not just the facts
and figures, it's behavioral impli
cations and personal situations."
According to Fabiano, the di
verse content of the course is
meant to provide students with a
broad education about the dis
ease. "We're using a very innova
tive approach," she said. "We're
taking an educational risk in that
we're combining raw data about
the disease with a very human
look at AIDS."
As part of that approach,
Fabiano has invited various
speakers, including individuals
diagnosed with AIDS, to share
their experiences and knowledge
with the students.
"We want to create a significant
