# Cowell clarifies pregnancy counseling policy
## 
### Siddhartha Mukherjee 
Prompted by a growing concern
about unplanned pregnancies,
Cowell Student Health Center last
week released a policy urging
pregnant women to consider all
options for handling the preg
nancy through counseling.
Created by Cowell's Committee
on Pregnancy Counseling — con
sisting of gynecologists, nurse
practitioners and counselors —
the policy is a general statement
encouraging women and their
partners to take advantage of the
various options and resources
available at Cowell.
The policy encourages women
to consider, in "an objective way,"

various options "through appro
priate individualized counseling"
so that they can make an in
formed choice.
Some of the services Cowell of
fers are adoption counseling,
abortion referral and counseling
on carrying pregnancy to term.
Commenting on the need for a
policy, committee member Char
lotte Siegel, a psychiatric social
worker with Counseling and Psy
chological Services, said that in "a
year with so much media and po
litical stress on the issue of preg
nancy, Cowell wanted a policy
statement."
"This is not a change; we only
wanted to articulate what we've

always been doing," she said.
According to Dr. John Dorman,
associate director of Cowell, one
reason for the written policy was
to counter accusations that Cowell
placed greater emphasis on abor
tion as an option for pregnant
women.
"There was a lot of concern that
Cowell didn't do anything except
refer patients for abortion. That's
not the case," said Dorman.
To put the policy into action,
Cowell will introduce a more for
malized training program for doc
tors, nurse-practitioners and
counselors who will be dealing
with unplanned pregnancies.
According to Siegel, the purpose

of the training session will be to
update the Cowell staffs skills
and knowledge of resources, to
define the principles of good coun
seling, and to evaluate and ex
pedite the process by which
Cowell handles patients with un
planned pregnancies.
She said she hopes that the pro
gram will help the Cowell staff
analyze how members "work to
gether to ensure that a woman
gets the care and attention she
needs."
The committee is also consid
ering expanding the program to
reach other organizations on
campus, such as peer counseling
groups and Residential Education.
