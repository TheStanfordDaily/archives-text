# Sandinistas call end to cease-fire

MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) — President
Daniel Ortega yesterday ended his govern
ment's 19-month truce with the Contras, citing
continued rebel attacks, and threatened to
cancel elections scheduled for next year.
He accused President Bush of "supporting
terrorism in Nicaragua."
By suspending the truce, Ortega has invited
renewed U.S. military aid to the Contras. A
White House spokesman condemned the
suspension as "deplorable," but declined to
say whether military aid would be resumed.
"Now it will depend on the Yankee Congress
and the Yankee president that these elections
take place on Feb. 25," Ortega said heatedly,
sprinkling in his own comments on the situ
ation as he read a communique.
After Ortega's remarks, Alejandro Bendana,
secretary general of the Foreign Ministry, said
Nicaragua has no plans to cancel the elections.
He said Ortega's point was that "the United
States has a role to play. ... Evidently, if they
drop a bomb here (such as resuming military
aid to the Contras), there can't be elections."
The announcement followed an increase in
attacks by Contra guerrillas inside Nicaragua
and ended a truce in effect since the end of
March 1988, shortly after the United States
cut off arms shipments to the Contras.
"We have the responsibility of defending
the lives of Nicaraguans," Ortega said at a
news conference broadcast live on a nation
wide radio chain. "Therefore we can't allow
assassinations to be committed" against
civilians.
On Friday, the Sandinista leader stunned
a summit of Western hemisphere leaders when
he announced he would not renew the truce,
which the government has done monthly.
Ortega was immediately condemned and
world leaders expressed concern about his ris
king the painstaking peace process in Central

America as well as the elections.
White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater
said it was "obvious that (Ortega) is afraid
of the ballot box."
"It's important that the world understand
our emphasis is on the elections and the dem
ocratic processes in Nicaragua, so we continue
to push for that," Fitzwater said. "If Mr.
Ortega wants to pursue a military conflict, if
he wants to reopen war, if he wants to resume
the killing again, that is his business."
Bush has said he would review U.S. policy
toward Nicaragua if Ortega ends the cease
fire. But Fitzwater said it would be inappro
priate to speculate on whether military aid
will be resumed.
"We are waiting for that re-evaluation," said
a Contra leader, Adolfo Calero, in Miami. "For
our part, we have to defend ourselves. Every
man has the right to survive, and we have
to look for the way to survive."
Ortega referred repeatedly to a reported
attack by the Contras on Monday that left
four civilians dead and five wounded. Ortega
inspected the site Tuesday in the company of
election observers and a U.S. diplomat.
"These actions are directed at sabotaging
the accord on the demobilization of the mer
cenary forces" signed by five Central American
presidents on Aug. 7, Ortega said.
Calero denied Contra involvement in the

attack. "It's too coincidental not to have been
staged," he said.
Ortega blamed the United States for the
attacks and said U.S. aid to the Contras should
be used for disbanding and resettling them.
The United States has continued to supply
non-lethal aid, including boots and uniforms
and other military items, but U.S. officials
say they have urged the Contras not to launch
attacks inside Nicaragua.
The announcement was a blow to the Cen
tral American peace process and the Aug. 7
agreements that called for demobilization in
exchange for move towards democratization
inside Nicaragua.
Ortega called for a meeting Nov. 6-7 be
tween representatives of the Nicaraguan and
Honduran governments, a joint United
Nations-Organization of American States
commission and the Contras to discuss
specifics on the dismantling of the rebel force.
The Contras were not party to the Aug. 7
accords, and Contra field commanders said
flatly they would not demobilize. Instead, they
began moving their troops out of the Hon
duran camps and into Nicaragua, saying they
would not engage in offensive operations until
after the Feb. 25 elections.
Yesterday it seemed clear that the Contras
would not be voluntarily demobilized by Dec.
8, as the Aug. 7 accord stipulated. Ortega
said 1,100 Contras had infiltrated Nicaragua
in the last three weeks; Secretary of State
James A. Baker has said that "thousands"
have returned.
Ortega said the February elections in Nic
aragua depend on the willingness of Bush and
Congress to divert humanitarian funds to
demobilize the rebels.
Ortega complained that his government had
been making a one-sided effort to bring peace
to Nicaragua.
