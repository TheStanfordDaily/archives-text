# Iran calls for the arrest of Americans
## 
### 
NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) — Iran yes
terday approved a law giving it the
power to arrest Americans anywhere
and put them on trial, and one news
paper suggested that the first target be
the former commander of the USS Vin
cennes.
The action came amid growing anti-
U.S. passion being whipped up to mark
the 10th anniversary of the storming
of the U.S. Embassy in Tehran. Pro
testers plan to burn 160 American flags
putside the compound on Saturday.
The official Islamic Republic News
Agency said the Mtylis, or parliament,
unanimously approved a final version
of the bill that earlier had been passed
by the 12-member Council of Guar
dians, a constitutional watchdog body.
The law will remain on the books "as
long as the U.S. president is authorized
to commit inhuman practices against
the lives and interests of Iranian
citizens," the agency reported in a dis
patch monitored in Cyprus.
The Iranian move was in response to
the Justice Department's authorization
of the FBI to arrest suspected terrorists

abroad and bring them to trial in the
United States without the permission
of the countries where they were lo
cated.
The U.S. move did not specify Iran.
But it is one of several nations accused
of supporting and encouraging terror
ism, including the kidnapping of Amer
icans and other Westerners in Lebanon,
assassinations and hijackings.
Iranian radicals clearly saw the Jus
tice Department's action as aimed at
the Islamic republic.
"You who scream about human rights
and talk about terrorism, are yourselves
innately terrorists and criminals who
have taken security away from the
people of the world," said Parliament
Speaker Mehdi Karrubi, a leading radi
cal.
Several Iranian-backed Shiite
militants in Lebanon are wanted by the
United States for hijacking a TWA air
liner in 1985 and killing a U.S. Navy
diver aboard the jet.
The new Iranian law allows the Teh
ran government to arrest Americans

deemed to have acted against Iranian
interests anywhere in the world and
bring them to the Islamic Republic for
trial by no-jury Islamic courts.
"U.S. citizens and their agents, and
countries which collaborate with the
United States in kidnapping or endan
gering Iranian citizens or the interests
of the Islamic republic, will be tried by
Iranian courts according to Islamic jus
tice," the bill declared.
"We have to empower the president
and officials of the Islamic republic to
take reprisal measures" to protect
Iranians, Karrubi said.
Tehran's radical daily Abrar said
Capt. Will Rogers 111, commander of
the missile cruiser Vincennes when it
mistakenly shot down an Iranian air
liner last year, should be the first person
brought to trial under the new law.
The Vincennes shot down the jetliner
during fighting in the Persian Gulf in
July 1988, killing all 290 people on
board. The Navy said the crew mistook
the plane for an attacking Iranian F-14
fighter jet.
