WASHINGTON (AP) - The super

Gorbachev that they said would produce
no startling breakthroughs.

SACRAMENTO (AP) - Using small,
hand-held devices, California Highway
Patrol officers will begin checking
motorists' breath for alcohol when they
stop at roadside sobriety checkpoints,
state officials said yesterday.
"We hope to have this program under
way by the end of the year," said CHP
spokesman Sam Haynes. "We believe
this program is compatible with search
and seizure laws and implied consent
laws."

"We intend to have these in use
throughout the state," Haynes added.
Powerful quake rocks Japan
TOKYO (AP) — A mayor earthquake
rocked northeastern Japan early yester
day morning and more than 6,000 coas
tal residents were evacuated as a precau
tion against seismic-caused tidal waves,
officials reported.
No casualties or nuyor damage were
reported, and the evacuation order was
lifted after 30 hours as the danger of
such waves, called tsunami, subsided.
The quake, centered 18 miles below
the seabed and about 80 miles off
Japan's main Honshu island, struck at
3:26 a.m. (1:26 p.m. Wednesday EST)
with a magnitude estimated here at 7.1
on the Richter scale. That was the same
magnitude as the Oct. 17 quake that
devastated the San Francisco Bay area.
