Committee to study
bureaucracy requires
student, faculty input

WHAT DO YOU do when
you have too much bu
reaucracy? Form a com
mittee to study the problem, of
course.
The President's Task Force on
Action Plans for Change is de
signed to increase efficiency at this
University by strengthening man
agement. One of the ways to do
this is through organizational
simplification.
To get the process started, how
ever, the University has decided to
convene a committee made up only
of administrators to study the
problem for 18 months. Therefore
the streamlining process will begin
with an additional bureaucratic el
ement: the committee.
Paradoxically, the University has
elected to give administrators the
exclusive right to study them
selves. They will be looking at dif
ferent administrative departments,
perhaps even some that they them
selves work in, to try to find prob
lems and recommend changes.
At the Faculty Senate meeting,
professors decried the need for fac
ulty input on the committee. They
saw the benefits of having outside
community members on the com
mittee to help determine what is

necessary and what should be
changed or streamlined.
Yet it is crucial that the admin
istration remembers that students
too deserve input into the process.
They too are affected substantially
by the decisions that this commit
tee makes, what services or depart
ments it chooses to augment and
which ones it chooses to cut.
As Chemistry Prof. John Ross
has pointed out, the people who
are being administered and man
aged have important things to say
about the administration and their
actions. They understand where
the bureaucracy is breaking down
or overly cumbersome.
There is a tendency at Stanford
to leave a position alone until the
person in that position retires or
leaves the University. That way
reorginization of the position may
not take place until years after it
is known that a change is needed.
Participants from outside the ad
ministration will help the commit
tee take that long look. And they
could do it in a much shorter time
period.
The fact that the committee is
slated to take a year and a half
just to study the bureaucracy is
symptomatic of the problem it is
trying to solve. As time goes on,
the unnecessary bureaucracy con
tinues to grow and thrive while
students and professors continue
to suffer.
The University recognizes that
this is an important problem. So
let's fix it right, and let's fix it now.
