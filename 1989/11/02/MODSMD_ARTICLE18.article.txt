Workers shouldn't bear the brunt ofTresidder cuts

ON THE DAY of the quake, class
lines just about disappeared in
the Bay Area. People struggled
together and shared together and
helped each other with whatever skills
they possessed.
But how quickly that all disappeared
— especially at Tresidder Union.
Before the quake, Tresidder's many
layers of managers — directors, associ
ate directors, assistant directors, man
agers and supervisors — suddenly
found out that Tresidder was in the
hole to the tune of $210,000 for 1989-
1990.
Tresidder's solution: cut the workers
below them and leave their own posi
tions and pay intact.

In addition to cutting back produc
tive clerical and administrative
workers, they want three custodians on
the maintenance crew (30 percent of
the crew) to leave, retire, transfer or
get laid-off.
No management will transfer or get
laid-off. At exactly the same time,
Tresidder management installed
$71,655.19 of new patio furniture at
Tresidder and at Encina. This is al
most the total wages of those three
workers for a full year.
Tresidder management is letting go
of those employees who provide the
concrete, visible, necessary work that
keeps Tresidder functioning day to day,
while it is keeping all those employees

(themselves) who have more nebulous
tasks "coordinating", "planning",
"decorating" and "overseeing" and who
cost the public twice as much in
salaries and pensions.
You will find more fairness in a
Dickens novel than at Tresidder. In the
last one and a half years workers have
watched whole groups of directors and
assistant directors go on paid trips to
New Orleans and Washington, hold
catered parties on work time and
install brand new furniture and carpet
ing for all their upstairs offices when
the old was adequate.
While management was upscaling its
offices it cut back two custodians —

who work both days and night to make
ends meet — to 80 percent time be
cause management did not have the
money for labor.
Thus, we feel that Tresidder man
agement has acted and continues to act
in a self-serving and unfair way. This
has been costly to students and
workers alike. We hope student organi
zations will call for a thorough investi
gation into Tresidder's spending and
priorities.
Two custodians have said they are
considering transfering, although they
feel it is unfair. Now it's management's
turn to make a cut too.
