# Letter berating SWOPSI course not signed by faculty
## 
### 
Your article on the SWOPSI celebra
tion (Oct. 18), which quoted from the
letter castigating the 1989 animal
rights course that Kimberley Sturla
and I taught, mistakenly stated that
the letter was signed by 30 faculty
members of the Biological Sciences
Department.
The letter was signed by no one. It
bore a typed list of the department's
entire faculty, at least four of whom
promptly dissociated themselves from
it, including a recent appointee who
had not even arrived here when his
name was affixed to it.
Copies of the letter — characterized
by one journalist as "a piece of hate
mail" — which charged us with every
thing from mind control, were sent to
every dean of conceivable relevance
and to University President Donald
Kennedy, though not to us.

When we finally saw the letter and,
through our attorney, demanded a
retraction, the rest of the biology facul
ty, in collegial solidarity and divine
forgiveness of the letter's shortcomings
in style and spelling — not to mention
substance — closed ranks and unani
mously assumed ex post facto author
ship of the epistle, which most of them
had probably never seen before.
Stanford lawyers descended upon the
department and put a gag order on it
and SWOPSI.
Kennedy solemnly pronounced this
bizarre proceeding as the department's
"completely appropriate function of
quality control" and expressed his
"gratification that colleagues took the
time to consider the matter and give
their opinions to the dean," (Campus
Report, March 22).
The course had all of seven students.
They rated it as excellent and ex
tremely even-handed.
The letter had been written by the
one and only member of the biology
faculty ever to have visited our course.
He came to one of ten sessions and
left in high dudgeon when we ques-

tioned whether some of the research
conducted here was worth its enor
mous cost in animal suffering.
It is not a question Stanford is very
hospitable to.
