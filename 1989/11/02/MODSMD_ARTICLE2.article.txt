# Magazine publisher gives Farm a laugh

Tom Phillips, publisher of the
magazine that consistently
refers to Donald Trump as the
"short-fingered Bulgarian,"
demonstrated to a full crowd in
Branner lounge last night ex
actly why SPY is one of the most
irreverent humour magazines of
our day.
Phillips, an alumnus of the
Graduate School of Business,
kept the crowd laughing with a
slide show that presented high
lights from SPY magazine's first
three years.
"We started SPY magazine be
cause there was nothing in print
that reflected our sensibility
toward the world. In a word,
that sensibility was ironic," Phil
lips said.
One of SPY's regular features
is a section called "Separated At
Birth. . .?" which features photos
of different public figures with
similar facial features. Phillips
said his favorite "twins" were
Leona Helmsley and Liberace.
Other favorites of the crowd
were visual comparisons of Sam
Donaldson and Mr. Spock,
Geraldo Riviera and Bozo the
Clown, Dick Cavett and Ted
Bundy, and George Schultz and

the Cowardly Lion from The
Wizard of Oz.
SPY magazine started in Oc
tober 1986 when Phillips, who
was working as a venture
capitalist, and TIME magazine
writers Kurt Andersen and
Graydon Carter decided to put
their irreverent attitude into
print.
"The reason we started it is
that we didn't have a favorite
magazine," Phillips said. They
came up with SPY magazine,
which Phillips described as "in
telligent, (and) serious about its
journalism. It's silly about
serious subjects, and serious
about silly subjects."
Phillips originally published
SPY for a core audience of New
York friends, but he soon re
ceived requests for his magazine
in places as far removed as Los
Angeles.
One of the reasons that SPY
has been called "notorious" is
its willingness to subject nearly
any public figure to ridicule. One
of SPY's more famous covers fea
tured a full-face picture of Ivana
Trump, wife of Donald Trump,
whom Phillips called SPY's
"nemesis."
The picture was apparently so
"horrifying that "Ivana disap
peared for three weeks and reap
peared with new teeth, fewer
wrinkles around the eyes, a new
hairdo, new makeup and a new
chest," said Phillips, citing the
New York Daily News as his
source.
Phillips said that the magazine
will continue to grow, although
the concentration of its readership
lies in New York and California.
Noting that the magazine is ex
panding in "fun" ways, Phillips
said SPY's first television show,
"SPY's Lode at How to be Famous
in the '905," will be airing on
NBC sometime early next year.
Phillips also quoted from one
of SPY's more infamous publica
tions, a satire of "Cliffs Notes."

Ivana disappeared
for three weeks and
reappeared with new
teeth, fewer wrinkles
around the eyes, a
new hairdo, new
makeup and a new
chest.' â€¢

In the SPY Notes for "Bright
Lights, Big City," "Less Than
Zero," and "Slaves of New York,"
the reader is asked to "contrast
any one of the books in the genre
with a well-written 20th century
novel of your choice."
After Phillips' speech, Branner
resident assistant David Hornik
announced that a SPY-type mag
azine would be starting at Stan
ford.
