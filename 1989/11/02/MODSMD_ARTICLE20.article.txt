# COP shouldn't worry about post office lines in disaster
## 
### 
I was fascinated to read last Thurs
day that the ASSU's Council of Presi
dents has gotten into the forefront of
mail reform on campus.
With the myriad problems facing
Stanford these days, it puzzles me that
a group like the COP would be spend
ing their time working to change the
United States Postal Service.
Where were Aimee, Ingrid, Dave and
Chin-Chin while the rest of Stanford
was out reshelving books, moving mat
tresses and picking up garbage to raise
money for relief efforts? Perhaps they

were in White Plaza attempting to
alleviate that pesky post office gridlock
Let the government worry about
mail. The ASSU is a student organiza
tion and as such needs to be respon
sive to students' needs.
Days after a national disaster, their
efforts should focus on coordinating
immediate aid for the Stanford com
munity, not on trimming lines at the
post office, for this belittles both them
and the students they represent.
Many people, in association with the
Public Service Center, volunteered fol
lowing the quake, doing whatever was
needed at the time. Their efforts are
to be lauded. It is disappointing, how
ever, that their student leaders failed
to join them.
