## Living in the fast lane 
### 
ALL AROUND US, the signs of the
"short-lived" generation are pop
ping up. Now, we see the emer
gence of a new group of people who thrive
on what's new and exciting, fast and state
of the art, never stopping, never pausing,
disposing of everything after its ten min
ute shelf life.
The examples of our quick-moving so
ciety are all around us. There's a whole
bevy of overnight parcel services and com
puters and gadgets and gizmos to feed
our insatiable need for new, new, new,
now, now, now. I wonder how long it
will be until people start carrying around
fax machines in their cars, connected to
their cellular telephones.
The point is made even when you walk
through Safeway. The aisles are filled
with instant foods and goods, fit for any
taste or desire. New and improved frozen
dinners, instant soups, even zip-top cans
for those who just can't stop to use a
can opener. All of them serve as a testa
ment to the fact that we're a generation
that just doesn't want to wait around for
anything.
The media also seems to be following
the trend of wanting to be fast. Newspa
pers are going for the Readers' Digest,
ClifTs Notes, USA Today format. The
days of an article that's long enough to
make you turn to another page have
seemingly been supplanted by flashy
graphs and color pictures.
Even more staggering is the increasing
amount of people who no longer read the
paper for their news. They tune into the
network news and get the 30 second blurb
from Dan Rather or that Sam Donaldson

guy that looks like a Klingon.
Where does this attitude of "I want it
better, and I want it now" come from?
My parents say it comes from television
reducing our attention spans, making us
unhappy with anything that's over ten
minutes long.
Maybe they're right. I've always had
problems staying alert in my 11 o'clock
classes, and I grew up watching a lot of
television, maybe too much. How else
could I know the names of all the actors
on "The Brady Bunch?"
But, back to the point, is there anything
wrong with all of this? Is it wrong to
live life in the fast lane, looking for the
new and exciting items of tomorrow?
We can't ignore its positive aspects.
History will show that almost all of our
progress and innovations have been due
to the fact that people aren't content to
rest on the laurels of the previous gen
eration.
This may seem all fine and dandy until
we realize that in always looking ahead
to the cutting edge, we lose track of the
present, of what we're losing. For every
new Teddy Ruxpin that we get, there's
a Cabbage Patch Kid abandoned. In many
ways, our fickleness is frightening.
How many people were brought to
tears when the Chinese students in
Tiananmen Square were attacked early
June 4 last year. How many people
carried candles at the vigil or wore black
armbands for a week after? How many
people just flipped the page two months
later when they saw the headline that
the Chinese students were being ex
ecuted?

It's odd, if not sad, to watch as issues
go from being red hot to unknown. What
ever happened to the hole in the ozone?
Or the Louis Jackson case? Or the war
on drugs? Or our thousand points of
light? Or the all-important pledge of al
legiance? Seemingly, they've all joined
Erik Estrada and Jimmy Osmond in the
land of the lost.
So, what's the big message to come
out of all of this? For a lot of us who
are caught up in the momentum of a
?[uick-paced society, it's already too much
or us to slow down and smell the roses
or even look around and remember all
the time.
Maybe the best we can do is remind
ourselves that there are roses out there
and that in our quest for the stronger,
faster and better, we don't place a new
freeway lane over them.
Oh, and I wasn't joking about The
Brady Bunch stuff. Mike, Carol, Greg,
Marcia, Peter, Jan, Bobby and Cindy
were played by Robert Reed, Florence
Henderson, Barry White, Maureen
McCormick, Christopher Knight, Eve
Plum, Mike Lookinland and Susan Olsen,
respectively. And Alice was Ann B. Davis.
No foolin'.
