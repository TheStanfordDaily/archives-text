## Freshmen leap into starting lineup Oden, Paaso key Cardinal 
### Harold Yu Staff writer 
Last year, freshmen super
stars Kristin Klein and Amy
Cooper stepped into the Cardinal
volleyball lineup proving in
strumental in the team's second
place Pacific 10 Conference
finish. This year's class of
recruits appears to be closely fol
lowing suit.
With Bev Oden, Carrie
Feldman, and Kristi Paaso start
ing consistently on Don Shaw's
nationally-ranked squad and the
steadfast contributions of Laurie
Sawin, the freshman class has
impressively undertaken a
decided role in the success of
this year's Cardinal.
Leading the freshmen foray is
Volleyball Monthly's Player of
the Year, the top-rated Fab 50
high school player in the nation,
and the consensus number one
recruit in the country, Irvine's
Bev Oden.
Blessed, according to coach
Shaw, with "outstanding natu
ral abilities that others just don't
have" and a remarkably devel
oped "court sense," Oden
realized general pre-season ex
pectations by stepping immedi
ately into the starting lineup.
"Nothing's automatic [con
cerning who will start]. But Bev
showed us early in the preseason
that she can do the things we
want her to do," Shaw said.
Doing more than what coaches
"want her to do," however, is
what Oden is accustomed to
delivering. Since abandoning
soccer and softball, her first
athletic endeavors, in the
seventh grade, Oden has accum
ulated a menacing array of
honors.
In addition to being named
the best player in the country
last year by Volleyball Monthly,
Oden was celebrated as the Cal
ifornia Interscholastic Federa
tion player of the year in both
1987 and 1988 and the Califor
nia player of the year in '88.
Her dominating presence
spurred her club team to reign
as the Junior Olympics Cham
pions last year and her Irvine
high school team to make state
history as California champions
two years in a row. This year
Bev attended the Olympic festi
val where the top amateur vol

leyball athletes in the country
participated.
Oden's ascension in the volley
ball world was initially inspired
by an intense case of sibling
jealousy. Both of Bev's sisters,
highly recognized national
players, indirectly lured the
younger Oden into the sport by
their early involvement.
She recalls fondly, "Kim and
Elaina always brought home
trophies. Every weekend, they
would return with something. In
the sports like soccer and
Softball I played, I always had
to wait until the very end of the
season to get anything. I got
really frustrated and so I told
myself that I'd play club volley
ball."
While her sisters catalyzed her
introduction to the sport, their
remarkable success — idm
the captain of the U.S. Olympic
team in Seoul, Elaina has led
the UOP Tigers to two national
championships — has simulta
neously placed a tremendous
amount of pressure upon her to
excel.
"I've been hearing speculation
from the beginning that I could
be better than my sisters," Oden
said. "It's really hard to deal
with because you are expected
to do everything right. I've al

ways been afraid my coaches
would be disappointed."
Now she understands that
"it's not really worth worrying
about. I just try to think about
playing and playing well."
Pressure or not, her new
teammates certainly recognize
the influence Bo — as she is
called for her long, braided hair
and initials — has in every
match.
"I've played against Bev for
two years and I'm glad I'm play
ing with her," said freshman set
ter Carrie Feldman. "She's a
great player who's really smart.
Opposing teams tend to key in
on her even here. Everyone
knows she has a lot of weapons."
Her daunting arsenal seems to
be initiating talk of the Olympics
among followers of the game.
The mere prospect that the three
Oden sisters may play together
on the United States team has
already begun to excite volleyball
fanatics.
While admitting that the
Olympiad would be a "great ex
perience," Oden, as is her
nature, shies away from confi
dently endorsing the probability
of her making the team.
"I just don't know if I'm ready.
I need a lot more experience and
a lot more skill to even think

about trying out. It's a long way
off and I'm not thinking about
it as part of my near future,"
she said.
Rather, the star middle
blocker concentrates on the pres
ent status of a team that she
feels "definitely has as much tal
ent as any other team in the
country," but sometimes lacks
the ability to "work together."
Keenly surveying Kristi Paaso
at Stanford's volleyball camp for
a couple of years, head coach
Shaw knew exactly what he was
getting in the 5-11 starting hitter
from Los Altos Hills.
"The thing that attracted us
to Kristi was her competitive
ness and her intensity Every
body that we've ever talked to
has raved about her intensity
and spirit. We've got to have
players like that," Shaw said.
Paaso developed this trait ear
ly, excelling in sports such as
track and soccer prior to entering
the volleyball scene during the
eighth grade. Displaying a mar
velous athleticism, Paaso main
tained full involvement in all
three sports throughout high
school, earning distinction in
each.
Volleyball, however, was al

with the distinguished Los Altos
club team and "working hard" on
her own, Paaso immediately es
tablished herself as an influential
force in the women's game. A

American and Peninsula Times
Tribune Athlete of the Year,
Paaso propelled her Los Altos
High team to the state champi
onship semifinals last year before
running into Oden's Irvine squad.
Despite her year-round commit
ment to athletics, the intensely
self-motivated Paaso has excelled
admirably in academics. A Na
tional Merit Scholar, she was
merely "encouraged to do what
ever" she wanted by her parents,
a freedom that resulted in her

uncompromised pursuit of almost
every discipline she encountered.
"It's amazing all the things
Kristi can do," raved an impressed
Oden. "She's so good at every
thing, it blows my mind."
Her predominant characteristic,
nevertheless, has been the
vigorous spirit with which she has

"Kristi just doesn't give up,"
said Feldman, who competed
against Paaso for several years
before they came to Stanford.
"She wants to win and she's set
real high standards for herself.
When it's not working, she's really
hard on herself."
"More so than any other player

on the team," Coach Shaw
remarked, "Kristi hates to lose."
While this intensity, in Kristi's
own opinion, can "help the team"
by motivating her teammates and
elevating their level of play, the
prize freshman hitter also con
cedes that her "intensity can get

too hard on myself. 1 have certain
expectations of myself — I tend
to be a perfectionist."
After seeing limited action at
the advent of the season, Paaso
commandeered a starting position
through sheer desire. She has
since relished every such oppor
tunity. "It's great to start. I hope
I can maintain it," Paaso noted.
