# Spikers psyched for Trojan tussle
## 
### Chris Crader Editorial staff 
Tonight might seem a little
strange for the Cardinal women's
volleyball team.
A little after 6 p.m. the team
will take the floor in Old Pavilion.
That in itself isn't that weird, as
the squad practices there every
day But what is unusual is that
the players will be wearing uni
forms, instead of a t-shirt and
shorts.
For the first time in almost
three weeks, the Cardinal gets to
play a home match.
Due to a quirky schedule, can
cellations and a postponement due
to the earthquake, only four of
Stanford's 18 matches this year
have been at home. But with three
teams in the nation's top 10 on
tap in the next five days, the Car
dinal could not have found a bet
ter time to return to Old Pavilion.
Stanford, ranked seventh na
tionally, begins the homestand
against No. 9 USC tonight at 7:30
p.m. The Cardinal also hosts No.
2 UCLA tomorrow night and
fourth-ranked University of the
Pacific Tuesday night. All three
matches will be played in Old Pa
vilion, and only the first 1,200
people will be allowed entrance to
avoid creating a fire hazard.
Stanford lost in three straight
games to the Trojans four weeks
ago, but after the Cardinal
thumped both No. 15 Oregon and
unranked Oregon State last week
end, Coach Don Shaw thinks his
team can avenge that loss.
"We're playing a lot better," he
said. "We're much improved since
we last played USC and UCLA.
We were in a slump then."
The Trojans have been in some
what of a slump lately, dropping
three of their last five matches
to fall to 16-7 overall. They are
led by Megan McCallister, who set
the Pacific 10 Conference hitting
percentage record by hitting .391
as a freshman. The junior hasn't
fallen off much as she leads the
team in kills.
Other players to watch include
6-foot-2 bomber Lonise Norfleet
and the team's dig leader, Yleana
Carrasco. Carrasco may be only
5-8, but while in high school she
high-jumped 6 feet.
Norfleet has 310 kills, a .262
hitting percentage, a team-high 30
aces, 16 digs and 65 blocks.
Finally, setter Christine Brig
man, who has 209 digs and is
averaging 12.9 assists per game,

will run the offense for USC.
Stanford ended a 10-day,
earthquake-related layoff from
matches by losing to San Jose
State a week ago Tuesday, but
the team is now in much better
shape. "We did a good job this
weekend," Shaw said. "The big
difference was mental prepared
ness and concentration. . . . We
shouldn't have shown up (against
San Jose State). We should have
just mailed in a loss."
Over the last weekend, however,
Stanford dominated the Ducks
and the Beavers and freshman
Bev Oden earned Pac-10 Player
of-the-Week honors in the process.
The middle blocker had 44 kills,
32 digs, 15 total blocks and hit a
stellar .500 for the three matches
last week to win the honor.
Shaw is hoping the weekend's
play will carry over to tonight
against a Trojan team that is only
percentage points behind the
second-place Cardinal in the Pac
-10 race.
"We came out for Oregon ready
to play," he said. "Hopefully the
players learned a real lesson on
how that can help you. . . . We're
trying to learn how to do the right
things every day, whether it's a
practice or a match.
"We just need to play better
and make fewer mistakes. We
need to force them to beat us by
playing better than us."
Card notes
Oden continues to lead the Pac-10
in blocking, averaging 1.79 blocks per
game. She is second in hitting per
centage (.359) to UCLA's Daiva
Tomkus, who is at .418. Stanford's
Kristin Klein is fifth at .294. In other
stats, setter Carrie Feldman is third
in assist average at 11.83 per game,
and Klein is sixth in kills average at
4.01.
