# Life in the football trenches not a Field of Dreams
## 
### 
It started on a small field next to an
elementary school in Indiana.
I was in fourth grade and playing
my first year of football on the fifth and
sixth grade team. Like every other kid
who dreams of growing up to become a
football player, I wanted to be either a
star running back or quarterback.
Before practice started, I noticed that
I was one of the biggest kids on the field.
Obviously, my coach noticed the same
thing because before the workout ended
I had been converted from an aspiring
running back, and potential Heisman
Trophy winner, to a lineman.
I think every lineman has a star run
ning back inside of him somewhere, but
the problem is that the back always gets
stuck in the fat rolls on the way out.
The youth football leagues ought to do
away with linemen all together, because
once a kid is labeled "lineman" he rarely
can extricate himself from the
stereotypes that go along with it.
It just doesn't seem fair that I should
be sentenced to a life in the trenches
simply because I was bigger than most
of the other kids on my team when I
was nine years old.
When I was 10 years old, my family
moved from Indiana to Arizona. Here
was a great opportunity to start over and

tell the coaches in Tucson that I was
something other than a lineman.
However, I think my old coach in In
diana wrote a note on my forehead in a
special ink which could only be seen by
other coaches. It read, "Put this kid on
the line."
Like most of the linemen who play
college football, I played on both the of
fensive and defensive lines in high school.
High school football is where you learn
how truly humbling it is to play down
in the pit.
It is in high school where games start
to get written up in the newspapers. It
seems as though at some point during
the season everybody who does not play
on the line gets their name mentioned
in the paper. As a defensive lineman there

is a slight chance that you will get some
attention, either from an important sack
or a fumble recovery.
As an offensive lineman, you only get
mentioned as a part of the whole. For
example, "The offensive line of the Fight
ing Muscrats gave their quarterback,
Billy Superstar, plenty of time to throw
the ball."
I had one brief moment of glory in
high school. I completely missed a block
and our running back was hit so hard
that the ball popped out of his hands
and into mine.
After the shock of holding a football
in my hands wore off, I shot down the
field at top speed (a steady jog for most
people). I made it 18 yards before I was
tackled. If you don't believe this play
happened, I still have the newspaper's
rushing statistics in my wallet to prove it.
Other than that 18-yard run, I didn't
receive much press coverage in high
school. If a player sincerely enjoys playing
football then the lack of media attention
won't bother him. Still, there are other
distasteful aspects to the life of a lineman.
When a lineman gets beat by an op
ponent, it is humiliating and painful. The
good part is that spectators seldom notice
it in the midst of the melee on the field.
Line play is the essence of all that is

Well, if you ask me, I
say that linemen are
the earth that stands
firm and gives the
linebackers an oppor
tunity to make a tackle.

violent and brutal in football.
There are no graceful catches or beau
tiful break away runs on the line. Our
defensive line coach pointecf out that
every kid wants to play catch with a
football, but not too many want to go
out in the backyard and work on their
blocking and tackling.
But there are some good parts to being
a lineman.
Because we need to be big, we get to
eat as much as we want, as long as we
don't get too fat and slow. We even get
in trouble if we haven't been eating
enough.
However, fatness and slowness will
only be tolerated to a certain limit. You

know you've hit the limit when the coach
looks at you and says, "you're too fat
and slow."
Another great thing about the line is
the camaraderie that is built among
linemen. A good line takes pride in what
it does, and goes through tedious drills
with spirited effort. We are the wretched
refuse of the gridiron, and our mutual
workman status is our bond.
The pride that is produced is curious.
It grows from a recognition of the fact
that no one except our teammates truly
appreciates how important we are. After
awhile, a nosetackle who has been
knocked to the ground by a doubleteam
block is excited because he enabled the
linebacker behind him to make the tackle.
One of our players had a high school
coach who said that defensive linemen
are only sod for linebackers' cleats.
Well, if you ask me, I say that linemen
are the earth that stands firm and gives
the linebackers an opportunity to make
a tackle. I can't help but think this way.
They indoctrinated me when I was
nine.

the football team, but his colleagues at
The Daily think of him as our resident
tailback.
