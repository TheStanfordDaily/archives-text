# Delays but 'progress' in Jackson case
## 
### John Wagner Editorial staff 
The judge, district attorney
and lawyer for junior Louis Jack
son met in closed chambers for
more than 90 minutes yesterday
— but emerged to announce on
the record only that the Oct. 17
earthquake had thrown the
court calendar off, further delay
ing Jackson's case.
Upon leaving court, however,
Jackson's lawyer, Joseph Bil
lingsley, said he thought prog
ress had been made behind
closed doors toward resolving
the case. "It looks like we're
close," Billingsley said.
Jackson still faces six mis
demeanor charges — including
inciting to riot and battery —
in connection with the May 15
takeover of University President
Donald Kennedy's office.
Following a discussion with
his lawyer, Jackson appeared
somewhat optimistic about his
fate.
"I think the DA wants to move
on things and the judge wants
to get it resolved," Jackson said.
"I think we're making progress."
At Jackson's last court appear
ance, on Oct. 12, Judge Stephen
Manley scheduled two subse
quent hearings: the first for Oct.
18 on a discovery motion filed
by Jackson's lawyer, the second
for 4 p.m. yesterday on a motion
to dismiss the battery charge.
The Oct. 18 court date was
canceled due to the earthquake,
and the hearing on the discovery
motion — an attempt to obtain
University records for Jackson's
defense — was moved to yester
day's court calendar.
Manley ordered yesterday that
all documents subpoenaed from
Stanford be turned over to Jack
son's lawyer. As a result of the
discovery motion, Billingsley ob
tained the videotape which al
legedly captures Jackson inciting
the crowd to riot outside Build
ing 10, as well as dozens of still
photos used in Stanford's inter
nal investigation of the takeover.
But discussion on the battery
charge never took place outside
of closed chambers yesterday.
Mandy MacCalla, the recep
tionist who is the alleged victim
in the battery, had been served
a subpoena and sat in the court
room yesterday for more than
an hour while the closed
