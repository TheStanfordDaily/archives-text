# Delays but 'progress' in Jackson case
## 
### John Wagner Editorial staff 
The judge, district attorney
and lawyer for junior Louis Jack
son met in closed chambers for
more than 90 minutes yesterday
— but emerged to announce on
the record only that the Oct. 17
earthquake had thrown the
court calendar off, further delay
ing Jackson's case.
Upon leaving court, however,
Jackson's lawyer, Joseph Bil
lingsley, said he thought prog
ress had been made behind
closed doors toward resolving
the case. "It looks like we're
close," Billingsley said.
Jackson still faces six mis
demeanor charges — including
inciting to riot and battery —
in connection with the May 15
takeover of University President
Donald Kennedy's office.
Following a discussion with
his lawyer, Jackson appeared
somewhat optimistic about his
fate.
"I think the DA wants to move
on things and the judge wants
to get it resolved," Jackson said.
"I think we're making progress."
At Jackson's last court appear
ance, on Oct. 12, Judge Stephen
Manley scheduled two subse
quent hearings: the first for Oct.
18 on a discovery motion filed
by Jackson's lawyer, the second
for 4 p.m. yesterday on a motion
to dismiss the battery charge.
The Oct. 18 court date was
canceled due to the earthquake,
and the hearing on the discovery
motion — an attempt to obtain
University records for Jackson's
defense — was moved to yester
day's court calendar.
Manley ordered yesterday that
all documents subpoenaed from
Stanford be turned over to Jack
son's lawyer. As a result of the
discovery motion, Billingsley ob
tained the videotape which al
legedly captures Jackson inciting
the crowd to riot outside Build
ing 10, as well as dozens of still
photos used in Stanford's inter
nal investigation of the takeover.
But discussion on the battery
charge never took place outside
of closed chambers yesterday.
Mandy MacCalla, the recep
tionist who is the alleged victim
in the battery, had been served
a subpoena and sat in the court
room yesterday for more than
an hour while the closed

chambers conference took place.
MacCalla has signed a civil com
promise agreement saying she has
no complaint against Jackson.
The battery charge is still pend
ing, however, because the district
attorney has filed a statement of
opposition, stating the alleged bat
tery occurred under "riotous"
conditions.
According to state law, mis
demeanors which take place un
der such conditions cannot be
settled by a civil compromise
agreement.
Shortly after 5 p.m. yesterday,
MacCalla was told by Diana Bul
lock, a co-counsel for Jackson,

that the hearing on the motion
to drop the battery charge had
been delayed until Dec. 1 and that
she could go home.
On the way out of court, Asst.
District Attorney Thomas Fahren
holz said the motion to dismiss
the battery charge had never been
scheduled for yesterday.
"I don't even know why [Mac-
Calla] was here," Fahrenholz said.
"I knew there wasn't going to be
a motion today."
Pre-trial motions are usually
scheduled for Friday calenders
and heard by another judge, Fah
renholz said. "This wasn't a mo
tion calendar," he said.
Fahrenholz was not the repre
sentative from the district attor
ney's office at Jackson's Oct. 12
hearing.

Billingsley said that because
of the earthquake, the discovery
motion was heard yesterday and
the hearing on the battery was
delayed. "Basically, now we're
kicked back because of the earth
quake," he said. "Sometimes the
wheels just roll slow."
In the courtroom, Manley said
that the hearing on the motion
to dismiss the battery charge
would have to be delayed and
heard by another judge. It would
be inappropriate for the judge
who will try the case to conduct
pre-trial discussion regarding
resolution of the case, Manley
said.
Manley applauded the "good
faith" of both Jackson's attorney
and the district attorney in fol

lowing the court's request to
resolve Jackson's case in a timely
manner.
Fahrenholz said the district at
torney's office has been "trying
to be accomodating" about Jack
son's case and that any perceived
delays were due to legal procedure
and the summer break.
He said the statement of oppo
sition to dropping the battery
charge had been filed out of ne
cessity. It is the district attorney's
job to make sure procedures set
forth by the law are followed, he
said.
Billingsley said that he would
work to resolve the case on an
informal basis with the district
attorney prior to the Dec. 1 court
date.

chambers conference took place.
MacCalla has signed a civil com
promise agreement saying she has
no complaint against Jackson.
The battery charge is still pend
ing, however, because the district
attorney has filed a statement of
opposition, stating the alleged bat
tery occurred under "riotous"
conditions.
According to state law, mis
demeanors which take place un
der such conditions cannot be
settled by a civil compromise
agreement.
Shortly after 5 p.m. yesterday,
MacCalla was told by Diana Bul
lock, a co-counsel for Jackson,

that the hearing on the motion
to drop the battery charge had
been delayed until Dec. 1 and that
she could go home.
On the way out of court, Asst.
District Attorney Thomas Fahren
holz said the motion to dismiss
the battery charge had never been
scheduled for yesterday.
"I don't even know why [Mac-
Calla] was here," Fahrenholz said.
"I knew there wasn't going to be
a motion today."
Pre-trial motions are usually
scheduled for Friday calenders
and heard by another judge, Fah
renholz said. "This wasn't a mo
tion calendar," he said.
Fahrenholz was not the repre
sentative from the district attor
ney's office at Jackson's Oct. 12
hearing.

Billingsley said that because
of the earthquake, the discovery
motion was heard yesterday and
the hearing on the battery was
delayed. "Basically, now we're
kicked back because of the earth
quake," he said. "Sometimes the
wheels just roll slow."
In the courtroom, Manley said
that the hearing on the motion
to dismiss the battery charge
would have to be delayed and
heard by another judge. It would
be inappropriate for the judge
who will try the case to conduct
pre-trial discussion regarding
resolution of the case, Manley
said.
Manley applauded the "good
faith" of both Jackson's attorney
and the district attorney in fol

lowing the court's request to
resolve Jackson's case in a timely
manner.
Fahrenholz said the district at
torney's office has been "trying
to be accomodating" about Jack
son's case and that any perceived
delays were due to legal procedure
and the summer break.
He said the statement of oppo
sition to dropping the battery
charge had been filed out of ne
cessity. It is the district attorney's
job to make sure procedures set
forth by the law are followed, he
said.
Billingsley said that he would
work to resolve the case on an
informal basis with the district
attorney prior to the Dec. 1 court
date.
The judge, district attorney
and lawyer for junior Louis Jack
son met in closed chambers for
more than 90 minutes yesterday
— but emerged to announce on
the record only that the Oct. 17
earthquake had thrown the
court calendar off, further delay
ing Jackson's case.
Upon leaving court, however,
Jackson's lawyer, Joseph Bil
lingsley, said he thought prog
ress had been made behind
closed doors toward resolving
the case. "It looks like we're
close," Billingsley said.
Jackson still faces six mis
demeanor charges — including
inciting to riot and battery —
in connection with the May 15
takeover of University President
Donald Kennedy's office.
Following a discussion with
his lawyer, Jackson appeared
somewhat optimistic about his
fate.
"I think the DA wants to move
on things and the judge wants
to get it resolved," Jackson said.
"I think we're making progress."
At Jackson's last court appear
ance, on Oct. 12, Judge Stephen
Manley scheduled two subse
quent hearings: the first for Oct.
18 on a discovery motion filed
by Jackson's lawyer, the second
for 4 p.m. yesterday on a motion
to dismiss the battery charge.
The Oct. 18 court date was
canceled due to the earthquake,
and the hearing on the discovery
motion — an attempt to obtain
University records for Jackson's
defense — was moved to yester
day's court calendar.
Manley ordered yesterday that
all documents subpoenaed from
Stanford be turned over to Jack
son's lawyer. As a result of the
discovery motion, Billingsley ob
tained the videotape which al
legedly captures Jackson inciting
the crowd to riot outside Build
ing 10, as well as dozens of still
photos used in Stanford's inter
nal investigation of the takeover.
