# Men's soccer tackles Gaels
## 
### Andrew Wilcox Staff writer 
With only two games left in
the season and playoff hopes out
of the question, the Cardinal
men's soccer team's contest
against St. Mary's today in
Moraga will serve as a building
block fof the future, yet will
signal the near-culmination of
the careers of the team's three
seniors.
The Cardinal, which stands
at 8-9-2 on the season, will also
attempt to avert its first losing
season in three years. After suf
ferring a 3-0 defeat to Washing
ton Sunday in its final home
game, the squad finds itself

mired in a late-season slump
and struggling to close on a re
spectable note.
Coach Sam Koch's squad,
which tallied a 12-9-1 mark in
1988, hopes to end the season
with some positive momentum
for next year.
In contrast, St. Mary's is
clinging to slim postseason

chances and must win all of its
remaining games to be consid
ered for the playoffs. The Gaels,
ranked ninth in the West, have
encountered the same problem
as Stanford â€” playing poorly
against lesser opponents.
Despite victories against
tough teams such as University
of San Francisco and San Diego
State, St. Mary's also suc
cumbed to a mediocre California
squad.
"It was a big letdown when
we found out we wouldn't make
the playoffs, but we don't want
to end on a down note. We're
trying to create something to
build on for next year," senior
Mark Sem ioh said.
