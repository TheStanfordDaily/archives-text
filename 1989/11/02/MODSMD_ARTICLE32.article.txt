Wednesday at Berkeley the No.
4 Stanford water polo team ran
into a scoring machine named
Chris Humbard.
The 6-8 south-paw scored two
goals in the last three minutes to
break an 8-8 tie and allow No. 1
California to swim to a 10-8 vic
tory and remain unbeaten in four
Pacific 10 Conference games.
"(California! is a very strong
team," said Coach Dante Det
tamanti. "I think we match up
with them in every phase of the
game. Humbard is the difference."
The National team member
scored four goals, his season
average, but the last two proved
to be the difference. Dettamanti

expressed that his basic game plan
was to stop Humbard, and the
team did not do that.
"If Humbard gets four goals
then Cal wins," Dettamanti said.
"You have to hold him to two or
three goals to win."
The game, which dropped Stan
ford to 2-2 in the Pac-10, opened
up with a flurry of goals. Califor
nia had two quick tallies in the
first minute and a half, and a
worried Dettamanti called a time
out.
"I just told them to settle

down," Dettemanti said. "I
reminded them what we were
trying to do defensively."
The words must have been
soothing, as a calmer Stanford
squad came back into the water
and fought back to the first of
what would be six different tied
scores at 2-2. California scored to
make it 3-2, and Stanford came
back to tie. California scored to
go up 4-3, and Stanford came back
to tie. This trend continued once
more before the half ended with
the teams knotted at 5-6.
The pace of the first half was
as hectic as the scoring.
"The first half was quick, " Det
tamanti said. "There was lots of
swimming. It was just up and
down, up and down."
The second half saw both the
scoring and the swimming slow
down, but that was about all that
changed. The third quarter began
with California scoring and Stan
ford again fighting back to even.
Stanford would never lead.

Humbard ended the 6-6 tie with
35 seconds left in the third quar
ter with his second goal of the
game. The trend of California go
ahead — Stanford tie, was broken
early in the fourth quarter as Cal
ifornia went up by two, 8-6.
Yet Stanford had come back
from two goals down early in the
game and in the fourth quarter
they proved it was no fluke. Ac
cording to Dettamanti, California

had set up its defense to key on
Jeff Oeding in order to stop his
scoring threat. Oeding was score
less until he put in two quick
goals to even the score at 8-8.
This was the last tie of the game
and signaled the start of the Chris
Humbard show.
He swam down the pool alone
and scored. California was up 9-8
when Humbard scored on a sweep
shot to make it 10-8.
