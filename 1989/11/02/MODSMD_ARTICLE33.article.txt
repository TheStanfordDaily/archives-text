# Booters down Dons, 1-0
## 
### Michael Clayton Staff writer 
SAN FRANCISCO - After
finishing a string of tough games
against top-20 squads, the Stan
ford women's soccer team com
pleted its season yesterday with
a 1-0 victory against a weak Uni
versity of San Francisco team.
"In a roller coaster season it's
nice to get back on level ground,"
sophomore Michele Sullivan com
mented after the game.
The Stanford squad was not
pushed by USF. Stanford, playing
without four starters, juniors Jen
nifer Rowland and Jen Bloomer,
senior Blair Elliott and sophomore
Kim Peterson, controlled the ball
in its offensive half for most of
the game with Cardinal players
easily dribbling past their over
matched opponents.
San Francisco did manage to
release nine shots on junior goalie
Elise Edwards, but the weak at
tempts did not force Edwards to
make the same array of diving
saves as in her previous two
shutouts.
Stanford finished the season
with less intensity than in recent
games. In comparison to the high
tension games against North

Women's Soccer

Cardinal 1
Dons 0

Carolina and UC-Santa Barbara
where the Cardinal found the
passing lanes continually stopped
up, the Stanford players found
few Dons impeding their ball
movement, and Stanford moved
the ball across the field at will.
With the pressure of postseason
selection behind them, Stanford
showed signs of reduced tension,
releasing relieved smiles and
chuckles with each error rather
than the customary groans of
frustration. Coach Berhane An
deberhan played all of the field
players who were physically able
to contribute.
"We were playing well but not
brilliantly," Anderberhan said.
"It's hard to get motivated when
the challenge isn't there."
Junior Lisa Sime scored the
final Cardinal goal of the season
just under 30 minutes into the
game. Freshman Carolyn Einstein
crossed a long ball from the right
side of the field to classmate Leni
Nonoshita. Nonoshita stopped the
ball and moved past the Don

defender and hit Sime right in
front of the goal. Sime stretched
her right foot out to put the Car
dinal up 1-0.
The Cardinal finished its diffi
cult schedule with an 11-4-3
record. This season Stanford out
scored its opponents 47-12. Ed
wards completed a stellar season
with 11 shutouts, and freshman
standout Julie Foudy led the team
in scoring with 12 goals and 10
assists. Rowland completed the
season with 13 goals and 6 assists.
Next season Stanford promises
to continue with the successful
process of the program. The Car
dinal will return 20 of 24 players,
losing only four players, Elliott,
Tonya Antonucci, Jenny Howick
and Christine Martin, to gradua
tion.
The young squad will begin the
1990 trek next week, continuing
practice on a limited basis, before
beginning serious conditioning at
the start of winter quarter.
"It was unfortunate the way we
had to end the season in this man
ner (without receiving a playoff
bid)," freshman goalie Christine
Massell said. "Next season, we
won't leave ths decision up to the
committee."
