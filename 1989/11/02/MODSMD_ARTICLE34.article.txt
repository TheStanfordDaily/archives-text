# INTERMISSION
## Great cookie rating contest 
### Martha Brockenbrough Editorial staff 
THE STX ffi\ ENTERTAINING WEEKLY

It's hard to imagine a world
without chocolate — let alone one
without chocolate chip cookies.
But the ultimate dessert — and
the tastiest aphrodisiac — hasn't
always been around in the abun
dance, or the form, that it is
around in today.
We have Columbus to thank for
bringing cocoa beans back to Eu
rope on his fourth and final trip
to the New World. And Cortez,
another luminary figure in choco
late history, spied the Aztec Em
peror Montezuma sipping goblets
of the unsweetened stuff flavored
with vanilla and ground hot pep
pers.
(Nothing is known regarding the
effect this drink had on the human
stomach. It is interesting to com
pare the drink's name, xocolatl,
with the word Ex-Lax™. This over
the-counter wonder ironically
cures Montezuma's revenge.)
And some 570 years later, choc
olate had hardened into the
familiar bar form when Tollhouse
Inn hostess Ruth Wakefield ran
out of nuts (gasp!). Not the sort
to panic in a pinch, she replaced
the missing ingredient in her "But
ter Drop-Do" cookies with a Nestle
chocolate bar.
The glass of milk, and the whole
world, for that matter, haven't
been the same since.
Even Stanford has been rocked

by this culinary earthquake Choc
olate chip cookies, as well as
modern variations on the time
tested theme, are stacked dozens
deep at the Tresidder Express, the
Bookstore, Baker Street and, on
rare occasions, on University Food
Service trays.
But if you're feeling particularly
worldly, specialty cookie stores —
with especially good cookies —
abound in Palo Alto.
In a scientifically conducted sur
vey, The Daily rated cookies from
the assorted campus suppliers and
specialty stores in the area, as well
as bake-at-home numbers con
cocted in a Redwood City factory.
Cookies came from the follow
ing competitors:
• Baker Street, in Tresidder Un
ion;
• Bianca's Cookies, in the
grocery-store freezer,-
• Blue Chip, from the Bookstore;
• The Cookie Habit, in the
Shopping Center;
• The Cookie Stop, 2333 Birch
St.;
• The Palo Alto Baking Compa
ny, 381 California Ave.; and
• Sweet Amy's, 728 Willow Rd.
in Menlo Park.
Judged in a blind taste-test by a
panel of experts, the cookies were
rated on a scale of one to five
according to size, appearance, tex
ture, quantity of morsels, origin
ality and the sound they made
while being chewed.
To keep the flavors of the
various cookies from merging in

the mouths of the dedicated tasting
panel, saltine crackers were pro
vided as palate cleansers.
And the judges rated the Book
store's Blue Chip cookies as the
best around, awarding them 4.2
out of a possible 5 on the "Yummy
Factor" scale.
This isn't to say, however, that
the other cookies weren't good.
Bianca's Cookies, which come as
frozen dough from the super
market, ranked right up there with
the blue-ribbon winning Blue Chip
creations.
Bianca's nine varieties are
cooked with all natural ingredi
ents, including oat bran and whole
wheat flour. Less butter and sugar
are used, resulting in a grainier
texture, but an overall healthier
cookie.
If you don't have an oven,
though, you may just want to go
to The Cookie Habit at the mall,
or the Cookie Stop on California
Ave. Both companies bake similar
cookies, and taste good enough to
satisfy any craving.
Baker Street also serves some
respectable cookies, although they
tended to be on the greasy side.
The Palo Alto Baking Company
sells very chic-looking cookies —
but they taste decidedly packaged.
Their spice cookies, however, were
a favorite of several judges.
The chocolate chip-oatmeal
cookies from Sweet Amy's in
Menlo Park were large, although
their floury texture cost them in
the ratings.

panel, saltine crackers were pro
vided as palate cleansers.
And the judges rated the Book
store's Blue Chip cookies as the
best around, awarding them 4.2
out of a possible 5 on the "Yummy
Factor" scale.
This isn't to say, however, that
the other cookies weren't good.
Bianca's Cookies, which come as
frozen dough from the super
market, ranked right up there with
the blue-ribbon winning Blue Chip
creations.
Bianca's nine varieties are
cooked with all natural ingredi
ents, including oat bran and whole
wheat flour. Less butter and sugar
are used, resulting in a grainier
texture, but an overall healthier
cookie.
If you don't have an oven,
though, you may just want to go
to The Cookie Habit at the mall,
or the Cookie Stop on California
Ave. Both companies bake similar
cookies, and taste good enough to
satisfy any craving.
Baker Street also serves some
respectable cookies, although they
tended to be on the greasy side.
The Palo Alto Baking Company
sells very chic-looking cookies —
but they taste decidedly packaged.
Their spice cookies, however, were
a favorite of several judges.
The chocolate chip-oatmeal
cookies from Sweet Amy's in
Menlo Park were large, although
their floury texture cost them in
the ratings.
