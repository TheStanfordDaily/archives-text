# 'The Seagull' soars

For a production that embodies
the true risk-taking spirit of the
art of theater, head over to The
Little Theater for the Drama De
partment's production of Anton
Chekhov's play, "The Seagull."
Without a doubt, the risks taken,
and the sometimes unorthodox
staging of the production directed
by graduate student Zander
Brietzke, are successful and tho
roughly entertaining.
Although heavy in dialogue and
less so in action, the play is the
story of a bourgeois Russian boy
and girl whose pursuit of artistic
lifestyles (he of a writer and she
an actress) lead them ultimately
to confront themselves in light of
the illusions on which many of
their passions were founded.
During the two years of the
story, which is set on a Russian
country estate, spans, many sub
plots arise and further enhance this
theme of illusion. The sub-plots
also enhance the play's comic na
ture, telling very, human tales of
love, aspiration, youth, life and
death.
Unorthodox staging, coupled
with a brilliant set designed by
fifth year senior Allen Blue, com
plements the play's intricacies. In
one set design, action occurs in
side, outside and amidst different
rooms simultaneously.
The "stage within a stage"
echoes nicely the similar trials and
tribulations of various characters
involved in the many sub-plots.
The final scene between Treplev
(James Loehlin) and Nina (Krista
Hoeppner) in particular makes

good use of this concept.
In the midst of one of the play's
more crucial scenes, a conversa
tion between the two protagonists,
a simultaneous, yet separate scene
occurs between the rest of the prin
ciple characters. The result pro
vides a true sense of the play as
a comedy, and of the irony and
displacement amidst the charac
ters.
Characterization was a strong
point of the production. In partic
ular, outstanding performances
come from Anne McNaughton,
playing the role of Arkadina,
Treplev's mother, from Polly Fire
stone, in the role of Masha, and
from James Loehlin as Treplev. In
these roles, even more than others,
the characters never faltered.
Although the play is made up
of primarily two-person scenes,
there are occasions when the entire
cast is together on stage at one
time. On almost all these occa
sions the sense of ensemble was
very strong, particularly in the
scene when Nina performs in
Treplev's play. This added to the
worth of the production con
siderably.
Some minor problems came in
the more rudimentary aspccts of
the production of lighting and
vocalization. At times it is difficult
to see facial expressions of char
acters as they are shadowed from
the trees on the set. Only in certain
spaces does this problem occur,
but nonetheless it is frustrating to
be denied the privileges that come
with seeing productions in small,
intimate spaces like that of Little
Theater.
