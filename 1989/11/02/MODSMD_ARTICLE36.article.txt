# Theater is best cure for Blue(s)
## 
### Anita Schneider 
Stanford Drama major Allen Blue is in his fifth
undergraduate year, but not because he's failed
classes. Because of his high involvement with campus
theatrical organizations, he's been too busy to take
them.
Working mainly with the Drama Department and
Ram's Head Theatrical Society, Blue has served as
set designer, lighting designer, technical director, di
rector, actor and technician on shows too numerous
to list. He admits to overextending himself, and is
quite aware of his "strange" devotion to theater.
Anton Chekhov's "The Seagull" opened yesterday
at the Little Theater, and Blue designed its set as
his honors project.
While he has found vast rewards from the theatrical
positions he's held at Stanford — and East Berlin,
Munich and Alaska during summers — his real love
is designing the scenery and lights for a show. "Design
is closest to the way 1 think," he says, "closest to
my heart as far as visual representations of feelings."
Of Chekhov's comedy, "The Seagull," Blue adds,
"We've taken the set and sort of blown it apart. We
go a long way to abstract the world of Moscow at
the turn of the century, and essentially the characters
have nothing left to their world — we've taken away
the walls. We've got sort of a forest and some furniture
and a backdrop and some leaves scattered all over
the floor. What's left is a big neutral space."
He's excited about director Zander Brietzke's new,
smoother acting translation because "A lot of the
other texts of 'The Seagull' are unactable."
A tremendous need to communicate drives Blue
to spend his days and nights designing sets, lights,
costumes and attending to the general business of
theater. And his work is seldom without rewards.
Blue is Artistic Director of Ram's Head, the student
run theatrical organization. "It's a social group, and
there are a lot of good people in Ram's Head," he says.
"My best lesson from the theater is learning to
work with other people, a lot of whom you don't get
are accepted and say to them, 'Your
idea will never work/ then you
learn how to reach compromises
and to find new solutions without
destroying a personal relationship
or a potential one. You can broaden
your horizons tremendously"
Blue designed the set for Ram's
Head's "A Chorus Line/' which
played last April. He will work on
"Evita" in the spring of 1990, as
well as collaborate with Assistant
Drama Prof. Sandra Richards on
"Paper Dolls/' a presentation of
the Black Performing Arts Group.
Much of his time, however, is
devoted to helping Ram's Head be
come more than the "campus com
pository of people who did musical
theater in high school." The goals
of the group have changed from
"let's get the show done" to "the
show will get done; let's do it well,"
to "let's make an artistic state
ment."
While the student-run Ram's
Head concentrates on "getting the
show on," the Drama Department
emphasizes learning. Non-drama
majors are invited to participate in
both groups.
In each of the main campus
theatrical organizations — the
Drama Department, Ram's Head,
Lively Arts, Stanford Savoyards and
the Black Performing Arts Group
— there's a demand for technical,
artistic and business support. "No
one person can drive everything
that needs to happen," Blue re
marks. "The more people we have
the more we'll be able to do."
Despite the competition from
film and television, Blue has no
doubt that it's worthwhile to keep
the heritage of theater alive. "A
play changes subtly from night to
night," Blue explains. "No matter
how many times you do it, it's
always going to have a different
emotional impact."
