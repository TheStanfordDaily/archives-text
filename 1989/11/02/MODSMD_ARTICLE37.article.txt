# Aliens, rampaging Sasquatches use new fall TV season to conquer Earth
## 
### 
Just when you thought TV had hit rock
bottom, along comcs this year's New Fall
Season to prove once again that television
always rises like a Tucson from the ashes.
The New Fall Season is a major event
in this country, heralded by the debut of
each network's New Flomey Jingle:
Come home and meet the stars with us
We'll be your fa-mi-ly
Our New Fall Season's torturous
Like drinking camel pee
Then the networks trot out their new
situation-comedies, which are the back
bone of any New Fall Season. Sitcoms are
reasonably inexpensive for the networks
because they are produced, using cheap
alien labor, on another planet. Come on,
you didn't really think sitcoms were made
by EARTHLINGS? Get real.
Unfortunately, these aliens, like most
Republicans, aren't too clear on what life
is like on the planet Earth, so they (the
aliens) produce shows that arc pretty
much backwards from the way we live.
They also haven't actually visited Earth
since 1957. You can tell if you watch
carefully:
Tonight on "Family Ties." Alex is sent
to his room after he borrows the car with
out asking for his parents' permission.

Will this cause him to miss President
Eisenhower's speech on TVf Find out
tonight, right here on this channel.
You may have also noticed another
trademark of alien production: All sitcoms
have the same set. The aliens are
notoriously cheap. Back in 1957, when
they visited Earth, the aliens rented some
cheap furniture and took it back to their
planet to furnish a standard sitcom set.
Ever wonder why there are so many UFO
sightings during the full moon? That's
when the payments arc due on the furni
ture.
Fiaving only one set ensures that all
sitcoms arc exactly alike. In fact, there is
really only ONE sitcom; they just change
the title every half-hour. It's really the
titles that are the funny parts, anyway.
Can you say "Leave it to Beaver" without
snickering? Flow 'bout "Puss in Boots?"

Just checking.
Anyway, because all sitcoms are basi
cally the same, the networks have had to
develop new types of shows to attract
viewers The most popular these days is
the TRAGIC DRAMA MOVIE OF THE
WEEK. These are Made-For-TV movies,
meaning that they arc aimed at an audi

ence which, by and large, thinks profes
sional wrestling is real.
Each network tries to out-tragedy the
rest:
NBC: When Marilyn Popengower
married James Smirklet he seemed like
the perfect husband. Then she discovered
what everv wife fears. Stay tuned to NBC
for "I MARRIED A SASQUATCH."
CBS: The passengers aboard Flight 763
never expected that terrorists would hijack
their airvlane to Switzerland. But now.
with only 36 hours until the terrorists
would detonate a bomb, the passengers
knew that only one woman could save
them — and even if she did, chances
were that many people would be seriously
maimed or dismembered, though not on
camera. Stay tuned to CBS for "KUNG
Fl! STEWARDESS."
ABC: The eyes of the nation were on
Brutville, Texas, last year when two-year
old deaf double-amputee leukemia patient
Jamie Brunson became trapped in an
abandoned backyard well during a deadly
hurricane that released toxic fumes into
the atmosphere. This is the story of her
heroic rescue, and of the child-snatchers
who sold her into the circus, which was
blown up by terrorist who

believed that professional wrestling was
real. Stay tuned to ABC for "WE KNOW
YOU'LL WATCH ANYTHING!"
You can also expect to see some new
"miniscrics" this Fall Season. Miniseries
are TV shows that arc filmed in extremely
exaggerated time frames. For instance, if
you've ever seen the fine documentary TV
show "M*A*S*H," you know that an en
tire helicopter-load full of wounded sol
diers can have complicated surgical
operations and be back on their feet within
half an hour, including commercials But
in the miniseries "War and Remembrance"

last year, it took 18 HOURS just to declare
war on Germany.
Not surprisingly, the networks don't ex
pect that anybody would actually want to
watch an 18-hour TV program, especially
an uplifting show about a major war So
they make it into a challenge. They DARE
you to watch all 18 hours. They tell you
that only a REAL AMERICAN can watch
all of "Winds of Eternity "
And sure enough, in Anvtown, USA,
Joe American plops down in front of his
television for sixteen consecutive nights
to PROVE that he can endure the entire
mmiscries. It doesn't matter that Joe
American's 86-year-old mother (Gladys
American) is having a fatal hemorrhage
on the floor tn front of the television. It
doesn't matter that every five minutes the
minisenes has a commercial break that
lasts longer than the actual war Because
Joe is going to watch the whole minisenes,
dammit, with his butt in the La-Z-Boy,
his feet on the coffee table, a bag of potato
chips in one hand and an ice cold bottle
of camel pee in the other.
