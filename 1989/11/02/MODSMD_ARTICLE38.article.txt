Get 'Emotional 7 tonight
If there wasn't fear of homosexuality, Romanovsky & Phillips
would probably be out of business, the gay performing duo
admits. Yet the folk-inspired musicians are going strong with
their new release, "Emotional." As part of the AIDS awareness
week, the Concert Network and the Stanford AIDS Task Force
is sponsoring their 8 p.m. concert tonight in Kresge Auditorium.
General Admission tickets are $10, $5 for students.
A glance at Dance
Dance Week '89 features a series of lecture-performances,
starting Mon. at 8 p.m. in Kresge Aud. with "Lipstick," where
a six-woman company illustrates how the blood of black female
ancestors still courses through the veins of black women today.
Tues. at 7:30 and 9:30 at the Elliot Program Center will be
performances of "Countdown to Liberation," an environmentally
focused production conceived and directed by Stanford student
Corey Davis. On Wed. a video-lecture on the black aesthetic,
and gender in dance and theater will be shown in Kresge Aud.
at 8. Admission to all Dance Week events is free.
