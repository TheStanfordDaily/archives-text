# 'Marci': Judging a hot, new band by their covers
## 
### Gene Anaya Senior staff writer 
In life, some things just are. In
sanity is one of those things, and
it afflicts every member of Marci
and the Moongods, one of Stan
ford's newest and hottest dance
bands.
The basic core of Marci and the
Moongods was formed last spring
when bassist Ravi Bellur
(sophomore, quantitative econom
ics and industrial engineering)
joined forces with drummer Mark
Geller (senior, biology).
Soon after they met, Bellur and
Geller began searching for a singer
and other musicians in order to
form a rock-oriented dance band.
Their search met with mixed
results but did provide them with
a wonderful vocalist in the form
of Carolyn Shapiro (junior, music

and English).
Although Shapiro is a talented
enough singer to front any band
on her own, this fall, Marci and
the Moongods enlisted the talents
of another vocalist, Todd Santos
(junior, international relations).
Santos' addition allows Marci and
the Moongods greater range in
their musical repertoire.
They also gained the services of
Sean Bennett (sophomore, Slavic
languages) on guitar and Andrew
Diamond (sophomore, biology) on
keyboards. As the band progresses,
Bennett and Diamond hope to find
the perfect dance mix between key
boards and guitar.
Rounding out the band members
are freshmen Ethan Diamond on
sax and Jesse Dorogusker on trum
pet, who add that extra punch in
songs like the Talking Heads'
"Burning Down the House."

Agreeing on a what songs to play
is never an easy task for Marci
and the Moongods. With so many
members, it is difficult to find
common musical interests.
Somehow, though, they have
managed to come up with an im
pressive playlist of dance songs
from bands like Mary's Danish
and The Cure . One of their best
cover tunes, though, is their rendi
tion of the B-52's "Channel Z"
which allows Shapiro to demon
strate her singing talents and vocal
range.
Although they are an excellent
cover band, one of Marci and the
Moongods' goals is to write original
dance songs. Currently, they have
written about eight songs but only
regularly play one by guitarist Ben
nett, "High Society." Other Marci
and the Moongods originals in
clude "Give That Girl A Decent

Man," "Equilibrium" and"Letters
From Jenny."
The size of the band makes per
fecting songs difficult and often
strains their relationships between
one another. They even joke about
"breaking up about once a week."
If the band doesn't self-destruct,
they hope to cut a demo tape in
the spring.

Because Marci is no longer with
the band, there is no coherent story
on where the name "Marci and
the Moongods" originates. It
depends on who you ask as to
whether they take credit for it or
blame it on someone else in the
band. About the only thing they
all agree on is that the name is
"basically just stupid."
