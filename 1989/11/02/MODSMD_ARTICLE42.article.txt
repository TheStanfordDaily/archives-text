# Harmon harmless, but 'Worth Winning' still not worth seeing

A bad script will result in a bad movie.
That's the bottom line as to why "Worth
Winning" isn't worth seeing. Of course,
having Mark Harmon star in the film
doesn't help much either.
"Worth Winning" tries to present the
noble theme that a man has to suffer, to
be humiliated and lose all his confidence
before he really knows how to love a wom
an.
The man made to suffer is Taylor

Worth, played by Harmon. Worth is your
average yuppie weatherman, living in your
typical Hollywood world in which every
one drives a BMW, Mercedes Bcnz or
Jaguar; all the men wear three-piece suites
with flowers in the lapel; and all the
women look like images from the latest
issue of Vogue.
Apparently Worth has what it takes to
make him a hot item with the ladies of
Philadelphia, but Harmon is unable to
bring any of these qualities to the screen.
Taylor accepts a bet from his friends
challenging him to get three women of

their choice to agree to marry him within
three months — enter the three beautiful
women of the film: Erin Cooper (Maria
Holvoe), Veronica Briskow (Madeleine
Stowe) and Eleanor Larrimore (Lesley Ann
Warren).
The set-up says it all. Worth has to be
Mr. Polite to win the heart of the naive
blonde beauty, Erin ; Mr. Romance to woo
Veronica, the classical pianist who hates
him from the very start; and Mr. Libido
to satisfy the unfaithful Eleanor. Mix in
a few cheesy, non-romantic evenings and
you have the entire plot.

This is also the extent of the character
development. Holvoe is an excellent at
tractive blonde — I mean receptionist for
the Philadelphia Eagles football team. War
ren has little acting to do, too. Harmon,
on the other hand, just can't act.
Stowe's character is the only one with
any potential, but this is primarily because
Veronica is a classical musician with a
nude mural of herself in her dining hall.
The only refreshing moments in this
movie are during a few brief scenes in
which the women get a chance at revenge.
But even the sweetness of revenge is

spoiled by the typical Hollywood ending.
The director of this soon-to-be flop is
Will Mackenzie, who won awards for his
work on "Family Ties" and "Moonlight
ing." Mackenzie's talents are fine for tele
vision, but they fall short of the demands
of a real motion picture.
Now, there are several indications that
"Worth Winning" is somewhat less than
a masterpiece. First, Harmon is in it. Sec
ond, the previews don't show any scenes
from the movie. This is a classic indication
that there is something wrong with the
movie.
