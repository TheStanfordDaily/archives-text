## Shakes are best in universe 'Peninsula Fountain and Grill' a local tradition 
### Patrick Rollins 
A reviewer once said that this place has the best
milkshakes "in the area." Its owner boasts the best
shakes "in the Western hemisphere." A regular, seeing
the bigger picture, just calls it"the center of the
universe."
The place is the Peninsula Fountain and Grill and
whichever testimonial you are willing to believe, you'll
find it hard to overstate the shakes. They're hand
dipped, lumpy, thick and served in big fountain
glasses. You may find it hard, however, to choose
between seventeen flavors.
As owner Rob Fischer says, "Milkshakes are the
foundation here, so they really have to be great. And
the only way we know how to make them great is
to make them the old-fashioned way."
Fischer defines the Fountain's "old-fashioned way"
using the "mashed potato" theory.
"How do you know that mashed potatoes are real?"
he asks. "Because they have lumps in them. The
same goes for milkshakes. If you get a milkshake
that's all blended up without any lumps, you don't
know where it came from."
"Ours have lumps," he exclaims. "They're real,
they're authentic."
But there's more to the Fountain than just shakes.
It also features traditional breakfast and lunch menus.
And Fischer plans to be open for dinner in the near
future.
The word which best describes the Fountain's sand
wiches is BIG. There are no lumps, but the sheer
size is impressive. There's barely enough bun to
cover the meat. Burgers are sculpted fresh with no
less than one-third pound of never-frozen ground beef.
I had Monday's special — a grilled chicken sand
wich with avocado and bacon. The chicken helping
was about the size of a TV Guide.
Fischer says that aside from the shakes, folks at
the Fountain pride themselves in good food.
He and his sister Laurie assumed ownership of
the Fountain at the beginning of the year, and he

'Ours have lumps. They're
real, they're authentic.'

says profits have doubled. Fischer attributes the in
creased business to a greater emphasis on quality
and effort. His no frills approach involves "no magic,
just hard work," he says.
The restaurant itself isn't frilly either. No neon,
no pink and green paint. That's unique — even
strange — for Palo Alto. It's walls are glass and it
sports original furnishings from the '30s and '40s:
leather-upholstered booths, old Coca-Cola and Pepsi-
Cola signs and an award-winning lunch counter with
18 chrome-fitted stools.
An adjacent dining room is furnished like a patio
with outdoorsy tables and steel chairs wrought with
a heart-shaped design.
Another unique Fountain feature is its clientele,
which, Fischer says, ranges "from multimillionaires
to the destitute." Aside from the regulars, the lunch
crowd consists mainly of people who work in the
downtown area. They're in, they're fed and they're
gone in about a half hour.
It's convenient for students with a 1:15 p.m. class
because it's fast and close to campus. If you don't
have class, you can stay and read the newspapers
provided, study or hang out and talk sports. Lunch
for two costs between $10 and $15.
