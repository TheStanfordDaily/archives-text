# I want to bite your neck
## Despite some high points, 'Dracula' bites 
### Anita Schneider 
Count Dracula is back and
biting in Hamilton Deane and
John Balderston's adaptation of
Bram Stoker's "Dracula," cur
rently playing at the new Centre
Theater in San Jose.
Although the it is the same
version that Bela Lugosi immor
talized on Broadway in the early
'30s, stuntman and movie actor
Nick Scoggin's characterization
of the Count is quite different
from any Dracula we've seen
before. He develops Dracula's
comic sense, and with a plot as
familiar as "Dracula's," that new
twist is refreshing.
Scoggin has a powerful and
magnetic presence, and while his
formidable looks alone could
carry him through the role, he
doesn't rely on them. His excel
lent acting stands for itself.
Sparks fly each time the Count
and Lucy Seward (Claire Nail)
interact. There's more than a
healthy exchange of blood going
on between these two, and their
scenes are mesmerizing.
Nail, who has the difficult role
of showing Lucy's progression
from primness to passion to
madness, makes the best use of
each scene to present another
facet of her character. She's an
exacting actress as well as an
attractive one.
James Kyle is unforgettable as
Renfield, the Count's half-crazed
servant with a voracious appetite
for spiders and flies. He is com
pletely believable and so totally
immersed in his character's
world, one can imagine him
crawling along the floorboards
backstage, still searching for
thousand-leggers to eat even after
his exits.
Though Patricia Kane'# direc
tion is smooth for the first two
acts, she seems to ha?t dj&bttaity
with the final act. ft becomes
evident that she can't decide
whether to present a serious
"Dracula" or a campy one.
It's unfortunate, too, that
Joseph O'Sullivan and Herb

One can imagine him
crawling along the
floorboards back
stage, still searching
for thousand-leggers.

Smith, who play Dr. Seward and
Van Helsing, haven't done more
with their characters.
When the maid (Amanda
Andrus) becomes possessed by

the Count, and Van Helsing tells
us he's had to drive a stake
through her heart (he does this
offstage), he isn't the least bit
shaken by the incident.
In general, the actors need to
put effort into rediscovering die
story of "Dracula" each time it's
told.

"Dracula" runs though Dec. 2,
Fridays and Saturdays at 8:30
p.m., at the La Petit Trianon. 72
N. Fifth Street. It's the premier
production for San Jose's Centre
Theater. For tickets call (408)
