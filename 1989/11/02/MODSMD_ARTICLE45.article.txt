# Stones roll into town
## 
### Mark Pinkus Staff writer 
The time has finally come. The
"Greatest rock band in the world"
will roll into the Oakland
Coliseum after more than an eight
year hiatus. But does it deserve all
this hype?
After being bombarded by aging
rockers throughout the summer
I've learned that many still can
make music after 40. But can the
Rolling Stones?
Many questions surround the
band's two Bay Area performances
this weekend. If reviews are any
indication, however, we ought to
be prepared for a pair of hot shows.
Yet I remain skeptical.
After spending my junior high
and high school years as a die-hard
Stones fan, I started to challenge
my blind obsession. How great can
a band be that hasn't released a
top-notch album in more than a
decade? Not since 1978's "Some
Girls" has the quintet truly flexed
their music muscles.
"Tattoo You" and a highly
profitable world tour wasn't too
bad of a start for the '80s.
But all this extra-long break has
to show for it is two sub-par al
bums — 1986's "Dirty Work," and
1984's "Undercover," along with
the overrated new release "Steel
Wheels."
Somehow, the band has mus
tered more attention than ever. But
who arc these new fans who
bought up two shows worth of tick
ets in four hours — and why are
they in such a frenzy?
The reason the Rolling Stones
have been around for 25 years —
and look like they may be around
for 25 more — is the fascination
that each year's new young fans
have with the Stones reputation
for reckless abandon. But it's not

the '60s anymore, and times have
changed.
If this ludgment seems unfair,
listen to the latest single "A Rock
and a Hard Place." Learn for your
self that "Street Fighting Man" is
just a 21-year-old memory with no
signs of revitahzation.
At 46, Mick Jagger can still com
petently sing classics like "Sym
pathy for the Devil" and
"Satisfaction." But his original edge
is missing.
Keith Richards and Ronnie
Wood, however, arc rumored to be
leading an effective guitar assault,
and Bassist Bill Wyman and drum
mer Charlie Watts are said to be
combining into a near-replica of
their brilliant early rhythms.
If it's their early hits that you
want to see them play, you'll be
happy to hear that sometimes you
can get what you want. Aside from
the two aforementioned classics
will be crowd-pleasers "Honky
Tonk Woman" and "Brown Sugar."
And be ready for such rarely per
formed treats as "Ruby Tuesday"
and "Paint It Black."
Realize that my criticism of the
Stones is not against these classic
songs, all of which were written
in the band's first seven years.
"Beggars Banquet" and "Let It
Bleed," from '68 and '69, respec
tively, remain my two all-time fa
vorite albums. The Stones leave
me wanting more, yet they haven't
had much to offer in the past two
decades.
When all is said and done, no
other band can put together a set
of 28 songs, each of which is con
sidered to be some of the finest
rock 'n' roll ever recorded.
When The Stones hit the stage
around 6 p.m. this weekend with
their usual opener "Start Me Up,"
you can bet that I'll be out of my
seat dancing.
