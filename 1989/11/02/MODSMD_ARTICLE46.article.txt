# Wild' album goes a step too far
## 
### John Louie Staff writer 
Erasure is more of a machine
than a band. Since the release of
their 1986 debut album, "Wonder
land," the British duo has
manufactured albums at an
amazing rate of two per year, each
work consistently strewn with fien
dishly catchy tracks.
Songs like "Who Needs Love
Like That?," "Oh L'Amour,"
"Sometimes," "Victim of Love"
and "A Little Respect," have all
become dance club staples. And
after the commercial success of
their last full album, "The In
nocents," it seemed like Erasure
was becoming the premiere dance
band of the decade. However, with
their new album, "Wild!" Erasure
has taken a curious turn for the
worse.
Instead of capitalizing on their
proven, successful formula,
Erasure discarded its trademark

lively beats and synthesizers for
slower, more orchestral and often
undanceable songs. The band's at
tempt to expand its stylistic
horizons proves the old adage "If
it ain't broke, don't fix it."
And their failed attempt to ex
pand ironically accentuates their
musical limitations.
Like most other dance bands,
Erasure works best when they play
fast. On "Wild!" the faster tracks
are definitely the album's
strengths.
The first single, "Drama!" dis
plays all of the features of a typical
Erasure song. Like "Chains of
Love," "Drama!" begins slowly but
steadily climaxes into a quick,
danceable beat. Andy Bell's syn
thesizers move at a furious pace
around Vince Clarke's vocals,
similar to the style of "Stop!"
When Erasure tries to expand
their horizons, however, they are
obviously out of their league. Two
tracks on "Wild!" highlight the

limits of both extremes of Vmce
Clarke's vocal range. In "How
Many Times," the melody is too
low for Clarke, ruining the song's
attempt at sentimentality and sin
cerity.
However, "La Gloria" is by far
the album's biggest disappoint
ment, when Erasure masquerades
as a manachi band. As expected,
the result is hardly pretty. A chorus
like "La la la la la la la.. . doesn't
help any, either. Even the most
avid Erasure fans have to cringe
at this attempt at expansion.
"Wild!" can be still called a suc
cess of sorts for Erasure.
However, "Wild!" also shows
that Erasure is trapped within the
confines of this genre. If dance
music continues to find appeal in
the future, they will be at the head
of the pack.
But if society's musical tastes
grow, develop or change, Erasure
may just be wiped away.
