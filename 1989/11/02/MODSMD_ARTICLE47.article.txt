# '11' reflects the Smithereens' new blue period
## 
### Tim Marklein Editorial staff 
The Smithereens have gone
through a color change.
Their last album was "Green
Thoughts," which included songs
about green homes and green
towns.
Their new album has no color
in its title, "11," but the color blue
permeates the song titles, lyrics
and mood. In addition to "Blues
Before and After" and "Blue Peri
od," several songs complain about
a sad situation with no people to
see, places to go or things to do.

The theme boils over on "Room
Without A View," when lead singer
Pat DiNizio predictably laments
the following: "In a room without
a view / Lots of time / Nothing to
do / In a room without a view,
without you." Ironically, that's
about the only situation where one
would willingly play the song.
The rest of the album avoids
the mediocrity trap, which every
Smithereens song strangely sounds
one note away from falling into.
But that note is usually there to
keep the track away from the abyss
of lost songs.
Most Smithereens albums are

recognizably similar, since the
band's style is so basic it's distinc
tive. But since "Green Thoughts,"
DiNizio seems to have realized
that his relaxed singing style —
not the basic, straight ahead guitar
work — creates the band's appeal.
The guitar still drives forward, but
DiNizio's voice cuts through the
music more clearly than on previ
ous albums.
More vocal variety than usual,
and an interesting duet with
Belinda Carlisle on "Blue Period,"
combine to make the album the
Smithereens' most pleasing vocal
ly.

"Cut Flowers" puts an interest
ing turn on the over expressed
theme of not appreciating what
you have until its gone: "Cut
flowers pressed between the pages
of a book she gave / I go to her
and say 'I'm sorry' / Then I put
cut flowers on her grave / Cut
flowers sent to a girl with sen
timental ways / Cut flowers meant
more to her on ordinary days."
The Smithereens are definitely
not green anymore, but it will be
interesting to see if they can add
another color to their cap with fu
ture projects. Don't turn blue hold
ing your breath.
