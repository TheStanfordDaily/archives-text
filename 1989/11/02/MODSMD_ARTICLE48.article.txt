# Film tackles drug issue
## 
### Mark Pinkus Staff writer 
Although plenty of movies have
revolved around the drug under
world, it's rare that a drug flick
successfully shows the human side
of substance abuse. "Drugstore
Cowboy" is that rare film.
Director Gus Van Sant Jr. brings
to the screen the sin-to-salvation
story of Bob Hughes (Matt Dillon),
an addict who robs drugstores
throughout the Pacific Northwest.
It reveals very realistically what a
person on drugs goes through when
they're high — and what happens
when they're sober.
"Drugstory Cowboy" is not
preachy. Instead, it gains its
strength by simply telling the story
of Hughes, a small-town hood who
heads up a four-member gang
that's looking to procure
Quaaludes and cocaine from
drugstores.
Yet the harmful nature of drug
addiction becomes increasingly
clear as the story unfolds.
Aside from Van Sant's engaging
direction, the film relies on superb
acting. Former teen heartthrob
Matt Dillon delivers the best per
formance of his career as Hughes.
Dillon demonstrates a challenging
range of experiences when he goes
from hallucinating to leading a
gang to being a remorseful hero.
Dillon brought his character to
life with intensive preparation and
hands-on research. Part of his
study included seeking out James
Fogle at the Washington State

Penitentiary in Walla Walla. Fogle
wrote the original text of
"Drugstore Cowboy" when he was
serving one of his many prison
sentences.
Although the never-published
manuscript was not autobiographi
cal, it was based on events that
happened to a number of people,
and were rolled into a composite
to make Bob Hughes.
Playing opposite Dillon is the
always beautiful Kelly Lynch.
Fresh from her success in "Sea of
Love," Lynch turns in yet another
fabulous performance as Hughes'
wife, Diana.
In the climactic scene where she
refuses to follow her husband's
lead in "going clean," she evokes
great audience sympathy for her
and the addiction that she is un
able to abandon.
While Dillon and Lynch are
clearly the most experienced actors
throughout the film, the most en
gaging might be William Bur
roughs who plays Father Tom, a
junkie priest originally responsible
for introducing Hughes to drugs
when he was still an altar boy.
Author of the '50s cult classic
"Naked Lunch," Burroughs seems
to be playing an autobiographical
character when he rationalizes the
use of narcotics with logic almost
persuasive enough to follow.
Other movies often fail to cap
ture viewer empathy. "Drugstore
Cowboy" stands out, however. It
grabs viewers and leaves them con
templating the issue long after the
final credits roll.
