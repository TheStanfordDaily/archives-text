# More than bearable

The greatest obstacles a film
must overcome are my expec
tations. If my expectations are
high enough, as with the over
blown phenomenon "Batman,"
a good film can be disappoint
ing.
After reading that "The Bear"
was a box office smash in Eu
rope, I expected a top-notch
film. And what I saw when I
viewed it was a film that met
or exceeded all of my expecta
tions.
Nature's beauty and brutality
are present in full force. Set in
British Columbia in 1885, the
film opens with a rock-slide that
kills the mother of a Kodiak
bear cub. The impact of the
mother's death is driven home
as the cub struggles to free her
body, finally curling up against
her in confusion.
The cub then journeys
through the forest seeking a
guardian. At the same time, two
hunters stalk a giant Kodiak,
only managing to wound him.
Staggering off into the forest,
the bear finally collapses and is
joined by the cub. A bond that
lasts the rest of the film is
formed when the cub literally
helps to lick the bear's wounds.
As a result of their first bloody
confrontation, the hunters view
the bear as an enemy that must
be defeated. They bring in hun

ting dogs and make home-made
hollow-point bullets. Yet the
hunters are not without emo
tion. The reaction of the
younger hunter to the death of
his dog illustrates his capacity
for sorrow and compassion.
Unlike the typical Disney
wildlife film, "The Bear" wisely
does not use a narrator or over
bearing music that mimics the
animals' actions. Instead, the
sound design by Laurent
Quaglio brilliantly conveys the
voices and rhythms of the na
ture found in the Canadian
mountains. Philippe Sarde's
musical score is used sparingly,
maximizing its impact.
Adapted from James Oliver
Curwood's novel "The Grizzly
King," the screenplay by Gerard
Brach appropriately contains
fewer than a dozen pages of
dialogue. The performances of
the two Kodiak bears, Bart and
Youk, proves that actions can
speak louder than words.
One of the few possible flaws
in director Jean-Jacques An
nuad's film are the animated
dream sequences of the cub.
They unnecessarily try to
humanize the cub and visually
stick out like a sore thumb in
the naturalistic visual design of
the film.
"The Bear" in many ways is
more for adults than it is for
children, and is one of the out
standing films of this year.
