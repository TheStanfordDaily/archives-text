# 'Family' is a mature comedy

If you missed the sneak preview, of "Immediate
Family" at Cubberley Auditorium last Thursday, you
missed out on three incredible deals — movie posters,
MTV fannie packs filled with Old Spice samples,
and a chance to see this sensitive and humorous
new movie from Columbia Pictures about the issue
of "open adoption."
The film opens with a glimpse into the lives of
Linda and Michael Spector (Glenn Close and James
Woods), a thirty-something couple with a beautiful
house in the Seattle suburbs, established careers,
many friends, a dog and a seemingly unsolvable
problem — they are unable to have children.
The depth and pain of their struggle with fertility
is developed in a series of funny but poignant sketches
that show Linda sighingly pulling tampons out of
her purse and Michael sheepishly preparing to collect
a semen sample with test tube and "Penthouse" in
hand.
When the phone finally rings in response to their
ad looking for a pregnant woman who would like to
have her child adopted, Linda acts so flustered that
she is fcure she sounded like a horrible mother. But
all qualms are put aside when Lucy Moore, played
by Mary Stuart Masterson, appears on their doorstep
from small-town Ohio — 17 years old, unwed and
in her third trimester.
The initial awkwardness Linda and Lucy feel is
quickly replaced with a sense of closeness as the two

women begin to talk about themselves and their lives.
Despite her difficult past, Lucy comes across as a
strong, sensitive and honest woman whose maturity
seems to surpass her age. She has no regrets about
her situation and is committed to giving her baby a
good home.
And in the time they spend together, the Spectors
almost become Lucy's surrogate parents. Moreover,
they cross age and generation barriers to become
friends.
All this sharing could have been melodramatic,
but the emotion is instead disguised as humor.
One of the most amusing episodes is the visit of
Sam, Lucy's boyfriend. You start to cringe with fear
as Ann Taylor meets Harley Davidson, but Sam,
though a little rough around the edges, turns out to
be a friendly, caring guy who is devoted to Lucy and
the welfare of the child. He goofs around like a kid,
but he also realizes that he and Lucy need to wait
and have a child after he has "made it" as a musician,
like he dreams.
"Immediate Family" is touching, witty, and above
all thought-provoking in its exploration of one reso
lution of the abortion/adoption/teen pregnancy issue.
It passes no harsh judgement upon unwed parents,
portraying them instead like adults with options to
consider. It treats adoption as a viable option without
making it a moral imperative. By focusing also on
the infertility problem, the film shows that the two
devastating situations can merge into one responsible
outcome.
