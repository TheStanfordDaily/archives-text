# Pythonesque 'Erik' should leave troupe red with embarrassment
## 
### Brad Bruner 
For Erik the Viking the normal life just
doesn't seem quite fulfilling. Looting and
pillaging have their obvious merits, Erik
believes, but there must be something
more.
As "Eric" opens, our favorite philosophic
viking, played by Tim Robbins, is helping
to sack a village. When he encounters a
lone and defenseless lass, he characteris
tically tries to get to know her before he
begins the compulsory rape-and-pillage
routine.

Of course, the village woman is sur
prised, and questions him about his hesita
tion. But before he can answer, another
viking claims her for himself. Valiant Erik
defends his woman by stabbing the usurp
ing suitor.
Unfortunately Erik's sword pierces
through the man and the woman.
"Thanks for saving me from a fate worse
than death," she gasps in her dying breath.
For all veteran Monty Python fans, this
opening scene seems to be the beginning
of another high-period satire in the "Life

of Brian" and "Monty Python and the
Holy Grail" tradition.
However, as "Erik" unfolds, it becomes
painfully obvious that the Python days are
over.
After this sack, Erik becomes downright
somber. He gets it into his head to end
the Ice Age that has descended on Norway,
and bring the depressing Viking days to
an end. Though "Erik" delivers occasional
chuckles as its namesake trods around
deciding what he must do, the first third
of the film assumes an oddly serious tone
as it takes on the air of a fable.

Erik learns that he must find and blow
"The Horn Resounding" to wake up all
the snoozing sun gods so that he can
make his Viking buddies nice.
He gathers up the guys, and soon they're
off on an aquatic sea quest for the Holy
Horn.
Python fans in the audience are bound
to cheer with relief as John Cleese finally
appears here as Halfdan the Black. Halfdan
doesn't Want all his evil interests to be
muddled by do-gooder Erik, and he quickly
sets off after Erik and the boys.

As "Erik" enters its final third, however,
it again switches to a more idealistic fan
tasy mode that more than smacks of last
year's "The Adventures of Baron Van
Munchausen."
"Erik" holds very little of the ribald
jubilance of the old aays, whether we mean
the old days of Monty Python or the old
days of the somewhat wily Vikings them
selves. Blatant elements of so many other
Python troupe films crop up such that
"Eric" materializes as little more than a
collage of all the other post Python-heyday
films.
