# Athletic scholarships determined by need

Editor's note: This is the second
article in a three-part series on
athletes and academics at Stan
ford.

There's no such thing as a free
lunch — or a free linebacker, for
that matter.
Of the approximately 600 Stan
ford students who compete in in
tercollegiate sports, 323 currently
receive athletic scholarships, ac
cording to Sue LemMon, assistant
to the athletic director.
Two different types of scholar
ships are offered to athletes —
head count and full-ride equiv
alency scholarships.
Head count scholarships allow
a coach to give money to a specific
number of athletes, regardless of
whether the amount is a full or
partial scholarship. For instance,
football offers 95 head-count
scholarships; men's basketball, 15;
and women's basketball, 15.
A full-ride equivalency scholar
ship enables a coach to give one
player a full ride or split up a full
scholarship between athletes so
that two players could receive half
scholarships or many players par
tial scholarships at the coach's dis
cretion.
Recruiting coordinator Keith

Sparks said a total of 120 full-ride
equivalency scholarships are avail
able to Stanford athletes — 60
for men and 60 for women.
In compliance with Title IX of
the Higher Education Act of 1974,
universities are required to offer
an equal amount of money to men

and women athletes in non
revenue-producing sports classi
fied in Division I. Football and
basketball are considered
revenue-producing sports.
Since the baseball team, which
offers 13 scholarships, has no var
sity women's equivalent, many
women's teams receive a higher
number of full-ride equivalency
scholarships than their men's
counterparts. For instance, the
women's tennis team offers eight
scholarships, while the men's only
gives five.
Athletic Director Andy Geiger
said the equivalent of 252 full
scholarships, totaling approxi
mately $5.7 million, was distrib

uted to athletes this year.
Almost half this sum came from
charitable donations to the Buck-
Cardinal Club, a group composed
primarily of Stanford alumni and
athletic supporters, he said.
Another $2 million was derived
from the interest on a $38 million
endowment raised for athletic
scholarships during recent years.
These sources of income are im
portant in maintaining athletic
scholarships since the University
and Financial Aids Office are not
involved in distribution of these
awards.
According to Mary Roberts, as
sistant director for resource
utilization in the Financial Aids
Office, "Stanford's philosophy has
always been to support only stu
dents who show demonstrated
(financial) need."
Since the University does not
offer awards for academic merit,
it would not make sense to offer
them for athletic merit, Roberts
explained.
Instead, the distribution of
scholarships is up to coaches.
Assistant basketball Coach
Doug Oliver said coaches evaluate
players and rank them to deter

mine who is recruited and who is
eventually offered scholarships.
However, the Athletic Depart
ment does not have sufficient
funds for every athlete a coach
wants to recruit. If an athlete
receives no scholarship but dem
onstrates financial need, she or
he can qualify for financial aid
from the University, Roberts said.
Although no Ivy League schools
offer athletic scholarships, Stan
ford does "because we're a private
institution that competes within
the [Pacific 10 Conferencel, and
all Pac-10 schools offer scholar
ships," LemMon said, adding that
Stanford could not remain com
petitive in the conference without
offering scholarships.
Darron Klafter, a sophomore
football player, said if he hadn't
been offered a full scholarship, he
probably would not have come to
Stanford. And while he might
have received financial aid at
Stanford, other schools were of
fering him full rides which would
have made them more attractive,
he said.
But scholarships are not always
the reason athletes choose Stan
ford.
D'Layne Kerr, a sophomore
runner, was offered an athletic
scholarship from several schools
— but not Stanford. Nevertheless,
Kerr forfeited the scholarships-
