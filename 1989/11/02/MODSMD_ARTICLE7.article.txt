Editor's note: This is the second
article in a three-part series on
athletes and academics at Stan
ford.

There's no such thing as a free

Of the approximately 600 Stan
ford students who compete in in

receive athletic scholarships, ac

to the athletic director.
Two different types of scholar
ships are offered to athletes —
head count and full-ride equiv

the Higher Education Act of 1974,
universities are required to offer
an equal amount of money to men

basketball are considered
revenue-producing sports.
Since the baseball team, which
offers 13 scholarships, has no var

women's teams receive a higher
number of full-ride equivalency
scholarships than their men's
counterparts. For instance, the
women's tennis team offers eight
scholarships, while the men's only
gives five.
Athletic Director Andy Geiger
said the equivalent of 252 full
