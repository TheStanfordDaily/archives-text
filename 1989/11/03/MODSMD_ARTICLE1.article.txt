# University denies neglect
## Residents blame Row closings on delayed house repair 
### Liz Lempert Staff writer 
University officials say it was
coincidence that the Oct. 17 earth
quake severely damaged co-op
houses in disproportionate num
bers and deny claims that the
structural failing of the older Row
houses was due to University ne
glect.
Of the four co-ops on the Row,
Columbae, Synergy and Phi Psi
are closed for the year, and some
fear these residences will not be
reopened as co-ops.
"I think the University is kind
of happy that some of the houses
are down so they can use the land
for different things," said Cam
Litsey, resident assistant at Phi
Sig.
The fear that co-ops are seeing
their last days is growing among
some co-op residents on the Row.
In fact, the Stanford Workshops
on Political and Social Issues pro
gram plans to offer a course later
this year on the state of co-ops
and how to rebuild them.
But Housing and facilities offi
cials flatly deny that they want
to phase out co-ops, houses where
residents do their own cleaning
and cooking.
"I used to live in a co-op," said
Lucy Williams, facilities manager
for the Row and Cowell Cluster.
"Personally speaking, co-ops are
dear to my heart. I can't think
of anyone that wants to close
them down."
Williams said Stanford has
spent a great deal of money paint
ing and upgrading the Row facil
ities. "When Synergy was doing
badly in the Draw we spruced it

'Co-ops are dear to
my heart. I can't think
of anyone that wants
to close them down.'

up with an interior paint job," she
said.
But budget constraints limit the
number of expensive projects the
Row Facilities Office can take on.
"We can only paint once a year,"
Williams said, citing dry rot and
soft wood siding as common prob
lems in older houses that lead to
higher painting costs.
The University runs a preven
tive maintenance program for all
40 Row buildings, according to
Williams. "Maintenance doesn't
discriminate between types of
houses," she said.
But houses with University
cleaning service may receive more
thorough maintenance service
simply because the Row Office is
kept better informed of their con
dition.
Rob Norwood, house manager
at Storey, said that the janitorial
staff often puts in maintenance
requests on behalf of the house.
"If University workers aren't
around the house, the Row Facil
ities Office doesn't know about
problems," Norwood said.
Residents often do not report
maintenance problems them
selves, either.
Alan Haynie, former Columbae
resident, said that last year he
noticed that the foundation on the

right side of the house was bent
inward. But he did not notify the
facilities office and did not know
of anyone who did.
"We feared that if we did report
it, they'd close down the house,"
Haynie said. "Our house has
never been in very good shape."
But of those problems that are
reported, special treatment is
given to certain houses, some say.
Litsey, who used to live in 558
Mayfield, said he saw a noticeable
difference between the way the
University responded to the main
tenance needs of self-ops, such as
Phi Sig, and University-operated
houses like 558 Mayfield.
For example, the house mana
ger at Phi Sig placed a request
during the first week of the quar
ter to fix the sliding glass door
in the men's shower. The door
still has not been fixed, and
several residents have slipped on
the wet bathroom floor in the
meantime, Litsey said.
"I don't blame the people who
work in the Row office," Litsey
said. "But the University doesn't
have the structure to maintain
these houses. The University
doesn't care."
He said that with 40 houses
under their jurisdiction, the Row
Facilities Office has too much to
oversee.
Storey resident Natalie
Minenko agreed that maintenance
service on the Row does not match
that of the larger dorms.
"When I lived in Wilbur, when
I turned in requests, things got
fixed a lot faster than in Storey,"
she said.
