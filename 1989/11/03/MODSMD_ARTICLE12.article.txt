WASHINGTON (AP) - The National
Right To Life Committee said Thursday
that television stations have refused to air
commercials it has produced attacking the
Democratic candidate for governor in Vir
ginia.
Spokeswoman Nancy Myers said the ads
were rejected by eight Virginia-area sta
tions, including five that are airing oppos
ing ads produced by the National Abortion
Rights Action League.
The rejected ads attack Virginia Demo
cratic nominee Douglas Wilder, who has
made his opposition to restrictions on abor
tion a central focus of his campaign along
with his contention that Republican oppon
ent Marshall Coleman wants to take away
rights to choose. The,jidkuw4flfi?ti~.

The election is Tuesday.
Ms. Myers contended that the ads were
factual and said officials at the stations
gave "outrageous reasons" for refusing
them. Among the reasons, she said, was

that they objected to the tone of the nar
rator's voice, in one case, and to an asser
tion that Wilder's campaign was based on
the abortion issue.
"These stations are saying that we can't
talk about the issue of abortion unless we
use the other side's terminology and rhet
oric," she said. "That's television censor
ship, and it's outrageous."
A third ad describing Coleman's opposi
tion to abortion has been accepted by
several of the stations, as have general ads
on the abortion issue that do not directly
address the Virginia governor's race, said
executive director David O'Steen.
John Long, executive vice president and
general manager of WJLA in Washington,
statiop rejected the ads
btvuuse tlic |l,tou|> had not provided sub
stantiation "to our satisfaction" for their
assertions.
"There's just an awful lot of inference,
too much inference, in those spots," Long
said.
