Austria asks for compensation
VIENNA, Austria (AP) — Austria said Thurs
day it will ask $300 million in damages from
Hungary, which decided this week to stop work
on a Danube River hydroelectric project.
Economics Minister Wolfgang Schuessel said
the halt was considered a breach of contract by
the state-owned Austrian contractor Donauk
raftwerke, which was doing 70 percent of the
work on the Hungarian part of the $3 billion
joint project with Czechoslovakia.
Austrian state companies contracted to build
much of the Hungarian power complex at
Nagymaros in return for future power supplies.
Stun £un no fun
LONDON (AP) — The inventor of an ultra
sound gun used to stun a racehorse in an alleged
plot to launder drug money through sure bets
testified Thursday he was told it would make
his fortune.
"I had someone tell me that if I had a device
like this, 1 would not have to work again," auto
dealer James Laming told a criminal court. "This

was someone fairly high up in the racing world,
and the gambling game."
He was giving evidence 16 months after the
thoroughbred lie de Chypre veered suddenly
across the track while leading an important Eng
lish race, apparently stunned by an ultrasonic
sound gun disguised as a pair of binoculars.
South Africa executes two
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) — Two
blacks convicted of murder were hanged at
Pretoria Central Prison on Thursday, and anti
apartheid activists launched a solidarity campaign
on behalf of other prisoners on Death Row.
Hanged were Million Hlahla, 44, and Timothy
Lubisi, 28, convicted in 1987 of robbing and
killing a white man enticed into roadside bushes
by two female accomplices.
That raised the number of executions in South
Africa so far this year to 49 — all black or
mixed-race except for two whites.
Anti-apartheid activists told a news conference
a rally will be held Monday to mark the 25th
anniversary of the first hangings of African Na
tional Congress guerrillas.
