## Lebanese leader to be elected 
### 
BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) -
More than 300 police commanded
by Algerian officers will guard a
Parliament meeting to elect a
president under terms of a peace
plan opposed by Christian leader
Gen. Michel Aoun, security
sources said Thursday.
Sources in Moslem west Beirut
said the session scheduled for Sat
urday may be postponed for a few
days to give Christian Parliamen
tarians a last chance to convince
Aoun to back the Arab League
brokered plan.
But the sources, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said the
meeting will take place before
Tuesday, in compliance with the
accord approved by Parliament at
a special session in Taif, Saudi
Arabia, last month.
The accord, aimed at ending a
14-year-old civil war, shifts polit
ical power to the Moslem majority,
revamping a political system
formed in the 1940s when Chris
tians were the majority. Aoun says
the plan lacks a fixed timetable
for the withdrawal of 40,000
Syrian troops backing Moslem
forces.
Aoun, who heads the Christian
Cabinet in Lebanon's dual gov
ernment, has threatened to dis
solve the 99-seat house if it con
vened to elect a speaker, elect a
head of state and ratify the "na
tional reconciliation charter" to

which he is opposed.
No one officially has declared
their candidacy for president, al
though two parliamentarians have
said they would run. They are
Elias Hrawi, from east Lebanon,
and Rene Moawwad, of north
Lebanon, both Maronite Chris
tians.
Aoun has called Christian Par
liamentarians who approved the
accord "traitors." Most Christian
politicians, militia commanders
and spiritual leaders also have
backed the accord.
In his latest statement Thurs
day, he stopped short of repeating
a threat to dissolve Parliament.
But he said: "Continuing with
such constitutional violations and
hypocrisy would force us to take
decisive measures ... to safeguard
the constitution."
He did not specify what he
planned to do.
Lakhdar Ibrahimi, assistant
seceratry-general of the 22-nation
Arab League, told the newspaper
An-Nahar that arrangements
have been completed to secure a
one-mile radius neutral zone
around Villa Mansour, the pro
posed venue of Saturday's debate
in the no man's land of Beirut's
dividing Green Line.
Reached later at the Summer
land Hotel in west Beirut,
Ibrahimi said the area will be
patrolled by the Lebanese police

under the supervision of nine Al
gerian officers who arrived earlier
in the week for that purpose.
Ibrahimi, an Algerian, would
not give other details.
A police spokesman, who cannot
be identified in 'line with regula
tions, said the Lebanese force will
comprise 300 men and be deployed
on Friday evening "if no postpone
ment of the session is announced."
"The whole police force in
Beirut will be on alert to provide
back-up, if needed," he added.
The peace plan emerged after
23 days of wrangling on political
reforms sought by Moslems, and
the Christians' demand for a fixed
timetable for a Syrian troop with
drawal from Lebanon.
The Moslems obtained some
concessions: mainly an increase
of Parliament seats to 108 divided
equally between Christians and
Moslems, and a cutback in the
powers of the Christian president
to give the Parliament speaker
and prime minister, traditionally
Moslems, a wider share in the
decision-making process.
Under an unwritten covenant
dating from independence from
the French in 1943, the president
is a Maronite, the prime minister
a Sunni and the Parliament
Speaker a Shiite.
The Syrians maintain its troops
in Lebanon under a 1976 Arab
League peacekeeping mandate.
