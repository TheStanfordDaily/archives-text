trafficking cases.

States to face drug trafficking
charges.

federal judges, a congressman, a
governor, a state leader of the

news media employees. Two
newspapers have been bombed.

The traffickers are trying to
force the government to reverse
its decision to extradite suspected
Colombian drug traffickers to the
United States. Five suspected
traffickers have been extradited
so far.

Court Workers, which includes
5,000 judges and and 12,000 other
court workers, declared a strike
of two hours Thursday, four hours
