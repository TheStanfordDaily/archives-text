Things are looking up at
the Stanford post office.
After years of stacking up
frustratingly long lines at the most
inopportune times, the post office,
working with the Council of Presi
dents, is finally doing something
to increase its efficiency.
First off, a new clerk has been
hired at the Stanford branch. The
clerk spent this week in training
and will begin work Monday. With
the new clerk's arrival comes the
opening of another window to han
dle yellow slips, passports, meters
and other inquiries.
In addition, postal officials plan
to place three or four stamp ven
ding machines at various places
around campus. Once installed, the
machines will cut down on traffic

at the post office and provide an
alternative when the machines at
the office are empty.
The COP, meanwhile, may buy
a postage meter so students can
mail packages from the ASSU of
fice. COP members are even
looking into the possibility of cre
ating a service to pick up and dis
tribute students' packages — an
idea that, if approved by the
postmaster, might eliminate the
need to skip a 1:15 p.m. class to
claim one's packages.
Students have been complaining
about service at the post office for
years. Hopefully, the planned
changes will ease the hassles asso
ciated with a service that affects
all our daily lives.
