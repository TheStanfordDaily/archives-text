# Row houses were first uprooted in early '70s

Columbae House may have
walked off its foundation during
the Oct. 17 earthquake, but it
wasn't the first time.
In the summer of 1973, Uni
versity construction workers split
Columbae in two and transported
the pieces down the Row.
Columbae used to sit where
Campus Drive now intersects
Mayfield Avenue. The house was
transplanted to make room for an

extension of Campus Drive. In
fact, the early '70s saw many
houses on the move as the Uni
versity cleared space for new con
struction projects.
Assoc. Dean of Student Affairs
Norm Robinson, who witnessed
the Row reshuffling, said it was
less expensive for the University
to transport the houses than to
demolish and rebuild them.
In addition to Columbae, 553
Mayfield and Slavianskii Dom
were also carried on the backs of
trucks to new locations.

553 Mayfield, formerly the
Delta Upsilon fraternity, used to
be located on a site adjacent to
the lot now occupied by the Law
School.
During the Law School's con
struction, 553 Mayfield was trans
ported to its present location
between Columbae and the Beta
Theta Pi fraternity.
Slavianskii Dom, formerly
Hurlburt House, was relocated in
the summer of 1974 to make room
for the controversial Pearce
Mitchell apartment complex.
