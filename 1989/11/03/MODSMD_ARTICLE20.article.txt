SACRAMENTO, a government
center often ignored by sum
mer internship seekers, is
about to get the attention it
deserves.
Stanford in Government's pro
gram in Sacramento is slated to
expand multi-fold this year with
the creation of summer fellowships
expressly for Stanford students.
It is a plan whose time has come.
In the£»"sast,Mstanford students
wanting public service internships
in the state capital had to make
arrangements individually, and
there were no guarantees of
reserved positions.
Further, students often passed
over Sacramento for more
glamorous, exciting, political places
— like Washington, D.C. While po
sitions in the nation's capital may
arguably be more prestigious,
state-level jobs offer students more
direct involvement in the political
process.
SIG directors have met with rep
resentatives of at least 20 state

agencies, and several have
responded that they intend to set
aside fellowships for Stanford stu
dents in the summer of 1990. The
fellowships will give Stanford a
more permanent, visible presence
in a city where some of the deci
sions that most directly affect our
lives are made.
If there is any hitch in the pro
gram, it may have to do with
money.'SlG is working to increase
its stipend allowance for student
interns to $1,500 for the summer.
The group is also pursuing low-cost
housing options in Sacramento to
ease the financial strain on partic
ipants in the program.
But $1,500 still is not much for
students on financial aid who need
to earn significant amounts of
money during the summer. Now
might be a good time for SIG to
draw on its alumni contacts to
build up the stipend fund and en
sure that students of all financial
backgrounds will be able to partic
ipate.
