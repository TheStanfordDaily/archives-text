Food Service should try systems from other schools

THIS IS a comment on Malinda
McCollum's column, "The
downer: Food Service" (Nov. 1).
I do not intend to defend Food Serv
ice for their pricing schemes, but,
having worked at Dining Service for
the University of Southern California,
I understand the missed meal factor
used in the meal plans.
This factor is used to keep the costs
of the plans down, as it is statistically
proven that students miss a certain
percentage of their meals.
If all students ate all the meals
available to them under their meal
plan, Food Service would either lose
money, or would have to raise the cost

of these plans. That is also the reason
why the meals are lost at the end of
the week and cannot be carried over
for future use.
It is also true that there are other
options such as the point system used
at Sterling Hall. The point system not
only allows the students greater
flexibility, but is also preferred by the
students when they are given a choice
between point plans and meal plans.
Other schools have converted their
meal plans with the built-in missed
meal factor into point plans and meal
plans.
There are ways of doing this thereby
extending the student's choices of

dining facilities while still preserving a
form of the missed meal factor. I will
not discuss the justice or injustice of
such systems here, but only wish to
state that they are popular and have
been implemented at other universities.
At USC, for example, all dining
facilities are open to all students re
gardless of whether they have a meal
plan or a point plan. Certain time and
dollar amount restrictions apply to
those on the meal plan. Other regula
tions apply to some of the point plans.
I know that Food Service considers
that this would be an accounting
nightmare, but that is what computers
are for. As Assistant Manager of the

Dining Card Office at USC, I handled
the main part of this accounting with
out any major problems.
Anyone interested in exploring the
possibilities — USC uses the school
photo ID as a meal card (magnetic
strip), library card (computerized with
a bar code) and now as a debit card
that can even be used at the bookstore
— should contact Gene Lawless, the
Executive Director of Dining Services
and the Bookstore at USC.
By the way, these photo IDs are
generated in less than five minutes
with the help of a computer.
