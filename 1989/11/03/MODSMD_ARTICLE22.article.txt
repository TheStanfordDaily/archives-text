# Sierra Club calls on student support to help environment
## 
### 
Although I'm no fan of The Daily, I
must commend them on the cover
article on the oak tree reforestation
project (Nov. 1).
This coverage of Magic's efforts to
reverse the devastation in the Foothills
caused by ignorant and short-sighted
development and grazing practices gives
this group the attention it deserves.
However, the article did not mention
the continuing severity of destructive
cattle grazing in California. Presently,
the California cattle grazers are at
tempting to open up Mount Diablo
State Park to commercial grazing.
Conservationist groups, such as the
Sierra Club, have so far been success
ful in prohibiting this activity, but the
fight is not over. On Nov. 9 there will
be a public comment session in Con
cord at which the California Parks and
Conservation Association will hear
testimony from both sides. The Stan-

ford Sierra Club will be present — and
heard.
I urge people to attend. Anyone who
goes up into the Foothills can easily
see the scars left by commercial ex
ploitation. The same fate awaits other
public land in the state unless we con
servationists can stop them on Nov. 9.
Even if you cannot attend, please sign
a petition at the SEAS/Sierra Club
table in White Plaza.
News on student protests and ASSU
expenditures come and go, but prob
lems affecting the environment we live

in stay with us for a long time. Please
keep aware of the threats facing our
natural home.
