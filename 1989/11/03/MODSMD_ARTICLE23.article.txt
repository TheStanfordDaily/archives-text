# Cartoon displays poor taste and is not humorous
## 
### 
I am writing in response to The
Daily's inclusion of the comic strip
"Strip Search."
This patently offensive cartoon in
sults the intelligence of the entire Stan
ford campus by insisting in Oct. 31's
opus of insightful commentary that
"snot" and hurled urine are somehow
funny.
Previously the cartoon tried the pa
tience of self-respecting human beings
everywhere by having the cleverly
named "Evil Squirrel" "bust a nut"
upon a "hoe."
The humor involved here within this
complicated network of puns and

wordplay seemingly centers around a
desire to see exactly how far into the
mire of bad taste the cartoon can
plunge.
Using irreverence and risque humor
in order to shed light upon relevant
issues in our society is one thing. But
merely using bad taste for the sake of
bad taste is juvenile and does not live
up to the high standards we've come
to expect from The Daily.
