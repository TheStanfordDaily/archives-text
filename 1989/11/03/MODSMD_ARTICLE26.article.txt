## Heinous crimes prevail 
### 
WHEN I BECAME a columnist
last month, I did not want to
use this as a forum for my per
sonal gripes. Nothing bores a reader more
than a writer complaining about how
tough life has been for the last week.
Everyone has it rough at one time or
another. Why would you waste your time
reading about how bad my life is?
Well, sometimes, someone does have a
rougher week than the rest of us. Last
week, someone stole a wheelchair from
Allison May, a friend of mine, who lives
in Stern Hall. I am not so naive as to
believe that crime does not exist at Stan
ford, but I expected more from Stanford
students.
I have always believed that Stanford's
finest resource is its student body. That's
hardly a novel idea, but I really do believe
that. Unfortunately, there is a jerk out
there somewhere, with Allison's wheel
chair. I'm just not sure who he or she is.
Now, you may ask, "How does he know
a Stanford student took it?" I don't, but
I do know that it was stolen sometime
in the early morning hours, that the
dorms are normally locked at that time
and that the only people who thus can
enter the dorm at that time are residents
and friends of residents. Even if it wasn't
a Stanford student, does it make much
of a difference?
So let's assume a Stanford student stole
it. Nearly everyone on campus realizes
that those carts are not toys; those who
don't probably have the decency not to
take someone else's property. Those carts
are the only means of transportation that

their owners have. As my friend Tim
says, "You might as well take away my
legs."
Allison and I lived in the same fresh
man dorm two years ago. She has cerebral
palsy, which affects her legs to such a
degree that it is virtually impossible for
her to walk very far.
As "the girl in the cart," she quickly
became known to the rest of the dorm,
and few people, to my knowledge, were
ever visibly uncomfortable with her dis
ability. Everyone gave her a hand if she
needed one, or helped her up the stairs
if she wanted to visit someone (makes
you wonder about what you take for
granted, doesn't it?).
Her cart disappeared one day that year,
and a small army of Rinconadans foraged
around Wilbur Hall before it appeared
about six hours later. Allison was
catatonic, as you might be if someone
stole your legs. Last week, however, she
was as calm as a summer breeze. She
just seemed weary.
I realize crime occurs here. Despite
criticism to the contrary, Stanford re
mains inextricably linked to the real
world.
The recent rape attempt in the Foot
hills and the bizarre flashing incident in
the hospital garage this week prove noth
ing if not that you can't be too careful,
even in the Disneyland of the North. It
won't make you truly angry, though, until
it touches you or a friend.
It doesn't make this incident any easier
to swallow. There is absolutely no viable
excuse for thi3 one. Why would anyone

steal a wheelchair, except to be a jerk?
Someone wants to take a joyride, so they
steal a wheelchair. Brilliant.
This is not some laughable prank. Ac
tually, I'd like to hear the excuse, if the
idiot ever decides to emerge from his
cowardice. How did he know that Allison
didn't have a mid-term the next day (as
it turns out, she did)? How did he know
that she didn't have to make an early
morning doctor's payment? I hope he had
a hell of a joyride.
If it wasn't some prank — and as the
days go by without any sight of the cart,
it appears less likely that it was — and
the person stole it simply because they
wanted one, then I'm even more aston
ished.
Does someone actually believe he is so
special that he can indulge any whim
with complete disregard for another's es
sential needs? Stanford students are
usually of a higher quality than that, but
apparently, the Admissions Office made
a mistake.
So, if the bastard who stole the cart
actually reads this, I hope you crawl out
from under your rock long enough to
show some guts and return the cart.
