Management at
Tresidder treats
workers unfairly

I am writing in response to the arti
cle "USW protests cut of Tresidder
jobs" (Nov. 1).
I am the person Tresidder Associate
Director Paul Szczesiul referred to
whose job was cut in half in the sched
uling office at Tresidder. I was given
the choice of half of a job or none.
As for the other two non-custodial
positions that, according to Szczesiul,
were cut, we were given a different
explanation. The position of program
coordinator was eliminated because the
person who previously filled it left. The
marketing coordinator's position was
cut by 40 percent, we were told, be
cause that employee had a child and

Working at Tresidder, I have been continually harassed,
run into double standards everywhere — one policy for
management, a whole separate policy for workers —
and I am expected to do my full-time job with my hours
cut in half, which is impossible.

was willing to work part time.
Concerning Szczesiul's claim that he
does not remember Tresidder manage
ment having parties at work time
(while threatening custodians who sit
down during work with docking their
pay), not only have I scheduled most
of them, but I have attended at least
10 such parties and Szczesiul was at
each one that I attended. How he can
not be aware of them is beyond my
comprehension.
Tresidder is a student union, a
service-oriented operation that is sup-

posed to care about people. At least
when I was in college my student un
ion cared about its employees as well
as its students. When I accepted my
job at Tresidder, I was led to believe it
operated in a similar manner.
However, I have been continually
harassed, run into double standards
everywhere — one policy for manage
ment, a whole separate policy for
workers — and I am expected to do
my full-time job with my hours cut in
half, which is impossible. When I can
not complete my work, I am punished.

It is ironic that Tresidder's manage
ment emphasizes individuality and
caring and, yet, I have known no one
more cold-hearted and machine-like.

Amnesty thanks
all who contributed
to benefit dance
We would like to thank a whole lot
of folks for helping to make the 1989
Dance for Amnesty benefit possible. We
collected about $300 to send to Am
nesty International*B Ivan Morris fund,
which will directly aid prisoners of
conscience and their families.
Cerebral Paisley, the Ice Weasels,
Gangajang and Marci and the Moon-

gods all came out for free on a night
when they could have been pulling in
money instead.
We thank all those who hetoed put
the technical ends together, the Am
nesty staffers and the many campus
houses and individuals who supported
the concert financially. It was a lot of
work, but well worth it.
We apologize to those area residents
who found us to be a bit too noisy,
and to the Police Department for
having to shut us down a bit earlier
than we expected to end. Next year
we'll choose a better location.
Lastly, thanks to everyone who came
to the concert and made it work. They
demonstrated that Stanford can indeed
have a great party for a great cause.
