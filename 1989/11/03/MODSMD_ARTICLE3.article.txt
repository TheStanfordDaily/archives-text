# Psychological trauma still felt in aftermath of quake
##

Except for some remaining yellow con
struction tape around closed Quad build
ings and a few empty Row houses, traces
of the 7.1-magnitude earthquake seem
to have disappeared from campus only
two weeks later.
The appearance of "business as usual"
is misleading, however, as members of
the community continue to experience
psychological effects from the quake.
Symptoms of earthquake-related
trauma include anxiety, fatigue, concen
tration problems and sleep disturbance.
Throughout the past two weeks, the
Bridge counseling center has been helping
students deal with increased tensions
caused by the quake. Sophomore Karen
Kramer, a staffer and former live-in at
the Bridge, said the peer counseling cen

ter "definitely had a few calls" concerning
the earthquake.
"The main kind of calls we get are
related to stress and pressure, and the
earthquake has definitely been a factor,"
Kramer said.
Dr. Marshall Blatt, an intern in the
Stanford Psychiatric Residence Program
at Stanford Hospital, is planning to form
a support group for people who feel psyc
hologically traumatized by the earth
quake.
Blatt got the idea for the group while
volunteering on a phone line for the
Northern California Psychiatric Society.
"It seemed like a lot of people in the
South Bay were having trouble sleeping
and were having problems with their ap
petites and nervousness," he said.
Although he has only received two
phone calls about the group, Blatt said
he thinks "there really is a lot of psy

1 had a dream last night
that we had another earth
quake that was even
worse. It turned the room
upside down.'

chological aftermath of the earthquake."
He said he hopes there will be more
interest in the group once more people
know about it.
"The support group will exist if people
want it to exist," he said.
Dr. Alejandro Martinez, director of
Counseling and Psychological Services,
said that he also has noticed effects of
the earthquake in people's behavior.

"A certain irritability has been there,
especially evident in the first week and
a half," Martinez said. "It's not so much
that people have come to talk about it,
but I've noticed it in them."
"There was also increased alertness
and panic caused by noticeable after
shocks. Many students became more up
set by the aftershocks than by the earth
quake itself," he said.
"It was hard to sleep for about a week,"
said senior Pat Sekaquaptewa. "Every
time I thought it was over, there was
another aftershock."
Another common reaction to the earth
quake has been uncertainty. Some stu
dents have considered leaving the area.
Others are questioning their general di
rection in life, Martinez said.
"Some people have realized that their
lives are not so secure, and they are
beginning to question their decisions and

direction," he added.
Martinez estimated that psychological
effects would lessen for most people as
time goes by. However, some will not be
as fortunate.
"For people who have lost their resi
dences, were up in high towers (when
the quake occurred) or have been
traumatized in other ways, recovery will
take longer," he said.
Freshman Cedar Carlton said that she
was not affected psychologically by the
quake.
"But I had a dream last night that we
had another earthquake that was even
worse. It turned the room upside down.
It wasn't really a bad dream, though,"
she said.
According to Martinez, "Many people
respond to questions about the earth-
quake by saying that they are
doing fine, but they may not be
connecting certain feelings with
the earthquake."
Senior Rick Bush said he had
not been affected personally, but
that his family had. His sister,
who attends UC-Santa Cruz, has
been spending weekends at their
father's home because she is
afraid to sleep in her residence at
school. His brother, a Stanford
junior, has been displaced from
housing and has decided to stop
out for the rest of the quarter.
Although people will deal with
the earthquake in a variety of
ways, Martinez stressed the im

portance to talk about it.
"Putting things away can be
healthy when we have to deal with
a trauma that we can't do any
thing about, but difficulties can
arise if people try to ignore their
feelings. People ought to review
their reactions to the earth
quake," Martinez said.
To deal with this need, CAPS
has organized teams of counselors
who will go to residences to talk
with students and help them
"process feelings that have not
yet been resolved," Martinez said.
"At the time [the earthquake]
happened, it didn't seem momen
tous to me. Not until I saw the
news did I realize the magnitude.
I'm still having a problem con
necting that a great tragedy has
happened so close to my life," said
freshman Ann Chan.
