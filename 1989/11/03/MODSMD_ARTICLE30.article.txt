## Stanford alumnus holds reins at Time 
### Frank Quaratiello Editorial staff 
When Time magazine's manag
ing editor first heard about the
big quake that rocked the Bay
area two weeks ago, his reaction
went beyond the normal rush that
media barons get when a big news
event breaks.
"In this business, your
adrenaline starts to run when a
major news event happens,"
Henry Muller explained.
But Muller, who graduated
from Stanford in 1968 with a
bachelor's degree in history, said
news of the temblor really hit
home.
"It's very easy to become callous
in this business," said Muller, who
was having dinner with friends in
New York when he heard about
the quake. "When I first heard
about the quake, I felt that news
instinct, but it was coupled with
a different reaction. I have friends
in California and I wanted to
know what happened to them."
Muller has worked for Time
Inc. (now, Time-Warner, Inc.) for
19 years.
While at Stanford, he worked
for The Daily and served as editor
in chief during the second half of
his junior year.
"My best memories from Stan
ford are memories of The Daily,"
Muller said. "For a student of
journalism, it was a very inter
esting time to work at The Daily
because campus activism in re
sponse to the Vietnam War was
on the rise.
"While I was editor of The Dai
ly, the paper was deeply involved
in campus activism," Muller
added. "We took strong stands and
drew a lot of fire for them.
"I did more growing up in my
five months as Daily editor in
chief than I've done in any five
month period in my life," Muller
said. "I've faced a lot of challenges
at Time, but when I was at The
Daily, those were formative years.
That's when I really became a
grown-up."
During the summer between his
junior and senior years, he went

to New York and worked as an
intern for Life magazine, part of
the Time Inc. magazine family.
"I enjoyed working at The Daily
and I had been editor of my high
school newspaper, but that sum
mer at Life really got me hooked
on journalism," Muller said.
During his senior year at Stan
ford, Muller worked on campus
related stories for Time
magazine's San Francisco bureau.
But, when he graduated, Muller
did not beat a path straight to
Time's door. Instead, he decided
to join the Peace Corps.
"It was a combination of '60s
idealism, curiosity about the
world and, quite honestly, concern
about being drafted to go fight in
the Vietnam War," Muller said.
"Concern about the war was a
motivating factor, though it cer
tainly was not the main one.
"In the Peace Corps, I worked
as a schoolteacher in Ethiopia for
two years," Muller added. "I
taught English, math and history

at the junior high level."
When he returned to the United
States, Muller headed for New
York and Time magazine.
Like many Time Inc. employ
ees, Muller has spent most of his
journalistic career working for the
company.
First, he worked for a year as
editor of Time magazine's small
in-house publication "FYI." Then,
he was hired as a correspondent
and sent to Time's Ottawa bureau.
After six months, he was moved
farther west, where he served
Time's Vancouver bureau chief.
After a two-year stint in Van
couver, Muller worked for four
and a half years in Brussels, Bel
gium, as Time's European eco
nomic correspondent. Then, he
served for four years as the mag
azine's Paris bureau chief.
Finally, in the summer of 1981,
Muller was brought back to New
York. He wrote for Time's World
section for a year and then served
as editor of the World section. In

1986, he became Time's chief of
correspondents, in charge of over
seeing hundreds of correspon
dents and stringers around the
world and making sure that when
news happens, Time is there.
Then, in May 1987, Muller be
came managing editor of a mag
azine that has gained a reputation
as the number one weekly news
magazine in the world.
"It's amazing to me how many
people read Time," Muller ex
plained. "The decisions I make
about the magazine have quite an
impact on how people learn about
news and world events and what
people think.
"The most wonderful thing
about this profession is that it is
a continual education. Every day
you wake up to a new day and
there are new events and issues,"
Muller explained. "I haven't spent
a day in 19 years that was boring,
honestly."
But the high stress level of the
job can take its toll.
"As a hobby, I try to get out of
New York whenever I can," Muller
said. "I live in Manhattan but,
when I have time, I like to go to
mountains — usually in Switzer
land or California where I grew
up and have roots and favorite
places to go. In the winter, I like
to ski. In the summer, I like to
go mountain climbing."
Muller's love for nature came
across when he described what he
thought his most significant ac
complishment at Time had been.
"At the beginning of last year,
when we did the cover story on
the planet Earth, that was the
best of many good moments,"
Muller said. "It was the first anal
ysis of environmental problems to
be done in such a comprehensive
way I think it helped shape and
expand dialogue in this country
about environmental problems,
and that's pretty damn important.
"That was important," Muller
added. "But we do little things
each week that help people learn
and help them think. Some stories
work and some don't, but we keep
trying."

mer at Life really got me hooked
on journalism," Muller said.
During his senior year at Stan
ford, Muller worked on campus
related stories for Time
magazine's San Francisco bureau.
But, when he graduated, Muller
did not beat a path straight to
Time's door. Instead, he decided
to join the Peace Corps.
"It was a combination of '60s
idealism, curiosity about the
world and, quite honestly, concern
about being drafted to go fight in
the Vietnam War," Muller said.
"Concern about the war was a
motivating factor, though it cer
tainly was not the main one.
"In the Peace Corps, I worked
as a schoolteacher in Ethiopia for
two years," Muller added. "I
taught English, math and history

at the junior high level."
When he returned to the United
States, Muller headed for New
York and Time magazine.
Like many Time Inc. employ
ees, Muller has spent most of his
journalistic career working for the
company.
First, he worked for a year as
editor of Time magazine's small
in-house publication "FYI." Then,
he was hired as a correspondent
and sent to Time's Ottawa bureau.
After six months, he was moved
farther west, where he served
Time's Vancouver bureau chief.
After a two-year stint in Van
couver, Muller worked for four
and a half years in Brussels, Bel
gium, as Time's European eco
nomic correspondent. Then, he
served for four years as the mag
azine's Paris bureau chief.
Finally, in the summer of 1981,
Muller was brought back to New
York. He wrote for Time's World
section for a year and then served
as editor of the World section. In

1986, he became Time's chief of
correspondents, in charge of over
seeing hundreds of correspon
dents and stringers around the
world and making sure that when
news happens, Time is there.
Then, in May 1987, Muller be
came managing editor of a mag
azine that has gained a reputation
as the number one weekly news
magazine in the world.
"It's amazing to me how many
people read Time," Muller ex
plained. "The decisions I make
about the magazine have quite an
impact on how people learn about
news and world events and what
people think.
"The most wonderful thing
about this profession is that it is
a continual education. Every day
you wake up to a new day and
there are new events and issues,"
Muller explained. "I haven't spent
a day in 19 years that was boring,
honestly."
But the high stress level of the
job can take its toll.
"As a hobby, I try to get out of
New York whenever I can," Muller
said. "I live in Manhattan but,
when I have time, I like to go to
mountains — usually in Switzer
land or California where I grew
up and have roots and favorite
places to go. In the winter, I like
to ski. In the summer, I like to
go mountain climbing."
Muller's love for nature came
across when he described what he
thought his most significant ac
complishment at Time had been.
"At the beginning of last year,
when we did the cover story on
the planet Earth, that was the
best of many good moments,"
Muller said. "It was the first anal
ysis of environmental problems to
be done in such a comprehensive
way I think it helped shape and
expand dialogue in this country
about environmental problems,
and that's pretty damn important.
"That was important," Muller
added. "But we do little things
each week that help people learn
and help them think. Some stories
work and some don't, but we keep
trying."

When Time magazine's manag
ing editor first heard about the
big quake that rocked the Bay
area two weeks ago, his reaction
went beyond the normal rush that
media barons get when a big news
event breaks.
"In this business, your
adrenaline starts to run when a
major news event happens,"
Henry Muller explained.
But Muller, who graduated
from Stanford in 1968 with a
bachelor's degree in history, said
news of the temblor really hit
home.
"It's very easy to become callous
in this business," said Muller, who
was having dinner with friends in
New York when he heard about
the quake. "When I first heard
about the quake, I felt that news
instinct, but it was coupled with
a different reaction. I have friends
in California and I wanted to
know what happened to them."
Muller has worked for Time
Inc. (now, Time-Warner, Inc.) for
19 years.
While at Stanford, he worked
for The Daily and served as editor
in chief during the second half of
his junior year.
"My best memories from Stan
ford are memories of The Daily,"
Muller said. "For a student of
journalism, it was a very inter
esting time to work at The Daily
because campus activism in re
sponse to the Vietnam War was
on the rise.
"While I was editor of The Dai
ly, the paper was deeply involved
in campus activism," Muller
added. "We took strong stands and
drew a lot of fire for them.
"I did more growing up in my
five months as Daily editor in
chief than I've done in any five
month period in my life," Muller
said. "I've faced a lot of challenges
at Time, but when I was at The
Daily, those were formative years.
That's when I really became a
grown-up."
During the summer between his
junior and senior years, he went

to New York and worked as an
intern for Life magazine, part of
the Time Inc. magazine family.
"I enjoyed working at The Daily
and I had been editor of my high
school newspaper, but that sum
mer at Life really got me hooked
on journalism," Muller said.
