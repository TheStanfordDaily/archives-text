# Students top beets

November 3, 1942
The Stanford Daily
In a display of wartime pa
triotism, Stanford residents
took to local beet farms for a
two-week period to help the
war effort.
The teams, composed of 10
members of each of Stanford's
residences, worked two four
hour shifts "topping" beets
after a labor dispute led to a
walkout of farm workers which
threatened the beet crop. The
teams competed to see who
could top the most beets, but
no mention was made of what
the winning team received.
Harry Mahoney, gym in
structor, excused students par
ticipating in the work from his
afternoon classes, because, he
said, "Beet-topping work is a
constructive factor in the cur
rent physical fitness program."
Rosemary Cross, chair of the
Stanford War Board, stressed
that beet topping is "too
strenuous for women," but that
they were still needed for the
walnut harvesting program.
Somehow that just wouldn't
be the same as beet topping,
though. Where was Gloria
Steinem when we needed her?

A crowd that assembled to
watch a Stanford student jump
out of a plane above the Oval
watched in horror as the stu
dent's parachute failed to open.
The students later learned that
what they had actually seen
was a dummy pushed out of
the plane, with sheets tied to
it resembling an unopened
parachute.
The demonstration was ap
parently a campaign stunt to

gain support for a write-in can
didate for the position of yell
leader in the upcoming student
elections. This candidate later
lost in a run-off election.
No one speculated on
whether he would have won if
his friend actually had plunged
to his death campaigning for
him, although it would seem
to appeal to the sympathy vote.

A committee of the program
"Study of Education at Stan
ford" recommended that Stan
ford end its policy of admitting
twice as many men as women
because the policy "dis
criminates against women."
The University cited con
straints in financial aid and on
campus housing as the
motivating factor behind the
disparate admissions quotas
between the sexes. Stanford
required all women under the
age of 23 to live on campus,
with the exception of 60 senior
wofoen participating in a pilot
program testing the feasibility
of Stanford women living off
campus.
No mention was made of
whether Stanford women
would now be allowed to pick
beets off campus.
