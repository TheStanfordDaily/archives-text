# Students share education with East Palo Alto youths

"Teach your children well ...
And feed them on your dreams"
Since 1986, Stanford students have
been going to elementary and middle
schools in the East Palo Alto Ravenswood
school district to teach the children, as
part of the Ravenswood-Stanford Tutor
ing Program.
The program, which has over 120
tutors and seven tutor coordinators,
matches a Stanford volunteer with an
East Palo Alto child, then requires the
students to tutor twice a week for at
least two quarters.
The need for such a program is simple.
According to the program's interim di
rector Dee Dee Terzian, the Ravenswood
district middle and elementary schools
scored near the bottom in last year's
California Assessment Program, as they
have in past years.
With a reading list of books this year
such as "The Phantom Tollbooth" and
"Charlotte's Web," Terzian feels these
scores can be improved. According to her,
"The curriculum can be a measure of
success. ... if nothing else, the child can
say he read three books."
Terzian said last year students were

'In my values system, edu
cation Is a top priority. If
you don't have a strong
educational foundation,
you can't get far.'

required to tutor only once a week, and
they "would just help the [child] with
whatever the teacher thought they
needed."
This year students will concentrate on
reading skills, and the program has de
veloped a literature-based curriculum for
tutors to follow.
"The reasons for change were numer
ous," said Magdalena Fittoria, public re
lations coordinator for the Ravenswood
school district and director of the tutoring
program until next August. "It was clear
that the tutors were perplexed about
what to do. .. . Tutors weren't there
enough [and] some children who were
referred to the program would never show
up."

Fittoria said she met during the sum
mer with some of the student tutor co
ordinators. The group evaluated the pro
gram and brainstormed new approaches
by themselves. "No one was brought in
from the outside," Fittoria noted, adding
that people from the district did attend
some of the planning meetings.
Fittoria said the group decided to con
centrate on helping the kids with reading
skills, rather than trying to help in all
areas. In addition, the tutors are now
required to meet with their charges twice
a week after school for an hour. The
children should want to be there, she
noted, instead of being referred.
The Stanford students who participate
in the program should also "want to be
there," and most of them confirm that
tutoring children gives them a sense of
satisfaction.
Sophomore Erron Al-Amin, for exam
ple, is a tutor coordinator for McNair
Intermediate School and tutored a second
grader named Kyrique last year.
Kyrique, according to Al-Amin, "didn't
know basic subtraction, so I decided he
should memorize basic things like 10 mi
nus 3 equals 7, or 4 minus 1 equals 3.
One day, I made a giant number line,
and he would subtract by jumping down

the line."
Al-Amin also helped her child learn
other subjects. "I would go over spelling
tests with him, or we would go outside
and I would point to different things and
he had to tell me what letter the object
started with," she recalled.
"It was an exceptionally rewarding ex
perience," said Al-Amin, who loved it so
much she decided to become a tutoring
coordinator this year at the school right
next to Kyrique's.
Eugene Chen, a freshman, said he
decided to tutor "to help those who don't
have the educational opportunities I
did. ... In my values system, education
is a top priority. If you don't have a
strong educational foundation, you can't
get far."
"The kids we tutor are in the 40th
percentile in reading," added Jeffrey Lox,
a freshman tutor. One of the reasons he
is tutoring, he said, is that, "I want them
to have an above average reading level
when we're done."
While it is difficult to quantitatively
judge the program's effect on East Palo
Alto schools, over the last two years 75
percent of the tutors and children said
they have seen improvement in the
children's academic performances, accord

ing to Frittoria.
"The district is totally appreciative of
[the program]," she said. The East Palo
Alto community sometimes feels that
Stanford is using the area "as research
ground," she said, but not in this case.
"Stanford has been thoughtful and
sensitive.... They didn't come in and
tell we're doing things wrong — we've
had a constant dialogue," Frittoria said.
If the reading program is successful
this year, the district may develop a par
allel math-based program next year, she
added.
"I would love to see students, after
they tutor one year, help put together
lesson plans for the classes and make
the program more integrated," said Frit
toria.
She added that the program is also
currently involved in a children's devel
opment program and day care centers at
the schools.
"It's very inspiring and exciting to see
so much interest at Stanford," she said,
because the attitude is not one of helping
poor children in a bad area of town. In
stead, Frittoria said, "Students are ac
knowledging the fact that the entire ed
ucational system needs support."
