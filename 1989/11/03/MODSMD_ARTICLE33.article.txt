# The 						Bug explains plane at Dish, porn at Green, price for power
## 
### Aram Irwin 
Dear Bug Me,
Up by the Dish, surrounded by
barbed wire, is a partially dis
mantled Cessna 150 airplane. The
engine, propeller, seats, instru
ments and several control panels
are gone. What's up? Did it emer
gency land in the foothills? Or
did the pilot just do a lousy job
parking it?
a curious pilot
Quite a good question, M.B. No
one on campus seems to know.
After hours of calling around, I
finally contacted the folks cur
rently leasing the Dish, SRI —
formerly the Stanford Research
Institute, but now just SRI, an
independent, non-profit organiza
tion.
A laser specialist I talked to at
SRI had some knowledge of the
plane. The plane has nothing to
do with the Dish. It's used for
testing airborne radiation detect
ing equipment, and SRI just needs
somewhere to park it. It doesn't
fly and was hauled up by truck
two years ago. It will be hauled
back sometime soon or whenever
they get around to it, whichever
comes first.
Dear Bug,
The library doesn't carry Pent

house magazine, does it? Why
not? After all, it does have a large
readership.
- JF
Ah, JF, that reminds me of a
story I once heard about Pent
house publishers trying to print
in foreign countries. They gave
up when they found out that the
word for "Penthouse" in almost
all other languages translated as
"The Equally Crumby Apartment
on the Top Floor."
But back to your question. I'm
afraid you can't casually stroll
through the alphabetized Green

magazine stacks, pretending to
look for the Pentagon Quarterly
or Perestroika Today. It seems
that the kinkiest magazine you
can discreetly slip into your copy
of Newsweek is Red book, which
often publishes articles like "What
Your Mate Wants in Bed."
I aaked Jim Knox why Green
Library didn't carry Penthouse.
Jim is the Curator for U.S. and
British History, so his knowledge
of pornographic magazines is not
extensive, at least not on the pro
fessional level. Nevertheless, Jim
was able to give me a fairly good
answer. It seems that Penthouse
simply "doesn't support academic
programming," he said.
But the library does, however,
carry Playboy. I asked Jim about
this, pointing out Playboy's rather
weak academic record. "That's a
good question," pondered Jim,
pausing a second before replying.
Apparently the University is
cutting back on the more popular
publications in favor of the much
more unpopular and "tremen
dously expensive" science and
trade journals, a trade-off which
makes sense to me, because res
helving is such a hassle.
Jim went on to say that despite
funding cutbacks, the University
tries to keep "some representation

of genre point of view, but not
necessarily everything." I would
therefore deduce that the library
carries Playboy over Penthouse
because Playboy maintains a .. .
mmm, well .. . fairly expansive
point of view, without necessarily
showing everything, as Penthouse
usually does.
Of course, you do have to ask
for Playboy at the Circulations
Desk. But be careful when check
ing it out, because you're not too
likely to win friends. In the mean
time, you might occupy yourself
with your Human Sexuality
textbook, or maybe "The Joy of
Sex." Meyer has two copies.
Dear Bug Me,
How much energy does Stan
ford use in a year? And how much
the fridge?
— Eric "Gi-Gi" Gimon, Sopho
more
Well, Gi-Gi, I talked to Julie
Coopet at the Housing Energy
Conservation Center regarding
your query. Including Campus Se
curity's little electric go-karts, the
University uses about 150 million
kilowatt hours of electricity, 1 bil
lion gallons of water, and 10 mil
lion therms of natural gas (that's
70 million therms in dog therms).
Now you may be thinking,

"Wow, that's alotta energy! It
must cost a fortune!" How much
would you pay for that kinda en
ergy? Twenty-two billion dollars?
Two-hundred and twenty million
dollars? Well, for a limited time
only, you pay only 22 million dol
lars! That's about $1,800 a year
per student, figuring 12,000 total
students. But if you act now, Stan
ford will throw in a College Ed
ucation with low, low yearly

installments of $20,000! Now
that's a bargain.
And the fridge, Gimon, uses
about 1000 kilowatts a year, de
pending on how much root beer
and ginger ale you keep in it. So
basically, if Stanford devoted one
year's electricity to your fridge,
you could keep that stale ham
sandwich freshly stale for about
150,000 years, provided your
roommate Jim doesn't eat it first.

all other languages translated as
"The Equally Crumby Apartment
on the Top Floor."
But back to your question. I'm
afraid you can't casually stroll
through the alphabetized Green

magazine stacks, pretending to
look for the Pentagon Quarterly
or Perestroika Today. It seems
that the kinkiest magazine you
can discreetly slip into your copy
of Newsweek is Red book, which
often publishes articles like "What
Your Mate Wants in Bed."
I aaked Jim Knox why Green
Library didn't carry Penthouse.
Jim is the Curator for U.S. and
British History, so his knowledge
of pornographic magazines is not
extensive, at least not on the pro
fessional level. Nevertheless, Jim
was able to give me a fairly good
answer. It seems that Penthouse
simply "doesn't support academic
programming," he said.
But the library does, however,
carry Playboy. I asked Jim about
this, pointing out Playboy's rather
weak academic record. "That's a
good question," pondered Jim,
pausing a second before replying.
Apparently the University is
cutting back on the more popular
publications in favor of the much
more unpopular and "tremen
dously expensive" science and
trade journals, a trade-off which
makes sense to me, because res
helving is such a hassle.
Jim went on to say that despite
funding cutbacks, the University
tries to keep "some representation

of genre point of view, but not
necessarily everything." I would
therefore deduce that the library
carries Playboy over Penthouse
because Playboy maintains a .. .
mmm, well .. . fairly expansive
point of view, without necessarily
showing everything, as Penthouse
usually does.
Of course, you do have to ask
for Playboy at the Circulations
Desk. But be careful when check
ing it out, because you're not too
likely to win friends. In the mean
time, you might occupy yourself
with your Human Sexuality
textbook, or maybe "The Joy of
Sex." Meyer has two copies.
Dear Bug Me,
How much energy does Stan
ford use in a year? And how much
the fridge?

Well, Gi-Gi, I talked to Julie
Coopet at the Housing Energy
Conservation Center regarding
your query. Including Campus Se
curity's little electric go-karts, the
University uses about 150 million
kilowatt hours of electricity, 1 bil
lion gallons of water, and 10 mil
lion therms of natural gas (that's
70 million therms in dog therms).
Now you may be thinking,

"Wow, that's alotta energy! It
must cost a fortune!" How much
would you pay for that kinda en
ergy? Twenty-two billion dollars?
Two-hundred and twenty million
dollars? Well, for a limited time
only, you pay only 22 million dol
lars! That's about $1,800 a year
per student, figuring 12,000 total
students. But if you act now, Stan
ford will throw in a College Ed
ucation with low, low yearly

installments of $20,000! Now
that's a bargain.
And the fridge, Gimon, uses
about 1000 kilowatts a year, de
pending on how much root beer
and ginger ale you keep in it. So
basically, if Stanford devoted one
year's electricity to your fridge,
you could keep that stale ham
sandwich freshly stale for about
150,000 years, provided your
roommate Jim doesn't eat it first.

Dear Bug Me,
Up by the Dish, surrounded by
barbed wire, is a partially dis
mantled Cessna 150 airplane. The
engine, propeller, seats, instru
ments and several control panels
are gone. What's up? Did it emer
gency land in the foothills? Or
did the pilot just do a lousy job
parking it?
a curious pilot
Quite a good question, M.B. No
one on campus seems to know.
After hours of calling around, I
finally contacted the folks cur
rently leasing the Dish, SRI —
formerly the Stanford Research
Institute, but now just SRI, an
independent, non-profit organiza
tion.
A laser specialist I talked to at
SRI had some knowledge of the
plane. The plane has nothing to
do with the Dish. It's used for
testing airborne radiation detect
ing equipment, and SRI just needs
somewhere to park it. It doesn't
fly and was hauled up by truck
two years ago. It will be hauled
back sometime soon or whenever
they get around to it, whichever
comes first.
Dear Bug,
The library doesn't carry Pent

house magazine, does it? Why
not? After all, it does have a large
readership.
- JF
Ah, JF, that reminds me of a
story I once heard about Pent
house publishers trying to print
in foreign countries. They gave
up when they found out that the
word for "Penthouse" in almost
all other languages translated as
"The Equally Crumby Apartment
on the Top Floor."
