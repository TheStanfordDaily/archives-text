## Cardinal, Bruins to square off in battle of battered 
### Chris Crader Editorial staff 
Before the season began, tomor
row's Stanford-UCLA football
game looked like it would be a
big one. The Bruins figured it
would be a must-win to keep their
Rose Bowl hopes alive, while for
the Cardinal the game would be
a chance for new Coach Denny
(jreen to post a big win his first
year.
Eight weeks later, the contest
is still a big one but not for the
same reasons. The Bruins have
lost three straight Pacific 10 Con
ference games, and while they will
be playing in the Rose Bowl, it
will be next week against Oregon
instead of Jan. 1.
For Stanford, 1-7 overall and
1-4 in the Pac-10, the game is
another chance to turn around a
nightmarish season and build mo
mentum for the last two games.
The two teams meet at Stanford
Stadium tomorrow with kickoff
at 1 p.m.
"We've suffered through the
same kind of agonizing losses,"
Green said. "We are looking for
ward to our last three games. . . .
We look at them as opportunities."
UCLA Coach Terry Donahue
also feels the strain. "Obviously
we're in a situation we're very
unfamiliar with — having a losing

year and dealing with the frustra
tions. 1 didn't anticipate we'd be
in as bad of shape as we are when
the season began."
The Bruins, 3-5 overall and 2-3
in Pac-10 play, are currently the
only team in NCAA history to
win seven consecutive bowl games
and have the Pac-10's best win
ning percentage this decade, but
even if they win their remaining
three games this year, they prob
ably will not get a bowl bid.
"That fall is a great deal harder
from 10-2 to 3-5 tnan. . .from only
having «aeven wins," Donahue
said. "Now we find our football
team reeling. Coming down from
that pinnacle is very trying. . . .
We just need to focus on trying
to beat Stanford."
The Bruins returned most of
last season's 10-2 team and were
picked to finish second in the Pac
-10 by the coaches, but the loss of
quarterback Troy Aikman to
graduation was bigger than ex
pected. Aikman was the first
player chosen in the NFL draft
by the Dallas Cowboys.
"Anytime you lose an $11-
million player, you've lost a great
player," Donahue said. "Anytime
we were in a bad situation, he
was able to get us off the hook
with some fine plays."
This year UCLA has started
redshirt freshman Bret Johnson

at quarterback, and he has been
inconsistent. The Bruin ground
game has been successful, as
Kevin Williams, Brian Brown and
Shawn Wills have each rushed for
more than 300 yards, but the
passing game has been up and
down.
"At the beginning of the year
we wanted to run the ball because
we thought we had a good offen
sive line and good backs,"
Donahue said. "We thought we'd
gradually pass more as the season
went on. Instead, exactly the op
posite happened. We were unable,
at the beginning of the year, to
generate any consistent type of
rushing offense."
The Bruin defense, which was
considered a strength before the
season started, also has been a
little disappointing. The team is
first in the Pac-10 in passing de
fense, but dead last in rushing
defense. In fact, UCLA gives up
more yards on the ground than
they do through the air.
This presents an interesting
matchup for the game tomorrow.
Can Stanford, ranked last in the
Pac-10 in rushing, run the ball on
the Bruins? And can the Bruin
defense shut-down the pass-happy
Cardinal offense?
Personnel will play an impor
tant role, and it looks like the
Cardinal may have the advantage.
Running back Jon Volpe, a first
team All-Pac-10 performer last
year, has played in only two games
this year due to a knee injury. He
underwent arthroscopic surgery
three weeks ago and has practiced
some this week.
He is listed as questionable still,
but if he can play, he will surely
give the anemic Cardinal ground
game a boost.
The other question for Cardinal
fans is who will start at quarter
back. Redshirt freshman Steve
Smith has been inconsistent all
season. Sometimes he looks like
the cool veteran who finished the
comeback win over Oregon. Other
times he is flustered by the rush
and can't find his receivers.
Green said early in the week
that junior Brian Johnson would
start this week, if he's healthy.
Johnson was listed as the starter
last week but didn't even make
the trip to Los Angeles due to a
sore shoulder and a badly bruised

knee. He appears to be better this
week and will likely be able to
play tomorrow.
Defensively, Stanford also ap
pears to be getting healthier. Out
side linebacker Rob Hinckley, who
sacked Aikman 4Vi times in last

year's game to win Sports Il
lustrated and Pac-10 Defensive
Player-of-th»;rWeeto fias
returned a lack
Hinckley had only four tackles
against USC last week but feels
he is getting stronger.

He doesn't think he's ready to
have the type of game he had
Ihe Bruins last year,
tkcwagh. *\I don't think they're de
signing a game plan around me,"
he said. "Hopefully they will, be
cause that would be stupid."
