# Cardinal spikes USC in three straight
## Stanford looks for a repeat performance against No. 2 UCLA tonight at home 
### Chris Crader Editorial staff 
Facing the problem of playing three top-10
teams in six days, the Stanford women's vol
leyball team came up with a good solution —
playing the best volleyball they have played
all year.
After having an up-and-down first half of
the year, the Cardinal played its third straight
good match to overwhelm No. 9 USC 15-4,
15-12, 15-10 in Old Pavilion last night. Stan
ford improved to 13-6 overall, 9-3 and in sole
possession of second place in the Pacific 10
Conference. The Trojans fell to 16-8, 9-5 and
in third in the conference.
The seventh-ranked Cardinal hit a season
best .424 for the match and got 18 kills from
both Bev Oden and Kristin Klein.
"I thought for the most part we played really
well," Coach Don Shaw said. "It was a pretty
good match."
The Cardinal avenged a loss the team suf
fered to the Trojans four weeks ago and picked
up a lot of momentum for tonight's match
with No. 2 UCLA. The Bruins are 19-1 overall,
13-0 in the conference and have not lost a
Pac-10 match since 1987.
"We played well in bursts," USC Coach Lisa
Love said. "We couldn't seem to maintain a
standard of play that was satisfactory to com
pete. . . . We missed too many serves."
The Trojans served hard the entire match
in an effort to force the Cardinal into passing
problems. USC did come up with six aces, but
missed 10 serves and the Cardinal had no
problems passing except in the second game.
After winning the first game easily, the Car
dinal took a 7-5 lead in game two. The Trojans
stormed back with seven consecutive points
as the Cardinal passing broke down, but Stan
ford rebounded.
Stanford scored three quick points before a
USC time out. Then senior Laura Olesen aced
Trojan Megan McCallister to make it 12-11.
McCallister spiked into the antenna to tie it
up, then Oden and Klein each got kills to set
up game point. Olesen, who was still serving,
hit another ace past McCallister to the same
spot and Stanford won the game.
Stanford jumped out to a 5-0 lead in the
third game and never looked back.
Oden'B 18 kills tied her career high and after
posting a .659 hitting percentage last night,
she has a leg up on the competition to be
named the Pac-10 Player of the Week for a
second consecutive week. She won the award
last week by hitting .500 over three matches.
"I think we played really well together as
a team," Klein said. "We didn't make many
mistakes, and I think we dominated them and
didn't give them a chance to get into the

Freshman Kristi Paaso had her
best hitting night of the season
for the Cardinal, recording five
kills in seven tries for a .714 per
centage. She also had a team-high
seven digs and had two aces.
McCallister, the Trojans' kill
leader this year, was held to only
eight kills and a .000 hitting per
centage. But Stanford has less
than 24 hours to savor the win

before facing the Bruins. "I'm
looking forward to it," Shaw said.
"Hopefully we're going to be ready
to do the right thing and not make
a lot of mistakes."
