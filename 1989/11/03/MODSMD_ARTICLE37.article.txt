# Booters fall to Gaels, eye Broncos in finale
## 
### Andrew Wilcox Staff writer 
After falling 2-0 to St. Mary's
yesterday in Moraga to continue
its late-season nosedive, the Car
dinal men's soccer team will try
to close on a positive note Sunday
in the season finale at No. 1 Santa
Clara.
Yesterday's loss, which dropped
the squad to 8-10-2, continued a
downward spiral for Stanford and
ensured the team's first losing
season in three years. In the sec
ond half of the season, the Car
dinal has slumped to 2-6-1.
Since learning that the playoffs
wire out of the picture, the Stan
ford squad has had difficulty mus
tering enough intensity to play 90

minutes of solid soccer, and the
trend continued in yesterday's
contest.
Although the Cardinal opened
well, the team's intensity seemed
to come and go, as the Gaels cap
italized on two Stanford defensive
lapses, one in each half, to score
the decisive goals. Both scores
came on point blank attempts
which fresnman goalkeeper Kyle
Krpata had no chance of blocking.
The Gaels, who clung to slim
playoff hopes with the win, man
aged to shut down the Stanford
offense to hang on for the 2-0
victory.
As has often been the case this
year, the Cardinal succumbed as
a result of its inability to convert
offensive opportunities into goals.
The squad suffered its seventh
shutout of the season. "We didn't
have the killer instinct today,"
senior goalkeeper Chris Helling
said.
"It's been hard for the team to
get up for these last few games.
It shouldn't be like this, but we
seem to have lost that extra edge,"
said Cardinal midfielder-forward
Rhett Harty, who leads the team
with seven goals.
Sunday's game against unde
feated Santa Clara, the top team
in the country according to the
coach's poll, will provide an even
tougher test for the Cardinal. The
Broncos, who seem to be in posi
tion for a run at the national
championship, have no visible
weaknesses and play high
pressure, fast-paced soccer.
The game will be the last in a
Stanford uniform for three of the

team's strongest and most consis
tent performers of the last four
years: sweeper Mark Semioli, Hel
ling, and forward Chris Porch.
Semioli, the Cardinal's field
general and a candidate for All-
America honors, said of himself
and his fellow seniors, "What we
do now will have an effect on
what happens in the future.
Having been part of the team for
so long, we've got a responsibility
to the program."
Helling, who has manned the
nets for the last three seasons,
added that he and the other sen
iors "want to end our careers on
a high note.
"Intensity will be a given for
us. We'll definitely be fired up,
and we know we have the ability
to play with the top teams," Hel
ling said.
The Cardinal will need a big
turnaround from its last several
games in order to even stay on
the same field as the Broncos,
although such a reversal is likely.
The Stanford squad traditionally
has played exceptionally against
the best teams in the country,
taking former No. 1 Virginia into
overtime before losing earlier in
the season.
Furthermore, the Cardinal and
Broncos have developed a bitter
Silicon Valley rivalry. Harty em
phasized the team's mutual dis
taste, saying, "We don't like each
other. We've gotten in fights with
them during spring games."
