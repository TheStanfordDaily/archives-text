# Hockey looks to finish strong against Pacific
## 
### John Louie Staff writer 
After returning from a tough
East Coast trip, the Stanford
women's field hockey team looks
to today's game, against Univer
sity of the Pacific, as a vindication
of sorts.
Although hopes for post-season
play are all but extinguished for
the Cardinal, a victory over the
Tigers would give California the
Northern Pacific Conference
Title. Ironically, awarding the
honor to their arch-rivals is just
what the team plans to do.
"Our coaching staff is really
good friends with the Berkeley
coaches," midfielder Susan Leck
rone said. "We'd all want to see
Berkeley take the title."
For Stanford, 1-2-2 in confer
ence play and 1-12-3 overall, this
final game of the season could
vindicate its grueling East Coast
trip. Forced to play four games
in five days on unfamiliar artifi
cial turf, the Cardinal emerged
from the games disappointed, bat
tered, and hungry for a win.
Last weekend, Stanford fell to
Lafayette College, 2-1, and
Temple, 4-1. Goals from junior
Katherine Pyrde and co-captain

Michelanne Baker kept the Car
dinal in the games at halftime,
but in each game, the second half
proved to be Stanford's demise.

After a 7-0 loss to Rutgers Tues
day, Baker notched her second
goal of the trip against Villanova.
Although Patricia McJennett also
scored for Stanford, the Cardinal
lost to Villanova, 5-2.
Adding injury to insult, two
Stanford players suffered ir\juries
on the trip. Sophomore sweeper
Laura Romeu ii\jured her wrist
in one of the matches, and Leck
rone redislocated her shoulder.
Both will be sidelined today.
