# Cardinal hockey set to ice Golden Bears
## 
### Alex Hoye Staff writer 
Imagine a sport that features
athletes alternately cruising
gracefully at breakneck speeds
and slamming violently into one
another. It is a sport that offers
its spectators free admission
and beer on tap. And no, Bo
doesn't know it.
No question. . . . Stanford Ice
Hockey is one of the best spec
tator sports on campus.
The Cardinal team hits the
ice in Redwood City tonight at
7:30 against California in an
icy version of Big Game. The
Bears are riding a two-game
winning streak into Stanford's
season opener, but Coach Ernie
Ferrari expects an excellent
matchup.
The series continues tomor
row as the Cardinal faces the
Bears on their own ice at
Berkeley.
In its third year, the team
has "done pretty well" and is

"improving every season," ac
cording to Ferrari. Ferrari has
coached hockey for the past 12
years and has played competi
tively several years in Alaska.
Competing in the Pacific
Coast Hockey Association, the
Stanford team has placed third
in the playoffs for two years
in a row. With an experienced
team and the addition of some
new defensemen, Ferrari is
confident the team will do even
better this year.
The Cardinal looks ahead to
a stronger league that might
be formed by creating a 6-PAC,
similar to baseball's. And Divi
sion I status? Well, that is
several years down the road,
according to Greg Lottridge, a
defenseman.
Until then, Ferrari and the
rest of the team urge all inter
ested students to "give hockey
a shot." The games are held
most weekends at the Golden
Gate Ice Arena on 3140 Bay
Road in Redwood City. Call
573-0950 for further details.
