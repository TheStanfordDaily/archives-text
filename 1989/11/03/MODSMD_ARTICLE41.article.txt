# Polo hopes to prove dominance over UCLA
## 
### T.C. Hall Staff writer 
After the water polo team's loss
to California Wednesday, Coach
Dante Dettamanti once again
finds himself re-evaluating his
team's goals. Tomorrow's match
against No. 5 UCLA at noon finds
the Cardinal no longer concerned
with its national ranking, but how
it will end up in the Pacific 10

Conference.
"We are shooting for second in
the Pac-10," Dettamanti said.
"That is what this game is all
about."
The loss to California dropped
Stanford to 2-2 in conference play,
but the team still remains in sec
ond, ahead of the 1-2 Bruins.
UCLA and Stanford have played
twice this season. Stanford lost
early in the season but won the

last contest 10-8.
"We pretty much dominated
that last game," Dettamanti said.
Even with that last win, Det
tamanti is not confident of a vic
tory. "Traditionally, they play us
very hard," Dettamanti said. With
free water polo tickets given out
with the purchase of football tick
ets, Dettamanti expects a big
crowd. Water polo games last an
hour, so fans can catch most of

the action at DeGuerre before the
football kickoff.
UCLA will be playing for more
than the crowd, however.
"UCLA has some incentive to
beat us," Dettamanti said. "They
still have a chance for second in
the Pac-10 if they beat us."
UCLA also is battling with Cal
State-Long Beach for the fifth —
and last — California team spot
in the NCAAs. Dettamanti
believes that UCLA will get the
bid anyway, but every victory
helps.
If UCLA does remain fifth, and
Stanford stays at fourth, the
teams will meet in the first round
of the nationals. Dettamanti
would like to use this game to
send a message to the Bruin
players.
"If we meet in the NCAAs, I
want them to know that we have
dominated them," Dettamanti
said. "If we dominate them two
weekends in a row, it would erase
doubts in our minds and put
doubts in their minds that they
can beat us."
Dettamanti also worries about
a drop in his team's intensity level
after Wednesday's loss to No. 1
California.
