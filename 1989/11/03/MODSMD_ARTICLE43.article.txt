NEW YORK (AP) — Rickey Henderson
wants to return to the Oakland Athletics —
for a price.
Henderson, the star of the American League
playoffs and a co-star of the World Series,
filed for free agency yesterday, five days after
the A's completed a four-game sweep of the
San Francisco Giants.
"1 would say that all things being equal,
Rickey certainly would like to stay in Oakland
and finish his career there," Richie Bry, Hen
derson's agent, said Thursday. "His home is
there and his family is there."
But there is a big but.
"This may be his last mtgor contract," Bry
said, "and so he has to capitalize on it for his
family."
Henderson, selected Most Valuable Player
of the American League playoffs, returned to
Oakland on June 20 in a trade with the New
York Yankees. Henderson rejected a $7.2 mil
lion, three-year offer from the Yankees before
being traded to Oakland. He is believed to be
asking for more than $3 million a year.
"I have a meeting scheduled with Sandy
Alderson on the 15th of November in San
Francisco," Bry said, referring to the A's vice
president for baseball operations. Bry said Hen
derson would deal only with Oakland for the
time being.
"As far as I'm concerned," Bry said, "I'm
glad to give Sandy whatever time he feels he
needs for exclusive negotiations."
Henderson hit .247 with the Yankees with
25 steals. With the A's, he batted .294 with
52 steals in 58 attempts. He stole nine bases
in the playoffs and two more in the World
Series, along with nine hits in 19 at-bats
against San Francisco with a double, a triple
and a home run.
"I have a starting figure, which I'm not
going to disclose, and I have a rather set
pattern of dealing with free agents which I
think is extremely fair to the home club if the
player wants to go back," Bry said. "I do not
try to create a bidding war. That's not my
philosophy of doing a free-agent contract. A
player and I discuss how much money he wants
from his home club and from others clubs.
They may be different numbers or they may
be the same. You certainly give the home club
every opportunity to meet that figure before
you even talk to other clubs."
