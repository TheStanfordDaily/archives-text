# Sailors look to regroup after difficult regattas
## 
### Sarah Gannett 
While there wasn't much wind last
weekend, there was just enough to
blow away Stanford's hopes of sailing
to victory at either of the two regattas
it attended.
On both coasts, the Stanford sailing
team suffered difficult losses. At the
Schell Trophy Regatta at MIT, the
Stanford squad went from first to 13th
in just six races. At the Pacific Coast
Sloop Championships, one bad race
kept the Cardinal from qualifying for
nationals.

The Schell was the first in
tersectional regatta that Stanford has
participated in since the beginning of
its season. In the first race of the
competition, Brady Sih and Matt Dun
bar placed second and, in another di
vision, teammates Brett Adams and
Kathryn Haggitt placed fourth, put
ting Stanford right at the top of the
17-boat fleet. Then the winds abruptly
died, allowing the home teams to take
advantage of local knowledge and score
win after win.
Stanford made the trip back east to

scope out the area where dinghy na
tionals will be held this June. "That
made it all worthwhile," team captain
Dunbar said. "We learned a lot about
sailing on the Charles River."
The sloop team also managed to be
upbeat, despite its defeat. "We felt
good about our sailing," skipper Dave
Dowd said. "We're confident that next
year, with two out of our three
member team returning, we will
qualify for nationals."
Dowd ? Scott Dale, and Robert Brown
were edged out by UC-Irvine, which

qualified for nationals by winning the
regatta, and Cal State-Long Beach,
which placed second. Bad fortune in
the first race of the series cost Stan
ford the regatta as the Cardinal boat
hit a mark and was forced to do penalty
circles.
The team looks forward to this week
end when the entire squad will travel
to the North-South Intersectional.The
results of this most important regatta
of the fall will determine which teams
from California can compete in pres
tigious spring regattas.
