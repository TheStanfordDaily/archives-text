# Dodge drives Greeks
## Stanford alum picks alma mater over UCLA 
### Buck Montana Senior staff writer 
Continuing the trend of being
a day late and a dollar short, the
Greek of the Week has gone to
USC a week late to find the
Guest Greek.
The lucky winner is Linda
Dodge, the assistant Sports In
formation Director at USC, and
a Stanford graduate. Dodge, a
former student intern at the
Stanford SID office, took the job
in Trojan-land last August. But
she is not yet a Trojan fan and
was seen cheering for the Cardi
nal at last night's USC-Stanford
women's volleyball match.
Dodge did do the right thing
in picking USC to beat Oregon
State this weekend, but admits,
"I would get fired if I didn't pick
them to win big."
Despite not being a a USC con
vert, Dodge said working in La

La Land has been informative.
"The one thing I've learned at
USC is that despite the fact that
the band sucks (it practices right
outside my office window), the
players are good (as they will tell
you)."
Dodge was true to her school
in picking the Cardinal to beat
the Bruins tomorrow.
In the standings, Mark Rogow
sky continues to lead but "Mer
cenary" Nat Cousins has moved
up along the outside. In the other
half of the standings, David Hir
ning rose like the Great Pumpkin
out of the cellar by going 8-2 last
week.
This development leaves sports
editor Greg Gottesman, also
known as the "voiceless" one due
to a nasty variety of cold, all by
his lonesome in the basement.
Meanwhile Chris Crader goes
lone wolf again, picking Arizona
State to upset Washington.
