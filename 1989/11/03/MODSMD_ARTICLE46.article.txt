# Health programs band together

Although the Oct. 17 earth
quake disrupted academia, the
chaos united aerobic enthusiasts.
For the first time, aerobic
classes sponsored by the Health
Improvement Program for faculty
and staff and Cowell Student
Health Center's Health Promotion
Program came together in re
sponse to damaged exercise facil
ities.
More than 100 dedicated
aerobic enthusiasts from both
groups exercised together in Roble
Gym, under the direction of in
structors from both programs, for
the first week after the earth
quake.
The two programs have never
been involved in a joint effort
before, despite fundamental
similarities. According to Stacey
Parton, director of the Cowell pro
gram, both are identical in their
mission "to improve the health
and well-being of the Stanford

community" through education
and counseling.
Both the Cowell and faculty
programs sponsor research used
to shape University health policies
on smoking, AIDS awareness and
food service nutrition. They also
offer student internships in health
promotion, administration and
communication.
Despite a common framework,
the two programs provide services
to different populations within the
Stanford community. The Cowell
program targets undergraduate
and graduate students, while the
Personnel Department funds its
program for faculty and staff and
their families.
Each program focuses on spe
cific issues and needs of its target
population. For example, the
Cowell program offers infor
mation on contraception, and the
faculty program provides informa
tion on stress management in the
workplace.
Responding to different needs

of students and staff, both pro
grams offer identical aerobics
classes on separate time
schedules. As a result, the two
groups have never interacted
before.
After the earthquake, the stu
dent aerobics facilities in Old Pa
vilion and Rains Graduate
Housing were out of commission.
In what Jerrie Moo-Thurman,
the assistant director of the
Cowell program, referred to as a
"wonderful gesture of cooperative
integration and instruction," the
faculty instructors joined with
those from the student program,
holding classes twice the normal
size.
Deliberately integrated events
between the two programs are a
possibility in the future, according
to Tia Rich, assistant director of
the faculty program.
"Our minds were definitely
broadened by the experience, and
we are discussing the potential for
a joint student-staff class."
