# Recyclers' efforts pay off in conserved resources

"You can make a difference,"
read the signs on the green recy
cling barrels located across
campus.
And Stanford students, faculty
and staff certainly have. Last
year, they saved enough energy
through recycling to light 2,440
hundred-watt bulbs for a full year
and send a car from Palo Alto to
New York 493 times.
Barb Voss, coordinator of the
Stanford Recycling Center, cites
statistics like these with satisfac
tion. She and 25 other employees
at the center can take credit for
leading an increasingly successful
recycling program at Stanford.
The center has placed recycling
barrels in hundreds of locations

on campus to collect paper, alu
minum cans and glass bottles.
The barrels are hard to miss.
They are nearly everywhere â€”
outside and inside Tresidder Un
ion, in Quad buildings, even at
places like Angell Field.
The center's employees empty
the barrels regularly, taking the
contents to a lot next to the Stan
ford Credit Union for sorting.
After barrel contents are sorted,
the recyclable materials are sold
to companies like the Circo Corp.,
which buys glass, and Weyer
haeuser, which buys paper.
The Stanford Recycling Center
began as a small, student-run,
student-funded operation 12 years
ago. Today it handles seven times
the volume of recyclable material
that it did in its first year.

The center is still run by stu
dents, with the exception of Voss,
who stayed on after graduating in
1988 to become the coordinator.
However, the operation is now of
ficially a part of the University.
This means that the administra
tion provides some funding for
equipment at the center and pays
operating expenses that the Cen
ter cannot cover from its earnings.
Last year, the center earned
about $122,000 from selling
recyclable material while spending
about $11,000 more than that in
operating costs. The University
made up the difference.
Voss said that the center's rev
enue has been hurt in recent years
by a "crash" in the prices paid by
companies buying recyclable
paper.

But she added that profit is not
the primary purpose for operating
the center. If that were the case,
she said, the center would collect
only white paper, cans and com
puter paper for recycling. Those
materials are the most profitable
to recycle.
Instead, the money made from
selling those materials is used to
subsidize collection of others, like
glass and cardboard. Voss said
that recycling cardboard, though
not profitable, is the best way to
save trees. She estimated that the
center has saved at least 133,000
trees in its 12-year history.
There are other benefits to recy
cling, Voss said.
For one, recycling saves landfill
space. The material recycled at
Stanford last year saved 4,092

cubic yards of landfill space. Also,
manufacturing with recycled ma
terial as opposed to original or
"virgin" material uses from 60 to
75 percent less water and reduces
pollution by 60 to 80 percent.
Voss said she is grateful for the
support the center has received
from University administrators.
"The administration has helped
us grow from a flaky student or
ganization to an integral part of
the University's waste manage
ment system," she said.
Despite its official status, the
recycling center is still run differ
ently than other campus organi
zations. All of its management de
cisions are reached through con
sensus among the employees.
"The emphasis is on participa
tion," Voss said.
