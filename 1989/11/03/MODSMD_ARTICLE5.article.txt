# Stanford athletes maintain high academic performances

Editor's note: This is the last in a series
of articles on athletes and academics at
Stanford.

There's no escape from hard work and
sweat for Stanford athletes, both on and
off the field.
To meet the University's high academic
standards, athletes must commit many
hours to their studies in order to stay on
the ball academically.
"The trick is to make sure that while
[they] are involved in athletics, they don't
lose sight of the academics," said athletic
academic adviser Dandre Desandies.
In a five-year study ending in 1987, the
National Collegiate Athletic Association
found that the graduation rate for college
athletes averaged 48 percent. Rates at some
colleges were as low as 20 percent while
others topped 80 percent.
But Stanford's graduation rate for
recruited athletes in past years has ranged
from 82 to 93 percent â€” the highest in
the Pacific 10 Conference.
Overall graduation rates for Stanford un
dergraduates range from 82 to 88 percent.
For the entering class of 1982, according
to the 1987 study, 92.6 percent of the
recruited athletes graduated, while only
87.2 percent of the overall class graduated.
However, Damodharan Namboothiri, di

rector of research for the Registrar's Office,
cautioned that this statistic is not neces
sarily representative of usual graduation
rates because it accounts for only one year.
Stanford athletes also have higher grade
point averages and SAT scores than other
Pac-10 athletes, Athletic Director Andy
Geiger said.
Eventually, Stanford would like to
achieve a 100 percent graduation rate for
athletes, Desandies said. To reach this goal,
special tutoring and advising services are
available to athletes.

ATHLETES
AND
ACADEMICS

Staying On The Ball
The Undergraduate Advising Center
oversees some of these services, including
the Athletes' Resource Center, a study hall
in Larkin that is mandatory for freshman
athletes and open to all athletes.
The resource center provides tutors five
nights a week in various subjects. This
service is particularly helpful smce athletes
often have practice during professors' office
hours, said Desandies, who helps coordinate

the service and ensures that
players attend nightly sessions.
Athletes may also encounter
scheduling problems with classes
that are only offered in the after
noon during practice. "This is
something we want to improve,
maybe by offering night [clas
ses]," Desandies said.
But coaches will sometimes ac
commodate athletes with after
noon classes.
"Coaches are understanding,"
said David Brody, a sophomore on
the fencing team. "I have a
chemistry lab which meets Tues
day afternoons, so I miss fencing
practice, but the coaches say it's
not a problem."
Women's tennis Coach Frank
Brennan said, "We prefer athletes
not to have afternoon classes, but
if it is necessary, they can come
late or make up the missed time
on their own."

Three women on the tennis
team are missing various prac
tices this quarter, Brennan said,
but he added that, especially out
of season, it is acceptable.
Desandies said that while ath
letics are important at Stanford,
"We are not simply producing pro
fessional athletes."
An athlete must pass an
average of 12 units a quarter in
order to remain eligible to partic
ipate in athletics.
Eligibility is re-evaluated at the
beginning of every quarter. If an
athlete is short of the necessary
units, advanced placement credits
or summer school credits can
sometimes be applied toward the
requirement, Desandies said.
But, he added, "We don't focus
on the number of units necessary
to be eligible, but rather those
necessary to graduate."
In the past four years,
Desandies said, he has known of
only one athlete who was in
eligible because of a shortage of
units.

Although high academic stand
ards and high athletic standards
can sometimes clash at a univer
sity like Stanford, Desandies said
he is confident "academics and
athletics will stay because the
community is behind them."
