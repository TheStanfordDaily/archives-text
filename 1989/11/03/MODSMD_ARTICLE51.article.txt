Guards keep eye on parties
When Tulane University students go to their
next party, they will be greeted at the door by
a security guard, a result of new alcohol policy
guidelines.
One Tulane security guard is required for all
closed events on campus expecting an attendance
between 50 and 150 people. Another officer for
each additional 150 people may also be necessary,
depending upcn the type of event.
For all off-campus, closed events, including
Greek parties, hosts must hire a police officer
from the New Orleans Police Department if at
tendance is expected to exceed 150 people. Open
events require one officer for each crowd of be
tween one and 150 people.
The security officers' duties do not include
checking IDs or monitoring the guest lists and
consumption, but they are responsible for report
ing infractions of the alcohol policy to the proper
university officials.

Students say Cal limits minorities
Students at Berkeley's Boalt Hall School of Law
have charged that the admissions office sent out
deferment letters in an attempt to reduce minor
ity enrollment.
Dana McPhall, president of Law Students of
African Descent, said the letters, offering accepted
students the opportunity to delay entrance, were
targeted at minority students to reduce the num
ber of students of color.

In an effort to reduce the total class size,
deferment letters were mailed to out-of-state stu
dents in the predominantly bottom quarter of
the incoming class, in which there is a dispropor
tionate number of minority students. This year
320 people accepted offers of admission to Boalt,
while the school had expected only 270 students.
Controversy has arisen over charges that non
minority students in the bottom quarter of the
incoming class did not receive letters while mi
nority students in the top 75th percentile did.
Boalt Hall Dean Jesse Choper said that the
letters were sent to those "whom, if we had
known we were going to have an overacceptance,
we probably wouldn't have accepted."

UC speech policy stirs criticism
A new University of California policy which
allows the university to expel students for verbal
harassment has received mixed reviews. UCLA
student leaders have accused it of being both too
vague and too specific.
The policy punishes offenders whose "fighting
words" interfere with the education of other stu
dents.
Critics question the meaning of this phrase
and attack it as being too broad and not clearly
defining the extent to which the harassment must
occur. Others claim it is too narrow and does
not address other types of harassment.
