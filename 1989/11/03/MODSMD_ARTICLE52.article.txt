Although often viewed as a
group of well-educated profession
als, Asian-Americans are
polarized into a small group of
affluent workers and a majority
of underpaid blue-collar laborers,
according to Michael Chang, res
ident fellow at Okada House.
"The stereotype (that all Asian
Americans are upwardly mobile)
is out of context.... The commu
nity is very polarized, so that
there is a high percentage of pro
fessional people, but also a much
higher percentage of garment and
restaurant workers," Chang said
at a workshop held at Okada last
night.
The aim of the workshop enti
tled "Where Are the Majority of
Asian Americans?" was to discuss
many widely held misconceptions
about Asian-Americans and to
bring out the truth about the past
and current exploitation of many
members of this community, or
ganizers said.
The workshop was part of a
series celebrating the Asian Amer
ican Student Association's 20th
anniversary.
Chang said the average income
for Asian-Americans is "artifi
cially high" because there are
many differences in Asian-
American life that are not taken

The community is very polarized, so
that there is a high percentage of pro
fessional people but also a much higher
percentage of garment and restaurant
workers.'

into account in calculating the
average.
"These figures don't show the
number of incomes per family or
the number of hours worked," he
said. "Also, most Asian-
Americans live in the urban areas
with the highest cost of living in
the nation."
Chang was followed by Shiree
Teng, a former business agent for
the International Garment
Workers Association who is now
working with food processing
workers from Watsonville and
Salinas. She said that many of
these workers are routinely ex
ploited.
"There are garment workers in
Chinatown who sew 10 hours a
day, six days a week and receive
only 54 cents per dozen l.ems,"
she said. "The owners of these
shops keep two sets of books, one
for the auditors and one for the
actual payroll. It's the same in
basements in New York City.

Their unions are only trying to
protect their federally mandated
rights."
She also described a similar sit
uation for food processing
workers in Watsonville.
"At the cannery, there are wom
en, mostly Korean, Chinese and
Chicano, who have been on the
job for 20 years," she said. "When
they started, they considered it
an excellent job. They had fair
hours and good pay. However, last
year the company wanted to cut
back their wages from six dollars
an hour to four. They were on
the picket line 22 months before
the company settled."
To show how this exploitation
arose historically, Teng presented
a slide show put together by the
Chinese Progressive Association
of Chinatown describing the his
tory of Chinese-Americans in in
dustries such as mining and
railroads.
