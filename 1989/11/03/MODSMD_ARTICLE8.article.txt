Police search for bathroom peeper
Stanford Police are searching for a man who
entered Madera House Tuesday morning, messed
up the women's bathroom and looked at a female
student in the shower.
During the early morning, the suspect scattered
shaving cream around the women's bathroom
and defecated on the floor. Around 6 a.m., the
female student entered to shower. While bathing,
she caught a glimpse of a figure looking around
the curtain.
By the time the student found a resident as
sistant, the suspect had vanished. A note referring
to the incident was later found on the student's
door.
According to Stanford Police Capt. Raoul
Niemeyer, the suspect is a white male of medium
build, around 18 to 21 years old. He is estimated
to be about 5 feet 6 inches tall, though he may
be taller.
The suspect was wearing a gray sweatshirt
and light pants at the time of the incident. He
had short bangs and brown, thick, wavy, shoulder
length hair; however, Niemeyer believes that the
suspect may have worn a wig.
Niemeyer added that the suspect's description
is different from those involved in two sexual
incidents of the past week. One incident was a
rape attempt in the Foothills; the other was an
incident of indecent exposure in a campus parking
garage.
To prevent further incidents in the Madera
bathroom, resident fellow Christy Junkerman has
placed a lock on the bathroom door. She empha
sized that everyone in a residence, not just the
females, has the responsibility to question sus
picious characters loitering in the area.
Persons with information about the incident
are asked to call Stanford Police at 723-9633.

Economic integration discussed
Scholars from the United States, Canada and
Mexico will meet at Stanford today and tomorrow
to discuss a research agenda for studying North
American integration and interdependence.

The meeting follows on one held in July at
Cocoyoc, Mexico, where participants agreed the
topic merited a mqjor collaborative research effort
to be conducted over several years, said Clark
Reynolds, director of Americas Program, which
is sponsoring the Stanford meeting.
"The recent free trade agreement between the
United States and Canada and the dramatic turn
around in Mexico's trade and investment policy
suggest that the integration of the three North
American economies — already far advanced —
may soon result in a regional trading bloc to
rival the scale and importance of Europe's EC-92
(the European Community)," said Reynolds, a
professor at Stanford's Food Research Institute.
"The political and social implications, as well
as the economic, are far from understood. Nec
essary public policy measures need to be ex
amined and discussed," he said.
These were the reasons the participants, from
the University of Toronto, the Lyndon Baines
Johnson School at the University of Texas, El
Colegio de Mexico and the Americas Program at
Stanford, embarked on the project.
While the agenda-setting session is restricted
to the participants, there will be public sessions
in the future to discuss the research and its
broad implications for the three countries, ac
cording to Stephen Watkins, associate director of
the Americas Program.
