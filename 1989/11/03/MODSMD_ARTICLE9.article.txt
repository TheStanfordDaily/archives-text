Mixed media artist Flo Wong
had a special message about
Asian-American students attend
ing her visual arts presentation
Wednesday evening: "We have a
80ul."
The presentation in Toyon
lounge was one in a series of eight
educational and cultural pro
grams this week commemorating
the 20th anniversary of the Asian
American Student Association.
Wong, co-founder of the Asian
American Women's Artist Associ
ation, offered advice to the stu
dents assembled: "It's a big world
out there. You have to decide
where you want to fit. We all make
our statements in different ways,
and they're all valid. First you
have to know yourself."
She began her presentation
with an autobiographical and his
torical account of Old Chinatown
in San Francisco, entitled "Open

Chinatown Series."
Wong also read a variety of
poems which were reflective of her
Asian-American experiences.
Last, she displayed a slide of a
stitchery of rice sacks that she
created as a symbol of Asian
peoples and as a testimony to her
parents for their hard work and
suffering.
"I'm honoring you and me,
making us visible through this
kind of symbol," she said.
Explaining that there is a fear
among Asian-American students
to pursue art due to pressure from
parents, Wong said she hopes to
serve as a role model and to dispel
stereotypes of Asians as mainly
doctors and engineers.
Since 1978, she has been in
volved with abstract and realist
art in the form of ink paintings,
stitchery, drawings and pastels.
Some of her literary accomplish
ments include published pieces in
Silhouette Magazine, Gallery and

'We all make our
statements in differ
ent ways, and they're
all valid. First you
have to know your
self.'
