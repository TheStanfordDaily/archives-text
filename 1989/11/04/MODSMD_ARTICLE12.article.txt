# Delts pick up pieces after the earthquake

Everybody in the Bay Area who
was affected by the recent earth
quake knows how hard it was to
put the pieces back together af
terwards. Many students on the
Stanford campus had to deal with
new living arrangements, switch
ing classroom locations and closed
buildings, all while trying to keep
up with schoolwork.
One group of students, however,
had all of these things to deal
with plus one other item. The
Stanford football team had to try
to prepare for their impending
football game against Utah.
The Delta Tau Delta fraternity
house was condemned immedi
ately after the quake and was
later deemed unsafe for the rest
of the year. Among the Delts with
out housing were about 15 foot

ball players. These players, along
with the rest of the squad, missed
one full football practice on the
Wednesday after the quake. In ad
dition, the Delts had to miss half
of Thursday's practice to get
moved out of the house and into
temporary housing.
Senior strong safety Rob
Englehardt, a Delt, said the earth
quake hindered preparation for
the game against Utah. "Sure,
Utah was on our mind, but miss
ing practice hurt us a lot. It was
distracting. They have a really
complicated offense, and we had
to learn it in one week. Losing
all that practice time sure didn't
help at all."

they were out of their house, nose

up in the air.
ily played a particularly important
role. The Hansons, who live in
Menlo Park, sheltered the football
players and some other Delts in
their home until they could find
permanent housing.
"Without the Hanson family we
would have been in big trouble,"
Englehardt said. "We just can't
thank them enough."
Englehardt said that the Uni
versity offered little or no help
when it came to moving out of
the house for good. "The Univer
sity didn't send any trucks or any
thing to make it easier to move.
Some of the University workers,
however, were great. They worked
eight to 10 hours to try to help
us get all our stuff together."
Englehardt said that Coach
Denny Green remained supportive
even though he had problems of
his own to deal with. "Coach
Green announced that if anybody
needed help he would be there to
sort out housing, even though he
had to sort out his personal sit
uation in Santa Cruz. Luckily, we
didn't have to rely on him too
much.
"I'd say, all in all, everybody
handled the whole situation pretty
well."
The future of the Delta Tau
Delta house at Stanford is very
much in doubt. The University is
considering tearing the old "house
on the hill" down. "That would
be too bad," said Englehardt. "It's
really a great place to live. I just
hope that we can get some alumni
support to keep the place going."
