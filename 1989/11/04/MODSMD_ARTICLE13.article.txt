# It hasn't been a banner year for the '80s' best team

There's no denying it Stan
ford has had a tough year. Expec
tations in 1989 were high for en
ergetic new Coach Denny Green
and the large number of returning
lettermen. The 1-7 mark the Car
dinal has posted so far leaves a
lot to be desired.
Coach Terry Donahue and the
UCLA Bruins have had a really
tough year.
The Bruins are 3-5, and while

that's nothing to write the AP
polls about, it isn't shamefully
bad, especially considering
UCLA's schedule. But contrasted
with the legacy the team must
live up to, and you see why
Donahue and quarterback Bret
Johnson are having trouble sleep
ing at night.
Put simply, UCLA has had the
most successful program in the
nation this decade. They have won
seven consecutive bowl games, in
cluding three Rose Bowls, and
have a .762 winning percentage

for the 1980s. The Bruins are
coming off back-to-back 10-win
seasons.
But for all their success, it
seems that Donahue and Co. have
overdrawn their 1980s victory ac
count. The season started off
badly with a 24-6 thrashing at
the hands of Tennessee. In their
third game, the Bruins played a
powerful Michigan team even, but
came away with a one-point loss.
After beating Pacific 10 Confer
ence doormats California and Ar
izona State to up their record to

3-2, Bruin fans and players took
heart. Then, all hell broke loose.
UCLA went in to Tucson to play
Arizona, and they found out just
how improved the Pac-10 is.
Arizona ran at will against the
porous UCLA defense, and at one
point the Wildcats led 42-0 in the
second half. Of small consolation
was the lone touchdown the
Bruins managed, extending their
NCAA record of scoring to 213
consecutive games. Donahue most
likely comforted himself with the
fact that Oregon State was next

on the schedule.
But the Beavers pulled off the
upset, and nipped the Bruins 18-
17 to drop them under .500 for
the first time since 1986. They
have not been below .500 this late
in the season in 10 years, when
they were 3-5 in the 1979 season.
But then Bruins returned home,
and figured to rebound against a
so-so Washington team. True to
form, UCLA jumped off to a quick
first-quarter lead of 21-0. But, as
the Huskies warmed up to the
Pasadena weather, the Bruins
could manage only six more points
on the day. When Greg Lewis
romped in from the 11-yard line
with 1:02 left in the game, UCLA
had lost its third consecutive
game, 28-27.
By now, most college football
fans are doing a reality check.
UCLA, which has won seven
straight bowl games (and these
were not cheesy bowls, mind you;
four were New Year's Day biggies)
would not be going to a bowl game
this year. UCLA, which has
finished in the Top 10 five of the
last seven years, will not be ending
this season anywhere near the
Top 25.
Stanford is 1-7, playing to end
the season on a good note. UCLA
