# Kemp's on guard for run at national title

Todd Kemp has come a long
way since his first season five
years ago as the goalie of the Stan
ford water polo team. The 6-foot-2
senior has been named an Ail-
American three times sandwiched
around a redshirt year and played
a part in the 1986 NCAA cham
pionship.
After a two-year drought, Kemp
has one simple objective. "I'd like
to finish up strong this season
with another NCAA champion
ship."
Kemp, who is from Clovis,
Calif., began his water polo career
in the Bth grade when a friend
suggested he give it a try. Ironi
cally, this same "friend" went on
to play water polo at California,
and last week scored two goals
against Kemp in Stanford's 10-8
loss.
Kemp, on the other hand, al
ways knew he wanted to play for
Stanford. "My high school coach
told me Stanford had a good team,
and it became a four-year goal of
mine to get on it." His efforts
paid off when he was actively
recruited for the goaltender's spot.
He remembers his first two sea
sons with the Cardinal as times
when he learned a lot from his
older teammates. "At first, I was
just trying to learn the system
and fit into it," he said. After this
adjustment period, however, he
feels that the team taught him
"how to get along with other
people and work as a group."
He also feels very fortunate to
have been part of a strong team
that allowed him to experience
NCAA championships his first
two years at Stanford. "Jeff
[Oeding, Kemp's teammate] and

I were able to ride the coattails
of great recruiting classes who
were juniors and seniors when I
was a freshman and sophomore."
Now, as an older player, the
roles have been reversed and
Kemp has taken on the role of
mentor. One of the things he en
joys most about the team is the
chance to see it grow collectively
as well as individually.
"It is really fascinating to see
the team change and watch dif
ferent personalities evolve," he
said. "I feel that I have seen it
from two different perspectives,
each of which has helped me

develop over the years."
Stanford Coach Dante Det
tamanti has said that Kemp has
proven himself to be one of the
top collegiate goalies in the na
tion. Despite the quality of his
play, however, he tries to shy away
from the attention he has been
receiving.
"I don't feel I deserve any spe
cial recognition," he said. "I just
go out and try to do my best."
His best seems to be good
enough, as the No. 4-ranked Car
dinal is virtually assured of a
NCAA berth. The remaining
games, however, are still impor

tant to reinforce the team's posi
tion before the tournament, he
said.
"We've been playing well defen
sively, but it's been more of a roller
coaster ride offensively.... It's
important that we do well against
teams we might meet in the tour
nament, like UCLA, so we can
establish ourselves."
The Cardinal meets the Bruins
today at deGuerre Pool at noon.
The season will be rounded out
with match-ups against the Uni
veristy of the Pacific and Califor
nia, and the NCAA tournament
will begin Nov. 24.
