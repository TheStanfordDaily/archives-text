# Brown not having Ball in the shadow of Green
## 
### Lora Dawn Headrick Staff writer 
Ask a classic sports-interview
question: "After coming off a win
ning season last year, you guys
were supposed to do well this fall.
But you're 3 and 5. What hap
pened?"
You get a classic sports
interview answer: "It's hard to
say.. . . We've lost a lot of key
players on defense; defensively
we're hurting a lot. On offense
we haven't seemed to find the
right combination we can't
seem to keep things going after
the first half."
Although that answer could be
used to explain why the Cardinal
is floundering this year, it was
offered by UCLA Bruin tailback
Brian Brown, as an explanation
for UCLA's unimpressive record.
After seven consecutive successful
seasons followed by bowl victories
under Coach Terry Donahue, the
Bruins have fallen on tough times.
Brown, a fourth-year junior, is
disappointed not only by his
team's record but by his own sta
tistics this season. "Statistically
speaking, I haven't had the year
at all that I anticipated having,"
Brown said. Last year Brown
rushed for 410 yards on 91
carries, compared with only 312
yards in 97 attempts so far this
season.
Brown expects more from him
self. A native of Carson, Calif., he
was a three-sport athlete at Gar
dena High School. He was an ex
cellent runner, placing third in
the 200 meters at the 1984 state
track meet.
This season Brown ranks
seventh in the Pac-10 in all
purpose yards per game (94), fifth
in kickoff returns (22.3), and 14th
in rushing (39.0). Statistics like
those might seem slightly better
than average, but to Brown they
represent a slump.
Brown feels his slump is caused
in part by Donahue's "platoon
style" backfield rotation. In the
process of searching for the right
offensive combination to produce
a win, Donahue has divided the
duties of the tailback among
Brown, sophomore Shawn Wills,
and redshirt freshman Kevin Wil
liams.

"It's hard to get anything going
(individually) with that kind of
relay system," said Brown.
Even if this season does prove
to be a disappointment for Brown,
he still has another year of
eligibility. Next year will be a
bonus of sorts for Brown, who did
not intend to redshirt during his
freshman year. However, after
playing in two early-season games
in 1986, he was sidelined with a
knee injury and granted a substi
tute year of eligibility. The fact
that he played was impressive,
however, considering the Bruins
had star tailbacks Gaston Green
and Eric Ball in the backfield.
In retrospect, Brown feels that
the extra year of eligibility will
benefit him now. "This year
hasn't been so great, and now I
have another year to improve and
see if I can catch the eyes of some
scouts."
That probably won't be too hard
to do. Although Brown can't name
his "highlight of the year" for this
season "I haven't really had
any" he has had some memo
rable moments at UCLA. "The
highlight of my career would have
to be the Arizona State game two
years ago," he said.
Brown came off the bench when
Green was injured during the first
quarter. "No one expected any
thing from me, because I was a
freshman," Brown remembered.
"But I came in and performed
well."
In addition to his speed, Brown
apparently has a gift for under
statement as well. During that
game he rushed for 134 yards on
19 carries, scored two touch
downs, and had a 74-yard run in
the fourth quarter.
Brown wouldn't mind having a
day like that against the Cardinal
this afternoon. But he feels the
two teams are pretty evenly
matched. "Stanford has had some
tough breaks just like us this
year," he said. "They've played
hard, they played Notre Dame
hard, and I'm pretty sure they're
going to be up for us."
Whatever happens today,
Brown is prepared. "I'm ready,"
he said. "I always try to stay ready
for the game. I try not to let our
record get me down 'cause, you
know, you must go on."

UCLA tailback Brian Brown has had an unenviable task in 1989 as
he has been asked to fill the shoes of two players Gaston Green

game he rushed for 134 yards on
19 carries, scored two touch
downs, and had a 74-yard run in
the fourth quarter.
Brown wouldn't mind having a
day like that against the Cardinal
this afternoon. But he feels the
two teams are pretty evenly
matched. "Stanford has had some
tough breaks just like us this
year," he said. "They've played
hard, they played Notre Dame
hard, and I'm pretty sure they're
going to be up for us."
Whatever happens today,
Brown is prepared. "I'm ready,"
he said. "I always try to stay ready
for the game. I try not to let our
record get me down 'cause, you
know, you must go on."

UCLA tailback Brian Brown has had an unenviable task in 1989 as
he has been asked to fill the shoes of two players Gaston Green
and Eric Ball who've gone on to the NFL.
Ask a classic sports-interview
question: "After coming off a win
ning season last year, you guys
were supposed to do well this fall.
But you're 3 and 5. What hap
pened?"
You get a classic sports
interview answer: "It's hard to
say.. . . We've lost a lot of key
players on defense; defensively
we're hurting a lot. On offense
we haven't seemed to find the
right combination we can't
seem to keep things going after
the first half."
Although that answer could be
used to explain why the Cardinal
is floundering this year, it was
offered by UCLA Bruin tailback
Brian Brown, as an explanation
for UCLA's unimpressive record.
After seven consecutive successful
seasons followed by bowl victories
under Coach Terry Donahue, the
Bruins have fallen on tough times.
Brown, a fourth-year junior, is
disappointed not only by his
team's record but by his own sta
tistics this season. "Statistically
speaking, I haven't had the year
at all that I anticipated having,"
Brown said. Last year Brown
rushed for 410 yards on 91
carries, compared with only 312
yards in 97 attempts so far this
season.
Brown expects more from him
self. A native of Carson, Calif., he
was a three-sport athlete at Gar
dena High School. He was an ex
cellent runner, placing third in
the 200 meters at the 1984 state
track meet.
This season Brown ranks
seventh in the Pac-10 in all
purpose yards per game (94), fifth
in kickoff returns (22.3), and 14th
in rushing (39.0). Statistics like
those might seem slightly better
than average, but to Brown they
represent a slump.
Brown feels his slump is caused
in part by Donahue's "platoon
style" backfield rotation. In the
process of searching for the right
offensive combination to produce
a win, Donahue has divided the
duties of the tailback among
Brown, sophomore Shawn Wills,
and redshirt freshman Kevin Wil
liams.

"It's hard to get anything going
(individually) with that kind of
relay system," said Brown.
Even if this season does prove
to be a disappointment for Brown,
he still has another year of
eligibility. Next year will be a
bonus of sorts for Brown, who did
not intend to redshirt during his
freshman year. However, after
playing in two early-season games
in 1986, he was sidelined with a
knee injury and granted a substi
tute year of eligibility. The fact
that he played was impressive,
however, considering the Bruins
had star tailbacks Gaston Green
and Eric Ball in the backfield.
In retrospect, Brown feels that
the extra year of eligibility will
benefit him now. "This year
hasn't been so great, and now I
have another year to improve and
see if I can catch the eyes of some
scouts."
That probably won't be too hard
to do. Although Brown can't name
his "highlight of the year" for this
season "I haven't really had
any" he has had some memo
rable moments at UCLA. "The
highlight of my career would have
to be the Arizona State game two
years ago," he said.
Brown came off the bench when
Green was injured during the first
quarter. "No one expected any
thing from me, because I was a
freshman," Brown remembered.
"But I came in and performed
well."
In addition to his speed, Brown
apparently has a gift for under
statement as well. During that
game he rushed for 134 yards on
19 carries, scored two touch
downs, and had a 74-yard run in
the fourth quarter.
Brown wouldn't mind having a
day like that against the Cardinal
this afternoon. But he feels the
two teams are pretty evenly
matched. "Stanford has had some
tough breaks just like us this
year," he said. "They've played
hard, they played Notre Dame
hard, and I'm pretty sure they're
going to be up for us."

he said. "I always try to stay ready
for the game. I try not to let our
record get me down 'cause, you
know, you must go on."
