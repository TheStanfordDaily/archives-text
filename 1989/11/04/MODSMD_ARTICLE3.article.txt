## Bruins, Cardinal clash as both squads try to put one in the W column 
### Mark Rogowsky Editorial staff 
UCLA is not a very courteous
guest at Stanford Stadium. In the
Bruins' last three visits, they won
by 18, 25 and 49 points. The 1987
shellacking was not only a
shutout but it also sent quarter
back Scott Stark packing.
Stark's one and only collegiate
start ended as Stanford's worst
loss of the decade. At season's end,
Stark transferred to Saddleback
Junior College.
Oh how the mighty have fallen!
To say the Bruins are struggling
this season would be to tho
roughly understate the case. Lim
ping along at 3-5, UCLA is a
second-division team in the
Pacific 10 Conference for the first
time in a long while.
The Bruin woes, though, are
nothing but good news for Stan
ford. The Cardinal needs a win
against somebody anybody
and the Hollywooders are ripe for
the picking.
After losing Troy Aikman to the
NFL, the Bruins gave the starting
quarterback job to redshirt fresh
man Bret Johnson. In the early
going, Johnson sizzled; lately he's
fizzled.
The low point of his season
came two weeks ago against
Oregon State. Johnson was a dis
mal 4 of 15 before being pulled
in favor of Jim Bonds. Last week,

he rebounded somewhat against
Washington, throwing for 217
yards on 18-of-27 passing.
On the Stanford side of the ball,
the endless quarterback shuffle
continues as another Johnson
Brian re-takes the helm for
the umpteenth time. B.J. replaces
Stanford's redshirt freshman,
Steve Smith, who has been erratic
in his first season as the Cardi
nal's signal caller.
Johnson is coming off a pair of
injuries, one to his shoulder and
the other to his knee, and both
his running and throwing ability
may not be 100 percent. But he
says he's ready to go, and, as the
team's emotional leader, should
put a charge into the Cardinal.
An even bigger boost may be
provided by the return of two
others: Jon Volpe and Rob
Hinckley. Volpe, who has missed
the past six games with a knee
injury, got in some practice and
could see time today.
He is being asked to boost a
Stanford running game that has
averaged only 2.1 yards per carry
on the season. Last week, the Car
dinal managed minus-6 yards
rushing against a tough USC de
fense.
The Bruins, however, while
adept at covering the pass (they
lead the Pac-10 in that defensive
category) are not nearly as good
at defending the run. Stanford
will look to exploit that relative

weakness today.
Incidentally, if Volpe plays it
will be at fullback not halfback.
Galen Foster, whose performance
against Utah was the best by a
Stanford rusher this season, will
start at halfback.
When the Cardinal does put the
ball in the air it will probably be
headed for Ed McCaffrey. One of
the few bright spots on the squad
this season, McCaffrey leads the
team with 40 receptions and a
17.6 yards-per-catch average. The
passing game will also benefit
from the return of Jim Price, who
did not travel to USC last week
end.
Hinckley actually returned
from his back injury for the game
with the Trojans. The erstwhile
All-America candidate made
lunchmeat out of Aikman in last
season's game recording 4Vfe
sacks.
The physical play this past Sat
urday saw Stanford use 26 differ
ent defenders. It seems unlikely
the Cardinal will need quite as
many today.
The Bruins' offensive attack is
not as impressive as in years past.
Though UCLA has three backs
with 300-plus yards rushing

Shawn Wills, Brian Brown and
Kevin Williams none is averag
ing more than 4.5 yards per carry.
No Bruin receiver really stands
out, either. Mike Farr has 24
catches and a 16.1-yard average
to lead the pack. Scott Miller with
18 receptions at a 14.2 yard-per
catch average and tight end
Charles Arbuckle (17, 7.9) are the
other notables.
Basically, today's contest should
come down to a test of wills. The
Bruins are facing a losing season
if they don't capture their three
remaining games. The Cardinal
faces the heinous prospect of a
1-10 campaign under new Coach
Denny Green if they don't win at
least once.
In a game that should be close,
special teams may be the deciding
factor. And, each team has par
ticular strengths in this area.
Stanford has benefited from the
kickoff returns of Alan Grant and
Kevin Scott. Grant has a 25.9-
yard average and is among the
nation's leaders. Scott's 21.8-yard
average is actually deceptively low
as he has returned a number of
squib kicks this year. Either of
them can break one long.
Placekicker John Hopkins is

once again struggling. Hopkins
has missed his last three attempts
after making eight straight.
Punter Paul Stonehouse is coming
on somewhat, but is still erratic.
His season average is up to 37.6,
hardly a world-beating figure but
a major improvement nonetheless.
The Bruins' kicking game is top
notch. Kirk Maggio is the second
leading punter in the land. His
average of 46.3 is stellar as is his
long of 72. The kicking chores are
handled by Alf Velasco, one of the
country's best.
Velasco had his extraordinary
streak of not missing from inside
40 yards broken last week against
the Huskies. Still, he has con
verted 48 of 59 career field goal
attempts for an .816 percentage.
UCLA's punt returns probably
rank near the bottom of Division
I-A. Wills has five returns for a
total of 13 yards 2.6 each try.
Farr has seven for a mere 12 yards
can you say 1.7.
Despite riding losing streaks of
three and five games respectively,
UCLA and Stanford always get
up to play one another. For that
reason (and perhaps for no other),
look for a hard-fought contest on
the field today.

Scott Eschelman and his Cardinal teammates have scarcely seeen the opposition's end zone this
season. Against UCLA's suspect run defense and aided by the return of Jon Volpe, Stanford is
looking to turn that around today.

after making eight straight.
Punter Paul Stonehouse is coming
on somewhat, but is still erratic.
His season average is up to 37.6,
hardly a world-beating figure but
a major improvement nonetheless.
The Bruins' kicking game is top
notch. Kirk Maggio is the second
leading punter in the land. His
average of 46.3 is stellar as is his
long of 72. The kicking chores are
handled by Alf Velasco, one of the
country's best.
Velasco had his extraordinary
streak of not missing from inside
40 yards broken last week against
the Huskies. Still, he has con
verted 48 of 59 career field goal
attempts for an .816 percentage.
UCLA's punt returns probably
rank near the bottom of Division
I-A. Wills has five returns for a
total of 13 yards 2.6 each try.
Farr has seven for a mere 12 yards
can you say 1.7.
Despite riding losing streaks of
three and five games respectively,
UCLA and Stanford always get
up to play one another. For that
reason (and perhaps for no other),
look for a hard-fought contest on
the field today.


Damian Marhefka - Daily file
Scott Eschelman and his Cardinal teammates have scarcely seeen the opposition's end zone this
season. Against UCLA's suspect run defense and aided by the return of Jon Volpe, Stanford is
looking to turn that around today.
UCLA is not a very courteous
guest at Stanford Stadium. In the
Bruins' last three visits, they won
by 18, 25 and 49 points. The 1987
shellacking was not only a
shutout but it also sent quarter
back Scott Stark packing.
Stark's one and only collegiate
start ended as Stanford's worst
loss of the decade. At season's end,
Stark transferred to Saddleback
Junior College.
Oh how the mighty have fallen!
To say the Bruins are struggling
this season would be to tho
roughly understate the case. Lim
ping along at 3-5, UCLA is a
second-division team in the
Pacific 10 Conference for the first
time in a long while.
The Bruin woes, though, are
nothing but good news for Stan
ford. The Cardinal needs a win
against somebody anybody
and the Hollywooders are ripe for
the picking.
After losing Troy Aikman to the
NFL, the Bruins gave the starting
quarterback job to redshirt fresh
man Bret Johnson. In the early
going, Johnson sizzled; lately he's
fizzled.
The low point of his season
came two weeks ago against
Oregon State. Johnson was a dis
mal 4 of 15 before being pulled
in favor of Jim Bonds. Last week,

he rebounded somewhat against
Washington, throwing for 217
yards on 18-of-27 passing.
On the Stanford side of the ball,
the endless quarterback shuffle
continues as another Johnson
Brian re-takes the helm for
the umpteenth time. B.J. replaces
Stanford's redshirt freshman,
Steve Smith, who has been erratic
in his first season as the Cardi
nal's signal caller.
Johnson is coming off a pair of
injuries, one to his shoulder and
the other to his knee, and both
his running and throwing ability
may not be 100 percent. But he
says he's ready to go, and, as the
team's emotional leader, should
put a charge into the Cardinal.
An even bigger boost may be
provided by the return of two
others: Jon Volpe and Rob
Hinckley. Volpe, who has missed
the past six games with a knee
injury, got in some practice and
could see time today.
He is being asked to boost a
Stanford running game that has
averaged only 2.1 yards per carry
on the season. Last week, the Car
dinal managed minus-6 yards
rushing against a tough USC de
fense.
The Bruins, however, while
adept at covering the pass (they
lead the Pac-10 in that defensive
category) are not nearly as good
at defending the run. Stanford
will look to exploit that relative

weakness today.
Incidentally, if Volpe plays it
will be at fullback not halfback.
Galen Foster, whose performance
against Utah was the best by a
Stanford rusher this season, will
start at halfback.
When the Cardinal does put the
ball in the air it will probably be
headed for Ed McCaffrey. One of
the few bright spots on the squad
this season, McCaffrey leads the
team with 40 receptions and a
17.6 yards-per-catch average. The
passing game will also benefit
from the return of Jim Price, who
did not travel to USC last week
end.
Hinckley actually returned
from his back injury for the game
with the Trojans. The erstwhile
All-America candidate made
lunchmeat out of Aikman in last
season's game recording 4Vfe
sacks.
The physical play this past Sat
urday saw Stanford use 26 differ
ent defenders. It seems unlikely
the Cardinal will need quite as
many today.
The Bruins' offensive attack is
not as impressive as in years past.
Though UCLA has three backs
with 300-plus yards rushing

Shawn Wills, Brian Brown and
Kevin Williams none is averag
ing more than 4.5 yards per carry.
No Bruin receiver really stands
out, either. Mike Farr has 24
catches and a 16.1-yard average
to lead the pack. Scott Miller with
18 receptions at a 14.2 yard-per
catch average and tight end
Charles Arbuckle (17, 7.9) are the
other notables.
Basically, today's contest should
come down to a test of wills. The
Bruins are facing a losing season
if they don't capture their three
remaining games. The Cardinal
faces the heinous prospect of a
1-10 campaign under new Coach
Denny Green if they don't win at
least once.
In a game that should be close,
special teams may be the deciding
factor. And, each team has par
ticular strengths in this area.
Stanford has benefited from the
kickoff returns of Alan Grant and
Kevin Scott. Grant has a 25.9-
yard average and is among the
nation's leaders. Scott's 21.8-yard
average is actually deceptively low
as he has returned a number of
squib kicks this year. Either of
them can break one long.
Placekicker John Hopkins is

once again struggling. Hopkins
has missed his last three attempts
after making eight straight.
Punter Paul Stonehouse is coming
on somewhat, but is still erratic.
His season average is up to 37.6,
hardly a world-beating figure but
a major improvement nonetheless.
