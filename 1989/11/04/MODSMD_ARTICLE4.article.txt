# Chalk Talk â€“ Halfback off left tackle
## 
### 

The key to today's game, quite simply, will be Stanford's ground attack. The
Cardinal has suffered injuries to many running backs this season and, as a result,
the team is last in the Pac-10 in rushing offense. The Bruin defense is statistically
the worst against the run that the league has to offer, however, so someone will
have to blink. Today in Chalk-Talk we have one of Stanford's favorite running

from center and turns to his left. Fullback Tom Vardell (44) goes by as the lead
blocker and tailback Galen Foster (32) takes the handoff and follows him. Right
guard Andy Papathanassiou (56) pulls out and combines with Vardell to take out
the two middle linebackers, Stacy Argo (41) and Craig Davis (54). Meanwhile
center Rick Pallow (54), left guard Chuck Gillingham (62) and left tackle Bob
Whitfield (70) seal off the left side of the line. Foster bursts through the hole.
