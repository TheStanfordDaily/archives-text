UCLA

Stanford

Johnson is expected to return
to the starting lineup today after
missing two games with shoulder
and knee injuries. The first thing
Johnson will see when he gets
behind center is Patton, the
Bruins' outside linebacker. Patton
leads the team in sacks with eight
in eight games and has a total of
15 tackles for loss. Stanford quar
terbacks suffered seven sacks last
week to bring the total to 38 on
the year, and, to add injury to
insult, Johnson's bruised knee
will likely slow his scrambling
today.

Like the Cardinal, UCLA has
started a redshirt freshman at
quarterback most of the season.
And, like Stanford, the position
has been plagued with inconsis
tent play. Against Cal, Johnson
was 14-of-18 with three touch
downs, but two weeks ago he was
4-of-15. He is coming off a good
game against Washington last
week, but will have to contend
with the Cardinal's new free
safety. Scott, a long-time starter
at cornerback, was moved to free
safety three weeks ago and has
played well.

The Cardinal's defense this
season has been against the run
but that will be severely tested
this week. While the Bruins have
no backs putting up All-America
numbers, three different tailbacks
have each rushed for more than
300 yards this season. A big part
of a successful ground game is a
good offensive line and the UCLA
line is anchored by center Cornish.
Cornish will be going against red
shirt freshman Rembisz. If the
Cardinal is going to stop the run,
Rembisz needs to hold his own in
the trenches.

The most interesting aspect of
today's game, and perhaps the
most telling, will be how the Car
dinal ground game matches up
against the Bruin defense. Stan
ford is dead last in the Pac-10 in
running the football, but UCLA
is last in stopping the run. A key
for the Cardinal is the expected
return of fullback Volpe. Despite
having only played in two games,
Volpe is still Stanford's second
leading rusher. Looking to stop
him is Davis, the Bruins' leading
tackier. He already has 105 stops
in eight games and has caused
four fumbles.

UCLA has tried to run a
balanced offense this season, and
despite quarterbacking inconsis
tencies, the team has done that.
A big part of both the run and
the pass is Arbuckle. At 6-2, 238,
he is a big blocker and a hard
man to bring down after he makes
the catch. Englehardt will usually
end up in Arbuckle's vicinity and
how he deals with him, and the
Bruins' two other massive tight
ends (Corwin Anthony at 6-2, 234;
and Randy Austin at 6-3, 249).
will go a long way toward deter
mining the Bruins' offensive suc
cess.

In games between two relatively
equal teams, field position is often
a very important factor. The pre
liminary indication would give the
advantage to UCLA, on the basis
of Maggio. Maggio, a senior, is
averaging 46.33 yards per punt,
good enough to leave him second
in the nation. On the other side
of the field, Stanford will send
out a freshman, Paul Stonehouse,
to handle the punting duties.
Stonehouse took over the job in
the third game of the season and
has improved steadily since then,
but his average is still only 37.6.

for the Cardinal is the expected
return of fullback Volpe. Despite
having only played in two games,
Volpe is still Stanford's second
leading rusher. Looking to stop
him is Davis, the Bruins' leading
tackier. He already has 105 stops
in eight games and has caused
four fumbles.

UCLA has tried to run a
balanced offense this season, and
despite quarterbacking inconsis
tencies, the team has done that.
A big part of both the run and
the pass is Arbuckle. At 6-2, 238,
he is a big blocker and a hard
man to bring down after he makes
the catch. Englehardt will usually
end up in Arbuckle's vicinity and
how he deals with him, and the
Bruins' two other massive tight
ends (Corwin Anthony at 6-2, 234;
and Randy Austin at 6-3, 249).
will go a long way toward deter
mining the Bruins' offensive suc
cess.

In games between two relatively
equal teams, field position is often
a very important factor. The pre
liminary indication would give the
advantage to UCLA, on the basis
of Maggio. Maggio, a senior, is
averaging 46.33 yards per punt,
good enough to leave him second
in the nation. On the other side
of the field, Stanford will send
out a freshman, Paul Stonehouse,
to handle the punting duties.
Stonehouse took over the job in
the third game of the season and
has improved steadily since then,
but his average is still only 37.6.
