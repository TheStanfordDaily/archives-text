lOMEGA Corporation, founded in 1980, develops, manufac
tures and sells the Bernoulli Box family of high-performance
removable mass storage products for desktop computers. The
products take advantage of lOMEGA'S patented Bernoulli Tech
nology, which combines the high performance associated with
rigid drives with the unlimited data storage capacity of removable
disks. Bernoulli disks are rugged, easily transportable and can
store as much as 44 megabytes of data per disk.
Bernoulli Box products are currently used in virtually every
branch of the U.S. government and military, as well as at major
commercial banks, brokerage firms, large manufacturing organi
zations and other large and small businesses that need to store
large quantities of valuable data. lOMEGA'S products are distrib
uted through the computer retail channel and select OEM's.
lOMEGA'S newest generation of Bernoulli products, the Ber
noulli Box II 44. began shipping in March 1989. The Bernoulli Box
II 44 drive boasts an effective access time of 22 milliseconds, per
formance comparable to that of fixed hard disks, and uses the
latest magnetic media technology to provide up to 44 megabytes
of storage on each removable Bernoulli disk. The Bernoulli Box II
44 can be used with Apple Macintosh computers, IBM PCs and
compatibles and the IBM Personal Systems/2.
