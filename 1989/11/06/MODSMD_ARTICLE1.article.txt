Chris Elsenberg â€” Dally
A memorial
"My art says that all this is a transition period. All this is temporary," says Jim Lasalandra of
El Paso, Texas. Having lived in the Bay Area for a number of years before moving to El Paso,
news of the earthquake had him a bit shook up. He returned to Oakland last week to draw a
memorial to the 38 people who died under the Cypress Expressway.
