Not much for Stanford in election
Although elections for a variety of local and
county offices will take place tomorrow, residents
of the Stanford campus will only have the option
of voting for the governing board of the Foothill-
De Anza Community College District.
In the election, three people are running for
two open seats. Of these three, Mary Wallace
Wheat and A 1 Chasuk are incumbents. The chal
lenger is Tom Ferri.
Registered Stanford residents can vote at one
of several locations on campus tomorrow. Polling
places will be open at Wilbur Hall, Terra House,
the El Centro Chicano lounge, Kairos House and
the Nixon School at 1711 Stanford Ave.

Green Library West stays closed
The West Wing of Green Library remains closed
as a result of the Oct. 17 earthquake, though
contractors are working to make most of the
first floor safe for interim reoccupancy.
• The Jonsson Government Documents Library
will remain closed until Nov. 13 at the earliest.
Until then, limited reference and referral services
are being provided at the Information Desk in
Green's East Wing.
• Staff members of the Department of Special
Collections are working to restore services to its
patrons. Responses to telephone and written ref
erence requests will resume as soon as the staff
regains access to Special Collections materials,
possibly by the end of November.
Researchers will be able to personally consult

Special Collections materials in the Jonsson Li
brary on a limited basis soon after that library's
reopening later this month.
In winter quarter, the department hopes to
resume its class presentations and demonstra
tions of the collections. Exhibitions and public
programs will resume once space for them is
found.
• General collections housed on the sixth and
seventh floors of the West Wing stacks should
be accessible within a few weeks.
• The Field Room, the Lurie Rotunda, the
Bender Room, the Timothy Hopkins Room and
adjacent areas will be closed for many months.
Until architectural and engineering studies are
completed and funding is in sight, it is unclear
when the second and higher floors of the West
Wing will be accessible even on an interim basis.
Italians discuss joint projects
A group of Italian dignitaries visited the Uni
versity Friday for talks on cooperative research
projects with Stanford professors.
Antonio Ruberti, the Italian Minister of Scien
tific and Technological Research, met with Uni
versity President Donald Kennedy, Vice Provost
for Academic Planning John Wirth and Dean of
Research Robert Byer.
For the last two years, Stanford and the Italian
government have been pursuing the development
of joint research projects. Stanford officials have
proposed six projects to be investigated, in areas
from philosophy and symbolic systems to physics.
The talks Friday focused on the mechanics of
the joint projects and the University's organiza
tion and policies on research, Byer said. The
projects are expected to be approved and under
taken early next year.
