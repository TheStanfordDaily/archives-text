# For the record

A headline in Thursday's Daily
mistakenly implied that athletes
are given aid based only on finan
cial need. Sports scholarships are
awarded for athletic merit only.
The money, raised from private
donations, is distributed by
coaches independent of the Uni
versity. Athletes who do not
receive athletic scholarships but
need financial assistance are eli
gible for financial aid from the
University.
