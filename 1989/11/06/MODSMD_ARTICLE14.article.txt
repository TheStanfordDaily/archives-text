## German Politburo asked to resign 
### 
BERLIN (AP) — An East German
Cabinet minister yesterday called for
the resignation of the Communist
Party's ruling Politburo. Another min
ister announced that East Germans will
be allowed to travel in the West for 30
days a year under a new law.
The state-run news agency ADN
quoted Culture Minister Hans-Joachim
Hoffmann as saying: "We need as
quickly as possible a new government."
He said the entire Politburo should
jointly resign "to give the new general
secretary a real chance," ADN reported.
The general secretary is Egon Krenz,
leader of the Communist Party who took
over Oct. 18 after Erich Honecker was
ousted. Krenz said Friday that five el
derly members of the 21-member Polit
buro will step down soon.
Two Poliburo members already have
been ousted, in the shake-up that ended
Honecker's rule. They were closely as
sociated with the former leader's strict
18-year rule.
Hoffmann also called for the 42-
member Cabinet to be streamlined. He

made his comments during a meeting
with citizens in the city of Leipzig, which
has been the site of major pro
democracy demonstrations in recent
weeks.
ADN said tens of thousands of citizens
took part in similar meetings around
the country between officials and
citizens.
The talks were initiated last week by
Krenz as part of his effort to stop an
exodus of East Germans to the West.
Most of those leaving have cited dis
satisfaction with the hard-line govern
ment here and the lack of freedom to
travel out of the country.
Interior Minister Friedrich Dickel,
speaking on state-run television news,
said a new travel law will allow all East
German citizens to receive passports to
travel to the West for up to 30 days a
year.
Dickel said he expected the law would
be go into force by the end of the year.
He said the draft law would be published
in the media Monday.
"We want to give the possibility to

all citizens to travel wherever they want
without any restrictions," Dickel said.
He said passport applications would
be handled in 30 days, with urgent cases
settled in three days or less.
Dickel said applications for emigra
tion would be processed within three
to six months and indicated that illegal
stays in the West would be
decriminalized.
East Germany now strictly regulates
the number of people who can visit the
West and makes it extremely difficult
for those without relatives in the West
to obtain permission.
Despite the ouster of Honecker and
signs that Krenz is open to reform, thou
sands of East Germans continued to
flee their country Yesterday, taking ad
vantage of the opportunity to pass freely
through neighboring Czechoslovakia en
route to West Germany, where they
receive automatic citizenship.
West German border officials said at
least 15,000 East Germans had arrived
in West Germany between Friday and
Yesterday.
