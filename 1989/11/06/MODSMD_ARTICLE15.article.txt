KLEIAT, Lebanon (AP) â€” Lebanese
lawmakers elected a new Christian pres
ident yesterday and approved a peace
plan designed to end 14 years of civil
war, despite threats by a Christian gen
eral to punish them for "conspiracy."
The legislators elected Deputy Rene
Mouawad, a 32-year veteran of
Lebanese politics and a 64-year-old
Maronite Christian, to be president.
They first stripped the presidency of
some power, giving more authority to
Moslems who would fill other top gov
ernment posts.
Fifty-eight of Parliament's 73 surviv
ing lawmakers attended the special ses
sion in this northern town, which is
under Syrian security. On the second
ballot 52 voted for Mouawad and six
abstained.
Lebanon has had no president since
Sept. 22, 1988, when President Amin
Gemayel's six-year term expired with
Parliament unable to decide on a suc
cessor.

The legislators also re-elected Parlia
ment Speaker Hussein Husseini, a
Shiite Moslem, for a one-year term. He
has held the post since October 1984.
Christian leader Gen. Michel Aoun,
whom Gemayel appointed to head an
interim Cabinet until a new president
could be named, rejected Mouawad's
election.
"What happened in Kleiat is an un
constitutional act and is null and void,"
Aoun said in a statement issued from
his command bunker at the presidential
palace in Beirut's suburb of Baabda.
"We are determined to thwart the
conspiracy which is being hatched to
eliminate what is left of Lebanon's
sovereignty and territorial integrity," he
said.
Aoun rejected the Arab League
brokered peace plan, first approved by
the lawmakers at a session last month
in Saudi Arabia, because it failed to
guarantee a withdrawal of the 40,000

Syrian troops who control much of
Lebanon.
He considers the Syrians an occupy
ing army and fought them for six
months until a Sept. 22 cease-fire called
by the Arab League. Police say 930
people were killed and 2,744 wounded,
most of them civilians.
The general declared Saturday that
he had dissolved Parliament. Most leg
islators declared his move illegal, noting
that under Lebanon's constitution, only
the president can dissolve Parliament.
Syria was the first foreign country
to react to the election of Mouawad,
whose first priority is to form a national
reconciliation government to end the
civil war.
An official source in Damascus, Syria,
quoted President Hafez Assad as saying:
"I am most glad to address to you my
hearty congratulations. ... What was
achieved today is a great accomplish
ment on the way to end Lebanon's long
ordeal."
