# Greek voters elect slim majority

ATHENS, Greece (AP) - The
conservative New Democracy
Party led in national elections yes
terday but narrowly missed a par
liamentary majority, throwing
Greece into its second period of
political uncertainty in five
months.
With 96.2 percent of the votes
counted, New Democracy, led by
Constantine Mitsotakis, had 46.3
percent. It was followed by former
Premier Andreas Papandreou's
Panhellenic Socialist Movement
with 40.7 percent and the Coali
tion of the Left and Progress,
headed by Communist Harilaos
Florakis, with 10.8 percent. The
rest went to small parties. Official
returns were broadcast by state
television.
New Democracy needed 151
seats in the 300-seat single
chamber Parliament to control the
government after eight years of
socialist rule and a brief coalition
administration.
Government projections showed
New Democracy with 148 seats,
128 seats going to the socialists
and 21 to the leftist Coalition.
The other three seats would go
to independents, including one en
vironmentalist.
A tough period of bargaining
was expected to begin shortly on
forming a new government. The
leading parties are widely divided
over such issues as eco
nomic policy and the presence of
U.S. military bases in Greece.

Mitsotakis told a news confer
ence his party would "act in a
way that is best for the nation"
but did not spell out his plans for
working out a coalition. "Without
a doubt our political life is enter
ing a difficult phase," he said.
Papandreou said, "It gives us
special satisfaction that after the
June elections we have had such
a significant rise ... despite the
unbelievable barrage of attacks
made against us and despite the
fact that we were out of the gov
ernment."
Papandreou's party did not ap
pear to be damaged by its leader's
indictment on corruption charges
in September.
Polls were open from sunrise
to sunset, with voting compulsory
for the estimated 8 million
citizens aged 18 and over. Final
results were unlikely before Mon
day afternoon.
In Athens, motorists waving
green socialist party banners or
blue-and-white New Democracy
flags sped through the central
Syntagma Square, leaning on
their horns.
Although a national election
June 18 produced no mtyority, the
Coalition of the Left and Progress
agreed to team with its enemies,
the conservatives, in a short-term
government dedicated only to in
vestigating scandals that dogged
the final years of the 1981-89
socialist administration.
The coalition government

resigned last month after indict
ing Papandreou on charges of in
volvement in a multimillion-dollar
banking scandal and of ordering
wiretapping of the telephones of
friends and foes.
Papandreou has said he is in
nocent and maintains the indict
ments were politically motivated.
The leader of the Communist
led coalition, Florakis, said: "It is
an undisputed fact that the coa
lition will be at the center of post
electoral developments in our
country."
Florakis' group wants to evict
U.S. bases from Greece and op
poses extraditing a Palestinian
suspected of terrorism, Moham
med Rashid, to the United States.
Mitsotakis, 71, campaigned on
promises to cut the government's
heavy role in the economy and
str3ngthen ties with NATO and
the United States. He accused the
former government of ruining the
economy, citing a $58 billion
public debt.
Papandreou, 70, promised to
boost pensions and other benefits
if elected and to hold a public
referendum before approving any
new base treaty with the United
States.
Greece's simple proportional
system makes it difficult for par
ties to gain an overall majority.
In June, New Democracy won 145
seats; the socialists got 125 seats;
the Coalition got 28 seats and two
went to independents.
