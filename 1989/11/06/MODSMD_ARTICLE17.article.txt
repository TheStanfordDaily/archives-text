Soviet forces reduced
MOSCOW (AP) — The Soviet military was cut
by 235,500 soldiers this year, and more than
7,000 tanks and 700 airplanes were withdrawn
from Europe under a plan by President Mikhail
S. Gorbachev, the Communist Party newspaper
Pravda said yesterday.
"The attack capability of Warsaw Pact forces
in Central Europe has diminished," reported
Pravda.
Gorbachev in December announced the Soviet
Union would within two years cut its military
forces by 500,000 soldiers.
He also has announced plans to cut Soviet
forces in Europe to move toward an agreement
between the Warsaw Pact and North Atlantic
Treaty Organization on conventional weapons.
But Western experts say the Soviets and their
allies in Eastern Europe still have an overwhelm
ing superiority of many types of weapons in
Europe.
Gavernment slips on cheap water
WASHINGTON (AP) — The government has
cheated itself out of millions of dollars by misin
terpreting legislation that specifies who uses
federally subsidized water, according to a federal
report scheduled for release today.
The misinterpretation has proved the biggest
benefit to California farmers, according to the
law's author, Rep. George Miller, D-Calif.
"Wealthy farmers in California's Central Valley
have subverted the intent of federal water laws,
and top Interior Department officials aware of
the abuse declined to take corrective action," said
Miller.

The report, from the General Accounting Of
fice, advises Congress to close loopholes in the
law — the Reclamation Reform Act of 1982 —
that it says farmers in California and other states
have taken advantage of.
Miller said he rewrote the law in 1982 govern
ing the cost of federal water to Western farmers
so that large farms would receive a limited
amount of cheap, federally subsidized water.
Only farms of 960 acres or less were eligible.
But owners of large farms got around the law
by reorganizing into 960-acre tracts that qualified
for the subsidies.
He said the U.S. Interior Department's inter
pretation of the law allowed for the tract reor
ganization.
Civil rights memorial unveiled
MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) — A generation
after Medgar Evers and Martin Luther King were
killed, the nation's first memorial to martyrs of
the civil rights movement was unveiled yesterday
as relatives expressed hope that young people
will carry on the spirit of that turbulent era.
Several people cried as they touched the cool
water that flows across a circular black granite
slab engraved with important events of the era,
including the names of 40 people who died in
the struggle for racial equality.
"I hope this will vitalize the struggle, keep it
fresh in the minds ... for the youth," said Ollie
Gordon, a Chicago schoolteacher whose cousin,
14-year-old Emmett Till, was shot to death in
1955 by whites angered that he had spoken to
a white woman.
