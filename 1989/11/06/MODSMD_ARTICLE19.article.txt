## Unworkable options 
### 
Tresidder management
is not respecting the
dignity of its employees

WHY ARE WORKERS al
ways the first to get cut?
Because of its budget
deficit, Tresidder Union manage
ment announced last week that it
was trying to reduce its 10-member
custodial staff.
Some administrative and clerical
positions have already been
reduced because of budget con
straints, but the manner in which
Tresidder management is proceed
ing is inappropriate.
Tresidder custodial workers
were given three options: retire,
transfer to another University po
sition or risk being laid off.
That seems reasonable on the
surface, since the budget problems
are a real concern. But is Tresidder
management really making a good
faith effort to respect its employ
ees, some of whom have worked
there for several years?
A closer look at the workers' op
tions seems to indicate that the
answer to that question is no.
Tresidder management has pro
posed changing the hours of those
who choose to stay to nighttime
hours. The new work schedule
would be 11:30 p.m. to 8 a.m.
It is commendable that manage
ment has tried to find options for
their employees, but many of these
options are unworkable for the em
ployees.
By changing the work schedule,
Tresidder management makes it
extremely difficult or impossible
for workers, some who do not
drive, to get to and from work.
Not only does the new work
schedule inconvenience workers, it
seems illogical. Why have workers

clean up Tresidder at night when
no one is there instead of during
the day when messes are made? If
Tresidder is only cleaned at night,
it will look beautiful for the early
birds, but by noon and especially
dinner, it will look like a pig-sty.
Another problem is retirement.
Jos6 Oropeza, an 87-year-old man
who has worked at Tresidder for
24 years, would receive $38 a
month upon retirement. With So
cial Security, that amounts to
about $7,200 a year.
This is a problem not only for
this case but as a general policy.
Jose cannot retire now or at any
other time because of the poor pen
sion plan, so even after 24 years
of service to Tresidder and 60 years
in the labor force he must continue
to work.
The last option was to transfer
to another department. While this
is by far the best of the alternatives
given to the workers, it neglects
the fact that they care about the
job they do and want to continue
to do that job.
In other cases, however, workers
have not had any alternatives. At
least one of the clerical workers,
Victoria Burnell, was offered either
reduction to part-time or no job at
all.
Other options must be explored.
Tresidder needs to take some time
to find more alternatives for these
workers.
In addition, a harder look must
be taken at management cuts. One
management position was cut and
expense accounts cut down, but in
these times of budgetary troubles
management and workers should
share the burden.
A number of lives have been up
set by these cuts. Instead of
presenting unfeasible alternatives,
Tresidder should sit down and
work out some solutions that both
management and workers can
agree on. The solution, as it stands
now, is no solution.
