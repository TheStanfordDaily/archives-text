# Committee commotion
## Administration hopes to simplify structure 
### Ed Palattella Staff writer 
Committees, committees and
more committees — when Uni
versity administrators want to get
something done, one committee
is often set up to plan the project
and another to implement it.
The logic is simple: Nine minds
can do more than one.
But a large committee structure
needs a Committee on Commit
tees to prevent overlap and place
people on the committees. And
now, when the University wants
to streamline the administration
— including the committee sys
tem, another committee is needed
to decide where the changes
should take place.
The complex bureaucracy
created by the entire system is
something the University's Action
Plans for Change project — which
Provost James Rosse introduced
to the Faculty Senate Oct. 26 —

hopes to control.
Besides simplifying the commit
tee structure, the project aims to
strengthen other parts of the Uni
versity management system.
Rosse said the project was organ
ized partly in response to this
year's $2 million budget deficit,
Stanford's first since the early
19705.
A six-member steering commit
tee heads Action Plans for Change
and will issue a report in 18
months.
When the report arrives, it will
most likely affect the future num
ber of administrative committees
at Stanford, Rosse said Friday.
"One would hope that the proj
ect would reduce the number of
committees and also make them
more efficient," said Rosse, a
member of the the steering com
mittee. "Some committees now
are doing more than they have
to."

The committee structure
There are 42 committees within
the University, not including six
other special administrative
panels and 10 councils or boards.
Of the 42 committees, seven are
committees of the Academic
Council. According to the Senate
and Committee Handbook, these
committees "formulate policy on
all matters related to teaching and
research, the central functions of
the University." The Committee
on Libraries, for example, fits this
category.
A group of five other commit
tees is known as University Com
mittees, which "deal largely with
matters related to those activities
that support the teaching and
scholarly work of the University,"
according to the handbook. The
Committee on Parking and Trans
portation is one example.
