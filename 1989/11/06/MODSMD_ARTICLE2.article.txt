# Committee commotion
## Administration hopes to simplify structure 
### Ed Palattella Staff writer 
Committees, committees and
more committees — when Uni
versity administrators want to get
something done, one committee
is often set up to plan the project
and another to implement it.
The logic is simple: Nine minds
can do more than one.
But a large committee structure
needs a Committee on Commit
tees to prevent overlap and place
people on the committees. And
now, when the University wants
to streamline the administration
— including the committee sys
tem, another committee is needed
to decide where the changes
should take place.
The complex bureaucracy
created by the entire system is
something the University's Action
Plans for Change project — which
Provost James Rosse introduced
to the Faculty Senate Oct. 26 —

hopes to control.
Besides simplifying the commit
tee structure, the project aims to
strengthen other parts of the Uni
versity management system.
Rosse said the project was organ
ized partly in response to this
year's $2 million budget deficit,
Stanford's first since the early
19705.
A six-member steering commit
tee heads Action Plans for Change
and will issue a report in 18
months.
When the report arrives, it will
most likely affect the future num
ber of administrative committees
at Stanford, Rosse said Friday.
"One would hope that the proj
ect would reduce the number of
committees and also make them
more efficient," said Rosse, a
member of the the steering com
mittee. "Some committees now
are doing more than they have
to."

The committee structure
There are 42 committees within
the University, not including six
other special administrative
panels and 10 councils or boards.
Of the 42 committees, seven are
committees of the Academic
Council. According to the Senate
and Committee Handbook, these
committees "formulate policy on
all matters related to teaching and
research, the central functions of
the University." The Committee
on Libraries, for example, fits this
category.
A group of five other commit
tees is known as University Com
mittees, which "deal largely with
matters related to those activities
that support the teaching and
scholarly work of the University,"
according to the handbook. The
Committee on Parking and Trans
portation is one example.
The remaining 30 groups are
either University-wide bodies,
committees or panels, or commit
tees that operate at the school and
department levels.
Besides faculty and staff mem
bers, most committees include one
to three students.
The Committee on Committees
At the core of the committee
structure is the Committee on
Committees, which is responsible
for creating certain committees
and appointing or nominating
their members. The Faculty Sen
ate annually appoints the Com
mittee on Committees.
The Committee on Committees
is responsible for appointing
members to the seven Academic
Council committees and defining
their duties.
For students to gain a spot on
most of these committees, they
must be appointed by the Com
mittee on Committees after re
ceiving a nomination from the
ASSU Nominations Commission.
On University committees, fac
ulty members are appointed by
University President Donald Ken
nedy after nomination by the
Committee on Committees and
students are appointed by the
president after nomination by the
ASSU Nominations Commission.
The president defines the duties
of the University committees and
appoints their chairs.
The president also appoints ad
ministrative panels and commis
sions or task forces.
Committees at work
Stanford, like any bureaucracy,
must have committees to run
smoothly, said Bob Hamrdla, as
sistant to the president.

"The University in general,"
Hamrdla said, "is an institution
that operates with a high degree
of consultation and consensus."
Committees are useful because
they allow a large part of the Uni
versity to become involved in the
decision-making process, Ham
rdla said. But, he added, "Other
times committees can be a
duplication. In any case, commit
tees consume incredibly enormous
resources in the form of time."
Looking ahead to the plans for
streamlining, Hamrdla said com
mittees must be trimmed. Al
though search committees are es
sential when searching for a new
dean or other high-level adminis
trator, he said, "I'm not at all
sure that search committees are
needed for positions lower in the
chain."
Ewart Thomas, dean of the
School of Humanities and Sciences
and another member of the steer
ing committee, also said increased
efficiency was a mcgor goal of Ac
tion Plans for Change.
But Thomas warned that the
project will likely enlarge the Uni
versity bureaucracy over the short
term.
For example, Thomas said,
"feedback loops" will be created
so the steering committee will
know if different committees are
working efficiently, both before
and after the University institutes
the project's findings.
"If you want cost-cutting, if you
want an efficient structure, then
there will be things that will make
the [processl complicated," he
said.
Overall, Stanford committees
work well in making decisions,
said Academic Secretary Arthur
Coladarci, who serves as secretary
of the Senate and for the Com
mittee on Committees. He added,
however, that the committee
structure could work better.
"Personally, I think we keep
adding to the system instead of
subtracting from it," Coladarci
said. "It is a natural sin. When
things are going well, there is no
incentive to raise a question."
When budget constraints arise, he
said, then cuts are considered.
Others said the present com
mittee structure is in no need of
a mtyor overhaul.
"My committee has been work
ing pretty well," said David Reid,
a junior serving on the Committee
on Undergraduate Admissions
and Financial Aids. "Students are
really full members."

is responsible for appointing
members to the seven Academic
Council committees and defining
their duties.
For students to gain a spot on
most of these committees, they
must be appointed by the Com
mittee on Committees after re
ceiving a nomination from the
ASSU Nominations Commission.
On University committees, fac
ulty members are appointed by
University President Donald Ken
nedy after nomination by the
Committee on Committees and
students are appointed by the
president after nomination by the
ASSU Nominations Commission.
The president defines the duties
of the University committees and
appoints their chairs.
The president also appoints ad
ministrative panels and commis
sions or task forces.
Committees at work
Stanford, like any bureaucracy,
must have committees to run
smoothly, said Bob Hamrdla, as
sistant to the president.

"The University in general,"
Hamrdla said, "is an institution
that operates with a high degree
of consultation and consensus."
Committees are useful because
they allow a large part of the Uni
versity to become involved in the
decision-making process, Ham
rdla said. But, he added, "Other
times committees can be a
duplication. In any case, commit
tees consume incredibly enormous
resources in the form of time."
Looking ahead to the plans for
streamlining, Hamrdla said com
mittees must be trimmed. Al
though search committees are es
sential when searching for a new
dean or other high-level adminis
trator, he said, "I'm not at all
sure that search committees are
needed for positions lower in the
chain."
Ewart Thomas, dean of the
School of Humanities and Sciences
and another member of the steer
ing committee, also said increased
efficiency was a mcgor goal of Ac
tion Plans for Change.
But Thomas warned that the
project will likely enlarge the Uni
versity bureaucracy over the short
term.
For example, Thomas said,
"feedback loops" will be created
so the steering committee will
know if different committees are
working efficiently, both before
and after the University institutes
the project's findings.
"If you want cost-cutting, if you
want an efficient structure, then
there will be things that will make
the [processl complicated," he
said.
Overall, Stanford committees
work well in making decisions,
said Academic Secretary Arthur
Coladarci, who serves as secretary
of the Senate and for the Com
mittee on Committees. He added,
however, that the committee
structure could work better.
"Personally, I think we keep
adding to the system instead of
subtracting from it," Coladarci
said. "It is a natural sin. When
things are going well, there is no
incentive to raise a question."
When budget constraints arise, he
said, then cuts are considered.
Others said the present com
mittee structure is in no need of
a mtyor overhaul.
"My committee has been work
ing pretty well," said David Reid,
a junior serving on the Committee
on Undergraduate Admissions
and Financial Aids. "Students are
really full members."
Committees, committees and
more committees — when Uni
versity administrators want to get
something done, one committee
is often set up to plan the project
and another to implement it.
The logic is simple: Nine minds
can do more than one.
But a large committee structure
needs a Committee on Commit
tees to prevent overlap and place
people on the committees. And
now, when the University wants
to streamline the administration
— including the committee sys
tem, another committee is needed
to decide where the changes
should take place.
The complex bureaucracy
created by the entire system is
something the University's Action
Plans for Change project — which
Provost James Rosse introduced
to the Faculty Senate Oct. 26 —

hopes to control.
Besides simplifying the commit
tee structure, the project aims to
strengthen other parts of the Uni
versity management system.
Rosse said the project was organ
ized partly in response to this
year's $2 million budget deficit,
Stanford's first since the early
19705.
A six-member steering commit
tee heads Action Plans for Change
and will issue a report in 18
months.
When the report arrives, it will
most likely affect the future num
ber of administrative committees
at Stanford, Rosse said Friday.
"One would hope that the proj
ect would reduce the number of
committees and also make them
more efficient," said Rosse, a
member of the the steering com
mittee. "Some committees now
are doing more than they have
to."

The committee structure
There are 42 committees within
the University, not including six
other special administrative
panels and 10 councils or boards.
Of the 42 committees, seven are
committees of the Academic
Council. According to the Senate
and Committee Handbook, these
committees "formulate policy on
all matters related to teaching and
research, the central functions of
the University." The Committee
on Libraries, for example, fits this
category.
A group of five other commit
tees is known as University Com
mittees, which "deal largely with
matters related to those activities
that support the teaching and
scholarly work of the University,"
according to the handbook. The
Committee on Parking and Trans
portation is one example.
The remaining 30 groups are
either University-wide bodies,
committees or panels, or commit
tees that operate at the school and
department levels.
Besides faculty and staff mem
bers, most committees include one
to three students.
