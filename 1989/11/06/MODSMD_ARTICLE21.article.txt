## Being 'politically correct' 
### 
IN HIS 1985 welcome speech to new
students, University President Donald
Kennedy said "Question authority,
even if it wears a tweed coat." In his
1989 welcome speech to the new students,
Kennedy said to question "correct
politics."
What has changed? To begin this in
quiry, I must ask some questions. First:
What are "correct politics?"
Remember those times in which stu
dents worked to get the Board of Trustees
to divest the University's holdings in
South Africa; students broadened the re
quired Western Culture curriculum to
include the works of women and people
of color so that all students could receive
a more well-rounded education for their
$21,000.
Are these the infamous "correct
politics"?
What about the campaigns for ethnic
studies, better support for ethnic centers
and general respect of all people that
students of color organizations are
waging?
Could these campaigns that benefit the
entire student body be "correct politics" ?
Perhaps "correct politics" relates to the
release of African National Congress po
litical prisoners in South Africa amid the
largest anti-government rallies in the
country's history.
Maybe "correct politics" are what
motivates the tens of thousands of coal
miners in Appalachia to fight for decent
working conditions and basic human
rights.
Well, my guess is that "correct politics"
are simply the struggles that everyday
people — particularly people of color and

other progressive people — wage in order
to improve the quality of life for everyone.
The students of color groups have al
ways held these "correct politics" in their
efforts to improve Stanford.
These organizations have been the real
driving force for change on this campus.
Without their work, it is doubtful that
there would be any theme houses; or that
anyone would be able to enjoy the pro
gramming of the four cultural centers;
or that Jesse Jackson could have ad
dressed a crowd of thousands at White
Plaza last year.
So, what are Kennedy's politics? 1 know
that in the years that I have been a
student here, Kennedy has supported pro
gressive change in the curriculum and
on campus overall. On national television,
in a discussion with arch-conservative
William Bennett, former Secretary of Ed
ucation, he upheld the changes in West
ern Culture.
In May 1988, Kennedy shared the
podium with Jesse Jackson in supporting
a student-initiated Education Bill of
Rights.
Therefore, I am confident that he does
support many of things brought to the
entire community by students of color
that have made this University a premier
multicultural university.
From 1985 to 1989, what has made
Kennedy change? I believe that it is the
climate set on campus by a small and
vocal minority — the right wing — that
is inciting suspicion of the "motives" of
students of color.
Ironically, they label those who have
united the majority of campus behind a

vision of a better Stanford as "fringe"
elements.
It is in fact they who are responsible
for sowing seeds of mistrust among all
members of the Stanford community that
allow demeaning and intimidating racist
and sexist epithets to flourish and that
may send a black student to jail for two
years.
Because this miniscule population is
threatened by these progressive changes,
they attack the gains from which every
one has benefited and attempt to drive
us back to a period of no multicul
turalism. 0 '
By fomenting an air of mistrust on
campus, where the folks whoare respon
sible for creating a better Stanford are
subject to unwarranted suspicion, those
in "authority" are keeping the University
from progressing to the next decade and
the next century in which people of color
will be the majority in many states.
I would like to return to 1985, when
we were encouraged to "question author
ity." I would like to question those who
stand in the way of progress and in the
way of those who are striving for a more
just, representative and equal society.
