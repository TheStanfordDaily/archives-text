## SIG does actively seek financial aid for its interns 
### 
ON BEHALF OF Stanford in
Government, I am writing in
response to The Daily's Friday
editorial "Internal additions."
I would like to thank The Daily for
focusing on the importance of
Sacramento and state government in
general as an opportunity for students
to serve as interns.
While The Daily's editorial states
that "now might be a good time for
SIG to draw on its alumni contacts to
build up the stipend fund and ensure
that students of all financial back
grounds will be able to participate,"
SIG, in actuality has been doing that
for years.
Not only do we raise funds, but we
have a financial aid program that

Not only do we raise funds, but we have a financial aid
program that addresses the financial constraints of all
students who desire to intern.

all students who desire to intern. We
are delighted to report that several
Sacramento agencies and offices intend
to sponsor SIG Fellows.
Unfortunately, we will be unable to
provide an allowance of more than
$1,500. We agree with The Daily's
editorial that $1,500 is not enough for
students on financial aid.
However, all students, SIG Fellows
included, who are on financial aid are
eligible to apply for additional financial

assistance from SIG.
We are working diligently to raise
more money. In the past, all of SlG's
fellowships — in Washington and
Sacramento — have been supported by
donations from Washington area
alumni. Hopefully, when Sacramento is
a self-supporting program, we will be
able to increase the amount of our
stipends.
For the first time, SIG will be
fundraising in Sacramento in addition

to Washington. This month, SIG will
send out 8,500 solicitation letters. The
money that we receive will not go only
to our Washington and Sacramento
fellowships, but to our financial aid
program for interns and Fellows.
Stanford in Government is excited
about the potential of our program in
Sacramento. We believe that public
policy at the state level is as important
as public policy at the federal level.
Once again, we thank The Daily for
its support of our efforts in
Sacramento. Anyone wishing to donate
to SlG's Financial Aid Program can
make checks payable to Stanford in
Government and mail them to P.O.
Box 3037, Stanford, California 94309.
