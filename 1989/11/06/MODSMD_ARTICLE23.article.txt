# Student support sought for worker facing loss of his job of 24 years
## 
### 
This appeal is being made to you,
the Stanford student community, on
behalf of our father, Jos6 Oropeza,
who is the groundskeeper at Tresidder
Union.
Our father has served the University
diligently and faithfully for over 20
years. He has worked at Tresidder in
an exemplary manner and now the
University wants to show him its grati
tude. How? By forcing him from his
job.
Tresidder has told our father that it
is transferring his work to other
United Stanford Workers and that it is
giving him a choice; retire on a total of
$7,200 a year, which includes social
security and pension, or take a demo
tion to a custodial job.
If he chooses to take the demotion,

Tresidder has told our father that he
and all the day custodians will now
have to come to work in the middle of
the night.
When Tresidder gave our father this
option it knew fully well that we
transport him to and from work from
San Jose. It knows our family cannot
transport him in the middle of the
night.
Our father has worked for over 60
years, including 22 years in the copper
mines. He has worked extremely hard
so we don't understand how the Uni
versity could do this to him in his last
years.
It is imperative that we enlist your
support in our effort to force the Uni
versity to reconsider its position re
garding our father's future and also to
preserve the union's integrity in its
attempt to protect its members' rights.
We want to take this opporturnity to
express our thanks and gratitude to
each and every one of you that has
taken the time to read our appeal and
hope that your support helps sway the

University's unfair and ungrateful posi
tion.
The Oropeza Family
