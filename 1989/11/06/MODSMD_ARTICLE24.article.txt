# Tresidder's tight budgetary constraints are not understood
## 
### 
The discussion about the Tresidder
deficit that has appeared in The Daily
(most recently on Wednesday) can help
readers to understand some of the
facets of running a community center
under difficult economic constraints.
It is especially important for students
to know about because it is their use
of Tresidder Union coupled with a part
of their tuition dollars that provides
some of the revenues.
Put differently, continued deficits will
inevitably tax students' pocketbooks.
A University mandate requires Tres
idder to live within its means.
This includes being mindful of the

need to protect jobs at all levels. We
have met this goal by attrition where
this has been possible. Reducing staff
is a last resort — and one that we
have avoided by helping staff find
posts elsewhere within the University.
This has been the case with some of
our facilities workers. Two custodians
who chose to seek transfers are now
(or soon will be) working elsewhere on
campus. Both of them will earn more.
We continue to seek a mutually ben
eficial situation for a third member of
the staff.
I join Tresidder business laborer
Linda Crouse in her call for student
organizations to learn about Tresid
der's program and budget priorities.
This includes the Tresidder Union
Board, a student board charged with
advising Tresidder on operational mat
ters. This is a situation where facts
will help, not hinder, our collective
efforts.
