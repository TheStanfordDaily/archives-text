No clues about human
nature gained from
return of lost wallet
Isn't humanity interesting? I lost my
wallet Wednesday afternoon in the
Coffee House. I believe I hadn't even
realized I d lost it — I was asleep in
my still-three-person trailer in Manzan
ita Park when someone from the Rec
reation Center called me to say it had
been turned in.
So I rode over there thinking, "Well,
that's nice, I didn't even know it was
lost and already it's found." As some
readers may have guessed, I arrived at
the Recreation Center to find my wal
let intact, including my credit cards,
but whatever cash I had (some $40 or
so) was gone.
I was puzzled at the nature of the
person who would steal the cash yet

Oh well. Whatever. I just thought I'd
share that with you.
P.S. To the person who "returned"
my wallet: Thanks, I guess.

Columnist takes a
hypocritical stance
on affirmative action
It's hypocritical liberal white males
like Gary Loeb who make minorities
like myself despise affirmative action.
Ignoring the stupid nature of his
comparison between the Roble renova
tion and affirmative action, one state
ment in his Oct. 24 column really
shows his misunderstanding of an
issue: "The only way we can ever hope
to abolish discrimination is to give
minorities the benefit of the doubt and
allow them to show their skill."
Well thanks for placing your doubt
aside and letting us (minorities) into
your institution.
