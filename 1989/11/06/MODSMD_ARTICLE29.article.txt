Night Studio: A Memoir of Philip
Guston

In the history of recent Amer
ican painting, the later works of
Philip Guston (1913-1980) have
acquired an almost mythical stat
ure.
After fifteen years at the fore
front of the Abstract Expres
sionist movement, in the company
of such artists as Willem de
Kooning and Mark Rothko, Gus
ton renounced his well-known
gestural abstract style in the late
sixties and began to paint figura
tively. The images he created were
self-consciously clumsy, cartoon
like renderings of an odd assort
ment of everyday objects —
bricks, shoes, books, bottles,
clocks, cups, etc. — and were often
peopled with humorous yet
slightly menacing figures, some
times masked by Ku Klux Klan
hoods. In one such picture, enti
tled "The Studio" (1969), the
hooded figure, a cigarette in one
hand and a paintbrush in the
other, is painting a self-portrait
— it is Guston's own ironic self
image.
When these pictures were first
shown in New York in 1970, they
were seen as heresy by the official
art world, who greeted Guston's
new style with shock and derision.
The art critic for the New York
Times, Hilton Kramer, attacked
Guston as "A Mandarin Pretend
ing to be a Stumblebum." Res
ponding to Kramer's negative
review with a letter to the editor
defending the artist, was Guston's
daughter, Musa. Now, almost
twenty years later, Musa Mayer
has published "Night Studio: A
Memoir of Philip Guston."

longer necessary — the critical
estimation of his late work has,
in the years since his death, risen
dramatically. Rather, she at
tempts to get beyond the popular
romantic image of Guston as a
tortured, misunderstood artist
and to present him as a human
being — a husband, father,
teacher and friend.
Thus, although Mayer has an
undergraduate degree in art his
tory and is preparing a scholarly
catalogue of her father's work, the
tone she adopts is not historical,
nor even biographical. Rather it
is autobiographical — she writes
in the first person and refers to
her subject as "my father" or
"Philip."
Mayer presents her father as a
man of tremendous vitality and a
great love of life. A big man with
an enormous appetite for good
food, alcohol and cigarettes, Gus
ton loved to converse with friends
about art, poetry and philosophy

late into the night. But he was
also an intensely private man,
with an overriding need for the
nocturnal solitude of the painting
studio, and a horror of ringing
phones, predatory dealers and
critics, and gallery openings —
especially his own.
Mayer describes the relation
ship between Guston and his wife,
the shy and sensitive Musa
McKim, who gave up her own
career as a painter because of her
husband's superior achievements,
and who let him lean on her for
emotional support and protection
from the demands of the outside
world. Mayer also explores her re
lationship with her father. With
remarkable honesty, she presents
herself as the insecure daughter
of a famous man, starved for his
attention and affection, but un
able to compete with his commit
ment to his art.
Mayer draws on her own mem
ories and knowledge of Guston,
as well as on his letters, autobi
ographical notes, published state
ments, and interviews with others
who knew him, to paint a fasci
nating portrait of the artist.
"Night Studio" includes a number
of intimate photos of the artist,
his friends and family in addition
to reproductions of his work.
Mayer recounts many memorable
anecdotes about Guston's life, be
ginning with his childhood in Los
Angeles, his early work as a
muralist for the WPA in the
thirties, his career as a teacher
in the Midwest in the forties, and
his presence in the artistic com
munities of New York and
Woodstock in the fifties and
sixties.
But the emphasis of the narra
tive falls on the last decade of
Guston's life, the period during
which his art became increasingly
personal and powerful even as his
health began to deteriorate.
Mayer recounts how Guston's

'. . . it is this solitary dialogue, most intimate of conversations that forms

the painter, in his studio, alone.'

taste for life's carnal pleasures
eventually wore him out: he suf
fered a massive heart attack in
early 1979 and recovered long
enough to attend the opening of
his triumphant 1980 retrospective
at the San Francisco Museum of
Modern Art, before dying of an
other heart attack a few weeks
later.
The daughter's account of this
last year of her father's life is
particularly moving. It was a time
when she attained a new closeness
to him, the account of which is
made all the more poignant by
the author's — and the reader's

— knowledge of Guston's absence
as the narrative is being written.
Guston's absence is, paradoxi
cally, the central presence in the
book. Each story Mayer tells
about her father inevitably
reminds us that he is no longer
there. The book ends with a vision
of his now-empty studio, where
he often painted late into the
night, cleared of the clutter of
canvases, easels, palettes, tubes
of paint and paint brushes, and
ashtrays: "no longer steeped in
sadness, it is too anonymous for
that. It is no longer his. It's just
a room, an empty room. It could

be anyone's space, with its flat
lights, its silences, its dust."
Responding to the question of
why he changed his style, Guston
once said, "What you're doing is
trying to stay alive and continue
and not die." Musa Mayer's
"Night Studio" is a testament to
Guston's commitment to staying
alive, honoring the memory of her
father and celebrating a life
worthy of his much-admired
paintings.

about her father inevitably
reminds us that he is no longer
there. The book ends with a vision
of his now-empty studio, where
he often painted late into the
night, cleared of the clutter of
canvases, easels, palettes, tubes
of paint and paint brushes, and
ashtrays: "no longer steeped in
sadness, it is too anonymous for
that. It is no longer his. It's just
a room, an empty room. It could

be anyone's space, with its flat
lights, its silences, its dust."
Responding to the question of
why he changed his style, Guston
once said, "What you're doing is
trying to stay alive and continue
and not die." Musa Mayer's
"Night Studio" is a testament to
Guston's commitment to staying
alive, honoring the memory of her
father and celebrating a life
worthy of his much-admired
paintings.

In the history of recent Amer
ican painting, the later works of
Philip Guston (1913-1980) have
acquired an almost mythical stat
ure.
After fifteen years at the fore
front of the Abstract Expres
sionist movement, in the company
of such artists as Willem de
Kooning and Mark Rothko, Gus
ton renounced his well-known
gestural abstract style in the late
sixties and began to paint figura
tively. The images he created were
self-consciously clumsy, cartoon
like renderings of an odd assort
ment of everyday objects —
bricks, shoes, books, bottles,
clocks, cups, etc. — and were often
peopled with humorous yet
slightly menacing figures, some
times masked by Ku Klux Klan
hoods. In one such picture, enti
tled "The Studio" (1969), the
hooded figure, a cigarette in one
hand and a paintbrush in the
other, is painting a self-portrait
— it is Guston's own ironic self
image.
When these pictures were first
shown in New York in 1970, they
were seen as heresy by the official
art world, who greeted Guston's
new style with shock and derision.
The art critic for the New York
Times, Hilton Kramer, attacked
Guston as "A Mandarin Pretend
ing to be a Stumblebum." Res
ponding to Kramer's negative
review with a letter to the editor
defending the artist, was Guston's
daughter, Musa. Now, almost
twenty years later, Musa Mayer
has published "Night Studio: A
Memoir of Philip Guston."

longer necessary — the critical
estimation of his late work has,
in the years since his death, risen
dramatically. Rather, she at
tempts to get beyond the popular
romantic image of Guston as a
tortured, misunderstood artist
and to present him as a human
being — a husband, father,
teacher and friend.
Thus, although Mayer has an
undergraduate degree in art his
tory and is preparing a scholarly
catalogue of her father's work, the
tone she adopts is not historical,
nor even biographical. Rather it
is autobiographical — she writes
in the first person and refers to
her subject as "my father" or
"Philip."
Mayer presents her father as a
man of tremendous vitality and a
great love of life. A big man with
an enormous appetite for good
food, alcohol and cigarettes, Gus
ton loved to converse with friends
about art, poetry and philosophy

late into the night. But he was
also an intensely private man,
with an overriding need for the
nocturnal solitude of the painting
studio, and a horror of ringing
phones, predatory dealers and
critics, and gallery openings —
especially his own.
Mayer describes the relation
ship between Guston and his wife,
the shy and sensitive Musa
McKim, who gave up her own
career as a painter because of her
husband's superior achievements,
and who let him lean on her for
emotional support and protection
from the demands of the outside
world. Mayer also explores her re
lationship with her father. With
remarkable honesty, she presents
herself as the insecure daughter
of a famous man, starved for his
attention and affection, but un
able to compete with his commit
ment to his art.
Mayer draws on her own mem
ories and knowledge of Guston,
as well as on his letters, autobi
ographical notes, published state
ments, and interviews with others
who knew him, to paint a fasci
nating portrait of the artist.
"Night Studio" includes a number
of intimate photos of the artist,
his friends and family in addition
to reproductions of his work.
Mayer recounts many memorable
anecdotes about Guston's life, be
ginning with his childhood in Los
Angeles, his early work as a
muralist for the WPA in the
thirties, his career as a teacher
in the Midwest in the forties, and
his presence in the artistic com
munities of New York and
Woodstock in the fifties and
sixties.
But the emphasis of the narra
tive falls on the last decade of
Guston's life, the period during
which his art became increasingly
personal and powerful even as his
health began to deteriorate.
Mayer recounts how Guston's

'. . . it is this solitary dialogue, most intimate of conversations that forms

eventually wore him out: he suf
fered a massive heart attack in
early 1979 and recovered long
enough to attend the opening of
his triumphant 1980 retrospective
at the San Francisco Museum of
Modern Art, before dying of an
other heart attack a few weeks
later.
The daughter's account of this
last year of her father's life is
particularly moving. It was a time
when she attained a new closeness
to him, the account of which is
made all the more poignant by
the author's — and the reader's
