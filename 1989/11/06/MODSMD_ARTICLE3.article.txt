# Students may need second measles shot
## 
### June Cohen Editorial staff 
In response to a dramatic in
crease in measles cases nation
wide, Stanford doctors may
require additional vaccinations for
incoming students.
In 1989, there was a 275 percent
increase in the number of measles
cases reported to the Centers for
Disease Control. This increase,
which included outbreaks on 70
U.S. college campuses, has led
several medical organizations to
recommend that all college stu
dents receive a secondary measles
vaccination. The overwhelming
mtyority of college students have
only received one immunization.
The details of Cowell's tentative
policy have not yet been worked
out. However, it is most likely
that the two-dose requirement
would not apply to current stu
dents.
John Dorman, assistant direc
tor of Cowell Student Health Cen
ter, said the University "may
phase in the policy by only apply
ing it to incoming students — that
way, within three or four years,
the entire campus will have re
ceived a second immunization."
A second immunization would
only be required of individuals
who received their first vaccine
prior to 1980. "An international
student, for instance, who was im
munized upon entering Stanford,
wouldn't need two shots, one after
the other," Dorman said.
Most people receive the measles

vaccine at the age of 15 months.
However, to ensure long-term
protection, experts now recom
mend the administration of a
second immunization when a child
enters junior high school.
In response to the recent out
breaks and current medical opin
ion, the American College Health
Association and the American
Pediatrics Association have rec
ommended that all students en
tering college be required to have
had the second vaccine.
Any revisions in Stanford's
health policy awaits the recom
mendation of the centers' Advi
sory Committee on Immunization
Practices, which should be an
nounced within the next few
months.
Cost and availability of the vac
cine are also areas of concern in
the revision of immunization
policy. "The vaccine itself isn't dif
ficult to obtain; it's the state
funded vaccines which are
scarce," said Dorman.
He said Cowell gets its vaccines
free from Santa Clara County,
which in turn gets them from the
state government — whose sup
plies may eventually run out.
"Right now, we have about 60
vials of the stuff, and sometime
this month we expect them to run
out," Dorman said. The current
charge for vaccinations is $5 for
primary and $20 for secondary
immunizations. However, an in
creased demand for the vaccine.
without a concurrent rise in supp
ly, may drive prices up, raising
the cost of the primary immuni
zation to $20, he said.
No measles outbreaks have
been reported in Northern Cali
fornia, although some cases were
recently reported at UCLA.
In 1983, Stanford became one
of the first two schools, along with
the University of Rochester in
New York, to require measles im
munizations for incoming stu
dents.
Stanford may once again lead
the way for other schools, as no
other college has yet added the
two-dose requirement to their im
munization policies, according to
Dorman. "We've always been in
the vanguard of these opera
tions," he said.
Emergency measures have been
taken to revaccinate student
populations at schools which ex
perienced outbreaks of measles
cases.
