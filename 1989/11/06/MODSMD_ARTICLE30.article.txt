# Women confront loss 'After You've Gone'
## 
### After You've Gone By Alice Adams Alfred A. Knopf, $18. 95 
Reviewed by Jaimey Fisher
The main characters in Alice' Adams'
new collection of short stories, "After
You've Gone" have much in common:
most are middle-aged, successful, well
educated women, some from the Bay
Area. More importantly, all of them
have experienced loss.
Though she deals with problems
such as facing mid-life and alcoholism,
in these 14 stories Adams mainly ex
plores how women react after a hus
band, parent or even a pet leaves.
Most of the women in "After You've
Gone" end up confronting their prob
lems alone, recalling moments they
would prefer to forget. In the midst
of their reminiscing, Adams' women
often grow embarrassed by their ina
bility to overcome their loss, and their
resulting dismay and, in some cases,
depression provides most of the book's
tension.
Loss in these stories assumes many
forms. In the title story a successful
female lawyer writes to her ex-lover,
a poet who has run off with a younger
'woman. She writes of attempts to deal
with the loss: "The truth is, for a
while I managed very well indeed ....
Nights. In my dreams of course you
are still here, or you are leaving and

I know that you are and there is noth
ing to do to stop you. ..
In "Lost Cat," Maggie, a psychiatric
social worker, falls victim to another
kind of loss after Diana, her beloved
cat, runs away during a rainstorm.
Afterwards Maggie cannot keep herself
from imagining future losses and
catastrophes, and becomes trapped in
her spiralling anxiety: "If Diana does
not come back, if I never find her, it
means that Jonathan will leave, go
back to Boston, and that next time I
have a mammogram they will find
something bad...." Maggie wavers be
tween irrationally inventing her own
death and feeling shame about her
cat-inspired distress.
While "Lost Cat" is the collection's
shortest and one of its best, the story's
end reveals one of Adams' weaknesses:
the cat appears and Maggie abruptly
quits worrying. While women are
able to overcome their loss in each
instance, the consistent, easy resolu
tions often leave the reader disap
pointed. In each story Adams carefully
creates complex tensions only to
destroy them.
This is true in another of Adams'
stories, entitled "Fog." While cooking
for a dinner party, San Francisco
painter Antonia Love trips over her
cat and breaks her arm. Immobilized
on the floor and waiting for her friends
to arrive, Antonia begins to worry
about losing her young lover, Reeve.

Flashing to Antonia's friends, who are
all in cars somewhere on the foggy
freeway, Adams discreetly explores
how others feel envy and resentment
about Antonia and her recent success.
But, like "Lost Cat," "Fog" suffers
from an overly optimistic ending that
resolves too much. Reeve abandons his
planned affair with Sharon, the
Berkeley super-model/artist, and
returns to Antonia, arriving in time
to rush her to the emergency room.
When her friends find Antonia with
her arm in a cast, they forget the
jealous emotions they had felt earlier
and draw closer.
"Fog" also points up the difficulties
Adams encounters in writing about

men. Most of Adams' male characters
lack depth: they are often despicable,
and in their egotism and insensitivity
they are stereotyped and too predict
able. For example, in "Fog," one male
character uses Antonia's friend to get
an interview. Another, an artist, feels
such envy over Antonia's success that
he begins to imagine her sexual con
quest, and even Reeve can feel close
to Antonia only after he's had a chance
to rescue her.
What Adams does best is to concen
trate her intense psychological descrip
tion on a single character. For instance,
in "On The Road" Adams again follows
a solitary woman, writer Brendan Hal
lowell, on a lecture tour. She has to
confront her newfound popularity as
she prepares to speak before a crowd
of excited undergraduates: "Brendan
understands at least two things at that
moment: one, that she is not making
sense; and two, that it does not matter
at all what she says at this point."
This kind of appealing, easy descrip
tion makes Brendan one of her most
endearing characters.
Adams' optimistic endings and un
interesting men prove a problem in
"After You've Gone"; she tends to glide
too easily over her minor characters,
never letting us empathize or identify
with them. Nevertheless Adams' skill
as a storyteller makes this collection
both likable and accessible.

The main characters in Alice' Adams'
new collection of short stories, "After
You've Gone" have much in common:
most are middle-aged, successful, well
educated women, some from the Bay
Area. More importantly, all of them
have experienced loss.
Though she deals with problems
such as facing mid-life and alcoholism,
in these 14 stories Adams mainly ex
plores how women react after a hus
band, parent or even a pet leaves.
Most of the women in "After You've
Gone" end up confronting their prob
lems alone, recalling moments they
would prefer to forget. In the midst
of their reminiscing, Adams' women
often grow embarrassed by their ina
bility to overcome their loss, and their
resulting dismay and, in some cases,
depression provides most of the book's
tension.
Loss in these stories assumes many
forms. In the title story a successful
female lawyer writes to her ex-lover,
a poet who has run off with a younger
'woman. She writes of attempts to deal
with the loss: "The truth is, for a
while I managed very well indeed ....
Nights. In my dreams of course you
are still here, or you are leaving and

I know that you are and there is noth
ing to do to stop you. ..
In "Lost Cat," Maggie, a psychiatric
social worker, falls victim to another
kind of loss after Diana, her beloved
cat, runs away during a rainstorm.
Afterwards Maggie cannot keep herself
from imagining future losses and
catastrophes, and becomes trapped in
her spiralling anxiety: "If Diana does
not come back, if I never find her, it
means that Jonathan will leave, go
back to Boston, and that next time I
have a mammogram they will find
something bad...." Maggie wavers be
tween irrationally inventing her own
death and feeling shame about her
cat-inspired distress.
While "Lost Cat" is the collection's
shortest and one of its best, the story's
end reveals one of Adams' weaknesses:
the cat appears and Maggie abruptly
quits worrying. While women are
able to overcome their loss in each
instance, the consistent, easy resolu
tions often leave the reader disap
pointed. In each story Adams carefully
creates complex tensions only to
destroy them.
This is true in another of Adams'
stories, entitled "Fog." While cooking
for a dinner party, San Francisco
painter Antonia Love trips over her
cat and breaks her arm. Immobilized
on the floor and waiting for her friends
to arrive, Antonia begins to worry
about losing her young lover, Reeve.

Flashing to Antonia's friends, who are
all in cars somewhere on the foggy
freeway, Adams discreetly explores
how others feel envy and resentment
about Antonia and her recent success.
But, like "Lost Cat," "Fog" suffers
from an overly optimistic ending that
resolves too much. Reeve abandons his
planned affair with Sharon, the
Berkeley super-model/artist, and
returns to Antonia, arriving in time
to rush her to the emergency room.
When her friends find Antonia with
her arm in a cast, they forget the
jealous emotions they had felt earlier
and draw closer.
"Fog" also points up the difficulties
Adams encounters in writing about

men. Most of Adams' male characters
lack depth: they are often despicable,
and in their egotism and insensitivity
they are stereotyped and too predict
able. For example, in "Fog," one male
character uses Antonia's friend to get
an interview. Another, an artist, feels
such envy over Antonia's success that
he begins to imagine her sexual con
quest, and even Reeve can feel close
to Antonia only after he's had a chance
to rescue her.
What Adams does best is to concen
trate her intense psychological descrip
tion on a single character. For instance,
in "On The Road" Adams again follows
a solitary woman, writer Brendan Hal
lowell, on a lecture tour. She has to
confront her newfound popularity as
she prepares to speak before a crowd
of excited undergraduates: "Brendan
understands at least two things at that
moment: one, that she is not making
sense; and two, that it does not matter
at all what she says at this point."
This kind of appealing, easy descrip
tion makes Brendan one of her most
endearing characters.
Adams' optimistic endings and un
interesting men prove a problem in
"After You've Gone"; she tends to glide
too easily over her minor characters,
never letting us empathize or identify
with them. Nevertheless Adams' skill
as a storyteller makes this collection
both likable and accessible.
