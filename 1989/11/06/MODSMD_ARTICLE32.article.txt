## Cardinal finally tastes the thrill of victory Healthy Johnson gets the job done for offense 
### Chris Crader Editorial staff 
It may be the beginning of No
vember, but football season has
just begun at Stanford. After
starting the year 1-7, the Cardinal
team stepped back, refocused and
decided to begin anew with a
three-game season.
Saturday at Stanford Stadium
the Cardinal opened that second
season with a win, beating UCLA
17-14.
Stanford improves to 2-7 on the
season, 2-4 in the Pacific 10 Con
ference. The Bruins are guaran
teed their first losing season of
the decade after falling to 3-6, 2-4.
"We just had a goal in mind
that we were going to win these
last three for the seniors," inside
linebacker Eric Pierce said after
recording 10 tackles in his first
start of the year. "After the USC
game we got together and had a
meeting. We were grabbing for
something and Coach (Denny)
Green threw it at us. A lot of
guys' eyes lighted up. I know mine
did. It gave us something to go
for."

scrimmage Pierce sacked UCLA
quarterback Bret Johnson to
make it fourth down. As soon as
Pierce got up, strong safety Rob
Englehardt ran over and sacked
Pierce in celebration. The en
thusiam spread throughout the
entire defense and the result was
holding UCLA to only 13 first
downs, seven below their season
average.
"We had a really good week of
practice," said Englehardt, a
senior who made 12 tackles. "For
the young guys it's a way to start
next year. For the seniors it's our
season. It's a three-game
season. ... I just concentrated
before every play on getting
myself emotionally ready and
pumped up. It helps when 10
other guys are busting their asses
too."
Stanford's offense, under the
leadership of Brian Johnson, had
probably its best game of the year
as far as controlling the ball. Stan

ford ran for 103 yards and was
able to grind out yardage to run
down the clock in the second half.
Fullback Scott Eschelman ran
for a career-best 73 yards, includ
ing 65 in the second half, and
averaged 5.6 yards per carry.
"We were improved with our
running game," Green said. "Tom
Vardell in the first half and Scott
Eschelman in the second half
really did the job for us."
The Cardinal expected to be
able to run on the Bruins, the
league's worst team against the
rush. "Our coaching stafT really
felt like we could run against
them," guard Chuck Gillingham
said. "The idea was to wear them
down. I think we did that the
fourth quarter. They knew we
were coming right at them.
"Between plays you'd hear their
guys yelling to each other about
where we were going to run. Then
we'd go out there and just do it
and they couldn't stop us.. .. It
was kind of nice to go out after
someone."
Eschelman agreed. "The line
was just doing a great job," he
said. "There were a lot of cutback

lanes and we tried to take advan
tage of that. We got into kind of
a rhythm running the ball. For
maybe the first time this year we
were able to run the ball consis
tently for good yardage.... It was
a matter of ball control."
Stanford's success on the
ground also helped the defense.
The Cardinal defense played
nearly 42 minutes against USC
last week and simply got tired,
but the ground game enabled
Stanford to hold on to the ball
for more than 32 minutes yester
day. Stanford began the game
with a 14-play, 80-yard drive that
Green called perhaps the team's
best all year.
"(The defense) sat on the bench
for eight minutes and got rested
up," Englehardt said. "It's just a
great feeling to watch the offense
stick it down their throat. You
get pumped. It makes you want
to go out there and stick it down
their offense's throat."
The opening drive for Stanford
was highlighted by a great one
handed grab of a Johnson pass
by Ed McCaffrey on a key third
down play. Johnson hooked up
with McCaffrey again a few plays
later from 12 yards out to make
it 7-0.
Later in the first quarter, how
ever, the Bruins struck back. A
short Stanford punt gave UCLA
the ball in Cardinal territory and
on the second play of the drive
Bret Johnson found Scott Miller
in single coverage with cornerback
Alan Grant. Johnson put the ball
right where it had to be and Miller
made a diving catch on the goal
line to tie the score.
In the next few minutes the
Stanford defense forced a fumble
and tackled the UCLA punter
twice on botched punting plays,
and the Cardinal was able to start

three consecutive drives inside the
Bruin 40. Sacks stalled the first
two, but on the third Stanford
moved the ball down to set up a
seven-yard touchdown run by Var
dell.
The Bruins got the ball back
with just over four minutes
remaining in the half and moved
to the Cardinal 32. Johnson again
found Grant on Miller in single
coverage and aired it out. Miller
made the catch while appearing
to be out of bounds, but the of
ficial signalled a touchdown and
the score was tied.
"I thought he was out of
bounds," Grant said. "I had him
pinned on the sidelines. ... I saw
it out of bounds.
"I was having a great time out
there except for a couple of plays.
It almost ruined my day."
The Stanford defense ended up
ruining the Bruins' day by holding
them scoreless in the second half.
UCLA almost got on the board
late in the second half but Kevin
Scott blocked a 37-yard field goal
try by Alfredo Velasco.
"I got by and I was kind of
off-balance," Scott said. "I just
threw one arm out. It hit me
square in the hand. If I had two
hands I might have caught it and
gone the other way."
Stanford mustered a 57-yard
drive to set up the winning points,
a 44-yard field goal by John Hop
kins early in the fourth quarter.
The Cardinal thwarted a Bruin
drive by forcing fullback Mark
Estwick to fumble with 6V2
minutes left, then ran five
minutes off the clock by driving
53 yards. The Bruin defense held
Stanford on downs at the Bruin
five, but on their third play safety
Jimmy Klein forced another
fumble and Albert Richardson re
covered to seal the win.
While the Bruins outgained
Stanford 309 yards to 258, the
Cardinal forced three fumbles and
did not turn the ball over. Stan
ford's special teams also

dominated, blocking a field goal,
preventing two punts by tackling
the punter, and getting good cov
erage on kick and punt returns.
"[Special teams! was the differ
ence in the game," Scott said.
"It was a good win for us; a
big win, and we wanted it bad,"
defensive tackle Lester Archam
beau said. "Anytime you beat
UCLA it's a benchmark.
Anytime."

It may be the beginning of No

three-game season.
Saturday at Stanford Stadium
the Cardinal opened that second

17-14.
Stanford improves to 2-7 on the

the decade after falling to 3-6, 2-4.
"We just had a goal in mind
that we were going to win these

linebacker Eric Pierce said after
recording 10 tackles in his first

something and Coach (Denny)

did. It gave us something to go

holding UCLA to only 13 first

"We had a really good week of

Stanford's offense, under the

probably its best game of the year

Stanford's success on the

The Cardinal defense played
nearly 42 minutes against USC
last week and simply got tired,
but the ground game enabled
Stanford to hold on to the ball
for more than 32 minutes yester
day. Stanford began the game
with a 14-play, 80-yard drive that
Green called perhaps the team's
best all year.
"(The defense) sat on the bench

great feeling to watch the offense

get pumped. It makes you want
to go out there and stick it down

The opening drive for Stanford
was highlighted by a great one

Later in the first quarter, how

Bret Johnson found Scott Miller
in single coverage with cornerback
Alan Grant. Johnson put the ball
right where it had to be and Miller
made a diving catch on the goal
line to tie the score.
In the next few minutes the
Stanford defense forced a fumble
and tackled the UCLA punter
twice on botched punting plays,
and the Cardinal was able to start

three consecutive drives inside the
Bruin 40. Sacks stalled the first
two, but on the third Stanford
moved the ball down to set up a
seven-yard touchdown run by Var

The Bruins got the ball back
