# Stanford win signals start of confident end to season

### Mark Rogowsky Editorial staff 
When the Stanford football
team starts winning on a regular
basis, Saturday's victory over
UCLA will be remembered as the
turning point.
Not because the Cardinal was
dominant in knocking off the
worst Bruin team in almost 20
years, but because Stanford did
just enough to win. From an
opening drive that chewed up over
six minutes to a fumble-forcing
hit by Jimmy Klein that sealed
it, the Cardinal finally put it all
together for the first time since
those eight improbable minutes
against Oregon.
Brian Johnson, who has been
the starter in eight of Stanford's
10 wins during the past three sea

sons, led an offensive effort that
controlled the ball for almost a
quarter longer than it had a week
earlier. That allowed a well-rested
defense to keep the Bruins in
check throughout the game.
And while safety Rob
Englehardt noted, "It wasn't a
one man thing, there were 11 guys
out there," his efforts, along with
those of some other relatively un
heralded defenders like Eric
Pierce and Scott Palmbush, made
the difference.
Pierce, who broke a leg in the
spring and hasn't seen much play
ing time in 1989, said the
groundwork for the win was laid
a week ago. "In the locker room,
the coaches said 'we've got three
games left, let's go out and win
all three . . . storm the Bastille.' "
"We came out, we had a great

week of practice" and the five
game losing skein finally came to
an end. Of his 10-tackle perform
ance, Pierce said, "This week I
just got my chance and took ad
vantage."
But Englehardt, who came up
with 12 tackles and seemed to be
involved in nearly every play dur
ing the first half, was quick to
point out the effect his teammate
had. "Pierce's sack (on the game's
third play) got everybody fired
up," Englehardt said.
Supercharged by that play,
Englehardt came out on the next
drive to record two tackles and
two successful pass defenses in
cluding a near interception in the
backfield. "I love to see a good
hit. It's like having sex or some
