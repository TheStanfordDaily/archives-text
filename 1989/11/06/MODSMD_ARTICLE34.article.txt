## Broncos shut out Cardinal in physical battle 
### Michael Clayton Staff writer 
SANTA CLARA â€” In a game reflect
ing the ups-and-downs of the 1989
season, the Stanford men's soccer team
finished its schedule with a 3-0 loss to
No. 1 Santa Clara yesterday.
For the first 45 minutes of yesterday's
game, Stanford's men played even with
the No. 1 team in the nation. For the
final 45 minutes, however, the Broncos
(17-0-2) deluged the Cardinal with con
stant pressure and recorded three goals.
"This is the best we played since
knowing that we wouldn't be in the
playoffs," senior All-American candidate
Mark Semioli said. "We all played well.
We all played hard."

rough physical blows throughout the
first half. On the dry, torn-up turf of
Buck Shaw Stadium, the players aggres
sively raced to each free ball and fought
to push off the opposing players.
Recognizing the possibility of losing
control of the game, the referee quickly
whistled the teams to a halt at every
close play of the first half.
"We seemed to be having enough trou
ble against them without having to
worry about the referee," Coach Sam
Koch said. "Santa Clara is a very
talented team."
Stanford's frustration with the
officiating reached an apex about
midway through the first half.
After sophomore midfielder Bill
Bollengier prevented a Bronco
breakaway by jumping on the
back of a Santa Clara player and
riding him to the ground, the ref
eree issued Bollengier the Cardi
nal's first yellow card of the game.
This seemed to ignite the
players on both squads to attack
the opposing players even more
aggressively, and with 22 minutes
left in the first half the referee
presented the Cardinal with a
flurry of yellow cards.
Within a span of two minutes,
Semioli, Koch, junior Todd Caven,
and freshman Randy Mann each
were awarded the cautionary
card.
Still, the Cardinal escaped the
first half with the 0-0 deadlock,
largely due to the efforts of senior
goalie Chris Helling. Helling
stopped numerous Bronco attacks
with his quick diving saves. With
just over six minutes left in the

half, he barreled forward to
deflect the ball off an attacking
Jeff Baicher then dove to his right
to stop Baicher's quick shot on
goal.
"We played a strong defensive
first half," Koch said. "In the sec
ond half we had a couple of mis
takes, and they took it to us."
Ten minutes into the second
stanza Bronco Cameron Rast
found Jeremy Smith on the left
side of the goal, and Smith slid
the ball past a diving Helling to
put the Broncos up 1-0.
Five minutes later Smith re
corded an assist when he touched
the ball to Steve Robertson who
flicked the ball with his back heel
into the net to make the score
2-0. Finally, with five minutes left
in the game, Bruce Broughton re
leased a 35-yard shot which just
cleared Helling's outstretched
hands to finish the scoring.
Stanford completed its season
with an 8-11-2 record, losing four
of its final five games and being
shut out in its last three contests.
"The combination of the tough
est schedule in the nation and the
young players made this season
difficult," Semioli said. "Next
year, the team will be much im
proved."
