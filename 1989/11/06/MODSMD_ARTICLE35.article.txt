### T.C. Hall Staff writer 
According to Stanford Coach
Dante Dettamanti, No. 4 Stanford
and No. 5 UCLA played the same
defense against each other in Sat
urday's water polo match. He did
not have to say who played it bet
ter.
Stanford turned in its best de
fensive effort of the year to clip
the Bruins 5-3 at deGuerre Pool.
Behind what Dettamanti called
a "superb" effort by goalie Todd
Kemp, and strong two meter play
by Rick McNair and Eric Blum,
the Cardinal raised its record to
24-7 while solidifying its hold on
second place in the Pacific 10 Con
ference at 3-2.
The last-place Bruins dropped
to 11-12 and remain winless in
four Pac-10 games. Their three
goals were the fewest scored
against Stanford's defense this
year."
"It was a tough defensive
game," Dettamanti said. "Our
shooting was off, but holding
UCLA to three goals really helps.

Rouseau, allowing him two goals,
but effectively muffling him as a
dominant force in the game.
"McNair played great defense
on Rouseau," Dettamanti said.
"We crashed on his left side and
only gave him the backhand
[shot).
Rouseau opened up the scoring
in the first quarter, but Jon
Swerdloff evened the score at 1-1
on a Stanford counter-attack. The
second quarter opened with a
Blum goal on a Stanford man-up
situation, but UCLA answered
with Rouseau s second goal of the

game. The score remained tied at
2-2 until Jeff Oeding scored with
47 seconds left to send Stanford
into the half with a 3-2 lead.
According to Dettamanti, the
quick up and down tempo of the
second quarter took a toll on his
players.
"The second quarter was
tough," Dettamanti said.
"Everyone was tired. Guys who
don't normally ask to come out,
asked to come out."
Stanford may have been tired,
but they kept afloat well enough
to maintain their lead over the
Bruins in the second half. McNair
provided the only goal of the third
quarter when he scored from two
meters to give the Cardinal a two
goaJ cushion. Stanford was ahead,
but it was not until McNair scored
again in the fourth quarter that
Dettamanti began to relax.
"The turning point of the game
was when McNair scored the goal
that put us up by three," Det
tamanti said. "It was a key goal,
we really needed to lead by three."
UCLA scored again to bring the
score to 5-3, but it was the only
second half goal the Rniins could
manage.
