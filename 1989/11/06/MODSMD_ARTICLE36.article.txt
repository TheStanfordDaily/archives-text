# Bruins halt spikers' winning streak
## 
### Chris Crader Editorial staff 
When a team gets on a hot streak, it
seems like nothing can stop them. They
play with more confidence, lucky breaks
go their way, and it just seems like they
can't lose.
Until they run into a team that's on
an even hotter streak.
The Stanford women's volleyball team
did just that Friday night, falling to
second-ranked UCLA 15-13, 15-4, 15-
10.
The seventh-ranked Cardinal had won
three straight Pacific 10 Conference
matches, all in three games, before run
ning into the Bruins at Old Pavilion.
UCLA extended its win streak to 18
matches and the Bruins have won 33
consecutive Pac-10 matches, dating to
1987.
Stanford is now 13-7, 9-4 in league

play, while UCLA is 21-1, 15-0 after
beating California Saturday.
"I thought UCLA played pretty well,"
Stanford Coach Don Shaw said. "They
played really well as a matter of fact."
Despite the seemingly one-sided loss,
however, Shaw thought the Cardinal
played fairly well itself. "We had our
chances, especially in the first game,
and we just got stuck in that one rota
tion and gave up a lot of points in a
row," he said. "We win that first game
and it's a whole different story. ... I
still feel good about this team. We're
doing some good things."
Stanford started fast, getting out to
a 5-2 lead, but the topspin serve of

Daiva Tomkus brought the Bruins back
into the game. Stanford went ahead
again at 13-8, but UCLA came back as
the Cardinal's passing broke down.
Bruin freshman Marissa Hatchett
ended the game with two consecutive
blocks, teaming first with classmate
Natalie Williams and then with sopho
more Jenny Evans, in a sign of things
to come. Hatchett had five blocks in
the first game and 14 for the match as
UCLA outblocked Stanford 17-7 on the
night.
"Our freshmen were doing a great
job blocking," said Tomkus, the Pac-10
Player of the Year last season. "I think
one of UCLA's strong points is blocking
and we showed it tonight."
The Bruins ran all over Stanford in
the second game as their blocking got
even better. Tomkus and Williams also
heated up as hitters, recording seven
kills apiece in the game. In game
two, Williams hit at a .875 per
centage and Tomkus hit .700.
UCLA continued its hot streak,
building a 9-3 lead in the third
game. But Shaw then inserted
senior Jennifer Chaffee into the
lineup and the Cardinal came up
with three straight blocks, includ
ing two by Chaffee, to narrow it
to 9-6.
Stanford got one more point,
but the Bruins put on a sideout
clinic to keep Stanford at bay and
win the game, and the match.
"I thought we played well,"
UCLA Coach Andy Banachowski
said. "We just had that one bad
rotation where Stanford scored
about eight straight points on us
(in the first game)."
Chaffee was about the only
Stanford player to find success
against the UCLA defense that
held the Cardinal to a .187 hitting

percentage. She had six kills and
hit .600, but no starting hitter
for Stanford beat Bev Oden's .278
percentage. Oden had seven kills
and added 12 digs and six blocks.
Kristin Klein had 12 kills and
10 digs for the Cardinal but hit
only .133 against the Bruin block.
UCLA was led by the team's Big
Three: All-Americans Tomkus,
Elaine Youngs and Williams, who
will likely battle Oden for frosh
of the year honors.
Williams was able to hit over
the top of the Cardinal block
much of the time and finished
with a match-high 14 kills, a .417
hitting percentage and seven
blocks. Tomkus had 12 kills, two
service aces, nine digs and a .429
hitting percentage and Youngs
had 11 kills, two aces and 13 digs.
Evans had six kills and a match
high 14 digs.
The Cardinal returns to Old Pa
vilion tomorrow night at 7:30 p.m.
to meet the University of the
Pacific. The fourth-ranked Tigers
beat Stanford at UOP early in
the year.
