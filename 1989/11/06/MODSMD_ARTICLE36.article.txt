### Chris Crader Editorial staff 
When a team gets on a hot streak, it
seems like nothing can stop them. They
play with more confidence, lucky breaks
go their way, and it just seems like they
can't lose.
Until they run into a team that's on
an even hotter streak.
The Stanford women's volleyball team
did just that Friday night, falling to
second-ranked UCLA 15-13, 15-4, 15-
10.
The seventh-ranked Cardinal had won
three straight Pacific 10 Conference
matches, all in three games, before run
ning into the Bruins at Old Pavilion.
UCLA extended its win streak to 18
matches and the Bruins have won 33
consecutive Pac-10 matches, dating to
1987.
Stanford is now 13-7, 9-4 in league

the Cardinal's passing broke down.
Bruin freshman Marissa Hatchett
ended the game with two consecutive
blocks, teaming first with classmate
Natalie Williams and then with sopho
more Jenny Evans, in a sign of things
to come. Hatchett had five blocks in
the first game and 14 for the match as
UCLA outblocked Stanford 17-7 on the
night.
"Our freshmen were doing a great
job blocking," said Tomkus, the Pac-10
Player of the Year last season. "I think
one of UCLA's strong points is blocking
and we showed it tonight."
The Bruins ran all over Stanford in
the second game as their blocking got
