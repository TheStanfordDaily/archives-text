# Field hockey drowned by Pacific

In a season marked with many
learning experiences but few wins,
the Stanford women's field hockey
team closed out its 1989 campaign
Friday with another lesson in
frustration.
After leading the University of
Pacific 1-0 at the half, Stanford
was clawed 2-1 by the sharp
shooting Tigers on the Cardinal's
home turf.

UOP captured the Northern
Pacific Conference title with the
victory, propelling them past
second-place California and into
the NCAA playoffs.
Meanwhile, Stanford wrapped
up a disappointing season with a
fined record of 1-13-3, 1-3-2 in
NorPac play. Friday's game was
the fourth played by Stanford in
the past week, following a gruel
ing East Coast road swing.
"Like most of the year, we
played with good intensity and
played with them all the way, but
they got the ball in the net and
we didn't," said Asst. Coach
Noelle Nelson.
"We have a team of really good
athletes," continued Nelson.
"They have the potential to be
really good field hockey players.
It is our job [as coaches] next year
to turn them into a good field
hockey team."
Coach Cheryl Johnson, who di
rected the Cardinal to an 8-5-2
record in 1988 following three
consecutive NorPac titles, flew to

India following the defeat, where
she is playing for the U.S. Na
tional Team.
Johnson and assistants Nelson,
Suzanne Doi and Andi Wolpert
will have a long off-season to train
the Cardinal. Stanford will prac
tice indoors to increase its quick
ness during the winter and will
return to the grass fields in the

spring.
Senior Michelanne Baker scored
Stanford's solo goal against UOP,
slapping it past the Tiger goalie
on a corner play.
But UOP recovered for two
scores in the second period, the
final score coming with just under
three minutes left in the game.
As the California field hockey

team watched its postseason
hopes slip away, UOP slipped in
the winning goal on a deflection
in front of a crowded net.
A Cardinal victory would have
sent the Golden Bears to the
playoffs.
The defeat was the final per
formance for seniors Baker and
Beth Lewinger.
