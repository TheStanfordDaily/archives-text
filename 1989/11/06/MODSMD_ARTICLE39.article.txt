# Golfers shoot for second straight victory
## 
### Brian W. Webber Staff writer 
Repeating. It's every team's
goal, yet it ranks among the most
elusive to achieve.
As the men's golf team begins
play in today's opening round of
the UC-Santa Barbara Invita
tional in Lompoc, Calif., its sights
are firmly set on capturing its
second consecutive tournament
title.
Riding the momentum genera
ted by its victory at the U.S. In
tercollegiate three weeks ago,
Coach Wally Goodwin's squad is
poised to post back-to-back wins.
In assessing his team's chances
at claiming the tournament title,
Goodwin expressed guarded
optmism.
"Every time you tee it up, you
either win or lose. The very na
ture of golf makes it so difficult
to predict how well you'll do,"
Goodwin said.
Exhausting the classic adages
that describe the game's capri
cious quality, Goodwin did offer
a glimpse at his team's outlook.

'Coming off our most consistent tourna
ment, we're going for it. We've practiced
with the intent of shooting for every pin.'
— Coach Wally Goodwin

"Coming off our most consis
tent tournament, we're going for
it. We've practiced with the intent
of shooting for every pin," he said.
The Cardinal's success can be
attributed to its abundance of tal
ent. The rigorous intersquad
qualification process has
produced a different lineup for
each of the team's three events.
Stanford is represented this
week by seniors Brad Benbrook,
Don Christiansen and Chris Bar
bour, junior Johan Remmelgas
and sophomore Christian Cevaer.
Benbrook, Christiansen and
Cevaer have provided a core of
stability thus far. They have ap-

peared in all three tournaments
and have led with consistently ex
cellent play.
While expressing satisfaction
with the performance of his top
three players, Goodwin was espe
cially proud of the other two Car
dinal linksters.
Remmelgas, a junior college
transfer, has made the adjustment
to the higher caliber of Division
I competition with remarkable
ease. Participating in just his sec
ond Stanford event, he has pro
vided an infusion of talent and
made an immediate impact.
"Johan is going to make a great
difference on this team. His ex
perience and maturity provide a

settling effect," Goodwin said.
While Barbour is also making
his second appearance for the Car
dinal, his achievement is addition
ally notable as it marks the
culmination of four years of ef
fort.
"I'm thrilled to see Chris make
our lineup. He's certainly worked
hard to do it," Goodwin said.
Stanford's quest for consecutive
wins is aided by the relatively
weak field at the UCSB event.
The invitational does not include
the powerful Pacific 10 Confer
ence foes that regularly dominate
West Coast play.
Those teams that should chal
lenge tj»e Cardinal for the team
title include host Santa Barbara,
Pepperdine, San Diego State and
Oregon State.
Today's competition consists of
a grueling 36-hole opening round.
The remaining 18 will be played
tomorrow.
Destiny might also play a role
in the Cardinal's drive for victory.
The team's only win last season
came on this same La Purisima
course.
