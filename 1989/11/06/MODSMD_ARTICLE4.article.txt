# Health Physics revamped
## 
### Jock Friedly Editorial staff 
In response to a state report
critical of the University's radia
tion safety, Stanford has restruc
tured its Health Physics program,
removing the director of 15 years.
The University is making this
change and several others after
the state's Department of Health
Services found more than 30 vi
olations of state and University
codes during a four-day inspection
in March.
The state required Stanford to
perform an internal evaluation
and to summarize the report's
findings to the state. University
officials say the report, which was
completed Aug. 31, will not be
made public.
The shuffling of management
positions will make Roland
Finston — the former director of
Health Physics — a senior health
physicist, and he will continue to
teach radiation safety.
Finston and other University
officials say the changes in man
agement were to increase the ef
fectiveness of the program and to
redirect the talents of the depart
ment.
"I think it was timely after 15
years of directing the depart
ment," Finston said.
Other changes include:
• Less reliance on students to
make required audit surveys. Stu
dents were extensively used by the
department to inspect laboratories
around campus. With the
changes, a new staff member will

perform audits and fewer students
will be needed.
• Formation of a subcommittee
beneath the special panel estab
lished to study the effectivess of
the program. The committee will
study various documents outlin
ing the policies and procedures
governing the Health Physics De
partment.
• Increased staffing to the de
partment. Two positions have

been added to the Health Physics
program. One staff member will
be in charge of auditing laborato
ries and another will deal with
the waste program.
The changes come two years
after a former University em
ployee made allegations of waste,
mismanagement, coverup and in
timidation in Stanford's Health
and Safety program.
In the shakeup that followed,
Health Physics escaped relatively
unscathed. The report requested
by the state represents the first
extensive review of the Health
Physics program in years. In fact,
Finston was the only top official
of Stanford's safety program left
since the University's crackdown.
Finston will be replaced by John
Holmes, a longtime department
member, who will assume the title
of associate director of environ
mental health and safety.
