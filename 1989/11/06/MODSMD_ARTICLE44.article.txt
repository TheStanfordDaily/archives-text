# Money's not the issue
## Public service proves to be a viable option for many 
### Frank Quaratiello 
Last year, Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., and Rep. Dan McCurdy,
L)-Okla., introduced a bill that offered strong incentives for
American students to do public service work. The bill follows
the lead of many other countries that offer incentives for, or
in some instances require, military service.
Nunn and McCurdy's proposal, the Citizenship and National
Service Act, brought up the age-old question of pay-back. Are
the students of the so-called "me generation" giving back to
the system what they got out of it?
But, as we approach the '90s, pay-back is not really the
issue. Students trom top universities are choosing to go into
public service fields because they provide exciting opportunities,
present a different perspective and offer an eye-opening intro
duction to the real world.
Many students do short stints in public service fields before


The Center for Public

students are pursuing
careers in public service

Stanford.

going on to careers in law, government
or business. But a few continue their
commitment to public service — full
or part-time — for the rest of their
lives, staying involved and trying to
make a difference.
Stanford students who walk through
the door of the Haas Center for Public
Service enter a world filled with com
munity service opportunities. Students
can tutor in East Palo Alto or partic
ipate in one of the projects sponsored
by the Stanford Volunteer Network
such as Reach Out Today, a campus
wide day of volunteer activities.
Julie Lythcott, who graduated from
Stanford last year, works as a volunteer
coordinator at the Haas Center. She
serves as a liaison between students
and the community and advises the
14 student directors of the Stanford
Volunteer Network.
"I enjoy helping students find ways
to serve the community," Lythcott
said. "Working with people here, I've
found that public service is a viable
alternative to going into the corporate
world."
Each year, the center offers a staff
position to a recent graduate who
wants to gain more experience in the
public service field. Lythcott said the

expericncc is helping her prepare for
a future career in the legal profession.
"This has helped me focus my at
tention and shown me what else is out
there," she said.
Many individuals who work in
public service fields are woefully un
derpaid or even volunteer their time
on a part-time basis. But each year
three Stanford students and three UC-
Berkeley students are awarded John
Gardner Fellowships — the veritable
plums of the public service field.
Gardner Fellows are awarded
$12,000 over an 11-month period
which — although it is not a lot of
money — eases the financial burden
of working in public service.
Last year's Gardner Fellows from
Stanford were Gail Mackauf, Jon Wel
ner and Subodh Chandra.
Chandra is doing political work in
the Stanford area, and both Mackauf
and Welner have moved to Washing
ton, D.C.
While Welner works for the World
Wildlife Fund, Mackauf has offered
her services to a smaller, less well
known organization called the Wom
en's Equity Action League.
Through lobbying efforts and public
education, WFAL works to further the
economic position of women, particu
larly low-income women, Mackauf
said.
There are only seven staff members
and six interns at WKAL, Mackauf
said.
"WEAL has very little money,"
Mackauf added. "But people here
lobby with perseverance and exper
tise."
Mackauf said she began narrowing
the field of possibilities for life after
Stanford by finding out more about
large, popular organizations such as
the American Civil Liberties Union,
the National Organization for Women
and the Women's Legal Defense Fund.
"I wanted to get exposed to lobby
ing," Mackauf said. "This has been a
learning experience and I've found out
that the legislative process is far more
complex than any class or textbook
led me to believe."
Mackauf has been lobbying for the
Family and Medical Leave Act, which
is slated to be the next major labor
issue before Congress after the mini
mum wage issue is settled. She also
lobbied for the Child Care Act and
has been doing a wide range of work
on insurance issues.

nation, Mackauf said. "People in the
states only see something when it he
comes a law, hut I feel like I'm having
an impact on the process itself."
Mackauf remembers calling a Cali
fornia representative's office and dis
cussing a crucial hill with his assistant
for about an hour. I he representative,
a strong pro-life advocate, opposed the
D.C. Appropriations Bill because it
provided funds for abortion in the
cases of rape or incest.
The assistant was not very sympa
thetic and, after an hour's debate,
Mackauf said she ended the conversa
tion unsure of its impact.
The next day, when she went to
the congressional gallery to watch the
vote, Mackauf noticed that the repre
sentative, who had previously stated
his opposition to the bill, voted in
favor of the legislation.
Later, the assistant told Mackauf
that she had spoken to the represen
tative and helped to sway his vote.
"I really felt I had .in impact," Mack
auf said.

about — making an impact. And, more
and more Stanford students are enter
ing public service fields and doing just
that. .j»
