# Money's not the issue
## Public service proves to be a viable option for many 
### Frank Quaratiello 
Last year, Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., and Rep. Dan McCurdy,
L)-Okla., introduced a bill that offered strong incentives for
American students to do public service work. The bill follows
the lead of many other countries that offer incentives for, or
in some instances require, military service.
Nunn and McCurdy's proposal, the Citizenship and National
Service Act, brought up the age-old question of pay-back. Are
the students of the so-called "me generation" giving back to
the system what they got out of it?
But, as we approach the '90s, pay-back is not really the
issue. Students trom top universities are choosing to go into
public service fields because they provide exciting opportunities,
present a different perspective and offer an eye-opening intro
duction to the real world.
Many students do short stints in public service fields before


The Center for Public
Service's annual Reach
Out Today offers students
a chance to participate In
community service activi
ties, like this one in East
Palo Alto. More and more
students are pursuing
careers in public service
after they graduate from
Stanford.
