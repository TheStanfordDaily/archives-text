## Former Cardinal star Brad Muster storms through the NFL

Brad Muster runs like a hurricane,
leaving a path of destruction and bro
ken tackles through opposing defenses.
But Hurricane Muster, the starting
fullback for the National Football
League's Chicago Bears, was little
more than a ripple through the leaves
when he arrived on the Stanford
campus back in 198.}.
As a 6-2, 190-pound freshman
Muster started low on the depth charts
at Stanford, but five years of open seas
at Stanford whipped him into a dan
gerous storm capable of inflicting
Hugo-like damage on defenses.
Seven years and thousands of broken
tackles later, Muster, now a strapping
6-3, 230 pounds, is storming the NI L
in his second season with the Bears.

senior year at Stanford, he was drafted
by the Bears as the 23rd pick in the
first round in 1988. He was the fourth
running back taken in the draft, despite
concerns about an ankle injury he sus
tained on the first day of pre-season
practice that forced him to miss half
his senior year.
But, despite his punishing running
style on the field, the humble Muster
is quick to deflect praise to those he
said helped him make it to the NFL.
He reminisces happily about his days
on the Farm.
"Attending Stanford really helped
prepare me for the NFL. All that I
learned at Stanford — relating with
all sorts of people — has really helped
me to make the adjustment to profes
sional football," Muster said.
"I really miss a lot of the guys from
the team," he added. "Some have grad

uated and some are still on the team,
but it really was a good time. Stanford
was a great place to go to school, and
it is a great place to live."
Muster said Stanford helped prepare
him for the "real world" both on and
off the field. The pro-style offense
employed by former Stanford Coach
Jack Elway is very similar 'o the of
fensive scheme used by -prs Coach
Mike Ditka.
"Both Ditka and Elway belong to
the old school of coaching. They be
lieve hard work will bring positive
results. They really stress working on
things in practice to improve for the
games," said Muster, who played for
Elway when he was at Stanford.
"But emotionally, they are a lot dif
ferent," he added.
Although Muster tries to keep a pos
itive attitude, his transition to the NFL
has been turbulent. He has been a
frequent target of criticism by Chicago
fans and media for what they perceive
as a lack of performance from their
first round draft pick.
"While they are all behind the team,
the press and fans have been more

critical of individuals than I was used
to," he said. "It's been a little tough.
"It's really just a matter of me getting
the opportunity to carry the hall — I
have to listen to what the coach says
and do what I can. If the coach is
happy with what I'm doing, then I
can't ask for much more."
Since Muster was a freshman in high
school, people have questioned his
ability to run the ball — they say he
is too big, too slow, or too good at
other positions.
His freshman year at Stanford, and
again when he was first drafted by the
Bears, coaches talked about converting
Muster into a tight end to take ad
vantage of his superb pass-catching
ability.
H is 14 receptions against Oregon in
1985 and 78 receptions in 1985 still
stand as single-game and single-season
records for Stanford.
"I have always had to prove that 1
am an effective runner," he said. "As
long as I am given the opportunity to
show what I can do, I have been able
to get the job done."
Muster, who missed half his senior

year and a chancc at the I ieisman
trophy with a painful ankle injury, has
continued to be troubled by injuries
in Chicago. Lately, he has been both
ered by a back injury which has limited
his action.
"1 have been trying to play through
the injury, and right now it is more
of a mental thing than anything else,"
Muster said.
Like Muster's two-year NR. career,
this season has been a roller-coaster
ride for the Bears. After winning their
first four games, they dropped three
in a row to fall into second place
behind Minnesota in the NFC Central
Division.
Last week they defeated the Los
Angeles Rams 20-10 as Muster scored
a third-quarter touchdown and rushed
for 33 yards.
Muster, who still lives in California
in the off-season, has had more than
the pigskin to take care ot in Chicago.
About a month after he was drafted
by the Bears, Muster had another big
day — he married Vicki Chiamparino.
"There are a lot more social oppor
tunities now, being in the NFL and

in Chicago. But I tend to keep to
myself when I'm not playing football,"
Muster said. "Being married, I usually
just go home after practice."
Muster said he plans to play in the
NFL as long as he can, stressing that,
"I'm having a lot of fun playing foot
ball, and that is the important thing."
After football, Muster expects to
return to graduate school for his
master's degree, which he started
working toward during his fifth year
at Stanford. Since he red-shirted during
his first year at Stanford, he had an
extra year for studies.
Muster was a hard hitter in the class
room too, compiling a 3.2 grade point
average as an economics major and
becoming the first player ever to be a
Pac-10 All-Academic selection for four
years.
The Novato, Calif, native appears
often in the Stanford record books for
his all-purpose rushing, receiving and
scoring.
After igniting the Cardinal in his
tirst Big Game in 1984 with 204 yards
rushing on 34 carries, Muster went on
to gain 2,940 yards rushing and 1,669
yards receiving in his four-year Stan
ford career, placing him second all
time behind Darrin Nelson. Muster

has also scored the most rushing touch
downs in Stanford history — 27
despite missing half his senior year.
In 1986 he led the Cardinal to ai
8-4 record and a Gator Bowl berth a
the Pac-10's Offensive Player of tin
Year, gaining 1,053 yards on th<
ground and 565 through the air.

Muster could have turned pro in
19S. , but stayed with Stanford for his
senior year. His injury cost him a
chance at the Heisman trophy and
probably lowered his stock in the draft,
but he bounced back strong over the
final five games of the season.
In his final performance, Muster
carried for 90 yards and a stirring
15-yard touchdown run in a 31-7 pas
ting of California in Big Game 1987.
Muster said he has followed the Car
dinal through their 1-6 season start
and has kept in touch with friends still
on the team.
"Things aren't that bad," said
Muster. " I he defense is playing really
well, and they have played some top
-20 teams really tough.
"Anytime you have a freshman quar
terback starting, things are not going
to be that easy. Plus, Andy Papathanas
siou and Chuck Gillingham arc the
only experienced offensive linemen."
While Muster's All-American pres
ence still lingers over an injury
shattered Cardinal backfield, he has
traveled the trade-winds to Chicago.
Muster and the Bears can only hope
that his hurricane-like running will
blow long and strong in the Windy
City. 4.
