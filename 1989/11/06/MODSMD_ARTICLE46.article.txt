## CORNER Litigation consulting firm sets the pace with Stanford connections 
### Tim Marklein 
With branch locations in Menlo Park and Cambridge,
Mass., Cornerstone Research is ideally situated to tap two
of the largest brain trusts in the country.
The offices were not built near Stanford and Harvard
Universities by accident — they are part of the six-month
old company's penchant for the best in everything. Pre
viously MAC Research, a division of the MAC Group
consulting firm. Cornerstone became a separate and inde
pendent litigation-consulting company in May.
A proximity to two top universities allows the firm to
draw on the resource of top professors as well as hire
recent graduates, who make up a significant part of its
corps of analysts and managers.
The statistics support the strategy — about one-third
of the Menlo Park branch's 25 analysts have undergraduate
or graduate degrees from Stanford.
"The kind of people that Cornerstone wants are at
Stanford — bright, inquisitive and motivated," said Derek
Kampfe, an analyst who graduated from Stanford in 19S"
with a major in industrial engineering. " I he whole con-
suiting industry has realized that."
The firm primarily researches busi
ness litigation cases, performing tasks
like analyzing factors that affect the
stock and option prices of a company,
determining the effects of a firm's ac
tivities on competitors and studying
the impact of regulatory changes on
the development of an industry.
Edric Starbird, an analyst who grad
uated from Stanford in 1988 with a
degree in industrial engineering, said
the company usually works on "front
page of Wall Street Journal-type
cases."
Most of the specific job qualifica
tions are not taught in classes, but
Cornerstone looks for special abilities
that they find often in Stanford grad
uates.
"Most people come in without the
specific skills," said Grace Carter, an
associate who received an M.B.A. from
Stanford in 1986 after graduating in
1982 with a Human Biology major.
"The ability of Stanford students to
problem solve is one of the most fun
damental tools in consulting."
Starbird said applicants are judged
on leadership abilities, background in

quantitative fields, and problem
solving experience.
Carter added that the company looks
for people who arc "ambitious, put in
a lot of energy and are committed to
getting things right."
The firm's training program pro
vides beginning employees with some
of the specific skills needed for litiga
tion consulting, but much of the learn
ing takes place on the job. "If you
don't have the specific skills, this can
be the classroom," Carter said.
Cornerstone experience is not lim
ited to consulting work, since all
analysts also assume tasks involved
with running the company.
In this way, the company is different
from many consulting firms and other
established companies, Kampfe said.
Before joining Cornerstone, he worked
for 15 months in a larger consulting
firm that was "very much tiered." His
role was "very well defined and it was
difficult to step out of the role," he
said.
Kampfe said he and another analyst
worked together to develop a new
analyst support program.
"We arc building a company where

everybody is involved in some aspect
of the company as well as consulting,"
Carter said.
Cornerstone's youth also translates
into a high degree of energy in the
office. "We want to have the best bro
chure, the best computer system, the
best activities, the best everything,"
Carter said.
Many applicants choose Corner
stone because of the energy, not solely
because of the job type, Carter said.
"They're looking for a certain envi
ronment, and we just happen to be a
litigation-consulting firm."
Kampfe pointed to the varied expe
riences connected to the job as a reasor
for the energy at Cornerstone. "It's i
great position if you don't know vvhai
you want to do," he said, explaining
that the job combines an academic en
vironment with business and litigation
experience.
"If you leave here, the skills art
applicable to a lot ot different jobs,'
Carter said.

or financial analysis done for a case,
or when an expert witness needs as
sistance with analysis.
In either case, the interaction be
tween analysts and Stanford professors
is "extensive," according to Matt
Schuster, who graduated from Stanford
in 1988 with an art history major.
The cases that Cornerstone under
takes gives professors "a place to ap
ply" their latest research theories,
Carter said. "Professors really appre
ciate it. They don't have the time to
do this type of work without help and
still teach and do academic research,
and they recognize that we have a
pool of people as resources."
Starbird said Cornerstone can
produce about ten times the output,
since they can afford more people for
more time than professors.
Most projects are completed by
teams of analysts working with senior
members of the firm. Three to nine
people work on each project for be

twccn three months and two years.
Most analysts only work on one or
two projects at a time.
Though analysts work as a team,
Starbird said independence is stressed
at Cornerstone. "You don't have people
holding your hand," he said, adding
that the quality of the analyst's work
can affect the credibility of the witness
during a trial.
Pressure mounts before the trials —
which occur in about 10 percent of
Cornerstone's cases — and Starbird
said analysts sometimes work long
hours during the month beforehand.
"There's an incredible drive to make
things flawless if you can," he said.
Schuster said the responsibility is im
mense, since an analyst's math mistake
may jeopardize the credibility of a wit
ness' entire testimony. "The litigation
environment is done under a micro
scope," he said.
The periodic long hours draw em
ployees even closer together, Schuster
added. "It's more teamwork — you're
not burning the candle in the office
alone."

Carter said the "self-imposed pres
sure" is often rewarded by the case's
outcome and the learning experience,
as well as through bonuses that Cor
nerstone gives to all employees down
to the analyst level. "There's a rainbow
at the end of all those hours," she
said. "Most consulting firms don't have
equity like that."
The company's small size — the
Menlo Park branch employs 57 people
— leads to more high-level recognition
of the analyst's work. "Upper manage
ment is really aware of the time spent,"
Starbird said.
The energy in the office extends to
office-sponsored activities, which the
analysts said draw employees even
closer together. "It's like you're all in
school," Schuster said.
However, Starbird jokingly noted
one drawback to working at Corner
stone — the few analysts who are UC-
Berkeley graduates. "They will paint
some things blue and gold, and then
we have to change the colors." *>

Before joining Cornerstone, he worked
for 15 months in a larger consulting
firm that was "very much tiered." His
role was "very well defined and it was
difficult to step out of the role," he
said.
Kampfe said he and another analyst
worked together to develop a new
analyst support program.
"We arc building a company where

everybody is involved in some aspect
of the company as well as consulting,"
Carter said.
Cornerstone's youth also translates
into a high degree of energy in the
office. "We want to have the best bro
chure, the best computer system, the
best activities, the best everything,"
Carter said.
Many applicants choose Corner
stone because of the energy, not solely
because of the job type, Carter said.
"They're looking for a certain envi
ronment, and we just happen to be a
litigation-consulting firm."
Kampfe pointed to the varied expe
riences connected to the job as a reasor
for the energy at Cornerstone. "It's i
great position if you don't know vvhai
you want to do," he said, explaining
that the job combines an academic en
vironment with business and litigation
experience.
"If you leave here, the skills art
applicable to a lot ot different jobs,'
Carter said.
Cornerstone analysts are called intc

or financial analysis done for a case,
or when an expert witness needs as
sistance with analysis.
In either case, the interaction be
tween analysts and Stanford professors
is "extensive," according to Matt
Schuster, who graduated from Stanford
in 1988 with an art history major.
The cases that Cornerstone under
takes gives professors "a place to ap
ply" their latest research theories,
Carter said. "Professors really appre
ciate it. They don't have the time to
do this type of work without help and
still teach and do academic research,
and they recognize that we have a
pool of people as resources."
Starbird said Cornerstone can
produce about ten times the output,
since they can afford more people for
more time than professors.
Most projects are completed by
teams of analysts working with senior
members of the firm. Three to nine
people work on each project for be

twccn three months and two years.
Most analysts only work on one or
two projects at a time.
Though analysts work as a team,
Starbird said independence is stressed
at Cornerstone. "You don't have people
holding your hand," he said, adding
that the quality of the analyst's work
can affect the credibility of the witness
during a trial.
Pressure mounts before the trials —
which occur in about 10 percent of
Cornerstone's cases — and Starbird
said analysts sometimes work long
hours during the month beforehand.
"There's an incredible drive to make
things flawless if you can," he said.
Schuster said the responsibility is im
mense, since an analyst's math mistake
may jeopardize the credibility of a wit
ness' entire testimony. "The litigation
environment is done under a micro
scope," he said.
The periodic long hours draw em
ployees even closer together, Schuster
added. "It's more teamwork — you're
not burning the candle in the office
alone."

Carter said the "self-imposed pres
sure" is often rewarded by the case's
outcome and the learning experience,
as well as through bonuses that Cor
nerstone gives to all employees down
to the analyst level. "There's a rainbow
at the end of all those hours," she
said. "Most consulting firms don't have
equity like that."
The company's small size — the
Menlo Park branch employs 57 people
— leads to more high-level recognition
of the analyst's work. "Upper manage
ment is really aware of the time spent,"
Starbird said.
The energy in the office extends to
office-sponsored activities, which the
analysts said draw employees even
closer together. "It's like you're all in
school," Schuster said.
However, Starbird jokingly noted
one drawback to working at Corner
stone — the few analysts who are UC-
Berkeley graduates. "They will paint
some things blue and gold, and then
we have to change the colors." *>

Cornerstone Research is located at
1000 El Camino Real, Suite 250.
With branch locations in Menlo Park and Cambridge,
Mass., Cornerstone Research is ideally situated to tap two
of the largest brain trusts in the country.
The offices were not built near Stanford and Harvard
Universities by accident — they are part of the six-month
old company's penchant for the best in everything. Pre
viously MAC Research, a division of the MAC Group
consulting firm. Cornerstone became a separate and inde
pendent litigation-consulting company in May.
A proximity to two top universities allows the firm to
draw on the resource of top professors as well as hire
recent graduates, who make up a significant part of its
corps of analysts and managers.
The statistics support the strategy — about one-third
of the Menlo Park branch's 25 analysts have undergraduate
or graduate degrees from Stanford.
"The kind of people that Cornerstone wants are at
Stanford — bright, inquisitive and motivated," said Derek
Kampfe, an analyst who graduated from Stanford in 19S"
with a major in industrial engineering. " I he whole con-
suiting industry has realized that."
The firm primarily researches busi
ness litigation cases, performing tasks
like analyzing factors that affect the
stock and option prices of a company,
determining the effects of a firm's ac
tivities on competitors and studying
the impact of regulatory changes on
the development of an industry.
Edric Starbird, an analyst who grad
uated from Stanford in 1988 with a
degree in industrial engineering, said
the company usually works on "front
page of Wall Street Journal-type
cases."
Most of the specific job qualifica
tions are not taught in classes, but
Cornerstone looks for special abilities
that they find often in Stanford grad
uates.
"Most people come in without the
specific skills," said Grace Carter, an
associate who received an M.B.A. from
Stanford in 1986 after graduating in
1982 with a Human Biology major.
"The ability of Stanford students to
problem solve is one of the most fun
damental tools in consulting."
Starbird said applicants are judged
on leadership abilities, background in

quantitative fields, and problem
solving experience.
Carter added that the company looks
for people who arc "ambitious, put in
a lot of energy and are committed to
getting things right."
The firm's training program pro
vides beginning employees with some
of the specific skills needed for litiga
tion consulting, but much of the learn
ing takes place on the job. "If you
don't have the specific skills, this can
be the classroom," Carter said.
Cornerstone experience is not lim
ited to consulting work, since all
analysts also assume tasks involved
with running the company.
In this way, the company is different
from many consulting firms and other
established companies, Kampfe said.
