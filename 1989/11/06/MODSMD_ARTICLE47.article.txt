Sitting in front of Tresidder Union
during a June visit, Sigourncy Weaver
recalled the drama of her days at Stan
ford. Little of it occurred on stage;
she recalled the drama of teachers in

dormmates in her two Wilbur Hall

at Yale (Drama School). I think the
main reason I became an actor was I
learned so much and had so much fun
here."
Weaver hadn't planned on being an
actor and she paints a rather self
deprecating picture of her acting ability
in those days.
"I was not an outstanding person in
the group. If someone had asked then
