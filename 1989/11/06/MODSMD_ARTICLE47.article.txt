# From Wilbur to Hollywood
## Sigourney recalls her years of living dangerously at Stanford 
### Susan McKean 
Sitting in front of Tresidder Union
during a June visit, Sigourncy Weaver
recalled the drama of her days at Stan
ford. Little of it occurred on stage;
she recalled the drama of teachers in
the classroom, protests in White Plaza,
dormmates in her two Wilbur Hall
homes.
She remembered those years as pas
sionate, outrageously fearless and
formative.
Weaver graduated from Stanford in
1972 with a bachelor's degree in Eng
lish. Back on campus seventeen years
later, she proclaimed her decision to
transfer from Sarah Lawrence College
to Stanford after freshman year to be
the best move she ever made.
It was at Stanford that she discov
ered her love of acting.
But she didn't find it in the drama
department.
"1 thought the drama department at
the time was extremely stuffy. They
were always doing very safe produc

tions. ... So I was part of a group
that wc founded, called the Palo Alto
Company, which sprang out of a
defunct frat, called Beta Chi, the hippie
frat. We did the most outrageous
theater.
"We did a lot of things that the
drama department probably would
have said, 'Well, you're not ready to
do that.' We just did them all. That's
where I discovered how much I en
joyed doing theater.
"1 miss getting made up with 10
other people in a little bathroom with
a little broken piece of mirror for all
of us. It was all so much more formal
at Yale (Drama School). I think the
main reason I became an actor was I
learned so much and had so much fun
here."
Weaver hadn't planned on being an
actor and she paints a rather self
deprecating picture of her acting ability
in those days.
"I was not an outstanding person in
the group. If someone had asked then
who would be successful in the com
pany, I would have been one of the

last picked. . . . It's a very unfair busi
ness.
"I was very torn. I really wanted to
be a journalist. I really wanted to be
a writer. And I was planning to get
my Ph.D. in English. 1 was taking all
these honors courses my last year and
we began to study criticism of criticism
and it was getting pretty dry.
"So, I went to see my adviser in the
English Department and said, is it
going to be like this in graduate
school?' And he said, 'Yeah, I'm afraid
so.' And I said, 'I've got to get out of
this.' "
Off stage and on, she played the
role of an early '70s student impec
cably. Walking through White Plaza,
she said, rekindles memories of
protests, demonstrations, arrests, and
riotous antics.
"One year we had a protest fair,
with a booth where you could throw
a brick through a plate-glass window
for all those who weren't doing it for
real."
Despite the flourish of her life here,
she recalled that it wasn't that way
for all students. Students, of course,
were not all united in thought or ac
tion. It's just that flourish is more easily
remembered than hesitance.

"I recall a polarity among the stu
dents between the people who were
coming to Stanford to get a good start
and no matter how much tear gas was
floating around, they were in their
dorms playing cards or studying while
the rest of us were out living the Revo
lution.
"1 think a lot of us understood we
were getting a very privileged educa
tion and perhaps felt some embarrass
ment from it."
Since then, she has admirably steered
clear of embarrassment. A philosophy
for sanity in her business keeps Weaver
unscathed by the cut-throat movie
world. She makes sure she enjoys it
all, even the "shameless advertising
of her Ghostbusters pin and watch,
which she somehow managed to wear
elegantly.
Weaver said she only appears in
movies that she would like to sec, and
screeched, holding her stomach, at the
suggestion of choosing her roles ac
cording to a preferred image.
"1 don't care how great a part is. It
it's not part of a story that 1 find
interesting, I would never want to do
it. And also, I like to be in movies
that people do end up seeing.
"So 1 care a ereat deal about who

the director is: Is it someone who is
gong to fink out halfway through and
give up his vision, or is it someone
who will fight and scream and hurl
himself at the studio heads to get what
he needs. He or she. That's very im
portant.
"I've developed a philosophy about
this business. Despite the tilings that
you want to do, are not given to do
and break your heart, there's always
something just as good if not better
just around the corner.
"For instance, I was up for two leads
and 1 screen-tested for them and I lost
both of them, and then 1 was offered
this small role in 'I he of Living
Dangerously' by Peter Weir. And I
thought 'Well, what the hell, and it
turned out to be one of the greatest
experiences I ever had."
Although she said her best cinematic
performances are "still ahead of me,
out of those already made Weaver
ranked "The Year of Living Danger
ously" and "Gorillas in the Mist" as
her favorites. Both take place on other
continents, and her favor for them
suggests the continued influence of two
mentors from her college years. She
remembered as a student looking up
to both Jane Goodall, one of the first
zoologists to study wild gorillas, and
Margaret Mead, a pioneering
anthropologist, after she heard them
speak in Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
But as a successful actor, she had
some surprising things to say about
the impact of films on society.
"I guess I don't really think that a
film is important enough to really in
fluence anything. A film can inspire
you and move you and make you laugh
or take you someplace where you ha
ven't been. 'Gorillas' is a wonderful
movie because it will take you to
Africa, to an Africa you didn't imagine,
a cold Africa. And expose you to an
experience. Other films are like a roller
coaster; you're exhausted when you
come out. ... I hope [movies] don't
influence people too much.
"I would be horrified if anyone
thought of me as a role model."
Yet, she added that she realizes her
strong role as a hero in the "Aliens"
scries symbolized a "certain kind of
liberation. A female hero that wasn't
wearing a little metallic brassiere."
And although she said she sees the
film industry improving in its treat
ment of women, she thinks more needs
to be done.
"1 don't know why they don't make

more films with women as the heroes.
Maybe they try. I do think they're
doing better. When I started out it
was so discouraging; you'd get sent
20 scripts, they'd all be horrible
girlfriend parts and walking in and out
in little dresses. But there's still a long
way to go.
"Men in the industry are paid [much
more]. A Harrison Ford would get
paid about $4 million per picture, and
a woman would get . . . maybe an
eighth of that. . . . (Robert) Redford
got about $7 or 8 million for 'Out of
Africa,' and Meryl (Strecp) got under
$3 million.
"The studios say that women haven't
proven themselves as big box office
hits. And they have another theory
that's lame. They say women pick the
movies, and the pictures that women
want to go to see with their husbands
or dates are pictures with Mel Ciibson,
Kevin Costner, etc.
"It's funny because the feedback I
get as an actress is that women go to
see other women. They enjoy going
to see strong women that they can
relate to. Women aren't ornaments. . .
and they like to see films that reflect
that."
Weaver sets the task of securing

gender equality in the movie world
squarely on the actor's shoulders. "It's
going to he up to us, the studios aren't
going to make it easy tor us. I hey're
not going to wake up one day and say
[she assumes a deep, contrived voice]
'Let's do great roles for women. Let's
call it women's year.' It's just not going
to happen."
Then she sheepishly admitted, how
ever, to playing a "throwback" role in
"Ghostbusters 11": "Yeah, I play a
girlfriend and a mother."
Although she credits film's social in
fluence with minimal power, Weaver,
who appeared in both Ghostbusters
movies, has observed some unusual
effects of those films on American so
ciety.
"I've been noticing how all the
under-5-ycar-olds have all become
Ghostbusters, especially the little boys.
I haven't seen too many little girls
running around with proton packs,
which is too bad. I've certainly seen
a lot of little boys running around.

anyone quite understands why.

appeal to these little post-toddlers?
He's very hip, and sort of dark and
anti-authority and these little guys are
running around saying 'This chick is
toast.' "
But from one who would know,
what is it that does make Bill Murray
so appealing?
"1 think he's got a real twinkle in
his eye. He says what we'd all like to
say. He's fearless. And what's great

about Bill is he never ends up having
to pay tor his mistakes on film. Ile
kind of slithers out of any retribution."
In discussing the relationship be
tween her character and Murray's
character in "Ghostbusters II," she
recalled once asking Murray, "What
do you think is the arc of our rela
tionship in this film?"
And he said, "The what?"
"That was good for half an hour of
making fun of me," Weaver said. â€¢>
