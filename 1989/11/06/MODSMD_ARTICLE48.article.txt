# GET A JOB
## Career counselors can help you make the right choice 
### Tim Marklein 
For four years, Stanford students are pushed by admin
istrators and faculty to diversify their interests and broaden
their horizons.
When senior year rolls around, that diversification gives
way to specialization, as graduates are forced to choose a
field, a job and a path for their lives to follow.
This shift in attitudes takes its toll on many Stanford
students who want to continue developing their broad
range of interests, but counselors at the Career Planning
and Placement Center remind students that the road ahead
need not be a one-way street with no options for a detour.
"People are very mobile," according to counselor Lynne
Mason. She said the average person goes through four or

five career changes and about seven job changes in a
lifetime. "That takes a lot of pressure off the initial de
cision."
Counselor A 1 Levin said he "reminds students that they
are only making an initial decision. . . . Interests and values
change."
Levin and Mason emphasized that more options should
be explored before a student determines the course of his
or her entire life.
"A lot of people come in with a definite idea of what
they plan to do but have no idea really what it is," Mason
said. "They haven't the foggiest idea whether that's a
match for them.
"The biggest problem we have is that people only see
what's visible, which is about one percent of the oppor
tunities. There's a whole other world out there that's
available," she said.
Mason said one of the primary goals of the CPPC is to
encourage "exploration" of other options. "About 80 per
cent of jobs are obtained by networking, or people directing
their own job search."
Many students determine what job they want from
reading ads in The Daily, which includes only large, es
tablished organizations, Levin said. "Is that the most ef
fective way to find a job you're interested in?
"We try to encourage students to look at other options
than the obvious," he said.
Mason said peer and parental pressure leads many stu
dents to look at jobs they feel they should take rather
than ones they want to take.
"Sometimes they think they should do what's more
prestigious and what's well known," she said. "What other
people think seems to be really important to Stanford
students. . . . They went to a name- brand school, and
they want to go to a name-brand job where they can
justify the cost of a Stanford education."
Mason and Levin said their job is to help a student
assess what job fits the student's interests and values. "We
help facilitate what they really want to do. It helps to
have someone with an objective view and the student's
interest at heart," Mason said.
Once offers start coming in, Mason and Levin said
students' reactions are very interesting. "They usually try
to convince themselves to do what they really want to do
as opposed to what they think they should do," Levin said.
Mason said she works with some students to make a
grid with categories and "literally add up numbers." Some
times, students will be surprised with the results and "say
that's not what they expected." She then asks the student,
"What were you hoping would happen?" to determine
what the student wants to do.
"It's a very gut-level kind of decision," Mason said. "A
really good job of self-assessment early on makes the
decision apparent."
Interviews can be a large determining factor for many
students, she added. "Value-type questions can be answered
during interviews: Do I really want to be in New York?
Do I really want to work 70 hours per week?" ♦>
