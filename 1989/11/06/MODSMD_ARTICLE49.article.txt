### 
Counseling
Counselors are available to address the needs and concerns
of students on a one-to-one basis. Counselors are a resource
tool to help students: 1) assess their interests, skills and values;
2) identify their goals and objectives; 3) translate that infor
mation into a meaningful career; and 4) understand the nuts
and bolts of getting a job.
An appointment can be made with a counselor by calling
725-1789 or visiting the CPPC.
Internships and Part-time Jobs
The CPPC provides extensive information and resources on
internship opportunities, part-time academic year jobs and
full-time summer employment. Career advising is also available
to clarify academic and career goals and to integrate practical
work exposure with classroom experience.
Several internships are available for students: summer, stop
out, part-time, paid, credit, pay vs. credit or individually de
signed. Approximately 200-250 part-time employment oppor
tunities are listed with the CPPC per month. Several organi
zations recruit on campus through the CPPC for summer
programs and summer employment.
Job listings, internship announcements and other good job
search materials are available in the Career Resource Library
at the CPPC. Every Friday in The Daily, the CPPC provides
details about on-campus interviews, new job opportunities and
internship and summer job application deadlines.
