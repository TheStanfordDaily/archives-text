# Lawyer appointed safety head
## 
### Jock Friedly Editorial staff 
One week after the director
of Environmental Health and
Safety left her job, the Univer
sity has found a most unlikely
choice to take over as Stan
ford's top safety officer: a
lawyer.
Tom Mcßride, associate dean
of the Law School, will act as
director of Environmental
Health and Safety until a per
manent replacement is found.
The directorship was vacated
Wednesday by Carol Hoerner,
who had only held the post
since July. Hoerner cited her
overcommitment as the reason
for leaving the directorship.
Mcßride has had no previous
experience with campus safety
issues, but he has been a key
University leader, according to

Vice President for Administra
tive Resources Susan SchafTer.
"Tom has been with the Uni
versity for a while. He seems
to be a solid contributor,"
SchafTer said.
Mcßride was chosen for the
position in part because he has
extensive experience dealing
with governmental agencies,
she said. Since last spring, Uni
versity officials have spent long
hours dealing with the Depart
ment of Health Services. The
University also deals with nu
merous other governmental
agencies on the federal, state
and county levels.
For the next few weeks and
probably months, Mcßride will
be Stanford's top safety officer,
with the power to close down
any laboratory he determines
to be unsafe.
