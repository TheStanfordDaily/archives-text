# Chile program leaders confident Concerns about freedom, openness downplayed

### Geoff Goldman Staff writer 
The directors of the yet-to-be
opened Stanford overseas pro
gram in Chile remain confident
that their program will be a suc
cess despite concerns in the media
about the freedom and openness
of universities in Chile.
In a Nov. 1 article, the Chron
icle of Higher Education ex
pressed reservations about
whether professors in Chilean
universities are willing to discuss
and teach classes about controver
sial issues that have been

repressed in the past.
One professor in Chile is quoted
as saying, "Teachers still don't
like to teach certain subjects."
The article also states that a
"cloud of fear hangs over" Chilean
universities â€” a legacy from the
days of military government.
In addition, the article ques
tions the success of the upcoming
free elections in Chile and the
potential for a true return to de
mocracy. The article states that
the lack of open, intellectual dis
cussion may hinder the political
process.
Prof. Edmundo Fuenzalida, di

rector of the program in Chile,
disagrees with this assessment.
Although he said significant re
pression, censorship, and
intimidation have occurred in the
past, he said he believes that
Chilean universities are now in
the process of returning to a more
normal, open form of university
life.
The Stanford program in Chile
is not slated to begin until next
spring, after the elections take
place, according to Law Prof. Tom
Heller, director of Overseas
Studies.
Fuenzalida also noted that the
Catholic University in Chile was
chosen as the site of the program
partially because it is returning
to a system of free, open exchange
of ideas more quickly than many
of the other schools.
He believes that the era of in
tervention in universities has
ended and that academics have
returned to the major decision
making posts at Catholic Univer
sity.
In response to the criticism that
teachers in Chile are still too
afraid of the regime to carry on
an open exchange of ideas, Fuen
zalida said that many of the teach
ers who will be a part of Stanford's
program have always been out
spoken critics of the military
regime. Although these teachers
have not always had an easy life,
he said, "that is one of the reasons
we respect them so much."
Heller also mentioned the great
intellectual traditions of the Cath
olic University in Chile before the
military takeover. He said he
hopes it will return to its position
as the leading private institution
in Chile.
"The basis of the intellectual
life in Chile is in place," said Hel
ler. In the past year, he said, there
has been a flowering of intellec
tual discussion and exchange that
is "very positive."
Heller also emphasized that
Stanford's program could play an
important part in the return of
free exchange of ideas at Chilean
universities. While there will cer-

tainly be remnants of the repres
sion of intellectual exchange, the
development of the tenter will be
a part of the process of ending
these remnants.
Before the revolution, intellec
tual exchange between Stanford
and the Catholic University and
other organizations in Chile were
fairly common, and Heller said he
hopes that such cooperation will
begin to be re-established through
the Stanford program.
Fuenzalida feels that one of the
great benefits of the program is
the chance to experience the early
stages of change in Chile
firsthand. One of the course of
ferings of the Stanford program
is called "Transition to Democra
cy," and will trace the recent po
litical history of Chile
Other planned courses involve
the study of environmental prob
lems and the changing nature of
the economy in Latin America and
its relationship to the global eco
nomy.
