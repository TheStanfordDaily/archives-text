# New student quarterly for Soviets, Americans
## 
### Janine De Fao Senior staff writer 
What began last year as a small
flame guarded by a group of Pep
perdine University students has
sparked the creation of the first
Soviet-American student journal
â€” to be published at Stanford.
The journal, Montage, will be
"a forum for writing, photography
and artwork from throughout the
United States and the Soviet Un
ion," said junior Susan McKean,
one of Montage's co-publishers. It
will be published quarterly in
English and Russian and have a
circulation of 20,000 in each coun
try, McKean said.
Stanford is the publishing head
quarters for Montage. The mag
azine's editorial offices are also
located here, in the Knoll Annex.
In addition to McKean, its ed
itorial staff includes three Stan
ford students and an alumnus.
The American business office is
located at Pepperdine and the So
viet headquarters are in Moscow.
The project began last year
when a group of Pepperdine stu
dents came together in hopes of
bolstering Soviet-American rela
tions, according to Scott Talcott,
Pepperdine senior and co
publisher of Montage.
"We wrote a letter to Gorbachev
requesting a Soviet-American stu
dent conference, a monthly stu
dent newsletter, a yearlong
student exchange with Pepperdine
and a sister school," Talcott said.
"At the end we wrote that as
the flame burns at the Tomb of

the Unknown Soldier, we would
guard a flame until we received
a response. We stood guard over
the candle for 50 days. We never
heard from Gorbachev, but be
cause of the candle people knew
that I had an interest in the Soviet
Union and I was exposed to ideas
about lots of projects."
One of those projects was a
Soviet-American university news
paper exchange. Talcott quickly
contacted its coordinator,
Vladimir Tiurenkov, a graduate
student at the Institute for
Canadian and American Studies
in Moscow, who is currently
Montage's main Soviet contact.
Tiurenkov happened to be
leaving for a trip to the United
States in three days, and Pepper
dine's student government paid for
him to come to California.
During the visit, Talcott and
Tiurenkov discussed starting a
joint student publication through
an electronic mail system. In early
June, Talcott traveled to Moscow
where the Novosti Press Agency
agreed to help finance and spon
sor the journal.
Before his trip, Talcott called
The Daily and was put in contact
with McKean, who was then
managing editor. In August, they
traveled to Moscow with Scott
Kirk, a Stanford computer con
sultant, to try to establish a non
profit joint venture, McKean said.
The three brought computers
from Pepperdine and helped to
set up Montage's Soviet office.
