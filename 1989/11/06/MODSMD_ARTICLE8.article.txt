# New student quarterly for Soviets, Americans
## 
### Janine De Fao Senior staff writer 
What began last year as a small
flame guarded by a group of Pep
perdine University students has
sparked the creation of the first
Soviet-American student journal
— to be published at Stanford.
The journal, Montage, will be
"a forum for writing, photography
and artwork from throughout the
United States and the Soviet Un
ion," said junior Susan McKean,
one of Montage's co-publishers. It
will be published quarterly in
English and Russian and have a
circulation of 20,000 in each coun
try, McKean said.
Stanford is the publishing head
quarters for Montage. The mag
azine's editorial offices are also
located here, in the Knoll Annex.
In addition to McKean, its ed
itorial staff includes three Stan
ford students and an alumnus.
The American business office is
located at Pepperdine and the So
viet headquarters are in Moscow.
The project began last year
when a group of Pepperdine stu
dents came together in hopes of
bolstering Soviet-American rela
tions, according to Scott Talcott,
Pepperdine senior and co
publisher of Montage.
"We wrote a letter to Gorbachev
requesting a Soviet-American stu
dent conference, a monthly stu
dent newsletter, a yearlong
student exchange with Pepperdine
and a sister school," Talcott said.
"At the end we wrote that as
the flame burns at the Tomb of

the Unknown Soldier, we would
guard a flame until we received
a response. We stood guard over
the candle for 50 days. We never
heard from Gorbachev, but be
cause of the candle people knew
that I had an interest in the Soviet
Union and I was exposed to ideas
about lots of projects."
One of those projects was a
Soviet-American university news
paper exchange. Talcott quickly
contacted its coordinator,
Vladimir Tiurenkov, a graduate
student at the Institute for
Canadian and American Studies
in Moscow, who is currently
Montage's main Soviet contact.
Tiurenkov happened to be
leaving for a trip to the United
States in three days, and Pepper
dine's student government paid for
him to come to California.
During the visit, Talcott and
Tiurenkov discussed starting a
joint student publication through
an electronic mail system. In early
June, Talcott traveled to Moscow
where the Novosti Press Agency
agreed to help finance and spon
sor the journal.
Before his trip, Talcott called
The Daily and was put in contact
with McKean, who was then
managing editor. In August, they
traveled to Moscow with Scott
Kirk, a Stanford computer con
sultant, to try to establish a non
profit joint venture, McKean said.
The three brought computers
from Pepperdine and helped to
set up Montage's Soviet office.
Since that time, the Soviet and
American staffs have commun
icated through facsimile mac
hines. They have recently
established an electronic mail
hookup.
"All along, we haven't had been
connected through government
agencies. It's been student-to
student contact that has brought
us so far so fast. It's that dynamic
that will make it work," Talcott
said.
With technical logistics out of
the way, the editors of Montage,
both American and Soviet, must
come to an agreement on their
editorial philosophy.
"Students throughout the world
represent a class. There are cer
tain common interests regardless
of country," McKean said.
"Montage, as a student journal,
will serve as a voice of that class.
It will depict and examine,
through pictures and words, the
issues, movements and forces in
students' lives in both countries,"
she added.
According to American editor
Mark Weiner, "Montage is an ed
ucational publication. We will ed
ucate American students about
American students and Soviet stu
dents and vice versa." Weiner, who
graduated from Stanford in June
with a degree in American studies,
is also a former Books editor at
The Daily.
"We will raise consciousness of
what we have in common both
within and across Soviet-
American borders," Weiner said.
"We will approach issues in ways
they have not been approached
before and approach issues that
have not been approached before,"
he added.
"The text we publish should

reflect the diversity of the student
community in ethnicity, gender,
political opinion and class," he
said. "We want the text to be
serious and reflect serious analy
sis, but we also want to make
sure that its accessible," Weiner
said.
One way the journal will ensure
accessibility is through a glossary
that will define culturally specific
passages and allusions. The jour
nal will also print brief explana
tions of the historical or social
context of articles, so as to aid
readers unfamiliar with the ma
terial.
"We want Montage to appeal to
all students. Because of that con

cern, we don't want to explicitly
align ourselves with any specific
political group or set of ideas,"
Weiner said. "However, that
doesn't mean what we publish
won't be political. We're con
cerned with social and public is
sues, so we can't avoid politics."
"Montage will be an outlet for
both information and interpreta
tion. Students in both countries
will learn important facts about
life in both countries. I'd like
readers to come away saying that
they've really learned something,
been awakened to an idea or an
outlook on life that that helps
them better understand their sit
uation as students in our society

and as students internationally,"
Weiner said.
Following these goals, the tenta
tive theme for the first issue will
be the origin of identity, Weiner
said. The first publication is
scheduled for April. The 80-page
magazine will be published in
color and black and white.
"We don't even know what's hit
us as far as the changes in the
Soviet Union are concerned. I'm
looking forward to the magazine
coming out because I think it will
cement what the changes in the
Soviet Union mean to the Amer
ican student community, " Talcott
said.
