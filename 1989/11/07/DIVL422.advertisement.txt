MEASLES
As of 8/6/89, there had been an increase in
the number of cases in the US by 275%
compared to the 1988 totals. 70 colleges
and universities have reported cases of
measles already this year. The Immuniza
tion Committee of ACHA (Amencan
College Health Association) recently rec
ommended that all colleges now require
two doses of measles vaccine pnor to
college entry.
While not required by Stanford this fall, it is
strongly recommended that students bom
1957 or later who have not had a second
vaccination do so at Cowell as soon as
possible. The charge will be $20. No
appointment is needed.
Exception: students who have had a
measles vaccination at Cowell or else
where since 1979, need not have a
second shot.
