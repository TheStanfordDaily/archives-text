# Tresidder, USW exchange barbs
## 
### Michael Friedly Staff writer 
In a hostile exchange of name-calling
last week, Tresidder Memorial Union
management accused United Stanford
Workers field representative Rodney
Barnette of "harassment" of a Tresidder
manager.
A letter from Tresidder management
to Dean of Student Affairs James Lyons
said Barnette harassed Tresidder
Finance Manager Rae Hill when she
approached three workers to inform
them of other available University jobs
to which they could transfer.
The USW is currently embroiled in a
'dispute with Tresidder over last month's
decision to eliminate the positions of
three custodians in order to reduce its
$210,000 deficit.
Tresidder has come under increasing
pressure for its decision. The USW has
attempted to recruit both the Black Stu
dent Union and MEChA, the Chi
cano/Latino student group, to support
the custodians.
In addition, the University Grounds
Department circulated a petition to sup

port Jose Oropeza, one of the workers
whose job is being threatened.
According to USW Steward Linda
Crouse, Tresidder is trying to "divert
heat from the layoffs" by charging Bar
nette.
The incident referred to in the letter
to Lyons occurred during a discussion
between four Tresidder workers and
Barnette outside the upstairs Tresidder
administrative office. Hill approached
three of the workers to inform them of
other University jobs, according to the
letter.
Barnette challenged Hill's right to dis
cuss the issue directly with the workers,
insisting that each worker's case could
only be discussed with the direct super
visor or someone else in an "appropriate
position of authority," according to Bar
nette.
The management letter claimed that
when Hill attempted to enter the office,
Barnette accosted her, blocking her en
trance and demanding to know what
she thought of the USW. When Barnette
refused to move, Hill walked around
him and through the office doorway,
the letter said.

Barnette then allegedly proceeded to
forcibly gain entry to the office in order
to continue the discussion. Rita Marks,
a staff member in the office, came to
help Hill and told Barnette that he was
"out of line." Marks and Hill were both
"concerned that Barnette would become
violent," the letter said.
Hill was unavailable for comment yes
terday, and Marks refused to comment
on the incident.
The USW version of the incident was
very different from that of the manage
ment. Although Barnette agreed he had
asserted that Hill was not the proper
authority to advise the workers, he said
it was Hill who originally became upset.
"Ms. Hill began to raise her voice and
we had an exchange of words," he said
in a written response.
Hill then stormed into the office and
slammed the door in Barnette's face,
he said. Barnette, wishing to pursue
the discussion, tried to open the door,
not realizing that Hill was actually bar
ricading it with her body, Barnette said.
When Hill finally allowed Barnette
