## East Germans continue mass exodus, demonstrations 
### 
BERLIN (AP) — A half-million East Germans
thronged the streets of Leipzig in a hard, cold rain
last night to demand free elections and unlimited
freedom to travel abroad.
More than 135,000 people rallied in other cities,
including Schwerin, Halle, Cottbus, Dresden and
Karl-Marx-Stadt, the news agency reported.
While East Germans at home protested, mass
flight continued. The official news agency ADN said
23,200 citizens had gone to West Germany since
the suspension of exit rules Saturday.
Lutheran Church sources said some marchers in
Leipzig shouted "The Wall must go!" — demanding
demolition of the Berlin Wall, symbol of East Ger
man repression for three decades.
ADN said banners demanding "Free elections"
and "Travel law without restrictions" waved above
the crowd, and others challenged Communist Party
supremacy.
It said "several hundred thousand" people took
part in the biggest rally so far in Leipzig, where
some of the largest protests of the pro-democracy
campaign have been held.
Michael Turek, a Lutheran pastor in the southern
industrial city of 650,000, said by telephone about
500,000 people marched. A rally Saturday in East
Berlin, where the crowd was estimated at 1 million,
was the largest protest in the communist nation's
40-year history.
Protests have become Monday night events in
Leipzig. Crowds at the last two were estimated at
300,000.
Dresden's march was authorized by authorities
and led by Mayor Wolfgang Berghofer and the
reform-minded local party chief, Hans Modrow.
ADN said it was the first officially approved dem
onstration in the city.

Earlier yesterday, the government published a
new draft law that is expected to take effect before
Christmas and will permit travel abroad for up to
30 days a year.
This year about 175,000 East Germans — more
than 1 percent of the population — have moved to
West Germany by emigrating legally, escaping or
failing to return from approved trips abroad. West
Germany gives them automatic citizenship and help
in starting over.
Although the new law would allow travel abroad,
East Germans pointed out it retains old provisions
giving authorities the right to refuse passports for
vague reasons.
It also does not address the problem of financing
such travel. The East German mark is not convert
ible and lack of foreign currency could make a legal
trip impossible.
East Germans poured into Czechoslovakia after
their government lifted a month-old ban on travel
to the neighboring Warsaw Pact ally, still the only
nation East Germans can visit without official per
mission.
By the time the ban was removed, 5,000 East
Germans had gathered at the West German Em
bassy in Prague. Special trains took the East Ger
mans from the embassy to the West German border
and thousands of others drove through Czechoslo
vakia in personal cars.
A line of cars 400 yards long waited at the Schirnd
ing crossing into northeastern Bavaria. To leave
Czechoslovakia, refugees were required only to show
their East German identity cards.
The unexpected decision to let the refugees out
through Czechoslovakia created the first direct route
to the West since the Berlin Wall was built in August
1961. Authorities have said the route will remain
open until the travel law takes effect.
