# Jamaica's Prime Minister Manley calls for U.N. drug force

WASHINGTON (AP) - Jamaican
Prime Minister Michael Manley yesterday
renewed his call for a United Nations
force to combat drug cartel terrorism,
but said the idea lacks the political sup
port to become a reality in the year ahead.
"I make no bones about where our
motivation begins," Manley said as he
arrived at the Senate Judiciary Commit
tee to push for an eight-point anti
narcotics program. "I am not able to
conceive of a society that is worth build
ing or worth having on the basis of a

drug culture."
Manley planned to meet after the
Judiciary Committee session with Vice
President Dan Quayle at the White
House. He said it would be "too ambi
tious" to expect administration support
for a multinational narcotics strike force.
Manley said one stopgap solution could
be an intelligence and training center
sponsored by the Organization of Amer
ican States to fight the drug scourge
while building support for the idea of a
U.N. paramilitary force.

"It isn't a regional problem, it's an
international problem," he said.
Manley said it was possible to galvanize
international action sioon on seven of the
points in his anti-drug plan. The package
includes a central intelligence-gathering
system, a school for narcotics agents and
an international reserve pool of narcotics
agents and intelligence operatives.
Manley said the seven other pieces of
the package were actually more impor
tant than the proposed paramilitary
force, which has gotten the most atten

tion.
In coming to the Judiciary Committee
to drum up support, Manley was preach
ing to a receptive audience. Chairman
Joseph R. Biden Jr., D-Del., is one of the
leading congressional supporters of es
tablishing a multinational force.
"The strike force plan could turn the
rhetoric about apprehending drug
kingpins into a reality â€” and yet to my
amazement we have not had a firm rec
ommendation by the administration on
this plan," Biden told the hearing.

Manley said there was skepticism
toward the idea among heads of a number
of governments who have grave doubts
about allowing foreign troops on their
soil, even by invitation and under U.N.
auspices.
He likened such a force to ones estab
lished a decade ago to fight airplane
hijackers and urban guerrillas in West
Germany and Italy. The unit, Manley
said, would be used where drug lords
"create a terror in society and break its
will to fight them."
