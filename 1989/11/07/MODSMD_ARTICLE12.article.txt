# Peace accord stalled

I BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) â€” A
; strike called by Gen. Michel Aoun,
the Christian army commander,
virtually closed down east Beirut
yesterday and his followers filled
the streets to protest the election
of a Syrian-backed president.
Rioting Aoun loyalists stormed
the residence of Nasrallah Sfeir,
the Maronite Catholic patriarch,
who supported Rene Mouawad's
election as president Sunday, and
forced him to kiss a portrait of
the general. Mouawad, 64, and
Aoun, 54, are Maronites, the main
Christian sect in Lebanon.
Aoun declared a "war of liber
ation" this year on the 40,000
Syrian soldiers stationed in
Lebanon under a 1976 peacekeep
ing mandate from the Arab
League. He issued a statement
Monday urging supporters to
"limit your protests to civilized
and peaceful methods."

On Saturday, Aoun said he was
dissolving the legislature. He and
acting Prime Minster Salim Hoss
have led rival Christian and Mos
lem governments for 14 months,
since President Amin Gemayel's
six-year term ended without
agreement by Parliament on a suc
cessor.
The new president, a moderate
lawyer, met yesterday with spiri
tual leaders and politicians to try
to form a national reconciliation
government capable of ending the
14-year-old civil war.
Arab states and several Western
nations welcomed his election, in
cluding the Gulf Cooperation
Council of Saudi Arabia, Kuwait,
Qatar, Oman, Bahrain and the
United Arab Emirates. Foreign
ministers of the 12-nation Euro
pean Community congratulated
Mouawad and urged that foreign
armies withdraw from Lebanon.
