Immigration law challenged
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - Saying they
wanted to go "beyond cold, hard facts," two
civil rights groups yesterday issued a report
that zeroes in on the human problems
caused by discrimination allegedly stemming
from the 1986 U.S. immigration law.
The report contends that threatening em
ployers with fines and other sanctions for
hiring undocumented workers has resulted
in widespread job discrimination against
foreign-speaking and even "foreign-looking"
people.
Drug lord arraigned

tion hearing held at the Federal Correctional

Illinois on cocaine indictments.
Abortion law reviewed
SACRAMENTO (AP) â€” Forty-seven Cal
ifornia legislators are urging state Supreme
Court review of a ruling that permits
children to get abortions without parental
consent.
The letter urges the governor to ask direct
state attorneys to appeal the Oct. 13 decision
by the First District Appellate Court to let

stand a two-year injunction imposed by the
San Francisco County Superior Court
against the enforcement of a state law re
quiring parental consent for abortions on
minor children.
Too much time on the Farm?
WASHINGTON (AP) - The White House
poked fun at former Secretary of State
George P. Shultz yesterday suggesting that
the United States should consider legalizing
cocaine and other drugs.
"Whoa, he's been out on the West Coast
too long, hasn't he?" quipped Press Secre
tary Marlin Fitzwater. "The guy slips into
retirement and right away he starts saying
things that are strange."
Shultz's views on legalizing drugs were
published in The Wall Street Journal Oct.
27 in an adaptation of remarks he made to
an alumni gathering at the Stanford Busi
ness School in Palo Alto, Calif., on Oct. 7.
