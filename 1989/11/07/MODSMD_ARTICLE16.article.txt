STANFORD IS broadening its
bases rapidly, with the recent
expansion of the Overseas
study program. And to add to this
international representation, Stan
ford has recently signed an agree
ment with the Italian firm,
Finmeccanica, to share research re
sources.
The firm provides a $600,000
endowed chair and Stanford pro
vides on a two to four year rotating
basis a professor in the Engineer
ing or Economics Department.
Finmeccanica plans to keep in
close touch with the professor's
work and will fly the professor to
Italy every one or two years to
share information with the firm's
own research departments. How
ever, the company is not able to
choose what the study entails.
The close contact with the Ital
ian firm should give the professor
a better international perspective
which is very important as eco
nomic boundaries continue to
erode, and we move closer to a
truly global economy.

Stanford is clearly committed to
creating internationally-aware stu
dents. It is good to see that the
faculty is also benefiting from this
attitude.
Further, partnerships between
business and universities should be
fostered to allow professors to
check their theoretical work
against the empirical world.
However, Stanford should be
careful not to be taken advantage
of by private industry. The busi
ness could be buying a talented
Stanford researcher for less than
a consultant in the private market.
And don't forget about the 80
percent of each research dollar
which goes to overhead at Stan
ford. Private firms could be elim
inating their own overhead costs
by jobbing out research to the
America's elite universities.
But as long as these financial
concerns are adhered to by the cost
accountants, Stanford should push
ahead with any future interna
tional plan, to forge a truly inter
national Stanford.
