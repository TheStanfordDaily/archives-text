# Planting oak trees
## 
### 
O PLANT a tree.
.y For the next three Satur-
days, the Peninsula ReLeaf
project will be looking for a few
good botany buffs to plant oak
seedlings in the Foothills.
Under contract to the Stanford
Planning Office, the Palo Alto
based organization Magic has
sponsored the reforestation project
for the past five years to combat
the rapid decline in the area's oak
population.
The trees were disappearing be
cause of human development and
cattle and rodents who like to eat

acorns and young seedlings.
Besides the beauty that they add
to a jog or a picnic by the Dish,
trees play an important role in
combating the greenhouse effect
and resultant global warming.
Trees absorb carbon dioxide, a gas
that accounts for 50 percent of the
greenhouse problem.
To date, the project's 450 volun
teers have planted nearly 1,000
trees and they intend to plant thou
sands more in the next decade.
To reach this goal, the project
needs volunteers. No horticultural
experience necessary.
