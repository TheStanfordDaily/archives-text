## Animal research pays off 
### 
I BELIEVE WE should stop all AIDS
research this second. What right do
we have to infect chimps and rats
with AIDS in the vain hope of curing an
epidemic for which humans are to blame?
We should stop cancer research, also.
Why? Because we're killing animals in
the process. What right do we humans
have to torture and infect animals for
our own purposes? Dogs and rats have
feelings, too. They have our same desire
to live. Every time my poodle Bagel hears
of another of his species dead, he cries
for hours on end.
Wait. . . wait. Are those tears of pain
in Bagel's eyes, or is he just washing out
specks of dirt? Can Bagel really feel for
his peers or himself? Hmm . . . maybe
dogs and rats are just tools put here for
human use.
Besides, we raise these animals; there
fore, we have the right to do whatever
we want with them. It's just survival of
the fittest, plain and simple. When the
animals figure out how to put us in cages
and do tests on us, let them.
Animal rights is a difficult issue, and
above I have presented the obnoxious
extremes. What I find amazing is the
momentum currently being carried by
many animal rights movements. In 1987,
animal rights wasn't even a subtopic in
the good old Readers' Guide.
Now, there are several articles listed
under it each month. Groups like the
Animal Liberation Front (ALF) and True
Friends periodically raid laboratories to
free experimental animals.
This is a far cry from the animal wel
fare groups which started in the 1960s
to reform laws to avoid cruel treatment

of animals. This new animal rights move
ment is a little cheesy to me. It seems
like we're trying to superimpose human
values and feelings on animals who don't
care.
Although many consider animal rights
to be a liberal issue, it probably has the
highest crossover rate of any political
topic.
Yes, the same people who brought you
the anti-abortion and pro-death penalty
movement, those same people who spend
$1,000 dollars to cure Fifi's asthma, take
this one liberal issue as their moral stand.
I take animal welfare as a moral stand,
also. What right do we have to interfere
with animals in nature, to take their fur
or use them for trophies?
But animal research is another issue
entirely. Animal rights activists believe
that an animal's life is just as sacred as
a human's. Yet, our whole society is based
on the drugs and. therapies which we
have developed with animals.
Some would argue that life-extending
research is useless. We should just let
things take their natural course. How
ever, would these same people turn down
a dose of penicillin which would save
their lives even if the penicillin were de
veloped at the cost of many animals'
lives?
Sure, we can try to provide better con
ditions for lab animals, but radical groups
such as ALF are scaring people away
from animal research.
Researchers are not spendthrifts who
can cut back a little on reagents to provide
better living conditions for their animals.
Cutting back on AIDS research is as bad
as stopping it all together. Science is an

all-or-nothing endeavor.
By destroying laboratories and freeing
animals, ALF is polarizing many scien
tists' attitudes. Now, scientists are afraid
to ameliorate their treatment of animals
in fear of admitting guilt. Further, ALF
may unknowingly be releasing cancerous
and AIDS-infected animals to the streets.
Granted, it is sad when you see a video
of a cat undergoing neurological testing
with wires in its brain. But seeing
humans starve and knowing that the
average American housecat receives more
meat than the average person in Central
America is sad, too.. t . Â«
Stanford students .can be glad that our
school is doing all we can to instill animal
welfare values in biologists. A Biology
44X student can expect to write a two
page paper to explain the death of any
organism in the infamous "goldfish lab."
But animal rights activists think that
any death is one too many.
My advice to these animal rights ac
tivists? Take a few biology classes, divert
your efforts to human rights, hug your
' teddy bear and realize that the animal
' rights movement (as opposed to animal
welfare movements) is a luxury we cannot
afford.
