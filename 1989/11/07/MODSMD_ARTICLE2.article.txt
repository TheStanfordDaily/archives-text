# Stanford to get $5M in quake relief
## Deukmejian signs bill earmarking aid for non-profit organizations 
### Cecilia Tom Staff writer 
Gov. George Deukmejian signed a bill
yesterday making private non-profit or
ganizations, including Stanford, eligible
for state earthquake relief funds.
The bill's success was in part due to
the lobbying endeavors of Stanford's
Acting Vice President for Public Affairs
Larry Horton and General Counsel
John Schwartz, who spent several days
last week in the state capital.
Horton and Schwartz returned to
campus yesterday with news that the
University will receive earthquake relief
funds of at least $5 million from the
state. It is possible this amount will be
greater if there is sufficient funding.

In addition, Stanford is eligible for
funds appropriated by the Federal
Emergency Management Act, according
to Horton. Stanford's most recent esti
mate for damages sustained during the
7.1-magnitude Oct. 17 earthquake was
$160 million.
During a special state legislative
meeting last Thursday, Friday and Sat
urday in Sacramento, the Senate and
the Assembly passed 12 earthquake
related bills, including one which dealt
specifically with giving private non
profit organizations state earthquake
relief assistance.
The relief package will consist of 75
percent federal funds and 25 percent
state funds. If funding is insufficient to
pay for all legitimate claims, non-profit
organizations are eligible to claim up

to $5 million. If funds are sufficient,
however, there will not be a limit to
the claims, Horton said.
"In other words, Stanford will claim
for (Federal Emergency Management
Act) funds to the extent that we are
eligible," Horton explained. "We will be
eligible to an additional 25 percent from
the state, up to $5 million in the case
of insufficient funds."
When an earthquake last hit in Whit
tier, Calif., USC and Whittier College
received similar state assistance. How
ever, because that law only applies to
the Whittier earthquake, a new bill had
to be drawn up to assist private non
profit organizations affected by the Oct.
17 earthquake.
