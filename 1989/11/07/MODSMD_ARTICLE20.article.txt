## Research lab treats animals with compassion 
### 
IN RESPONSE TO the letter writ
ten to your editor by life science
technician Deborah Britt concerning
our dog Rosie, we feel that our side
should also be presented.
First and foremost, Britt in no way,
shape or manner represents the ideals,
beliefs or emotions of the veterinary
care staff of the Department of Lab
Animal Medicine here at Stanford.
All of us were deeply concerned
about and loved Rosie very much. She
was a wonderful companion to us and
a joy when we needed comforting;
however, when you are involved in
medical research, as we are, there are
sometimes sad situations that we do
have to deal with in a professional and
mature manner.
We must always remember the end

results and the new methods, cures
and lessening of pain and suffering
that is accomplished by our work â€” to
better the existence of mankind.
Rosie was a boxer-pit bull mix who
was devoted to the people that she
knew. However there was a side to
Rosie that a few strangers did encoun
ter. Rosie was known as a "fear biter";
meaning that in a new or unfamiliar
situation which caused her fear she
could respond by biting.
Due to this uncertainty, we under
stand why placing her for adoption
could have had disastrous results. Our
department adoption program has so
far placed 37 dogs, 59 cats, nine rab
bits, seven guinea pigs, one mouse, five
rats and one calf in new homes. If our
administration were as heartless as

Britt has mentioned then would this
adoption program be so successful or
even allowed?
Perhaps the reason that no one else
on our staff placed a request for the
adoption of Rosie is that there was
that slight doubt in our minds and a
concern for the safety of others.
We also need to remember that
Rosie was initially purchased to be
used in a cardiovascular study and the
administration granted our request to
keep Rosie as our companion on the
night shifts. By doing this, her life was
extended an additional four years.
We sincerely hope that this matter is
over and we can all get on with our
lives, and also that the public will
realize that as veterinary nurses we

chose to work with Stanford and the
Department of Lab Animal Medicine
because of its high standards and
because our facility is perhaps the
finest anywhere due to the efforts of
our Dr. Tom Hamm and his adminis
trators who are very caring and sup
portive people.
