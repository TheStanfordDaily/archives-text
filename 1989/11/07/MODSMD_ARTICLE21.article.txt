# Student distressed by ignorance and apathy at Stanford
## 
### 
When Zulu Spear called for a free
South Africa at the Sigma Nu Safari
party Saturday night, the crowd
cheered. Of course, being here at this
institution of higher learning, we can
expect a socially conscious student body
that is concerned with today's
issues.
But this kind of zeal leaves me with
something to be desired. It isn't that I
think that apartheid is a good system,
but I can't help feeling that this en
thusiasm is somewhat hypocritical.
While anyone can go to a concert and
cheer for the latest causes, how many
of these "supporters" actually do any
thing to help them?
I do realize that there are a signifi
cant number of students who are com

mitted to community service and other
causes, political and otherwise. I ad
mire them for their dedication.
But here I am, a freshman, in the
first quarter of my first year, already
feeling frustrated by what seems to be
the mentality of the majority of the
student body. Stanford is supposed to
be one of the finest universities in the
world, but I sometimes feel awash in a
sea of apathy.
At my upper-middle class, suburban,
sheltered high school, ignorance was
the excuse for indifference. But here,
where we are considered to be among
the brightest, most well-educated of
our generation, how can we plead ig
norance?
Instead of this latest trend of
pseudo-activism and awareness, could
we have a little more genuine concern
and commitment? Perhaps we'll find
that spending an afternoon at a soup
kitchen, giving up an hour one evening
to attend a meeting of one of the
campus's many admirable organizations
or just sitting down for a few minutes

to write a letter with Amnesty could
have more impact than any amount of
howls and catcalling.
