# Union members seek support for fellow worker
## 
### 
The University groundskeepers and
gardeners wish to state our support for
our fellow groundakeeper Jos6 Oropeza
and to protest Tresidder Union's cal
lous treatment of him. We are outraged
at their treatment of a senior worker.
After many years of service, Tresid
der plans to demote Jos6 to a cus
todian, telling him he will have to
work in the middle of the night and
that his work will go to the grounds
keepers in the Grounds Department.
The work is still there, so there is no

economic justification to take it away
from Jos6.
We petition the Grounds Department
not to take this work from Jos6 until
he is situated fairly. As members of
the United Stanford Workers, we will
not allow Tresidder to put us against a
union brother. Jos6 would do no less
for us.
We also petition the University and
community to use whatever resources
it has to get Tresidder to straighten
this out and treat Jos6 with the
decency he deserves.
