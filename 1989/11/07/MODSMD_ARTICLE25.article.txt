## Media must learn to 'bear witness to the truth' 
### 
WHILE I WAS an intern for the
editorial board of the San Jose
Mercury News, one of the
writers there told me to "never lose
your sense of moral outrage." As those
who know me can attest, 1 have always
followed that advice.
It is my sense of moral outrage
which demands that I speak out
against the destruction of the truth
that has occurred in the Louis Jackson
case.
Newspapers are one of the most
critical institutions to the health and
maintenance of a democracy. The
media should serve as watchdogs of the
institutions which run society.
At least, that's how it's supposed to
work. Recently, I have been shocked
and horrified to watch history being
rewritten before our eyes about what
really happened last May 15.
Newspaper and television reporters
from across the Bay Area covered the
events of the day, documented the
proceedings and conveyed their percep
tion of the truth to their respective
readers and viewers. How did reality

look that day to them, while the
images were fresh in the mind?
The San Francisco Chronicle re
ported that, "the peaceful demonstra
tion began to heat up around 4 p.m.
when sheriff's deputies in full riot
gear, with masks pulled down, moved
in and began making arrests."
The consensus of the day was that
student frustrations about the pace of
multicultural change had reached such
a boiling point that dozens of Stanford
students had been driven to occupy the
President's office.
That was the truth in the spring. In
the fall, however, students returned to
an entirely different reality as defined
by the district attorney. No longer do
we have a responsible, although contro
versial, student demonstration born out
of legitimate frustration at what Uni
versity President Donald Kennedy
himself termed, "the glacial pace of
progress."
The new reality is that there was a
raucous riot led by a dangerous black
radical who battered a secretary.
What is the truth? In the spring, he

was "Lou-Your Buddy in the Senate,"
a 5T\ 129 pound fun-loving and
committed Stanford student who re
ceived the fourth highest number of
votes in the ASSU Senate elections.
In the fall, he is a dangerous
militant who incites riots, obstructs
police justice and engages in "illegal
touching" of white secretaries (as the
district attorney so provocatively
phrased it).
After the demonstrations in Tianan
men Square in China last June, the
American media was harshly critical of
the efforts of the Chinese government
to convince the Chinese people that
the protesting students were counter
revolutionaries who wanted to over
throw the government.
But what happens in our own coun
try when a new version of reality —
remarkably similar to the one that
emerged in China — is spread as the
truth?
The district attorney says there was
a riot and battery and all manner of
unlawful acts. Kennedy tells the frosh
to "harbor a healthy mistrust" of those

who espouse "correct politics."
To the eye of this writer, I see
dangerous parallels between what is
going on here and what happens in
countries which have much less of a
democratic tradition than ours. But
that is not what troubles me the most.
I have come to expect the authorities
in this country to practice hypocrisy
and deception, especially when it in
volves black people. What concerns me
the most is the lack of moral outrage
by the so-called guardians of democra
cy. Only JefT Gottlieb of the Mercury
News has come close to keeping faith
with the truth when he wrote in his
June column, "A Stanford University
sophomore has been charged with
inciting to riot — even though there
was no rioting."
That article was in the best tradition
of keeping alive the flame of truth and
contrasting revised accounts of reality
with what is really the truth.
Many people think that Jackson was
arrested on the same day as the other
55 arrestees and that he was basically
doing what the other protesters were.

Few people understand that he was
singled out and arrested three and a
half weeks later on the basis of police
videotapes, nor that he did not do any
of the acts that caused the other
protesters to be arrested and charged.
These are important facts that the
people deserve to know. The late
James Baldwin, my all-time favorite
writer, said that his duty as a writer
was to "bear witness to the truth."
Kennedy has said that the purpose of
a university is to discover the truth.
I challenge all writers and all mem
bers of this institution to rediscover
and steadfastly defend the truth of
what happened on May 15. A young
man's freedom and the integrity of our
institution are at stake.

arrested on the same day as the other
55 arrestees and that he was basically
doing what the other protesters were.

Few people understand that he was
singled out and arrested three and a
half weeks later on the basis of police
videotapes, nor that he did not do any
of the acts that caused the other
protesters to be arrested and charged.
These are important facts that the
people deserve to know. The late
James Baldwin, my all-time favorite
writer, said that his duty as a writer
was to "bear witness to the truth."
Kennedy has said that the purpose of
a university is to discover the truth.
I challenge all writers and all mem
bers of this institution to rediscover
and steadfastly defend the truth of
what happened on May 15. A young
man's freedom and the integrity of our
institution are at stake.

WHILE I WAS an intern for the
editorial board of the San Jose
Mercury News, one of the
writers there told me to "never lose
your sense of moral outrage." As those
who know me can attest, 1 have always
followed that advice.
It is my sense of moral outrage
which demands that I speak out
against the destruction of the truth
that has occurred in the Louis Jackson
case.
Newspapers are one of the most
critical institutions to the health and
maintenance of a democracy. The
media should serve as watchdogs of the
institutions which run society.
At least, that's how it's supposed to
work. Recently, I have been shocked
and horrified to watch history being
rewritten before our eyes about what
really happened last May 15.
Newspaper and television reporters
from across the Bay Area covered the
events of the day, documented the
proceedings and conveyed their percep
tion of the truth to their respective
readers and viewers. How did reality

look that day to them, while the
images were fresh in the mind?
The San Francisco Chronicle re
ported that, "the peaceful demonstra
tion began to heat up around 4 p.m.
when sheriff's deputies in full riot
gear, with masks pulled down, moved
in and began making arrests."
The consensus of the day was that
student frustrations about the pace of
multicultural change had reached such
a boiling point that dozens of Stanford
students had been driven to occupy the
President's office.
That was the truth in the spring. In
the fall, however, students returned to
an entirely different reality as defined
by the district attorney. No longer do
we have a responsible, although contro
versial, student demonstration born out
of legitimate frustration at what Uni
versity President Donald Kennedy
himself termed, "the glacial pace of
progress."
The new reality is that there was a
raucous riot led by a dangerous black
radical who battered a secretary.
What is the truth? In the spring, he

was "Lou-Your Buddy in the Senate,"
a 5T\ 129 pound fun-loving and
committed Stanford student who re
ceived the fourth highest number of
votes in the ASSU Senate elections.
In the fall, he is a dangerous
militant who incites riots, obstructs
police justice and engages in "illegal
touching" of white secretaries (as the
district attorney so provocatively
phrased it).
After the demonstrations in Tianan
men Square in China last June, the
American media was harshly critical of
the efforts of the Chinese government
to convince the Chinese people that
the protesting students were counter
revolutionaries who wanted to over
throw the government.
But what happens in our own coun
try when a new version of reality —
remarkably similar to the one that
emerged in China — is spread as the
truth?
The district attorney says there was
a riot and battery and all manner of
unlawful acts. Kennedy tells the frosh
to "harbor a healthy mistrust" of those

who espouse "correct politics."
To the eye of this writer, I see
dangerous parallels between what is
going on here and what happens in
countries which have much less of a
democratic tradition than ours. But
that is not what troubles me the most.
I have come to expect the authorities
in this country to practice hypocrisy
and deception, especially when it in
volves black people. What concerns me
the most is the lack of moral outrage
by the so-called guardians of democra
cy. Only JefT Gottlieb of the Mercury
News has come close to keeping faith
with the truth when he wrote in his
June column, "A Stanford University
sophomore has been charged with
inciting to riot — even though there
was no rioting."
That article was in the best tradition
of keeping alive the flame of truth and
contrasting revised accounts of reality
with what is really the truth.
Many people think that Jackson was
arrested on the same day as the other
55 arrestees and that he was basically
doing what the other protesters were.

Few people understand that he was
singled out and arrested three and a
half weeks later on the basis of police
videotapes, nor that he did not do any
