## Stanford graduate succeeds with acclaimed thesis film 
### Siddhartha Mukherjee 
Entitled "Living With AIDS,"
the film is the story of the last
six weeks of AIDS victim Todd
Coleman's life, documenting inter
actions with Coleman's lover and
his support group of professionals
and volunteers. The film is con
structed to present different points
of view, according to DiFelician
tonio, and reveals itself as each
character is introduced in sepa
rate sequences.
"Living With AIDS" revolves
around Todd's life and his con
cerns as a person with AIDS. But
it also is a film about the other

"Suddenly we understood the
magnitude of what we were shoot
ing. We were shooting the last six
weeks of his life."
For Tina DiFeliciantonio, inde
pendent filmmaker and Stanford
graduate, these words convey a
depth of emotion. DiFeliciantonio,
who received a masters in com
munication from Stanford's doc
umentary film program in 1987,
directed and produced a documen
tary on the life of a person with
AIDS for her masters thesis.

people who enter or affect Todd's
life, interacting with him on a
personal and professional level.
According to DiFeliciantonio,
there "was something exceptional
in the story of Todd Coleman's
life. At 21, diagnosed with AIDS,
Todd was learning to live in the
shadow of terminal disease." It
was this most sensitive period of
his life that DiFeliciantonio traced
on camera, to produce an aching,
acclaimed film.
"Living With AIDS" was recog
nized internationally as one of the
most powerful media presenta
tions of its kind. Among the
various awards it has won are the
National Emmy for Outstanding
News and Documentary Program,
the Student Academy Award from
the Academy of Motion Picture
Arts and Sciences, the Student
Emmy for Best Student Documen
tary, the Silver Plaque at the
Chicago International Film Festi
val and the Silver Apple at the
National Educational Film Festi
val.
The documentary has been
broadcast nationally on PBS, on
European public television in
Sweden and in Italy, and has been
released in national theaters in
West Germany, Switzerland and
England. The film has also been
screened in conferences in Yugos
lavia and France.
Critics rave about this student
produced effort. The Los Angeles
Times called it a "sensitive, mov
ing film." The Bay Area Reporter
called it "a powerful addition to
the burgeoning body of work on
the subject." And according to
The Advocate, "DiFeliciantonio
deserves praise for avoiding the
all-too-common style for teary
eyed tales. She defiantly ap
proaches the subject in a
no-nonsense way to demystify the
disease and concentrate on the
person. ..."
The recipient of such praise
doesn't seem all too fazed by fame.
DiFeliciantonio, a busi
ness/humanities communication
graduate from Drexel University,
arrived in the Bay Area in 1984
to accept a fellowship in Stan
ford's Masters Film Program. In
making the switch from Philadel
phia to San Francisco, DiFelician
tonio was struck by the impact
of the AIDS issue here. "I was
hard hit," she said. "I wasn't com
fortable with the way the media

lived. The house is still there. I am still
here, too, but he isn't.'

was handling AIDS ... as a
filmmaker I wanted to react to
this personally."
Her thesis film was the direct
result of this reaction. "But I had
to do a lot of begging" to get
funding for the project, she em
phasized. "In fact, as a new
filmmaker I had to beg (for
money) for two years."
With no previous track record,
no experience and with many
other AIDS agencies competing
for money, raising the required
funds for the project was no
simple task. DiFeliciantonio man
aged to scrape together the funds
from "various sources" such as
the Pioneer Fund, the Chicago
Resource Center and the Louis De
Malle Foundation, but ended up

in debt herself.
Her film crew consisted mostly
of students from Stanford's grad
uate film program. The only pro
fessional in the crew — Frances
Reid — is a well-known
cinematographer. DiFeliciantonio
did all the directing, producing
and editing.
Speaking about how she han
dled a theme as sensitive as AIDS
on camera, DiFeliciantonio simply
said, "We gave everyone on screen,
especially Todd, a lot of control.
We tried to listen to what his
needs were and what concerned
him. We also gave him the option
to cut and to ask us to shut off
the cameras. We were extremely
sensitive to his physical and emo
tional needs and respected them

in every part of the film."
According to DiFeliciantonio,
the film was much more than a
professional experience — it was
also a personal one. "I felt a lot
of guilt," she said. "Here I was
with an enormous potential to do
(the film) I wanted to do and in
contrast, I could see Todd's per
sonal world."
The fact that Todd and the film
crew belonged to the same age
group intensified the film-making
experience even more, she said. "I
didn't challenge him like a 33-
year-old male might do, and that
reflected an empathy I had . . .
(In making the film,) "I just
wanted to map one person's ex
perience and tell the story of his
life."
Asked about reflecting on her
film, DiFeliciantonio said she
doesn't "approach her work by
looking back." But the film did
and will always have a haunting
effect on her life. "The other day
I passed by where Todd lived. The
house is still there. I am still here,
too, but he isn't."

shot.
Ultimately, however, the film
making process was "an enriching
experience rather than a distress
ing one, even though it generated
a lot of emotions. I wish I could
say it was more exciting though.
It was such a nightmare being in
debt. I am really glad it gave
people a vision and won recogni
tion in its own way."
Thus, in the midst of interna
tional acclaim, DiFeliciantonio
feels it is "time to move on." For
her next project, DiFeliciantonio
is working as an associate pro
ducer on a film called "Jazz,"
which is based on the life of jazz
idol Maxine Sullivan.
DiFeliciantonio can give an
amusing description of life as a
filmmaker. "It is an interesting
life, though sometimes it is really
grueling. I have explored ice
caves, had lunch in a New York
subway, toured in Sing-Sing."
She is a fiercely independent
filmmaker, however — "at what
ever cost." She runs her own pro
duction company, called Naked
Eye Productions, rather than af
filiate herself with any studio. She
works on a project-by-project
basis.
Making the documentary
"Living With AIDS" was, for
DiFeliciantonio, an "amazing and
enriching experience." Her final
words of advice for potential film
makers are three short, pragmatic
sentences that summarize her per
sonal learning through filmmak
ing. They are: "It's a tough
business. Don't expect anything.
And work for it."
