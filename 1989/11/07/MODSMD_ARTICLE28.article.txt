# Stanford fencing: It's not just for fun anymore
## 
### Marli Marinelli 
"Fencing is one of the few sports that
doesn't require any freakish body type,"
according to Stanford fencing instructor
Sherry Posthumus. "All you need is a good
mind."
While the good mind may be out of your
range, your body and any body can fence.
Each year at Stanford, around 400 students
(with normal and freakish bodies) take
fencing for recreational purposes. Accord
ing to Posthumus, these are the reasons
why:
1. You get to wield fun weapons. Swords
range from the foil, which has the
flexibility of a food service carrot, to the
ep£e, which is a little sturdier, to the
saber, your honest-to-goodness, Captain
Hook weapon. Broader and flatter than
the foil or ep6e, the sturdy saber gleams
wickedly and makes that fulfilling clank
ing noise upon contact.
2. Not only do you get to hold these
beauties, but you get to wave them
around, aim and, indeed, lunge at your
opponent with the sharp weaponry. It's
a dream come true. Release your aggres
sions; let that sadist in you come out,
but in the refined and graceful manner
of a top fencer.
3. You get to wear spanking white jackets,
sturdy masks that make you look like a
hornet-exterminator, and a leather glove,
crusty from protecting hundreds of
sweaty, bacteria-filled palms. If you get
to be really good, you can join the Stan
ford fencing team and get electrical ap
paratus rigged to your body. (Who says
fencing can't be an electrifying experi
ence?) Professional fencing matches are
monitored through the electrical contact
between the sword (which has a cord
running through it) and your lam 6
jacket. Yes, you, the stylish fencer, could

wear a gold lam 6 jacket that will surely
complete your "dressed to kill" image!
4. You can fool close friends and family
with your mastery of European fencing
terms. Drop words like "en garde, remise
and parry" while you're in your favorite
French restaurant. Scream "Riposte!"
when you see your friend and impress
the people around you with your vogue
greeting. It doesn't matter that these
are only complex fencing terms. If you
can get the accent haughty enough,
people will think you are cultured and
will want to be your friend.
5. You can use fencing to help you acquire
the grace and finesse you desire. This
dexterity is unlike ballet, which forces
you to twist your body into impossible,
Gumby-like positions. Your body was
simply not made to contort in grotesque
angles. Fencing will enable you to un
derstand and control your body with a
minimum of pulled muscles and liga
ments.
6. You can protect your honor, or what's
left of it, by challenging an offender to
a duel. Whether the incident was minor
or they ran over your foot in White
Plaza, preserve your dignity by throwing
down the gauntlet.
7. You can fulfill your desire to play out
the intense fencing scenes from the movie
"Princess Bride." Posthumus com
mented, "Once 'Princess Bride' came out,
the fencing classes filled up very quick
ly... people come into the classes with
very strange ideas." Not only can you
fantasize about being a movie character,
you can meet others who share your
same fantasies!
8. You can learn to assess character and
to sharpen your instincts. When you're
up against Chewbacca and are on your
tiptoes to reach his kneecaps, your fenc
ing instincts will prompt you to rely on

your speed and agility. Your intuition
should tell you to run like hell off the
fencing strip, but this is an option not
open to the serious fencer.
9. You can gain sympathy and affection
from peers and make new friends. After
friends see the purplish, swollen welts
all over your arms and back (caused by
the flat saber, not the wimpy foil), they
will immediately rush to comfort you.
Meet new people by wearing tank tops
and brandishing the colorful bruises all
over your forearms. No one will be able

to suppress their curiosity after seeing
your grotesque malformations, which are
a terrific conversation topic.
10. You can go pro. Eighty percent of Stan
ford's varsity fencing team came from
the beginning fencing classes. Fulfill
your dream of being a team member
in a competitive college sport. Fencing
is one of the few sports that you aren't
required to begin as a fetus in order
to be any good.
In general, fencing is a sharp skill to
learn that will always keep you on the edge.

your grotesque malformations, which are
a terrific conversation topic.
10. You can go pro. Eighty percent of Stan
ford's varsity fencing team came from
the beginning fencing classes. Fulfill
your dream of being a team member
in a competitive college sport. Fencing
is one of the few sports that you aren't
required to begin as a fetus in order
to be any good.
In general, fencing is a sharp skill to
learn that will always keep you on the edge.

"Fencing is one of the few sports that
doesn't require any freakish body type,"
according to Stanford fencing instructor
Sherry Posthumus. "All you need is a good
mind."
While the good mind may be out of your
range, your body and any body can fence.
Each year at Stanford, around 400 students
(with normal and freakish bodies) take
fencing for recreational purposes. Accord
ing to Posthumus, these are the reasons
why:
1. You get to wield fun weapons. Swords
range from the foil, which has the
flexibility of a food service carrot, to the
ep£e, which is a little sturdier, to the
saber, your honest-to-goodness, Captain
Hook weapon. Broader and flatter than
the foil or ep6e, the sturdy saber gleams
wickedly and makes that fulfilling clank
ing noise upon contact.
2. Not only do you get to hold these
beauties, but you get to wave them
around, aim and, indeed, lunge at your
opponent with the sharp weaponry. It's
a dream come true. Release your aggres
sions; let that sadist in you come out,
but in the refined and graceful manner
of a top fencer.
3. You get to wear spanking white jackets,
sturdy masks that make you look like a
hornet-exterminator, and a leather glove,
crusty from protecting hundreds of
sweaty, bacteria-filled palms. If you get
to be really good, you can join the Stan
ford fencing team and get electrical ap
paratus rigged to your body. (Who says
fencing can't be an electrifying experi
ence?) Professional fencing matches are
monitored through the electrical contact
between the sword (which has a cord
running through it) and your lam 6
jacket. Yes, you, the stylish fencer, could

wear a gold lam 6 jacket that will surely
complete your "dressed to kill" image!
4. You can fool close friends and family
with your mastery of European fencing
terms. Drop words like "en garde, remise
and parry" while you're in your favorite
French restaurant. Scream "Riposte!"
when you see your friend and impress
the people around you with your vogue
greeting. It doesn't matter that these
are only complex fencing terms. If you
can get the accent haughty enough,
people will think you are cultured and
will want to be your friend.
5. You can use fencing to help you acquire
the grace and finesse you desire. This
dexterity is unlike ballet, which forces
you to twist your body into impossible,
Gumby-like positions. Your body was
simply not made to contort in grotesque
angles. Fencing will enable you to un
derstand and control your body with a
minimum of pulled muscles and liga
ments.
6. You can protect your honor, or what's
left of it, by challenging an offender to
a duel. Whether the incident was minor
or they ran over your foot in White
Plaza, preserve your dignity by throwing
down the gauntlet.
7. You can fulfill your desire to play out
the intense fencing scenes from the movie
"Princess Bride." Posthumus com
mented, "Once 'Princess Bride' came out,
the fencing classes filled up very quick
ly... people come into the classes with
very strange ideas." Not only can you
fantasize about being a movie character,
you can meet others who share your
same fantasies!
8. You can learn to assess character and
to sharpen your instincts. When you're
up against Chewbacca and are on your
tiptoes to reach his kneecaps, your fenc
ing instincts will prompt you to rely on

your speed and agility. Your intuition
should tell you to run like hell off the
fencing strip, but this is an option not
open to the serious fencer.
9. You can gain sympathy and affection
from peers and make new friends. After
friends see the purplish, swollen welts
all over your arms and back (caused by
the flat saber, not the wimpy foil), they
will immediately rush to comfort you.
Meet new people by wearing tank tops
and brandishing the colorful bruises all
over your forearms. No one will be able

to suppress their curiosity after seeing
your grotesque malformations, which are
a terrific conversation topic.
