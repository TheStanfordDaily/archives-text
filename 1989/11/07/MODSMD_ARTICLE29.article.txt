## Spikers set for UOP Cardinal looks to prove it can win NCAAs 
### David Earnest Senior staff writer 
For the Stanford women's volleyball
team, now is the time.
It's the time to show the NCAA they are
true contenders for the national title. And
it's the time to show themselves they can
win it.
Tonight's match against the University
of the Pacific begins the Cardinal's late
season surge toward the NCAA regionals.
Stanford, 13-7, is currently in second place
in the Pacific 10 Conference with a 9-4
record, just percentage points ahead of
Washington. A second-place conference
finish would virtually assure the Cardinal
of a tournament bid.
But the remainder of the season will be
no walk-over for the Cardinal. After
tonight's match, Stanford will travel to play
Arizona State and Arizona this weekend,
and then will host California, Washington
and Washington State next week. As if that
weren't enough, the Cardinal will close the
season Thanksgiving weekend with two
matches at top-ranked Hawaii.
"The schedule is not going i.o allow us
to continue to roll on," said Stanford Coach
Don Shaw, whose team has won five of its
last six conference matches. "When it gets
down to the end of the year, if this team
doesn't believe that it can win, it won't."
Although tonight's match against the
Tigers is a non-conference matchup, Shaw
said that how Stanford plays against No.
4 Pacific is a good indicator of the team's
standing in the chase for the national title.
"(Pacific) is another chance for us to get
a match against .. . one of the top teams
and another chance for us to find out if
we're good enough yet to win the champi
onship," Shaw said. "It's a measuring stick
type match against a tough team, [butl the
conference is still the most important
thing."
Tonight's match and the upcoming
matches against Hawaii also provide Stan
ford with a valuable opportunity to evalu
ate the country's top teams before the

NCAAs, where the squads may play each
other again.
"We have to learn how to deal with those
teams so that when we see them and it
really counts, we're used to it and we feel
good about it," Shaw said. "If we beat
them, then it gives that much more con
fidence the next time we see them."
Beating the Tigers, however, will be no
easy task. When the two teams faced each
other in Stockton on Sept. 12, Pacific won
the match in four games, 15-6, 15-8, 13-15,
16-14. Pacific, 21-4, has won five of its
last BLx matches but was upset by Long
Beach State on Saturday night.
Tonight's match is also a reunion in two
senses. Stanford freshman middle blocker
Bev Oden will face her sister, Tigers middle
blocker Elaina Oden, for the second time
in her college career. Bev led the Cardinal
in last week's matches, hitting .500 against
USC and UCLA.
With important conference matches up
coming in the following weeks, tonight's
match may seem of lesser importance. But
if Stanford doesn't play well now, then the
future may be quite a bit bleaker.
