# Stanford football will move up in ability but not in standings

### 
Stanford football is back!
The Cardinal clobbered UCLA,
that evil menace from the South,
and is set to win its final two games.
Carrying that momentum into next year,
and with another great recruiting class
by Denny Green, the team should have
a great year next year.
Maybe it will even break .500.
No, that is not some sort of typo. De
spite the fact the Cardinal seems to have
turned it around, despite the fact that a
truckload of talent will be back and a
pickup-load of talent will be coming in
from those who are now redshirting —
despite all this — Stanford will be hard
pressed to win seven games.
The Cardinal plays in the Pacific 10
Conference, and that makes every game
a tough one. Just ask Arizona, who went
from Rose Bowl contender to California's
first Pac-10 victim in a matter of an hour.
And the Cardinal's non-league schedule
is much more difficult than this year's,
which Stanford went 0-3 against.
About 10 months from now, Stan
ford will open the 1990 season.
The team will have some combi
nation of Jon Volpe, Glyn Milburn and
Ellery Roberts in the backfield, a tre
mendous corps of wide receivers and the
biggest offensive line in school history.
On the other side of the ball, the Car
dinal will return 17 of the top 22 defen
sive players. The only problem is where

the season will open.
Stanford will do it in Boulder, Colo.,
home of the Buffaloes. Yes, the same
Colorado team that is currently ranked
No. 2 in the nation and will likely meet
No. 1 Notre Dame in the Orange Bowl
to decide the national title.
Speaking of the Irish, Stanford will
play them too.
In South Bend.
So no matter how optimistic you are,
you have to figure we'll lose those two.
With road games at revenge-minded
UCLA, Arizona and Oregon and home
games against powers USC, Washington
and Washington State, there aren't too
many gimmees.
And even cupcakes can jump up and
bite you, as evidenced by the results
against San Jose State and Utah. With
the Spartans back next year and the im
proving Oregon State Beavers on the

schedule, Stanford shouldn't bank on
winning more than five of those eight.
Assuming Cal is as bad as they are
this year, a Big Game win leaves Stanford
at 6-5.
With that scenario, the Cardinal
would finish in the top half of
the Pac-10 at 5-3, which would
be definitely respectable, and a good step
on the way to the Rose Bowl goal Coach
Denny Green has preached since arriving.
After Stanford beat the Bruins Satur
day, few people could restrain their op
timism. Quite simply, expectations ran
amok.
Everyone decided Stanford would win
its last two games of the season. But
while I'm perhaps the most optimistic
guy ever to write a column for this paper
(I was convinced we were going to beat
Notre Dame in Indiana last year), I
realize Arizona State is really good too.
In the past two weeks, the Sun Devils
have beaten both Washington and Wash
ington State, something Stanford hasn't
done in one season since 1982.
Now don't get me wrong here. I think
the Cardinal will come out all fired up
and stomp on the Sun Devils in Tempe
Saturday. But it isn't a given.
And neither is Big Game after the
Bears' performance Saturday.
So while the Cardinal may, and perhaps
even should, win both, the team might
not. And even if it does, that's no guar

antee we 11 be road tripping to the Rose
Bowl Jan. 1, 1991.
It's just that expectations thing.
Losing is a difficult thing. It is not
easy to bust your behind at practice
every day for three months and lose seven
of the first eight games. But the Stanford
players kept busting their behinds, and
it finally paid off.
Now next week, and next year, the
team should realize it can win every time
it takes the field. The key is also realizing
that you can't always beat Notre Dame.
Another victim of expectations is this
season's women's volleyball team. Coming
into the season, everyone said Stanford
and UCLA would be the most talented
teams around. But a key injury, incon
sistent playing, and a bit of downright
bad playing left them dazed with twice
as many losses as the team had all last
year.
Now, however, the team is not worry
ing about being better than everyone else.
The players are instead just trying to
work hard in practice and get better. If
they keep working hard and improving,
their record will take care of itself.
If its performance in the past two
weeks is any indication, the team has
put upset losses to Oregon and San Jose
State out of mind. In their last four
games, the women met three teams
ranked lower in the polls, even though
the Cardinal had lost to two of them

earlier in the season.
Stanford went out, played hard and
crushed all three. Then the team met
No. 2 UCLA Friday night. The Bruins
played one of their best matches of the
season and beat Stanford somewhat easi
ly-
The team could have gotten all upset
but instead took it as a progress report.
The squad realizes it will have another
tough match tonight against No. 4 Uni
versity of the Pacific and will have a
good chance of getting another shot at
the Bruins in the NCAA playoffs.
No problem. If the team keeps
working hard, forgets about the
expectations and doesn't lose
sight of the fact that competing against
itself to improve every day in practice is
more important in the long run than
competing against UCLA or Hawaii, it
just might achieve some of its NCAA
goals.
One last bit of expectations. Wom
en's Basketball News Service
picked the Cardinal women's hoops
team as the top squad in the nation. It
also tabbed senior Jennifer Azzi as the
preseason Player of the Year, junior
Trisha Stevens as a preseason first-team
All-American, junior Sonja Henning as a
second-team pick, senior Katy Steding as
an honorable mention selection and Val
Whiting and Molly Goodenbour as frosh
All-America selections.

Maybe it will even break .500.
No, that is not some sort of typo. De
spite the fact the Cardinal seems to have
turned it around, despite the fact that a
truckload of talent will be back and a
pickup-load of talent will be coming in
from those who are now redshirting —
despite all this — Stanford will be hard
pressed to win seven games.
The Cardinal plays in the Pacific 10
Conference, and that makes every game
a tough one. Just ask Arizona, who went
from Rose Bowl contender to California's
first Pac-10 victim in a matter of an hour.
And the Cardinal's non-league schedule
is much more difficult than this year's,
which Stanford went 0-3 against.
About 10 months from now, Stan
ford will open the 1990 season.
The team will have some combi
nation of Jon Volpe, Glyn Milburn and
Ellery Roberts in the backfield, a tre
mendous corps of wide receivers and the
biggest offensive line in school history.
On the other side of the ball, the Car
dinal will return 17 of the top 22 defen
sive players. The only problem is where

the season will open.
Stanford will do it in Boulder, Colo.,
home of the Buffaloes. Yes, the same
Colorado team that is currently ranked
No. 2 in the nation and will likely meet
No. 1 Notre Dame in the Orange Bowl
to decide the national title.
Speaking of the Irish, Stanford will
play them too.
In South Bend.
So no matter how optimistic you are,
you have to figure we'll lose those two.
With road games at revenge-minded
UCLA, Arizona and Oregon and home
games against powers USC, Washington
and Washington State, there aren't too
many gimmees.
And even cupcakes can jump up and
bite you, as evidenced by the results
against San Jose State and Utah. With
the Spartans back next year and the im
proving Oregon State Beavers on the

schedule, Stanford shouldn't bank on
winning more than five of those eight.
Assuming Cal is as bad as they are
this year, a Big Game win leaves Stanford
at 6-5.
With that scenario, the Cardinal
would finish in the top half of
the Pac-10 at 5-3, which would
be definitely respectable, and a good step
on the way to the Rose Bowl goal Coach
Denny Green has preached since arriving.
After Stanford beat the Bruins Satur
day, few people could restrain their op
timism. Quite simply, expectations ran
amok.
Everyone decided Stanford would win
its last two games of the season. But
while I'm perhaps the most optimistic
guy ever to write a column for this paper
(I was convinced we were going to beat
Notre Dame in Indiana last year), I
realize Arizona State is really good too.
In the past two weeks, the Sun Devils
have beaten both Washington and Wash
ington State, something Stanford hasn't
done in one season since 1982.
Now don't get me wrong here. I think
the Cardinal will come out all fired up
and stomp on the Sun Devils in Tempe
Saturday. But it isn't a given.
And neither is Big Game after the
Bears' performance Saturday.
So while the Cardinal may, and perhaps
even should, win both, the team might
not. And even if it does, that's no guar

antee we 11 be road tripping to the Rose
Bowl Jan. 1, 1991.
It's just that expectations thing.
Losing is a difficult thing. It is not
easy to bust your behind at practice
every day for three months and lose seven
of the first eight games. But the Stanford
players kept busting their behinds, and
it finally paid off.
Now next week, and next year, the
team should realize it can win every time
it takes the field. The key is also realizing
that you can't always beat Notre Dame.
Another victim of expectations is this
season's women's volleyball team. Coming
into the season, everyone said Stanford
and UCLA would be the most talented
teams around. But a key injury, incon
sistent playing, and a bit of downright
bad playing left them dazed with twice
as many losses as the team had all last
year.
Now, however, the team is not worry
ing about being better than everyone else.
The players are instead just trying to
work hard in practice and get better. If
they keep working hard and improving,
their record will take care of itself.
If its performance in the past two
weeks is any indication, the team has
put upset losses to Oregon and San Jose
State out of mind. In their last four
games, the women met three teams
ranked lower in the polls, even though
the Cardinal had lost to two of them

earlier in the season.
Stanford went out, played hard and
crushed all three. Then the team met
No. 2 UCLA Friday night. The Bruins
played one of their best matches of the
season and beat Stanford somewhat easi
ly-
The team could have gotten all upset
but instead took it as a progress report.
The squad realizes it will have another
tough match tonight against No. 4 Uni
versity of the Pacific and will have a
good chance of getting another shot at
the Bruins in the NCAA playoffs.
No problem. If the team keeps
working hard, forgets about the
expectations and doesn't lose
sight of the fact that competing against
itself to improve every day in practice is
more important in the long run than
competing against UCLA or Hawaii, it
just might achieve some of its NCAA
goals.
One last bit of expectations. Wom
en's Basketball News Service
picked the Cardinal women's hoops
team as the top squad in the nation. It
also tabbed senior Jennifer Azzi as the
preseason Player of the Year, junior
Trisha Stevens as a preseason first-team
All-American, junior Sonja Henning as a
second-team pick, senior Katy Steding as
an honorable mention selection and Val
Whiting and Molly Goodenbour as frosh
All-America selections.

Stanford football is back!
The Cardinal clobbered UCLA,
that evil menace from the South,

by Denny Green, the team should have
