# Men's golf sits third
## Cevaer looms second, one shot off the pace 
### Brian W. Webber Staff writer 
The men's golf team saw its
first-round lead blown away as
the squad fell into third place yes
terday at the UC-Santa Barbara
Invitational in Lompoc, Calif.
Stanford's two-round team total
of 616 is eight strokes behind co
leaders host UC-Santa Barbara
and US International.
The tournament's format has
proved troublesome for the Car
dinal. Unlike the majority of col
legiate events, both rounds one
and two took place Monday.
The 36-hole routine became sig
nificant as the squad's afternoon
round was plagued by windy con
ditions.
The squad's blistering round
one total of 298 placed them in
sole possession of the lead.
The effect of the prevailing
gusts is clearly illustrated by the
20-stroke bulge in the Cardinal's
afternoon team total of 318.
Coach Wally Goodwin ran the
gamut of emotions in yesterday's
wind-swept event.
"I am elated with our play the
first round but am disappointed
with the afternoon scores," he
said.
The blustery playing conditions
had a profound impact on soph
omore Christian Cevaer, whose

score of 150 placed him in second
place and one shot behind the
leaders.
Cevaer posted a masterful two
under-par 70 in the pristine
morning round. His uncharac
teristic afternoon score of 80
largely can be attributed to the
stiff breezes, which appeared
around noon.
"This course played like a brute
this afternoon, and Christian's
scores show it," Goodwin said.
The impact of the afternoon
winds on the La Purisima course
is reflected in the contrast be
tween early and late rounds of
the four other Cardinal linksters.
Senior Don Christiansen saw
his steady round-one total of 75
balloon to an afternoon 81. Chris
tiansen's senior teammates, Brad
Benbrook and Chris Barbour, suf
fered similar fates.
Junior Johan Remmelgas was
"steady" with scores of 77 and
78, according to Goodwin.
Stanford's 8:15 a.m. tee time
this morning should aid the Car
dinal's quest for its second con
secutive tournament title, as the
squad will not have to wrangle
with the winds.
Goodwin was optimistic about
his squad's chances: "With a
return to usual playing condi
tions, I definitely look for im
provement."
