# Athletes of the Week
## 
### 
With almost every Cardinal squad facing
UCLA this week, it provided a great chance
for Stanford fans to catch the North-South
rivalry at its best. It also made it easier to
select The Daily's Athletes of the Week: find
out who hurt the Bruins most.
Based upon this formula, this week's win
ners are Bev Oden of the volleyball team
and Rob Englehardt of the football team.
Oden, a 6-foot-2 freshman from Irvine,

Calif., has been a big reason why the Car
dinal is ranked No. 7 in the nation this
year. She currently leads the team in block
ing and hitting percentage by a large margin
and is second in both kills and digs.
Oden started the week by coming up with
a career-best 18 kills and a .659 hitting
percentage in Stanford's three-game win
over USC at Old Pavilion Thursday night.
The next night the Cardinal met, you
guessed it, UCLA. Stanford fell in three
straight games to the second-ranked Bruins
but Oden had seven kills, 12 digs and six
blocks.
For the week. Oden hit .500. She has hit
a torrid .522 over the span of her last six
matches. She currently leads the Pacific 10
Conference in blocking average and is second
to Bruin Daiva Tomkus, last year's league
Player of the Year, with her .372 hitting
percentage.
Stanford will put its 13-7 record on the
line against No. 4 University of the Pacific
tonight in Old Pavilion at 7:30 p.m.

Englehardt, a 6-1, 195-pound senior strong
safety from Tampa, Fla., was instrumental
in Stanford's 17-14 victory over you-know
who at Stanford Stadium Saturday.
Englehardt had 12 tackles on the game,
including a team-leading six solos, and was
one of the leaders of the fired-up Cardinal
defense.
Englehardt also batted down a pass and
sacked UCLA punter Kirk Maggio for a

seven-yard loss to give Stanford the ball on
the Bruin 38.
The Cardinal defense allowed the Bruins
only 13 first downs for the game, seven
fewer than their season average, including
only 127 yards, four first downs and no
points in the second half.
With the win, Stanford is one-third of the
way to the team's goal of winning its final
three games
