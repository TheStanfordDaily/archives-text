# Spikers Feldman, Sawin spend freshman year in dominant roles
## 
### Harold Yu Staff writer 
Editor's note: This is the second in a
two-part series covering the freshman
standouts on the volleyball team.

Shortly after the start of the second
game in last Friday's match against top

ranked UCLA, Stanford Coach Don Shaw
inserted freshman back row specialist
Laurie Sawin into the Cardinal lineup,
bypassing several experienced upperclass
men who had yet to escape the bench.
Sawin served immediately following the
substitution, leading a team that included
four freshmen back into the fray against
the mighty Bruins.

Such unyielding willingness on the part
of Shaw to utilize this year's freshman
recruits — Bev Oden, Carrie Feldman,
Kristi Paaso and Sawin — in high
intensity situations characterizes the
overwhelming impact the recruiting class
has made and the deep respect it com
mands from opposing players and fellow
teammates alike.
Despite the more complex schemes and
heightened competition intrinsic to col
legiate play, the recruits have forcibly
and instantly commandeered a dominant
role in the team's immediate future.
During her sophomore year at Davis
High School, Carrie Feldman played
junior varsity volleyball. "I was really
bad," she said. As a freshman at Stanford
just three years later, Feldman is leading
the Cardinal to a prospective second-place
finish in the Pacific 10 Conference and
a resurgent second half of the season.
A displaced gymnast, Feldman ar
guably has ascended the volleyball ranks
faster than any other player in the coun
try. Introduced to the game by a group
of volleyball-enthused friends, Feldman
initiated her volleyball career as a hitter
for her high school's junior varsity squad.
Staying with the game because she "en
joyed playing and liked the coaching,"
Feldman converted to the setter position
the next year with the encouragement of
a varsity coach and immediately ter
minated any speculation that she would
be "handicapped by her lack of experi
ence."
Within two years at the varsity level,
Feldman was honored as a first team
All-American by Volleyball Monthly, the
NorCal Volleyball Athlete of the Year in
the past two seasons, a Reebok All-
American, and the fifth-ranked player on
the Fab-50 listing of top junior players
in the country — the highest ranking
accorded to a setter.
Feldman's Davis High team, capitaliz
ing on Carrie's accomplished play and
leadership, advanced to the state semi
finals in her junior year and the state
finals the next season. Like freshman
Paaso, her team's season concluded with
a loss to Oden's Irvine High School.
Shaw felt fortunate that Feldman con
tacted him and said she "wanted to come
to Stanford all along."
"She has a nice touch, good leadership
qualities and the ability to take charge
of the team by leading in a positive way,"
Shaw said.
Since taking the helm of the Cardinal
offense after an injury to starting setter
Lara Asper, Feldman was understandably
overwhelmed by the pressures of the sit
uation. "I felt like I had to learn every
thing at once," Feldman said. "Even now,

'I do at times get frus
trated, but I try to work
hard at practices and
raise the level of play.
When I really start dig
ging, the other players
realize that they have
to improve some. I sort
of keep everyone up
beat.'

I'm still trying to get everything into my
brain."
Despite early reservations, Feldman re
mains confident because everything
"seems to be working out."
For an individual so highly touted in
high school and a player pushed imme
diately into a high pressure role, "Rasta"
— as teammates call their young setter
— has remained noticeably collected dur
ing her early trials.
"Carrie is so laid back," Sawin said.
"She has a relaxed attitude but a great
sarcastic sense of humor."
This serene outlook, however, certainly
has not compromised her goals and ex
pectations for the team. Feldman still
worries about the "inconsistency" the
team has shown at times and fears that
it sometimes "takes for granted beating
certain opponents." Feldman hopes to aid
in remedying these minor afflictions with
the ultimate prospects of Hawaii and the
NCAAs in mind.
Sawin, a Corona Del Mar High stand
out who provided valuable minutes for
Shaw's Cardinal early in the year, learned
the game later than any other player on
the team. She competed for the first time
in April of her freshman year in high
school.
Fully utilizing her quickness and
agility, Sawin surprised many by perfect
ing her game in such a short period of
time.
Although at Stanford her status is not
as defined as that of the three freshman
starters, Shaw quickly points out that
she is valuable.
"Laurie has an excellent attitude and
definitely knows how to work hard,"
Shaw said. "She's got tremendous ability

and is really skilled in ball control and
the back court. Her front court abilities
will determine how far she goes in our
system."
If Sawin's record is any indication, she
soon may be filling a much broader role
on the team. Her solid contributions were
instrumental to the Junior National
Championship her club team captured
last year and the second-place finish of
her high school team at the California
Interscholastic Federation tournament
during her junior year.
Her accomplished skills have landed
her exclusive memberships on the All-
CIF first team and the Coaches Poll All-
America team.
Amid the bountiful talent the Cardinal
possesses, Tex — a nickname that alludes
to Sawin's origins — has temporarily
settled into an auxiliary role.
"I do at times get frustrated, but I try
to work hard at practices and raise the
level of play," she said. "When I really
start digging, the other players realize
that they have to improve some. I sort
of keep everyone upbeat."
Because she is not on scholarship and
is unable to "take five years to finish
school," Laurie stresses that academics
definitely take priority. "I don't really
have the opportunity to mess around,"
she said.
As such, Sawin plans to continue to
work hard in both endeavors. "I have to
accept the coach's decisions, but I do wish
that he could put me in there more often
and give me a chance to prove myself. I
think that definitely by my junior and
senior years, I can play a contributing
role on the team. Right now, I just want
to improve."

think that definitely by my junior and
senior years, I can play a contributing
role on the team. Right now, I just want
to improve."

Freshman setter Carrie Feldman has stepped into the Cardinal starting lineup
and played like a veteran.

Editor's note: This is the second in a
two-part series covering the freshman
standouts on the volleyball team.

Shortly after the start of the second
game in last Friday's match against top

ranked UCLA, Stanford Coach Don Shaw
inserted freshman back row specialist
Laurie Sawin into the Cardinal lineup,
bypassing several experienced upperclass
men who had yet to escape the bench.
Sawin served immediately following the
substitution, leading a team that included
four freshmen back into the fray against
the mighty Bruins.

Such unyielding willingness on the part
of Shaw to utilize this year's freshman
recruits — Bev Oden, Carrie Feldman,
Kristi Paaso and Sawin — in high
intensity situations characterizes the
overwhelming impact the recruiting class
has made and the deep respect it com
mands from opposing players and fellow
teammates alike.
Despite the more complex schemes and
heightened competition intrinsic to col
legiate play, the recruits have forcibly
and instantly commandeered a dominant
role in the team's immediate future.
During her sophomore year at Davis
High School, Carrie Feldman played
junior varsity volleyball. "I was really
bad," she said. As a freshman at Stanford
just three years later, Feldman is leading
the Cardinal to a prospective second-place
finish in the Pacific 10 Conference and
a resurgent second half of the season.
A displaced gymnast, Feldman ar
guably has ascended the volleyball ranks
faster than any other player in the coun
try. Introduced to the game by a group
of volleyball-enthused friends, Feldman
initiated her volleyball career as a hitter
for her high school's junior varsity squad.
Staying with the game because she "en
joyed playing and liked the coaching,"
Feldman converted to the setter position
the next year with the encouragement of
a varsity coach and immediately ter
minated any speculation that she would
be "handicapped by her lack of experi
ence."
Within two years at the varsity level,
Feldman was honored as a first team
All-American by Volleyball Monthly, the
NorCal Volleyball Athlete of the Year in
the past two seasons, a Reebok All-
American, and the fifth-ranked player on
the Fab-50 listing of top junior players
in the country — the highest ranking
accorded to a setter.
Feldman's Davis High team, capitaliz
ing on Carrie's accomplished play and
leadership, advanced to the state semi
finals in her junior year and the state
finals the next season. Like freshman
Paaso, her team's season concluded with
a loss to Oden's Irvine High School.
Shaw felt fortunate that Feldman con
tacted him and said she "wanted to come
to Stanford all along."
"She has a nice touch, good leadership
qualities and the ability to take charge
of the team by leading in a positive way,"
Shaw said.
Since taking the helm of the Cardinal
offense after an injury to starting setter
Lara Asper, Feldman was understandably
overwhelmed by the pressures of the sit
uation. "I felt like I had to learn every
thing at once," Feldman said. "Even now,

'I do at times get frus
trated, but I try to work
hard at practices and
raise the level of play.
When I really start dig
ging, the other players
realize that they have
to improve some. I sort
of keep everyone up
beat.'

I'm still trying to get everything into my
brain."
Despite early reservations, Feldman re
mains confident because everything
"seems to be working out."
For an individual so highly touted in
high school and a player pushed imme
diately into a high pressure role, "Rasta"
— as teammates call their young setter
— has remained noticeably collected dur
ing her early trials.
"Carrie is so laid back," Sawin said.
"She has a relaxed attitude but a great
sarcastic sense of humor."
This serene outlook, however, certainly
has not compromised her goals and ex
pectations for the team. Feldman still
worries about the "inconsistency" the
team has shown at times and fears that
it sometimes "takes for granted beating
certain opponents." Feldman hopes to aid
in remedying these minor afflictions with
the ultimate prospects of Hawaii and the
NCAAs in mind.
Sawin, a Corona Del Mar High stand
out who provided valuable minutes for
Shaw's Cardinal early in the year, learned
the game later than any other player on
the team. She competed for the first time
in April of her freshman year in high
school.
Fully utilizing her quickness and
agility, Sawin surprised many by perfect
ing her game in such a short period of
time.
Although at Stanford her status is not
as defined as that of the three freshman
starters, Shaw quickly points out that
she is valuable.
"Laurie has an excellent attitude and
definitely knows how to work hard,"
Shaw said. "She's got tremendous ability

and is really skilled in ball control and
the back court. Her front court abilities
will determine how far she goes in our
system."
If Sawin's record is any indication, she
soon may be filling a much broader role
on the team. Her solid contributions were
instrumental to the Junior National
Championship her club team captured
last year and the second-place finish of
her high school team at the California
Interscholastic Federation tournament
during her junior year.
Her accomplished skills have landed
her exclusive memberships on the All-
CIF first team and the Coaches Poll All-
America team.
Amid the bountiful talent the Cardinal
possesses, Tex — a nickname that alludes
to Sawin's origins — has temporarily
settled into an auxiliary role.
"I do at times get frustrated, but I try
to work hard at practices and raise the
level of play," she said. "When I really
start digging, the other players realize
that they have to improve some. I sort
of keep everyone upbeat."
Because she is not on scholarship and
is unable to "take five years to finish
school," Laurie stresses that academics
definitely take priority. "I don't really
have the opportunity to mess around,"
she said.
As such, Sawin plans to continue to
work hard in both endeavors. "I have to
accept the coach's decisions, but I do wish
that he could put me in there more often
and give me a chance to prove myself. I
think that definitely by my junior and
senior years, I can play a contributing
role on the team. Right now, I just want
to improve."
