T-shirt scuffle draws police
Police were called into White Plaza yesterday
afternoon to break up a shoving match between
two boisterous T-shirt vendors. No arrests were
made.
Upon arriving at his stand shortly after 4 p.m.,
Gary Freed of Purely Academic T-Shirts told
Jeffrey Bischoff of Cinder Block T-Shirts that he
and his stand were not welcome. The two then
began "pushing each other around," according
to one witness.
Freed has been selling T-shirts in White Plaza
for about seven years, Purely Academic employee
Kristina Fowler said. Yesterday was Bischoffs
first day of business at Stanford.
According to Fowler, Freed's former girlfriend,
Cinder, broke up with Freed and established
Cinder Block T-Shirts with Bischoff, "ripping off"
Freed's designs.
Bischoff denied the charge.
Freed told police that he was not trying to

start a fight with Bischoff, but was instead
"trying to intimidate him so he'd know I don't
like him being here."
Fowler said there has been bad blood between
Bischoff and Freed for some time and that Bis
choffs decision to sell Cinder Block shirts in
White Plaza was "the last straw" that broke their
relationship.
Police told both parties that they expected no
further incidents.
