## Group undergoes growth as it enters third decade 
### Quan Phung Staff writer 
After 20 years and many
changed attitudes, the Asian
American Student Association is
experiencing a renaissance of
cultural, social and political ac
tivity that has led the
organization to pursue an
agenda AASA's founders could
only envision.
Mobilizing the diverse groups
of Asian-Americans at Stanford
toward common goals and
ideals, AASA today is more ac
tive than in past years, provid
ing an array of social and
cultural activities as well as ac
tively pursuing the development
of Asian-American studies pro
grams.
Rick Yuen, the newly ap
pointed assistant dean of Stu
dent Affairs and director of the
Asian American Activities Cen
ter, noticed AASA's impact on
the Asian-American community
here immediately when he
stepped on campus. "Students
are really interested in par
ticipating in activities," he said.
Judy Wu, co-chair of AASA's
Issues Committee, said that as
a result of the success of the
Asian American Students Ori
entation Committee's presenta
tion at "The Fire Within"
program, more than 300 stu
dents jammed into the activities
center to attend the first AASA
meeting this year.
These numbers have in
creased significantly from the
days earlier in the decade when
five to seven AASA members
met during winter quarter in a
cold room at the Old Firehouse,
according to Elsa Tsutaoka,

class of '87, a former AASA
member and now a full-time
staff member at the activities
center.
The fervor and excitement of
AASA today is reminiscent of
the Asian-American group orig

inally founded by alumni Nelson
Dong and Jay Wong 20 years
ago this week.
